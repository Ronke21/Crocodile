<text>Tony Danza (born Anthony Salvatore Iadanza; April 21, 1951) is an American actor and retired professional boxer. He is known for co-starring in the television series &quot;Taxi&quot; (1978–1983) and &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; (1984–1992), for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award and four Golden Globe Awards. In 1998, Danza won the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Male Performer in a New Television Series for his work on the 1997 sitcom &quot;The Tony Danza Show&quot; (not to be confused with his 2004–2006 daytime variety talk show of the same name). He has also appeared in films such as &quot;The Hollywood Knights&quot; (1980), &quot;Going Ape!&quot; (1981), &quot;She&#x27;s Out of Control&quot; (1989), &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; (1994), &quot;Crash&quot; (2004), and &quot;Don Jon&quot; (2013).

==Early life==
Danza was born on April 21, 1951, in Brooklyn, New York, to parents Anna Mary (née Camisa; 1925–1993) and Matthew Anthony &quot;Matty&quot; Iadanza (1920–1983). His mother was a bookkeeper and his father worked as a waste collector in Brooklyn. Danza&#x27;s paternal grandparents were from Pietrelcina, Benevento, Campania, Italy, and his mother was an immigrant from the town of Campobello di Mazara in the Sicilian province of Trapani. He has a younger brother, Matty Jr. (born 1954), a Los Angeles restaurant owner. He lived in East New York, Brooklyn until he was 14, and his family relocated to Malverne, New York, on Long Island. Danza attended Malverne Senior High School, graduating in 1968. In the first episode of his show &quot;Teach: Tony Danza&quot;, Danza describes himself as a &quot;bad student&quot; in high school. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history in 1972 from the University of Dubuque, which he attended on a wrestling scholarship. In 1975, as a joke, Danza&#x27;s friends entered him in the New York City Golden Gloves Tournament. After knocking out his first six opponents all in the first round, Danza was knocked out in the finals.

During his first year of college, he had the Robert Crumb &quot;Keep on Truckin&#x27;&quot; character tattooed on his upper right arm. In a 1985 interview in &quot;Us Weekly&quot; magazine, Danza remarked, &quot;I was playing pool with a guy who had all these tattoos, and I wanted to be friends.&quot; Danza also sports a &quot;Keep Punching&quot; boxing gloves tattoo on his right shoulder as well as &quot;Tracy&quot;, his (former) wife&#x27;s name, on his chest. In college, Danza met and married his first wife.

==Career==
===Boxing===
Danza was a professional boxer with a record of 8 wins and 3 losses (8 knockouts, 6 in the first round). He competed from 1976 until 1979 in the middleweight division.

===Acting and show business===
Shortly after his college graduation from the University of Dubuque, Danza was discovered by a producer at a boxing gymnasium in New York. He then earned a spot on the television show &quot;Taxi&quot; (1978-1983), playing a cab driver and part-time boxer Tony Banta, and later starred on &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; (1984–1992), in which he portrayed Tony Micelli, a former baseball player, housekeeper, and single father. For his contribution to the television industry, in 1988, Danza was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard.

Danza&#x27;s movie debut was in the comedy &quot;The Hollywood Knights&quot; (1980), which was followed by &quot;Going Ape!&quot; (1981), &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1984), and &quot;She&#x27;s Out of Control&quot; (1989). Later films included the role of Mel Clark, a baseball player, in &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; (1994), Juror No. 7 in the TV-movie &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1997), and Fred in &quot;Crash&quot; (2004).

Danza also starred in the short-lived sitcoms &quot;Hudson Street&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Tony Danza Show&quot; (1997), not to be confused with his 2004–2006 talk show, &quot;The Tony Danza Show&quot;. He had a role in the TV drama &quot;Family Law&quot; from 2000 until 2002.

He was nominated for an Emmy Award for a guest-starring 1998 role in the TV series &quot;The Practice&quot;. He received critical acclaim for his performance in the 1999 Broadway revival of the Eugene O&#x27;Neill play &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;. In 2002, Danza released his debut album &quot;The House I Live In&quot; as a 1950s-style crooner.

Danza hosted his own TV talk show, &quot;The Tony Danza Show&quot; (2004-2006), that was produced each weekday morning in his hometown of New York and was syndicated across the US. On May 9, 2005, during a go-kart race with NASCAR star Rusty Wallace, who was a guest on the show, Danza&#x27;s kart flipped after Wallace accidentally bumped him. Neither he nor Wallace was wearing a helmet at the time, and both were uninjured. Danza returned to go-kart racing on October 20, 2005, to challenge IndyCar driver Danica Patrick, but his brakes malfunctioned and he skidded into a wall, unharmed. His daytime talk show ended in May 2006; the last live episode aired on May 26, 2006.

He starred on Broadway as Max Bialystock in &quot;The Producers&quot;, from December 19, 2006, to March 11, 2007, and reprised his role at the Paris Las Vegas from August 13, 2007, to February 9, 2008.

Danza hosted the 4th season of &quot;The Contender&quot; in 2008.

A Broadway adaptation of the 1992 film &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; opened on a pre-Broadway run at New Jersey&#x27;s Paper Mill Playhouse on September 26, 2013, co-starring Danza and Tony nominee Rob McClure, with Gary Griffin directing. Danza was inducted into the Ride of Fame in December 2014, and the double-decker sightseeing bus commemorated his role in the Broadway musical.

Danza portrayed Jon Martello Sr. in &quot;Don Jon&quot; (2013). He also starred as Tony Caruso Sr. in the 2018 Netflix series &quot;The Good Cop&quot; as &quot;a disgraced, former NYPD officer who never followed the rules.&quot; It was canceled after one season.

===Teaching===
During the 2009–2010 school year Danza filmed A&amp;E reality show &quot;&quot;, in which he co-instructed a 10th grade English class at Northeast High School in Philadelphia. It premiered on October 1, 2010. The book &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Apologize to Every Teacher I Ever Had: My Year as a Rookie Teacher at Northeast High&quot; (), which was released in 2012, was based on his year of teaching.

==Personal life==
Danza&#x27;s first marriage was to Rhonda Yeoman. They wed in 1970 and divorced in 1974. They have two children, a boy and a girl. Their son Marc appeared with Danza on &quot;Taxi&quot; in two episodes as Brian Sims.

In 1986, Danza married Tracy Robinson. The couple separated in 2006 and filed for divorce on March 10, 2011; the divorce was finalized on February 6, 2013. They have two daughters.

In 2008, Danza and his son Marc co-authored a cookbook, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fill Up on the Antipasto: Tony Danza&#x27;s Father-Son Cookbook&quot;.

At one point Danza was a partner in Alleva Dairy, promoted as America&#x27;s oldest cheese shop, on Grand Street in the Little Italy section of Manhattan.

<text>Ali Ahmad Said Esber ( ; born 1 January 1930), also known by the pen name Adonis or Adunis ( ), is a Syrian poet, essayist and translator. Maya Jaggi, writing for The Guardian stated &quot;He led a modernist revolution in the second half of the 20th century, &quot;exerting a seismic influence&quot; on Arabic poetry comparable to T.S. Eliot&#x27;s in the anglophone world.&quot;

Adonis&#x27;s publications include twenty volumes of poetry and thirteen of criticism. His dozen books of translation to Arabic include the poetry of Saint-John Perse and Yves Bonnefoy, and the first complete Arabic translation of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (2002). His multi-volume anthology of Arabic poetry (&quot;Dīwān ash-shi&#x27;r al-&#x27;arabī&quot;), covering almost two millennia of verse, has been in print since its publication in 1964.

A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, Adonis has been described as the greatest living poet of the Arab world.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born to a modest Alawite farming family in January 1930, Adonis hails from the village of al-Qassabin near the city of Latakia in western Syria. He was unable to afford formal schooling for most of his childhood, and his early education consisted of learning the Quran in the local kuttab (mosque-affiliated school) and memorizing classical Arabic poetry, to which his father had introduced him.

In 1944, despite the animosity of the village chief and his father&#x27;s reluctance, the young poet managed to recite one of his poems before Shukri al-Quwatli, the president of the newly-established Republic of Syria, who was on a visit to al-Qassabin. After admiring the boy&#x27;s verses, al-Quwatli asked him if there was anything he needed help with. &quot;I want to go to school,&quot; responded the young poet, and his wish was soon fulfilled in the form of a scholarship to the French lycée at Tartus. The school, the last French Lycée school in Syria at the time, was closed in 1945, and Adonis was transferred to other national schools before graduating in 1949. He was a good student, and managed to secure a government scholarship. In 1950 Adonis published his first collection of verse, &quot;Dalila&quot;, as he joined the Syrian University (now Damascus University) to study law and philosophy, graduating in 1954 with a BA in philosophy. He later earned a doctoral degree in Arabic literature from Saint Joseph University in 1973.

While serving in the military in 1955–56, Adonis was imprisoned for his membership in the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (following the assassination of Adnan al-Malki), Led by Antoun Saadeh, the SSNP had opposed European colonization of Greater Syria and its partition into smaller nations. The party advocated a secular, national (not strictly Arab) approach toward transforming Greater Syria into a progressive society governed by consensus and providing equal rights to all, regardless of ethnicity or sect.

===Name===
The name &quot;Adonis&quot; (pronounced ah-doh-NEES) was picked up by Adonis himself at age 17, after being rejected by a number of magazines under his real name, to &quot;alert napping editors to his precocious talent and his pre-Islamic, pan-Mediterranean muses&quot;.

===Personal life===
Adonis was married in 1956 to literary critic Khalida Said (née Saleh), who assisted in editing roles in both &quot;Shiʿr&quot; and &quot;Mawaqif&quot;. They have two daughters: Arwad and Ninar. As of 2012, Arwad serves as the director of the Maison des Cultures du Monde and Ninar, an artist, moves between Paris and Beirut. Adonis has lived in Paris, France, since 1975.

In his book &quot;Identité inachevée&quot; he expresses opposition to &quot;religion as an institution imposed on the whole of society&quot; but support of individual religious freedom. He describes himself as a &quot;pagan mystic&quot;, elaborating:

In an interview at the occasion of the release of his new book Adoniada in France he stated that, in his view, religion and poetry were contradictory because &quot;religion is an ideology, it is an answer whereas poetry remains always a question&quot;.

===Beirut and Paris===
In 1956, Adonis fled Syria for Beirut, Lebanon. He joined a vibrant community of artists, writers, and exiles; Adonis settled abroad and has made his career largely in Lebanon and France, where in 1957 he cofounded the magazine &quot;Majallat Shiʿr&quot; (&quot;Poetry Magazine&quot;). The magazine, though arguably the most influential Arab literary journal, met with strong criticism for its publication of experimental poetry. &quot;Majallat Shiʿr&quot; temporarily ceased publication in 1964, and Adonis did not rejoin the &quot;Shiʿr&quot; editors when they resumed publication in 1967. He wrote a manifesto dated 5 June 1967 which he published in &quot;Al Adab&quot;, a Lebanese magazine, and in &quot;Souffles&quot;, a Moroccan magazine. A French translation of his manifesto appeared in the French magazine &quot;Esprit&quot;. 

In Lebanon, his intense Arab nationalist convictions found their outlet in the Beirut newspaper &quot;Lisan al-Hal&quot; and eventually in his founding of another literary periodical in 1968 titled &quot;Mawāqif&quot;, in which he again published experimental poetry. He was also one of the contributors to &quot;Lotus&quot; which was launched in 1968 and financed by Egypt and the Soviet Union.

Adonis&#x27;s poems continued to express his nationalistic views combined with his mystical outlook. With his use of Sufi terms (the technical meanings of which were implied rather than explicit), Adonis became a leading exponent of the Neo-Sufi trend in modern Arabic poetry, which took hold in the 1970s.

Adonis received a scholarship to study in Paris from 1960–61. From 1970–85 he was professor of Arabic literature at the Lebanese University. In 1976, he was a visiting professor at the University of Damascus. In 1980, he emigrated to Paris to escape the Lebanese Civil War. In 1980–81, he was professor of Arabic in Paris. From 1970 to 1985 he taught Arabic literature at the Lebanese University; he also has taught at the University of Damascus, Sorbonne (Paris III), and, in the United States, at Georgetown and Princeton universities. In 1985, he moved with his wife and two daughters to Paris, which has remained their primary residence.

While in Syria, Adonis helped edit the cultural supplement of the newspaper &quot;Al-Thawra&quot;, but pro-government writers clashed with his agenda and forced him to flee the country.

==Editorship==
===&quot;Majallat Shiʿr&quot;===
Adonis joined the Syro-Lebanese poet Yusuf al-Khal in editing &quot;Majallat Shiʿr&quot; (English: &quot;Poetry Magazine&quot;), a modernist Arabic poetry magazine, which Al-Khal established in 1957. His name appeared as editor from the magazine&#x27;s fourth edition. By 1962 the magazine appeared with both Adonis and Al-Khal&#x27;s names side by side as &quot;Owners and Editors in Chief&quot;. While at &quot;Shiʿr&quot;, Adonis played an important role in the evolution of free verse in Arabic. Adonis and al-Khal asserted that modern verse needed to go beyond the experimentation of &quot;al-shiʿr al-hadith&quot; (modern, or free, verse), which had appeared nearly two decades earlier.

Also responding to a growing mandate that poetry and literature be committed to the immediate political needs of the Arab nation and the masses, Adonis and &quot;Shiʿr&quot; energetically opposed the recruitment of poets and writers into propagandist efforts. In rejecting &quot;al-ʾadab al-iltizām&quot; (&#x27;politically committed literature&#x27;), Adonis was opposing the suppression of the individual&#x27;s imagination and voice for the needs of the group. Poetry, he argued, must remain a realm in which language and ideas are examined, reshaped, and refined, in which the poet refuses to descend to the level of daily expediencies.

&quot;Shiʿr&quot; was published for ten years and was arguably the most influential Arab literary journal ever; it was recognized as the main platform and prime mover for the modernism movement in Arabic literature, it featured and helped bring to light poets such as Ounsi el-Hajj, Saadi Yousef and many others.

===&quot;Mawaqif&quot;===
Adonis later started another poetry magazine, titled &quot;Mawaqif&quot; (English: &quot;Positions&quot;); the magazine was first published in 1968, considered a significant literary and cultural quarterly. Adonis wanted in Mawqaif to enlarge the focus of &quot;Shiʿr&quot; by addressing the politics and the illusions of the Arab nations after their defeat in the Six-Day War, believing that literature by itself cannot achieve the renewal of society and that it should be related to a more comprehensive revolutionary movement of renovation on all levels.

A number of literary figures later joined and contributed to &quot;Mawaqif&quot;, including Elias Khoury, Hisham Sharabi and Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish among others.

Due to its revolutionary nature and free-thinking outlook, &quot;Mawaqif&quot; had to overcome some problems, including censorship by governments less open than Lebanon&#x27;s, financial difficulties that its independent nature entailed, and the problems that came in the wake of the Lebanese War. However, in spite of these difficulties, it continued to be in print until 1994.

===&quot;Al-Akhar&quot;===
Adonis also founded and edited &quot;Al-Akhar&quot; (English: &quot;The Other&quot;), a magazine dedicated to publishing original content as well as numerous literary translations of contemporary essays on philosophy and Arabism. The magazine published myriad essays on contemporary Arab thought and interrogated the relationship between political and religious thought. It expressed concern with structural impediments to the spreading of progress and freedom in the Arab world, and included writers such as Ahmed Barqawi and Mustafa Safwan. The magazine was published in Beirut from 2011 to 2013.

The magazine contained essays and was published by the Syrian businessman Hares Youssef.

==Poetry==
===&quot;The Songs of Mihyar of Damascus&quot;===
Published in 1961, this is Adonis&#x27;s third book of poetry, &quot;The Songs of Mihyar of Damascus&quot; (or the Damascene in different translation) marked a definitive disruption of existing poetics and a new direction in poetic language. In a sequence of 141 mostly short lyrics arranged in seven sections (the first six sections begin with &#x27;psalms&#x27; and the final section is a series of seven short elegies) the poet transposes an icon of the early eleventh century, Mihyar of Daylam (in Iran), to contemporary Damascus in a series, or vortex, of non-narrative &#x27;fragments&#x27; that place character deep &quot;in the machinery of language&quot;, and he wrenches lyric free of the &#x27;I&#x27; while leaving individual choice intact. The whole book has been translated by Adnan Haydar and Michael Beard as Mihyar of Damascus: His Songs (BOA Editions, NY 2008)

Some of the poems included in this collection:
* &quot;Psalm&quot;
* &quot;Not a Star&quot;
* &quot;King Mihyar&quot;
* &quot;His Voice&quot;
* &quot;An Invitation to Death&quot;
* &quot;New Covenant&quot;
* &quot;The End of the Sky&quot;
* &quot;He Carries in His Eyes&quot;
* &quot;Voice&quot;
* &quot;The Wound&quot;
And other poems.

The collection has been claimed to have &quot;reshaped the possibilities of Arabic lyric poetry&quot;.

===&quot;A Time Between Ashes and Roses&quot;===
In 1970 Adonis published &quot;A Time Between Ashes and Roses&quot; as a volume consisting of two long poems &#x27;An Introduction to the History of the Petty Kings&#x27; and &#x27;This Is My Name&#x27; and in the 1972 edition augmented them with &#x27;A Grave For New York.&#x27; These three astonishing poems, written out of the crises in Arabic society and culture following the disastrous 1967 Six-Day War and as a stunning decrepitude against intellectual aridity, opened out a new path for contemporary poetry. The whole book, in its augmented 1972 edition has a complete English translation by Shawkat M. Toorawa as &quot;A Time Between Ashes and Roses&quot; (Syracuse University Press 2004).

===&quot;This Is My Name&quot; (book)===
Written in 1969, the poem was first published in 1970 with two long poems, then reissued two years later with an additional poem (&quot;A Grave for New York&quot;), in &quot;A Time Between Ashes and Roses&quot; collection of poems.

In the poem, Adonis, spurred by the Arabs&#x27; shock and bewilderment after the Six-Day War, renders a claustrophobic yet seemingly infinite apocalypse. Adonis is hard at work undermining the social discourse that has turned catastrophe into a firmer bond with dogma and cynical defeatism throughout the Arab world. To mark this ubiquitous malaise, the poet attempts to find a language that matches it, and he fashions a vocal arrangement that swerves and beguiles.

The poem was the subject of wide study in the Arab literary community due to its mysterious rhythmic regime and its influence on the poetry movement in the 1960s and 70s after its publication.,

===&quot;A Grave for New York&quot; (poem)===
Also translated as &quot;The Funeral of New York&quot;, this poem was written after a trip to New York in 1971 during which Adonis participated in the International Poetry Forum in Pittsburgh, PA. The poem was published by Actes Sud in 1986, nearly two decades before it appeared in English, and depicts the desolation of New York City as emblematic of empire, described as a violently anti-American, in the poem Walt Whitman the known American poet, as the champion of democracy, is taken to task, particularly in Section 9, which addresses Whitman directly.

Adonis wrote the poem in spring 1971 after a visit to the United States. Unlike his poem &quot;The Desert&quot;, where Adonis presented the pain of war and siege without naming and anchoring the context, in this poem he refers explicitly to a multitude of historical figures and geographical locations. He pits poets against politicians, and the righteous against the exploitative. The English translation of this long poem from Arabic skips some short passages of the original (indicated by ellipses), but the overall effect remains intact. The poem is made up of 10 sections, each denouncing New York City in a different way. It opens by presenting the beastly nature of the city and by satirizing the Statue of Liberty.

&quot;A Grave for New York&quot; is an obvious example of Adonis&#x27;s larger project of reversing the Orientalist paradigm to re-claim what he terms &#x27;eastern&#x27; values as positive.

=== &quot;Al-Kitab&quot; (book)===
&quot;Al-Kitab&quot; means &quot;the book&quot; in Arabic. Adonis worked on this book, a three-volume epic that adds up to almost two thousand pages, from 1995 to 2003. In &quot;Al-Kitab,&quot; the poet travels on land and through the history and politics of Arab societies, beginning immediately after the death of Muhammad and progressing through the ninth century, which he considers the most significant period of Arab history, an epoch to which he repeatedly alludes. &quot;Al-Kitab&quot; provides a large lyric-mural rather than an epic that attempts to render the political, cultural, and religious complexity of almost fifteen centuries of Arab civilization. The book was translated into French by Houria Abdelouahed and published in 2013.

===&quot;Adonis: Selected Poems&quot; (book)===
Translated from Arabic by Khaled Mattawa and described as &quot;a genuine overview of the span of Adonis&#x27;s&quot;, this collection contains a number of poems of between five and fifteen or so pages in length.

==Literary criticism==

Adonis is often portrayed as entirely dismissive of the intellectual heritage of Arabic culture. Yet in al-Thābit wa-l-Mutaḥawwil (The Immutable and the Transformative), his emphasis on the plurality of Arabic heritage posits the richness of Arabic Islamic heritage and the deficiency of tradition as defined by imitation (taqlīd). He views culture as dynamic rather than immutable and transcendent, challenging the traditionalist homogenizing tendency within heritage.

In studying the Arabic cultural system, Adonis emphasizes that the concept of heritage is construed as a unified repertoire based on a consistent cultural essence that preconditions the rupture between this heritage and modernity.

Adonis&#x27;s critique of Arab culture did not merely call for the adoption of Western values, paradigms, and lifestyles per Science, which has evolved greatly in Western societies, with its &quot;intuitions and practical results,&quot; should be acknowledged as the &quot;most revolutionary development in the history of mankind&quot; argues Adonis. The truths that science offers &quot;are not like those of philosophy or of the arts. They are truths which everyone must of necessity accept, because they are proven in theory and practice.&quot; But science is guided by dynamics that make it insufficient as an instrument for human fulfilment and meaning: science&#x27;s reliance on transcending the past to achieve greater progress is not applicable to all facets of human activity. &quot;What does progress mean in poetry?&quot; asks Adonis. &quot;Nothing.&quot; Progress in the scientific sense pursues the apprehension of a phenomenon, seeking uniformity, predictability, and repeatability. As such, the idea of progress in science is &quot;quite separate from artistic achievement.&quot; Poetry and the other arts seek a kind of progress that affirms difference, elation, movement, and variety in life.

===&quot;The Static and the Dynamic&quot;===
&quot;The Static and the Dynamic: A Research into the Creative and the Imitative of Arabs&quot; (Arabic: &quot;Al-Thabit wa al-mutahawwil&quot;) was first published in 1974 till 1978 (still in print in Arabic, now in 8th edition) by Dar al-Saqi, the book is a four-volume study described in the under title as &quot;a study of creativity and adheration in Arabs), Adonis started original writings on the project as a PhD dissertation while at Saint Joseph University, in this study, still the subject of intellectual and literature controversy, Adonis offers his analysis of Arabic literature, he theorizes that two main streams have operated within Arabic poetry, a conservative one and an innovative one. The history of Arabic poetry, he argues, has been that of the conservative vision of literature and society (al-thabit), quelling poetic experimentation and philosophical and religious ideas (al-mutahawil). Al-thabit, or static current, manifests itself in the triumph of naql (conveyance) over &#x27;aql (original, independent thought); in the attempt to make literature a servant of religion; and in the reverence accorded to the past whereby language and poetics were essentially Quranic in their source and therefore not subject to change.

Adonis devoted much attention to the question of &quot;the modern&quot; in Arabic literature and society, he surveyed the entire Arabic literary tradition and concludes that, like the literary works themselves, attitudes to and analyses of them must be subject to a continuing process of reevaluation. Yet what he actually sees occurring within the critical domain is mostly static and unmoving. The second concern, that of particularity (khuṣūṣiyyah), is a telling reflection of the realization among writers and critics throughout the Arabic-speaking world that the region they inhabited was both vast and variegated (with Europe to the north and west as a living example). Debate over this issue, while acknowledging notions of some sense of Arab unity, revealed the need for each nation and region to investigate the cultural demands of the present in more local and particular terms. A deeper knowledge of the relationship between the local present and its own unique version of the past promises to furnish a sense of identity and particularity that, when combined with similar entities from other Arabic-speaking regions, will illustrate the immensely rich and diverse tradition of which 21st-century litterateurs are the heirs.

===&quot;An Introduction to Arab Poetics&quot;===
In &quot;An Introduction to Arab Poetics&quot; (2001), Adonis examines the oral tradition of the pre-Islamic poetry of Arabia and the relationship between Arabic poetry and the Quran, and between poetry and thought. He also assesses the challenges of modernism and the impact of western culture on the Arab poetic tradition.

==Artwork==
Adonis started making images using calligraphy, colour and figurative gestures around the year 2002. In 2012, a major tribute to Adonis, including an exhibition of his drawings and a series of literary events was organized in The Mosaic Rooms in West London.

On 19 May 2014 Salwa Zeidan Gallery in Abu Dhabi, was home to another noted exhibition by Adonis: Muallaqat (in reference to the original pre-Islamic era literary works Mu&#x27;allaqat), consisted of 10 calligraphy drawings of big format (150x50cm).

* 2003: Paris – Area Gallery
* 2007: Amman -Shuman`s Gallery (co-exhibition With Haydar)

* 2008: Paris – Le Louvre des Antiquaires : Calligraphies d`Orient. (Collectif)
* 2020: Berlin – Galerie Pankow: Adonis &quot;Vom Wort zum Bild&quot;

==Controversy==
===Expulsion from the Arab Writers&#x27; Union===
On 27 January 1995, Adonis was expelled from the Arab Writers Union for having met with Israelis at an UNESCO sponsored meeting in Granada, Spain, in 1993. His expulsion generated bitter debate among writers and artists across the Middle East. Two of Syria&#x27;s leading writers, Saadallah Wannous and Hanna Mina, resigned from the union in solidarity with Adonis.

===Death threats===
A known critic of Islamic religious values and traditions, who describes himself as a non-religious person, Adonis has previously received a number of death threats in consequence of his denouncement by the well-known Egyptian Salafi sheikh Mohamad Said Raslan who accused him of leaving his Muslim name (Ali) and taking a pagan name, in a circulated video he accused him as well of being a warrior against Islam and demanded his books to be banned describing him as a thing and an infidel.

In May 2012, in a statement issued on one of the Syrian opposition&#x27;s Facebook pages, supporters of the Syrian opposition argued that the literary icon deserved to die on three counts. First, he is Alawite. Second, he is also opposed to the Muslim religion. Third, he criticizes the opposition and rejects foreign military intervention in Syria.

In May 2012, a group of Lebanese and Syrian intellectuals issued an online condemnation in the wake of the call.

===Call for book burning===
In 2013, Islamic scholar Abdelfetah Zeraoui Hamadache called for Adonis&#x27;s books to be burned following a poem allegedly attributed to him. This came after the Salafi leader listened to the poem on social networks. He then issued a fatwa calling for the burning Adonis&#x27;s books in Algeria and in the Arab World.

The poem was later proven to be counterfeit (the poem is very weak in linguistic structure and differs greatly from Adonis&#x27;s literary style). Adonis commented: &quot;I am sorry that I am discussing a counterfeiting at this level. I hope that the source of the so-called poem is published. This is a shame for an Islamic scholar, the Arabic language and the entire Arab poem heritage.&quot;

He added: &quot;I am not sad about the burning of my books because this is an old phenomenon in our history. We are fighting to found a dialogue and a debate in a peaceful way. Founding differences in opinions is a source wealth. This counterfeiting humiliates Arabic.&quot;

===Arab Spring===
On 14 June 2011, amid the bloody crackdown on the Syrian uprising, Adonis wrote an open letter to Syria&#x27;s President Bashar al-Assad in the Lebanese newspaper As-Safir- &quot;as a citizen&quot; he stresses. Describing Syria as a brutal police state, he attacked the ruling Ba&#x27;ath Party, called on the president to step down, and warned that &quot;you cannot imprison an entire nation&quot;. He was nonetheless taken to task for addressing a tyrant as an elected president, and criticising the &quot;violent tendencies&quot; of some of his opponents.

Adonis said on the subject:

In August 2011, Adonis called in an interview in the Kuwaiti newspaper &quot;Al Rai&quot; for the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down because of his role in the Syrian civil war. He has also called upon the opposition to shun violence and engage in dialogue with the regime.

==Nobel Prize nomination==
A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, Adonis has been regularly nominated for the award since 1988. After winning Germany&#x27;s major award the Goethe Prize in 2011, he emerged as a front runner to be awarded the Nobel Prize, but it was instead awarded to the Swedish poet Tomas Tranströmer, with Peter Englund, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, commenting that there is no political dimension to the prize, and describing such a notion as &quot;literature for dummies&quot;.

Adonis has helped to spread Tomas Tranströmer&#x27;s fame in the Arab world, accompanying him on readings. He also wrote an introduction to the first translation of Tranströmer&#x27;s complete works into Arabic (published by Bedayat publishing house, translated by the Iraqi Kassem Hamady), stating that:

==Legacy and influence==

Adonis&#x27; poetry and criticism have been credited with &quot;far-reaching influence on the development of Arab poetry,&quot; including the creation of &quot;a new poetic language and rhythms, deeply rooted in classical poetry but employed to convey the predicament and responses of contemporary Arab society.&quot; According to Mirene Ghossein, &quot;one of the main contributions of Adonis to contemporary Arabic poetry is liberty-a liberty with themes, a liberty with words themselves through the uniqueness of poetic vision.&quot;

Adonis is considered to have played a role in Arab modernism comparable to T. S. Eliot&#x27;s in English-language poetry. The literary and cultural critic Edward Said, professor at Columbia University, called him &quot;today&#x27;s most daring and provocative Arab poet&quot;. The poet Samuel John Hazo, who translated Adonis&#x27;s collection &quot;The Pages of Day and Night,&quot; said, &quot;There is Arabic poetry before Adonis, and there is Arabic poetry after Adonis.&quot;

In 2007, Arabian Business named Adonis No. 26 in its 100 most powerful Arabs 2007 stating &quot;Both as a poet and a theorist on poetry, and as a thinker with a radical vision of Arab culture, Adonis has exercised a powerful influence both on his contemporaries and on younger generations of Arab poets. His name has become synonymous with the Hadatha (modernism) which his poetry embodies. Critical works such as &quot;Zamān al-shi&#x27;r&quot; (1972) are landmarks in the history of literary criticism in the Arab world.&quot;

In 2017, the judges&#x27; panel for the PEN/Nabokov Award cited &quot;Through the force of his language, boldness of his innovation, and depth of his feeling, Ali Ahmad Said Esber, known as &#x27;Adonis,&#x27; has helped make Arabic, one of the world&#x27;s oldest poetic languages, vibrant and urgent. A visionary who has profound respect for the past, Adonis has articulated his cherished themes of identity, memory and exile in achingly beautiful verse, while his work as critic and translator makes him a living bridge between cultures. His great body of work is a reminder that any meaningful definition of literature in the 21st century must include contemporary Arabic poetry.&quot;

<text>The Austin Motor Company Limited was a British manufacturer of motor vehicles, founded in 1905 by Herbert Austin in Longbridge. In 1952 it was merged with Morris Motors Limited in the new holding company British Motor Corporation (BMC) Limited, keeping its separate identity. The marque Austin was used until 1987 by BMC&#x27;s successors British Leyland and Rover Group. The trademark is currently owned by the Chinese firm SAIC Motor, after being transferred from bankrupt subsidiary Nanjing Automotive which had acquired it with MG Rover Group in July 2005.

==History==
===1905–1918: Formation and development===

While running the original Wolseley business, which had a highly cyclical sales pattern, Herbert Austin searched for products with a steady demand. Starting in 1895, he built three cars in his free time. They were among Britain&#x27;s first cars. The third car, a four-wheeler, was completed in 1899. By 1901 his fellow directors could not see future profit in motor vehicles and so with their blessing and the backing of the Vickers brothers Austin started a separate car manufacturing business still using the name Wolseley.

In 1905 he fell out with Thomas and Albert Vickers over engine design. Leaving his creation, Wolseley, which he had made Britain&#x27;s largest motor vehicle manufacturer, Austin obtained the backing of steel magnate Frank Kayser for his own enterprise. Kayser provided funds through mortgages and loans, debentures and guarantees to the Midland Bank thereby allowing Austin to keep virtually total ownership of his own business through his personal savings. Further assistance came from Dunlop patent holder Harvey du Cros. However, Austin&#x27;s great rival, William Morris, was able to enter the industry proper (he first repaired cars) a little later funding his operation entirely from his own resources.

In November 1905 Herbert Austin acquired a disused printing works which was less than ten years old. It was located seven miles south-west of Birmingham in the small village of Longbridge (then still within Worcestershire). The following month The Austin Motor Company Limited was incorporated. In the last week of April 1906 a large body of motorists travelled to Longbridge &quot;where snow lay full three inches deep on the ground and was still falling fast&quot; to see the new Austin car, a conventional four-cylinder model with chain drive. It was available as a 15/20 hp complete at £500 (chassis, £425) and a 25/30 hp for £650 (chassis, £550). The sole concessionaire for sale of the cars was Mr Harvey Du Cros junior.

Two things were noticeable about Austin&#x27;s new design. He had parted from the Vickers brothers because he had refused to use the then more conventional vertical engine in Wolseley cars. His new car had a vertical engine and, in all but minor detail, was identical to the English-built Clément-Gladiators assembled in the same factory.

A further injection of capital was needed in 1906 and William Harvey Du Cros (1846–1918) joined the board of directors. After that Harvey Du Cros junior of the Swift Cycle Co and Austin each held approximately half of the ordinary capital. Herbert Austin remained chairman and managing director.

Austin&#x27;s cars, like Wolseley&#x27;s, were luxury vehicles. The published customer list included Russian Grand Dukes, Princesses, Bishops, high officials of the Spanish government and a long list of Britain&#x27;s highest nobility.
Sources
Note: in 1912 Wolseley sold 3,000 cars.

In February 1914 Austin-manufactured bodies in tourer, limousine, landaulette and coupé styles could be provided with engines of 15, 20, 30 and 60 hp. Ambulances and commercial vehicles were also provided.

Austin became a public listed company in 1914 when the capital was increased to £650,000. At that time in number of cars produced it probably ranked fifth after Wolseley (still largest), Humber, Sunbeam and Rover.

The Austin Motor Co. grew enormously during the First World War fulfilling government contracts for aircraft, shells, heavy guns and generating sets and 1,600 three-ton trucks most of which were sent to Russia. The workforce expanded from around 2,500 to 22,000.

===1919–1939: Interwar success===

After the war Herbert Austin decided on a one-model policy based on the 3620 cc 20 hp engine. Versions included cars, commercials and even a tractor, but sales volumes were never enough to fill the vast factory built during wartime. The company went into receivership in 1921 but rose again after financial restructuring. Though Herbert Austin remained chairman he was no longer managing director and from that time decisions were made by committee.

Critical to the recovery was the appointment in 1922 of a new finance director, Ernest Payton with the backing of the Midland Bank, and a new works director in charge of car production, Carl Engelbach, at the insistence of the creditors&#x27; committee. This triumvirate of Austin, Payton and Engelbach steered the company&#x27;s fortunes through the interwar years.

In a quest to expand market share, smaller cars were introduced, the 1661 cc &quot;Twelve&quot; in 1922 and, later the same year, the &quot;Seven&quot;, an inexpensive, simple small car and one of the earliest to be directed at a mass market. One of the reasons for a market demand for a cars like the Austin 7 was the British tax code. In 1930 every personal car was taxed by its engine size, which in American dollars was $2.55 per cubic inch of piston displacement. As an example, the owner of an Austin 7 in England, which sold for approximately $455, would have to pay a yearly engine tax of $39. In comparison, the owner in England of a Ford Model-A would have to pay $120 per year in an engine tax. And this system of engine displacement tax was common in other European nations as well in the 1930s. At one point, the &quot;Baby Austin&quot; was built under licence by the fledgling BMW of Germany (as the Dixi); by the Japanese manufacturer Datsun; as the Bantam in the United States; and as the Rosengart in France. In England the Austin was the most produced car in 1930.

The American Austin Car Company struggled to sell tiny Austin cars in the US market. It operated as a largely independent subsidiary from 1929 to 1934 was revived after bankruptcy under the name &quot;American Bantam&quot; from 1937 to 1941. They became best known as the first company to submit the Bantam Reconnaissance Car working prototype, saving time by using Austin nose and fender parts of what would evolve into the extremely successful and iconic WWII Willys MB &quot;Jeep&quot;. The design was unfortunately handed over to Willys and Ford for production with a revised nose and fender design, while Bantam would largely just build trailers during the war.

With the help of the &quot;Seven&quot;, Austin weathered the worst of the depression and remained profitable through the 1930s, producing a wider range of cars which was steadily updated by the introduction of all-steel bodies, Girling brakes, and synchromesh gearboxes. However, all the engines retained the same side-valve configuration. Deputy chairman Ernest Payton became chairman in 1941 on the death of Lord Austin. In 1938 Leonard Lord joined the company board and became chairman in 1946 on the death of Ernest Payton.

====Datsun====

In 1932, Datsun built cars infringing Austin patents. From 1934, Datsun began to build Sevens under licence and this operation became the greatest success of Austin&#x27;s overseas licensing of its Seven. It marked the beginning of Datsun&#x27;s international success.

In 1952, Austin entered into another agreement with Datsun for assembly of 2,000 imported Austins from &quot;knock-down kits&quot;, to be sold in Japan under the Austin trademark. The agreement called for Nissan to make all Austin parts locally within three years, a goal Nissan met. Nissan produced and marketed Austins for seven years. The agreement also gave Nissan rights to use Austin patents, which Nissan used in developing its own engines for its Datsun line of cars. In 1953, British-built Austins were assembled and sold, but by 1955, the Austin A50 – completely assembled by Nissan and featuring a slightly larger body with 1489 cc engine – was on the market in Japan. Nissan produced 20,855 Austins between 1953 and 1959.
===1939–1958: War years and post-war years===

During the Second World War Austin continued building cars but also made trucks and aircraft, including Short Stirling and Avro Lancaster bombers.

The post-war car range was announced in 1944, and production started in 1945. The immediate post-war range was mainly similar to that of the late 1930s but did include the 16 hp, significant for having the company&#x27;s first overhead valve engine.

Austin J40 pedal cars were manufactured during this era.

====Austin of England====
From late 1950 to mid-1952 products, brochures and advertisements displayed in flowing script &quot;Austin of England&quot; as if in response to Morris&#x27; Nuffield Organization. It fell out of use with the financial merger with Morris in BMC.

====BMC====

In 1952, The Austin Motor Company Limited merged ownership, but not identity, with long-term rival Morris Motors Limited, becoming The British Motor Corporation Limited, with Leonard Lord in charge. William Morris was first chairman but soon retired. Lord, who had stormed out of Morris declaring he would &quot;take Cowley apart brick by brick&quot;, ensured Austin was the dominant partner and its (more recently designed OHV) engines were adopted for most of the cars. Various models followed the Morris policy and became badge-engineered versions of each other.

====Austin-Healey====
In 1952 Austin made a deal with Donald Healey leading to a new marque, Austin-Healey, and a range of sports cars.

===1959–1969: Era of revolution===
With the threat to fuel supplies resulting from the 1956 Suez Crisis, Lord asked Alec Issigonis, who had been with Morris from 1936 to 1952, to design a small car; the result was the revolutionary Mini, launched in 1959. The Austin version was initially called the Austin Seven, but Morris&#x27; Mini Minor name caught the public imagination and the Morris version outsold its Austin twin, so the Austin&#x27;s name was changed to Mini to follow suit. In 1970, British Leyland dropped the separate Austin and Morris branding of the Mini, and it was subsequently simply &quot;Mini&quot;, under the Austin Morris division of BLMC.

The principle of a transverse engine with gearbox in the sump and driving the front wheels was applied to larger cars, beginning with the 1100 of 1963, (although the Morris-badged version was launched 13 months earlier than the Austin, in August 1962), the 1800 of 1964 and the Maxi of 1969. This meant that BMC had spent 10 years developing a new range of front-drive, transverse-engined models, while most competitors had only just started to make such changes.

The big exception to this was the Austin 3-litre. Launched in 1968, it was a rear-wheel drive large car, but it shared the central section of the 1800. It was a sales disaster, with fewer than 10,000 examples being made.

BMC was the first British manufacturer to move into front-wheel drive so comprehensively. Ford did not launch its first front-drive model until 1976 (in Britain), Ford-Germany in 1962 with the Taunus 12M(P4), while Vauxhall&#x27;s first front-drive model was launched in 1979 and Chrysler UK&#x27;s first such car was launched in 1975. Front-wheel drive was popular elsewhere in Europe, however, with Renault, Citroen and Simca all using the system at the same time or before BMC. East Germany&#x27;s Trabant used the system from 1958.

In September 1965 BMC completed the purchase of its major supplier, Pressed Steel. Twelve months later it completed the purchase of Jaguar and in December 1966 changed its name from BMC to BMH, British Motor Holdings Limited. In early 1968 under government pressure BMH merged with Leyland Motors Limited and Austin became a part of the large British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC) combine.
===1970–1979: Era of turbulence===
One of Austin&#x27;s new models of this era was the 1973 Allegro, successor to the 1100/1300 ranges. It was criticised for its bulbous styling which earned it the nickname &quot;Flying pig&quot; as well as the doubtful build quality and indifferent reliability. It was still a strong seller in Britain, although not as successful as its predecessor.

The wedge-shaped 18/22 series was launched as an Austin, a Morris and a more upmarket Wolseley in 1975. But within six months, it was rechristened the Princess and wore none of the previous marque badges, becoming a marque in its own right, under the Austin Morris division of British Leyland that had been virtually nationalised in 1975.

It was upgraded at the end of 1981 to become the Austin Ambassador (and gaining a hatchback) but by that time there was little that could be done to disguise the age of the design, and it was too late to make much of an impact on sales.

By the end of the 1970s, the future of Austin and the rest of British Leyland (now known as BL) was looking bleak.

===1980–1989: Austin Rover era===


The Austin Metro, launched in October 1980, was heralded as the saviour of Austin Motor Company and the whole BL combine. Twenty-one years after the launch of the Mini, it gave BL a much-needed modern supermini to compete with the recently launched likes of the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Nova, VW Polo and Renault 5. It was an instant hit with buyers and was one of the most popular British cars of the 1980s. It was intended as a replacement for the Mini but the Mini went on to outlast it. It was facelifted in October 1984 and gained a 5-door version.

In 1982, most of the car division of the by now somewhat shrunken British Leyland (BL) company was rebranded as the Austin Rover Group, with Austin acting as the &quot;budget&quot; and mainstream brand to Rover&#x27;s more luxurious models. The MG badge was revived for sporty versions of the Austin models, of which the MG Metro 1300 was the first. The Morris and Triumph brands were axed in 1984.

Austin revitalised its entry into the small family-car market in March 1983 with the launch of its all-new Maestro, a spacious five-door hatchback that replaced the elderly Allegro and Maxi and was popular in the early years of its production life, although sales had started to dip dramatically by the end of the decade.

April 1984 saw the introduction of the Maestro-derived Montego saloon, successor to the Morris Ital. The new car received praise for its interior space and comfort as well as its handling, but early build-quality problems took time to overcome. The spacious estate version, launched six months later, was one of the most popular load carriers in Britain for several years after its launch.

In 1986, Austin Rover&#x27;s holding company BL plc became Rover Group plc and was privatised by selling it to British Aerospace (BAe) in 1988.

Plans to replace the Metro with a radical new model, based on the ECV3 research vehicle and aiming for 100 mpg, led to the Austin AR6 of 1984–86, with several prototypes tested and production expected to start before the end of the decade. The desire to lose the Austin name and take Rover &quot;upmarket&quot; led to this project&#x27;s demise in early 1987.

In 1988, the Austin badge was phased out and Austin Rover became the Rover Group from the following year. The Austin cars continued to be manufactured, although they ceased to be Austins. They became &quot;marque-less&quot; in their home market with bonnet badges the same shape as the Rover longship badge but without &quot;Rover&quot; written on them. Instead any badging just showed the model of the car: a Montego of this era, for instance, would have a grille badge simply saying &quot;Montego&quot;, while the rear badges just said &quot;Montego&quot; and the engine size/trim level. A revamped Metro was launched in May 1990 and got the new K-series engine. It then became the Rover Metro.

Despite sales of both the Maestro and Montego being in decline by 1990, these ranges continued in production until 1994 and never wore a Rover badge on their bonnets in Britain. They were, however, sometimes referred to as &quot;Rovers&quot; in the press and elsewhere. Their place in the Rover range was gradually filled by a new generation of Rover models.

===Revival===

The rights to the Austin name passed to British Aerospace and then to BMW when each bought the Rover Group. The rights were subsequently sold to MG Rover, created when BMW sold the business. Following MG Rover&#x27;s collapse and sale, Nanjing Automobile Group owned the Austin name and Austin&#x27;s historic assembly plant in Longbridge. At the Nanjing International Exhibition in May 2006, Nanjing announced it might use the Austin name on some of the revived MG Rover models, at least in the Chinese market. Nanjing Automobile Group itself later merged with SAIC Motor. 

In 2012, a new &quot;Austin Motor Company&quot; was registered by former Longbridge worker Steve Morgan. Morgan had no rights to the brand itself and stated that he had no intention to trade, but rather registered the name as an effort to preserve the memory of the company. The company was dissolved in 2014. 

In 2015, the &quot;Austin Motor Company&quot;, alongside the 1930&#x27;s &quot;Flying A&quot; logo was registered by British Engineer John Stubbs, owner of specialist suspension company Black Art Designs. By 2021, a prototype electric vehicle named the Austin Arrow had been revealed and was seeking investors, with a supposed release date around late 2022. The revived Austin Motor Company subsequently revealed the Arrow 2, a two seater version of the Arrow, alongside announcing an electric commercial Austin van to be released approximately 18-24 months after the launch of the Arrow 1 and 2.

By May 2023, a production line had been set up in Rajkot, India. The Austin Arrow subsequently entered production in October 2023.

== Plant ==
Austin started his business in an abandoned print works at Longbridge, Birmingham. Due to its strategic advantages over Morris&#x27;s Cowley plant, Longbridge became British Leyland&#x27;s main factory in the early 1970s. Following the Austin marque&#x27;s discontinuance in 1987, Rover and MG continued to use the plant. The collapse of MG Rover meant it was not used from 2005 until MG production resumed from 2008 until 2016. The plant is currently leased by SAIC as a research and development facility for its MG Motor Subsidiary.

===Commercial vehicles===
For a list see : Austin Commercial Vehicles

* Austin made a range of commercial vehicles from 1913, including car-based vans, taxis, light commercial vehicles and trucks. After the merger with Morris to form BMC in 1952 the Austin name continued to be used, for example the Austin FG, which was previously the Morris FG. The FG was the workhorse that kept Britain running in the 1960s. These Austin FGs and later the Leyland FGs all had petrol or diesel longstroke engines, producing good torque, but very little in the way of speed (40 mph was a good speed out of these vehicles). Leyland were to take over the FG, but before they did, in 1964, the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) commissioned six rolling chassis FGs to be coach-built by a Middlesex company, Palmer Coachbuilders. These six vehicles, registration 660 GYE to 666 GYE, were outdoor broadcast scenery vehicles.

===Aircraft===
During the First World War Austin built aircraft under licence, including the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a, but also produced a number of its own designs. None of these progressed past the prototype stage. They included:
* Austin-Ball A.F.B.1 (fighter)
* Austin A.F.T.3 (fighter)
* Austin Greyhound (fighter)
* Austin Kestrel (two-seat biplane)
* Austin Osprey (fighter)
* Austin Whippet (post-war civil aircraft)

<text>The New Zealand National Party (), shortened to National () or the Nats, is a centre-right New Zealand political party that is the current senior ruling party. It is one of two major parties that dominate contemporary New Zealand politics, alongside its traditional rival, the Labour Party.

National formed in 1936 through amalgamation of conservative and liberal parties, Reform and United respectively, and subsequently became New Zealand&#x27;s second-oldest extant political party. National&#x27;s predecessors had previously formed a coalition against the growing labour movement. National has governed for six periods during the 20th and 21st centuries, and has spent more time in government than any other New Zealand party.

After the 1949 general election, Sidney Holland became the first prime minister from the National Party, and remained in office until 1957. Keith Holyoake succeeded Holland, and was defeated some months later at a general election by the Labour Party in 1957. Holyoake returned to office for a second period from 1960 to 1972. The party&#x27;s platform shifted from moderate economic liberalism to increased emphasis on state interventionism during Robert Muldoon&#x27;s National government from 1975 to 1984. In 1990, Jim Bolger formed another National government, which continued the radical free-market reforms initiated by the preceding Labour government. The party has since advocated free enterprise, reduction of taxes, and limited state regulation. Following the first MMP election in 1996, the National Party governed in a coalition with the populist New Zealand First Party. National Party leader Jenny Shipley became New Zealand&#x27;s first female prime minister in 1997; her government was defeated by a Labour-led coalition in 1999.

The National Party was in government from 2008 to 2017 under John Key and Bill English; it governed with support from the centrist United Future, the classical-liberal ACT Party and the indigenous-rights-based Māori Party. In the 2017 general election, despite leaving government, the party secured 44.4 percent of the vote and won 56 seats, making it the largest caucus at the time in the House of Representatives. It lost this plurality position in the 2020 general election, receiving only 25.58 percent of the vote and 33 seats. National was again unable to form a government following the election and remained the Official Opposition. 

Christopher Luxon has served as the leader of the National Party since 30 November 2021. He led the party to victory in the 2023 general election, winning 38 percent of the party vote and a plurality with 48 seats. Subsequently, since November 2023, Luxon heads a National-led coalition government with the ACT Party and New Zealand First.

==History==
===Formation===

The National Party was formed in May 1936, but its roots go considerably further back. The party came about as the result of a merger between the United Party (known as the Liberal Party until 1927, except for a short period between 1925 and 1927 when it used the name &quot;National Party&quot;) and the Reform Party. The United Party gained its main support from the cities, and drew upon businesses for money and upon middle class electors for votes, while the Reform Party had a rural base and received substantial support from farmers, who then formed a substantial proportion of the population.
Historically, the Liberal and Reform parties had competed against each other; however, between 1931 and 1935, the United–Reform Coalition held power in New Zealand. The coalition went into the 1935 election under the title of the &quot;National Political Federation&quot;, a name adopted to indicate that the grouping intended to represent New Zealanders from all backgrounds (in contrast to the previous situation, where United served city-dwellers and Reform served farmers). However, because of the effects of the Great Depression and a perception that the existing coalition government had handled the situation poorly, the National Political Federation lost heavily in 1935 to the Labour Party, the rise of which had prompted the alliance. The two parties were cut down to 19 seats between them. 

Another factor was a third party, the Democrat Party formed by Albert Davy, a former organiser for the coalition who disapproved of the perceived &quot;socialist&quot; measures that the coalition had introduced. The new party split the conservative vote, and aided Labour&#x27;s victory.
In hopes of countering Labour&#x27;s rise, United and Reform decided to turn their alliance into a single party. This party, the New Zealand National Party, was formed at a meeting held in Wellington on 13 and 14 May 1936. Erstwhile members of the United and Reform parties made up the bulk of the new party. The United Party&#x27;s last leader, George Forbes, Prime Minister from 1930 until 1935, opened the conference; he served as Leader of the Opposition from May until November, when former Reform MP Adam Hamilton, who had been a minister in the coalition government was elected the merged party&#x27;s first leader. He got the top job primarily because of a compromise between Forbes and Reform leader Gordon Coates, neither of whom wished to serve under the other. Hamilton led the party into its first election in 1938. He was unable to counter Labour&#x27;s popular Prime Minister, Michael Joseph Savage effectively. Because of this, perceptions that he remained too much under the control of Coates and his lack of real support from his party colleagues, Hamilton failed to prevent Labour&#x27;s re-election in 1938.
In 1940, former Reform MP Sidney Holland replaced Hamilton. William Polson &quot;acted effectively as Holland&#x27;s deputy&quot;. One former Reform MP Bert Kyle resigned in 1942 in protest at the &quot;autocratic&quot; behaviour of Holland and the new party organisation.

In the 1943 election, National reduced Labour&#x27;s majority from 12 seats to four. In the 1946 election, National made further gains, but Labour was able to cling to a one-seat majority. However, in the 1949 election, thirteen years after the party&#x27;s foundation, National won power after taking eight seats off Labour, and Holland became prime minister.

===First Government (1949–1957)===
Sidney Holland was finance minister as well as prime minister in the new government. In 1949 National had campaigned on &quot;the private ownership of production, distribution and exchange&quot;. Once in power the new Holland Government proved decidedly administratively conservative, retaining, for instance, compulsory unionism and the welfare state set up by the previous Labour government.

In 1951, the Waterfront Dispute broke out, lasting 151 days. The National government stepped into the conflict, acting in opposition to the maritime unions. Holland also used this opportunity to call the 1951 snap election. Campaigning on an anti-communist platform and exploiting the Labour Opposition&#x27;s apparent indecisiveness, National returned with an increased majority, gaining 54 parliamentary seats out of 80.

In the 1954 election, National was elected to a third term, though losing some of its seats. Towards the end of his third term, however, Holland became increasingly ill, and stepped down from the leadership shortly before the general election in 1957. Keith Holyoake, the party&#x27;s long-standing deputy leader, took Holland&#x27;s place. Holyoake, however, had insufficient time to establish himself in the public mind as prime minister, and lost in the election later that year to Labour, then led by Walter Nash.

===Second Government (1960–1972)===
Nash&#x27;s government became very unpopular as Labour acquired a reputation for poor economic management, and much of the public saw its 1958 Budget, known since as the &quot;Black Budget&quot;, as miserly. After only one term in office, Labour suffered defeat at the hands of Holyoake and the National Party in the elections of 1960.

Holyoake&#x27;s government lasted twelve years, the party winning re-election three times (in 1963, 1966, and 1969). However, during this period Social Credit arose, which broke the National/Labour duopoly in parliament, winning former National seats from 1966. Holyoake retired from the premiership and from the party leadership at the beginning of 1972, and his deputy, Jack Marshall, replaced him.

Marshall suffered the same fate as Holyoake. Having succeeded an experienced leader in an election-year, he failed to establish himself in time. Marshall had an added disadvantage; he had to compete against the much more popular and charismatic Labour leader Norman Kirk, and lost the ensuing election. Unpopular policies, including initiating clear felling of parts of the Warawara kauri forest, also needlessly alienated voters.

===Third Government (1975–1984)===
Within two years, the National Party removed Marshall as its parliamentary leader and replaced him with Robert Muldoon, who had previously served as Minister of Finance. An intense contest between Kirk and Muldoon followed. Kirk became ill and died in office (1974); his successor, Bill Rowling, proved no match for Muldoon, and in the 1975 election, National under Muldoon returned comfortably to power.

The Muldoon administration, which favoured interventionist economic policies, arouses mixed opinions amongst the free-market adherents of the modern National. Bill Birch&#x27;s &quot;Think Big&quot; initiatives, designed to invest public money in energy self-sufficiency, stand in contrast to the party&#x27;s views. Muldoon&#x27;s autocratic leadership style became increasingly unpopular with both the public and the party, and together with disgruntlement over economic policy led to an attempted leadership change in 1980. Led by ministers Derek Quigley, Jim McLay, and Jim Bolger, the challenge (dubbed the &quot;colonels&#x27; coup&quot;) against Muldoon aimed to replace him with Brian Talboys, his deputy. However, the plan collapsed as the result of Talboys&#x27; unwillingness, and Muldoon kept his position.
Under Muldoon, National won three consecutive general elections in 1975, 1978 and 1981. However, public dissatisfaction grew, and Muldoon&#x27;s controlling and belligerent style of leadership became less and less appealing. In both the 1978 and 1981 elections, National gained fewer votes than the Labour opposition, but could command a small majority in Parliament because of the then-used First Past the Post electoral system.

Dissent within the National Party continued to grow, however, with rebel National MPs Marilyn Waring and Mike Minogue causing particular concern to the leadership, threatening National&#x27;s thin majority in parliament. When, in 1984, Marilyn Waring refused to support Muldoon&#x27;s policies on visits by nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships, Muldoon called a snap election. Muldoon made the television announcement of this election while visibly inebriated, and some believe that he later regretted the decision to &quot;go to the country&quot;. National lost the election to Labour under David Lange.

===Fourth Government (1990–1999)===
Shortly after this loss, the National Party removed Muldoon from the leadership. Jim McLay, who had replaced Duncan MacIntyre as deputy leader shortly before the election, became the new leader. McLay, an urban liberal with right-wing views on economics, however, failed to restore the party&#x27;s fortunes. In 1986 Jim Bolger took over the leadership with the support of centrists within the party.

In the 1990 election, National defeated Labour in an electoral landslide and formed a new government under Jim Bolger. However, the party lost some support from Muldoon era policy based conservatives when it continued the economic reforms which had ultimately led to the defeat of the previous Labour government—these policies, started by Labour Party Finance Minister Roger Douglas and popularly known as Rogernomics, centred on the privatisation of state assets and on the removal of tariffs and subsidies. These policies alienated traditional Labour supporters, who saw them as a betrayal of the party&#x27;s social service based character, but did not appear to appease the membership base of the non-parliamentary party either, which still had a significant supporter base for the statist intervention style policies of the Muldoon Government.

Many more conservative and centrist National supporters preferred Muldoon&#x27;s more authoritarian and interventionist policies over the free-market liberalism promoted by Douglas. However, the new National Party Finance Minister, Ruth Richardson, strongly supported Rogernomics, believing that Douglas had not gone far enough. Her policies—dubbed &quot;Ruthanasia&quot;— encouraged two MPs to leave the National Party and form the Liberal Party. Richardson&#x27;s views also met with considerable opposition within the National Party Parliamentary Caucus and for a time caused damage to the party&#x27;s membership base.

At the 1993 election, National was narrowly able to retain government owing partly to a slight economic recovery and the opposition being split between three competing parties. National&#x27;s unprecedented eighteen-seat majority had virtually disappeared and the country faced an election night hung parliament for the first time since 1931, with National one seat short of the required 50 seats to govern. Final special votes counted over the following days revealed National had won , allowing it to form a government with the majority of one seat but required the election of a Speaker from the opposition benches (Peter Tapsell of the Labour Party) to hold a working majority in the House. At the same time as the election, however, a referendum took place which established the MMP electoral system for future use in New Zealand general elections as widespread dissatisfaction with the existing political system led to reform. This would have a significant impact on New Zealand politics. Some National Party MPs defected to a new grouping, United New Zealand in mid-1995 whilst other splinter parties emerged. And, as a result of the new electoral mechanics, the New Zealand First party, led by former National MP and former Cabinet minister Winston Peters, held the balance of power after the 1996 election. After a prolonged period of negotiation lasting nearly two months, in which New Zealand First played National and Labour off against each other (both parties negotiated complete coalition agreements), New Zealand First entered into a coalition with National despite the fact many expected Peters to form such a coalition with Labour.

Under the coalition agreement, Peters became Deputy Prime Minister and had the post of Treasurer especially created by the Crown for him. New Zealand First extracted a number of other concessions from National in exchange for its support. The influence of New Zealand First angered many National MPs, particularly Jenny Shipley.
When, in 1997, Shipley toppled Bolger to become National&#x27;s new leader, relations between National and its coalition partner quickly deteriorated. After Shipley sacked Peters from Cabinet in 1998, New Zealand First split into two groups and half the MPs followed Peters out of the coalition but the remainder broke away, establishing themselves as independents or as members of new parties of which none survived the 1999 election. From the latter group National gained enough support to continue in government with additional confidence support of Alamein Kopu a defect Alliance List MP. The visibly damaged National Government managed to survive the parliamentary term, but lost the election to Labour&#x27;s Helen Clark and the Alliance&#x27;s Jim Anderton, who formed a coalition government leaving National in opposition for nine years.

===Opposition (1999–2008)===
Shipley continued to lead the National Party until 2001, when Bill English replaced her. English, however, proved unable to gain traction against Clark, and National suffered its worst-ever electoral defeat in the 2002 election, gaining only 27 of 120 seats. Many hoped that English would succeed in rebuilding the party, given time, but a year later polling showed the party performing only slightly better than in the election. In October 2003 English gave way as leader to Don Brash, a former governor of the Reserve Bank who had joined the National Parliamentary caucus in the 2002 election.

Under Brash, the National Party&#x27;s overall popularity with voters improved markedly. Mostly, however, the party achieved this by &quot;reclaiming&quot; support from electors who voted for other centre-right parties in 2002. National&#x27;s campaigning on race relations, amid claims of preferential treatment of Māori, and amid their opposition to Labour Party policy during the foreshore-and-seabed controversy, generated considerable publicity and much controversy. Strong campaigning on a tax-cuts theme in the lead-up to the 2005 election, together with a consolidation of centre-right support, may have contributed to the National Party&#x27;s winning 48 out of 121 seats in Parliament. National, however, remained the second-largest party in Parliament (marginally behind Labour, which gained 50 seats), and had fewer options for forming a coalition government. With the formation of a new Labour-dominated Government, National remained the major Opposition party. Before the leadership of John Key, the National Party had made renewed efforts to attract social conservative voters, through adoption of anti-abortion and anti-same-sex marriage policies.

In the 2005 general election run up, it was revealed that the Exclusive Brethren, a conservative Christian group, had distributed attack pamphlets critical of the Labour Party and praising of National to letterboxes throughout New Zealand. Labour insisted that National had close ties to and prior knowledge of these attacks, which was repeatedly denied by National. It was later admitted by the leader Don Brash that he indeed did have knowledge of the plan, a statement that was contradicted by MP Gerry Brownlee who subsequently denied the National party had any foreknowledge.

After the 2005 election defeat Don Brash&#x27;s leadership of National came under scrutiny from the media, and political watchers speculated on the prospect of a leadership-challenge before the next general election due in 2008. Brash resigned on 23 November 2006, immediately before the release of Nicky Hager&#x27;s book &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;, which contained damaging revelations obtained from private emails. John Key became the leader of the National caucus on 27 November 2006. Key fostered a more &quot;centrist&quot; image, discussing issues such as child poverty.

===Fifth Government (2008–2017)===
On 8 November 2008, the National Party won 58 seats in the general election. The Labour Party, which had spent three terms in power, conceded the election and Prime Minister Helen Clark stepped down. National formed a minority government under John Key with confidence-and-supply support from the ACT Party (5 seats), the Māori Party (5 seats) and United Future (1 seat). On 19 November the Governor-General swore in the new National-led government. In Key&#x27;s first Cabinet he gave the ACT Party&#x27;s Rodney Hide and Heather Roy ministerial portfolios outside Cabinet, and the Māori Party&#x27;s Tāriana Turia and Pita Sharples the same. United Future leader Peter Dunne retained his ministerial post outside Cabinet which he had held within the immediately preceding Labour Government.

National came to power in the continuing wake of a financial crisis. In response to New Zealand&#x27;s rising debt, Finance Minister Bill English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority for the first term. The government also cut taxes on all income; the top personal tax rate was lowered from 39% to 38% and then 33% in 2010.
At the 26 November 2011 general election, National gained 47.31% of the party vote, the highest percentage gained by any political party since MMP was introduced, helped by a lower voter turnout and the misfortunes of its traditional support parties. A reduced wasted vote enabled the party to gain 59 seats in Parliament, one more than in 2008. National re-entered confidence-and-supply agreements with ACT (one seat) and United Future (one seat) on 5 December 2011, enabling it to form a minority government with the support of 61 seats in the new 121-seat Parliament. National also re-entered a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Māori Party on 11 December 2011 for extra insurance, despite the parties differing on National&#x27;s contentious plans to partially sell (or &quot;extend the mixed ownership model to&quot;) four state-owned enterprises. This nearly led to a cancellation of the agreement in February 2012 over Treaty of Waitangi obligations for the mixed ownership companies, and again in July 2012 over water rights.

The government also introduced the &quot;mixed ownership model&quot; plan, in which the Government planned to reduce its share in Genesis Energy, Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power and Solid Energy from 100% to 51% and Air New Zealand from 74% to 51%, and sell off the remainder. The plans to sell down Solid Energy were later axed due to the company&#x27;s poor financial position. A citizens-initiated referendum on the sell-downs returned a 67.3% vote in opposition (on a turnout of 45.1%).

The National Government won a third term at the 2014 general election. The National Party won 47.04% of the party vote, and increased its seats to 60. National resumed its confidence and supply agreements with ACT and United Future. The National government extended free general practitioner visits to children under 13 as part of their 2014 election package, as well as extending paid parental leave by two weeks to 16 weeks. The National parliamentary caucus was split on the issue of same-sex marriage in 2014.

Throughout his second and third terms, Key campaigned heavily in favour of free-trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

After serving Prime Minister for eight years, Key announced his resignation as the party leader on 5 December 2016. He stepped down as Prime Minister on 12 December. Key&#x27;s deputy Bill English was acclaimed as the party&#x27;s new leader on 12 December 2016 after Health Minister Jonathan Coleman and Minister of Police Judith Collins withdrew from the leadership election.

===Opposition (2017–2023)===
In the 2017 general election, National&#x27;s share of the party vote dropped to 44.4%. It lost four seats, dropping to 56, but remained the largest party in Parliament. Two of the National government&#x27;s three support parties lost representation in parliament. New Zealand First, led by Winston Peters, held the balance of power, and formed a coalition with Labour, who also gained Green Party support, marking an end to the 9-year National government. English announced his intention to stay on as party leader until the 2020 general election but subsequently resigned. On 27 February 2018, English was succeeded by Simon Bridges.

Following the Christchurch Mosque shootings, the party removed content from their website which indicated opposition to the UN Migration Compact; a position also espoused by the terrorist in his manifesto. On 2 July 2020, however, the party&#x27;s new leader Todd Muller confirmed in response to a question from a journalist that the party was still opposed to the pact, although it was not an issue he was focused on.

On 22 May 2020, following poor poll results for the party during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, the National Party held an emergency caucus meeting and voted to oust both leader Simon Bridges and deputy leader Paula Bennett, replacing them with Todd Muller and Nikki Kaye, respectively. Less than two months later, Muller resigned citing that his position had &quot;become untenable from a health perspective&quot;. This came after a series of gaffes and scandals surrounding Muller and the National caucus during his tenure, triggering the second leadership election in as many months. He was succeeded by Judith Collins. Kaye, who served as interim leader during the hours between Muller&#x27;s resignation and Collins&#x27;s election, was succeeded by Gerry Brownlee. Collins led the party through the 2020 election, but was unable to recoup polling losses seen by the party throughout 2020 in time for the election, leading to the party losing 23 seats and suffering the second worst defeat in its history. Brownlee, who was the party campaign manager, lost his electorate seat, returning as an MP via the party list and resigning as deputy leader two weeks later; he was replaced by Shane Reti.

On 1 February 2021, Collins announced that the National Party would contest the Māori electorates at the 2023 New Zealand general election. Her successor Christopher Luxon confirmed they would still be contesting the seats under his leadership.

On 24 November 2021, Collins announced that Bridges was being demoted and stripped of his portfolios, in what was seen by many inside and outside the caucus (including National MP and Bridges&#x27; brother in-law Simon O&#x27;Connor) as an act of political revenge. O&#x27;Connor later announced that he was resigning his portfolios in protest, and demanded Collins&#x27; own resignation. Collins was removed as leader in an emergency caucus meeting the following morning, with Reti becoming interim leader. Christopher Luxon was elected unopposed, with Nicola Willis as his deputy, after Simon Bridges withdrew his candidacy.

===Sixth Government (2023–present)===

During the 2023 general election held on 14 October, National under the leadership of Christopher Luxon defeated the incumbent Labour Party. National won 38.08% of the popular vote and gained 48 seats. National&#x27;s traditional coalition partner ACT won 11 seats, leaving a prospective National–ACT coalition just short of a majority with 59 seats. National formed a majority government with ACT and New Zealand First, the first three-party coalition under MMP.

==Ideology and factions==

The New Zealand National Party has been characterised as a &quot;broad church&quot;, encompassing both conservative and liberal tendencies, and outlying populist and libertarian tendencies. All factions tend to be in tension, although the conservative tendency frequently prevails. The broad liberal tendency is expressed by both social liberals and the classical liberals, with the latter supporting economic liberalism. The early National Party was united in its anti-socialism, in opposition to the Labour Party.

The party&#x27;s principles include &quot;loyalty to our country, its democratic principles and our Sovereign as Head of State; recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi as the founding document of New Zealand; national and personal security; equal citizenship and equal opportunity; individual freedom and choice; personal responsibility; competitive enterprise and rewards for achievement; limited government; strong families and caring communities; sustainable development of our environment.&quot; National supports a limited welfare state but says that work, merit, innovation and personal initiative must be encouraged to reduce unemployment and boost economic growth. In a 1959 speech, party leader and Prime Minister Keith Holyoake encapsulated the conservative and liberal principles of the National Party:
We believe in the maximum degree of personal freedom and the maximum degree of individual choice for our people. We believe in the least interference necessary with individual rights, and the least possible degree of state interference.

Historically, National supported a higher degree of state intervention than it has in recent decades. The First, Second and Third National governments (1950s–1980s) generally sought to preserve the economic and social stability of New Zealand, mainly keeping intact the high degree of protectionism and the strong welfare state built up by the First Labour Government. The last major interventionist policy was Prime Minister Robert Muldoon&#x27;s massive infrastructure projects designed to ensure New Zealand&#x27;s energy independence after the 1973 oil shock, Think Big. In contrast, the Fourth National Government (1990–1999) mostly carried on the sweeping free-market reforms of the Fourth Labour Government known as Rogernomics (after Labour&#x27;s finance minister Sir Roger Douglas). The corporatisation and sale of numerous state-owned enterprises, the abolition of collective bargaining and major government spending cuts were introduced under the Fourth National Government, policies that were popularly known as Ruthanasia (National&#x27;s finance minister at the time was Ruth Richardson). The Fifth National Government (2008–2017) took a relatively centrist position.

The party has mixed views on abortion, with some MPs being against while others for. In a conscience vote, National Party MPs voted largely against the Abortion Legislation Act 2020.

===Voter base===
The National Party&#x27;s core base has traditionally comprised European New Zealanders (Pākehā), social conservatives and rural voters, although it targets other groups too. National has retained a reputation for showing more favour to farmers and to business than Labour; the party provides for its support through incentives for farmers.

==Organisation==

In the 1930s National first emulated and then outstripped Labour in building a large low-fee membership, with wide grassroots support. By the mid-1970s it claimed to have around 200,000 members. Since 1981 National (as well as the Labour Party) has suffered a steady decline in membership. By the early 2000s party membership was below 30,000.

National features both regional and electorate-level organisational structures. National traditionally had a strongly decentralised organisation, designed to allow electorates and the five regions to appeal to the unique voter base in their area. However, in light of the 2002 election result, in which the party suffered a significant loss of its support base, a review of the party organisation resulted in decisions to weaken the regional structure and to implement a more centralised structure. The restructuring was ostensibly planned to make the party organisation more &quot;appropriate&quot; for the mixed-member proportional electoral system, where votes are cast for a countrywide party list.

Currently, the affairs of the party are centrally governed by a Board of Directors, comprising the party leader, one caucus representative, the party&#x27;s general manager and seven elected members. The board elects a party president from within its members. An Annual Conference determines party policy, and elects members to the Board of Directors. The party is subdivided into Electorate Committees; each committee sends six delegates to Annual Conference, including a chair and any MPs from within the electorate.

The leader of the National Party ( Christopher Luxon), elected by the party&#x27;s current sitting MPs, acts as a spokesperson for National and is responsible for managing the party&#x27;s business within parliament. The president ( Sylvia Wood, elected to the role in August 2022) heads the administration outside of parliament.

Within National there are a number of organised groups of members, called Special Interest Groups, that share a particular belief, interest or cause. Other groups are also involved in the party&#x27;s policy reviews. For instance, the Bluegreens are a group within National who help formulate environmental policy. The party&#x27;s youth wing, the Young Nationals (commonly known as the &quot;Young Nats&quot;), has provided much political impetus as a ginger group. Often the more social-liberal views of the Young Nats have been at odds with those in the senior party.

National is affiliated to—and plays a leading part in—the International Democracy Union (IDU) and the Asia Pacific Democrat Union (APDU). Former National Prime Minister John Key was the chairman of the IDU from 2014 to 2018.

<text>The Seventh Crusade (1248–1254) was the first of the two Crusades led by Louis IX of France. Also known as the Crusade of Louis IX to the Holy Land, it aimed to reclaim the Holy Land by attacking Egypt, the main seat of Muslim power in the Near East. The Crusade was conducted in response to setbacks in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, beginning with the loss of the Holy City in 1244, and was preached by Innocent IV in conjunction with a crusade against emperor Frederick II, Baltic rebellions and Mongol incursions. After initial success, the crusade ended in defeat, with most of the army – including the king – captured by the Muslims.

Following his release, Louis stayed in the Holy Land for four years, doing what he could towards the re-establishment of the kingdom. The struggle between the papacy and Holy Roman Empire paralyzed Europe, with few answering Louis&#x27; calls for help following his capture and ransoming. The one answer was the Shepherds’ Crusade, started to rescue the king and meeting with disaster. In 1254, Louis returned to France having concluded some important treaties. The second of Louis&#x27; Crusades was his equally unsuccessful 1270 expedition to Tunis, the Eighth Crusade, where he died of dysentery shortly after the campaign landed.

==Background==
In the years that followed the Barons&#x27; Crusade, the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Ayyubid dynasty were both beset by internal strife that ultimately proved disastrous for both. The loss of Jerusalem and defeat at Gaza in 1244 ultimately marked the collapse of Christian military power in the Holy Land and led to the rise of the Mamluk sultanate. It is against this backdrop that Louis IX of France and pope Innocent IV began the Seventh Crusade to recover Jerusalem.

===Jerusalem from 1241 to 1244===
The Barons&#x27; Crusade ended in 1241 with the Kingdom of Jerusalem at its largest since 1187 after the negotiations made by Theobald I of Navarre. When Richard of Cornwall completed his negotiations with the Muslims, he then secured the support of the influential family of John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II had been crowned as king in March 1229, and the Ibelins agreed to accept him as regent as long as Simon de Montfort were appointed &quot;bailli&quot; until Conrad II of Jerusalem was of age and could receive the kingdom. When Richard returned home on 3 May 1241, the kingdom, still based at Acre, seemed to be restored, but suffered from rejection of Frederick and general lack of any central authority.

While waiting for Frederick&#x27;s answer to Richard&#x27;s proposal, the barons kept the claim of Alice of Champagne in reserve. Richard Filangieri remained in Tyre while the various barons returned to their fiefs in Syria and Cyprus, and Philip of Montfort, lord of Tyre, remained in Acre. The Templars, unsatisfied with the treaty with Egypt, besieged the Hospitallers at Acre and Hebron in 1241, who, under grand master Pierre de Vieille-Brioude, had supported the treaty. An-Nasir Dā&#x27;ūd, a Hospitaller ally, responded by attacking Christian pilgrims and merchants. Taking revenge, the Templars sacked Nablus on 30 October 1242, burning the mosque and killing the native Christians. The Muslims were not unreasonable in their belief that peace with the Franks was impossible.

Some Hospitallers joined with Filangieri in a plot to turn Acre over to the imperialists. The Templars, Philip of Montfort, the Genoese and Venetians put an end to the coup attempt. The main body of Hospitallers, conducting military action at al-Marqab against Aleppo, returned and de Vieille-Brioude disavowed the plot. The city remained under Ibelin control, while Filangieri was recalled to Italy. On 5 June 1243, the &quot;Haute Cour&quot; ruled that Alice and her current husband Ralph of Nesle were entitled to rule Jerusalem as regents for Conrad II until he could come to the kingdom. Tyre remained occupied by Richard&#x27;s brother Lothair Filangieri. When Richard was forced back to the harbor by a storm, fell into the hands of the barons and Lothair had to surrender the citadel at Tyre on 10 July 1243 to save him. Balian of Ibelin was appointed royal custodian of Tyre and the lordship was eventually assigned to Philip of Montfort. Jerusalem was essentially a feudal republic administered by the most powerful barons.

After the recovery of Jerusalem and much of Galilee, the kingdom was unable to sufficiently reorganize to counter the threats from the Ayyubids and Mongols. The quarrels between imperialist followers of Frederick II and the Ibelins, between the Templars and Hospitallers, and Acre versus Tyre left the kingdom almost defenseless. The defeat of the imperialists left the Templars in a strong position, negotiating a treaty in 1243 with a coalition of the rulers of Homs, Kerak, and Damascus against Egypt that eased tensions and restored Temple Mount to the order. Grand master Armand de Périgord triumphantly reported the return of the Templars to their original home to the pope. While the treaty promised to enhance Frankish security in Syria, but would prove toothless in light of the impending onslaught.

===The Ayyubids and the loss of Jerusalem===
Since the death of the sultan al-Kamil in 1238, the political situation in Egypt and the Levant was chaotic, stoked by rivalries between his sons. In early 1240, while making ready to invade Egypt, as-Salih Ayyub, the eldest son, was informed that his half-brother Al-Adil II, then sultan, was being held prisoner by his own soldiers. He was invited to come at once and assume the sultanate. In June 1240, he made a triumphal entry into Cairo and assumed rule of the dynasty. Once installed in Cairo, as-Salih was far from secure, as the dynasty and associated Kurdish clans had divided loyalties. Within Egypt, a powerful faction of emirs were conspiring to depose him and replace him with his uncle, as-Salih Ismail, who had regained control of Damascus. As-Salih took refuge in the Cairo citadel, no longer trusting even the once-loyal emirs who had brought him to power. Kipchak mercenaries became available following the Mongol invasion in central Asia and soon formed the core of his army known as Mamluks. Before the end of the Seventh Crusade, the Mamluks would eventually overthrow the Ayyubid dynasty and take power on their own.

Beginning in 1240, a Central Asian tribe known as the Khwarezmians attacked the territories of Aleppo and would within four years decimate the Levant. Lacking strong leadership since the death of Jalal al-Din Mangburni, they were essentially freebooters operating as a mercenary band. They defeated the Aleppine army of al-Mu&#x27;azzam Tūrān-shāh, son of Saladin, near B&#x27;zaah on 11 November 1240, before taking Manbij. The emir of Homs, al-Mansur Ibrahim newly installed after the death of his father al-Mujahid, brought forces to bear, eventually defeating the Khwarezmians near Edessa on 6 January 1241, sharing the spoils with Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;, emir of Damascus. The army of Aleppo then combined with a Seljuk force led by Kaykhusraw II to defeat an Ayyubid army led by as-Salih&#x27;s son and deputy al-Muazzam Turanshah at Amida. The Khwarezmians then allied with al-Muzaffar Ghazi to mount a counterattack, and were defeated at al-Majdal in August 1242. Kaykhusraw II was then dealt a crushing defeat by the Mongols at the Battle of Köse Dağ in June 1243, threatening the whole of Mesopotamia.

At as-Salih&#x27;s invitation, the Khwarezmian army advanced through Syria and Palestine and, in the Siege of Jerusalem of 15 July 1244, destroyed the Holy City. The city&#x27;s citadel, the Tower of David, surrendered on 23 August 1244, and the Christian population of the city was expelled or massacred. Later that year as-Salih, again allied to the Khwarezmians, confronted as-Salih Ismail, now allied with the Crusaders, at Gaza in the Battle of La Forbie, marking the collapse of Christian power in the Holy Land. In 1245, as-Salih captured Damascus, and was awarded the title of sultan by the caliph al-Musta&#x27;sim in Baghdad. In 1246, he assessed that his Khwarezmian allies were dangerously uncontrollable, so he turned on them and defeated them near Homs, killing their leaders and dispersing the remnants throughout Syria and Palestine. Three years later when the Crusade began, as-Salih was away fighting his uncle in Syria and quickly returned to Egypt where he died on 22 November 1249.

===The military orders===
The treaty of 1243 with the Ayyubids did not keep the peace for long, but the military orders in the kingdom united to fight at Hirbiya in what is sometimes called the Battle of La Forbie, sometimes known as the Battle of Gaza, from 17 to 18 October 1244. Here the Crusaders, led by Walter IV of Brienne, and a Damascene army met the Egyptian and Khwarezmian armies. In what was to be the final major battle between the Franks and Muslims, 5000 Crusaders died and 800 were taken prisoner. Among the dead were Armand de Périgord, Grand Master of the Temple, and Peter II of Sargines, archbishop of Tyre. Taken prisoner were Guillaume de Chateauneuf, Grand Master of the Hospitaller, and the commander Walter IV of Brienne. Only 33 Templars, 27 Hospitallers, and three Teutonic Knights survived, escaping to Ascalon along with Philip of Montfort and Latin patriarch Robert of Nantes. Jean de Ronay, in an acting capacity for the Hospitallers, and Guillaume de Sonnac, Armand&#x27;s successor, would go on the support the Seventh Crusade. Both arrived in the Holy Land after the 1244 defeats. Hugues de Revel, lord of Krak des Chevaliers from 1243 to 1248, would become de Chateauneuf&#x27;s permanent successor in 1258. 

===Louis IX of France===
Louis IX was born on 25 April 1214, the son of Louis VIII of France and Blanche of Castile. Louis was 12 years old when his father died in November 1226, just three years after he had ascended to the throne. He was crowned king within the month and his mother ruled France as regent during his minority, training him to be a great leader and a good Christian. Blanche dealt with the opposition of rebellious vassals and secured a Capetian success in the 20-year Albigensian Crusade in 1229.

The first major crisis faced by Louis was the Saintonge War of 1242–1243, pitting Capetian forces supportive of Louis&#x27; brother Alphonse of Poitiers against Henry III of England and his continental allies. John II of Soissons supported Louis and would later join his Crusade. Henry hoped to regain Angevin land lost during the reign of his father. The French decisively defeated the English at the Battle of Taillebourg in July 1242, marking the last major conflict between the two until the Gascon War.

In the Holy Land, the Sixth Crusade and the Barons&#x27; Crusade had returned the kingdom to its largest size since its loss at Hattin in 1187. That changed with the Siege of Jerusalem in 1244, leading to its sack which rendered the Holy City a pile of ruins unusable for both Christians and Muslims. The sack of the Jerusalem and ensuing massacre encouraged Louis IX to organize the first of his Crusades. Nevertheless, the recent fall of Jerusalem clarified to many European Christians, who had seen the city change hands between Christians and Muslims numerous times in the past two centuries, that it was a lost cause. This change of heart can be gleaned from the popular enthusiasm that had largely petered out despite the papal calls for a new crusade. Besides, almost all Western European states were embroiled in local conflicts or larger wars between them keeping their leaders from embarking on a foreign yet extremely risky and iffy endeavour. 

At the end of 1244, Louis was stricken with a severe malarial infection. Near death, he vowed that if he recovered he would set out for a Crusade. His life was spared, and as soon as his health permitted him, he took the cross and immediately began preparations. The Crusade that Louis would lead has been described as &quot;perhaps the only expedition since the days of Godfrey of Bouillon that deserved the name of a Holy War.&quot; He had already been much distressed by the plight of John of Brienne during the siege of Constantinople of 1235, and dispatched a mission led by the Dominican André de Longjumeau to acquire Holy relics, including the Crown of Thorns, parts of the True Cross, the Holy Lance, and the Holy Sponge. The Sainte Chapelle in Paris was begun by Louis whose chapel would hold and display his sacred objects in a large reliquary. (The reliquary and associated vessels were melted down during the French Revolution. The crown is currently in the Louvre, saved from the 2019 fire at Notre-Dame de Paris.) Papal blessing for the Crusade would come later.
===Innocent IV===
Innocent IV became pope on 25 June 1243, facing both religious and political crusades. At that time, the papacy was engaged in a feud with emperor Frederick II, then under excommunication. Frederick was at first pleased with his election, but it was soon clear that Innocent intended to carry on his predecessors&#x27; traditions. Fearing a plan to kidnap him, Innocent IV left Rome in March 1244, pursued by the emperor&#x27;s cavalry, travelling to Lyons. He wrote to Louis IX, asking for asylum, which was cautiously refused. In exile, the pope presided over First Council of Lyon in 1245. The council directed a new Crusade under the command of Louis IX, who had already taken the cross, with the objective of reconquering the Holy Land. With Rome under siege by Frederick, that year the pope also issued his &quot;Ad Apostolicae Dignitatis Apicem&quot;, formally renewing the sentence of excommunication on the emperor, and declared him deposed from the imperial throne and that of Naples.

From Gregory IX, Innocent IV inherited a Prussian Crusade targeting the Orthodox Russians. Innocent was also the first to seriously face the challenge posed by the Mongol incursion into Europe in the course of 1241. After Lyons, Innocent sent envoys to the Mongols (see below) who also negotiated with Russian princes over church union with Rome. As both Daniel Romanovich of Galicia-Volhynia and Yaroslav II, grand prince of Vladimir, seemed to respond positively, the pope abandoned the idea of an alliance with the Mongols and aimed instead to form a grand alliance with the Russians to counter the Mongol threat. In January 1248, Innocent joined with Heinrich von Hohenlohe, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, in warning Daniel and Yaroslav&#x27;s son Alexander Nevsky of impending Mongol attacks on Christianity and to unite under papal protection in the defense against the invaders. Both Russian princes accepted the proposal. Eventually, all eastern European rulers still not under Mongol domination had now joined Innocent&#x27;s alliance, however short-lived. In September 1243, he issued the bull &quot;Qui iustis causis&quot;, authorizing further Northern Crusades.

Innocent IV was determined in his goal of the destruction of Frederick II. The attempts undertaken by Louis IX to bring about peace were of no avail. In 1249 the pope ordered a crusade to be preached against Frederick II, and after the emperor&#x27;s death in December 1250, he continued the struggle against Conrad IV of Germany and his half-brother Manfred of Sicily with unrelenting severity. The crown of Sicily had devolved upon the Holy See after the deposition of Frederick II, and Innocent first offered it to Richard of Cornwall and Edmund Crouchback, brother and son of Henry III of England. After the death of Conrad IV in May 1254, the pope finally recognized the hereditary claims of Conrad&#x27;s two-year-old son Conradin. Manfred also submitted, but soon revolted and defeated the papal troops at the Battle of Foggia on 2 December 1254. Innocent IV died a few days later.

===Negotiations with the Mongols===

In 1245, Innocent IV supplemented efforts in the Holy Land and Baltics by sending two embassies to Mongolia to the court of the Great Khan, beginning the attempts at a Franco-Mongol alliance. The first was led by the Franciscan John of Plano Carpini, traveling across Russia and Central Asia to Karakorum. In August 1246, he witnessed a Kuriltayi that elevated Güyük Khan to power. Güyük, after receiving the pope&#x27;s request for him to accept Christianity, demanded that the pope acknowledge his suzerainty and to come to pay him homage. Upon his return at the end of 1247, John reported to Rome that the Mongols were only out for conquest. His second embassy was the Dominican Ascelin of Lombardy who travelled to meet the Mongol general Baiju Noyan at Tabriz in May 1247. Baiju and Ascelin discussed an alliance against the Ayyubids. He planned to attack Baghdad, and it would suit him to have the Syrians distracted by a crusade of the Franks. He sent his envoys, Aïbeg and Serkis, with Ascelin to Rome causing the hopes of the West rise again. In November 1248, they returned to Baiju with no further action on the proposed alliance.
== Preparations ==
In 1244, the peace of the previous decade was quickly swept away, negating prospects that appeared brighter than at any time since the late 12th century. Most of the Frankish gains in southern Palestine were lost, with Ascalon falling in 1247. The disaster in the East threw the survival of the Kingdom of Jerusalem into doubt. Pleas for help were dispatched to the West. Louis IX of France had taken the cross after his near-fatal illness, and it remained unclear whether he received the cross for its mystical healing properties, a belief widely held by contemporaries, or as a token of gratitude after hovering between life and death. The driving motive behind the French king&#x27;s commitment lay in his own personality, piety and ambition. Despite apparently strong initial opposition from his mother and other members of his entourage, Louis stuck to his decision, repeating his vow when he recovered and persuading his brothers and those in his court to follow suit.

===Recruiting===
Louis had taken the cross from William of Auvergne, bishop of Paris, without prior papal authorization. Beside his ecclesiastical role, William was an expert on Arabic affairs and may have doubted the wisdom of the king&#x27;s decision. Regardless of the maternal, episcopal and political opposition, Louis pressed ahead with the idea that his Crusade was a personal and spiritual rite of passage.

Within two months, the papal bull was issued, with preaching of the Crusade authorized. Odo of Châteauroux, cardinal-bishop of Frascati, began preaching in France, legitimizing regional preachers and collecting funds. Odo had been deeply involved in the crusading movement for decades, having personally preached the cross against the Albigensian heretics in 1226, against the Mongols around 1240, and, later, against the Muslims in the Holy Land through Louis&#x27; second Crusade. As cardinal he masterminded the propaganda campaign for Louis’ first Crusade and accompanied the king to the East as papal legate. While the plight of the Holy Land and French national pride was stressed in their pleas, preachers had also to spell out how the faithful could contribute, in person, with money or through prayer.

The preaching campaign of 1245–1248 did not go smoothly. Odo had to balance the call to the Holy Land with the war against Frederick II. The French government deliberately associated Louis&#x27; Crusade with the suppression of the rebellion at the Siege of Montségur in 1244, the final carryover from the Albigensian Crusade. The rebels were induced to take the cross as a symbol of loyalty to the Capetians. Other competing crusades included the Prussian Crusade, a Livonian Crusade against the Curonians, and a proposed crusade to protect Constantinople from Nicaea.

Recruitment in the French court was slow to develop. Louis’ youngest brother Alphonse of Poitiers, taking the cross in 1245, had his army ready only in the spring of 1249. In northern France, men were still joining up into 1250, and the other brothers, Charles I of Anjou and Robert I of Artois, also joined. Recruitment was concentrated in the kingdom of France, Burgundy, Lorraine and the Low Countries between the Meuse and the Rhine. In 1248, Louis was unsuccessful in convincing Haakon IV of Norway to join him as commander of the Crusader fleet. Apart from the king and his brothers, there were loyalists including crusading veterans Hugh IV of Burgundy, Peter Maulcerc, and his vassal Raoul de Soissons, with rebels including Raymond VII of Toulouse and his father-in-law Hugh X of Lusignan. Recruits came from across the kingdom, from Flanders and Brittany to Poitou, the Bourbonnais and Languedoc. From Brittany, it appears that practically all the major landowners participated. Theobald of Champagne declined to join, but the Champenois provided 1,000 men. Early in 1247, Crusaders at Châteaudun had formed a &quot;confratria&quot; to purchase materials and ships, providing funding for those who went to fight, and to collect donations by non-&quot;crucesignati.&quot; Indulgences were granted and often misused. By 1246, after numerous incidents, &quot;crucesignati&quot; were no longer permitted to avoid lawsuits involving fiefs and pledges. Many were indulging in theft, murder and rape, causing the pope to order bishops not to protect such miscreants, crusade privileges notwithstanding.

===English participation===
Henry III of England, defeated by Louis IX in 1242 at Taillebourg, did not want to get involved in a French war. He denied entry to Galeran, Bishop of Beirut, had sailed from Acre on behalf of Latin patriarch Robert of Nantes. His mission was to tell the princes of the West that reinforcements must be sent if the whole kingdom were not to perish. Robert had been present at La Forbie, barely escaping, and later sent a relic of the Holy Blood to Henry III in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to convince him to go on crusade. Henry did sign a truce promising not to attack French lands during the Crusade, and a small force of Englishmen, led by William Longespée, also took the cross. English chronicler Matthew Paris assisted Louis IX in his attempt to recruit Haakon IV and wrote of the Crusade in his &quot;Chronica Majora&quot; but did not travel to the Holy Land.

===Financing the Crusade===
Louis’ expenses on the Crusade came to over 1.5 million &quot;livres tournois (l.t.),&quot; six times his annual revenues, with the bill for troops running at 1000 &quot;l.t.&quot; a day. Louis was largely able to cover this from sources other than his ordinary revenues. From 1248, Jewish moneylenders were expelled from the kingdom, their property confiscated, representing the king&#x27;s anti-Jewish policies and prejudices. Some 80 towns from across France raised over 70,000 &quot;l.t.&quot; in 1248, a figure matched by contributions from Normandy. Louis’ taxation of towns was not unprecedented, as royal towns had helped pay for the Second Crusade led by his great-grandfather, Louis VII of France.

The bulk of Louis’ funding was money derived primarily from vow redemptions and clerical taxation. Redemptions were systematically being offered and collected. The pope expressed concerns the conditions for redemption were too lax and the rates accepted too low, with the potential for speculation and fraud, causing him to impose an audit. As to clerical taxation, a tax of a twentieth was authorized and the French clergy offered a tenth over five years. The distraction of the anti-Hohenstaufen crusade (against Frederick II) and the view of the Holy Land venture as a French crusade reduced international contributions, the English and German churches remaining on the sidelines. Individual commanders, including the king&#x27;s brothers, received grants, and also raised funds from their own lands. However, the bulk of crusade funds and clerical taxes probably found their way into the royal coffers. With the increased income for the king&#x27;s own demesne, this centralized system of financing the expedition gave Louis unprecedented control over his main followers.

===Jean de Joinville===

In October 1245, Louis gathered his barons to receive their agreement and support for the Crusade. The next year, he held another such gathering in Paris of noblemen to swear fealty to his children in the event of his not returning from the Crusade. One of those summoned was Jean de Joinville-sur-Marne, seneschal of Champagne, whose account is the most detailed personal description of any crusade. Joinville was from a crusading family. His grandfather had died on the Third Crusade, two uncles had joined the Fourth Crusade, one dying, and his father Simon of Joinville had fought in the Albigensian Crusade and in Egypt with his cousin John of Brienne during the Fifth Crusade. Refusing to swear fealty to Louis in 1248, Jean embarked from Marseilles with a company of twenty knights. Despite mortgaging his lands, his funds were gone by the time he reached Cyprus. His retinue became mutinous, forcing Jean to enter the king&#x27;s service, in return for which he received an immediate grant.&quot;&quot; This pattern of debt rescued by Louis&#x27; aid was widespread, involving even substantial lords such as the royal brother Alphonse, Guy of Flanders and Guy V of Forez.

===Transportation and supplies===
The core of the expedition lay in the ships that Louis had hired, sixteen from Genoa and twenty from Marseille. The contracts drawn up in 1246 specified delivery at Aigues-Mortes, a small port with a shallow harbour that had recently become part of the royal demesne, requiring significant upgrading. Guglielmo Boccanegra served as Genoese consul at the port through 1249, later serving as paymaster for the Crusade in Acre. The force of 10,000 strong that sailed with Louis in late August 1248 was of comparable size with that of Richard I of England in April 1191. Others took alternate routes. Jean de Joinville and Raymond VII of Toulouse (who died before he could depart) contracted with shippers at Marseilles. Hugh I of Blois, who also died before setting out from Inverness, while one of the transports for Raymond&#x27;s force had to come to Marseilles from the Atlantic coast via the Straits of Gibraltar, a delay that kept the count in port for the winter 1248–1249. Alphonse of Poitiers, running out of money, sailed East in 1249. By the time Louis reached Cyprus, the designated muster point, his agents had spent two years stockpiling vast quantities of food. Other supplies were either purchased in Cyprus or shipped with the army from France. By hiring, paying, buying or manufacturing, Louis appeared determined to leave as little as possible to fate or chance.

===Political and diplomatic environment===
Louis&#x27; preparations had taken three years. Extraordinary taxes, including on the clergy, were levied to pay for the expedition. The governing of France in his absence needed to be settled, and Louis&#x27; mother Blanche was entrusted once more with the regency. The foreign problems were many. Henry III of England had to be trusted to keep the peace. The Venetians, already annoyed at yet another Crusade that might interrupt their commercial arrangements with Egypt, were made still more hostile when Louis utilized ships from Genoa and Marseilles.The situation with emperor Frederick II was unusually thorny. Louis had earned Frederick&#x27;s gratitude by his neutrality in the quarrel between the papacy and the empire, but had threatened intervention when Frederick proposed an attack on the pope at Lyons. Frederick was the father of the king of Jerusalem, Conrad II of Jerusalem, without whose permission Louis had no right to enter the country. Complicating the situation, when French envoys informed Frederick of the progress of the Crusade, he passed the information on to the sultan as-Salih Ayyub.

==The expedition to Egypt==

The Seventh Crusade formally began on 12 August 1248 when Louis IX left from Paris. His entourage included his wife, consort queen of France Margaret of Provence, two of the king&#x27;s brother, Charles I of Anjou with his wife, Beatrice of Provence, sister of Margaret, and Robert I of Artois. The youngest brother of Louis Alphonse of Poitiers with his wife Joan of Toulouse, departed the next year. The king&#x27;s retinue included his cousins and vassals, Hugh IV of Burgundy and Peter Maulcerc, who were considered veterans due to their participation in the Barons&#x27; Crusade; the seigneur and vassal Hugh XI of Lusignan; Jean de Joinville with his cousin John, Count of Saarbrücken; and Olivier de Termes, who was veteran of the Albigensian Crusade. Some of them embarked at Aigues-Mortes, others at Marseilles. An English detachment was led by William Longespée, grandson of Henry II of England, who took his mistress Ida de Tosny (not the rumoured Fair Rosamond) along, followed close behind. The rest of the English lords who had pledged to join the crusade were kept back by Henry III with papal help. The Scottish lords that joined were Patrick II of Dunbar and Stewart of Dundonald.

===The Crusade begins===
By the time the preparations for the Crusade were reaching finalisation, Louis was progressing towards the port of Aigues Mortes in a markedly religious royal procession. The king&#x27;s departure saw a climactic series of ceremonies that culminated in the consecration of the Sainte Chapelle. This, the palace&#x27;s chapel, was built as the actual reliquary container housing his newly acquired collection of Holy relics from the Passion that Baldwin II, the Latin emperor of Constantinople, had sent him. The king of France with his crusade was attempting to fill in the vacated position of the &quot;par excellence&quot; leader of Christendom, an eventuality that happened due to the friction between the emperor Frederick II and pope Gregory IX, leading the latter to excommunicated the former. Louis was embarking on the Crusade in his royal capacity as leader, not least as a personal commitment that rendered him a penitent. Before leaving Paris, Louis went to the Abbey of St. Denis where he received the &quot;Oriflamme&quot; which was considered to be the insignia of the pilgrim. From there he then marched to Notre Dame dressed as a penitent where he heard the mass. After that he continued barefoot to the Abbey of St. Antoine. Even after he had left Paris, Louis was still being dressed as a pilgrim in public appearances. At Lyons, he met with Innocent IV and from there he travelled towards the Mediterranean, dispensing justice as he went. He was the first French king to visit the region since his father in 1226. On 25 August, Louis set sail to his first destination the town of Limassol in Lusignan Cyprus.

===Interlude in Cyprus===
Louis IX arrived in Cyprus on 17 September 1248 and landed the next day accompanied by his queen, her sister, and his chamberlain Jean Pierre Sarrasin (John the Saracen). Sarrasin wrote an extensive letter, quoted in the &quot;Rothelin,&quot; apropos of their voyage at sea, an experience of some good 22 days. After a discourse by &quot;Rothelin&#x27;s&quot; anonymous author on the perils of sea travel and authentic or legendary Roman history, the work returns to Sarrasin&#x27;s letter for the events occurring through 1250. After arriving in Cyprus, the royal party had a long wait for their forces to assemble. The delay was costly, as many men were lost to diseases, including John of Montfort, son of a crusader, Peter of Vendôme, John I of Dreux, and Archambaud IX of Bourbon, grandson of a veteran of the Third Crusade. Robert VII of Béthune was among those who died &quot;en route&quot; to Cyprus. Similarly costly were, however, the limited funding some of his vassals had who then required royal support. As the troops for the Crusade gathered in Cyprus, they were well received by Henry I of Cyprus. The nobles from France were supplemented by those from Acre, among whom were Jean de Ronay and Guillaume de Sonnac. The two eldest sons of John of Brienne, Alsonso of Brienne and Louis of Brienne, also joined and outlived the Crusade. John of Ibelin, nephew to the Old Lord of Beirut, joined later in 1249. When the plan of the campaign was discussed, it was agreed that Egypt was the objective. It was the richest and most vulnerable province of the Ayyubids and many remembered how the sultan&#x27;s father, al-Kamil had been willing to exchange Jerusalem itself for Damietta in the Fifth Crusade.

Louis wanted to start operations at once but was deterred from the grand masters and Syrian barons. The winter storms would soon begin and the coast of the delta of Nile would be too dangerous to reach. In addition, they hoped to persuade the king to intervene in the Ayyubid affairs. The Franks also missed an opportunity as the sultan as-Salih Ayyub had taken his army to fight an-Nasir Yusuf, emir of Aleppo, at Homs. The Templars had already entered into negotiations with the sultan suggesting that territorial concessions would be met with Frankish intervention. Louis wanted to have nothing to do with scheming or excelling at diplomacy, he had come to fight the Muslims. He ordered Guillaume de Sonnac to break the negotiations off and sent a list of demands to the sultan. The sultan&#x27;s response was equally diplomatic.

While the king would not negotiate with Muslims, he did so with the Mongols following the precedent of the pope. In December 1248, two Nestorians, called Mark and David, arrived at Nicosia. They were sent by the Mongol general Eljigidei Noyan, the commissioner of the Great Khan at Mosul, bringing a letter expressing the Mongols’ sympathy for Christianity. Louis responded by sending the Arabic-speaking André de Longjumeau to meet with the general. He carried with him a chapel, relics for its altar and other presents. From Eljigidei&#x27;s camp, de Longjumeau sent on to Mongolia. On his arrival at Karakorum, he found that Güyük, with whom the pope had negotiated, had died, with his widow Oghul Qaimish now as regent. She regarded the king&#x27;s gifts as the tribute due to her and declined sending a large expedition to the West. De Longjumeau returned in 1252 with a patronizing letter thanking her vassal Louis for his attentions, requesting that similar gifts each year. Apparently shocked by this response, Louis still hoped to achieve an eventual Mongol alliance.

Before coming to Cyprus, Louis had collected food and weapons for the army on the island, but his commissariat had not expected to have to feed so many. By spring, it was practical to sail against Egypt and Louis called on local Italian merchants for their ships. The Venetians disapproved of the endeavour and were unwilling to help due to their open war against the Genoese and their allies the Pisans in Acre, let alone to Louis&#x27; alliance with the Genoese. John of Ibelin, son of the Old Lord and now ruler of Arsuf, managed to secure a truce for three years, and by the end of May the ships were provided. In the meantime, Louis received many callers while at Nicosia. Hethoum of Armenia sent him gifts. Bohemond V of Antioch requested several hundred archers to protect his principality from brigands, which were provided. Maria of Brienne came to beg for help for the Latin empire being threatened by John III Ducas Vatatzes, the emperor of Nicaea. Her pleas were refused as the Crusade against the infidel took precedence. Loyalist Hugh IV of Burgundy had spent the winter in Achaea and convinced their ruler William of Villehardouin to join the Crusade. He arrived with ships and Frankish soldiers from the Morea, to remain for the duration.

===The Crusaders at Damietta===

The sultan as-Salih Ayyub had spent the winter at Damascus, trying to finish the conquest of Homs before the Franks invaded. He had expected them to land in Syria, and realizing that the objective was instead Egypt, the siege was lifted and he ordered his armies to follow him to Cairo. He was stricken with tuberculosis and could no longer lead his men in person and turned to his aged vizier Fakhr ad-Din ibn as-Shaikh, who had negotiated with Frederick II during the Sixth Crusade, to command the army. He sent stores of munitions to Damietta and garrisoned it with the Bedouin tribesmen of the Banū Kinana, known for their courage. He monitored the coming conflict from his camp at the village of Ashmun al-Rumman, to the east of the main branch of the Nile. Fakhr ad-Din was supported by Qutuz, later to become the sultan. (See a map of the area here.)

On 13 May 1249, a fleet of one hundred and twenty large transport vessels was assembled and the army began its embarkation. A storm scattered the ships a few days later and the king finally set sail on 30 May, arriving off Damietta on 4 June 1249. Only a quarter of his contingent sailed with him, the rest made their way independently to the Egyptian coast. Aboard his flagship the &quot;Montjoie,&quot; Louis&#x27; advisers urged delay of disembarking till the rest of the fleet units&#x27; arrival, but he refused. At dawn of 5 June, the landing and subsequent Siege of Damietta began. There was a fierce battle at the edge of the sea led by the king. Under John of Ibelin of the knights of France and Outremer prevailed against their Muslims adversaries. At nightfall, Fakhr ad-Din withdrew over a bridge of boats to Damietta, only to find the population in panic and the garrison wavering, leading him to evacuate the city. All the Muslim civilians fled with him, with the Kinana following, but not before setting the bazaars to fire. His orders to destroy the bridge of boats were not observed, allowing for the Crusaders entrance to the city. The latter had received news from its Christian population that Damietta was then undefended. Guillaume de Sonnac wrote of how on the morning after the battle, Damietta had been seized with only one Crusader casualty.

The rapid capture of Damietta was unexpected, but the Nile floods would soon pin down the Crusaders. Louis, knowing the experience of the first Battle of Mansurah in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade, would not advance before the river flowed. He was also waiting for the arrival of the reinforcements under his brother Alphonse. In the meantime, Damietta once again transformed into a Frankish city. The Amr Ibn al-A&#x27;as Mosque became the cathedral, where Louis&#x27; son would later be baptized. The Genoese and Pisans were rewarded for their services, and so were the Venetians repenting their hostility. The native Coptic Miaphysites were given justice by the king, welcoming his rule. Queen Margaret and the rest of the ladies of the Crusade were summoned from Acre. Louis also welcomed his ally the Latin emperor, Baldwin II of Constantinople, who being in dire need of monies had sold him the Passion relics. Throughout the summer months Damietta became briefly the capital of Outremer. The inaction brought to the soldiers along with the humid heat of the Delta demoralization. Food shortage followed disease outbreak in the camp.

The loss of Damietta again shocked the Muslim world, and, like his father thirty years ago, as-Salih Ayyub offered to trade Damietta for Jerusalem. The offer was rejected as Louis refused to negotiate with an infidel. Meanwhile, those responsible for the loss of the city were punished, with the Kinana emirs executed and Fakhr ad-Din and his Mamluk commanders disgraced. There was talk of a coup, but Fakhr ad-Din having stopped them saved him face for his loyalty to the dynasty. Troops were rushed up to Mansurah, built by al-Kamil on the site of his victory over the Crusaders of 1221. The dying as-Salih Ayyub was carried there in a litter to organize the army. Bedouins conducted guerrilla operations around the walls of Damietta, killing any Frank that strayed outside. The Franks erected dykes and dug ditches to protect the city.
===Advancement towards Mansurah===
The Nile waters receded at the end of October 1249, and Alphonse arrived with the reinforcements from France. It was time to advance on Cairo. Peter Maulcerc and the Syrian barons proposed an alternate attack on Alexandria, surprise the Egyptians and control the Mediterranean littoral of Egypt. But Louis’ other brother Robert I of Artois opposed the operation along with the king and, on 20 November 1249, the Frankish army set out from Damietta to Mansurah. A garrison was left to guard the city where the queen and the patriarch Robert of Nantes remained.

Louis&#x27; timing of the move was fortuitous. As-Salih Ayyub died on 23 November 1249 after having his leg amputated in an attempt to save his life from a serious abscess. As-Salih did not trust his son al-Muazzam Turanshah and had kept him at a safe distance from Egypt in Hasankeyf. As-Salih&#x27;s widow, Shajar al-Durr managed to conceal the news of her husband&#x27;s death, confiding only in the chief eunuch Jamal ad-Din Mohsen and the commander Fakhr ad-Din. She forged a document under his signature which appointed Turanshah as heir and Fakhr ad-Din as viceroy. Mamluk commander Faris ad-Din Aktai was sent to return Turanshah home. (Turanshah&#x27;s rule would be brief. His mother married al-Malik al-Muizz Aybak, who served as Mamluk ruler of Egypt, as regent to al-Ashraf Musa and later as sultan.) When as-Salih&#x27;s death was finally revealed, the sultana and viceroy were firmly in charge. But the Franks were encouraged by the news and believed that this government would soon collapse.

The route taken by the Crusaders from Damietta was crossed by numerous canals and branches of the Nile. The largest was the al-Bahr as-Saghit (Ushmum canal), which left the main river just below Mansurah and ran past Ashmun al-Rumman to Lake Manzala, isolating the island of Damietta. Fakhr ad-Din kept the bulk of his forces behind the al-Bahr as-Saghir, and sent his cavalry to harass the Franks as they crossed the canals. There was a battle near Fariskur on 7 December 1249, where the Egyptian cavalry was stopped, and the Templars, against all orders, pursued those retreating. On 14 December, Louis reached the village of Barāmūn, just ten miles to the north of their objective, and the next week encamped on the river banks opposite to Mansurah. On 29 December, Bishop Hugh of Clermont died.

===Battle of Mansurah===
For six weeks, the armies of the West and Egypt faced each other on opposite sides of the canal, leading to second Battle of Mansurah that would end on 11 February 1250 with an Ayyubid victory. The Egyptians attempted to attack the Franks in the rear was stopped by Charles I of Anjou. Louis had ordered construction to bridge the waterway, but the resultant enemy bombardment, including the use of Greek fire, caused the work to be abandoned. At one point, an Egyptian Copt came to the camp and offered to reveal the location of a ford across the canal. At the dawn of 8 February, the Crusaders set out across the ford. The king led the advancing army while Hugh IV of Burgundy and Renaud de Vichiers remained to guard the camp. The vanguard was led by Robert I of Artois and supported by the Templars and the English contingent. He was under orders not to attack until directed by the king. Once Robert and his force had crossed the river, he feared that the element of surprise would be lost unless he took the offensive. Despite opposition, Robert attacked the Egyptian camp. The Egyptians were unprepared, still beginning their day, when the Frankish cavalry arrived. The Muslims were slaughtered looking for their weapons, the survivors fleeing to Mansurah. Fakhr ad-Din had just left his bath when he heard the attack, leaping on his horse to ride into the battle. He was cut down by Templar knights.

Having taken the Egyptian camp, Robert&#x27;s commanders Guillaume de Chateauneuf and William Longespée again cautioned him to wait for the main army to arrive. Determined to finish off the Egyptian army, Robert denounced the Templars and the English as cowards and charged toward the fleeing Egyptians. Although Fakhr ad-Din was dead, his commander Rukn ad-Din Baibars, later Mamluk sultan, restored order to the Egyptians. Strategically placing soldiers in the town, he allowed the Frankish cavalry through the open gate and the Egyptians attacked them from the sidestreets. The horses could not turn in the narrow spaces and were thrown into confusion. The few knights that escaped on foot to the river were drown in its waters. The Templars fell fighting, with only five out of 290 surviving. Among the survivors were the Templar master Guillaume de Sonnac, losing an eye, Humbert V de Beaujeu, constable of France, John II of Soissons, and the duke of Brittany, Peter Maulcerc. Counted with the dead were the king&#x27;s brother Robert I of Artois, William Longespée and most of his English followers, Peter of Courtenay, and Raoul II of Coucy. The survivors hurried to warn the king.

Upon hearing of the battle at the Egyptian camp, Louis drew up his front line to meet an attack, and sent the engineers to make a bridge over the stream. The crossbowmen had been left on the far side to cover the crossing, and now needed to be brought over on a pontoon nearing completion. The Mamluks soon charged out of the town towards his lines. Keeping his force in reserve while the enemy poured arrows into their ranks, Louis ordered a counterattack as soon as their ammunition ran short. The cavalries of the two sides fought back and forth while trying tried to hinder the building of the pontoon. The pontoon was soon finished and the bowmen crossed over, and the Egyptians retired back into the city. Louis had his victory, but a cost of the loss of much of his force and their commanders, including his younger brother. But the victory would be short-lived.

===Disaster at Fariskur===

The situation that Louis found himself in was reminiscent of that of the Fifth Crusade when the Crusader army that had captured Damietta was eventually forced to retreat. He would likely suffer the same fate unless the Egyptians would offer him acceptable terms. On 11 February 1250, the Egyptians attacked again, supported by reinforcements from the south, engaging the Franks in battle. Charles I of Anjou and the Syrian and Cypriot barons at the left held their ground, but the remnants of the Templars and the French nobles at the right wavered, to be rescued by the king. Templar master Guillaume de Sonnac, who had lost an eye at Mansurah, lost the other and died from it. Acting Hospitaller master Jean de Ronay was also killed. Alphonse of Poitiers, guarding the camp was encircled and was rescued by the camp followers. At nightfall, the Muslims gave up the assault and returned to town.

For eight weeks, Louis waited at the Crusader camp, hoping the leadership problem in Cairo would work to his advantage. Instead, on 28 February 1250, Turanshah arrived from Damascus where he had been proclaimed sultan following his father&#x27;s death. His arrival was the impetus for a new Egyptian offensive. A squadron of light boats were made and transported by camel to the lower portion of the Nile. There they began to intercept the boats that brought food from Damietta, capturing more than eighty Frankish ships. On 16 March 1250 alone, a convoy of thirty-two were lost at one fell swoop. The Franks were quickly beset by famine and disease, including dysentery and typhoid.

The Battle of Fariskur fought on 6 April 1250 would be the decisive defeat of Louis&#x27; army. Louis knew that the army must be extricated to Damietta and began negotiations, offering Turanshah the exchange of Damietta for Jerusalem. The Egyptians realized his disadvantageous position and rejected the offer. In planning their retreat, Louis&#x27; officers urged him to go immediately to Damietta. He refused to leave his men. It was decided that the sick should be sent by boat down the Nile and the able-bodied should march along the road by which they had come. They departed on the morning of 5 April, and the painful journey began, with the king in the rear and the Egyptians in pursuit. The Franks managed to get across the al-Bahr as-Saghit, but neglected to destroy the pontoon behind them. The Egyptians crossed over and began attacking the Franks from all sides. Their attacks were repulsed and the Franks moved slowly on, with Louis falling ill that night. The next day, the Muslims surrounded the army at the town of Fariskur, 10 miles southwest of Damietta, and attacked in full force. Hugh XI of Lusignan was among the dead. To the sick and weary soldiers, it was clear that the end had come. Geoffrey of Sergines, commander of the royal bodyguard, sheltered the king at nearby Sharamsah. On 6 April, Louis&#x27; surrender was negotiated directly with the sultan by Philip of Montfort. The king and his entourage were taken in chains to Mansurah and his whole army was rounded up and led into captivity. The ships conveying the sick to Damietta were surrounded and captured. The Egyptian victory was total. An agonized Templar knight lamented:

===Louis&#x27; captivity and release===
The Egyptians were surprised by the large number of prisoners taken, estimated by the sultan himself at 30,000, certainly an exaggeration, but likely most of Louis&#x27; force. Unable to guard all of them, the infirm were executed immediately, and every day several hundred were decapitated, by order of the sultan. Louis was moved to a private residence in Mansurah and the Crusader leaders were kept together in a larger prison. While they were threatened with death, their value for ransom allowed them to stay alive. Jean de Joinville, on-board one of the captured ships, saved his life by claiming to be the king&#x27;s cousin. It was later revealed that he was actually the emperor&#x27;s cousin, which served him well as the prestige of Frederick II among the Egyptians was a plus. When Louis was ordered by the sultan to cede not only Damietta but all the Frankish lands in Syria, he noted that they were not under his control, but rather that of Conrad II of Jerusalem, the emperor&#x27;s son. The demand was quickly dropped. The final terms exacted from Louis were harsh. He was to ransom himself by the surrender of Damietta and his army by the payment of a million bezants (later reduced to 800,000). After the terms were agreed to, the king and the barons were taken down the river to Fariskur, where the sultan had taken residence. There they would go on to Damietta, the city to be handed over on 30 April 1250.

That the bargain could be made at all was due in large part to the queen. When Louis began his march on Mansurah, Margaret of Provence was in the later stages of pregnancy and their son John Tristan, the child of sorrow, was born on 8 April, three days after the news came of the surrender of the army. At the same time, she learned that the Pisans and Genoese were planning to evacuate Damietta due to lack of food. She knew that Damietta could not hold without the Italians and she summoned their leaders. If Damietta were to be abandoned there would be nothing to offer towards the release of her husband. She proposed buying all the food in the city and distributing at an enormous cost, and they agreed to stay, boosting the morale of the city. Soon thereafter, she was moved to Acre, while the Latin patriarch Robert of Nantes went under safe-conduct to complete the arrangements for the ransom with the sultan. 

Robert arrived there to find Turanshah dead, murdered on 2 May 1250 in a coup instigated by his stepmother Shajar al-Durr and led by Baibars. Aybak became commander after Turanshah&#x27;s assassination, later marrying his widow. His safe-conduct guaranteed by Turanshah was viewed as valueless and treated him as a prisoner. Some Mamluks brandished their swords before the king and the captive barons, still covered with the executed sultan&#x27;s blood. But, in the end, the Egyptians confirmed the agreed-upon terms. When Louis was asked to swear that he would renounce Christ if he failed in his bargain, he refused. On 6 May, Geoffrey of Sergines handed Damietta over to the Muslim vanguard. The king and the nobles were later brought there and Louis set about finding money for the first installment of the ransom, at first coming up short. Until the remainder could be found, the Egyptians held back releasing the king&#x27;s brother Alphonse. The Templars, known to have a large supply of money, finally agreed to provide what was required. Louis and the barons set sail for Acre, where they arrived on 12 May 1250 after a stormy voyage. Many wounded soldiers had been left behind at Damietta, and contrary to their promise, the Muslims massacred them all.

===Aftermath of the Egyptian campaign===
The Seventh Crusade would not end for another four years, but there would be no further battles. In Acre, Louis pursued the release of his imprisoned army and attempted to bring order to an increasingly chaotic Outremer. Louis was the last of the Crusader leaders to actually reach the shores of the eastern Mediterranean, and his failure was keenly felt in the West as well as the Holy Land and Muslim world. When the extent of the disaster reached mainland Europe, unrest in Venice and other Italian cities was reported. France plunged into a sort of public mourning. For many, the grief was immediate and personal; for lost those lost in battle or in captivity. In France reactions took a more aggressive turn, which revealed the extent of popular disenchantment.

The death of Turanshah essentially ended the Ayyubid dynasty begun by Saladin. Shajar al-Durr was not accepted by the Abbasid caliph al-Musta&#x27;sim in Baghdad. Shajar, who had married her commander Aybak, then abdicated and passed the throne to her husband. Aybak&#x27;s formal rule ended after just five days. The Bahri Mamluks that essentially controlled Egypt at this point installed as sultan the 6-year-old al-Ashraf Musa. Nevertheless, the actual power in Egypt was still exercised by Aybak, who had returned to his position of atabeg. Egypt would remain a Mamluk sultanate through 1517.

Henry III of England took the Cross with many of his subjects in the spring of 1250 but convinced the pope to postpone any expedition. Louis’ brothers refused to send help from France where public opinion was indignant but disillusioned. The French nobles contented themselves with bitter comments against the pope who preferred to preach a crusade against the Christian Imperialists rather than to send help to those who were struggling against the infidel. On 13 December 1250, Frederick II, who remained respected in Muslim circles, died in Italy. His son Conrad II of Jerusalem lacked the emperor&#x27;s prestige but inherited the pope&#x27;s crusade against his father. Blanche of Castile went so far as to confiscate the property of any royal vassal who responded to the appeal of Innocent IV for a crusade against Conrad in 1251. But neither she nor her advisers ventured to send reinforcements to the East.

==The Shepherds&#x27; Crusade==

The Shepherds’ Crusade (&quot;Crucesignatio pastorellorum&quot;) of 1251 was a popular crusade of poor shepherds and peasants from the Low Countries and northern France who set out with the objective of aiding the captive Louis IX and rescuing the Holy Land from the infidels. After his release from the Egyptians, Louis sent his brothers to France to obtain relief and his mother Blanche of Castile, acting as regent, endeavoured in vain to find reinforcements as neither the noblemen nor the clergy would help. At this juncture the citizens rose up, announcing that they would go to the king&#x27;s rescue. At Eastertime 1251, a mysterious person known as the &quot;Le Maître de Hongrie&quot; (Master of Hungary) began to preach a crusade to the shepherds in the north of France, always holding a map supposedly given to him by the Virgin Mary. He drew large crowds and allowed them to take the cross without papal authorization.

The movement spread rapidly and soon an army of the Pastoureaux of nearly 60,000 men was formed, carrying a banner on which was depicted the Blessed Virgin appearing to the Master of Hungary. The army soon showed themselves hostile to the clergy, especially to the Dominicans, whom they accused of having induced the king to go to the Holy Land. A host of less-than-desirable men and women soon joined their ranks, and with growing audacity attacked clerics and preached against the bishops and even the pope. Blanche imagined that she could send the Pastoureaux to the relief of her son, and met with the master, providing him with gifts. Emboldened, the Pastoureaux entered Paris with predictable mayhem. After Paris, they divided into several armies which spread terror across France. Blanche finally realized that she had been mistaken and commanded the royal officers to arrest and destroy them. A troop of citizens pursued and halted them near Villeneuve-sur-Cher. The Master of Hungary was slain, together with a large number of his followers, ending one of the most curious of the popular movements.

==Louis at Acre, 1250–1254==
After his arrival at Acre, Louis reviewed his future plans. His mother had urged his speedy return to France given unrest among the populace and other urgent problems. But he felt that he should stay. His disastrous crusade had destroyed both the French and Outremer armies. It was also his duty to remain at hand until the last of the prisoners in Egypt was released. On 3 July he publicly announced his decision to stay. A letter was sent to the nobles of France telling of his decision and asking for reinforcements for the Crusade. He had felt bitterly the failure of his great effort with the loss of thousands of lives.
===&quot;De facto&quot; ruler of the kingdom===
The king&#x27;s brothers and the leading nobles of the Crusade sailed from Acre in mid-July, leaving an army of about 1400 men in the Holy Land. The queen remained with the king and their son John Tristan would soon be joined by siblings Peter of Alençon in 1251 and Blanche of France in 1253. He was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the kingdom, especially after Frederick&#x27;s death, even though the throne was legitimately that of Conrad II of Jerusalem, who would never now come to the East. The regency had passed from Alice of Champagne to her son Henry I of Cyprus. He had, in turn, nominated his cousin John of Arsuf as &quot;bailli,&quot; who handed over the government to Louis. He was far more successful in handling the citizens of Outremer than Frederick had been. He successfully resolved the Antiochean crisis after the death of Bohemond V of Antioch on 17 January 1252. Bohemond VI of Antioch, aged fifteen, succeeded at the principality under the regency of his mother Lucienne of Segni, who handed the governing to her Italian relatives. Bohemond VI, knowing of his mother&#x27;s unpopularity petitioned the pope, with Louis’ approval, to come of age a few months before the legal date. Innocent IV agreed and Bohemond was knighted by the king at Acre, with Lucienne removed from power. At the same time Louis completed the reconciliation of Antioch and Armenia, erasing previous bad relations with Hethum I of Armenia. In 1254, on Louis’ suggestion, Bohemond VI married the Armenian king&#x27;s daughter Sibylla of Armenia, essentially becoming a vassal of his father-in-law&#x27;s and getting the Armenians to share in the protection of Antioch.

Henry I of Cyprus died on 18 January 1253, leaving as heir his son, Hugh II of Cyprus, only a few months old. His widow, Plaisance of Antioch, daughter of Bohemond V, claimed the regency of both Cyprus and of Jerusalem. The barons of Outremer required her attendance in person before they would recognize regency and John of Arsuf, remained meanwhile as &quot;bailli,&quot; and Plaisance would eventually marrying his son Balian of Arsuf. But, in reality, Louis continued to administer the government.
===Negotiations for the prisoners===
His experience in Egypt, tempered by his current lack of an armed force, led him to consider diplomatic relations with the Muslims. The time was favorable for diplomacy as the Mamluk takeover in Egypt was not well received in Syria, with their strong loyalties to the Ayyubids. Following Turanshah&#x27;s death, an-Nasir Yusuf conducted a friendly takeover of Damascus on 9 July 1250. The resultant rivalry between Cairo and Damascus served Louis well with both eager for aid from the Franks. Shortly after he arrived at Acre, Louis received an embassy from an-Nasir Yusuf, but he remained noncommittal. An Acre-Damascene alliance might be strategically preferable, but he had to consider that men that were still imprisoned in Egypt.

The Damascene army of an-Nasir Yusuf invaded Egypt and encountered the Egyptian army under Aybak on 2 February 1251 near Zagazig. The Syrians were at first successful, but one of their regiments of Mamluks deserted in the midst of the battle. Yusuf, not known for his courage, fled back to Damascus. Mamluk power in Egypt was saved, but the Ayyubids still held Palestine and Syria. When Yusuf contacted Acre proposing that he might trade Jerusalem in return for Frankish help, Louis sent an embassy to Cairo under John of Valenciennes warning Aybak that unless the question of the Frankish prisoners was soon settled he would ally himself with Damascus. His ploy succeeded in securing the release of some 3000 captives, including Hospitaller master Guillaume de Chateauneuf, taken in 1244 at Gaza, in exchange for 300 Muslim prisoners. Louis then demanded the release of all remaining prisoners remaining without payment of the second installment of his ransom. Aybek, realizing that Louis&#x27; envoy was visiting Damascus, consented in return for a military alliance against Yusuf. He further promised the return of the pre-1187 kingdom as far east as the Jordan. Louis accepted the offer and the prisoners were released in March 1252. The Templars stubbornly refused to break off relations with Damascus and Louis was forced to rebuke them publicly and demand an apology.

When an-Nasir Yusuf learned of the treaty, he deployed his troops between the two now-allies, in Gaza. Louis moved his troops to Jaffa but the Mamluks failed to advance out of Egypt. For a year, the Syrians and the Franks remained deadlocked, neither wishing a battle. In the meantime, Louis repaired the fortifications of Jaffa as had done for those of Acre, Haifa and Caesarea. Early in 1253, Yusuf asked Baghdad to mediate between him and the Mamluks. Al-Musta&#x27;sim wished to unite the Muslim world against the Mongols, and he asked Aybak to accept Damascus’ terms. Aybak was recognized as sultan of Egypt and allowed to annex most of Palestine. The peace was signed in April 1253 and the previous arrangement with the Franks, including return of kingdom territory, was long forgotten. Nonetheless, neither Muslim leader showed any further desire for war with the Franks.

===The Assassins and the Mongols===
There was no support from the West for a continued Crusade and in his search for foreign allies, Louis looked to two unlikely sources: the Assassins and the Mongols. The chief &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; of the Assassins in Syria was Radi ad-Din Abu&#x27;l-Ma&#x27;āli. After the Franks&#x27; disaster at Damietta, Radi brazenly demanded from Acre compensation for their neutrality and, in particular, to be released from their tribute paid to the Hospitallers. He was rebuffed and next sent a humbler embassy, bringing gifts for the king, and requesting a close alliance. Louis, learning of the hostility of the Isma&#x27;ili sect towards the more orthodox Sunni Muslims, encouraged their advances and a pact of mutual defense was concluded. Louis’ main diplomatic initiative was to secure the friendship of the Mongols, an enemy of the Assassins. Early in 1253, Louis learned that a Mongol prince, Sartaq, son of Batu Khan, had been converted to Christianity. He immediately sent a contingent led by the Dominican William of Rubruck to urge Sartaq to come to the aid of his fellow Christians in Syria. But it was not within the power of such a junior Mongol prince to conclude such an alliance and no further contract would occur prior to Louis&#x27; departure from the Holy Land.

===Louis returns home===
While the Dominicans journeyed further into Asia to the court of Möngke Khan, Louis decided to return home. His mother had died on 27 November 1252, and her death was quickly followed by disarray in his kingdom. Henry III again began to make trouble, despite his oath to go on crusade, and he would not support his bishops whom Innocent IV had charged with preaching the crusade. Civil unrest was rampant, with the War of the Flemish Succession and many of the vassals of France growing restive. Louis’ duty was to his own kingdom in France and he prepared to return home. He and his family sailed from Acre on 24 April 1254. His boat was nearly wrecked off the coast of Cyprus and later was nearly destroyed by fire. In July, the royal party landed at Hyeres, in the territory of the king&#x27;s brother, Charles I of Anjou. The Seventh Crusade was over, again having accomplished nothing but the loss of lives and treasure.
==Aftermath==
The Seventh Crusade had involved Outremer in a terrible military catastrophe. Although Louis&#x27; four years at Acre did much to repair the damage, the loss of manpower would never be recovered. His coming to the East had been simultaneously unfortunate and necessary, but his departure brought the risk of immediate harm. He left behind him as his representative Geoffrey of Sergines as seneschal to the kingdom. The &quot;bailli&quot; of the kingdom was now John of Ibelin, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon, who had succeeded his cousin John of Arsuf. The latter John was likely in Cyprus, advising Plaisance, legal regent of both kingdoms. The death of Conrad II of Jerusalem on 21 May 1254 resulted in his two-year-old son Conradin becoming the king of Jerusalem, albeit nominally. As one of his last official acts, Louis arranged a multi-year truce with Damascus beginning 21 February 1254, as an-Nasir Yusuf was justifyably concerned about the Mongol peril and had no wish for war with the Franks. Aybak of Egypt also wished to avoid war and in 1255 made a ten years’ truce with the Franks. Jaffa was expressly excluded from the truce, as the sultan wished to secure it as a port for his Palestinian province. The frontier between the parties were subject to constant raids and counter-raids. In January 1256, the Franks captured a large caravan of pack animals. When the Mamluk governor of Jerusalem led an expedition in March to punish the raiders, he was defeated and killed. Aybak made a new treaty with Damascus, again with the caliph&#x27;s mediation, ceding Palestine. Both Muslim powers renewed their truces with the Franks, to last ten years and to cover the territory of Jaffa.

The Ayyubid dynasty would essentially end with the Siege of Aleppo from 18 January to 24 January 1260 in which the Mongols completed their invasion of the Levant. Later that year, on 3 September 1260, the Mamluks defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut, halting the advance of the Ilkhanate. As the Mamluk dynasty grew in power under Baibars, Louis IX petitioned Clement IV, elected pope in 1265, to go on yet another expedition, the Eighth Crusade.

==Participants==
A partial list of those that participated in the Seventh Crusade can be found in the category collections of Christians of the Seventh Crusade and Muslims of the Seventh Crusade.
== Literary response ==
The failure of the Seventh Crusade engendered several poetic responses from the Occitan troubadours. Austorc d&#x27;Aorlhac, composing shortly after the Crusade, was surprised that God would allow Louis IX to be defeated, but not surprised that some Christians would therefore convert to Islam. 

In a later poem, &quot;D&#x27;un sirventes m&#x27;es gran voluntatz preza&quot;, Bernart de Rovenac attacks both James I of Aragon and Henry III of England for neglecting to defend their fiefs that the &quot;rei que conquer Suria&quot; ( the king who conquered Syria) had possessed. The &quot;rei que conquer Suria&quot; is a mocking reference to Louis, who was still in Syria in 1254 when Bernart was writing, probably in hopes that the English and Aragonese kings would take advantage of the French monarch&#x27;s absence.

Raoul de Soissons, a trouvère who travelled with the Crusader force wrote several chanson dedicated to Charles I of Anjou. However, Bertran d&#x27;Alamanon criticized Charles&#x27; neglect of Provence in favor of crusading. He wrote one of his last works, which bemoans Christendom&#x27;s decline overseas, between the Seventh and Eighth Crusades, c.1260–1265.

<doc id="333154" wikidata="Q30825090" url="?curid=333154" title="Murder of Balbir Singh Sodhi">
<text>Balbir Singh Sodhi (July 6, 1949 – September 15, 2001), a Sikh-American entrepreneur and franchisee in Mesa, Arizona, was murdered in a hate crime in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. This was the first of several cases across the United States that were reported to the police as supposed acts of retaliation for the attacks. Balbir Singh Sodhi, who had a beard and wore a turban in accordance with his Sikh faith, was mistakenly profiled as an Arab Muslim and murdered by 42-year-old Frank Silva Roque (July 8, 1959 – May 11, 2022), a Boeing aircraft mechanic at a local repair facility who held a criminal record for an attempted robbery in California. Roque had reportedly told friends that he was &quot;going to go out and shoot some towel-heads&quot; the day of the attacks. Roque was sentenced to death (commuted later to life imprisonment) for first degree murder. He died in prison on May 11, 2022.

==Background==
Born on July 6, 1949, in Jalandhar, Punjab, India, Balbir Singh Sodhi was a member of the Sikh religion. He was also a husband, and father to three sons and two daughters. He immigrated to the United States in 1989 and initially resided in Los Angeles, where he worked as a computer engineer and analyst at HP. He saved enough money to buy a gas station and several affiliated franchises in Phoenix, Arizona, and moved there. Sodhi&#x27;s gas station had been running for just a year prior to his murder and in that time he had become known amongst the community as a generous and kind man who often gave free candy to children who came in. 

On September 11, 2001, members of al-Qaeda, a militant Islamist group, hijacked four airplanes and perpetrated the 9/11 attacks, killing 2,977 victims. According to family members, Sodhi had become distraught by the attacks.

==Shooting of Sodhi, others==
On September 15, 2001, 4 days after the attacks, Roque took his Chevrolet S-10 from the Wild Hare sports bar in Mesa, where he had reportedly been ranting about immigrants, and drove to the Chevron gas station owned by Sodhi. Roque shot Sodhi five times from his truck with a .380 handgun, killing him. At the time of the shooting, Sodhi was helping landscaper Luis Ledesma plant flowers around the edge of his gas station in order to commemorate the lives of those lost in the 9/11 attacks. Roque, who apparently wanted revenge for the 9/11 attacks, racially profiled him as an Arab Muslim because of the clothes he wore, his turban, and his beard.

Roque then drove to a Mobil gas station away. Twenty minutes after the first shooting, he shot at a Lebanese-American clerk from his truck, but missed. Roque then drove to his former residence, which had been purchased by a local Afghan family, and fired multiple rounds at the outside of the house. After fleeing the scene of the final shooting, Roque was reported to have gone to a local bar and boasted, &quot;They&#x27;re investigating the murder of a turban-head down the street.&quot;

=== Attitudes towards the Sikh community post-9/11 ===
Sodhi&#x27;s murder was preceded by multiple hostile incidences in the Phoenix area, targeted at Sikhs in the days following the 9/11 attacks. A Sikh spokesperson stated that it was difficult for Sikhs in the community to go to work at gas stations or to work as cashiers because of the rise in overt harassment towards them. This spokesperson also described how the appearance of Sikh men make them easy targets due to their beards and turbans which make Sikh men &quot;look more like bin Laden than Muslims do&quot;.

After the 9/11 attacks, there was a lot of eagerness to retaliate against those who perpetrated the terror attacks, and members of the Sikh community, mainly men, became the targets of these retaliations. Sikhs became the victims of a multitude of hate crimes such as murder, redundancy, threats, and the burning of their places of worship (Gurudwaras).

Many Sikhs began experiencing acts of discrimination within their friendships and relationships that were formed prior to the terror attacks. Their relationships became strained due to suspicion, with Sikh men being asked to cut their hair and to stop wearing their turbans in order to mitigate further suspicion.

==Arrest, trial, and conviction of shooter==
Police arrested Roque the next day, initially unaware of the later shooting incidents. He reportedly shouted slogans including &quot;I am a patriot!&quot; and &quot;I stand for America all the way!&quot; during his arrest. His bail was set at $1 million.

Roque&#x27;s trial by jury began on August 18, 2003. Defense attorneys argued he was not guilty due to insanity, claiming that he had a diminished IQ and heard relentless voices telling him that Arabs were Satanic and must be killed. Two coworkers testified that Roque was &quot;narrow-minded&quot; and that he hated both immigrants and Arabs. Roque&#x27;s defense attorney characterized him as mentally ill, and noted that his mother had twice been hospitalized for schizophrenia, a condition which has been shown to appear in those genetically predisposed to it. On September 30, 2003, he was found guilty of first degree murder, and was sentenced to death nine days later.

On July 19, 2005, Roque was found guilty of an unspecified conspiracy charge while in prison, specified only as a violent crime. On February 27, 2006, he was found guilty of having manufactured a primitive weapon in prison three days earlier. In August 2006, the Arizona Supreme Court changed Roque&#x27;s death sentence to a sentence of life in prison without parole, citing his low IQ and mental illness as mitigating factors. The trial was aired by Court TV in a five-part series.

Roque died on May 11, 2022, while in Arizona Department of Corrections custody. He was 62 years old.

==Sukhpal Singh Sodhi==
On August 4, 2002, less than a year after Balbir&#x27;s death, his younger brother Sukhpal was shot to death while driving his taxicab in San Francisco, apparently killed by a stray bullet from a nearby gang fight. In response to this second tragedy, Balbir&#x27;s son said, &quot;What are you going to do with anger? We like peace and we are peaceful people.&quot;

== Memorialization of Balbir Singh Sodhi ==
In the months prior to the 10-year anniversary of Sodhi&#x27;s death, the Arizona legislature decided that they wanted to remove Sodhi&#x27;s name and plaque from the state&#x27;s 9/11 memorial. This was vetoed by the governor after an outcry of advocacy from community groups in the area.

<doc id="333155" wikidata="Q180252" url="?curid=333155" title="Lewis Black">
<text>Lewis Niles Black (born August 30, 1948) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. His comedy routines often escalate into angry rants about history, politics, religion and cultural trends.

He hosted the Comedy Central series &quot;Lewis Black&#x27;s Root of All Evil&quot; and makes regular appearances on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; delivering his &quot;Back in Black&quot; commentary segment, which he has been doing since &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was hosted by Craig Kilborn. He was voted 51st of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time by Comedy Central in 2004 and was voted 5th in Comedy Central&#x27;s Stand Up Showdown in 2008 and 11th in 2010. In 2015, he appeared as the voice of Anger in the Pixar film &quot;Inside Out&quot;, a role he reprises in the 2024 sequel.

Lewis Black is also a spokesman for the Aruba Tourism Authority, appearing in television ads that first aired in late 2009 and 2010. He has served as an &quot;ambassador for voting rights&quot; for the American Civil Liberties Union since 2013. Since 2022, he has also officially been on the board of directors of the Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library. He had been an honorary member of the board for about 10 years before that.

When not on the road performing, Black resides in Manhattan but also maintains a residence in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

==Early life==
Lewis Black was born on August 30, 1948, in Washington, D.C., the elder son of Jeannette Black (née Kaplan; 1918–2022), a teacher, and Samuel Black (1918–2019), an artist and mechanical engineer. He had a younger brother, Ronald, who died of cancer in 1997 at the age of 47.

He is Jewish and was raised in a middle-class Jewish family in the Burnt Mills neighborhood of Silver Spring, Maryland. His grandparents emigrated from the Russian Empire, including Chornyi Ostriv in Ukraine and Białystok in Poland and his paternal grandfather was originally named Leib Blech, later changed to Louis Black. Black graduated from Springbrook High School in 1966.

Black recounts in his book &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Sacred&quot; that he scored highly on the math section of his SAT exam and later applied to Yale, Princeton, Brown, Amherst, Williams and Georgetown. Every college he applied to except Georgetown rejected him, but by that point he had decided he did not want to go there, so he attended the University of Maryland, College Park for one year before transferring to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There, he studied playwriting and was a brother of Pi Lambda Phi International fraternity and a member of Student Congress. After graduating in 1970, Black moved to Colorado Springs with a group of performers based in Chapel Hill, purchased an old log cabin theater and attempted to establish a theater company. Calling themselves the Homestead Arts Theatre, the group performed regionally at parks, schools, and prisons, but were unable to open the theater due to code violations. He eventually returned to Washington where he worked at the Appalachian Regional Commission, wrote plays, and performed stand-up comedy at the Brickskeler in Dupont Circle.

He earned an MFA degree at the Yale School of Drama in 1977, and was married for ten months when he was 26 years old.

Black&#x27;s career began in theater as a playwright; however, he has stated that he was always doing stand-up &quot;on the side.&quot; He served as the playwright-in-residence and associate artistic director of Steve Olsen&#x27;s West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen in New York City, where he collaborated with composer and lyricist Rusty Magee and artistic director Rand Foerster on hundreds of one-act plays from 1981 to 1989. Also with Rusty Magee, Black wrote the musical &quot;The Czar of Rock and Roll&quot;, which premiered at Houston&#x27;s Alley Theatre in 1990. Black&#x27;s stand-up comedy began as an opening act for the plays; he was also the master of ceremonies. After a management change at the theater, Black left and began working as a comedian, as well as finding bit parts in television and films.

==Comedic style==
Black lists his comedic influences as George Carlin, Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, Lily Tomlin, Bob Newhart and Shelley Berman.

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy===
In 1994, Black appeared on &quot;A&amp;E&#x27;s An Evening at the Improv&quot;.

In 1998, Black starred in his first comedy special on the series &quot;Comedy Central Presents.&quot; He starred in two additional episodes of the series in 2000 and 2002. He starred in another special for the network in 2002, titled &quot;Taxed Beyond Belief&quot;. In 2004 and 2005, Black hosted the World Stupidity Awards ceremony at Montreal&#x27;s Just for Laughs comedy festival. In 2004, he had an HBO stand-up special titled &quot;Black on Broadway.&quot; Black hosted Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Last Laugh &#x27;07&quot;, which aired on December 2, 2007, along with Dave Attell and D.L. Hughley.

In 2006, Black performed at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C. for an HBO special, &quot;Red, White, and Screwed&quot;. It aired in June and a DVD was released in October. When explaining his choice of venue, Black said that &quot;some asshole&quot; was paid to count the number of times the word &quot;fuck&quot; was said in his previous HBO special, &quot;Black On Broadway&quot;, and that the original location, the Kennedy Center, wanted him to cut back on its use. Black was told the number was 42, when actually it was approximately 78.

Black received a 2007 Grammy Award for &quot;Best Comedy Album&quot; for his album &quot;The Carnegie Hall Performance&quot;. He hosted the Comedy Central television series &quot;The Root of All Evil&quot; in 2008. The show pitted two people or pop-culture topics against each other as a panel of comedians argued, in the style of a court trial, which is more evil, e.g., &quot;Paris Hilton vs. Dick Cheney&quot; and &quot;Internet Porn vs. YouTube&quot;. After hearing arguments from both sides, Black, acting as judge, made the final decision as to which is more evil. In 2008, Black hosted &quot;History of the Joke with Lewis Black&quot;, a 2-hour comedy-documentary on The History Channel.

Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Stand-Up Month&quot; in 2008 featured specials originally presented on HBO by Black, along with programs featuring Dane Cook and Chris Rock. That year, as part of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Stand-Up Month&quot;, Black&#x27;s routine finished at #5 on &quot;Stand-Up Showdown 2008&quot;, a viewer-based countdown of the top Comedy Central Presents routine. In 2009, Black filmed two shows at the Fillmore Theater in Detroit, Michigan. These were the basis for the concert film &quot;Stark Raving Black&quot;, which appeared in theaters for a limited time in October, and was released on video the next year. At the end of 2009, Black returned to the History Channel to host &quot;Surviving the Holidays with Lewis Black&quot;, in which he discussed the year-end pressures of Thanksgiving, Channukah, Christmas, and New Year&#x27;s.

In 2011, Black filmed two shows at the State Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The shows were used for Black&#x27;s comedy special &quot;In God We Rust&quot;. The special premiered on Epix HD. An extended and uncensored version of the special was released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 11, 2011.

In August 2013, Black recorded his ninth stand-up special &quot;Old Yeller: Live at the Borgata&quot;. &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Black and the company that was releasing the stand-up special, Image Entertainment, would later air it in the form of pay-per-view and VOD, making it the first comedy special to air simultaneously on all cable, satellite and telco platforms.

In October 2020, Black released his fourteenth stand-up special, &quot;Thanks for Risking Your Life&quot;, live at the Four Winds New Buffalo casino. The special was filmed at the start of the COVID-19 lockdown and reflects that in material.

===Film and television career===
====On the screen====

Black appeared in episode 25 &quot;Aria&quot; (1991) of &quot;Law and Order&quot; as porn director Franklin Frome, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; episode &quot;Obscene&quot; (2004) as a shock jock, and in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; episode &quot;The Jiminy Conjecture&quot; (2009) as Professor Crawley, an entomologist. He also released his autobiography, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Sacred&quot;, in 2005. Since November 9, 2005, Black has been making appearances in small segments on &quot;The Weather Channel.&quot; In December 2005, he appeared in an animated holiday special &quot;The Happy Elf&quot;, as the voice of the extremely tightly wound elf, Norbert.

In the film &quot;Accepted&quot;, a film about high school graduates who create a college when they fail to get accepted into any, he played Dean Ben Lewis of the school &quot;South Harmon Institute of Technology&quot;. He also appeared in the 2006 films &quot;Man of the Year&quot; and &quot;Unaccompanied Minors&quot;. Black hosted Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Last Laugh &#x27;06&quot;, which aired on December 10, 2006.

====Voice====
Black was the voice of &quot;Manobrain&quot; during the third season of the Cartoon Network series &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot;. He was the inventor of a diet pill which was stolen while he was in college. He blamed the theft on his college friend Dr. I. Q. Hi, not realizing that the actual thief was Duck Dodgers. The theft set Manobrain on the path of evil.

He provided the voice of the Deadly Duplicator in four episodes of the Adult Swim show &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; and in the video game based on the show.

Black provided the voice of oxpecker Ted in the &quot;My Gym Partner&#x27;s a Monkey&quot; episode, &quot;Hornbill and Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;. The character is portrayed in the same fashion as his comedy shows, though without profanity. In addition, the bird&#x27;s clothes, looks, and mannerisms resemble his.

He also voiced Mr. E/Ricky Owens in &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot; and for &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; played a middle-aged man named Vic who is kidnapped by the Kraang and mutated into a spider-like monster called &quot;Spider-Bytez&quot; by Michelangelo.

Black voiced Anger in the Pixar films &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;Inside Out 2&quot;.

He also guest starred as the voice of Santa Claus in the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episodes &quot;Goons on the Moon&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob&#x27;s Road to Christmas&quot; and would reprise the role in spinoff series &quot;Kamp Koral: SpongeBob&#x27;s Under Years&quot;.

===Tours===
On June 18, 2007, he sat in with Southern rock/Jam band Gov&#x27;t Mule at the 6th annual Bonnaroo music festival, where he had performed earlier that weekend, for what was to be a quick joke. A member of the audience threw a bottle at Black, which struck him. Black was upset and he encouraged the audience to boo the heckler before leaving the stage in disgust, while shouting obscenities at the heckler. This act was seen in an episode of &quot;Lewis Black&#x27;s Root of All Evil&quot; titled &quot;YouTube vs. simply&quot;.

On June 29, 2007, Black gave a benefit show at Springbrook High School, his alma mater, in the school&#x27;s auditorium for 1,100 alumni, faculty, and students. He performed in his usual style, stopping at points to remark how good it felt to use that language on that particular stage. At the end of the show he was given a Springbrook football jersey, and cursed at one teacher for giving him a B and causing him not to graduate first in his class.

In mid-December 2007, Black went with Robin Williams, Kid Rock, Lance Armstrong and Rachel Smith, Miss USA 2007, on a United Service Organizations trip to support the troops in Iraq and Kuwait. The last show was on December 22 at the U.S Naval Station in Rota, Spain. In 2008, Black went on tour to promote his book &quot;Me of Little Faith&quot;. Black did a stand-up tour called &quot;Let Them Eat Cake&quot;, with material from that tour being featured on his comedy album &quot;Anticipation&quot;. Beginning in January 2010, Black embarked on a new tour called &quot;In God We Rust&quot;.

== Legal issues ==
In 2000, Black and fellow comedian Jim Norton were arrested for their involvement with &quot;The Naked Teen Voyeur Bus&quot;, a specially designed bus with acrylic glass walls containing numerous 18- and 19-year-old topless women. This bus was driven around Manhattan while reports about it were broadcast on the &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; radio show. The radio station management did not inform the O&amp;A show that the bus&#x27;s route was also the route that President Bill Clinton was using that day. Twenty-eight hours after their arrest, Black and Norton were released. Black appeared on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; the following night where he stated he was exercising his constitutional rights. He then joked that the location of this particular right was unclear, but that it was &quot;between &#x27;all men are created equal&#x27; and &#x27;don&#x27;t shit where you eat.&#x27;

<text>The , the seventh Paralympic Winter Games, were held alongside the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Nagano Prefecture, Japan, from 5 to 14 March 1998. They were the first Paralympic Winter Games to be held in Asia. 571 athletes competed in Nagano; as 2022 it remains the highest number of athletes competing at any Winter Paralympics.

==Bidding Process==
When Nagano City was selected as the host city for the 1998 Winter Olympic Games on June 15, 1991, other demands arose, both from the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and from other parties, so that the city could also host what was called &quot;other Olympics&quot; also scheduled for that year.On November 8, 1991, the IPC sent an official document inviting Nagano to host the 8th edition of the Winter Paralympic Games and on July 30, 1992, the Bid Committee for the 1998 Winter Paralympics was launched. The Promotion Council was chaired by the president of the Japan Sports Association for the Disabled, and consisted of 13 committee members and two observers. The head of the welfare department from the Nagano City was appointed, and he was in charge of promoting the bid project.

The bidding board was chaired by the president of the Japan Sports Association for the Physically Disabled and consisted of 13 committee members and two observers.

On June 25, 1993, the Nagano City Council passed a resolution to host the Winter Paralympic Games, and around the same time, the prefectural assembly and the relevant town and village assemblies also passed resolutions to host the games, and preparations for hosting the games began in earnest. The Nagano Winter Paralympic Games Promotion Council submitted an application to the IPC to host the games on July 23 of the same year, and on September 10, at the 4th IPC General Assembly held in Berlin, Nagano was selected as the host city for the 1998 Winter Paralympic Games. However, the city would still have to wait 6 months for the host city contract to be signed. Something that happened on March 7, 1994, when there were 3 days left before the opening ceremony of the 6th edition, which would be held in Lillehammer, in Norway.

On November 16, 1993, the Nagano Winter Paralympic Games Organizing Committee (NAPOC) was established, and full-scale activities for hosting the games began. On November 30 of the same year, Nagano City launched the Nagano City Olympic and Paralympic Liaison and Coordination Committee to acting as joint preparations. The committee was chaired by the deputy mayor Tasuku Tsukada, consisted of the heads of related departments within the city government, and had nine divisions, including a public relations division. Despite this, some steps needed to be overcome. On April 1, 1995, a Paralympic Management sector was established within the city Disability Welfare Division in order to carry out operations in a more professional manner.

==Preparations==
The same delegation that was in Lillehammer to participate in the signing ceremony of the host city contract in Norway was present at the closing ceremony and received the Paralympic flag from the mayor of Lillehammer on March 19, 1994 and three days later on March 22 of that year, there was an official ceremony to receive the Paralympic flag.This was the first public main event to raise public awareness and understanding of the Games, and the construction of the Paralympic Village in Kawanakajima Imai, to meet the needs of people with disabilities.In addition, various citizen groups promoted projects to create a people-friendly town, where they conducted surveys to find out what problems people with various disabilities face in living a safe and comfortable life, and proposed countermeasures.
After that, on June 17, 1996, 600 days before the 1998 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremonies, a joint management committee in which the common areas of the two events were merged, with the then mayor Tasuku Tsukada assuming the presidency of both and also exercising the coordination and intermediation function and the city divided the work of dispatching staff to the Games into eight departments: general affairs, facilities, environment, culture, spectators, transportation, Olympic venues, and Paralympic venues, and the organizing work started.After this event, the first measure action for the NAPOC was relative to the provide financial assistance, including operating subsidies, amounting to over ¥1.21 billion; second, to have the mayor and other city executives assumed the posts of vice-chairs and organizing committee members of NAPOC and in their respective functions; and third, to dispatch a total of 51 city employees to promote the work of NAPOC both before and after its establishment. In addition to this, 465 long-term and short-term support staff were dispatched to each venue during the Games. Another total of 64 people were dispatched from the Fire Department for acting during the Games.

Is also noted that there was an expansion of several programs designed for the Olympic Games for the Paralympic Games in order to expand the involvement of the local population in relation to the two events: one of them was &quot;One School, One Country&quot; and poster, painting, writing, drawing and slogan competitions for high school students.The &quot;Happy Nagano Campaign&quot; was also held, which included providing free pork soup to the general public and making souvenirs which were being sold to help finance various social projects.The engagement of the local population was so great that other groups and committees were created to provide support in other activities, such as the Nagano Paralympic Countdown Event Executive Committee, and the Nagano Paralympic Games Support Executive Committee. Among them, the &quot;Nagano Para-Volunteer Association&quot; was an organization made up of groups of people with disabilities and the volunteer groups that support them, and attracted attention for its unique activities, mainly in Nagano City, with the goal of &quot;encouraging the Paralympic athletes and raising awareness of people with disabilities from a free perspective as citizens of the host city.&quot;It was said that the special ceremonies held at the milestones of 1000 days, 2 years, 500 days, 300 days, 100 days and the 50 days countdown, had the focus to awareness-raising activities were effective in livening up the Games and increasing citizens&#x27; sense of participation.The Nagano Public Relations magazine also played a major role in raising awareness of the Paralympics.

===Visual Identity===
The philosophy of the Nagano Paralympic Winter Games was &quot;To bring together physically disabled people from around the world, to expand the circle of friendship and international goodwill through sports, a culture shared by all mankind, to discover new possibilities, and to inspire bright hope and courage,&quot; and the main slogan of the Games is &quot;Interaction and Inspiration.&quot; The another main slogan was chosen through public submissions, and was &quot;Spreading, Communicating, and Rising Emotions,&quot; with the sub-slogans &quot;You Shine in the Winter of &#x27;98 in Nagano,&quot; and &quot;Shining Now, the Joy of Living, and Challenging Nagano.&quot; The symbol mark is an abbreviation of the character &quot;Nagano&quot; (cho) and depicts a rabbit running around happily and speedily on the snow and ice, enjoying the sport. The nickname of the mascot, created based on the symbol mark of the Games, was &quot;Parabit.&quot;

==Mascot==
The 1998 Winter Paralympics Mascot was Parabbit. Parabbit is a white rabbit with one green and one red ear. Parabbit was chosen to complement the logo of the 1998 Winter Paralympics. It was created by Sadahiko Kojima.
A nationwide competition was held among students to decide on the name, which drew 10,057 entries suggesting 3,408 different names.

==Torch Relay==
The torch for the Nagano Paralympics was lit by japanese traditional methods on February 25, 1998 at Yoyogi Park Stadium, in Tokyo as legacy sign from the 1964 Summer Paralympics. After stops in Kanagawa Prefecture, Yokohama City, Shizuoka Prefecture, Aichi Prefecture, Nagoya City, and Gifu Prefecture, the torch arrived on Nagano prefecture in Iida on February 26, where it was split in two. From there, it was carried to Nagano City by 125 relay teams from all cities, towns, and villages in the prefecture in two routes, from east and west. The flames were gathered at Nagano Central Square on March 4, evening, the day before the opening ceremony.The final stage began in the morning of the next day, when 24 teams made up of 3 people took turns until the evening of that day when the torch arrived at night during the opening ceremony being held on M-Wave.Two pyres were built for the Games. One was the stage cauldron for the opening ceremony and another was permanent who burned until the end of the Games.A total of 754 relay runners covered 118.1km during the torch relay.

==Opening ceremony==

The opening ceremony was held at M-Wave from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm on March 5. Based on the theme of &quot;HOPE,&quot; and was inspired by a painting by George Frederic Watts. The theme also signifies it was the first Winter Paralympics held in Asia and the last Paralympics of the 20th century.The ceremony was divided into two parts, a ceremony and a festival, and &quot;fire (the Paralympic flame)&quot; appeared as an important motif. It was an inspiring opening ceremony attended by approximately 1,150 athletes and officials, and approximately 7,700 spectators. The producers in charge of the production were Nagano-born composer Joe Hisaishi (general producer) and four others.The first part of the ceremony was the protocol: overture and fanfare, entrance of the athletes, speech by the president of NAPOC, opening declaration, entrance and hoisting of the IPC flag, entrance and lighting of the torch, oath of athletes and judges, and playing of the national anthem. The second part of the ceremony was performed in the following order: Hope (Hoshi no Sato), Fire (Hino Sato), Chaos (Kontono), Finale (Tabidachi) .

==The cauldron==

This was the last time that the organization of the Paralympic Games did not use the official Olympic cauldron, as the locations of the Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies were different. A scenographic cauldron was used during the opening ceremonies and thus, outside the M-Wave the organizers decided to build a second cauldron who reproduced the cauldron that is annually set up in Nozawaonsen village for the Sagichō Fire Festival. To allow the flame to burn continuously, people associated with the Dosojin Fire Festival lit the cauldron outside the stadium.As the Olympic Games,smaller cauldrons were also lit in Yamanouchi and Nozawaonsen .

==Closing Ceremonies==

The closing ceremony of the Nagano Paralympics was held at M-Wave from 6:30 to 8:00 p.m. on March 14, 1998. The theme of the event was &quot;Hope and Legacy,&quot; and was directed and created by actor Mansaku Nomura, who developed an event in which arts from across Asia and Japan mixed elements of Noh and Kyogen, two of the four forms of classical Japanese theater, and it was structured without distinguishing between a ceremony and a festival, with a new performing art &quot; in a traditional Dengaku event &quot; With the participation of about 1,150 athletes and officials, and about 8,000 spectators, the ceremony proceeded solemnly and movingly in the following order: entry of the athletes, raising of the national flags, dragon dance, and the protocol segments.The ceremony ended with the extinguishing of the Paralympic cauldron to the sound of &quot;Ue o Muite Arukō&quot; by Susan Osbourne.

It is noteworthy that the organizers of the Games, during the pre-production of the ceremony, asked by the official website, newspapers and the television to the Japanese population to send Orizuru made of paper to decorate the M-Wave as a wish of good luck for the future of the Paralympic Games.The paper crane is one of most know and traditional symbols. The initial target of a million was quickly passed and the stadium was decorated with 7.5 million cranes from 350,000 groups and individuals.

<doc id="333159" wikidata="Q158093" url="?curid=333159" title="National Front (UK)">
<text>The National Front (NF) is a far-right, fascist political party in the United Kingdom. It is currently led by Tony Martin. A minor party, it has never had its representatives elected to the British or European Parliaments, although it gained a small number of local councillors through defections and it has had a few of its representatives elected to community councils. Founded in 1967, it reached the height of its electoral support during the mid-1970s, when it was briefly England&#x27;s fourth-largest party in terms of vote share.

The NF was founded by A. K. Chesterton, formerly of the British Union of Fascists, as a merger between his League of Empire Loyalists and the British National Party. It was soon joined by the Greater Britain Movement, whose leader John Tyndall became the Front&#x27;s chairman in 1972. Under Tyndall&#x27;s leadership it capitalised on growing concern about South Asian migration to Britain, rapidly increasing its membership and vote share in the urban areas of east London and northern England. Its public profile was raised through street marches and rallies, which often resulted in violent clashes with anti-fascist protesters, most notably the 1974 Red Lion Square disorders and the 1977 Battle of Lewisham. In 1982, Tyndall left the National Front to form a new British National Party (BNP). Many NF members defected to Tyndall&#x27;s BNP, contributing to a substantial decline in the Front&#x27;s electoral support. During the 1980s, the NF split in two; the Flag NF retained the older ideology, while the Official NF adopted a Third Positionist stance before disbanding in 1990. In 1995, the Flag NF&#x27;s leadership transformed the party into the National Democrats, although a small splinter group retained the NF name.

Ideologically positioned on the extreme right or far-right of British politics, the NF has been characterised as fascist or neo-fascist by political scientists. Different factions have dominated the party at different times, each with its own ideological bent, including neo-Nazis, Strasserites and racial populists. The party espouses the ethnic nationalist view that only white people should be citizens of the United Kingdom. The NF calls for an end to non-white migration into the UK and for settled non-white Britons to be stripped of their citizenship and deported. A white supremacist party, it promotes biological racism and the white genocide conspiracy theory, calling for global racial separatism and condemning interracial relationships and miscegenation. It espouses anti-semitic conspiracy theories, endorsing Holocaust denial and claiming that Jews dominate the world through both communism and finance capitalism. It promotes economic protectionism, hard Euroscepticism and a transformation away from liberal democracy, while its social policies oppose feminism, LGBT rights and societal permissiveness.

After the BNP, the NF has been the most successful far-right group in British politics since the Second World War. During its history, it has established sub-groups such as a trade unionist association, a youth group and the Rock Against Communism musical organisation. Only whites are permitted membership of the party, and in its heyday most of its support came from white British working-class and lower middle-class communities in northern England and east London. The NF has generated vocal opposition from left-wing and anti-fascist groups throughout its history, and NF members are prohibited from various professions.

==History==
===Formation: 1966–1967===
The National Front began as a coalition of small far-right groups active on the fringes of British politics during the 1960s. The resolve to unite them came in early 1966 from A. K. Chesterton, the leader of the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL). He had a long history in the British fascist movement, having been a member of the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in the 1930s. Over the following months, many far-rightists visited Chesterton at his Croydon apartment to discuss the proposal, among them Andrew Fountaine and Philip Maxwell of the British National Party (BNP), David Brown of the Racial Preservation Society (RPS), and John Tyndall and Martin Webster of the Greater Britain Movement (GBM). Although everyone agreed with the idea of unification, personal rivalries made the process difficult.

Chesterton agreed to a merger of the LEL and BNP, and a faction of the RPS decided to join them. Chesterton and the BNP agreed that Tyndall&#x27;s GBM would not be invited to join their new party because of its strong associations with neo-Nazism, as well as the recent arrest of Tyndall and seven other GBM members for illegal weapon possession. Chesterton wanted to keep his new party clear of the crude sloganeering he thought was holding back the far-right&#x27;s electoral success; he later stated that &quot;the man who thinks this is a war that can be won by mouthing slogans about &#x27;dirty Jews&#x27; and &#x27;filthy niggers&#x27; is a maniac whose place should not be in the National Front but in a mental hospital.&quot;

In October 1966, the LEL and BNP established a working committee to determine what policies they could agree on. The committee&#x27;s initial policy platform revolved around opposition to Britain&#x27;s political establishment, anti-communism, support for the white minority governments in Rhodesia and South Africa, a ban on migration into Britain and the expulsion of all settled non-white immigrants. They considered various names for the new party, before settling on &quot;National Front&quot; in December 1966. The National Front (NF) was founded on 7 February 1967, with Chesterton its first chairman. At the time it had approximately 2,500 members, of whom 1,000 were from the BNP, 300 from the LEL and over 100 from the RPS. The historian Richard Thurlow described the NF&#x27;s formation as &quot;the most significant event on the radical right and fascist fringe of British politics&quot; since the internment of the country&#x27;s fascists during the Second World War.

===Early growth: 1968–1972===
The NF&#x27;s first year was marked by a power struggle between the ex-LEL and ex-BNP factions. The former were unhappy with the behaviour of ex-BNP members, such as their propensity for political chanting, while the ex-BNP faction criticised Chesterton&#x27;s elitist pretensions. At the invitation of the ex-BNP faction, in June 1967, Tyndall discontinued the GBM and called on its members to join the NF. Despite his own earlier commitment to keep Tyndall out, Chesterton welcomed him into the party. Tyndall&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Spearhead&quot;—originally sold as &quot;an organ of National Socialist [i.e. Nazi] opinion in Britain&quot;—dropped its open neo-Nazism and backed the NF, eventually becoming the party&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; monthly magazine.

The party held its first annual conference in October 1967; it was picketed by anti-fascists. In 1968, Chesterton&#x27;s leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Fountaine, who then left the party. There were further internal arguments after its lease on its Westminster headquarters ended. Ex-LEL members wanted another base in central London, while the ex-GBM and ex-BNP factions favoured moving into the GBM&#x27;s old headquarters in Tulse Hill. Chesterton backed the ex-LEL position, and offered a small office in Fleet Street. In April 1968, immigration became the foremost political topic in the national media after the Conservative Party politician Enoch Powell made his Rivers of Blood speech, an appeal against non-white immigration into Britain. Although Powell proposed more moderate measures for expelling migrants than the NF, his use of language was similar to theirs, and some individuals on the right-wing of the Conservatives defected to the NF.

The NF fielded 45 candidates in the 1969 local elections and averaged a poll of 8%, although a few secured over 10%. The party focused on these latter seats in the 1970 local elections, fielding 10 candidates; almost all received under 5% of the vote. The party faced militant left-wing opposition, including the driving of a lorry into its Tulse Hill building in 1969, and to counter this the NF installed a spy in London&#x27;s anti-fascist movement. Against Chesterton&#x27;s wishes, NF activists carried out publicity stunts: in 1968 they marched onto a London Weekend Television show uninvited and in 1969 assaulted two Labour Party ministers. While Chesterton was holidaying in South Africa, a faction led by Gordon Brown—formerly of Tyndall&#x27;s GBM—launched a leadership challenge against him. On realising that his support was weak, Chesterton resigned. He was succeeded by John O&#x27;Brien in February 1971. Frustrated that Tyndall maintained links with neo-Nazi groups like the Northern League, O&#x27;Brien and his supporters ultimately left the NF for the National Independence Party in June 1972.

===Tyndall&#x27;s first leadership: 1972–1975===
Tyndall became party chairman in July 1972, centralising the NF&#x27;s activities at a new Croydon headquarters. According to Thurlow, under Tyndall the NF attempted to &quot;convert racial populists&quot; angry about immigration &quot;into fascists&quot;. In his history of fascism, Roger Eatwell noted that with Tyndall as chair, &quot;the NF tried hard to hide its neo-Nazism from public view, fearing it might damage popular support.&quot; Refocusing its appeal towards the white working class, in June 1974 it launched the NF Trade Unionists Association. Britain&#x27;s leftists fought back by publicising the neo-Nazi past of senior NF members, including photographs of Tyndall wearing a Nazi uniform.

The NF capitalised on fears surrounding the arrival of Ugandan Asian refugees in 1972, resulting in rapid growth of its membership. At the 1973 West Bromwich by-election it gained 16% of the vote, passing the 10% mark in a parliamentary election for the first time, something that brought greater media coverage. 54 candidates were fielded at the February 1974 general election, a number that guaranteed them a party political broadcast. It contested six times as many seats as in 1970, averaging a vote share of 3.2%, slightly less than in 1970. By the mid-1970s, the NF&#x27;s membership had stagnated and in several areas declined; all of its 90 candidates for the October 1974 general election lost their deposits. In the 1975 local elections they fielded 60 candidates, far fewer than in previous elections.

A faction known as the &quot;Populists&quot; emerged in the party under Roy Painter&#x27;s leadership. They were frustrated that the NF&#x27;s directorate was dominated by former BNP and GBM members and believed that Tyndall remained a neo-Nazi. They ensured John Kingsley Read&#x27;s election as chairman, with Tyndall demoted to vice chair. Growing strife between the Tyndallites and Populists broke out; Read and the executive committee suspended Tyndall and nine of his supporters from the directorate, before expelling Tyndall from the party. Tyndall took the issue to the High Court, where his expulsion was declared illegal. In frustration at their inability to eject Tyndall and the Tyndallites, Read and his supporters split from the NF to form the National Party (NP) in December 1975.

===Tyndall&#x27;s second leadership: 1976–1982===
In February 1976, Tyndall was restored as the NF leader. The party then capitalised on public anger at the government&#x27;s agreement to accept Malawian Asian refugees, and held demonstrations against their arrival. After a resurgence in fortunes in London at the 1977 GLC election, when the party improved on its October 1974 general election result, further marches were planned in the city. These included a march through Lewisham in August 1977, where clashes with anti-fascists became known as the &quot;Battle of Lewisham&quot;.

In the 1979 general election, the NF contested more seats than any insurgent party since Labour in 1918. It nevertheless performed badly, securing only 1.3% of the total vote, down from 3.1% in the October 1974 general election. This decline may have been due to increased anti-fascist campaigning over preceding years, or because of the Conservatives&#x27; increasingly restrictive stance on immigration under Margaret Thatcher attracted many votes that previously went to the Front. NF membership had also declined.

Although Tyndall and Webster had been longstanding comrades, in the late 1970s Tyndall began to blame his old friend for the party&#x27;s problems. Tyndall was upset with Webster&#x27;s attempts to encourage far-right skinheads and football hooligans to join the NF, as well as allegations that Webster had been making sexual advances toward the party&#x27;s young men. In October 1979 he urged the NF directorate to call for Webster&#x27;s resignation, but was refused. Tyndall resigned in January 1980, complaining of a &quot;foul stench of perversion&quot; in the party. In June, he founded the New National Front (NNF), which claimed that a third of the NF&#x27;s membership defected to it.

===Strasserites and the Flag Group: 1983–1990===
After Tyndall&#x27;s departure, Andrew Brons became party chair, with Webster remaining as National Activities Organiser. Webster was ousted from all paid positions in 1983 by a faction led by Nick Griffin and Joe Pearce. In May 1985, this faction – who adhered to the Strasserite variant of Nazism – secured control of the party&#x27;s directorate and suspended the membership of their opponents. Their focus was not on electoral success but on developing an activist elite consisting largely of working-class urban youths; its supporters became known as &quot;Political Soldiers&quot;. The Strasserites officially reformulated their party along a centralised cadre system at the November 1986 AGM. Their ideology was influenced by their strong links with members of an Italian fascist militia, the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari (NAR), who were hiding in London after the Bologna massacre. Like the NAR, the NF Strasserites emphasised the far-right ideology of the Third Position, which they presented as being opposed to both capitalism and Marxist-oriented socialism. They were also influenced by the Nouvelle Droite, a French far-right movement that advocated long-term strategies of cultural influence to achieve their goals.

The Strasserites described themselves as &quot;radical, youthful and successful&quot;, contrasting their approach with the &quot;out-dated conservative policies&quot; of their internal opponents. These opponents then formed a rival organisation, the Flag Group, which adopted the name &quot;National Front&quot; in January 1987. According to Eatwell, the Flag NF &quot;was essentially a continuation of the racial-populist tradition&quot; used by earlier forms of the party. It had more working-class leaders than the Strasserite group and regarded the latter as intellectuals pursuing foreign ideological fads. There remained two organisations claiming the name of National Front—that controlled by the Flag Group and the Strasserites&#x27; Official National Front—until 1990. In contrast to the Strasserite NF&#x27;s increased centralisation, the Flag Group gave autonomy to its branches, focusing on local issues. Following the NF&#x27;s declining vote share in the late 1970s, both groups had effectively abandoned interest in electoral participation.

Reflecting the Nouvelle Droite&#x27;s influence, the Strasserite Official NF promoted support for &quot;a broad front of racialists of all colours&quot; who were seeking an end to multi-racial society and capitalism, praising black nationalists like Louis Farrakhan and Marcus Garvey. Their publication, &quot;Nationalism Today&quot;, featured positive articles on the Libyan and Iranian governments, presenting them as part of a global anti-capitalist and anti-Marxist third force; they may have also seen Libya and Iran as potential sources of funding. This new ideology alienated many NF members. The Official NF experienced internal problems and in 1989 Griffin, Derek Holland and Colin Todd split from it to establish the International Third Position. In March 1990 the Official NF was disbanded by its leaders, Patrick Harrington, Graham Williamson and David Kerr, who replaced it with a new organisation, the Third Way. This left the Flag Group as the only party using the National Front banner.

===Further decline: 1990–present===
During the 1990s, the NF was eclipsed by Tyndall&#x27;s new British National Party (BNP) as Britain&#x27;s foremost far-right movement. Following the Lansdowne Road football riot of 1995, in which English far-right hooligans attacked Irish supporters, the NF&#x27;s chairman Ian Anderson attempted to escape the negative associations of the name &quot;National Front&quot; by renaming the party as the National Democrats. A small faction broke away to retain the National Front name, contesting the 1997 and 2001 general elections, with little success. By 2001, the NF had developed close links with Combat 18, a neo-Nazi paramilitary which had been founded by Tyndall&#x27;s BNP before breaking from the latter. The Front continued to organise rallies, several of which were banned by successive Home Secretaries.

A 2010 High Court ruling forced the BNP to remove a clause from its constitution prohibiting non-white membership, leading to defections to the NF. After the English Defence League (EDL), an Islamophobic social movement, emerged in 2009, the NF pursued links but was rebuffed by the EDL, which sought to distance itself from the Front and other established far-right groups. As the EDL declined in the following years, the NF collaborated with some of the groups that had split from it, like the North West Infidels and South East Alliance. In March 2015 Kevin Bryan became the NF&#x27;s chair. After Bryan was injured in a car accident he was replaced by Dave MacDonald in November 2015, with Tony Martin taking over in September 2018.

The NF has not put forward a single candidate in any election since the 2015 United Kingdom general election.

==Ideology==
===Far-right politics, fascism and neo-Nazism===
A far-right or extreme-right party, the NF has both commonalities and differences with older far-right groups. Political scientists and historians characterise it as fascist, or neo-fascist, with the historian Martin Durham stating that the NF—like France&#x27;s National Front and Germany&#x27;s The Republicans—represented &quot;the direct descendants of classical fascism&quot;. The political psychologist Michael Billig notes that the NF displayed many of fascism&#x27;s recurring traits: an emphasis on nationalism and racism, an anti-Marxist stance, statism and support for private enterprise, and a hostile view of democracy and personal freedom.

Rejecting the term &quot;fascist&quot; to describe itself, the NF sought to conceal its connections to older fascist movements, denying its leaders&#x27; previous fascist activities. It claimed that it could not be fascist because it took part in elections; the political scientist Stan Taylor argues that this claim was obsolete, for many earlier fascist parties—including the BUF, the German Nazi Party and the Italian National Fascist Party—also contested elections. In avoiding the &quot;fascist&quot; label, the NF was typical of fascist groups operating after the Second World War; having to contend with the legacy of the war and the Holocaust, they tried to hide their intellectual pedigrees from voters.

As with many political extremists, the image the NF presented to the public was more moderate than the ideology of its inner core of members. As noted by Billig, the NF&#x27;s &quot;ideological core and its genocidal tendencies, are hidden&quot; so as not to scare off potential recruits sympathetic to its nationalism and anti-immigration stance but not its antisemitic conspiracy theories. While noting that the party&#x27;s views on race departed considerably &quot;from what is normal or acceptable to the average citizen&quot; in the UK, the political scientist Nigel Fielding observes that many of its other views were grounded in what would be considered &quot;popular common-sense opinion&quot; across the political right.

====Factions====
During its history, the NF contained various factions with distinct ideological positions. From the party&#x27;s early days until the 1980 Tyndall/Webster split, its ideology was dominated by the ex-GBM faction. According to Thurlow, the ex-GBM faction oversaw &quot;an attempt to portray the essentials of Nazi ideology in more rational language and seemingly reasonable arguments&quot;, while Wilkinson observed that this faction&#x27;s leadership was &quot;deeply imbued with Nazi ideas&quot; and retained &quot;intimate connections&quot; with both domestic and foreign neo-Nazi groups. Taylor also regarded the NF of the 1970s as a Nazi organisation because of its fixation on antisemitic conspiracy theories. In his words, the NF&#x27;s &quot;full ideology&quot; was, &quot;in a large number of respects&quot;, identical to the original German Nazism.

According to Thurlow, the members of the &quot;Populist&quot; faction that challenged the ex-GBM faction&#x27;s dominance in the late 1970s were &quot;pseudo-Conservative racial populists&quot;, representing the party&#x27;s &quot;non-fascist and ostensibly more democratic element&quot;. After Tyndall and Webster were ousted and replaced by Brons and Anderson, a new faction took control whose members regarded themselves as Strasserite, drawing inspiration from German Nazi Party members Otto Strasser and Gregor Strasser. This faction embraced the Third Position ideology and drew inspiration from Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s Third International Theory.

===Ethnic nationalism, racism and eugenics===
The National Front is a British nationalist party; its early policy statements declared that it &quot;pledged to work for the restoration of full national sovereignty for Britain in all affairs&quot;. It rejected internationalism and thus opposed both liberalism and communism, contrasting their internationalist espousal of universal values with its view that nations should have their own distinct values. Labelling itself a racial nationalist party, the NF&#x27;s concept of nationalism was bound up with that of race. NF members typically referred to themselves as &quot;racialists&quot;, with Durham stating that the NF was &quot;undeniably a racist organisation&quot;. The party claimed that humanity divides into biologically distinct races with their own physical and social characteristics. Although some of its published material referred only to &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; races, elsewhere it listed various racial groups, among them the &quot;Nordics&quot;, &quot;Caucasoids&quot;, &quot;Negroids&quot;, &quot;Semites&quot; and &quot;Turco-Armonoids&quot;. It claimed that within racial groups can be found &quot;nations&quot;, a form of &quot;race within a race&quot;; many party activists nevertheless used the terms &quot;race&quot; and &quot;nation&quot; interchangeably.

The NF claimed the existence of a distinct British racial &quot;nation&quot;, all the members of which shared common interests; Welsh and Scottish nationalisms were condemned as threats to British racial unity. It viewed class as a false distinction among the British nation, rejecting the concept of class war as &quot;nonsense&quot;, and—like most fascist groups—tried to attract support across class boundaries. For the NF, patriotism was deemed essential to the cohesion of the British nation, with nationalism regarded as a vital component of patriotism. Members regarded themselves as patriots, and the party made heavy use of British patriotic symbols like the Union Flag and Remembrance Day.

Fielding believed that the &quot;dialectic of insiders and outsiders&quot; was the &quot;linchpin of its ideology&quot;, and noted that the NF&#x27;s &quot;rigid boundaries between in-group and out-group&quot; were typical of the far-right. In its 1974 electoral manifesto, the NF called for a &quot;vigorous birth-rate&quot; among the white British, claiming that any ensuing overpopulation of the UK could be resolved by emigration to the British Commonwealth. Tyndall defended Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;lebensraum&quot; policy, and under his leadership the NF promoted imperialist views about expanding British territory to create &quot;living space&quot; for the country&#x27;s growing population. The party also promoted eugenics, calling for the improvement of the quality as well as the quantity of the white British people. Under Tyndall, it called for the sterilisation of those with genetically transmittable disabilities. By 2011, the party&#x27;s website was utilising the Fourteen Words slogan: &quot;We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.&quot;

===White supremacism===
A white supremacist party, the NF rejected the concept of racial equality. It argued that different races can be ranked hierarchically based on differing abilities, and that the &quot;higher races&quot; compete for world domination. It believed that racial segregation was natural and ordained by God, but that non-whites had been encouraged to migrate to Britain and other white-majority countries to breed with the indigenous inhabitants and thus bring about &quot;white genocide&quot; through assimilation. 
It opposed inter-racial marriage and miscegenation—typically referring to the latter as &quot;mongrelisation&quot;—and displayed particular anxiety about black men seducing white women. It claimed its racial prejudice arose from a natural desire for racial preservation rather than hatred of other races.

The NF claimed that most non-white racial groups were inferior to &quot;Caucasoids and Mongoloids&quot;. In the mid-1970s, Tyndall used &quot;Spearhead&quot; to claim that &quot;the negro has a smaller brain and a much less complex cerebral structure&quot; than whites; in the early 1980s, &quot;Nationalism Today&quot; carried articles maintaining that black Africans had lower average IQs than whites and thus were unfit &quot;to go to white schools&quot; or &quot;live in white society&quot;. Its published material presented black people as dirty and unhygienic, infected with disease and incapable of governing themselves. &quot;Spearhead&quot; featured references to black people being cannibals; at least one article claimed they ate dirt and faeces.

The NF sought academic support for its views, placing great importance on scientific racist publications. Its booklist offered academic and quasi-academic books endorsing scientific racism; early party literature often referenced the work of Hans Eysenck, William Shockley, Arthur Jensen and Richard Herrnstein, while &quot;Spearhead&quot; and other NF publications repeatedly cited articles from the &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot;. In citing these studies, the party claimed that its views were scientific, although Fielding observed that the NF&#x27;s racial views relied &quot;as much on blind assertion, on faith, as on &#x27;scientific&#x27; sources&quot;.

===Anti-immigrationism and repatriation===
The cornerstone of the Front&#x27;s manifesto since 1974 has been the compulsory deportation of all non-white immigrants and their descendants, as well as the white British partners in mixed-race relationships. It stated that the &quot;repatriation&quot; process could take ten years, adding that before deportation, non-whites would be stripped of British citizenship and placed behind white Britons when it came to access to welfare, education and housing. It accompanied this with a call to prohibit future non-white migration to Britain. In the 1970s the NF stated that it did not oppose the arrival of white immigrants from Commonwealth countries, but called for &quot;firm controls&quot; on the migration of whites from elsewhere.

During its first decade, the party emphasised the claim that it was the politicians who enabled immigration—rather than migrants themselves—who were to blame. In 1969, it stated: &quot;Your enemies are not the coloured immigrants, but the British government which let them come in hundreds of thousands.&quot; It claimed that Labour had promoted migration to boost their vote and that Conservatives had seen migrants as cheap labour. Its early publications generally avoided derogatory terms for non-whites like &quot;wog&quot; or &quot;nigger&quot;, although such language appeared at party rallies. As it developed, the NF press included racially inflammatory headlines like &quot;Black Savages Terrorize Old Folk&quot; and &quot;Asians Import Bizarre Sex-Murder Rites&quot;, also comparing non-white migrants to vermin by describing areas as &quot;immigrant-infested&quot;.

The NF linked other issues to race and immigration, targeting concerns among the white British about immigrants being competition for jobs, housing and welfare. Common NF claims included that immigrants carried diseases like leprosy and tuberculosis, that they were a burden on the National Health Service (NHS), and that incompetent migrant staff were detrimental to the NHS. It claimed that immigrants evaded taxes and that they were arrogant, aggressive and unhygienic in the workplace. It maintained that blacks were a source of crime, and that black pupils eroded school quality.

===Antisemitism and Holocaust denial===
The NF is antisemitic. It claimed that Jews form a biologically distinct race—one of the world&#x27;s &quot;higher races&quot;—and that they seek to destroy the white &quot;Caucasoid&quot; race. The Front alleged that a Jewish cabal orchestrated non-white migration into Britain, hoping to weaken the white race through racial mixing, as well as through internationalism and encouraging internal division. The party propagated the conspiracy theory that Jews did this to plunge other &quot;higher races&quot; in disarray so that they would be left dominant. As mentioned in &quot;Spearhead&quot;, this achieved, &quot;the Jewish nation would be the only surviving ethnically identifiable population group amid a mongrelised world population&quot;, the latter being easier for Jews to control. This conspiracy theory owed much to the 19th-century Russian antisemitic forgery &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, and was previously articulated by the BUF. Whereas the BUF explicitly claimed Jews were behind this global conspiracy, the NF were aware of considerable public disapproval of antisemitism following the Holocaust so used code-words and dogwhistles such as &quot;Money Power&quot;, &quot;internationalist&quot;, &quot;cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;alien&quot;, &quot;rootless&quot;, &quot;shifty&quot;, &quot;money-lenders&quot; and &quot;usurers&quot; instead of &quot;Jews&quot;.

In the 1970s, the NF denied it was &quot;antisemitic&quot;. Instead, the party called itself &quot;anti-Zionist&quot;, and claimed to oppose &quot;Zionists&quot; rather than all Jews. Within the NF, the word &quot;Zionism&quot; was not used in the commonly understood manner, which is to describe the ideology promoting the formation of a Jewish state, but rather applied to the alleged Jewish cabal secretly manipulating the world. For instance, one issue of &quot;Spearhead&quot; stated that &quot;the twin evils of International Finance and International Communism&quot; are &quot;perhaps better described as International Zionism&quot;. Fielding observed that party members used the term &quot;Zionist&quot; indiscriminately, often against any critics.

Many of the Front&#x27;s central members, among them Chesterton, Tyndall and Webster, had long histories of antisemitism before joining the party. For instance, in 1963, Tyndall claimed that &quot;Jewry is a world pest wherever it is found in the world today. The Jews are more clever and more financially powerful than other people and have to be eradicated before they destroy the Aryan peoples.&quot; In an early edition of &quot;Spearhead&quot;, Tyndall stated: &quot;if Britain were to become Jew-clean she would have no nigger neighbours to worry about ... It is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. Do you hear me? THE JEWS?&quot; While some of its senior members had previously called for a genocide of the Jews, the party itself engaged in Holocaust denial, referring to the Holocaust as &quot;the six million myth&quot;. It is possible that most senior NF figures were aware that the Holocaust really happened, but denied its occurrence for tactical reasons, hoping that the spread of Holocaust denial would facilitate a more positive attitude toward Nazi Germany among Britain&#x27;s population.

===Government and the state===
During the 1970s, the Front alleged that the UK&#x27;s liberal democracy was &quot;bogus democracy&quot; and declared that it would forge &quot;a genuinely democratic political system&quot;, utilising referendums on major issues. In making claims such as that &quot;true democracy is that which is representative of the will of the people&quot;, the NF espoused populist rhetoric. Fielding nevertheless believed that &quot;the essence of the NF ideology is incompatible with democracy&quot; and instead reflected an &quot;elitist tendency&quot; at odds with its &quot;populist rhetoric&quot;.

The NF saw democracy as a luxury that was subordinate to the preservation of the nation. In &quot;Spearhead&quot;, Tyndall stated that although he would support parliamentary democracy if he thought it in the national interest, &quot;the survival, and the national recovery of Britain stand as top priority over all. We will support whatever political methods are necessary to attain that end.&quot; He called for governance by a strong leader, an individual unencumbered by political parties and elections so that they could focus on the national interest rather than the interests of sub-groups or short-term considerations. In &quot;Spearhead&quot;, Tyndall stated that &quot;it is only in banana republics, where the &#x27;sophisticated&#x27; Western institutions of a multi- or two-party system, powerful trade unions and a &#x27;free&#x27; press have not yet taken root, that there is still scope for men of real personality and decision to emerge and truly lead.&quot; Fielding believed that had the NF achieved political office it would have marginalised parliament and governed in a totalitarian manner.

Under its Strasserite leadership during the 1980s, the NF adopted a different position on governance, influenced heavily by the Third International Theory propounded by Libya&#x27;s leader Muammar Gaddafi in &quot;The Green Book&quot;. It promoted the establishment of communal political structures, with street councils, area councils, county councils and a National People&#x27;s Council &quot;for each of the British Nations&quot;. In its view of this future, the British population would be armed and trained in military tactics, allowing for the establishment of local militias rather than a state-controlled professional army.

===International institutions and relations===
Regarding international institutions as part of the Jewish conspiracy&#x27;s plan for a one world government, the Front opposed UK membership of the United Nations and the European Economic Community (EEC). To replace the EEC, the NF called for stronger UK links with the &quot;White countries&quot; of the British Commonwealth, namely Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but also the white-minority governments of Rhodesia and South Africa. According to the Front, this would &quot;strengthen the ethnic, cultural and family ties between peoples of British stock all over the world&quot;. It stated that an NF-led UK would not remain allied to the United States because the latter was dominated by the Jewish conspiracy, and called for withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, with Britain instead boosting its defensive capabilities through nuclear weaponry.

During the 1970s, the Front was British unionist, advocating for the unity of the United Kingdom. From the late 1960s onward, it supported the Ulster Unionists, deeming Irish republicanism a communist conspiracy to undermine British unity. The NF argued that the UK had been too soft in dealing with militant Irish republicans; it argued that military courts should replace civil ones, that Provisional Irish Republican Army members should be interned and that those guilty of sabotage or murder should be executed. In the early 1970s it alleged that the Irish Republic was harbouring republican militants, &quot;an act of war&quot; that required trade sanctions. In that decade the NF endorsed the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party, but many Ulster Unionists were suspicious of the NF; in 1973 the Ulster Defence Association proscribed it as &quot;a neo-Nazi movement&quot;. In 1985 – by which time Strasserites dominated the party – the NF called on Northern Ireland to declare independence in response to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.

===Economic policy===
During the 1970s, the Front identified as neither capitalist nor socialist, advocating an economic system drawing on both. It endorsed private enterprise but rejected laissez-faire capitalism, claiming that the latter places the interests of business above that of the nation. It promoted economic nationalism, calling for maximum national self-sufficiency and a rejection of international free trade. By this approach it wished to separate Britain from the international financial system, which it believed was controlled by the Jewish conspiracy. It opposed foreign ownership of British industry, endorsing protectionist and monetarist policies, advocating the state control of banking and financial services, and calling for a state bank to provide interest-free loans to fund municipal housing construction. These economic views were common across Britain&#x27;s far-right, being akin, for example, to those of the BUF.

After the Strasserite faction took control in the 1980s, the NF adopted distributist policies, maintaining the emphasis on an economic system neither capitalist nor socialist. In the party&#x27;s material from 1980, it claimed that &quot;Capitalism and Communism&quot; were &quot;twin evils&quot; to be overcome by &quot;Revolutionary Nationalism&quot;. In keeping with the Strasserites&#x27; distributism, the 1980s NF called for large business and industry to be redistributed into a tripartite system: small privately owned enterprises, workers&#x27; co-operatives and, in the case of financial institutions and heavy industry, nationalised enterprises. To solve unemployment, the party stated that it would encourage urban-to-rural migration, with heavily mechanised agriculture being replaced by small, labour-intensive farms.

===Social issues===
The NF adopted a strong stance against liberal and socially permissive policies, claiming that what it perceived as the growing permissiveness of British society was orchestrated by the Jewish conspiracy. Tyndall called for a moral &quot;regeneration&quot; penetrating &quot;every sphere of work and leisure&quot;, including prohibitions on &quot;art, literature or entertainment by which public moral standards might be endangered&quot;. Although placing little importance on religion, during the 1970s, the party claimed that God had set forth absolute moral values.

The party opposed changes to traditional gender roles. &quot;Spearhead&quot; stated that the NF saw &quot;the feminine role as principally one of wife, mother and home maker&quot;. In the party&#x27;s first year, it largely ignored the 1967 Abortion Act that legalised abortion, although by 1974 had adopted an anti-abortion stance, stating that abortions should only be legal in medical emergencies. According to Tyndall, the legalisation of abortion was part of a conspiracy to reduce white British births. The issue decreased in resonance within the party during the early 1980s but was re-emphasised when the Strasserites took control. The party condemned homosexuality, mixed-race marriages, and prostitution.

In the 1970s the NF claimed that the teaching profession was full of &quot;communists&quot;, and stated that under an NF government all teachers deemed unsuitable would be fired. That decade, it stressed that education should be suited to the varying abilities of students although did not outright condemn comprehensive schooling. It called for greater emphasis on examinations and sporting competitions, with a rejection of &quot;slapdash Leftwing-inspired teaching fads&quot;. It stated that it would emphasise the teaching of British history to encourage patriotism while expanding science and technology in the curriculum at the expense of the social sciences.

The Front exalted self-sufficiency, asserting that the individual should be willing to serve the state and that citizens&#x27; rights should be subordinate to their duties. During the 1970s, the Front criticised the UK&#x27;s welfare state, stating that it wanted to end the perception of the UK as a &quot;loafer&#x27;s paradise&quot;. From its early years the NF promoted a tough stance on law and order, calling for harsher criminal sentencing, tougher prisons, and the reintroduction of both capital punishment, and national service. Emphasising self-responsibility, it rejected the idea that an individual&#x27;s misdeeds should be attributed to their societal background.

==Organisation and structure==
===Leadership and branches===
During its 1970s, heyday the National Front was headed by its directorate, a body of between seven and 20 party members. With strict control over local and regional organisations, the directorate determined party policy, controlled its structures and finances, oversaw admissions and expulsions, and determined tactics. A third of the directorate were required to stand down every year, with a postal ballot of the membership to determine their replacements. Between 1971 and 1975, the directorate elected two of its members to be the chairman and deputy chairman. However, at the 1977 annual general meeting it agreed—at Tyndall&#x27;s instigation—that the chairman would instead be elected through a postal ballot of the membership. As the directorate met in London infrequently, in practice the running of the party was left to the chairman and deputy chairman.

The NF&#x27;s local presence divided into &quot;groups&quot;, which had under twelve members, and &quot;branches&quot;, which had over twelve. Fielding stated that in July 1973 the party had 32 branches and 80 groups, while the journalist Martin Walker claimed that in January 1974, it had 30 branches and 54 groups. Most were in south-east England, with 11 branches and 8 groups in Greater London and 5 branches and 22 groups elsewhere in the south-east. It had 5 branches and 3 groups in the Midlands, 7 branches and 11 groups in the north, 1 branch and 7 groups in western Britain and 1 group each in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Each branch or group had its own five-person committee, with annual elections for the committee positions. Typically taking place in pubs, branch meetings focused largely on practical issues like raising finances. Some NF branches established supporters&#x27; associations for sympathisers unwilling to become members. Supporter organisations were established elsewhere in the world; in New Zealand in 1977 and in Australia, Canada and South Africa in 1978. In April 1974, the party introduced regional councils to co-ordinate between the national party and its local groups and branches.

After the Strasserite faction secured control in 1986, it formally adopted a cadre system of leadership. This made the party more elitist, creating what the Strasserites called &quot;a revolutionary cadre party; a movement run by its most dedicated and active members rather than by armchair nationalists&quot;. This was linked to the idea that each NF member should be a &quot;political soldier&quot;, a &quot;New Type of Man&quot; who rejected the &quot;materialist nightmare&quot; of contemporary capitalist society and underwent a personal &quot;Spiritual Revolution&quot; to dedicate themselves fully to the nation.

===Security and violence===

Preoccupied with security, during the 1970s, the Front created a file of its opponents&#x27; names and addresses. To guard its marches, it formed &quot;defence groups&quot;—later called the &quot;Honour Guard&quot;—who often carried makeshift weapons. These marches often took place in areas with high migrant populations to instil fear in the latter, whip up racial tensions and generate publicity. These tactics have continued into more recent times. Local authorities sometimes banned its marches; in 2012, Aberdeen City Council rejected the NF&#x27;s request to hold a procession on Adolf Hitler&#x27;s birthday. The NF also disrupted anti-fascist and mainstream political meetings. In 1975, NF activists attacked a National Council of Civil Liberties meeting, with eight people requiring hospitalisation; in another instance they stormed a Liberal Party meeting discussing the transition to black-majority rule in Rhodesia, chanting &quot;White Power&quot;.

The Front claimed that its members only resorted to violence in self-defence, although in the 1970s Fielding observed the group using force &quot;aggressively&quot;. Fielding believed the most notable violent clash involving the NF was the Red Lion Square disorders in June 1974, during which an anti-fascist protester, Kevin Gateley, was killed. Another prominent clash took place in Lewisham in August 1977, when Trotskyist groups attacked the NF marchers, resulting in the &quot;Battle of Lewisham&quot;. In April 1979, an anti-NF demonstration in Southall clashed with police, resulting in the death of Blair Peach.

There have also been actions where covert NF involvement was suspected but not proven. For instance, in 1974, several men put up NF posters in Brighton, assaulted individuals they accused of being Jewish and attacked the Communist Party of Britain (Marxist–Leninist) bookshop. The local NF branch denied involvement. In June 1978, the Anti-Nazi League headquarters was hit by an arson attack; the slogan &quot;NF Rules OK&quot; was graffitied on the building. The NF denied responsibility. The party&#x27;s leadership showed little concern with the violence of its members and supporters, and openly praised some of its members convicted for violent activity.

===Sub-groups and propaganda output===
The NF formed various sub-groups. In 1974, it launched the NF Trade Unionists Association, and issued a short-lived trade unionist magazine, &quot;The British Worker&quot;. During the 1970s, it encouraged members to infiltrate other groups, such as the Hunt Saboteurs Association and ratepayers&#x27; and residents&#x27; associations, through which to promote the NF. In 1978, the party&#x27;s directorate established a legal department to deal with the growing number of members being charged with inciting racial hatred under the 1976 Race Relations Act. Also in the 1970s, it formed a Student Association, and issued the student magazine &quot;Spark&quot;. The NF Student Association initially tried recruiting students at universities, but later refocused attention towards schools and sixth forms. In 1978 it launched the Young National Front (YNF): membership was restricted to 14 to 25 years olds. The YNF issued a newsletter, &quot;Bulldog&quot;, and organised a football competition between YNF teams.

The NF observed how the left mobilised anti-fascist support through musical ventures like Rock Against Racism and decided to employ similar techniques. In 1979, Pearce—then the YNF leader—established Rock Against Communism (RAC), through which the NF held concerts featuring neo-Nazi skinhead bands. Tyndall and other senior NF members liked the opportunity for expanding party membership that RAC offered them, but were concerned that associations with the skinhead subculture would damage the NF&#x27;s image. After Tyndall left the party, in 1982 RAC was revived with Skrewdriver as its flagship band. In 1983 the NF launched a record label, White Noise Records, which became an important source of revenue for several years. The RAC had difficulty finding venues willing to stage its concerts and in 1984 got around this by staging its first large open-air concert at the Suffolk home of Nick Griffin&#x27;s parents. Later in the 1980s, Skrewdriver broke from the NF to establish its own far-right music promotion network, Blood &amp; Honour.

==Support==

There was regional variation in the support that the NF received during the 1970s, reflected both in its vote share and the size and number of its branches. Paralleling the earlier support of the BUF, the NF&#x27;s strength was centred heavily in England; its support was far weaker in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England, its support clustered along the South Coast and in London and Birmingham.

===Finances===
The National Front was not open about its finances, but often stressed that it was short of funds. It is likely that in its heyday, it had just enough money to pay for its two full-time officials, three head office secretaries and party expenses. Its central funds came from several sources: membership dues, the sale of its publications, donations, and lotteries. Donations were requested at rallies and meetings, and also provided by wealthy supporters, some from abroad. Branches were expected to finance their own candidates in election campaigns, raising funds from jumble sales and social events.

===Membership===
====Numbers====
The NF faced a high membership turnover. In 1977, Walker described its membership as being &quot;like a bath with both taps running and the plughole empty. Members pour in and pour out.&quot; Fielding echoed this, stating that the NF&#x27;s &quot;stable membership&quot; was lower than the number 
of people who have &quot;passed through&quot; it; Taylor suggested that during the 1970s, &quot;at least 12,000&quot; people joined and then left. Many of those attracted to the party because of its anti-immigrationism may have departed on discovering its fascist ideology. In other cases, individuals may have left because the hardship they encountered — social ostracism, job losses, verbal abuse and, on rare occasions, assault — became too much to endure, particularly as the party&#x27;s fortunes declined in the latter 1970s.

The Front refused to disclose the number of members that it had. Thurlow suggested that &quot;the most reliable estimates&quot; were produced by the anti-fascist magazine &quot;Searchlight&quot;. &quot;Searchlight&quot; claimed that from its origins with 4,000 members in 1968, the party reached a peak membership of 17,500 in 1972, which had declined to 10,000 in 1979, to 3,148 in 1984 and to 1,000 in 1985. An estimate of party membership in 1989 put adherents of the Flag Group at about 3,000 and of the Strasserite faction at about 600. Even at its 1970s peak, the Front&#x27;s membership was half that of the BUF during its 1930s heyday.

====Profile====
No adequate sociological sampling of NF members took place, but interviews with members were conducted during the 1970s by Taylor, Fielding and Billig. Max Hanna noted that as of 1973, most NF members were &quot;from the skilled working class and lower-middle class&quot; but with variation among branches. Fielding observed that party activism was generally carried out by upper working- and lower middle-class members rather than by their lower working-class and upper middle-class counterparts. Fielding also noted that the party contained individuals of all age ranges, although added that men in their thirties and fifties predominated over those in their forties, suggesting that the latter were typically preoccupied with raising families.

Fielding found that NF members were sensitive to ideas that they were &quot;fascistic&quot; or &quot;cranky&quot;, instead regarding themselves as &quot;patriots&quot; or &quot;nationalists&quot;. He noted that race was the main issue that led members to join the Front, that they perceived their racial ideas to be &quot;common sense&quot;, and that they expressed harsh prejudices against non-white Britons. A common perception among members was that life had changed for the worse in Britain, often outlined by the expression: &quot;the country is going to the dogs&quot;. The members Fielding encountered widely perceived Britain&#x27;s political leaders as corrupt and cruel and tended to believe conspiracy theories.

Fielding believed that some of the membership were &quot;motivated by a search for community and reassurance in a world they find difficult to understand&quot;. For some, joining the NF was a psychological act of defiance against society, while many joined because friends and relatives had done so. Fielding suggested that the NF&#x27;s moral indignation regarding perceived slackers and anti-social elements had particular appeal for upper working and lower middle-class Britons because these were the sectors of society which felt that they worked hardest for the least reward.

During the 1970s, the NF attempted to attract youth through new sub-groups. Many young people attracted to the group may have done so as a form of youthful rebellion, enjoying the &quot;shock value&quot; that membership offered; in this, they had similarities with the late 1970s punk movement. Ryan Shaffer stated that the party&#x27;s shift away from traditional campaigning during the 1980s and its growing affiliation with neo-Nazi youth groups restricted its appeal to &quot;mostly young people&quot;.

===Voter base===
The NF&#x27;s electoral support was overwhelmingly urban and English, with little support in rural parts of England or in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. According to Walker, the 1974 election results suggested that the NF&#x27;s electoral heartlands were in London&#x27;s East End and inner north-east suburbs. He noted that it gained much support from &quot;respectable working-class&quot; areas, where many traditional Labour voters were attracted by its racial appeals.

Examining the party&#x27;s East End support, the sociologist Christopher T. Husbands argued that NF support was not evenly distributed across the area, but constrained to Bethnal Green, Shoreditch, Hoxton and Haggerston. He noted that in these urban strongholds, &quot;only a minority&quot; of white residents sympathised with the NF. A 1978 survey in the East End by &quot;New Society&quot; found that while most white residents thought the immigration rate too high, many related positive relationships with Afro-Caribbean and Asian migrants and opposed the NF. Some mocked the Front, although were cautious about doing so publicly, fearing violent retaliation.

A 1977 survey by the University of Essex found that 8% of those polled were likely to vote for the Front, reflecting &quot;strong support amongst the working class, the young and the poorly educated&quot;. This survey found that support was strongest in the East Midlands (10%), followed by London (8%), East Anglia (7%), the West Midlands (6%) and Yorkshire and Humberside (6%). A report published in 1980 instead found that Greater London and the West Midlands were the NF&#x27;s greatest areas of support, together making up 48% of its national vote share. Determining that 71% of the NF&#x27;s support came from men, this study also found a strong link to class, with 72% of NF supporters being working-class; it noted that support was &quot;somewhat stronger among the skilled working class than among the semi- and unskilled workers.&quot; The 1980 study also examined views of the NF among the broader electorate, finding that 6% would &quot;seriously consider&quot; voting for the NF. Two-thirds of respondents believed that the NF stirred up racial tensions to advance its cause, 64% believed that there was a Nazi element to the party and 56% believed that the NF wanted Britain to become a dictatorship.

====Explanations====
Increasing levels of non-white immigration have been cited as an explanation for the NF&#x27;s electoral growth in the 1970s. One argument was that areas with large non-white immigrant communities were most susceptible to NF support, and the higher the non-white population, the higher the resentment among local whites and the greater the support for the NF. An alternate explanation is that the NF did particularly well in areas where the non-white population was moderately sized; and whites turned to the NF because they feared that the local non-white population would grow, particularly if neighbouring areas already had large non-white populations.

On examining voting data from the 1977 Greater London Council election, the political scientist Paul Whiteley argued that the NF&#x27;s vote share was best explained by the &quot;working-class authoritarianism&quot; phenomenon examined in the United States by S. M. Lipset. Christopher Husbands instead believed that the &quot;territorial sensitivity&quot; prevalent in English working-class culture was key. He argued that the English working-class largely created personal identities based on their neighbourhood rather than their profession, leaving them susceptible to far-right appeals based on location rather than leftist ones based on workplace solidarity. He argued that there were parallels with the Netherlands, where urban working-class communities had also expressed support for the far-right, although not in France, Germany, or Italy, where the urban proletariat had not offered substantial support for far-right parties.

==Electoral performance==
The National Front experienced its greatest success between 1972 and 1977. By the late 1970s, the party&#x27;s support had drastically declined and in the 1980s it largely withdrew from electoral participation. The Front&#x27;s emergence as an electoral force during the 1970s was an &quot;unprecedented development&quot; in British politics, the first time a far-right party gained so many votes.

===General and by-elections===
The Front never gained a seat in the House of Commons. In the 1970 general election, the NF fielded ten candidates and averaged 3.6% of the vote share in those constituencies. It did better in subsequent by-elections; in the 1972 Uxbridge by-election it received 8.2% and in the 1973 West Bromwich by-election it received 16%, the first time that the party saved its electoral deposit. In the February 1974 election, 54 of its candidates averaged 3.3% of the vote, while in the October 1974 election, 90 candidates averaged 3.1%. In the October 1974 general election, the Front gained over twenty-five times as many votes as the BUF had gained at any election; this suggested that &quot;politically speaking&quot;, fascism was &quot;far stronger&quot; in 1970s Britain than in 1930s Britain, the only European country where this was the case.

In 1977, the NF contested three by-elections, gaining 5.2% of the vote in the City of London and Westminster South by-election, 8.2% in the Birmingham Stechford by-election and 3.8% in the Ashfield by-election. In the Birmingham Stechford by-election, followed by another in Birmingham Ladywood in 1977 and in Lambeth Central in 1978, it beat the Liberals to reach third place. Within a few years the NF&#x27;s electoral support had drastically declined; in the 1979 general election, it fielded 303 candidates and averaged 0.6% of the total national vote, losing £45,000 in deposits. In the seats contested, it averaged 1.3% of the vote, a number which rose to 2% in the 88 constituencies it contested in Greater London. This election &quot;marked the beginning of the end of the movement&#x27;s claim to seek political legitimacy through the ballot box&quot;. In the 1983 general election, the NF fought 54 seats, averaging 1% in each.

===EU parliament elections===


===Local elections===
Although performing better in local elections than general ones, the NF never won a local council seat. In October 1969, two Conservative councillors on Wandsworth London Borough Council—Athlene O&#x27;Connell and Peter Mitchell—defected to the Front, but returned to the Conservatives in December. In the May 1974 London council elections, the party averaged 10% of the vote in the boroughs of Haringey, Islington, Brent, Southwark and Lewisham, while its best result was in Hounslow. In the April 1976 council elections, the NF boosted its vote in many towns, securing 21% of the vote in Sandwell, 20.7% in Wolverhampton, 18.54% in Leicester and 17% in Watford.

The NF made gains in the 1977 Greater London Council elections, where it contested all but one seat. Its 91 GLC candidates gained 120,000 votes, over twice the total that the party had accrued in the whole of England in 1974. In Inner London, it gained the third-largest vote share. Its share of the London vote also increased, reflecting an average rise from 4.4% in the October 1974 general election to 5.3% in the 1977 GLC election. It averaged over 10% of the vote in three boroughs: Hackney, Newham and Tower Hamlets. The NF&#x27;s vote share began to stagnate in the local elections from 1977 and 1978. By 1977, the party&#x27;s electoral support had peaked and, by the London Borough Council elections of 1978, its support &quot;had very noticeably declined&quot; in the city, something that was then reflected in local elections elsewhere in the UK.

In 2010, the NF gained its first elected representative in 35 years after John Gamble, a local councillor on Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council, defected to it from the England First Party. In 2011 he was removed for failure to attend meetings in six months.

====Parish and community councils====
The NF obtained several representatives on parish councils and community councils. In 2010, Sam Clayton, a representative for Bilton and Ainsty with Bickerton Ward in Harrogate—originally elected uncontested as a BNP candidate in 2008—defected to the NF. By 2011 he was no longer on the council. In 2011 the NF gained a representative on Langley Parish Council in Derbyshire, when Timothy Knowles was elected without opposition. On failing to attend council meetings, he was ejected from the council several months later. In October 2015, the NF chairman David MacDonald was elected to Garthdee Community Council in Aberdeen with 18 votes.

==Reception==
By the late 1960s, the National Front was &quot;the principal electoral force&quot; on the British far-right, and still dominated that scene at the start of the 1980s. By 1977, the NF was England&#x27;s fourth largest political party in terms of electoral support, a level of success which—according to Thurlow—&quot;testified to the significance&quot; of the immigration issue in 1970s British politics. Along with Tyndall&#x27;s BNP, the NF was the most significant far-right group in Britain in the second half of the 20th century, according to Durham.

The party also helped shape new far-right subcultures, for instance by cultivating the early white power skinhead music scene. Billig suggested that the NF&#x27;s long-term importance might have been in keeping anti-Semitism alive in Britain at a time when, following the Holocaust, it was weakened. Billig also argued that the NF helped tilt British politics to the right, encouraging the Conservatives to take a harder stance on immigration under Thatcher&#x27;s leadership.

During the NF&#x27;s 1970s heyday, the mainstream media only occasionally paid it attention; the NF claimed that this was part of a conspiracy against the party. It often had a better relationship with local newspapers, which were more likely to publish letters sent in by the NF. In the 1970s, NF branches often sought good relations with police to ensure protection of NF events. While the party acknowledged sympathy for its views among the lower ranks of the police, it maintained that the police hierarchy was part of the conspiracy against it. During the 1970s, the party had cells among prison officers. By 2011, both the prison service and police had forbidden their employees from being NF members.

===Opposition===
Major social and political groups largely ignored the NF&#x27;s rise, hoping that depriving it of publicity would hasten its decline, although Jewish and leftist groups took a more proactive approach to opposing it. Leftist approaches varied: the Communist Party of Great Britain and Labour Party Young Socialists mobilised the labour movement against racism to diffuse the NF&#x27;s appeal, while the International Marxist Group and the International Socialists/Socialist Workers Party favoured direct action to disrupt the NF, holding to the slogan: &quot;No platform for fascists&quot;.

In 1974, the National Union of Students adopted a &quot;no platform&quot; policy regarding the NF, while the Labour Party forbade its candidates from sharing public platforms, radio, or television slots with NF candidates. 120 Labour-controlled councils banned the party from using local municipal halls. Labour and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) helped mobilise the trade union movement against the NF; the National Union of Mineworkers called for the government to ban the party. Far-left and left-wing activists demonstrated outside NF meetings, encouraging landlords to bar the NF from using their premises, and sometimes assaulted NF members.

Anti-fascist and anti-racist groups formed the National Co-Ordinating Committee in September 1977. That November, various left and far-left groups launched the Anti-Nazi League (ANL), which gained public endorsements from several Labour politicians, trade union leaders, academics, actors, musicians and athletes, some of whom later distanced themselves from it amid concerns that its sub-campaign, School Kids Against the Nazis, was politicising schoolchildren with leftist propaganda. A more moderate alternative, the Joint Committee Against Racialism (JCAR), was launched in December 1977, uniting Labour, Conservative and Liberal Party members. Rock Against Racism was formed in 1976, holding two well-attended music festivals in London in 1978. In January 1978, both Christians Against Racism and Fascism and the British Council of Churches&#x27; own anti-fascist organisation were formed. Taylor noted that by the end of 1977, an &quot;unprecedented range of groups from almost every section of British society spreading right across the political spectrum had declared an intention to oppose the NF and the racism upon which it fed&quot;.

<text>Elizabeth Lee McGovern (born July 18, 1961) is an American actress. She has received many awards and nominations, including a Screen Actors Guild Award, three Golden Globe Award nominations, and one Academy Award nomination.

Born in Evanston, Illinois on July 18, 1961, McGovern spent most of her early life in Los Angeles. After attending the American Conservatory Theater and the Juilliard School, she made her feature film debut in &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980). For her role as Evelyn Nesbit in the film adaptation of &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1981), she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She subsequently had lead roles in a number of major studio films, including &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984), &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot; (1987), &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot; (1987), &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1990), and &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; (1997).

In 2007, McGovern, after years of studying guitar, formed the musical group Sadie and the Hotheads, with whom she has released four studio albums since 2016. She gained further international attention for her portrayal of Cora Crawley, Countess of Grantham, in the British drama series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2010–2015), for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award. She reprised her role as Cora in the subsequent films &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2019) and &quot;Downton Abbey: A New Era&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
McGovern was born in Evanston, Illinois, the daughter of Katharine Wolcott (née Watts), a high school teacher, and William Montgomery McGovern, Jr., a university professor. She is of Irish, English, and Scottish descent. Her younger sister is novelist Cammie McGovern. Her paternal grandfather was adventurer William Montgomery McGovern, her maternal great-grandfathers were U.S. diplomat Ethelbert Watts and Admiral Charles P. Snyder, and her maternal great-great-grandfather was Congressman Charles P. Snyder.

When McGovern was 10 years old, she relocated with her family from Illinois to Los Angeles, California, where her father accepted a teaching position at UCLA School of Law. She attended North Hollywood High School, where she began performing in school plays. After high school, she attended the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, and studied toward a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Drama at the Juilliard School in New York City as a member of Group 12 from 1979 to 1981.

==Career==
In 1980, while studying at Juilliard, McGovern was offered a part in what became her first film, &quot;Ordinary People&quot;, in which she played the girlfriend of troubled teenager Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton). The following year she completed her acting education at the American Conservatory Theater and Juilliard, and began to appear in plays, first off-Broadway and later in famous theaters.

In 1981, she earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Evelyn Nesbit in the film &quot;Ragtime&quot;. She then appeared in &quot;Beginners&quot; (1982).

In 1984, she starred in Sergio Leone&#x27;s gangster epic &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; as Robert De Niro&#x27;s romantic interest Deborah Gelly. She had leading roles in two other films that year, &quot;Racing with the Moon&quot;, a coming-of-age story also starring Sean Penn and Nicolas Cage, and the comedy &quot;Lovesick&quot;, as a patient whose psychiatrist (Dudley Moore) falls in love with her, risking his practice.

In 1989, she played Mickey Rourke&#x27;s girlfriend in &quot;Johnny Handsome&quot;, directed by Walter Hill, and the same year she appeared as a rebellious lesbian in Volker Schlöndorff&#x27;s film &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

McGovern co-starred with Kevin Bacon in a romantic comedy, &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot;, directed by John Hughes, and starred in the thriller &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot;, directed by Curtis Hanson. She teamed with Michael Caine in 1990&#x27;s &quot;A Shock to the System&quot;, a comic mystery about a man who plots the murder of his wife.

In a 1994 comedy, &quot;The Favor&quot;, McGovern played a woman who cheats on her boyfriend (played by Brad Pitt) by becoming her married best friend&#x27;s proxy in a tryst with a man the friend has fantasized about.

McGovern appeared in a number of films in the 21st century, including &quot;Woman in Gold&quot;, a drama starring Helen Mirren and directed by her husband Simon Curtis.

In 2018, McGovern starred in &quot;The Chaperone&quot;, directed by Michael Engler and written by Julian Fellowes, whom she also worked with on the British drama series Downton Abbey. Based on the novel by Laura Moriarty, McGovern played Norma Carlisle, a middle-aged wife and mother who volunteers to chaperone the young Louise Brooks to New York City to study dance at the Denishawn School. &quot;The Chaperone&quot; is the first film that McGovern has also produced. Her husband, Simon Curtis, was an executive producer for the film.

McGovern reprised her role as Cora Crawley, Countess of Grantham for the &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; film in 2019 and its 2022 sequel. The films continue the storyline of the TV series.

===Television===
McGovern has appeared in several television productions, mostly in the UK. In 1999 and 2000, McGovern played Marguerite St. Just in a BBC television series loosely based on the novel &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. She also starred in the four-part television crime drama series &quot;Thursday the 12th&quot; that same year.

On American TV, she appeared in a 2007 episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; titled &quot;Harm&quot;, in which her character of Dr. Faith Sutton was a psychiatrist accused of complicity in detainee abuse. Her other television work includes &quot;Broken Glass&quot; (Arthur Miller, 1996); &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;; &quot;The Changeling&quot;; &quot;Tales from Hollywood&quot;; the HBO series &quot;Men and Women&quot;;&quot; The Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt&quot;; &quot;Shelley Duvall&#x27;s Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; (&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;); and &quot;If Not for You&quot; (CBS 1995, own series).

In May 2007, she played Ellen Doubleday, Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s paramour, in &quot;Daphne&quot;, a BBC2 television drama by Amy Jenkins based on Margaret Forster&#x27;s biography of the author.

In December 2008, McGovern appeared as Dame Celia Westholme in &quot;Appointment with Death&quot;, an episode of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;. In the same year, she appeared in the three-part BBC comedy series &quot;Freezing&quot;, written by James Wood and directed and co-produced by her husband Simon Curtis. First broadcast on BBC Four, it was also shown on BBC2 in February 2008. McGovern played an American expatriate actress named Elizabeth, living in Chiswick with her publisher husband, played by Hugh Bonneville, and co-starring Tom Hollander as her theatrical agent.

From 2010 to 2015, she portrayed Cora Crawley, Countess of Grantham, wife of Robert Crawley, 7th Earl of Grantham (played by Hugh Bonneville) in the British TV series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, and also in the 2019 and 2022 film adaptations. &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; was the third time McGovern and Bonneville have been cast as a married couple on screen, having previously co-starred in &quot;Freezing&quot; and &quot;Thursday the 12th&quot; together.

===Music===
McGovern is also a singer-songwriter and plays the guitar. In 2008, she began fronting the band Sadie and the Hotheads at The Castle pub venue in Portobello Road, London. The band released an album of songs she developed with The Nelson Brothers, who are now part of the band. The album, &quot;I Can Wait&quot;, also includes Ron Knights on bass and Rowan Oliver, borrowed from Goldfrapp, as drummer for the recording sessions. Michelle Dockery, who plays McGovern&#x27;s eldest daughter in &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, has occasionally sung with the band. Dockery was also a guest backing vocalist on the bands second album &quot;How Not To Lose Things&quot;, released in 2012. Terl Bryant also joined the band, taking over from Rowan Oliver as drummer and percussionist.

Throughout 2013, Sadie and the Hotheads toured the UK and Europe and performed in festivals including the Isle of Wight Festival, Montreux Jazz Festival and Edinburgh Festival Fringe. At the end of the year they announced that they were working on their third album with support from former direct-to-fan crowdfunding company PledgeMusic. &quot;Still Waiting&quot; was released in early 2014 prior to their next UK tour as the support act for Mike and the Mechanics.

McGovern recorded three Christmas tracks in 2014. Her rendition of &quot;It Came Upon a Midnight Clear&quot; and duet with Julian Ovenden performing &quot;The First Noel&quot; appear on the double-disc album &quot;Christmas At Downton Abbey&quot;, produced by Warner Music. Sadie and the Hotheads also released their cover version of the Christmas song The Little Drummer Boy.

Following the conclusion of TV series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; in late 2015, McGovern and her band Sadie and the Hotheads began work on a fourth album and embarked on a mini tour of the UK. While they continued to record their new album, the band released a compilation album of songs from their first three albums entitled &quot;The Collection (Everybody&#x27;s Got A Song)&quot; in early 2016.

In 2017, McGovern and &quot;Hothead&quot; Simon Nelson collaborated with American singer and musician Duke Robillard on a track for his album &quot;Duke Robillard &amp; His Dames of Rhythm&quot;. McGovern sings vocals for &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot; while Nelson is a guest musician on electric guitar for the track.

McGovern&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;The Truth&quot;, was released in early 2019. Unlike her previous albums with her band, &quot;The Truth&quot; was released under her name, though it features all of the musicians from Sadie and the Hotheads. The album includes a track on which Samuel L. Jackson appears as a guest vocalist.

<text>Moka () is a village in Mauritius located mainly in the Moka District. The western part of the village lies in the Plaines Wilhems District. Since 1967 it forms part of Constituency No. 8 Quartier Militaire and Moka. The village is administered by the Moka Village Council under the aegis of the Moka District Council. According to the census made by Statistics Mauritius in 2011, the population was at 8,846. The elevation is 203 meters and can be up to 425 meters in some places. Moka is directly on the other side of the Moka Range from Port Louis. The village is close to the mountain Le Pouce and the town Beau-Bassin Rose-Hill. Réduit is a suburb of the village where the State House and University of Mauritius is situated. The village is also home to the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation and the Mahatma Gandhi Institute.

==History==
===Housing boom===
Moka is centrally located in Mauritius and as such has experienced a real estate development boom in the past few years. This was mainly encouraged by the development of the CyberCity two kilometres away in Ebene. Another contributing factor to this property business was that since Mauritius will not benefit from preferential prices for its sugar by the European Community and World Trade Organization, sugar estates quickly started real estate business units that would convert the land under sugar cane culture to residential lands. From 2004 to 2006, Moka saw five property estate developments.

==Weather==
Moka has a tropical wet climate. Since it is in the southern hemisphere, February is the warmest month and August is the coolest. Temperatures normally can range from in February to at night in August. The dry season is in October, the wet season is in February. Temperature is somewhat constant.

==Places==
===Schools===
Schools in Moka include Le Bocage International School, Mahatma Gandhi Institute, Mahatma Gandhi Secondary School, St. Mary Roman Catholic School, and Ecole du Centre.

University

University of Mauritius
Charles Telfair Institute 
===Other===
Other important institutions in Moka are the:
* Agricultural Marketing Board (AMB) which stocks vegetables (mainly potatoes) for local consumption
* Subramaniam Bharati Eye Centre (AKA Moka Eye Hospital) which is the country&#x27;s only specialized eye hospital.
* Catholic Church

==Notable people==
*Jean Louis Brue du Garoutier, French soldier later retrieving the rank of Maréchal de Camp (Brigade General) under Napoleon and serving as commander of the 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division during the Waterloo Campaign.
*Thomas Shadrach James (Peersahib), teacher, linguist and herbalist in Australia
*Fabrice Lapierre, Mauritian-born Australian long jumper
*Reza Shah, exiled penultimate Shah of Iran who lived in &quot;Chateau Val Ory&quot; for 7 months after he was deposed during the 1941 Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran.
* Capt Joshua Slocum. It was in Moka, in September 1897, that Capt Joshua Slocum visited the then existing Moka Flower conservatory during his legendary solo sailing trip around the world. During that visit, he was honored to have a plant named after him, which is today known as the Joshua Slocum day-lily and is commercially available.

<doc id="333163" wikidata="Q127749" url="?curid=333163" title="Halfbeak">
<text>Hemiramphidae is a family of fishes that are commonly called halfbeaks, spipe fish or spipefish. They are a geographically widespread and numerically abundant family of epipelagic fish inhabiting warm waters around the world. The halfbeaks are named for their distinctive jaws, in which the lower jaws are significantly longer than the upper jaws. The similar viviparous halfbeaks (family Zenarchopteridae) have often been included in this family.

Though not commercially important themselves, these forage fish support artisanal fisheries and local markets worldwide. They are also fed upon by other commercially important predatory fishes, such as billfishes, mackerels, and sharks.

==Taxonomy==
In 1758, Carl Linnaeus was the first to scientifically describe a halfbeak, &quot;Esox brasiliensis&quot; (now &quot;Hemiramphus brasiliensis&quot;). In 1775 Peter Forsskål described two more species as &quot;Esox&quot;, &quot;Esox far&quot; and &quot;Esox marginatus&quot;. It was not until 1816 that Georges Cuvier created the genus &quot;Hemiramphus&quot;; from then on, all three were classified as &quot;Hemiramphus&quot;. In 1859, Gill erected Hemiramphidae, deriving its name from &quot;Hemiramphus&quot;, the family&#x27;s type genus. The name comes from the Greek &quot;hemi&quot;, meaning half, and &quot;rhamphos&quot;, meaning beak or bill.

There are currently eight genera (including 60 species) within the family Hemirampphidae:

* &quot;Arrhamphus&quot; 
* &quot;Chriodorus&quot; 
* &quot;Euleptorhamphus&quot; 
* &quot;Hemiramphus&quot; 
* &quot;Hyporhamphus&quot; 
* &quot;Melapedalion&quot; 
* &quot;Oxyporhamphus&quot; 
* &quot;Rhynchorhamphus&quot; 
This family is primarily marine and found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, though some inhabit estuaries and rivers.

==Evolution==
The halfbeaks&#x27; fossil record extends into the Lower Tertiary. The earliest known halfbeak is &quot;Hemiramphus&quot; &quot;edwardsi&quot; from the Eocene at Monte Bolca, Italy. Apart from differences in the length of the upper and lower jaws, recent and fossil halfbeaks are distinguished by the fusion of the third pair of upper pharyngeal bones into a plate.

==Phylogeny==

The phylogeny of the halfbeaks is in a state of flux.

On the one hand, there is little question that they are most closely related to three other families of streamlined, surface water fishes: the flyingfishes, needlefishes, and sauries. Traditionally, these four families have been taken to together comprise the order Beloniformes. The halfbeaks and flyingfishes are considered to form one group, the superfamily Exocoetoidea, and the needlefishes and sauries another, the superfamily Scomberesocoidea.

On the other hand, recent studies have demonstrated that rather than forming a single monophyletic group (a clade), the halfbeak family actually includes a number of lineages ancestral to the flyingfishes and the needlefishes. In other words, as traditionally defined, the halfbeak family is paraphyletic.

Within the subfamily Hemiramphinae, the &quot;flying halfbeak&quot; genus &quot;Oxyporhamphus&quot; has proved to be particularly problematic; while morphologically closer to the flyingfishes, molecular evidence places it with &quot;Hemiramphus&quot; and &quot;Euleptorhamphus&quot;. Together, these three genera form the sister group to the flyingfish family. The other two hemiramphine genera &quot;Hyporhamphus&quot; and &quot;Arrhamphus&quot; form another clade of less clear placement.

Rather than being closely related to the flyingfishes, the subfamily Zenarchopterinae appears to be the sister group of the needlefishes and sauries. This is based on the pharyngeal jaw apparatus, sperm ultrastructure, and molecular evidence. However, this hypothesis has awkward implications for how the morphological evolution of the group is understood, because the fused pharyngeal plate has been considered reliably diagnostic of the halfbeak family. Furthermore, the existing theory that because juvenile needlefish pass through a developmental stage where the lower jaw is longer than the upper jaw (the so-called &quot;halfbeak stage&quot;) the theory that halfbeaks are paedomorphic needlefish is untenable. In fact the unequal lengths of the upper and lower jaws of halfbeaks appears to be the basal condition, with needlefish being relatively derived in comparison.

==Morphology==

The halfbeaks are elongate, streamlined fish adapted to living in open water. Halfbeaks can grow to over SL in the case of &quot;Euleptorhampus viridis&quot;. The scales are relatively large, cycloid (smooth), and easily detached. There are no spines in the fins. A distinguishing characteristic is that the third pair of upper pharyngeal bones are anklylosed (fused) into a plate. Halfbeaks are one of several fish families that lack a stomach, all of which possess a pharyngeal jaw apparatus (pharyngeal mill). Most species have an extended lower jaw, at least as juveniles, though this feature may be lost as the fish mature, as with &quot;Chriodorus&quot;, for example.

As is typical for surface dwelling, open water fish, most species are silvery, darker above and lighter below, an example of countershading. The tip of the lower jaw is bright red or orange in most species.

Halfbeaks carry several adaptations to feeding at the water surface. The eyes and nostrils are at the top of the head and the upper jaw is mobile, but not the lower jaw. Combined with their streamlined shape and the concentration of fins towards the back (similar to that of a pike), these adaptations allow halfbeaks to locate, catch, and swallow food items very effectively.

==Range and habitat==

Halfbeaks inhabit warm seas, predominantly at the surface, in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. A small number are found in estuaries. Most species of marine halfbeaks are known from continental coastlines, but some extend into the western and central Pacific, and one species (&quot;Hyporhamphus ihi&quot;) is endemic to New Zealand. &quot;Hemiramphus&quot; is a worldwide marine genus.

==Ecology and behavior==

===Feeding===
Marine halfbeaks are omnivores feeding on algae; marine plants such as seagrasses; plankton; invertebrates such as pteropods and crustaceans; and smaller fishes. For some subtropical species at least, juveniles are more predatory than adults. Some tropical species feed on animals during the day and plants at night, while other species alternate between carnivory in the summer and herbivory in the winter. They are in turn eaten by many ecologically and commercially important fish, such as billfish, mackerel, and sharks, and so are a key link between trophic levels.

===Behavior===
Marine halfbeaks are typically pelagic schooling forage fish. The southern sea garfish &quot;Hyporhamphus melanochir&quot; for example is found in sheltered bays, coastal seas, estuaries around southern Australia in waters down to a depth of . These fish school near the surface at night but swim closer to the sea floor during the day, particularly among beds of seagrasses. Genetic analysis of the different sub-populations of the eastern sea garfish &quot;Hyporhamphus melanochir&quot; in South Australian coastal waters reveals that there is a small but consistent migration of individuals among theme, sufficient to keep them genetically homogeneous.

Some marine halfbeaks, including &quot;Euleptorhamphus velox&quot; and &quot;Euleptorhamphus viridis&quot;, are known for their ability to jump out of the water and glide over the surface for considerable distances, and have consequently sometimes been called flying halfbeaks.

===Reproduction===
Hemiramphidae species are all external fertilizers. They are usually egg-layers and often produce relatively small numbers of fairly large eggs for fish of their size, typically in shallow coastal waters, such as the seagrass meadows of Florida Bay. The eggs of &quot;Hemiramphus brasiliensis&quot; and &quot;H. balao&quot; are typically in diameter and have attaching filaments. They hatch when they grow to about in diameter. &quot;Hyporhamphus melanochir&quot; eggs are slightly larger, around in diameter, and are unusually large when they hatch, being up to in size.

Relatively little is known about the ecology of juvenile marine halfbeaks, though estuarine habitats seem to be favored by at least some species. The southern sea garfish &quot;Hyporhamphus melanochir&quot; grows rapidly at first, attaining a length of up to in the first three years, after which point growth slows. This species lives for a maximum age of about 9 years, at which point the fish reach up to and weigh about .

==Relationship to humans==

===Halfbeak fisheries===
Halfbeaks are not a major target for commercial fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (&quot;Hyporhamphus melanochir&quot;). and the eastern sea garfish (&quot;Hyporhamphus australis&quot;). Halfbeaks are caught by a variety of methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.

In some localities significant bait fisheries exist to supply sport fishermen. One study of a bait fishery in Florida that targets &quot;Hemiramphus brasiliensis&quot; and &quot;Hemiramphus balao&quot; suggests that despite increases in the size of the fishery the population is stable and the annual catch is valued at around $500,000.

<text>Sudeley Castle is a Grade I listed castle in the parish of Sudeley, in the Cotswolds, near to the medieval market town of Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, England. The castle has 10 notable gardens covering some within a estate nestled within the Cotswold hills.

Building of the castle began in 1443 for Ralph Boteler; the Lord High Treasurer of England, on the site of a previous 12th-century fortified manor house. It was later seized by the crown and became the property of King Edward IV and King Richard III, who built its famous banqueting hall.

King Henry VIII and his then wife Anne Boleyn visited the castle in 1535; and it later became the home and final resting place of his sixth wife, Catherine Parr who remarried after the king&#x27;s death. Parr is buried in the castle&#x27;s church, making Sudeley the only privately owned castle in the world to have a Queen of England buried in its grounds. Sudeley soon became the home of the Chandos family, and the castle was visited on three occasions by Queen Elizabeth I, who held a three-day party there to celebrate the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

During the First English Civil War, the castle was used as a military base, by King Charles I and Prince Rupert, and it was later besieged and slighted by parliament, remaining largely in ruins for the following few centuries until its purchase in 1837 by the Dent family, who restored the castle and turned it into a family home.

==History==
=== 11th century ===
Although the origins of Sudeley are lost to time, its name, a corruption of its Anglo-Saxon name &quot;Sudeleagh&quot;, meaning &#x27;south lying pasture or clearing in forest&#x27; gives an idea of what it was like. Sudeley most likely owes its early rise as a royal estate to its close proximity to Winchcombe, which, during the reign of King Offa, was the capital of the Kingdom of Mercia. Under royal patronage, Winchcombe prospered, becoming a walled town with its own monastery, where a king and a saint are now buried.

By the turn of the 11th century, Sudeley had grown into a manor house set in a royal deer park, given as an extravagant gift from King Æthelred the Unready to his daughter Goda on her wedding day.

Despite William the Conqueror&#x27;s policy of depriving Saxon nobles of their estates after the Norman Conquest of 1066, the family managed to retain Sudeley, and Goda&#x27;s descendants would hold Sudeley for another four centuries.

=== 12th century ===
During The Anarchy, John de Sudeley supported the Empress Matilda in her fight against her cousin, Stephen of Blois.

It is believed that the first castle at Sudeley was built during this time, otherwise known as an adulterine castle. Nothing is known as to what this castle looked like; it may well have simply been the fortification of the existing manor house, or an altogether new structure.

However, after the sacking of Worcester in 1139 by the forces of the Empress Matilda, under her brother Robert of Gloucester, Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester retaliated, attacking and capturing both Sudeley and Tewkesbury.

Although little is known of what happened to Sudeley during this attack, it seems likely that its fortifications were pulled down by the vengeful Earl of Worcester, as soon after Roger, Earl of Hereford built a replacement motte and bailey castle in Winchcombe.

A few decades after the Anarchy, the Sudeley family were to step once more onto the world stage with John&#x27;s younger son, William de Tracy, participating in the murder of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. William was subsequently excommunicated by Pope Alexander III. He went on pilgrimage to Rome in 1171 and gained an audience with the pope, who exiled him and his fellow conspirators to Jerusalem.

=== Construction of the current castle ===

By the start of the 15th century, the Sudeley name was believed to have gone extinct and the Boteler family had inherited the castle through the marriage of Joan, the sister of the last de Sudeley.

Ralph Boteler is believed to have started the construction of the castle in 1443, around the same time he became Lord High Treasurer of England. He rose to prominence during the Hundred Years&#x27; War; serving in France under John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford in 1419, and was later appointed to the Regency Council of King Henry VI in 1423.

Sudeley was not Ralph&#x27;s first great project, having extensively renovated the Manor on the More, the house he used when attending court, and was later described by a French Ambassador, Jean du Bellay, as more magnificent than Hampton Court. Unfortunately, Ralph failed to gain royal permission to crenellate the castle, and had to seek Henry VI&#x27;s pardon.

Ralph built Sudeley Castle on a double courtyard plan; with the outer courtyard being used by servants and men-at-arms, and the inner court and its buildings reserved for the use of Ralph and his family.

In 1449, Ralph&#x27;s son, Thomas Boteler, married Lady Eleanor Talbot, famed as &quot;England&#x27;s Secret Queen&quot; for her relationship with King Edward IV after the death of her husband. It was this relationship that King Richard III used to illegitimise his brother&#x27;s children and heirs, clearing the way for himself to take the crown.

=== Richard III ===

Ralph, now out of favour as a supporter of the Lancastrian cause, was in 1469 compelled to sell Sudeley and six other manors to the crown. Edward IV bestowed Sudeley upon his brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who used it as a military base before the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471.

In 1478, Richard swapped Sudeley for Richmond Castle, before re-inheriting it when he acceded to the throne in 1483, when he seems to have visited both Sudeley and Kenilworth Castle on a Royal Progress.

Richard is credited with having built the large banqueting hall at Sudeley. This &quot;Great Hall&quot; was built in the latest fashions of its time, with a ground floor hall being used for meeting guests and feasting, and the upper great hall being kept specially for the king and his special guest&#x27;s use, with his own bedchambers being connected to this room. When approached from the outside, the edges of the hall&#x27;s oriel windows are decorated with what is presumed to be the White Rose of York.

The banqueting hall now lies in partial ruins, and has been redesigned as a garden, with roses and ivy climbing the walls. In 2018, conservators were working to stabilise the ruin.

After the death of Richard at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, Sudeley, as property of the crown, transferred to King Henry VII, who in turn presented it to his uncle Jasper Tudor.

=== Catherine Parr ===

During his reign, King Henry VIII only stayed at Sudeley once, on his 1535 Royal Progress with Anne Boleyn. In the months leading up to Henry&#x27;s visit to Sudeley, he started to enact the Dissolution of the Monasteries, executing Bishop John Fisher and Sir Thomas More. Moreover, it was while he was at Sudeley that Pope Paul III and Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I started discussing his excommunication and removal.

The death of Henry and the accession of King Edward VI led way for the rise of Edward and Thomas Seymour. Henry&#x27;s will had an &quot;unfulfilled gifts&quot; clause that allowed for his executors to award themselves new lands and titles, which led to Edward being declared Lord Protector of the Realm, and making his brother &quot;Baron Seymour of Sudeley&quot;.

A few months after this, Thomas secretly married Henry&#x27;s widow and final wife, Catherine Parr, without the permission of the king, causing a minor scandal.

In 1548, Catherine, now pregnant, moved with her husband to Sudeley Castle, taking a considerable retinue: 120 Yeomen of the Guard and Gentlemen of the Household, plus her ladies-in-waiting. Prior to her arrival, Seymour had spent &quot;vast amounts of money on the Castle, to fit it for a Queen&quot;. The castle was specially prepared for this move, and descriptions still exist of what Catherine&#x27;s bedchamber looked like. During Parr&#x27;s tenure, one of her attendants was Lady Jane Grey, Thomas Seymour&#x27;s ward, who would be queen for nine days in 1553.

Catherine died at Sudeley on 5 September 1548 from what was described as &quot;childbed fever&quot;, five days after giving birth to her daughter Mary Seymour. At the funeral, Lady Jane Grey was the chief mourner, and ecclesiastical reformer Myles Coverdale preached his first Protestant sermon.

Catherine was buried two days later at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, within the grounds of Sudeley, in what was the first Protestant funeral in English. Over the next two centuries, her original tomb was &quot;mutilated and defaced&quot; and the location of her burial place was lost. In 1782, a coffin was discovered, with a lead plate that read &quot;Here lyeth Quene Kateryne wife to Kyng Henry the VIII and Last the wife of Thomas Lord of Sudeley... dyed 5 September...&quot;. In 1792, vandals dug up the coffin. In 1817, the remains were placed in a stone vault near the remains of the 6th Lord Chandos.

After the chapel restoration was completed in 1863, Parr&#x27;s remains were placed in a new neo-Gothic canopied tomb designed by George Gilbert Scott and created by sculptor John Birnie Philip.

Today, her tomb with its life-sized effigy lying under a canopy of ornately carved marble, is considered a place of pilgrimage.

After Catherine&#x27;s death, her husband Thomas retained Sudeley; he held it until he was executed for treason six months later. Catherine&#x27;s brother William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, then inherited the castle, he in turn held Sudeley until 1553, when he was also accused of treason, and Sudeley was seized by the crown.

=== Late 16th century ===

On 8 April 1554, John Brydges was elevated to Baron Chandos of Sudeley by Queen Mary I. He had previously been Lieutenant of the Tower of London, befriending Lady Jane Grey. He was the one who led Jane to her execution while she was in his care.

His elevation almost certainly came from his assistance in the suppression of the Wyatt rebellion.

His son Edmund Brydges heavily remodelled the castle in the 1560s and 1570s, almost completely rebuilding the outer courtyard, the part of the castle that the current family occupy, into what we see now.

Elizabeth I stayed at Sudeley on three occasions during her reign, first visiting her old friend, the recently widowed Dorothy Bray, Baroness Chandos at Sudeley in 1574. Staying again during the Royal Progress of 1575, that saw Robert Dudley throw a lavish party at Kenilworth Castle in a final attempt to convince her to marry him.

Elizabeth&#x27;s most famous stay at Sudeley was in 1592, when Giles Brydges, 3rd Baron Chandos threw a three-day party for her. Giles extensively landscaped the grounds surrounding the castle in preparation for the visit, and held banquets, plays, dances and gave extravagant gifts during her stay, even presenting his daughter, Elizabeth Brydges to the queen in the guise of Daphne. The visit reputedly almost bankrupted the Brydges family.

The yearly excavations by archaeologists DigVentures began in 2018 and set out to discover more about this party, uncovering extensive Tudor Gardens to the east of the Victorian reconstructed gardens currently on the site. Through these investigations, evidence of multiple phases of landscaping have been revealed, the earliest of which dated to the middle of the 16th century. This is significant as previously these gardens had been attributed to Giles Brydges, 3rd Baron Chandos and the landscaping efforts in advance of Elizabeth&#x27;s visit. LiDAR shows extensive areas surrounding the castle grounds which still may contain the evidence of these works, but it is worth noting that there appears to have been another phase of work, likely associated with the works done by Thomas Seymour in advance of the arrival of Catherine Parr.

=== English Civil War ===

Under the Chandos family, Sudeley continued to prosper and thrive, with Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos gaining the title &quot;King of the Cotswolds&quot; for his magnificent style of living and his generosity. Records show that he had been buying in expensive tapestries from abroad through William Trumbull, envoy to the Archdukes of Austria, to decorate Sudeley. Grey was an influential courtier and an avid traveller, extensively travelling Europe and taking part in the War of the Jülich Succession. He married Lady Ann Stanley, descendant of Henry VIII&#x27;s younger sister Princess Mary Tudor, and possible heir to the throne of England. He died in 1621.

Sudeley&#x27;s final royal occupant was to be Charles I during the English Civil War, a war that was fought between the king and parliament.

The new lord, George Brydges, 6th Baron Chandos supported the royalist cause, and it was while he was supporting Prince Rupert in the siege of Cirencester in January 1643 that Sir Edward Massey, with some five hundred soldiers and two cannons attacked the castle. The small garrison soon fell and the castle was plundered; soon to be abandoned after the news that the royalist army had taken Cirencester and was turning its attention to the castle.

Later that year, after the royalist army failed in the Siege of Gloucester, Charles I set up camp at Sudeley, using it as his base of operations in Gloucestershire; and then set about trying to force Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex into an open pitch battle.

The castle was to switch hands several times during the war, most famously holding out against cannon bombardment by Sir William Waller, until it was betrayed by one of its officers who let the attackers in.

In 1649, after the end of the civil war, parliament ordered the slighting of the castle, to ensure that it could never again be used as a military post. The process took some five months to complete, largely dismantling the inner courtyard and royal apartment rooms, but strangely leaving much of the outer courtyard intact. In 1650, George Brydges, 6th Baron Chandos received some financial compensation for the loss of the castle.

Buried in debt, the lord was unable to rebuild Sudeley, and he died in 1655 after years of being imprisoned in the Tower of London. On his death, the semi derelict castle was inherited by his widow, Lady Jane Savage, separating from the title Baron Chandos for the first time in over a century. She did not have the means to restore it and the castle was a neglected ruin for almost 200 years.

=== Victorian renaissance ===

For almost two centuries, the castle was largely left in ruins, but seemingly never becoming full abandoned.

Sudeley was owned by the Pitt family, descendants of Lady Jane Savage&#x27;s second marriage, who were elevated to a peerage in 1776 as Baron Rivers.

During the 18th century, they rented Sudeley out to tenants, most notably the Lucas family, members of the local gentry. Joseph Lucas entertained King George III on his visit to the castle in 1788, with Mrs Cox the housekeeper saving the king&#x27;s life, catching him after he fell down the Octagon Tower. The Lucas family were also involved in the rediscovery of Catherine Parr&#x27;s tomb in 1782; her corpse was found to be &quot;entire and uncorrupted&quot;.

In 1837, Sudeley Castle was purchased by brothers John and William Dent of Worcester, wealthy glove manufacturers, whose father had founded Dents Gloves in 1777. At the time of the purchase, the castle was &quot;ruinous, but partly occupied by tenants&quot;.

One of the previous tenants, John Attwood, had turned the castle into a public house &quot;The Castle Arms&quot;, and treated it as a quarry, breaking it up and selling off the stone, timber and lead.

A 2020 report described the condition of the castle at the time of the purchase:the castle comprised the remains of two courtyards linked together to form a figure-of-eight plan. Three sides of the outer court were enclosed by two-storey ranges that had, over time, variously accommodated cottages, farm buildings and even a tavern. All the remainder of the building was ruinous, including a medieval barn to the west of the castle and the chapel.

The Dents&#x27; restoration of the castle was quite sensitive, deciding to not entirely rebuild the castle; rather, leaving part of it as picturesque ruins, giving the castle much of its character still seen today. One reliable source states that the restoration was directed by George Gilbert Scott, &quot;working on the western side of the inner court in the style of the existing Medieval and Elizabethan buildings&quot;; Gilbert Scott subsequently began the restoration of the castle&#x27;s free-standing St Mary&#x27;s chapel. 

The chapel is a Grade I* listed property, as &quot;Church of St Mary&quot;. The summary states &quot;Circa 1460 for Ralph Boteler, late C15 or early C16 north aisle, restored 1859–&#x27;63 by Sir G.G. Scott for J.C. Dent&quot;. (Ralph Boteler, 1st Baron Sudeley was the owner during the first restoration of the castle and the chapel.) The summary goes on to state that the chapel exterior dates primarily to the 15th and 16th centuries and the &quot;interior nearly all to 1859&quot;.

When Sudeley was habitable again, the brothers set about filling the castle with art and antiques, buying up a considerable part of Horace Walpole&#x27;s collection during the Strawberry Hill House Sale of 1842, an auction that lasted 32 days. One report states that they furnished the home with &quot;a remarkable antiquarian collection of furniture, glass and paintings that further fleshed out its history, including some very discerning purchases from the Strawberry Hill sale in 1842&quot;.

By 1855, both brothers had died and the castle was inherited by the Dent brothers&#x27; nephew, John Croucher Dent, and his wife, Emma, of the wealthy silk manufacturer family, the Brocklehursts of Macclesfield, who set about improving the castle and adding to its collections.

Emma entertained on a vast scale, throwing costume balls and soirees, often hosting more than 2,000 guests a year; she was also a voracious letter writer, a number of which survive in the castle collection, including ones from Florence Nightingale.

In 1859, Emma decided to attempt a re-creation of a historic garden. In 1885, she began to &quot;substantially enlarge the house and its services ... she remodelled the western side of the castle through the full length of both courtyards, overbuilding one section of the ruins, and beginning a new tower at its north-east corner&quot;. In 1892, she built a &quot;north lodge&quot; on the property. She also arranged for Winchcombe to get its &quot;first piped water supply in 1887&quot;.

After Henry Dent Brocklehurst and his wife Marion inherited the property in 1900, they redecorated. Thirty years later, their son, Jack, arranged to &quot;reconfigure the eastern range of the building&quot; and &quot;the creation of a panelled library furnished with an Elizabethan fireplace&quot;. His wife Mary brought the &quot;Walter Morrison fine picture collection&quot; to the castle; the majority of pieces are still on site.

=== World War II and later on ===
By the start of the Second World War, Sudeley was in straitened circumstances, having suffered from the huge death duties that were levied on it upon the death of Henry Dent-Brocklehurst in 1932, forcing the family to sell off much of the land the castle relied upon for its upkeep.

During the war the castle was used as storage by the Tate Gallery as they moved their art out of London in an attempt to keep it safe during the Blitz.

Camp 37 was located where the visitors&#x27; car park is today, a prisoner of war (POW) camp for captured Italian and German soldiers. The POWs worked on local farms throughout the duration of the war until it was closed down on 20 January 1948.

Willy Reuter, who had been a German PoW at Sudeley Castle recounted:

The American-born Elizabeth first came to Sudeley after her marriage to Mark Dent-Brocklehurst in 1962, and in the subsequent years set about preparing to open the castle up to the public, which they did to great celebration in May 1970. The castle website timeline states that in 1969 the castle was inherited by Mark and his American-born wife Elizabeth; the couple converted the property into a tourist attraction.

Mark died in 1972, leaving Elizabeth, Lady Ashcombe to manage Sudeley on her own, and the castle had to survive its third round of heavy death duties in under 50 years.

Elizabeth, Lady Ashcombe married Henry Cubitt, 4th Baron Ashcombe and uncle of Queen Camilla in 1979. They decided to keep Sudeley open to the public as a historic attraction and set about a major restoration of the castle. Lord Ashcombe passed away in 2013.
The Sudeley website confirms that in 1979, Elizabeth (Lady Ashcombe, by that time) and her children Henry and Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst &quot;took over management of the visitor attraction&quot;.

BBC Four featured an investigation into the castle on 27 June 2007 titled &quot;Crisis at the Castle&quot;. This detailed the turmoil associated with managing the castle by the three members of the Dent-Brocklehurst family. Closing the castle to the general public on some weekdays meant that visitors were disheartened when embarking on their day trips, and resulted in a dramatic fall in visitor numbers in the three years leading up to the creation of the programme.

News reports in April 2008 stated that the family was selling a painting by J.M.W. Turner at auction because the attraction was &quot;losing £100,000 a year&quot; and required a restoration.

Sudeley held a re-enactment of the funeral of Catherine Parr in September 2012, with guidance from historian Dr David Starkey; the event received positive feedback from re-enactment societies.

==Recent history==
Sudeley is operated by the family and remains the home of Elizabeth, Lady Ashcombe and &quot;her son, daughter and their families&quot; as of 2021. The family is committed to the continued preservation of the castle, its treasures and the ongoing restoration and regeneration of the gardens of Elizabeth, Lady Ashcombe, her children, Henry and Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst, and grandchildren. As of September 2019, BBC News referred to Lady Ashcombe as &quot;the castle&#x27;s owner&quot;.

The castle exhibitions were redesigned and relaunched in 2018 as &quot;Royal Sudeley 1,000: Trials, Triumphs and Treasures&quot;, and is set in the 15th-century service wing, covering three floors. It takes visitors through the 1,000 years of Sudeley&#x27;s history, highlighting important aspects of the castle&#x27;s past, and exhibiting the historical artefacts and pieces of artwork in the collection.

The castle opens to the public seasonally and sections are used as a hotel, but it also remains a family home, with Elizabeth, Lady Ashcombe often called the &quot;chatelaine of Sudeley&quot;. As of 2019, one of the tours of the castle included a visit to the &quot;family&#x27;s private apartments available daily from Spring to the end of October.

Sudeley has also been used as a wedding venue for some years. Several celebrity weddings have taken place at the castle, from Elizabeth Hurley&#x27;s wedding in 2007, to Felicity Jones&#x27;s wedding to Charles Guard in 2018.

In September 2019, thieves stole items from the castle&#x27;s royal exhibition, including &quot;rare keepsakes made from gold and precious stones and presented by King Edward VII to his last mistress&quot;.

Due to restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the castle was closed for some months; certain parts re-opened for a time during 2020. As of early March 2021, the Sudeley Castle &amp; Gardens website was indicating that &quot;exhibitions are closed until 2021. Reopening dates and information will be announced as soon as possible&quot;.

==Gardens and parkland==
Sudeley Castle sits at the heart of a estate that lies nestled among the Cotswold valleys.

The estate itself is made up of a mix of open pasture fields and woodland, and is crisscrossed by a number of public footpaths, most notably, the Cotswold Way, a long-distance footpath. These footpaths have connected Sudeley with other historic towns and monuments, such as Hailes Abbey, Broadway, Belas Knap and Stanway House.

The castle gardens cover some and are available for the public to visit during the castle&#x27;s open season.The garden is split into ten separate gardens, the centrepiece being the Queens&#x27; Garden. The Queens&#x27; Garden is the Victorian replanting of an original Elizabethan parterre garden that had been discovered in the same location, the large yew hedges surrounding it date back to 1860.

Celebrated rosarian Jane Fearnley-Whittingstall is responsible for the current rose display in the Queens&#x27; Garden, which is now home to over 80 different varieties of rose.

Another garden at Sudeley is The Knot Garden, made up of more than 1,200 box hedges, its intricate design drew inspiration from the pattern of the dress worn by Elizabeth I in &quot;An Allegory of the Tudor Succession&quot;, a painting that hangs in the castle.

St Mary&#x27;s Church, in which Catherine Parr is buried, is bordered by the White Garden, which includes peonies, clematis, roses and tulips, where Catherine and her companion, Lady Jane Grey, would have entered the church for daily prayers.

Sudeley is also home to one of the largest public collections of endangered pheasants in the world, and works closely with the World Pheasant Association. The pheasantry which has been operating at the castle for over 30 years is part of a wider breeding program which has been set up in the hope of increasing the numbers of critically endangered birds before hopefully reintroducing them into their natural habitats.

==Tourist attractions==
Sudeley Castle has been a tourist attraction since the early 18th century, drawing antiquarians, print makers and artists from across Britain. Some of the earliest of these being Samuel and Nathaniel Buck who visited and drew the castle in 1732 for their book &quot;Buck&#x27;s Antiquities&quot;. The castle, as a romantic ruin, welcomed George III who visited in 1788 whilst taking the waters at Cheltenham Spa.

Today, Sudeley is one of the few remaining castles left in England that is still a private residence. The Dent-Brocklehurst family remain dedicated to making the castle and gardens as accessible as possible to the general public, opening it seasonally to visitors, albeit, with the private family quarters remaining largely closed.

=== Art collection ===
The bedrock of Sudeley&#x27;s art collection was built upon the Strawberry Hill House Sale of 1842. It was one of the most impressive auctions of its day, lasting some 32 days, selling off the art collection of Horace Walpole, son of Robert Walpole, who is generally considered the first Prime Minister of Great Britain. The collection was added to throughout the Victorian age, and then again on the inheritance part of the art collection of Victorian businessman James Morrison of Basildon Park.

Not everything in the castle&#x27;s collection neatly falls into the art category, with artefacts such as a prayer book and love letter belonging to Catherine Parr, weaponry, and the &quot;Bohun Book of Hours,&quot; one of only six of its kind to survive to the modern day.

Not all the art collection is on display to the public, with a selection of it in the exhibitions; the rest is kept in the family&#x27;s private rooms. The castle does hold specialist art tours that takes small groups of visitors around the private quarters to view the art; however, these need to be booked in advance to ensure availability.

This is a selection of some of the art highlighted at the castle.

* &quot;An Allegory of the Tudor Succession&quot; Commissioned by Elizabeth I for her spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham and attributed to Lucas de Heere
* &quot;Rise of the River Stour at Stourhead&quot; by J. M. W. Turner. Dated to 1817 and exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1825; the Tate holds the preparatory sketches for this painting
* &quot;A Portrait of Peter Paul Rubens&quot; by Anthony van Dyck
* &quot;Flora&quot; by Bernardino Luini, painted circa 1515
* &quot;Miniature of King Henry VIII&quot; attributed to Lucas Horenbout
* &quot;Miniature of Queen Catherine Parr&quot; by Hans Holbein the Younger

=== Textile collection ===
Sudeley Castle&#x27;s textile collection was assembled by Emma Dent in the 19th century, it is considered one of the finest collections in the country, and was for a time, on loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Due to how delicate some of the pieces are, a select part of it is on display at the castle in the exhibitions, while the rest is kept in protective storage.

This is a selection of some of the textile highlighted at the castle.

* Louis XV Aubusson bed hangings, believed to have belonged to Marie Antoinette
* The Sudeley Stumpwork Box, dating to about 1660
* A waistcoat believed to have belonged to Charles I
* A 16th-century lace canopy, said to have been made by Anne Boleyn for the christening of Elizabeth I
* A fragment of cloth said to have come from the dress of Catherine Parr after the rediscovery and opening of her tomb in 1782
* Early 17th-century Sheldon Tapestry, woven in wool, silk and metal thread, with floral designs and biblical scenes. Parallels have been drawn between it and the Filioli Tapestry that was bought by J. P. Morgan in 1911 from Knole House.

==In popular culture==

Sudeley is regarded by some as the model for Blandings Castle in the novels by P. G. Wodehouse. The adaptation for BBC television of Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; (1995) was filmed there. The castle has been used as a location in other films and on television including:

* &quot;The Pallisers&quot; (1974)
* &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1976) 
* &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; (1994) 
* &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; (2008)
* &quot;Father Brown&quot; (2013)
* &quot;Antiques Road Trip&quot; (2015)
* &quot;The Great Chelsea Garden Challenge&quot; (2015)
* &quot;The White Princess&quot; (2017)
* &quot;An American Aristocrat&#x27;s Guide to Great Estates&quot; (2020)
* &quot;The Spanish Princess&quot; (2020)

<text>In organic chemistry, an aromatic amine is an organic compound consisting of an aromatic ring attached to an amine. It is a broad class of compounds that encompasses anilines, but also many more complex aromatic rings and many amine substituents beyond . Such compounds occur widely.

Aromatic amines are widely used as precursor to pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and dyes.

== Aromatic amines in textiles ==

Since August 2012, the new standard EN 14362-1:2012 &quot;Textiles - Methods for determination of certain aromatic amines derived from azo colorants - Part 1: Detection of the use of certain azo colorants accessible with and without extracting the fibres&quot; is effective. It had been officially approved by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and supersedes the test standards EN 14362-1: 2003 and EN 14362-2: 2003.

The standard describes a procedure to detect EU banned aromatic amines derived from azo colorants in textile fibres, including natural, man-made, regenerated, and blended fibres. The standard is also relevant for all coloured textiles, e.g. dyed, printed, and coated textiles.

<text>The fluctuation theorem (FT), which originated from statistical mechanics, deals with the relative probability that the entropy of a system which is currently away from thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e., maximum entropy) will increase or decrease over a given amount of time. While the second law of thermodynamics predicts that the entropy of an isolated system should tend to increase until it reaches equilibrium, it became apparent after the discovery of statistical mechanics that the second law is only a statistical one, suggesting that there should always be some nonzero probability that the entropy of an isolated system might spontaneously &quot;decrease&quot;; the fluctuation theorem precisely quantifies this probability.

== Statement ==

Roughly, the fluctuation theorem relates to the probability distribution of the time-averaged irreversible entropy production, denoted formula_1. The theorem states that, in systems away from equilibrium over a finite time &quot;t&quot;, the ratio between the probability that formula_1 takes on a value &quot;A&quot; and the probability that it takes the opposite value, −&quot;A&quot;, will be exponential in &quot;At&quot;.
In other words, for a finite non-equilibrium system in a finite time, the FT gives a precise mathematical expression for the probability that entropy will flow in a direction &quot;opposite&quot; to that dictated by the second law of thermodynamics.

Mathematically, the FT is expressed as:
: formula_3

This means that as the time or system size increases (since formula_4 is extensive), the probability of observing an entropy production opposite to that dictated by the second law of thermodynamics decreases exponentially. The FT is one of the few expressions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that is valid far from equilibrium.

Note that the FT does not state that the second law of thermodynamics is wrong or invalid. The second law of thermodynamics is a statement about macroscopic systems. The FT is more general. It can be applied to both microscopic and macroscopic systems. When applied to macroscopic systems, the FT is equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics.

== History ==
The FT was first proposed and tested using computer simulations, by Denis Evans, E.G.D. Cohen and Gary Morriss in 1993. The first derivation was given by Evans and Debra Searles in 1994. Since then, much mathematical and computational work has been done to show that the FT applies to a variety of statistical ensembles. The first laboratory experiment that verified the validity of the FT was carried out in 2002. In this experiment, a plastic bead was pulled through a solution by a laser. Fluctuations in the velocity were recorded that were opposite to what the second law of thermodynamics would dictate for macroscopic systems. In 2020, observations at high spatial and spectral resolution of the solar photosphere have shown that solar turbulent convection satisfies the symmetries predicted by the fluctuation relation at a local level.

== Second law inequality ==
A simple consequence of the fluctuation theorem given above is that if we carry out an arbitrarily large ensemble of experiments from some initial time t=0, and perform an ensemble average of time averages of the entropy production, then an exact consequence of the FT is that the ensemble average cannot be negative for any value of the averaging time t:
: formula_5

This inequality is called the second law inequality. This inequality can be proved for systems with time dependent fields of arbitrary magnitude and arbitrary time dependence.

It is important to understand what the second law inequality does not imply. It does not imply that the ensemble averaged entropy production is non-negative at all times. This is untrue, as consideration of the entropy production in a viscoelastic fluid subject to a sinusoidal time dependent shear rate shows (e.g., rogue waves). In this example the ensemble average of the time integral of the entropy production over one cycle is however nonnegative – as expected from the second law inequality.

== Nonequilibrium partition identity ==

Another remarkably simple and elegant consequence of the fluctuation theorem is the so-called &quot;nonequilibrium partition identity&quot; (NPI):
: formula_6

Thus in spite of the second law inequality, which might lead you to expect that the average would decay exponentially with time, the exponential probability ratio given by the FT &quot;exactly&quot; cancels the negative exponential in the average above leading to an average which is unity for all time.

== Implications ==

There are many important implications from the fluctuation theorem. One is that small machines (such as nanomachines or even mitochondria in a cell) will spend part of their time actually running in &quot;reverse&quot;. What is meant by &quot;reverse&quot; is that it is possible to observe that these small molecular machines are able to generate work by taking heat from the environment. This is possible because there exists a symmetry relation in the work fluctuations associated with the forward and reverse changes a system undergoes as it is driven away from thermal equilibrium by the action of an external perturbation, which is a result predicted by the Crooks fluctuation theorem. The environment itself continuously drives these molecular machines away from equilibrium and the fluctuations it generates over the system are very relevant because the probability of observing an apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics becomes significant at this scale.

This is counterintuitive because, from a macroscopic point of view, it would describe complex processes running in reverse. For example, a jet engine running in reverse, taking in ambient heat and exhaust fumes to generate kerosene and oxygen. Nevertheless, the size of such a system makes this observation almost impossible to occur. Such a process is possible to be observed microscopically because, as it has been stated above, the probability of observing a &quot;reverse&quot; trajectory depends on system size and is significant for molecular machines if an appropriate measurement instrument is available. This is the case with the development of new biophysical instruments such as the optical tweezers or the atomic force microscope. Crooks fluctuation theorem has been verified through RNA folding experiments.

== Dissipation function ==
Strictly speaking the fluctuation theorem refers to a quantity known as the dissipation function. In thermostatted nonequilibrium states that are close to equilibrium, the long time average of the dissipation function is equal to the average entropy production. However the FT refers to fluctuations rather than averages. The dissipation function is defined as
: formula_7
where &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, formula_8 is the initial (t = 0) distribution of molecular states formula_9, and formula_10 is the molecular state arrived at after time t, under the exact time reversible equations of motion. formula_11 is the INITIAL distribution of those time evolved states.

Note: in order for the FT to be valid we require that formula_12. This condition is known as the condition of ergodic consistency. It is widely satisfied in common statistical ensembles - e.g. the canonical ensemble.

The system may be in contact with a large heat reservoir in order to thermostat the system of interest. If this is the case formula_13 is the heat lost to the reservoir over the time (0,t) and T is the absolute equilibrium temperature of the reservoir. With this definition of the dissipation function the precise statement of the FT simply replaces entropy production with the dissipation function in each of the FT equations above.

Example: If one considers electrical conduction across an electrical resistor in contact with a large heat reservoir at temperature T, then the dissipation function is
: formula_14
the total electric current density J multiplied by the voltage drop across the circuit, formula_15, and the system volume V, divided by the absolute temperature T, of the heat reservoir times the Boltzmann constant. Thus the dissipation function is easily recognised as the Ohmic work done on the system divided by the temperature of the reservoir. Close to equilibrium the long time average of this quantity is (to leading order in the voltage drop), equal to the average spontaneous entropy production per unit time. However, the fluctuation theorem applies to systems arbitrarily far from equilibrium where the definition of the spontaneous entropy production is problematic.

== Relation to Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox ==

The second law of thermodynamics, which predicts that the entropy of an isolated system out of equilibrium should tend to increase rather than decrease or stay constant, stands in apparent contradiction with the time-reversible equations of motion for classical and quantum systems. The time reversal symmetry of the equations of motion show that if one films a given time dependent physical process, then playing the movie of that process backwards does not violate the laws of mechanics. It is often argued that for every forward trajectory in which entropy increases, there exists a time reversed anti trajectory where entropy decreases, thus if one picks an initial state randomly from the system&#x27;s phase space and evolves it forward according to the laws governing the system, decreasing entropy should be just as likely as increasing entropy. It might seem that this is incompatible with the second law of thermodynamics which predicts that entropy tends to increase. The problem of deriving irreversible thermodynamics from time-symmetric fundamental laws is referred to as Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox.

The mathematical derivation of the fluctuation theorem and in particular the second law inequality shows that, for a nonequilibrium process, the ensemble averaged value for the dissipation function will be greater than zero. This result requires causality, i.e. that cause (the initial conditions) precede effect (the value taken on by the dissipation function). This is clearly demonstrated in section 6 of that paper, where it is shown how one could use the same laws of mechanics to extrapolate &quot;backwards&quot; from a later state to an earlier state, and in this case the fluctuation theorem would lead us to predict the ensemble average dissipation function to be negative, an anti-second law. This second prediction, which is inconsistent with the real world, is obtained using an anti-causal assumption. That is to say that effect (the value taken on by the dissipation function) precedes the cause (here the later state has been incorrectly used for the initial conditions). The fluctuation theorem shows how the second law is a consequence of the assumption of causality. When we solve a problem we set the initial conditions and then let the laws of mechanics evolve the system forward in time, we don&#x27;t solve problems by setting the final conditions and letting the laws of mechanics run backwards in time.

== Summary ==

The fluctuation theorem is of fundamental importance to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
The FT (together with the universal causation proposition) gives a generalisation of the second law of thermodynamics which includes as a special case, the conventional second law. It is then easy to prove the Second Law Inequality and the NonEquilibrium Partition Identity. When combined with the central limit theorem, the FT also implies the Green-Kubo relations for linear transport coefficients, close to equilibrium. The FT is however, more general than the Green-Kubo Relations because unlike them, the FT applies to fluctuations far from equilibrium. In spite of this fact, scientists have not yet been able to derive the equations for nonlinear response theory from the FT.

The FT does not imply or require that the distribution of time averaged dissipation be Gaussian. There are many examples known where the distribution of time averaged dissipation is non-Gaussian and yet the FT (of course) still correctly describes the probability ratios.

Lastly the theoretical constructs used to prove the FT can be applied to &quot;nonequilibrium transitions&quot; between two different &quot;equilibrium&quot; states. When this is done the so-called Jarzynski equality or nonequilibrium work relation, can be derived. This equality shows how equilibrium free energy differences can be computed or measured (in the laboratory), from nonequilibrium path integrals. Previously quasi-static (equilibrium) paths were required.

The reason why the fluctuation theorem is so fundamental is that its proof requires so little. It requires: 
* knowledge of the mathematical form of the initial distribution of molecular states,
* that all time evolved final states at time &quot;t&quot;, must be present with nonzero probability in the distribution of initial states (&quot;t&quot; = 0) – the so-called condition of &quot;ergodic consistency&quot; and
* an assumption of time reversal symmetry.

In regard to the latter &quot;assumption&quot;, while the equations of motion of quantum dynamics may be time-reversible, quantum processes are nondeterministic by nature. What state a wave function collapses into cannot be predicted mathematically, and further the unpredictability of a quantum system comes not from the myopia of an observer&#x27;s perception, but on the intrinsically nondeterministic nature of the system itself.

In physics, the laws of motion of classical mechanics exhibit time reversibility, as long as the operator π reverses the conjugate momenta of all the particles of the system, i.e. formula_16 (T-symmetry).

In quantum mechanical systems, however, the weak nuclear force is not invariant under T-symmetry alone; if weak interactions are present reversible dynamics are still possible, but only if the operator π also reverses the signs of all the charges and the parity of the spatial co-ordinates (C-symmetry and P-symmetry). This reversibility of several linked properties is known as CPT symmetry.

Thermodynamic processes can be reversible or irreversible, depending on the change in entropy during the process.

<text>Moreton-in-Marsh is a market town in the Evenlode Valley, within the Cotswolds district and Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Gloucestershire, England.

Its flat and low-lying site is surrounded by the Cotswold Hills. The River Evenlode rises near Batsford, runs around the edge of Moreton and meanders towards Oxford, where it flows into the river Thames just east of Eynsham.

Just over east of Moreton, the Four shire stone marked the boundary of the historic counties of Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Oxfordshire, until the re-organisation of the county boundaries in 1931. Since then it marks the meeting place of Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Oxfordshire.

==Toponymy ==
Moreton is derived from Old English which means &quot;Farmstead on the Moor&quot; and &quot;in Marsh&quot; is from &quot;henne&quot; and &quot;mersh&quot; meaning a marsh used by birds such as moorhens. An alternative suggestion is that &#x27;Marsh&#x27; is a corruption of &#x27;March&#x27;, early English for boundary.

==History==
A settlement was built during the British Iron Age, just north-west of the town centre near the cricket ground. Archaeological research has found Roman pottery and coins at the site, showing that it remained occupied after the Roman invasion of Britain. During this period, the Fosse Way, one of the best preserved Roman routes in Britain, was constructed. It was initially constructed by the Roman army but was subsequently maintained by the local Civitas. The course can be traced through the county by the modern roads that tend to follow its course, although there are deviations such as south of the town where it crosses the hill into Stow-on-the-Wold.

Moreton is first mentioned as a Saxon settlement around 577 AD. Following the Norman conquest of Britain, the township was part of the monastic property held by Westminster Abbey in London. Abbott Richard of Barking began developing Moreton as a medieval market town between 1222 and 1246. The new town was built on common land bordering the Fosse Way to the north-west of the original Saxon settlement. St David&#x27;s Church is in the centre of the original settlement, which is still called &quot;Old Town&quot;. To accommodate medieval markets, the new town was developed with a long and wide High Street.

The town&#x27;s economy thrived, thanks to wool and cloth-making in the medieval era. &quot;It&#x27;s why the high street has so many elegant 18th century inns and houses.&quot;

The Curfew Tower, on the corner of Oxford Street, probably dates from the 16th century. Its bell was cast in 1633 and its clock was built in 1648. The Royalist cavalry was based in the town during the Civil War; in 1644, King Charles I of England stopped at the White Hart Royal in 1637 and granted a charter for the market.

The Church of England parish church of Saint David began as a chapel of ease for Blockley, to which the residents of Moreton had to transport their dead for burial. The early history of the church in Moreton is not clear, but there is evidence that a primitive Celtic place of worship preceded the church on the present site, which had seven springs. The church at Moreton came under the jurisdiction of the Batsford Estate, when that estate was given to the Bishops of Worcester in the 12th century. Latterly, the church in Moreton was a chapel-at-ease for Batsford, which was technically the parish church. The appointment of the vicar for Batsford with Moreton alternates between the Bishop of Gloucester and the Lord of the Manor at Batsford, currently Lord Dulverton, who, until the Second World War, exercised his right to collect a shilling (5 pence) a year for every shop window facing Moreton High Street. There is a tradition that the church was rebuilt and reconsecrated in the middle of the 16th century. The nave was enlarged in 1790, with a £1,000 gift from Samuel Wilson Warneford, most of the church was rebuilt in 1858 and the tower was replaced in 1860. The chancel and south aisle were enlarged in 1892 and the east end of the south aisle has been used as a chapel since 1927.

A nonconformist congregation started meeting in Moreton in 1796 and was constituted as a Congregational church in 1801; it had a chapel built in 1817. In 1860–61, the Congregationalists replaced the chapel with a new one on the same site in a mixed neo-Grecian and Romanesque style. The congregation voted against the merger with the Presbyterians and remains a Congregational Chapel. The Roman Catholics, without their own church in Moreton, held a mass there on Sunday mornings for several years.

According to one report, the town was in a suitable location for the &quot;old coaching route from London to Worcester [and] thrived as a stopping place for stagecoaches, in particular The Redesdale Arms and The White Hart Royal.&quot;

The Stratford and Moreton Tramway was built between 1821 and 1826, linking Moreton with the Stratford-on-Avon Canal at Stratford. It was horse-drawn until 1859, when the section between Moreton and Shipston-on-Stour was converted to a branch line railway operated with steam locomotives. The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway, built between 1845 and 1851, passes through Moreton. The railway station was opened in 1853. The Great Western Railway (GWR) took over the OW&amp;W Railway in 1862 and the Shipston-on-Stour branch in 1868. The GWR withdrew passenger trains from the branch in 1929 and British Railways withdrew freight traffic and the last train, Driver Ted Hardiman, Fireman Ken Hughes and Guard Perry, and one paying passenger, Christopher Horne, ran on 2 May 1960.

The OW&amp;W Railway is now part of the Cotswold line. The line between Oxford (Wolverton Junction) and Worcester (Norton Junction) was singled in the 1970s, except for the distance between Shipton-under-Wychwood to Moreton-in-Marsh, but subsequently the double track has been replaced, except between Evesham and Worcester (Norton Junction) in 2011. Traffic to and from Long Marston uses the west end of the line and freight services are planned to re-use this route. In 2019, the platforms were lengthened after the removal of all sidings from the station area.

Redesdale Hall, which was designed by the architects Sir Ernest George and Harold Peto, became the market hall and town hall for the town and was completed in 1887. The town was often misdescribed as &quot;Moreton-in-the-Marsh&quot; into the early 20th century. The name was confirmed as &quot;Moreton-in-Marsh&quot; before 1930.

In 1940, a large area of level land east of the town was developed as RAF Moreton-in-Marsh and used as a training airfield, largely by Wellington bombers. 38 men flying to or from RAF Moreton-in-Marsh died during the Second World War. The former airfield is now the Fire Service College, where senior fire officers from brigades all over the UK undergo operational, management and leadership training. The same complex is also now the headquarters of the Institution of Fire Engineers, the professional body for fire fighters, officers and civilians with an interest in fire engineering.

Moreton-in-Marsh and Batsford War Memorial is in the High Street and commemorates the dead of the First and Second World Wars, together with one serviceman killed subsequently. One woman is featured: Diana Hope Rowden, an agent of the Special Operations Executive who was killed in a concentration camp in 1944, had served previously at RAF Moreton-in-Marsh. Despite the number of serving men in the Glorious Glosters, all these men of the town returned safely from the Korean War.

Floods, which blocked the High Street, were fairly regular from the 1940s to the 1960s, until works were carried out on the ditches around the town and the camber on the A44 descending to Moreton from Bourton on the Hill; these works appear to have resolved most of the problems. The last time Moreton was badly flooded was in 2007.

There was a Roman fort near Dorn (one mile north-west of Moreton). The annual &quot;Moreton and District Agricultural Show&quot;, held on the first Saturday in September, is held on part of the site of the fort on the Batsford Estate; the show has been running since 1949.

The railway line to Worcester runs alongside the showground and, at Dorn, reaches the highest point between Oxford and Worcester; this is also the river Thames/river Severn watershed.

Moreton was once the headquarters of the railway spot-hire company Cotswold Rail.

==Governance==
The town is represented on Cotswold District Council by councillors from two wards. Since May 2023, Angus Jenkinson of the Liberal Democrats represents Moreton East and Daryl Corps of the Conservatives represents Moreton West.

==Transport==
The town is served by Moreton-in-Marsh railway station, a stop on the Cotswold Line. Great Western Railway operates regular train services to , , and .

Local bus services are operated predominantly by Stagecoach Midlands and Pulhams Coaches; key routes that serve the town lead to Stratford-upon-Avon, Bourton-on-the-Water and Cheltenham.

The town stands at the crossroads of the Fosse Way Roman road (now the A429) and the A44.

==Amenities==

Moreton has many buildings in characteristic Cotswold stone. There are two supermarkets (Aldi and the Co-Operative), two general stores (Spar and Tesco Express), and a number of antique shops, bars, cafes, hotels, inns and restaurants located down the High Street and Stow Road. A Caravan Club site is a short walk east on the Broadway Road (A44), past the Wellington Aviation Museum, a museum of the history of the Vickers Wellington bomber. Other local attractions include Batsford Arboretum near Batsford village and the onion-domed Sezincote house and gardens.

The White Hart Royal, originally a seventeenth-century coaching inn, was occupied by King Charles I when he took shelter in the building following the Battle of Marston Moor (during the First English Civil War of 1644–1646) and supposedly left without paying his bill.

The Bell is an eighteenth-century inn on the western side of the High Street. It was regularly visited by author J. R. R. Tolkien during his early years at the University of Oxford. The inn has been attributed as inspiration for The Prancing Pony which features in The Lord of the Rings (1954–1955).

The 300-year-old Black Bear Inn, on the eastern side of the High Street near the Curfew Tower, has enjoyed a long association with football. An ex-professional footballer, landlord Jim Steele, was in the Southampton team that famously beat favourites Manchester United in the 1976 FA Cup Final. Chelsea legend Peter Osgood, who was also in the winning Southampton side, was a great friend of Jim and often visited the Black Bear before he died in March 2006.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Lark Stoke TV transmitter.

The town is served by both BBC CWR and BBC Radio Gloucestershire. Other radio stations including Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West, Capital Mid-Counties, Corinium Radio and Cotswolds Radio, community based radio station.

The town is served by the weekly local newspaper, Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard.

==Sport==
The town also has its own non league football club, Moreton Rangers who currently play in the Hellenic Football League at the London Road ground. The Batsford Road cricket ground was opened in 1859 and has hosted first-class and List A cricket for Gloucestershire County Cricket Club.

<doc id="333175" wikidata="Q425161" url="?curid=333175" title="Mesitylene">
<text>Mesitylene or 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene is a derivative of benzene with three methyl substituents positioned symmetrically around the ring. The other two isomeric trimethylbenzenes are 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (pseudocumene) and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene (hemimellitene). All three compounds have the formula C6H3(CH3)3, which is commonly abbreviated C6H3Me3. Mesitylene is a colorless liquid with sweet aromatic odor. It is a component of coal tar, which is its traditional source. It is a precursor to diverse fine chemicals. The mesityl group (Mes) is a substituent with the formula C6H2Me3 and is found in various other compounds.

==Preparation==
Mesitylene is prepared by transalkylation of xylene over solid acid catalyst:
:2 C6H4(CH3)2 ⇌ C6H3(CH3)3 + C6H5CH3
:C6H4(CH3)2 + CH3OH → C6H3(CH3)3 + H2O

Although impractical, it could be prepared by trimerization of propyne, also requiring an acid catalyst, which yields a mixture of 1,3,5- and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzenes.

Trimerization of acetone via aldol condensation, which is catalyzed and dehydrated by sulfuric acid is another method of synthesizing mesitylene.

==Reactions==
Oxidation of mesitylene with nitric acid yields trimesic acid, C6H3(COOH)3. Using manganese dioxide, a milder oxidising agent, 3,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde is formed. Mesitylene is oxidised by trifluoroperacetic acid to produce mesitol (2,4,6-trimethylphenol). Bromination occurs readily, giving mesityl bromide:
:(CH3)3C6H3 + Br2 → (CH3)3C6H2Br + HBr

Mesitylene is a ligand in organometallic chemistry, one example being the organomolybdenum complex which can be prepared from molybdenum hexacarbonyl.

==Applications==
Mesitylene is mainly used as a precursor to 2,4,6-trimethylaniline, a precursor to colorants. This derivative is prepared by selective mononitration of mesitylene, avoiding oxidation of the methyl groups.

===Niche uses===

Mesitylene is used in the laboratory as a specialty solvent. In the electronics industry, mesitylene has been used as a developer for photopatternable silicones due to its solvent properties.

The three aromatic hydrogen atoms of mesitylene are in identical chemical shift environments. Therefore, they only give a single peak near 6.8 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum; the same is also true for the nine methyl protons, which give a singlet near 2.3 ppm. For this reason, mesitylene is sometimes used as an internal standard in NMR samples that contain aromatic protons.

Uvitic acid is obtained by oxidizing mesitylene or by condensing pyruvic acid with baryta water.

The Gattermann reaction can be simplified by replacing the HCN/AlCl3 combination with zinc cyanide (Zn(CN)2). Although it is highly toxic, Zn(CN)2 is a solid, making it safer to work with than gaseous hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The Zn(CN)2 reacts with the HCl to form the key HCN reactant and ZnCl2 that serves as the Lewis-acid catalyst &quot;in-situ&quot;. An example of the Zn(CN)2 method is the synthesis of mesitaldehyde from mesitylene.

==History==
Mesitylene was first prepared in 1837 by Robert Kane, an Irish chemist, by heating acetone with concentrated sulfuric acid. He named his new substance &quot;mesitylene&quot; because the German chemist Carl Reichenbach had named acetone &quot;mesit&quot; (from the Greek μεσίτης, the mediator), and Kane believed that his reaction had dehydrated mesit, converting it to an alkene, &quot;mesitylene&quot;. However, Kane&#x27;s determination of the chemical composition (&quot;empirical formula&quot;) of mesitylene was incorrect. The correct empirical formula was provided by August W. von Hofmann in 1849. In 1866 Adolf von Baeyer gave a correct mesitylene&#x27;s empirical formula; however, with a wrong structure of tetracyclo[3.1.1.11,3.13,5]nonane. A conclusive proof that mesitylene was trimethylbenzene was provided by Albert Ladenburg in 1874; however, assuming wrong benzene structure of prismane.

The group (CH3)3C6H2- is called mesityl (organic group symbol: Mes). Mesityl derivatives, e.g. tetramesityldiiron, are typically prepared from the Grignard reagent (CH3)3C6H2MgBr. Due to its large steric demand, the mesityl group is used as a large blocking group in asymmetric catalysis (to enhance diastereo- or enantioselectivity) and organometallic chemistry (to stabilize low oxidation state or low coordination number metal centers). Larger analogues with even greater steric demand, for example 2,6-diisopropylphenyl (Dipp) and the analogously named Tripp ((iPr)3C6H2, Is) and supermesityl ((&quot;t&quot;Bu)3C6H2, Mes*) groups, may be even more effective toward achieving these goals.

==Safety and the environment==
Mesitylene is also a major urban volatile organic compound (VOC) which results from combustion. It plays a significant role in aerosol and tropospheric ozone formation as well as other reactions in atmospheric chemistry.

<text>Barnsley Football Club is a professional football club in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England, which competes in , the third level of the English football league system.

Nicknamed &quot;the Colliers&quot;, they were founded in 1887 by Reverend Tiverton Preedy and moved to Oakwell the following year. The club&#x27;s original blue colours were changed to red and white in 1904. Barnsley spent the 1890s in the Sheffield &amp; District, Midland and Yorkshire leagues, before gaining admittance to the Football League Second Division in 1898. They twice reached the final of the FA Cup whilst still in the second tier, losing to Newcastle United in 1910 and winning the competition over West Bromwich Albion in 1912. The club suffered relegation in 1933, but secured promotion as Third Division North champions in 1934. They won the Third Division North title for a second time in 1939, having been relegated the previous season. Relegated again in 1953, they secured another Third Division North title in 1955. However, further relegations left them in the fourth tier of English football by 1966. Promotion from the Fourth Division was achieved in 1968, though they were relegated after just four seasons. The club secured two promotions in three years under the stewardship of Allan Clarke and Norman Hunter, and from 1981 would spend sixteen consecutive years in the second tier.

Premier League football was secured for the 1997–98 season with a second-place finish in the First Division, though they were relegated after one season and dropped down to the third tier in 2002. Barnsley won the 2006 League One play-off final and remained in the Championship for eight seasons. Relegated in 2014, they won both the 2016 Football League Trophy final and the 2016 League One play-off final, though this time spent just two seasons in the Championship. In 2017, a majority stake in the club was sold to a consortium that included Chien Lee, Neerav Parekh and Billy Beane. Barnsley won promotion from League One with a second-place finish in the year 2019, before being relegated out of the Championship again in the year of 2022. Barnsley have spent more seasons and played more games at the second level of English football than any other team. The club&#x27;s main rivals are fellow Yorkshire clubs Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United, Leeds United, Huddersfield Town and Rotherham United.

== History ==

=== Beginnings and FA Cup glory ===
Barnsley were established in 1887 as Barnsley St Peter&#x27;s by Reverend Tiverton Preedy, and they played in the Sheffield and District League from 1890 and in the Midland League from 1895. In 1897, the club dropped the St Peter&#x27;s part of its name to become simply Barnsley. They joined the Football League in 1898, and struggled in the Second Division for the first decade, due in part to ongoing financial difficulties. In 1910, the club reached the FA Cup final, where they were defeated by Newcastle United. In 1912, they reached the FA Cup final again, and defeated West Bromwich Albion 1–0 to win the trophy for the first time in their history. When league football restarted after the First World War, the 1919–20 season brought some significant changes to the league. The main difference was that the First Division would now have 22 teams, rather than 20. The bottom team from the previous season was Tottenham Hotspur and they were relegated. The first extra place in the First Division went to Chelsea, who retained their place despite finishing second bottom and therefore in the relegation places. Derby County and Preston North End were promoted from the Second Division which left one place to be filled.

Having finished the previous season&#x27;s Second Division in third place, Barnsley expected to achieve First Division status for the first time, but the Football League instead chose to call a ballot of the clubs. The League voted to promote sixth-placed Arsenal, for reasons of history over merit. Sir Henry Norris, the then Arsenal chairman, argued that Arsenal be promoted for their &quot;long service to league football&quot;, having been the first League club from the South of England. It has been alleged that this was due to backroom deals and even outright bribery by Sir Henry Norris, colluding with his friend John McKenna, the chairman of Liverpool and the Football League, who recommended Arsenal&#x27;s promotion at the AGM. No conclusive proof of wrongdoing has come to light, though other aspects of Norris&#x27;s financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter. Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929, having been found guilty by the Football Association of financial irregularities; he was found to have misused his expenses account, and to have pocketed the proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus.

=== Pre-war and post-war era ===
The club came close to reaching the First Division in their early years. In the 1921–22 season, they missed out on promotion by goal difference. During the 1930s and 1940s years, the club found themselves sliding between the Second and Third Division. In 1949, the club signed Danny Blanchflower from Glentoran, and he impressed at Oakwell that two years later he was signed by First Division side Aston Villa, later signing for Tottenham Hotspur and being voted FWA Player of the Year twice, as well as being the captain of the 20th century&#x27;s first league and cup double winning team in 1960–61. Around the time of Blanchflower&#x27;s departure, a young centre-forward called Tommy Taylor broke into the Barnsley team, scoring 26 goals in 44 games. In April 1953, he became one of the most expensive players in English football at the time when Sir Matt Busby signed him for Manchester United for a fee of £29,999. Taylor went on to be a prolific goalscorer at the highest level over the next five years, winning two league titles and scoring 16 goals in 19 appearances for the England national football team, before losing his life in the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958.

When the Northern and Southern sections of the Third Division were replaced by national Third and Fourth Divisions for the 1958–59 season, Barnsley were still in the Second Division, but went down to the Third Division at the end of the season. In 1965, Barnsley were relegated to the Football League Fourth Division for the first time, winning promotion three years later. They went down to the Fourth Division again in 1972, and this time stayed down for seven seasons, finally returning to the Third Division in 1979. Two years later, they went up again and quickly established themselves as a decent Second Division side throughout the 1980s, although they still failed to clinch that elusive First Division place, despite the introduction of the play-offs in the second half of the decade, which gave teams finishing as low as fifth and eventually sixth the chance of winning promotion.

=== Division One and the Premier League ===

For the 1994–95 season, Barnsley turned to midfielder Danny Wilson to manage the club. His first season brought a sixth-place finish in the First Division, which would normally have meant a play-off place, but a restructuring of the league meant that they missed out. They finished 10th a year later before finally emerging as serious promotion contenders in the 1996–97 season, finally clinching runners-up spot and automatic promotion and gaining the top flight place that they had spent 99 years trying to win. Barnsley lasted just one season in the Premier League but they did reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, defeating Manchester United in the fifth round. They also made their record signing that season with Georgi Hristov for £2 million. Wilson then departed to take over at Sheffield Wednesday, being succeeded as Barnsley manager by striker John Hendrie, who had been a key player in the promotion-winning team. Barnsley were the only team from outside the Premier League to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in the 1998–99 season, but only finished 13th in the league. Hendrie was then replaced as manager by Dave Bassett, who rejuvenated the team and took them to fourth place in 1999–2000. The team lost in the play-off final to Ipswich Town, the last play-off final at Wembley before the stadium was closed for redevelopment.

=== Mixed fortunes in the 21st century ===
The team were relegated to the Second Division in 2002; administration threatened the existence of the club as Barnsley suffered greatly due to the ITV Digital crisis. A late purchase by Barnsley&#x27;s then mayor, Peter Doyle, saved the club from folding. In 2006, the side won in the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, where they beat Swansea City 4–3 on penalties to earn promotion to the Championship. The manager at this time was Andy Ritchie, who was in his first season in charge after replacing Paul Hart. The team struggled in their first season back in the Championship. In November 2006, with Barnsley in the relegation zone, Ritchie was sacked in favour of Simon Davey, who managed to steer the team away from relegation in the second half of the season, and they eventually finished 20th. The following season, Barnsley reached the semi-final of the FA Cup, beating Premier League side Liverpool 2–1 at Anfield and defending champions Chelsea 1–0; the team lost 1–0 against fellow Championship side Cardiff City at Wembley in the semi-final. In October 2008, the club fielded the youngest player in the Football League&#x27;s history when Reuben Noble-Lazarus came on against Ipswich Town aged 15 years and 45 days.

Barnsley ended the 2011–12 season as one of only two football clubs to turn a profit in the Championship; they stayed up only because Portsmouth were given a 10-point deduction for going into administration. In 2016, Barnsley won the Football League Trophy after a 3–2 win against Oxford United. They gained promotion to the Championship following a 3–1 win over Millwall in the play-off final later that season. In September 2016, Barnsley were caught up in an ongoing scandal in English football, with assistant manager Tommy Wright alleged to have accepted &quot;bungs&quot; in exchange for working as an ambassador for a third-party player ownership consortium. Wright was initially suspended before being sacked by Barnsley.

===New ownership===
In December 2017, Patrick Cryne and his family sold an 80% stake in the club to NewCity Capital&#x27;s Chien Lee and Pacific Media Group&#x27;s Paul Conway; they were joined by Indian investor Neerav Parekh and executive vice president of baseball operations and minority owner of the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball, Billy Beane (famous from the Moneyball film), as part of the international investor consortium. Barnsley were relegated to the third tier in 2017–18; afterwards. the new owners used a data approach to identify talents, focusing on young players and team rebuilding. The club appointed Daniel Stendel as head coach, who played high pressing football; Barnsley were promoted back to the Championship the following season. In the 2019–20 season, under new coach Gerhard Struber, Barnsley avoided relegation from the Championship. In 2020–21, under the management of Valérien Ismaël, Barnsley finished in fifth place and made it to the EFL Championship Play-offs for the first time in 24 years, with the youngest squad and one of the smallest budgets in the league. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called Barnsley a &quot; experiment&quot;.

Prior to the 2021–22 season, Markus Schopp was revealed as the new head coach. In November 2021, Schopp was sacked after a run of seven straight defeats. Three weeks later Poya Asbaghi was appointed as the new head coach. Fortunes improved little as Barnsley were relegated from the 2021–22 EFL Championship following a 2–1 defeat against Huddersfield Town. Asbaghi left the club by mutual consent shortly afterwards. On 15 June 2022, Michael Duff was appointed head coach of Barnsley on a three-year deal.

In May 2022, it was revealed that Pacific Media Group did not actually own all the shares they claimed to own, and were simply a nominee for a group of 4 investors who owned 20% of the club. Following this revelation, Neerav Parekh purchased the shares of 2 of the investors, while Matt Edmonds purchased the shares of the 4th investor. Following the purchases and further equity raises, the new ownership of the club is now understood to be split between Neerav Parekh (61.14%), the Cryne family (21.30%), Julie Anne Quay and Matt Edmonds (11%), Chien Lee (4.60%),and Conway&#x27;s company Pacific Media Group (1.96%). With this reconstituted shareholding and a loss of majority control, Paul Conway, Chien Lee, Grace Hung and Dickson Lee were voted off the board of Barnsley Football Club, and were replaced by Jean Cryne and Julie Anne Quay in May 2022. In July 2023, the EFL charged Barnsley with 5 breaches of the EFL Regulations related to the ownership of the club under Conway and Lee&#x27;s tenure, whilst also charging Conway and Lee individually with causing these breaches in regulations.

== Stadium ==
The stadium&#x27;s name, Oakwell, originates from the well and oak tree that were on the site when first built. Oakwell is a multi-purpose sports development in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, used primarily by the club for playing its home fixtures, and its reserves. While the name &#x27;Oakwell&#x27; generally refers to the main stadium, it also includes several neighbouring venues which form the facilities of the Barnsley academy – an indoor training pitch, a smaller stadium with seating on the south and west sides for around 2,200 spectators, and several training pitches used by the different Barnsley squads. Until 2003, the stadium and the vast amount of land that surrounds it was owned by Barnsley themselves; however, after falling into administration in 2002 the council purchased the main Oakwell Stadium to allow the club to pay its creditors and remain participants in the Football League. The stadium&#x27;s capacity is 23,287.

== Rivalries ==
According to a survey, &#x27;The League of Love and Hate&#x27; conducted in August 2019, Barnsley supporters named fellow Yorkshire clubs Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United and Leeds United as their biggest rivals, with Huddersfield Town and Rotherham United following.

== Colours and strip ==
=== Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors ===
=== Strip ===

==== Home strip ====

Barnsley have played their home games in red shirts for most of their history. The only exception to this is the period 1887–1901, where it is speculated that the team first wore blue shirts with claret arms, then circa 1890 the team wore chocolate and white stripes, before moving on to blue and white stripes around 1898. The team first wore red shirts in 1901. Since this time, the team have worn red shirts often with a white trim, although in more recent times a black trim has sometimes been used. As with most football clubs the shirt design varies from season to season. One particular design that stands out is the 1989–90 season shirt which featured white stars on a red background and has been named as one of the worst shirts ever. Manufacturers logos were added to the shirt in 1976–77, while sponsors were first added in the 1980–81 season.

==== Away strip ====

The club&#x27;s away strip (used for away or cup fixtures where there is a clash of colours) differs from season to season but usually follows the design of the season&#x27;s home strip with a variation on the colours. The most common colour for the away shirt has been white but many others have been used, including blue, yellow, black, ecru, dark green and even black and blue stripes. One notable away strip was the 2001–02 &quot;It&#x27;s just like watching Brazil&quot; kit, where the team wore the colours of the five-time World Cup winners Brazil for their away games.

<text>SkyTeam is one of the world&#x27;s three major airline alliances. Founded in June 2000, SkyTeam was the last of the three alliances to be formed, after Star Alliance and Oneworld. Its annual passenger count is 624 million customers (2024), the second largest of the three major alliances. , SkyTeam consists of 18 active carriers; it also operates a cargo alliance named SkyTeam Cargo, which partners with ten carriers, all SkyTeam members. Its centralised management team, SkyTeam Central, is based in Amstelveen, Netherlands.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
On 22 June 2000, representatives of Delta Air Lines, Aeroméxico, Air France, and Korean Air held a meeting in New York to form a third airline alliance. These became the four founding carriers of SkyTeam. Upon its formation, SkyTeam would offer its customers 6,402 daily flights to 451 destinations in 98 countries. In , the alliance established a cargo alliance, &quot;SkyTeam Cargo&quot;. The group&#x27;s inaugural members were Aeromexpress, Air France Cargo, Delta Air Logistics and Korean Air Cargo. The following month, the newly established airline alliance announced its intentions to incorporate CSA Czech Airlines as the 5th member in April of the following year.

The alliance saw the joining of CSA Czech Airlines on 25 March 2001; Alitalia entered SkyTeam on 27 July the same year, with its membership scheduled to become effective 1 November that year. On 30 September 2001, the alliance received KLM&#x27;s application for membership, following the airline&#x27;s plans to create a leading airline group with Air France. In 2003, Delta&#x27;s subsidiary, Delta Express, was replaced by Song. That same year, SkyTeam also launched an improved website focused on providing passengers with more information, increased interactivity and other resources.

===2000s: First major expansion, departure of airlines and new initiatives===

On 24 May 2004, Aeroflot signed a memorandum of understanding with SkyTeam as it intended to become a full member. The event took place in the Kremlin following the airline&#x27;s application earlier in the year for membership. SkyTeam expressed that Aeroflot has not met the consortium&#x27;s standards, but that the airline&#x27;s large hub networks made it ideal for the alliance, and made up for its deficiencies.

On 28 August, China Southern Airlines, the largest carrier in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, signed a preliminary agreement in Guangzhou in its bid to become a full member. In the presence of some Chinese and airline officials, Yan Zhiqing, the chairman of China Southern Airlines, said, &quot;This agreement-signing event is an important step forward into the future for China Southern Airlines to adapt itself to the need of further reforms and opening to the international community, as it will strengthen the airline&#x27;s international cooperation and global competitiveness.&quot;

On 13 September, Continental Airlines, KLM and Northwest Airlines joined the alliance. Their simultaneous entry was the largest expansion event in airline alliance history. As a result of the three new members, SkyTeam surpassed Oneworld to become the second largest airline alliance, serving more than 341 million customers with 14,320 daily flights to 658 destinations in 130 countries.

Even though member CSA Czech Airlines pledged to help Malév Hungarian Airlines become an associate member of the alliance (as opposed to a full member, an associate has no voting rights), Malév Hungarian Airlines opted to join the Oneworld airline alliance, signing a memorandum of understanding late in May. A few days later, SkyTeam announced four new associate members due to join by 2006, each one being &quot;sponsored&quot; by an existing member: Madrid-based Air Europa (sponsored by Air France), Panama-based Copa Airlines (sponsored and partly owned by Continental Airlines), Kenya Airways (sponsored and partly owned by KLM) and Romania&#x27;s TAROM (sponsored by Alitalia). Every associate adopted a frequent-flyer program of a full member: Copa Airlines already used Continental &quot;OnePass&quot;; Kenya Airways and Air Europa used Air France–KLM &quot;Flying Blue&quot;.

Following a 23-month joining process since , Aeroflot joined on 14 April 2006. It was the first Russian airline to be associated with any airline alliance. Aeroflot had increased its operational standards, passing International Air Transport Association&#x27;s (IATA) Operational Safety Audit (IOSA). Delta&#x27;s subsidiary Song continued to operate as Delta Air Lines. In June, it was announced that Portugália would become the alliance&#x27;s next associate member candidate. However, in November, rival airline and Star Alliance member TAP Air Portugal, purchased 99.81% of the airline, bringing a sudden end to its candidacy.

On 4 September 2007, Air Europa, Copa Airlines, and Kenya Airways became members of SkyTeam&#x27;s Associate program, which was launched to serve airlines in strategic regions which intended to become affiliated with the alliance. China Southern Airlines joined SkyTeam on 15 November to become the 11th full member and the first carrier from China to join the alliance.
In , following an agreement between Continental Airlines and United Airlines, the former, as well as Copa Airlines, announced their intentions to move to Star Alliance after Continental&#x27;s final flight with SkyTeam on 24 October 2009. That day, as announced, Continental Airlines and Copa Airlines simultaneously left SkyTeam. Continental Airlines joined Star Alliance three days later; at the time, it was rumored that the switch was Continental&#x27;s initial move in a United-Continental merger.

In , the alliance signed a preliminary agreement with Vietnam Airlines for the airline to become a full member in . Also in 2009, Alitalia-Linee Aeree Italiane re-launched operations as the new Alitalia, and the alliance announced initiatives towards a centralized management based in Amsterdam. The consortium also named a new managing director, Marie-Joseph Malé, outlined a timeline for the opening of its co-located facilities at London Heathrow Airport, and unveiled a new special livery.

In , Olympic Air entered into a codeshare agreement with Delta, a deal that was part of Olympic&#x27;s intention to join SkyTeam and engage in further discussions with Delta&#x27;s joint venture partner Air France–KLM. However, ties were cut in 2013 after Star Alliance member Aegean Airlines acquired Olympic Air.

===2010s: Second major expansion and tenth anniversary ===
To start 2010, Northwest Airlines&#x27; and Delta Air Lines&#x27; operating certificates were officially combined on 1 January, while on 9 March, China Southern Airlines announced its plans to join SkyTeam Cargo. With membership expected to be granted in November the same year, the airline was to be the first Chinese carrier to join a global air cargo alliance. On 16 April China Eastern Airlines announced its intention to join SkyTeam, with the official joining ceremony initially expected to occur by mid-2011. The announcement came shortly after the airline&#x27;s merger with Shanghai Airlines, a member of SkyTeam&#x27;s rival Star Alliance.

On 10 June, Vietnam Airlines became a full member following a joining ceremony held in Hanoi. The airline became the first SkyTeam carrier from Southeast Asia, where Star Alliance has a strong presence through Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways International. With an extra 20 unique destinations added to SkyTeam&#x27;s route map, Vietnam Airlines helped to strengthen the alliance&#x27;s foothold in the region.
On 22 June, the CEOs and chairmen of the 13 member airlines gathered in New York to celebrate the alliance&#x27;s 10th anniversary. During its first decade of operation, the world&#x27;s second-largest airline alliance more than tripled its membership, doubled its flights and nearly doubled its destinations. On the same day, SkyTeam announced that it had renewed its membership program, thereby upgrading Air Europa, Kenya Airways and TAROM statuses from associate to full members. During the ceremony, the Board outlined its plans to recruit members from Latin America, South America and India. Three days later, TAROM officially became the 13th SkyTeam member. As a part of the celebration, SkyTeam offered reductions of round-the-world fares and other promotions. Following the 10th anniversary, SkyTeam intended to enhance customers&#x27; travel experience and deepen cooperation among its members to supplement the expansion into regions that are yet to have SkyTeam members.


During the year, Delta Air Lines offered  billion to Japan Airlines after the Asian airline filed for bankruptcy due to  billion debt, at the same time lobbying Oneworld&#x27;s largest member in Asia to switch to SkyTeam. Delta, along with American Airlines, wanted Japan Airlines to be in their respective alliances to benefit from the U.S.–Japan Open Skies agreement. Eventually, Japan Airlines opted to remain at Oneworld, citing that the transfer to SkyTeam would confuse its passengers and may not gain antitrust immunity from U.S. regulators.

SkyTeam received its second application for full membership within five months. China Airlines, Taiwan&#x27;s flag carrier and largest airline, announced in mid- that it had formally started the joining process. Upon joining, the airline&#x27;s route network supplemented those of China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines, allowing cooperation among the three airlines. The following month, Aerolíneas Argentinas signed an agreement to officially start the process of becoming the first South American SkyTeam member. The airline was set to join in 2012.

On 1 November, Shanghai Airlines exited from Star Alliance to join SkyTeam in the future under its parent company, future SkyTeam member China Eastern Airlines. This bolstered SkyTeam&#x27;s presence in the People&#x27;s Republic of China and surrounding areas, making SkyTeam the number one alliance in the region. Garuda Indonesia formally started its joining process on 23 November and was scheduled to be integrated by 2012. Upon joining, the airline became the second Southeast Asian airline to join SkyTeam, therefore challenging Star Alliance&#x27;s dominance in the region through Thai Airways International and Singapore Airlines.
On 10 January 2011, Saudi Arabian Airlines signed an agreement to join SkyTeam in 2012. On 28 February the same year, Middle East Airlines agreed to join the alliance. Member airlines Delta and Air France–KLM appointed Goldman Sachs in late to advise them on a potential bid for Sir Richard Branson&#x27;s 51% stake in Virgin Atlantic, which could lead to the airline joining SkyTeam and would sharply increase the alliance&#x27;s footprint in London. Rivals Star Alliance and Etihad Airways were also investigating competing options about Virgin Atlantic. China Eastern Airlines joined the alliance on 21 June 2011, along with its subsidiary, Shanghai Airlines, to become the 14th member. Later in 2011, on 28 September, China Airlines joined the alliance. In the same year, Xiamen Airlines committed to be incorporated as a full member by the end of 2012, with their entry supported by China Southern Airlines.
On 29 May 2012, Saudi Arabian Airlines became both the first carrier to join the alliance in 2012 and the first one based in the Middle East, which brought the total members to 16. The same day of its incorporation, Saudi Arabian Airlines was renamed to Saudia. Middle East Airlines became the 17th member of the alliance a month later, following its incorporation on 28 June 2012. On 29 August 2012, Aerolíneas Argentinas became the first South American and the second Latin American airline in joining the alliance, bringing the number of members to 18. Following its incorporation on 21 November 2012, Xiamen Airlines became the fourth member in Mainland China, with the overall number of members in the alliance rising to 19. In late , the Russian newspaper &quot;Kommersant&quot; published an article that mentions that Aeroflot was considering leaving the alliance over disagreements with Delta on the pricing on some routes to North America. The report also mentioned that the Russian carrier was considering joining Star Alliance. To assess the benefits of the SkyTeam membership, a study was carried out in ; following it, the Aeroflot board reaffirmed its position within the alliance in .

Garuda Indonesia became the 20th member of the alliance on 5 March 2014. Garuda initially expected to gain SkyTeam membership in 2012, but the joining process took months to be completed.

On 31 December 2018, China Southern Airlines left the alliance.

On 4 November 2019, the International Airlines Group (IAG) announced it had agreed terms to purchase Air Europa and that the airline would leave SkyTeam if the deal succeeded. The COVID-19 pandemic and antitrust concerns delayed the sale. Negotiations resumed in March 2022 when IAG agreed to grant Air Europa a €100 million loan convertible into a 20% stake. In February 2023, negotiations were completed and IAG agreed to buy the remaining 80% stake in Air Europa (which it plans to keep as a separate brand but have managed by Iberia) for €400 million, subject to European regulatory approval. In August 2024, IAG abandon the deal after deeming additional remedies to address EU antitrust conditions too onerous to make the deal viable.

===2020s: Third major expansion, COVID-19 pandemic and 25th anniversary===
On 15 October 2021, Alitalia ceased operations, departing the alliance. Its successor, ITA Airways, joined SkyTeam on 29 October 2021. In 2023, Lufthansa, after confirming its initial acquisition of 41% of ITA Airways, said its plans included gaining total ownership of ITA&#x27;s shares by 2028 and having the airline leave SkyTeam and join Star Alliance. The European Commission approved Lufthansa Group&#x27;s purchase of a 41% stake in ITA Airways in July 2024. ITA would leave SkyTeam and join Star Alliance in 2026 or 2027.

In February 2022, both Delta and KLM announced plans to suspend their codesharing agreements with Aeroflot in connection with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Subsequently, on 27 April, SkyTeam announced that through an agreement with Aeroflot, the carrier&#x27;s membership was suspended. 

On 2 March 2023, Virgin Atlantic joined the alliance, making it the 19th member and the first UK airline of the alliance.

On October 2023, as a part of the restructuring of Scandinavian Airlines&#x27; parent company SAS Group, Air France-KLM, along with the Government of Denmark and two financial firms announced plans to invest in Scandinavian Airlines. In March 2024, US Bankruptcy Court approved the investment along with Stockholm District Court in 12 June 2024 and European Commission on 28 June 2024. As a result of the approval for the investment, Scandinavian Airlines left Star Alliance on 31 August 2024 and joined SkyTeam in 1 September 2024. 

On 26 October 2024, Czech Airlines left SkyTeam and ceased operations following changes in operating model. The last flight arrived from Paris the following evening.

On February 3, ITA Airways announced that it has left SkyTeam after being an alliance member for three years following the acquisition by German holding Lufthansa Group; the exiting transition period will end by 30 April 2025.

<doc id="333202" wikidata="Q1257607" url="?curid=333202" title="United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium">
<text>The United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) was a UN peacebuilding transitional administration in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia, in the eastern parts of Croatia (multicultural Danube river region). The transitional administration lasted between 1996 and 1998. The transitional administration was formally established by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1037 of January 15, 1996. The transitional administration was envisaged and invited in the November 1995 Erdut Agreement between the Croatian Government and the representatives of the local Serb community in the region. At the time of UNTAES deployment the region already hosted another traditional type UN peacekeeping mission known as the UNCRO. While the region was covered under the UNCRO&#x27;s sector east (sector led by Russian and Belgian forces), the whole UNCRO mission was brought into question by the Operation Storm escalation of hostilities.

UNTAES is only the third UN peacekeeping mission in history (after UNTEA in Western New Guinea and UNTAC in Cambodia) where the UN assumed direct and high executive powers in the territory of concern. Via UNTAES, the United Nations temporarily took the role of governance in the region by creating a UN protectorate. At the end of the UNTAES deployment an additional monitoring support mission was provided for the region under the name of the United Nations Civilian Police Support Group.

==History==

===Pre-establishment events===
After Operation Storm in mid-1995, the only remaining part of the self-proclaimed proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina was the area in eastern Croatia along the Danube river. Contrary to Krajina mainland, Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia shared a long border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (its constituent Republic of Serbia). It was also economically and socially dependent and politically much more closely aligned with authorities in Belgrade and Novi Sad than Krajina. This led the international community to believe that Croatian intervention in Eastern Slavonia case would trigger a military reaction from Yugoslavia and result in an escalation of hostilities. At the same time, the military defeat of Krajina and signing of the Washington Agreement opened the space to resolve the armed conflict in Bosnia which the US Administration wanted to use for political benefits before the 1996 United States presidential election.

In the context of successful Croatian military interventions of Bljesak and Oluja, the initial idea that the region of Eastern Slavonia could be integrated back to Croatia through peaceful means was perceived with astonishment on Croatian side and as a form of pressure from the international community. The Croatian military establishment held informal talks about preparation of a military solution for the region under the code name &quot;&quot;Skok u Dalj&quot; (&quot;Jump to Dalj&quot;&quot;). There was lack of enthusiasm and belief that peaceful process would be successful among the involved parties and other states in the region, themselves recently involved in Yugoslav Wars.

The Erdut Agreement between the Croatian Government and the representatives of the Serbs in the region was signed in November 1995, which requested that the UN form a transitional authority and a peacekeeping force. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1023 supported that, and after the UNCRO mission was terminated in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1025, UNTAES was set up to serve as a United Nations protectorate over the region in Resolution 1037. Reintegration of the region, the last part of the country outside the control of the central government and arguably geopolitically the most sensitive part of the former self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina, was the most important Croatian condition for participation in Dayton Peace Negotiations. The subsequent Dayton agreement for peace in Bosnia ended the deadliest conflicts of the Yugoslav wars.

===Transitional Administration===


The transitional administration started its operations on January 15, 1996, with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1043. It was meant to last for one year, with a provision for an extension of the mandate for up to one year at the request of either party. Administration&#x27;s main task was to monitor demilitarization and ensure peaceful reintegration of the territory into Croatia. UN Secretary General initially proposed that UNTAES should have 9,300 soldiers. By the final agreement the administration had a military and a civilian component with 5,000 soldiers, 500 UNTAES civilian police (UNCIVPOL) and 99 military observers. At its full deployment UNTAES consisted of 4849 soldiers, 99 military observers and 401 civil police members, close to the agreed number.

Before the arrival of UNTAES troops in region there were already 1,600 troops from the Belgian and Russian Armed Forces under United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia. They were joined by Jordanian and Pakistani mechanized battalions, Ukrainian helicopter gunships and other units. United States took a dominant role in implementation of reintegration process.

Strobe Talbott was one of the policy makers who raised the issue of regulation of position of Serbs in Croatia, the most important issue in Croatia–United States relations at the time, while US Ambassador Peter Galbraith organized three meetings with the population of the region in the towns of Vukovar, Beli Manastir and Ilok where he informed local Serbs that they will, regardless of fact that their leaders did not inform them of it, indeed become part of Croatia based on the Erdut Agreement. He also told them that they have the right to stay and live wherever they want in Croatia, be it Zagreb, Osijek, Donji Lapac, Knin or Glina and that ethnic Croats have the right to return to Eastern Slavonia. Madeleine Albright visited Vukovar in early 1996 to express her support to the process of reintegration where she was attacked with eggs and stones at local market. Initial headquarters was located at United Nations Protection Force headquarters in Zagreb but idea of mission personnel was to put headquarters in eastern Croatia. Croatian Government offered Osijek for that purpose but mission refused it since it wanted to locate it on the territory of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia. Therefore, the headquarters were located in Vukovar, with a liaison office in Beli Manastir, which provided UNTAES civil affairs officers with the opportunity to attend sessions of local Serb Executive Councils and assemblies which facilitated exchange of relevant information. One of the challenges the mission faced was the tense but mostly peaceful retake of Đeletovci oil fields from the control of Scorpions paramilitary. Representatives of mission urged ambassadors from Zagreb to visit the region and additionally introduced the practice of visiting of the local Serbian orthodox churches and two Catholic churches that still were in operation.

On 13 of April 1997 UNTAES facilitated the conduct of Croatian Chamber of Counties election in region and on that occasion special US mission under Nancy Ely-Raphael leadership visited Vukovar. US special mission visited Sarvaš, Erdut, Dalj, Vukovar, Borovo, Lovas, Opatovac, Ilok, Šarengrad, Bilje, Čeminac, Beli Manastir and Kneževi Vinogradi. US mission gave its thanks to Croatian authorities for enabling Serb population with missing Croatian documents to vote and to local Serbian executive committee presided by Vojislav Stanimirović for motivating local Serb population to take part in Croatian elections. Mission once more underlined that the goal of Erdut Agreement to re-establish multi-ethnic region in Croatian Podunavlje.

====Local police reform====
One of the main tasks of UNTAES was the reform of local police forces, which before the war were involved in the first inter-ethnic conflicts. UNTAES&#x27; initial problem was the need to replace the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&#x27;s symbols. Since there was resistance to that, a compromise was reached where UNTAES, with financial support of US Department of Justice, bought uniforms without any state insignia. The Croatian government initially refused to begin paying salaries to local police, but later agreed to do so since it demonstrated the return of Croatian sovereignty and responsibility for region. The second problem was the fact that Croatian government refused to pay salaries in Yugoslav dinars while the local police didn&#x27;t want to receive Croatian kuna, so in the end it was paid in Deutsche Marks. The management of transitional police forces was functioning on the basis of dualism, in which each top position in the region there were two individuals, one from Croatian and one from the Serbian community, including double commanders of police forces. Support for UNTAES was provided by the Polish Special Police Group that made first arrest of an indicated war criminal who was a former mayor of Vukovar.

====Administration&#x27;s extensions====
* in July 1996 with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1069
* in November 1996 with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1079
* in July 1997 with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1120

===Subsequent events===

The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1145 in late 1997 arranged for the United Nations Police Support Group (UNPSG) to take over UNTAES&#x27; policing tasks, effectively concluding the UNTAES mission on January 15, 1998. A support group of 180 civilian UN police officers remained to monitor the progress of the Croatian police and oversee the return of the refugees. As additional help to UNTAES mission, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe established OSCE Mission to Croatia whose tasks was to overlook of respect of human and minority rights, return of refugees, formation of public institutions and monitoring of work of civil police.

<doc id="333204" wikidata="Q1157953" url="?curid=333204" title="Dalkon Shield">
<text>The Dalkon Shield was a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) developed by the Dalkon Corporation and marketed by the A.H. Robins Company. The Dalkon Shield was found to cause severe injury to a disproportionately large percentage of women, which eventually led to numerous lawsuits, in which juries awarded millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages.

== Background ==
The Dalkon shield was developed by Hugh J. Davis, a physician, and Irwin Lerner, an electrical engineer. Davis was a physician working as a gynecologist with an interest in limiting the effects of overpopulation in the world, as part of the Zero population growth theory popular in the 1960s.

He wrote: &quot;While the upper socioeconomic tenth of the population can and does indulge in elaborate precoital rituals to control their fecundity the lowest socioeconomic tenth rejects such methods... The birth rate in the city of Baltimore in 1960 reflects this fact. There were 73 births per 1,000 white females in the highest economic class aged fifteen to forty-four, while in the lowest economic class there were 133 births. Thus, the segment of the population least able to discharge the responsibilities of parenthood was producing twice as many children per annum. The difference was nearly triple in the comparable non-white group.&quot;

He setup a family planning clinic for the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1964, with the help of the Ortho Pharmaceutical Company, with many of his public patients being poor and black Baltimoreans. By the late 1960s, they were inserting up to 70 IUDs a month, some experimental, created by Johns Hopkins and Ortho.

In 1964, he began working with Irwin Lerner, an electrical engineer, on various medical devices, and over Christmas 1967, they decided to work on an IUD together. The design they came up with had a closed center (so as to not pose a risk of strangling the intestines if it migrated to the abdomen), and increase its surface area (and perhaps effectiveness) made of EVA (which had been approved by the FDA for use in food packaging), and fins were added to make it less likely to dislodge. This, in turn, made it more difficult to remove, and necessitated a stronger string, for which they used Supramid, a multifilament string encased in a nylon sheath. Previous IUD designs had used a monofilament plastic string to reduce the chance of wicking bacteria from the non-sterile vaginal canal to the sterile uterus. To manage this risk, they tied a knot at either end of the string and ran experiments to see if inky water would wick past the knot and up the string. It did not, and no further wick testing was done by the company.

=== Testing ===
Davis used the Johns Hopkins clinic to study the effects of his Dalkon shield on 640 women over a year-long period between 1968 and 1969. He reported a pregnancy rate of 1.1%, an expulsion rate of 2.3%, a retention rate of 94%, and reduced bleeding complications. However, this was later found to have numerous flaws; in the five months after the study was concluded, pregnancy rates were at 3-5%, it didn&#x27;t have enough participants to give statistically significant results, and the average woman was enrolled for 5 months of the 12-month study; women who dropped out were not included in the results; some women were included after they had found success with the IUD, and Davis had recommended using spermicide during the most fertile days of patients cycles.

Lerner applied for a patent alone in 1968, and Lerner, Davis, and their attorney Robert Cohen formed the Dalkon Corporation.

After testing, the membrane of the shield was thinned and softened to help with extraction; copper sulfate was added to increase its radiopacity; metallic powdered copper was added to improve the plastic&#x27;s strength; and they created a smaller version for women who had not given birth.

The addition of copper sulfate caused a problem for the company, since at the time the FDA was obliged to study and approve medical drugs and not devices, and although the IUD as a whole was a medical device, the copper was ruled to be a drug. To evade oversight, Robins claimed the copper sulfate was only there to help with imaging.

The effectiveness of these changes were not studied before the device went on the market.

=== Marketing ===
In February 1970, Davis&#x27;s study on his Dalkon Shield was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. It did not mention his status as a co-inventor, or his financial interest in the device, nor was it peer-reviewed before publication. In the time between the study&#x27;s submission to the journal and its publication, several women had become pregnant, making the pregnancy rate 3-5%, and taking it from better than other IUDs and oral contraceptives on the market to worst.

The Dalkon Corporation in 1970 gained another investor, J. Earl, M.D., a medical practitioner in Defiance, Ohio. Looking for a large retailer with marketing experience to sell their product, Earl met with a representative from A.H. Robins Company and sold them ownership rights and royalties. Robins was a pharmaceutical company but had no previous experience with birth control, nor had it made a medical device, an unregulated area at the time.

The Dalkon Shield was promoted as a safer alternative compared to birth control pills, which at the time were the subject of many safety concerns. Dr. Davis himself was a participant in the 1970 Nelson hearings, which were congressional hearings led by Senator Gaylord Nelson regarding the safety of oral contraceptives. He asserted that oral contraceptives with high doses of hormones were dangerous and that the efficacy of the pill was &quot;greatly overrated&quot;.

== Release ==
In January 1971, Dalkon Shield went into the market, beginning in the United States and Puerto Rico, spearheaded by a large marketing campaign. At its peak, about 2.8 million women used the Dalkon Shield in the U.S.

=== Design flaws ===
====Bacterial wicking tail string ====
While looking for a material for the tail string, Davis and Learner discovered Supramid. Supramid was a cable-like suture material made of hundreds of fine inner nylon fibers encased by a smooth nylon outer sheath that was commonly used to repair tears in the tendons of horses. In 1971, a quality control supervisor found that the strings were able to wick water and suggested heat-sealing the ends of the string to form a barrier against wicking, but management rejected the idea as cost prohibitive. In addition to the string&#x27;s ability to wick bacteria, the string also had a propensity to deteriorate inside the body, adding additional risks and giving bacteria another avenue to enter the string. These properties allowed bacteria to pass through the cervix into the uterus, bypassing the cervical mucus, which normally acts as a barrier against infection.

Initial reports in the medical literature raised questions about whether its efficacy in preventing pregnancy and expulsion rate were as good as those claimed by the manufacturer, but failed to detect the tendency of the device to cause septic abortion and other severe infections.

====Painful and difficult insertions and removals====
Physicians reported that the Dalkon Shield was more difficult to insert and painful than other types of IUDs, with a doctor writing to A.H. Robins in 1971 that &quot;I have found the procedure to be the most traumatic manipulation ever perpetrated on womanhood, and I have inserted thousands of other varieties.&quot;

The design of the insertion stick was also flawed, with the stick protruding past the end of the IUD. Physicians reported that it was easy to accidentally perforate the uterus with this tip.

=== Infections ===
In June 1973, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a survey of 34,544 physicians with practices in gynecology or obstetrics regarding women who had been hospitalized or had died with complications related to the use of an IUD in the previous 6 months. A total of 16,994 physicians responded, yielding 3,502 unique case reports of women hospitalized in the first 6 months of 1973. Based on the survey response rate, the CDC estimated that a total of 7,900 IUD-related hospitalizations occurred during this 6-month period. Based on an estimate of 3.2 million IUD users, the CDC estimated an annual device-related hospitalization rate of 5 per 1000 IUD users. The survey also provided five reports of device-related fatalities, with four of these related to severe infections. One of the five was associated with the Dalkon Shield. Based on these data, the CDC estimated an IUD-related fatality rate of 3 per million users per year of use, which it compared favorably to the mortality risks associated with pregnancy and other forms of contraception. Importantly, the survey showed that the Dalkon Shield was associated with an increased rate of pregnancy-associated complications leading to hospitalization.

By 1974, approximately 2.5 million women had received the Dalkon intrauterine device. In June of that year, the medical director of A.H. Robins published a letter to the editor of the British Medical Journal stating that the company was aware of an &quot;apparent increase in the number of cases of septic abortions,&quot; including four fatalities, but stating that &quot;there is no evidence of a direct cause-and-effect relationship between wearing of the Dalkon Shield and the occurrence of septicemia&quot;. The letter recommended precautions, including pregnancy tests for women who missed their period and the immediate removal of the device for women who were found to be pregnant. That same month, A.H. Robins suspended sales of the device in the United States at the urging of the Food and Drug Administration, but continued to sell it overseas. In October 1974, a series of four case reports of septic pregnancies were published in the journal &quot;Obstretics and Gynecology.&quot; In 1975, the CDC published a study associating the Dalkon Shield with a higher risk of spontaneous abortion-related death compared to other IUDs.

As many as 200,000 women made claims against the A.H. Robins company, mostly related to claims associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and loss of fertility. The company eventually filed for bankruptcy. The company&#x27;s representatives argued that pelvic infections have a wide variety of causes, and that the Dalkon Shield was no more dangerous than other forms of birth control. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the women they represented would be healthy and fertile today if not for the device. Scientists from the CDC stated that both arguments have merit.

=== Company response ===
In 1971, 5 months after the IUD was released, the string was found to wick bacteria into the uterus by a quality control supervisor, and the company chose to change nothing.

In June 1974, at the urging of the US FDA, Robins removed the IUD from the US market, but it continued to be marketed and sold internationally.

In September 1980, Robins wrote a letter to physicians recommending they remove the Dalkon shield from women still wearing them.

In 1984, 10 years after it was taken off the market in the US, the company put out newspaper, magazine, and television ads warning people of the risks and offering to pay for the shield&#x27;s removal.

== Aftermath ==
=== Lawsuits and bankruptcy ===
More than 327,000 lawsuits and claims were filed against the A.H. Robins Company – the largest tort liability case since asbestos. The federal judge, Miles W. Lord, attracted public commentary for his judgments, holding the corporate heads personally accountable, saying &quot;Your company in the face of overwhelming evidence denies its guilt and continues its monstrous mischief. You have taken the bottom line as your guiding beacon and the low road as your route. This is corporate irresponsibility at its meanest.&quot;

The cost of litigation and settlements (estimated at billions of dollars) led the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 1985.

The bankruptcy was legal but controversial at the time, as its assets were still sufficient to cover the current lawsuits and it was still making a profit, but by filing bankruptcy and creating a fixed-value trust fund for claimants, they were able to limit the damages paid. As part of the bankruptcy, they set up a 2.5 billion-dollar trust fund for claimants. The share price went up following the bankruptcy, and the owners were later able to sell the A.H. Robins for a profit to American Home Products (now Wyeth) in 1989, with American Home Products receiving tax deductions up to about 1 billion dollars from the trust fund for victims and related to purchasing a company that has been in bankruptcy.

More than half of the women in the class action suit were paid less than $1000, although some may have been paid out as much as $1 million in the cases of babies born with birth defects.

===Overseas Lawsuits===
Overseas, the Dalkon shield continued to be marketed and sold for years after its withdrawal from the American market in 1974. In Australia, company memos informed their sales representatives of problems reported in the US, but this information was &#x27;not to be used in doctor discussions&#x27;. It continued to be inserted as late as 1980.

====Australia====
By 1989, over 7,000 Australians were suing the company in relation to pregnancies, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, spontaneous septic abortions, and perforated uteri.

=== Legislative changes to the FDA ===
In 1976, the Medical Device Amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act mandated the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for the first time, to require testing and approval of not just medications, but also medical devices, including IUDs.

=== Effect on IUD sales ===

Pharmaceutical companies were discouraged from investing in IUDs after the bankruptcy of Robins, deciding that they were less profitable and more controversial than oral contraceptives. There were no IUDs on the market in the USA between 1983 and 1988, and newer IUDs remained unpopular through the 1990s, likely due to memories of the Dalkon Shield amongst both physicians and the populace.

Only 1% of American women (aged 15-44) were using IUDs in 1995, but that number grew to 2.4% by 2004, and by 2017 the number had climbed to 14.0%, as a younger generation of women began embracing the newer IUDs as a safe, long-acting form of birth control.

<text>The Saab 98 was an automobile built by Saab in 1974 which never reached full production. Originally it was called X14, designed by Björn Envall as a combi coupé based on the Saab 95 and using its floorpan. The prototype was assembled by Sergio Coggiola, who had already done work on the Saab Sonett III.

Only a handful of test cars were built up to 1976 before the project was abandoned when Saab decided there was no room in the market for a car between the Saab 95 and Saab 99.

The only surviving 98, licence plate (Swedish) AYX 330, started its life as a white Saab 95 registered on 7 September 1973. It is currently painted &#x27;Siena Brown&#x27; and on display in the Saab Museum in Trollhättan.

<text>Combi coupé is a marketing term used by Saab to describe cars with a sloping coupé-like rear hatchback. The term joins the European term &quot;combi&quot; (for an estate car / station wagon) with coupé.

The design combines the functionality of a hatchback with the appearance of a fastback (as in liftback). As per a hatchback, the combi coupé incorporates a shared passenger and cargo space.
== Origin ==
The term was coined by Björn Envall and first introduced with the 1974 Saab 99. Saab also discussed making a hatchback available for the Saab 96/Saab 95 model range and Envall created the prototype Saab 98. The &quot;Combi coupé&quot; term was later applied to the Saab 900 model line-up.

Volvo also made a prototype combi coupé. Similar automobiles from other manufacturers were marketed as liftbacks.

== Modern examples ==
At the 2010 Paris Motor Show, Saab showed models that indicated that the Saab 9-3 would be available as a combi coupé. It was since then confirmed that the 9-3 would be available as a combi coupé, convertible and crossover.

<doc id="333219" wikidata="Q624580" url="?curid=333219" title="Eulerian path">
<text>In graph theory, an Eulerian trail (or Eulerian path) is a trail in a finite graph that visits every edge exactly once (allowing for revisiting vertices). Similarly, an Eulerian circuit or Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian trail that starts and ends on the same vertex. They were first discussed by Leonhard Euler while solving the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem in 1736. The problem can be stated mathematically like this:

:Given the graph in the image, is it possible to construct a path (or a cycle; i.e., a path starting and ending on the same vertex) that visits each edge exactly once?

Euler proved that a necessary condition for the existence of Eulerian circuits is that all vertices in the graph have an even degree, and stated without proof that connected graphs with all vertices of even degree have an Eulerian circuit. The first complete proof of this latter claim was published posthumously in 1873 by Carl Hierholzer. This is known as Euler&#x27;s Theorem:

:A connected graph has an Euler cycle if and only if every vertex has an even number of incident edges.

The term Eulerian graph has two common meanings in graph theory. One meaning is a graph with an Eulerian circuit, and the other is a graph with every vertex of even degree. These definitions coincide for connected graphs.

For the existence of Eulerian trails it is necessary that zero or two vertices have an odd degree; this means the Königsberg graph is &quot;not&quot; Eulerian. If there are no vertices of odd degree, all Eulerian trails are circuits. If there are exactly two vertices of odd degree, all Eulerian trails start at one of them and end at the other. A graph that has an Eulerian trail but not an Eulerian circuit is called semi-Eulerian.

==Definition==
An Eulerian trail, or Euler walk, in an undirected graph is a walk that uses each edge exactly once. If such a walk exists, the graph is called traversable or semi-eulerian.

An Eulerian cycle, also called an Eulerian circuit or Euler tour, in an undirected graph is a cycle that uses each edge exactly once. If such a cycle exists, the graph is called Eulerian or unicursal. The term &quot;Eulerian graph&quot; is also sometimes used in a weaker sense to denote a graph where every vertex has even degree. For finite connected graphs the two definitions are equivalent, while a possibly unconnected graph is Eulerian in the weaker sense if and only if each connected component has an Eulerian cycle.

For directed graphs, &quot;path&quot; has to be replaced with &quot;directed path&quot; and &quot;cycle&quot; with &quot;directed cycle&quot;.

The definition and properties of Eulerian trails, cycles and graphs are valid for multigraphs as well.

An Eulerian orientation of an undirected graph &quot;G&quot; is an assignment of a direction to each edge of &quot;G&quot; such that, at each vertex &quot;v&quot;, the indegree of &quot;v&quot; equals the outdegree of &quot;v&quot;. Such an orientation exists for any undirected graph in which every vertex has even degree, and may be found by constructing an Euler tour in each connected component of &quot;G&quot; and then orienting the edges according to the tour. Every Eulerian orientation of a connected graph is a strong orientation, an orientation that makes the resulting directed graph strongly connected.

== Properties ==
*An undirected graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component.
*An undirected graph can be decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles if and only if all of its vertices have even degree. So, a graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if it can be decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles and its nonzero-degree vertices belong to a single connected component.
*An undirected graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if exactly zero or two vertices have odd degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component.
*A directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has equal in degree and out degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single strongly connected component. Equivalently, a directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if it can be decomposed into edge-disjoint directed cycles and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single strongly connected component.
*A directed graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if at most one vertex has at most one vertex has every other vertex has equal in-degree and out-degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component of the underlying undirected graph.

== Constructing Eulerian trails and circuits ==
=== Fleury&#x27;s algorithm ===
Fleury&#x27;s algorithm is an elegant but inefficient algorithm that dates to 1883. Consider a graph known to have all edges in the same component and at most two vertices of odd degree. The algorithm starts at a vertex of odd degree, or, if the graph has none, it starts with an arbitrarily chosen vertex. At each step it chooses the next edge in the path to be one whose deletion would not disconnect the graph, unless there is no such edge, in which case it picks the remaining edge left at the current vertex. It then moves to the other endpoint of that edge and deletes the edge. At the end of the algorithm there are no edges left, and the sequence from which the edges were chosen forms an Eulerian cycle if the graph has no vertices of odd degree, or an Eulerian trail if there are exactly two vertices of odd degree.

While the &quot;graph traversal&quot; in Fleury&#x27;s algorithm is linear in the number of edges, i.e. formula_1, we also need to factor in the complexity of detecting bridges. If we are to re-run Tarjan&#x27;s linear time bridge-finding algorithm after the removal of every edge, Fleury&#x27;s algorithm will have a time complexity of formula_2. A dynamic bridge-finding algorithm of allows this to be improved to formula_3, but this is still significantly slower than alternative algorithms.

=== Hierholzer&#x27;s algorithm ===
Hierholzer&#x27;s 1873 paper provides a different method for finding Euler cycles that is more efficient than Fleury&#x27;s algorithm:
*Choose any starting vertex &quot;v&quot;, and follow a trail of edges from that vertex until returning to &quot;v&quot;. It is not possible to get stuck at any vertex other than &quot;v&quot;, because the even degree of all vertices ensures that, when the trail enters another vertex &quot;w&quot; there must be an unused edge leaving &quot;w&quot;. The tour formed in this way is a closed tour, but may not cover all the vertices and edges of the initial graph.
*As long as there exists a vertex &quot;u&quot; that belongs to the current tour but that has adjacent edges not part of the tour, start another trail from &quot;u&quot;, following unused edges until returning to &quot;u&quot;, and join the tour formed in this way to the previous tour.
*Since we assume the original graph is connected, repeating the previous step will exhaust all edges of the graph.
By using a data structure such as a doubly linked list to maintain the set of unused edges incident to each vertex, to maintain the list of vertices on the current tour that have unused edges, and to maintain the tour itself, the individual operations of the algorithm (finding unused edges exiting each vertex, finding a new starting vertex for a tour, and connecting two tours that share a vertex) may be performed in constant time each, so the overall algorithm takes linear time, formula_1.

This algorithm may also be implemented with a deque. Because it is only possible to get stuck when the deque represents a closed tour, one should rotate the deque by removing edges from the tail and adding them to the head until unstuck, and then continue until all edges are accounted for. This also takes linear time, as the number of rotations performed is never larger than formula_5 (intuitively, any &quot;bad&quot; edges are moved to the head, while fresh edges are added to the tail)
==Counting Eulerian circuits==

=== Complexity issues ===
The number of Eulerian circuits in &quot;digraphs&quot; can be calculated using the so-called BEST theorem, named after de Bruijn, van Aardenne-Ehrenfest, Smith and Tutte. The formula states that the number of Eulerian circuits in a digraph is the product of certain degree factorials and the number of rooted arborescences. The latter can be computed as a determinant, by the matrix tree theorem, giving a polynomial time algorithm.

BEST theorem is first stated in this form in a &quot;note added in proof&quot; to the Aardenne-Ehrenfest and de Bruijn paper (1951). The original proof was bijective and generalized the de Bruijn sequences. It is a variation on an earlier result by Smith and Tutte (1941).

Counting the number of Eulerian circuits on &quot;undirected&quot; graphs is much more difficult. This problem is known to be #P-complete. In a positive direction, a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, via the &quot;Kotzig transformations&quot; (introduced by Anton Kotzig in 1968) is believed to give a sharp approximation for the number of Eulerian circuits in a graph, though as yet there is no proof of this fact (even for graphs of bounded degree).

=== Special cases ===
An asymptotic formula for the number of Eulerian circuits in the complete graphs was determined by McKay and Robinson (1995):
:formula_6

A similar formula was later obtained by M.I. Isaev (2009) for complete bipartite graphs:
:formula_7

== Applications ==
Eulerian trails are used in bioinformatics to reconstruct the DNA sequence from its fragments. They are also used in CMOS circuit design to find an optimal logic gate ordering. There are some algorithms for processing trees that rely on an Euler tour of the tree (where each edge is treated as a pair of arcs). The de Bruijn sequences can be constructed as Eulerian trails of de Bruijn graphs.

==In infinite graphs==

In an infinite graph, the corresponding concept to an Eulerian trail or Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian line, a doubly-infinite trail that covers all of the edges of the graph. It is not sufficient for the existence of such a trail that the graph be connected and that all vertex degrees be even; for instance, the infinite Cayley graph shown, with all vertex degrees equal to four, has no Eulerian line. The infinite graphs that contain Eulerian lines were characterized by . For an infinite graph or multigraph to have an Eulerian line, it is necessary and sufficient that all of the following conditions be met:
* is connected.
* has countable sets of vertices and edges.
* has no vertices of (finite) odd degree.
*Removing any finite subgraph from leaves at most two infinite connected components in the remaining graph, and if has even degree at each of its vertices then removing leaves exactly one infinite connected component.

== Undirected Eulerian graphs ==
Euler stated a necessary condition for a finite graph to be Eulerian as all vertices must have even degree. Hierholzer proved this is a sufficient condition in a paper published in 1873. This leads to the following necessary and sufficient statement for what a finite graph must have to be Eulerian: An undirected connected finite graph is Eulerian if and only if every vertex of G has even degree.

The following result was proved by Veblen in 1912: An undirected connected graph is Eulerian if and only if it is the disjoint union of some cycles.Hierholzer developed a linear time algorithm for constructing an Eulerian tour in an undirected graph.

== Directed Eulerian graphs ==
It is possible to have a directed graph that has all even out-degrees but is not Eulerian. Since an Eulerian circuit leaves a vertex the same number of times as it enters that vertex, a necessary condition for an Eulerian circuit to exist is that the in-degree and out-degree are equal at each vertex. Obviously, connectivity is also necessary. König proved that these conditions are also sufficient. That is, a directed graph is Eulerian if and only if it is connected and the in-degree and out-degree are equal at each vertex.

In this theorem it doesn&#x27;t matter whether &quot;connected&quot; means &quot;weakly connected&quot; or &quot;strongly connected&quot; since they are equivalent for Eulerian graphs.

Hierholzer&#x27;s linear time algorithm for constructing an Eulerian tour is also applicable to directed graphs.

== Mixed Eulerian graphs ==

All mixed graphs that are both even and symmetric are guaranteed to be Eulerian. However, this is not a necessary condition, as it is possible to construct a non-symmetric, even graph that is Eulerian.

Ford and Fulkerson proved in 1962 in their book Flows in Networks a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to be Eulerian, viz., that every vertex must be even and satisfy the balance condition, i.e. for every subset of vertices S, the difference between the number of arcs leaving S and entering S must be less than or equal to the number of edges incident with S.

The process of checking if a mixed graph is Eulerian is harder than checking if an undirected or directed graph is Eulerian because the balanced set condition concerns every possible subset of vertices.

<text>In sociology, secularization () is a multilayered concept that generally denotes &quot;a transition from a religious to a more worldly level.&quot; There are many types of secularization and most do not lead to atheism, irreligion, nor are they automatically antithetical to religion. Secularization has different connotations such as implying differentiation of secular from religious domains, the marginalization of religion in those domains, or it may also entail the transformation of religion as a result of its recharacterization (e.g. as a private concern, or as a non-political matter or issue).

Secularism&#x27;s origins can be traced to the Bible itself and fleshed out throughout Christian history into the modern era. &quot;Secular&quot; is a part of the Christian church&#x27;s history, which even has &quot;secular clergy&quot; since the medieval period. Furthermore, secular and religious entities were not separated in the medieval period, but coexisted and interacted naturally. Significant contributions to principles used in modern secularism came from prominent theologians and Christian writers such as St. Augustine, William of Ockham, Marsilius of Padua, Martin Luther, Roger Williams, John Locke and Talleyrand.

The term &quot;secularization&quot; can also mean the lifting of monastic restrictions from a member of the clergy, and to deconsecration, removing the consecration of a religious building so that it may be used for other purposes. The first use of &quot;secular&quot; as a change from religion to the mundane is from the 16th century that referred to transforming ecclesiastical possessions for civil purposes, such as monasteries to hospitals; and by the 19th century it gained traction as a political object of secularist movements. In the 20th century, &quot;secularization&quot; had diversified into various versions in light of the diversity of experiences from different cultures and institutions. Scholars recognize that secularity is structured by Protestant models of Christianity, shares a parallel language to religion, and intensifies Protestant features such as iconoclasm, skepticism towards rituals, and emphasizes beliefs. In doing so, secularism perpetuates Christian traits under a different name. 

The secularization thesis expresses the idea that through the lens of the European enlightenment modernization, rationalization, combined with the ascent of science and technology, religious authority diminishes in all aspects of social life and governance. In recent years, the secularization thesis has been challenged due to some global studies indicating that the irreligious population of the world may be in decline as a percentage of the world population due to irreligious countries having subreplacement fertility rates and religious countries having higher birth rates in general. Christian sociologist Peter L. Berger coined the term desecularization to describe this phenomenon. In addition, secularization rates are stalling or reversing in some countries/regions such as the countries in the former Soviet Union or large cities in the Western world with significant amounts of religious immigrants. There is no particular monolithic direction or trend for secularization since even in Europe, the trends in religious history and demographical religious measures (e.g. belief, belonging, etc) are mixed and make the region an exception compared to other parts of the world. Even global studies show that many people who do not identify with a religion, still hold religious beliefs and participate in religious practices, thus complicating the situation.

==Overview==
Secularization, in the main, sociological meaning of the term, involves the historical process in which religion declines in social and cultural significance. As a result of secularization the role of religion in modern societies becomes restricted. In secularized societies faith lacks cultural authority, and religious organizations have little social power.

Secularization has many levels of meaning, both as a theory and as a political process. Karl Marx (1818–1883), Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), Max Weber (1864–1920), and Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) postulated that the modernization of society would include a decline in levels of formal religiosity. Study of this process seeks to determine the manner in which, or extent to which religious creeds, practices, and institutions are losing social significance. Some theorists argue that the secularization of modern civilization partly results from our inability to adapt the broad ethical and spiritual needs of people to the increasingly fast advance of the physical sciences.

The term &quot;secularization&quot; also has additional meanings, primarily historical and religious. Applied to church property, historically it refers to the seizure of church lands and buildings, such as Henry VIII&#x27;s 16th-century dissolution of the monasteries in England and the later acts during the 18th-century French Revolution, as well as by various anti-clerical enlightened absolutist European governments during the 18th and 19th centuries, which resulted in the expulsion and suppression of the religious communities which occupied them. The 19th-century &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; in Germany and Switzerland and similar events in many other countries also were expressions of secularization.

Still another form of secularization refers to the act of Prince-Bishops or holders of a position in a Monastic or Military Order - holding a combined religious and secular authority under the Catholic Church - who broke away and made themselves into completely secular (typically, Protestant) hereditary rulers. For example, Gotthard Kettler (1517–1587), the last Master of the Livonian Order, converted to Lutheranism, secularised (and took to himself) the lands of Semigallia and Courland which he had held on behalf of the order – which enabled him to marry and leave to his descendants the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. Perhaps the most widely known example of such secularization is that of 1525, which led to the establishment of Prussia, a state which would later become a major power in European politics.

The 1960s saw a trend toward increasing secularization in Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. This transformation accompanied major social factors: economic prosperity, youth rebelling against the rules and conventions of society, sexual revolution, women&#x27;s liberation, radical theology, and radical politics. A study found evidence that a rise in secularization generally has preceded economic growth over the past century. The multilevel, time-lagged regressions also indicate that tolerance for individual rights predicted 20th century economic growth even better than secularization. 

According to another study, the rise of automation (robotics and AI) could accelerate secularization throughout the 21st century in many world regions, even though &quot;this correlation does not prove any meaningful connection between automation and religious decline&quot;. The findings suggest that automation may reduce the instrumental value of religion, as technology provides secular alternatives for solving problems traditionally addressed by religion.

Nonetheless, cross-cultural studies indicate that people in general do not think of natural and supernatural explanations as antagonistic or dichotomous, but instead see them as coexisting and complementary. The reconciliation of natural and supernatural explanations is normal and pervasive from a psychological standpoint across cultures.

In contrast to the &quot;modernization&quot; thesis, Christian Smith and others argue that intellectual and cultural élites promote secularization to enhance their own status and influence. Smith believes that intellectuals have an inherent tendency to be hostile to their native cultures, causing them to embrace secularism.

According to Jack David Eller, secularization is compatible with religion since most versions of secularity do not lead to atheism or irreligion. Global studies show that many people who do not identify with a religion, still hold religious beliefs and participate in religious practices, thus complicating the situation.

==Background==
Secularization is sometimes credited both to the cultural shifts in society following the emergence of rationality and the development of science as a substitute for superstition—Max Weber called this process the &quot;disenchantment of the world&quot;—and to the changes made by religious institutions to compensate. At the most basic stages, this begins with a slow transition from oral traditions to a writing culture that diffuses knowledge. This first reduces the authority of clerics as the custodians of revealed knowledge. The shift of responsibility for education from the family and community to the state has had two consequences:
* &quot;Collective conscience&quot; as defined by Durkheim is diminished;
* Religion becomes a matter of individual choice rather than an observed social obligation.
A major issue in the study of secularization is the extent to which certain trends such as decreased attendance at places of worship indicate a decrease in religiosity or simply a privatization of religious belief, where religious beliefs no longer play a dominant role in public life or in other aspects of decision making.

==Definitions==
Jack David Eller (2010) outlined Peter Glasner&#x27;s 10 different institutional, normative, or cognitive versions of secularization, most of which do not lead to irreligion or atheism:
# Routinization — institutionalizing religion through integration into the society
# Differentiation — a redefined place or relation to society such as in pluralization 
# Disengagement — the detachment of certain facets of social life from religion 
# Transformation — change over time (e.g. Protestantism developed in Christianity)
# Generalization — where religion becomes less specific, more abstract, and inclusive
# Segmentation — the development of specialized religious institutions coexisting with other social institutions
# Desacralization — distancing the references of the &quot;supernatural&quot; from the material world
# Decline — the reduction in quantitative measures of religious identification and participation
# Secularization — pluralism through which society moves away from the &quot;sacred&quot; and toward the &quot;profane&quot; 
# Secularism — the only form that leads to outright rejection of religion, amounting to atheism 

C. John Sommerville (1998) outlined six uses of the term secularization in the scientific literature. The first five are more along the lines of &#x27;definitions&#x27; while the sixth is more of a &#x27;clarification of use&#x27;:
# When discussing macro social structures, secularization can refer to &quot;differentiation&quot;: a process in which the various aspects of society, economic, political, legal, and moral, become increasingly specialized and distinct from one another.
# When discussing individual institutions, secularization can denote the transformation of a religion into a secular institution. Examples would be the evolution of institutions such as Harvard University from a predominantly religious institution into a secular institution (with a divinity school now housing the religious element illustrating differentiation).
# When discussing activities, secularization refers to the transfer of activities from religious to secular institutions, such as a shift in the provision of social services from churches to the government.
# When discussing mentalities, secularization refers to the transition from &quot;ultimate&quot; concerns to &quot;proximate&quot; concerns. E.g., individuals in the West are now more likely to moderate their behavior in response to more immediately applicable consequences rather than out of concern for &quot;post-mortem&quot; consequences. This is a personal religious decline or movement toward a secular lifestyle.
# When discussing populations, secularization refers to broad patterns of societal decline in levels of religiosity as opposed to the individual-level secularization of (4) above. This understanding of secularization is also distinct from (1) above in that it refers specifically to religious decline rather than societal differentiation.
# When discussing religion, secularization can only be used unambiguously to refer to religion in a generic sense. For example, a reference to Christianity is not clear unless one specifies exactly which denominations of Christianity are being discussed.

Abdel Wahab Elmessiri (2002) outlined two meanings of the term secularization:
# Partial Secularization: which is the common meaning of the word, and expresses &quot;The separation between religion and state&quot;.
# Complete Secularization: this definition is not limited to the partial definition, but exceeds it to &quot;The separation between all (religion, moral, and human) values, and (not just the state) but also to (the human nature in its public and private sides), so that the holiness is removed from the world, and this world is transformed into a usable matter that can be employed for the sake of the strong&quot;.

==Sociological use and differentiation==
As studied by sociologists, one of the major themes of secularization is that of &quot;differentiation&quot;—i.e., the tendency for areas of life to become more distinct and specialized as a society becomes modernized. European sociology, influenced by anthropology, was interested in the process of change from the so-called primitive societies to increasingly advanced societies. In the United States, the emphasis was initially on change as an aspect of progress, but Talcott Parsons refocused on society as a system immersed in a constant process of increased differentiation, which he saw as a process in which new institutions take over the tasks necessary in a society to guarantee its survival as the original monolithic institutions break up. This is a devolution from single, less differentiated institutions to an increasingly differentiated subset of institutions.

Following Parsons, this concept of differentiation has been widely applied. As phrased by José Casanova, this &quot;core and the central thesis of the theory of secularization is the conceptualization of the process of societal modernization as a process of functional differentiation and emancipation of the secular spheres—primarily the state, the economy, and science—from the religious sphere and the concomitant differentiation and specialization of religion within its own newly found religious sphere&quot;. Casanova also describes this as the theory of &quot;privatization&quot; of religion, which he partially criticizes. While criticizing certain aspects of the traditional sociological theory of secularization, however, David Martin argues that the concept of social differentiation has been its &quot;most useful element&quot;.

==Current issues in secularization==
At present, secularization as understood in the West is being debated in the sociology of religion. In his works &quot;Legitimacy of the Modern Age&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Genesis of the Copernican World&quot; (1975), Hans Blumenberg has rejected the idea of a historical continuity – fundamental to the so-called &#x27;theorem of secularization&#x27;; the Modern age in his view represents an independent epoch opposed to Antiquity and the Middle Ages by a rehabilitation of human curiosity in reaction to theological absolutism. &quot;Blumenberg targets Löwith&#x27;s argument that progress is the secularization of Hebrew and Christian beliefs and argues to the contrary that the modern age, including its belief in progress, grew out of a new secular self-affirmation of culture against the Christian tradition.&quot; Wolfhart Pannenberg, a student of Löwith, has continued the debate against Blumenberg. Hans Blumberg&#x27;s assumption that secularization did not exactly grow out of a western-christian tradition also seems to be in line with more recent findings by Christoph Kleine and Monika Wohlrab-Sahr who have shown that similar historical developments can also be found in largely non-christian contexts such as Japan or Sri Lanka.

Charles Taylor in &quot;A Secular Age&quot; (2007) challenges what he calls &#x27;the subtraction thesis&#x27; – that science leads to religion being subtracted from more and more areas of life.

Proponents of &quot;secularization theory&quot; demonstrate widespread declines in the prevalence of religious belief throughout the West, particularly in Europe. Some scholars (e.g., Rodney Stark, Peter Berger) have argued that levels of religiosity are not declining, while other scholars (e.g., Mark Chaves, N. J. Demerath) have countered by introducing the idea of &#x27;neo-secularization&#x27;, which broadens the definition of secularization to include the decline of religious authority and its ability to influence society.

In other words, rather than using the proportion of irreligious apostates as the sole measure of secularity, &#x27;neo-secularization&#x27; argues that individuals increasingly look outside of religion for authoritative positions. &#x27;Neo-secularizationists&#x27; would argue that religion has diminishing authority on issues such as birth control, and argue that religion&#x27;s authority is declining and secularization is taking place even if religious affiliation may not be declining in the United States (a debate still taking place).

Finally, some claim that demographic forces offset the process of secularization, and may do so to such an extent that individuals can consistently drift away from religion even as society becomes more religious. This is especially the case in societies like Israel (with the ultra-Orthodox and religious Zionists) where committed religious groups have several times the birth rate of seculars. The religious fertility effect operates to a greater or lesser extent in all countries, and is amplified in the West by religious immigration. For instance, even as the white British became more secular, London, England, has become more religious in the past 25 years as religious immigrants and their descendants have increased their share of the population. Across the board, the question of secularization has generated considerable (and occasionally heated) debates in the social sciences.

==Criticism of secularization theory==
Today, criticism is directed against the assertion that religion has become less important in the modern age. Critics point to developments in South Korea, Russia and the USA. The combination of institutional religion with other interests, such as economic or political interests, leads to the strengthening of these religions in their respective societies. However, there are also factors that lead to a diminishing importance of religion. This is the main trend in Western Europe. Some scholars point to the permanent interplay between secularization and (re)sacralization in Western societies. For example, after the first democratic revolutions in the 18th and 19th centuries, religious traditions quickly regained strength. It has also been denied that secularization ever took place in the USA - a country that was co-founded by many religious sectarians who were expelled from their home countries and where witches were still being persecuted in 1692. Detlef Pollack, on the other hand, argues that the higher religiosity of Americans compared to Europeans is well compatible with the assumptions of secularization theory: among other things, it can be explained by the unusually high degree of existential insecurity and social inequality in the USA and the millions of religious immigrants from Latin America. However, liberal Americans have increasingly distanced themselves from church and religion due to the growing fusion of evangelical and conservative positions. 

Another point of criticism in the discourse on secularization is the inadequate examination of the Eurocentric nature of general terms, concepts, and definitions. For example, the religious studies scholar and intercultural theologian Michael Bergunder criticizes the fact that the terms religion and esotericism are tainted by a Eurocentric origin thinking. This inaccurate use of the terms hinders a constructive discussion about secularization in a global context. As an alternative, Bergunder argues for a historicization from the present of these general terms according to Foucault&#x27;s. In this way, hitherto unseen connections and the origins of the modern understanding of secularization from the 19th century can be revealed.

== Regional developments ==

===United States===

1870–1930. Christian Smith examined the secularization of American public life between 1870 and 1930. He noted that in 1870 a Protestant establishment thoroughly dominated American culture and its public institutions. By the turn of the 20th century, however, positivism had displaced the Baconian method (which had hitherto bolstered natural theology) and higher education had been thoroughly secularized. In the 1910s &quot;legal realism&quot; gained prominence, de-emphasizing the religious basis for law. That same decade publishing houses emerged that were independent of the Protestant establishment. During the 1920s secularization extended into popular culture and mass public education ceased to be under Protestant cultural influence. Although the general public was still highly religious during this time period, by 1930 the old Protestant establishment was in &quot;shambles&quot;.

Key to understanding the secularization, Smith argues, was the rise of an elite intellectual class skeptical of religious orthodoxies and influenced by the European Enlightenment tradition. They consciously sought to displace a Protestant establishment they saw as standing in their way.

2000–2021. Annual Gallup polls from 2008 through 2015 showed that the fraction of Americans who did not identify with any particular religion steadily rose from 14.6% in 2008 to 19.6% in 2015. At the same time, the fraction of Americans identifying as Christians sank from 80.1% to 69% in 2021. In December 2021 ~21% of Americans declared no religious identity or preference. Given that non-Christian religions stayed roughly the same (at about 5-7% from 2008 to 2021) secularization thus seems to have affected primarily Christians.

However, researchers argue that being unaffiliated does not automatically mean objectively nonreligious since most of the unaffiliated do still hold some religious and spiritual beliefs. For example, 72% of American unaffiliated or &quot;Nones&quot; believe in God or a Higher Power. The &quot;None&quot; response is more of an indicator for lacking affiliation than an active measure for irreligiosity, and a majority of the &quot;Nones&quot; can either be conventionally religious or &quot;spiritual&quot;.

===Britain===
====History====

In Britain, secularization came much later than in most of Western Europe. It began in the 1960s as part of a much larger social and cultural revolution. Until then the postwar years had seen a revival of religiosity in Britain. Sociologists and historians have engaged in vigorous debates over when it started, how fast it happened, and what caused it.

Sponsorship by royalty, aristocracy, and influential local gentry provided an important support system for organized religion. The sponsorship faded away in the 20th century, as the local élites were no longer so powerful or so financially able to subsidize their favorite activities. In coal-mining districts, local collieries typically funded local chapels, but that ended as the industry grew distressed and the unionized miners rejected élite interference in their local affairs. This allowed secularizing forces to gain strength.

====Recent developments====

Data from the annual British Social Attitudes survey and the biennial European Social Survey suggest that the proportion of Britons who identify as Christian fell from 55% (in 1983) to 43% (in 2015). While members of non-Christian religions – principally Muslims and Hindus – quadrupled, the non-religious (&quot;nones&quot;) now make up 53% of the British population. More than six in 10 &quot;nones&quot; were brought up as Christians, mainly Anglican or Catholic. Only 2% of &quot;nones&quot; were raised in religions other than Christian. People who were brought up to practice a religion, but who now identify as having no religion, so-called &quot;non-verts&quot;, had different rates of leaving the religion of their upbringing, namely 14% for Jews, 10% for Muslims and Sikhs, and 6% for Hindus. The proportions of the non-religious who convert to a faith are small: 3% now identify as Anglicans, less than 0.5% convert to Catholicism, 2% join other Christian denominations, and 2% convert to non-Christian faiths.

In 2018, Pew Research Center that large majority (89%) of those who were raised as Christians in the United Kingdom still identify as such, while the remainder mostly self-identify as religiously unaffiliated.

=== Spain ===
Spain used to be one of the most religious countries in Europe, but secularization has progressed fast during the past few decades. This was partly due to the role of the Catholic Church constituting the &quot;doctrinal basis of the most significant organizations of the anti-democratic and anti-liberal right-wing&quot; and the resulting anti-clericalism that was one of the roots of the Spanish civil war. Notably, the dictatorship of Francisco Franco&#x27;s core ideology was national Catholicism.

However, agreements linked to the constitution of 1978 separated church and state. In 2001, 82% of Spaniards identified as Catholic but only half did in 2021. Only around 20% of Spaniards go to mass regularly and only 20% of weddings are taking place in a church (2019). Similarly, divorce was legalized in 1981, as was abortion and same-sex marriage soon after.

=== Germany ===
Like other European countries, Germany has recorded a decrease in religiosity (in terms of proportion of individuals affiliated to a Church and baptisms for example) but the trends in East and West Germany are significantly different. In East Germany, the process of secularization has been significantly quicker. These differences are explained by sociologists (Jörg Stolz, Detlef Pollack and Nan Dirk de Graaf) by the State repression in the 1950s and 1960s, which challenges predictions of natural cohort replacements stated by the Voas model.

===Asia===
==== India ====

India, post-independence, has seen the emergence of an assertive secular state.

==== China ====

One traditional view of Chinese culture sees the teachings of Confucianism – influential over many centuries – as basically secular.

Chang Pao-min summarises perceived historical consequences of very early secularization in China:
The early secularization of Chinese society, which must be recognized as a sign of modernity [...] has ironically left China for centuries without a powerful and stable source of morality and law. All this simply means that the pursuit of wealth or power or simply the competition for survival can be and often has been ruthless without any sense of restraint. [...] Along with the early secularization of Chinese society which was equally early, the concomitant demise of feudalism and hereditary aristocracy, another remarkable development, transformed China earlier than any other country into a unitary system politically, with one single power centre. It also rendered Chinese society much more egalitarian than Western Europe and Japan.
In this arguably secular setting, the Chinese Communist Party régime of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (in power on the Chinese mainland from 1949) promoted deliberate secularization.

=== Arab world ===
Many countries in the Arab world show signs of increasing secularization. For instance, in Egypt, support for imposing sharia (Islamic law) fell from 84% in 2011 to 34% in 2016. Egyptians also pray less: among older Egyptians (55+) 90% prayed daily in 2011. Among the younger generation (age 18–24) that fraction was only 70% in 2011. By contrast, in 2016 these numbers had fallen to &lt;80% (55+) and &lt;40% (18–24). The other age groups were in between these values. In Lebanon and Morocco, the number of people listening to daily recitals of the Quran fell by half from 2011 to 2016. Some of these developments seem to be driven by need, e.g. by stagnating incomes which force women to contribute to household income and therefore to work. High living costs delay marriage and, as a consequence, seem to encourage pre-marital sex. However, in other countries, such as Jordan and Palestine, support for sharia and Islamist ideas seems to grow. Even in countries in which secularization is growing, there are backlashes. For instance, the president of Egypt, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, has banned hundreds of newspapers and websites who may provoke opposition.

<text>Post-captain or post captain is an obsolete alternative form of the rank of captain in the Royal Navy. The term &quot;post-captain&quot; was descriptive only; it was never used as a title in the form &quot;Post-Captain John Smith&quot;.

The term served to distinguish those who were captains by rank from:
* Officers in command of a naval vessel, who were (and still are) addressed as captain regardless of rank;
* Commanders, who received the title of captain as a courtesy, whether they currently had a command or not (e.g. the fictional Captain Jack Aubrey in &quot;Master and Commander&quot; or the fictional Captain Horatio Hornblower in &quot;Hornblower and the Hotspur&quot;). This custom is now defunct.

In the Royal Navy of the 18th and 19th centuries, an officer might be promoted from commander to captain, but not have a command. Until the officer obtained a command, he was &quot;on the beach&quot; and on half-pay. An officer &quot;took post&quot; or was &quot;made post&quot; when he was first commissioned to command a vessel. Usually this was a rated vessel – that is, a ship too important to be commanded by a, lower-ranked, commander – but was occasionally an unrated one. Once a captain was given a command, his name was &quot;posted&quot; in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;. Being &quot;made post&quot; is portrayed as the most crucial event in an officer&#x27;s career in both Forester&#x27;s Horatio Hornblower series and O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey-Maturin series. Once an officer was promoted to post-captain, further promotion was strictly by seniority If he could avoid death or disgrace, he could eventually become an admiral (even if only a yellow admiral).

A junior post-captain would usually command a frigate or a comparable ship, while more senior post-captains would command larger ships. An exception to this rule was that a very junior post-captain could be posted to command an admiral&#x27;s flagship, which was almost always a large ship of the line. The admiral would usually do this to keep his most junior captain under close observation and subject to his direct supervision. Captains commanding an admiral&#x27;s flagship were called &quot;flag captains&quot;. One example of this is the appointment of Alexander Hood to the command of HMS &quot;Barfleur&quot;, flagship of his cousin, Admiral Sir Samuel Hood.

Sometimes a high-ranking admiral would have two post-captains on his flagship. The junior would serve as the flag captain, listed in the ship&#x27;s roll as the &quot;second captain&quot;, with responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the vessel. The senior would be the captain of the fleet, listed as &quot;first captain&quot;, and serving as the admiral&#x27;s chief-of-staff.

After 1795, when they were first introduced on Royal Navy uniforms, the number and position of epaulettes distinguished between commanders and post-captains of various seniorities. A commander wore a single epaulette on the left shoulder. A post-captain with less than three years&#x27; seniority wore a single epaulette on the right shoulder and a post-captain with three or more years seniority wore an epaulette on each shoulder. In the O&#x27;Brian series, Aubrey &quot;wets the swab&quot; – that is, he celebrates his promotion to commander and the acquisition of his &quot;swab&quot; or epaulette with the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol.

<text>Falcone Borsellino Airport () or simply Palermo Airport, formerly Punta Raisi Airport, is an international airport located at Cinisi, west-northwest of Palermo, the capital city of the Italian island of Sicily. It is the second biggest airport in Sicily in terms of passengers after Catania-Fontanarossa Airport, with 7,118,087 passengers handled in 2022.

==History==
The airport was given the name &quot;Falcone Borsellino&quot; in memory of the two leading anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino who were murdered by the Sicilian Mafia in 1992. A plaque featuring their portraits can be found to the right of one of the main outside entrances to the departure hall, set into a mosaic of Sicily. Created by the Sicilian sculptor Tommaso Geraci, it bears the inscription &quot;Giovanni Falcone–Paolo Borsellino–Gli Altri–L&#x27;orgoglio della Nuova Sicilia&quot; (&quot;Giovanni Falcone–Paolo Borsellino–The Others–The Pride of the New Sicily&quot;).

In 1994, GESAP was charged with the partial management of the airport through a convention which granted the company a 20-year mandate to run land-side activities (the airport buildings and surrounding areas). In April 1999, GESAP obtained an anticipated mandate to manage the airport&#x27;s air side activities, and, more specifically, the flight infrastructure (runways, links, taxiways and aprons).

In June 2005, Eurofly launched seasonal flights from Palermo to New York City using Airbus A330s. The company merged with Meridiana in 2010 to create Meridiana Fly, which continued the service. As a result of Meridiana Fly&#x27;s decision to rebrand as Air Italy, the route ended in October 2017. Neos commenced a summer-seasonal route in June 2024 with Boeing 787 Dreamliners, reconnecting Palermo to New York–JFK. From May 2025 also United Airlines will commence a new summer-seasonal service between the two cities, connecting the Sicilian city to Newark, near New York, using Boeing 767-400s.

==Management==
GESAP S.p.a. is the airport management company of the airport. It has a fully paid-up share capital of €15,912,332 divided between the Regional Province of Palermo, the Comune of Palermo, the Chamber of Commerce, the Comune of Cinisi and other minor partners.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Palermo Airport:

==Statistics==


==Accidents and incidents==
* On 5 May 1972, Alitalia Flight 112 flew into Mt. Longa on approach to Palermo Airport. All 115 aboard were killed. 
* On 23 December 1978, Alitalia Flight 4128 crashed into the Tyrrhenian Sea while on approach to Palermo Airport. 
* On 6 August 2005, Tuninter Flight 1153, an ATR 72–500, ran out of fuel while en route and ditched about from the city of Palermo. 16 of the 39 people on board died.
* On 24 September 2010, Wind Jet Flight 243, operated by Airbus A319-132 EI-EDM, landed short of the runway after encountering a thunderstorm and windshear on approach. The aircraft was substantially damaged when it impacted the localiser. Both main undercarriage sets collapsed and the aircraft was evacuated by the emergency slides. Around 20 passengers were injured in the evacuation.

==Ground transport==
===Train===
The airport&#x27;s railway facility, Punta Raisi railway station, is the northwestern terminus of Palermo metropolitan railway service. It links the airport with Palermo Centrale railway station. A typical timetable on work days is a train every 30 minutes in each direction between early morning and around 10.00 pm.

===Bus===
There are several private bus companies, which stop at the bus station outside the terminal building and connect the airport with nearby Palermo city. There are further connections to/from Palermo, Catania, Messina and rest of Sicily.

<doc id="333234" wikidata="Q193192" url="?curid=333234" title="Northern hawk-owl">
<text>The northern hawk-owl or northern hawk owl (Surnia ulula) is a medium-sized true owl of the northern latitudes. It is non-migratory and usually stays within its breeding range, though it sometimes irrupts southward. It is one of the few owls that is neither nocturnal nor crepuscular, being active only during the day. This is the only living species in the genus &quot;Surnia&quot; of the family Strigidae, the &quot;typical&quot; owls (as opposed to barn owls, Tytonidae). The species is sometimes called simply the hawk owl; however, many species of owls in the genus &quot;Ninox&quot; are also called &quot;hawk owls&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The northern hawk-owl was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Strix ulula&quot;. The owl is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Surnia&quot; that was introduced in 1805 by André Duméril. The type species was designated by George Robert Gray in 1840 as the northern hawk-owl. The genus name is of unknown etymology and may simply have been invented by Duméril. The specific epithet &quot;ulula&quot; is Latin for a &quot;screech owl&quot;.

A molecular phylogenetic study of the owls published in 2019 found that the northern hawk-owl is sister to a clade containing the pygmy owls in the genus &quot;Glaucidium&quot;.
Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;S. u. tianschanica&quot; Smallbones, 1906 – central Asia to northern China and northern Mongolia
* &quot;S. u. ulula&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – northern Eurasia
* &quot;S. u. caparoch&quot; (Müller, PLS, 1776) – northern North America

==Description==
Male northern hawk-owls are generally long and weigh about . Females are slightly bigger with a length of and a mass of about . Both male and female have similar wingspans of about . The northern hawk-owl plumage is relatively dark brown with an off-white spotting pattern on all dorsal parts of the body with the exception of the back of the neck which boasts a black v-shaped pattern. The underbelly is generally white or off-white which continues to the toes with brown bands on the breast and stomach. It also has a long tail with brown banding. The northern hawk-owl has a smokey white face with a black border, a flat head, yellow eyes and a yellow curved beak.

The northern hawk-owl has been said to resemble a hawk in appearance and in behavior. In North America, its appearance in flight is often considered similar to a Cooper&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;). It has been suggested that this may be because the hawk-owl may partially fill an important diurnal niche similar to that of day hunters such as hawks.
===Vocalization===
Various calls are used by the different sexes in different situations. When attracting a mate the male usually lets out a rolled whistle of &quot;ulululululululul&quot; and a sound similar to &quot;tu-wita-wit, tiwita-tu-wita, wita,&quot; when perching at a potential nest site. The female&#x27;s call is usually less constant and more shrill.

When alerting to danger, the northern hawk-owl lets out a sound similar to &quot;rike, rike, rike, rike&quot;. It also releases a high-pitched scream followed by a &quot;yip&quot; when an intruder is near to the nest. To warn of impending dangers to a fledgling, the hawk-owl will let out a noise similar to &quot;ki ki kikikikiki&quot;. Calls can vary in length from 15 s to 2 min.

==Distribution and habitat==
Three subspecies exist across the northern Holarctic. The North American subspecies &quot;S. u. caparoch&quot; spans from eastern Alaska through Canada to Newfoundland and in some areas extends south into northern United States. The other two subspecies are found in northeastern Europe and Siberia: &quot;S. u. tianschanica&quot; breeds in Central Asia reaching Xinjiang (China); and &quot;S. u. ulula&quot; resides across Siberia reaching its most eastern range.

Occasionally, &quot;S. u. caparoch&quot; can extend its territory as far south as northern Minnesota and many other states in the northern United States including more central states such as West Virginia, New York, and South Dakota. These southern forays into the northern United States are rare and generally occur during winter, or following an explosion in a population of prey. &quot;S. u. ulula&quot; can occasionally be found in more southern areas such as Great Britain, southern Russia and Scandinavia, following explosions of prey.

Northern hawk-owls are unevenly distributed and highly variable throughout the boreal forest. They live mostly in open coniferous forests, or coniferous forests mixed with deciduous species such as larch, birch, poplar, and willow. They are found in muskegs, clearings, swamp valleys, meadows, or recently burnt areas, and generally avoid dense spruce-fir forests. Their winter habitat is usually the same as the breeding habitat.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===

The northern hawk-owl generally starts its mating rituals at the beginning of March. After calling and pairing is complete the northern hawk-owl will build a nest and start to lay eggs. On average the northern hawk-owl will lay 3–11 eggs per brood. The nest sites are usually the tops of hollow stumps of old dead spruce trees. These nesting sites are usually above ground for the North American &quot;S. u. caparoch&quot; and approximately above ground for the Eurasian &quot;S. u. ulala&quot;. The specific dates of egg appearance can be quite variable depending on locality. In central Canada eggs are usually laid from 30 March to 5 June. On Newfoundland the appearance of eggs occurs later, between 9 May and 11 June. In Finland, however, eggs can be found anywhere between 30 March to 23 June.

For the most part, the female northern hawk-owl does the incubating of the eggs, whilst the male forages for food. Once the chicks have hatched their roles shift drastically. At about two weeks into the chicks&#x27; lives, the female starts to leave the nest for long spans of time (5 hours or more). This span of time is presumably when the female hunts. The male, however, will guard the nest diligently until the chicks leave. When predators (usually other raptors) fly nearby, the male will sometimes chase them away from the nest if he feels it is necessary. Once the owlets have grown to a size which allows less parental supervision, they will leave the nest. This occurs on average after their 21st day, and can begin as early as mid-June. After this the female will provide most of the care. However, the male will remain close and will still feed his young on occasion.
The northern hawk-owl has also been known to nest on cliffsides. It has little fear of humans, and will attack if the young are approached too closely.

==Food and feeding==
The northern hawk-owl feeds on a variety of prey, which can include small rodents to mammals more robust in size, and a variety of birds — a typical diet for many boreal owls. In Eurasia the northern hawk-owl is known to feed primarily on voles from the Microtus family. These voles usually follow a 3–4 year cycle of abundance. Therefore, &quot;S. u. ulula&quot; numbers are affected negatively when the numbers of voles are lowest. In North America the subspecies &quot;S. u. caparoch&quot; also feeds upon microtine voles, but its population is primarily based on the ten-year cycling of the snowshoe hare (&quot;Lepus americanus&quot;). In Eurasia the northern hawk-owl&#x27;s biomass consists of about 94% microtine voles, whereas in North America the percentage of biomass contributed by voles can be as low as 20%. Juvenile hares are considerably more important at 40–50%.
Other animals that are important prey items for the northern hawk-owl include the red squirrel (&quot;Sciurus vulgaris&quot;) which has been documented to contribute as much as 20% to the hawk-owl&#x27;s biomass. A long list of others includes mice, rats, voles, lemmings, cottontails, shrews, moles, the short-tail weasel (&quot;Mustela erminea&quot;), partridge, spruce grouse (&quot;Falcipennis canadensis&quot;), doves, pileated woodpeckers (&quot;Dryocopus pileatus&quot;), sparrows, jays, robins, starlings, buntings, grackles, and finches. Frogs and even fish are sometimes taken. In the winter, feeding strategies change: where in summer the main source of food is mammals, in the winter a bigger portion of the hawk-owl&#x27;s biomass consists of ground-dwelling birds, such as the ptarmigan and the grouse.

The northern hawk-owl is a partially diurnal hunter, although it has been recorded hunting at varying times and does not appear to have a preferred hunting time. Whether the bird resides in Eurasia or North America, the strategy is usually similar. The northern hawk-owl will perch and scour the immediate area for prey. As these owls are considered a search-oriented species, they likely do not stay put for long if the site is not producing prey. The hawk-owl prefers open, forest-type environments when perching. These environments include sphagnum bogs and partially deforested areas. The preferred perching tree of the northern hawk-owl is the spruce tree. When the hawk-owl attacks, it goes from a horizontal posture into a gliding dive. If the prey is further away, the bird will flap its wings a few times during the dive to increase distance. The hawk-owl has exceptional hearing and can plunge into snow to capture rodents below the surface.

The type of prey the hawk-owl catches will determine its eating strategy. For mammalian prey the ritual is generally the same: the northern hawk-owl will eviscerate its prey, eat the head first (especially for prey like the red squirrel, whose head is fairly large), and then — when tackling larger prey — it will eat the organs and cache the remains; with smaller prey, the owl will simply swallow the body whole.

==Conservation and status==
Due to its low density occurrence, sporadic fluctuations, and remote breeding locations, the northern hawk-owl is one of the least studied and poorly understood birds in North America. As a result, it is almost impossible to properly estimate its numbers.

In Yukon, northern hawk-owl densities were estimated to be between zero and six pairs per . Despite these low densities, the North American population is thought to be fairly large given that they occur throughout the boreal forest. Duncan and Harris (1997) estimated that this population contains between 10,000 and 50,000 pairs.

Populations are known to fluctuate with cycles of small rodents and irruptions are known to occur in sub-boreal regions throughout the world. In Scandinavia, populations have been reported to vary from a few hundred birds in certain years to over 4000 birds in others and even up to 10,000 breeding pairs in optimal years. Irruptions can be used as indicators of small mammal abundance and in eastern North America, southern irruptions have been linked with low densities of red-backed voles in the high boreal forest.

In North America, over 50% of the northern hawk-owls&#x27; breeding territory occurs in non-commercial boreal forests and as long as nothing threatens their northern habitats, no known factors challenge their existence. However, it is unknown what effects modern forestry would have on population levels because although it would decrease nesting localities, it would simultaneously create ideal habitat for Microtus prey. Fire suppression by humans is believed to negatively affect northern hawk-owl populations by reducing open areas for hunting and dead wood to nest in.

The status and conservation of this species is uncertain. A report by the Committee On the Status of Endangered Wildlife In Canada (COSEWIC) recommended that no designation be assigned for the northern hawk-owl. Compared to the nineteenth century, southern irruptions in the New and Old World appear to have declined. Also, North American populations seem to be declining, although no proper documentation exists to confirm this trend. In Canada, it was ranked 85th overall to set conservation, research, or monitoring priorities. Downes et al. (2000) considered the hawk-owl to be of medium concern, but with a high priority to improve monitoring.

==In falconry==
The northern hawk-owl is considered a falconry bird in Ontario, and may be used to hunt small game with a proper license.

<text>The Stanley Brothers were an American bluegrass duo of singer-songwriters and musicians, made up of brothers Carter Stanley (August 27, 1925 – December 1, 1966) and Ralph Stanley (February 25, 1927 – June 23, 2016). Ralph and Carter performed as The Stanley Brothers with their band, The Clinch Mountain Boys, from 1946 to 1966. Ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo artist after Carter&#x27;s death, from 1967 until his own death in 2016. 
Thomas Goldsmith: This article continues to state that “many years later,” Ralph started playing again after Carter’s death. This is not just wrong, but absurdly wrong. As seen in many accounts of Ralph’s career, he essentially never stopped performing after Carter’s death. He played some remaining Stanley Brothers dates, then moved forward with the Clinch Mountain Boys, performing until not long before his own death.

==Early lives==
Carter and Ralph Stanley were born on a small farm in Dickenson County, Virginia. Music was a part of their lives even in their early years, and they listened to the Monroe Brothers, J. E. Mainer&#x27;s Mountaineers and the Grand Ole Opry on local radio.

==Careers==
The brothers formed a band, the Lazy Ramblers, and performed as a duo on WJHL radio in Johnson City, Tennessee. World War II interrupted their musical career, but once both brothers returned from the United States Army, they resumed their musical pursuits. They formed their band, the Stanley Brothers and the Clinch Mountain Boys, in the month of November 1946 as the first band to copy the Monroe sound. Carter played guitar and sang lead, while Ralph played banjo and sang with a strong, high tenor voice. Additional members of this early band were Darrell &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Lambert on mandolin and Bobby Sumner on fiddle. Sumner soon was replaced by Leslie Keith.

On December 26, 1946, the band began performing at radio station WCYB in Bristol, Tennessee as stalwarts of the famed &quot;Farm and Fun Time&quot; radio show. They made their recording debut in September 1947 for Rich-R-Tone Records which had been founded the year before. Their records sold well, &quot;outselling even Eddy Arnold&quot; regionally. Up to now, Ralph had been playing his banjo with two fingers on recordings and in concerts, but in 1948, he switched to the three-finger style (popularised by Earl Scruggs). In March 1949, the Stanley Brothers began recording for Columbia Records. During this time, Bill Monroe was not particularly fond of groups like the Stanley Brothers and Flatt &amp; Scruggs who he believed &quot;stole&quot; his music by copying it; they were seen as &quot;economic threats.&quot;

Financially hard times in the early 1950s forced the brothers to take a short break in their musical career. They began working for the Ford Motor Company in Detroit. Eventually, Monroe and the Stanley Brothers became friends, and Carter performed for several months with Bill Monroe in the summer of 1951. In August 1951, Ralph was involved in a serious automobile accident that almost ended his career. Following his recovery, Carter and Ralph reunited to front their Clinch Mountain Boys.

As bluegrass music grew less popular in the late 1950s, the Stanley Brothers moved to Live Oak, Florida and headlined the weekly &quot;Suwannee River Jamboree&quot; radio show on WNER from 1958 to 1962. The three-hour show was also syndicated across the Southeast. In 1966, the brothers toured Europe, and upon returning home, they continued to perform together until Carter&#x27;s death in December 1966.

Many years later, Ralph revived the Clinch Mountain Boys until his death in 2016. He performed with them through 2013. He recorded one last album in 2014, &quot;Side By Side&quot;, with his son, Ralph II. Among the musicians who have played in the revived Clinch Mountain Boys were Ricky Skaggs, Keith Whitley, Larry Sparks, Curly Ray Cline, Jack Cooke, Roy Lee Centers, Charlie Sizemore, Ray Goins, and Ralph Stanley II. Ralph&#x27;s career received a big boost with his prominent role on the very successful soundtrack recording of the 2000 feature film, &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, which featured the song &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; among others.

==Legacy==
The Stanley Brothers were inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1992. In 2005, The Barter State Theatre of Virginia premiered an original stage production, &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow: The Story of the Stanley Brothers&quot;, written by Dr. Douglas Pote.

The University Press of Mississippi published the first full-length biography of the Stanley Brothers, &quot;Lonesome Melodies: The Lives and Music of the Stanley Brothers&quot; by David W. Johnson, on February 1, 2013. The paperback edition was published March 1, 2014.

<text>Ralph Edmund Stanley (February 25, 1927 – June 23, 2016) was an American bluegrass artist, known for his distinctive singing and banjo playing. He began playing music in 1946, originally with his older brother Carter Stanley as part of The Stanley Brothers, and most often as the leader of his band, The Clinch Mountain Boys. Ralph was also known as Dr. Ralph Stanley.

He was part of the first generation of bluegrass musicians and was inducted into both the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor and the Grand Ole Opry.

==Biography==

Stanley was born, grew up, and lived in rural Southwest Virginia—&quot;in a little town called McClure at a place called Big Spraddle Creek, just up the holler&quot; from where he moved in 1936. Before that he lived in another part of Dickenson County. The son of Lee and Lucy Smith Stanley, Ralph did not grow up around a lot of music in his home. As he said, his &quot;daddy didn&#x27;t play an instrument, but sometimes he would sing church music... I&#x27;d hear him sing songs like &#x27;Man of Constant Sorrow,&#x27; &#x27;Pretty Polly&#x27; and &#x27;Omie Wise.&#x27;&quot;

He learned to play the banjo, clawhammer style, from his mother:

He graduated from high school on May 2, 1945, and was inducted into the Army on May 16, serving for &quot;little more than a year.&quot; When he got home he immediately began performing:

===Clinch Mountain Boys===

After considering a course in &quot;veterinary&quot;, he decided instead to join his older guitar-playing brother Carter Stanley (1925–1966) to form the Clinch Mountain Boys in 1946. Drawing heavily on the musical traditions of the area, which included the unique singing style of the Primitive Baptist Universalist church and the sweet down-home family harmonies of the Carter Family, the two Stanley brothers began playing on local radio stations. They first performed at Norton, Virginia&#x27;s WNVA, but did not stay long there, moving on instead to Bristol, Virginia, and WCYB to start the show &quot;Farm and Fun Time&quot;, where they stayed &quot;off and on for 12 years&quot;.

At first they covered &quot;a lot of Bill Monroe music&quot; (one of the first groups to pick up the new &quot;bluegrass&quot; format). They soon &quot;found out that didn&#x27;t pay off—we needed something of our own. So we started writing songs in 1947, 1948. I guess I wrote 20 or so banjo tunes, but Carter was a better writer than me.&quot; When Columbia Records signed them as The Stanley Brothers, Monroe left in protest joining Decca Records. Later, Carter went back to sing for the &quot;Father of Bluegrass&quot;, Monroe.

Ralph Stanley gave his opinion on Bill Monroe&#x27;s apparent change of heart: &quot;He [Monroe] knew Carter would make him a good singer... Bill Monroe loved our music and loved our singing.&quot;

The Stanley Brothers joined King Records in the late 1950s, a record company which was so eclectic that it included James Brown at the time. In fact, James Brown and his band were in the studio when the Stanley Brothers recorded &quot;Finger Poppin&#x27; Time&quot;. &quot;James and his band were poppin&#x27; their fingers on that&quot; according to Ralph. At King Records, they &quot;went to a more &#x27;Stanley style&#x27;, the sound that people most know today.&quot;

Ralph and Carter performed as The Stanley Brothers with their band, The Clinch Mountain Boys, from 1946 to 1966. Ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo act after Carter&#x27;s death, from 1967 until his death in 2016.

===Solo===
After Carter died of complications of cirrhosis in 1966, after ailing for &quot;a year or so&quot;, Ralph Stanley faced a hard decision on whether to continue performing on his own. &quot;I was worried, I didn&#x27;t know if I could do it by myself. But boy, I got letters, 3,000 of &#x27;em, and phone calls... I went to Syd Nathan at King and asked him if he wanted me to go on, and he said, &#x27;Hell yes! You might be better than both of them.&#x27;&quot;

He decided to go it alone, eventually reviving The Clinch Mountain Boys. Larry Sparks, Roy Lee Centers, and Charlie Sizemore were among those with whom he played in the revived band. He encountered Ricky Skaggs and Keith Whitley arriving late to his own show, &quot;They were about 16 or 17, and they were holding the crowd &#x27;til we got there... They sounded just exactly like (the Stanley Brothers).&quot; Seeing their potential, he hired them &quot;to give &#x27;em a chance&quot;, though that meant a seven-member band. Eventually, his son, Ralph Stanley II, took over as lead singer and rhythm guitarist for The Clinch Mountain Boys. His grandson Nathan Stanley became the last lead singer and band leader for The Clinch Mountain Boys.

===Political career===
About 1970, Ralph Stanley ran for Clerk of Court and Commissioner of Revenue in Dickenson County and said:

===&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;===
Stanley&#x27;s work was featured in the very popular 2000 film &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, in which he sings the Appalachian dirge &quot;O Death&quot;. The soundtrack&#x27;s producer was T-Bone Burnett. Stanley said the following about working with Burnett:

With that song, Stanley won a 2002 Grammy Award in the category of Best Male Country Vocal Performance. &quot;That put the icing on the cake for me,&quot; he said. &quot;It put me in a different category.&quot;

===Later life===
He was known in the world of bluegrass music by the popular title, &quot;Dr. Ralph Stanley&quot;, having been awarded an honorary doctorate in music from Lincoln Memorial University of Harrogate, Tennessee in 1976. Stanley was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1992 and in 2000; he became the first person to be inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in the third millennium.

He joined producers Randall Franks and Alan Autry for the &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; cast CD &quot;Christmas Time&#x27;s A Comin&quot;&#x27;, performing &quot;Christmas Time&#x27;s A Comin&#x27;&quot; with the cast on the CD released on Sonlite and MGM/UA; it was one of the most popular Christmas releases of 1991 and 1992 with Southern retailers.

He was featured in the Josh Turner hit song &quot;Me and God&quot; released in 2006, the same year he was awarded the National Medal of Arts.
On November 10, 2007, Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys performed at a rally for presidential candidate John Edwards in Des Moines, Iowa, just before the Democratic Party&#x27;s annual Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner. Between renditions of &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;, Stanley told the crowd that he had cast his first vote for Harry S. Truman in 1948 and would cast his next for John Edwards in 2008. In October 2008, he performed in a radio advertisement for Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign.

Country singer Dwight Yoakam said that Stanley is one of his &quot;musical heroes&quot;.

In 2012, Stanley was featured on several tracks of the soundtrack for Nick Cave&#x27;s film &quot;Lawless&quot;, with music by Cave and Warren Ellis. His solo track &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; is prominent in several scenes of the movie.

Stanley maintained an active touring schedule; appearances in his later years included the 2012 Muddy Roots Music Festival in Cookeville, Tennessee and the 2013 FreshGrass Festival in North Adams, Massachusetts. In June 2013, he announced a farewell tour, scheduled to begin in Rocky Mount, North Carolina on October 18 and extending to December 2014. However, upon notification of being elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (awarded on October 11, 2014) a statement on his own website appeared saying that he would not be retiring.

===Personal life and death===
After two previous marriages ended in divorce, Stanley married his wife, Jimmie, in 1968; he had four children.

Stanley&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; which was coauthored with the music journalist Eddie Dean, was released by Gotham Books on October 15, 2009. On June 23, 2016, Stanley died from skin cancer at his home in Sandy Ridge in Dickenson County, Virginia; he was 89.

==Musical style==

Stanley created a unique style of banjo playing, sometimes called &quot;Stanley style&quot;. It evolved from the Wade Mainer style two-finger technique and was later influenced by the Scruggs style, which is a three-finger technique. &quot;Stanley style&quot; is distinguished by incredibly fast &quot;forward rolls&quot;, led by the index finger (instead of the thumb, as in Scruggs style), sometimes in the higher registers using a capo. In &quot;Stanley style&quot;, the rolls of the banjo are continuous, while being picked fairly close to the bridge on the banjo, giving the tone of the instrument a very crisp, articulate snap to the strings as the player plays them.

<text>New Right is a term for various right-wing political groups or policies in different countries during different periods. One prominent usage was to describe the emergence of certain Eastern European parties after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the United States, the Second New Right campaigned against abortion, LGBT civil rights, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), the Panama Canal Treaty, affirmative action, and most forms of taxation.

== History ==
&quot;New Right&quot; appeared during the 1964 presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater to designate the emergence, in response to American style liberalism (i.e., social liberalism), of a more combative, anti-egalitarian, and uninhibited right. Popularized by Richard Viguerie, the term became later used to describe a broader global movement: those proponents of the night-watchman state but who also tended to be socially conservative, such as Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Turgut Özal or Augusto Pinochet. However, as Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg point out, this leaning had only a few aspects in common with the &quot;European New Right&quot; that had been emerging since the 1960s, more inspired by the conservative revolutionary Moeller van den Bruck than by the classical liberal Adam Smith. Anarcho-capitalism, a form of libertarianism that advocates for the replacement of all state institutions with private institutions, is usually seen as part of the New Right.

==New Right by country==
===Australia===
In Australia, &quot;the New Right&quot; refers to a late 1970s/1980s onward movement both within and outside of the Liberal/National Coalition which advocates economically liberal and increased socially conservative policies (as opposed to the &quot;old right&quot; which advocated economically conservative policies and &quot;small-l liberals&quot; with more socially liberal views). Unlike the United Kingdom and United States, but like neighbouring New Zealand, the 1980s saw the Australian Labor Party initiate Third Way economic reforms, which bear some familiarity to New Right ideology. After the John Howard Coalition ended the 13-year rule of the Hawke-Keating Labor government at the 1996 federal election, economic reforms were taken further, some examples being wholesale labor market deregulation (e.g., WorkChoices), the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), the privatisation of the telecommunications monopoly Telstra, and sweeping welfare reform including &quot;work for the dole&quot;. The H. R. Nicholls Society, a think tank which advocates full workplace deregulation, contains some Liberal MPs as members and is seen to be of the New Right.

Economic liberalism is also called economic rationalism in Australia. The term &quot;economic rationalism&quot; was first used by Labor&#x27;s Gough Whitlam. to describe a market-oriented form of social democracy, but its meaning subsequently evolved. It is a philosophy which tends to advocate a free market economy, increased deregulation, privatisation, lower direct taxation and higher indirect taxation, and a reduction of the size of the welfare state. The politicians favouring New Right ideology were referred to as &quot;dries&quot;, while those advocating continuation of the economic policies of the post-war consensus, typically Keynesian economics, or were more socially liberal, were called &quot;wets&quot; (the term &quot;wets&quot; was similarly used in Britain to refer to those Conservatives who opposed Thatcherite economic policies, but &quot;dries&quot; in this context was much rarer in British usage).

===Brazil===
The New Right in Brazil has grown sharply in recent years within population, intelligentsia, and academia. That is mainly due to a generalized discontent with the left-wing government and its policies.

This new movement distinguishes itself from what is known in Brazil as &quot;old right&quot;, which was ideologically associated to the Brazilian military government, União Democrática Nacional (National Democratic Union), and Integralism. It is identified by positive views regarding democracy, personal freedom, free-market capitalism, reduction of bureaucracy, privatization of state-run companies, tax cuts, parliamentary, political reform. It rejects &quot;cultural Marxism&quot;, modern socialism and populism.

There have been two major phenomena relating to the rise of the new Brazilian right: the Free Brazil Movement, which has managed to bring together millions of people on demonstrations against the government in March 2015; and the creation of the New Party (Partido Novo) and Libertários, the first liberal party since the First Brazilian Republic.

Some Brazilian new-right thinkers are: Kim Kataguiri, and his movement Movimento Brasil Livre (Free Brazil Moviment), Roberto Campos, Wilson Martins, Olavo de Carvalho, Luiz Felipe Pondé, Paulo Francis, José Guilherme Merquior, Bruno Tolentino, and Miguel Reale.

As a result of this movement, in the 2018 Brazilian election, Jair Messias Bolsonaro was elected President of Brazil with 55% of the votes; his Minister of the Economy, Paulo Guedes, graduated from the University of Chicago, famous for its economically liberal school of economics.

===Chile===
The term &quot;New Right&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Nueva derecha&quot;) has come into mainstream political discourse since the election of Sebastián Piñera in 2010, when interior minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter used it to describe his government. Hinzpeter&#x27;s introduction of the term caused a buzz among newspapers, politicians and analysts. According to a column published in &quot;The Clinic&quot;, the New Right is different from the old dictatorial right of Augusto Pinochet, in the sense that it embraces democracy. It is also different from the religiously conservative Unión Demócrata Independiente party, in that it is more open to discussing issues like divorce. According to the same analysis, the New Right is becoming increasingly pragmatic, as shown by their decision to increase taxes following the 2010 Chilean earthquake.

===France===

In France, the New Right (or &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot;) has been used as a term to describe a modern think-tank of French political philosophers and intellectuals led by Alain de Benoist. Another noted intellectual, who was once part of Alain de Benoist&#x27;s GRECE, is Guillaume Faye. Although accused by some critics as being &quot;far-right&quot; in their beliefs, they themselves claim that their ideas transcend the traditional left–right divide and actively encourages free debate. France also has one Identitarian New Right group (which is connected with Thule Seminar in Germany); that is Terre et Peuple of Pierre Vial, who was once an integral part and founding member of Alain de Benoist&#x27;s GRECE.

===Germany===

In Germany, the &quot;Neue Rechte&quot; (literally, &quot;new right&quot;) consists of two parts: the &quot;Jungkonservative&quot; (literally, young conservatives), who search for followers in the civic part of the population; and, secondly, the &quot;Nationalrevolutionäre&quot; (national revolutionists), who are looking for followers in the ultra-right part of the German population and use the rhetoric of right-wing politicians such as Gregor and Otto Strasser. Another noted New Right group in Germany is Thule Seminar of Pierre Krebs.

===Greece===
Failos Kranidiotis, a Greek politician who had been expelled by New Democracy chairman Kyriakos Mitsotakis for expressing views similar to those of political rival Golden Dawn, founded the New Right party, based on national liberalism, in May 2016. His views diverged from those of former Prime Minister of Greece Konstantinos Mitsotakis, whose legacy expressed the most important principle of its recently elected leadership, including Adonis Georgiadis, who had been a member only since leaving far-right Popular Orthodox Rally in 2012.

===Iran===
In Iran, &quot;New Right&quot; and the term &quot;Modern Right&quot; () is associated with the Executives of Construction Party, which has split from the traditional Right.

===Israel===
New Right is a right-wing political party in Israel, founded in 2018 and led by Ayelet Shaked and Naftali Bennett. The party aims to be a party open to both secular and religious people. The party advocates the preservation of a strong right-wing in Israel.

===Netherlands===
The New Right (NR) was the name of a far-right/nationalist political party in the Netherlands from 2003 to 2007. The Party for Freedom (PVV), founded in 2005 and led by Geert Wilders, also is a New Right movement. Since March 2017, Forum for Democracy is another New Right party in the Dutch parliament.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, as in Australia, it was the Labour Party that initially adopted New Right economic policies. &quot;Rogernomics&quot; involved monetarist approaches to controlling inflation, corporatisation of government departments, and the removal of tariffs and subsidies, while the party also pursued social liberal stances such as decriminalisation of male homosexuality, pay equity for women and adopting a nuclear-free policy. This meant temporary realignment within New Zealand politics, as New Right middle-class voters voted Labour at the 1987 New Zealand general election in approval of its economic policies. At first, Labour corporatised many former government departments and state assets, then emulated the Conservative Thatcher administration and privatised them altogether during Labour&#x27;s second term of office. However, recession and privatisation together led to increasing strains within the Labour Party, which led to schism, and the exit of Jim Anderton and his NewLabour Party, which later formed part of the Alliance Party with the Greens and other opponents of New Right economics.

However, dissent and schism were not to be limited to the Labour Party and Alliance Party alone. During the Labour Party&#x27;s second term in office, the Opposition New Zealand National Party (popularly known as &quot;National&quot;) selected Ruth Richardson as Opposition finance spokesperson, and when National won the 1990 general election, Richardson became Minister of Finance, while Jenny Shipley became Minister of Social Welfare. Richardson introduced deunionisation legislation, known as the Employment Contracts Act, in 1991, while Shipley presided over social welfare benefit cuts, designed to reduce welfare dependency – both core New Right policy initiatives.

In the early 1990s, maverick National Party MP Winston Peters also came to oppose New Right economic policies and led his elderly voting bloc out of the National Party. As a result, his New Zealand First anti-monetarist party has been a partner in coalition governments led by both National (1996–98) and Labour (2005–08 and 2017–20). Due to the introduction of the MMP electoral system, a New Right &quot;Association of Consumers and Taxpayers&quot; party, known as ACT New Zealand, was formed by ex-Labour New Right–aligned Cabinet Ministers like Richard Prebble and others, and maintaining existing New Right policy initiatives such as the Employment Contracts Act, while also introducing U.S.-style welfare reform. ACT New Zealand aspired to become National&#x27;s centre-right coalition partner but has been hampered by lack of party unity and populist leadership that often-lacked strategic direction.

As for Labour and National themselves, their fortunes have been mixed. Labour was out of office for most of the nineties, only regaining power when Helen Clark led it to victory and a Labour/Alliance coalition and centre-left government (1999–2002). However, the Alliance disintegrated in 2002. National was defeated in 1999 due to the absence of a suitable stable coalition partner, given New Zealand First&#x27;s partial disintegration after Winston Peters abandoned the prior National-led coalition. When Bill English became leader of National in 2001, it was thought that he might lead the party away from its prior hardline New Right economic and social policies, but his indecisiveness and lack of firm policy direction led to ACT New Zealand gaining the New Right middle-class voting basis in 2002. When Don Brash became leader, New Right middle-class voters returned to National&#x27;s fold, causing National&#x27;s revival in fortunes at the 2005 New Zealand general election. However, at the same time, ACT New Zealand strongly criticised it for deviating from its former New Right economic policy perspectives, and at the same election, National did little to enable ACT&#x27;s survival. Don Brash resigned as National party leader, being replaced by John Key, who was a more moderate National MP.

As for the centre-left, Helen Clark and her Labour-led coalition were criticised by ex-Alliance members and non-government organisations for their alleged lack of attention to centre-left social policies, while trade union membership recovered due to Labour&#x27;s repeal of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 and labour market deregulation and the deunionisation that had accompanied it in the nineties. It is plausible that Clark and her Cabinet were influenced by Tony Blair and his British Labour Government, which pursued a similar balancing act between social and fiscal responsibility while in government.

===Poland===
In Poland, a conservative libertarian and eurosceptic political party Congress of the New Right (New Right) was founded on 25 March 2011 from former political parties Freedom and Lawfulness (WiP) and Real Politics Union (UPR) by Janusz Korwin-Mikke. It is backed up by various voters, some conservatives, far left people who want to legalize marijuana and citizens who endorse free market and capitalism .

=== South Korea ===
In South Korea, the South Korean New Right movement is a Korean attempt at neoconservative politics. The Lee Myung-bak government led by President Lee Myung-bak and the conservative Grand National Party is noted for being a benefactor of the domestic New Right movement.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, the term New Right more specifically refers to a strand of Conservatism that Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan influenced. Thatcher&#x27;s style of New Right ideology, known as Thatcherism, was heavily influenced by the work of Friedrich Hayek (in particular the book &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;). They were ideologically committed to economic liberalism as well as being socially conservative.

===United States===

In the United States, New Right refers to two historically distinct conservative political movements. These American New Rights are distinct from and opposed to the more moderate tradition of the so-called Rockefeller Republicans. The New Right also differs from the Old Right (1933–55) on issues concerning foreign policy with neoconservatives being opposed to the non-interventionism of the Old Right.

==== First New Right ====
The first New Right (1955–64) was centered on the right-wing libertarians, traditionalists, and anti-communists at William F. Buckley&#x27;s &quot;National Review&quot;. Sociologists and journalists had used &quot;new right&quot; since the 1950s; it was first used as self-identification in 1962 by the student activist group Young Americans for Freedom.

The first New Right embraced what it called &quot;fusionism&quot; (an ostensible synthesis of classical liberal economics, traditional social values, and anti-communism) and coalesced in the years preceding the 1964 presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater. The Goldwater campaign, which failed to unseat incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson, hastened the formation of a new political movement.

First New Right figures:
* William F. Buckley Jr., editor of &quot;National Review&quot;
* James Burnham, anti-communist political theorist
* M. Stanton Evans, journalist and author of Young Americans for Freedom&#x27;s Sharon Statement
* Barry Goldwater, U.S. Senator from Arizona and Republican U.S. presidential candidate
* Frank Meyer, anti-communist libertarian and creator of the &quot;fusionist&quot; political theory

==== Second New Right ====
The second New Right (1964 to present) was formed in the wake of the Goldwater campaign and had a more populist tone than the first New Right. The second New Right tended to focus on wedge issues (such as abortion) and was often linked with the Religious Right. The second New Right formed a policy approach and electoral apparatus that brought Ronald Reagan into the White House in the 1980 presidential election. The New Right was organized in the American Enterprise Institute and The Heritage Foundation to counter the so-called &quot;liberal establishment&quot;, which they viewed as a contributor to corruption and mismanagement of the federal government. In elite think tanks and local community organizations alike, new policies, marketing strategies, and electoral strategies were crafted over the succeeding decades to promote strongly conservative policies. The second New Right objected to a perceived decline in morality, including increased drug use, more public and open displays of sexuality, rising crime rates, race riots and unrest from civil rights protesters, and Vietnam War protesters.

Second New Right figures:
* James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family
* Pat Buchanan, political commentator, founder of &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, and candidate in the 1992 Republican Party presidential primaries
* George W. Bush, 43rd president of the United States
* Terry Dolan, founder of the National Conservative Political Action Committee
* Jerry Falwell, Southern Baptist minister, founder of Liberty University and Moral Majority
* Newt Gingrich, former Congressman, Speaker of the House, candidate for the Presidency of the United States, author
* Robert Grant, Christian right activist and founder of Christian Voice
* Rush Limbaugh, nationally syndicated talk radio and former cable news host, author
* Milton Friedman, neoclassical economist of the Chicago school of economics, recipient of the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences
* Howard Phillips, founder of The Conservative Caucus
* Ronald Reagan, 40th president of the United States, actor, 33rd governor of California, union leader

<text>The 2002 Winter Paralympics, the eighth Paralympic Winter Games, were held in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, from 7 to 16 March 2002. A total of 416 athletes from 36 nations participated. They were the first Winter Paralympics in the American continent.
These were the first Paralympic Winter Games for Andorra, Chile, China, Croatia, Greece, and Hungary. Ragnhild Myklebust of Norway won five gold medals in skiing and biathlon, becoming the most successful Winter Paralympic athlete of all time with 22 medals, 17 of them gold.

==Opening ceremony==
The opening ceremony was held on 7 March 2002 at Rice-Eccles Stadium, with more than 40,000 spectators. Muffy Davis and Chris Waddell jointly lit the Paralympic cauldron.

==Closing ceremony==
The closing ceremony with more than 25.000 tickets sold was held on 16 March 2002 at the Olympic Medals Plaza in downtown Salt Lake City.

==Sports==
The games consisted of four disciplines in three sports, with 92 medal events in total.
*
*

== Venues ==
In total 5 venues were used at the 2002 Winter Olympics around 4 cities and towns.

===Salt Lake City===
*Rice-Eccles Olympic Stadium – opening ceremonies
*2002 Olympic Medals Plaza – closing ceremonies

===Weber County, Utah===
*Snowbasin: Alpine skiing

===Wasatch County, Utah===
*Soldier Hollow: Biathlon and Cross-Country

===West Valley City, Utah===
*E Center: Ice sledge hockey

==Medal table==

The top 10 NPCs by number of gold medals are listed below. The host nation (United States) is highlighted.

==Participating National Paralympics Committees==
36 nations qualified athletes for the games. Six countries:Andorra, Chile, China, Croatia, Greece and Hungary all made their debut appearances. Slovenia was the only nation who did not send a delegation after having participated in the previous games.

==Symbol and mascot of the games==

===Paralympic Emblem===
The logo of the Salt Lake 2002 Paralympic Winter Games is made up of three distinct marks. The sphere on the top represents the head of the Paralympic athlete and also symbolizes the global unity of the Paralympic Movement. Two broad fluid lines represent the athlete in motion. The three taegeuks beneath the athlete reproduce the green, red and blue marks on the Paralympic Flag.

===Mascot===

The mascot for the Paralympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City 2002 was Otto the otter. Indigenous peoples of the Americas consider otters to be fast swimmers, though in some stories a bit of a show-off. After being nearly wiped out by pollution and over-trapping the river otter has been reintroduced to Utah and can be seen along the banks of the Green River and near Flaming Gorge. The otter was chosen as the official mascot of the Salt Lake 2002 Paralympic Winter Games because he embodies vitality and agility, and represents the spirit of every Paralympian.

<doc id="333248" wikidata="Q1412154" url="?curid=333248" title="HP 48 series">
<text>The HP 48 is a series of graphing calculators designed and produced by Hewlett-Packard from 1990 until 2003. The series includes the HP 48S, HP 48SX, HP 48G, HP 48GX, and HP 48G+, the G models being expanded and improved versions of the S models. The models with an X suffix are expandable via special RAM (memory expansion) and ROM (software application) cards. In particular, the GX models have more onboard memory than the G models. The G+ models have more onboard memory only. The SX and S models have the same amount of onboard memory.

Note that the similarly named hp 48gII (2004) is not a member of the series but closely related to the HP 49G+.

The calculators use Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and the RPL programming language. The hardware architecture developed for the HP 48 series became the basis for the HP 38G, with a simplified user interface and an infix input method, and the HP 49G with various software enhancements. Likewise, the hardware and software design of the HP 48 calculators are themselves strongly influenced by other calculators in the HP line, most of all by the HP-18C and the HP-28 series.

==Models / Availability==
The HP 48SX was introduced on 1990-03-06.

Availability:
* 48SX: 1990–1993
* 48S: 1991–1993
* 48GX (F1895A): 1993–2003
* 48GX ASEE: 1993 (special edition labelled &quot;1893 ASEE 1993 Shaping our world - Century II&quot;)
* 48G: 1993–2003
* 48G+ (F1630A, F1894A): 1998–2003

==Specifications==
The HP 48 series&#x27; Saturn microprocessor is a hybrid 64-bit / 20-bit CPU hardware-wise but acts like a 4-bit processor in that it presents nibble-based data to programs and uses a nibble-based addressing system. The main registers A, B, C, D, along with temp registers R0, R1, R2, R3, and R4 are a full 64-bits wide, but the data registers D0 &amp; D1 are only 20-bit. External logical data fetches are transparently converted to 8-bit physical fetches. The processor has a 20-bit address bus available to code but due to the presence of the high/low nibble selection bit, only 19 bits are available externally.

In both the HP 48S/SX and G/GX series, the &quot;Saturn&quot; CPU core is integrated as part of a more complex integrated circuit (IC) package. These packages have codenames inspired by the members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The codename of the IC is &quot;Clarke&quot; in the S/SX, after William Clark, and &quot;Yorke&quot; in the G/GX, after Clark&#x27;s manservant. The previous series of Saturn-based ICs were codenamed &quot;Lewis&quot;, after Meriwether Lewis.

===Common for all models===
* CPU architecture: Saturn
* Screen resolution: 131×64 pixels. There were 3 versions of the LCD display used across the range with each improving visibility and contrast over the predecessor.
* Communication ports: 4-pin RS-232 (Serial port, standard UART at 1200 to 9600 bauds with option for parity (none/even/odd/mark/space)) and Infrared port (not IrDA, similar to serial, zeroes are pulses with duration 1/8 of a full bit time)
* Data bus width: 8-bit (external)
* Maximum 4-bit-cell address width: 20 bits (leading to the address space shown next)
* Logical address space: 512 KB
* Maximum register size: 64 bit (both working and scratch registers)
* Available expansion card ports on X models: 2
* Expansion card pins: 40

===HP 48S/HP 48SX specific===
* CPU clock frequency: 2 MHz
* Memory clock frequency: 2 MHz
* CPU codename: Clarke (Saturn 1LT8 core)
* Communication protocol(s): Kermit (protocol)
* On-board ROM: 256 KB
* On-board RAM: 32 KB
* Maximum additional memory per expansion card: 128 KB (48SX only)
* ROM versions: A, B, C, D, E, (F,) J
* Orange and blue shift buttons

===HP 48G/HP 48GX/HP 48G+ specific===
* CPU clock frequency: 3.68 to 4 MHz
** Some claim that the frequency varies according to temperature
** According to one of the engineers on the design team of the HP 48G series (Dave Arnett), the yields for 4 MHz CPUs were essentially separated into two bins: the ones closest to spec, generally near 3.93–3.94 MHz, were reserved for the expandable models (GX), and those just slightly under spec were used for the non-expandable units (G). Eventually the yields improved and the CPUs which clocked closer to 4 MHz were installed in the non-expandable units as well. The effects of (non-extreme) temperatures are almost negligible.
* Memory clock frequency: 2 MHz
* CPU codename: Yorke (Saturn HP 00048-80063 core)
* Communication protocol(s): Kermit (protocol), Xmodem
* On-board ROM: 512 KB
* On-board RAM: 32 KB (48G) or 128 KB (48G+/48GX)
* Maximum additional memory for expansion card port 1: 128 KB
* Maximum additional memory for expansion card port 2: 4 MB (128 KB addressable at any given time via bank switching)
* ROM versions: K, L, M, P, R
* Purple and blue-green shift buttons. This is sort of a design error, since these colors may be indistinguishable for red-green color blind people

==Programming==
The HP 48 series of calculators support a stack-based programming language named RPL, a supposed combination of Reverse Polish notation (RPN) and Lisp. RPL adds the concepts of lists and functions to stack-based programming, allowing the programmer to pass unevaluated code as arguments to functions, or return unevaluated code from a function by leaving it on the stack.

RPL comes in two flavors: &quot;User RPL&quot; and &quot;System RPL&quot;. &quot;User RPL&quot; is the language that a user can program directly on the calculator. &quot;System RPL&quot; requires an external compiler; this may be done on the calculator with a third-party utility, or on another machine. The two languages vary mainly in the number of low-level operations available to them. &quot;User RPL&quot; does not expose any commands that do not check their arguments. Consequently, &quot;User RPL&quot; programs cannot normally crash the calculator (and are therefore slower than &quot;System RPL&quot; programs), whereas a &quot;System RPL&quot; program that invokes a command with incorrect arguments will almost certainly leave the calculator in a state which requires a full memory reset.

It is also possible to program the HP 48 directly in HP Saturn assembly language. This can be done either via user-supplied on-calculator tools (eg. Jazz), or on another machine using user-supplied tools or those published directly by Hewlett-Packard (eg. SASM et al.).

==Emulators==
* Emu48 for Windows
* Alcuin for Commodore Amiga
* X48 for Mac OS X, POSIX (Unix/Linux)
* i48 - HP48GX emulator for iOS, based on X48
* m48 – HP48 emulator for the iPhone, based on Emu48
* Droid48 – HP48G Emulator for Android, based on X48
* droid48sx – HP48SX Emulator for Android, based on Droid48
* An HP48 emulator – decompiler for Unix/Linux or Windows (using Cygwin) by Paul Courbis

== In popular culture ==
* An HP 48 can be seen in the 2012 movie &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and its sequel.
