<text>The 49th Armored Division —nicknamed the &quot;Lone Star&quot;— was an armored division of the Texas Army National Guard during the Cold War.

Active from 1947, the division formed part of the Texas Army National Guard together with the 36th Infantry Division. It was called up for active duty between 1961 and 1962 during the Berlin Crisis. In 1968 both Texas divisions were inactivated and used to form separate units. The 49th Armored was reformed in 1973 as the sole Texas division. When reflagged as the 36th Infantry Division in 2004, it was the last armored division remaining in the United States Army National Guard.

== History ==
After the end of World War II, the United States National Guard was reorganized and expanded from its prewar size. Initial War Department unit allocations submitted to states for review in early February 1946 gave the 49th Armored Division to Texas and New Mexico, with the latter receiving one combat command headquarters and its subordinate units as well as field artillery and engineer battalions. As the governor of New Mexico desired to continue his state&#x27;s prewar antiaircraft units, the 49th Armored Division was made all-Texas and New Mexico received the 111th Antiaircraft Artillery Brigade. The division, whose units were accepted by the Texas adjutant general on 2 July 1946, included two combat commands and a reserve command with the 145th, 146th, and 147th Tank Battalions and the 145th, 146th, and 147th Armored Infantry Battalions. The division artillery included the 105 mm howitzer-equipped 645th, 646th, and 647th Armored Field Artillery Battalions. Division troops included the 49th Mechanized Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron and the 386th Armored Engineer Battalion as well as other support units. It and the New Jersey 50th Armored Division were the only armored divisions in the National Guard at the time. A number of the original divisional units received federal recognition from the National Guard Bureau on 27 February 1947, a date used thereafter as the formation&#x27;s &quot;birthday&quot;, including the division headquarters at Camp Mabry in Austin. In 1947, all four battalions of the 144th Infantry Regiment were placed into the Division as mechanized infantry units. The division headquarters location changed to Fort Worth on 4 August 1949 and to Dallas on 31 August 1950. Beginning in the northern and northeastern areas of the State, there were 111 units in 56 Texas cities by 1952.

In September 1961, an executive order alerted the division for mobilization at Dallas due to the 1961 Berlin Crisis. The 49th Armored and the Wisconsin 32nd Infantry Division were mobilized in order to replace active divisions scheduled to be deployed from the strategic reserve. On 15 October the division entered federal service and soon afterwards concentrated at Fort Hood. It subsequently deployed to Fort Polk, Louisiana, where it remained for ten months. In May 1962, the division staged the large-scale Exercise Iron Dragoon, still remembered among National Guard armor exercises. Also while at Fort Polk the division&#x27;s missile unit became the first Army National Guard unit to fire the Honest John nuclear-tipped surface-to-surface missile. The 49th Armored Division reverted to Texas State control in August 1962 after the newly reformed active duty 1st Armored and 5th Infantry Divisions were ready to take the place of it and the 32nd Infantry Division in the strategic reserve.

The 49th Armored reorganized under the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) structure in March 1963. Under the ROAD structure, the division included four mechanized infantry battalions and five armor battalions.

The 49th Armored was inactivated in 1968. Their units were used to form the 71st Airborne Brigade, the 72nd Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), and the 49th Armor Group. The 49th Armor Group became the 49th Armored Brigade on 1 September 1971. A Department of Defense directive to the army to convert six National Guard brigades from infantry to armor in order to act as reinforcements for troops in Europe in event of war resulted in the reactivation of the division, headquartered at Camp Mabry, on 1 November 1973. The reorganized 49th Armored consisted of five mechanized and six armor battalions; it and the 50th Armored were once again the only National Guard armored divisions. For the rest of its existence, the 49th, as the only Texas Army National Guard division, formed the bulk of the force. The division accounted for 14,854 personnel out of the 17,643 authorized for the Texas Army National Guard in 1976. The 1st Battalion, 200th Air Defense Artillery of the New Mexico Army National Guard was added as the divisional anti-aircraft gun battalion on 1 September 1975.

In January of 2004, Alpha Company of 1st Squadron, 124th Cavalry Regiment (United States), 180 Soldiers, were mobilized to serve in Operation Iraqi Freedom. They saw action in and around Baghdad, and served as security for the 89th Military Police Brigade. For their actions while deployed, they would be awarded the Texas Cavalry Medal, several Texas Purple Heart Medals, as well as an Army Meritorious Unit Commendation. They would remain in Iraq until May of 2005, after they had been re-flagged to the 36th Infantry Division. For the time before the de-activation of the 49th Armored Division, these soldiers were the first and only soldiers to see action in the Division&#x27;s history.

=== Organization 1989 ===
The division was reorganized as a heavy division in 1985 under the Army of Excellence structure together with the 50th Armored and the 35th and 40th Infantry Divisions. Thus, the division included four mechanized and six armor battalions by 1989. Due to equipment security concerns, the Army Reserve 549th Military Intelligence Battalion fulfilled the electronic warfare and intelligence role for the division, as in all but one of the National Guard divisions. On 1 June 1988 the division ceded some of its units, including the 1st Battalion, 133rd Field Artillery to the 36th Brigade, 50th Armored Division, which had been activated on that day. 3rd Battalion, 132nd Field Artillery was reactivated at El Paso to replace the 1st Battalion, 133rd Field Artillery.

The brigade&#x27;s armor battalions were equipped with M60A3 TTS main battle tanks. M48A5 Patton tanks had been replaced by M60A3 TTS tanks by May 1987 and by the end of 1989 the National Guard fielded 3,072 M60A3 TTS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fiscal Years 1988/1989&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 410 M1 Abrams tanks of the National Guard were issued to round-out units of army divisions. The division&#x27;s infantry battalions were equipped with M113 armored personnel carriers, of which the National Guard had 6,870 at the end of Fiscal Year 1987, with a further 1,411 due to be taken in service in 1988. The standard helicopters of National Guard units were the AH-1S Cobra, of which the National Guard had approximately 350 by 1989, the OH-58C Kiowa and the UH-1H Iroquois helicopters. Cavalry Reconnaissance units fielded 19 × M60A3 TTS, 8 × AH-1S Cobra, 12 × OH-58C Kiowa and 1 × UH-1H Iroquois helicopters; attack battalions fielded 21 × AH-1S Cobra, 13 × OH-58C Kiowa and 3 × UH-1H Iroquois helicopters, while the assault aviation company fielded 15 × UH-1H Iroquois helicopters and the command support aviation company UH-1 helicopters in various configurations.

=== Locations 1989 ===
=== Recent History ===
In 2000 elements of the division were deployed to take over the command and control of Multi-National Division (North) (MND-N) of the Stabilization Force in Bosnia (SFOR) as well as fulfill support missions for the MND-N troops. The division headquarters, aviation brigade headquarters, 249th Signal Battalion headquarters, the headquarters and Companies A and C of the 111th Engineer Battalion, the 649th Military Intelligence Battalion, the 149th Military Police Company, 1149th CID Detachment, 149th Personnel Services Battalion, 1104th Movement Control Team, and Company H, 149th Aviation (Air Traffic Support) were deployed.

On 23 January 2004, 180 Soldiers, mostly from the 124th Cavalry Regiment (United States) out of Waco, Texas, left for deployment. They reported in to Fort Dix for pre-deployment training, then deploying to the Sunni Triangle in Iraq. 

On 18 July 2004 the division was re-flagged and again designated as the 36th Infantry Division. Prior to its redesignation, the 49th was cap-stoned to the U.S. Army III Corps and stood as the only fully functional, reserve component, armored division in the United States Army. (The 50th Armored Division in the north eastern states had been eliminated by consolidation with the 42nd Infantry Division in the early 1990s.)

The Newly designated Troops came home after a year of deployment, with only a few wounded, and fortunately, no dead. They were the first Texas National Guardsmen to deploy since WWII. They are the last soldiers that were allowed to wear the 49th Armored patch as a battle patch. They would also be awarded the coveted Texas Cavalry Service Medal, as well as the wounded receiving the Texas Purple Heart Medal, the 3rd highest decoration awarded by the State of Texas.

<text>From 1795 to 1918, Poland was split between Prussia, the Habsburg monarchy, and Russia and had no independent existence. In 1795 the third and the last of the three 18th-century partitions of Poland ended the existence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Nevertheless, events both within and outside the Polish lands kept hopes for restoration of Polish independence alive throughout the 19th century. Poland&#x27;s geopolitical location on the Northern European Lowlands became especially important in a period when its expansionist neighbors, the Kingdom of Prussia and Imperial Russia, involved themselves intensely in European rivalries and alliances as modern nation-states took form over the entire continent.

==The Napoleonic period==
At the turn of the 19th century, Europe had begun to feel the impact of
momentous political and intellectual movements that, among their other effects,
would keep the &quot;Polish Question&quot; on the agenda of international issues needing
resolution. Most immediately, Napoleon Bonaparte had established a new empire in France in 1804 following that country&#x27;s revolution.
Other powers&#x27; refusal of the new status of France kept Europe at war for the
next decade and brought him into conflict with the same east European powers
that had beleaguered Poland in the last decades of the previous century. An alliance of convenience was the natural result of this situation. Volunteer Polish legions attached themselves to Bonaparte&#x27;s armies, hoping that in return the emperor would allow an independent Poland to reappear out of his conquests.

Although Napoleon promised more than he ever intended to deliver to the Polish cause, in 1807 he created a Duchy of Warsaw from Prussian territory that had been part of old Poland and was still inhabited by Poles. Basically a French puppet, the duchy did enjoy some degree of self-government, and many Poles believed that further Napoleonic victories would bring restoration of the entire commonwealth.

In 1809, under Jozef Poniatowski, nephew of Stanislaw II August, the duchy reclaimed some of the territories taken by Austria in the third partition. The Russian Army occupied the duchy as it chased Napoleon out of Russia in 1813, however, and Polish expectations ended with the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815. In the subsequent peace settlement of the Congress of Vienna, the victorious Austrians and Prussians swept away the Duchy of Warsaw and reconfirmed most of the terms of the final partition of Poland.

Although brief, the Napoleonic period occupies an important place in Polish history. Much of the legend and symbolism of modern Polish patriotism derives from this period, including the conviction that Polish independence is a necessary element of a just and legitimate European order. This conviction was simply expressed in a fighting slogan of the time, &quot;for your freedom and ours.&quot;

Moreover, the appearance of the Duchy of Warsaw so soon after the partitions proved that the seemingly final historical death sentence delivered in 1795 was not necessarily the end of the Polish nation-state. Instead, many observers came to believe that favourable circumstances would free Poland from foreign domination.

==The impact of nationalism and romanticism==
The intellectual and artistic climate of the early 19th century further stimulated the growth of Polish demands for self-government. During these decades, modern nationalism took shape and rapidly developed a massive following throughout the continent, becoming the most dynamic and appealing political doctrine of its time. By stressing the value and dignity of native cultures and languages, nationalism offered a rationale for ethnic loyalty and Romanticism was the artistic element of 19th-century European culture that exerted the strongest influence on the Polish national consciousness. The Romantic movement was a natural partner of political nationalism, for it echoed the nationalist sympathy for folk cultures and manifested a general air of disdain for the conservative political order of post-Napoleonic Europe. Under this influence, Polish literature flourished anew in the works of a school of 19th-century Romantic poets, led by Adam Mickiewicz. Mickiewicz concentrated on patriotic themes and the glorious national past. Frédéric Chopin, a leading composer of the century, also used the tragic history of his nation as a major inspiration.

Nurtured by these influences, nationalism awoke first among the intelligentsia and certain segments of the nobility, then more gradually in the peasantry. At the end of the process, a broader definition of nationhood had replaced the old class-based &quot;noble patriotism&quot; of Poland.

==The era of national insurrections==
For several decades, the Polish national movement gave priority to the immediate restoration of independence, a drive that found expression in a series of armed rebellions. The insurgencies arose mainly in the Russian zone of partition to the east, about three-quarters of which was formerly Polish territory. After the Congress of Vienna, Russia had organized its Polish lands as the Congress Poland, granting it a quite liberal constitution, its own army, and limited within the tsarist empire. In the 1820s, however, Russian rule grew more arbitrary, and secret societies were formed by intellectuals in several cities to plot an insurrection. In November 1830, Polish troops in Warsaw rose in revolt. When the government of Congress Poland proclaimed solidarity with the rebel forces shortly thereafter, a new Polish-Russian war began. The rebels&#x27; requests for aid from France were ignored, and their reluctance to abolish serfdom cost them the support of the peasantry. By September 1831, the Russians had subdued Polish resistance and forced 6,000 resistance fighters into exile in France, beginning a time of harsh repression of intellectual and religious activity throughout Poland. At the same time, Congress Poland lost its constitution and its army.

After the failure of the November Revolt, clandestine conspiratorial activity continued on Polish territory. An exiled Polish political and intellectual elite established a base of operations in Paris. A conservative group headed by Adam Jerzy Czartoryski (one of the leaders of the November Revolt) relied on foreign diplomatic support to restore Poland&#x27;s status as established by the Congress of Vienna, which Russia had routinely violated beginning in 1819. Otherwise, this group was satisfied with a return to monarchy and traditional social structures.

The radical factions never formed a united front on any issue besides the general goal of independence. Their programs insisted that the Poles liberate themselves by their own efforts and linked independence with republicanism and the emancipation of the serfs. Handicapped by internal division, limited resources, heavy surveillance, and persecution of revolutionary cells in Poland, the Polish national movement suffered numerous losses. The movement sustained a major setback in the 1846 revolt organized in Austrian Poland by the Polish Democratic Society, the leading radical nationalist group. The uprising ended in a bloody fiasco when the peasantry took up arms against the rebel leadership dominated by nobility and gentry, which was regarded as potentially a worse oppressor than the Austrians. By incurring harsh military repression from Austria, the failed revolt left the Polish nationalists in a poor position to participate in the wave of national revolution that crossed Europe in 1848 and 1849. The stubborn idealism of this uprising&#x27;s leaders emphasized individual liberty and separate national identity rather than establishment of a unified republic—a significant change of political philosophy from earlier movements.

The last and most tenacious of the Polish uprisings of the mid-19th century erupted in the Russian-occupied sector in January 1863 (see January Uprising). Following Russia&#x27;s disastrous defeat in the Crimean War, the government of Tsar Alexander II enacted a series of liberal reforms, including liberation of the serfs throughout the empire. The high-handed imposition of land reforms in Poland aroused hostility among the conservative landed nobility on the one hand, and a group of young radical intellectuals influenced by Karl Marx and the Russian liberal Alexander Herzen, on the other. Repeating the pattern of 1830–31, the open revolt of the January Insurrection by Congress Poland failed to win foreign backing. Although its socially progressive program could not mobilize the peasants, the rebellion persisted stubbornly for fifteen months. After finally crushing the insurgency in August 1864, Russia abolished the Congress Poland altogether and revoked the separate status of the Polish lands, incorporating them directly as the Western Region of the Russian Empire. The region was placed under the dictatorial rule of Mikhail Muravyov-Vilensky, who became known as the Hangman of Vilnius. All Polish citizens were assimilated into the empire. When Russia officially emancipated the Polish serfs in early 1864, an act that constituted the most important event in history of nineteenth-century Poland, it removed a major rallying point from the agenda of potential Polish revolutionaries.

==The time of &quot;Organic Work&quot;==

Increasing oppression at Russian hands after failed national uprisings finally convinced Polish leaders that the recent insurrection was premature. During the decades that followed the January Insurrection, Poles largely forsook the goal of immediate independence and turned instead to fortifying the nation through the subtler means of education, economic development, and modernization. This approach took the name &quot;Organic Work&quot; (&quot;Praca organiczna&quot;) for its philosophy of strengthening Polish society at the grass roots, influenced by positivism. For some, the adoption of Organic Work meant permanent resignation to foreign rule, but many advocates recommended it as a strategy to combat repression while awaiting an eventual opportunity to achieve self-government.

Neither as colorful as the rebellions nor as loftily enshrined in national memory, the quotidian methods of Organic Work proved well suited to the political conditions of the later 19th century. The international balance of forces did not favour the recovery of statehood when both Russia and Germany appeared bent on the eventual eradication of Polish national identity. The German Empire, established in 1871 as an expanded version of the Prussian state, aimed at the assimilation of its eastern provinces inhabited by Poles. At the same time, St. Petersburg attempted to russify the former Congress Poland, joining Berlin in levying restrictions against use of the Polish language and cultural expression. Poles under Russian and German rule also endured official campaigns against the Roman Catholic Church: the Cultural Struggle (Kulturkampf) of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck to bring the Roman Catholic Church under state control and the Russian campaign to extend Orthodoxy throughout the empire.

The Polish subjects under Austrian jurisdiction (after 1867 the Habsburg Empire was commonly known as Austria-Hungary) confronted a generally more lenient regime. Poles suffered no religious persecution in predominantly Catholic Austria, and Vienna counted on the Polish nobility as allies in the complex political calculus of its multinational realm. In return for loyalty, Austrian Poland, or Galicia, received considerable administrative and cultural autonomy. Galicia gained a reputation as an oasis of toleration amidst the oppression of German and Russian Poland. The Galician provincial Sejm acted as a semiautonomous parliamentary body, and Poles represented the region in the empire government in Vienna. In the late 19th century, the universities of Kraków and Lviv became the centers of Polish intellectual activity, and Kraków became the center of Polish art and thought. Even after the restoration of independence, many residents of southern Poland retained a touch of nostalgia for the days of the Habsburg Empire.

==Social and political transformation==
Profound social and economic forces operated on the Polish lands throughout the late 19th century, giving them a more modern aspect and altering traditional patterns of life. Especially in Russian Poland and the Silesian regions under German control, mining and manufacturing started on a large scale. This development sped the process of urbanization, and the emergence of capitalism began to reduce the relative importance of the landed aristocracy in Polish society. A considerable segment of the peasantry abandoned the overburdened land. Millions of Poles emigrated to North America and other destinations, and millions more migrated to cities to form the new industrial labour force. These shifts stimulated fresh social tensions. Urban workers bore the full range of hardships associated with early capitalism, and the intensely nationalistic atmosphere of the day bred frictions between Poles and the other peoples remaining from the old heterogeneous Commonwealth of Two Nations. The movement of the former noble class into cities created a new urban professional class. However, the peasants that tried to move to the cities, found all the better positions already occupied by Jews and Germans. This contributed to the national tensions among the Poles, Germans, and Jews. At this time the Jewish population in Prussian Poland tended to identify with and want to belong to Germany, insofar as the latter, like the Jews themselves, had a more urbanized, cosmopolitan outlook. Another factor, not to be overlooked or underestimated is the traditional language spoken by the Ashkenazi Jews of Central and Eastern Europe, Yiddish, is also a Germanic language written in Hebrew characters, which afforded some natural compatibility with the German language dominated Austria-Hungarian and Prussian cultures.

These transformations changed the face of politics as well, giving rise to new parties and movements that would dominate the Polish landscape for the next century. The grievances of the lower classes led to the formation of peasant and socialist parties. Communism gained only a marginal following, but a more moderate socialist faction led by Józef Piłsudski won broader support through its emphatic advocacy of Polish independence. By 1905 Piłsudski&#x27;s party, the Polish Socialist Party, was the largest socialist party in the entire Russian Empire. The National Democracy of Roman Dmowski became the leading vehicle of the right by espousing a doctrine that combined nationalism with hostility toward Jews and other minorities. By the turn of the 20th century, Polish political life had emerged from the relative quiescence of Organic Work and entered a stage of renewed assertiveness. In particular, Piłsudski and Dmowski had initiated what would be long careers as the paramount figures in the civic affairs of Poland. After 1900 political activity was suppressed only in the Prussian sector.

==First World War==

At the outbreak of the First World War Poland&#x27;s geographical position between Germany and Russia had meant much fighting and horrific human and material losses for the Poles between 1914 and 1918. At the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in spring 1918, revolutionary Russia renounced Russian claims to Poland. Following the German defeat and the replacement of Hohenzollern rule by the Weimar Republic and the collapse of Habsburg Austria-Hungary, Poland became an independent republic.

===War and the Polish lands===
The war split the ranks of the three partitioning empires, pitting Russia as defender of Serbia and ally of Britain and France against the leading members of the Central Powers, Germany and Austria-Hungary. This circumstance afforded the Poles political leverage as both sides offered pledges of concessions and future autonomy in exchange for Polish loyalty and army recruits. The Austrians wanted to incorporate Congress Poland into their territory of Galicia, so even before the war they allowed nationalist organisations to form there (for example, Związek Strzelecki). The Russians recognized the Polish right to autonomy and allowed formation of the Polish National Committee, which supported the Russian side. In 1916, attempting to increase Polish support for the Central Powers and to raise a Polish army the German and Austrian emperors declared a new Kingdom of Poland, (see Regency Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918). The new Kingdom consisted only of a small part of the old Commonwealth, i.e. the territory of Congress Poland, although some promises were made about a future incorporation of Vilna and Minsk. The Kingdom was ruled by three Regents, possessed a Parliament and a Government, a small army and its own currency, called the Polish mark. The Regency Kingdom was the fourth and last monarchy in Poland&#x27;s history.

As the war settled into a long stalemate, the issue of Polish self-rule gained greater urgency. Roman Dmowski spent the war years in Western Europe, hoping to persuade the Allies to unify the Polish lands under Russian rule as an initial step toward liberation. In the meantime, Piłsudski had correctly predicted that the war would ruin all three of the partitioners, a conclusion most people thought highly unlikely before 1918. Piłsudski therefore formed the Polish Legions to assist the Central Powers in defeating Russia as the first step toward full independence for Poland.
Much of the heavy fighting on the war&#x27;s Eastern Front took place on the territory of the former Polish state. In 1914 Russian forces advanced very close to Kraków before being beaten back. The next spring, heavy fighting occurred around Gorlice and Przemyśl, to the east of Kraków in Galicia. In 1915 Polish territories were looted and abandoned by the retreating Russian army, trying to emulate the scorched earth policy of 1812; the Russians also evicted and deported hundreds of thousands of its inhabitants suspected of collaborating with the enemy. By the end of 1915, the Germans had occupied the entire Russian sector, including Warsaw. In 1916 another Russian offensive in Galicia exacerbated the already desperate situation of civilians in the war zone; about 1 million Polish refugees fled eastward behind Russian lines during the war. Although the Russian offensive of 1916 caught the Germans and Austrians by surprise, poor communications and logistics prevented the Russians from taking full advantage of their situation.

A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and 450,000 died. Several hundred thousand Polish civilians were moved to labour camps in Germany. The scorched-earth retreat strategies of both sides left much of the war zone uninhabitable.

===Recovery of statehood===
In 1917 two separate events decisively changed the character of the war and set it on a course toward the rebirth of Poland. The United States entered the conflict on the Allied side, while a process of revolutionary upheaval in Russia weakened her and then removed the Russians from the Eastern Front, finally bringing the Bolsheviks to power in that country. The army of Tsarist Russia ceased to be a factor when the Bolsheviks pulled Russia out of the war. At Brest-Litovsk the Bolsheviks renounced Russian claims to Poland. Compelled by force of German arms to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk all formerly Polish lands were ceded to the Central Powers. After the German defeat in the Fall of 1918; the overthrow of the Prussian Monarchy and its replacement by the liberal Weimar Republic, the road to an independent Polish state was opened.

The vacating of both Russia and Germany from Poland gave free rein to the calls of Woodrow Wilson at the Versailles Peace Conference, echoing those of the new Bolshevik regime, to liberate the Poles and other peoples from Greater Power suzerainty. The thirteenth of Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points adopted the resurrection of Poland as one of the main aims of the First World War.

Józef Piłsudski became a popular hero when Berlin jailed him for insubordination. The Allies broke the resistance of the Central Powers by autumn 1918, as the Habsburg monarchy disintegrated and the German imperial government collapsed. In October 1918, Polish authorities took over Galicia and Cieszyn Silesia. In November 1918, Piłsudski was released from internment in Germany by the revolutionaries and returned to Warsaw. Upon his arrival, on 11 November 1918 the &quot;Regency Council&quot; of the Kingdom of Poland ceded all responsibilities to him and Piłsudski took control over the newly created state as its provisional Chief of State. Soon all the local governments that had been created in the last months of the war pledged allegiance to the central government in Warsaw. Independent Poland, which had been absent from the map of Europe for 123 years, was reborn.

The newly created state initially consisted of former Congress Poland, western Galicia (with Lwów besieged by the Ukrainians) and part of Cieszyn Silesia.

<text>The Alcmaeonidae (; , ; Attic: , ) or Alcmaeonids () were a wealthy and powerful noble family of ancient Athens, a branch of the Neleides who claimed descent from the mythological Alcmaeon, the great-grandson of Nestor.

In the 7th to late 5th centuries BC, the Alcmaeonidae played a significant role in the developments and events that occurred in Athens. Such developments included overthrowing an Athenian tyrant, helping to lay the foundations of Athenian democracy, and having generals for Athens during the Peloponnesian War. The Alcmaeonidae were mentioned frequently throughout Herodotus&#x27; &quot;The Histories&quot;, and many played a key role in shaping Athens. The first prominent Alcmaeonid was Megacles, who was exiled from the city and given a curse on him and his family. Furthermore, there was Cleisthenes, who became known as &quot;the father of Athenian democracy&quot; by numerous scholars and historians. Another famous Alcmaeonid was Pericles, whom Thucydides would later call &quot;the first citizen of Athens,&quot; as well as Alcibiades, who switched sides numerous times during the Peloponnesian War, and would end up being the last of the notable Alcmaeonidae. The main aristocratic rival of the Alcmaeonidae in the 6th and 5th centuries BC were the Peisistratids.

== Early background and history ==
Unlike many aristocratic families at the time, the Alcmaeonidae were not named after a mythological founder, but rather from a historical figure. In this case, the founder was Alcmaeon, father of Megacles. Similar to other aristocratic families however, was that the Alcmaeonidae did employ the tradition of reusing the name of the maternal or paternal grandfather in the family. As a result, there are numerous Megacles, Alcmaeon, and Cleisthenes names in this family. The first noteworthy Alcmaeonid was Megacles, son of Alcmaeon, who was the Archon Eponymous of Athens in the 7th century BC. He was responsible for killing the followers of Cylon of Athens during the attempted coup in 632 BC, as Cylon had taken refuge as a suppliant at the temple of Athena, even though Megacles had promised their safety. In essence, he went against his word. As a result of their actions, Megacles and his Alcmaeonid followers were the subject of an ongoing curse and were exiled from the city. Even the bodies of buried Alcmaeonidae were dug up and removed from the city limits.

Alcmaeonids were allowed back into the city in 594 BC, during the archonship of Solon, and were able to recover significant influence. During the tyranny of Pisistratus, a member of the influential Peisistratids family and rival clan to the Alcmaeonidae, the aforementioned Megacles married his daughter to the tyrant, but when the tyrant refused to have children with her, Megacles and his allies banished him. Later the Alcmaeonids would claim to have been exiled following Pisistratus&#x27; return in 546 BC, so as to distance themselves from possible accusations of complicity, but epigraphic evidence in fact proves that Cleisthenes was archon for the year 525–24 BC. Megacles was able to marry (for a second or third time) Agarista, the daughter of the tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon. They had two sons, Hippocrates and another Cleisthenes, this one the reformer of Athenian democracy. Hippocrates&#x27; daughter was Agariste, the mother of Pericles.

== Contributions to Athenian democracy: Cleisthenes ==

The Alcmaeonid Cleisthenes overthrew Hippias, the son and successor of Pisistratus, in 508 BC. Herodotus claimed in his &quot;The Histories&quot; that the Alcmaeonidae specifically hated tyranny, and that they were more esteemed and highly honored than any other clan for ridding Athens from it. Cleisthenes had bribed the oracle at Delphi (which the Alcmaeonidae had helped to build while they were in exile) to convince the Spartans to help him, which they reluctantly did. He was, at first, opposed by some who felt the famous curse made the Alcmaeonidae ineligible to rule; the Spartan king Cleomenes I even turned against Cleisthenes and the latter was briefly exiled once more. However, the citizens called for Cleisthenes to return, as Cleisthenes achieved support from the masses due to his calls for a more democratic system against his rival Isagoras, thus giving more power to the people, and the restored Alcmaeonids were responsible for laying the foundations of Athenian democracy.

A few of the contributions that the Alcmaeonid Cleisthenes helped develop in Athens included the shifting of political organization from the four traditional tribes, which were based on family relations and which formed the basis of the upper class Athenian political power network, into ten tribes according to their area of residence (their &quot;deme&quot;), which would form the basis of a new democratic power structure. Additionally, through Cleisthenes&#x27; reforms, the people of Athens endowed their city with isonomic institutions—equal rights for all citizens (though only men were citizens)—and established ostracism as a punishment. He also established sortition—the random selection of citizens to fill government positions rather than kinship or heredity, a true test of real democracy. He reorganized the Boule, created with 400 members under Solon, so that it had 500 members, 50 from each tribe. He also introduced the bouletic oath, &quot;To advise according to the laws what was best for the people&quot;.

== Later years: Pericles and Alcibiades ==
The Alcmaeonidae were said to have negotiated for an alliance with the Persians during the Persian Wars, despite the fact that Athens was leading the resistance to the Persian invasion. In Herodotus&#x27; &quot;The Histories&quot;, the Alcmaeonidae were accused of sending a shield as a warning signal for the Persians, something that Herodotus, in his opinion, refused to believe that the Alcmaeonidae could be traitors to Athens. In addition, many scholars have debated over the veracity of the story of the shield signal, some believing that it was a ploy to slander the Alcmaeonidae, others that it was just a tale that had gained traction and had no truth.

Pericles and Alcibiades also belonged to the Alcmaeonidae, and during the Peloponnesian War the Spartans referred to the family&#x27;s curse in an attempt to discredit Pericles. Pericles led Athens from roughly 461 to 429 BC, in what is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Age of Pericles.&quot; He is credited in part for the transformation of Athens into an empire through the Delian League. Pericles promoted the arts and literature, and it is principally through his efforts that Athens acquired the reputation of being the educational and cultural center of the ancient Greek world. He started an ambitious project that generated most of the surviving structures on the Acropolis, including the Parthenon. This project beautified and protected the city, exhibited its glory, and gave work to its people. Pericles&#x27; Funeral Oration is nowadays synonymous with the struggle for participatory democracy and civic pride. He eventually would succumb to the Plague of Athens that ran rampant during this time, killing numerous people.

Alcibiades was a prominent orator, general, and statesman of Athens as well; however, he would end up switching sides from Athens to Sparta several times during the Peloponnesian War. He was an aggressive advocate for the Sicilian Expedition, and eventually fled to Sparta after accusations of sacrilege. According to some scholars, Alcibiades was an invincible general and wherever he went, victory would follow; had he led the army in Sicily, the Athenians would have avoided disaster and, had his countrymen followed his advice at Aegospotami, Lysander would have lost and Athens would have ruled Greece. Alcibiades also tried to ally with the Persians after he was accused of impiety, but Thucydides claims this was due to him wanting to be restored in Athens by the Persians. Ultimately failing to achieve this goal. The family would eventually disappear from prominence after the defeat of Athens in the Peloponnesian War.

==Family tree==
As a result of a family tradition for naming descendants after their forebears, members of the family can easily be confused. Hence, what follows is a partial family tree of the historical Alcmaeonid family. Males are in blue, females in red, and those related by marriage in white.

<text>Tennessee Records was a mid-20th century United States–based record label, headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee.

Tennessee mostly released country music, but the label&#x27;s biggest hit was &quot;Down Yonder&quot;, a ragtime piano performance by Del Wood in 1950. Other Tennessee Records performers included Edgar Clayton, Helen Carter, Roy Hall, Snooky Lanson and Mississippi Slim.

Tennessee Records (along with the Republic label) was owned by Alvin 
and Reynolds Bubis. Legendary songwriter and producer Ted Jarrett was head of A&amp;R. The labels were out of business by the mid-1950s when the three men went into partnership to start the Calvert-Champion-Cherokee group of labels. Those labels were defunct by 1960 and the Bubis Brothers got out of the music business. Ted Jarrett continued on with his Valdot, Poncello, Ref-O-Ree and Tee-Jaye labels, remaining active in the music business until his death in 2009. The Tennessee and Republic catalogs are now owned jointly by Bluesland Productions and SnailWorx/S. Cargo Productions.

<doc id="336481" wikidata="Q2266713" url="?curid=336481" title="Fiordland">
<text>Fiordland (, &quot;The Pit of Tattooing&quot;, and also translated as &quot;the Shadowlands&quot;), is a non-administrative geographical region of New Zealand in the south-western corner of the South Island, comprising the western third of Southland. Most of Fiordland is dominated by the steep sides of the snow-capped Southern Alps, deep lakes, and its steep, glacier-carved and now ocean-flooded western valleys. The name &quot;Fiordland&quot; derives from an alternate spelling of the Scandinavian word for steep glacial valleys, &quot;fjord&quot;. The geographic area of Fiordland is dominated by, and roughly coterminous with, Fiordland National Park, New Zealand&#x27;s largest national park.

Due to the often steep terrain and high amount of rainfall supporting dense vegetation, the interior of the Fiordland region is largely inaccessible. As a result, Fiordland was never subjected to notable logging operations, and even attempts at whaling, seal hunting, and mining were on a small scale and short-lived, partly also because of the challenging weather. Today, Fiordland contains by far the greatest extent of unmodified vegetation in New Zealand and significant populations of endemic plants and threatened animals, in some cases the only remaining wild populations.

Fiordland features a number of fiords, which in this area are typically named sounds, reflecting the fact that sometimes fiords are considered to be a type of narrow sound. Of the twelve major fiords on Fiordland&#x27;s west coast, Milford Sound / Piopiotahi is the most famous and the only one accessible by road.
Doubtful Sound / Patea, which is much larger, is also a tourist destination, but is less accessible as it requires both a boat trip over Lake Manapouri and bus transfer over Wilmot Pass.

Also situated within Fiordland are Browne Falls and Sutherland Falls, which rank among the tallest waterfalls in the world, and New Zealand&#x27;s three deepest lakes, Lake Hauroko, Lake Manapouri, and Lake Te Anau. Several other large lakes lie nearby, and Fiordland and the surrounding parts of Southland and Otago Regions are often referred to as the Southern Lakes. Only a handful of Fiordland&#x27;s lakes are accessible by road - Lake Poteriteri is the largest lake in New Zealand with no road access. Many of the region&#x27;s lakes are not even accessible via tramping tracks.

This part of New Zealand, especially to the west of the mountain divide of the Southern Alps, has a very wet climate with annual average of 200 rainy days and annual rainfall varying from in Te Anau to in Milford Sound. The prevailing westerly winds blow moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the mountains, resulting in high amounts of precipitation as the air rises and cools down.

==History==
Fiordland has never had any significant permanent population. Māori knew the area well but only visited seasonally, for hunting, fishing and to collect the precious stone pounamu (New Zealand jade) from Anita Bay at the mouth of Milford Sound / Piopiotahi. In Māori mythology, Fiordland is described as being created by the demigod Tū-te-raki-whānoa, who carved the fiords from rock using his adze. As he moved northwards, he perfected his techniques, and considered the last fiord, Milford Sound / Piopiotahi, his greatest achievement.

The name (&quot;The Pit of Tattooing&quot;) is a reference to the visit of the Tākitimu migratory waka to the area. Traditional histories recall the captain of the waka, Tamatea, lost his tattooing ink in Taiari / Chalky Inlet. After the Tākitimu was wrecked at Te Waewae Bay, the crew decided to walk overland to the north of the South Island. While stopping at Te Anau, Tamatea decided to dig a pit where wood could be burnt to create soot for tattoo ink. Over time, the name grew to refer to the wider Fiordland area.

In 1770, Captain James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to sight Fiordland. Cook returned and anchored in Tamatea / Dusky Sound for five weeks in 1773. The expeditions&#x27; maps and descriptions of the area attracted whalers and seal hunters, but only in the mid-19th century did surveyors and prospectors begin exploring Fiordland&#x27;s interior.

Between 1897 and 1908, two attempts at establishing a mining operation in the remote area of Rakituma / Preservation Inlet failed, and by 1914 the isolated small settlement of Cromartie (or Cromarty) there had been abandoned.

The area was administered as Fiord County from 1876 until it was absorbed into neighbouring Wallace County in 1981. Since 1989, it has formed part of Southland District and of the wider Southland Region.

== Boundaries ==

There are currently varying definitions for the boundary of the Fiordland region. The eastern boundary of Fiordland according to Statistics New Zealand stretches from Sand Hill Point on the western end of Te Waewae Bay more or less straight north, cutting through Lakes Hauroko, Monowai, Manapouri, and the South Fiord of Lake Te Anau, before veering northwest and ending with the southern side of Te Houhou / George Sound. By that definition, the Fiordland region is almost entirely within the Fiordland National Park, except for small pockets near the two southernmost lakes, but the area does not include the three northernmost fiords (Milford Sound / Piopiotahi, Te Hāpua / Sutherland Sound, and Hāwea / Bligh Sound).

The much more widespread definition of &quot;Fiordland&quot; has an eastern boundary that roughly follows that of the Fiordland National Park for all but the northernmost end. This area contains all the fiords as well as the Hollyford Valley and also includes the area around Big Bay, which lies to the north outside of the Fiordland National Park, but still belongs to the Southland Region. Tourism organisations and the Department of Conservation use this definition of the Fiordland region. New Zealanders generally regard the towns of Te Anau and Manapouri as part of the Fiordland region, even though they lie outside of the boundary of the national park.

==Geography==

In geographical terms, the Fiordland region contains the huge mountainous regions west of the line from Te Waewae Bay to Monowai to Te Anau, and includes the valleys of the Eglinton River and Hollyford River / Whakatipu Kā Tuka. The area is almost identical to that of the Fiordland National Park, and is marked by U-shaped valleys and fiords along the coast and steep mountains with foundations of hard rocks like gneiss, schist, granite and diorite, with the softer rock having been carved out by multiple glaciations. Fiordland contains New Zealand&#x27;s oldest known plutonic (igneous) rocks and is dominated by the southernmost extent of the Southern Alps, as the peaks reduce in height from north to south.
The tallest mountain in the Fiordland region is Mount Tūtoko at , one of several peaks over 2,000 metres in the Darran Mountains. Southeast of this area, there are only a handful of peaks reaching 2,000 metres, however due to the rainy weather with cold winters and lack of hot summer temperatures, even these mountains contain glaciers and peaks with permanent snow cover. The southernmost glacier is situated on Caroline Peak, which only reaches , and in the southwest of Fiordland the altitude for permanent snowfields lowers to under .

The past glaciation&#x27;s deep carving out of the landscape has also resulted in fiord-like arms in Lake Manapouri and Lake Te Anau, and on the coast managed to cause several large chunks of the mainland becoming cut off. The largest of these uninhabited offshore islands are Resolution Island and Secretary Island, and are important conservation sites, particularly as sanctuaries for endangered native birds.

===Constituent fiords===

Twelve fiords, some stretching up to inland, and two inlets leading to three more fiords, extend along the coast from Piopiotahi in the north to Rakituma / Preservation Inlet in the south. In general, the fiords become wider from north to south as the height of the mountains decreases. The outlets of the southernmost fiords have a character more akin to inlets, with only the inner arms such as Long Sound resembling fiords.

*Milford Sound / Piopiotahi - the only fiord in the area with road access
*Te Hāpua / Sutherland Sound
*Hāwea / Bligh Sound
*Te Houhou / George Sound - accessible via tramping track
*Taitetimu / Caswell Sound
*Taiporoporo / Charles Sound
*Hinenui / Nancy Sound
*Te Awa-o-Tū / Thompson Sound
*Doubtful Sound / Patea - accessible via tours and tramping track
*Te Rā / Dagg Sound
*Te Puaitaha / Breaksea Sound
*Tamatea / Dusky Sound - accessible via tramping track
*Taiari / Chalky Inlet - leads into Edwardson Sound and Kanáris Sound
*Rakituma / Preservation Inlet - leads into Long Sound

A further sound, Kaikiekie / Bradshaw Sound, is basically an extension of Thompson and Doubtful Sounds after their junction at the eastern end of Secretary Island.

==Ecology==
The area has been categorised as the Fiordland temperate forests ecoregion, having a variety of habitats and, due to its isolation, a high number of endemic plants. Much of Fiordland is heavily forested, except for locations where surface rock exposures are extensive. The natural habitats are almost completely unspoilt. Nothofagus beech trees are dominant in many locations, silver beech &quot;(Nothofagus menziesii)&quot; in the fiords and red beech &quot;(Nothofagus fusca)&quot; in the inland valleys. In the understory there are a wide variety of shrubs and ferns, including crown fern (&quot;Blechnum discolor&quot;), areas of scrubby herbs above the treeline, patches of bog next to mountain streams and finally an area of rimu &quot;(Dacrydium cupressinum)&quot;-dominated dunes in the Waitutu area on the south coast. Despite a latitude in the mid-40s, the treeline is generally below because of the cool summers and the influence of the Southern Ocean on the climate.

The area is home to threatened native bird species, such as the flightless takahē and kiwi, blue duck (whio), and yellowhead (mōhua). The takahē was presumed to have been extinct for 50 years before a small remaining population was discovered in Fiordland&#x27;s Murchison Mountains in 1948. Since then, that area has been managed by the Department of Conservation, trapping stoats and controlling deer, helping takahē numbers in the area to increase to over 200 and remain at that level.

There are also a high number of insects and one indigenous reptile, the Fiordland skink &quot;(Oligosoma acrinasum)&quot;. There are around 300 insect species endemic to the Fiordland region, many of them sizeable, such as weta, large caddis, and giant weevils, and some of them unusual, such as egg-laying worms, alpine cicadas, and brightly coloured alpine moths. There are six species of native sandflies (blackfly, Simuliidae) with one endemic to Fiordland.

Most of the area falls under the protection of the Fiordland National Park, part of the Te Wahipounamu World Heritage Site. Fiordland National Park has an area of 12,600 square kilometres, making it the largest national park in New Zealand and one of the larger parks in the world, containing many tourist attractions, such as Milford Sound, Doubtful Sound and the Milford Track. The main threat to natural habitats is from introduced species, especially red deer, but these are now being hunted out of the area, and furthermore, the park includes a number of small offshore islands which are free from introduced species and are designated Specially Protected Areas.

===Marine reserves===

Ten marine reserves have been established in Fiordland to protect a wide variety of species and habitats.

The original two reserves were established at the request of the New Zealand Federation of Commercial Fishermen in 1993:

* Piopiotahi (Milford Sound) Marine Reserve
* Te Awaatu Channel (The Gut) Marine Reserve

An additional eight reserves were established on the recommendation of Fiordland Marine Guardians in 2005:

* Hawea (Clio Rocks) Marine Reserve
* Kahukura (Gold Arm) Marine Reserve
* Kutu Parera (Gaer Arm) Marine Reserve
* Moana Uta (Wet Jacket Arm) Marine Reserve
* Taipari Roa (Elizabeth Island) Marine Reserve
* Taumoana (Five Fingers Peninsula) Marine Reserve
* Te Hapua (Sutherland Sound) Marine Reserve
* Te Tapuwae o Hua (Long Sound) Marine Reserve

== Demographics and economy ==

The Fiordland statistical area covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. Almost the entire population lives at Milford Sound (village).
Fiordland had a population of 111 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 12 people (−9.8%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 33 people (−22.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 3 households, comprising 54 males and 60 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.9 males per female. The median age was 28.2 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 3 people (2.7%) aged under 15 years, 69 (62.2%) aged 15 to 29, 39 (35.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 3 (2.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 73.0% European/Pākehā, 8.1% Māori, 24.3% Asian, and 2.7% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 62.2, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 67.6% had no religion, 21.6% were Christian, 2.7% were Muslim and 5.4% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 27 (25.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 9 (8.3%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $34,000, compared with $31,800 nationally. 3 people (2.8%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 102 (94.4%) people were employed full-time, and 3 (2.8%) were part-time.

Apart from the areas around the townships of Te Anau and Manapouri, which are not included in the Fiordland statistical area, the Fiordland region has never had more than a few human inhabitants and is the least-populated area of the South Island, with no villages or towns, and many areas almost inaccessible except by boat or air. The nearest city is Invercargill, about east of the southern end of Fiordland. The only major road in Fiordland is State Highway 94, also referred to as Milford Road, connecting Te Anau with Milford Sound.

Blanket Bay Hotel, not an actual hotel, may be the westernmost inhabited locality of New Zealand. The fishermen&#x27;s refuelling and supply depot with a small jetty and helipad is located on a small island at the head of Doubtful Sound / Patea.

Except for electricity generation (at the Manapouri Power Station and a smaller hydroelectric power station at Lake Monowai) and some agriculture, tourism is the only other major economic factor in the region. Visitor spending was NZ$92 million in 2003, and 1,017 people were employed full-time in the tourism industry, with an additional 1,900 people considered to be employed in tourism industry support services. Most tourists visit Milford Sound / Piopiotahi, though walking in the more accessible eastern parts of the alps is a popular activity. Nonetheless, the remoteness of the region limits even tourism, and after short visits to the major sites, most tourists return to other areas, such as Queenstown or Invercargill.

<text>The Association of Vineyard Churches, also known as the Vineyard Movement, is an international neocharismatic evangelical Christian association of churches.

The Vineyard Movement is rooted in the charismatic renewal and historic evangelicalism. Instead of the mainstream charismatic label, however, the movement has preferred the term &quot;Empowered Evangelicals&quot; (a term coined by Rich Nathan and Ken Wilson in their book of the same name) to reflect their roots in traditional evangelicalism as opposed to classical Pentecostalism. Members also sometimes describe themselves as the &quot;radical middle&quot; between evangelicals and Pentecostals, which is a reference to the book &quot;The Quest for the Radical Middle,&quot; a historical survey of the Vineyard by Bill Jackson.

It has been associated with the &quot;Signs and Wonders&quot; movement, the Toronto blessing, the Kansas City Prophets and a particular style of Christian worship music.

The Vineyard operates a publishing house, Vineyard International Publishing.

==History==
The Vineyard has its origins in the founding of a Calvary Chapel church by Kenn Gulliksen and his wife Joanie, members of Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa, in 1974, in Los Angeles in the United States. In early 1975, thirteen groups met at the Beverly Hills Women&#x27;s club. These Bible studies, and others like them, were attended by many popular actors/actresses and musicians including Bob Dylan. Gulliksen&#x27;s Vineyard had spun off sister churches.

In 1977, John Wimber, an evangelical pastor and teacher on church growth, founded a Calvary Chapel in Yorba Linda, California. Wimber&#x27;s teaching on healing and the ministry of the Holy Spirit led to conflict. In a meeting with Calvary Chapel leaders, it was suggested that Wimber&#x27;s church stop using the Calvary name and affiliate with Gulliksen&#x27;s Vineyard movement. In 1982, Wimber&#x27;s church changed its name to the Anaheim Vineyard Christian Fellowship. Gulliksen turned over the churches under his oversight to Wimber, beginning his leadership of the Vineyard movement. Evangelist Lonnie Frisbee credits Gulliksen as founder of the Vineyard movement. In 1982, 8 churches founded the Association of Vineyard Churches.

Beginning in 1988, Wimber established relationships with leaders known for their prophetic ministry, such as Paul Cain, Bob Jones, and Mike Bickle who pastored Kansas City Fellowship, an independent church which would come under the Vineyard banner as Metro Vineyard (see Kansas City Prophets). For a time, these men had considerable influence on Wimber and the Vineyard—according to Jackson, Wimber&#x27;s son was delivered from drug addiction through a prophetic word from Jones. However, there were those in the Vineyard who were skeptical, and Wimber himself became disillusioned over the restorationist teaching and failed prophecies of these men. Around 1991, Wimber began to distance himself from the prophetic movement, leading the Vineyard back to a church-planting direction, while Bickle&#x27;s church withdrew and dropped the Vineyard label.

The Vineyard Movement suffered a visible leadership vacuum after Wimber&#x27;s death on November 16, 1997. However, Todd Hunter, who served as National Coordinator since February 1994 and as acting Director of the Vineyard at the time of Wimber&#x27;s death, became the National Director in January 1998 and served in that capacity until he resigned in May 2000. After Hunter&#x27;s resignation, the National Board of Directors named Bert Waggoner of Sugar Land, Texas, as the new National Director. As of 2007, the Association of Vineyard Churches includes over 2400 churches around the world, and this number continues to grow due to a strong priority placed on church-planting within the Vineyard mission. In October, 2011, Phil Strout was selected by the National Board of Directors to succeed Waggoner as National Director in January 2013. He served until October, 2021 when Jay Pathak was installed as the National Director.

==Statistics==
According to a census published by the association in 2022, it had 2,400 churches in 95 countries. The 2010 US Religious Census showed over 200,000 members in the United States.

==Beliefs and practices==
===Doctrinal statements===
For most of the early life of the Vineyard Movement, Vineyard churches had no official statement of faith. This is not to be interpreted as an absence of a common belief structure; rather, the primary reasons for the absence of such a declaration were:

* the demonstrative teaching of John Wimber, who effectively set the tone and doctrinal beliefs of the movement
* a desire to reflect the &quot;low-key,&quot; &quot;low-pressure&quot; environment of the church that encouraged people to &quot;come as you are&quot;
* specifically, de-emphasizing any atmosphere or actions that could be considered overtly dogmatic.

According to text in the official Vineyard Statement of Faith released in 1994, an effort to create a common Statement of Faith had been underway since 1983, but took 10+ years to complete because: &quot;On one hand, we felt obliged to set forth our biblical and historically orthodox beliefs; on the other hand, we wanted to describe the values and priorities that make the Vineyard unique within the context of Evangelicalism.&quot;

===LGBTQ+ position===
In a 2020 letter to local church leaders, Vineyard Canada expressed its position that having a non-heterosexual orientation is not itself sinful, however the church does not allow the officiating of same sex marriages or licensing people in same sex marriages for pastoral ministry. This letter also distinguished gender identity from sexual orientation as its own theology and policy matter that requires further consideration.

==Branches==

===United States===
The national headquarters of Vineyard USA is currently located in Stafford, Texas. Vineyard USA is divided into eight regions, and each region has clusters of churches grouped together by location, facilitated by an Area Pastoral Care Leader (APCL). The APCL&#x27;s work together with the Regional Overseer (RO) to provide leadership and encouragement to the region. The central governing body of the Vineyard in the U.S. is known as the Executive Team, and includes the National Director. Currently, the President and National Director is Jay Pathak. All major strategic decisions, including theological and doctrinal statements, are made by the National Board. In 2018, Vineyard USA is estimated to have approximately 200,000 members in 600 churches.

In the United States, Vineyard is nondenominational and evangelical.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
===Denmark===
As of December 2022, there are seven Vineyard churches in Denmark. Those are located in Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, Roskilde, Aalborg, Rønne (Bornholm), and Helsingør.

==Vineyard Worship==

Vineyard Worship is a record label created and used by the Association of Vineyard Churches. The organization uses it to release worship albums. A UK branch of the record label exists, called Vineyard Records. Its musicians include Samuel Lane, Brenton Brown, Brian Doerksen, David Ruis, Cindy Rethmeier, Scott Underwood, Andy Park, Kevin Prosch, Anabeth Morgan, Tim Brown, Joshua Miller, Tina Colón Williams, Kyle Howard, Casey Corum, Ryan Delmore, Darren and Jessie Clarke, Nigel Briggs, Nigel Hemming, Jeremy Riddle, Kathryn Scott, and many others.

===History===
Vineyard Music was developed by the Vineyard church in 1985. The church began to write its own worship songs, so John Wimber founded Mercy Records. This later became Vineyard Worship.

==Controversies==

=== Healing on the Streets ===
A leader within the Causeway Coast Vineyard, in Northern Ireland, Mark Marx, started a branch of the church called &#x27;Healing on the Streets&#x27;. This organisation made promises to cure medical conditions through faith healing, first on the streets of Coleraine and then training other churches. These claims - including the claim they could heal cancer - have been challenged by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) who concluded that the claims were &#x27;misleading&#x27;. This led to media stories around the Bath group, and the Nottingham group.

The Evangelical Alliance policy arm is led by Peter Lynas, who is also Chair of the Causeway Coast Vineyard board. Evangelical Alliance supported Mark Marx organisations and believes the regulations should not apply to the Healing on the Streets activities.

Mark Marx and Causeway Coast Vineyard founder Alan Scott have now moved together to Dwelling Place, California.

=== Causeway Coast Vineyard ===
The founder and trustees of the Causeway Coast Vineyard in Northern Ireland have been the subject of a number of internal and external investigations. Founder Alan Scott has been accused of having a messiah complex, and in 2023 several of his family members had to resign from leadership positions in the church following historic allegations of spiritual abuse. 

The church&#x27;s founders, Alan and Kathryn Scott, had left and moved to Anaheim Vineyard, California, in 2018. Before Alan and Kathryn left, Kathryn&#x27;s sister, Janet Young, along with her husband, Neil Young, were made joint senior pastors. 

A prominent Theologian, Dr. Luke Martin, attended the church as a teenager. He has criticised Alan publicly and pointed out that there was no open recruitment between Alan and Kathryn Scott leaving Northern Ireland, and the appointment of their family members Neil and Janet Young. Dr. Martin also noted that neither Neil and Janet had any theological qualifications. 

After Alan and Kathryn&#x27;s departure, reports started to emerge that Alan had been an abusive leader in Northern Ireland. The trustees of the church eventually commissioned an independent report. In this, respondents alleged that Alan Scott had appeared ‘all knowing’ and that he had told them God would tell him if anybody spoke about him, even in their own homes, and that he knew people&#x27;s sin by looking at them. 

Neil and Janet Young resigned in 2023 as they could not support the findings of the trustee&#x27;s independent report against their family members.

At the same time, in California, Anaheim Vineyard took Alan to court for fraud due to his decision to take the Anaheim church and its $62 million worth of assets out of the Vineyard movement. The Vineyard movement alleged that Alan had promised not to do this during the recruitment process, and they alleged he had been fraudulent in this promise.

Alan renamed the now independent Anaheim church &#x27;Dwelling Place&#x27;, where he remains as pastor. Similar concerns have continued at Dwelling Place under Scott, and in 2024 their worship leader was prohibited from attending a Christian conference following allegations of spiritual abuse while under Alan Scott&#x27;s leadership at Dwelling Place.

In September 2024, the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland stepped in and have decided to run another investigation into the Causeway Coast Vineyard. The focus of this new probe is around the church&#x27;s governance arrangements and its response to the allegations made against Alan and Kathryn Scott. 

Like the senior leadership of the church, the trustee board is dominated by one family - the Lynas family - and their spouses. The Lynas family are one the wealthiest in the area, who own a major food distribution operation. The Chairperson, Peter Lynas, is also works for Evangelical Alliance, a controversial lobby group who have been criticised for their conservative stance on a range of issues., 

=== The Toronto Blessing ===

In January 1994, the Toronto Airport Vineyard Church, a member of the association, experienced an outbreak of physical manifestations (such as laughter, weeping, and shaking) that it claimed were the work of the Holy Spirit. These events continued for many months and became known as the &quot;Toronto Blessing&quot;. Large numbers of Christians from numerous countries visited the church to experience the phenomena and take them back to their home congregations. The &quot;blessing&quot; received considerable publicity and proved highly controversial. Some Christian leaders disputed the church&#x27;s assertion that the manifestations were divine in origin. A leading critic was Hank Hanegraaff who wrote a book, &quot;Counterfeit Revival&quot;, which charged the church with promoting heresy. However, other Christian leaders endorsed the &quot;blessing&quot; as a genuine work of God. In December 1995, the Toronto church was removed from membership in the Association of Vineyard Churches for placing excessive emphasis on the manifestations and losing focus on the Bible. The church then changed its name to Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship, and later to Catch The Fire Toronto.

=== The Network ===
The Network is an international group of churches founded by Steve Morgan which broke away from the Vineyard Association in 2006. The Network&#x27;s methods and practices have been criticized for being spiritually abusive, controlling, manipulative, and misogynistic. Steve Morgan&#x27;s qualifications as a pastor have also been questioned because of his arrest in 1987 for allegedly committing aggravated criminal sodomy against a teenager in November, 1986. Former Vineyard officials who had contact with Steve Morgan during the time of his ordination have denied knowledge of Steve Morgan&#x27;s arrest.

Steve Morgan had originally planted Vineyard Community Church of Carbondale, Illinois in 1995 after hearing John Wimber speak at a conference. Vineyard Community Church of Carbondale, Illinois, changed its name to Vine Church and left the Vineyard denomination in 2006, taking several midwest Vineyard churches with it to form an independent church planting network, which they called a &quot;No Name, No Account Network.&quot; Eventually, this name became shortened to &quot;The Network.&quot;

<text>Polly Adelaide Hendricks Hazelwood (February 22, 1920 – October 3, 1989), known professionally as Del Wood, was an American pianist.

==Early life==
Hendricks was born in Nashville, Tennessee. A lifetime resident of Nashville, she was surrounded by the influences of early country music and the remaining vestiges of ragtime, particularly through the guitar pickers. She took up piano at age five, and played ragtime, gospel, and country music. Despite her parents&#x27; best efforts to encourage a direction towards classical music, the environment in Nashville, plus the early local programming on radio, convinced her that she wanted to play piano in the honky-tonk style. Her dream goal was the Grand Ole Opry, something she would realize in her early 30s.

==Career==
Shortening her married name (Adelaide Hazelwood) to something easier to remember, Wood began playing in bands and honky-tonk joints in her 20s. After a decade of building repertoire and reputation, she spent some time as a staff pianist at WLBJ in Bowling Green, Kentucky. It was there that she was heard playing &quot;Down Yonder&quot; among other pieces, which led to a gig with a recording group called Hugh &quot;Baby&quot; Jarrett and his Dixieliners. This led to the first of many recording sessions for the Tennessee Records label starting in 1951. &quot;Down Yonder&quot; soon became a national hit in both the country and pop categories in &quot;Billboard&quot; record charts, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. She is probably the first female country solo instrumentalist to sell a million copies of a record.

This success was turned into appearances on the Grand Ole Opry starting in 1952, which led to an eventual full-time gig there in 1953, fulfilling her long-time dream. Two years later her fame culminated with a contract from RCA Victor Records, where she would make some of the first country/honky-tonk stereo recordings in the late 1950s. While nothing else that she put out had the same success as &quot;Down Yonder&quot;, her offerings over the next decade were frequent and consistent. Wood gained the title, Queen of the Ragtime Pianists, sometimes shared with junior fellow plunker Jo Ann Castle. She was also divorced from her stage-namesake, Carson Hazelwood, during this period, but not before adopting a son they named Wesley.

In 1984, Del Wood appeared in the movie &quot;Rhinestone&quot;, starring Dolly Parton and Sylvester Stallone as the pianist in the Wild Possums Band.

=== Death ===
During the Vietnam War, Wood was part of one of the Grand Ole Opry package tours that entertained troops overseas in 1968. Her recordings after the late 1960s were infrequent at best, but her appearances on the Opry continued until just before her death from a stroke on October 3, 1989, at the age of 69.

She was interred in the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville.

<text>The Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph () is a historic Catholic church in Downtown San Jose that serves as the cathedral for the Diocese of San José in California, with the distinction of minor basilica.

The basilica is named for Saint Joseph, patron saint of the Catholic Church and the namesake of San Jose, California.

==History==
The original St. Joseph&#x27;s Church was called San Jose de Guadalupe built on the site of the current basilica in 1803, and was the first non-mission parish built in California for the benefit of Spanish settlers instead of the Mission Indians (Ohlone). The Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe was connected with Mission Santa Clara by The Alameda which was part of the historic El Camino Real. The original adobe structure was damaged by earthquakes in 1818 and 1822.

In 1835, prominent Californio businessman Antonio Suñol donated the land at the northeast corner of the Plaza del Pueblo (modern Plaza de César Chávez) for the construction of a new, larger adobe church. Suñol, alongside his brother-in-law Antonio María Pico (who served as Alcalde of San José at the time), oversaw the construction of the church for the next eight years until its completion and consecration in 1846. In 1842, Suñol petitioned Francisco García Diego y Moreno, the Bishop of the Californias, for proper religious vestments and relics for the church. The second church was severely damaged by the 1868 Hayward earthquake.

Work on the third church began in 1869. The third church was destroyed by fire in 1875, and a temporary fourth church was built a few blocks away while the fifth and current church was being constructed. The fifth church was dedicated by Joseph Alemany, Archbishop of San Francisco, in 1877 while construction continued. The current portico was completed in 1884, and the large dome was finished in 1885.

In 1981, a major renovation project was begun at the church, which was to become the cathedral for the new Roman Catholic Bishop of San Jose. In 1985, the church was elevated to a cathedral, pending completion of the restoration in 1990. It replaced Saint Patrick Proto-Cathedral Parish, located a few blocks away, as the cathedral of the diocese. The cathedral was made a minor basilica by Pope John Paul II in 1997.

The Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph is listed as a California Historical Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Architecture==

===Plaques at entrance===
Just inside the entrance to the cathedral are two plaques that read:
&lt;br&gt;
===Joseph bible quotes===
The top of the walls of the inside of the cathedral include quotes from the Vulgate about Joseph:
* - ANGELVS DOMINI APPARVIT IN SOMNIS JOSEPH NOLI TIMERE ACCIPERE MARIAM CONIVGEM TVAM
* - EXSVRGENS JOSEPH A SOMNO FECIT SICVT PRÆCEPIT ET ANGELVS DOMINI ET ACCEPIT CONIVGEN SVAM
* - FVTVRVM EST VT HERODES QVÆRAT PVERVM AD PEDENDVM ET MATREM EIVS NOCTE ET SECESSIT IN ÆGYPTVM
* - DIXIT MATER EIVS ECCE PATER TVVS ET EGO DOLENTES QVÆREBVS TE
* - DESCENDIT CVM EIS ET VENIT NAZARET ET ERAT SVBDITVS ILLIS
* - ET JESVS PVTABATVR FILIVS JOSEPH

<doc id="336493" wikidata="Q5565779" url="?curid=336493" title="Give Us a Clue">
<text>Give Us a Clue is a British televised game show version of charades which was broadcast on ITV from 1979 to 1992. The original host was Michael Aspel from 1979 to 1984, followed by Michael Parkinson from 1984 to 1992. The show featured two teams, one captained by Lionel Blair and the other by Una Stubbs. Later editions of the programme had Liza Goddard as captain of the women&#x27;s team. Norman Vaughan stood in for Blair for four episodes in the second series and Joyce Blair stood in for Stubbs for the 1981 Royal Wedding special.

Originally, each team consisted of the captain, two fellow celebrities and one non-celebrity, but the non-celebrity participants were soon dropped, another celebrity being added in their place. In the second episode of Series 2 (broadcast on 5 November 1979), the non-celebrity contestant, London fashion designer Leslie Dean, read the wrong side of the card handed to him and as a result started miming his own name rather than the specified film. In his autobiography, Lionel Blair stated that it was this incident that led to the dropping of non-celebrity participants.

A revived version was broadcast by BBC One in 1997 over 30 episodes, hosted by Tim Clark. Teams were captained by Christopher Blake and Julie Peasgood and the show introduced a lateral thinking puzzle (which the host could &quot;give clues to&quot;). &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot; returned for a special Comic Relief episode in March 2011 with Sara Cox, Christopher Biggins, Lionel Blair, Una Stubbs, Holly Walsh, Jenni Falconer and David Walliams.

==Format==
The game is based on charades, a party game where players used mime rather than speaking to demonstrate a name, phrase, book, play, film or TV programme. Each player was given roughly two minutes to act out their given subject in front of his/her team, and if the others were unsuccessful in guessing correctly, the opposing team would have a chance to answer for a bonus point.

==Episode list==
The coloured backgrounds denote the result of each of the shows:
: – indicates Una&#x27;s team won
: – indicates Lionel&#x27;s team won
: – indicates the game ended in a draw

The first six series of &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot; have been released on DVD by Network, but only 98 out of the first 105 episodes were included. The seven episodes that are not in the collection had appearances of three celebrities with sexual abuse offences that were investigated in Operation Yewtree.

<doc id="336499" wikidata="Q3513423" url="?curid=336499" title="The Lords of Discipline">
<text>The Lords of Discipline is a 1980 novel by Pat Conroy that was later adapted in a 1983 film of the same name.

The story centers on Will McLean, who is in his fourth year at the fictional Carolina Military Institute in Charleston, South Carolina. Will&#x27;s experiences are heavily based on Pat Conroy’s own experiences at The Citadel, a real military college in Charleston. 

The story is narrated in first person by Will, who attends the Institute between 1963 and 1967. Will recounts his years at the Institute, especially focusing on the school&#x27;s brutal culture of hazing and abuse. 

After discovering a secret society that drives cadets deemed unworthy of graduating from the Institute to drop out by any means necessary, Will learns that graduation and lives are on the line.

== Background ==
Although Conroy drew on his experiences as a cadet at The Citadel, and also references traditions and locations of both Norwich University and Virginia Military Institute (VMI), he has said that the story is fiction and not based on his life or that of any other graduate of a military academy. Citadel alumni were critical of the novel, considering it a thinly-veiled and unflattering account of the school, and Conroy was ostracized by his alma mater and effectively banned from campus for over 20 years after its publication. In 2000, The Citadel invited Conroy back to campus to receive an honorary doctorate, and again the next year as commencement speaker.

==Plot==
An aged Will McLean, returning to the Carolina Military Institute in Charleston, South Carolina, an unknown number of years after his graduation, tells the story of his life at the Institute. 

In 1966, Will was an English major on a basketball scholarship, in his fourth and final year at the Institute. Will was not interested in a military career. He only attended the school on account of his father, also an alumnus. Will is fulfilling a deathbed promise he made to his father that he would graduate from CMI and wear the honored CMI ring. Will is a sarcastic young man who seldom agrees with the rigidity of CMI, but is generally well-liked and his professors and peers recognize him for his integrity and fairness. Will struggles to fit into the strict military environment, but finds solace in his three roommates, who have become his closest friends: Tradd St. Croix, the son of an upper-class Charlestonian family, and two brawny Italian-American boys from the North: Dante &quot;Pig&quot; Pignetti and Mark Santoro. They all look forward to graduation, although Will&#x27;s friends will head off to fight in the Vietnam War, which Will is personally against. However, Will does have some pride in the Institute, representing it in basketball. Though anti-war, he also despises the discrimination the Institute faces from civilian students of other colleges due to its military association, which he sees at away games. For example, when Will plays a game against the Virginia Military Institute, which is considered their biggest rival game, he notes that VMI was the only team all season that did not harass him and his teammates. 

Retired US Army Colonel Thomas &quot;The Bear&quot; Berrineau, the Commandant of Cadets, asks Will to look out for the Institute&#x27;s first black cadet, Tom Pearce. The Bear knows that Will is the only cadet unopposed to racial integration. Will also begins a secret relationship with Annie Kate Gervais, a girl from an upper-class Charlestonian family who has become pregnant from a boy who refused to marry her. Will knows their relationship has no future either, because Will is Irish-American, Catholic, and not wealthy. Will attempts to aid a struggling freshman, Poteete, who has been targeted by numerous upperclassmen. Shamed by his inability to cope with the harshness of the Institute&#x27;s freshman system, Poteete hangs himself, leaving behind his ominous claim of a &quot;house where they take freshmen&quot; to be tormented outside the oversight of the Commandant&#x27;s office.

In an extended flashback, Will describes his own plebe year three years earlier. He learned that the only way to survive is to bond closely with the other members of his class against the cadre. Having entered the college on a basketball scholarship, Will is also protected by other members of the basketball team who don&#x27;t want to see Will physically harmed and, at one point, rescue him from a particularly brutal hazing incident. Many of Will&#x27;s classmates are not so lucky, and they resign from the school due to the unrelenting hazing. 

One recruit swiftly rises to prominence: Bobby Bentley, who has a problem with urinating on himself due to the stress of hazing but is otherwise in excellent shape. Bentley refuses to quit on himself or his classmates, and he endures all the upperclassmen&#x27;s torment. Conventional hazing methods fail to break Bentley, and his classmates gradually rally around him, making Will&#x27;s cadre the subject of ridicule of the entire corps of cadets. One evening, Bentley is taken off campus by unknown individuals. The next day, he withdraws from the Institute for unknown reasons. A first classman claims that the Ten, a secret society of cadets. Its members are handpicked for embodying the greatest virtues of the Institute. The Ten ensures certain cadets, deemed unacceptable to &quot;wear the ring&quot; (that is, to be a graduate of the Institute, denoted by wearing of a class ring), are run out by any means necessary. Once it became clear the R Company cadre had failed to run Bentley out of the school, the Ten had decided to act. Near the end of the year, Will&#x27;s freshman class is recognized as cadets, and the hazing ends. Will vows to himself that he will never participate in tormenting future generations of plebes, seeing no value in organized cruelty.

Back in Will&#x27;s senior year, he hears new rumors of the Ten. Aided in his investigation by a mentor, a professor in the history department, Will discovers that the Ten is a real group and they are trying to run Pearce out to keep the Institute all white. Will and the other seniors receive their class rings in a solemn ceremony, and Will wins the final basketball game of his career in quadruple overtime against the Virginia Military Institute.

Annie Kate&#x27;s baby is stillborn, and she rejects Will, wanting to forget all about the time she spent pregnant. Will looks further into the Ten and reconnects with Bobby Bentley. Bentley reveals that, during their plebe year, he was spirited away to a house, and was threatened, tortured, and finally agreed to quit when The Ten prepared to burn him alive. Bentley says his ultimate decision to quit was not due to the torture, but the realization he no longer wished to be associated with any organization that would have a group like the Ten. Bentley recalls one member of the Ten, whom they piece together as a high-ranking cadet from their plebe year. Will, Mark, and Pig learn this Ten member is now a student at a nearby law school. They abduct and interrogate him on a secluded railroad track until he reveals the location of the house, which is a plantation house owned by General Bentley Durrell, the superintendent of the Institute. 

When Pearce is kidnapped by the Ten, Will goes to the house and interrupts the torture of Pearce. Pig and Mark arrive to rescue Will as the Ten pursue him, but the Ten now know of the few trying to move against them. Pearce is intimidated into silence. The Ten begin a campaign to have Mark, Pig and Will expelled from school. Pig is caught on an honor code violation due to the Ten and loses the honor court case, despite Will, Tradd and Mark each speaking in his defense. After Pig is expelled, he throws himself in front of a train, killing himself. Will and Mark soon after are issued demerits for a wide range of offenses, real and fabricated. Just as they are about to be dismissed, Will discovers that Tradd&#x27;s father was a member of The Ten. He and Mark read his journals and discover the names of all current and former members. They also realize Tradd is the father of Annie Kate&#x27;s baby, is a member of the Ten in their class, and was thus informing on his roommates from the start. Will confronts Tradd and ends their friendship.

Facing expulsion for excess demerits, Will confronts General Durrell and demands that he and Mark be allowed to graduate. Durrell refuses, citing their extensive list of infractions and the fact that the Institute graduate they kidnapped has contacted him and wants to press charges. The Bear then enters the General&#x27;s office, informing him that multiple cadets who were run out of the Institute are willing to attest in court to the Ten&#x27;s existence and activities. General Durrell relents when also faced with the threat of exposure to the press, as evidenced by Mark seen outside with letters containing the information ready to be mailed. Will and Mark are allowed to graduate, but General Durrell&#x27;s decision to fire Colonel Berrineau as Commandant stands. The General and the Ten survive with their power intact, but forever shaken, as for the first time an opponent has stood against them and won.

Shortly before graduation, Will receives a letter from Annie Kate, thanking him for standing by her and saying he will make a good husband to whatever woman he finds. Reflecting on his graduation, Will notes that eight of his fellow cadets will eventually be killed in action in the Vietnam War, Mark among them. Will also reveals that the Ten member and class &quot;golden boy&quot; John Alexander would eventually fade into obscurity, last seen working as an ROTC instructor at a small university, while Mark Santoro tops the entire class in awards for valor. As Will receives his diploma from the Institute, General Durrell coldly orders him not to disgrace the ring, but Will simply replies with &quot;Dante Pignetti&quot;, honoring his former roommate and showing his contempt for the General by breaking the school&#x27;s taboo of ever speaking the name of an expelled cadet. The Bear appears at their graduation to congratulate Will. Disgusted at seeing General Durrell&#x27;s signature on his diploma, Will asks Colonel Berrineau to sign it as Will wants the name of a man he can respect on the diploma. The Bear hands the diploma back without signing it, remarking, &quot;There already is, Bubba&quot;, pointing to Will&#x27;s name.

== Characters ==

*Will McLean – The protagonist and narrator, who is heavily based on Pat Conroy in his college years. Will is independent, irreverent and sarcastic, and, unlike the rest of his classmates, does not wish to join the military after graduation. He is, however, generally well-liked on campus for being fair, kind, and with a firm sense of integrity. Unlike most of his classmates, Will never advances beyond the rank of cadet private. The story is told retrospectively some time after his graduation.
*Tradd St. Croix – Will&#x27;s roommate and friend, from a very rich and respected old Charlestonian family. Will was close to him and his parents, Abigail and Commerce St. Croix, but their friendship ends after Will discovers he was a member of The Ten.
*Dante &quot;Pig&quot; Pignetti – Will&#x27;s roommate and friend, and a brawny Italian-American from Philadelphia. He comes from a poor family, is prone to violence and is extremely protective of his friends and his fiancée Theresa. He is run out of the Institute by the Ten after they catch him on an honor code violation, driving him to suicide.
*Mark Santoro – Will&#x27;s roommate and friend, another Italian-American from Philadelphia who is loyal to Will to the end. He dies fighting in Vietnam some time after graduation, the most decorated Carolina Military Institute graduate of the Vietnam War.
*Tom Pearce – The first black student to attend the Institute, whom Will is assigned to watch over and ensure he fairly makes it through his plebe year. Pearce does survive his first year at the Institute, but is intimidated into silence by The Ten and ultimately cuts ties with Will.
*Annie Kate Gervais – A young pregnant woman from an upper-class Charlestonian family that has fallen on hard times whom Will befriends and later falls in love with. Annie Kate struggles with loneliness due to the fact that she must hide her pregnancy after her baby&#x27;s father refuses to marry her. Annie Kate ends her relationship with Will after her baby is stillborn. She moves to California to attend college and asks Will to not to contact her, but not before confirming to Will that Tradd was the child&#x27;s father.
*General Bentley Durrell – President of the Carolina Military Institute, highly-decorated retired U.S. Army general renowned for his service in World War II, Institute graduate and member of The Ten. Will is initially among many in the Corps of Cadets who admire General Durrell, but swiftly reverses his opinion as he learns General Durrell has been fully aware of The Ten&#x27;s activities and actively aiding their efforts.
*Bobby Bentley – Will&#x27;s fellow classmate who is targeted by upperclassmen due to his wetting himself during his freshman year. His perseverance in the face the brutal hazing he experiences inspires Will&#x27;s class to come together, but he is ultimately driven out by The Ten.
*Colonel &quot;The Bear&quot; Berrineau – The Commandant of the Cadets in charge of maintaining discipline and helping students at the Institute. Greatly feared and respected in the Corps of Cadets, &quot;The Bear&quot; has a gruff and ferocious exterior that hides his deeply-compassionate nature. Among cadets, an unspoken rule exists that if one needs help and has nowhere else to turn, &quot;The Bear&quot; will assist in any way he can. The character was based on Lieutenant Colonel Thomas &quot;The Boo&quot; Courvoisie, an iconic former Assistant Commandant at The Citadel who was also the subject of Conroy&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Boo&quot;.
*John Alexander- Favored &quot;golden boy&quot; of the Class of 1967 and member of The Ten, Alexander commands 4th Battalion in the Corps of Cadets and has been a personal enemy of Will&#x27;s since their fourth-classman year. Alexander is outwardly a model &quot;Institute man,&quot; flawlessly adhering to every military regulation and rising high in cadet rank, but fades into obscurity later in his life.
*Colonel Edward T. Reynolds: The impassioned, outrageous, and obese professor of History who emerges as one of Will&#x27;s mentors at the Institute after an exchange of insults in Will&#x27;s fourth classman year. Named &quot;Edward the Great&quot; by cadets for his grandiose and egotistical style of lecturing, he quietly aids Will&#x27;s efforts to find whether The Ten exists.
*John &quot;Bucky&quot; Poteete – A freshman mentored by Will who struggles with the brutal hazing at the Institute. He suicides after being kidnapped and tortured by The Ten, driving Will into a depression.

== Reception ==
The novel received generally positive reviews.

==Film adaptation==

The novel was adapted for the screenplay of a 1983 film of the same name, starring David Keith as Will McLean and Robert Prosky as Colonel &quot;The Bear&quot; Berrineau. The film version took place entirely in McLean&#x27;s senior year, when he was asked to protect Pearce. Several plot points were changed for the film:

* In the novel, Poteete successfully kills himself by hanging, having earlier being unsuccessful in killing himself jumping off a roof (having been thwarted by Mark and Will). In the film, he is an outcast but not suicidal. He is seen saying he will be accepted if he performs the dangerous stunt of jumping from one rooftop to another. In his attempt to do so, Poteete misses and falls.
* McLean was assigned the duty of protecting Pearce because of McLean&#x27;s perceived liberalism. In the film, McLean was assigned the duty to repay The Bear for protecting him during his own plebe year.
* After his &quot;walk of shame&quot;, Pignetti suicides by walking into the path of a speeding train. In the film, he simply gets into a taxicab called for him and is never seen again, and as part of Will&#x27;s deal with Durrell, Pignetti is to be reinstated at the Institute and allowed to complete his degree.
* Tradd&#x27;s motivation for joining The Ten is not as well explained in the film, and the novel&#x27;s entire &quot;Honey Prince&quot; subplot of Tradd&#x27;s effeminate nature is never depicted. In both the book and film, Tradd admits it was his father also being a member, ensuring him legacy status, and was enthralled with membership in The Ten being the Institute&#x27;s highest honor. Tradd in the film expresses some remorse over The Ten&#x27;s misdeeds. The film makes a brief aside to Tradd&#x27;s lack of manliness, with Commerce commending how Will looks good in uniform whereas Tradd does not seem soldierly &quot;even if he was wearing a suit of armor&quot;.
* The entire plotline concerning McLean and Annie Kate Gervais, the mother of his roommate Tradd St Croix&#x27;s illegitimate—and ultimately stillborn—child, is not in the film.
* In the film, Pearce apologizes for turning his back on McLean, explaining that he did it because of survival, and if he did not make it, &quot;the next nigger has my record around his neck like a rock&quot;. In the novel, McLean has no further contact with Pearce after that.
* The novel speaks of the death of General Durrell&#x27;s son, who Will remembered as an obscure cadet who could not escape his father&#x27;s shadow. The notification of this death causes the cadets to go to General Durell&#x27;s house, where his wife requests the cadets in bright anger to &quot;kill Vietcong&quot;. In the film, the ring ceremony is interrupted with General Durrell reading a letter of his son being killed in action. Will and the others then hold a candlelight vigil before Mr. and Mrs. Durrell singing Dixie.

<text>Michael Terence Aspel (born 12 January 1933) is an English retired television presenter and newsreader. He hosted programmes such as &quot;Crackerjack!&quot;, &quot;Ask Aspel&quot;, &quot;Aspel &amp; Company&quot;, &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot;, &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, &quot;Strange but True?&quot; and &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;.

==Early life==
Aspel was born on 12 January 1933 in Battersea in London. During the Second World War, he was evacuated from the area and spent nearly five years in Chard, Somerset. He attended Emanuel School after passing his eleven-plus in 1944 and served as a conscript during his national service, in the ranks of the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, from 1951 to 1953.

==Career==
Aspel worked as a drainpipe-layer and gardener and sold advertising space for the &quot;Western Mail&quot; newspaper in Cardiff. He worked as a teaboy at William Collins publishers in London and then entered National Service. He took up a job at the David Morgan department store in Cardiff until 1955, before working as newsreader for the BBC in Cardiff in 1957. He also acted in Cardiff, in a BBC Children&#x27;s Hour serial &quot;Counterspy&quot;, produced by BBC Wales and written by and starring John Darran. Aspel played &quot;Rocky&quot; Mountain, a Canadian. By the early sixties, he had become one of four regular newsreaders on BBC national television, along with Richard Baker, Robert Dougall and Corbet Woodall.

At the BBC, Aspel began presenting a number of other programmes such as the series &quot;Come Dancing&quot;, &quot;Crackerjack!&quot; and &quot;Ask Aspel&quot;, as well as the Miss World beauty contest which he covered 14 times. He narrated the BREMA cartoon documentary, &quot;The Colour Television Receiver&quot; (aka &quot;Degaussing&quot; or &quot;The Colour Receiver Installation Film&quot;), which was shown every day (except Sunday) on BBC2 between 14 October 1967 and 8 January 1971. He also provided narration for the BBC nuclear war drama documentary &quot;The War Game&quot;, which won the Best Documentary Feature Oscar in 1966 but was not shown on British television until 1985.

Aspel was a studio announcer at the BBC on 14 February 1969 during a live broadcast from the Dorchester Hotel of an awards ceremony, when the host, Kenneth Horne, died of a heart attack. Aspel filled in unscripted until the show resumed. He was later quoted as saying: &quot;I got round this in a suitably dignified way. But it was awful as Kenneth Horne was not only a great performer, but such a wonderful man.&quot;

In both 1969 and 1976, Aspel hosted the BBC&#x27;s &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; contest to choose Britain&#x27;s Eurovision entry and provided the UK TV commentary twice at the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot; in the same years, 1969 and 1976, in which year he also presented the contest previews.

Aspel also had a regular joke slot on the Kenny Everett radio show on Capital Radio and guest-starred twice on &quot;The Goodies&quot;, appearing as himself, including in the episode &quot;Kitten Kong&quot;, which won the Silver Rose at the Montreux Light Entertainment Festival.

From 2 September 1974 until 27 July 1984, Aspel also presented a three-hour weekday, mid-morning music and chat programme on Capital Radio in London. He then presented a Sunday show on Capital (which only lasted for a few months, ending on 30 December 1984) before moving to LBC for the remainder of the decade. He also presented weekend shows on BBC Radio 2 in the late 1980s and again in the 1990s.

In 1977, Aspel appeared with a number of other newsreaders and presenters, dressed as sailors, in a song-and-dance routine (&quot;There is Nothing Like a Dame&quot;) on &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot;. In another episode, Morecambe refers to him as &quot;Michael Aspirin&quot; (a name also used by &#x27;Disc&#x27; music magazine when Aspel was at Capital Radio). In the 1970s and 1980s Aspel presented popular ITV programmes such as &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot;, &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; and &quot;The 6 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;, a live current affairs and entertainment programme shown only in the London Weekend Television region. In 1989, he hosted a televised interactive murder mystery set at a wedding called Murder Weekend, devised and written by Joy Swift, which invited viewers to solve a whodunnit to win a prize.

During the early 1990s, Aspel presented two documentaries on BBC Radio 2 written by Terence Pettigrew, on subjects of which he and Pettigrew had personal knowledge. &quot;Caught in the Draft&quot; was a nostalgic look back at compulsory national service. Both had served, at different times, in West Germany, Aspel in the Kings Royal Rifle Corps and Pettigrew in the REME. Also taking part in the programme were comedian/compere Bob Monkhouse, Leslie Thomas, author of &quot;The Virgin Soldiers&quot;, and BBC Radio 2 drivetime host John Dunn. This was followed by &quot;Nobody Cried When The Trains Pulled Out&quot;, a documentary about the evacuation of children from major British cities during World War 2 that included champion boxer Henry Cooper, actor Derek Nimmo and author Ben Wicks.

Aspel was the host of the chat show &quot;Aspel &amp; Company&quot;, which ran from 9 June 1984 to 20 June 1993 on ITV. The show was successful in attracting high-profile guests including then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and George Harrison with Ringo Starr. In 1993, &quot;Aspel &amp; Company&quot; was censured by the Independent Television Commission because of an interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone who were promoting their joint business venture Planet Hollywood. For a time, &quot;Aspel &amp; Company&quot; performed well for ITV in the highly competitive Saturday night ratings but after the Planet Hollywood controversy, Aspel vowed never to host a chat show again.

Aspel was featured on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1980. When host Eamonn Andrews died in 1987, he became presenter of the programme until its run ended in 2003. In 1993, Aspel began presenting the ITV supernatural programme &quot;Strange but True?&quot;, a series exploring supernatural phenomena and unexplained mysteries. The programme ran between 1993 and 1997. He presented a new version of the ITV game show &quot;Blockbusters&quot; for the BBC in 1997; Aspel presented 60 episodes in total. In 1993, Aspel became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) &quot;for services to broadcasting&quot;. He has also been voted &quot;TV Times&quot; and Variety Club Television Personality of the Year. He was also voted into the Royal Television Society Hall of Fame for outstanding services to television.

Aspel presented BBC&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; from 2000 until 2008; his last programme (recorded at Kentwell Hall, Suffolk) was shown on 30 March 2008, being a tribute to himself. In 2003, Aspel starred in a BBC Three spoof documentary, &quot;Sex, Lies &amp; Michael Aspel&quot;, which claimed he had affairs with Pamela Anderson, Valerie Singleton and Angie Best, among others. Aspel guest hosted the topical quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; on two occasions (October 2005 and November 2007).

In 2006, he played the role of the narrator in the UK tour of Richard O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;. During July and August 2008, Aspel filmed &quot;Evacuees Reunited&quot;, a five-part documentary series made by Leopard Films for ITV1, which aired from 15 to 19 December 2008. Along with 15 other wartime evacuees, he returned to the locations of his own youth, including his wartime home in Chard, Somerset. He was reunited with his childhood gang of evacuees at Forde Abbey, just outside the town. Later he caught up with his 96-year-old former school teacher, Audrey Guppy.

==Personal life==
Aspel has been married three times and has seven children. He married Dian Sessions in 1957; they had two children and divorced in 1961. Aspel married Anne Reed, a TV scriptwriter, in 1962 and they had twin children, divorcing in 1967. In 1977, Aspel married actress Elizabeth Power, best known for her role as Christine Hewitt in &quot;EastEnders&quot;; the couple had two sons, but Aspel left her in 1994 for a production assistant on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, Irene Clarke. They live in Weybridge, Surrey.

As a supporter of the charity Cancer Research UK, Aspel was made a Freeman of the borough of Elmbridge, Surrey, in April 2008.

A 2004 article in &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that Aspel had a dormant case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

==Charity work==
Aspel is a Vice-President of The Children&#x27;s Trust, a UK charity for children with brain injury.
He is also a Patron and long time supporter of the Princess Alice Hospice, Esher and The British Evacuees Association.

Aspel is one of nine presidents of Better Planet Education.

<text>&quot;&quot; () is the national anthem of Timor-Leste. It was originally adopted when East Timor unilaterally declared its independence from Portugal in 1975. However, this usage would be short-lived, when the country was invaded by Indonesia. It was officially re-adopted when the independence of Timor-Leste was finally restored in 2002 following a United Nations intervention.

The music was composed by Afonso Redentor Araújo, and the words were written by the poet Francisco Borja da Costa, who was killed by Indonesian forces at the time of the invasion. It was originally sung exclusively in Portuguese, however there is now a Tetum version.

==Legislation==
The infraconstitutional officialisation and the forms of ceremony of uses of the state anthem are regulated by the Law of the National Symbols of Timor-Leste.

==History==

===Early history===
The name &quot;Ngāruawāhia&quot; means &quot;the opened food pits&quot;, which derives from a great feast in the 17th century. Te Ngaere, a Ngāti Tamainupō chief, and Heke-i-te-rangi, a Ngāti Maniapoto woman, had eloped and settled at Ngāruawāhia, causing a rift between their tribes. When their first child was born, Ngāti Maniapoto were invited to the celebration in an attempt to reconcile the tribes. Te Ngaere&#x27;s father named the boy Te Mana-o-te-rangi in honour of Ngāti Maniapoto. Peace was established between the tribes, and Te Ngaere shouted &quot;Wāhia ngā rua&quot; (break open the food pits).

=== Invasion ===

When Rangiriri pā was taken by General Cameron after a white flag of truce was flown, Cameron informed Māori that Governor Grey would only come to talk peace if his forces were allowed to enter Ngāruawāhia unopposed. Cameron entered a deserted Ngāruawāhia on 8 December 1863, but Grey never came to talk peace. Despite Māori protest, sales of confiscated land went ahead in 1864, shortly after the invasion. During the 19th century, Ngāruawāhia was named Queenstown and then Newcastle. However, the town returned to the original name in 1878.

===20th century===
A gas power station was built in Herschell St in 1913 by the Town Board for lighting. It used Glen Massey coal, which was converted to gas in a Cambridge Patent Gas Producer (many were used about this time in Australasia) and used to drive a 2-cylinder gas engine. It closed in 1924. Much of the machinery was removed in 1950 and from 1954 the building was used as a scout hall.

Officers from the United States visited Ngāruawāhia during World War II and would share food at hāngī. Queen Elizabeth II has visited Ngāruawāhia on two occasions (1953 &amp; 1974). On the latter occasion, then Māori Queen Dame Te Ātairangikaahu and her husband Whatumoana Paki welcomed Queen Elizabeth II to the local marae. The Great Ngaruawahia Music Festival was held in 1973, and featured many music acts, including some that went on to become internationally famous such as Black Sabbath and Split Enz. It was the first large outdoor music festival in New Zealand.

In 1980, Mayor Latta released a book about the history of the town titled &#x27;Meeting of the Waters&#x27;.

In March 1998, a freight train derailed on the local North Island Main Trunk line&#x27;s rail bridge across the Waikato River. The incident caused structural damage to the bridge.
==== Water supply ====
Until 1923 springs in Waipa Esplanade and Market Street were used. In April 1923 a reticulation scheme was opened, supplied by a dam on the Quarry Creek (now Mangarata Stream), away, in the Hakarimatas. The concrete dam is long and high and now accessible by the Waterworks Walk from Brownlee Avenue, alongside Mangarata Stream. The population was then 1100 in 240 houses. By 1965 the population was 3,630, so water was instead pumped from the Waikato and from a deep bore, with a new reservoir and water treatment plant opened in 1965.

=== 21st century ===
By April 2001, the damaged rail bridge was mended.

In 2008, Ngāruawāhia set a world record for the largest haka and by 2010 the town had its own community news.

In 2011, murals were installed for Ngāruawāhia&#x27;s 150th anniversary in 2013 Ngaruawahia High School (which opened in 1963) celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013.

In May 2016, Heather du Plessis-Allan (an NZME broadcaster) claimed that the &quot;town is rotting&quot;. The broadcaster later accepted a challenge to visit the town and an article relating to the incident appeared on a &quot;Waikato Times&quot; front page. According to Waikato District Mayor Allan Sanson, du Plessis-Allan &quot;really upset locals&quot;. In June 2016, local mayor Allan Sanson said du Plessis-Allan spent around three hours in the town, apologizing to residents.

In 2019, the name of the town was officially gazetted as Ngāruawāhia.

==Infrastructure==

=== Waikato River crossings ===

Until the Waikato invasion the rivers were the main transport routes, but, after the Great South Road and main trunk line were built, the rivers became barriers, which needed crossings.

As early as 1870 a public meeting called for a bridge, but a punt continued to be the main means of crossing the river until the road-rail bridge opened for traffic in 1876. So long as there were few trains, there was little complaint that gates closed 10 minutes before a train was due. However, by the 1900s road and rail traffic was increasing, averaging 20 trains, 275 pedestrians, 43 equestrians, 29 light vehicles, 18 milk carts, 6 wagons, and 55 stock a day in 1910.

==== 1921 single-lane road bridge ====
A survey for a road bridge was done in 1911. Test borings for piles were done in 1912. The Ngāruawāhia Town Board and Waikato, Waipa, and Raglan County Councils agreed to share the cost in 1914. The State Advances office lent £2,500 for the bridge in 1915. Wartime shortages caused further delays, but by 1917 the new bridge was taking shape. Further delay occurred when additional piles had to be driven. The Minister reported the work well in hand in 1919, but then a temporary bridge, used in construction, was hit by a steamer. Work got under way again, £3,000 was in the Public Works Estimates and the bridge was reported complete in 1920, except for its approaches. The bridge opened in 1921 and, on 28 July 1921, was officially opened by the Minister of Public Works, J. G. Coates. It was wide and long, made up of 3 x , a and a span. Two piers were in the river on concrete cylinders sunk below normal water-level. The others were reinforced concrete on concrete piling and the deck and trusses of Australian hardwood.

Complaints had been made about a single-lane bridge since before it was built, so, when the new NIMT bridge was built, the Main Highways Board leased the old one and added decking. The conversion was completed in early November 1931, allowing 2-way traffic. Single lane traffic was reinstated for a few months in 1936 to allow a truss on the 1921 bridge to be replaced. Traffic was still increasing. In 1935 traffic between Ohinewai and Ngāruawāhia averaged 660 vehicles a day. By 1938 it had risen to 1,329.

==== 1956 bridge ====
On 13 March 1953 a contract was let for a new steel truss bridge. An April 1955 photo shows two piers in the river. On 20 August 1955 the centre span was placed and a 1955 photo shows the bridge almost finished. The first car drove over the bridge on 19 October 1956. By 2008 17,392 vehicles a day were crossing the bridge. No more recent counts have been published, but, after the opening of the Taupiri link in 2013, traffic on the Great South Rd in Ngāruawāhia, was 12,467 in 2015, suggesting that traffic on the bridge has been reduced by about 5,000 vehicles a day.


=== Listed buildings ===
Ngāruawāhia&#x27;s history is reflected in the number of its Listed Buildings –

Category 1 Turangawaewae House built in 1912–1919 as Te Kauhanganui building in a fusion of Arts and Crafts and traditional Māori styles;

Category 2 – Band Rotunda, Delta Tavern, Doctor&#x27;s House, former bakery, former Flourmill Store, former Māori pā – Puke i Ahua, Grant&#x27;s Chambers, 13 Lower Waikato Esplanade, 2 Old Taupiri Rd, Pioneer Gun Turret, Riverdale, St Paul&#x27;s Church, War Memorial.

==Community==

===Māori King Movement===
Ngāruawāhia is home to the Kīngitanga. The first Māori King, Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, was crowned at Ngāruawāhia in 1858 and was living there when he died two years later. The current Māori Queen is Ngā Wai Hono i te Pō; she obtained the throne at Tūrangawaewae Marae following the death of her father in 2024.

===Marae===

Ngāruawāhia has two marae affiliated with the Waikato Tainui hapū of Ngāti Mahuta and Ngāti Te Weehi: Tūrangawaewae and its Mahinaarangi or Turongo meeting house, and Waikeri-Tangirau Marae.

===Tribal Huk===
A local gang is Tribal Huk, who have been seen as heroes by the community for providing lunches to schoolchildren in Ngāruawāhia, Hamilton and Huntly. In particular, they have been known for making sandwiches, which earned them the nickname &quot;Sandwich Gang&quot;.

In October 2016, Tribal Huk president Jamie Pink started a movement against methamphetamine, known in New Zealand as &quot;P&quot;. Waikato District Mayor Allan Sanson supported Pink&#x27;s message to Ngāruawāhia methamphetamine dealers to either leave the town within 24 hours or &quot;visits&quot; would begin.
The demand was also supported by members of the community who had gathered at a local meeting. According to a gang source, Ngāruawāhia became P free, but the Police Association stated that there was no evidence that P dealers had left Ngāruawāhia. There is additionally concern Pink has damaged the work that Tribal Huk did feeding a thousand Waikato schoolchildren.

In November 2016, another community meeting was held. Pink was not present.

=== Christianity ===
In the 1996 census, the majority of residents identified as Christian. A Bible is traditionally used during the crowning of a Māori monarch. In 1995, the Holy Trinity Anglican Church burned down, and a new church had been built in its place by 1998.

On the northern side of the Waipā River is the Christian Youth Camps (CYC), the largest youth camp site in New Zealand. CYC started in the early 1960s with large Easter conventions. Today there are two separate camp sites on 38 hectares of land. The camp offers school holiday camps throughout the year. During the terms, the camps are used by various groups, including schools, churches and sporting organisations.

===Sport and recreation===

====Football (soccer)====
Ngaruawahia United, known as &quot;The Green Machine&quot;, is the local football (soccer) club, founded in 1968. Centennial Park serves as the home ground for the club, and has been the home venue for ASB Premiership side Waikato FC in past seasons.

====Rugby league====
The town&#x27;s rugby league teams are Ngaruawahia Panthers and Tūrangawaewae.
The &#x27;Ngaruawahia Rugby League Club&#x27; is the oldest such club in the Waikato. Early games were played on varying venues, for instance Taupiri paddock and Paterson Park. The first major match for the town was held in August 1911 when they lost to Auckland 22 – 36 at the Caledonian Ground in Frankton. Ngaruawahia did however beat Hamilton United 27 – 4 in the first ever Northern Union game to be played at Hamilton&#x27;s Steele Park in 1912. The senior team were Champion of Champions in 1956 and 1957.

Ngāruawāhia is the home of the rugby league team Turangawaewae RLC, which is named after the marae opposite the clubrooms. The club currently holds the record for the first team to win consecutive titles in the annual Waicoa Bay Premiers Competition, consisting of all teams in the Waikato, Coast and Bay Of Plenty regions.
&#x27;Ngaruawahia Rugby League Club&#x27; (Panthers) are 2011 champions, Premiers, U17, U14, U13 are all champions.

==== River activities ====
The local regatta has been a fundamental event for the region for well over a century. An event is held every year in March on the Waikato River. The first regatta was an unofficial event in 1892, involving both Māori and Pākehā festivities. The regatta provided a means of association between two ethnic groups, socially and culturally. The first official regatta took place in 1896 and since then has grown to become one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest aquatic festivals. During the centennial regatta in March 1996, over 48,000 people visited the town to see thousands of performers from a number of countries.

For many years, jumping off the rail bridge has been a tradition. However, organisations such as KiwiRail want the practice to end.

== Hopuhopu ==

Hopuhopu is north of Ngāruawāhia. From 1853 Hopuhopu had a boys&#x27; mission school, which lost most of its pupils in 1862 and, by 1863, was reported as in disrepair. The mission house burnt down in 1886. An army camp was built on the mission site in the 1920s, including its own water supply, ammunition dumps and a railway siding. A 1925 photograph showed only one building and many tents, but a 1955 aerial photo showed the extent of building, which was largely complete by 1927. In 1993 the camp was returned to Waikato-Tainui, who converted it to their headquarters and Waikato-Tainui College for Research and Development.

<text>The Abu Shusha massacre took place on 13–14 May 1948 during Operation Barak, when the Zionist Givati Brigade mortared and then stormed Abu Shusha, in Mandatory Palestine, killing between 60 and 70+ Palestinian Arab villagers.

== Massacre ==

On 13 May, the Givati Brigade launched the second stage of Operation Barak, codenamed &quot;Operation Maccabi&quot;. During this, the village of Abu Shusha, located 8 km southeast of Ramle, was targeted. On 13–14 May, Abu Shusha was mortared and then stormed by units of the 51st and 54th battalions. Inhabitants fled and houses were blown up, although some remained. The remaining villagers were expelled on 21 May. A nearby Arab Legion unit reported that &quot;the Jews were killing villagers&quot; on 19 May. The Givati Brigade claimed that only 30 Arabs had been killed, while the Arabs claimed that more than 70 had been killed.

Arab authorities in Ramle called for Red Cross intervention and informed it that &quot;the Jews had committed barbaric acts&quot; in Abu Shusha. A Haganah soldier made two attempts to rape a 20-year old female prisoner.
== Aftermath ==
Recent research suggests that around 60 villagers were massacred during the attack. In 1995, a mass grave with 52 skeletons was discovered in Abu Shusha, although their cause of death is undetermined.

<doc id="336528" wikidata="Q1857508" url="?curid=336528" title="President of the Continental Congress">
<text>The president of the United States in Congress Assembled, known unofficially as the president of the Continental Congress and later as president of the Congress of the Confederation, was the presiding officer of the Continental Congress, the convention of delegates that assembled in Philadelphia as the first transitional national government of the United States during the American Revolution. The president was a member of Congress elected by the other delegates to serve as a neutral discussion moderator during meetings of Congress. Designed to be a largely ceremonial position without much influence, the office was unrelated to the later office of President of the United States.

Upon the ratification of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, which served as new first constitution of the U.S. in March 1781, the Continental Congress became the Congress of the Confederation, and membership from the Second Continental Congress, along with its president, carried over without interruption to the First Congress of the Confederation.

Fourteen men served as president of Congress between September 1774 and November 1788. They came from nine of the original 13 states: Virginia (3), Massachusetts (2), Pennsylvania (2), South Carolina (2), Connecticut, (1), Delaware (1), Maryland (1), New Jersey (1), and New York (1).

==Role==
By design, the president of the Continental Congress was a position with limited authority. The Continental Congress, fearful of concentrating political power in an individual, gave their presiding officer even less responsibility than the speakers in the lower houses of the colonial assemblies. Unlike some colonial speakers, the president of Congress could not, for example, set the legislative agenda or make committee appointments. The president could not meet privately with foreign leaders; such meetings were held with committees or the entire Congress.

The presidency was a largely ceremonial position. There was no salary. The primary role of the office was to preside over meetings of Congress, which entailed serving as an impartial moderator during debates. When Congress would resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole to discuss important matters, the president would relinquish his chair to the chairman of the Committee of the Whole. Even so, the fact that President Thomas McKean was at the same time serving as Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, provoked some criticism that he had become too powerful. According to historian Jennings Sanders, McKean&#x27;s critics were ignorant of the powerlessness of the office of president of Congress.

The president was also responsible for dealing with a large amount of official correspondence, but he could not answer any letter without being instructed to do so by Congress. Presidents also signed, but did not write, Congress&#x27;s official documents. These limitations could be frustrating, because a delegate essentially declined in influence when he was elected president.

Historian Richard B. Morris argued that, despite the ceremonial role, some presidents were able to wield some influence:
Congress, and its presidency, declined in importance after the ratification of the Articles of Confederation and the ending of the Revolutionary War. Increasingly, delegates elected to the Congress declined to serve, the leading men in each state preferred to serve in state government, and the Congress had difficulty establishing a quorum. President John Hanson wanted to resign after only a week in office, but Congress lacked a quorum to select a successor, and so he stayed on. President Thomas Mifflin found it difficult to convince the states to send enough delegates to Congress to ratify the 1783 Treaty of Paris. For six weeks in 1784, President Richard Henry Lee did not come to Congress, but instead instructed secretary Charles Thomson to forward any papers that needed his signature.

John Hancock was elected to a second term in November 1785, even though he was not then in Congress, and Congress was aware that he was unlikely to attend. He never took his seat, citing poor health, though he may have been uninterested in the position. Two delegates, David Ramsay and Nathaniel Gorham, performed his duties with the title of &quot;chairman&quot;. When Hancock finally resigned the office in June 1786, Gorham was elected. After he resigned in November 1786, it was months before enough members were present in Congress to elect a new president. In February 1787, General Arthur St. Clair was elected. Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance during St. Clair&#x27;s presidency and elected him as the governor of the Northwest Territory.

As the people of the various states began debating the proposed United States Constitution in later months of 1787, the Confederation Congress found itself reduced to the status of a caretaker government. There were not enough delegates present to choose St. Clair&#x27;s successor until January 22, 1788, when the final president of Congress, Cyrus Griffin, was elected. Griffin resigned his office on November 15, 1788, after only two delegates showed up for the new session of Congress.

==Term of office==
Prior to ratification of the Articles, presidents of Congress served terms of no specific duration; their tenure ended when they resigned, or, lacking an official resignation, when Congress selected a successor. When Peyton Randolph, who was elected in September 1774 to preside over the First Continental Congress, was unable to attend the last few days of the session due to poor health, Henry Middleton was elected to replace him. When the Second Continental Congress convened the following May, Randolph was again chosen as president, but he returned to Virginia two weeks later to preside over the House of Burgesses. John Hancock was elected to fill the vacancy, but his position was somewhat ambiguous because it was not clear if Randolph had resigned or was on a leave of absence. The situation became uncomfortable when Randolph returned to Congress in September 1775. Some delegates thought Hancock should have stepped down, but he did not; the matter was resolved only by Randolph&#x27;s sudden death that October.

Ambiguity also clouded the end of Hancock&#x27;s term. He left in October 1777 for what he believed was an extended leave of absence, only to find upon his return that Congress had elected Henry Laurens to replace him. Hancock, whose term ran from May 24, 1775 to October 29, 1777 (a period of ), was the longest serving president of Congress.

The length of a presidential term was ultimately codified by Article Nine of the Articles of Confederation, which authorized Congress &quot;to appoint one of their number to preside; provided that no person be allowed to serve in the office of president more than one year in any term of three years&quot;. When the Articles went into effect in March 1781, however, the Continental Congress did not hold an election for a new president under the new constitution. Instead, Samuel Huntington continued serving a term that had already exceeded the new term limit. The first president to serve the specified one-year term was John Hanson (November 5, 1781 to November 4, 1782).

==List of presidents==

==Relationship to the president of the United States==
Beyond a similarity of title, the office of President of Congress &quot;bore no relationship&quot; to the later office of President of the United States. As historian Edmund Burnett wrote:
Nonetheless, the presidents of the Continental Congress and the presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled are sometimes claimed to have been president before George Washington as if the offices were equivalent. The continuous nature of the Continental Congresses and Congress under the Articles also allows for multiple claims of being the &quot;first president of the United States.&quot; This would include Peyton Randolph as president of the First Continental Congress, John Hancock as president when the Declaration of Independence was signed, Samuel Huntington as president when the Articles were ratified and took effect, Thomas McKean as the first president elected under the Articles, and John Hanson as the first president under the Articles to serve the prescribed one-year term. Hanson&#x27;s grandson&#x27;s campaign to name Hanson the &quot;first president of the United States&quot; was successful in having Hanson&#x27;s statue placed in Statuary Hall in the US Capitol, even though, according to historian Gregory Stiverson, Hanson was not one of Maryland&#x27;s foremost leaders of the Revolutionary era. Presumably due to this campaign, Hanson is often still dubiously listed as the first president of Congress under the Articles.

The function of the president of the Continental Congress may be more akin to that of a vice president&#x27;s constitutional role as the president of the United States Senate.

==Seal==
Shortly after the creation of the first die for the Great Seal of the United States, the Congress of the Confederation ordered a smaller seal for the use of the President of the Congress. It was a small oval, with the crest from the Great Seal (the radiant constellation of thirteen stars surrounded by clouds) in the center, with the motto &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; above it. Benson Lossing claimed it was used by all the Presidents of the Congress after 1782, probably to seal envelopes on correspondence sent to the Congress, though only examples from Thomas Mifflin are documented. This seal&#x27;s use did not pass over to the new government in 1789.

<text>Reagan Youth is an American anarcho-punk band formed by singer Dave Rubinstein (Dave Insurgent) and guitarist Paul Bakija (Paul Cripple) in Queens, New York City in early 1980.

== History ==
=== Initial career (1980–1990) ===
David Rubinstein and Paul Bakija met in Russel Sage JrHS and together attended Forest Hills High School, the same high school Simon and Garfunkel and the Ramones attended when they began. After rehearsals under the name Pus with a varying rhythm section, the group changed its name to Reagan Youth shortly before playing its first gig on August 22, 1980, with bassist Andy Bryan (Andy Apathy) and drummer Charlie Bonet (Charlie Tripper). Reagan Youth quickly gained a following and were soon playing the punk clubs of Manhattan. Bakija&#x27;s physics teacher at FHHS attended a Queens basement rehearsal. And he then attended a show at CBGB&#x27;s; where once he had his head shaved; he became associated with the band at times hauling Paul&#x27;s amps and equipment into the city from Queens in his Dodge Dart. After the band recorded a four-song demo in 1981, Bryan was replaced by Al Pike. Bonet departed soon after; after the band briefly rehearsed with Rubinstein filling in on drums, Steve Weissman joined full-time. They signed to the R Radical imprint.

After graduation and the release of their first record, the seven-song &quot;Youth Anthems for the New Order&quot; EP, they began touring nationally and were regulars at the Sunday afternoon hardcore matinee shows at CBGB. In 1984, prior to a significant US tour, Pike and Weissman left the group, with Pike going on to join a formative version of Glenn Danzig&#x27;s group Samhain briefly around this time. They were replaced by Victor Dominicis (Vic Venom) and Rick Griffith (Rick Royale) respectively. Griffith was later replaced in 1985 by Javier Madriaga (Johnny Aztec), who has also played drums in Lujuria, A.P.P.L.E., and Heart Attack.

By the late 1980s the extensive touring had taken its toll on the group. Despite the many shows played and the relatively large album sales for a hardcore punk band, they continually found themselves broke. After Ronald Reagan left office in 1989, the band split up. Despite their decision to disband, the group attracted the attention of the burgeoning punk label New Red Archives, with whom they signed a two-album deal. New Red Archives first re-released &quot;Youth Anthems for the New World Order&quot; with three additional outtakes as the &quot;Volume 1&quot; LP. In 1990, Bakija (playing both guitar and bass), Madriaga, and Rubinstein recorded a final album, &quot;Volume 2&quot;.

=== Post-breakup (1990–2006) ===
Dominicis went on to play guitar in Nausea while Bakija, Madriaga, and Rubinstein continued making music together, briefly performing in a psychedelic rock group called House of God that was derailed by Rubinstein&#x27;s increasing drug and health problems. House of God recorded a 7-song demo, an unmixed version of which can be found online.

By 1990 Rubinstein had become a heroin user and occasional dealer. In a conflict with another dealer, he was severely beaten with a baseball bat, requiring weeks of hospitalization. In 1993 he began dating Tiffany Bresciani, who supported both of their drug habits by prostitution. This same year, Rubinstein&#x27;s mother was killed in a car accident. Soon after, he and Bresciani were on Houston Street looking for customers and drugs. A familiar customer in a truck hired Bresciani and the two of them disappeared. A few days later, police on Long Island stopped the same truck and discovered Bresciani&#x27;s slain body in the back. The driver was Joel Rifkin, later convicted as a serial killer responsible for the murder of several sex workers. Despondent over his continuing drug addiction and the loss of his girlfriend and mother, Rubinstein committed suicide shortly thereafter.

This same year, New Red Archives issued &quot;A Collection of Pop Classics&quot;, which collected both &quot;Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Volume 2&quot; on a single CD.

In 1998, New Red Archives released &quot;Live &amp; Rare&quot;, a CD compiling highlights from New York City-area Reagan Youth sets from the early 1980s with the Pike/Weissman lineup, along with tracks from the band&#x27;s initial demo and a brief demo for &quot;Volume 2&quot;. Pike and New Red Archives owner Nicky Garratt, also the guitarist for the British band the UK Subs, contributed liner notes for this release.

In 2002, plans for a reunion set at CBGB featuring Bakija, Bryan and Bonet were shattered by Bryan&#x27;s sudden, fatal heart attack. 

=== Reformation (2006–2024) ===
In 2006, Reagan Youth officially reformed around Bakija, Pike, Madriaga, and new vocalist Pat McGowen (Pat Distraction). They initially intended only to play a single show but opted to continue after the project &quot;took on a life of its own.&quot; They played several additional local and regional tours, and embarked on the &quot;Resurrection Tour&quot; in August 2007 with Boston hardcore band Mouth Sewn Shut.

The band began expressing interest in writing and recording a third record and suggested that it would be about the life and times of Dave Insurgent. The band continued to tour extensively, including their first shows in Germany and Belgium in 2008 and a European tour in 2009.

In early 2010 McGowen was let go and after a year of inactivity, the band resumed performed live in late 2010 with new singer Kenny Young, with drummer Mike Sabatino replacing Madriaga. Bassist Dave Manzullo replaced Pike shortly thereafter due to Pike&#x27;s health concerns. They released the new recording &quot;Lucky 7&quot; through free Internet outlets in 2011. But Young&#x27;s drug addiction led to his replacement by Jim Diesel and Tibbie X replaced Dave Manzullo as well as becoming the permanent bassist. Diesel was let go and was replaced by Paul Rye. Paul Rye and Sabatino were soon after replaced by drummer Felipe Torres who introduced the band to his student Stig Whisper and Trey Oswald. That lineup remained intact until Trey Oswald ran off stage in Vancouver at which time the band replaced them with Jeff Penalty (ex-Dead Kennedys) on vocals and Rick Contreras on drums. Penalty was soon replaced by A.J. DeFeo.

Guitarist Paul Cripple noticed that no one but Tibbie X were interested in recording Volume III with due to various issues. Paul went to Germany and recorded five songs with German Max Motherfucker and drummer Bjorn Irlinger from the band Oxymoron where they toured. The recordings were subsequently destroyed by Bjorn Irlinger who dropped out of the tour with all the band’s money.

Paul returned to the states and had Spike Polite on vocals while Kevin Knuckles played drums but was soon replaced by Vince Solecito on drums and David Luna on vocals. The band eventually got their original drummer Charlie Bonet briefly back into the fold. Luna was replaced by Neil Patterson. 

The most recent line up consisted of Scott Sturgeon of Leftover Crack, Choking Victim and Star Fucking Hipsters as singer. Paul Cripple played a few shows with this lineup. Following a return of Cripple&#x27;s cancer and decline in his health, the band stopped touring and focused on recording. He died from the cancer on September 21, 2024.

== Music ==
=== Lyrical content ===
Reagan Youth is an aggressively anarchist, socialist, and anti-racist band, and often utilized Ku Klux Klan and Nazi Party imagery for satirical effect. In their original 1980s incarnation, they sought to address the parallels between the policies of Ronald Reagan, the Christian Right and American conservatism, and the beliefs of the hate groups. Their self-titled song, &quot;Reagan Youth&quot;, uses a tongue-in-cheek rhetoric to draw parallels between Young Republicans who rallied to the cause of Ronald Reagan, and the Hitler Youth of Nazi Germany, ushering in an era of songs about Ronald Reagan in American punk music. The band expressed its left-wing politics through irony, using images from hate groups for their album/CD covers.

=== Musical style ===
Musically, the band was firmly rooted in the early hardcore/punk crossover tradition, but moved deeper into waters uncharted by their punk rock contemporaries as their career progressed. While their 1983 debut is an accomplished work squarely in keeping with hardcore punk convention, their 1990 followup features dense guitar work replete with solos and overdubs, diversified tempos and several sonic experiments, leading it to draw comparisons to Black Sabbath and 1970s album-oriented rock.

<doc id="336539" wikidata="Q1070984" url="?curid=336539" title="Sonic Adventure 2">
<text>is a 2001 platform game developed by Sonic Team USA and published by Sega for the Dreamcast. It features two good-vs-evil stories: Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna attempt to save the world, while Shadow the Hedgehog, Doctor Eggman, and Rouge the Bat attempt to conquer it. The stories are divided into three gameplay styles: fast-paced platforming for Sonic and Shadow, third-person shooting for Tails and Eggman, and action-adventure exploration for Knuckles and Rouge. Like previous &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games, the player completes levels while collecting rings and defeating enemies. Outside the main gameplay, they can interact with Chao, a virtual pet, and compete in multiplayer battles.

After the release of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (1998), Sonic Team was downsized and a portion of the staff moved to San Francisco to establish Sonic Team USA. They worked on &quot;Adventure 2&quot; for a year and a half, with Takashi Iizuka directing and Yuji Naka producing. Developed during a tumultuous period in Sega&#x27;s history, &quot;Adventure 2&quot; had a significantly smaller development team than the first game. Sonic Team USA streamlined the design to emphasize faster, more action-oriented gameplay, giving each character roughly equal gameplay time. The levels were influenced by American locations such as San Francisco and Yosemite National Park. The soundtrack—composed by Jun Senoue, Fumie Kumatani, Tomoya Ohtani, and Kenichi Tokoi—spans genres including pop-punk, glam metal, hip-hop, jazz and orchestral arrangements, and features several metal singers.

&quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; was released in June 2001, coinciding with the franchise&#x27;s tenth anniversary. It was the final &quot;Sonic&quot; game for a Sega console, released in the months after Sega discontinued the Dreamcast and transitioned to third-party development. Later in 2001, it was ported to the GameCube as Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, the first &quot;Sonic&quot; game for a Nintendo console. &quot;Adventure 2&quot; received positive reviews, with praise for its gameplay variety, visuals, and music but criticism for its camera, voice acting, and plot. Although reviews of &quot;Battle&quot; were more mixed, it sold 1.7 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the bestselling GameCube games and the bestselling third-party GameCube game. Following &quot;Adventure 2&quot;, &quot;Sonic&quot; became a multiplatform franchise, beginning with &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; (2003).

&quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; introduced &quot;Sonic&quot; to a wider audience with its GameCube port. It originated characters and elements used in later games; Shadow became one of the most popular &quot;Sonic&quot; characters and featured in the spin-offs &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; (2005) and &quot;Shadow Generations&quot; (2024). &quot;Adventure 2&quot; remains popular among &quot;Sonic&quot; fans and was rereleased for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows in 2012. Its first level, City Escape, is considered one of the greatest opening stages in a video game. &quot;Adventure 2&quot; has been ranked among the best &quot;Sonic&quot; games, although it has been characterized as divisive, particularly for its emphasis on multiple characters. Its story has been adapted in media including in the anime series &quot;Sonic X&quot; (2003–2006) and the live-action film &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (2024).

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; is a 3D platform game divided into two campaigns: Hero and Dark. In the Hero campaign, players control Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, who fight to save the world; in the Dark campaign, players control Shadow the Hedgehog, Doctor Eggman and Rouge the Bat, fighting to conquer it. Each campaign cycles through levels of its three characters, telling different sides of the story. Levels have a variety of themes (such as cities, jungles, desert pyramids and outer space), with some followed by boss fights. The two campaigns&#x27; stories occur in parallel; completing both campaigns unlocks a final story with all six characters, culminating in a final boss fight.

Sonic and Shadow play fast-paced levels, emphasizing platforming. Their homing attack can lock on to robots created by Eggman and GUN, and they can grind on rails. Tails&#x27;s and Eggman&#x27;s levels are slower and oriented towards multidirectional shooting; they are confined to mechs in which they can jump short heights, hover and shoot enemies. Knuckles&#x27;s and Rouge&#x27;s levels are open and feature action-adventure gameplay with treasure hunting; in each level, they must find three shards of the Master Emerald. Their search is guided by radar and puzzle-based clues from harmless robots. Knuckles and Rouge can glide, defeat enemies with punches and kicks, and scale walls, digging into them to find power-ups.

&quot;Adventure 2&quot; has the health system found in many other &quot;Sonic&quot; games. The player collects rings scattered throughout the levels; being hit by an enemy while holding rings causes the player to drop them all, while being hit without rings causes them to lose a life. Tails and Eggman have health bars, which are slowly refilled by collecting rings. Dying with no lives results in a game over screen. The characters can obtain permanent upgrades that grant them new abilities; for example, one upgrade allows Sonic and Shadow to dash along a sequential trail of rings to reach distant platforms, one gives Tails and Eggman hover jets that slows their descent to cross large gaps, while another lets Knuckles and Rouge dig into the ground to uncover treasure and Master Emerald pieces.

Separate from the main campaigns, the player can raise Chao as virtual pets. They have five attributes (Swim, Fly, Run, Power and Stamina) and a moral continuum from Hero to Dark. From the moment they hatch, their stats can be increased with Chaos Drives or small animals, found in the main stages, which empower them to compete in karate and racing minigames. Their alignment gradually changes based on their affection for the characters; for example, a Chao which likes Tails will gradually become more heroic. Playing with Chao increases affection, and when a Chao becomes fully Hero or Dark, it assumes that form permanently. Although Chao eventually die, if they receive enough affection during their lives they reincarnate.

&quot;Adventure 2&quot; has 180 emblems, earned for a variety of tasks. Each level has five missions; only the first is required to continue the campaign, and other missions include completing a harder version of a level and collecting 100 rings. The player earns emblems by completing missions and other tasks, many related to Chao raising. Collecting all the emblems unlocks a 3D version of the Green Hill Zone stage from the original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;.

The game has several two-player modes. Players may race on foot through new (or altered) levels, have shoot-&#x27;em-up battles in mechs, hunt for Master Emerald shards or race in go-karts. A few characters are playable in these modes, but not in the main game; Tikal and Chaos from the original &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; are playable in the treasure-hunting game, as are Amy Rose and Metal Sonic in the foot-racing levels and mechs piloted by Chao and Big the Cat (replaced by a Dark Chao in &quot;Battle&quot;) in the shooting levels.

==Plot==

Doctor Eggman learns of a secret weapon from the diary of his deceased grandfather, Professor Gerald Robotnik, and infiltrates a high-security Guardian Units of Nations (GUN) facility to revive it with a Chaos Emerald. The weapon—Shadow, a black hedgehog who proclaims himself the &quot;Ultimate Lifeform&quot;—offers to help Eggman conquer the world, telling him to rendezvous at an abandoned space colony, the ARK, with more Chaos Emeralds. Shadow has vowed to fulfill a promise he made to his friend, Eggman&#x27;s cousin Maria, before she died; the amnesiac Shadow interprets the promise as one of revenge. Shadow steals a Chaos Emerald, and GUN arrests Sonic after mistaking him for Shadow.

Knuckles encounters Eggman and Rouge, a government spy, attempting to steal the Master Emerald. He stops them by shattering it and searches for the scattered shards to repair it. Rouge follows Eggman to the ARK, where Shadow shows Eggman the Eclipse Cannon, another weapon created by Gerald. Shadow plans to charge the cannon with the seven Chaos Emeralds and use it to take over the world. Rouge offers her services and gives Shadow and Eggman another Chaos Emerald to gain their trust. Tails and Amy infiltrate GUN&#x27;s base and rescue Sonic, while Rouge retrieves three emeralds from the base before Eggman destroys it. Eggman makes a global broadcast in which he threatens to destroy the planet if he is not accepted as Earth&#x27;s ruler in a day. He demonstrates the cannon&#x27;s power by destroying half of the Moon. Sonic, Tails, and Amy meet up with Knuckles and use a Chaos Emerald to track the others to the ARK.

Knuckles separates from the group and finishes repairing the Master Emerald. On the ARK, Tails gives Sonic a counterfeit Chaos Emerald to destroy the Eclipse Cannon. As Sonic is about to use it, Eggman captures Tails and Amy, forcing Sonic to return and rescue them. Sonic tries to trick Eggman with the fake emerald, but Eggman deduces the plan and jettisons him in an escape pod rigged with explosives. Sonic uses the power of the fake emerald to escape; Eggman sneaks away with the last emerald and arms the Eclipse Cannon. The ARK suddenly starts falling, and a prerecorded message from Gerald is broadcast globally: he programmed the ARK to collide with Earth if the emeralds were used, a retaliation against the government for condemning his research and killing his colleagues, including Maria. Everyone but Shadow works together to access the cannon&#x27;s core and neutralize the ARK using the Master Emerald.

Amy pleads for Shadow&#x27;s help, and he remembers that he promised Maria to help mankind, not destroy it. Shadow joins Sonic and Knuckles in the core as they encounter the Biolizard, a colossal lizard and prototype Ultimate Lifeform. Knuckles deactivates the Chaos Emeralds with the Master Emerald, but the Biolizard fuses with the cannon to continue the ARK&#x27;s collision course. Sonic and Shadow use the emeralds to transform into their super forms, destroy the Biolizard, and put the ARK back into a stable orbit. This depletes Shadow&#x27;s energy and he plummets to Earth, content in fulfilling his promise to Maria. The people on Earth celebrate as the group returns, and Sonic bids Shadow farewell.

==Development==
===Conception===

&quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, the first 3D platformer in Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise, was developed by Sonic Team and released for the Dreamcast in Japan in 1998. Although the game was a critical and commercial success, Dreamcast sales struggled to meet Sega&#x27;s expectations. The &quot;Adventure&quot; team was downsized, and in 1999, 12 Sonic Team members, including &quot;Adventure&quot; director Takashi Iizuka, relocated to San Francisco, California, to establish Sonic Team USA. Sega directed a team of 11—significantly smaller than &quot;Adventure&quot; team of 120—to begin working on &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; after they spent six months localizing &quot;Adventure&quot; for the West. As with the first game, Iizuka directed &quot;Adventure 2&quot; while Yuji Naka, the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise&#x27;s co-creator, produced it. The development lasted around a year and a half.

Shiro Maekawa, who wrote portions of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Panzer Dragoon Saga&quot; (1998) and joined Sonic Team during &quot;Adventure&quot; production, conceived and wrote &quot;Adventure 2&quot; story. Maekawa accepted the role after he learned did not need to be an artist to create a story or storyboards. Because &quot;Adventure 2&quot; would be the first &quot;Sonic&quot; game released during the 21st century, Maekawa wanted a substantial portion of the story to take place in space. The rest of Sonic Team was apprehensive, but Maekawa convinced them. Maekawa drew influence from the manga and anime he had enjoyed since childhood, including &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot; (1986–1994). As Maekawa disliked Sonic as a character, he used &quot;Adventure 2&quot; as an opportunity to revise him to suit his tastes.

Among Sonic Team&#x27;s unimplemented &quot;Adventure&quot; concepts was a black hedgehog who rivaled Sonic&#x27;s coolness. The idea was revived during &quot;Adventure 2&quot; brainstorming sessions. The rival was initially villainous, but Iizuka decided to appeal to American audiences with an antihero, a popular archetype in the US. He cited the Image Comics character Spawn as an influence. Maekawa struggled to develop the concept until writing lines for a scene in which Sonic confronts the hedgehog for impersonating him. Maekawa settled on a delicate, pure character who would refer to himself using the more humble Japanese pronoun . He was originally named Terios the Prisoner, but was renamed Shadow after another new character, a bat, who became Rouge. Sonic Team saw Shadow as a one-off character who would not appear in subsequent &quot;Sonic&quot; games.

===Design===
Iizuka summarized &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; development as &quot;trying to make the impossible possible&quot;, as Sonic Team USA had to overcome the challenge of creating a game comparable in scope to the first &quot;Adventure&quot; with less than a tenth of the staff. Despite this, he considered &quot;Adventure 2&quot; the most fun &quot;Sonic&quot; game to develop, as the small team meant &quot;we were able to condense all the good elements from the previous game, and deliver a story and game that was satisfying to players everywhere&quot;. Due to the smaller staff, Sonic Team USA split &quot;Adventure 2&quot; into two campaigns featuring character teams instead of &quot;Adventure&quot; format of six starring individual characters. &quot;Adventure 2&quot; uses the same game engine, with improved texture quality and collision detection.

Sonic Team designed &quot;Adventure 2&quot; as faster and more action-oriented compared to the slower, more story-focused &quot;Adventure&quot;. Whereas Sonic Team had tried to include as much content as possible in &quot;Adventure&quot;, for &quot;Adventure 2&quot; they concentrated on the elements they deemed necessary. Iizuka noted that players who prioritized action found much of &quot;Adventure&quot; content pointless, so Sonic Team USA sought to streamline the experience while retaining &quot;Adventure&quot; &quot;bulkiness&quot;. They removed the hub worlds in favor of linear level progression more in line with the older &quot;Sonic&quot; games, and divided action and exploration sequences among the characters rather than mixing them. Each level was tailored for its character, and unlike &quot;Adventure&quot;, in which some playable characters had short campaigns, all six &quot;Adventure 2&quot; characters have roughly equal gameplay time.

Iizuka said &quot;Adventure 2&quot; was designed to have &quot;more of an American flavor&quot; than &quot;Adventure&quot;, since it was developed in the US. The art director, Kazuyuki Hoshino, noted Sonic was a character designed to appeal to Western sensibilities, and working in the US allowed Sonic Team USA to capture an American atmosphere more successfully. The levels, drawn from Maekawa&#x27;s story and setting, were inspired by American locations such as Yosemite National Park (where the team vacationed) and the San Francisco Bay Area. Iizuka said they did not intend to &quot;create a simulation of San Francisco&quot; but rather to reflect the influence of their surroundings. The staff frequently received parking tickets from authorities; as a joke, they included the authorities&#x27; cars in a level where Sonic could destroy them. The month &quot;Adventure 2&quot; was to be released to manufacturing, one artist suggested adding Green Hill Zone, the original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; first stage. Iizuka liked the idea but expected the rest of the team to object, so he, the artist, and a programmer spent a week working on it separately.

Among Sonic Team USA&#x27;s goals were a frame rate of 60 frames per second (FPS) to make the gameplay feel faster and a multiplayer mode. Achieving 60 FPS required some design tweaks, but Naka said Sonic Team&#x27;s experience with the Dreamcast hardware made it possible. He felt that by then, Sonic Team had &quot;gotten to the point where we can tap the full power of the console and deliver a much better experience to users&quot;. Sonic Team USA gave Sonic more abilities, such as grinding on rails, to add rhythm to ensure the gameplay was not only about speed. Sega collaborated with Soap, a company that produced shoes with plastic concavities in the sole for rail grinding, to have Sonic wear a pair of Soap shoes rather than his traditional boots. Soap product placement appears throughout the game as well. Like &quot;Adventure&quot;, Sonic Team USA included Chao to add replay value. Iizuka described the Chao as a &quot;relatively neutral entity&quot; in &quot;Adventure&quot;, so in &quot;Adventure 2&quot;, Sonic Team USA added the ability to raise &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Dark&quot; Chao to reflect the conflict between good and evil. Sonic Team USA gave Chao the ability to socialize and interact, which Naka felt &quot;took [them] a step closer to a real artificial life form&quot;.

===Music===

&quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; soundtrack was composed by Jun Senoue, Fumie Kumatani, Tomoya Ohtani, and Kenichi Tokoi, with Senoue as the lead composer and sound director. Senoue, Kumatani and Tokoi returned from &quot;Adventure&quot;, while Ohtani made his first contributions to a &quot;Sonic&quot; game. Senoue began writing in April 2000; he worked closely with Sonic Team USA regarding &quot;Adventure 2&quot; structure, design, and characters. Half the music was produced in the US, while the other half was produced in Japan. Like Iizuka, Senoue considered &quot;Adventure 2&quot; his favorite &quot;Sonic&quot; game to work on, as he found working with a small team in a new environment invigorating.

Senoue wanted the soundtrack to stand out rather than merely serve as background music. He was not entirely satisfied with the first &quot;Adventure&quot; soundtrack, feeling some tracks did not fit, and sought to compose music that suited the atmosphere of each area. He said the music team made a pact &quot;to write songs that promoted the game&#x27;s speed and situations while keeping the best tempo of the stage&quot;. They decided to compose each character&#x27;s level themes in a different genre and divided the work by which genre each composer was most interested in. For instance, Knuckles&#x27; stages feature rap music composed by Ohtani, who wanted to focus on a new musical element. Tokoi said the soundtrack explores more genres than the first game&#x27;s, and other genres include pop-punk, glam metal, and orchestral arrangements.

Singers featured in the soundtrack include Johnny Gioeli of Hardline, Ted Poley of Danger Danger, Tony Harnell of TNT, and Paul Shortino of Rough Cutt. The soundtrack is divided into level-specific tracks and character themes, with leitmotifs similar to professional wrestler entrance music. Senoue reused most of the character theme lyrics from the first &quot;Adventure&quot;, but wrote new music. As Crush 40, he and Gioeli produced the main theme, &quot;Live &amp; Learn&quot;. Senoue recorded the introduction for the &quot;Adventure 2&quot; demo; he worked on the rest later and completed it within a day, while Gioeli wrote the lyrics. Senoue then sent a demo to Gioeli to record his vocals. Gioeli, who was paid 3,000 for his work, said that he managed the recording and composition based on Senoue&#x27;s demos. played bass and Katsuji Kirita of Gargoyle and the Cro-Magnons played drums. Poley wrote and performed &quot;Escape from the City&quot;, the first level&#x27;s theme. He found writing video game music different, as &quot;you have to have a lot of action and alliteration. It creates a whole mood and there&#x27;s no time for breath—the song is over in a minute and a half, and it&#x27;s intense.&quot; The rapper Hunnid-P performed Knuckles&#x27; level themes.

Senoue made a demo for each track using an ADAT system to track guitars or vocals and a Yamaha digital console or Mackie analog mixer for mixing. He edited tracks with his Macintosh before testing them in-game. Once Senoue was satisfied and received Sonic Team USA&#x27;s approval, he finished sequencing and sent demos to prepare for the recording sessions. The soundtrack was recorded across five sessions in Los Angeles, New York City and Tokyo. While he enjoyed studio work, Senoue described the last three months as chaotic, as he had to travel between Tokyo, San Francisco and Los Angeles within weeks to write and record music. Senoue finished the soundtrack in February 2001, after which he worked on the sound effects.

==Release==
===Marketing===
Sega announced &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; at E3 in May 2000 with a trailer premiere behind closed doors and a press release. &quot;Game Informer&quot; reported that it was 40% complete at that time. Sega released the trailer online when it launched Sonic Team&#x27;s website on June 30, and allowed journalists to play a demo version in December. Early copies of Sonic Team&#x27;s &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;, released in Japan in December and worldwide in January 2001, were bundled with the demo. It features the opening cutscene and level, ending with a trailer showcasing later levels. Sega showcased &quot;Adventure 2&quot; again at E3 2001.

On June 13, Archie Comics published a brief adaptation in its &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic book, written by Karl Bollers and penciled by Patrick Spaziante. According to Ken Penders, one of the series&#x27; writers, the creative team was unable to adapt the story in full due to Sonic Team&#x27;s desire for secrecy; they were only able to work from the demo and a few screenshots. Penders said they considered adapting the story in a separate &quot;Super Special&quot; issue, but Archie had ceased publishing one-shots at the time.

&quot;Adventure 2&quot; was initially set to be released in February 2001, but was delayed to June 19 in North America and June 23 in other countries. The worldwide release coincided with &quot;Sonic&quot; tenth anniversary, and Sega marked the occasion in its marketing. In Japan, Sega offered a limited edition &quot;Birthday Pack&quot; for two days that included the game, a gold disc containing &quot;Sonic&quot; music, a commemorative gold coin, and a 17-page booklet detailing the series&#x27; history. On June 30, Sega held a celebration at a Software Etc. in San Jose, California, where attendees could have birthday cake, partake in giveaways, and receive Naka&#x27;s autograph.

===GameCube port===

&quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; was released during a tumultuous period in Sega&#x27;s history. Amidst competition from Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s PlayStation 2, a lack of support from important third-party developers, and conflict within Sega, Dreamcast sales failed to meet Sega&#x27;s expectations. Peter Moore, the president and chief operating officer of Sega of America, said the Dreamcast would need to sell five million units in the US by the end of 2000 to remain a viable platform, but Sega fell short of this goal with three million units sold. Moreover, Sega&#x27;s attempts to spur sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses. On January 31, 2001, Sega announced it was discontinuing the Dreamcast to become a third-party developer, although it remained committed to releasing first-party Dreamcast software through 2001. The third-party transition made &quot;Adventure 2&quot; one of the last major Dreamcast exclusives and the final &quot;Sonic&quot; game for a Sega console.

In April 2001, Sega announced Sonic Team was working on a game for Nintendo&#x27;s GameCube. Sonic Team kept the project a secret until its reveal at Nintendo Space World in August. Naka liked the GameCube hardware, and advised Sonic Team fans to purchase GameCubes. Shortly before Space World, Sega confirmed rumors that the project was a port of &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, subtitled &quot;Battle&quot;. This marked &quot;Sonic&quot; first appearance on a Nintendo console, which &quot;GameSpot&quot; called &quot;an unbelievable milestone of epic proportions&quot;. Sonic Team left the single-player gameplay mostly unchanged, but added multiplayer options such as new maps and characters. &quot;Battle&quot; replaces the VMU&#x27;s implementation with connectivity with the Game Boy Advance (GBA) game &quot;Sonic Advance&quot; (2001), facilitated through the GameCube – GBA link cable. Visually, &quot;Battle&quot; features texture resolution increases, though some textures are blurrier, while colors are brighter. &quot;Battle&quot; was released in Japan on December 20, 2001, in North America on February 11, 2002, in Europe on May 3, 2002, and in Australia on May 17, 2002.

===Sales===
The Dreamcast version of &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; sold more than 84,000 copies during its first week in Japan (a franchise record), and a total of around 500,000 copies worldwide. &quot;The Escapist&quot; wrote that these numbers were impressive given that the Dreamcast had already been discontinued. The GameCube version was significantly more successful. In Japan, it sold almost 50,000 copies during its first month, and had sold 192,186 by December 23, 2002. In North America, it was the bestselling GameCube game between January and August 2002, selling 465,000 copies. By August 2002, it had sold more than a million copies worldwide. Cumulative sales reached 1.7 million, and by July 2006, it had earned $44 million in the US. According to &quot;Next Generation,&quot; it was the 42nd-bestselling game for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, or Xbox between January 2000 and July 2006 in the US. It is one of the bestselling GameCube games and the bestselling third-party GameCube game.

== Reception ==
&quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews. Critics appreciated its multiple playing styles. According to &quot;Edge&quot; and Four-Eyed Dragon of &quot;GamePro&quot;, the three styles and bonus features such as Chao gardens were engaging. Johnny Liu of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; praised its replay value of multiple playing styles and 180 different goals. Anthony Chau of &quot;IGN&quot; called it one of the best &quot;Sonic&quot; games: &quot;If this is the last &quot;Sonic&quot; game in these declining Dreamcast years, it&#x27;s satisfying to know that the DC didn&#x27;t go out with a bang, but with a sonic boom.&quot; In 2022, &quot;IGN&quot; named it one of the best Dreamcast games.

The camera was panned. Shahed Ahmed of &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized the &quot;cardinal sin&quot; of 3D platform games: forcing players to jump to an out-of-frame platform. Although players can re-orient the camera with the trigger buttons, it reverts when the character moves. According to Chau and Liu, this made searching cramped sections of Knuckles&#x27; and Rouge&#x27;s levels frustrating. &quot;Edge&quot; found camera problems permeating the game, with no significant improvement from &quot;Adventure&quot;.

The visuals received positive reviews. Liu called them &quot;sweet, sweet eye-crack&quot;. Four-Eyed Dragon wrote that the game &quot;is simply jaw-dropping beautiful,&quot; citing its detailed backgrounds and scenery and the characters&#x27; extensive color palettes. According to Chau, the game had &quot;some of the best textures ever seen&quot; and was one of the most beautiful Dreamcast games. &quot;Edge&quot; was impressed by the texture detail and draw distance, and Chau, Liu and Ahmed praised its 60-frame-per-second rendering speed.

Senoue&#x27;s soundtrack also received positive reviews. According to Ahmed, the music was an improvement over &quot;Adventure&quot; &quot;campy glam-rock and J-pop soundtrack&quot;, with less emphasis on lyrics, while Liu appreciated its more &quot;understated&quot; approach. Four-Eyed Dragon called the music &quot;an eclectic mix of orchestrated masterpieces, guitar tunes, and melodic hip-hop voices&quot; that &quot;gracefully fill the game&#x27;s ambiance to a perfect pitch.&quot; Reactions to the voice acting were divided; according to Ahmed, &quot;the voice acting, and the lip-synching in particular, is executed quite well,&quot; and Liu and Chau found the English voices inferior to the Japanese ones.

The plot was derided, although its presentation was well received. Ahmed wrote, &quot;Throughout the game the plot becomes more and more scattered and lackluster,&quot; not focusing long enough on one element to execute it meaningfully. Although Liu agreed that despite the game&#x27;s ambitious scope and themes it failed to advance the series&#x27; core plot beyond the Sega Genesis &quot;Sonic&quot; games, &quot;Edge&quot; appreciated the story&#x27;s presentation from both perspectives: hero and villain.

Despite high review scores for the Dreamcast version, the GameCube version released six months later received mixed reviews: respective Metacritic and GameRankings scores of 73 percent and 72.33 percent. Critics generally felt that it was not significantly improved from the Dreamcast original. However, Shane Bettenhausen of &quot;GameSpy&quot; saw &quot;Adventure 2 Battle&quot; as noticeably superior; in addition to its upgrades, its action was better suited to the GameCube&#x27;s controller than the Dreamcast&#x27;s.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; received several accolades, including the 2001 &quot;IGN&quot;″s Editors&#x27; Choice Award. &quot;ScrewAttack&quot; called it the fifth-best Dreamcast game, and &quot;GamesRadar&quot; rated it the tenth-greatest Dreamcast game out of 25: &quot;Despite trailing off significantly in recent years, the 3D side of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise had a surprisingly stellar start with the &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; entries, and the 2001 sequel really amped up the action.&quot; In February 2014, &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Luke Karmali called &quot;Battle&quot; his tenth-favorite game of all time. In a video interview with Sonic Team studio head Takashi Iizuka, he says &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; is his favourite game in the series.

==Post-release==
Development on the next game, &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; (2003), began at Sonic Team USA shortly after &quot;Adventure 2&quot; completion. Iizuka chose to develop it as a standalone game rather than a sequel to appeal to a broader audience. &quot;Heroes&quot; became the first multiplatform &quot;Sonic&quot; game when it was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox in late 2003. Another 2003 Sonic Team game, &quot;Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg&quot;, uses an updated version of the &quot;Adventure 2&quot; engine, and Ohtani, who first composed &quot;Sonic&quot; music for &quot;Adventure 2&quot;, became the series&#x27; sound director with &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (2006).

Sega&#x27;s discontinuation of the Dreamcast made &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; the last &quot;Sonic&quot; game that Sonic Team—which had worked with Sega hardware teams to take advantage of their consoles—produced with the benefits of first-party development. Whereas &quot;Adventure 2&quot; had been made using proprietary software, Sonic Team USA partnered with Criterion Software to use RenderWare so &quot;Heroes&quot; could be programmed and ported across platforms. Iizuka described the loss of first-party development benefits as the greatest challenge of the third-party transition, as his team &quot;no longer [had] the ability to control what we need[ed] to make our games&quot;. Naka said he had mixed feelings about &quot;Sonic&quot; as a multiplatform franchise, and departed to form his own studio, Prope, in 2006.

Shadow quickly proved popular among fans, so Sonic Team USA retconned his apparent death in &quot;Adventure 2&quot; finale to include him in subsequent &quot;Sonic&quot; games, beginning with &quot;Heroes&quot;. After &quot;Heroes&quot;, Sonic Team USA was renamed Sega Studios USA. Their next project was &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; (2005), a spin-off starring Shadow that continues plot threads established in &quot;Adventure 2&quot;. The division developed &quot;&quot; (2007) before it was merged back into the Japanese Sonic Team in 2008. Iizuka became the head of Sonic Team following the merger.

=== Soundtracks ===
Marvelous Entertainment released a collection of &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; songs, &quot;Cuts Unleashed Sonic Adventure 2 Vocal Collection&quot;, on August 18, 2001, before releasing the full two-disc soundtrack album, &quot;Multi-dimensional Sonic Adventure 2 Original Sound Track&quot;, on September 5. Tokyopop released a soundtrack in the US on February 5, 2002, ahead of the GameCube version&#x27;s release, featuring 26 tracks selected by Senoue and US-exclusive remixes. On November 30, 2011, Sega released the soundtrack on iTunes via its Wave Master label to coincide with the franchise&#x27;s 20th anniversary. Brave Wave Productions released a vinyl version of the soundtrack including interviews with Senoue and Iizuka in 2018.

=== Rerelease ===
Sega released a port of &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; as a downloadable game for the PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) and Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) on October 2, 2012, and for Windows (via Steam) on November 20. The port followed a similar reissue of the first &quot;Adventure&quot; in 2010 and was branded as part of Sega Heritage, a 2012 initiative in which Sega rereleased popular games from its back catalog on modern consoles. The rerelease features high-definition graphics and widescreen support, though some cutscenes are still presented in 4:3. Otherwise, it is mostly identical to the original versions; it lacks the Dreamcast version&#x27;s online features and the GameCube additions are paywalled as downloadable content (DLC). In 2017, the PlayStation 3 version was made playable on the PlayStation 4 and Windows via the cloud gaming service PlayStation Now, and the Xbox 360 version was made backward compatible with the Xbox One.

== Legacy ==
=== Retrospective assessments ===
&quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; is frequently ranked among the best &quot;Sonic&quot; games. &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;Kotaku&quot; deemed it a satisfying conclusion to &quot;Sonic&quot; run on Sega hardware, and &quot;Game Informer&quot; considered it a worthy sequel to &quot;Adventure&quot;. However, journalists have characterized &quot;Adventure 2&quot; as divisive, and the 2012 rerelease received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; according to Metacritic. Some fans regard &quot;Adventure 2&quot; as the franchise&#x27;s pinnacle, but others find it unfocused—&quot;a jack of all trades, master of none&quot;, as &quot;The Escapist&quot; wrote. According to &quot;The Escapist&quot;, &quot;depending on who you ask, [it] represent[s] the franchise at its best and at its worst.&quot;

Common elements of retrospective praise include Sonic and Shadow&#x27;s levels, the Chao Garden, and the soundtrack. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; felt &quot;Adventure 2&quot; increased speed and emphasis on spectacle positively influenced the series. Conversely, its focus on multiple characters with different gameplay styles has been divisive. While &quot;IGN&quot; praised the gameplay variety, &quot;Kotaku&quot; noted that many only like the Sonic and Shadow levels; retrospective reviewers have criticized the other characters as frustrating and cumbersome. &quot;Game Informer&quot; found Tails and Eggman&#x27;s levels fine, but Knuckles and Rouge&#x27;s annoying. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; disagreed, writing Knuckles and Rouge were &quot;entertaining enough&quot; while Tails and Eggman were &quot;rubbish&quot;. To &quot;TechRadar&quot;, the gameplay variety meant the quality of levels fluctuated more than it did in &quot;Adventure&quot;, though Sonic and Shadow&#x27;s levels were a significant improvement. &quot;Kotaku&quot; appreciated the other characters&#x27; levels for their immersion, despite their poor quality.

Additional criticism has been directed at the camera for obscuring enemies and platforms, poor voice acting and audio mixing, and the story. The audio mixing, in which characters&#x27; dialogue in cutscenes frequently overlaps, has been described as infamous. &quot;The Escapist&quot; and &quot;VentureBeat&quot; called the story nonsensical, &quot;Destructoid&quot; said it &quot;almost feels like work to get through&quot;, and &quot;Vice&quot; jokingly compared it to a Bob Books take on &quot;Armageddon&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; felt the plot would have been interesting were it not for the plot holes caused by events playing out differently across campaigns. However, &quot;VentureBeat&quot; praised the good-vs.-evil presentation as clever and adding unexpected nuance to the villains&#x27; motivations, and &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; said the story was one of &quot;Sonic&quot; best despite some melodramatic moments. They highlighted the scene in which Eggman destroys the Moon as considerably more impactful than his schemes in later games.

&quot;VentureBeat&quot; wrote that &quot;Adventure 2&quot; did not hold up to modern standards, finding its camera and reliance on trial-and-error design outdated, and &quot;Destructoid&quot; said it was only redeemed by how engaging the Chao Garden was. A &quot;Vice&quot; writer, while playing &quot;Adventure 2&quot; for the first time in a decade, said that &quot;[I&#x27;ve] been forced to reconcile my nostalgia with the harsh reality that it is not a terrific game&quot;. &quot;VentureBeat&quot; wrote that it was more worth remembering for its historical significance as the last &quot;Sonic&quot; game for a Sega console than it was worth replaying. Others conceded that &quot;Adventure 2&quot; is flawed, but argued this was negated by its merits. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; said &quot;Adventure 2&quot; many &quot;bizarre design choices&quot; made it endearing, and &quot;Kotaku&quot; said it &quot;felt equal parts triumphant and bittersweet... &quot;Adventure 2&quot; has plenty of flaws, but you can tell Sonic Team was working hard to build off the best parts of its previous &quot;Adventure&quot; and play out Sega’s home console era with style.&quot;

Following &quot;Adventure 2&quot;, &quot;Sonic&quot; critical standing began to decline, which &quot;VentureBeat&quot; attributed to Sega &quot;depending on stupid gimmicks to sell their most iconic property&quot; following the third-party transition. &quot;The Escapist&quot; wrote that subsequent &quot;Sonic&quot; games, such as &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot; (2008), and &quot;Sonic Forces&quot; (2017), attempted to replicate the &quot;Adventure 2&quot; format of varied gameplay styles, but failed because they did not develop each style fully. &quot;VentureBeat&quot; said &quot;Adventure 2&quot; alternate gameplay styles were natural additions to &quot;Sonic&quot; whereas those in subsequent games, such as &quot;Unleashed&quot; Werehog segments and &quot;Sonic and the Black Knight&quot; (2009) swordplay, were not.

=== City Escape ===

&quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; first level, City Escape, has been described as one of the best opening stages in a video game. The level, which serves as a tutorial, depicts Sonic as he escapes GUN and features sequences in which he snowboards through streets and outruns a murderous truck. &quot;Red Bull&quot; said it was &quot;unquestionably &quot;Sonic&quot; finest hour since the [Genesis] days&quot;, and &quot;Destructoid&quot; called it a perfect introduction to modern &quot;Sonic&quot; gameplay that encapsulates the strengths of the &quot;Adventure&quot; games. &quot;USgamer&quot; wrote that &quot;Adventure 2&quot; is remembered more for City Escape than anything else, and &quot;Polygon&quot; said that it &quot;represents the epitome of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. It&#x27;s fast-paced, full of secret pathways, and more than a little absurd.&quot;

&quot;Polygon&quot; considered &quot;Escape from the City&quot;, the City Escape theme song, the peak of the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise, with an energetic composition and hopeful lyrics that encapsulate Sonic&#x27;s character. The song was remixed in &quot;Sonic Generations&quot; (2011) and featured in the &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series of crossover games. Senoue and the band Hyper Potions produced an Irish-themed remix for a collaboration between Jacksepticeye and the &quot;Sonic&quot; social media team on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day 2020. Sega produced two remixes in 2021: a Sonic 30th Anniversary Symphony remix in June and a funk remix in December. The original is a selectable song in Sega&#x27;s &quot;Samba de Amigo: Party Central&quot; (2023), a rhythm game which includes a City Escape-based stage. Poley described &quot;Escape from the City&quot; as his biggest hit, though he does not receive any royalties.

&quot;Generations&quot;, which commemorates the franchise&#x27;s 20th anniversary, features reimagined versions of levels from past &quot;Sonic&quot; games, including 2D and 3D reimaginings of City Escape. The 2D version features the &quot;Classic&quot; iteration of Sonic racing the truck as it moves between the background and foreground, while the 3D version features shortcuts that take advantage of &quot;Generations&quot; mechanics. &quot;Kotaku&quot; regarded &quot;Generations&quot; City Escape as one of the most impactful moments of 2011, and &quot;PCMag&quot; considered it a highlight, a &quot;prime example&quot; of Sonic Team drawing inspiration from the franchise&#x27;s history.

=== Influence ===
&quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; GameCube port introduced &quot;Sonic&quot; to a new audience of Millennials and, alongside the compilation &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; (2002), built a new fanbase following Sega&#x27;s third-party transition. For this reason, &quot;The Escapist&quot; regarded it as possibly the most important &quot;Sonic&quot; game and said that while some later &quot;Sonic&quot; games were better, &quot;[they] didn’t do nearly as much to energize or even create a new fanbase&quot;. Additionally, the GameCube port paved the way for a closer relationship between Sega and Nintendo after a decade of console war hostility. Several subsequent &quot;Sonic&quot; games were exclusive to Nintendo platforms and Sonic appeared alongside Nintendo&#x27;s mascot Mario in the &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; games.

Sonic Team continued the gameplay style established by the &quot;Adventure&quot; games in &quot;Heroes&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; before going in a new direction with &quot;Unleashed&quot;, which was conceived as a sequel to &quot;Adventure 2&quot; before becoming a standalone game. &quot;Adventure 2&quot; emphasis on spectacle influenced subsequent &quot;Sonic&quot; games. It was the first &quot;Sonic&quot; game to feature rail grinding, a mechanic used in nearly every subsequent &quot;Sonic&quot; game. &quot;Sonic Frontiers&quot; (2022) features levels that recreate the layouts of the &quot;Adventure 2&quot; stages Metal Harbor, Green Forest, and Sky Rail, and Sonic&#x27;s Soap shoes are available as DLC. &quot;Sonic&quot; fans have requested &quot;Adventure 3&quot;, but Iizuka said this would not advance the series&#x27; design.

According to &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, Shadow is the most famous modern &quot;Sonic&quot; character. He returned as a playable character in &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Sonic and the Black Knight&quot;, and &quot;Forces&quot;. In 2005, Naka said Sonic Team had determined Shadow was the most popular &quot;Sonic&quot; character excluding Sonic himself, a finding reaffirmed in a 2009 Sega poll. &quot;Sonic Generations&quot; includes Shadow as a boss, and the Nintendo 3DS version includes the Biolizard boss. A 2024 &quot;Generations&quot; rerelease was bundled with &quot;Shadow Generations&quot;, a Shadow game that features recreations of &quot;Adventure 2&quot; levels and bosses. Rouge also became a recurring character; a 2006 Sega poll found her the tenth-most-popular &quot;Sonic&quot; character.

&quot;Live &amp; Learn&quot; remains a popular &quot;Sonic&quot; song. It has appeared in at least 25 games since &quot;Adventure 2&quot;, including non-&quot;Sonic&quot; games such as the &quot;Maimai&quot;, &quot;Phantasy Star&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, and &quot;Yakuza&quot; series. Crush 40 performed a remix featuring the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as the finale of the Sonic 30th Anniversary Symphony. In 2024, Gioeli filed a lawsuit against Sega for breach of contract regarding the ownership of &quot;Live &amp; Learn&quot;; he said that he was unaware that Sega kept reusing the song, to which he holds the copyright. He sought 500,000 in damages and another 500,000 in unpaid royalties for its use outside of &quot;Adventure 2&quot;.

===Adaptations===
&quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; was adapted in the second season of the anime series &quot;Sonic X&quot; (2003–2006). The Japanese voice cast reprised their roles for the adaptation, while the licensing corporation 4Kids Entertainment, which handled the American localization, hired a new voice cast for the English dub. Although Archie Comics did not adapt &quot;Adventure 2&quot; in full in its &quot;Sonic&quot; comic, it did so in the second issue of the spin-off publication &quot;Sonic Universe&quot; in March 2009; the adaptation was written by Ian Flynn and penciled by Tracy Yardley and Steven Butler.

The live-action feature film &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (2024) is an adaptation of &quot;Adventure 2&quot;. It features several scenes that reference &quot;Adventure 2&quot;, such as Shadow&#x27;s captivity in a GUN facility, Sonic leaping out of a helicopter, and Sonic and Shadow collaborating to stop the Eclipse Cannon. &quot;Live &amp; Learn&quot; is featured throughout as a leitmotif before the song itself plays during the climax. Although it mostly follows &quot;Adventure 2&quot; story, it features some differences, such as the absence of City Escape and Gerald Robotnik appearing alive in the present rather than being limited to flashbacks. The writers, Pat Casey and Josh Miller, did not have time to replay &quot;Adventure 2&quot; while writing and based the adaptation on what they remembered most.

<doc id="336543" wikidata="Q662635" url="?curid=336543" title="Passion (Peter Gabriel album)">
<text>Passion (re-released as Passion: Music for The Last Temptation of Christ) is an album released in 1989 by the English singer-songwriter Peter Gabriel. It was the first Peter Gabriel album to be released on Real World Records, Gabriel&#x27;s second soundtrack, and his eighth album overall.

&quot;Passion&quot; was originally composed as the soundtrack album for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s film &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), but Gabriel spent several months after the film&#x27;s release further developing the music, finally releasing it as a full-fledged album instead of a movie soundtrack. The album was released in June 1989 (almost a year after the theatrical release of &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; in August 1988) as a vinyl double album and a 1-disc CD.

Later in the year, a companion album was released, &quot;Passion – Sources&quot;, featuring additional songs on which Gabriel does not perform. Gabriel described this album as &quot;a selection of some of the traditional music, sources of inspiration, and location recordings.&quot;

&quot;Passion&quot; is seen as a landmark in the popularisation of world music, and won a Grammy Award for Best New Age Album in 1990. It was remastered with most of Gabriel&#x27;s catalogue in 2002.

==Overview==
Peter Gabriel&#x27;s first film soundtrack, &quot;Birdy&quot; (1985), contained instrumental rearrangements of songs from Gabriel&#x27;s earlier albums. &quot;Passion&quot;, on the other hand, contained music entirely original to Gabriel&#x27;s catalogue.

To record the soundtrack for &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;, Gabriel used the resources of WOMAD, an organization he founded, to bring together musicians from the Middle East, Africa, Europe and South Asia. He worked with them to create music meant to enhance the mood of the film, but he also added a modern ambient musical touch to the original pieces, producing a musical work that has influenced many musicians. &quot;Passion&quot; introduced many listeners to such artists as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, L. Shankar, and Baaba Maal. N&#x27;Dour and Shankar had provided contributions to Gabriel&#x27;s previous album, &quot;So&quot; (1986); &quot;Passion&quot; also features other musicians who had worked with Gabriel before, including David Rhodes, Manny Elias, David Bottrill, and Manu Katché.

The delay of the album&#x27;s release was due to Gabriel’s schedule with the &quot;Human Rights Now!&quot; tour for Amnesty International in 1988 and to the truncated production time allotted by Universal Pictures for the soundtrack: Universal cut the recording time for Gabriel from 10 to three weeks, leaving Gabriel very little time to complete all the pieces he wanted. After the film&#x27;s mix was finished, Gabriel had unfinished ideas he wanted to develop and took extra time to complete the album. Gabriel took a further four months to complete &quot;Passion&quot;, building the pieces and developing the musical textures as part of his stated desire for the album to stand as a piece of work in its own right.

&quot;With This Love&quot; began with a vocal melody developed by Gabriel. He then worked with David Sancious, who built an arrangement around the song and suggested some harmonies to accompany it. &quot;With This Love&quot;, which Gabriel described as &quot;church-like&quot;, was originally intended for a scene where the devil, disguised as a little girl, removes Jesus from a cross and kisses his bleeding body. However, Scorsese decided against using the song for this scene. Gabriel attributed this decision to his belief that the scene would have been &quot;perhaps too powerful&quot; and &quot;potentially too explosive&quot;, but still felt that it would have been a &quot;very strong marriage of music and image.&quot;

The cover art for the album, &quot;Drawing study for Self Image II&quot; (1987), is a mixed media composition by the artist Julian Grater. When re-released, the album was titled &quot;Passion: Music for The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; due to &quot;legal barriers&quot; according to Gabriel in its liner notes.

==Reception==
Upon its release, &quot;Passion&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Reviewing &quot;Passion&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jimmy Guterman wrote that &quot;Gabriel’s journey is just as deeply felt as Scorsese&#x27;s... [&quot;Passion&quot;] stands as a testament to the breadth of Gabriel&#x27;s interests, as well as his talents.&quot; Noting songs which &quot;successfully accommodate third-world melodies and cross-rhythms in a Western pop context,&quot; Guterman claimed, &quot;&quot;Passion&quot; is stirring, stunning stuff: You won’t hear it on the radio like you heard ‘’Sledgehammer’’ or ‘’Big Time’’, but if you do search it out, you&#x27;ll find a piece of work by an artist who remains idiosyncratic without being obtuse.&quot;

<doc id="336544" wikidata="Q175276" url="?curid=336544" title="Kingdom of León">
<text>The Kingdom of León was an independent kingdom situated in the northwest region of the Iberian Peninsula. It was founded in 910 when the Christian princes of Asturias along the northern coast of the peninsula shifted their capital from Oviedo to the city of León. The kings of León fought civil wars, wars against neighbouring kingdoms, and campaigns to repel invasions by both the Moors and the Vikings, all in order to protect their kingdom&#x27;s changing fortunes.

García is the first of the kings described by the charters as reigning in León. It is generally assumed that the old Asturian kingdom was divided among the three sons of Alfonso III of Asturias: García (León), Ordoño (Galicia) and Fruela (Asturias), as all three participated in deposing their father. When García died in 914, León went to Ordoño, who now ruled both León and Galicia as Ordoño II. At Ordoño&#x27;s death in 924, the throne went to his brother Fruela II (924–925), who died of leprosy a year later. Fruela&#x27;s death in 925 was followed by a civil war, after which Alfonso, the eldest son of Ordoño II, emerged as the new king Alfonso IV, ruling from 925 to 932. After a further power struggle, Ramiro, the younger brother of Alfonso IV, became king in 932, having captured his brother Alfonso, as well as the three sons of Fruela II – Alfonso, Ordoño and Ramiro. Alfonso IV may have died soon after, but he left two infant sons, called Ordoño and Fruela. When Ramiro died in 951, he left two sons by two different wives. When the elder son Ordoño III, who ruled from 951 to 956, suddenly died aged little more than thirty, he was succeeded by his younger half-brother Sancho I &quot;The Fat&quot; (956–966), as Ordoño had failed to produce a legitimate heir.

Sancho&#x27;s son Ramiro had been born in 961 and was only about five years old when his father died. He was also the only legitimate member of the direct family line. His mother Teresa Ansúrez had retired into the recently founded monastery of San Pelayo, of which her sister-in-law Elvira was the abbess. Another nun, Sancho&#x27;s full sister Elvira Ramírez emerged as regent during his long minority. Under the regency of Elvira, fresh raids of the Northmen were repelled from the coast of Galicia. In 968, Gunrod of Norway, the Viking leader, established himself on Galician soil and held out for a year and a half: Bishop Sisnando of Compostela died fighting him, and his successor St Rudesind carried on the struggle until Count Gonzalo Sánchez defeated the invaders and killed Gunrod himself. Count Sánchez destroyed the entire fleet of Gunrod. In 1008, Norman Vikings attacked Galicia, destroying Santiago de Compostela and seventeen other towns, while Olaf Haraldsson of Norway raided Spain&#x27;s Atlantic coast. There are also reports of a series of attacks on the Christian lands of north Spain in 1028, 1032, and 1038, and the Christian kingdoms in the north commonly used Vikings as mercenaries in their internecine wars.

The County of Castile split off in 931, the County of Portugal separated to become the independent Kingdom of Portugal in 1139. The Kingdom of León expanded south beyond the Douro, and then beyond the Sistema Central in the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries into the so-called , whose southern frontier was primarily settled by military orders. The Kingdom of León became part of a personal union with Kingdom of Castile since the 1230s, in dispute from 1296 to 1300. It remained from then on and up to 1833 a constituent realm of the Crown of Castile and then the Spanish Crown.

== Background ==
The city of León was founded by the Legio VII Gemina (&quot;twin seventh legion&quot;) of the Roman Empire. It was the headquarters of that legion in the Late Roman Empire and was a centre for trade in gold, which was mined at Las Médulas nearby. In 569, the city was conquered by the Arian Visigothic king Liuvigild, who did not harass the already well-established Catholic population. In 717, León fell again, this time to the Moors. However, León was one of the first cities retaken during the Reconquista and became part of the Kingdom of Asturias in 742.

León was a small town during this time, but one of the few former Roman cities in the Kingdom of Asturias which still held significance (the surviving Roman walls bear the medieval walling upon them). During Visigothic times, the city had served as a bishopric, and incorporating the city into Asturias brought legitimacy to the Asturian monarchs who sought to lead a unified Iberian church, during a time when most of the Iberian Peninsula was governed by Muslim powers.

== History ==
León was created as a separate kingdom when the Asturian king, Alfonso the Great, divided his realm among his three sons. León was inherited by García I (910–914) who moved the capital of the kingdom of Astures to León. His successor was Ordoño II of León (914–924). Ordoño II was also a military leader who brought expeditions from León south to Seville, Córdoba, and Guadalajara, in the heart of the Muslim territory.
After a few years of civil wars during the reigns of Fruela II, Alfonso Fróilaz and Alfonso IV, Ramiro II (931–951) assumed the throne and brought stability to the kingdom. A brave military commander who defeated the Muslim armies in their own territory, Ramiro&#x27;s expeditions turned the valley of the Douro into a no-man&#x27;s land that separated Christian kingdoms in the north of Iberia from the Muslim states in the south. Ramiro II was nicknamed &quot;The Devil&quot; by Muslims because of his great military skill.

As the Leonese troops advanced they were followed by a process of &quot;repoblación&quot;, which consisted of repopulating the &quot;Meseta&quot; high plains, with people coming from Galicia and especially from Asturias and León. This migration of Asturian and Leonese peoples greatly influenced the Leonese language. During the &quot;repoblación&quot; period, there arose a distinct form of art known as Mozarabic art. Mozarabic art is a mixing of Visigoth, Islamic, and Byzantine elements. Notable examples of the Mozarabic style are the Leonese churches of San Miguel de Escalada and Santiago de Peñalba.

During the early 10th century, León expanded to the south and east, securing territory that became the County of Burgos. Fortified with numerous castles, Burgos remained within Leon until the 930s, at which time Count Ferdinand II of Castile began a campaign to expand Burgos and make it independent and hereditary. He took for himself the title Count of Castile, in reference to the many castles of the territory (around Burgos), and continued expanding his area at the expense of León by allying with the Caliphate of Córdoba, until 966, when he was defeated by Sancho I of León.

=== Viking raids ===
Sancho I died towards the end of 966 and five year old Ramiro III (966–982) ascended to the throne of León. In the second year of his reign, 968, a Viking fleet of 100 ships landed in Galicia led by king Gunrod. The Vikings defeated the Galician forces, and killed Sisnando, the bishop of Compostela. The defeat in the Battle of Fornelos left Galicia without an authority capable of facing the Vikings, who for three years camped comfortably, looting different Galician regions. In 971, Gunrod and his Vikings were surprised and defeated by Count Gonzalo Sánchez upon return towards Ría de Ferrol (where they had their stranded ships). The Galician troops captured Gunrod and many of his warriors, executing them all. Sporadic Viking assaults continued in the north of Spain even into the 11th century. In 1008, Galicia and the Douro region were attacked, and in 1014 or 1015 a major raid was launched against the city of Tui at the mouth of the Minho River. The Vikings managed to successfully capture the bishop and many of the town&#x27;s inhabitants. The &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot; and describe another big raid after this one, in the year 1028. It was led by Ulv Galiciefarer, who tried to go to the Riá de Arousa area and then became a mercenary for Rodrigo Romániz, but was defeated by the bishop of Compostela. The last recorded raids occurred during the period 1047–1066 when Cresconius, the bishop of Compostela, fought and won several battles against the Vikings.

=== Peak ===

The Kingdom of León continued to be the most important of all those of the Iberian Peninsula. However, Sancho III of Navarre (1004–1035) took over Castile in the 1020s, and managed León in the last year of his life, leaving Galicia to temporary independence. In the division of lands which followed his death, his son Fernando succeeded to the county of Castile. Two years later, in 1037, he defeated the king of León who died in the battle and, because Fernando was married to the Leonese king&#x27;s sister, he became king of León and Galicia. For nearly 30 years, until his death in 1065, he ruled over the kingdom of León and the county of Castile as Ferdinand I of León.

Early in its existence, León lay directly to the north of the powerful Caliphate of Córdoba. When internal dissensions divided Al-Andalus&#x27; loyalties in the 11th century, leading to the age of smaller Taifa successor states of the Caliphate, the Christian kingdoms, who had been sending tribute to the Caliphate, found themselves in a position to demand payments (&quot;parias&quot;) instead, in return for favours to particular factions or as simple extortion.

Thus, though scarcely influenced by the culture of the successor territories of the former Caliphate, Ferdinand I followed the example of the counts of Barcelona and the kings of Aragon and became hugely wealthy from the &quot;parias&quot; of the Taifas. When he died in 1065, his territories and the &quot;parias&quot; were split among his three sons, of whom Alfonso emerged the victor in the classic fratricidal strife common to feudal successions.

Few in Europe would have known of this immense new wealth in a kingdom so isolated that its bishops had virtually no contact with Rome, except that Ferdinand and his heirs (the kings of León and Castile) became the greatest benefactors of the Abbey of Cluny, where Abbot Hugh (died 1109) undertook construction of the huge third abbey church, the of every eye. The Way of Saint James called pilgrims from Western Europe to the supposed tomb of Saint James the Great in Santiago de Compostela, and the large hostels and churches along the route encouraged building in the Romanesque style.

Alfonso VI was one of the most important kings of León of the Middle Ages. He assumed control of first León, and later Castile and Galicia, when his brother died attacking the Leonese city of Zamora. He was crowned Emperor of Spain over all the kings of the Iberian Peninsula.

=== León and Castile ===
The 1085 taking of Toledo by Alfonso VI of León was seen as an epochal event in medieval Iberia, as Toledo was the first major Andalusi city conquered by Christians. Modern historians see the fall of Toledo as marking a basic change in relations with the Moorish south, turning from the simple extortion of annual tribute to outright territorial expansion. Alfonso VI was drawn into local politics by strife within Toledo and inherited the political alliances of the city-state. He found himself faced with problems unfamiliar to him, such as appointing and dealing with a Catholic bishop in Toledo and the settling of garrisons in the small Muslim strongholds, the &quot;taifas&quot;, which were dependent on Toledo and which often bought the king&#x27;s favour with gold from their trade with Al-Andalus and the Maghreb. Alfonso VI thus found his role as a Catholic king redefined as he governed large cities with sophisticated urban, Muslim subjects and growing Christian populations.

The two kingdoms of León and Castile were split in 1157, when a major defeat for Alfonso VII of Castile weakened the authority of Castile.

The last two kings of an independent Kingdom of León (1157–1230) were Ferdinand II and Alfonso IX. Fernando II led León&#x27;s conquest of Mérida, a city dating from Roman times. Alfonso IX, besides conquering the whole of Extremadura (including the cities of Cáceres and Badajoz), was the most modern king of his time, founding the University of Salamanca in 1212 and summoning in 1188 the first parliament with representation of the citizenry ever seen in Europe, the Cortes of León.

Alfonso IX did not want his kingdom to disappear upon his death and designated his heirs as Sancha and Dulce, the daughters of his first wife. In order to maintain the independence of the Kingdom of León, Afonso IX applied in his testament the Galician right of inheritance, which granted men and women equality in succession, thus leaving his daughters to be the future queens of León. However, when Alfonso IX died in 1230, his son by Berenguela of Castile, Ferdinand III of Castile, invaded León and assumed the crown. He thus became the first joint sovereign of both kingdoms since the death of Alfonso VII in 1157. The isolated Atlantic province, the County of Portugal, had won independence in 1139 to become the Kingdom of Portugal.

The union between León and Castile was not accepted by the Leonese people. King Ferdinand III needed two years to suppress the secessionist revolts in the Kingdom of León, so his son Alfonso X restored the independence of the Kingdom of León. However, this was not respected by his son and successor, Sancho IV, whose brother John waited until 1296, following Sancho&#x27;s death the previous year, to be crowned as John I, King of León, Galicia and Seville. In 1301, he abdicated, and the king of Castile assumed the Crown of León, reuniting the two kingdoms.
Though the kings of Castile and León initially continued to take the title King of León as the superior title, and to use a lion as part of their standard, power in fact became centralized in Castile, as exemplified by the Leonese language&#x27;s replacement by Castilian. The Kingdom of León and the Kingdom of Castile kept different Parliaments, different flags, different coin and different laws until the Modern Era, when Spain, like other European states, centralized governmental power.

== Modern era ==
The Kingdom of León coexisted as a personal union under the Crown of Castile, with León possessing separate institutions, such as its own &quot;cortes&quot;, the &quot;Real Adelantamiento&quot; of the Kingdom of León, and the &quot;Merino mayor&quot; of León, among others, many of which lasted until the 19th century. The Castilian monarchs, however, soon began a process of unifying the laws of the two kingdoms, as exemplified by the Siete Partidas. By the 16th century, León became a captaincy-general.

== 19th century ==
In the 19th century, León declared war, together with Galicia and Asturias, against the First French Empire in the Peninsular War, and organised the &quot;Junta General del Reino de León&quot; as its own government. The modern region of León was established in 1833 and was divided into León, Zamora, and Salamanca provinces.

== Art and architecture ==


The art of the Kingdom of León, originating in the 10th century and flourishing until the European Romanesque period, is characterized by a unique blend of influences, notably from Al-Andalus, resulting in what is traditionally known as Mozarabic art. This artistic expression, rooted in Visigothic and Andalusian traditions, produced structures ranging from modest single-nave churches to elaborate monastic complexes.

Key figures, including monarchs and ecclesiastical leaders, played a pivotal role in shaping this art, with a notable infusion of Andalusian tastes. The art of León during the 9th to 11th centuries successfully merged diverse traditions, creating a distinctive style within the context of pre-Romanesque art. Noteworthy features include a mix of architectural styles, experimentation with various artistic elements like modillions or horseshoe arches, and the use of mural painting techniques influenced by both Roman and Caliphal styles.

In the realm of painting, illuminated manuscripts like the &quot;beatos&quot; exemplify the vibrancy and evolution of Leonese art, incorporating elements from Byzantine-Merovingian influences to an Islamic-Carolingian character.

During the 11th and 12th centuries, the arrival of Romanesque art marked a significant shift in Leonese artistic expression. Masterpieces such as the Basilica of San Isidoro became prominent examples of Romanesque sculpture and painting. This period also laid the foundation for the Romanesque predecessors of the cathedrals of León and Santiago de Compostela. Sculpture, goldsmithing, and heraldry further thrived, with King Alfonso IX pioneering the use of personal emblems, contributing to the visual language of heraldry that became crucial in medieval battles.

== Culture ==

The culture of the Kingdom of León was notable for its richness and diversity, reflecting its position as a political and religious center of Christianity in the Iberian Peninsula. Key Latin literary works such as the &quot;Codex Vigilanus&quot; and the &quot;Historia Legionense&quot; documented the kingdom’s history and helped consolidate its legacy. The Fueros de León (1017), promulgated by Alfonso V, established a legal framework that was advanced for its time, while texts like the &quot;Glosas Emilianenses&quot; marked a significant step in the transition from Latin to Romance languages. Among the earliest proto-Romance texts produced in the Iberian Peninsula was the &quot;Nodicia de kesos&quot;. Another notable work of this period is the &quot;Codex Calixtinus&quot;, a manuscript linked to the Camino de Santiago, which served as a guide for pilgrims and underscored the cultural and spiritual importance of the pilgrimage, reinforcing León’s connection to European Christianity.

Religion played a fundamental role in León’s cultural expression. Monasteries and churches such as San Isidoro de León, Tábara, Samos, and Sahagún became key centers for intellectual and artistic production. At San Isidoro, a renowned &quot;scriptorium&quot; facilitated the copying and dissemination of liturgical, legal, and scientific manuscripts. The transition from the Hispano-Mozarabic rite to the Roman rite after the Council of Burgos (1080) marked a significant shift in religious and cultural practices.

Simultaneously, the Camino de Santiago emerged as a vital axis for cultural, artistic, and spiritual exchange. Pilgrims traveling through León brought with them new ideas, artistic styles, and liturgical practices, strengthening the kingdom’s ties with the rest of Europe.

Religious and military orders also played a crucial role, combining defensive, administrative, and religious functions. Orders such as Santiago, Alcántara, and the Knights Templar managed strategic fortresses like the castles of Ponferrada and Cornatel, ensuring territorial control and the protection of the Camino de Santiago. They also promoted the construction of hospitals, churches, and hostels, facilitating the organization of reconquered territories and integrating cultural and economic networks within the kingdom.

The Kingdom of León’s cultural richness was further enhanced by its interactions with other territories. Exchanges with al-Andalus, as well as the migration of Mozarabic communities, introduced artistic techniques and scientific knowledge. Additionally, relations with other Christian kingdoms fostered the consolidation of a shared identity rooted in Christianity.

<text>Jughead is a search engine system for the Gopher protocol. It is distinct from Veronica in that it searches a single server at a time.

Jughead was developed by Rhett Jones in 1993 at the University of Utah.

The name &quot;Jughead&quot; was originally chosen to match the Archie search engine, as Jughead Jones is Archie Andrews&#x27; best friend in Archie Comics. Later a backronym was developed: &quot;Jonzy&#x27;s Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation And Display&quot;.

It was released by the original author under the GNU General Public License in 2006, and its source code has been modernized to better run on current POSIX systems.

Due to trademark issues, the modified version was called Jugtail, and has been made available for download on GNU Savannah.

<text>Eleanor Lambert (August 10, 1903 – October 7, 2003) was an American fashion publicist. She was instrumental in increasing the international prominence of the American fashion industry and in the emergence of New York City as a major fashion capital. Lambert was the founder of New York Fashion Week, the Council of Fashion Designers of America, the Met Gala, and the International Best Dressed List.

==Personal life==
Lambert was born to a Presbyterian family in Crawfordsville, Indiana. She attended the John Herron School of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago to study fashion. Lambert wanted to be a sculptor, but instead went into advertising. She started at an advertising agency in Manhattan, dealing mostly with artists and art galleries.

She was married twice, firstly to Wills Conner, in the 1920s, which ended in divorce in 1935, and secondly to Seymour Berkson in 1936, which ended with his death in 1959. Lambert and Berkson had one son together, the renowned poet Bill Berkson. She died in Manhattan in New York City.

==Career==
Lambert moved to New York in 1925 and briefly worked for a Manhattan advertising agency. In the mid 1930s, Lambert was the first press director of the Whitney Museum of American Art and helped with the founding of the Museum of Modern Art and the Art Dealers Association of America. Jackson Pollock, Jacob Epstein, and Isamu Noguchi were a few of the many artists she represented.

In the 1940s, Lambert founded the International Best Dressed List, the Coty Fashion Critics&#x27; Award (which later became the C.F.D.A. Awards), and New York Fashion Week. In 1959 and 1967, she was asked by the US Department of State to present American fashion for the first time in Russia, Germany, Italy, Australia, Japan, Britain, and Switzerland.

In 1962, she organized the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and stayed an honorary member until her death in 2003. In 1965, she was appointed by President Lyndon Johnson to the National Council on the Arts of the National Endowment for the Arts.
In 2001, the CFDA created &quot;The Eleanor Lambert Award&quot;, that is presented for a &quot;unique contribution to the world of fashion and/or deserves the industry&#x27;s special recognition.&quot; Months before she died, she had left her International Best Dressed List to four of &quot;Vanity Fair&#x27;s&quot; editors. Shortly after her last public appearance at New York Fashion Week in September, Lambert died in 2003 at the age of 100. Shortly after her death her grandson, Moses Berkson, completed a documentary film about her life.

Fashion historian John A. Tiffany was mentored by Lambert.

One source described Lambert as &quot;a factor in the gross domestic product of the U.S., and even of the world&quot; for her influence in the fashion industry. Lambert&#x27;s influence is described as exogenous event risk in mathematical modeling.

== In popular culture ==
In the 2021 Netflix miniseries &quot;Halston&quot;, Lambert was portrayed by Kelly Bishop.

<text>A blood test is a laboratory analysis performed on a blood sample that is usually extracted from a vein in the arm using a hypodermic needle, or via fingerprick. Multiple tests for specific blood components, such as a glucose test or a cholesterol test, are often grouped together into one test panel called a blood panel or blood work. Blood tests are often used in health care to determine physiological and biochemical states, such as disease, mineral content, pharmaceutical drug effectiveness, and organ function. Typical clinical blood panels include a basic metabolic panel or a complete blood count. Blood tests are also used in drug tests to detect drug abuse.

==Extraction==

A venipuncture is useful as it is a minimally invasive way to obtain cells and extracellular fluid (plasma) from the body for analysis. Blood flows throughout the body, acting as a medium that provides oxygen and nutrients to tissues and carries waste products back to the excretory systems for disposal. Consequently, the state of the bloodstream affects or is affected by, many medical conditions. For these reasons, blood tests are the most commonly performed medical tests.

If only a few drops of blood are needed, a fingerstick is performed instead of a venipuncture.

Indwelling arterial, central venous and peripheral venous lines can also be used to draw blood.

Phlebotomists, laboratory practitioners and nurses are those in charge of extracting blood from a patient. However, in special circumstances, and/or emergency situations, paramedics and physicians extract the blood. Also, respiratory therapists are trained to extract arterial blood to examine arterial blood gases.

==Types of tests==
===Biochemical analysis===
A basic metabolic panel measures sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), magnesium, creatinine, glucose, and sometimes calcium. Tests that focus on cholesterol levels can determine LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, as well as triglyceride levels.

Some tests, such as those that measure glucose or a lipid profile, require fasting (or no food consumption) eight to twelve hours prior to the drawing of the blood sample.

For the majority of tests, blood is usually obtained from the patient&#x27;s vein. Other specialized tests, such as the arterial blood gas test, require blood extracted from an artery. Blood gas analysis of arterial blood is primarily used to monitor carbon dioxide and oxygen levels related to pulmonary function, but is also used to measure blood pH and bicarbonate levels for certain metabolic conditions.

While the regular glucose test is taken at a certain point in time, the glucose tolerance test involves repeated testing to determine the rate at which glucose is processed by the body.

Blood tests are also used to identify autoimmune diseases and Immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergies (see also Radioallergosorbent test).

====Normal ranges====

Blood tests results should always be interpreted using the ranges provided by the laboratory that performed the test. Example ranges are shown below.
====Common abbreviations====
Upon completion of a blood test analysis, patients may receive a report with blood test abbreviations. Examples of common blood test abbreviations are shown below.
===Molecular profiles===
* Protein electrophoresis (general technique—not a specific test)
* Western blot (general technique—not a specific test)
* Liver function tests
* Polymerase chain reaction (DNA). DNA profiling is today possible with even very small quantities of blood: this is commonly used in forensic science, but is now also part of the diagnostic process of many disorders.
* Northern blot (RNA)
* Sexually transmitted diseases

===Cellular evaluation===
* Full blood count (or &quot;Complete Blood Count&quot;)
* Hematocrit
* MCV (&quot;Mean Corpuscular Volume&quot;)
* Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)
* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
* Cross-matching. Determination of blood type for blood transfusion or transplants
* Blood cultures are commonly taken if infection is suspected. Positive cultures and resulting sensitivity results are often useful in guiding medical treatment.

==Future alternatives==
===Saliva tests===
In 2008, scientists announced that the more cost effective saliva testing could eventually replace some blood tests, as saliva contains 20% of the proteins found in blood. Saliva testing may not be appropriate or available for all markers. For example, lipid levels cannot be measured with saliva testing.

===Microemulsion===
In February 2011, Canadian researchers at the University of Calgary&#x27;s Schulich School of Engineering announced a microchip for blood tests. Dubbed a microemulsion, a droplet of blood captured inside a layer of another substance. It can control the exact size and spacing of the droplets. The new test could improve the efficiency, accuracy, and speed of laboratory tests while also doing it cheaply.

===SIMBAS===
In March 2011, a team of researchers from UC Berkeley, DCU and University of Valparaíso have developed lab-on-a-chip that can diagnose diseases within 10 minutes without the use of external tubing and extra components. It is called Self-powered Integrated Microfluidic Blood Analysis System (SIMBAS). It uses tiny trenches to separate blood cells from plasma (99 percent of blood cells were captured during experiments). Researchers used plastic components, to reduce manufacturing costs.

<text>Reseda is a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California. It was founded in 1912, and its central business district started developing in 1915. The neighborhood was devoted to agriculture for many years. Earthquakes struck the area in 1971 and 1994.

The neighborhood has 15 public and five private schools. The community includes public parks, a senior center and a regional branch library.

==History==
===Founding and growth===
The area now known as Reseda was inhabited by Native Americans of the Tongva tribe who lived close to the Los Angeles River.

In 1909 the Suburban Homes Company, a syndicate led by H. J. Whitley, general manager of the Board of Control, Harry Chandler, H.G. Otis, M.H. Sherman and O.F. Brandt purchased 48,000 acres of the Farming and Milling Company for $2,500,000. Henry E. Huntington extended his Pacific Electric Railway (Red Cars) through the Valley to Owensmouth (now Canoga Park). The Suburban Home Company laid out plans for roads and the towns of Van Nuys, Reseda (Marian) and Canoga Park (Owensmouth). Los Angeles annexed the rural areas in 1915.

On land that was originally part of the San Fernando Mission, Reseda originated in 1912 as the town of Marian. It was named after Marian Otis Chandler, the daughter of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; publisher Harrison Gray Otis and wife of Harry Chandler. The name Reseda refers to the fragrant plant &quot;Reseda odorata&quot; (mignonette) which was commonly found in gardens of the time and is native to many areas with a Mediterranean climate.

The geographic name &quot;Reseda&quot; was first used for a siding on a branch of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which ran between the cities of Burbank and Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley. In the 1920s, the name was transferred from the Southern Pacific Railroad to the Western Division of the Pacific Electric Railway &quot;Red Cars Line&quot;, which had expedited development after the building of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. Later, it was used as the name of a stop on the Pacific Electric interurban railway along Sherman Way.

Throughout this time, the town&#x27;s name of Marian remained; then in 1921, when a Fourth Class Post Office was found to be necessary, the town&#x27;s name had to be changed. As the &quot;Zelzah Tribune&quot; reported:

The Marian territory has made application for a post office to serve that district. To avoid confusion in mail distribution it is necessary that the name of the town be changed and the people of that community have decided upon the name Reseda, and if the application is granted it will be the only post office in the United States by that name. Mrs. Turner, we are told, who has taken an active interest in the canvass and to create a sentiment for post office advantages, will possibly be the postmistress.
Ninety-two residents convened and agreed to rename the town Reseda. The new post office bearing the name was established on May 9, 1922, although local records show that the post office was dedicated on May 26. The post office officially opened on July 1, with receipts of $1.59.

The central business district began in 1915, at what is now the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and Sherman Way, with the construction of a hardware store. Soon a blacksmith shop and an auto repair garage were built nearby, followed by a grocery store and a drugstore. There were no sidewalks or pavement yet; most were added between 1918 and the early 1920s. On the southwest corner of Sherman Way a wooden building housed the volunteer fire department until 1922, when the present brick building was erected, as was the Reseda Bank. The wooden building housing the fire department was then moved to the southeast side of Sherman Way, where it remained until 1933. In May 1929, the city&#x27;s namesake roadway, Reseda Avenue, was renamed Reseda Boulevard by a Los Angeles City ordinance. Parts of the original 1920s and 1930s residential neighborhood remain southwest of Sherman Way and Reseda Boulevard as well as in Reseda Ranch near Grover Cleveland High School.

Reseda grew slowly, with the stock market crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression further slowing expansion.

During the late 1920s and 1930s, the area&#x27;s reputation developed for its production of lettuce, lima beans, sugar beets, and walnuts, becoming known as one of the nation&#x27;s largest producers of lettuce by the late 1930s. The Southern Pacific Railroad trains came up the middle of Sherman Way to pick up freight cars of lettuce daily during the lettuce harvest season. Around that time, manufacturing roof tile, canning poultry products, and processing walnuts began to emerge as viable businesses as well.

=== Postwar suburb ===
Reseda remained primarily an agricultural community, with a population of 1,805 in 1930. By 1940 the population had increased to 4,147. The mid- to late 1940s saw a large increase in the numbers of single-family dwellings and the loss of numerous acres of agriculture, and the addition of First Class Postal Service. Reseda was one of the early suburbs in the San Fernando Valley. The large ranches were subdivided, and the area was developed by realtors just as World War II veterans were returning home. The familiar orange groves were successively plowed under in favor of housing. At the time, most jobs were in the Los Angeles Basin and to the south, over the Santa Monica mountains.

By 1950, Reseda had over 16,000 residents, and in the early 1950s a population explosion took place, making Reseda one of the most popular and populated Valley communities. Because of this, Reseda&#x27;s merchants provided bus service to transport shoppers throughout the busy downtown Reseda areas.

In the early 1950s, the Valley&#x27;s population reached 400,000. The average new Valley home, in 1949, cost $9,000. By 1955, that same house could go for nearly $15,000. Even at that price, though, a household income was about $6,000 per year, making Valley incomes higher than the national average. By 1960, the average market value of a Valley home reached $18,850.

During the 1970s, the above-average residential real estate values and income patterns began to decline. Land and housing costs shot upward, while most incomes only crept. By the beginning of the 1980s, the average price of a home in the Valley reached $110,000. According to a 2004 study by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, it has tripled that of the early 1980s.

===Northridge earthquake===
The 1994 Northridge earthquake struck at 4:31 a.m. on January 17 and measured 6.7 on the moment magnitude scale. It remains the only large earthquake to originate directly under a major U.S. city in modern times as well as the most damaging earthquake to strike the U.S. since the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906. Its epicenter was between Arminta Street and Ingomar Street, just west of Reseda Boulevard.

This was the second time in 23 years the area had been affected by a strong earthquake. On February 9, 1971, the San Fernando earthquake (also known as the Sylmar earthquake) struck the area with a magnitude of 6.6.

==Geography==

Reseda is flanked on the north by Northridge, on the east by Lake Balboa, on the south by Tarzana and Encino, on the southwest by Woodland Hills, and on the west by Winnetka. Its street boundaries are Roscoe Boulevard on the north, White Oak Avenue on the east, Victory Boulevard on the south and Corbin Avenue on the west.
== Demographics ==
The 2010 U.S. census counted 74,363 residents in Reseda&#x27;s 91335 ZIP code. The median age was 35.5, and the median yearly household income was $53,842.

In 2008, the &quot;Los Angeles Times, Mapping L.A.&quot; project described Reseda as &quot;highly diverse&quot; ethnically within Los Angeles. The breakdown of the population using the 2000 census was 43.5% Latino; 37.2% Non-Hispanic white; 11.2% Asian; 4.2% black; and 3.9% other. Mexico (33.7%) and El Salvador (12.4%) were the most common birthplaces of the 43.1% of the residents who were born abroad.

In 2010, renters occupied 48.5% of the housing stock, and house or apartment-owners held 51.5%.

==Government and infrastructure==

===Local government===
Los Angeles Fire Department Station 73 (Reseda) and Station 100 (West Van Nuys/Lake Balboa) serve the community.

The Los Angeles Police Department operates the nearby West Valley Community Police Station.

===County, state, and federal===
Mail services are provided by the United States Postal Service&#x27;s branch post office at 7320 Reseda Boulevard. On October 14, 2006, the branch office was renamed the Coach John Wooden Post Office on Wooden&#x27;s 96th birthday. Wooden lived in nearby Encino and his daughter lived in Reseda.

==Education==

Nineteen percent of Reseda residents 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an average figure for both the city and the county. The proportion of residents with a high school diploma was high for the county.

===School closings===
In 1982, the board considered closing Garden Grove Elementary School. In April 1983, an advisory committee of the Los Angeles Unified School District recommended closing eight schools, including Garden Grove School and Newcastle Avenue School. In August 1983, the board publicly considered closing Garden Grove, which had 176 students at the time, and Newcastle Avenue, which had 314 students. In 1984, the board voted to close the Garden Grove and Newcastle Avenue schools.

A decade after the schools closed, which occurred due to thousands of parents withdrawing their children from the Los Angeles Unified School District in the wake of mandatory busing, they were reopened. With the advent of class-size reduction becoming the priority, many parents began returning their children to the city&#x27;s schools, and the number of newly arrived immigrants was boosting enrollments, officials said.

==Featured sites==

The site began in the 1950s as one of the first Sav-On Drug stores in the San Fernando Valley, then became a nightclub, and remained a dancehall and music venue during the 1990s; it was also used as a boxing venue. It later became and remains a Spanish-language Christian church.

<text>Marie-Paul Achille Auguste Le Flem (18 March 1881 – 31 July 1984) was a French composer and music critic.

==Biography ==
Born in Radon, Orne, of Breton parentage, and living most of his life in Lézardrieux, Le Flem studied at the Schola Cantorum under Vincent d&#x27;Indy and Albert Roussel, later teaching at the same establishment, where his pupils included Erik Satie (as a mature student) and André Jolivet. His music is strongly influenced by his native Brittany, the landscape of which is reflected in most of his work. He spoke Breton and remained strongly attached to Breton culture throughout his life.

In September 1902, he departed for Russia to take up a teaching position, during which he learned Russian. Nevertheless, he soon grew homesick and returned to Brittany after turning down another job opportunity in the Crimea.

Before World War I, Le Flem produced several major works, including his First Symphony, a Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra, and an opera. The war temporarily put an end to his compositional activities. Le Flem was mobilised as a stretcher-bearer during the war, and his knowledge of Russian enabled him to be assigned to the Russian Expeditionary Force in France, where he was invited to lead their military band. After the war he devoted himself to music criticism and choral conducting. He wrote numerous articles for the periodical &quot;Comoedia&quot;.

In 1937, he began composing once again. Three additional symphonies and a second opera followed before he was finally forced to give up composition in 1976, at the age of 95, due to blindness. He died on 31 July 1984 at the age of 103.

Some of his dramatic works include the operas &quot;Le Rossignol de St-Malo&quot; (The Nightingale of St Malo) and &quot;La Magicienne de la mer&quot; (The Magician of the Sea), as well as a version of the chante-fable &quot;Aucassin et Nicolette&quot;. &quot;For the Dead&quot; and the seven &quot;Pièces enfantines&quot;, both originally written in 1911, were orchestrated some years later. Two of the composer&#x27;s children died young, and &quot;For the Dead&quot; is dedicated to their memory. In addition to his symphonies, Le Flem wrote evocative orchestral music such as &quot;En mer&quot; (At Sea) and &quot;La Voix du large&quot; (The Voice of the Open Sea). Le Flem also composed the music for Jean Tedesco&#x27;s short film &quot;The Great Gardener of France&quot; in 1942.

Le Flem was a member of the Association des Compositeurs Breton; another member, the Irish-American Swan Hennessy (1866–1929) dedicated his &quot;Petit trio celtique&quot;, Op. 52 (1921) to Le Flem.

==Personal life ==
He died in Tréguier in 1984, having reached the age of 103.

He was the grandfather of Swedish-French actress Marika Green and the great-grandfather of French actress Eva Green.

<text>Anthrocon (abbreviated AC) is an annual furry convention that takes place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, each June or July. It caters to furries, which are fans of fictional anthropomorphic animal characters in art and literature. The convention was first held in 1997 in Albany, New York, and moved multiple times before settling at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. Since moving to Pittsburgh in 2006, the convention has drawn millions in financing to the local economy.

Anthrocon is among the most attended furry conventions in history, peaking at 17,639 in 2024.

==Background and history==
Anthrocon was founded in 1997 as Albany Anthrocon (AAC) in New York state, with a membership of about 500. The convention was renamed to &#x27;Anthrocon&#x27; and moved to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1999 and 2000; then to a larger hotel, the Adam&#x27;s Mark, on the outskirts of Philadelphia in 2001. Attendance grew each year, Anthrocon becoming the largest furry convention in 2001 with an attendance of 1,457. In 2004 it had climbed to 2,404 attendees in its final year at the Adam&#x27;s Mark.

Due to the unforeseen sale of the Adam&#x27;s Mark Hotel in November 2004, Anthrocon chose the Wyndham Franklin Plaza in Philadelphia as the site for its 2005 convention. Attendance that year dropped to 2,373. In June 2005, a contract with the Westin Convention Center Hotel in Pittsburgh was signed, and Anthrocon was scheduled to be held at the adjoining David L. Lawrence Convention Center between June 15 and 18, 2006. Despite concerns that the move to Pittsburgh would decrease attendance, it rose to 2,489, enough to ensure the future of the convention in Pittsburgh.

In 2007 Anthrocon was featured in the Guinness World Records (2008 Edition) as the &quot;largest furry fan club&quot; in the world. In 2008, Anthrocon became the first furry convention to have an attendance exceeding 3,000 members, the official count reaching 3,390. In 2009, attendance rose 11% to 3,776, and the Fursuit Parade count jumped to 640—a 41% increase. Anthrocon 2009 brought approximately $3 million to the Pittsburgh economy.

Anthrocon 2010 had an attendance of 4,238, the first furry convention to exceed 4,000 members; and by 2012 saw 5,179 attendees, with a Fursuit Parade exceeding 1,000. The admission price was also set overall at $60 for a four-day pass, though pre-registered attendees paid $50.

In 2017, Anthrocon lost the title of &quot;World&#x27;s most attended furry convention&quot;, as Midwest FurFest in Rosemont, Illinois, claimed the title with an attendance of over 8,700.

The chairman of the convention since 1999, Samuel Conway, oversees the operations of Anthrocon with the assistance of convention staff and volunteers who donate their time and energy throughout the weekend to assist the multitude of small tasks which arise. Since 1997, Anthrocon has raised more than $200,000 for animal-related charities.

=== Fernando&#x27;s Café ===
Since the convention&#x27;s presence in Pittsburgh, Fernando&#x27;s Café, a fast food restaurant located near Westin Convention Center Pittsburgh, is one of several restaurants that cater to furries during Anthrocon weekend. However, in 2012, Fernando DeCarvalho, the owner of the restaurant, called Conway informing him that he had gone into debt as a result of the Great Recession. In response, Conway initiated a fundraising campaign which resulted in the restaurant receiving $20,000, a move HuffPost reports would &quot;alleviate some of [DeCarvalho&#x27;s] debt and allow him to keep his doors open long enough for one last Anthrocon.&quot;

==Typical programming and events==
There are areas open most of the day to accommodate sales by Dealers and Artists as well as an area to congregate and socialize.

Anthrocon provides a number of specialized &#x27;tracks&#x27; of programming with similar furry based themes and scheduled &#x27;events&#x27;.

The programming tracks involve discussions and work groups focused on the application of furry in Art, Comedy and Improv, Computer Gaming, Costuming (Fursuits), Music, Puppetry, Role-Playing (both gaming and real-life), and Writing.

Scheduled events that take place have included a Charity Auction, Masquerade, Fursuit Parade, nightly dances, Art Show Auctions, and special presentations by Uncle Kage and &quot;2 the Ranting Gryphon&quot;.

Every year the convention has several Guests of Honor, who are prominent individuals who are compensated for their attendance and travel expenses. Past Guests of Honor at Anthrocon have included Rob Paulsen and Mark Evanier.

<doc id="336568" wikidata="Q17006917" url="?curid=336568" title="Classical orthogonal polynomials">
<text>In mathematics, the classical orthogonal polynomials are the most widely used orthogonal polynomials: the Hermite polynomials, Laguerre polynomials, Jacobi polynomials (including as a special case the Gegenbauer polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials, and Legendre polynomials).

They have many important applications in such areas as mathematical physics (in particular, the theory of random matrices), approximation theory, numerical analysis, and many others.

Classical orthogonal polynomials appeared in the early 19th century in the works of Adrien-Marie Legendre, who introduced the Legendre polynomials. In the late 19th century, the study of continued fractions to solve the moment problem by P. L. Chebyshev and then A.A. Markov and T.J. Stieltjes led to the general notion of orthogonal polynomials.

For given polynomials formula_1 and formula_2 the classical orthogonal polynomials formula_3 are characterized by being solutions of the differential equation 
:formula_4
with to be determined constants formula_5. The Wikipedia article Rodrigues&#x27; formula has a proof that the polynomials obtained from the Rodrigues&#x27; formula obey a differential equation of this form and also derives formula_6.

There are several more general definitions of orthogonal classical polynomials; for example, use the term for all polynomials in the Askey scheme.

== Definition ==

In general, the orthogonal polynomials formula_7 with respect to a weight formula_8 satisfy

:formula_9

The relations above define formula_7 up to multiplication by a number. Various normalisations are used to fix the constant, e.g.

:formula_11

The classical orthogonal polynomials correspond to the following three families of weights:

:formula_12

The standard normalisation (also called &quot;standardization&quot;) is detailed below.

===Jacobi polynomials===
For formula_13 the Jacobi polynomials are given by the formula

:formula_14

They are normalised (standardized) by

:formula_15

and satisfy the orthogonality condition

:formula_16

The Jacobi polynomials are solutions to the differential equation

:formula_17

==== Important special cases ====

The Jacobi polynomials with formula_18 are called the Gegenbauer polynomials (with parameter formula_19)

For formula_20, these are called the Legendre polynomials (for which the interval of orthogonality is [−1, 1] and the weight function is simply 1):

:formula_21

For formula_22, one obtains the Chebyshev polynomials (of the second and first kind, respectively).

===Hermite polynomials===
The Hermite polynomials are defined by

:formula_23

They satisfy the orthogonality condition

:formula_24

and the differential equation

:formula_25

===Laguerre polynomials===
The generalised Laguerre polynomials are defined by

: formula_26

(the classical Laguerre polynomials correspond to formula_27.)

They satisfy the orthogonality relation

: formula_28

and the differential equation

:formula_29

== Differential equation ==

The classical orthogonal polynomials arise from a differential equation of the form

:formula_30

where &quot;Q&quot; is a given quadratic (at most) polynomial, and &quot;L&quot; is a given linear polynomial. The function &quot;f&quot;, and the constant &quot;λ&quot;, are to be found.

:(Note that it makes sense for such an equation to have a polynomial solution.
:Each term in the equation is a polynomial, and the degrees are consistent.)

This is a Sturm–Liouville type of equation. Such equations generally have singularities in their solution functions f except for particular values of &quot;λ&quot;. They can be thought of as eigenvector/eigenvalue problems: Letting &quot;D&quot; be the differential operator, formula_31, and changing the sign of &quot;λ&quot;, the problem is to find the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) f, and the
corresponding eigenvalues &quot;λ&quot;, such that f does not have singularities and &quot;D&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) = &quot;λf&quot;.

The solutions of this differential equation have singularities unless &quot;λ&quot; takes on
specific values. There is a series of numbers &quot;λ&quot;0, &quot;λ&quot;1, &quot;λ&quot;2, ... that led to a series of polynomial solutions &quot;P&quot;0, &quot;P&quot;1, &quot;P&quot;2, ... if one of the following sets of conditions are met:

# &quot;Q&quot; is actually quadratic, &quot;L&quot; is linear, &quot;Q&quot; has two distinct real roots, the root of &quot;L&quot; lies strictly between the roots of &quot;Q&quot;, and the leading terms of &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;L&quot; have the same sign.
# &quot;Q&quot; is not actually quadratic, but is linear, &quot;L&quot; is linear, the roots of &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are different, and the leading terms of &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;L&quot; have the same sign if the root of &quot;L&quot; is less than the root of &quot;Q&quot;, or vice versa.
# &quot;Q&quot; is just a nonzero constant, &quot;L&quot; is linear, and the leading term of &quot;L&quot; has the opposite sign of &quot;Q&quot;.

These three cases lead to the Jacobi-like, Laguerre-like, and Hermite-like polynomials, respectively.

In each of these three cases, we have the following:

* The solutions are a series of polynomials &quot;P&quot;0, &quot;P&quot;1, &quot;P&quot;2, ..., each &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; having degree &quot;n&quot;, and corresponding to a number λ&quot;n&quot;.
* The interval of orthogonality is bounded by whatever roots &quot;Q&quot; has.
* The root of &quot;L&quot; is inside the interval of orthogonality.
* Letting formula_32, the polynomials are orthogonal under the weight function formula_33
* &quot;W&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) has no zeros or infinities inside the interval, though it may have zeros or infinities at the end points.
* &quot;W&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) gives a finite inner product to any polynomials.
* &quot;W&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) can be made to be greater than 0 in the interval. (Negate the entire differential equation if necessary so that &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) &gt; 0 inside the interval.)

Because of the constant of integration, the quantity &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is determined only up to an arbitrary positive multiplicative constant. It will be used only in homogeneous differential equations
(where this doesn&#x27;t matter) and in the definition of the weight function (which can also be
indeterminate.) The tables below will give the &quot;official&quot; values of &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;W&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

=== Rodrigues&#x27; formula ===
Under the assumptions of the preceding section,
&quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is proportional to formula_34

This is known as Rodrigues&#x27; formula, after Olinde Rodrigues. It is often written

:formula_35
* (differential equation) &quot;P&quot; is a solution of formula_36, where λ&quot;r&quot; is the same function as λ&quot;n&quot;, that is, formula_37
* (differential equation, second form) &quot;P&quot; is a solution of formula_38

There are also some mixed recurrences. In each of these, the numbers &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; depend on &quot;n&quot;
and &quot;r&quot;, and are unrelated in the various formulas.

* formula_39
* formula_40
* formula_41

There are an enormous number of other formulas involving orthogonal polynomials
in various ways. Here is a tiny sample of them, relating to the Chebyshev,
associated Laguerre, and Hermite polynomials:

* formula_42
* formula_43
* formula_44

=== Orthogonality ===

The differential equation for a particular &quot;λ&quot; may be written (omitting explicit dependence on x)

:formula_45

multiplying by formula_46 yields

:formula_47

and reversing the subscripts yields

:formula_48

subtracting and integrating:

:formula_49

but it can be seen that

:formula_50

so that:

:formula_51

If the polynomials &quot;f&quot; are such that the term on the left is zero, and formula_52 for formula_53, then the orthogonality relationship will hold:

:formula_54

for formula_53.

== Derivation from differential equation ==

All of the polynomial sequences arising from the differential equation above are equivalent, under scaling and/or shifting of the domain, and standardizing of the polynomials, to more restricted classes. Those restricted classes are exactly &quot;classical orthogonal polynomials&quot;.

* Every Jacobi-like polynomial sequence can have its domain shifted and/or scaled so that its interval of orthogonality is [−1, 1], and has &quot;Q&quot; = 1 − &quot;x&quot;2. They can then be standardized into the Jacobi polynomials formula_56. There are several important subclasses of these: Gegenbauer, Legendre, and two types of Chebyshev.
* Every Laguerre-like polynomial sequence can have its domain shifted, scaled, and/or reflected so that its interval of orthogonality is formula_57, and has &quot;Q&quot; = &quot;x&quot;. They can then be standardized into the Associated Laguerre polynomials formula_58. The plain Laguerre polynomials formula_59 are a subclass of these.
* Every Hermite-like polynomial sequence can have its domain shifted and/or scaled so that its interval of orthogonality is formula_60, and has Q = 1 and L(0) = 0. They can then be standardized into the Hermite polynomials formula_61.

Because all polynomial sequences arising from a differential equation in the manner
described above are trivially equivalent to the classical polynomials, the actual classical
polynomials are always used.

=== Jacobi polynomial ===
The Jacobi-like polynomials, once they have had their domain shifted and scaled so that
the interval of orthogonality is [−1, 1], still have two parameters to be determined.
They are formula_62 and formula_63 in the Jacobi polynomials,
written formula_56. We have formula_65 and
formula_66.
Both formula_62 and formula_63 are required to be greater than −1.
(This puts the root of L inside the interval of orthogonality.)

When formula_62 and formula_63 are not equal, these polynomials
are not symmetrical about &quot;x&quot; = 0.

The differential equation

:formula_71

is Jacobi&#x27;s equation.

For further details, see Jacobi polynomials.

=== Gegenbauer polynomials ===
When one sets the parameters formula_62 and formula_63 in the Jacobi polynomials equal to each other, one obtains the Gegenbauer or ultraspherical polynomials. They are written formula_74, and defined as

:formula_75

We have formula_65 and
formula_77.
The parameter formula_62 is required to be greater than −1/2.

(Incidentally, the standardization given in the table below would make no sense for &quot;α&quot; = 0 and &quot;n&quot; ≠ 0, because it would set the polynomials to zero. In that case, the accepted standardization sets formula_79 instead of the value given in the table.)

Ignoring the above considerations, the parameter formula_62 is closely related to the derivatives of formula_74:

:formula_82

or, more generally:

:formula_83

All the other classical Jacobi-like polynomials (Legendre, etc.) are special cases of the Gegenbauer polynomials, obtained by choosing a value of formula_62 and choosing a standardization.

For further details, see Gegenbauer polynomials.

=== Legendre polynomials ===
The differential equation is

:formula_85

This is Legendre&#x27;s equation.

The second form of the differential equation is:

:formula_86

The recurrence relation is

:formula_87

A mixed recurrence is

:formula_88

Rodrigues&#x27; formula is

:formula_89

For further details, see Legendre polynomials.

==== Associated Legendre polynomials ====
The Associated Legendre polynomials, denoted
formula_90 where formula_91 and formula_92 are integers with formula_93, are defined as

:formula_94

The &quot;m&quot; in parentheses (to avoid confusion with an exponent) is a parameter. The &quot;m&quot; in brackets denotes the &quot;m&quot;-th derivative of the Legendre polynomial.

These &quot;polynomials&quot; are misnamed—they are not polynomials when &quot;m&quot; is odd.

They have a recurrence relation:

:formula_95

For fixed &quot;m&quot;, the sequence formula_96 are orthogonal over [−1, 1], with weight 1.

For given &quot;m&quot;, formula_90 are the solutions of

:formula_98

=== Chebyshev polynomials ===
The differential equation is

:formula_99

This is Chebyshev&#x27;s equation.

The recurrence relation is

:formula_100

Rodrigues&#x27; formula is

:formula_101

These polynomials have the property that, in the interval of orthogonality,

:formula_102

(To prove it, use the recurrence formula.)

This means that all their local minima and maxima have values of −1 and +1, that is, the polynomials are &quot;level&quot;. Because of this, expansion of functions in terms of Chebyshev polynomials is sometimes used for polynomial approximations in computer math libraries.

Some authors use versions of these polynomials that have been shifted so that the interval of orthogonality is [0, 1] or [−2, 2].

There are also Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, denoted formula_103

We have:

:formula_104

For further details, including the expressions for the first few
polynomials, see Chebyshev polynomials.

=== Laguerre polynomials ===
The most general Laguerre-like polynomials, after the domain has been shifted and scaled, are the Associated Laguerre polynomials (also called generalized Laguerre polynomials), denoted formula_58. There is a parameter formula_62, which can be any real number strictly greater than −1. The parameter is put in parentheses to avoid confusion with an exponent. The plain Laguerre polynomials are simply the formula_107 version of these:

:formula_108

The differential equation is

:formula_109

This is Laguerre&#x27;s equation.

The second form of the differential equation is

:formula_110

The recurrence relation is

:formula_111

Rodrigues&#x27; formula is

:formula_112

The parameter formula_62 is closely related to the derivatives of formula_58:

:formula_115

or, more generally:

:formula_116

Laguerre&#x27;s equation can be manipulated into a form that is more useful in applications:

:formula_117

is a solution of

:formula_118

This can be further manipulated. When formula_119 is an integer, and formula_120:

:formula_121

is a solution of

:formula_122

The solution is often expressed in terms of derivatives instead of associated Laguerre polynomials:

:formula_123

This equation arises in quantum mechanics, in the radial part of the solution of the Schrödinger equation for a one-electron atom.

Physicists often use a definition for the Laguerre polynomials that is larger, by a factor of formula_124, than the definition used here.

For further details, including the expressions for the first few polynomials, see Laguerre polynomials.

=== Hermite polynomials ===

The differential equation is

:formula_125

This is Hermite&#x27;s equation.

The second form of the differential equation is

:formula_126

The third form is

:formula_127

The recurrence relation is

:formula_128

Rodrigues&#x27; formula is

:formula_129

The first few Hermite polynomials are

:formula_130

:formula_131

:formula_132

:formula_133

:formula_134

One can define the associated Hermite functions

: formula_135

Because the multiplier is proportional to the square root of the weight function, these functions
are orthogonal over formula_60 with no weight function.

The third form of the differential equation above, for the associated Hermite functions, is

:formula_137

The associated Hermite functions arise in many areas of mathematics and physics.
In quantum mechanics, they are the solutions of Schrödinger&#x27;s equation for the harmonic oscillator.
They are also eigenfunctions (with eigenvalue (−&quot;i&quot; &quot;n&quot;) of the continuous Fourier transform.

Many authors, particularly probabilists, use an alternate definition of the Hermite polynomials, with a weight function of formula_138 instead of formula_139. If the notation &quot;He&quot; is used for these Hermite polynomials, and &quot;H&quot; for those above, then these may be characterized by

:formula_140

For further details, see Hermite polynomials.

==Characterizations of classical orthogonal polynomials==

There are several conditions that single out the classical orthogonal polynomials from the others.

The first condition was found by Sonine (and later by Hahn), who showed that (up to linear changes of variable) the classical orthogonal polynomials are the only ones such that their derivatives are also orthogonal polynomials.

Bochner characterized classical orthogonal polynomials in terms of their recurrence relations.

Tricomi characterized classical orthogonal polynomials as those that have a certain analogue of the Rodrigues formula.

<text>Obsidian is a naturally formed volcanic glass that was an important part of the material culture of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Obsidian was a highly integrated part of daily and ritual life, and its widespread and varied use may be a significant contributor to Mesoamerica&#x27;s lack of metallurgy. Lithic and contextual analysis of obsidian, including source studies, are important components of archaeological studies of past Mesoamerican cultures and inform scholars on economy, technological organization, long-distance trade, ritual organization, and socio-cultural structure.

==Production techniques==
 Due to its glassy internal structure, obsidian is relatively easy to work, as it breaks in very predictable and controlled ways via conchoidal fracturing. This contributed to its prolific use throughout Mesoamerica. It is obtained by either quarrying source sites or in nodule form from riverbeds or fractured outcrops.

Following the removal of cortex (when applicable), bifacial, unifacial, and expedient flake stone tools could be produced through lithic reduction. The use of pecking, grinding, and carving techniques may also be employed to produce figurines, jewelry, eccentrics, or other types of objects. Prismatic blade production, a technique employing a pressure flaking-like technique that removed blades from a polyhedral core, was ubiquitous throughout Mesoamerica.

Modern attempts to redesign production techniques are heavily based on Spanish records and accounts of witnessed obsidian knapping. Motolinia, a 16th-century Spanish observer, left this account of prismatic blade production:

&quot;It is in this manner: First they get out a knife stone (obsidian core) which is black like jet and 20 cm or slightly less in length, and they make it cylindrical and as thick as the calf of the leg, and they place the stone between the feet, and with a stick apply force to the edges of the stone, and at every push they give a little knife springs off with its edges like those of a razor.&quot;&quot;

As the distribution of obsidian sources in Mesoamerica is generally limited, many areas and sites lacked a local obsidian source or direct access to one. As a result, tool curation through edge-rejuvenation and/or resharpening was commonly used on larger-mass tools, such as bifaces, to prolong the tool&#x27;s (and the raw material&#x27;s) utility. While prismatic blades were generally not curated (in the traditional sense) due to their small size, utility of the tools may have been maintained by changing their function. In other words, as the edge of a blade lost its sharpness after long-term use, the blade may have been used in scraping activities, which does not require a very sharp edge, than as a cutting implement. Other curation techniques of prismatic blades involve reshaping them into other tool types, such as projectile points and awls.

==Sources==

Obsidian sources in Mesoamerica are limited in number and distribution, and are restricted to the volcanic regions of the Sierra Madre Mountains as they run through Mexico and Guatemala. These resources, however, are still quite abundant in the archaeological record and their origins can be traced by their physical and geological properties. Before discussing these obsidian sources, a definition of what an obsidian source is must be established, as many of the terms used allow for different and competing interpretations.

Sidrys et al. (1976) stated that an obsidian source area includes several outcroppings of obsidian, limited in spatial extent, which may or may not have common chemical features and may or may not have been used by ancient humans. Michael D. Glascock, of the University of Missouri Research Reactor Center at the University of Missouri (which performs neutron activation analysis), has divided Mesoamerica into nine sub-regions with one or more obsidian sources in each. These subdivisions, while effective at systemizing the source characteristics and allowing for a more easily visualized distribution of sources, are still tentative. They are as follows:

*Zaragoza (includes the Zaragoza and Altotonga quarries), in the south-central Gulf lowlands of Mexico)
*Bazoli (includes the Cranzido and Partigo sources), in the central highlands of Mexico
*Orizaba (includes the Pico de Orizaba, Guadalupe Victoria, and Las Derrumbadas sources), in the south-central Gulf lowlands of Mexico
*Paredon (Paredon and Santa Elena sources), in the central highlands of Mexico
*Otumba (Otumba and Malpais), in the central highlands of Mexico
*Tulancingo (Tulancingo and Tepalcingo), in the central highlands of Mexico
*Pachuca (a number of different quarries), in the central highlands of Mexico
*Zacualtipan (Zacualtipan, one source only), in the central highlands of Mexico
*Ucareo (Ucareo and Zinapécuaro) – largest source in west Mexico (in Michoacán).
*The Guatemalan region – which incorporates all sources located in the Guatemalan highlands. Tajumulco, El Chayal, Ixtepeque, and San Martín Jilotepeque are the best known obsidian sources in Guatemala and were commonly exploited in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. In fact, almost all Obsidian found in Olmec and Maya sites originates from these sources.

Sources in the Valley of Mexico, which fell under Teotihuacan control during the Early Classic, were Pachuca, Otumba, and Chicoloapan. Obsidian from Pachuca is notable because of its unique green-gold color and its internal purity which makes it one of the highest quality obsidian sources in Mesoamerica. It was much sought after and widely traded. Green obsidian is also found in the area of Tulancingo, but is distinct from Pachuca obsidian because of its internal opacity (e.g., it is a more milky or clouded green).

Substantial research has been carried out to decipher the Guatemala region sources. As mentioned earlier, the Guatemalan region includes the El Chayal, Ixtepeque, and San Martin Jilotepeque sources, located in southern/southeastern Guatemala. Obsidian originating from Guatemala was widely used in Mesoamerica and is found as far north as the Yucatán Peninsula, moving via a well-developed long-distance trade network that inter-connected much of the Maya area. Newer and tentative additions to the Guatemalan source area are Jalapa and Sansare. However, the El Chayal area is often seen as subsuming these two into one large source area. The Pre Classic Monte Alto culture and the Olmecs also used the Tajumulco Volcano source, in the southwest of Guatemala, a source that was almost forgotten during the Classic and Post Classic periods.

==Analytical methods==

===Trace element analysis===
Obsidian, a volcanic glass, comes from several geological sources in Mesoamerica, as listed above. Each of these sources has a distinctive “fingerprint” of trace elements that proportionally vary due to the individual circumstances of each source&#x27;s formation. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) are two analytical methods used to identify the types and amounts of trace elements. These data are then statistically compared to data already available for the known sources.

===Visual sourcing===
Visual sourcing is the process by which the source of obsidian artifacts are determined by the analysis of not only their visual appearance (e.g., color, inclusions, etc.) but also their physical attributes, such as surface texture, light reflection, internal opacity, and so on. While not as reliable as trace element analysis, and completely dependent on the experience of the researcher, visual sourcing has a number of advantages. Primarily, it is a cheap method that allows for the analysis of an entire obsidian assemblage. This is in comparison to trace element analysis which, due to high costs, allows for the analysis of only a small sample, preferably one that is statistically representative.

===Hydration dating===
Obsidian hydration dating is a method that allows for the absolute or relative dating of an obsidian sample. The degree of hydration (i.e., water absorbed into the material) observed indicates how long it has been since the obsidian surface was exposed (i.e., through flaking). Obsidian hydration dating is at times, however, unreliable. The rate of hydration can vary tremendously depending on annual rainfall and humidity levels, among other factors, and how these have varied since the piece was first produced (or how they vary if the piece moved from one ecological zone to another).

Due to the nature of the geological formation of obsidian, and the impact that each unique formation incidence has on the appearance and geochemical properties of each source, the material serves as an excellent medium by which long-distance trade can be studied. In performing trace-element or visual analyses, the origins of an artifact&#x27;s material can be determined.

It is clear that obsidian was a critical material in Precolumbian Mesoamerican economies; it is ubiquitous throughout the region, and found in the material record of all cultures and time periods. The low bulk of obsidian in transport, which therefore required less effort in trade, and the large quantity of useful items that could be produced from a small amount of material, greatly contributed to obsidian&#x27;s widespread use.

One example is the presence of Pachuca obsidian from central Mexico, where Mexico City is now, and ostensibly under the control of Teotihuacan, in the Maya area during the Early Classic. While the Maya had access to a number of local obsidian sources more readily available and (relatively) easily obtained, including El Chayal its main source, Pachuca obsidian remained an important trade good. The Olmec, from the Gulf coast likewise obtained its obsidian also from El Chayal in Guatemala (Andrews (1990: 13). It is unclear if trade for foreign obsidian contributed to the growth of Maya polities, or if it simply served as a mode for obtaining superior items or human labor. Generally, obsidian came into the Maya area via larger central places, such as Tikal, Uaxactun, and Palenque. Obsidian artifacts and tools were then redistributed to smaller and potentially dependent centers and communities. This is indicated by a lack of production debitage, including polyhedral cores, decortical flakes, and large percussion flakes, among rural occupations. 

Obsidian was generally transported, where applicable, along coastal trade routes. Of primary importance is the circum-peninsular trade route that linked the southeast Maya area to the Gulf coast of Mexico. Examples of evidence of this include the higher quantities of obsidian found among coastal sites, such as small island occupations off the coast of Belize, then at sites located in-land.

==Use==
===Utilitarian===
Obsidian, called &quot;itztli&quot; in the Nahuatl language, has been found at nearly every Mesoamerican archaeological site. Items made from this material had both utilitarian and ritual use. In many areas, it was available to all households regardless of socio-economic status, and was used in hunting, agriculture, food preparation, and for many other daily activities. Morphologically, obsidian was worked into a variety of tool forms, including knives, lance and projectile points, prismatic blades, general bifacial tools, and utilized flakes. Blades have been found &quot;in situ&quot; with rabbit, rodent, and mollusk remains, indicating their use in butchery. The practical use of obsidian is obvious considering that the material can be used to make some of the sharpest edges on earth.

===Ideological===
Obsidian was also used in a variety of non-utilitarian contexts. Objects made of obsidian were used as associated grave goods, employed in sacrifice (in whatever form), and in art. Some non-utilitarian forms include miniature human effigies, ear spools and labrets with gold and turquoise workings, carved animal figurines, beads, vases, and as pieces of masks.

Obsidian was frequently used in ritualized autosacrifice (blood-letting) activities, serving as a substitute for stingray spines. Its association with that act of bloodletting is important, as it is argued by some researchers that obsidian was seen as a type of blood originating from the earth – its use in autosacrifice is therefore especially symbolic. Objects made of obsidian were often buried in upper class tombs as special deposits or caches. Obsidian debitage is found in many of these tombs in addition to evidence of its use in temple dedications, potlaching, or offerings. For example, flakes have been found in association with stelae offerings and related to specific gods at the Maya site of Tikal. Its ritualized use is not, however, restricted to high-status political and religious contexts, and it was clearly used within mundane domestic and household rituals.

==Representation in art and writing==

Most of the evidence that supports the many theories about obsidian use in Mesoamerica comes from the artwork of the region. This artwork is seen in many forms including the aforementioned obsidian figurines, ear spools, beads, and vases. Stele and large carvings, sculpture, and murals on architecture also depict obsidian. Typically, the material&#x27;s visual depiction in artwork is generally associated with autosacrifice and other types of sacrifice, including images of prismatic blades with bloody hearts on the blade&#x27;s ends. Unfortunately, the majority of the material record is out of context yet the implications and interpretations that are drawn from artwork are substantial and reflect a corpus of beliefs and ideology involving obsidian.

Some of the more significant portrayals of obsidian use involve blood-letting and warfare. One example includes the macuahuitl, a broad–faced club studded along its edges by obsidian prismatic blades. These weapons are predominantly used in ritual warfare and generally date to the Postclassic period. Earlier depictions of obsidian is usually restricted to their appearance as razors or lancets, and it is commonly believed that the material was not associated with weapons such as clubs or spears until later phases in Mesoamerica.

In the Aztec writing system, a curved prismatic blade represents the phonetic value &quot;itz&quot; (Taube 1991) and results in the term &quot;itztli&quot;, as mentioned.

==Value==

Obsidian was widely distributed throughout Mesoamerica by trade. Its importance to Mesoamerican societies has been compared to the value and importance of steel to modern civilization. However, archaeology provides varied evidence of the individual value placed on obsidian. For example, during the Preclassic period, obsidian was a rare item in the lowland areas, found predominantly in high-status and ritual contexts. In many Maya excavations evidence of obsidian is likewise found most frequently in privileged settings. As the Late Classic period progressed, obsidian became increasingly accessible to the lower classes of Maya civilization. Nevertheless, the Maya upper classes continued to remain in possession of the more prestigious Teotihuacan green obsidian.

In the Teotihuacan culture obsidian was perhaps traded at a loss of human effort in transport across long distances. The profit from the trade lay in prestigious high-status items received in return. Obsidian has both been seen as a key element to Teotihuacan&#x27;s rise to power and as a side trade element that simply augmented their already developing wealth. Obsidian forms part of many high-status items, such as valuable ear-spools, but these obsidian ear-spools have also been discovered in exclusively lower-status settings. Thus the value of obsidian can be considered highly variable. It was an important trade item, but is found in a variety of environments, unlike many items whose ownership was confined to the upper classes. Finally, there is no indication that obsidian was used as a currency in Mesoamerica.

<text>The Phrygian cap ( ), also known as Thracian cap and liberty cap, is a soft conical cap with the apex bent over, associated in antiquity with several peoples in Eastern Europe, Anatolia, and Asia. The Phrygian cap was worn by Thracians, Dacians, Persians, Medes, Scythians, Trojans, and Phrygians after whom it is named. The oldest known depiction of the Phrygian cap is from Persepolis in Iran.

Although Phrygian caps did not originally function as liberty caps, they came to signify freedom and the pursuit of liberty first in the American Revolution and then in the French Revolution, particularly as a symbol of Jacobinism (in which context it has been also called a Jacobin cap). The original cap of liberty was the Roman &quot;pileus&quot;, the felt cap of emancipated slaves of ancient Rome, which was an attribute of Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty. In the 16th century, the Roman iconography of liberty was revived in emblem books and numismatic handbooks where the figure of Libertas is usually depicted with a &quot;pileus&quot;. The most extensive use of headgear as a symbol of freedom in the first two centuries after the revival of the Roman iconography was made in the Netherlands, where the cap of liberty was adopted in the form of a contemporary hat. In the 18th century, the traditional liberty cap was widely used in English prints, and from 1789 also in French prints; by the early 1790s, it was regularly used in the Phrygian form.

It is used in the coat of arms of certain republics or of republican state institutions in the place where otherwise a crown would be used (in the heraldry of monarchies). It thus came to be identified as a symbol of republican government. A number of national personifications, in particular France&#x27;s Marianne, are commonly depicted wearing the Phrygian cap. Scientists pointed to the cultural and historical relationship of the Phrygian cap with the kurkhars—the national female headdress of the Ingush people. The protagonists of the Belgian comic series &quot;The Smurfs&quot; wear white phrygian caps.

== In antiquity ==
=== In the Iranian world ===

What came to be labelled as the Phrygian cap was originally used by several Iranian peoples, including the Scythians, the Medes, and the Persians. From the reports of the ancient Greeks, it appears that the Iranian variant also was a soft headdress and called a &quot;tiara&quot;.

The Greeks identified one variant with their eastern neighbors and labeled it the &quot;Phrygian cap&quot;, although it was actually worn by nearly all Iranian tribes, from the Cappadocians (Old Persian &quot;Katpatuka&quot;) in the west to the Sakas (OPers. &quot;Sakā&quot;) in the northeast. This and other variants can be observed in the reliefs at Persepolis. All seem to have been made of soft material with long flaps over the ears and the neck, but the form of the top varies. The famous &quot;upright (&quot;orthē&quot;) tiara&quot; was worn by the king. Members of the Median upper class wore high, crested tiaras.

=== In the early Hellenistic world ===

By the 4th century BC (early Hellenistic period), the Phrygian cap was associated with Phrygian Attis, the consort of Cybele, the cult of which had by then become hellenized. The cap appears in depictions of the mythological kings Midas and Rhesus of Thrace, the legendary bard Orpheus and other Thraco-Phrygians portrayed in Greek vase-paintings and sculpture. Such images predate the earliest surviving literary references to the cap.


By extension, the Phrygian cap also came to be applied to several other non-Greek-speaking peoples (&quot;barbarians&quot; in the classical sense). Most notable of these extended senses of &quot;Phrygian&quot; were the Trojans and other western Anatolian peoples, who in Greek perception were synonymous with the Phrygians, and whose heroes Paris, Aeneas, and Ganymede were all regularly depicted with a Phrygian cap. Other Greek earthenware of antiquity also depict Amazons and so-called &quot;Scythian&quot; archers with Phrygian caps. Although these are military depictions, the headgear is distinguished from &quot;Phrygian helmets&quot; by long ear flaps, and the figures are also identified as &quot;barbarians&quot; by their trousers. The headgear also appears in 2nd-century BC Boeotian Tanagra figurines of an effeminate Eros, and in various 1st-century BC statuary of the Commagene, in eastern Anatolia. Greek representations of Thracians also regularly appear with Phrygian caps, most notably Bendis, the Thracian goddess of the Moon and the hunt, and Orpheus, a legendary Thracian poet and musician.

While the Phrygian cap was of wool or soft leather, in pre-Hellenistic times the Greeks had already developed a military helmet that had a similarly characteristic flipped-over tip. These so-called &quot;Phrygian helmets&quot; (named in modern times after the cap) were usually of bronze and in prominent use in Thrace, Dacia, Magna Graecia, and the rest of the Hellenistic world from the 5th century BC up to Roman times. Due to their superficial similarity, the cap and helmet are often difficult to distinguish in Greek art (especially in black-figure or red-figure earthenware) unless the headgear is identified as a soft flexible cap by long earflaps or a long neck flap. Also confusingly similar are the depictions of the helmets used by cavalry and light infantry (&quot;cf.&quot; Peltasts of Thrace and Paeonia), whose headgear – aside from the traditional &quot;alopekis&quot; caps of fox skin – also included stiff leather helmets in imitation of the bronze ones.

=== In the Roman world ===

The Greek concept passed to the Romans in its extended sense, and thus encompassed not only to Phrygians or Trojans (which the Romans also generally associated with the term &quot;Phrygian&quot;), but also the other near-neighbours of the Greeks. On Trajan&#x27;s Column, which commemorated Trajan&#x27;s epic wars with the Dacians (101–102 and 105–106 AD), the Phrygian cap adorns the heads of Dacian warriors. The prisoner, accompanying Trajan in the monumental, three meter tall statue of Trajan in the ancient city of Laodicea, is wearing a Phrygian cap. Parthians appear with Phrygian caps in the 2nd-century Arch of Septimius Severus, which commemorates Roman victories over the Parthian Empire. Likewise with Phrygians caps, but for Gauls, appear in 2nd-century friezes built into the 4th-century Arch of Constantine.

The Phrygian cap reappears in figures related to the first to fourth century religion of Mithraism. This astrology-centric Roman mystery cult (&quot;cultus&quot;) projected itself with pseudo-Oriental trappings (known as &quot;perserie&quot; in scholarship) in order to distinguish itself from both traditional Roman religion and from the other mystery cults. In the artwork of the cult (e.g. in the so-called &quot;tauroctony&quot; cult images), the figures of the god Mithras as well as those of his helpers Cautes and Cautopates are routinely depicted with a Phrygian cap. The function of the Phrygian cap in the cult are unknown, but it is conventionally identified as an accessory of its &quot;perserie&quot;.

Early Christian art (and continuing well into the Middle Ages) build on the same Greco-Roman perceptions of (Pseudo-)Zoroaster and his &quot;Magi&quot; as experts in the arts of astrology and magic, and routinely depict the &quot;three wise men&quot; (that follow a &quot;star&quot;) with Phrygian caps.

== As a symbol of liberty ==
=== From Phrygian to liberty cap ===
In late Republican Rome, a soft felt cap called the &quot;pileus&quot; served as a symbol of freemen (i.e. non-slaves) and was symbolically given to slaves upon manumission, thereby granting them not only their personal liberty, but also &quot;libertas –&quot; freedom as citizens, with the right to vote (if male). Following the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE, Brutus and his co-conspirators instrumentalized this symbolism of the &quot;pileus&quot; to signify the end of Caesar&#x27;s dictatorship and a return to the (Roman) republican system.

These Roman associations of the &quot;pileus&quot; with liberty and republicanism were carried forward to the 18th century, until when the pileus was confused with the Phrygian cap, then becoming a symbol of those values in the wake of Medieval Italian uses of the Phrygian cap, most notably in Venice.

In Venice, the Phrygian cap was used by the Doge instead of a crown as a symbol of Republican liberty, from the Middle Ages until 1797. The symbol of Libertas as a female figure holding the Phrygian cap upon a spear appeared in the 1500’s in the Apotheosis of Venice, a major painting by Paolo Veronese in the Ducal palace, iconography that would later be reused in French and American art and coinage.

=== France&#x27;s &quot;bonnet rouge&quot; ===


==== In revolutionary France ====
In 1675, the anti-tax and anti-nobility Stamp-Paper revolt erupted in Brittany and north-western France, where it became known as the &quot;bonnets rouges&quot; uprising after the blue or red caps worn by the insurgents. Although the insurgents are not known to have preferred any particular style of cap, the name and color stuck as a symbol of revolt against the nobility and establishment. Robespierre would later object to the color, but was ignored.

The use of a Phrygian-style cap as a symbol of revolutionary France is first documented in May 1790, at a festival in Troyes adorning a statue representing the nation, and at Lyon, on a lance carried by the goddess Libertas. To this day the national allegory of France, Marianne, is shown wearing a red Phrygian cap.

By wearing the &quot;bonnet rouge&quot; and &quot;sans-culottes&quot; (&quot;without silk breeches&quot;), the Parisian working class made their revolutionary ardor and plebeian solidarity immediately recognizable. By mid-1791, these mocking fashion statements included the &quot;bonnet rouge&quot; as Parisian hairstyle, proclaimed by the Marquis de Villette (12 July 1791) as &quot;the civic crown of the free man and French regeneration.&quot; On 15 July 1792, seeking to suppress the frivolity, François Christophe Kellermann, 1st Duc de Valmy, published an essay in which the Duke sought to establish the &quot;bonnet rouge&quot; as a sacred symbol that could only be worn by those with merit. The symbolic hairstyle became a rallying point and a way to mock the elaborate wigs of the aristocrats and the red caps of the bishops. On 6 November 1793, the Paris city council declared it the official hairstyle of all its members.

The &quot;bonnet rouge&quot; on a spear was proposed as a component of the national seal on 22 September 1792 during the third session of the National Convention. Following a suggestion by Gaan Coulon, the Convention decreed that convicts would not be permitted to wear the red cap, as it was consecrated as the badge of citizenship and freedom. In 1792, when Louis XVI was induced to sign a constitution, popular prints of the king were doctored to show him wearing the &quot;bonnet rouge&quot;. The bust of Voltaire was crowned with the red bonnet of liberty after a performance of his &quot;Brutus&quot; at the Comédie-Française in March 1792.

During the period of the Reign of Terror (September 1793 – July 1794), the cap was adopted defensively even by those who might be denounced as moderates or aristocrats and were especially keen to advertise their adherence to the new regime. The caps were often knitted by women known as &quot;tricoteuses&quot;, who sat beside the guillotine during public executions in Paris and supposedly continued knitting in between executions. The spire of Strasbourg Cathedral was crowned with a &quot;bonnet rouge&quot; in order to prevent it from being torn down in 1794.

==== During the Restoration ====
In 1814, the &quot;Acte de déchéance de l&#x27;Empereur&quot; decision formally deposed the Bonapartes and restored the Bourbon regime, who in turn proscribed the &quot;bonnet rouge&quot;, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and Bastille Day celebrations. The symbols reappeared briefly in March–July 1815 during &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Hundred Days&quot;, but were immediately suppressed again following the second restoration of Louis XVIII on 8 July 1815.

The symbols resurfaced again during the July Revolution of 1830, after which they were reinstated by the liberal July Monarchy of Louis Philippe I, and the revolutionary symbolsanthem, holiday, and &quot;bonnet rouge&quot;became &quot;constituent parts of a national heritage consecrated by the state and embraced by the public.&quot;

==== In modern France ====
The republican associations with the &quot;bonnet rouge&quot; were adopted as the name and emblem of a French satirical republican and anarchist periodical published between 1913 and 1922 by Miguel Almereyda that targeted the Action française, a royalist, counter-revolutionary movement on the extreme right.

The anti-tax associations with the &quot;bonnet rouge&quot; were revived in October 2013, when a French tax-protest movement called the &quot;Bonnets Rouges&quot; used the red revolution-era Phrygian cap as a protest symbol. By means of large demonstrations and direct action, which included the destruction of many highway tax portals, the movement successfully forced the French government to rescind the tax.

=== In the United Kingdom ===
In the 18th century, the cap was often used in English political prints as an attribute of Liberty. In Blackburn, England, on 5 July 1819, female reformers such as Alice Kitchen attended their first reform meeting and presented the chair John Knight with a &quot;most beautiful Cap of Liberty, made of scarlet silk or satin, lined with green, with a serpentined gold lace, terminating with a rich gold tassel.

=== In Revolutionary America ===
In the years just prior to the Revolutionary War, Americans copied or emulated some of those prints in an attempt to visually defend their &quot;rights as Englishmen&quot;. Later, the symbol of republicanism and anti-monarchical sentiment appeared in the United States as the headgear of Columbia, who in turn was visualized as a goddess-like female national personification of the United States and of Liberty herself. The cap reappears in association with Columbia in the early years of the republic, for example, on the obverse of the 1785 &quot;Immune Columbia&quot; pattern coin, which shows the goddess with a helmet seated on a globe holding in a right hand a furled U.S. flag topped by the liberty cap.

Starting in 1793, U.S. coinage frequently showed Columbia/Liberty wearing the cap. The anti-federalist movement likewise instrumentalized the figure, as in a cartoon from 1796 in which Columbia is overwhelmed by a huge American eagle holding a Liberty Pole under its wings. The cap&#x27;s last appearance on circulating coinage was the Walking Liberty Half Dollar, which was minted through 1947 (and reused on the current bullion American Silver Eagle).

The U.S. Army has, since 1778, used a &quot;War Office Seal&quot; in which the motto &quot;This We&#x27;ll Defend&quot; is displayed directly over a Phrygian cap on an upturned sword. It also appears on the state flags of West Virginia and Idaho (as part of their official seals), New Jersey, and New York, as well as the official seal of the United States Senate, the state of Iowa, the state of North Carolina (as well as the arms of its Senate,) and on the reverse side of both the Seal of Pennsylvania and the Seal of Virginia.

In 1854, when sculptor Thomas Crawford was preparing models for sculpture for the United States Capitol, then-Secretary of War Jefferson Davis insisted that a Phrygian cap not be included on a &quot;Statue of Freedom&quot;, on the grounds that &quot;American liberty is original and not the liberty of the freed slave&quot;. The cap was not included in the final bronze version that is now in the building.

=== In Latin America and Haiti ===

Many of the anti-colonial revolutions in Latin America were heavily inspired by the imagery and slogans of the American and French Revolutions. As a result, the cap has appeared on the coats of arms of many Latin American nations. The coat of arms of Haiti includes a Phrygian cap to commemorate that country&#x27;s foundation by rebellious slaves.

The cap had also been displayed on certain Mexican coins (most notably the old 8-reales coin) through the late 19th century into the mid-20th century. Today, it is featured on the coats of arms or national flags of Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Republica Dominicana, Cuba, El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Paraguay.

== In popular culture ==
In the Belgian comic franchise The Smurfs, the eponymous Smurfs are typically depicted wearing Phrygian-like caps.

Announced in November 2022, the official mascots of Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, named &quot;The Phryges&quot;, were based on the cap.

<text>Saunders Mac Lane (August 4, 1909 – April 14, 2005), born Leslie Saunders MacLane, was an American mathematician who co-founded category theory with Samuel Eilenberg.

==Early life and education==
Mac Lane was born in Norwich, Connecticut, near where his family lived in Taftville. He was christened &quot;Leslie Saunders MacLane&quot;, but &quot;Leslie&quot; fell into disuse because his parents, Donald MacLane and Winifred Saunders, came to dislike it. He began inserting a space into his surname because his first wife found it difficult to type the name without a space. He was the eldest of three brothers; one of his brothers, Gerald MacLane, also became a mathematics professor at Rice University and Purdue University. Another sister died as a baby. His father and grandfather were both ministers; his grandfather had been a Presbyterian, but was kicked out of the church for believing in evolution, and his father was a Congregationalist. His mother, Winifred, studied at Mount Holyoke College and taught English, Latin, and mathematics.

In high school, Mac Lane&#x27;s favorite subject was chemistry. While in high school, his father died, and he came under his grandfather&#x27;s care. His half-uncle, a lawyer, was determined to send him to Yale University, where many of his relatives had been educated, and paid his way there beginning in 1926. As a freshman, he became disillusioned with chemistry. His mathematics instructor, Lester S. Hill, coached him for a local mathematics competition which he won, setting the direction for his future work. He went on to study mathematics and physics as a double major, taking courses from Jesse Beams, Ernest William Brown, Ernest Lawrence, F. S. C. Northrop, and Øystein Ore, among others. He graduated from Yale with a B.A. in 1930. During this period, he published his first scientific paper, in physics and co-authored with Irving Langmuir.

In 1929, at a party of Yale football supporters in Montclair, New Jersey, Mac Lane (there to be presented with a prize for having the best grade point average yet recorded at Yale) had met Robert Maynard Hutchins, the new president of the University of Chicago, who encouraged him to go there for his graduate studies and soon afterwards offered him a scholarship. Mac Lane neglected to actually apply to the program, but showed up and was admitted anyway. At Chicago, the subjects he studied included set theory with E. H. Moore, number theory with Leonard Eugene Dickson, the calculus of variations with Gilbert Ames Bliss, and logic with Mortimer J. Adler.

In 1931, having earned his master&#x27;s degree and feeling restless at Chicago, he earned a fellowship from the Institute of International Education and became one of the last Americans to study at the University of Göttingen prior to its decline under the Nazis. His greatest influences there were Paul Bernays and Hermann Weyl. By the time he finished his doctorate in 1934, Bernays had been forced to leave because he was Jewish, and Weyl became his main examiner. At Göttingen, Mac Lane also studied with Gustav Herglotz and Emmy Noether. Within days of finishing his degree, he married Dorothy Jones, from Chicago, and soon returned to the U.S.

==Career==
From 1934 through 1938, Mac Lane held short-term appointments at Yale University, Harvard University, Cornell University, and the University of Chicago. He then held a tenure track appointment at Harvard from 1938 to 1947. In 1941, while giving a series of visiting lectures at the University of Michigan, he met Samuel Eilenberg and began what would become a fruitful collaboration on the interplay between algebra and topology. In 1944 and 1945, he directed Columbia University&#x27;s Applied Mathematics Group, which was involved in the war effort as a contractor for the Applied Mathematics Panel; the mathematics he worked on in this group concerned differential equations for fire-control systems.

In 1947, he accepted an offer to return to Chicago, where (in part because of the university&#x27;s involvement in the Manhattan Project, and in part because of the administrative efforts of Marshall Stone) many other famous mathematicians and physicists had also recently moved. He traveled as a Guggenheim Fellow to ETH Zurich for the 1947–1948 term, where he worked with Heinz Hopf. Mac Lane succeeded Stone as department chair in 1952, and served for six years.

He was vice president of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, and president of the American Mathematical Society. While presiding over the Mathematical Association of America in the 1950s, he initiated its activities aimed at improving the teaching of modern mathematics. He was a member of the National Science Board, 1974–1980, advising the American government. In 1976, he led a delegation of mathematicians to China to study the conditions affecting mathematics there. Mac Lane was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1949, and received the National Medal of Science in 1989.

==Contributions==

After a thesis in mathematical logic, Mac Lane&#x27;s early work was in field theory and valuation theory. He wrote on valuation rings and Witt vectors, and separability in infinite field extensions. He started writing on group extensions in 1942, and in 1943 began his research on what are now called Eilenberg–MacLane spaces K(&quot;G&quot;,&quot;n&quot;), having a single non-trivial homotopy group &quot;G&quot; in dimension &quot;n&quot;. This work opened the way to group cohomology in general.

After introducing, via the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms, the abstract approach to homology theory, he and Eilenberg originated category theory in 1945. He is especially known for his work on coherence theorems. A recurring feature of category theory, abstract algebra, and of some other mathematics as well, is the use of diagrams, consisting of arrows (morphisms) linking objects, such as products and coproducts. According to McLarty (2005), this diagrammatic approach to contemporary mathematics largely stems from Mac Lane (1948), who also coined the term Yoneda lemma for a lemma which is an essential background to many central concepts of category theory and which was discovered by Nobuo Yoneda.

Mac Lane had an exemplary devotion to writing approachable texts, starting with his very influential &quot;A Survey of Modern Algebra&quot;, coauthored in 1941 with Garrett Birkhoff. From then on, it was possible to teach elementary modern algebra to undergraduates using an English text. His &quot;Categories for the Working Mathematician&quot; remains the definitive introduction to category theory.

<doc id="336576" wikidata="Q434207" url="?curid=336576" title="Tian Han">
<text>Tian Han (; 12 March 1898 – 10 December 1968), formerly romanized as T&#x27;ien Han, was a Chinese drama activist, playwright, a leader of revolutionary music and films, as well as a translator and poet. He emerged at the time of the New Culture Movement of the early 20th century and continued to be active until the Cultural Revolution, when he was denounced and jailed for two years until his death, before being &quot;posthumously rehabilitated&quot; by the Chinese authorities in 1979. He is considered by drama historians as one of the three founders of Chinese spoken drama, together with Ouyang Yuqian and Hong Shen. His most famous legacy may be the lyrics he wrote for &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; in 1934, which were later adopted as the national anthem of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Biography==

During the May Fourth Movement in 1919, Tian became famous for the vigorous anti-imperialist and anti-feudalist activities in the circle of artists and intellectuals he gathered.

Tian was educated at Tokyo Higher Normal School (present-day University of Tsukuba) in Japan. Returning from Japan in 1921, Tian established the Creation Society together with Guo Moruo and Yu Dafu, and other Chinese intellectuals. The Southern China Society, also headed by Tian, played a leading role in promoting dramatic performances in southern China. In 1927, Tian taught at the Department of Literature of Shanghai Art University. Later, he joined The League of Chinese Left-Wing Dramatists. In 1934, he collaborated with the activist Liu Liangmo on the patriotic anthem, March of the Volunteers.

Tian used various aliases and pen names including his courtesy name Tián Shòuchāng (), Bóhóng (), Chén Yú (), Shùrén (), and Hànxiān ().

Tian, then Chairman of the Union of Chinese Drama Workers and Vice-Chairman of the All China&#x27;s Federation of Literary and Art Circles, was targeted by the Gang of Four and attacked during the Cultural Revolution in 1966 for his historical play &quot;Xie Yaohuan&quot; (1961), which was regarded as an attack on Chairman Mao&#x27;s policies and the CCP leadership. Criticism of this play, along with two other historical plays (&quot;Hai Rui Dismissed from Office&quot; by Wu Han and &quot;Li Huiniang&quot; by Meng Chao), were the opening salvos of the Cultural Revolution. Tian was denounced in a 1 February 1966 &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; article entitled &quot;Xie Yaohuan is a Big Poisonous Weed&quot; (田汉的《谢瑶环》是一棵大毒草 &quot;Tián Hàn de Xiè Yáohuán Shì yī kē Dà Dúcǎo&quot;). The &quot;Jiefang Daily&quot; called &quot;Xie Yaohuan&quot; a &quot;political manifesto&quot;. The play was condemned for, among other things, of &quot;being a wholesale inheritance of China&#x27;s theatrical legacy and promoting traditional plays&quot;, &quot;disparaging revolutionary modern plays&quot; and &quot;promoting bourgeois class liberalism and obfuscating the direction for the workers, peasants and soldiers&quot;. Tian was subsequently persecuted by the Gang of Four and incarcerated as a &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot; in a prison which was run personally by Kang Sheng, and died there in 1968. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, he and &quot;Xie Yaohuan&quot; were “rehabilitated posthumously” (considered to be rehabilitated after death) in 1979.

==In popular culture==
Tian Han was the prototype for the figure of &quot;Kuang Wentao&quot; (played by Bo Gao) in the 1959 biopic &quot;Nie Er&quot;, which retold the story of the composition of the Chinese National Anthem on the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic. For the 50th anniversary in 1999, he was represented directly in the film &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, played by He Zhengjun. His story was also told in &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, a 27-episode television series, and in the play &quot;Torrent&quot; (, &quot;Kuángliú&quot;), produced in Beijing in the year 2000.

In the 2009 film &quot;The Founding of a Republic&quot;, he was portrayed by Donnie Yen.

<text>The World Baptist Fellowship (WBF) is a separatist fundamentalist Independent Baptist organization. The organization was founded by J. Frank Norris (1877–1952) of Texas, a southern fundamentalist leader in the first half of the 20th century. It is headquartered in Arlington, Texas.

== History ==
J. Frank Norris became a combatant in the fundamentalist/modernist controversy. He edited a paper entitled &quot;The Fundamentalist&quot;. Both the Southern Baptist Convention and the Baptist General Convention of Texas expelled Norris because of his controversial behavior. Norris, C. P. Staley and others formed the Premillennial Missionary Baptist Fellowship in 1933 at Fort Worth, Texas. In 1938, the name was changed to World Fundamental Baptist Missionary Fellowship and then to World Baptist Fellowship (WBF) after the schism that created the Baptist Bible Fellowship International in 1950. The WBF was again divided in 1984, when a group led by Raymond W. Barber established the Independent Baptist Fellowship International and the Norris Bible Baptist Institute.

Arlington Baptist University (the Fellowship&#x27;s official educational institution) was founded in 1939 as Fundamental Baptist Bible Institute.

The World Baptist Fellowship had 945 churches in 1995, with its primary strength in Texas, Florida and Ohio. More than half of these churches also participate in other independent fundamental Baptist fellowships.

==Organization==
The WBF considers itself a missions agency. Its missionary work is headed by the Mission Committee, whose members are nominated by the existing committee and approved by the General Assembly in annual meeting. In 2003, the WBF had 85 approved missionaries. National Fellowship meetings are held twice per year.

<text>Atropatene (; Pahlavi: &quot;Ādurbādagān&quot; ), also known as Media Atropatene, was an ancient Iranian kingdom established in by the Persian satrap Atropates. The kingdom, centered in present-day northern Iran, was ruled by Atropates&#x27; descendants until the early 1st-century AD, when the Parthian Arsacid dynasty supplanted them. It was conquered by the Sasanians in 226, and turned into a province governed by a &quot;marzban&quot; (&quot;margrave&quot;). Atropatene was the only Iranian region to remain under Zoroastrian authority from the Achaemenids to the Arab conquest without interruption, aside from being briefly ruled by the Macedonian king Alexander the Great ().

The name of Atropatene was also the nominal ancestor of the name of the historic Azerbaijan region in Iran.

== Name ==
According to Strabo, the name of Atropatene derived from the name of Atropates, the commander of the Achaemenid Empire. As he writes in his book “Geography”: &quot;Media is divided into two parts. One part of it is called Greater Media, of which the metropolis is Ecbatana. The other part is Atropatian Media, which got its name from the commander Atropates, who prevented also this country, which was a part of Greater Media, from becoming subject to the Macedonians&quot;.

From the name of Atropates, different forms of the name of this country such as Atropatene, Atropatios Mēdia, Tropatene, Aturpatakan, Adarbayjan were used in different sources. Nevertheless, medieval Arab geographers suggested another version associating this name with Adorbador (the name of a priest) that means “guardian of the fire”.

==History==

In 331 BC, during the Battle of Gaugamela between the Achaemenid ruler Darius III and Alexander the Great, Medes, Albans, Sakasens, Cadusians fought alongside the army of the Achaemenid Great King in the army of Atropates. After this war, which resulted in the victory of Alexander the Great and the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, Atropates expressed his loyalty to Alexander. In 328-327 BC, Alexander appointed him governor of Media. Following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, the Macedonian&#x27;s conquests were divided amongst the diadochi at the Partition of Babylon. The former Achaemenid satrapy of Media was divided into two states: The greater (southern) part – &quot;Media Magna&quot; was assigned to Peithon, one of Alexander&#x27;s bodyguards.

The smaller (northern) region, which had been the sub-satrapy of Matiene, became &quot;Media Atropatene&quot; under Atropates, the former Achaemenid governor of all Media, who had by then become father-in-law of Perdiccas, regent of Alexander&#x27;s designated successor. Shortly thereafter, Atropates refused to pay allegiance to Seleucus, and made Media Atropatene an independent kingdom. In 223 BCE, Antiochus III came to power in the Seleucid Empire, one of the Hellenistic states that had emerged following the death of Alexander. Antiochus attacked Atropatene, resulting in a victory.

Consequently, the king of Atropatene, Artabazanes, accepted the ascendency of Seleucids and became dependent on it; on the other hand, interior independence was preserved. At the same time, the Roman Empire came into sight in the Mediterranean basin and was trying to spread its power in the East, and in 190 B.C., its army met and defeated the Seleucids&#x27; army in the battle of Magnesia. Parthia and Atropatene subsequently considered Rome a threat to their independence and allied themselves in the struggle against Rome.

After the battle between Rome and the Parthians in 38 BC, the Romans won and the Roman general Antony attacked Fraaspa (36 BC), one of the central cities of Atropatene. The city was surrounded by strong defenses. After a long blockade, Antony receded, losing approximately thirty-five thousand soldiers. In the face of Parthian attempts to annex Atropatene, Atropatene began to draw closer to Rome, thus, Ariobarzan II, who came to power in Atropatene in 20 BC, lived in Rome for about ten years. The dynasty Atropates founded would rule the kingdom for several centuries, first independently, then as vassals of the Arsacids (who called it &#x27;Aturpatakan&#x27;). It was later supplanted by a line of the Arsacids.

During the late Parthian era, the empire was declining, resulting in the weakening of hold over western Iran. The Iranologist Touraj Daryaee argues that the reign of the Parthian monarch Vologases V () was &quot;the turning point in Arsacid history, in that the dynasty lost much of its prestige.&quot; The people of Atropatene (both nobility and peasantry) allied themselves with the Persian Sasanian prince Ardashir I () during his wars against Vologases V&#x27;s son and second successor Artabanus IV (). In 226, Atropatene submitted with little resistance to Ardashir I after he had defeated and killed Artabanus IV at the Battle of Hormozdgan. Ardashir I and his son and heir Shapur I () are depicted in a rock relief near Salmas, possibly a testimonial to the Sasanian conquest of Atropatene. The nobility of Atropatene most likely allied themselves the Sasanians due to a desire for a strong state capable of maintaining order. The priesthood, who may have felt alienated by the easy-going Arsacids, probably also supported the Sasanian family, due to its association with Zoroastrianism.

== Zoroastrianism ==
The oldness of Zoroastrianism led to lack of knowledge about the geography of the Avesta, and also uncertainty about the birthplace of its prophet, Zoroaster. As a result local claims emerged quite easily, and with the appropriate support, even gained acceptance. This resulted in the birthplace of Zoroaster being placed in Atropatene, rather than the east, where he originated.

==Capital==
The main Achaemenid hub in Atropatene was Ganzak (from Median: &quot;Ganzaka&quot;, meaning &quot;treasury&quot;), which presumably served as the capital of Atropates and his successors. The city was situated in a fertile area near Lake Urmia, close to the modern town of Miandoab. The city and its surroundings probably hosted a large Iranian population, whereas much of the Atropatenian population had most likely not been completely Iranianized yet by the 3rd-century BC.

== Legacy ==
Atropatene was the only Iranian region to remain under Zoroastrian authority from the Achaemenids to the Arab conquest without any interruption, aside from being briefly ruled by the Macedonian king Alexander the Great (). Under the Atropatids, the region successfully managed to gain a dominant place in Zoroastrianism, which would continue into the Sasanian period, whose monarchs favored Median traditions over that of the Parthians. Moreover, Atropatene also served as a stronghold of Iranian culture.

==List of rulers==
Albeit the kings of Atropatene ruled for several centuries, only some of them are known. The dates of their reign are uncertain.

<text>Playgirl is an American magazine that has historically featured pictorials of nude and semi-nude men alongside general interest, lifestyle, celebrity journalism, and original fiction. For most of its history, the magazine printed monthly and was marketed mainly to women, though it developed a significant gay male readership.

Since its founding, Playgirl has existed as a monthly and quarterly publication, in print-only, digital-only, and hybrid formats. From 1973–2009, the magazine was issued in a monthly print format, before transitioning to a quarterly print publication in 2009. Regular print operations were paused from 2016–2020, with only an online presence maintained. In November 2020, the magazine relaunched with a 10,000 print run in the U.S. and United Kingdom, before selling out and returning to press for a second printing. After that relaunch, the magazine resumed monthly releases as an online, digital publication.

== History ==
&quot;Playgirl&quot; magazine was founded in 1973 by Los Angeles-based nightclub owner Douglas Lambert, who&#x27;d initially explored creating a men&#x27;s lifestyle magazine featuring nude women to compete with Hugh Hefner&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot;. At the suggestion of his wife, and inspired by the success of Helen Gurley Brown&#x27;s use of male nudes in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine (including a shoot featuring film star Burt Reynolds), Lambert refashioned his idea as a feminist response to &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; instead. In partnership with William Miles Jr., an area advertising executive, Lambert founded &quot;Playgirl&quot; in Century City, California, in 1973 with a $20,000 investment.

=== The Lambert years ===
After two test issues (featuring race car driver Mike Hiss and the Hager Twins, country singers and stars of TV&#x27;s &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, in seminude centerfolds), the magazine, initially styled as &quot;Playgirl: The Magazine for Women&quot; formally debuted in June 1973, featuring television and film star Lyle Waggoner as centerfold and an interview and nude photoshoot with actor Ryan McDonald. Editorial in the issue included a travel pictorial on Hong Kong, long-form interview with actress Cloris Leachman, original fiction by Jillian Charles, and a guide to selecting artwork for the home. The first issue sold out quickly, selling 600,000 copies in four days, and for the rest of the 1970s, the magazine would sell, on average, 1.5 million copies each month.

From its inception, &quot;Playgirl&quot; has featured full frontal nude and semi-nude (rear and obscured frontal) pictorials of men, except for a 10-month period in 1986 and 1987, when following the sale and reorganization of the magazine, new ownership mandated a new approach in the hopes of appealing to a wider readership in an increasingly politically and culturally conservative time. Editorially, the magazine covered hot-button sociopolitical issues like abortion and equal rights for the majority of its print run. In the magazine&#x27;s first decade, it typically did so via long-form journalism, commentary, and feature interviews from well-regarded staff and freelance writers. Through the mid-1980s, in-depth interviews with A-list celebrities and newsmakers, including Maya Angelou, Larry Flynt, Barbra Streisand, and Jane Fonda, were frequently paired with commentary from cultural essayists such as Angelou, and original fiction from both emergent and established writers, including Erica Jong and Truman Capote.

=== The Ritter years ===
In 1977, Lambert sold &quot;Playgirl&quot; to Ira Ritter who took over as publisher, continuing the magazine&#x27;s editorial style and direction (including male nude pictorials) but leaning more publicly into the magazine&#x27;s feminist and journalistic bona fides. Covers in Ritter&#x27;s first years centered women, often alone, to highlight female perspectives on politics and other cultural issues, deemphasizing the nude photography and erotic themes still central to the magazine, in terms of magazine&#x27;s public-facing image and newsstand presence. Results were mixed and in 1986, with readership declines compounded by bad investments by the owners (including the launch of an unsuccessful spin-off publication, &quot;Playgirl Advisor&quot;, with a more direct focus on sex, sexuality, and couples), &quot;Playgirl&quot; filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was subsequently acquired by Drake Publishers, Inc. 

=== Drake Publishers, Inc. ===
Until the 1986 change of ownership, &quot;Playgirl&quot;&#x27;s interviews, journalism, and original fiction were central to the magazine&#x27;s identity and featured and promoted as such. After Drake&#x27;s acquisition of the title, the restructured magazine began featuring simplified beefcake-style covers (usually highlighting a model from the issue in underwear or speedo-style swimwear), and implemented changes to cut costs and expand readership in an increasingly conservative and less feminist-friendly cultural environment of the late Reagan era. This resulted in substantial reductions in the in-depth, substantive journalism, political and social feminist commentary the magazine was known for, a decrease in non-pictorial pages, and an increase in advertising space.

Ultimately, the 1986-87 reorganization of the magazine failed to significantly increase general readership or improve the magazine&#x27;s cultural palatability in the new environment, but did have the effect of eroding the magazine&#x27;s credibility as a substantive mainstream publication that blended erotic content with substantive journalism, repositioned as a niche, adult-oriented publication. 

=== Crescent Publishing Group and Blue Horizon Media ===
The 1993 acquisition of Drake by Crescent Publishing Group, the owner of hardcore magazine like High Society and other pornographic titles, cemented Playgirl&#x27;s reputation as an adult title and, as a result, the number of celebrities and newsmakers sitting for interviews or pictorials rapidly decreased.

Crescent&#x27;s experiments in the 1990s with the publication of celebrity nudes acquired from external sources—including art nudes alleged to be actor Antonio Banderas and intrusive paparazzi photos of actor Brad Pitt (both presented as cover stories), proved short-lived after a series of expensive legal losses and settlements with Banderas, Pitt, and others. Actor Leonardo DiCaprio successfully sued to stop publication of photographs taken without his knowledge, and the pressure from Crescent to publish the photos led to the resignation of Editor-in-Chief, Ceslie Armstrong, who called the photographs &quot;an invasion of privacy [that] I can&#x27;t be associated with.&quot;

By the 2000s, Crescent had fully repositioned the title as an adult brand, relaunching Playgirl&#x27;s website as a pay site primarily featuring co-branded hardcore straight pornography, and increasing explicit content in the print magazine. In August 2000, Crescent was charged by the Federal Trade Commission with over $180 million of online credit card fraud, some of which was alleged by the FTC to have taken place on their new Playgirl website. In November 2001, Crescent agreed to pay $30 million in refunds and subsequently changed its name to Blue Horizon Media, Inc.

In August 2008, the magazine announced that it would cease publication of its print edition as of the January 2009 issue. The last print issue of the magazine&#x27;s initial print run was published as a January/February issue and sold on newsstands through March 2009. &quot;Playgirl&quot; was then published online through February 2010, when print publication resumed with a March issue featuring political celebrity Levi Johnston, shot by longtime &quot;Playgirl&quot; photographer Greg Weiner.

=== Blue Horizon ===
In 2011, Blue Horizon sold the print rights for &quot;Playgirl&quot; and other titles to Magna Publishing Group, Inc. of Paramus, New Jersey, and the magazine continued to publish as a print title, approximately quarterly, until 2016, when with print subscriptions dwindling to approximately 3,000 the title ceased regular print operations.

=== 2020 relaunch and current era ===
In 2020, new owner Jack Lindley Kuhns, a gay man, revived the title, relaunching the &quot;New Playgirl Magazine&quot; with a special print edition, featuring a pregnant and nude actress Chloe Sevigny on the cover (a nod to both Playgirl&#x27;s feminist roots and the magazine&#x27;s early issues, which often featured women on the cover), edited by Skye Parrott. The issue, described by Kuhns as &quot;part political magazine and part art magazine&quot; featured images of nude bodies of all ethnicities and genders, as well as writing about racial injustice, trans empowerment, and body positivity and sold out immediately.

Since the 2020 relaunch, the magazine has moved to a regular publishing cycle as an online-only title split across two domains: &quot;Playgirl.com&quot;, a free site featuring a mix of news, features, and photo essays reside, and &quot;PlaygirlPlus.com&quot;, a subscription site where access to the publication&#x27;s archives and the magazine&#x27;s traditional &quot;Man of the Month&quot; nude photospread, modernized with additional video and multimedia content, are hosted. Nicole Caldwell, a former editor-in-chief during the magazine&#x27;s print run, oversees the online iteration in the same capacity. Under the direction Caldwell, Boardman, and production director Daniel McKernan, the brand has refocused on the traditional male physique and art nude composition the magazine is historically known for, incorporating additional video and multi-media content, moving away from the more explicit depictions of the print magazine&#x27;s final years and reembracing the magazine&#x27;s roots. Both domains highlight the decades of substantive journalism, commentary, fiction, and pictorials from the magazine&#x27;s archives, presenting them in newly digitized formats.

==Celebrities and public figures nude in &quot;Playgirl&quot;==
Many celebrities and public figures have posed nude or semi-nude for &quot;Playgirl&quot; during the magazine&#x27;s initial print and digital incarnations, with &quot;posed&quot; defined as appearing as a model for a shoot for the magazine specifically (versus merely appearing clothed and/or shirtless in the magazine or nude in photos acquired from external sources).

Playgirl featured the highest number of A-list celebrities in nude photoshoots in the 1970s, in the wake of the American sexual revolution and early feminist positioning of the magazine, and 1980s. While many celebrities, such as football legend and actor Jim Brown, World Series MVP Steve Yeager, and actors Lyle Waggoner and Christopher Atkins, posed nude at the height (or near height) of their fame, some, including actors Sam J. Jones and Steve Bond, and country singer Keith Urban, posed earlier in their careers, going on to greater professional success in the years immediately following. Others, like teen idol singer and actor Fabian, Skid Row musician Phil Varone, and supermodel Tim Boyce posed nude for the magazine after the height of their fame, introducing themselves to new generational audiences. In rare occasions, as with fallen 9/11 firefighter Vincent Princiotta, &quot;Playgirl&quot; models came to national prominence posthumously.

With dozens of celebrities and public figures posting for the magazine over the five-decade print runs, circumstances and experiences varied. Many of the early celebrity centerfolds elected to pose in support of the feminist and gender equality aims of the magazine, particularly in response to male-oriented titles like &quot;Playboy&quot;, which already featured nude female celebrities. NFL player Dan Pastorini first posed for the magazine to help pay off a legal settlement, but positive reception to his shoot led to a second appearance shortly after. While film star Atkins told UPI columnist Vernon Scott he&#x27;d posed to &quot;stir up some controversy&quot; in his young career, Olympian Greg Louganis disclosed in his autobiography that he hadn&#x27;t wanted to do his shoot, but felt pressured to do as a marketing vehicle (to bolster the heterosexual &quot;heartthrob&quot; appeal of the then-closeted diver). Singer Johnny Mathis, unhappy with the results of his shoot, requested his feature not run (the magazine agreed), while NFL player Bob Chandler, who posed shortly after his team won the Super Bowl, was pleased with his layout, and displayed a framed shot in his home.

Actor Marcus Patrick claimed then-editors&#x27; use of photos more explicit than agreed cost him his role on the daytime soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and singer Urban jokingly called posing pre-superstardom a &quot;career regret,&quot; finding the photos, which featured him posing nude and in underwear with his guitar, embarrassing. Conversely, musician Peter Steele expressed strong regret for his unusually explicit shoot, reportedly repulsed by the attention he garnered from gay fans. Others, like straight soap opera actor John Gibson, found the attention from male and female fans equally flattering, with Gibson specifically crediting the positive attention from his &quot;Playgirl&quot; appearance for his career shift and subsequent success as an actor, model, and dancer.

While celebrities and public figures from many walks of life—including the military, circus arts, and politics—have posed nude for &quot;Playgirl&quot;, the majority of the magazine&#x27;s high-profile nude models have come from the worlds of film and television acting, professional and world-class athletics (mostly professional baseball, football, and Olympic athletes), and music, including well-known pop, rock, metal, and rap artists. Historically, famous athletes and musicians have posed fully, frontally nude at the highest rates, while actors, generally required to more carefully manage public image and perception, have been more likely to pose for obscured or rear-only nude pictorials (with some notable exceptions).

The number of mainstream celebrities appearing nude in the magazine slowed steadily following a 1986 restructuring (which saw significant cuts to the budget for original features and an end to the high fees previously paid out to celebrity models), and as a result of increasing cultural conservatism at the end of the Reagan Administration and concurrent rise of cultural movements like the Moral Majority, which called for the censorship and restriction of nudity as non-&quot;family friendly&quot; content in American media. With top publicists and representatives for A-list actors and professional athletes more wary of associating with the magazine, celebrity appearances (including A-list interviews) grew rarer. This trend hastened in the final years of the magazine&#x27;s print run, when the magazine&#x27;s owners moved the publication in a more explicit direction. (As a general rule, explicit celebrity photoshoots, featuring erections or sexually suggestive poses with a female model, were exceptionally rare; most exceptions—including Steele, Varone and reality stars Nick Hawk and Joey Kovar—came during this later period in the title&#x27;s history.) In the final years of the print run, celebrity appearances were limited exclusively to personalities from the world of reality television.

In February 2024, the newly relaunched, and no longer explicit, &quot;Playgirl&quot; announced the first celebrity pictorial of its new era—featuring actors Bryan Dattilo, Emmy Award-nominee Paul Telfer, Robert Scott Wilson, and Emmy Award-winner Eric Martsolf, stars of the long-running soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and their former co-star, &quot;Hawai&#x27;i 5-0&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Resistance&quot; actor Christopher Sean would be released in April. 

== Readership and gay following ==
Though the magazine was mainly marketed to heterosexual women, it developed a substantial gay male following. In 2003, then-editor-in-chief Michele Zipp acknowledged the magazine&#x27;s gay readership, noting &quot;it&#x27;s &#x27;Entertainment for Women&#x27; because there&#x27;s no other magazine out there that caters to women in the way we do [but]...we love our gay readers as well, and the gay readership [of the magazine] is about 30%.&quot;

Dirk Shafer, one of the gay men featured later produced a comic mockumentary titled &quot;Man of the Year&quot; in which he discussed balancing his own homosexuality with his role as Playgirl&#x27;s &quot;Man of the Year,&quot; a seemingly heterosexual sex symbol. While the magazine always presented its models as heterosexual, openly gay models have appeared in the magazine, including Scott Merritt, &quot;Playgirl&#x27;s&quot; 30th-anniversary centerfold, who came out publicly in an interview with &quot;The Advocat&quot;e. Some models featured over the magazine&#x27;s print run also posed for gay-focused publications or worked in the gay adult entertainment industry.

*Germany (1978–1980 and 1989–2003)
*France (1978)
*Australia (1985–88) and as &quot;Interlude&quot; in 1991
*Netherlands (1987–88)

When the Russian version of &quot;Playgirl&quot; was launched in June 2004, it contained photographs of nude, circumcised American men despite circumcision&#x27;s being less common outside the U.S., being practiced mainly by Muslims and Jews in Russia.

&quot;Playgirl UK&quot;&#x27;s brief 2011 relaunch was accompanied by an announcement that it would feature no below-the-waist nudity, and would focus on attractive male celebrities rather than models and pornography actors. It was a failure, and ceased circulation soon after it began.

<text>Robin R. Yount (; born September 16, 1955), nicknamed &quot;the Kid&quot; and &quot;Rockin&#x27; Robin&quot;, is an American former professional baseball player. He spent his entire 20-year career in Major League Baseball as a shortstop and center fielder for the Milwaukee Brewers (1974–93).

Yount was drafted in 1973 and advanced to the major leagues one year later at the age of 18. He won two American League Most Valuable Player awards. In 1982, he led the Brewers to a World Series appearance. Yount was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999 in his first year of eligibility. Since his retirement as a player, he has held several roles as a baseball coach.

==Early life==
Robin R. Yount was born September 16, 1955, in Danville, Illinois. He lived briefly in Covington, Indiana, then his family moved to southern California when he was an infant; his father got a job testing rocket engines with Rocketdyne. Robin attended William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
Yount was the third pick overall in the June 1973 Major League Baseball draft, one slot ahead of fellow Hall of Famer and 3,000 hit club member Dave Winfield.

===Milwaukee Brewers (1974–1993)===
Yount made his major league debut the following April, at 18 years old. After going hitless in his first four games, Yount hit a game-winning home run in his sixth. Yount is the last 18-year-old to hit a home run in the Major Leagues (Andruw Jones, Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, and Juan Soto are the most recent teenagers to hit Major League home runs, but did so as 19-year-olds). On September 14, 1975 (two days before his 20th birthday), Yount broke Mel Ott&#x27;s 47-year-old record for most games played in the major leagues before turning 20.

Yount courted controversy in the winter of 1978. He threatened to retire from the game and take up professional golf rather than be underpaid or moved to the outfield by the Brewers. Early in the season, Paul Molitor was called up from the Brewers Class A affiliate to the major league team because of Yount&#x27;s absence. Yount&#x27;s demands were met; when he returned to the team, Molitor was moved from shortstop to second base to make room for Yount.

He was an early proponent of weight training – then uncommon in baseball – and by 1980 Yount&#x27;s power hitting had improved, particularly for a shortstop. Yount was an All-Star in 1980, 1982, and 1983. No other Brewer was voted a starter in consecutive years until Ryan Braun started each year between 2008 and 2011. Before his 26th birthday, Yount had accumulated 1,153 hits, the seventh highest total for a 25-year-old player in MLB history, ahead of Baseball Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron (1,137), Jimmie Foxx (1,127) and Rogers Hornsby (1,073).
Yount led the American League with 210 hits in 1982. The 1982 AL East race was tied on the final day of the season, with the race coming down to a winner-take-all game between the Brewers and the Baltimore Orioles. With the title on the line, Yount hit home runs in each of his first two at-bats against Orioles starter Jim Palmer. Yount finished with a four-hit game, as the Brewers won 10-2. In addition to his only 200-hit season, he registered career highs with 29 home runs, 114 RBI, and a .331 batting average (.001 behind the league leader, Willie Wilson). Yount finished with a .578 slugging percentage and .957 OPS on his way to gaining 367 total bases – leading the major leagues in all three categories. His slugging percentage was the second highest ever by a shortstop, and his 129 runs set the record for that position.

That year, Yount also won his only Gold Glove Award and his first Most Valuable Player Award. His performance garnered 27 of 28 possible first place votes in the 1982 MVP balloting. The year ended with the Brewers making their only World Series appearance. Although Yount became the only player in history to have two 4-hit games in one World Series, Milwaukee lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. Yount batted .414 in the Series, with one home run and 6 RBI.

In 1985, a shoulder problem forced Yount to move to the outfield. After splitting time between center field and left field, Yount became the Brewers&#x27; regular center fielder in 1986. He played more than 1,200 games in the outfield in his career, with a .990 fielding percentage. He made a game-ending, diving catch to preserve a no-hitter by Juan Nieves early in the 1987 season.

Yount narrowly won a second MVP Award in 1989, making him only the third player to win MVPs at two positions, joining Hank Greenberg and Stan Musial (Alex Rodriguez would later join this group). Yount was the first AL player to win multiple MVP awards in over 25 years, since the Yankees&#x27; Roger Maris (1960 and 1961) and Mickey Mantle (1956, 1957, and 1962). Yount collected more hits (1,731) in the decade of the 1980s than any other player.
After the 1989 season, Yount was a free agent and he spoke with several teams about contract offers. The California Angels were prepared to make a serious offer, but Yount signed a three-year contract with the Brewers worth $9.6 million in February 1990. He cited the fact he was more comfortable in Milwaukee (with Bud Selig as owner) than leaving for a different place. At the start of the 1990 season, he had 2,602 hits in his career, which was fourth among players by age 34 to Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, and Hank Aaron. In 1991, Yount was briefly on the disabled list (DL) with a kidney stone, only the second stint on the DL in his career; the first one was in 1978.

On September 9, 1992, Yount collected his 3,000th career hit, becoming the 17th player (and the third-youngest) to reach the mark. He announced his retirement after the 1993 season. The Brewers retired his number the next year. Yount was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, his first year of eligibility. That same year, he was included in the balloting for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, finishing fifth among shortstops.

Yount holds Brewers career records for games, at-bats, runs, hits, doubles, triples, RBIs, total bases, walks and strikeouts. He was the last active major leaguer to have been a teammate of Hank Aaron (1975–1976). He posted a career .285 batting average with 251 home runs, 3,142 hits, 1,632 runs scored, 583 doubles, 126 triples, 1,406 RBI, 271 stolen bases and 966 walks. His 11,008 career at-bats is the ninth-most in Major League Baseball history (through the end of the 2020 season), and he ranks 20th on the all-time hit list. His three All-Star appearances are tied with Ferguson Jenkins for the second-fewest of any Hall of Famer from the All-Star Game era, and he won a second MVP Award in 1989 without making the All-Star Team.

==Coaching career==

Yount served as first base coach and bench coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks from 2002 to 2004. He resigned after the dismissal of Arizona manager Bob Brenly. He, Hank Aaron, Warren Spahn and Bob Uecker threw out the ceremonial first pitches at the 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Miller Park.

In 2005, Brewers manager Ned Yost convinced Dale Sveum, a teammate of Yount&#x27;s, to become Milwaukee&#x27;s new third base coach. Yount followed suit a few weeks later, accepting a post as the Brewers&#x27; bench coach. In November 2006, Yount announced he would not return to the team as bench coach for the 2007 season. However, on September 15, 2008, Sveum, by now the team&#x27;s manager, chose Yount as his bench coach.

In 2012, when Sveum was named the Chicago Cubs new manager, rumors quickly spread that Sveum would ask Yount to coach with him, even though the Brewers and Cubs had become bitter rivals. Sveum very quickly confirmed that he was not even considering such a move. As of 2014, Yount is a special instructor in spring training for the Brewers.

==Legacy==

Yount is widely considered to be the greatest player in Brewers history. His 77.3 bWAR is 17 points higher than anyone else in franchise history. Yount is the only Brewer to win multiple MVP awards and one of three members of the franchise to reach 3,000 hits (Paul Molitor and Hank Aaron) and the only member of the franchise to do it solely as a Brewer. Yount is also the Brewers’ all-time leader in games, hits, at-bats, plate appearances, runs, doubles, triples, runs batted in, and walks.

Yount is a popular figure in Milwaukee and often attends Brewers On Deck, the team’s annual preseason fan-fest. Yount’s number 19 is one of six numbers retired by the Brewers. His statue on the grounds of American Family Field is one of just four such statues erected by the Brewers. Yount was a charter member of the Milwaukee Brewers Wall of Honor when it was created in 2014.

==Personal life==
Yount met his wife, Michele Edelstein, at Taft High School. They later reconnected, and have been married since 1979. Robin and Michele Yount have four children: Melissa, Amy, Dustin, and Jenna.

Yount&#x27;s older brother Larry was a pitcher and was briefly called up to play in the major leagues. While taking his warmup tosses for his debut as a Houston Astros reliever in 1971, he experienced elbow pain. He never threw an official pitch in any MLB game, but is considered to have played one game, as he was officially put in to pitch. Yount&#x27;s son Dustin played baseball in the minor leagues for several years. Yount&#x27;s nephew Austin Yount played professional baseball for the Dodgers organization. Another nephew, Cody Yount, played college baseball for Pepperdine University.

Since retiring from baseball, Yount has increased his participation in two of his other passions, professional motorcycle and auto racing. In June 2008, Yount announced the creation of a new all-natural lemonade drink, &quot;Robinade&quot;. A portion of the proceeds go to charity. While hunting in Arizona in 2012, Yount accidentally shot friend and former teammate Dale Sveum with pellets from his shotgun, hitting him in the back and ear. Sveum&#x27;s injuries were minor.

In 2012, Yount became a minority owner of the Lakeshore Chinooks of the Northwoods League, a collegiate summer baseball league. The Chinooks play at Kapco Park at Concordia University Wisconsin where the right field fence is 319 feet in his honor (a reference to Yount wearing number 19).

In 2014, Yount was honored with the &quot;Lombardi Award of Excellence&quot; from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Lombardi&#x27;s legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the acclaimed football coach.

On October 20, 2018, Yount threw out the first pitch before Game 7 of the National League Championship Series between the Dodgers and Brewers.

<doc id="336606" wikidata="Q233359" url="?curid=336606" title="Atossa">
<text>Atossa (Old Persian: &quot;Utauθa&quot;, or Old Iranian: &quot;Hutauθa&quot;; 550–475 BC) was an Achaemenid empress. She was the daughter of Cyrus the Great, the sister of Cambyses II, the wife of Darius the Great, the mother of Xerxes the Great and the grandmother of Artaxerxes I.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Atossa&quot; (or &quot;Atusa&quot;) means &quot;bestowing very richly&quot; or &quot;well trickling&quot; or &quot;well granting&quot;. Atossa is the Greek () transliteration of the Old Persian name &quot;Utauθa.&quot; Her name in Avestan is &quot;Hutaosā&quot;.

== Life ==
Atossa was born in . She was eldest daughter of Cyrus the Great; her mother may have been Cassandane. According to Greek sources she married her brother Cambyses II after her father&#x27;s death, yet it remains problematic to determine the reliability of these accounts. According to Herodotus, Cambyses supposedly married two of his sisters, Atossa and Roxane. This would have been regarded as illegal. However, Herodotus also states that Cambyses married Otanes&#x27; daughter Phaidyme, whilst his contemporary Ctesias names Roxane as Cambyses&#x27; wife, but she is not referred to as his sister.

Accusations against Cambyses for committing incest are used as a way to vilify him: painting him as mad and vain. This is a common historiographical issue faced in many older historical texts on Persia. For example, one of the primary records of his incestuous acts is from an Egyptian text which antagonizes many of his actions, far beyond incest. However, many of the allegations within the text, such as the killing of the Apis bull, have been confirmed as false, which means that the report of Cambyses&#x27; supposed incestuous acts are also contestable.

When Darius I defeated the followers of a man claiming to be Bardiya (Smerdis), the younger brother of Cambyses II in 522 BC, he married Atossa. Atossa played an important role in the Achaemenid royal family, as she bore Darius the Great the next Achaemenid king, Xerxes I.

Atossa had great authority in the Achaemenid royal house and her marriage with Darius I is likely due to her power, influence and the fact that she was the daughter of the founder of the Achaemenid Empire.

Herodotus records in &quot;The Histories&quot; that Atossa was troubled by a bleeding lump in her breast. A Greek slave, Democedes, excised the tumor. This is the first recorded case of mastitis, sometimes interpreted as a sign of an inflammatory breast cancer.

Xerxes I was the eldest son of Atossa and Darius. Atossa lived to see Xerxes invade Greece. Atossa&#x27;s special position enabled Xerxes, who was not the eldest son of Darius, to succeed his father.

==Literary references==
Aeschylus included her as a central character in his tragedy &quot;The Persians&quot;. Atossa is also one of the major characters in the Gore Vidal novel &quot;Creation&quot;.

Atossa is included by Herodotus in his &quot;The Histories&quot; as a strong woman with considerable influence. Herodotus even goes so far as to suggest that her wanting Hellene servant-girls was a reason for her husband Darius the Great deciding to begin a campaign against Greece
in 492 BC.

In his non-fictional history of cancer, &quot;The Emperor of All Maladies&quot;, Siddhartha Mukherjee imagines Atossa traveling through time, encountering different diagnoses and treatments for her breast cancer. Atossa becomes emblematic of cancer sufferers through history.

Dr. Jason Fung, in his book The Cancer Code, references Atossa&#x27;s inflammatory breast cancer as written about by the contemporary Greek historian Herodotus. 

== Legacy ==
Minor planet 810 Atossa discovered by Max Wolf, is named in her honor.

She is celebrated in Matthew Arnold&#x27;s 1882 poem ‘Poor Matthias’, which was about the death of a pet canary.

<doc id="336608" wikidata="Q3155643" url="?curid=336608" title="Izzy Asper">
<text>Israel Harold &quot;Izzy&quot; Asper (August 11, 1932 – October 7, 2003) was a Canadian tax lawyer and media magnate. He was the founder and owner of the now-defunct TV and media company CanWest Global Communications Corp and father to its former CEO and President Leonard Asper, former director and corporate secretary Gail Asper, and former Executive Vice President David Asper. He was also the leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party from 1970 to 1975 and is credited with the idea and vision to establish the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.

== Personal life and education ==
Israel Asper was born on August 11, 1932, to a Jewish family in Minnedosa, Manitoba, the son of musicians Leon Asper and Cecilia Swet, who had emigrated from Ukraine in the 1920s.

Asper married Ruth Miriam &quot;Babs&quot; Bernstein on May 27, 1956, at Shaarey Zedek Synagogue, Winnipeg.

Asper attended the University of Manitoba Law School in Winnipeg, where he received his law degree in 1957 and was called to the bar shortly thereafter in July, eventually receiving a Master of Laws in 1964.

On October 7, 2003, Asper died in St. Boniface Hospital at the age of 71 after suffering a heart attack. He was buried in the Shaarey Zedek Cemetery in Winnipeg in the presence of 1,500 mourners, including Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and leading politicians.

== Career ==
He founded the firm of Asper, Freedman &amp; Co. in 1959, and was also a partner and co-founder of the firm Buchwald, Asper, Henteleff (now Pitblado LLP) along with Harold Buchwald and Yude Henteleff.

In 1970, he wrote &quot;The Benson Iceberg: A Critical Analysis of the White Paper on Tax Reform in Canada&quot;.

Also that year, Asper was elected leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party (defeating university professor John Nesbitt). Asper represented a right-libertarian strain within the party. In the Manitoba election of 1973, he promoted a laissez-faire economy, and advocated the elimination of the welfare state. He also advocated the public financing of election campaigns, to ensure that politics would not be dominated entirely by monied interests. Moreover, as leader of the Manitoba Liberals, he supported the provincial Bill of Rights, and would go on to seek inclusion of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Constitution Act of 1982. His Liberals won only five seats, and Asper was elected in Wolseley by only four votes. He resigned as party leader and MLA in 1975, though he continued to support the Manitoba Liberal Party in later years.

His media empire began with the Winnipeg television station CKND-TV in 1975. Shortly after, in 1977, Asper formed CanWest Global Communications Corporation, which grew to encompass the Global Television Network, among other assets. In 2000, CanWest bought the media holdings of Conrad Black&#x27;s Hollinger Inc. for $3.2 billion, allowing Asper control of the Southam newspaper group, over 60 Canadian newspapers (including the daily &quot;National Post&quot;) as well as several important offshore newspapers and journals.

Asper was noted for his fierce loyalty to Manitoba and western Canada, refusing enticements to move east to Toronto.

He was also a noted philanthropist, making major donations to the areas of culture, arts, and education; to expand on these endeavours, the Asper Foundation was established in 1983 in Winnipeg. In 1997, to focus on his philanthropic career, Asper resigned as CEO of CanWest to become Executive Chairman. In 2001, Asper donated CA$5 million to the St. Boniface Hospital &amp; Research Foundation.

He was a prominent member of Canada&#x27;s Jewish community and a vocal supporter for the State of Israel. Among other positions, he was a member of the Board of Governors of the Jewish Foundation of Manitoba.

Asper was also a close friend of Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin. Controversially, Asper&#x27;s newspaper chain fired &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; publisher Russell Mills after he wrote an article that was critical of Chrétien.

=== Views on Israel ===
As a youth, growing up in Winnipeg, Asper joined the socialist-Zionist youth movement Hashomer Hatzair which supported the creation of a binational state in Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Asper&#x27;s views on Zionism swung to the right and he became a supporter of Jabotinskyism and Irgun leader Menachem Begin and an opponent of Labour Zionism. Asper said of his views &quot;because the Labour Zionists got control of the educational institutions, and of the government, I utterly supported Begin from the time I was 12 or 13. Without him and his guerrilla revolt against the British, there would be no Israel.&quot;

=== Canadian Museum for Human Rights ===
Israel Asper first had the idea to build the Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR) on 18 July 2000. Asper spent the next three years making the CMHR a reality, and had a thorough feasibility study conducted by museum experts from around Canada.

In 2003, Asper established a private charitable organization to build the CMHR, called the Friends of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. On April 17, the 21st anniversary of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, an event was held at The Forks in Winnipeg where Asper first publicly announced his intent to create the CMHR. The announcement included considerable funding commitments from the governments of Canada, Manitoba, and Winnipeg, as well as land donated by the Forks Renewal Corporation. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien committed the first $30 million towards the capital cost, and private fundraising was soon overseen by the Friends of the CMHR.

Later that year, on October 7, on his way to announce the architectural competition in Vancouver for the CMHR’s design, Asper died suddenly at the age of 71. His family, along with the Asper Foundation&#x27;s executive director, vowed to continue to develop the museum. Two weeks later, the groundbreaking ceremony was held at The Forks and the architectural competition announced.

In 2014, a stretch of road in front of the CMHR was named &quot;Israel Asper Way&quot;.

== The Asper Foundation ==

The Asper Foundation is a philanthropic organization in Winnipeg. The Foundation provides general support to Winnipeg&#x27;s Jewish community as well as supporting the broader community, particularly in western Canada, in areas of culture, education, medical research, community development, and human rights.

The Asper Foundation received its heraldic emblem from the Canadian Heraldic Authority in January 2003. As of 2019, the Foundation has $192 million in assets, and is one of Canada’s largest private foundations.

The Foundation was established in 1983 by Israel and Babs Asper, created from the wealth they had generated via CanWest, to build upon theirs and their family’s philanthropic endeavours. In 1997, to focus on this philanthropy, Israel Asper resigned as CEO of CanWest, remaining as Executive Chairman instead.

=== Beneficiaries ===
Some initiatives in Winnipeg supported by the Foundation include the Asper Foundation Human Rights and Holocaust Studies Program, the Asper School of Business at the University of Manitoba, the Asper Jewish Community Campus, the Saint Boniface Hospital Clinical Research Institute, Winnipeg Harvest, the Lyric Theatre in Assiniboine Park, and several programs with the United Way in Winnipeg.

On 22 November 2000, the Foundation donated $10 million each to The Winnipeg Foundation and the Jewish Foundation of Manitoba. In October 2019, the Foundation announced a gift of CA$5-million to the University of Manitoba to establish the &quot;Asper Foundation Entrance Bursary,&quot; a $1,000 entrance bursary program available to students in any faculty or school. In early 2021, the Foundation made a $5 million gift to the Canadian Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI) to expand the &quot;Asper HUJI Innovate&quot; startup accelerator program at the University.

The Asper Foundation also created and sourced the funding for Canada’s 5th national museum, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.

The Foundation&#x27;s projects in Israel include the Centre for Entrepreneurship at HUJI, Community Action Centres and ‘Edible Gardens’ across Israel, a New Media Centre at Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, and Yad Vashem’s International School for Holocaust Studies.

<doc id="336613" wikidata="Q354540" url="?curid=336613" title="Peter Jennings">
<text>Peter Charles Archibald Ewart Jennings (July 29, 1938August 7, 2005) was a Canadian-American television journalist, best known for serving as the sole anchor of &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; from 1983 until his death from lung cancer in 2005. Despite dropping out of high school, Jennings transformed himself into one of American television&#x27;s most prominent journalists.

Jennings started his career early, hosting a Canadian radio show at age 9. He began his professional career with CJOH-TV in Ottawa during its early years, anchoring the local newscasts and hosting the teen dance show &quot;Saturday Date&quot; on Saturdays and then co-anchoring the CTV Television Network&#x27;s national newscast. In 1965, ABC News tapped him to anchor its flagship evening news program. Critics and others in the television news business attacked his inexperience, making his job difficult. He became a foreign correspondent in 1968, reporting from the Middle East.

Jennings returned as one of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; three anchormen in 1978, and he was promoted to sole anchorman in 1983. He was also known for his marathon coverage of breaking news stories, staying on the air for 15 hours or more to anchor the live broadcast of events such as the Gulf War in 1991, the millennium celebrations in 1999–2000, and the September 11 attacks in 2001. In addition to anchoring, he was the host of many ABC News special reports and moderator of several American presidential debates. He was always fascinated with the United States and became an American citizen in 2003.

Along with former television anchors Tom Brokaw of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and Dan Rather of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, Jennings was one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; news anchormen who dominated American evening network news from the early 1980s to the mid-2000s. Jennings&#x27;s death closely followed the retirements from anchoring evening news programs of Brokaw in 2004 and Rather in 2005.

== Early life and education ==
Jennings was born on July 29, 1938, in Toronto, Ontario; he and his younger sister Sarah were children of Elizabeth (née Osborne) and Charles Jennings, a prominent radio broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Jennings started his broadcasting career at the age of nine, hosting &quot;Peter&#x27;s People&quot;, a half-hour, Saturday morning, CBC Radio show for kids. His father was on a business trip to the Middle East when the show debuted; upon returning, Charles Jennings, who harbored a deep dislike of nepotism, was outraged to learn that the network had put his son on the air.

When Jennings was 11 years old, he began attending Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, where he excelled in sports. After the CBC moved his father to its Ottawa headquarters in the early 1950s, Jennings transferred to Lisgar Collegiate Institute. He struggled academically, and Jennings later surmised that it was out of &quot;pure boredom&quot; that he failed 10th grade and dropped out. &quot;I loved girls,&quot; he said. &quot;I loved comic books. And for reasons I don&#x27;t understand, I was pretty lazy.&quot; Jennings then briefly attended Carleton University, where he says he &quot;lasted about 10 minutes&quot; before dropping out. He also attended the University of Ottawa.

==Career==
===Beginnings in Canada===
Although Jennings dreamed of following in his father&#x27;s footsteps in broadcasting, his first job was as a bank teller for the Royal Bank of Canada. He had hoped that the company would assign him to its Havana branch; instead, it located him to the small town of Prescott, Ontario, before transferring him to its nearby Brockville branch. During this time, he explored acting by appearing in several amateur musical productions with the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society, including &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; and &quot;South Pacific&quot;.

While in Brockville, then 21-year-old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting. In 1959, CFJR, a local radio station, hired him as a member of its news department; many of his stories were picked up by the CBC. By 1961, Jennings had joined the staff of CJOH-TV, then a new television station in Ottawa. When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially an interviewer and co-producer for &quot;Vue&quot;, a late-night news program. His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him that resembled that of Dick Clark, and Jennings soon found himself hosting &quot;Club Thirteen&quot;, a dance show similar to &quot;American Bandstand&quot;.

In 1963, CTV, Canada&#x27;s first private TV network and a fledgling competitor of his father&#x27;s network, hired the 24-year-old Jennings as co-anchor of its late-night national newscast, &quot;CTV World News&quot;. While reporting for CTV, he was the first Canadian journalist to arrive in Dallas after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, CTV sent Jennings to cover the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. There, he ran into Elmer Lower, then president of ABC News, who offered him a job as a correspondent for the American network, an opportunity Jennings initially rejected. &quot;The job was pretty intimidating for a guy like me in a tiny city in Canada,&quot; Jennings later recalled. &quot;I thought, What if I screw up? What if I fail?&quot; Three months later though, he changed his mind and moved to the United States.

Though he had moved to ABC, he accepted a freelance assignment narrating the documentary series &quot;The Fabulous Sixties&quot; for CTV in 1969.

===United States&#x27; youngest anchor===

Jennings started reporting for ABC at its New York news bureau. At the time, ABC lagged behind the more established news divisions of NBC and CBS, and the network was trying to attract younger viewers. On February 1, 1965, ABC plucked the fresh-faced Canadian from the field and placed him at the anchor desk of &quot;Peter Jennings With the News&quot;, then a 15-minute nightly newscast. He replaced Ron Cochran, a fellow Canadian. At 26, Jennings was, and remains, the youngest-ever U.S. network news anchor. &quot;ABC was in bad shape at the time,&quot; Jennings said. &quot;They were willing to try anything, and, to demonstrate the point, they tried me.&quot;

An inexperienced Jennings had a hard time keeping up with his rivals at the other networks, and he – and the upstart ABC News – could not compete with the venerable newscasts of Walter Cronkite at CBS and Chet Huntley and David Brinkley at NBC. Some in the American audience disliked Jennings&#x27;s Canadian accent. He pronounced lieutenant as &quot;leftenant&quot;, mangled the pronunciation of &quot;Appomattox&quot;, and misidentified the &quot;Marines&#x27; Hymn&quot; as &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; at Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s presidential inauguration; his lack of in-depth knowledge of American affairs and culture led critics to deride Jennings as a &quot;glamorcaster&quot;. &quot;It was a little ridiculous when you think about it,&quot; he later reflected. &quot;A 26-year-old trying to compete with Cronkite, Huntley and Brinkley. I was simply unqualified.&quot; After three rocky years at the anchor desk, Jennings quit to become a foreign correspondent. Bob Young replaced Jennings on &quot;World News Tonight&quot;.

===Foreign correspondent===
Jennings attempted to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC&#x27;s Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world. The next year, he demonstrated his growing sympathies regarding Middle Eastern affairs with &quot;Palestine: New State of Mind&quot;, a half-hour documentary for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Now&quot; news program. As ABC&#x27;s Beirut bureau chief, Jennings favored the Arab cause in the Arab–Israeli conflict, including the rise of the Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.

In 1972, Jennings covered his first major breaking news story, the Munich Olympics massacre of Israeli athletes by Black September. His live reporting, which drew on the sympathy he had acquired for the Arab world, sought to influence Americans who were critical of the Palestinian group. By hiding with his camera crew close to the athletic compound where the Israeli athletes were being held hostage, Jennings was able to provide ABC with clear video of the masked hostage-takers. He would later be criticized for insisting on using the terms &quot;guerillas&quot; and &quot;commandos&quot; instead of &quot;terrorists&quot; to describe the members of Black September.

After events in Munich, Jennings continued to report on Middle East issues. In 1973, he covered the Yom Kippur War, and the following year, he served as chief correspondent and co-producer of &quot;Sadat: Action Biography&quot;, a profile of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat that would win him his first of two George Foster Peabody Awards. The documentary established Jennings as Sadat&#x27;s favorite correspondent. That year, Jennings married for the second time, to Anouchka Malouf, a Lebanese photographer. His first wife was childhood sweetheart Valerie Godsoe.

Jennings returned to the U.S. at the end of 1974 to become Washington correspondent and news anchor for ABC&#x27;s new morning program &quot;AM America&quot;, a predecessor to &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. ABC was hoping that the show, in which it had invested US$8 million, would challenge NBC&#x27;s highly popular &quot;Today&quot;. &quot;AM America&quot; debuted on January 6, 1975, with Jennings delivering regular newscasts from Washington. The show never gained ground against &quot;Today&quot;, and was canceled in just ten months. In November 1975, Jennings moved abroad, this time as ABC&#x27;s chief foreign correspondent. He continued to cover the Middle East, and in 1978 he was the first North American reporter to interview the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran, then in exile in Paris.

Meanwhile, ABC News and its newly installed president, Roone Arledge, were preparing an overhaul of its nightly news program, which was then known as &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; and whose ratings had languished in third place behind CBS and NBC since its inception. In the late 1970s, a disastrous pairing of Harry Reasoner and Barbara Walters at the anchor desk left the network searching for new ideas. Arledge decided to implement a three-anchor format for the program. On July 10, 1978, &quot;World News Tonight&quot; debuted with Frank Reynolds in Washington, Max Robinson in Chicago, and Jennings in London. Jennings&#x27;s official title was &quot;Foreign Desk Anchor,&quot; although he continued to serve as the network&#x27;s chief foreign correspondent. By mid-1979, the broadcast, which featured some of the same glitzy presentation as Arledge&#x27;s previous television show, &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;, had climbed in the ratings. The newscast had gained 1.9 million households from its debut, and was now in a dead heat with NBC&#x27;s evening newscast.

In 1979, Jennings married for the third time to fellow ABC correspondent Kati Marton. That same year, he became a father when Marton gave birth to their daughter, Elizabeth. In 1982, Jennings&#x27;s and Marton&#x27;s second child, Christopher, was born.

As part of ABC&#x27;s triumvirate, Jennings continued to cover major international news, especially Middle East issues. His nightly appearance at an anchor desk in London convinced some viewers that ABC News was more dedicated to foreign news than the other networks. Jennings reported on the Iranian Revolution and subsequent hostage crisis, the assassination of Sadat, the Falklands War, Israel&#x27;s 1982 conflict with the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon, and Pope John Paul II&#x27;s 1983 visit to Poland. His insistence on covering the major international stories himself irked some of his fellow ABC foreign correspondents, who came to resent being scooped by what they deemed as &quot;Jennings&#x27;s Flying Circus.&quot; Jennings, too, was not completely satisfied with his job in London. When his contract expired with ABC in the early 1980s, Jennings flirted with the possibility of moving back to Canada and working with the CBC on its new nightly newscast, &quot;The Journal&quot;. The CBC could not meet Jennings&#x27;s renegotiation demands, though, and the deal fell through.

===Sole anchor===

In 1983, Reynolds fell ill with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer that often attacks the bones, and was forced to stop anchoring in April. His absence caused a dip in the ratings for ABC&#x27;s nightly newscast. ABC originally expected a full recovery, and relocated Jennings to its Washington bureau to fill in for Reynolds while he was sick; the move helped buoy the newscast&#x27;s ratings, though it remained in third place. On July 20, 1983, Reynolds died unexpectedly after developing acute hepatitis.

On August 9, 1983, ABC announced that Jennings had signed a four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for &quot;World News Tonight&quot; on September 5. Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program&#x27;s new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, and the beginning of what the media would deem the &quot;Big Three&quot; era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. &quot;With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#x27;s an inevitable byproduct of television. But if that is what it comes down to in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, then we will all have made a mistake.&quot;

Jennings&#x27;s debut on September 5, 1983, marked the beginning of a steady climb in the ratings for ABC News. He spent his first year at the anchor desk educating himself on American domestic affairs in preparation for the 1984 presidential campaign season. In June 1984, Jennings, who later admitted that his political knowledge was limited at the time, co-anchored ABC&#x27;s coverage of the Democratic National Convention with David Brinkley. &quot;I had not covered an election campaign in 16 years,&quot; Jennings said, &quot;so here was I going to co-anchor with David Brinkley in 1984, and he wasn&#x27;t even sure I knew who the faces belonged to, and he was right.&quot; Jennings and ABC were criticized for suddenly halting coverage of the convention for 30 minutes and airing a rerun of &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; instead.

Despite a shaky start at the anchor desk, Jennings&#x27;s broadcast began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC&#x27;s coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC&#x27;s evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.

Jennings&#x27;s on-air success continued in 1990, and &quot;World News Tonight&quot; consistently led the ratings race. In January, he anchored the first installment of &quot;Peter Jennings Reporting&quot;—hour-long, prime-time ABC News specials dedicated to exploring a single topic. His inaugural program on gun violence in America drew praise. His second installment of &quot;Peter Jennings Reporting&quot; in April, &quot;From the Killing Fields&quot;, focused on U.S. policy towards Cambodia. The program alleged that the federal government was covertly supporting the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s return to power in the Asian nation, a charge that the Bush administration initially denied. On July 18, the White House announced that it was ending recognition of the Khmer Rouge.

When the Gulf War started on January 17, 1991, Jennings began a marathon anchoring stint to cover the story, spending 20 of the first 48 hours of the war on-air, and leading ABC News to its highest-ever ratings. After interrupting regular Saturday morning cartoons on January 19 to broadcast a military briefing from Saudi Arabia, Jennings and ABC became concerned about the emotional impact of the war coverage on children. Out of that concern, Jennings hosted a 90-minute special, &quot;War in the Gulf: Answering Children&#x27;s Questions&quot; the next Saturday morning; the program featured Jennings, ABC correspondents, and American military personnel answering phoned-in questions and explaining the war to young viewers.

On October 12, 1991, breaking news forced ABC News to interrupt regular Saturday morning programming again. Jennings was once again mindful of his audience, prefacing the coverage of the Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas with remarks for children. &quot;You may hear some not very nice language,&quot; said Jennings. He noted that Thomas and his accuser, Anita Hill, &quot;have a very painful disagreement about some things the woman says the man did to her when they were working together. ... You can ask your parents to tell you more.&quot; Jennings continued to produce special programs aimed at young viewers, anchoring &quot;Growing Up in the Age of AIDS&quot;, a frank, 90-minute-long discussion on AIDS in February 1992; and &quot;Prejudice: Answering Children&#x27;s Questions&quot;, a forum on racism in April 1992.

Politics dominated network news in 1992. Jennings moderated the final debate among the Democratic presidential candidates in March, and anchored &quot;Peter Jennings Reporting: Who Is Ross Perot?&quot; and a subsequent 90-minute town forum with Perot and a studio audience in June. On September 9, 1992, ABC announced that it would be switching the format of its political coverage to give less recognition to staged sound bites. &quot;We&#x27;re aware that a lot of you are turned off by the political process and that many of you put at least some of the blame on us,&quot; Jennings told viewers on &quot;World News Tonight&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;ll only devote time to a candidate&#x27;s daily routine if it is more than routine. There will be less attention to staged appearances and sound bites designed exclusively for television.&quot; After Bill Clinton was elected president in November 1992, Jennings featured the new administration in two of his specials for children; he anchored &quot;President Clinton: Answering Children&#x27;s Questions&quot; in February 1993; and &quot;Kids in the Crossfire: Violence in America&quot; in November 1993, a live special from a Washington, DC, junior high school which featured Attorney General Janet Reno and rapper MC Lyte.

The early 1990s also served up a series of difficult experiences and public embarrassment for Jennings. On August 13, 1993, Jennings and Kati Marton publicly announced their separation in &quot;Newsday&quot;. The couple had previously split in 1987 for four months after Jennings found out that Marton was having an affair with &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Richard Cohen. In January 1994, he locked horns with his executive producer on &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, Emily Rooney. The public firing of Rooney made national headlines, and put Jennings on the defensive.

Despite winning a Peabody Award, &quot;Peter Jennings Reporting: Hiroshima: Why the Bomb Was Dropped&quot;, which aired on July 27, 1995, a week before the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, drew scorn. Reviewing the show for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Ken Ringle called it &quot;an ingenue&#x27;s stroll down the narrow tunnels of academic revisionism&quot; that &quot;purports to discover a post-World War II coverup -- a smoke screen designed to refute any suggestion that the Hiroshima bombing was anything but a military necessity.&quot; Some viewers of the documentary mailed bus fares to Jennings, telling him to return to Canada.

Jennings pleased some conservatives though, after his three-year lobbying effort to create a full-time religion correspondent at ABC News succeeded in the hiring of Peggy Wehmeyer in January 1994, making her the first such network reporter. ABC increased its coverage of religious topics, and in March 1995, Jennings anchored &quot;Peter Jennings Reporting: In the Name of God&quot;, a well-received documentary on the changing nature of American churches. At a taping of a &quot;town meeting&quot; segment for KOMO-TV of Seattle in February 1995, Jennings expressed regret for his ABC radio remarks on the 1994 midterm elections. &quot;People thought I had insulted their sacred mandate and some thought I should go back to Canada,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope I don&#x27;t make that mistake again.&quot;

During the mid-1990s, some television critics praised Jennings for his insistence on not letting the O. J. Simpson murder case swamp the newscast. Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the Bosnian War, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials on the subject and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children. ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University, in large part for his passion for the story. Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the U.S. of another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum. Some members of the Canadian press in particular raved about his in-depth coverage of the issue, and he was the only anchor to broadcast from Canada on the eve of the referendum.

Despite these critical successes, in 1996, &quot;World News Tonight&quot; started gradually slipping in the ratings race. Bolstered by strong viewership of its coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games and heavy coverage of O.J. Simpson&#x27;s trial, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Nightly News&quot; overtook the ABC newscast for two weeks in late July and early September. This short bump provided momentum for NBC, which started making steady gains in the ratings. Worried, Jennings and ABC decided to cut back on international reporting and give more air time to &quot;soft stories&quot;, in an effort to emulate the success of &quot;Nightly News&quot;. The changes provoked a backlash from regular viewers, and ratings plummeted. &quot;We did very badly with it,&quot; Jennings said. &quot;The audience kicked us in the teeth.&quot; Although changes were made to &quot;World News Tonight&quot; to restore its commitment to major issues and stop the hemorrhaging, &quot;Nightly News&quot; ended 1997 as the number-one evening newscast.

The slide in the ratings coincided with some rockiness at ABC News. The company scrapped plans to develop a cable news channel. On May 29, 1998, David Westin succeeded Roone Arledge as president of ABC News. Both denied that the disappointing ratings performance of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; contributed to the decision. A 24-hour strike by the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians disrupted ABC&#x27;s coverage of 1998&#x27;s November elections after talks between the union and ABC broke down. Several Democratic candidates denied interviews to support the union.

None of the shake-ups helped Jennings retake the nightly ratings crown, but &quot;World News Tonight&quot; still offered stiff competition at second place. As the millennium approached, Jennings and the network started preparing for extensive retrospectives of the 20th century. The anchor teamed with former &quot;Life&quot; magazine journalist Todd Brewster to pen &quot;The Century&quot;, a 606-page book on 20th-century America. Designed as a companion book for ABC&#x27;s upcoming documentary series of the same name, the book topped &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in December 1998, a month after it debuted. On March 29, 1999, Jennings anchored the first installment of ABC&#x27;s 12-hour miniseries, &quot;The Century&quot;; production on the monumental project started in 1990, and by the time it aired, it had cost the network US$25 million. Jennings also anchored a longer, 15-hour version, &quot;The Century: America&#x27;s Time&quot;, on the History Channel in April 1999.

On December 31, 1999, Jennings was on the air for 23 straight hours to anchor &quot;ABC 2000 Today&quot;, ABC&#x27;s massive millennium eve special. An estimated 175 million people tuned into at least a portion of the program. Jennings&#x27;s American prime-time audience, an estimated 18.6 million viewers, easily outpaced the millennium coverage of rival networks. Television critics praised the program, and described the anchor as &quot;superhuman&quot;. Although production costs totaled a hefty $11 million (compared with $2 million each for NBC&#x27;s and CBS&#x27;s millennium projects), ABC managed to make a profit of $5 million. The success of the program, though, failed to transfer into any lasting change in the viewership of &quot;World News Tonight&quot;; ABC&#x27;s evening newscast spent the first week of January as ratings leader, before dropping back to second place.

With another presidential election taking place in 2000, Jennings had some more political reporting duties that year. On January 5, Jennings moderated the Democratic primary debate, held at the University of New Hampshire. He hosted the primetime news special &quot;The Dark Horizon: India, Pakistan, and the Bomb&quot;, which ABC broadcast on March 22, as then-President Clinton began his trip to the region. Jennings was the only American news anchor to travel to India for Clinton&#x27;s trip. Paul A. Slavin became the new executive producer for &quot;World News Tonight&quot; in April.

====September 11====
Jennings anchored ABC&#x27;s coverage of the September 11 attacks for 17 straight hours, an effort described as &quot;Herculean&quot; by television critics. Like other network news anchors, he was widely praised for guiding Americans through the disaster. When the South tower collapsed, Jennings at first did not understand what was happening, saying &quot;We now have a—what do we have?&quot; ABC Correspondent John Miller thought it might be &quot;A new large plume of smoke.&quot; Jennings then went to Correspondent on the ground Don Dahler to ask what was happening Dahler replied, &quot;The second building that was hit by the plane has just completely collapsed. The entire building has just collapsed...it folded in on itself and it&#x27;s not there anymore.&quot; Jennings still did not understand asking &quot;The whole side has collapsed?&quot; Dahler repeated &quot;The whole &quot;building&quot; has collapsed&quot;. Jennings asked once more to confirm, and Dahler repeated &quot;The building has collapsed.&quot; Jennings then said &quot;We are talking about massive casualties here at the moment and we have—that is extraordinary.&quot; When the North Tower collapsed Jennings simply and quietly said &quot;Oh my God.&quot; after a pause he said &quot;It&#x27;s hard to put into words, and perhaps one doesn&#x27;t need to. Both Trade Towers, where thousands of people work, on this day, Tuesday, have now been attacked and destroyed with thousands of people either in them or in the immediate area adjacent to them.&quot; At one point, Jennings broke his composure after receiving phone calls from his children. &quot;We do not very often make recommendations for people&#x27;s behavior from this chair,&quot; he said, &quot;but...if you&#x27;re a parent, you&#x27;ve got a kid in some other part of the country, call them up. Exchange observations.&quot;

His coverage was not without controversy. Jennings was criticized by Rush Limbaugh among others for commenting about President George W. Bush on-air: &quot;Where is the president of the United States? ... I know we don&#x27;t know where he is, but pretty soon the country needs to know where he is.&quot; ABC was flooded with more than 10,000 angry phone calls and e-mails. On September 13, Jennings received more criticism — this time for hosting a forum for Middle East experts that included Palestinian Authority negotiator Hanan Ashrawi. In mid-2002, Jennings and ABC refused to allow Toby Keith to open their coverage of July 4 celebrations with &quot;Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)&quot;, prompting criticism from Keith and country music fans, who highlighted Jennings&#x27;s Canadian citizenship.

The events of September 11 added new meaning to &quot;In Search of America&quot;, the project Jennings and Brewster started after the success of their previous collaboration. The two began writing the book in early 2001; after the terrorist attacks, they revisited many of the people they had interviewed to see how the events had affected them. To promote the book, the anchor and &quot;World News Tonight&quot; started a 50-state tour of the United States in April 2002 as part of a yearlong project, &quot;50 States/One Nation/One Year&quot;. Jennings also anchored a six-part television series in September 2002, which featured the same name as the book. Despite the success of the TV series and heavy promotion by the book&#x27;s publisher, &quot;In Search of America&quot; failed to generate much interest or sales.

Jennings&#x27;s work on &quot;In Search of America&quot; and the September 11 attacks contributed to his decision in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. &quot;I think that 9/11 and the subsequent travel I did in the country afterwards made me feel connected in new ways,&quot; he said. &quot;And when we were working on the America project I spent a lot of time on the road, which meant away from my editor&#x27;s desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers&#x27; dreams and ideas for the future.&quot; His work had prepared him well for the citizenship test, which he passed easily. &quot;Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?&quot; he asked. &quot;It would have been horrendous.&quot; The anchor&#x27;s formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. &quot;I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. And I cried a little bit — my kids didn&#x27;t cry, but I cried a bit — but I&#x27;m a fairly emotional character anyway.&quot;

===Leaving the chair===

As he did in 2000, Jennings moderated the 2004 Democratic presidential primary debate, which was held that year at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. He was noted for questioning General Wesley Clark over Clark&#x27;s silence over controversial comments made by filmmaker Michael Moore, a supporter of Clark. Moore called then-President George W. Bush a &quot;deserter&quot;.

By late 2004, Brokaw had retired from his anchoring duties at NBC, ceding the reins to Brian Williams; Rather planned to step down in March 2005. Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz touting the anchor&#x27;s foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported from the scene of any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from the ABC News Headquarters in New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.

In late March, viewers started noticing that Jennings&#x27;s voice sounded uncharacteristically gravelly and unhealthy during evening newscasts. On April 1, 2005, he anchored &quot;World News Tonight&quot; for the last time; his failing health also prevented him from covering the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II. On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message on &quot;World News Tonight&quot; that he had been diagnosed with a final stage of lung cancer, and was starting chemotherapy treatment the following week. Although he stated his intention to continue anchoring whenever possible, the message was to be his last appearance on television.

Throughout the summer, Charles Gibson, co-host of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and Elizabeth Vargas, co-host of &quot;20/20&quot;, served as temporary anchors. On April 29, 2005, Jennings posted a letter on ABCNews.com with an update of his status and expressing thanks to those who had offered him their good wishes and prayers. In June, Jennings visited the ABC News headquarters, and addressed staff members in an emotional scene in the &quot;World News Tonight&quot; newsroom; he thanked Gibson for closing each broadcast with the phrase, &quot;for Peter Jennings and all of us at ABC News.&quot; During his visit, however, his colleagues noticed he was ill to the point where he could barely speak. He posted another short letter of thanks on July 29, 2005, his 67th birthday.

===Death===
Jennings died of lung cancer in his New York apartment on August 7, 2005, at the age of 67. His fourth wife, two children, and sister were at his side.

Just after 11:30 pm EDT that evening, Charles Gibson broke into local news in the eastern U.S. and regular programming on ABC&#x27;s western affiliates to announce Jennings&#x27;s death. The anchor&#x27;s ABC colleagues, including Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, and Ted Koppel, shared their thoughts on Jennings&#x27;s death. The next morning, Brokaw and Rather fondly remembered their former rival on the morning news shows. &quot;Peter, of the three of us, was our prince,&quot; said Brokaw on &quot;Today&quot;. &quot;He seemed so timeless. He had such élan and style.&quot; Canada&#x27;s television networks led off their morning news shows with the news of Jennings&#x27;s death and had remembrances from their &quot;big three&quot; anchors, Peter Mansbridge at the CBC, Lloyd Robertson at CTV, and Kevin Newman (himself a former colleague of Jennings at ABC) at Global.

American President George W. Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin offered statements of condolence to the press.

On August 10, 2005, ABC aired a two-hour special, &quot;Peter Jennings: Reporter&quot;, with archival clips of his reports and interviews with colleagues and friends. The special drew more than nine million viewers, and was the most watched television program of the night. For the week of his death, &quot;World News Tonight&quot; placed number one in the ratings race for the first time since June 2004.

Jennings&#x27;s widow, Kayce Freed, and family held a private service in New York. Jennings&#x27;s body was cremated and his ashes split in half. Half of his ashes remained in his home on Long Island and the other half was placed in his summer home in the Gatineau Hills, near Ottawa. The 57th Primetime Emmy Awards on September 18, 2005, included a tribute to Jennings by Brokaw and Rather. A public memorial service for Jennings was held two days later at Carnegie Hall. Notable journalists, political leaders, and other friends of Jennings attended. Jennings left a US$50 million estate: half went to Freed, and most of the rest to his son and daughter. On December 5, 2005, after much speculation, and nearly eight months after Jennings stopped anchoring, ABC named Vargas and Bob Woodruff co-anchors for &quot;World News Tonight&quot;.

In 2007, a book, &quot;Peter Jennings: A Reporter&#x27;s Life&quot;, was published, co-edited by his widow Kayce Freed and his ABC colleague Lynn Sherr. The book contained an oral history compiled from a number of interviews. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described the book as &quot;predictably positive&quot; and &quot;reminding readers of the commanding presence Jennings held over broadcast journalism&quot;. &quot;Parksville Qualicum News&quot; described it as &quot;browse-able&quot; but with &quot;a few holes left&quot;.

==Honors==

Jennings won numerous honors throughout his career, including 16 Emmys and two George Foster Peabody Awards. His work on &quot;World News Tonight&quot; and &quot;Peter Jennings Reporting&quot; consistently won Overseas Press Club and duPont-Columbia awards. At the peak of his popularity, Jennings was named &quot;Best Anchor&quot; by the &quot;Washington Journalism Review&quot; in 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992. The Radio and Television News Directors Association awarded Jennings its highest honor, the Paul White Award in 1995, in recognition of his lifetime contributions to journalism. In 2004, he was awarded with the Edward R. Murrow Award for Lifetime Achievement in Broadcasting from Washington State University.

Just eight days before his death, Jennings was informed that he would be inducted into the Order of Canada, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor. His daughter, Elizabeth, accepted the insignia on his behalf in October 2005. On February 21, 2006, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg designated the block on West 66th Street between Columbus Avenue and Central Park West as &quot;Peter Jennings Way&quot; in honor of the late anchor; the block is home to the ABC News headquarters. In October 2006, The Walt Disney Company, which bought ABC in 1996, posthumously named Jennings a Disney Legend, the company&#x27;s highest honor. He was the first ABC News employee so honored. In January 2011, Jennings was posthumously inducted into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences&#x27; Television Hall of Fame.

==Notes==

a.Jennings&#x27;s debut program led with coverage of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. It also featured stories on the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, violent clashes in Lebanon, labor unions, and tennis&#x27;s U.S. Open.

b.Jennings&#x27;s performance during the 1984 presidential campaign was analyzed in a 1986 study led by Syracuse University professor Brian Mullen. He concluded that Jennings &quot;exhibited a facial expression bias in favor of Reagan&quot;. Mullen&#x27;s team repeated the study to analyze Jennings&#x27;s performance in the 1988 presidential election, concluding that the ABC anchor again favored a Republican candidate. Television critic Tom Shales also noticed a pro-Reagan bias in Jennings&#x27;s reporting, referring to ABC as &quot;a news organization that is already considered the White House favorite&quot; in May 1985.

c.ABC News &quot;had its highest evening newscast rating ever the first week in the war, and two nights of its prime-time coverage were among the 10 most-watched shows on television&quot;.

d.In 1994, the three major networks devoted 1,592 total minutes to covering the Simpson criminal case; while ABC had 423, CBS had 580 and NBC 589. The Simpson trial was the number-one news story for NBC and CBS in 1995, while at ABC, coverage of the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina dominated the newscast. Jennings stated in a 1996 interview that he was satisfied that ABC came in third in terms of O.J. coverage. &quot;I&#x27;m very pleased that it didn&#x27;t crowd out as much of the rest of the world on &quot;World News Tonight&quot; as it did on other broadcasts,&quot; he said. &quot;I am very pleased it was not our major story of last year as it was at other networks.&quot;

e.The immense scope of &quot;The Century&quot; caused headaches for those developing it. It survived three major changes in narrative approach, three different executive producers, and various attempts to axe the entire project. By the time it aired, all of the people interviewed for their anecdotes of World War I had died. Jennings, though, downplayed criticism of the program&#x27;s rocky history. &quot;Name me a news organization that doesn&#x27;t have some degree of turmoil on a major project,&quot; he said. &quot;What people care about in &quot;The New York Times&quot; is what gets in the paper. It&#x27;s the same with us. There are people out there who think their job is to set the bar for us, but the bar for me is set by the audience, and I think there is a real hunger out there from everyone I encounter to relive and experience and learn from what&#x27;s gone on over the last 100 years.&quot;

<text>Coptology is the scientific study of the Coptic people.

==Origin==
The European interest in Coptology may have started as early as the 15th century AD. The term was used in 1976 when the First International Congress of Coptology was held in Cairo under the title &quot;Colloquium on the Future of Coptic Studies&quot; (11-17 December). This was followed by the establishment of the &quot;International Association for Coptic Studies&quot;. One of the founders of the Colloquium and the Association was Pahor Labib, director of the Coptic Museum in Cairo during 1951-65. The words &#x27;Coptology&#x27; and &#x27;Coptologist&#x27; were introduced into the English language by Aziz Suryal Atiya.

==Worldwide institutions==
There are now institutions that give more or less regular courses of Coptology in 47 countries around the world, including Australia, Great Britain, Canada, Germany, Israel, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. A rotating chair of Coptic studies was opened at the American University in Cairo in 2002.

<doc id="336629" wikidata="Q3371061" url="?curid=336629" title="Paul Desmarais">
<text>Paul Desmarais Sr. (January 4, 1927 – October 8, 2013) was a Canadian financier and philanthropist, based in Montreal. With an estimated family net worth of US$4.5 billion (as of March 2012), Desmarais was ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the fourth wealthiest person in Canada and 235th in the world in 2013. He was chairman and chief executive officer of Power Corporation of Canada until 1996 when he passed the reins of management of Power Corporation to his sons, Paul Jr. and André. He then continued to serve as a director and as chairman of the executive committee of the board, and remained the controlling shareholder. Power Corporation of Canada is a diversified international management and holding company with interests in companies in the financial services, asset management, sustainable and renewable energy, and other business sectors.

Desmarais was highly regarded for his standard of integrity and his commitment to a united and prosperous Canada.

==Personal life==

Desmarais was born in Sudbury, Ontario, to lawyer Jean-Noël Desmarais (3 May 1897 – 1983) and Lébéa Laforest (2 September 1899 – 1984). The Desmarais family is originally from Quebec and descended from Paul Desmarais who moved to Canada from Saint-Sauveur-sur-École, Île-de-France in late 1600s.

Desmarais&#x27; grandfather Noël Desmarais 1873–1964 (wife: Roseanna 1874–1964) founded the town of Noëlville, Ontario, now part of the municipality of French River.

Two of his brothers, Louis Desmarais and Jean Noël Desmarais, were involved in federal politics.

Desmarais was married to Jacqueline Maranger, also from Sudbury. They had two sons: Paul Jr. and André (who is married to former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien&#x27;s daughter France) and two daughters, Louise and Sophie.

The Desmarais family has a large family estate in Sagard, Quebec, Canada, between the villages of Saint-Siméon and Petit-Saguenay: Domaine Laforest. The area of the estate is over 75 square kilometers. The Desmarais family also owned secondary homes in Palm Beach, Florida and New York at the time of his death.

==Philanthropy==
Desmarais was a philanthropist, making substantial contributions (many anonymously) to the arts, education, health and the homeless.

At the time of M. Desmarais&#x27; death, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement that Desmarais was “one of Canada’s most successful businessmen” and will be remembered for his leadership, his philanthropy and community involvement as well as his “profound attachment to his country.” Many institutions, which benefited from Desmarais&#x27; contributions also paid tribute to the business man. These include McGill University “He was someone who felt an obligation to contribute to our broader society in many different ways and we were all the richer for that.”

Today, many pavilions are named in his honour, including the Jean-Noël Desmarais Pavilion at The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and the Paul-G.-Desmarais Pavilion at the Université de Montréal.

==Career==
After graduating from the University of Ottawa, Desmarais went to Osgoode Law School until he began working for Sudbury Bus Lines Limited, the restructured bus company formed from the remnants of the Sudbury and Copper Cliff Suburban Electric Railway his grandfather had founded. The company was sold to him for a symbolic 1 CAD, because it was almost insolvent. He rescued the company and acquired additional bus lines in the Ottawa area and Quebec City (including Quebec Autobus, Provincial Transport and Regional Transport). By 1968 the holding company which Desmarais had acquired three years earlier, Trans-Canada Corporation Fund (TCCF), owned the bus line Provincial Transport, an interest in Toronto-based Imperial Life Assurance and Gesca Ltée, (which had an interest in the Montreal paper La Presse). That year TCCF made a share-exchange offer with Power Corporation of Canada, headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, whereby Paul Desmarais became chairman and chief executive officer and controlling shareholder.

He founded the Canada China Business Council in 1978.

==Power Corporation of Canada==
Taking advantage of the substantial investment of Power Corporation of Canada, Desmarais took control of a large pulp and paper company, Consolidated Bathurst (built since in Stone-Consolidated, then merged with Abitibi-Price Inc. to form Abitibi-Consolidated, then Abitibi-Bowater and Resolute). At the same time, under the leadership of Desmarais, Power Corporation of Canada continued to acquire control positions in Great-West Life and Investors Group which formed the basis of Power Financial Corporation which was founded in 1984. Acquiring Trans-Canada Corporation Fund, Desmarais obtained the newspaper &quot;La Presse&quot; in 1968, which enabled him to gain experience in the field of print media in Canada. Then he looked for companies in Europe and he met the Belgian financier Albert Frère to the board of directors of Paribas. The two men discovered an alter ego, applying the same financial techniques: a friendly investment in substantial firms, some of which were experiencing financial hardship. Desmarais owned about 15% of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, a Belgian holding company, which in 2001 acquired a 25% interest in the German media company Bertelsmann, whose subsidiaries include BMG and Random House (the German company Bertelsmann bought the 25% back in July 2006). Groupe Bruxelles Lambert currently holds positions in global industrial and services companies based in Europe including: Imerys, LafargeHolcim, adidas, SGS, Pernod Ricard, Umicore, Ontex, GEA and Parques.

==Politics==
The Desmarais family enjoys connections to politicians worldwide. Critics charge that the family&#x27;s political connections provide it with unfair advantages in business.

According to a profile in &quot;The Australian&quot;, &quot;Desmarais grew to command the intersection of Canadian business and politics through close relations with four prime ministers.&quot; Desmarais was an advisor to Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Brian Mulroney worked as a labour lawyer for Desmarais before entering politics, and Desmarais named his then-employee Paul Martin as president of Canada Steamship Lines Inc. (Power Corp.&#x27;s Great Lakes shipping subsidiary) in 1974 (Desmarais sold the company to Martin in 1981.) Prime Minister Jean Chrétien was related to Desmarais by marriage; Chretien&#x27;s daughter France is married to Desmarais&#x27; son André. Both Mulroney and Trudeau served on advisory boards for Power Corp. after leaving office.

According to &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, Paul Desmarais Sr. was a close associate of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. Paul Desmarais Sr. and Sarkozy were together at the party at Fouquet&#x27;s to celebrate the election of the new president on May 6, 2007. In 2004, Nicolas Sarkozy was a guest at his estate in Sagard, in Charlevoix, a good distance from the Saint Lawrence. &quot;«Quand tu entres dans la propriété, on t&#x27;ouvre un premier portail. Ensuite, tu dois faire des kilomètres et des kilomètres avant d&#x27;arriver au château...»&quot; (&quot;When you enter the property, they open the first gate. Then you have to go kilometers and kilometers before arriving at the chateau...&quot;) Nicolas Sarkozy told about the fortitude of his friend Desmarais. Sophie Desmarais&#x27; ex-husband, Eric Le Moyne de Sérigny, is also close to Nicolas Sarkozy, heads numerous companies, and was a member of the board of directors of Imerys.

Desmarais was an opponent of the Quebec sovereignty movement. On February 2, 2009, French President Nicolas Sarkozy made comments asking Quebec sovereigntists to focus on unity and not separation from Canada, and to put their goals of sovereignty on hold during tough economic times. This angered many sovereigntists who claimed that Sarkozy was acting under the influence of Desmarais.

==Death==
Desmarais&#x27; funeral was a private event. A public memorial was held on December 3, 2013 at Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal. Many politicians, dignitaries and members of the business and cultural communities were present, including: Laurent Beaudoin, Robert Charlebois, Jean Chrétien, Bill Davis, Denis Coderre, Stephen Harper, Pauline Marois, Brian Mulroney, Bob Rae and Nicolas Sarkozy. Many testimonials were shared around the time of his death and the ceremony:

- George H. W. Bush: “Paul was that rarest of men, who possess not only the drive, the integrity and the vision to succeed spectacularly in business, but also a tremendous capacity for friendship. He was what I would call a true point of light, helping and usually leading many worthwhile causes. So, yes, I liked and I respected this good man immensely. At age 89 and a half, I recognize more than ever the importance and the blessings of friendship.”

- Bernard Landry: “We were totally opposed on many matters — the national fate of Quebec of course, the management of modern capitalism. But for many other things, internationalism, culture, we were on the same floor. And that’s why we remained friends.”

<text>Cetacean intelligence is the overall intelligence and derived cognitive ability of aquatic mammals belonging in the infraorder Cetacea (cetaceans), including baleen whales, porpoises, and dolphins. In 2014, a study found that the long-finned pilot whale has more neocortical neurons than any other mammal, including humans, examined to date.

==Brain==
===Size===
Brain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. However, many other factors also affect intelligence, and recent discoveries concerning bird intelligence have called into question the influence of brain size. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that in general, mammalian brain size scales at approximately the or exponent of body mass. Comparison of actual brain size with the size expected from allometry provides an encephalization quotient (EQ) that can be used as a more accurate indicator of an animal&#x27;s intelligence.
* Sperm whales (&quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;) have the largest known brain mass of any extant animal, averaging 7.8 kg in mature males.
* Orcas (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) have the second largest known brain mass of any extant animal. (5.4-6.8 kg).
* Bottlenose dolphins (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;) have an absolute brain mass of 1,500–1,700 grams. This is slightly greater than that of humans (1,300–1,400 grams) and about four times that of chimpanzees (400 grams).
* The brain to body mass ratio (not the encephalization quotient) in some members of the odontocete superfamily Delphinoidea (dolphins, porpoises, belugas, and narwhals) is greater than modern humans, and greater than all other mammals (there is debate whether that of the treeshrew might be second in place of humans). In some dolphins, it is less than half that of humans: 0.9% versus 2.1%. However, this comparison is complicated by the large amount of insulating blubber Delphinoidea brains have (15-20% of mass).
* The encephalization quotient (EQ) varies widely between species. The northern right whale dolphin has an EQ of approximately 5.55; the common bottlenose dolphin of 5.26; the tucuxi dolphin of 4.56; the orca of 2.57; the pygmy sperm whales of 1.78; the narwhals of 1.76; the La Plata dolphin of 1.67; the Ganges river dolphin of 1.55; the sperm whales of 0.58; the dwarf sperm whale of 1.63; the beluga whales of 2.24; the false killer whale of 4.03; the amazon river dolphin of 2.51; the cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale of 0.92; the harbour porpoise of 2.95; the dall&#x27;s porpoise of 3.54; and the blue whales of 0.19. In comparison to other animals, elephants have an EQ ranging from 1.13 to 2.36; chimpanzees of approximately 2.49; dogs of 1.17; cats of 1.00; and mice of 0.50. Sperm whale, Blue whale, and Humpback whale (EQ .18) are not thought to be exceptionally unintelligent, although they have very low EQs.
* The majority of mammals are born with a brain close to 90% of the adult brain weight. Humans are born with 28% of the adult brain weight, chimpanzees with 54%, bottlenose dolphins with 42.5%, and elephants with 35%.

Spindle cells (neurons without extensive branching) have been discovered in the brains of the humpback whale, fin whale, sperm whale, orca, bottlenose dolphins, Risso&#x27;s dolphins, and beluga whales. Humans, great apes, and elephants, species all well known for their high intelligence, are the only others known to have spindle cells. Spindle neurons appear to play a central role in the development of intelligent behavior. Such a discovery may suggest a convergent evolution of these species.

===Structure===

Elephant brains also show a complexity similar to dolphin brains, and are also more convoluted than that of humans, and with a cortex thicker than that of cetaceans. It is generally agreed that the growth of the neocortex, both absolutely and relative to the rest of the brain, during human evolution, has been responsible for the evolution of human intelligence, however defined. While a complex neocortex usually indicates high intelligence, there are exceptions. For example, the echidna has a highly developed brain, yet is not widely considered very intelligent, though preliminary investigations into their intelligence suggest that echidnas are capable of more advanced cognitive tasks than were previously assumed.

In 2014, it was shown for the first time that a species of dolphin, the long-finned pilot whale, has more neocortical neurons than any mammal studied to date including humans.
Unlike terrestrial mammals, dolphin brains contain a paralimbic lobe, which may possibly be used for sensory processing. It has also been suggested that similar to humans, the paralimbic region of the brain is responsible for a dolphin&#x27;s self-control, motivation, and emotions. The dolphin is a voluntary breather, even during sleep, with the result that veterinary anaesthesia of dolphins would result in asphyxiation. Ridgway reports that EEGs show alternating hemispheric asymmetry in slow waves during sleep, with occasional sleep-like waves from both hemispheres. This result has been interpreted to mean that dolphins sleep only one hemisphere of their brain at a time, possibly to control their voluntary respiration system or to be vigilant for predators.

The dolphin&#x27;s greater dependence on sound processing is evident in the structure of its brain: its neural area devoted to visual imaging is only about one-tenth that of the human brain, while the area devoted to acoustical imaging is about 10 times as large. Sensory experiments suggest a great degree of cross-modal integration in the processing of shapes between echolocative and visual areas of the brain.

==Brain evolution==
The evolution of encephalization in cetaceans is similar to that in primates. Though the general trend in their evolutionary history increased brain mass, body mass, and encephalization quotient, a few lineages actually underwent decephalization, although the selective pressures that caused this are still under debate. Among cetaceans, Odontoceti tend to have higher encephalization quotients than Mysticeti, which is at least partially due to the fact that Mysticeti have much larger body masses without a compensating increase in brain mass. As far as which selective pressures drove the encephalization (or decephalization) of cetacean brains, current research espouses a few main theories. The most promising suggests that cetacean brain size and complexity increased to support complex social relations. It could also have been driven by changes in diet, the emergence of echolocation, or an increase in territorial range.

==Problem-solving ability==
Some research shows that dolphins, among other animals, understand concepts such as numerical continuity, though not necessarily counting. Dolphins may be able to discriminate between numbers.

Several researchers observing animals&#x27; ability to learn set formation tend to rank dolphins at about the level of elephants in intelligence, and show that dolphins do not surpass other highly intelligent animals in problem solving. A 1982 survey of other studies showed that in the learning of &quot;set formation&quot;, dolphins rank highly, but not as high as some other animals.

==Behavior==
===Pod characteristics===

Dolphin group sizes vary quite dramatically. River dolphins usually congregate in fairly small groups from 6 to 12 in number or, in some species, singly or in pairs. The individuals in these small groups know and recognize one another. Other species such as the oceanic pantropical spotted dolphin, common dolphin and spinner dolphin travel in large groups of hundreds of individuals. It is unknown whether every member of the group is acquainted with every other. However, large packs can act as a single cohesive unitobservations show that if an unexpected disturbance, such as a shark approach, occurs from the flank or from beneath the group, the group moves in near-unison to avoid the threat. This means that the dolphins must be aware not only of their near neighbors but also of other individuals nearby in a similar manner to which humans perform &quot;audience waves&quot;. This is achieved by sight, and possibly also echolocation. One hypothesis proposed by Jerison (1986) is that members of a pod of dolphins are able to share echolocation results with each other to create a better understanding of their surroundings.

Southern resident orcas in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington, United States, live in extended family groups. The basis of the southern resident orca social structure is the matriline, consisting of a matriarch and her descendants of all generations. A number of matrilines form a southern resident orca pod, which is ongoing and extremely stable in membership, and has its own dialect which is stable over time. A southern resident calf is born into the pod of their mother and remains in it for life.

A cetacean dialect is a socially–determined vocal tradition. The complex vocal communication systems of orcas correspond with their large brains and complex social structure. The three southern resident orca pods share some calls with one another, and also have unique calls. Discussing the function of resident orca dialects, researchers John Ford, Graeme Ellis and Ken Balcomb wrote, &quot;It may well be that dialects are used by the whales as acoustic indicators of group identity and membership, which might serve to preserve the integrity and cohesiveness of the social unit.&quot; Resident orcas form closed societies with no emigration or dispersal of individuals, and no gene flow with other orca populations. There is evidence that other species of dolphins may also have dialects.

In bottlenose dolphin studies by Wells in Sarasota, Florida, and Smolker in Shark Bay, Australia, females of a community are all linked either directly or through a mutual association in an overall social structure known as &quot;fission-fusion&quot;. Groups of the strongest association are known as &quot;bands&quot;, and their composition can remain stable over years. There is some genetic evidence that band members may be related, but these bands are not necessarily limited to a single matrilineal line. There is no evidence that bands compete with each other. In the same research areas, as well as in Moray Firth, Scotland, males form strong associations of two to three individuals, with a coefficient of association between 70 and 100. These groups of males are known as &quot;alliances&quot;, and members often display synchronous behaviors such as respiration, jumping, and breaching. Alliance composition is stable on the order of tens of years, and may provide a benefit for the acquisition of females for mating.
The complex social strategies of marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins, &quot;provide interesting parallels&quot; with the social strategies of elephants and chimpanzees.

===Complex play===
Dolphins are known to engage in complex play behavior, which includes such things as producing stable underwater toroidal air-core vortex rings or &quot;bubble rings&quot;. There are two main methods of bubble ring production: rapid puffing of a burst of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring; or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the helical vortex currents thus formed. The dolphin will often then examine its creation visually and with sonar. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex-rings they have created, so that they burst into many separate normal bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Certain whales are also known to produce bubble rings or bubble nets for the purpose of foraging. Many dolphin species also play by riding in waves, whether natural waves near the shoreline in a method akin to human &quot;body-surfing&quot;, or within the waves induced by the bow of a moving boat in a behavior known as &quot;bow riding&quot;.

===Cross-species cooperation===
There have been instances in captivity of various species of dolphin and porpoise helping and interacting across species, including helping beached whales. Dolphins have also been known to aid human swimmers in need, and in at least one instance a distressed dolphin approached human divers seeking assistance.

===Creative behavior===

Aside from having exhibited the ability to learn complex tricks, dolphins have also demonstrated the ability to produce creative responses. This was studied by Karen Pryor during the mid-1960s at Sea Life Park in Hawaii, and was published as &quot;The Creative Porpoise: Training for Novel Behavior&quot; in 1969. The two test subjects were two rough-toothed dolphins (&quot;Steno bredanensis&quot;), named Malia (a regular show performer at Sea Life Park) and Hou (a research subject at adjacent Oceanic Institute). The experiment tested when and whether the dolphins would identify that they were being rewarded (with fish) for originality in behavior and was very successful. However, since only two dolphins were involved in the experiment, the study is difficult to generalize.

Starting with the dolphin named Malia, the method of the experiment was to choose a particular behavior exhibited by her each day and reward each display of that behavior throughout the day&#x27;s session. At the start of each new day Malia would present the prior day&#x27;s behavior, but only when a new behavior was exhibited was a reward given. All behaviors exhibited were, at least for a time, known behaviors of dolphins. After approximately two weeks Malia apparently exhausted &quot;normal&quot; behaviors and began to repeat performances. This was not rewarded.

According to Pryor, the dolphin became almost despondent. However, at the sixteenth session without novel behavior, the researchers were presented with a flip they had never seen before. This was reinforced. As related by Pryor, after the new display: &quot;instead of offering that again she offered a tail swipe we&#x27;d never seen; we reinforced that. She began offering us all kinds of behavior that we hadn&#x27;t seen in such a mad flurry that finally we could hardly choose what to throw fish at&quot;.

The second test subject, Hou, took thirty-three sessions to reach the same stage. On each occasion the experiment was stopped when the variability of dolphin behavior became too complex to make further positive reinforcement meaningful.

The same experiment was repeated with humans, and it took the volunteers about the same length of time to figure out what was being asked of them. After an initial period of frustration or anger, the humans realised they were being rewarded for novel behavior. In dolphins this realisation produced excitement and more and more novel behaviorsin humans it mostly just produced relief.

Captive orcas have displayed responses indicating they get bored with activities. For instance, when Paul Spong worked with the orca Skana, he researched her visual skills. However, after performing favorably in the 72 trials per day, Skana suddenly began consistently getting every answer wrong. Spong concluded that a few fish were not enough motivation. He began playing music, which seemed to provide Skana with much more motivation.

At the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi, it has also been observed that the resident dolphins seem to show an awareness of the future. The dolphins are trained to keep their own tank clean by retrieving rubbish and bringing it to a keeper, to be rewarded with a fish. However, one dolphin, named Kelly, has apparently learned a way to get more fish, by hoarding the rubbish under a rock at the bottom of the pool and bringing it up one small piece at a time.

===Use of tools===

, scientists have observed wild bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia using a basic tool. When searching for food on the sea floor, many of these dolphins were seen tearing off pieces of sponge and wrapping them around their rostra, presumably to prevent abrasions and facilitate digging.
==Communication==

Whales use a variety of sounds for their communication and sensation. Odontocete (toothed whale) vocal production is classified in three categories: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls:
*Clicks are very brief vocal sounds produced in rapid series for echolocation. Echoes of the clicks contain sound data about the surroundings transmitted through the ears to the brain, which is able to resolve echoes into information.
* Whistlesnarrow-band frequency modulated (FM) signalsare used for communicative purposes, such as contact calls, or the signature whistle of bottlenose dolphins. Whistles are the primary social vocalization among the majority of Delphinidae species.

*Pulsed calls are significant for a few cetacean species, such as the narwhal, and the orca. These calls have distinct tonal qualities and a complex harmonic structure. Typically 0.5–1.5 s in duration, they are the primary social vocalization of orcas. Researchers John Ford, Graeme Ellis, and Ken Balcomb wrote, &quot;By varying the timbre and frequency structure of the calls, the whales can generate a variety of signals…Most calls contain sudden shifts or rapid sweeps in pitch, which give them distinctive qualities recognizable over distance and background noise.&quot;

There is strong evidence that some specific whistles, called &quot;signature whistles&quot;, are used by dolphins to identify and/or call each other; dolphins have been observed emitting both other specimens&#x27; signature whistles, and their own. A unique signature whistle develops quite early in a dolphin&#x27;s life, and it appears to be created in imitation of the signature whistle of the dolphin&#x27;s mother. Imitation of the signature whistle seems to occur only among the mother and its young, and among befriended adult males.

Xitco reported the ability of dolphins to eavesdrop passively on the active echolocative inspection of an object by another dolphin. Herman calls this effect the &quot;acoustic flashlight&quot; hypothesis, and may be related to findings by both Herman and Xitco on the comprehension of variations on the pointing gesture, including human pointing, dolphin postural pointing, and human gaze, in the sense of a redirection of another individual&#x27;s attention, an ability which may require theory of mind.

The environment where dolphins live makes experiments much more expensive and complicated than for many other species; additionally, the fact that cetaceans can emit and hear sounds (which are believed to be their main means of communication) in a range of frequencies much wider than humans can means that sophisticated equipment, which was scarcely available in the past, is needed to record and analyse them. For example, clicks can contain significant energy in frequencies greater than 110 kHz (for comparison, it is unusual for a human to be able to hear sounds above 20 kHz), requiring that equipment have a sampling rates of at least 220 kHz; MHz-capable hardware is often used.

In addition to the acoustic communication channel, the visual modality is also significant. The contrasting pigmentation of the body may be used, for example with &quot;flashes&quot; of the hypopigmented ventral area of some species, as can the production of bubble streams during signature whistling. Also, much of the synchronous and cooperative behaviors, as described in the Behavior section of this entry, as well as cooperative foraging methods, likely are managed at least partly by visual means.

Experiments have shown that they can learn human sign language and can use whistles for 2-way human–animal communication. Phoenix and Akeakamai, bottlenose dolphins, understood individual words and basic sentences like &quot;touch the frisbee with your tail and then jump over it&quot;. Phoenix learned whistles, and Akeakamai learned sign language. Both dolphins understood the significance of the ordering of tasks in a sentence.

A study conducted by Jason Bruck of the University of Chicago showed that bottlenose dolphins can remember whistles of other dolphins they had lived with after 20 years of separation. Each dolphin has a unique whistle that functions like a name, allowing the marine mammals to keep close social bonds.
The new research shows that dolphins have the longest memory yet known in any species other than humans.

==Self-awareness==
Self-awareness, though not well defined scientifically, is believed to be the precursor to more advanced processes like meta-cognitive reasoning (thinking about thinking) that are typical of humans. Scientific research in this field has suggested that bottlenose dolphins, alongside elephants and great apes, possess self-awareness.

The most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the mirror test, developed by Gordon Gallup in the 1970s, in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal&#x27;s body, and the animal is then presented with a mirror.

In 1995, Marten and Psarakos used television to test dolphin self-awareness. They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage, and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. While this particular study has not been repeated since then, dolphins have since passed the mirror test. However, some researchers have argued that evidence for self-awareness has not been convincingly demonstrated.

<text>The British Columbia Railway Company , commonly known as BC Rail, is a railway in the Canadian province of British Columbia.

Chartered as a private company in 1912 as the Pacific Great Eastern Railway (PGE), it was acquired by the provincial government in 1918. In 1972 it was renamed to the British Columbia Railway, and in 1984 it took on the BC Rail branding. From 1978 to 2000, BC Rail was highly profitable, posting profits in every year throughout that period.

Until 2004 it operated as the third-largest railway in Canada, providing freight, passenger, and excursion rail services throughout BC on of mainline track. It also ran the &quot;Royal Hudson&quot; services, as well as the premier of British Columbia&#x27;s private train.

It was designated a Class II Railway until 2004. In 2004, the freight operations (including a vast amount of land, buildings, and all rolling stock) of BC Rail were leased to Canadian National Railway (CN) for an initial period of 60 years, with the exception of the Deltaport Spur, for the price of $550 million.

BC Rail remains an operating Crown corporation today. It retains ownership of the entire rail bed stretching from Prince George to North Vancouver, as well as ownership of all assets leased to CN. BC Rail retains significant real estate investments throughout BC, and a stretch of track from Roberts Bank Superport in Delta to Langley. The planned sale of this stretch was cancelled after the initial BC Rail scandal.

==History==

===1912–1948===
The Pacific Great Eastern Railway (PGE) was incorporated on February 27, 1912, to build a line from Vancouver north to a connection with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) at Prince George. Although independent from the GTP, the PGE had agreed that the GTP, whose western terminus was at the remote northern port of Prince Rupert, could use their line to gain access to Vancouver. The railway was given its name due to a loose association with England&#x27;s Great Eastern Railway. Its financial backers were Timothy Foley, Patrick Welch, and John Stewart, whose construction firm of Foley, Welch and Stewart was among the leading railway contractors in North America. Upon incorporation, the PGE took over the Howe Sound and Northern Railway, which at that point had built of track north of Squamish. The British Columbia government gave the railway a guarantee of principal and 4% interest (later increased to 4.5% to make the bonds saleable) on the construction bonds of the railway.

By 1915, the line was opened from Squamish north to Chasm. The railway was starting to run out of money, however. In 1915 it failed to make an interest payment on its bonds, obliging the provincial government to make good on its bond guarantee. In the 1916 provincial election campaign, the Liberal Party alleged that some of the money advanced to the railway for bond guarantee payments had instead gone into Conservative Party campaign funds. In the election, the Conservatives, who had won 40 of 42 seats in the legislature in the 1912 election, lost to the Liberals. The Liberals then took Foley, Welch and Stewart to court to recover $5 million of allegedly unaccounted funds. In early 1918, the railway&#x27;s backers agreed to pay the government $1.1 million and turn the railway over to the government.

When the government took over the railway, two separate sections of trackage had been completed: A small section between North Vancouver and Horseshoe Bay, and one between Squamish and Clinton. By 1921, the provincial government had extended the railway to a point north of Quesnel, still south of a connection to Prince George, but it was not extended further. The track north of Quesnel was later removed. Construction of the line between Horseshoe Bay and Squamish was given a low priority because there was already a barge in operation between Squamish and Vancouver, and the railway wanted to discontinue operations on the North Vancouver-Horseshoe Bay line. However, the railway had an agreement with the municipality of West Vancouver to provide passenger service that it was unable to get out of until 1928, when they paid the city $140,000 in support of its road-building programme. The last trains on the line ran on November 29, 1928, and the line fell into disuse, but was never formally abandoned.

For the next 20 years the railway would run from &quot;nowhere to nowhere&quot;. It did not connect with any other railway, and there were no large urban centres on its route. It existed mainly to connect logging and mining operations in the British Columbia Interior with the coastal town of Squamish, where resources could then be transported by sea. The government still intended for the railway to reach Prince George, but the resources to do so were not available, especially during the Great Depression and World War II. The unfortunate state of the railway caused it to be given nicknames such as &quot;Province&#x27;s Great Expense&quot;, &quot;Prince George Eventually&quot;, &quot;Past God&#x27;s Endurance&quot;, &quot;Please Go Easy&quot;, and &quot;Puff, Grunt and Expire&quot;.

===1949–1971===

Starting in 1949, the Pacific Great Eastern began to expand. Track was laid north of Quesnel to a junction with the Canadian National Railway at Prince George. That line opened on November 1, 1952. Between 1953 and 1956 the PGE constructed a line between Squamish and North Vancouver. The PGE used their former right-of-way between North Vancouver and Horseshoe Bay, to the dismay of some residents of West Vancouver who, mistakenly believing the line was abandoned, had encroached on it. The line opened on August 27, 1956. By 1958 the PGE had reached north from Prince George to Fort St. John and to Dawson Creek where it met the Northern Alberta Railways.

In 1958, Premier of British Columbia W.A.C. Bennett boasted that he would extend the railway to the Yukon and Alaska, and further extension of the railway was undertaken in the 1960s. A spur was constructed to Mackenzie in 1966. A third line was extended west from the mainline (somewhat north of Prince George) to Fort St. James. It was completed on August 1, 1968. The largest construction undertaken in the 1960s was to extend the mainline from Fort St. John north to Fort Nelson, less than away from the Yukon. The Fort Nelson Subdivision was opened by Premier Bennett on September 10, 1971. Unfortunately, the opening of the line was overshadowed by the inaugural train derailing south of Williams Lake, south of Prince George.

===1972–1989===
The railway underwent two changes of name during this time period. In 1972, the railway&#x27;s name was changed to the British Columbia Railway (BCR). In 1984, the BCR was restructured. Under the new organization, BC Rail Ltd. was formed, owned jointly by the British Columbia Railway Company (BCRC) and by a BCRC subsidiary, BCR Properties Ltd. The rail operations became known as BC Rail.

In 1973, the British Columbia government acquired and restored an ex-Canadian Pacific Railway 4-6-4 steam locomotive of the type known as &quot;Royal Hudsons&quot;, a name that King George VI permitted the class to be called after the Canadian Pacific Railway used one on the royal train in 1939. The locomotive that the government acquired, numbered 2860, was built in 1940 and was the first one built as a Royal Hudson. The government then leased it, along with ex-Canadian Pacific 2-8-0 #3716 to the British Columbia Railway, which started excursion service with the locomotive between North Vancouver and Squamish on June 20, 1974. The train ran between June and September on Wednesdays through Sundays from 1974 to 2001. During this time, the Royal Hudson Steam Train was the only regularly scheduled, mainline steam operation on a Class 1 railroad in North America. 

In the 1960s, a new line had been projected to run northwest from Fort St. James to Dease Lake, away. On October 15, 1973, the first of the extension to Lovell (lat 55°33′, long 126°2′) were opened. The cost of the line was significantly greater than what was estimated, however. Contractors working on the remainder of the line alleged that the railway had misled them regarding the amount of work required so that it could obtain low bids, and took the railway to court.

The Dease Lake line was starting to appear increasingly uneconomical. There was a world decline in the demand for asbestos and copper, two main commodities that would be hauled over the line. As well, the Cassiar Highway that already served Dease Lake had recently been upgraded. Combined with the increasing construction costs, the Dease Lake line could no longer be justified. Construction stopped on April 5, 1977. Track had been laid to Jackson Creek (lat 56°50, long 128°12′), past Fort St. James, and clearing and grading were in progress on the rest of the extension. It had cost $168 million to that point, well over twice the initial estimate. The trackbed can be seen on Google Earth all the way to Dease Lake, via the small towns of Leo Creek (lat 55°3′, long 125°33′) and Takla Landing (lat 55°29′, long 125°58′).

The management and operation of the railway had been called into question, and on February 7, 1977, the provincial government appointed a Royal Commission, the McKenzie Royal Commission, to investigate the railway. Its recommendations were released on August 25, 1978. It recommended that construction not continue on the of roadbed between Dease Lake and the current end of track, and that trains be terminated at Driftwood (approx. lat 55°42, long 126°15′), past Lovell. The rest of the track would be left in place but not used. In 1983, after logging operations ceased at Driftwood and traffic declined sharply, the Dease Lake line was closed. However, it was reopened in 1991 and, as of 2005, extends to a point called Minaret Creek, British Columbia (lat 56°20′, long 127°17′), still over south of Dease Lake. Many of the commission&#x27;s other recommendations, including the abandonment of the Fort Nelson line, and discontinuation of uneconomic operations such as passenger services, were not followed.
In the early 1980s the railway built a new line and acquired another. The Tumbler Ridge Subdivision, a electrified branch line, opened in 1983 to the Quintette and Bullmoose mines, two coal mines northeast of Prince George that produced coal for Japan. It has the lowest crossing of the Rocky Mountains by a railway, at . There are two large tunnels under the mountains: The Table Tunnel, long, and the Wolverine Tunnel, long. Electrified owing to the long tunnels and close proximity to the W. A. C. Bennett Dam and transmission lines, it was one of the few electrified freight lines in North America. Although initially profitable, the traffic on the line was never as high as initially predicted, and by the 1990s was under one train per day. The railway had incurred much debt building the branch line, and the expensive, unprofitable operations on the branch line could not help to repay that debt. In 1984, BC Rail acquired the British Columbia Harbours Board Railway, a line that connects three class I railways with Roberts Bank, an ocean terminal that handles coal shipments. Since the line had been constructed in 1969, it had been leased to the CPR, Burlington Northern Railroad, and Canadian National Railway in succession.

===1990–2003===

In the early 1990s, the provincial government reduced subsidies to BC Rail. As a result, BC Rail, burdened with several money-losing services that it was required to operate, saw its debtload grow more than sixfold between 1991 and 2001.

In the 1990s, BC Rail branched out into shipping operations, acquiring terminal operator Vancouver Wharves in 1993 and Canadian Stevedoring and its subsidiary, Casco Terminals, in 1998. In 1999 these operations became the three operating divisions of a new entity, BCR Marine. BCR Group became the parent company of both BCR Marine and BC Rail. In early 2003, attempting to reduce the railway&#x27;s large debt, BCR Group sold its BCR Marine assets except for Vancouver Wharves (which was also not included in the subsequent sale of BC Rail to Canadian National, and remains a provincial Crown corporation).

On August 19, 2000, the Quintette mine closed, and the portion of the Tumbler Ridge Subdivision between Teck and Quintette, British Columbia, was abandoned. The last electric locomotives ran along the line on September 29, 2000, after which the line was worked by diesel locomotives. The Bullmoose mine closed on April 10, 2003, after which the remaining of the Tumbler Ridge Subdivision between Teck and Wakely was abandoned, although the track is still in place. The electric locomotives were shipped south to Tacoma, Washington, where they are being dismantled by CEECO Rail Services. One of the locomotives (6001) was purchased by the Paul D. Roy family and they donated it to the Prince George Railway and Forestry Museum in Prince George where it is being preserved.
Several other services were also discontinued around this time. The Royal Hudson steam train excursion was discontinued at the end of the 2001 excursion season. The 2860 was out of service in 2000, needing extensive repairs. The backup steam locomotive, a 2-8-0 locomotive built for the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1912, broke down in May 2001, and for the rest of the season BC Rail used a former Canadian Pacific Railway FP7A diesel locomotive #4069 that it had leased from the West Coast Railway Association in Squamish.

Passenger train service, which consisted of the Budd-RDC operated &quot;Cariboo Prospector&quot; and &quot;Whistler Northwind&quot; (Pacific starlight dinner train) trains, ended October 31, 2002. The service was unprofitable, allegedly owing to BC Rail&#x27;s heavy dependence on their fleet of aging Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDC), which were becoming increasingly expensive to keep in service. The RDCs have since been sold to various museums and operators around North America, such as the Wilton Scenic Railroad in New Hampshire and the West Coast Railway Association in Squamish.

Service between Seton Portage and Lillooet was replaced by a railbus. As well, around this time BC Rail ended its intermodal service.

===Lease to CN===

On May 13, 2003, BC Premier Gordon Campbell announced that the government would sell the operations of the railway (including all assets other than the rail right-of-way). During the previous election, he had promised not to sell the railway, and said that he was keeping this promise by retaining ownership of the right-of-way and only leasing the land to the operator. On November 25, Canadian National&#x27;s (CN) bid of $1 billion was accepted over those of several other companies, including the Canadian Pacific Railway, the BNSF Railway, and OmniTRAX. The transaction was closed on July 15, 2004. The lease of the rail right-of-way is for 60 years with a 30-year option to renew. At the renewal date, the BC government will have the option of buying back all the assets from CN. Conversely, as of July 15, 2009, the fifth anniversary of the contract, CN has the right to decommission any part of the line, but upon doing so the land reverts to the Crown, though the Crown can sell it back to CN for one dollar.

The one portion of the BC Rail line not included in the sale was the Port Subdivision from Roberts Bank connecting to the main CN, CPR and BNSF lines. Originally the operation of this line was to be sold separately. However, irregularities came up during the sale process including a government employee, David Basi, being accused of accepting a bribe from a lobbyist, Erik Bornmann, working on behalf of OmniTRAX, who turned Crown witness in exchange for conditional amnesty, which enabled the RCMP to charge Basi. Another irregularity was that CPR withdrew their bid because CN had access to secret government information, including confidential information on their own corporate operations. The sale of the spur line was cancelled, and the remnants of BC Rail Company continues to operate and maintain this line.

The lease contract did not include the sale of BC Rail&#x27;s assets, including the land and rights-of-way. As well, passenger rights were not included. The contract requires CN to yield trackage to any private operator who requests it for the purposes of carrying passengers on commercially reasonable terms.

As per the terms of the lease, CN holds the sole right to renew the contract for up to 999 years through a series of options. The lease also allows for BC Rail to give CN title to any and all of the railway for the nominal price of $1. The lease was the subject of the biggest political scandal in BC history resulting in the BC Legislature Raids. The BC Liberal government was accused of lying about the state of BC Rail&#x27;s debts and viability in order to justify the deal with CN, claiming the railway was in disarray. Canadian Pacific, a rival bidder, privately stated in since-released communications that the bid was &quot;rigged&quot;.

In 2010, two BC Liberal Party ministerial aides pleaded guilty to charges of breach of trust and receiving a benefit for leaking information about the BC Rail leasing process, with both being sentenced to two years less a day of house arrest and 150 hours of community service.

===CN era (2004–present)===
On August 5, 2005, a 144-car CN train heading inland from Brackendale, derailed spilling eight empty lumber flat cars and one tank car of sodium hydroxide. The tank car spilled sodium hydroxide into the Cheakamus River, killing most of its fish.

Moran is a railway point on the BC Rail line north of Pavilion, British Columbia. The location, which is high on the side of the stretch of the Fraser Canyon known as Moran Canyon, is notable as the site of the proposed Moran Dam. At Moran, on June 29, 2006, a diesel locomotive hauling one flatcar of lumber down the steep Pavilion grade north of Lillooet had its air brakes fail. The train gathered speed until it derailed over a steep gravelly slope; two of the three crew members were killed.

In late March 2020, CN announced that it planned on abolishing through freight on the Lillooet Subdivision, between Williams Lake and Lillooet; as well as on the Squamish Sub, between Lillooet and Squamish. With some mills already curtailing operations and a further slowdown expected due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, on-line traffic did not warrant use of the section of railway, which runs through treacherous and maintenance-intensive territory. On April 7, the last regularly scheduled freight train arrived at the yard in Squamish. The remaining traffic in Williams Lake and points north now moves to the Greater Vancouver area via Prince George and the CN mainline. On the Squamish Subdivision, CN reportedly provided service to Continental Log homes in Mount Currie, and continues to use the line for railcar storage. The Rocky Mountaineer luxury railtour sightseeing train still operates during the summer, as the only remaining through train on the line.

==Freight services==
The railway transported a wide variety of products, from resource traffic to intermodal freight. Forest products were one of the main products transported by the railway. Before the lease of operations to CN, the railway transported over 120,000 carloads of lumber, pulp, woodchips, and other forest products per year. The railway served several lumber and pulp mills in the province. Between 1983 and 2003, the railway hauled coal in unit trains from the Teck and Quintette mines near Tumbler Ridge to Prince George, from where CN would haul the trains to Prince Rupert for shipment to Japan. The Quintette mine, the larger-producing of the two, closed in 2000 and the Teck mine closed in 2003.

Starting in the 1960s, the PGE operated an intermodal service that transported truck trailers between North Vancouver and Prince George, and to places further north. Unlike most of the railway&#x27;s other traffic, most of the intermodal traffic was northbound. In April 1982, the railway combined its piggyback and less-than-carload (LCL) services to form a new Intermodal Services Department. BC Rail halted its intermodal services in 2002. Starting in 1958, the railway started to haul grain from the Peace River District, serving grain elevators at Dawson Creek, Buick, Fort St. John, and Taylor. With an amendment to the &quot;Western Grain Transportation Act&quot; in 1985 that included the railway in the act, it became economical for the railway to transport grain, and it also carried grain from Northern Alberta bound for Prince Rupert, interchanging with CN at Dawson Creek and Prince George.

From the 1920s to the 1960s, the railway also carried gold concentrate and bullion from the Bridge River goldfield towns of Bralorne and Pioneer Mine, which were trucked out of the goldfield area over the Mission Pass to the railway at Shalalth. The main freight company operating out of Shalalth was Evans Transportation Co., which grew to be one of the biggest transportation companies in the province. In addition to gold concentrate and ore, Evans and other companies based in Shalalth carried passengers, heavy equipment, and supplies of all kinds over the Mission Pass.

===Interchanges===
Between 1928 and 1952, the PGE interchanges were difficult—at Squamish there was a barge connection to North Vancouver and the rest of the North American railroads; after 1952 the PGE could connect with CN at Prince George. Connections were made to other railways when the railway completed its Howe Sound link in 1956. The main connection to the North American rail network was in North Vancouver, where there was a connection to CN. There was also a rail connection to deep-sea terminal operator Vancouver Wharves, and some interchange occurred with the Union Pacific Railroad through the Seaspan railbarge link between North Vancouver and Seattle, Washington. The railway also interchanged with CN at Prince George, and with Northern Alberta Railways (acquired by CN in 1981) at Dawson Creek. CN&#x27;s line between Dawson Creek, British Columbia, and Hythe, Alberta, fell into disuse in 1998, but CN agreed to reopen it as a condition of purchasing BC Rail. However, the line between Dawson Creek and Hythe is still disused.

===Reporting marks===

Reporting marks are a system intended to help keep track of rolling stock and financial transactions between railways. The Pacific Great Eastern Railway used the reporting mark PGE. It later adopted the reporting mark PGER in 1971 for freight cars in international service. When the railway was renamed to the British Columbia Railway, it adopted the reporting mark BCOL. Initially, there was a distinction made between cars intended for local usage only (BCOL = BC On Line) and cars intended to be interchanged with other railways (BCIT = BC Interchange Traffic). Some cars, intended for use on the Northeast Coal connection were given BCNE.

==Passenger services==
Since the line opened, the PGE had provided passenger service between Squamish and Quesnel (as well as between North Vancouver and Horseshoe Bay until operations were discontinued there in 1928). When the PGE reached Prince George and North Vancouver, daily service was extended to these cities. Service between Lillooet and Prince George was cut back to three times weekly in the 1960s. In 1978, the McKenzie Royal Commission recommended that the BCR eliminate its passenger services, which were losing over $1 million per year, unless it received government funding for them, but the BCR did not do so. However, facing large losses and an ageing fleet of Budd Rail Diesel Cars, it reduced passenger operations to three trains weekly to Lillooet and once weekly to Prince George on February 16, 1981. This service reduction led to public outrage, and the British Columbia government agreed to provide subsidies for passenger operations. The previous level of service was restored on May 4, 1981.

Passenger service ended on October 31, 2002. BC Rail replaced the service between Lillooet and nearby Seton Portage and D&#x27;Arcy with a pair of railbuses, called &quot;track units&quot; by the railway. The railbus on the Kaoham Shuttle makes at least one round trip between Seton Portage and Lillooet daily, and also serves D&#x27;Arcy if there is sufficient demand. The Seton Lake Indian Band manages ticket sales, marketing, and customer service for the Kaoham Shuttle service.

==Excursion services==

The railway&#x27;s best-known excursion service was its Royal Hudson excursion service, which was the only regularly scheduled steam excursion service on mainline trackage in North America. Excursion service started on June 20, 1974, running between North Vancouver and Squamish. By the end of the first season 47,295 passengers had been carried. The Royal Hudson became one of British Columbia&#x27;s primary tourist attractions. It operated between May and October. It was cancelled at the end of the 2001 tourist season.

Two other excursion services were introduced by BC Rail in 1997 and 2001. In 1997, BC Rail introduced the &quot;Pacific Starlight&quot; dinner train, which ran in evenings between May and October between North Vancouver and Porteau Cove. In 2001, BC Rail introduced the &quot;Whistler Northwind&quot;, a luxury excursion train that ran between May and October, northbound from North Vancouver to Prince George or southbound from Prince George to Whistler. The train used several dome cars built by Colorado Railcar. Both services were discontinued at the end of the 2002 season along with BC Rail&#x27;s passenger service.

Historically, and discontinued in the 1960s, the railway operated open-top observation cars all the way from North Vancouver to Lillooet and sometimes beyond.

A series of lodges of varying quality grew up along the railway, drawing on weekend tourist excursions from Vancouver via the steamer service to Squamish. The most famous of these was Rainbow Lodge at Whistler, then called Alta Lake, but others were at Birken Lake, Whispering Falls, D&#x27;Arcy, Ponderosa, McGillivray Falls, Seton Portage, the Bridge River townsite (where there was a first-class hotel serving mining and hydro executives and their guests), Shalalth, Retaskit and at Craig Lodge near Lillooet. The last-named was a swank tennis resort, its attraction being the arid, sunny climate and the waters of Seton Lake.

While BC Rail no longer operates excursion services, it did lease out its line to Rocky Mountaineer Vacations to use, operating two services over the former BC Rail route. The &quot;Whistler Sea to Sky Climb&quot; operated (until spring 2016) between Vancouver and Whistler, which featured an observation car similar to the historical open-top car. The &quot;Rainforest to Gold Rush&quot; train operates north from Vancouver via Whistler and Quesnel to Jasper. Rocky Mountaineer services are exclusively tourist-oriented and do not make local stops nor accept local-area travellers. The fares are significantly higher than former BCR passenger service rates. The West Coast Railway Association returned the Royal Hudson No. 2860 to service during 2006.

==Locomotives==

Until the late 1940s, most motive power on the PGE was provided by steam locomotives. The majority of the railway&#x27;s locomotives were of the 2-6-2, 2-8-0 and 2-8-2 (Whyte notation) wheel configurations. In addition, the railway also used a handful of gasoline cars, notably on a flatcar automobile ferry between Shalalth and Lillooet known simply as &quot;the&quot; Gas Car, once a vital lifeline for the communities of the upper Bridge River basin before the completion of a road from there to Lillooet.

The railway received its first diesel locomotive in June 1948, a General Electric 65-ton locomotive. Over the next two years the railway acquired six GE 70-ton locomotives. In the 1950s, the railway bought RS-3, RS-10, and RS-18 locomotives from the Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW). The railway had fully dieselized by 1956, and by the end of the decade had nearly 40 diesel locomotives. The railway purchased new locomotives exclusively from MLW until 1980. During the 1970s, the railway also purchased several used locomotives, mostly American Locomotive Company (Alco) models from American railways. In the 1980s, the railway acquired new SD40-2 locomotives made by General Motors Diesel, and used SD40–2s made by General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD). In the 1990s and early 2000s, a number of locomotives were purchased from General Electric. Purchased new from GE were 26 (4601-4626) C40-8Ms, 4 C44-9WLs and 10 C44-9Ws. Older, secondhand GE locomotives in the form of B36-7s, C36-7MEs, and B39-8Es were also purchased.

In 1970, the railway started using remote controlled mid-train locomotives, allowing longer and heavier trains to be operated through the steep grades of the Coast Mountains. It initially used separate remote control cars to control the mid-train locomotives, but in 1975 it received eight M-420B locomotives from MLW. These locomotives were specially designed for mid-train operation. They contained remote control stations, and were cableless.

The railway also leased seven GF6C electric locomotives made by GMD for use on the electrified Tumbler Ridge Subdivision from 1983 until electrification was removed in 2000. In 2004, the Paul D. Roy family purchased engine 6001, and they donated it to the Central BC Railway and Forestry Museum in Prince George; the remaining six were scrapped.

For passenger service, the PGE purchased seven Budd Rail Diesel Cars in 1956. Starting in the 1970s, the BCR started to purchase some used RDCs. The RDCs were retired in 2002, when BC Rail ended its passenger services.

The BCR also used some historic locomotives for its Royal Hudson excursion service. The primary steam locomotive for the Royal Hudson excursion train was Canadian Pacific Railway No. 2860, a class H1 4-6-4 Royal Hudson. Made by MLW for the Canadian Pacific Railway in June 1940, it was the first locomotive built as a Royal Hudson. A sister locomotive, No. 2850, pulled King George VI&#x27;s and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s royal train in 1939. After the tour, the King gave the CPR permission to use the term &quot;Royal Hudson&quot; for the class of locomotives. Between 1940 and 1956 it hauled transcontinental passenger trains between Revelstoke and Vancouver. Damaged in a derailment in 1956, it was refurbished and transferred to Winnipeg in 1957 for service on the prairies. It was withdrawn from service in May 1959, replaced by diesel locomotives. It was sold to the Vancouver Railway Museum Association in 1964 and was stored in Vancouver until 1973, when the British Columbia government acquired the locomotive from Joe W. Hussey, who had purchased it three years earlier. It was restored by Robert Swanson and then leased to the British Columbia Railway, who used it in excursion service between 1973 and 2000. It was out of service during the 2001 tourist season, needing extensive repairs. The backup for No. 2860 was Canadian Pacific Railway No. 3716, a 2-8-0 built by MLW in 1912. During the 2001 season, when both steam locomotives were out of service, BC Rail leased No. 4069, a restored Canadian Pacific Railway FP7A diesel locomotive.

In November 2020, as part of the celebrations of the 25th anniversary of CN&#x27;s privatization, the company repainted some of its locomotive units in the schemes of the company&#x27;s predecessor and subsidiary railroads. GE ET44AC No. 3115 was repainted in the blue, white and red livery of BC Rail, along with the logos of that company.

<text>Agriculture in Mesoamerica dates to the Archaic period of Mesoamerican chronology (8000–2000 BC). At the beginning of the Archaic period, the Early Hunters of the late Pleistocene era (50,000–10,000 BC) led nomadic lifestyles, relying on hunting and gathering for sustenance. However, the nomadic lifestyle that dominated the late Pleistocene and the early Archaic slowly transitioned into a more sedentary lifestyle as the hunter gatherer micro-bands in the region began to cultivate wild plants. The cultivation of these plants provided security to the Mesoamericans, allowing them to increase surplus of &quot;starvation foods&quot; near seasonal camps; this surplus could be utilized when hunting was bad, during times of drought, and when resources were low. The cultivation of plants could have been started purposefully, or by accident. The former could have been done by bringing a wild plant closer to a camp site, or to a frequented area, so it was easier access and collect. The latter could have happened as certain plant seeds were eaten and not fully digested, causing these plants to grow wherever human habitation would take them.

As the Archaic period progressed, cultivation of plant foods became increasingly important to the people of Mesoamerica. The reliability of cultivated plants allowed hunting and gathering micro-bands to establish permanent settlements and to increase in size. These larger settlements required a greater quantity of food, consequently leading to an even greater reliance on domesticated crops. Eventually, the Mesoamerican people established a sedentary lifestyle based on plant domestication and cultivation, supplemented with small game hunting. This sedentary lifestyle reliant on agriculture allowed permanent settlements to grow into villages and provided the opportunity for division of labor and social stratification.

The most important plant in ancient Mesoamerica, was, unarguably, maize. Squash and beans were also important staples of the ancient Mesoamerican agricultural diet and along with maize, are often referred to as the &quot;Three Sisters&quot;.

== Early and culturally significant domestic plants ==

Another important crop in Mesoamerican agriculture is squash. Bruce D. Smith discovered evidence of domesticated squash (&quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot;), in Guilá Naquitz cave in Oaxaca. These finds date back to 8000 BC, the beginning of the Archaic period, and are related to today&#x27;s pumpkin. Another important squash that was domesticated in the early Archaic period was the bottle gourd (&quot;Lagenaria siceraria&quot;). The bottle gourd provided storage space for collecting seeds for grinding or planting as well as a means of carrying water. Squashes provided an excellent source of protein to the ancient Mesoamericans, as well as to people today.

Another major food source in Mesoamerica are beans. Maize, beans, and squash form a triad of products, commonly referred to as the &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. Growing these three crops together helps to retain nutrients in the soil.

Rubber trees and cotton plants were useful for making culturally significant products such as rubber balls for Mesoamerican ball games and textiles, respectively. Evidence of these ball games is found throughout Mesoamerica, and the performance of these games is related to many origin myths of the Mesoamerican people. The game had a ritualistic significance and was often accompanied with human sacrifice. The domestication of cotton allowed for textiles of vibrant colors to be created. These textiles are evidence of the Mesoamerican peoples&#x27; fascination with adornment and the cultural value they placed on appearance.

Another culturally important plant was cacao (ancient Mesoamerican chocolate). Cacao was used in rituals (as a drink) and was also used as currency in trade.

The crops above are only a few of the domesticated plants important to the ancient peoples of Mesoamerica. Please see the section below for a more comprehensive list of ancient Mesoamerican domesticated plants.

== Farming techniques ==

One of the greatest challenges in Mesoamerica for farmers is the lack of usable land, and the poor condition of the soil. The two main ways to combat poor soil quality, or lack of nutrients in the soil, are to leave fields fallow for a period of time in a milpa cycle, and to use slash-and-burn techniques. 
Much of the Maya food supply was grown in gardens, known as &quot;pet kot&quot;. The system takes its name from the low wall of stones (&quot;pet&quot; meaning circular and &quot;kot&quot; wall of loose stones) that characteristically surrounds the forest garden plot. The earliest dated maize cobs was discovered in Guilá Naquitz cave in Oaxaca and dates back to 4300 BC. Maize arose through domestication of &quot;teosinte&quot;, which is considered to be the ancestor of maize. Maize can be stored for lengthy periods of time, it can be ground into flour, and it easily provides surplus for future use. Maize was vital to the survival of the Mesoamerican people. Its cultural significance is reflected in Mesoamerican origin myths, artwork, and rituals.

The Mesoamerican natives also used irrigation techniques not unlike other early agricultural societies in early Mesopotamia. However, unlike the arid plains of the Fertile Crescent, the Mesoamerican area has a rougher terrain, therefore making irrigation less effective than terraced farming and slash-and-burn techniques.

Slash-and-burn techniques are a type of extensive farming, where the amount of labor is minimal in taking care of farmland. Extensive farming uses less labor but had a larger mark on the area around them. In opposition, intensive agriculture refers to agriculture that involves large amounts of labor, permitting bigger yields from the same land area, thus making it better suited for a sedentary lifestyle.

<text>A sept () is a division of a family, especially of a Scottish or Irish family. The term is used in both Scotland and Ireland, where it may be translated as &quot;sliocht&quot;, meaning &quot;progeny&quot; or &quot;seed&quot;, which may indicate the descendants of a person (for example, &quot;Sliocht Bhriain Mhic Dhiarmada&quot;, &quot;the descendant of Brian MacDermott&quot;). The word may derive from the Latin &quot;saeptum&quot;, meaning &quot;enclosure&quot; or &quot;fold&quot;, or via an alteration of &quot;sect&quot;.

==Family branches==
&quot;Síol&quot; is a Gaelic word meaning &quot;progeny&quot; or &quot;seed&quot; that is used in the context of a family or clan with members who bear the same surname and inhabited the same territory, as a manner of distinguishing one group from another; a family called &quot;Mac an Bháird&quot; (anglicised as &quot;Ward&quot;) might be divided into septs such as &quot;Síol Sheáin Mhic Bhriain&quot;, &quot;Síol Chonchobhair Óig&quot;, &quot;Síol Sheáin Chuinn&quot;, or &quot;Síol Chon Chonnacht&quot;.

Each of these individual septs may further subdivide into more septs, which may sometimes lead to the development of novel surnames and/or the rise of the family such that it may be considered a clan in its own right. Such septs were common in Scotland, where the clan system was well-developed.

==Scotland==
In the context of Scottish clans, septs are families that followed another family&#x27;s chief, or part of the extended family and that hold a different surname. These smaller septs would then be part of the chief&#x27;s larger clan. A sept might follow another chief if two families were linked through marriage, or, if a family lived on the land of a powerful laird, they would follow him whether they were related or not. Bonds of manrent were sometimes used to bind lesser chiefs and his followers to more powerful chiefs. According to the &quot;Oxford Companion to Scottish History&quot;, the MacMartins of Letterfinlay who were a sept of the Clan Cameron would have seen themselves as distinct within their own lands, but would have also seen themselves as Camerons if operating elsewhere outside Lochaber. Bonds of manrent and friendship tied obviously non-related kin groups into a wider military, political, and land/food resource sharing clanship.

Today, sept lists are used by clan societies to recruit new members. Such lists date back to the 19th century, when clan societies and tartan manufacturers attempted to capitalise on the enthusiasm and interest for all things Scottish. Lists were drawn up that linked as many surnames as possible to a particular clan, regardless of whether there was an actual historical connection to that clan surname. In this way, individuals without a &quot;clan name&quot; could connect to a Scottish clan and thus feel &quot;entitled&quot; to its tartan.

Also, common surnames, found throughout the British Isles, were linked to particular clans. For example, the surname &quot;Miller&quot;/&quot;Millar&quot; was made a sept of Clan MacFarlane, and &quot;Taylor&quot; of Clan Cameron, Mason was made a sept of Clan Sinclair. Furthermore, patronymic forms of common personal names were also linked to particular clans. This has led to the false impression that many surnames have one origin and are all related to one another, and that such surnames are historically connected to one particular clan.

==Ireland==

Historically, the term &quot;sept&quot; was not used in Ireland until the 19th century, long after any notion of clanship had been eradicated. The English word &quot;sept&quot; is most accurate in referring to a subgroup within a large clan, particularly when that group has taken up residence outside their clan&#x27;s original territory (e.g. the O&#x27;Neills, MacSweeneys, and O&#x27;Connors).

Related Irish clans often belong to larger groups, dynasties, such as the Dál gCais, Uí Néill, Uí Fiachrach, and Uí Maine.

Recently, Edward MacLysaght suggested the English word &quot;sept&quot; be used in place of the word &#x27;clan&#x27; with regard to the historical social structure in Ireland, to differentiate it from the centralised Scottish clan system. This would imply that Ireland possessed no formalised clan system, which is not wholly accurate. Brehon Law, the ancient legal system of Ireland clearly defined the clan system in pre-Norman Ireland, with its electoral system limited to the senior sept&#x27;s members (see derbfine), which collapsed after the Tudor Conquest in the 16th century. The Irish, when speaking of themselves, employed their term &quot;clann&quot;, which means &quot;children&quot; in Irish.

<doc id="336661" wikidata="Q411638" url="?curid=336661" title="Glucuronolactone">
<text>Glucuronolactone or Glucurolactone (INN) is a naturally occurring substance that is an important structural component of nearly all connective tissues. It is sometimes used in energy drinks. Unfounded claims that glucuronolactone can be used to reduce &quot;brain fog&quot; are based on research conducted on energy drinks that contain other active ingredients that have been shown to improve cognitive function, such as caffeine. Glucuronolactone is also found in many plant gums.

== Physical and chemical properties ==
Glucuronolactone is a white solid odorless compound, soluble in hot and cold water. Its melting point ranges from 176 to 178 °C. The compound can exist in a monocyclic aldehyde form or in a bicyclic hemiacetal (lactol) form.

== History ==
It is unknown if glucuronolactone is safe for human consumption due to a lack of proper human or animal trials. However, it likely has limited effects on the human body. Furthermore research on isolated supplements of glucuronolactone is limited, no warnings appear on the Food and Drug Administration website regarding its potential to cause brain tumors or other maladies.

== Uses ==

Glucuronolactone is an ingredient used in some energy drinks, often in unnaturally high doses. Research into Glucuronolactone is too limited to assert claims about its safety The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has concluded that it is unlikely that glucurono-γ-lactone would have any interaction with caffeine, taurine, alcohol or the effects of exercise. The Panel also concluded, based on the data available, that additive interactions between taurine and caffeine on diuretic effects are unlikely.

According to &quot;The Merck Index&quot;, glucuronolactone is used as a detoxicant.

Glucuronolactone is also metabolized to glucaric acid, xylitol, and L-xylulose, and humans may also be able to use glucuronolactone as a precursor for ascorbic acid synthesis.

Glucuronolactone is approved in China and Japan as an over-the-counter &quot;hepatoprotectant&quot;, though there is a conspicuous lack of systematic reviews on this use.

<doc id="336678" wikidata="Q421675" url="?curid=336678" title="Louis Le Prince">
<text>Louis Aimé Augustin Le Prince (28 August 1841 – disappeared 16 September 1890, declared dead 16 September 1897) was a French artist and the inventor of an early motion-picture camera, and director of &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot;. 

He was possibly the first person to shoot a moving picture sequence using a single lens camera and a strip of (paper) film. He has been credited as the &quot;Father of Cinematography&quot;, but his work did not influence the commercial development of cinema—owing largely to the events surrounding his 1890 disappearance.

A Frenchman who also worked in the United Kingdom and the United States, Le Prince&#x27;s motion-picture experiments culminated in 1888 in Leeds, England. In October of that year, he filmed moving-picture sequences of family members in &quot;Roundhay Garden&quot; and his son Louis playing the accordion, using his single-lens camera and Eastman&#x27;s paper negative film. At some point in the following eighteen months he also made a film of Leeds Bridge. This work may have been slightly in advance of the inventions of contemporaneous moving-picture pioneers, such as the British inventors William Friese-Greene and Wordsworth Donisthorpe, and was years in advance of that of Auguste and Louis Lumière and William Kennedy Dickson (who did the moving image work for Thomas Edison).

Le Prince was never able to perform a planned public demonstration of his camera in the US because he mysteriously vanished; he was last known to be boarding a train on 16 September 1890. Multiple conspiracy theories have emerged about the reason for his disappearance, including: a murder set up by Edison, secret homosexuality, disappearance in order to start a new life, alien abduction, suicide because of heavy debts and failing experiments, and a murder by his brother over their mother&#x27;s will. No conclusive evidence exists for any of these theories. In 2004, a police archive in Paris was found to contain a photograph of a drowned man bearing a strong resemblance to Le Prince who was discovered in the Seine just after the time of his disappearance, but it has been claimed that the body was too short to be Le Prince.

In early 1890, Edison workers had begun experimenting with using a strip of celluloid film to capture moving images. The first public results of these experiments were shown in May 1891. However, Le Prince&#x27;s widow and son Adolphe were keen to advance Louis&#x27;s cause as the inventor of cinematography. In 1898, Adolphe appeared as a witness for the defence in a court case brought by Edison against the American Mutoscope Company. This suit claimed that Edison was the first and sole inventor of cinematography, and thus entitled to royalties for the use of the process. Adolphe was involved in the case but was not allowed to present his father&#x27;s two cameras as evidence, although films shot with cameras built according to his father&#x27;s patent were presented. Eventually the court ruled in favour of Edison. A year later that ruling was overturned, but Edison then reissued his patents and succeeded in controlling the US film industry for many years.

Le Prince was a Freemason, initiated into the Lodge of Fidelity No. 289 in Leeds in 1876, he later demitted in 1880.

==Early life and education==
Le Prince was born on 28 August 1841 in Metz. His family referred to him as &quot;Augustin&quot; and English-speaking friends would later call him &quot;Gus&quot;. Le Prince&#x27;s father was a major of artillery in the French Army and an officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. When growing up, he reportedly spent time in the studio of his father&#x27;s friend, the pioneer of photography Louis Daguerre, from whom Le Prince may have received some lessons on photography and chemistry before he was 10 years old. His education went on to include the study of painting in Paris and post-graduate chemistry at Leipzig University, which provided him with the academic knowledge he was to utilise in the future.

==Career==

Le Prince moved to Leeds, England in 1866, after being invited to join John Whitley, a friend introduced by a former university lecturer, in &quot;Whitley Partners&quot; of Hunslet, a firm of brass founders making valves and components. In 1869 he married Sarah Elizabeth Whitley, John&#x27;s sister and a talented artist. When in Paris during their honeymoon, Le Prince repeatedly visited a magic show, fascinated by an illusion with moving transparent figures, presumably a dancing skeleton projection at the Théâtre Robert-Houdin with multiple reflections of mirrors focused on one point or a variation of Pepper&#x27;s Ghost.

Le Prince and his wife started a school of applied art, the Leeds Technical School of Art, and became well renowned for their work in fixing coloured photographs on to metal and pottery, leading to them being commissioned for portraits of Queen Victoria and the long-serving Prime Minister William Gladstone produced in this way; these were included alongside other mementos of the time in a time capsule—manufactured by Whitley Partners of Hunslet—which was placed in the foundations of Cleopatra&#x27;s Needle on the embankment of the River Thames.

In 1881, Le Prince went to the United States as an agent for Lincrusta Walton, staying in the country along with his family once his contract had ended. He became the manager for a small group of French artists who produced large panoramas, usually of famous battles, that were exhibited in New York City, Washington, D.C. and Chicago.

During this time he began experiments relating to the production of &#x27;moving&#x27; photographs, designing a camera that utilised sixteen lenses, which was the first invention he patented. Although the camera was capable of &#x27;capturing&#x27; motion, it wasn&#x27;t a complete success because each lens photographed the subject from a slightly different viewpoint and thus the image would have jumped about, if he had been able to project it (which is unknown).
After his return to Leeds in May 1887, Le Prince built a single-lens camera in mid-late 1888. An experimental model was developed in a workshop at 160 Woodhouse Lane, Leeds and used to shoot his motion-picture films. It was first used on 14 October 1888 to shoot what would become known as &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot; and a sequence of his son Adolphe playing the accordion. Le Prince later used it to film road traffic and pedestrians crossing Leeds Bridge. The film was shot from Hicks the Ironmongers, now the British Waterways building on the south east side of the bridge and marked with a commemorative Blue plaque.

==Disappearance==
In September 1890, Le Prince was preparing for a trip to the United States, supposedly to publicly premiere his work and join his wife and children. Before this journey, he decided to return to France to visit his brother in Dijon. Then, on 16 September, he took a train to Paris but, having taken a later train than planned, his friends missed him in Paris. He was never seen again by his family or friends. The last person to see Le Prince at the Dijon station was his brother. The French police, Scotland Yard and the family undertook exhaustive searches, but never found him. Le Prince was officially declared dead in 1897. A number of mostly unsubstantiated theories have been proposed.

===Patent Wars assassination, &quot;Equity 6928&quot;===
Christopher Rawlence pursues the assassination theory, along with other theories, and discusses the Le Prince family&#x27;s suspicions of Edison over patents (the Equity 6928) in his 1990 book and documentary &quot;The Missing Reel&quot;. Rawlence claims that at the time that he vanished, Le Prince was about to patent his 1889 projector in the UK and then leave Europe for his scheduled New York official exhibition. His widow assumed foul play though no concrete evidence has ever emerged and Rawlence prefers the suicide theory. 

In 1898, Le Prince&#x27;s elder son Adolphe, who had assisted his father in many of his experiments, was called as a witness for the American Mutoscope Company in their litigation with Edison [Equity 6928]. By citing Le Prince&#x27;s achievements, Mutoscope hoped to annul Edison&#x27;s subsequent claims to have invented the moving-picture camera. Le Prince&#x27;s widow Lizzie and Adolphe hoped that this would gain recognition for Le Prince&#x27;s achievement, but when the case went against Mutoscope their hopes were dashed. Two years later, Adolphe Le Prince was found dead on Fire Island near New York.

===Disappearance ordered by the family===
In 1966, Jacques Deslandes proposed a theory in &quot;Histoire comparée du cinéma&quot; (The Comparative History of Cinema), claiming that Le Prince voluntarily disappeared due to financial reasons and &quot;familial conveniences&quot;. Journalist Léo Sauvage quotes a note shown to him by Pierre Gras, director of the Dijon municipal library, in 1977, that claimed Le Prince died in Chicago in 1898, having moved there at the family&#x27;s request because he was homosexual; but he rejects that assertion. 
It is extremely likely that this wasn&#x27;t at all true, as there is no evidence to suggest that Le Prince was gay.

===Fratricide, murder for money===
In 1967, Jean Mitry proposed, in &quot;Histoire du cinéma&quot;, that Le Prince was killed. Mitry notes that if Le Prince truly wanted to disappear, he could have done so at any time prior to that. Thus, he most likely never boarded the train in Dijon. He also wonders why, if his brother, who was confirmed as the last person to have seen Le Prince alive, knew Le Prince was suicidal, he didn&#x27;t try to stop Le Prince, and why he didn&#x27;t report Le Prince&#x27;s mental state to the police before it was too late.

===Suspected drowning===
A photograph of a drowned man pulled from the Seine in 1890, strongly resembling Le Prince, was discovered in 2003 during research in the Paris police archives. This led to the theory that he had failed to get his moving picture to work, had heavy debts, and thus chose to take his own life. It has been claimed that the body was too short to be Le Prince.

==Patents and cameras==
On 10 January 1888, Le Prince was granted an American patent on a 16-lens device that he claimed could serve as both motion picture camera (which he termed &quot;the receiver or photo-camera&quot;) and a projector (which he called &quot;the deliverer or stereopticon&quot;). That same day he took out a near-identical provisional patent for the same devices in Great Britain, proposing &quot;a system of preferably 3, 4, 8, 9, 16 or more lenses&quot;. Shortly before the final version was submitted he added a sentence which described a single-lens system, but this was neither fully explained nor illustrated, unlike the several pages of description of the multi-lens system, meaning the single-lens camera was not legally covered by patent.

This addendum was submitted on 10 October 1888 and, on 14 October, Le Prince used his single-lens camera to film &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot;. During the period 1889–1890 he worked with the mechanic James Longley on various &quot;deliverers&quot; (projectors) with one, two, three and sixteen lenses. The images were to be separated, printed and mounted individually, sometimes on a flexible band, moved by metal eyelets. 

The single lens projector used individual pictures mounted in wooden frames. His assistant, James Longley, claimed the three-lens version was the most successful. Those close to Le Prince have testified to him projecting his first films in his workshop as tests, but they were never presented to anyone outside his immediate circle of family and associates and the nature of the projector is unknown.

In 1889, he took French-American dual citizenship in order to establish himself with his family in New York City and to follow up his research. However, he was never able to perform his planned public exhibition at the Morris–Jumel Mansion in Manhattan, in September 1890, due to his disappearance.

==Later recognition==
Even though Le Prince&#x27;s achievement is remarkable, with only William Friese-Greene and Wordsworth Donisthorpe achieving anything comparable in the period 1888–1890, his work was largely forgotten until the 1920s, as he disappeared before the first public demonstration of the result of his work, having never shown his invention to any photographic society or scientific institution or the general public.

For the April 1894 commercial exploitation of his personal kinetoscope parlor, Thomas Edison is credited in the US as the inventor of cinema, while in France, the Lumière Brothers are hailed as inventors of the &quot;Cinématographe&quot; device and for the first commercial exhibition of motion-picture films, in Paris in 1895.

However, in Leeds, Le Prince is celebrated as a local hero. On 12 December 1930, the Lord Mayor of Leeds unveiled a bronze memorial tablet at 160 Woodhouse Lane, Le Prince&#x27;s former workshop. In 2003, the University of Leeds&#x27;s Centre for Cinema, Photography and Television was named in his honour. Le Prince&#x27;s workshop in Woodhouse Lane was until recently the site of the BBC in Leeds, and is now part of the Leeds Beckett University Broadcasting Place complex, where a blue plaque commemorates his work. (coordinates: ). Reconstructions of his film strips are shown in the cinema of the Armley Mills Industrial Museum, Leeds.

In France, an appreciation society was created as L&#x27;Association des Amis de Le Prince (Association of Le Prince&#x27;s Friends), which still exists in Lyon.

In 1990, Christopher Rawlence wrote &quot;The Missing Reel, The Untold Story of the Lost inventor of Moving Pictures&quot; and produced the TV programme &quot;The Missing Reel&quot; (1989) for Channel Four, a dramatised feature on the life of Le Prince.

In 1992, the Japanese filmmaker Mamoru Oshii (&quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;) directed &quot;Talking Head&quot;, an &quot;avant-garde&quot; feature film paying tribute to the cinematography history&#x27;s tragic ending figures such as George Eastman, Georges Méliès and Louis Le Prince who is credited as &quot;the true inventor of &quot;eiga&quot;&quot;, 映画, Japanese for &quot;motion picture film&quot;.

In 2013, a feature documentary, &quot;The First Film&quot; was produced, with new research material and documentation on the life of Le Prince and his patents. Produced and directed by Leeds-born David Nicholas Wilkinson with research by Irfan Shah, it was filmed in England, France and the United States by Guerilla Films. &quot;The First Film&quot; features several film historians to tell the story, including Michael Harvey, Irfan Shah, Stephen Herbert, Mark Rance, Daniel Martin, Jacques Pfend, Adrian Wootton, Tony North, Mick McCann, Tony Earnshaw, Carol S Ward, Liz Rymer, and twice Oscar-nominated cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts. 

Le Prince&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter Laurie Snyder also makes an appearance. It had its world première in June 2015 at the Edinburgh Film Festival and opened in UK cinemas on 3 July 2015. The film also played in festivals in the US, Canada, Russia, Ireland and Belgium. On 8 September 2016 it played at the Morris-Jumel Mansion in New York, where 126 years earlier Le Prince planned to show his films.

In 2023, the Roundhay Garden Scene was shown and recreated for the grand finale of the 10th Annual Live On Cinema Oscar Special.

==Legacy==

===Remaining material and production===
Le Prince developed a single-lens camera in his workshop at 160 Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, which was used to shoot his motion-picture films. Remaining surviving production consists of two scenes in the garden at Oakwood Grange (his wife&#x27;s family home, in Roundhay) and another of Leeds Bridge.

Forty years later, Le Prince&#x27;s daughter, Marie, gave the remaining apparatus to the Science Museum, London (later transferred to the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television (NMPFT), Bradford, which opened in 1983 and is now the National Science and Media Museum). In May 1931, photographic plates were produced by workers of the Science Museum from paper print copies provided by Marie Le Prince. 

In 1999, these were re-animated to produce digital versions. &quot;Roundhay Garden&quot; was alleged by the Le Prince family to have been shot at 12 frame/s and &quot;Leeds Bridge&quot; at 20 frame/s, although this is not borne out by the NMPFT versions (see below) or motion analysis, with both films being estimated at a consistent seven frames a second.

All available versions of these sequences are derived from materials held by the National Science and Media Museum.

===&quot;Man Walking Around a Corner&quot; (16-Lens Camera)===


The only existing images from Le Prince&#x27;s 16-lens camera are a sequence of 16 frames of a man walking around a corner. This appears to have been shot onto a single glass plate (which has since broken), rather than the twin strips of Eastman paper film envisaged in his patent. Jacques Pfend, a French cinema-historian and Le Prince specialist, confirms that these images were shot in Paris, at the corner of Rue Bochart-de-Saron (where Le Prince was living) and Avenue Trudaine. Le Prince sent 8 images of his mechanic running (which may be from this sequence) to his wife in New York City in a letter dated 18 August 1887, which suggests it represented a significant camera test. Exposure is very irregular from lens to lens with some of the images almost completely bleached out, which Le Prince later on fixed.

===&quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot; (Single-Lens Camera MkII)===
The 1931 National Science Museum copy of what remains of a sequence shot in &quot;Roundhay Garden&quot; features 20 frames. The frames appear to have been printed in reverse from the negative, but this is corrected in the video. The film&#x27;s damaged edge results in distortion and deformation on the right side of the stabilised digital movie. The scene was shot in Le Prince&#x27;s father-in-law&#x27;s garden at Oakwood Grange, Roundhay on 14 October 1888. The NMPFT animation lasts two seconds at 24fps (frames per second), meaning the original footage is playing at 10fps. In this version, the action is speeded up – the original footage was probably shot at 7fps.

===&quot;Traffic Crossing Leeds Bridge&quot; (Single-Lens Camera MkII)===
Louis Le Prince filmed traffic crossing Leeds Bridge from Hicks the Ironmongers at the following coordinates: .
The earliest copy belongs to the 1923 NMPFT inventory (frames 118–120 and 122–124), though this longer sequence comes from the 1931 inventory (frames 110–129). According to Adolphe Le Prince who assisted his father when this film was shot in late October 1888, it was taken at 20fps. However, the digitally stabilised sequence produced by the NMPFT lasts two seconds, meaning the footage is playing here at 10fps. As with the &quot;Roundhay Garden&quot; sequence, its appearance is sped up, suggesting the original footage was probably shot at 7fps. This would fit with what we know of the projection experiments, where James Longley reported a top speed of 7fps.

===&quot;Accordion Player&quot; (Single-Lens Camera MkII)===
The last remaining film of Le Prince&#x27;s single-lens camera is a sequence of frames of Adolphe Le Prince playing a diatonic button accordion. It was recorded on the steps of the house of Joseph Whitley, Louis&#x27;s father-in-law. The recording date may be the same as &quot;Roundhay Garden&quot; as the camera is in a similar position and Adolphe is dressed the same. The NMPFT has not remastered this film.

<text>A boxcar is the North American (AAR) and South Australian Railways term for a railroad car that is enclosed and generally used to carry freight. The boxcar, while not the simplest freight car design, is considered one of the most versatile since it can carry most loads. Boxcars have side sliding doors of varying size and operation, and some include end doors and adjustable bulkheads to load very large items.

Similar covered freight cars outside North America are covered goods wagons and, depending on the region, are called &quot;goods van&quot; (UK and Australia), &quot;covered wagon&quot; (UIC and UK) or simply &quot;van&quot; (UIC, UK and Australia).

== Use ==
Boxcars can carry most kinds of freight. Originally they were hand-loaded, but in more recent years mechanical assistance such as forklifts have been used to load and empty them faster. Their generalized design is still slower to load and unload than specialized designs of car, and this partially explains the decline in boxcar numbers since World War II. The other cause for this decline is the dramatic shift of waterborne cargo transport to container shipping. Effectively a boxcar without the wheels and chassis, a container is designed to be amenable to intermodal freight transport, whether by container ships, trucks or flatcars, and can be delivered door-to-door.

Boxcars were used for bulk commodities such as coal, particularly in the Midwestern United States in the early 20th century. This use was sufficiently widespread that several companies developed competing box-car loaders to automate coal loading. By 1905, 350 to 400 such machines were in use, mostly at Midwestern coal mines.

=== Passenger use ===
In the Philippines, Boxcars were used as additional third-class accommodations by the Manila Railway Company during the early 1900s as there was a shortage of true passenger railroad cars. These problems were considered solved by the 1910s as British manufacturer Metropolitan and American builders such as Harlan and Hollingsworth constructed more passenger cars for the railroad.

In the present day, hobos and migrant workers have often used boxcars in their journeys (see freighthopping), since they are enclosed and cannot be seen by railroad police, as well as being to some degree insulated from cold weather. Hobo Code, a form of hieroglyphs used by hobos, developed as a code to give information to Hobos freighthopping.

== Hicube boxcar ==

In the 21st century, high cubic capacity (hicube) boxcars have become more common in the US. These are taller than regular boxcars and as such can only run on routes with increased clearance (see loading gauge and structure gauge). The excess height section of the car end is often painted with a white band to be easily visible if wrongly assigned to a low-clearance line.

The internal height of the hicube boxcars originally used in automotive parts service was generally .

<text>Forty-and-Eight boxcars (), commonly referred to as Forty-and-Eights, were types of French boxcars (&quot;voiture&quot;) used by the French Army and &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. British and American troops were transported to the Western Front in the boxcars marked with &quot;40-8&quot; to denote their capacity: 40 men or 8 horses. 

== History ==

Introduced in the 1870s, the boxcars were pressed into military service by the French Army in both world wars. Between 1940 and 1944 occupying German forces used forty-and-eights to transport troops, POWs, horses, freight, and civilian prisoners to concentration camps. Following the Allied landing at Normandy in June, 1944, the Germans were pushed eastward towards the Rhine. Trains of forty-and-eights were frequent targets of opportunity for Allied fighter-bombers, with carloads of prisoners occasionally being victimized. As France was liberated forty-and-eights were used to transport Allied soldiers and materials to the shifting front through War&#x27;s end in 1945.

==Merci Train boxcars==

In 1949, France sent 49 forty-and-eights to the United States laden with donations from citizens of France in thanks for the U.S.&#x27; role in the liberation of France, one for each of the then forty-eight states and one for Washington, D.C., and Hawaii to share. Called the Merci Train, it was sent in response to the Friendship Train America had created two years earlier to aid France in the dire immediate aftermath of World War II; 700 boxcars worth of donated supplies were collected across the U.S. and shipped across the Atlantic via donated transport.

<text>The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), known from 1924 to 2007 as the Central Bank of China and still referred to under the acronym CBC, is the central bank of the Republic of China. 

Originally founded in 1924 in Guangzhou, the CBC was expelled from Mainland China by the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949 and relocated to Taiwan. It took over banknote issuance on the island from the Bank of Taiwan in 1961. 

Its legal and common name in Chinese is literally translated as the &quot;Central Bank&quot;. The central bank is administered under the Executive Yuan of the ROC government.

==History==

=== Mainland China (1924-1949) ===

The CBC was originally proposed in 1923 by Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Army and Navy Marshal stronghold of the Republic of China and was established in Guangzhou a year later, serving the Nationalist government from 1925. Following the success of the Northern Expedition, the CBC relocated to Shanghai and its head T. V. Soong negotiated a division of labor with the Bank of China in 1928 that refocused the latter on foreign-exchange operations. It was subsequently one of China&#x27;s &quot;Big Four&quot; national banks, along with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, all of which were major banks of issue.

With the turmoil of the 1930s, the CBC successively lost jurisdiction over Northeast China to the Central Bank of Manchou in Changchun, then over parts of North China to the Mengjiang Bank in Kalgan and the United Reserve Bank in Peiping, then over central-eastern China to the Huaxing Commercial Bank then the Central Reserve Bank in Shanghai and Nanjing. In 1937-1938 it relocated to Wuhan, then Chongqing together with the Nationalist government. In late July 1942, it was granted a monopoly over currency issuance in the territorial area controlled by the Nationalist government.

In 1945, the CBC recovered its Shanghai head office and its nationwide role, but soon had to face the circumstances of the Chinese Civil War and moved together with the government back to Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Chengdu before completing the journey to Taiwan in late 1949. Its archives were lost in the wreckage of the Taiping, which added difficulty to the resumption of its operations in Taiwan. 

===Taiwan (since 1949)===

While the CBC was the island’s central bank from 1949, the Bank of Taiwan, a commercial bank founded in 1897 during Japanese colonial rule, kept issuing banknotes until the CBC assumed that role in 1961. On 8 November 1979, the newly revised Central Bank of China Act was promulgated. The Bank of Taiwan issued the New Taiwan dollar until 2000 when the Central Bank of China finally took over the task. In 2007 the English name of the Central Bank of China was renamed the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) along with a host of other renamings under the Chen Shui-bian administration of state-owned corporations with &quot;China&quot; in their name, such as the Chunghwa Post.

<doc id="336685" wikidata="Q1400154" url="?curid=336685" title="Federated Malay States">
<text>The Federated Malay States (FMS, , Jawi: ) was a federation of four protected states in the Malay Peninsula — Selangor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang — established in 1895 by the British government, and which lasted until 1946. In that year they formed the Malayan Union together with two of the former Straits Settlements, (Malacca and Penang), and the Unfederated Malay States. Two years later, the union became the Federation of Malaya, which achieved independence in 1957, and finally Malaysia in 1963 with the inclusion of North Borneo (present-day Sabah), Sarawak and Singapore.

Real power in the FMS and its constituent states rested with the four local British Residents and the Resident-General, the discretionary powers of the local rulers being essentially reduced to matters &quot;touching Malay Religion and Customs&quot;.

The federation, along with the Unfederated Malay States of the peninsula and the Straits Settlements, was overrun and occupied by the Japanese during World War II. After the liberation of Malaya following the Japanese surrender, the federation was not restored, but the federal form of government was retained as the principal model for consolidating the separate states as an independent Federation of Malaya and the federation&#x27;s later evolution into Malaysia.

==Formation and power structure==

On 20 January 1874, Sir Andrew Clarke, governor of the Straits Settlements, concluded with the Sultan of Perak the treaty of Pangkor whereby the Sultan agreed to &quot;receive and provide a suitable residence for a British Officer to be called Resident, who shall be accredited to his court, and whose advice must be asked and acted upon on all questions other than those touching Malay Religion and Customs&quot;. The residency system was extended the same year to Selangor and Negri Sembilan, and in 1888 to Pahang.

To promote greater administrative efficiency, these four states were brought together in 1895/1896 to form the Federated Malay States. This structure was highly centralized, with real power resting in the hands of the agents of the British Government, at first called the Resident-General, and later the Chief Secretary.

The British established the Federal Council in 1898 to administer the federation. It was headed by the High Commissioner (The Governor of the Straits Settlement), assisted by the Resident-General, the rulers, the four state Residents and four nominated unofficial members. This structure remained until the Japanese invaded Malaya on 8 December 1941.

==The sultans and first durbar==
Although the Resident-General was the real administrator of the federation, each of the four constituent states of the federation retained their respective hereditary rulers. At the formation of the Federated Malay States, the reigning rulers were:

# Sultan Alaiddin Sulaiman Shah of Selangor
# Sultan Idris Murshidul ‘Adzam Shah I of Perak
# Yamtuan Tuanku Muhammad Shah of Negeri Sembilan
# Sultan Ahmad Mu’adzam Shah of Pahang

In 1897 the first durbar was convened in the royal town of Kuala Kangsar, Perak as the platform for discussions for the four rulers. This formed the basis for the Conference of Rulers that was created later on under Article 38 of the Malaysian Constitution on 27 August 1957.

==Flag and emblem of the Federation==

=== Flag ===

The flag of the Federated Malay States consisted of four different-coloured stripes, from top to bottom: white, red, yellow and black. Different combinations of these colours represent the four states that formed the FMS — red, black and yellow are for Negeri Sembilan; black and white for Pahang; black, white and yellow for Perak; and red and yellow for Selangor. The same design concept is used in Malaysia&#x27;s national emblem. In the middle is an oblong circle with a Malayan tiger in it.

The National History Museum located near the Dataran Merdeka in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia has a replica of the federation&#x27;s flag.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms of the Federated Malay States featured a shield guarded by two tigers. On the top of the shield is the crown (known as &quot;Eastern Crown&quot; in English heraldry), symbolising the federation of monarchies under the protection of the United Kingdom. A banner with the phrase &quot;Dipelihara Allah&quot; (Under God&#x27;s Protection) written in Jawi is located underneath the shield.

The combinations of the four colours of the shield represents the colours of the flags of the states of the FMS in the same way the stripes of the FMS flag do.

* Red and yellow for Selangor
* Black, white and yellow for Perak
* Red, black and yellow for Negeri Sembilan
* Black and white for Pahang

This design forms the basis of the Federation of Malaya&#x27;s national emblem along with the guardian tigers and a quartered shield of the same, symbolic four colours mentioned above.

The phrase &quot;Dipelihara Allah&quot; was also adopted as the current state motto for Selangor.

===Naval Ensign===

In addition to a state flag, the Federated Malay States also had a naval jack or ensign for use on government ships. The ensign, with the four colours of the FMS, was flown by HMS &quot;Malaya&quot;, commanded by Captain Boyle under the 5th Battle Squadron of the British Grand Fleet) during the Battle of Jutland in the North Sea. This was the only full-scale clash of battleships during World War I.

==Government==

=== Resident-General ===
From 1896 to 1936, real power lay in the hands of the Resident-General, later known as Chief Secretary of the Federation.


=== Chief Secretary to the Government ===

=== Federal Secretaries ===
After 1936 the Federal Secretaries were no more than co-ordinating officers, under the authority of the High Commissioners, which are always the Governors of the Straits Settlements


=== State Council ===
In the Federated Malay States, the individual state were still ruled by rulers (a yamtuan in Negeri Sembilan and sultans elsewhere) but was now advised by the State Council for the purpose of administrating the state. The State Council was made up of the Resident (or in certain cases by the Secretary to the Resident), native chiefs, and representative(s) of the Chinese community nominated by the Sultan. The council discussed matters of interest for each respective state such as legislative and administrative issues as well as revision of all sentence of capital punishment. The Resident and his staff (mostly consist of European and Malay) carried on with the administrative work.

==Economy==

The Federated Malay States initially used the Straits dollar issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency for the Straits Settlements. As the currency depreciated over time, it was pegged at two shillings four sterling pence in 1906. In 1939, the British government introduced a new currency, the Malayan dollar (&quot;ringgit&quot; in Malay) for used in Malaya and Brunei replacing the Straits dollar at par value. It had denominations ranging from 1 cent to 1,000 Malayan dollars.

The Federated Malay States main economic activities were agriculture and mining with emphasis on rubber and tin. The FMS and Malaya as a whole was the main supplier of these two commodities for British industrial needs. Rubber plantations were established in all four states and tin was mined primarily in the Klang valley in Selangor and the Kinta Valley in Perak. This labour-intensive economic activities prompted the British to bring in immigrant workers from southern India to work at the plantations and workers from southern China to mine the tin.

The economic condition in the period can be viewed as self-sustainable, as the income of the federation was more than what was expended in terms of maintaining the administration and economic activities. In the later period, many resources were put into the development of Kuala Lumpur, as the capital of the federation. This period also saw rapid growth in terms of communications infrastructure such as interstate roads, the expansion of the Federated Malay States Railways&#x27; narrow-gauge railway line between the Padang Besar and Singapore, and Port Swettenham (present-day Port Klang). Public schools and academic institutions were also opened along with an improvement in public health. An area in the city was also gazetted as a settlement for the Malay called Kampung Baru. Public buildings were also constructed such as the Kuala Lumpur railway station, the Government Offices of the FMS and Masjid Jamek.

The table and section below illustrated the economic growth of the federation and its member states.

===Selangor===
The revenue of Selangor in 1875 amounted to $115,656; in 1905 it had increased to $8,857,793. Of this latter sum $3,195,318 was derived from duty on exported tin, $1,972,628 from finance, federal receipts, and $340,360 from land revenue. The trade balance was chiefly derived from the revenue farms, which included the right to collect import duty on opium and spirits. The expenditure for 1905 amounted to $7,186,146, of which sum $3,717,238 was on account of federal charges and $1,850,711 for public works. The value of the imports in 1905 was $24,643,619 and that of the exports was $26,683,316, making a total of $51,326,935 equivalent to £5,988,000. Tin was the principal export. The amount exported in 1905 was 17,254 tons. The total area of alienated mining land at the end of 1905 amounted to .

===Perak===
The revenue of Perak in 1874 amounted to $226,333. That for 1905 amounted to $12,242,897. Of this latter sum $4,876,400 was derived from duty on exported tin, $2,489,300 from railway receipts, $505,300 from land revenue and $142,800 from postal and telegraphic revenue. The remainder is mainly derived from the revenue farms, which are leased for a short term of years, conveying to the lessee the right to collect import duties upon opium, wine and spirits, to keep pawnbroking shops, and to keep public licensed gambling-houses for the use of non-Malay only. The expenditure for 1905 amounted to $10,141,980. Of this sum $4,236,000 was spent on railway upkeep and construction and $2,176,100 on public works. The value of the imports into Perak during 1905 was over $20,000,000, and that of the exports exceeded $40,000,000, making a total of over $60,000,000, equivalent to about seven million sterling. The output of tin from Perak ranged between 18,960 tons, valued at $23,099,506 in 1899, and 26,600 tons, valued at $35,500,000, in 1905. The fluctuating output figure was due to the uncertainty of the labour supply. The mining population was recruited exclusively from the districts of southern China, and during certain years an increased demand for labourers in China itself, in French Indo-China, in the Dutch colonies, and in South Africa temporarily and adversely affected immigration to the Straits of Malacca. The output had, moreover, been affected from time to time by the price of tin, which was $32.20 per pikul in 1896, rose to $42.96 in 1898, to $74.15 in 1900, and averaged $80.60 in 1905. Excluding tin, the principal exports were $108,000 worth of Para rubber, $181,000 of copra, $54,000 of hides, $48,000 of patchouli, and considerable quantities of timber, rattans and other jungle produce.

===Negeri Sembilan===
The revenue of the Negri Sembilan amounted to $223,435 in 1888. In 1898 it had increased to $701,334, in 1900 to $1,251,366, and in 1905 to $2,335,534. The revenue for 1905 was derived mainly as follows: customs $1,268,602, land revenue $145,475, land sales $21,407, while the revenue farms contributed $584,459. The expenditure in 1905 amounted to $2,214,093, of which $1,125,355 was spent on public works. The trade returns for 1905, which are not, however, complete, showed an aggregate value of about $13,000,000. The value of the tin exported during 1905 exceeded $6,900,000, and the value of the agricultural produce, of which gambier represented $211,000 and damar $80,000, amounted to $407,990.

===Pahang===
The revenue of Pahang in 1899 amounted to $62,077; in 1900 to $419,150. In 1905 it was $528,368. The expenditure in 1905 amounted to $1,208,176. Of this sum $736,886 was spent on public works. Pahang is still a source of expense to the federation, its progress having been slowed by the disturbances which lasted from December 1891 until 1895, with short intervals of peace, but the revenue was steadily increasing, and the ultimate financial success of the state is considered to be secure. Pahang owed something over $3,966,500 to Selangor and $1,175,000 to Perak, which had financed it for some years out of surplus revenue. The value of the imports in 1905 was $1,344,346, that of the exports was $3,838,928, thus making a total trade value of $5,183,274. The most valuable export is tin, the value of which in 1905 amounted to $2,820,745. The value of the gutta exported exceeded $140,000, that of dried and salted fish amounted to nearly $70,000, and that of timber to $325,000.

==Military history==

=== World War I ===
With the threat of Germany, the British Navy was in a drive for expansion. As a contribution, the government and people of the Federated Malay States agreed to finance the commissioning of HMS &quot;Malaya&quot;; this was a motion proposed in the Federal Council by the Sultan of Perak in 1913 and supported by the Sultan of Selangor. The battleship which cost $25,000,000 (approximately £2,945,709) was one of five of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class battleship, displacing 31,000 tons, mounting fifteen-inch guns and capable of . The most modern ships of their day, they formed the 5th Battle Squadron and fought as such at Jutland in 1916. HMS &quot;Malaya&quot; was also refurbished and was in service throughout World War II.

===WWII – Japanese invasion and dissolution===
After the Japanese landed in Malaya on 8 December 1941, the Japanese forces began their invasion of the Malay Peninsula. Japanese forces began their invasion of the FMS by crossing the Thailand–FMS border at Kroh. Ipoh, the state capital of Perak, fell on 26 December 1941. Kuala Lumpur, the capital of the Federated Malay States and the State of Selangor, was captured on 11 January 1942. Seremban, the state capital of Negeri Sembilan, was captured two days later. Kuantan, in the eastern component state of Pahang, fell on 30 December 1941, meanwhile the capital, Kuala Lipis was taken by the Japanese on 7 January 1942. With the conclusion of the Battle of Gemas on 15 January 1942, the entire FMS was now in Japanese hands.

All of Malaya including Singapore remained under Japanese occupation until the surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945.

==Dissolution==
The federation was formally dissolved on 1 April 1946, and was incorporated into the Malayan Union thereafter. This in turn was succeeded by the Federation of Malaya in 1948, which gained independence in 1957, and later became Malaysia in 1963.

==Postage stamps==

While the four states issued their own postage stamps as before, there were additional issues for the Federated States as a whole.

<text>The grey wagtail (Motacilla cinerea) is a member of the wagtail family, Motacillidae, measuring around 18–19 cm overall length. The species looks somewhat similar to the yellow wagtail but has the yellow on its underside restricted to the throat and vent. Breeding males have a black throat. The species is widely distributed, with several populations breeding in Eurosiberia and migrating to tropical regions in Asia and Africa. The species is always associated with running water when breeding, although they may use man-made structures near streams for the nest. Outside the breeding season, they may also be seen around lakes, coasts and other watery habitats. Like other wagtails, they frequently wag their tail and fly low with undulations and they have a sharp call that is often given in flight.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The binomial name of the grey wagtail &quot;Motacilla cinerea&quot; was introduced by Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 publication &quot;Ornithologia Britannica&quot;. &quot;Motacilla&quot; is the Latin name for the pied wagtail; although actually a diminutive of &quot;motare&quot;, &quot;to move about&quot;, from medieval times it led to the misunderstanding of &quot;cilla&quot; as &quot;tail&quot;. The specific &quot;cinerea&quot; is Latin for &quot;ash-grey&quot; from &quot;cinis&quot;, &quot;ashes&quot;.

The relationships of this species are not well resolved; it belongs to the non-African clade of wagtails, these are confusing in their external morphology, and mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data are not able to robustly resolve their relationships. While the present species is probably most closely related to citrine wagtails and some blue-headed wagtails, the exact nature of this relationship is unclear.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;M. c. patriciae&quot; Vaurie, 1957 – Azores
* &quot;M. c. schmitzi&quot; Tschusi, 1900 – Madeira
* &quot;M. c. cinerea&quot; Tunstall, 1771 – west Europe, Canary Islands and northwest Africa to central, east, northeast Asia

==Description==
This slim wagtail has a narrow white supercilium and a broken eye ring. The upperparts are grey and the yellow vent contrasting with whitish underparts makes it distinctive. The breeding male has a black throat that is edged by whitish moustachial stripes. They forage singly or in pairs on meadows or on shallow water marshes. They also use rocks in water and will often perch on trees. They have a clear sharp call note and the song consists of trills.

==Distribution and habitat==
The bird is widely distributed across the Palearctic region with several well marked populations. The nominate form (includes &quot;caspica&quot; of Iran, Turkey and the Caucasus) is from western Europe including the British Isles, Scandinavia and Mediterranean region. Race &quot;melanope&quot;, which is not well separated from the nominate subspecies, is described as the population breeding in eastern Europe and central Asia mainly along the mountain chains of the Urals, Tien Shan and along the Himalayas. They winter in Africa and Asia. Race &quot;robusta&quot; breeds along the northeastern parts of Asia in Siberia extending to Korea and Japan. These winter in Southeast Asia. Island forms include &quot;patriciae&quot; of the Azores, &quot;schmitzi&quot; of Madeira and &quot;canariensis&quot; of the Canary Islands.

They sometimes occur on the islands to the West of Alaska but have been known to occur further south in California as a vagrant.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The breeding season is April to July and the nest is placed near fast running streams or rivers on an embankment between stones and roots. The male in display, makes short flights up into the air and descends slowly with fluttering flight accompanied by a rapid series of chipping high notes. In Europe the nests are often made in holes in manmade structures. The clutch consists of 3–6 speckled eggs and multiple broods may be raised with declining numbers in the clutch in subsequent broods. The usual clutch size is five in Ireland and the breeding success is about 80% with predation of eggs or chicks being the main cause of breeding failure. The Canary Islands population typically have smaller clutches and the breeding season is not as short and well marked as in populations at higher latitudes. The incubation period is about two weeks with chicks fledging within a fortnight. They live for a maximum of 8 years in the wild.
In some parts of its range the white-throated dipper nests in the same habitats as the grey wagtail and there are some records of interspecific feeding of dipper chicks by adult wagtails.

These birds feed on a variety of aquatic invertebrates including adult flies, mayflies, beetles, crustacea and molluscs. They often forage along roadsides in winter, flushing with a sharp &quot;chi-cheep&quot; call and flying up further along the road but after some distance turning back to return to the original location.

In winter, they roost in small groups. Wintering birds have been known to return to the same sites, sometimes a small urban garden, each year.

Adults often have parasitic ticks, &quot;Ixodes ricinus&quot;, which can harbour &quot;Borrelia&quot; and thus can potentially disperse Lyme disease over a wide region. Coccidia such as &quot;Isospora&quot; sp. are known in this species. The common cuckoo is sometimes a brood parasite of this species, and kestrels may sometimes prey on them.
