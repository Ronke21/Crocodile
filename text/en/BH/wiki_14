<text>The mulga dragon (Diporiphora amphiboluroides) is a species of agamid lizard found in Western Australia. The species is up to 250 mm long, the length from snout to vent is 95 mm, with a long, slender tail that ends abruptly. The patterning over the legs and body is grey and brownish streaks. This provides an excellent camouflage on mulga trees, its usual habitat, it is also found beneath mulga leaf litter. &quot;Diporiphora amphiboluroides&quot; generally remains motionless and unobserved, this allows it to operate as an ambush predator and elude animals that would prey on it.

It resembles another Western Australian species, the western bearded dragon (&quot;Pogona minor&quot;).

<text>Calotes is a genus of lizards in the draconine clade of the family Agamidae. The genus contains 29 species. Some species are known as forest lizards, others as &quot;bloodsuckers&quot; due to their red heads, and yet others (namely &quot;C. versicolor&quot;) as garden lizards. The genus name &quot;Calotes&quot; has been derived from the Greek word &quot;Καλότης (Kalótës)&quot;, meaning ‘beauty’, referring to the beautiful pattern of this genus.

==Geographic range==
Species in the genus &quot;Calotes&quot; are native to South Asia, southern China, mainland Southeast Asia and Ambon. Additionally, &quot;C. versicolor&quot; has been introduced to Florida (USA), Borneo, Sulawesi, the Seychelles, Mauritius and Oman. The greatest species richness of the genus is from the Western Ghats, northeast India, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

==Description==
&quot;Calotes&quot; is distinguished from related genera in having uniform-sized dorsal scales, and lacking a fold of skin extending between the cheek and shoulder, and in having proportionately stronger limbs than &quot;Pseudocalotes&quot;. Compared to &quot;Bronchocela&quot;, &quot;Calotes&quot; have a proportionately shorter tail and limbs. &quot;Calotes&quot; as we know it today was classified by Moody (1980) prior to which all of the above-mentioned genera were included in this genus.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Calotes&quot; is still a heterogeneous group that may be divided into the &quot;C. versicolor&quot; and &quot;C. liocephalus&quot; groups. The former occurs through most of South Asia and further east. All species in this group have their dorsal and lateral scales directed upward. The latter is restricted to the southern Western Ghats and Sri Lanka. All species in this group have their scales directed back, or up and down, or down only. Whether further splitting is necessary or whether the groups constitute subgenera of a monophyletic &quot;Calotes&quot; remains to be studied.

<text>Bernard Roger Tapie (; 26 January 1943 – 3 October 2021) was a French businessman, politician and occasional actor, singer, and TV host. He was Minister of City Affairs in the government of Pierre Bérégovoy.

==Life and career==

Tapie was born in Paris. He was a businessman who specialized in recovering bankrupt companies, among which Adidas is the most famous (he owned Adidas from 1990 to 1993); and owner of sports teams: his cycling team La Vie Claire won the Tour de France twice – in 1985 and 1986 – and his football club Marseille won the French championship four times in a row, and the Champions League in 1993.

La Vie Claire, one of Tapie&#x27;s former businesses, is a chain of health product stores. It sponsored one of the strongest cycling teams of all time, La Vie Claire, which was founded after the 1983 European cycling season, when multiple Tour de France winner Bernard Hinault had acrimoniously broken away from the Renault–Elf–Gitane team. Hinault and Greg LeMond won successive Tours with the La Vie Claire team in 1985 and 1986. From 1986 to 1994, Tapie was the president of the Marseille football club, which became champions of France five times in a row (from 1989 to 1993) and won the 1992–93 UEFA Champions League. 

In 1985, Tapie bought the sailing ship &quot;Club Méditerrannée&quot; from the wife of disappeared French navigator Alain Colas. The boat was transported to Marseille, where Tapie had his football team, and restored for two years. It was renamed &quot;Phocea&quot; and was at that time the longest sailing ship in the world (). Tapie took command of it with a new crew in 1988 and broke the world record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

In 2021, Tapie and his wife were severely beaten in a home invasion robbery.

===Controversies===
In 1993, the same year that Marseille won the Champions League, he was accused of fixing the match between his club and minor club Valenciennes; the motivation seemed to be that he could thus save his best players for important matches and not waste their energy. His club was stripped of its French league championship, although not of the Champions League title, and later suffered a forced relegation to the second division because of this match-fixing suspicion. In 1994, Tapie was under criminal investigation for complicity of corruption and witness tampering. After a high-profile case against public prosecutor Éric de Montgolfier, he was sentenced in 1995 by the Court of Appeals of Douai to two years in prison, including 8 months non-suspended and three years of deprivation of his civic rights.

From 1993 to 2008, there was a long legal battle between Tapie and the state-owned Crédit Lyonnais bank. Crédit Lyonnais had defrauded Tapie in 1993 and 1994 when it sold Adidas on his behalf to Robert Louis-Dreyfus, apparently by arranging a larger sale with Dreyfus without Tapie&#x27;s knowledge. A 600-million-franc (90-million-euro) sum was granted in 1995 by the French justice system, and after an appeal from Crédit Lyonnais the Appeal Court increased the sanction to 150 million Euros in 2005. This ruling was partially dismissed in Cassation. In 2008, a special judicial panel ruled that Tapie should receive compensation of €404 million from the French Ministry of Finance, headed by Christine Lagarde. She decided not to challenge the ruling. On 3 December 2015, a French court ruled that Tapie should return this compensation with interest. A few days later, the Court of Justice of the Republic ordered that Lagarde should stand trial for negligence.

On 19 December 2016, Lagarde was convicted of negligence; however, the conviction was not deemed a criminal record and Lagarde was not sentenced to any punishment. In 2012, the new French government held by the socialists announced they would challenge in courts the Arbitrage sentence ruled in favor of Tapie under the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy. After four years of new trials, the Arbitrage was canceled on the basis of a &quot;suspected fraud&quot; in the nomination and impartiality of one of the three judges who ruled in favor of Tapie. In 2019, a criminal case was conducted against Tapie and the suspected judge concluded there was no fraud and the arbitrage was fully legal. The French authorities, supervised by the French government, appealed this decision. After 26 years of proceedings, this legal battle was still ongoing at the time of Tapie&#x27;s death in 2021.

===Acquisitions===
Tapie made his fortune in the late 1970s and 1980s by acquiring bankrupt companies. The first companies that he purchased were paper companies Duverger and Diguet-Denis. Later came larger companies such as Leclanché Wonder – a large producer of batteries. He later sold this company to Ucar.

In 1990, Tapie purchased Adidas for nearly 1.6 billion francs (equivalent to € million in ). He took up a loan syndicated with a banking pool with a majority of foreign banks (German and Japanese banks for the main part), and in minority from French backers, in particular with the SdBO, the subsidiary of Crédit Lyonnais group hidden for several years.

In 1995, Adidas was listed on the Stock Exchange for a valuation of 11 billion francs, nearly six times the price paid by Robert to Tapie to acquire it. 
He subsequently had a number of legal difficulties associated with the sale of the company, conducted by the French state-owned Crédit Lyonnais, which was subsequently sanctioned for lack of loyalty (by not informing Tapie he could sell the company at a much higher price than Crédit Lyonnais declared) and for breaching the obligation not to buy the company themselves. (Crédit Lyonnais used offshore companies to buy Adidas on their behalf but without declaring it.)

The Tapie group, through Bernard Tapie&#x27;s son Laurent Tapie, who had formed a company in the sports betting company that he sold in 2008, also tried to dabble in the online poker world when Laurent Tapie tried to acquire Full Tilt Poker; however, they were unable to negotiate a deal with the United States Department of Justice, and the deal fell through.

===Media===
In 1995, Tapie turned to artistic endeavors because he was unable to pursue his previous interests: he was personally bankrupt and therefore unable to pursue business ventures, he was declared ineligible to run for political office, and he was banned from football. The first thing he turned to was film. He starred, together with Fabrice Luchini, in Claude Lelouch&#x27;s 1996 movie &quot;Hommes, femmes, mode d&#x27;emploi&quot; (&quot;Men, Women: A User&#x27;s Manual&quot;).

In 1998, Tapie collaborated on a song written by Doc Gynéco, &quot;C&#x27;est beau la vie&quot;. In 2000, he made his debut as a theater actor, receiving great reviews from French critics for his re-enactment of Jack Nicholson&#x27;s role of Randle McMurphy in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;. In 2001, a documentary titled &quot;Who is Bernard Tapie?&quot; was produced by American filmmaker Marina Zenovich.

From 2001 to 2005, Tapie acted in theater plays and appeared in the French TV series &quot;Valence&quot; as a police chief. In 2018, Tapie was diagnosed with double cancer (stomach and esophagus). He was later treated in France and in Belgium, partially with experimental treatments. In 2023, Netflix released the biographical limited series &quot;Class Act&quot;.

== Death ==
In the morning of 3 October 2021, his family announced that he had died at the age of 78. Tapie had been suffering from stomach cancer for several years. President Emmanuel Macron, a lifelong supporter of Marseille, expressed his condolences to Tapie&#x27;s family in a statement, saying he and his wife &quot;have been touched by the news of the death of Bernard Tapie, whose ambition, energy and enthusiasm were a source of inspiration for generations of French people&quot;. Marseille said in a statement: &quot;Olympique de Marseille learned with deep sadness of the passing of Bernard Tapie. He will leave a great void in the hearts of the Marseillais and will forever remain in the legend of the club.&quot;

<text>Margaret Anne Ewing (&quot;née&quot; McAdam, formerly Bain; 1 September 1945 – 21 March 2006) was a Scottish politician and journalist. She served as a Scottish National Party (SNP) Member of Parliament for East Dunbartonshire from 1974 to 1979 and Moray from 1987 to 2001, and was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Moray from 1999 until 2006.

Ewing was Deputy Leader of the Scottish National Party from 1984 to 1987 and leader of the SNP parliamentary group in the House of Commons from 1987 to 1999. She was a candidate for the SNP leadership in 1990.

==Early life and career==
Ewing was born Margaret Anne McAdam in Lanark, the daughter of John McAdam, a farm labourer. She was educated at Biggar High School. At the age of twelve she was diagnosed with tuberculosis with a thirteen-month stay in hospital on account of this. She went on to study at the University of Glasgow, graduating with an MA degree in English language and literature.

She was an English teacher at St Modan&#x27;s High School in Stirling from 1970 to 1973, before serving as principal teacher of remedial education from 1973 to 1974.

==Political career==
Ewing joined the Scottish National Party as a student in 1966 and was president of the student group at the university. She was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for East Dunbartonshire at the October 1974 election, by just 22 votes, when she was known as Margaret Bain; she had failed to win the seat at the previous election in February. In 1976 during a devolution debate she told the House of Commons that she identified as a Scot, a European and &quot;a citizen of the world&quot;, but did not &quot;feel British&quot; and had &quot;never identified... as British&quot;. At one point she burst into tears in the House of Commons when a devolution proposal was defeated. With the downturn in SNP electoral fortunes at the 1979 Election she lost her seat in the House of Commons. After working for a period as an administrator in social services in Glasgow, she unsuccessfully contested the Strathkelvin and Bearsden constituency at the 1983 Election.

Ewing then worked as a freelance journalist. Now known as Margaret Ewing, she was selected by the SNP as their candidate for Moray at the 1987 election. She was re-elected to Westminster and again in 1992 and 1997, holding this seat until standing down at the 2001 general election to concentrate on Holyrood. She stood for the leadership of the SNP in 1990 but lost out to Alex Salmond despite the backing of many prominent SNP members (such as Jim Sillars). Ewing had become leader of the SNP&#x27;s parliamentary group after the 1987 election. The leadership vacancy was caused by the fact that the SNP Chairman Gordon Wilson had lost his seat at Dundee Dundee East and previous group leader Donald Stewart had retired from parliament. While the three SNP MPs elected in 1987 had not been members of the previous parliament, both Ewing and Andrew Welsh had served in parliament in the past. A post-election meeting held at Perth between Ewing, Welsh, Salmond (newly elected as MP for Banff and Buchan) and Wilson led to Ewing&#x27;s appointment with Welsh becoming the group&#x27;s chief whip.

In 1999, at the first Scottish Parliament election she was returned to represent Moray. She was returned again in 2003.

In August 2005, Ewing had announced that she was not seeking re-election at the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections. The SNP comfortably retained her vacant seat at the by-election which took place on 27 April 2006.

==Death==
Ewing died from breast cancer, aged 60, on 21 March 2006.

==Family==
She was married twice: firstly to Donald Bain, a SNP research officer in 1968 (divorced 1980), and secondly to Fergus Ewing in 1983, who is the son of Winnie Ewing and who also became a Member of the Scottish Parliament. Her sister-in-law Annabelle Ewing is also an SNP politician.

<text>Chelosania is a genus of agamid lizards that contains a single species, Chelosania brunnea. These are commonly known as the chameleon dragon. They live in the northern parts of West Australia, the Northern Territory, and northwestern Queensland.

&quot;Chelosania&quot; has short limbs with a laterally compressed body, and small eye apertures and large ear openings. They have an average snout to vent length of 11.8 cm, and average total length of 30 cm.

&quot;Chelosania&quot; is usually seen on the ground or in low level vegetation, and is slow moving. Females lay eggs in burrows between July and August, with up to 8 eggs recorded. &quot;Chelosania&quot; eats ants, and has been recorded eating green ants.

Genetic analysis shows that &quot;Chelosania&quot;, along with the thorny devil, is a significantly older species than more recent desert agamids.

<text>Coryphophylax is an agamid genus endemic to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and a sister of the Southeast Asian &quot;Aphaniotis&quot;. Found in tropical wet forests, they are common in suitable habitats and shows variations across islands and are sexually dimorphic. The genus is absent on Great Nicobar Island, with its southernmost occurrence on the island of Kondul. The tsunami of December 2004 may have affected island-wide distributions in the Nicobar Islands of several species and also their gene-flow.

==Taxonomic history==
The species from the Andaman Islands was described by Edward Blyth as &quot;Tiaris subcristata&quot; in 1860 but technically published in 1861. This species was described by Fitzinger in Steindachner&#x27;s publication of 1867 and as &quot;Tiaris humei&quot; by Stoliczka in 1873 and these names are considered junior synonyms but placed in the genus erected by Fitzinger. The closely related genus &quot;Aphaniotis&quot; (and the more distant &quot;Otocryptis&quot;) has a concealed tympanum while &quot;Gonocephalus&quot; has spines on the head or nape.

<text>The term formalism describes an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the arts, literature, or philosophy. A practitioner of formalism is called a formalist. A formalist, with respect to some discipline, holds that there is no transcendent meaning to that discipline other than the literal content created by a practitioner. For example, formalists within mathematics claim that mathematics is no more than the symbols written down by the mathematician, which is based on logic and a few elementary rules alone. This is as opposed to non-formalists, within that field, who hold that there are some things inherently true, and are not, necessarily, dependent on the symbols within mathematics so much as a greater truth. Formalists within a discipline are completely concerned with &quot;the rules of the game,&quot; as there is no other external truth that can be achieved beyond those given rules. In this sense, formalism lends itself well to disciplines based upon axiomatic systems.

==Religion==

Formalism in religion means an emphasis on ritual and observance over their meanings. Within Christianity, the term legalism is a derogatory term that is loosely synonymous to religious formalism.

==Law==

Formalism is a school of thought in law and jurisprudence which assumes that the law is a system of rules that can determine the outcome of any case, without reference to external norms. For example, formalism animates the commonly heard criticism that &quot;judges should apply the law, not make it.&quot; To formalism&#x27;s rival, legal realism, this criticism is incoherent, because legal realism assumes that, at least in difficult cases, all applications of the law will require that a judge refer to external (i.e. non-legal) sources, such as the judge&#x27;s conception of justice, or commercial norms.

==Criticism==
In general in the study of the arts and literature, &quot;formalism&quot; refers to the style of criticism that focuses on artistic or literary techniques in themselves, in separation from the work&#x27;s social and historical context. 

===Art criticism===
Generally speaking, formalism is the concept which everything necessary in a work of art is contained within it. The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, is not considered to be significant. Examples of formalist aestheticians are Clive Bell, Jerome Stolnitz, and Edward Bullough.

===Literary criticism===
In contemporary discussions of literary theory, the school of criticism of I. A. Richards and his followers, traditionally the New Criticism, has sometimes been labelled &#x27;formalist&#x27;. The formalist approach, in this sense, is a continuation of aspects of classical rhetoric. 

Russian formalism was a twentieth century school, based in Eastern Europe, with roots in linguistic studies and also theorising on fairy tales, in which content is taken as secondary since the tale &#x27;is&#x27; the form, the princess &#x27;is&#x27; the fairy-tale princess.

==The arts==
===Poetry===
In modern poetry, &quot;Formalist poets&quot; may be considered as the opposite of writers of free verse. These are only labels, and rarely sum up matters satisfactorily. &#x27;Formalism&#x27; in poetry represents an attachment to poetry that recognises and uses schemes of rhyme and rhythm to create poetic effects and to innovate. To distinguish it from archaic poetry the term &#x27;neo-formalist&#x27; is sometimes used.

See for example:
*&quot;The Formalist&quot;, a literary magazine (now defunct) for formalist poetry
*New Formalism, a movement within the poetry of the United States
*&quot;The New Formalist&quot;, a literary magazine for formalist poetry. It was published from 2001 to 2010.

===Film===

In film studies, formalism is a trait in filmmaking, which overtly uses the language of film, such as editing, shot composition, camera movement, set design, etc., so as to emphasise graphical (as opposed to diegetic) qualities of the image. Strict formalism, condemned by realist film theorists such as André Bazin, has declined substantially in popular usage since the 1950s, though some more postmodern filmmakers reference it to suggest the artificiality of the film experience. 

Examples of formalist films may include Resnais&#x27;s &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; and Parajanov&#x27;s &quot;The Color of Pomegranates&quot;.

==Intellectual method==
Formalism can be applied to a set of notations and rules for manipulating them which yield results in agreement with experiment or other techniques of calculation. These rules and notations may or may not have a corresponding mathematical semantics. In the case no mathematical semantics exists, the calculations are often said to be &quot;purely formal&quot;. See for example scientific formalism.

==Mathematics==
In the foundations of mathematics, formalism is associated with a certain rigorous mathematical method: see formal system. In common usage, &quot;a&quot; formalism means the out-turn of the effort towards formalisation of a given limited area. In other words, matters can be formally discussed once captured in a formal system, or commonly enough within something &quot;formalisable&quot; with claims to be one. Complete formalisation is in the domain of computer science.

Formalism also more precisely refers to a certain school in the philosophy of mathematics, stressing axiomatic proofs through theorems, specifically associated with David Hilbert. In the philosophy of mathematics, therefore, a formalist is a person who belongs to the school of formalism, which is a certain mathematical-philosophical doctrine descending from Hilbert.

==Anthropology==
In economic anthropology, formalism is the theoretical perspective that the principles of neoclassical economics can be applied to our understanding of all human societies.

<doc id="324868" wikidata="Q2464716" url="?curid=324868" title="Cliveden">
<text>Cliveden (pronounced ) is an English country house and estate in the care of the National Trust in Buckinghamshire, on the border with Berkshire. The Italianate mansion, also known as Cliveden House, crowns an outlying ridge of the Chiltern Hills close to the South Bucks villages of Burnham and Taplow. The main house sits above the banks of the River Thames, and its grounds slope down to the river. There have been three houses on this site: the first, built in 1666, burned down in 1795 and the second house (1824) was also destroyed by fire, in 1849. The present Grade I listed house was built in 1851 by the architect Charles Barry for the 2nd Duke of Sutherland.

Cliveden has been the home to a Prince of Wales, two dukes, an earl, and finally the Viscounts Astor. As the home of Nancy Astor, wife of the 2nd Viscount Astor, Cliveden was the meeting place of the Cliveden Set of the 1920s and 1930s—a group of political intellectuals. Later, during the early 1960s, when it was the home of the 3rd Viscount Astor, it became the setting for key events of the notorious Profumo affair. After the Astor family stopped living there, by the 1970s, it was leased to Stanford University, which used it as an overseas campus. Today the house is leased to a company that runs it as a five-star hotel.

The gardens and woodlands are open to the public, together with parts of the house on certain days. Cliveden was one of the National Trust&#x27;s most popular pay-for-entry visitor attractions, hosting 524,807 visitors in 2019.
== Etymology ==
Cliveden means &quot;valley among cliffs&quot; and refers to the &quot;dene&quot; (valley) which cuts through part of the estate, east of the house. Cliveden has been spelled differently over the centuries, some of the variations being &quot;Cliffden&quot;, &quot;Clifden&quot;, &quot;Cliefden&quot;, and &quot;Clyveden&quot;.:10

==Present house==

Designed by Charles Barry in 1851 to replace a house previously destroyed by fire, the present house is a blend of the English Palladian style and the Roman Cinquecento.:29 The Victorian three-storey mansion sits on a long, high brick terrace or viewing platform (visible only from the south side) which dates from the mid-17th century. The exterior of the house is rendered in Roman cement, with terracotta additions such as balusters, capitals, keystones, and finials. The roof of the mansion is meant for walking on, and there is a circular view, above the tree-line, of parts of Buckinghamshire and Berkshire including Windsor Castle to the south.:206

Below the balustraded roofline is a Latin inscription which continues around the four sides of the house and recalls its history; it was composed by the then prime minister William Ewart Gladstone. On the west front, it reads: &quot;POSITA INGENIO OPERA CONSILIO CAROLI BARRY ARCHIT A MDCCCLI&quot;, which translated reads: &quot;The work accomplished by the brilliant plan of architect Charles Barry in 1851.&quot; The main contractor for the work was Lucas Brothers.

In 1984–86 the exterior of the mansion was overhauled and a new lead roof installed by the National Trust, while interior repairs were carried out by Cliveden Hotel. In 2013, further exterior work was carried out including the restoration of 300 sash windows and 20 timber doors.

===Interior===

The interior of the house today is very different from its original appearance in 1851–52. This is mainly due to the 1st Lord Astor, who radically altered the interior layout and decoration c.1894–95. Whereas Barry&#x27;s original interior for the Sutherlands had included a square entrance-hall, a morning room, and a separate stairwell, Lord Astor wanted a more impressive entrance to Cliveden so he had all three rooms amalgamated to create the Great Hall.:134

Astor&#x27;s aim was for the interior to resemble an Italian palazzo, thus complementing the exterior. The ceiling and walls were panelled in English oak, with Corinthian columns and swags of carved flowers for decoration, all by architect Frank Pearson. The staircase newel posts are ornamented with carved figures representing previous owners (e.g. Buckingham and Orkney) by W.S. Frith.

Astor installed a large 16th-century fireplace that was purchased from the Frederick Spitzer Sale (lot 1273) in June 1893. To the left of the fireplace is a portrait of Nancy, Lady Astor by the American portraitist John Singer Sargent. The room was and still is furnished with 18th-century tapestries and suits of armour.

Originally the floor was covered with Minton encaustic tiles (given to the Sutherlands by the factory) but Nancy Astor had them removed in 1906 and the present flagstones laid. Above the staircase is a painted ceiling by French artist Auguste Hervieu which depicts the Sutherlands&#x27; children painted as the four seasons, and is the only surviving element of Barry&#x27;s 1851–52 interior.
The French Dining Room is so-called because the 18th-century Rococo panelling (or boiseries) came from the Château d&#x27;Asnières near Paris, a château which was leased to Louis XV and his mistress Madame de Pompadour as a hunting lodge. The panelling was sold in 1897 by Jules Allard to the 1st Lord Astor, who had it installed at Cliveden. The gilded panelling on a turquoise ground contains carvings of hares, pheasants, hunting dogs and rifles. The console tables and buffet were made in 1900 to match the room.

The second largest room on the ground floor, after the Great Hall, was the original drawing room, which is used as the hotel&#x27;s main dining room.

Also on the ground floor is the library, panelled in cedar wood, which the Astors used to call the &quot;cigar box&quot;,:181 and, next door, Nancy Astor&#x27;s boudoir, which is used by the hotel as a meeting room.

Upstairs there are a total of 10-bedroom suites divided equally over two floors. The East wing was and still is guest accommodation, whereas the West wing was domestic offices that were converted into more bedrooms in 1994.

===Clock Tower===
The nearby 100-foot (30 m) clock tower was added in 1861 and is the work of the architect Henry Clutton. As a functioning water tower it still provides water for the house today. It is rendered in Roman cement like the rest of the house and features four clock faces framed by gilded surrounds and a half-open staircase on its north side. It was described by the architectural critic Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;the epitome of Victorian flamboyance and assertiveness.&quot;

The tower is topped with a modern reproduction of Augustin Dumont&#x27;s 19th-century winged male figure &quot;Le Génie de la Liberté&quot; (the Spirit of Liberty). The original is atop the July Column in the Place de la Bastille, Paris. This replaces two earlier versions, the first having fallen from the tower during a storm in the 1950s. The new statue is made of bronze and was created using Dumont&#x27;s original mould from the 1860s found in a museum in Semur-en-Auxois, France. It measures 2.2 m in height, is covered in two layers of 23.5 carat gold leaf and cost a total of £68,000. It is an allegorical sculpture which holds the torch of civilization in its right hand and the broken chain of slavery in its left. It was affixed to the tower in the spring of 2012.

==History==

=== Duke of Buckingham and early history ===

Cliveden stands on the site of a house built in 1666 designed by architect William Winde as the home of George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. But before Buckingham&#x27;s purchase the land was owned by the Mansfield family and before that to the de Clyveden family.:10

The details are recorded in a document compiled by William Waldorf Astor in 1894 called &quot;The Historical Descent of Cliveden&quot;. Derived from several historical sources including George Lipscombe&#x27;s &quot;History of the County of Buckingham,&quot; the Lysons brothers &quot;Magna Britannia,&quot; and James Joseph Sheahan&#x27;s &quot;History of Buckinghamshire,&quot; it shows that in 1237 the land was owned by Geoffrey de Clyveden and by 1300 it had passed to his son, William, who owned fisheries and mills along the Cliveden Reach stretch of the Thames and at nearby Hedsor.
In 1569 a lodge existed on the site along with of land and was owned by Sir Henry Manfield; it was later owned by his son, Sir Edward. In 1573, there were two lodges on of treeless chalk escarpment above the Thames. It was on this impressively high but exposed site that Buckingham chose to build the first Cliveden house.:2

Buckingham pulled down the earlier buildings and chose William Winde as his architect. Winde designed a four-storey house above an arcaded terrace. Today the terrace is the only feature of Buckingham&#x27;s house to survive the 1795 fire. Although the Duke&#x27;s intention was to use Cliveden as a &quot;hunting box&quot;, it later housed Anna Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury. In 1668 a duel between the Duke and his mistress&#x27;s husband Lord Shrewsbury took place at Barn Elms near London and resulted in Shrewsbury dying of his wounds. A contemporary account of Buckingham&#x27;s affair with Anna was written about by Samuel Pepys, in his diary of the period.

John Evelyn, another contemporary diarist, visited the Duke at Cliveden on 22 July 1679 and recorded the following impression in his Diary:
===18th century===

====1st Earl of Orkney====
After Buckingham died in 1687, the house remained empty until the estate was purchased in 1696 by George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney, a soldier and colonial official.:2–3 The Earl employed the architect Thomas Archer to add two new &quot;wings&quot; to the house, connected by curved corridors. Although an almost identical arrangement exists today, these are later reconstructions, the originals having been destroyed in the fire of 1795. All that remains of Archer&#x27;s work inside the house today is a staircase in the West wing.

Orkney&#x27;s contributions to the gardens can still be seen today, most notably the Octagon Temple and the Blenheim Pavilion, both designed by the Venetian architect Giacomo Leoni.:15 The landscape designer Charles Bridgeman was also commissioned to devise woodland walks and carve a rustic turf amphitheatre out of the cliff-side.:12

====Countesses of Orkney====
Orkney died in 1737, and Cliveden passed to his daughter Anne O&#x27;Brien, 2nd Countess of Orkney in her own right. She immediately leased it to Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of George II and father of George III. After Frederick fell out with his father, Kew and Cliveden became his refuge from life at the royal court, becoming family homes for his wife Augusta and their children. During the Prince&#x27;s tenure of the house, on 1 August 1740, &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; (an aria by the English composer Thomas Arne with lyrics by Scottish poet James Thomson) was first performed in public in the cliff-side amphitheatre at Cliveden. It was played as part of the masque &quot;Alfred&quot; to celebrate the third birthday of the Prince&#x27;s daughter Augusta.

Cliveden was also the location for the final illness of the Prince: it was believed that while playing cricket in the grounds at Cliveden in 1751 the Prince received a blow to the chest from a batted ball and that this had caused an infection which proved fatal; however, an alternative interpretation shows he died from a cold, followed by a pulmonary embolism. After his death, Frederick&#x27;s family retained Kew and their townhouse, Leicester House, but gave up their lease on Cliveden. Anne and her family moved back into the house, passing it to her daughter, Mary O&#x27;Brien, 3rd Countess of Orkney and granddaughter, Mary FitzMaurice, 4th Countess of Orkney, who also lived there. On the night of 20 May 1795, the house caught fire and burned down. The cause of the fire was thought to have been a servant knocking over a candle. The 4th Countess moved out after the fire but retained the site, only selling it in 1824.

===19th century===

====Sir George Warrender====
After the fire of 1795 the house remained a ruin for the first quarter of the 19th century. In 1824, the estate was purchased by Sir George Warrender, 4th Baronet. To rebuild Cliveden, Warrender selected William Burn, a Scottish architect, and decided on a design for a two-storey mansion with entertaining on a grand scale in mind.:2

====2nd Duke of Sutherland====

Warrender died in 1849 and the house was sold to the Sutherland family, headed by the second Duke. Sutherland had been in possession of the estate for only a few months when the house burned down for the second time in its history. The cause this time appears to have been negligence on the part of the decorators.

The Duke was prompt in commissioning the architect Charles Barry to rebuild Cliveden in the style of an Italianate villa.:3 Barry, whose most famous project is arguably the Houses of Parliament, Westminster, was inspired by the outline of the two earlier houses for his design. The third (and present) house on the site was completed in 1851–52, and its exterior appearance has little changed since then.

The -tall clock tower, which is actually a water tower (still working to this day) was added in 1861 by the architect Henry Clutton.:20-21 During this period other additions were made to the estate, which included half-timbered cottages, a dairy, and a boathouse. Also around this time another architect, George Devey, was commissioned to build half-timbered cottages on the estate along with a dairy and boathouse.:28–29

After the Duke&#x27;s death in 1861 his widow Harriet continued to live at the house for part of the year until her death in 1868, after which it was sold to her son-in-law Hugh Lupus, Earl Grosvenor, later 1st Duke of Westminster.

====1st Duke of Westminster====
Westminster was one of the wealthiest Englishmen of the period. During his ownership of the estate (1868–93), he contributed significant additions to the house and gardens, including the &quot;porte cochère&quot; on the north front of the mansion, a new stable block and the dovecote, all designed by Henry Clutton.

===20th and 21st century===

====Astor era====

In 1893 the estate was purchased by an American millionaire, William Waldorf Astor (later 1st Viscount Astor), who made sweeping alterations to the gardens and the interior of the house.:3 However, after the early death of his wife, he lived a reclusive life at Cliveden. He gave the house to his son Waldorf (later 2nd Viscount Astor) on the occasion of his marriage to Nancy Langhorne in 1906 and moved to Hever Castle.

The young Astors used Cliveden for entertaining on a lavish scale. The combination of the house, its setting, and leisure facilities offered on the estate – boating on the Thames, horse riding, tennis, swimming, croquet and fishing – made Cliveden a destination for film stars, politicians, world leaders, writers and artists. The heyday of entertaining at Cliveden was between the two World Wars when the Astors held regular weekend house parties. Guests at the time included: Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill, Joseph Kennedy, George Bernard Shaw, Mahatma Gandhi, Amy Johnson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, H. H. Asquith, T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia), Arthur Balfour and the writers Henry James, Rudyard Kipling, and Edith Wharton.:213

During the inter-war period the entertainer Joyce Grenfell, who was Nancy Astor&#x27;s niece, lived in a cottage on the estate. In the preface to her memoir, James Roose-Evans stated that during the Second World War, Grenfell ran two wards of the hospital and worked as an informal welfare officer. This work included completing errands for patients, writing letters, shopping, teaching needlework, and organising social events, and informal concerts.

====Canadian Red Cross Memorial Hospital====

At the outbreak of World War I, Waldorf Astor offered the use of some of the grounds to the Canadian Red Cross for the building of a hospital—the HRH Duchess of Connaught Hospital—which was dismantled at the end of the hostilities. In September 1939 with the outbreak of World War II Waldorf Astor again offered the use of the land at a rent of one shilling per year to the Canadian Red Cross and the Canadian Red Cross Memorial Hospital was built to the designs of Robert Atkinson. After the war the hospital&#x27;s main focus was as a nursing school, a maternity unit and a rheumatology unit.

The hospital closed and was abandoned in 1985. It lay derelict for two decades and was demolished in 2006 to make way for a housing development for people aged 55 and over.

Attached to the military hospital and within the grounds was established Cliveden War Cemetery. There are 42 Commonwealth war graves, 40 from World War I (mostly Canadians) and two from World War II, besides two American service war graves from the first war.

==== National Trust ownership ====
In 1942 the Astors gave Cliveden to the National Trust with the proviso that the family could continue to live in the house for as long as they wished. Should they cease to do so, they expressed the wish that the house be used &quot;for promoting friendship and understanding between the peoples of the United States and Canada and the other dominions.&quot; With the gift of Cliveden, the National Trust also received from the Astor family one of their largest endowments: £250,000 in 1942, .

After the death of the 2nd Viscount in 1952, his son William (Bill) Astor, the 3rd Viscount Astor took over the house until his death in 1966. Following the death of Bill Astor in 1966, the National Trust took over the management of the estate.

Cliveden has become one of the National Trust&#x27;s most popular pay-for-entry visitor attractions, hosting 524,807 visitors in 2019. National Trust visitors to Cliveden can visit the parkland, and there is occasional limited access to a select area of the house.:32

====Cliveden House Hotel====
In 1984 Blakeney Hotels (later Cliveden Hotel Ltd) acquired the lease to the house. Led by chairman John Lewis and managing director John Tham they restored and refurbished the interior.:202

In 1990 they added the indoor swimming pool and spa treatment rooms in the walled garden, complementing the existing outdoor pool. Also in 1990, a new 100-year lease was granted to run from 1984. In 1994 the conversion of the West wing from domestic offices to provide more bedrooms and two boardrooms (Churchill and Macmillan) was completed. There are 48 bedrooms and suites, all of which are named after previous owners and guests (e.g. Buckingham, Westminster). In addition to the Terrace Dining room, there are a further four private dining rooms. Three rooms are licensed for civil ceremonies and each year many couples are married at Cliveden. The hotel also leases Spring Cottage by the Thames, one of the key places in the Profumo affair, and offer it as self-contained accommodation.

The hotel was listed on the London Stock Exchange for a period of time in the 1990s (as Cliveden Plc).:202 This company was bought in 1998 by Destination Europe, a consortium including Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. In the early years of the 21st century the lease was acquired by von Essen Hotels. 
In 2007, Cliveden House Hotel claimed to offer the &quot;world&#x27;s most expensive sandwich&quot; at £100. The von Essen Platinum Club Sandwich was confirmed by Guinness World Records in 2007 to be the most expensive sandwich commercially available. Cliveden House was the &quot;jewel in the crown&quot; of Von Essen Hotels when the company collapsed in 2011.

The lease to Cliveden Hotel was then purchased in February 2012 by the property developers Richard and Ian Livingstone, owners of London &amp; Regional Properties, (also the new owners of the next-door 220-acre estate called Dropmore Park) who placed it under the management of Andrew Stembridge from Chewton Glen. In 2015 Natalie Livingstone, the wife of Ian Livingstone, published &quot;The Mistresses of Cliveden&quot;, a history of some of the female occupants of the house. In January 2015 the hotel closed for one month to carry out a refurbishment of the interior and for the National Trust to repair the roof.

The hotel&#x27;s insignia is that of the Sutherland family and consists of a coronet with interlaced &quot;S&quot;s and acanthus leaves. Three-dimensional versions of this insignia can be found on panels and radiator grills in parts of the house. The hotel&#x27;s motto is &quot;Nothing ordinary ever happened here, nor could it.&quot;

In October 2021 the building was one of 142 sites across England to receive part of a £35-million injection into the government&#x27;s Culture Recovery Fund.

==Gardens and grounds==
The estate extends to of which about comprise the gardens, the rest being woodland and paddocks. The gardens are listed as Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

===Parterre===
The formal parterre to the south of the house is one of the largest in Europe at . and is best viewed from the 20-foot (6.1m) high terrace on the south side of the mansion. This part of the garden has received the most attention over the centuries. The first arranging of the large plateau to the south of the house took place c.1723 during George Hamilton, Earl of Orkney&#x27;s ownership. Although he had previously commissioned plans for elaborate parterre schemes from Claude Desgots, the nephew of André Le Nôtre (both designers had previously worked at Versailles), Orkney eventually chose a much simpler plan involving an open expanse of lawn surrounded by raised gravel walks and double rows of elm trees. At the far end there was (and still is) a sunken feature in the turf where Orkney&#x27;s horses were exercised in a form of open-air manège.

Orkney referred to the garden as his &quot;Quaker parterre&quot; because of its simplicity. The parterre endured in this form until the mid-19th-century when the estate was owned by the Duke of Sutherland and by which time the garden had been neglected. It was described by the Duke&#x27;s son Lord Ronald Gower as &quot;a prairie...a huge field of grass and wild flowers.&quot; The Duke commissioned both Charles Barry (who had rebuilt the mansion after the second fire) and John Fleming (the head gardener) to produce designs for a complex parterre of flower beds. Fleming&#x27;s design, which featured two sets of eight interlocking wedge-shaped beds, was chosen and is the template for what can be seen today. The beds were planted with a seasonal mix of bulbs, annuals, and shrubs such as gladioli, hollyhocks, tulips, pansies, and azaleas. Fleming pioneered this style of planting at Cliveden, which was later to be named &quot;carpet-bedding.&quot;

The Cliveden scheme in the 19th century is well documented in Fleming&#x27;s handbook &quot;Winter and Spring Flower Gardening&quot; (1864). The Trust planted the present clipped yew pyramids at the corners of the beds in 1976. At this time (and for the next three decades) the beds contained a massed-planting effect of silver-evergreen Senecio &quot;Sunshine&quot; and Santolina. However, in 2010 the Trust decided to recreate Fleming&#x27;s original 19th-century planting scheme.

===Themed gardens===
The Italian-style Long Garden consists of topiary in the form of corkscrew-spirals, peacocks, and seasonal planting within box hedges; it was created by garden designer Norah Lindsay in c.1900. The Japanese-style Water Garden was designed in c.1893 and is believed to be the first such East Asian inspired garden in the country. It features a pagoda, on an island, bought from the Bagatelle estate in Paris. The planting there is mostly spring-flowering: cherry trees, bush wisterias, and giant gunneras. Both gardens were commissioned by the 1st Lord Astor.:25

The circular Rose Garden, designed by Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe for the Astor family in the early 1960s subsequently suffered from rose disease and was replanted as a &quot;secret&quot; garden of herbaceous plants in the 2000s, but in 2014 the roses were reinstated. The planting in the herbaceous borders in the forecourt was designed in the 1970s by the National Trust advisor Graham Stuart Thomas.:11 The west-facing border features &#x27;fiery&#x27;-coloured flowers (red, yellow, orange) and the east-facing border is planted with more subdued colours.

In 2011 the Trust began an ambitious project to restore the 19th-century Round Garden near the eastern edge of the estate. Originally this is where fruit was grown for the house, but since the 1950s it had become overgrown. The circular garden has a diameter of 250 ft and restoration will include reinstating the paths and wrought iron arches as well as original fruit varieties where possible.

===Woodland===
There is a lime tree avenue on either side of the main drive to the house. Cliveden holds part of the National Plant Collection of Catalpa. In 1897 the 1st Lord Astor imported a section of a Californian redwood and had it installed in the woods. At across it is the largest section of a Sequoia gigantea in Britain.

The woodlands were first laid out by Lord Orkney in the 18th century.:26–27 They were later much restocked by Bill Astor, however many of the trees fell in storms in the late twentieth century.:27

===Maze===
The original Cliveden maze, commissioned by Lord Astor in 1894, has undergone major restoration after having lain overgrown and inaccessible since the 1950s. It was replanted with 1,100 six-foot-tall yew trees covering an area of one-third of an acre (0.13 hectares) and opened to the public in 2011.

===Garden buildings: pavilions and follies===
The earliest known garden buildings at Cliveden were both designed by Giacomo Leoni for Lord Orkney; the Blenheim Pavilion (c.1727) was built to commemorate Orkney&#x27;s victory as a general at the Battle of Blenheim.:10

The pagoda in the water garden was made for the Paris Exposition Universelle (1867) and was purchased by the 1st Viscount Astor from the Bagatelle estate in Paris in 1900.

In the woods, there is a small flint folly thought to date from the late-18th to early-19th century.

=== Octagon Temple (Astor family chapel) ===

The Octagon Temple, situated 200 ft above the Thames, was originally designed by Giacomo Leoni in 1735 as a gazebo and grotto but was later converted by the 1st Viscount Astor to become the Astor family chapel.:15

In addition to its function as Astor family chapel, the Octagon Temple was adapted to serve as the family mausoleum in 1893. Today, three generations of Astors are buried here. The mausoleum contains the ashes of the 1st Viscount Astor, his son the 2nd Viscount, and of the latter&#x27;s wife, Nancy Astor. The ashes of the 3rd Viscount and of Robert Gould Shaw III (Nancy Astor&#x27;s son by her first marriage) are also buried here.

The mausoleum&#x27;s interior and dome are decorated with colourful mosaics by Clayton and Bell representing religious scenes.

===Sculpture collection===

One of the features of the gardens is the large collection of sculptures, most of them acquired by the 1st Lord Astor from 1893 to 1906. The shell fountain, known as the Fountain of Love, greets visitors at the end of the lime tree avenue up to the house. It was sculpted by Thomas Waldo Story, (American, 1855–1915) in Rome in 1897 and was commissioned by Lord Astor for this site.:7 It features a large Carrara marble shell supporting three life-size female figures attended by cupid. The &quot;Tortoise&quot; fountain near the parterre was also made by Story at around the same time.:19

In the forecourt, there is a collection of eight marble Roman sarcophagi, some of which date from  AD and were bought by Lord Astor from Rome.:20–21

The Queen Anne Vase at the end of the Long Walk is said to have been given to Lord Orkney by Queen Anne in the eighteenth century.:7 It consists of a tall urn on a plinth decorated with the Greek key pattern.

At the far end of the parterre is a twentieth-century copy of a bronze group entitled &quot;The Rape of Proserpina&quot; (Italian, c.1565), bought by William Waldorf Astor from Italy. The original is now housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

The well-heads and oil jars found throughout the gardens came from Venice and Rome respectively.

Sitting on modern plinths in the Long Garden are two ancient Egyptian baboon sculptures, thought to be 2,000 – 2,500 years old, that were purchased by William Waldorf Astor in Rome in 1898. It is believed that these sculptures represent Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing and wisdom.

===Borghese Balustrade===
The largest sculpture on the grounds, technically in two parts, is the 17th-century Borghese Balustrade on the parterre. Purchased by Lord Astor in the late 19th century from the Villa Borghese gardens in Rome, it is crafted from Travertine stone and brick tiles by Giuseppe Di Giacomo and Paolo Massini in c.1618–19. It features seats and balustrading with fountain basins and carved eagles.:18–19

===&quot;Cliveden Snail&quot;===
In 2004, a colony of small Mediterranean land snails of the species &quot;Papillifera bidens&quot; was discovered living on the Borghese Balustrade. Presumably, this species, new to the English fauna, was accidentally imported along with the balustrade in the late 19th century and managed to survive the intervening winters to the present day.

===Spring Cottage===

This is the largest and most complex of the four timber-framed cottages designed or altered by the architect George Devey along the banks of the River Thames on the Cliveden estate. The first structure on the site was a Gothic-style summerhouse with an octagonal vaulted plaster ceiling designed in 1813 by architect Peter Nicholson for Mary FitzMaurice, 4th Countess of Orkney. She was living in one wing of the burnt down mansion at the time of the commission. It was used as a tea house and spa for the many visitors attracted to the nearby mineral springs, which flowed from the chalk cliff above and ran down into the Thames.

Nicholson published his designs for the house in his &quot;Architectural Dictionary&quot; of 1813 in the form of a cross-section of the interior and ceiling projection. In auction particulars dated 1821, which list all structures on the estate, the building is described as a Banqueting house &quot;at the much admired spring&quot;, while several decades later it was described as an &quot;ornamental fishing villa.&quot;

In 1857, the Duke of Sutherland, who had owned Cliveden for eight years, commissioned George Devey to enlarge the existing building into a two-storey cottage. The subsequent alterations were in the vernacular style with brick and stucco walls, fish-scale pattern roof slates, a Gothick-style loggia and a turret above an exterior staircase leading to a balcony. Throughout the remainder of the 19th century the main purpose of the cottage was as a place of leisure, and it was frequently used by the Duke&#x27;s wife Harriet to entertain guests, most notably her friend Queen Victoria.

In 1957, the cottage came to the attention of London osteopath Stephen Ward, who had been hired to treat Bill Astor. He leased the cottage from the Astors for a minimal rent for use as a weekend retreat. Among the guests invited to stay, there were Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies.:184 A chance meeting in 1961 between Keeler and cabinet minister John Profumo (a guest of the Astors) at the Cliveden swimming pool led to the Profumo affair which so damaged the Macmillan government.:185

Spring Cottage was awarded Grade II listed status in 1986, and in 1997 the hotel company which leased Cliveden House from the National Trust also acquired the lease to the cottage. A reported £750,000 was spent restoring and refurbishing the dilapidated building before it reopened in 1998 as a self-contained luxury holiday let.

===Cliveden Reach===
Cliveden Reach, between Cookham Lock and Boulter&#x27;s Lock, is one of the most scenic stretches of the Thames. A section of the original Thames towpath extends from the boathouse, north to Cookham Lock. Cliveden House may be accessed by watercraft from the mooring on Cliveden Reach half a mile downstream from Cliveden boathouse. A series of eyots in the reach are owned by the National Trust, and allow for short periods of mooring for passing boats. Cliveden Reach is a popular spot for canoeing, kayaking, and angling. The National Trust offers self-hire boats and guided river cruises.

== In popular culture ==
=== Art ===
Cliveden has been depicted in paintings, for example: &quot;Cliveden&quot;, (c.1750–80), by William Tomkins, and &quot;A Fallen Beech with a Prospect of Cliveden&quot;, (1988), by Carl Laubin.

=== Film ===
The house has been used for filming on multiple occasions, including: &quot;A Very British Country House&quot; (2018);&quot; Hampstead&quot; (2017); &quot;Paul Hollywood City Bakes&quot; (2016); &quot;Mr Selfridge&quot; (2016); &quot;Cinderella&quot; (2015); &quot;A Little Chaos&quot; (2014);&quot; Endless Night&quot; (2013); &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009); &quot;Made of Honour&quot; (2008); &quot;Cards on the Table&quot; (2005); &quot;Mrs. Henderson Presents&quot; (2005); &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; (2004); &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; (2000); &quot;Carrington&quot; (1995); &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992); &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot; (1986); &quot;Operation Daybreak&quot; (1975); &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Your Head&quot; (1966); &quot;Help!&quot; (1965); and &quot;Yaadein&quot; (2001).

=== Literature ===
Cliveden has been referenced in literature including: &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; (1889); &quot;Boogie Up the River&quot; (1989); Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Moral Essays&quot;; Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;A Tour Through England and Wales&quot; (1726) and Gore Vidal&#x27;s novel &quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; (1948).

Both the house and the river have been suggested as the inspiration for Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wind in the Willows.&quot;

<text>In mathematics education, ethnomathematics is the study of the relationship between mathematics and culture. Often associated with &quot;cultures without written expression&quot;, it may also be defined as &quot;the mathematics which is practised among identifiable cultural groups&quot;. It refers to a broad cluster of ideas ranging from distinct numerical and mathematical systems to multicultural mathematics education. The goal of ethnomathematics is to contribute both to the understanding of culture and the understanding of mathematics, and mainly to lead to an appreciation of the connections between the two.

==Development and meaning==
The term &quot;ethnomathematics&quot; was introduced by Brazilian educator and mathematician Ubiratan D&#x27;Ambrosio in 1977 during a presentation for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Since D&#x27;Ambrosio put forth the term, there has been debate as to its precise definition.).

The following is a sampling of some of the definitions of ethnomathematics proposed between 1985 and 2006:

*&quot;The mathematics which is practiced among identifiable cultural groups such as national-tribe societies, labour groups, children of certain age brackets and professional classes&quot;.
*&quot;The mathematics implicit in each practice&quot;.
*&quot;The study of mathematical ideas of a non-literate culture&quot;.
*&quot;The codification which allows a cultural group to describe, manage and understand reality&quot;.
*&quot;Mathematics…is conceived as a cultural product which has developed as a result of various activities&quot;.
*&quot;The study and presentation of mathematical ideas of traditional peoples&quot;.
*&quot;Any form of cultural knowledge or social activity characteristic of a social group and/or cultural group that can be recognized by other groups such as Western anthropologists, but not necessarily by the group of origin, as mathematical knowledge or mathematical activity&quot;.
*&quot;The mathematics of cultural practice&quot;.
*&quot;The investigation of the traditions, practices and mathematical concepts of a subordinated social group&quot;.
*&quot;I have been using the word &quot;ethnomathematics&quot; as modes, styles, and techniques (&quot;tics&quot;) of explanation, of understanding, and of coping with the natural and cultural environment (&quot;mathema&quot;) in distinct cultural systems (&quot;ethnos&quot;)&quot;.
*&quot;What is the difference between ethnomathematics and the general practice of creating a mathematical model of a cultural phenomenon (e.g., the &quot;mathematical anthropology&quot; of Paul Kay [1971] and others)? The essential issue is the relation between intentionality and epistemological status. A single drop of water issuing from a watering can, for example, can be modeled mathematically, but we would not attribute knowledge of that mathematics to the average gardener. Estimating the increase in seeds required for an increased garden plot, on the other hand, would qualify&quot;.
*&quot;N.C. Ghosh included Ethnomathematics in the list of Folk Mathematics&quot; Vide : Lokdarpan- a Journal of the Department of Folklore, Kalyani University and Rabindra Bharati Patrika- a Journal of Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata, India. Lokashruti - a Journal of Govt. of West Bengal, India.

====Numerals====

Some of the systems for representing numbers in previous and present cultures are well known. Roman numerals use a few letters of the alphabet to represent numbers up to the thousands, but are not intended for arbitrarily large numbers and can only represent positive integers. Arabic numerals are a family of systems, originating in India and passing to medieval Islamic civilization, then to Europe, and now standard in global culture—and having undergone many curious changes with time and geography—can represent arbitrarily large numbers and have been adapted to negative numbers, fractions, and real numbers.

Less well known systems include some that are written and can be read today, such as the Hebrew and Greek method of using the letters of the alphabet, in order, for digits 1–9, tens 10–90, and hundreds 100–900.

A completely different system is that of the quipu, which recorded numbers on knotted strings.

Ethnomathematicians are interested in the ways in which numeration systems grew up, as well as their similarities and differences and the reasons for them. The great variety in ways of representing numbers is especially intriguing.

====Names for numbers====

This means the ways in which number words are formed.

=====English=====
For instance, in English, there are four different systems. The units words (one to nine) and ten are special. The next two are reduced forms of Anglo-Saxon &quot;one left over&quot; and &quot;two left over&quot; (i.e., after counting to ten). Multiples of ten from &quot;twenty&quot; to &quot;ninety&quot; are formed from the units words, one through nine, by a single pattern. Thirteen to nineteen are compounded from tens and units words in one way, and the non-multiples of ten from twenty-one to ninety-nine are compounded from tens and units words in a different way. Larger numbers are also formed on a base of ten and its powers (&quot;hundred&quot; and &quot;thousand&quot;). One may suspect this is based on an ancient tradition of finger counting. Residues of ancient counting by 20s and 12s are the words &quot;score&quot;, &quot;dozen&quot;, and &quot;gross&quot;. (Larger number words like &quot;million&quot; are not part of the original English system; they are scholarly creations based ultimately on Latin.). There were historical inconsistencies in the way the term &quot;billion&quot; was used between American English and British English. These have since been reconciled, and modern English speakers universally refer to 1,000,000,000 as &#x27;one billion&#x27;.

=====German=====
The German language and Dutch language counts similarly to English, but the unit is placed before the tens in numbers over 20. For example, &quot;26&quot; is &quot;sechsundzwanzig&quot;, literally &quot;six and twenty&quot;. This system was formerly common in English, as seen in an artifact from the English nursery rhyme &quot;Sing a Song of Sixpence&quot;: &quot;Sing a song of sixpence, / a pocket full of rye. / Four and twenty blackbirds, / baked in a pie.&quot; It persists in some children&#x27;s songs such as &quot;One and Twenty .&quot;

=====French=====
In the French language as used in France, one sees some differences. &quot;Soixante-dix&quot; (literally, &quot;sixty-ten&quot;) is used for &quot;seventy&quot;. The words &quot;quatre-vingt&quot; (literally, &quot;four-twenty&quot;, or 80) and &quot;quatre-vingt-dix&quot; (literally, &quot;four-twenty ten&quot; 90) are based on 20 (&quot;vingt&quot;) instead of 10. Swiss French and Belgian French do not use these forms, preferring more standard Latinate forms: &quot;septante&quot; for 70, &quot;huitante&quot; (formerly &quot;octante&quot;) for 80 (only in Swiss French) and &quot;nonante&quot; for 90.

=====Welsh=====
Counting in Welsh combines the vigesimal system (counting in twenties) with some other features. The following system is optional for cardinal numbers nowadays, but mandatory for ordinal numbers.

=====Chinese=====

Number words in Chinese are assembled from the words for &quot;one&quot; through &quot;nine&quot; and words for powers of ten.

For example, what is in English written out as &quot;twelve thousand three hundred forty five&quot; is &quot;一万二千三百四十五&quot; (simplified) / &quot;一萬二千三百四十五&quot; (traditional) whose characters translate to &quot;one ten-thousand two thousand three hundred four ten five&quot;.

=====Mesopotamia=====
In ancient Mesopotamia, the base for constructing numbers was 60, with 10 used as an intermediate base for numbers below 60.

=====West Africa=====
Many West African languages generally base their number words on a combination of 5 and 20, derived from thinking of a complete hand or a complete set of digits comprising both fingers and toes. In fact, in some languages, the words for 5 and 20 refer to these body parts. The words for numbers below 20 are based on 5 and higher numbers combine the lower numbers with multiples and powers of 20. This description of hundreds of African languages is badly oversimplified.

====Finger counting====

Many systems of finger counting have been, and still are, used in various parts of the world. Most are not as obvious as holding up a number of fingers. The position of fingers may be most important. One continuing use for finger counting is for people who speak different languages to communicate prices in the marketplace.

In contrast to finger counting, the Yuki people (indigenous Americans from Northern California) keep count by using the four spaces between their fingers rather than the fingers themselves. This is known as an octal (base-8) counting system.

===The history of mathematics===

This area of ethnomathematics mainly focuses on addressing Eurocentrism by countering the common belief that most worthwhile mathematics known and used today was developed in the Western world.
The area stresses that &quot;the history of mathematics has been oversimplified&quot;,
and seeks to explore the emergence of mathematics from various ages and civilizations throughout human history.

====Some examples and major contributors====

D&#x27;Ambrosio&#x27;s 1980 review of the evolution of mathematics, his 1985 appeal to include ethnomathematics in the history of mathematics and his 2002 paper about the historiographical approaches to non-Western mathematics are excellent examples. Additionally, Frankenstein and Powell&#x27;s 1989 attempt to redefine mathematics from a non-eurocentric viewpoint and Anderson&#x27;s 1990 concepts of world mathematics are strong contributions to this area. Detailed examinations of the history of the mathematical developments of non-European civilizations, such as the mathematics of ancient Japan, Iraq, Egypt, and of Islamic, Hebrew, and Incan civilizations, have also been presented.

===The philosophy and cultural nature of mathematics===

The core of any debate about the cultural nature of mathematics will ultimately lead to an examination of the nature of mathematics itself. One of the oldest and most controversial topics in this area is whether mathematics is internal or external, tracing back to the arguments of Plato, an externalist, and Aristotle, an internalist. On the one hand, Internalists such as Bishop, Stigler and Baranes, believe mathematics to be a cultural product. On the other hand, externalists, like Barrow, Chevallard and Penrose, see mathematics as culture-free, and tend to be major critics of ethnomathematics. With disputes about the nature of mathematics, come questions about the nature of ethnomathematics, and the question of whether ethnomathematics is part of mathematics or not. Barton, who has offered the core of research about ethnomathematics and philosophy, asks whether &quot;ethnomathematics is a precursor, parallel body of knowledge or precolonized body of knowledge&quot; to mathematics and if it is even possible for us to identify all types of mathematics based on a Western-epistemological foundation.

===Political math===

The contributions in this area try to illuminate how mathematics has affected the nonacademic areas of society. One of the most controversial and provocative political components of ethnomathematics is its racial implications. Ethnomathematicians purport that the prefix &quot;ethno&quot; should not be taken as relating to race, but rather, the cultural traditions of groups of people. However, in places like South Africa concepts of culture, ethnicity and race are not only intertwined but carry strong, divisive negative connotations. So, although it may be made explicit that ethnomathematics is not a &quot;racist doctrine&quot; it is vulnerable to association with racism.

Another major facet of this area addresses the relationship between gender and mathematics. This looks at topics such as discrepancies between male and female math performance in educations and career-orientation, societal causes, women&#x27;s contributions to mathematics research and development, etc.

====Some examples and major contributors====
Paulus Gerdes&#x27; writings about how mathematics can be used in the school systems of Mozambique and South Africa, and D&#x27;Ambrosio&#x27;s 1990 discussion of the role mathematics plays in building a democratic and just society are examples of the impact mathematics can have on developing the identity of a society. In 1990, Bishop also writes about the powerful and dominating influence of Western mathematics. More specific examples of the political impact of mathematics are seen in Knijik&#x27;s 1993 study of how Brazilian sugar cane farmers could be politically and economically armed with mathematics knowledge, and Osmond&#x27;s analysis of an employer&#x27;s perceived value of mathematics (2000).

===The mathematics of different cultures===

The focus of this area is to introduce the mathematical ideas of people who have generally been excluded from discussions of formal, academic mathematics. The research of the mathematics of these cultures indicates two, slightly contradictory viewpoints. The first supports the objectivity of mathematics and that it is something discovered not constructed. The studies reveal that all cultures have basic counting, sorting and deciphering methods, and that these have arisen independently in different places around the world. This can be used to argue that these mathematical concepts are being discovered rather than created. However, others emphasize that the usefulness of mathematics is what tends to conceal its cultural constructs. Naturally, it is not surprising that extremely practical concepts such as numbers and counting have arisen in all cultures. The universality of these concepts, however, seems harder to sustain as more and more research reveals practices which are typically mathematical, such as counting, ordering, sorting, measuring and weighing, done in radically different ways (see Section 2.1: Numerals and Naming Systems).

One of the challenges faced by researchers in this area is the fact that they are limited by their own mathematical and cultural frameworks. The discussions of the mathematical ideas of other cultures recast these into a Western framework in order to identify and understand them. This raises the questions of how many mathematical ideas evade notice simply because they lack similar Western mathematical counterparts, and of how to draw the line classifying mathematical from non-mathematical ideas.

====Some examples and major contributors====
The majority of research in this area has been about the intuitive mathematical thinking of small-scale, traditional, indigenous cultures, including Aboriginal Australians, the indigenous people of Liberia, Native Americans in North America, Pacific Islanders, Brazilian construction foremen, and various tribes in Africa.

====Games of skill====

An enormous variety of games that can be analyzed mathematically have been played around the world and through history. The interest of the ethnomathematician usually centers on the ways in which the game represents informal mathematical thought as part of ordinary society, but sometimes has extended to mathematical analyses of games. It does not include the careful analysis of good play—but it may include the social or mathematical aspects of such analysis.

A mathematical game that is well known in European culture is tic-tac-toe (noughts-and-crosses). This is a geometrical game played on a 3-by-3 square; the goal is to form a straight line of three of the same symbol. There are many broadly similar games from all parts of England, to name only one country where they are found.

Another kind of geometrical game involves objects that move or jump over each other within a specific shape (a &quot;board&quot;). There may be captures. The goal may be to eliminate the opponent&#x27;s pieces, or simply to form a certain configuration, e.g., to arrange the objects according to a rule. One such game is nine men&#x27;s morris; it has innumerable relatives where the board or setup or moves may vary, sometimes drastically. This kind of game is well suited to play out of doors with stones on the dirt, though now it may use plastic pieces on a paper or wooden board.

A mathematical game found in West Africa is to draw a certain figure by a line that never ends until it closes the figure by reaching the starting point (in mathematical terminology, this is a Eulerian path on a graph). Children use sticks to draw these in the dirt or sand, and of course the game can be played with pen and paper.

The games of checkers, chess, oware (and other mancala games), and Go may also be viewed as subjects for ethnomathematics.

====Mathematics in folk art====

One way mathematics appears in art is through symmetries. Woven designs in cloth or carpets (to name two) commonly have some kind of symmetrical arrangement. A rectangular carpet often has rectangular symmetry in the overall pattern. A woven cloth may exhibit one of the seventeen kinds of plane symmetry groups; see Crowe (2004) for an illustrated mathematical study of African weaving patterns. Several types of patterns discovered by ethnomathematical communities are related to technologies; see Berczi (2002) about illustrated mathematical study of patterns and symmetry in Eurasia. Following the analysis of Indonesian folk weaving patterns and Batak traditional architectural ornaments, the geometry of Indonesian traditional motifs of batik is analyzed by Hokky Situngkir that eventually made a new genre of fractal batik designs as generative art; see Situngkir and Surya (2007) for implementations.

===Mathematics education===

Ethnomathematics and mathematics education addresses first, how cultural values can affect teaching, learning and curriculum, and second, how mathematics education can then affect the political and social dynamics of a culture. One of the stances taken by many educators is that it is crucial to acknowledge the cultural context of mathematics students by teaching culturally based mathematics that students can relate to. Can teaching math through cultural relevance and personal experiences help the learners know more about reality, culture, society and themselves? Robert (2006)

Another approach suggested by mathematics educators is exposing students to the mathematics of a variety of different cultural contexts, often referred to as multicultural math. This can be used both to increase the social awareness of students and offer alternative methods of approaching conventional mathematics operations, like multiplication (Andrew, 2005).

====Examples====
Various mathematics educators have explored ways of bringing together culture and mathematics in the classroom, such as: Barber and Estrin (1995) and Bradley (1984) on Native American education, Gerdes (1988b and 2001) with suggestions for using African art and games, Malloy (1997) about African American students and Flores (1997), who developed instructional strategies for Hispanic students.

== Criticism ==
Some critics claim that mathematics education unduly emphasizes ethnomathematics in order to promote multiculturalism while spending too little time on core mathematical content, and that this often results in pseudoscience being taught. Richard Askey examined &quot;Focus on Algebra&quot; (an Addison-Wesley textbook criticized in an op-ed by Marianne M. Jennings) and among other shortcomings found it guilty of repeating debunked claims about Dogon astronomy.

More recently, curriculum changes proposed by the Seattle school district drew criticism to ethnomathematics. Some people judged the proposed changes, which involved a framework for blending math and ethnic studies, for incorporating questions like &quot;How important is it to be right?&quot; and &quot;Who gets to say if an answer is right?&quot;

<doc id="324875" wikidata="Q7893409" url="?curid=324875" title="United States v. Morrison">
<text>United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), is a U.S. Supreme Court decision that held that parts of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 were unconstitutional because they exceeded the powers granted to the US Congress under the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause. Along with &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot; (1995), it was part of a series of Rehnquist Court cases that limited Congress&#x27;s powers under the Commerce Clause.

The case arose from a challenge to a provision of the Violence Against Women Act that provided victims of gender-motivated violence the right to sue their attackers in federal court. In a majority opinion joined by four other justices, Chief Justice William Rehnquist held that the Commerce Clause gave Congress only the power to regulate activities that were directly economic in nature, even if there were indirect economic consequences. Rehnquist also held that the Equal Protection Clause did not authorize the law because the clause applies only to acts by states, not to acts by private individuals.

In his dissenting opinion, Associate Justice David Souter argued that the majority revived an old and discredited interpretation of the Commerce Clause.

==Background==
In 1994, the United States Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act, which contained a provision at for a federal civil remedy to victims of gender-based violence even if no criminal charges had been filed against the alleged perpetrator of that violence.

That fall, at Virginia Tech, freshman student, Christy Brzonkala, alleged that she was assaulted and raped repeatedly by students Antonio Morrison and James Crawford. Brzonkala initially stated that she visited Morrison and Crawford in their dormitory and they assaulted her, but later claimed that she was assaulted in her dormitory, and had never met the students until that day. During the school-conducted hearing on her complaint, Morrison admitted having sexual contact with her, but claimed that it was consensual. College proceedings failed to punish Crawford who produced an alibi witness, but initially punished Morrison with a suspension (which was later struck down by the administration). A state grand jury did not find sufficient evidence to charge either man with a crime. Brzonkala then filed suit under the Violence Against Women Act.

The United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia held that Congress lacked authority to enact 42 U.S.C. § 13981. A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the decision 2–1. The Fourth Circuit reheard the case &quot;en banc&quot; and reversed the panel, upholding the district court.

==Ruling==
The Court&#x27;s 5–4 decision invalidated the section of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 that gave victims of gender-motivated violence the right to sue their attackers in federal court. Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, held that Congress lacked authority, under either the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, to enact that provision.

However, the Act&#x27;s program funding remained unaffected.

==Majority opinion==
The majority opinion was that VAWA exceeded congressional power under the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.

===Commerce Clause===
With regard to the Commerce Clause, the majority said that the result was controlled by &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot; (1995), which had held that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 was unconstitutional. As in &quot;Morrison&quot;, the Court had stressed &quot;enumerated powers&quot; that limit federal power to maintain &quot;a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.&quot; Therefore, &quot;Lopez&quot; limited the scope of the Commerce Clause to exclude activity that was not directly economic in nature, even if there were indirect economic consequences. &quot;Lopez&quot; was the first significant limitation on the Commerce Clause powers of Congress in 53 years. The &quot;Lopez&quot; court stated that Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce, the &quot;instrumentalities&quot; (such as vehicles) used in interstate commerce, and activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. Because VAWA&#x27;s civil remedy concededly did not regulate the first or second categories, the Court analyzed its validity under the third in &quot;Morrison&quot;.

The majority concluded that acts of violence that were meant to be remedied by VAWA had only an &quot;attenuated,&quot; not a substantial, effect on interstate commerce. The government, however, argued that &quot;a mountain of evidence&quot; indicated that such acts in the aggregate had a substantial effect. For that proposition the government relied on &quot;Wickard v. Filburn&quot; (1942), which held that Congress could regulate an individual act that lacked a substantial effect on interstate commerce if, when aggregated, such acts had the required relation to interstate commerce. Once again, relying on &quot;Lopez&quot;, the majority replied that the aggregation principle of &quot;Wickard&quot; did not apply because economic effects of crimes against women were indirect and so they could not be addressed through the Commerce Clause.

The Court explained that the need to distinguish between economic activities that directly and those that indirectly affect interstate commerce was caused by &quot;the concern that we expressed in &quot;Lopez&quot; that Congress might use the Commerce Clause to completely obliterate the Constitution&#x27;s distinction between national and local authority.&quot; Referring to &quot;Lopez&quot;, the Court stated, &quot;Were the Federal Government to take over the regulation of entire areas of traditional State concern, areas having nothing to do with the regulation of commercial activities, the boundaries between the spheres of federal and State authority would blur.&quot; The majority further stated that &quot;it is difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign.&quot;

Justice Thomas&#x27;s concurring opinion also expressed the concern that &quot;Congress [was] appropriating State police powers under the guise of regulating commerce.&quot;

The majority, quoting from &quot;NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.&quot; (1937), stated that the scope of the interstate commerce power
===Equal Protection Clause===
The Court also held that Congress lacked the power to enact VAWA under the Fourteenth Amendment. It relied on the &quot;state action&quot; doctrine, which originated in &quot;United States v. Harris&quot; (1883) and the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; (1883), and provides that the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment do not constrain private individuals.

The U.S. government argued that VAWA appropriately enforced the Equal Protection Clause&#x27;s ban on governmental gender discrimination. Specially, the government argued that pervasive gender stereotypes and assumptions permeated state justice systems and that such forms of state bias led to &quot;insufficient investigation and prosecution of gender-motivated crime, inappropriate focus on the behavior and credibility of the victims of that crime, and unacceptably lenient punishments for those who are actually convicted of gender-motivated violence.&quot; That bias, the government argued, deprived women of the equal protection of the laws, and the private civil remedy of VAWA was meant to redress &quot;both the States&#x27; bias and deter future instances of gender discrimination in the state courts.&quot;

The Court responded that even if there had been gender-based disparate treatment by state authorities in that case, precedents such as the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; limit the manner in which Congress may remedy discrimination, and they require a civil remedy to be directed at a state or a state actor, not a private party. The Court stated that such precedents prohibit only action by state governments, not private conduct. In other words, the unequal enforcement of state laws caused by inaction is, by that interpretation, beyond the scope of the federal government&#x27;s enforcement of the Equal Protection Clause.

The majority reaffirmed the state action doctrine and specifically reaffirmed the results reached in &quot;United States v. Harris&quot; (1883) and the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; (1883), both of which were decided 15 years after the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s ratification in 1868. In the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot;, the Court had held that the Equal Protection Clause applied only to acts done by states, not to acts done by private individuals. Because the Civil Rights Act of 1875 applied to racial discrimination in private establishments, the Court decided in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot;, it exceeded congressional enforcement power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. In &quot;Harris&quot;, the Court ruled that the Clause did not apply to a prison lynching since the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply to private actors, only state actors. In that case, a sheriff, a state actor, had tried to prevent the lynching.

&quot;Morrison&quot; stated that &quot;assuming that there has been gender-based disparate treatment by state authorities in this case, it would not be enough to save § 13981&#x27;s civil remedy, which is directed not at a State or state actor but at individuals who have committed criminal acts motivated by gender bias.&quot; The Court agreed with the government that there was a &quot;voluminous congressional record&quot; supporting the &quot;assertion that there is pervasive bias in various state justice systems against victims of gender-motivated violence.&quot; The Court also agreed with the government that &quot;state-sponsored gender discrimination violates equal protection unless it serves important governmental objectives...&quot; However, according to the majority, even if there is unconstitutional state action, Congress is justified in targeting only state actors, rather than private parties.

The government&#x27;s argument was that VAWA had been enacted in response to &quot;gender-based disparate treatment by state authorities.&quot; In contrast there was &quot;no indication of such state action&quot; in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot;. According to the Court, however, the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not allow Congress to target private parties to remedy the unequal enforcement of state laws. To support that interpretation of the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot;, the Court quoted one of the Congressmen who had supported the law that the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; struck down: &quot;There were state laws on the books bespeaking equality of treatment, but in the administration of these laws there was discrimination against newly freed slaves.&quot; To the majority, that quote indicated that the law deemed unconstitutional in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; was meant to combat the same kind of disparate treatment against which VAWA was aimed.

The majority continued that even if the government&#x27;s distinction between &quot;Morrison&quot; and the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; was valid, the VAWA remained unconstitutionally aimed not at state actors but at private criminal conduct. Under &quot;City of Boerne v. Flores&quot; (1997), the majority stated, Congress was required to adhere to the Court&#x27;s interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, including the Court&#x27;s interpretation of the state-action doctrine. The &quot;congruence and proportionality&quot; requirement of &quot;Boerne&quot; did not allow Congress to exceed the Court&#x27;s interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although it had been widely believed that Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment was a &quot;one-way ratchet&quot; and a minimum standard, the Court&#x27;s interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause, that interpretation had been rejected by the Court in &quot;Boerne&quot; to prevent what the Court described as &quot;a considerable congressional intrusion into the States&#x27; traditional prerogatives and general authority.&quot;

The belief that section five was a &quot;one-way ratchet&quot; had been based on &quot;Katzenbach v. Morgan&quot;, 384 U.S. 641 (1966), in which the Court had called that Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment &quot;a positive grant of legislative power authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in determining the need for and nature of legislation to secure Fourteenth Amendment guarantees.&quot; In &quot;Morrison&quot;, the Court, as it had in &quot;Boerne&quot;, again distinguished &quot;Morgan&quot; on the ground that &quot;Morgan&quot; had involved federal legislation &quot;directed at New York officials,&quot; instead of private parties. The Court also noted that unlike the VAWA, the legislation in &quot;Morgan&quot; &quot;was directed only to the State where the evil found by Congress existed.&quot;

==Dissenting opinions==
Justice Souter, joined by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, argued that enacting VAWA was well within Congress&#x27;s power under the Commerce Clause and stated that the majority revived an old and discredited interpretation of the Commerce Clause. Justice Breyer, joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, argued that it was primarily the responsibility of Congress, not the courts, to put limits on Congress&#x27;s power under the Commerce Clause. Joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Breyer contended that Congress had been sensitive to concerns of federalism in enacting VAWA, and he expressed doubts about the majority&#x27;s pronouncements on the Fourteenth Amendment. According to the four dissenting justices, the Fourteenth Amendment and the Seventeenth Amendment &quot;are not rips in the fabric of the Framers&#x27; Constitution, inviting judicial repairs,&quot; and amendments affecting states&#x27; rights like the Seventeenth Amendment &quot;did not convert the judiciary into an alternate shield against the commerce power.&quot;

==Reactions==
&quot;Morrison&quot;, like &quot;Boerne&quot;, &quot;Kimel&quot;, and &quot;Garrett&quot;, was one of a series of Rehnquist Court decisions from 1999 through 2001 holding that Congress&#x27;s enumerated powers do not permit various federal civil rights laws. &quot;Morrison&quot; was also seen by the press as one of the Rehnquist Court&#x27;s series of federalism decisions, mainly because of the Court&#x27;s previous decisions in &quot;Lopez&quot; and other cases.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; came out in favor of &quot;Morrison&quot;: &quot;The court got it right. If Congress could federalize rape and assault, it&#x27;s hard to think of anything it couldn&#x27;t.&quot; The lawyer and writer Wendy Kaminer agreed with the courts that Congress had overstepped its bounds by invoking the Commerce Clause: &quot;The price of upholding VAWA&#x27;s civil rights remedy is an unconstitutional grant of unlimited power to Congress, power that will not always be used wisely or with regard to individual rights. We need to combat sexual violence without making a federal case of it.&quot;

Professor Catharine MacKinnon criticized &quot;Morrison&quot; for relying on &quot;implicitly patriarchal&quot; legal reasoning. She argued that the decision reflected an attitude, pervasive in the American judicial system, of violence against women being a &quot;domestic&quot; issue and therefore less serious than &quot;male issues.&quot; Professor Peter M. Shane said that the attorneys general of 36 states had endorsed the VAWA, and he argued that the endorsement &quot;exposes one of the more bizarre aspects of the Supreme Court&#x27;s recent activism on behalf of state sovereignty: From the states&#x27; point of view, this campaign is often pointless and sometimes counterproductive.&quot; Shane stated the 36 attorneys general had called the Violence Against Women Act &quot;a particularly appropriate remedy for the harm caused by gender-motivated violence.&quot;

<text>Rational ignorance is refraining from acquiring knowledge when the supposed cost of educating oneself on an issue exceeds the expected potential benefit that the knowledge would provide.

Ignorance about an issue is said to be &quot;rational&quot; when the cost of educating oneself about the issue sufficiently to make an informed decision can outweigh any potential benefit one could reasonably expect to gain from that decision, and so it would be irrational to spend time doing so. This has consequences for the quality of decisions made by large numbers of people, such as in general elections, where the probability of any one vote changing the outcome is very small.

The term is most often found in economics, particularly public choice theory, but also used in other disciplines which study rationality and choice, including philosophy (epistemology) and game theory.

The term was coined by Anthony Downs in &quot;An Economic Theory of Democracy&quot;.

==Example==
Consider an employer attempting to choose between two candidates offering to complete a task at the cost of $10/hour. The length of time needed to complete the task may be longer or shorter depending on the skill of the person performing the task, so it is in the employer&#x27;s best interests to find the fastest worker possible. Assume that the cost of another day of interviewing the candidates is $100. If the employer had deduced from the interviews so far that both candidates would complete the task in somewhere between 195 and 205 hours, it would be in the employer&#x27;s best interests to choose one or the other by some easily applied metric (for example, flipping a coin) rather than spend the $100 on determining the better candidate, saving at most $100 in labor. In many cases, the decision may be made on the basis of heuristics; a simple decision model which may not be completely accurate. For example, in deciding which brand of prepared food is most nutritious, a shopper might simply choose the one with (for example) the lowest amount of sugar, rather than conducting a research study of all the positive and negative factors in nutrition.

==Applications==
=== In marketing ===
Marketers can take advantage of rational ignorance by increasing the complexity of a decision. If the difference in value between a quality product and a poor product is less than the cost to perform the research necessary to differentiate between them, then it is more rational for a consumer to just take his chances on whichever of the two is more convenient and available. Thus, it is in the interest of the producer of a lower value product to proliferate features, options, and package combinations which will tend to increase the number of shoppers who decide it&#x27;s too much trouble to make an informed decision.

=== In politics ===
Politics and elections especially display the same dynamic. By increasing the number of issues that a person needs to consider to make a rational decision about candidates or policies, politicians and pundits encourage single-issue voting, party-line voting, jingoism, selling votes, or dart-throwing all of which may tip the playing field in favor of politicians who do not actually represent the electorate.

This does not mean that voters make poor and biased decisions: rather that in carrying out their everyday responsibilities (like working and taking care of a family), many people do not have the time to devote to researching every aspect of a candidate&#x27;s policies. So many people find themselves making rational decisions meaning they let others who are more versed in the subject do the research and they form their opinion based on the evidence provided. They are being rationally ignorant not because they don&#x27;t care but because they simply do not have the time.

Because the cost/benefit ratio increases with increasing costs decreasing the benefit, the same effect can occur when politicians protect their policy decisions from the preferences of the public. To the degree that the electorate perceives their individual votes to count for less, they will have less incentive to spend any time actually learning any details about the candidate(s).

A more nuanced example occurs when a voter identifies with a particular political party, akin to the adoption of a favorite movie critic. Based on prior experience a responsible voter will seek politicians or a political party that draws conclusions about social policy that are similar to what their own conclusions would have been had they done a complete analysis. But when voters find themselves agreeing with the same party or politician across a number of election cycles, many voters simply trust that the same will continue to be true and &quot;vote the ticket,&quot; also referred to as straight-ticket voting, instead of wasting time on a complete investigation.

==Criticisms==

Much of the empirical support for the idea of rational ignorance was drawn from studies of voter apathy, which reached particularly strong conclusions in the 1950s. However, apathy appeared to decline sharply in the 1960s as concern about issues such as the Vietnam War mounted, and political polarization increased. This is consistent with expectations from Public Choice Theory; as voters&#x27; interest in the results of policy decisions increase, the perceived benefit of the analysis (or the trip to the ballot box) increases, so more people will consider it rational to repair their ignorance.

There also may be situations when &quot;the individual may perceive the situation as one that has carry over benefits to other situations, and treat the learning as a capital investment with payoff beyond the specific situation in which it is presented,&quot; and not a waste of time even though the time invested in the learning my not have immediate payoff. (Denzou and North, 1994).

Additionally, rational ignorance is scrutinized for its broadening effect on the decisions that individuals make in different matters. The investment of time and energy on learning about the specified subject has ramifications on other decision areas. Individuals sometimes ignore this when unconsciously assessing the investment cost versus payout. The external benefits of acquiring knowledge in one area—those benefits occurring in other decision areas—are therefore subject to being overlooked.

<doc id="324889" wikidata="Q523581" url="?curid=324889" title="François-Joseph Fétis">
<text>François-Joseph Fétis (; 25 March 1784 – 26 March 1871) was a Belgian musicologist, critic, teacher and composer. He was among the most influential music intellectuals in continental Europe. His enormous compilation of biographical data in the &quot;Biographie universelle des musiciens&quot; remains an important source of information today.

==Family==
Fétis was born in Mons, Hainaut, eldest son of Antoine-Joseph Fétis and Élisabeth Desprets, daughter of a noted surgeon. He had nine brothers and sisters. His father was titular organist of the noble chapter of Saint-Waltrude. His grandfather was an organ manufacturer. He was trained as a musician by his father and played at young age on the choir organ of Saint Waltrude.

In October 1806 he married Adélaïde Robert, daughter of the French politician Pierre-François-Joseph Robert and Louise-Félicité de Kéralio, friend of Robespierre. They had two sons: the elder son helped his father with the editions of &quot;Revue Musicale&quot; and became member of the Royal Academy, while the younger son was a composer and professor. 

In 1866 his wife died, and he withdrew from the Brussels society and court. When his father died, Eduard inherited his complete library and collection of musical instruments.

== Career ==
His talent for composition manifested itself at the age of seven, and at nine years old he was an organist at Saint Waltrude, Mons. In 1800 he went to Paris and completed his studies at the Conservatory under such masters as Boïeldieu, Jean-Baptiste Rey and Louis-Barthélémy Pradher.

In 1806 he undertook the revision of the Roman liturgical chants in the hope of discovering and establishing their original form. In this year he also began his &quot;Biographie universelle des musiciens&quot;, the most important of his works, which did not appear until 1834.

In 1821 he was appointed professor at the Paris Conservatory. In 1827 he founded the &quot;Revue musicale&quot;, the first serious paper in France devoted exclusively to musical matters. Fétis remained in the French capital till 1833, when at the request of Leopold I, he became director of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels and the king&#x27;s chapelmaster. He also was the founder, and, until his death, the conductor of the celebrated concerts attached to the conservatory of Brussels, and he inaugurated a free series of lectures on musical history and philosophy.

Fétis produced a large quantity of original compositions, from the opera and the oratorio to the simple chanson, including several musical hoaxes, the most famous of which is the &quot;Lute concerto by Valentin Strobel&quot;, premiered with Fernando Sor as soloist. Carcassi, as well as Sor, participated in the performance. The work is attributed not to the Alsascian lutenist Valentin Strobel, but to Jean (Johann) Strobach, a member of a prominent Bohemian family of musicians. This Strobach (fl. 1650–1720) served Leopold I, and there is no evidence that Fétis&#x27;s score is a hoax. The composition was published in 1698, although no copy is known to have survived, except Fétis&#x27; manuscript score, which is in the Royal Conservatory Library in Brussels.

In 1856, he worked closely with Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume in writing a treatise about Antonio Stradivari (&quot;Antoine Stradivari, luthier célèbre&quot;). It includes detailed chapters on the history and development of the violin family, old master Italian violin makers (including the Stradivari and Guarneri families) and an analysis of the bows of François Tourte. His interest in instruments can also be gathered from his very substantial collection, which includes the oldest surviving Arab &quot;oud&quot;.

Fétis had the privilege to have Niccolò Paganini, Robert Schumann, and Hector Berlioz as contemporaries and to work with the violin maker and dealer, Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume. Fétis&#x27;s work provides a unique window into the times and as such is a particularly valuable reference for the modern researcher, dealer and player.

More important perhaps than his compositions are his writings on music. They are partly historical, such as the &quot;Curiosités historiques de la musique&quot; (Paris, 1850), and the &quot;Histoire générale de la musique&quot; (Paris, 1869—1876); and partly theoretical, such as the &quot;Méthode des méthodes de piano&quot; (Paris, 1840), written in conjunction with Moscheles.

While Fétis&#x27;s critical opinions of contemporary music may seem conservative, his musicological work was ground-breaking, and unusual for the 19th century in attempting to avoid an ethnocentric and present-centered viewpoint. Unlike many others at the time, he did not see music history as a continuum of increasing excellence, moving towards a goal, but rather as something which was continually &quot;changing&quot;, neither becoming better nor worse, but continually adapting to new conditions. He believed that all cultures and times created art and music which were appropriate to their times and conditions; and he began a close study of Renaissance music as well as European folk music and music of non-European cultures. Thus Fétis built the foundation for what would later be termed comparative musicology.

Fétis died in Brussels. His valuable library was purchased by the Belgian government and presented to the Royal Library. His historical works, despite many inaccuracies, remain of great value for historians.

His pupils included Luigi Agnesi, Jean-Delphin Alard, Juan Crisóstomo Arriaga, Friedrich Berr, Louise Bertin, William Cusins, Julius Eichberg, Ferdinand Hérold, Frantz Jehin-Prume, Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens, Adolphe Samuel, Charles-Marie Widor, Hippolyte André Jean Baptiste Chélard, Émile Bienaimé, Théodore Labarre, Louis van Waefelghem, Federico Consolo, , , , , , and . 

==Fétis and Berlioz==
Some of his criticisms of contemporary composers have become quite famous, as well as the responses that they engendered. He said of Berlioz, &quot;...what Monsieur Berlioz composes is not part of that art which we distinguish as music, and I am completely certain that he lacks the most basic capability in this art.&quot; In the &quot;Revue musicale&quot; issue of 1 February 1835 he wrote of the &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot;:
Berlioz, who had proof-read Fétis&#x27; editions of the first eight Beethoven symphonies for the publisher Troupenas, commented that

Troupenas did in fact remove Fétis&#x27; editorial marks, but Berlioz was still unsatisfied. He went on to criticize Fétis in one of the monologues of &quot;Lélio, ou le Retour à la vie&quot;, the 1832 sequel to &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot;:
Not one to be outdone, Fétis may have had the last word in this debate. In the 1845 edition of his treatise &quot;La musique mise à la porte de tout le monde&quot;, he describes the word &quot;fantastique&quot; saying that &quot;this word has even slid into music. ‘Fantastique&#x27; music is composed of instrumental effects with no melodic line and incorrect harmony.&quot;

==Theoretical work==
Although known primarily for his contributions to musicology and criticism, Fétis had effects on the realm of music theory as well. In 1841 he put together the first history of harmonic theory, his &quot;Esquisse de l&#x27;histoire de l&#x27;harmonie&quot;. Assembled from individual articles that Fétis published in the &quot;Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris&quot; around 1840, the book predates Hugo Riemann&#x27;s more well known &quot;Geschichte der Musiktheorie&quot; by fifty years. The &quot;Esquisse&quot;, as the title implies, is a general outline rather than an exhaustive study. Fétis is attempting to show the &quot;facts, errors, and truths&quot; of previous theories and theorists, as he interprets them, in order to provide a solid grounding for other scholars and to prevent subsequent interpretive mistakes.

Fétis&#x27; main theoretical work and the culmination of his conceptual frameworks of tonality and harmony is the &quot;Traité complet de la théorie et de la pratique de l&#x27;harmonie&quot; of 1844. This book has influenced later theorists and composers including Paul Hindemith, Ernst Kurth, and Franz Liszt. In the &quot;Musik-Lexicon&quot; of 1882, Hugo Riemann states that &quot;to [Fétis&#x27;] meditations we are indebted for the modern concept of tonality…he found himself emancipated from the spirit of a particular age, and able to render justice to all the various styles of music.&quot; Though some other theorists, most notably Matthew Shirlaw, have had decidedly negative views, Riemann&#x27;s assessment captures the two key features of Fétis&#x27; text. Though he did not coin the term &quot;tonality,&quot; Fétis developed the concept into its present-day form. He claimed that &quot;tonalité&quot; is the primary organizing agent of all melodic and harmonic successions and that the efforts of other theorists to find the fundamental principle of music in &quot;acoustics, mathematics, aggregations of intervals, or classifications of chords have been futile.&quot;

The majority of the &quot;Traité complet&quot; is devoted to explaining how &quot;tonalité&quot; organizes music. The primary factor of determining tonality is the scale. It sets out the order of the succession of tones in major and minor (the only two &quot;tonal&quot; modes which he recognizes), the distances which separate the tones, and the resultant melodic and harmonic tendencies. Tonality is not only a governed and conditioned state, but it is a socially conditioned one. Scales are cultural manifestations, resulting from shared experience and education. Nature provides the elements of tonalité, but human understanding, sensibility, and will determine particular harmonic systems. This concept was called a &quot;Metaphysical principle&quot; by Fétis, though Carl Dahlhaus argues that the term is used in this case to denote an anthropological, culturally relative sense in his 1990 book &quot;Studies on the Origin of Harmonic Tonality&quot;, and theorist Rosalie Schellhous posits that the Kantian term &quot;transcendental&quot; might be more appropriate.

In his comparative work, Fétis attempted &quot;a new method of classifying human races according to their musical systems&quot; following contemporary trends of social darwinism in the emerging fields of ethnology and anthropology.

===Harmonic and rhythmic modulation===
However, if one wishes to interpret Fétis&#x27; metaphysical theory, one of his unique theoretical ideas is laid out in book 3 of the &quot;Traité complet&quot;, that of harmonic modulation. Fétis argues that tonality has evolved over the course of time through four distinct phases, or &quot;ordres&quot;:

*Unitonic – Resulting from plainchant tonality, the unitonic phase consists mainly of consonant triads with no possibility for modulation due to the lack of the tritone between the 4th and 7th scale degrees. This phase is also referred to by Fétis as &quot;tonalité ancienne&quot;.
*Transitonic – Order which began with the introduction of the dominant 7th chord into harmonic discourse, sometime between Zarlino and Monteverdi. This development is also directly related to the codification of cadential systems and periodic phrase structure.
*Pluritonic – Modulation is achieved through enharmonic relationships in which one note of a chord is considered the point of contact between different scales. Fétis claims that Mozart was the first to use such modulations as a means of expression. In this order, the diminished 7th and augmented 6th chords become important as they can modulate to several different tonalities.
*Omnitonic – The final phase of tonality, and one embodied for Fétis by Wagner, where the alteration of the intervals of natural chords and modification by substitution of notes is so complex that it becomes impossible to identify the original chord. This is seen as a period of extremes, and undesirable compared to the moderately chromatic music of Meyerbeer.

Fétis later applied this same system of ordres to rhythm, &quot;the least advanced part of music...[where] great things remain to be discovered.&quot; Though he did not publish these theories in any of his treatises, they appear in several articles for the &quot;Revue musicale&quot; and in some lectures which had a profound impact on Liszt. Though music had not yet made it past the first phase, Unirhythm, by Fétis&#x27; time, he argues that composers may be able to &quot;mutate&quot; from one meter to another within the same melodic phrase. Though Liszt may have been an open disciple of the ideas of the Omnitonic and Omnirhythmic, the influence of such thinking can perhaps be seen most clearly in the music of Brahms, where hemiola and mixing of time signatures is a common occurrence.

==&quot;Se i miei sospiri&quot;==
The Italian art song, &quot;Se i miei sospiri&quot;, appeared in a Paris concert organized by Fétis in 1833. Fétis published the piece for voice and strings in 1838 and then again in 1843 for voice and piano with alternate lyrics (&quot;Pietà, Signore&quot;). It is these alternate lyrics with which the piece is now typically associated. Fétis attributed the song to Alessandro Stradella and claimed to possess an original manuscript of the work but never produced it for examination. As early as 1866, musicologists were questioning the authenticity of the song, and when Fétis&#x27; library was acquired by the Royal Library in Brussels after his death, no such manuscript could be found. Owing to this and the fact that the style of the piece is inconsistent with Stradella&#x27;s own period, the authorship of the piece is now typically attributed to Fétis himself. The original Italian text for the song (Se i miei sospiri) was found set to different music by Alessandro Scarlatti in his 1693 oratorio &quot;The Martyrdom of St. Theodosia&quot;.

<doc id="324892" wikidata="Q890351" url="?curid=324892" title="Bofors scandal">
<text>The Bofors scandal was a major weapons-contract political scandal that occurred between India and Sweden during the 1980s and 1990s, initiated by Indian National Congress politicians and implicating the Indian prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, and several other members of the Indian and Swedish governments. These politicians were accused of receiving kickbacks from Bofors AB, an arms manufacturer principally financed by the Wallenberg family&#x27;s Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, for winning a bid to supply to India the company&#x27;s 155 mm field howitzer – the sale of 410 field howitzers, and a supply contract for almost twice that amount, totalling a US$1.4 billion deal. It was the biggest arms deal ever in Sweden, and money marked for development projects was diverted to secure this contract at any cost. The investigations revealed flouting of rules and bypassing of institutions.

On 16 April 1987, a Swedish radio station broke a story, sourced from a whistleblower in the Swedish police, alleging that the reputed Swedish artillery manufacturer Bofors had paid kickbacks to people in several countries, including Sweden and India, to secure a contract. This had been done the previous year for a deal to supply 410 155 mm calibre howitzers for the Indian army. However, none of the newspapers in India were aware of this. In May 1987, a broadcast by a Swedish radio station revealed that bribes of had been paid by Bofors to Indian politicians, members of the Congress party and bureaucrats. This was picked up by a young journalist from &quot;The Hindu&quot;, Chitra Subramaniam, who happened to be in Sweden at that time, covering another story. The scale of the corruption was far worse than any that Sweden and India had seen before and directly led to the defeat of Gandhi&#x27;s ruling Indian National Congress party in the November 1989 general elections. The Swedish company paid in kickbacks to top Indian politicians and key defence officials.

The case came to light during Vishwanath Pratap Singh&#x27;s tenure as defence minister, and was revealed through investigative journalism tipped off by a Reuters news revelation on Swedish radio, followed up by a team led by N. Ram of the newspaper &quot;The Hindu&quot;. Subramaniam, reporting for &quot;The Hindu&quot;, secured the over 350 documents that detailed the payoffs. Later the articles were published in &quot;The Indian Express&quot; and &quot;The Statesman&quot; when &quot;The Hindu&quot; stopped publishing stories about the Bofors scandal under immense government pressure and Subramaniam moved to the two newspapers. In an interview with her, published in &quot;The Hoot&quot; in April 2012 on the 25th anniversary of the revelations, Sten Lindström, former chief of Swedish police, discussed why he had leaked the documents to her and the role of whistle-blowers in a democracy.

==Chronology of events and investigation==
1977 - As a response to reports that Pakistan wants to acquire brand new American long-range 155-mm M198 howitzers (which was actually withheld due to US political concerns), India requested Bofors and six other manufacturers to suggest their towed howitzers.

Early 1981 - four howitzers were shortlisted to participate in the field trials: FH-77B, FH-70, GHN-45 and GIAT-155 TR.

1985 - FH-70 and GHN-45 were eliminated from the trials.

24 March 1986 - A $285 million contract between the Government of India and Swedish arms company Bofors was signed for supply of 410 155 mm Howitzer field guns. 

16 April 1987 - Swedish Radio alleged that Bofors paid kickbacks to people from a number of countries including top Swedish and Indian politicians and key defence officials to seal the deal.

1987 - As a result of the revelations, the Indian government blacklisted Bofors, preventing the company from doing business in India. The middleman associated with the scandal was Ottavio Quattrocchi, an Italian businessman who represented the petrochemicals firm Snamprogetti. Quattrocchi was reportedly close to the family of Rajiv Gandhi and emerged as a powerful broker in the 1980s between big businesses and the Indian government. 

21 May 1991 - While the case was being investigated, Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated for unrelated reasons by the LTTE. 

1997 - The Swiss banks released some 500 documents after years of legal battle.

1999 - The Indian government lifted its ban on Bofors. The lifting of the ban came during the Kargil War, when the Bofors guns proved to be efficient but were crippled by a shortage of spare parts.

22 October 1999 - When National Democratic Alliance government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed the first chargesheet against Quattrocchi, Win Chadha, Rajiv Gandhi, the defence secretary S. K. Bhatnagar and a number of others. 

2001 - Win Chadha and S. K. Bhatnagar died.

10 June 2002 - Delhi High Court quashed all proceedings in the case so far. However, this was reversed by Supreme Court of India on 7 July 2003.

2004 - 2005 - The central government changed and Indian National Congress came to power after 2004 Lok Sabha elections. On 5 February 2004, the Delhi High Court quashed the charges of bribery against Rajiv Gandhi and others. In December 2005, B. Daat, the Additional Solicitor General of India, acting on behalf of the Indian Government and the CBI, requested the British Government that two British bank accounts of Quattrocchi be unfrozen on the grounds of insufficient evidence to link these accounts to the Bofors payoff. The two accounts, containing €3 million and $1 million, had been frozen.

16 January 2006 - The Indian Supreme Court directed the Indian government to ensure that Quattrocchi did not withdraw money from the two bank accounts in London. CBI claimed in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court that they were still pursuing extradition orders for Quattrocchi. The Interpol, at the request of the CBI, has a long-standing red corner notice to arrest Quattrocchi.

23 January 2006 - The CBI, the Indian federal law enforcement agency, admitted that roughly ₹210 million (about US$4.6 million), in the two accounts have already been withdrawn by the accused. The British government released the funds later. 

6 February 2007 - Quattrocchi was detained in Argentina on 6 February 2007, but the news of his detention was released by the CBI only on 23 February. Quattrocchi was released by Argentinian police. However, his passport was impounded and he was not allowed to leave the country. As there was no extradition treaty between India and Argentina, the case was presented in the Argentine Supreme Court. The government of India lost the extradition case as the government of India did not provide a key court order which was the basis of Quattrocchi&#x27;s arrest. In the aftermath, the government did not appeal this decision because of delays in securing an official English translation of the court&#x27;s decision.

4 March 2011 - A Delhi court provided temporary relief to Quattrocchi from the case, for lack of sufficient evidence against him.

12 July 2013 - Quattrochi died of heart attack in Milan.

Despite the controversy, the Bofors gun was used extensively as the primary field artillery during the Kargil War with Pakistan and gave India &#x27;an edge&#x27; against Pakistan according to battlefield commanders.

In his book, &quot;Unknown Facets of Rajiv Gandhi, Jyoti Basu and Indrajit Gupta&quot;, released in November 2013, former CBI director Dr A P Mukherjee wrote that Rajiv Gandhi wanted commission paid by defence suppliers to be used exclusively for the purpose of meeting expenses of running the Congress party. Mukherjee said Gandhi explained his position in a meeting on 19 June 1989, during a meeting between the two at the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence. However, as per Sten Lindstrom, the former head of Swedish police, who led the investigations, they did not find anything to suggest that payments had been received by Rajiv Gandhi. He was, however, guilty of knowing about the kickbacks and not taking action on them.

==Political effects==
The Bofors scandal was a major issue that was highlighted in subsequent elections, which led to the Congress losing power. Though it was widely believed that V. P. Singh resigned from Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s cabinet due to the Bofors scandal, Singh clarified that he had resigned due to differences in the cabinet in commissions taken by Indian agents in the HDW submarine deal (Shishumar class).

==Middlemen in Indian arms deals==
Middlemen were employed in arms deals in India, both during the British Raj as well as in independent India, and commissions were paid to them under various headings and guises. Some of these were paid as personal bribes while others were paid as contributions to political parties. This led to high levels of corruption, and payments being made to politicians, bureaucrats and defence personnel to influence decisions. The political controversies caused by the Bofors Scandal, led to the banning of middlemen in arms deals.

In 2015, the Government of India under the Narendra Modi government made the use of middlemen in arms deals legal, if they called themselves &quot;company representatives&quot;. The then defence minister Manohar Parrikar announced that in such cases, middlemen would be paid by the government for fixing arms deals under the name of &quot;legal fees&quot;.

==Allegations against CBI==
A former cabinet minister of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Arun Jaitley, criticised the manner in which CBI has handled this case, including:
*Delay in lodging an FIR
*Delay in sending letter rogatories
*Not appealing against the judgement of the Delhi High Court in 2004
*De-freezing of Quattrocchi&#x27;s bank account in London by saying to the Crown Prosecutor that there is no case against Quattrocchi
*Putting up a very weak case for Quattrocchi&#x27;s extradition from Argentina. Subsequently, no appeal against lower court&#x27;s verdict
*The withdrawal of the Interpol Red Corner notice
*Finally, withdrawal of its case against Quattrocchi. Reacting to this, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vinod Yadav said that, &quot;I agree that there are certain malafide intentions in the case and there is no doubt in that&quot;

==Closure==
The closure of Bofors case was full of twists and turns. In 2004, Delhi High Court posthumously gave clean chit to Rajiv Gandhi and said that there was no case of corruption against him or any public servant. This judgement stunned CBI as it had pursued the case for 14 years and was a setback to NDA government headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee as well. However, CBI said that it would contest the judgement in Supreme Court. 

In 2011, a Delhi court allowed CBI to close the case. Thereafter in 2012, Swedish police chief Sten Lindstrom, who led the investigations and identified himself as the whistleblower, said that Rajiv Gandhi had done nothing wrong and also cleared Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan and his family from any involvement in the scandal. Instead, he accused Swedish government of diverting funds marked for development projects to secure the deal by flouting the rules and bypassing the institutions.

<doc id="324896" wikidata="Q27074953" url="?curid=324896" title="Pink cockatoo">
<text>The pink cockatoo (Cacatua leadbeateri), also known as Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo or Leadbeater&#x27;s cockatoo, is a medium-sized cockatoo that inhabits arid and semi-arid inland areas across Australia, with the exception of the north east.

==Taxonomy and naming==
Irish naturalist Nicholas Aylward Vigors described the species in 1831 as &quot;Plyctolophus leadbeateri&quot;. The scientific name commemorates the London naturalist and taxidermist Benjamin Leadbeater, who had given Vigors what would become the type specimen. Edward Lear painted it in his 1832 work &quot;Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots&quot;. Citing Lear, William Swainson gave it the name &quot;Plyctolophus erythropterus&quot;.

The pink cockatoo is more closely related to &quot;Cacatua&quot; than is the galah. Its lineage diverged around the time of or shortly after the acquisition of the long crest; probably the former as this crest type is not found in all &quot;Cacatua&quot; cockatoos, so must have been present in an early or incipient stage at the time of the divergence of the pink cockatoo&#x27;s ancestors. Like the galah, this species has not lost the ability to deposit diluted pigment dyes in its body plumage, although it does not produce melanin colouration anymore, resulting in a lighter bird overall compared to the galah. Indeed, disregarding the crest, the pink cockatoo looks almost like a near-leucistic version of that species. Another indication of the early divergence of this species from the &quot;white&quot; cockatoo lineage is the presence of features found otherwise only in corellas, such as its plaintive yodeling cry, as well as others which are unique to pink and the true white cockatoos, for example the large crest and rounded wing shape.

In 2023, this species was reclassified into the genus &quot;Cacatua&quot; by the International Ornithological Congress; although it represents a very basally diverging member of the clade, it shares close morphological, behavioural, and vocal features to other members of the genus. Due to this, the former genus &quot;Lophochroa&quot; may be better considered a monotypic subgenus of &quot;Cacatua&quot;.

Prior to 2023, &quot;Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo&quot; was designated the official name for this species by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC). &quot;Pink cockatoo&quot; was its official name (with Major Mitchell as an alternative) in the 1926 official RAOU checklist, and was reinstated as the official name in 2023 following the IOC&#x27;s taxonomic change. The bird became linked to Major Thomas Mitchell after he described the species in glowing terms in his books on his expeditions, calling it the &quot;cockatoo of the interior&quot;. Mitchell himself called it the red-top cockatoo. Before this John Gould had called it Leadbeater&#x27;s cockatoo (derived from the species name) in 1848, as had Lear in 1832. Gould added that people of the Swan River Colony called it pink cockatoo, and recorded an indigenous name &quot;Jak-kul-yak-kul&quot;. Other names include desert cockatoo, and chockalott, chock-a-lock, joggle-joggle, and wee juggler, the last anglicised from the Wiradjuri &quot;wijugla&quot;. In Central Australia south of Alice Springs, the Pitjantjatjara term is &quot;kakalyalya&quot;. Names recorded from South Australia include &quot;kukkalulla&quot; (Kokatha dialect of Western Desert language), &quot;nkuna&quot; and &quot;ungkuna&quot; (Arrernte), &quot;yangkunnu&quot; (Barngarla), and &quot;yangwina&quot; (Wirangu), and &quot;yel-le-lek&quot; (from the Wimmera), and &quot;cal-drin-ga&quot; (from the lower Murray).

BirdLife Australia officially renamed Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo back to &quot;pink cockatoo&quot; in 2023, due to Mitchell&#x27;s involvement in the massacre of Aboriginal people at Mount Dispersion and a general trend to make species names more culturally inclusive.

== Description ==

The pink cockatoo has a soft-textured white and salmon-pink plumage and large, bright red and yellow crest. Its former name referenced Major Thomas Mitchell, who wrote, &quot;Few birds more enliven the monotonous hues of the Australian forest than this beautiful species whose pink-coloured wings and flowing crest might have embellished the air of a more voluptuous region.&quot; Pink cockatoo females and males are almost identical. The males are usually bigger. The female has a broader yellow stripe on the crest and develop a red eye when mature.

=== Reproduction and lifespan ===
The bird reaches sexual maturity around 3–4 years old. The oldest recorded pink cockatoo died at 83 years old.

== Distribution and habitat ==
In contrast to those of the galah, populations of pink cockatoos have declined rather than increased as a result of man-made changes to the arid interior of Australia. Where galahs readily occupy cleared and part-cleared land, pink cockatoos require extensive woodlands, particularly favouring conifers (&quot;Callitris&quot; spp.), sheoak (&quot;Allocasuarina&quot; spp.) and eucalypts. Unlike other cockatoos, pink cockatoo pairs will not nest close to one another, so they cannot tolerate fragmented, partly cleared habitats, and their range is contracting.

In the Mallee region of Victoria where the galah and pink cockatoo can be found to be nesting in the same area, the two species have interbred and produced hybridised offspring occasionally.

The pink cockatoo is usually found in pairs or small groups, and feeds both on the ground and in trees.

==Conservation status==

===Australia===
The pink cockatoo is listed as endangered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

===Victoria===
* The pink cockatoo is listed as a threatened species on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988). Under this Act, an &quot;Action Statement&quot; for the recovery and future management of this species has been prepared.
* On the 2013 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, this species is listed as vulnerable.

==Aviculture ==
&quot;Cookie&quot; was a pink cockatoo and a beloved resident of Illinois&#x27; Brookfield Zoo near Chicago from the time the zoo opened in 1934 until his death on 27 August 2016. Cookie was 83 years old and he had been retired from public display since 2009 due to ill health prior to his death.

<text>A regional airliner or a feeder liner is a small airliner that is designed to fly up to 100 passengers on short-haul flights, usually feeding larger carriers&#x27; airline hubs from small markets. This class of airliners is typically flown by the regional airlines that are either contracted by or subsidiaries of the larger airlines. Regional airliners are used for short trips between smaller towns or from a larger city to a smaller city. Feeder liner, commuter, and local service are all alternative terms for the same class of flight operations.

==History==
To keep short routes economical, airlines preferred using second hand aircraft than costlier new aircraft. Older aircraft were put into short haul service as they were replaced by new longer-range designs.

=== Post-war era ===
Propeller aircraft of larger airlines were transferred to smaller airlines. Examples included the De Havilland Dragon Rapide biplane and the Douglas DC-3s, in large surplus after the war, which the aircraft manufacturers wanted to replace.

The first piston-powered airliners with 40 seats were the Martin 2-0-2s (introduced in 1947) and Convair CV-240s (1948).

===Turboprop designs===
The first turboprop powered aircraft emerged like the Vickers Viscount (75 seats, introduced in 1953) and Fokker F27 (44–52 seats, 1958). Some smaller turboprop airliners were developed in the 1960s like the British Shorts Skyvan (19 seats, 1963), and French Nord 262 (29 seats, 1964) or Brazilian Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante (1973). This &quot;hand-me-down&quot; process of supplying aircraft continued with designs like the Convair 440 and Douglas DC-6 also serving in this role while the first jets were introduced.

By the mid-1950s, demand for even more economical designs led to the production of the first custom feeder liners. These were almost always turboprops, which had fuel economy on par with piston engine designs, but had far lower maintenance costs. Often, the time between engine overhaul periods was five times that of the best piston engines. Early examples of these designs include the Fokker F27 Friendship, Avro 748, and Handley Page Dart Herald.

These designs were so successful that it was to be many years before newer designs bettered them enough to make it worthwhile in terms of capital investment to develop. Among the first purpose-built airliners developed for the CAB sanctioned local-service airlines in the US, the predecessors of the modern regional airliner industry; was the interim and custom-built Fairchild F-27/FH-227&#x27;s for the needs of these smaller but expanding airlines of the late 1960s.

There were a few other exceptions, generally tailored to more specific roles. For instance, the Handley Page Jetstream (first flight in 1968) was intended for fewer passengers at much higher speeds, displacing smaller designs like the Beechcraft Queen Air. The Fairchild/Swearingen Metro (developed from the original Queen Air through a number of stages) filled a similar niche.

By the 1970s, the first-generation regional airliners were starting to wear out, but there had been little effort in producing new designs for this market. A varied list of light transport aircraft supplanted by newer and more modern 30-seat designs by Shorts with their Shorts 330 and 360 as well as other aircraft manufacturers, replaced and sometimes provided growth to established commuter markets. Additional development came to the regional airline industry with the arrival of some of the earlier De Havilland Canada types such as the Dash 7 delivered in 1978, but this was tailored more to the short-range and STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing) role than as a regional airliner. Feedback from the airlines was fairly consistent, and De Havilland responded with the Dash 8 in 1984, which had economic benefits over the earlier generation machines and was faster and quieter as well.

In the early 1980s, the Dash 8&#x27;s success sparked off development of a number of similar designs, including the ATR 42/72, Saab 340, Embraer Brasilia and Fokker 50. Consequently, there were a relatively large number of aircraft offered by manufacturers in this sector of the market, pushing older 1950s designs from Fokker, Vickers and others into retirement. Due to the high level of competition, production of a number of these types ceased. Saab AB exited the civil aviation market and wrote its debts off, Daimler-Benz Aerospace &quot;pulled the plug&quot; on Dornier, and British Aerospace ended production of their BAe Jetstream 41 after 100 delivered. By 2006 only the ATR 42/72 models and the Dash 8 remained in production.

Turboprop airliner deliveries are correlated with oil prices with a lag of a few years.

In 2018, 245.4 million two-way seats were offered on turboprop flights, up from 201.4 million in 2009, with 97% of flights below and 87% below , and an average capacity increasing to 51 seats from 44 seats in 2009.
The largest user was Air Canada with 12.7 million seats, followed by Flybe with 10.3 million and Wings Air with 9.24 million.
Canada was the largest market with 30.5 million seats, then Indonesia with 14.3 and the US with 13.4.
The busiest turboprop airport was Vancouver (2.75 Million seats) followed by Toronto Pearson (2.64) then Seattle-Tacoma (2.39).

===Noise===

Although turboprops are quiet to outside observers, prop wash makes them noisy inside. 
Active noise reduction should reduce the cabin noise of the Bombardier Q400 or the ATR 72-600.

=== Market forecast ===

Flight Global fleet forecasts for the 2016–2035 period estimate 3,081 turboprop deliveries with a $63 billion value and 4,042 regional jet deliveries for a $130 billion value. Embraer claims crossover regional jets are more cost-efficient than current turboprops beyond , routes that represented 45% of 70-seat turboprops flights in 2017. This has led Widerøe to deploy Embraer E-Jet E2s on longer routes (except for destinations with short runways and severe weather conditions north of the Arctic Circle) and AirBaltic to replace its fleet of 12 Dash 8 Q400s with Airbus 220s.
From 2018 to 2037, ATR forecasts 3,020 turboprop deliveries: 630 with 40–60 seats and 2,390 with 61–80 seats.

=== Hybrid aircraft ===

As legacy regional aircraft are used on very short sectors like connecting islands, their replacements could be hybrid or electric aircraft.
Hybrid-electric aircraft propulsion remains impeded by energy storage, high-power electric distribution and the lack of certification framework.
ATR Aircraft dismiss a fully electric propulsion as carrying the same payload over the same distances as an ATR 42, current batteries would weigh .

Current projects are small 10-seaters, like the Israeli Eviation Alice or the Boeing-backed Zunum Aero ZA12 powered by a Safran Ardiden turboshaft and targeting 40-80% lower operating costs.
The French VoltAero Cassio based on the Cessna 337 Skymaster like the U.S. Ampaire, U.S. Wright Electric works with Spain’s Axter Aerospace to re-engine a nine-seater and the Cessna Caravan is re-engined with a MagniX electric motor.
United Technologies is re-engining a Dash 8 Q100 on one side with a gas turbine and a electric motor instead of the current Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW121, for at least 30% energy savings.

A project of larger scale is currently under development by Swedish startup company, Heart Aerospace, which is aiming to build a 30-seater hybrid-electric regional airliner, the ES-30. The company revealed its demonstrator aircraft in 2024, the Heart X1, and is expected to undertake electric flight mid-2025.

==Design==
===Turboprop regional aircraft===
Regional airlines serving small hubs or airports with short runways will often use turboprop aircraft with propeller engines versus jet engines. de Havilland Canada (Dash 7 and Dash 8), Antonov (An-24 and An-140), Xi&#x27;an Aircraft Industrial Corporation (MA60, MA600 and MA700) and ATR (ATR 42 and ATR 72) are manufacturers of this type.

===Regional jets===


A regional jet (RJ) is a jet airliner with less than 100 seats. The first one was the Sud-Aviation Caravelle in 1959, followed by the widespread Yakovlev Yak-40, Fokker F-28 and BAe 146. The 1990s saw the emergence of the Canadair Regional Jet and its Embraer Regional Jet counterpart, then the larger Embraer E-Jet family and multiple competing projects. In the US, they are limited in size by scope clauses.

===Accommodation===
Seating on regional airliners tends to be narrow and tight, and passengers typically are restricted from bringing on board carry-on items which would fit without difficulty in the overhead bins of larger aircraft. Often carry-on luggage is collected immediately prior to boarding and placed in the cargo hold, where it can be quickly retrieved by the ground staff while the passengers exit. Compared with bigger planes, many frequent fliers find regional jets cabins cramped and uncomfortable, with a lower ceiling, tight seating and single-class cabins forbidding a first-class upgrade.

==Operations==
===Costs===

In the US, major carriers contracts with regional airlines on a per-flight basis regardless of the number of passengers, and the major carrier keep the ticket revenue. These contracts are typically 10-year terms, the regional aircraft operators are certain of their revenue and have to control their costs to earn a return, but they face airline bankruptcies, fleet reductions, and increasing operating costs. Major carriers avoid shouldering losses from regional aircraft operators and competition between regional airlines has grounded many regional aircraft.

<doc id="324904" wikidata="Q506505" url="?curid=324904" title="The Comedy of Errors">
<text>The Comedy of Errors is one of William Shakespeare&#x27;s early plays. It is his shortest and one of his most farcical comedies, with a major part of the humour coming from slapstick and mistaken identity, in addition to puns and word play. It has been adapted for opera, stage, screen and musical theatre numerous times worldwide. In the centuries following its premiere, the play&#x27;s title has entered the popular English lexicon as an idiom for &quot;an event or series of events made ridiculous by the number of errors that were made throughout&quot;.

Set in the Greek city of Ephesus, &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; tells the story of two sets of identical twins who were accidentally separated at birth. Antipholus of Syracuse and his servant, Dromio of Syracuse, arrive in Ephesus, which turns out to be the home of their twin brothers, Antipholus of Ephesus and his servant, Dromio of Ephesus. When the Syracusans encounter the friends and families of their twins, a series of wild mishaps based on mistaken identities lead to wrongful beatings, a near-seduction, the arrest of Antipholus of Ephesus, and false accusations of infidelity, theft, madness, and demonic possession.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
Because a law forbids merchants from Syracuse from entering Ephesus, elderly Syracusan trader Aegeon faces execution when he is discovered in the city. He can only escape by paying a fine of a thousand marks. He tells his sad story to Solinus, Duke of Ephesus. In his youth, Aegeon married and had twin sons. On the same day, a poor woman without a job also gave birth to twin boys, and he purchased these as servants to his sons. Soon afterward, the family made a sea voyage and was hit by a tempest. Aegeon lashed himself to the main-mast with one son and one servant, and his wife took the other two infants. His wife was rescued by one boat, Aegeon by another. Aegeon never again saw his wife or the children with her. Recently his son Antipholus, now grown, and his son&#x27;s servant, Dromio, left Syracuse to find their brothers. When Antipholus did not return, Aegeon set out in search of him. The Duke is moved by this story and grants Aegeon one day to pay his fine.

That same day, Antipholus arrives in Ephesus, searching for his brother. He sends Dromio to deposit some money at The Centaur, an inn. He is confounded when the identical Dromio of Ephesus appears almost immediately, denying any knowledge of the money and asking him home to dinner, where his wife is waiting. Antipholus, thinking his servant is making insubordinate jokes, beats Dromio of Ephesus.

===Act II===
Dromio of Ephesus returns to his mistress, Adriana, saying that her &quot;husband&quot; refused to come back to his house, and even pretended not to know her. Adriana, concerned that her husband&#x27;s eye is straying, takes this news as confirmation of her suspicions.

Antipholus of Syracuse, who complains &quot;I could not speak with Dromio since at first, I sent him from the mart,&quot; meets up with Dromio of Syracuse who now denies making a &quot;joke&quot; about Antipholus having a wife. Antipholus begins beating him. Suddenly, Adriana rushes up to Antipholus of Syracuse and begs him not to leave her. The Syracusans cannot but attribute these strange events to witchcraft, remarking that Ephesus is known as a warren for witches. Antipholus and Dromio go off with this strange woman, the one to eat dinner and the other to keep the gate.

===Act III===
Inside the house, Antipholus of Syracuse discovers that he is very attracted to his &quot;wife&#x27;s&quot; sister, Luciana, telling her &quot;train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note / To drown me in thy sister&#x27;s flood of tears.&quot; She is flattered by his attention but worried about their moral implications. After she exits, Dromio of Syracuse announces that he has discovered that he has a wife: Nell, a hideous kitchen-maid. The Syracusans decide to leave as soon as possible, and Dromio runs off to make travel plans. Antipholus of Syracuse is then confronted by Angelo of Ephesus, a goldsmith, who claims that Antipholus ordered a chain from him. Antipholus is forced to accept the chain, and Angelo says that he will return for payment.

Antipholus of Ephesus returns home for dinner and is enraged to find that he is rudely refused entry to his own house by Dromio of Syracuse, who is keeping the gate. He is ready to break down the door, but his friends persuade him not to make a scene. He decides, instead, to dine with a courtesan.

===Act IV===
Antipholus of Ephesus dispatches Dromio of Ephesus to purchase a rope so that he can beat his wife Adriana for locking him out, then is accosted by Angelo, who tells him &quot;I thought to have ta&#x27;en you at the Porpentine&quot; and asks to be reimbursed for the chain. He denies ever seeing it and is promptly arrested. As he is being led away, Dromio of Syracuse arrives, whereupon Antipholus dispatches him back to Adriana&#x27;s house to get money for his bail. After completing this errand, Dromio of Syracuse mistakenly delivers the money to Antipholus of Syracuse. The Courtesan spies Antipholus wearing the gold chain, and says he promised it to her in exchange for her ring. The Syracusans deny this and flee. The Courtesan resolves to tell Adriana that her husband is insane. Dromio of Ephesus returns to the arrested Antipholus of Ephesus, with the rope. Antipholus is infuriated. Adriana, Luciana, and the Courtesan enter with a conjurer named Pinch, who tries to exorcize the Ephesians, who are bound and taken to Adriana&#x27;s house. The Syracusans enter, carrying swords, and everybody runs off for fear: believing that they are the Ephesians, out for vengeance after somehow escaping their bonds. 

===Act V===
Adriana reappears with henchmen, who attempt to bind the Syracusans. They take sanctuary in a nearby priory, where the Abbess resolutely protects them. Suddenly, the Abbess enters with the Syracusan twins, and everyone begins to understand the confused events of the day. Not only are the two sets of twins reunited, but the Abbess reveals that she is Aegeon’s wife, Emilia. The Duke pardons Aegeon. All exit into the abbey to celebrate the reunification of the family.

==Text and date==

The play is a modernised adaptation of &quot;Menaechmi&quot; by Plautus. As William Warner&#x27;s translation of the classical drama was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company on 10 June 1594, published in 1595, and dedicated to Lord Hunsdon, the patron of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, it has been supposed that Shakespeare might have seen the translation in manuscript before it was printed – though it is equally possible that he knew the play in the original Latin.

The play contains a topical reference to the wars of succession in France, which would fit any date from 1589 to 1595. Charles Whitworth argues that &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; was written &quot;in the latter part of 1594&quot; on the basis of historical records and textual similarities with other plays Shakespeare wrote around this time. The play was not published until it appeared in the First Folio in 1623.

==Analysis and criticism==
For centuries, scholars have found little thematic depth in &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;. Harold Bloom, however, wrote that it &quot;reveals Shakespeare&#x27;s magnificence at the art of comedy&quot;, and praised the work as showing &quot;such skill, indeed mastery – in action, incipient character, and stagecraft – that it far outshines the three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays and the rather lame comedy &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;&quot;. Stanley Wells also referred to it as the first Shakespeare play &quot;in which mastery of craft is displayed&quot;. The play was not a particular favourite on the eighteenth-century stage because it failed to offer the kind of striking roles that actors such as David Garrick could exploit.

The play was particularly notable in one respect. In the earlier eighteenth century, some critics followed the French critical standard of judging the quality of a play by its adherence to the classical unities, as specified by Aristotle in the fourth century BC. &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot; were the only two of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays to comply with this standard.

Law professor Eric Heinze, however, argues that particularly notable in the play is a series of social relationships, which is in crisis as it sheds its feudal forms and confronts the market forces of early modern Europe.

==Performance==
Two early performances of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; are recorded. One, by &quot;a company of base and common fellows&quot;, is mentioned in the &quot;Gesta Grayorum&quot; (&quot;The Deeds of Gray&quot;) as having occurred in Gray&#x27;s Inn Hall on 28 December 1594 during the inn&#x27;s revels. The second also took place on &quot;Innocents&#x27; Day&quot;, but ten years later: 28 December 1604, at Court.

==Adaptations==
===Theatrical===
Like many of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; was adapted and rewritten extensively, particularly from the 18th century on, with varying reception from audiences.

==== Classical adaptations ====
* &quot;Every Body Mistaken&quot; is a 1716 &quot;revival&quot; and directorial adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s play by an anonymous author. 
* &quot;See If You Like It&quot;; &quot;or, &#x27;Tis All a Mistake&quot;, an anonymous adaptation staged in 1734 at Covent Garden, performed in two acts with text from Plautus and Shakespeare. Shakespeare purists considered it to be the &quot;worst alteration&quot; available.
* &quot;The Twins,&quot; by Thomas Hull produced an adaptation for Covent Garden in 1739, where Hull played Aegon. This production was more faithful to Shakespeare&#x27;s text, and played for several years. This adaptation was performed only once in 1762, and was published in 1770. Hull adapted the play a second time as &quot;The Comedy of Errors. With Alterations from Shakespeare.&quot; This version was staged frequently from 1779 onward, and was published in 1793. Hull added songs, intensified the love interest, and elaborated the recognition scene. He also expanded roles for women, including Adriana&#x27;s cousin Hermia, who sang various songs.
* &quot;The Twins; or, Which is Which? A Farce. In Three Acts&quot; by William Woods, published in 1780. Produced at the Theatre-Royal, Edinburgh. This adaptation reduced the play to a three-act farce, apparently believing that a longer run time should &quot;pall upon an audience.&quot; John Philip Kemble (see below) seemed to have extended and based his own adaptation upon &quot;The Twins.&quot;
* &quot;Oh! It&#x27;s Impossible&quot; by John Philip Kemble, was produced in 1780. This adaptation caused a stir by casting the two Dromios as black-a-moors. It was acted in York, but not printed. Later, nearly 20 years after slavery had been abolished within British domains, James Boaden wrote, &quot;I incline to think [Kemble&#x27;s] maturer judgement would certainly have consigned the whole impression to the flames.&quot;)

==== Modern adaptations ====
* The Flying Karamazov Brothers performed a unique adaptation, produced by Robert Woodruff, first at the Goodman Theater in Chicago in 1983, and then again in 1987 at New York&#x27;s Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center. This latter presentation was filmed and aired on MTV and PBS.
* &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; adapted and directed by Sean Graney in 2010 updated Shakespeare&#x27;s text to modern language, with occasional Shakespearean text, for The Court Theatre. The play appears to be more of a &quot;translation&quot; into modern-esque language, than a reimagination. The play received mixed reviews, mostly criticizing Graney&#x27;s modern interpolations and abrupt ending.
* &quot;15 Villainous Fools,&quot; written and performed by Olivia Atwood and Maggie Seymour, a two-woman clown duo, produced by The 601 Theatre Company. The play was performed several times, premiering in 2015 at Bowdoin College, before touring fringe festivals including Portland, San Diego, Washington, DC, Providence, and New York City. Following this run, the show was picked up by the People&#x27;s Improv Theater for an extended run. While the play included pop culture references and original raps, it kept true to Shakespeare&#x27;s text for the characters of the Dromios.
* &quot;A Comedy of Heirors, or The Imposters&quot; by feminist verse playwright, Emily C. A. Snyder, performed a staged reading through Turn to Flesh Productions in 2017, featuring Abby Wilde as Glorielle of Syracuse. The play received acclaim, being named a finalist with the American Shakespeare Center, as part of the Shakespeare&#x27;s New Contemporaries program, as well as &quot;The Top 15 NYC Plays of &#x27;17&quot; by &quot;A Work Unfinishing.&quot; The play focuses on two sets of female twins, who also interact with Shakespeare&#x27;s Antipholi. The play is in conversation with several of Shakespeare&#x27;s comedies, including characters from &quot;The Comedy of Errors, Twelfth Night, As You Like It,&quot; and &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;.

===Opera===
* On 27 December 1786, the opera &quot;Gli equivoci&quot; by Stephen Storace received its première at the Burgtheater in Vienna. The libretto, by Lorenzo da Ponte, Mozart&#x27;s frequent librettist, worked off a French translation of Shakespeare&#x27;s play, follows the play&#x27;s plot fairly closely, though some characters were renamed, Aegeon and Emilia are cut, and Euphemio (previously Antipholus) and Dromio are shipwrecked on Ephesus.
* Frederic Reynolds staged an operatic version in 1819, with music by Henry Bishop supplemented lyrics from various Shakespeare plays, and sonnets set to melodies by Mozart, Thomas Arne, and others. The opera was performed at Covent Gardens under Charles Kemble&#x27;s management. The opera included several additional scenes from the play, which were considered necessary for the sake of introducing songs. The same operatic adaptation was revived in 1824 for Drury Lane. 
* Various other adaptations were performed down to 1855 when Samuel Phelps revived the Shakespearean original at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre. 
* The Czech composer Iša Krejčí&#x27;s 1943 opera &quot;Pozdvižení v Efesu&quot; (Turmoil in Ephesus) is based on the play.

===Musicals===
The play has been adapted as a musical several times, frequently by inserting period music into the light comedy. Some musical adaptations include a Victorian musical comedy (Arts Theatre, Cambridge, England, 1951), Brechtian folk opera (Arts Theatre, London, 1956), and a two-ring circus (Delacorte Theater, New York, 1967).

Fully original musical adaptations include:

* &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot;, composed by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Lorenz Hart. The play premiered on Broadway in 1938 and Off-Broadway in 1963, with later productions including a West End run in 1963 and in a Broadway revival in 2002. A film adaptation was released in 1940. 
* &quot;A New Comedy of Errors, or Too Many Twins&quot; (1940), adapted from Plautus, Shakespeare and Molière, staged in modern dress at London&#x27;s Mercury Theatre.
*&quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; (1972) adaptation by James McCloskey, music and lyrics by Bruce Kimmel. Premiered at Los Angeles City College and went on to the American College Theatre Festival. 
*&quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; is a musical with book and lyrics by Trevor Nunn, and music by Guy Woolfenden. It was produced for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1976, winning the Laurence Olivier Award for best musical on its transfer to the West End in 1977.
* &quot;Oh, Brother!&quot; is a musical comedy in one act, with music by Michael Valenti and books and lyrics by Donald Driver, which premiered at ANTA Theatre in 1981, also directed by Driver. The musical takes place during a revolution in an oil rich Middle Eastern country on the Persian Gulf in a quaint resort town where its populace of merchants and revolutionaries mix Eastern tradition with Western consumerism. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave it a poor review, criticising Driver&#x27;s heavy handedness, while praising some of the music and performances.
* &quot;The Bomb-itty of Errors&quot;, a one-act hip-hop musical adaptation, by Jordan Allen-Dutton, Jason Catalano, Gregory J. Qaiyum, Jeffrey Qaiyum, and Erik Weinner, won 1st Prize at HBO&#x27;s Comedy Festival and was nominated opposite Stephen Sondheim for the Best Lyrics Drama Desk Award in 2001.

* In 1940 the film &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; was released, starring Alan Jones and Joe Penner as Antipholus and Dromio. It was a musical, loosely based on &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;.

===Novel===
In India, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar adapted Shakespeare&#x27;s play in his Bengali novel &quot;Bhranti Bilash&quot; (1869). Vidyasagar&#x27;s efforts were part of the process of championing Shakespeare and the Romantics during the Bengal Renaissance.

===Film===
The film &quot;Our Relations&quot; (1936) starring &quot;Stan Laurel&quot; and &quot;Oliver Hardy&quot;, was adapted from the &quot;W. W. Jacobs&quot; story &quot;The Money Box&quot;, but there are no twins in the Jacobs story. Our Relations owes its central conceit to The Comedy of Errors. As in the Shakespeare play, the story revolves around the confusion of two pairs of identical twins: one set of Laurel brothers named &quot;Stan&quot; and &quot;Alf&quot;, and one set of Hardy brothers named &quot;Oliver&quot; and &quot;Bert&quot;. Stan and Oliver think Alf and Bert were killed at sea. As the story opens, Alf and Bert have just arrived via ship at the same seaport where, unbeknownst to them, their married twin brothers Stan and Oliver live. One nod to the movie&#x27;s inspiration is a running gag: whenever Stan and Ollie say the same thing at the same time, they immediately perform a childhood ritual that begins: &quot;Shakespeare...Longfellow...&quot;

The &quot;Three Stooges&quot; film &quot;A Merry Mix Up&quot; (1957) starring &quot;Moe Howard&quot;, &quot;Larry Fine&quot; and &quot;Joe Besser&quot; expands the confusion by telling the story of three sets of identical triplets: Bachelors Moe, Larry and Joe; husbands Max, Louie and Jack; and newly-engaged brothers Morris, Luke and Jeff. The triplets can only be distinguished by their choices of neckties, bow ties, or no tie at all.

The film &quot;Start the Revolution Without Me&quot; (1970) starring Gene Wilder and Donald Sutherland involves two pairs of twins, one of each of which is switched at birth; one set is raised in an aristocratic, the other in a peasant family, who meet during the French Revolution.

The film &quot;Big Business&quot; (1988) is a modern take on &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;, with female twins instead of male. Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin star in the film as two sets of twins separated at birth, much like the characters in Shakespeare&#x27;s play.

The short film &quot;The Complete Walk: The Comedy of Errors&quot; was made in 2016 and starred Phil Davis, Omid Djalili and Boothby Graffoe.

Indian cinema has made nine films based on the play:
* &quot;Bhrantibilas&quot; (1963 Bengali film) starring Uttam Kumar
* &quot;Do Dooni Char&quot; starring Kishore Kumar
* &quot;Angoor&quot; starring Sanjeev Kumar
* &quot;Oorantha Golanta&quot; starring Chandra Mohan
* A movie in the Kannada language titled &quot;Ulta Palta&quot; starring Ramesh Aravind
* A movie in the Telugu language titled &quot;Ulta Palta&quot; starring Rajendra Prasad
* A movie in the Tamil language titled &quot;Ambuttu Imbuttu Embuttu&quot;
* A movie in the Tulu language titled &quot;Aamait Asal Eemait Kusal&quot; starring Naveen D Padil
* &quot;Double Di Trouble&quot; (2014 Punjabi Film) directed by Smeep Kang and starring Dharmendra, Gippy Grewal
* &quot;Local Kung Fu 2&quot; (2017 Assamese martial arts film)
* 2022 movie in Hindi language titled &quot;Cirkus&quot; starring Ranveer Singh

===Television===
* Roger Daltrey played both Dromios in the BBC complete works series directed by James Cellan Jones in 1983.
* A two-part TV adaptation was produced in 1978 in the USSR, with a Russian–Georgian cast of notable stage actors.
* The &quot;Inside No. 9&quot; episode &quot;Zanzibar&quot; (season 4, episode 1) was based on The Comedy of Errors
* Season 13 Episode 4 of Bob&#x27;s Burgers: &#x27;Comet-y of Errors&#x27; is also a reference to Shakespeare&#x27;s play.

<text>Zanussi () is an Italian producer of home appliances that was bought by Electrolux in 1984. Zanussi has been exporting products from Italy since 1946.

==History==
The Zanussi Company began as the small workshop of Antonio Zanussi in 1916. The 26-year-old son of a blacksmith in Pordenone in Northeastern Italy began the business by making home stoves and wood-burning ovens.

In 1933 Antonio Zanussi launched REX, the company&#x27;s newest trademark at that time, to coincide with a huge media event of the day: the new record for a transatlantic crossing (Gibraltar to New York) with which the Italian liner “Rex” conquered the Blue Riband.

In 1946 Antonio Zanussi died and management of the family business passed to his sons Lino and Guido. Under the leadership of Lino, the company developed into a modern industrial concern and in 1951, with a workforce of over 300, the company began to diversify into gas and electric, and combined gas/electric ovens; and, with growing availability and popularity of gas cylinders, Zanussi brought out their first gas cooker – the Rex 401.

A factory was opened at Porcia in 1954 and a Study Centre was established to research and design new appliances.

1958 saw the production of the first Zanussi washing machines. The same strategy underlay the creation, a year later, of the company’s Design and research Centre.

In 1959 Zanussi launched the first “Supermarket” fridge with automatic defrosting and two compartments with separate temperature controls. At the end of the 1950s, Zanussi launched its “Tropic System” featuring a rounded style. Meanwhile, the washing machines were already into the second generation, with front-loading, and five washing programmes, developed with an eye for the requirements of the important German market.

In 1960, Zanussi started producing TV sets. By 1962, Zanussi exported its products to 60 countries.

1964 saw the first appearance in Italy of a fridge with a –12C compartment that was suitable for the conservation of frozen food – the “Freezermarket” Rex. In the following year, Zanussi put its first dishwasher on the market.

The next decade was one of important purchases, with the Becchi, Castor, Zoppas and Triplex brands all joining the Zanussi Group, and of the start-up of manufacturing outside Italy. Zanussi advanced to leadership of the Italian household appliance industry with a 25% market share, and was among the foremost producers in Europe with 10% of sales throughout the continent.

In late 1974, Zanussi released the Ping-O-Tronic under the Sèleco brand.

The death of Lino Zanussi and his closest assistants in an airplane crash in Spain on 18 June 1968 marked a change of strategy. In the meantime the economic situation in Italy had changed and with plans for diversification undermined by the difficulties being experienced by Italian industry in general, Zanussi slipped towards financial crisis in the late 1970s and the first half of the 1980s. The recovery process began in 1985 after Electrolux acquired the company in late 1984.

In 1985, Zanussi introduced the Jetsystem on their range of washing machines, which uses a circulation pump to pump the water in the drum onto the clothes via a jet hole in the door seal. This helps save water as the clothes are soaked with soapy water quicker. This can still be found on current Zanussi washing machines.

==Aftersales service==
Until the end of the 1980s Zanussi service was run from Reading, Berkshire and was a network of independent repairers.

In the early 1990s Electrolux amalgamated all its UK brands under one service entity. This entity was split, dependent on region, between the Zanussi service agents and the local Electrolux Service Centre. In general those in a high population density area were given to the Electrolux employed centres. Tricity Bendix, Electrolux and AEG as well as Zanussi were all to be serviced by the one network.

This was changed in the late 1990s and early 2000s as Electrolux sold or gave away the regional service centres, generally to the existing management or to area managers to run as independent businesses.

This service network was re-branded and became Service Force which still exists today but is, once again, all operated by independent service companies who repair and supply spare parts for all of the brands.

<doc id="324918" wikidata="Q567576" url="?curid=324918" title="Anomic aphasia">
<text>Anomic aphasia, also known as dysnomia, nominal aphasia, and amnesic aphasia, is a mild, fluent type of aphasia where individuals have word retrieval failures and cannot express the words they want to say (particularly nouns and verbs). By contrast, &quot;anomia&quot; is a deficit of expressive language, and a symptom of all forms of aphasia, but patients whose primary deficit is word retrieval are diagnosed with anomic aphasia. Individuals with aphasia who display anomia can often describe an object in detail and maybe even use hand gestures to demonstrate how the object is used, but cannot find the appropriate word to name the object. Patients with anomic aphasia have relatively preserved speech fluency, repetition, comprehension, and grammatical speech.

== Types ==
* Word selection anomia is caused by damage to the posterior inferior temporal area. This type of anomia occurs when the patient knows how to use an object and can correctly select the target object from a group of objects, and yet cannot name the object. Some patients with word selection anomia may exhibit selective impairment in naming particular types of objects, such as animals or colors. In the subtype known as color anomia, the patient can distinguish between colors but cannot identify them by name or name the color of an object. The patients can separate colors into categories, but they cannot name them.
* Semantic anomia is caused by damage to the angular gyrus. This is a disorder in which the meaning of words becomes lost. In patients with semantic anomia, a naming deficit is accompanied by a recognition deficit. Thus, unlike patients with word selection anomia, patients with semantic anomia are unable to select the correct object from a group of objects, even when provided with the name of the target object.
* Disconnection anomia results from the severing of connections between sensory and language cortices. Patients with disconnection anomia may exhibit modality-specific anomia, where the anomia is limited to a specific sensory modality, such as hearing. For example, a patient who is perfectly capable of naming a target object when it is presented via certain sensory modalities like audition or touch, may be unable to name the same object when the object is presented visually. Thus, in such a case, the patient&#x27;s anomia arises as a consequence of a disconnect between their visual cortex and language cortices.
** Patients with disconnection anomia may also exhibit callosal anomia, in which damage to the corpus callosum prevents sensory information from being transmitted between the two hemispheres of the brain. Therefore, when sensory information is unable to reach the hemisphere that is language-dominant (typically the left hemisphere in most individuals), the result is anomia. For instance, if patients with this type of disconnection anomia hold an object in their left hand, this somatosensory information about the object would be sent to the right hemisphere of the brain, but then would be unable to reach the left hemisphere due to callosal damage. Thus, this somatosensory information would fail to be transmitted to language areas in the left hemisphere, in turn resulting in the inability to name the object in the left hand. In this example, the patient would have no problem with naming, if the test object were to be held in the right hand. This type of anomia may also arise as a consequence of a disconnect between sensory and language cortices.
* Articulatory initiation anomia results from damage to the frontal area. Characteristics of this anomia are non-fluent output, word-finding pauses, deficient word lists. Patients perform better at confrontation naming tasks, the selection of a label for a corresponding picture, than word list tasks. Patients are aided in word selection by prompting, unlike those with word selection anomia.
* Phonemic substitution anomia results from damage to the inferior parietal area. Patients maintain fluent output but exhibit literal and neologistic paraphasia. Literal paraphasia is the incorrect substitution of phonemes, and neologistic paraphasia is the use of non-real words in the place of real words. Patient&#x27;s naming ability is contaminated by paraphasia.
* Modality-specific anomia is caused by damage to the sensory cortex, pathways to the dominant angular gyrus, or both. In these patients, word-finding is worst in one sensory modality, for example visual or tactile.

== Causes ==
Anomic aphasia occurring by itself may be caused by damage to almost anywhere in the left hemisphere and in some cases can be seen in instances of right hemisphere damage. Anomia can be genetic or caused by damage to various parts of the parietal lobe or the temporal lobe of the brain due to traumatic injury, stroke, or a brain tumor. While anomic aphasia is primarily caused by structural lesions, they may also originate in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (anomia may be the earliest language deficit in posterior cortical atrophy variant of Alzheimer&#x27;s) or other neurodegenerative diseases.

Although the main causes are not specifically known, many researchers have found other factors contributing to anomic aphasia. People with damage to the left hemisphere of the brain are more likely to have anomic aphasia. Broca&#x27;s area, the speech production center in the brain, was linked to being the source for speech execution problems, with the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), now commonly used to study anomic patients. Other experts believe that damage to Wernicke&#x27;s area, which is the speech comprehension area of the brain, is connected to anomia because the patients cannot comprehend the words that they are hearing.

Although many experts have believed that damage to Broca&#x27;s area or Wernicke&#x27;s area are the main causes of anomia, current studies have shown that damage in the left parietal lobe is the cause of anomic aphasia. One study was conducted using a word repetition test as well as fMRI in order to see the highest level of activity as well as where the lesions are in the brain tissue. Fridrikkson, et al. saw that damage to neither Broca&#x27;s area nor Wernicke&#x27;s area were the sole sources of anomia in the subjects. Therefore, the original anomia model, which theorized that damage occurred on the surface of the brain in the grey matter was debunked, and it was found that the damage was in the white matter deeper in the brain, on the left hemisphere. More specifically, the damage was in a part of the nerve tract called the arcuate fasciculus, for which the mechanism of action is unknown, though it is known to connect the posterior (back) of the brain to the anterior (front) and vice versa.

While anomic aphasia is associated with lesions throughout the left hemisphere, severe and isolated anomia has been considered a sign of deep temporal lobe or lateral temporo-occipital damage. Damage to these areas is seen in patients showing infarction limited to regions supplied by the dominant posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and is referred to as posterior cerebral artery syndrome.

== Diagnosis ==
The best way to see if anomic aphasia has developed is by using verbal and imaging tests. The combination seems to be most effective, since either test done alone may give false positives or false negatives. For example, the verbal test is used to see if a speech disorder presents, and whether the problem is in speech production or comprehension. Patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease have speech problems linked to dementia or progressive aphasias, which can include anomia. The imaging test, mostly done using MRI scans, is ideal for lesion mapping or viewing deterioration in the brain. However, imaging cannot diagnose anomia on its own because the lesions may not be located deep enough to damage the white matter or the arcuate fasciculus. However, anomic aphasia is very difficult to associate with a specific lesion location in the brain. Therefore, the combination of speech tests and imaging tests has the highest sensitivity and specificity.

Picture-naming tests, such as the Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT), are also utilized in diagnosing aphasias. Analysis of picture-naming is compared with reading, picture categorizing, and word categorizing. There is a considerable similarity among aphasia syndromes in terms of picture-naming behavior, however anomic aphasiacs produced the fewest phonemic errors and the most multiword circumlocutions. These results suggest minimal word-production difficulty in anomic aphasia relative to other aphasia syndromes.

Anomic aphasia has been diagnosed in some studies using the Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT), which tests language functioning after brain injury. This test aims to: identify the presence of aphasia; provide a profile of the speaker&#x27;s language functioning according to different language modalities (speaking, listening, reading, writing) and different levels of linguistic description (phonology, morphology, semantics, and syntax); give a measure of severity of any breakdown. This test was administered to patients participating in a study in 2012, and researchers found that on the naming subtest of the AAT patients showed relevant naming difficulties and tended to substitute the words they could not produce with circumlocutions.

The Western Aphasia Battery is another test that is conducted with the goal of classifying aphasia subtypes and rating the severity of the aphasiac impairment. The test is composed of four language and three performance domains. Syndrome classification is determined by the pattern of performance on the four language subtests, which assess spontaneous speech, comprehension, repetition, and naming.

Doing a hearing test first is important, in case the patient cannot clearly hear the words or sentences needed in the speech repetition test. In the speech tests, the person is asked to repeat a sentence with common words; if the person cannot identify the word, but he or she can describe it, then the person is highly likely to have anomic aphasia. However, to be completely sure, the test is given while a test subject is in an fMRI scanner, and the exact location of the lesions and areas activated by speech are pinpointed. Few simpler or cheaper options are available, so lesion mapping and speech repetition tests are the main ways of diagnosing anomic aphasia.

=== Definition ===
Anomic aphasia (anomia) is a type of aphasia characterized by problems recalling words, names, and numbers. Speech is fluent and receptive language is not impaired in someone with anomic aphasia. Subjects often use circumlocutions (speaking in a roundabout way) to avoid a name they cannot recall or to express a certain word they cannot remember. Sometimes, the subject can recall the name when given clues. Additionally, patients are able to speak with correct grammar; the main problem is finding the appropriate word to identify an object or person.

Sometimes, subjects may know what to do with an object, but still not be able to give a name to the object. For example, if a subject is shown an orange and asked what it is called, the subject may be well aware that the object can be peeled and eaten, and may even be able to demonstrate this by actions or even verbal responses; however, they cannot recall that the object is called an &quot;orange&quot;. Sometimes, when a person with this condition is multilingual, they might confuse the language they are speaking in trying to find the right word (inadvertent code-switching).

== Management ==
No method is available to completely cure anomic aphasia. However, treatments can help improve word-finding skills.

Although a person with anomia may find recalling many types of words to be difficult, such as common nouns, proper nouns, verbs, etc., many studies have shown that treatment for object words, or nouns, has shown promise in rehabilitation research. The treatment includes visual aids, such as pictures, and the patient is asked to identify the object or activity. However, if that is not possible, then the patient is shown the same picture surrounded by words associated with the object or activity. Throughout the process, positive encouragement is provided. The treatment shows an increase in word finding during treatment; however, word identifying decreased two weeks after the rehabilitation period. Therefore, it shows that rehabilitation effort needs to be continuous for word-finding abilities to improve from the baseline. The studies show that verbs are harder to recall or repeat, even with rehabilitation.

Other methods in treating anomic aphasia include circumlocution-induced naming therapy (CIN), wherein the patient uses circumlocution to assist with his or her naming rather than just being told to name the item pictured after given some sort of cue. Results suggest that the patient does better in properly naming objects when undergoing this therapy because CIN strengthens the weakened link between semantics and phonology for patients with anomia, since they often know what an object is used for, but cannot verbally name it.

Anomia is often challenging for the families and friends of those affected by it. One way to overcome this is computer-based treatment models, effective especially when used with clinical therapy. Leemann et al. provided anomic patients with computerized-assisted therapy (CAT) sessions, along with traditional therapy sessions using treatment lists of words. Some of the patients received a drug known to help relieve symptoms of anomia (levodopa), while others received a placebo. The researchers found that the drug had no significant effects on improvement with the treatment lists, but almost all of the patients improved after the CAT sessions. They concluded that this form of computerized treatment is effective in increasing naming abilities in anomic patients.

Additionally, one study researched the effects of using &quot;excitatory (anodal) transcranial direct current stimulation&quot; over the right temporoparietal cortex, a brain area that seems to correlate to language. The electrical stimulation seemed to enhance language training outcome in patients with chronic aphasia.

Contextual repetition priming treatment is a technique which involves repeated repetition of names of pictures that are related semantically, phonologically, or are unrelated. Patients with impaired access to lexical-semantic representations show no long-term improvement in naming, but patients with good access to semantics show long-term benefits.

Development of self-cueing strategies can also facilitate word retrieval. Patients identify core words that can be retrieved without struggle, and establish a relationship between cue words and words that begin with the same sound but cannot be retrieved. Patients then learn to use the cue word to facilitate word retrieval for the target object.

==Epidemiology==
Many different populations can and do have anomia. For instance, deaf patients who have had a stroke can demonstrate semantic and phonological errors, much like hearing anomic patients. Researchers have called this subtype sign anomia.

Multilingual patients typically experience anomia to a greater degree in just one of their fluent languages. However, evidence conflicts as to which language – first or second – is impacted more.

Research on children with anomia has indicated that children who undergo treatment are, for the most part, able to gain back normal language abilities, aided by brain plasticity. However, longitudinal research on children with anomic aphasia due to head injury shows that even several years after the injury, some signs of deficient word retrieval are still observed. These remaining symptoms can sometimes cause academic difficulties later on.

== Patients ==
This disorder may be extremely frustrating for people with and without the disorder. Although the persons with anomic aphasia may know the specific word, they may not be able to recall it and this can be very difficult for everyone in the conversation. Positive reinforcements are helpful.

Although not many literary cases mention anomic aphasia, many nonfiction books have been written about living with aphasia. One of them is &quot;The Man Who Lost His Language&quot; by Sheila Hale. It is the story of Hale&#x27;s husband, John Hale, a scholar who had had a stroke and lost speech formation abilities. In her book, Hale also explains the symptoms and mechanics behind aphasia and speech formation. She adds the emotional components of dealing with a person with aphasia and how to be patient with the speech and communication.

<text>The RK 62 (from Finnish , &#x27;assault rifle 62&#x27;), officially 7.62 RK 62 and commercially M62, is an assault rifle manufactured by Valmet and Sako. It is the standard issue infantry weapon of the Finnish Defence Forces.

The RK 62 was designed in 1957–1962 by a Valmet engineer Lauri Oksanen and is based on the Polish licensed version of the Soviet AK-47 design. The RK 62 uses the same 7.62×39mm cartridge as the AK-47. Between 1965 and 1994 350,000 M62 rifles were produced jointly by Valmet and Sako. It is the basis of the IMI Galil, an Israeli-made assault rifle with many similarities. The RK 62 has a three-pronged flash suppressor, and a groove for a specially designed knife bayonet, which can be used alone as a combat knife.

The RK 95 TP is a more modern, improved version of the RK 62. One of the most distinctive features of the Valmet rifles, including the M62 and all subsequent variations, is the open-ended, three prong flash suppressor with a bayonet lug on its lower side. In addition to the flash suppression, the end can quickly cut barbed wire by pushing the muzzle onto a strand of wire and firing a round.

==History==
The development of a Finnish assault rifle in 7.62×39mm Soviet intermediary cartridge began in the 1950s. Various foreign models were looked at, the Soviet AK-47 being the most important. The first version was called the RK 60.

The RK 62 was produced in 1960 at the Valmet factory in Tourula and was internally almost a copy of the AK-47. It featured a metallic buttstock, a plastic handguard and pistol grip but lacked the trigger guard (it was hoped that it would make firing this weapon easier in cold Finnish winter when soldiers wore warm mittens). The very first prototypes, closely modeled after Polish licence made AKs, had tinted birchwood stocks. After testing by the military, the RK 60 was slightly modified (trigger guard was reinstated) and adopted as the 7.62 RK 62.

In August 2015, the Finnish Defence Forces announced that they will gradually modernize existing RK 62 rifles. The old tubular butt and leather sling will be replaced with a telescopic stock and tactical sling. An option for mounting a top rail for telescopic sights and night vision devices will be added to all rifles; likewise, the barrel will get an attachment point for tactical lights and lasers. The upgraded model will be known as RK 62 M.

==Design==
The RK 62 is considered a high quality AK-47 variant. The biggest single improvement, apart from the metallurgical quality of the receiver and the overall quality of the barrel, are the sights: most AK variants have the rear sight mounted on top of the gas piston housing on top of the receiver. In the RK 62 the rear sight is mounted on the rear of the receiver cover with tritium illuminated night-sights. The sight radius is doubled enhancing the accuracy along with the hammer-forged match CM barrel. Aperture rear sight on a sliding tangent with flip tritium night sight, forward hooded post, 470 mm sight radius.

This is apparent especially in its accuracy, as it can frequently achieve less than one minute of arc. The rifle uses a &quot;peep&quot; diopter sight, which is flipped over to reveal the open tritium enhanced rear night sight. The forward sight also has a mode for night operation. The gas tube is dove tailed into the front trunnion, and is a single-diameter tube, unlike the AK/AKM tube, which has a star-shaped cross-section to guide the piston while allowing gasses to vent behind it. The gas piston has a cog shaped ring on the stem, behind the piston head. The ring&#x27;s diameter matches the tube diameter, and it acts as the guide within the gas tube, the notches on the ring allowing excess gasses to be vented behind the piston head/guide. This system reduces the number of parts, and simplifies manufacturing as well as assembly/disassembly. This design made its way into the IMI Galil. A port in the shoulder pad allows storing items (e.g. the cleaning kit) in the tubular buttstock.

All RK variants are designed to withstand the extreme environmental conditions of Northern Europe.

==Variants==
===Military===

* m/58 – the very first prototype with which Valmet beat the Sako prototype in the competition for designing a locally produced Kalashnikov-pattern rifle. The prototype had a wooden stock, pistol grip and handguard instead of the iconic tubular stock and plastic pistol grip and handguard.
* RK 60 – the first factory production prototype. The first variant included a hinged trigger guard and no muzzle device, second variant had an open trigger guard and an experimental muzzle brake, which was later on changed to the well-known three-pronged flash suppressor.

* RK 62 PT – the initial production type rifles, with the PT suffix added after the main RK 62 production run started. These lacked the tritium illuminated night sights and had a buttstock and rear and front sight similar to the RK 60. Most have since been converted to RK 62 standard, the remaining have been phased out of service.

* RK 62 – the main production runs since the mid 1960s. These have the new style sights with tritium illuminated night sights, strengthened buttstock, and a new style gas port. Earlier runs featured the older type plastic furniture, while the production since the early 1970s has the new style plastic furniture, which has been retrofitted to the earlier rifles as well if the parts were in need of maintenance. Later production runs have the rear of the receiver simplified and the buttstock tube attachment system was changed to the same roll pin system as in the Israeli Galil. The versions with the later style plastic hardware weight a total of 3.5 kg. When rifles in circulation return to the FDF armories they have holes drilled to them for attaching a rail for optical sights, adding VV to the end of the name.
** RK 62 TP – a folding stock version, from the later batches of the RK 62, with a Galil-type buttstock attaching system and hinge. The hinge of the folding stock makes the rifle slightly longer than the standard RK 62 when the buttstock is extended.
** RK 62 95 TP – a folding stock version of the Finnish Border Guard, which features the folding stock and selector switch from the RK 95 TP, as well as a rail for optics.
** RK 62 M1 – an FDF baseline modernisation of the existing RK 62 rifles with a telescoping stock and mounting rails for optical sights and tactical lights as well as a new, improved selector switch.
** RK 62 M2 – a more extensive modernisation over the RK 62 M1, with a new front handguard with M-LOK rail interface, and a new Ase Utra BoreLock flash hider which can mount a silencer or a rebar cutter.
** RK 62 M3 – RK 62 M2 with OD Green Cerakote surface treatment.
** RK 62 kromattu – a fully functional chrome plated version of the late RK 62 production variant for FDF conscript band displays.
** M/74 – an FDF HQ Infantry Weapons Technical Department RPK-style prototype &quot;ratsuväen konekivääri&quot; (&#x27;Cavalry LMG&#x27;). Had a different sight layout with a KvKK 62 sight on top of the gas tube and front sight at the front end of the barrel, a conical flash suppressor, bipod and modified buttstock and handguard. Developed separately from the Valmet M78.
** &quot;unnamed short prototype&quot; – an AKS-74u -inspired folding stock carbine prototype variant by the HQ Infantry Weapons Technical Department.

* RK 62 76 – stamped steel receiver version, which resembles the RK 62 with newer style plastic furniture, but features a lighter weight receiver. The total weight of the RK 62 76 is 3.27 kg. Unlike between AK-47 and AKM, the internal parts are fully interchangeable between RK 62 and RK 62 76, the only difference being the receiver.
** RK 62 76 TP- stamped steel receiver version with an early type folding stock.
** M/82 – a bullpup prototype assault rifle using the RK 62 76 receiver.
* RK 71 – a stamped steel receiver rifle, which has a different sight layout from the RK 62: rear sight is an open notch with distance adjustment welded on the gas tube and front sight is at the front end of the barrel, behind the flash suppressor. The internal parts of the receiver aren&#x27;t fully compatible with the RK 62 or RK 62 76.
** RK 71 TP – folding stock version of the RK 71 with an AKS-47 type folding stock.
** TAK – Valmet sniper rifle prototype for FDF, based on the RK 71, chambered in 7.62×53mmR and fed from 20-round Lahti-Saloranta M/26 magazines.

* RK 90 – a Sako prototype for the FDF incorporating many features from the Galil.
* RK 92 – a Sako prototype for the FDF, returning from the RK 90 to conventional Kalashnikov-type decisions in many aspects.
* RK 95 TP – newer Sako production derivative of the RK 62 with several features inspired by the Galil and other assault rifles.

===Export (Military/LE)===
* Valmet M62 – RK 62. Exported for the Qatar Armed Forces.
* Valmet M72 – a chrome plated variant of the RK 71 for the Royal Guard of the Qatar Armed Forces in 7.62×39mm.

* Valmet M78 (stamped) – an export variant of the RK 62 76 with a strengthened front trunnion, heavier barrel and sight layout of the RK 71, which led to external resemblance to the Soviet RPK. Developed separately from the FDF M/74 prototype; experiences from the FDF/Valmet TAK prototype were used in the development of the M78, which led to the decision to strengthen the front trunnion. Produced in .223 Rem/5.56 NATO, 7.62×39 and .308 Win. This weapon is also notorious among Canadian gun owners, as when Canada banned the AK, and any variant, the Valmet M78 was one of the only rifles that were specifically excluded.

<doc id="324920" wikidata="Q2414509" url="?curid=324920" title="The Supernaturals">
<text>The Supernaturals are a guitar-based indie rock band from Glasgow, Scotland. The band signed to Parlophone in 1996, and had a string of singles which were taken from their three albums and four EPs. Other members included Mark Guthrie, Derek McManus, Gavin Crawford and Ken McAlpine. The band&#x27;s best known songs (&quot;Smile&quot; and &quot;I Wasn&#x27;t Built To Get Up&quot;) were featured prominently in a series of television advertisements. In total they scored five Top 40 entries in the UK Singles Chart. The band broke up in 2002, before reforming in 2012, and they continue to record music, and perform concerts, to this day.

==Career==

The band was formed in 1991 by Derek McManus (guitar), James McColl (guitar/vocals), Gavin Crawford (drums) and Mark Guthrie (bass). Their first release, on cassette, was &quot;Big 7&quot; in 1992 followed by &quot;Dark Star&quot; in early 1993. The band toured extensively around Scotland, selling copies of &quot;Big 7&quot; and &quot;Dark Star&quot; and building a fanbase. Ken McAlpine joined the band in early 1994 on keyboards with Sean Guthrie and Steve Jeffrey sitting in as his replacement on keyboards occasionally. The band often played long sets and featured many impromptu cover versions of songs by bands such as The Move, The Replacements and The Monkees. While still unsigned, they released the CD album &quot;Sitting in the Sun&quot; in 1994 and played at the Sound City Festival in Glasgow with the Trashcan Sinatras in April 1994. They followed this up with &quot;Let it Bleat&quot; in 1995. Gavin Crawford (drums) left the band in 1995 to be replaced by Alan Tilston. By mid 1995 The Supernaturals played unsigned at the Phoenix Festival and T in the Park. Having come to the attention of Andy Ross of Food Records in 1995, they were signed to Food/EMI in November 1995. 

The band spent early 1996 recording their debut album with producer Pete Smith and played gigs supporting Dodgy (on their Big Top Tour), Tina Turner, Sleeper, Menswear, the Bluetones and Ash. The band&#x27;s second release on Food, &quot;Lazy Lover&quot; was supported by a large UK tour with Silver Sun and Grasshow in the Autumn of 1996. The band&#x27;s next release &quot;Day Before Yesterday&#x27;s Man&quot; was in January 1997 and the band toured with the Boo Radleys and Gene (band). They re-released &quot;Smile&quot; in April 1997 and their debut album &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter anymore&quot; was released in May 1997. The song &quot;Smile&quot; was a success in Japan with the album staying on the charts in Japan for 12 weeks. The band toured Europe and the UK with Robbie Williams in Autumn 1997. After spending early 1998 recording with Pete Smith, they released their second album &quot;A Tune a Day&quot; (named after the music instruction books) in August 1998 and three singles were released from the album, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t Built to Get Up&quot;, &quot;Sheffield Song&quot; and &quot;Everest&quot; . This was supported by festival appearances and several headlining tours and a 30 date UK Arena and European tour with Robbie Williams and the Divine Comedy in early 1999.

The band left Food/EMI Records in Autumn 1999. They recorded their third album &quot;What we did last summer&quot; in Glasgow in 2000 and released it on Koch/Universal in May 2002. Mark Guthrie left the band in December 2000 and Ken McAlpine left the band in July 2001. They were replaced by David Mitchell (keyboards) and Paul Malcolm (guitars) with James McColl switching to bass. To support the release of the album the band toured around the UK and with The Proclaimers in late 2001 and made several appearances at festivals to support the album. The band&#x27;s first single from the album &quot;Finishing Credits&quot; was on a list of song banned by the BBC in the wake of the 9/11 attacks due to the phrase &quot;It&#x27;s the end of the world as we know it&quot; featuring in the song.

The band were nominated for an Ivor Novello Award in 1998 for best contemporary song for &quot;Smile&quot; along with The Verve&#x27;s &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; and Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;No Surprises&quot;. The band won a Tartan Clef award in 1997 as the best new Scottish band.

Songs are often related to other songs on the same album by a common theme. The album &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Matter Anymore&quot; received good reviews (8/10 &quot;NME&quot; and 4/5 &quot;Q&quot;) as did the follow-up &quot;A Tune a Day&quot; (7/10 &quot;NME&quot; and 4/5 &quot;Q&quot;).

The creative output saw around 100 songs written in five years. They played at music festivals in the UK, and around Europe, They were also a staple on compilation albums such as &quot;Shine&quot;, and played radio sessions for BBC Radio 1, Radio 2, Virgin and others. Television appearances included &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;TFI Friday&quot;, &quot;The Jack Docherty Show&quot;, &quot;Fully Booked&quot; and &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, with keyboardist Ken McAlpine appearing as a contestant on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; (for Phill Jupitus&#x27; team). The band performed at each T in the Park festival between 1995 and 1998.

The song &quot;Smile&quot; was the theme tune for bank Smile.co.uk&#x27;s TV advertisements, Arnold Clark Automobiles, Sky Movies UK, Pearl Drops, and mayonnaise in Japan, and was re-recorded for use as the main theme of the Nine Network idents in Australia 2008, and was also parodied in &quot;Peter Kay&#x27;s Phoenix Nights&quot;. The song was also used on &quot;As If&quot;, &quot;Holiday Showdown&quot;, &quot;Wife Swap&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;ll Teach &#x27;Em&quot; and &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot;, &quot;X Factor&quot;, &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s Car Years&quot;, and in 2005 was included in VH2&#x27;s list of the best indie songs of all time. The song was also used as the theme music for the television review show &quot;Manic Episodes&quot;.

&quot;I Wasn&#x27;t Built to Get up&quot; was used in an advertising campaign for Direct Debits on UK television in 1999. The song &quot;Monday Mornings&quot; was used in the film &quot;Fast Food&quot; in 1998. &quot;Life is a Motorway&quot; has been used in the BBC TV show &quot;Homes Under the Hammer&quot;.

<doc id="324927" wikidata="Q827023" url="?curid=324927" title="Lesion">
<text>A lesion is any damage or abnormal change in the tissue of an organism, usually caused by injury or diseases. The term &quot;Lesion&quot; is derived from the Latin meaning &quot;injury&quot;. Lesions may occur in both plants and animals.

== Types ==

There is no designated classification or naming convention for lesions. Because lesions can occur anywhere in the body and their definition is so broad, the varieties of lesions are virtually endless. Generally, lesions may be classified by their patterns, sizes, locations, or causes. They can also be named after the person who discovered them. For example, Ghon lesions, which are found in the lungs of those with tuberculosis, are named after the lesion&#x27;s discoverer, Anton Ghon. The characteristic skin lesions of a varicella zoster virus infection are called &quot;chickenpox&quot;. Lesions of the teeth are usually called dental caries, or &quot;cavities&quot;.

=== Location ===

Lesions are often classified by their tissue types or locations. For example, &quot;skin lesions&quot; or &quot;brain lesion&quot; are named for the tissue where they are found. If there is an added significance to regions within the tissue—such as in neural injuries where different locations correspond to different neurological deficits—they are further classified by location. For example, a lesion in the central nervous system is called a central lesion, and a lesion in the peripheral nervous system is called a peripheral lesion. A myocardial lesion results from damage to the heart muscle, and a coronary lesion is a subtype that describes a lesion in the coronary arteries. Coronary lesions are then further classified according to which side of the heart is affected and the diameter of the artery in which they form.

=== Cause and behavior ===

If a lesion is caused by a tumor, it can be classified as &quot;malignant&quot; or &quot;benign&quot; after analysis of a biopsy. A benign lesion that is evolving into a malignant lesion is called &quot;premalignant&quot;. Cancerous lesions are sometimes classified by their growth kinetics, such as the Lodwick classification, which characterizes classes of bone lesions. Another type is an excitotoxic lesion, which can be caused by excitatory amino acids like kainic acid that kill neurons through overstimulation.

=== Size and shape ===

Lesion size may be specified as &quot;gross&quot;, meaning it is visible to the unaided eye, or &quot;histologic&quot;, meaning a microscope is needed to see it. A &quot;space-occupying lesion&quot;, as the name suggests, has a recognizable volume and may impinge on nearby structures, whereas a &quot;non space-occupying lesion&quot; is simply a hole in the tissue, such as a small area of the brain that has turned to fluid following a stroke.

Lesions may also be classified by the shape they form, as is the case with many ulcers, which can have a bullseye or &#x27;target&#x27; appearance. A coin lesion seen in an X-ray has the appearance of a coin sitting on the patient&#x27;s chest.

== Research using lesions ==

Brain lesions may help researchers understand brain function. Research involving lesions relies on two assumptions: that brain damage can affect different aspects of cognition independently, and that a locally damaged brain functions identically to a normal brain in its &quot;undamaged&quot; parts.

&quot;Sham lesion&quot; is the name given to a control procedure during a lesion experiment. In a sham lesion, an animal may be placed in a stereotaxic apparatus and electrodes inserted as in the experimental condition, but no current is passed, so damage to the tissue should be minimal.

=== Research with humans ===

Humans with brain lesions are often subjects of research with the goal of establishing the function of the area where their lesion occurred.

A drawback to the use of human subjects is the difficulty in finding subjects who have a lesion to the area the researcher wishes to study. As such, transcranial magnetic stimulation is often used in cognition and neuroscience-related tests to imitate the effect.

=== Research with animals ===

Using animal subjects gives researchers the ability to study lesions in specific body parts, allowing them to quickly acquire a large group of subjects. An example of such a study is the lesioning of rat hippocampi to establish the role of the hippocampus in object recognition and object recency.

<text>Saas-Fee () is the main village in the Saastal, or the Saas Valley, and is a municipality in the district of Visp in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. The village is situated on a high mountain plateau at 1,800 meters (5,900 feet), surrounded by a total of 13 peaks above 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) which is the highest concentration in the Alps, giving the village the nickname &quot;the Pearl of the Alps&quot;. It is a classic ski resort characterised by well-preserved Swiss wood architecture and a car-free city centre. The villages in its neighbourhood are Saas-Almagell, Saas-Grund and Saas-Balen.

==Overview==

Its location close to the glaciers of the Dom and the Allalinhorn provides winter sport opportunities throughout the year, and neighbouring peaks such as the Weissmies, the Nadelhorn and the Lenzspitze are popular climbs in the summer season. The community is considered to be a very attractive winter sport destination in the Swiss Alps. Typical activities include skiing, snowboarding, snowshoe trekking, canyon climbing and ice climbing.

Saas-Fee offers 22 lifts, including 3 cable cars, 1 funicular railway (Metro Alpin), 5 gondolas (1 dedicated to walkers), 2 chairlifts, the remainder being surface lifts (draglifts). The ski run has a vertical drop of 1,800 m (5,906 ft), a top elevation of 3,600 m (11,811 ft) and covers ( beginner, intermediate, advanced). Other activities include paragliding, hang gliding, and tobogganing.

Saas-Fee can be reached by car or bus – postal buses run during much of the day half-hourly from Brig and Visp, though none provides a service beyond the bus terminal through the length of the town during the winter. No cars are allowed to enter the city (they have to be parked in special car parks outside); only small electric vehicles operate on the streets between the hotels and ski area. The decision to exclude most motor vehicles was made by the village at the time of the construction of the road from Saas Grund in 1951 in order to eliminate air pollution.

The resort offers many culture, sports, and off-slope activities, including classical music, a sports and leisure complex, restaurants, and nightclubs. The resort features the highest underground funicular railway in the world up to the skiing area and the highest revolving restaurant in the world at . The touristic slogan of Saas-Fee is &quot;Die Perle der Alpen&quot; (The Pearl of the Alps) as it is surrounded by a total of 13 peaks above , the most in the Alps. A campus of the European Graduate School is located in Saas-Fee.

==In popular culture==

Saas-Fee was the location where the video for Wham!&#x27;s hit single &quot;Last Christmas&quot; was filmed in 1984. The cable car that they get into to go up the mountain is labelled with the name &quot;Saas-Fee&quot; in the typical Saas-Fee font. This appears to be an artistic device as the cable car, now replaced by a more modern version, runs between the edge of Saas-Fee and Felskinn which is considerably above the normal height for residential buildings. Saas-Fee is also the setting of the second part of André Gide&#x27;s novel Les faux-monnayeurs, as well as the setting of various ski chase sequences in the &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; film (1969) in the James Bond series.

<doc id="324935" wikidata="Q1398819" url="?curid=324935" title="Bill Haywood">
<text>William Dudley Haywood (February 4, 1869 – May 18, 1928), nicknamed &quot;Big Bill&quot;, was an American labor organizer and founding member and leader of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and a member of the executive committee of the Socialist Party of America. During the first two decades of the 20th century, Haywood was involved in several important labor battles, including the Colorado Labor Wars, the Lawrence Textile Strike, and other textile strikes in Massachusetts and New Jersey.

Haywood was an advocate of industrial unionism, and syndicalism, a labor philosophy that favors organizing all workers in an industry under one union, regardless of the specific trade or skill level; this was in contrast to the craft unions that were prevalent at the time, such as the AFL. He believed that workers of all ethnicities should be united, and favored direct action over political action.

Haywood was often targeted by prosecutors due to his support for violence. An attempt to prosecute him in 1907 for his alleged involvement in the murder of Frank Steunenberg failed, but in 1918 he was one of 101 IWW members jailed for anti-war activity during the First Red Scare. He was sentenced to twenty years. In 1921, while out of prison during an appeal of his conviction, Haywood fled to the Soviet Union, where he spent the remaining years of his life and where he died in 1928. Paul Freeman, John Reed, Charles Ruthenberg, and Haywood are the only four Americans to be buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in 1869 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, his father, a former Pony Express rider, died of pneumonia when Haywood was three years old. His mother Elizabeth was an Episcopalian.

At age nine, Haywood injured his right eye while whittling a slingshot with a knife, permanently blinding that eye. He never had his damaged eye replaced with a glass eye; when photographed, he would turn his head to show his left profile. After his uncle Richard arranged for Haywood to work as an indentured laborer on a farm, a job Haywood disliked, he changed his name from William Richard to William Dudley after his father. At age 15, with very little formal education, Haywood began working in the mines. After brief stints as a cowboy and a homesteader, he returned to mining in 1896. High-profile events such as the Haymarket Massacre in 1886 and the Pullman Strike in 1894 fostered Haywood&#x27;s interest in the labor movement.

===Western Federation of Miners involvement===

In 1896, Ed Boyce, president of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), spoke at the Idaho silver mine where Haywood was working. Inspired by his speech, Haywood signed up as a WFM member, thus formally beginning his involvement in America&#x27;s labor movement. He immediately became active in the WFM, and by 1900 he had become a member of the union&#x27;s General Executive Board. In 1902, he became secretary-treasurer of the WFM, the number two position after President Charles Moyer.

The following year, the WFM became involved in the Colorado Labor Wars, a struggle centered in the Cripple Creek mining district in 1903 and 1904, and took the lives of 33 union and non-union workers. The WFM initiated a series of strikes designed to extend the benefits of the union to other workers. The defeat of these strikes led to Haywood&#x27;s belief in &quot;One Big Union&quot; organized along industrial lines to bring broader working class support for labor struggles.

===Foundation of the Industrial Workers of the World===

Late in 1904, several prominent labor radicals met in Chicago to lay down plans for a new revolutionary union. A manifesto was written and sent around the country. Unionists who agreed with the manifesto were invited to attend a convention to found the new union which was to become the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). 
At 10 a.m. on June 27, 1905, Haywood addressed the crowd assembled at Brand&#x27;s Hall in Chicago. In the audience were two hundred delegates from organizations all over the country representing socialists, anarchists, miners, industrial unionists and rebel workers. Haywood opened the IWW&#x27;s first convention with the following speech:

Fellow Workers, this is the Continental Congress of the working-class. We are here to confederate the workers of this country into a working-class movement that shall have for its purpose the emancipation of the working-class from the slave bondage of capitalism. The aims and objects of this organization shall be to put the working-class in possession of the economic power, the means of life, in control of the machinery of production and distribution, without regard to capitalist masters.

Other speakers at the convention included Eugene Debs, leader of the Socialist Party of America; Mary Harris &quot;Mother&quot; Jones, an organizer for the United Mine Workers of America; and Lucy Parsons, a major labor organizer whose husband was hanged in relation to the Haymarket affair. After its foundation, the IWW would become aggressively involved in the labor movement.

===Murder trial===
On December 30, 1905, Frank Steunenberg was killed by an explosion in front of his house in Caldwell, Idaho. A former governor of Idaho, Steunenberg had clashed with the WFM in previous strikes. Harry Orchard, a former WFM member who had once acted as WFM President Charles Moyer&#x27;s bodyguard was arrested for the crime, and evidence was found in his hotel room. Famed Pinkerton detective James McParland, who had infiltrated and helped to destroy the Molly Maguires, was placed in charge of the investigation.

Before the trial, McParland ordered that Orchard be placed on death row in the Boise penitentiary, with restricted food rations and under constant surveillance. After McParland had prepared his investigation, he met with Orchard over a &quot;sumptuous lunch&quot; followed by cigars. The detective reportedly told Orchard that he could escape hanging only if he implicated the leaders of the WFM. In addition to using the threat of hanging, McParland promised food, cigars, better treatment, possible freedom, and even a possible financial reward if Orchard cooperated. The detective obtained a 64-page confession from Orchard in which the suspect took responsibility for a string of crimes and at least seventeen murders.

===Extradition===

Of the four men named by Orchard as having a part in Steunenberg&#x27;s murder, Jack Simpkins had fled, and the other three were known to be in Denver, Colorado. The prosecution feared that if they knew that Orchard was cooperating with the prosecution, the other three would also flee. At McParland&#x27;s urging, the three were arrested in Denver on February 17, 1906.

Although none of the three had set foot in Idaho while Orchard was stalking Steunenberg and planning his murder, under Idaho law, conspirators were considered to be legally present at the scene of the crime. Using this provision, the local county prosecutor in Idaho drew up extradition papers for Haywood, Moyer, and George Pettibone, which falsely alleged that they had been physically present in Idaho at the time of the murder.

McParland arrived in Denver on Thursday, February 15, and presented the extradition papers to Colorado Governor Jesse Fuller McDonald, who, by prior arrangement with Idaho Governor Frank R. Gooding, accepted them immediately. McParland had planned the arrests for early Sunday morning, when a special train would be ready to take the prisoners to Idaho. The prosecution plans were upset when Moyer went to the Denver train station on Saturday evening carrying a satchel, evidently to leave town. The police arrested him before he could board a train. Moyer&#x27;s arrest caused the police to move up the arrests of Haywood and Pettibone. The train would not be ready until Sunday morning and so the prisoners were taken to the Denver city jail, but were forbidden from communicating to lawyers or families. Since reporters began nosing around the jail anyway, the prisoners were secretly taken to the Oxford Hotel, near the train station, where they were again held &quot;incommunicado&quot;. On Sunday morning, the three men were put on the special train, guarded by Colorado militia, which sped out of Denver through Wyoming, and by nightfall they were in Idaho. To thwart any attempts to free the prisoners, the train sped through the principal towns, and stopped for water and to change engines and crew only at out-of-the-way stations.

Trade union members regarded the incident as a kidnapping that occurred to extradite them to Idaho before the courts in Denver could intervene. The extradition was so extraordinary that the president of the AFL, Samuel Gompers, directed his union to raise funds for the defense. However, the United States Supreme Court denied a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; appeal, ruling that the arrest and extradition were legal, with only Justice Joseph McKenna dissenting.

While in jail in Idaho, Haywood was put forth by the Socialist Party of Colorado as their candidate in the 1906 Colorado gubernatorial election. He finished with over 16,000 votes, just under eight percent.

===Trial===
Haywood&#x27;s trial in Boise began on May 9, 1907, with famed Chicago defense attorney Clarence Darrow defending him. The government had only the testimony of Orchard, the confessed bomber, to implicate Haywood and the other defendants, and Orchard&#x27;s checkered past and admitted violent history were skillfully exploited by Darrow during the trial, though he did not lead Orchard&#x27;s cross-examination. During the trial, Orchard admitted that he had acted as a paid informant of the Mine Owners&#x27; Association, in effect working for both sides. He also admitted to accepting money from Pinkerton detectives, and had caused explosions during mining disputes before he had met Moyer or Haywood.

After Darrow&#x27;s final summation, the jury retired on July 28, 1907. After deliberating nine hours, the jury returned on July 29 and acquitted Haywood. During the subsequent trial of Pettibone, Darrow conducted a powerful cross-examination against Orchard before falling ill and withdrawing from the trial, leaving Orrin N. Hilton of Denver to head the defense. After a second jury acquitted Pettibone, the charges against Moyer were dropped.

Despite his radical views, Haywood emerged from the trial with a national reputation. Eugene Debs called him &quot;the Lincoln of Labor.&quot; Along with his colorful background and appearance, Haywood was known for his blunt statements about capitalism. &quot;The capitalist has no heart,&quot; he often said, &quot;but harpoon him in the pocketbook and you will draw blood.&quot; Another time, he began a speech by noting, &quot;Tonight I am going to speak on the class struggle and I am going to make it so plain that even a lawyer can understand it.&quot; Yet Haywood also had a flair for dangerous hyperbole that, when quoted in newspapers, was used to justify wholesale arrests of IWW strikers. &quot;Confiscate! That&#x27;s good!&quot; he often said. &quot;I like that word. It suggests stripping the capitalist, taking something away from him. But there has got to be a good deal of force to this thing of taking.&quot;

When the WFM withdrew from the IWW in 1907, Haywood remained a member of both organizations. His murder trial had made Haywood a celebrity, and he was in demand as a speaker for the WFM. But his increasingly radical speeches became more at odds with the WFM, and in April 1908, the union announced that they had ended Haywood&#x27;s role as a WFM representative. Haywood left the WFM and devoted all his time to organizing for the IWW.

===Lawrence Textile Strike===

Haywood had left the WFM by the time the Lawrence Textile Strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, garnered national attention. On January 11, 1912, textile mill workers in Lawrence left their jobs in protest of lowered wages. Within a week, twenty thousand workers were on strike. Authorities responded by calling out police, and the strike quickly escalated into violence. Local IWW leaders Joseph Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti were jailed on charges of murdering Anna LoPizzo, a striker whom nineteen witnesses later said was killed by police gunfire, and martial law was declared. In response, Haywood and other organizers arrived to take charge of the strike.

Over the next several weeks, Haywood personally masterminded or approved many of the strike&#x27;s tactical innovations. Chief among these was his decision to send strikers&#x27; hungry children to sympathetic families in New York, New Hampshire, and Vermont. After hearing from immigrants how European strikers had used this tactic during prolonged strikes, Haywood decided to take the gamble in Lawrence, a first in American labor history. He and the IWW used announcements in socialist newspapers to solicit host families, then screened strikers to see who might be willing to send their children into the care of strangers. On February 10, 1912, the first group of &quot;Lawrence Strike Children&quot; bid tearful goodbyes to their parents and, with chaperones to guide them, boarded a train for New York. The children arrived safely in Manhattan that evening where they were taken to a meeting hall. They were soon lavished with food and clothes and would stay in New York another seven weeks. Despite their excellent treatment, officials in Lawrence and elsewhere were shocked by the move. &quot;I could scarcely believe that the strike leaders would do such a thing as this,&quot; Lawrence mayor Michael Scanlon said. &quot;Lawrence could have very easily cared for these children.&quot;

On February 24, when strikers attempted to send still more children away, police were ready. During a melée, women and children were forcibly separated, police lashed out with clubs, and dozens of strikers and their children were jailed. A national outrage resulted. The &quot;New York World&quot; wrote, &quot;The Lawrence authorities must be blind and the mill owners mad.&quot; The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; called the police response &quot;as chuckle-headed an exhibition of incompetence to deal with a strike situation as it is possible to recall&quot;. The incident led to a congressional hearing and the attention of President William Howard Taft. Nationwide publicity pressured the mill owners into cooperating with the strikers; on March 12, the owners agreed to all the demands of the strikers, officially ending the strike.

However, Haywood and the IWW were not yet finished in Lawrence; despite the success of the strike, Ettor and Giovannitti remained in prison. Haywood threatened the authorities with another strike, saying, &quot;Open the jail gates or we will close the mill gates.&quot; Legal efforts and a one-day strike on September 30 did not prompt the authorities to drop the charges. Haywood was indicted in Lawrence for misuse of strike funds, a move that kept him from returning to the city and eventually led to his arrest on the Boston Common. However, on November 26, Ettor and Giovannitti were acquitted, and upon their release were treated to a massive demonstration of public support.

===Socialist Party of America involvement===

For many years, Haywood was an active member of the Socialist Party of America. Haywood had always been largely Marxist in his political views, and campaigned for Debs during the 1908 presidential election, traveling by train with Debs around the country. Haywood also represented the Socialist Party as a delegate to the 1910 congress of the Second International, an organization working towards international socialism. In 1912, he was elected to the Socialist Party National Executive Committee.

However, the aggressive tactics of Haywood and the IWW, along with their call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism, created tension with moderate, electorally-oriented leaders of the Socialist Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on direct action and strikes, which often led to violence, and were less concerned with political tactics. When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City to the effect that he had never advocated the use of the ballot by the workers but had instead favored the tactics of direct action, an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York. In February 1913 the recall of Haywood was approved by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks of the Socialist Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.

===Other labor involvement===
In 1913, Haywood was involved in the Paterson silk strike. He and approximately 1,850 strikers were arrested during the course of the strike. Despite the long holdout and fundraising efforts, the strike ended in failure on July 28, 1913.
While in Paris in 1913 he heard about the Dublin lockout in Ireland. He collected 1000 francs in aid of the workers and travelled to Dublin.

In January 1915, Haywood replaced Vincent St. John as General Secretary-Treasurer of the IWW, which he held until October 1917. He returned to the position of GST from February 1918 until December of the same year when he was replaced by Peter Stone.

===Espionage trial===

Haywood and the IWW frequently clashed with the government during their labor actions. The onset of World War I gave the federal government the opportunity to take action against Haywood and the IWW. Using the newly passed Espionage Act of 1917 as justification, the Department of Justice raided forty-eight IWW meeting halls on September 5, 1917. The Department of Justice, with the approval of President Woodrow Wilson, then proceeded to arrest 165 IWW members for &quot;conspiring to hinder the draft, encourage desertion, and intimidate others in connection with labor disputes.&quot;

In April 1918, Haywood and 100 of the arrested IWW members began their trial, presided over by Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The trial lasted five months, the longest criminal trial up to that time; Haywood himself testified for three days. All 101 defendants were found guilty, and Haywood (along with fourteen others) was sentenced to twenty years in prison.

Despite the efforts of his supporters, Haywood was unable to overturn the conviction. On March 31, 1921, he skipped bail while out on appeal and fled to the Russian SFSR. IWW officials were taken by surprise that Haywood had jumped bail, with his own attorney declaring that, &quot;Haywood has committed hara-kiri so far as the labor movement is concerned if he has really run away. He will be disowned by the IWW and all sympathizers.&quot; A bond in the amount of $15,000 posted by millionaire supporter William Bross Lloyd was forfeited as a result of Haywood&#x27;s flight.

===Life in Soviet Russia===
In Soviet Russia, Haywood became a labor advisor to Lenin&#x27;s Bolshevik government, and served in that position until 1923. Haywood also participated in the founding of the Kuzbass Autonomous Industrial Colony. Various visitors to Haywood&#x27;s small Moscow apartment in later years recalled that he felt lonely and depressed, and expressed a desire to return to the U.S. In 1926 he took a Russian wife, though the two had to communicate in sign language, as neither spoke the other&#x27;s language.

===Death===
On May 18, 1928, Haywood died in a Moscow hospital from a stroke brought on by alcoholism and diabetes. Half of his ashes were buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis; an urn containing the other half of his ashes was sent to Chicago and buried near the Haymarket Martyrs&#x27; Monument.

==Haywood&#x27;s labor philosophy==

===Industrial unionism===

Even before Haywood first became an official with the WFM, he was convinced that the system under which working people toiled was unjust. He described the execution of the Haymarket leaders in 1887 as a turning point in his life, predisposing him toward membership in the largest organization of the day, the Knights of Labor. Haywood had watched men die in unsafe mine tunnels, and had marched with Coxey&#x27;s Army. Haywood had suffered a serious hand injury in the mines, and found that his only support came from other miners. When Haywood listened to Ed Boyce of the WFM addressing a group of miners in 1896, he discovered radical unionism and welcomed it.

Haywood also shared Boyce&#x27;s skepticism of the role played by the AFL. He criticized labor officials who were, in his view, insufficiently supportive of labor militants. For example, Haywood recalled with disdain the opening remarks of Samuel Gompers when the AFL leader appeared before Illinois Governor Richard Oglesby on behalf of the Haymarket prisoners:
I have differed all my life with the principles and methods of the condemned.
Gompers was an advocate of craft unionism, the idea that workers should be separated into unions according to their skills. The AFL disdained to organize workers who were not skilled. Furthermore, in 1900, Gompers became the first vice-president of the National Civic Federation, which was &quot;dedicated to the fostering of harmony and collaboration between capital and organized labor&quot;. But Haywood had become convinced by the experiences of striking railroad workers that a different union philosophy, some form of industrial unionism, was necessary for workers to obtain justice. This had become apparent in 1888 when the craft-organized locomotive firemen kept their engines running, helping their employers to break a strike called by the railroad engineers.

Debs had been head of the locomotive firemen&#x27;s union, but he resigned to create the American Railway Union (ARU), organized industrially to include all railroad workers. In June 1894, the ARU voted to join in solidarity with the ongoing Pullman Strike. Railroad traffic throughout the nation was &quot;largely paralyzed. The effectiveness of the industrial form of unionism was evident from the start.&quot; The strike was eventually crushed by massive government intervention that included 2600 Deputy U.S. Marshals, and 14,000 state and federal troops in Chicago alone. Debs attempted to seek help from the AFL, asking that AFL railroad brotherhood affiliates present the following proposition to the Railway Managers&#x27; Association:
...that the strikers return to work at once as a body, upon the condition that they be restored to their former positions, or, in the event of failure, to call a general strike.
Observing that the ARU was defenseless, AFL officials viewed the plight of the rival organization as an opportunity to bolster the railway brotherhoods, which the AFL was courting, and instructed all AFL affiliates to withhold help. In spite of what Haywood perceived as &quot;treachery&quot; and &quot;double-cross&quot; by the AFL leadership — the ARU members had put their own organization at risk for others, but the AFL refused to even help them try to end the strike in a draw — the power of workers crossing their trade lines and jurisdictional boundaries to join together in a fight against capital greatly impressed him. He described the revelation of such power as &quot;a great rift of light&quot;.

For Haywood, industrial union principles were later confirmed by the defeat of the WFM in the 1903–05 Cripple Creek strike due — he believed — to insufficient labor solidarity. The WFM miners had sought to extend the benefits of union to the mill workers who processed their ore. Since the government had crushed the ARU, the railroad workers were again organized along craft lines, similar to the AFL. Those same railroad unions continued to haul the ore &quot;from mines&quot; that were run by strike breakers, &quot;to mills&quot; that were run by strike breakers. &quot;The railroaders form the connecting link in the proposition that is scabby at both ends,&quot; Haywood complained. &quot;This fight, which is entering its third year, could have been won in three weeks if it were not for the fact that the trade unions are lending assistance to the mine operators.&quot; The obvious solution, it seemed to Haywood, was for all of the workers to join the same union, and to take collective action in concert against the employers. The militants of the WFM referred to the AFL as the &quot;American &quot;Separation&quot; of Labor,&quot; a criticism that was later echoed by the IWW.

===Haywood&#x27;s revolutionary imperative===

Haywood&#x27;s industrial unionism was much broader than formulating a more effective method of conducting strikes. Haywood grew up a part of the working class, and his respect for working people was genuine. He was quickly angered by the arrogance of employers &quot;who had never ... spoken to a workingman except to give orders.&quot; Having met Debs during his WFM days, Haywood had also become interested in the former railway leader&#x27;s new passion, socialism. Haywood subscribed to the belief, and with Boyce, formulated as a new motto for the WFM, that:
Labor produces all wealth; all wealth belongs to the producer thereof.
Haywood observed how the government frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d&#x27;Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges and put them in a filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.

Haywood considered the brutal conditions in Coeur d&#x27;Alene a manifestation of class warfare. In 1901 the miners agreed at the WFM convention that a &quot;complete revolution of social and economic conditions&quot; was &quot;the only salvation of the working classes&quot;.

In the WFM&#x27;s 1903–1904 struggle in Colorado, with martial law once again in force, two declarations uttered by the National Guard and recorded for posterity further clarified the relationship of the mine operator&#x27;s enforcement army—provided courtesy of the Colorado governor—to the workers. When union attorneys asked the courts to free illegally imprisoned strikers, Adjutant General Sherman Bell declared, &quot;Habeas corpus be damned, we&#x27;ll give &#x27;em post mortems.&quot; Reminded of the Constitution, one of Bell&#x27;s junior officers declared coolly, &quot;To hell with the Constitution. We&#x27;re not going by the Constitution.&quot;
General Bell had been the manager of one of the coal mines in Cripple Creek where the strike was taking place. It wasn&#x27;t any surprise to Haywood that soldiers seemed to be working in the interests of the employers; he had seen that situation before. But when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the issue to the voters, and 72 percent of the state&#x27;s voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.

To members of the WFM, it became clear that government favored the companies, and only direct action by organized workers could secure the eight-hour day for themselves. When miners in Idaho Springs and Telluride decided to strike for the eight-hour day, they were rounded up at gunpoint by vigilante groups and expelled from their communities. Warrants were issued for the arrest of the law-breaking vigilantes, but they were not acted upon.

Haywood complained that John D. Rockefeller was &quot;wielding more power with his golf sticks than could the people of Colorado with their ballots.&quot; It appeared to Haywood that the deck was stacked, and no enduring gains could be won for the workers short of changing the rules of the game. Increasingly, his industrial unionism took on a revolutionary flavor. In 1905 Haywood joined the more left-leaning socialists, labor anarchists in the Haymarket tradition, and other militant unionists to formulate the concept of revolutionary industrial unionism that animated the IWW. Haywood called this philosophy &quot;socialism with its working clothes on&quot;.

Haywood favored direct action. The socialist philosophy — which WFM supporter the Rev. Fr. Thomas J. Hagerty called &quot;slowcialism&quot; — did not seem hard-nosed enough for Haywood&#x27;s labor instincts. After the Boise murder trial, he had come to believe,

It is to the ignominy of the Socialist Party and the Socialist Labor Party that they have so seldom joined forces with the I.W.W. in these desperate political struggles.
While Haywood continued to champion direct action, he advocated the political action favored by the socialists as just one more mechanism for change, and only when it seemed relevant. At an October 1913 meeting of the Socialist Party, Haywood stated:
I advocate the industrial ballot alone when I address the workers in the textile industries of the East where a great majority are foreigners without political representation. But when I speak to American workingmen in the West I advocate both the industrial and the political ballot.
The &quot;industrial ballot&quot; referred to the direct action methods (strikes, slowdowns, etc.) of the IWW.

Haywood seemed most comfortable with a philosophy arrived at through the hard-scrabble experiences of the workers. He had the ability to translate complex economic theories into simple ideas that resonated with working people. He distilled the voluminous work of Karl Marx into a simple observation, &quot;If one man has a dollar he didn&#x27;t work for, some other man worked for a dollar he didn&#x27;t get.&quot; While Haywood respected the work of Marx, he referred to it with irreverent humor. Acknowledging his scars from dangerous mining work, and from numerous fistfights with police and militia, he liked to say, &quot;I&#x27;ve never read Marx&#x27;s Capital, but I have the marks of capital all over me.&quot;

Haywood demonstrated his Marxist roots when, confronted by the Commission on Industrial Relations with an argument about the sanctity of private property, he responded that a capitalist&#x27;s property merely represented &quot;unpaid labor, surplus value.&quot; But the forum also gave Haywood an opportunity to compare the philosophy of the IWW with that of Marx and the socialist parties. Reminded by the Commission that socialists advocated ownership of the industries by the state, Haywood remembered in his autobiography that he had drawn a clear distinction. All of industry should be owned &quot;by the workers&quot;, he observed.

===Racial unity in the labor movement===

Much of Haywood&#x27;s philosophy relating to socialism, preferring industrial unionism, his perception of the evils of the wage system, and his attitude about corporations, militias, and politicians seems to have been held in common with his WFM mentor Ed Boyce. Boyce also called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens. Unlike Boyce and many other labor leaders and organizations of the time, Haywood believed that workers of all ethnicities should organize into the same union. According to Haywood, the IWW was &quot;big enough to take in the black man, the white man; big enough to take in all nationalities – an organization that will be strong enough to obliterate state boundaries; to obliterate national boundaries.&quot;

Haywood criticized the U.S. government&#x27;s attempts to turn whites against blacks during the 1899 Coeur d&#x27;Alene labor confrontation. Haywood wrote: &quot;it was a deliberate attempt to add race prejudice ... race prejudice had been unknown among the miners.&quot; In 1912, Haywood spoke at a convention for The Brotherhood of Timber Workers in Louisiana; at the time, interracial meetings in the state were illegal. Haywood insisted that the white workers invite the African American workers to their convention, declaring:

You work in the same mills together. Sometimes a black man and a white man chop down the same tree together. You are meeting in a convention now to discuss the conditions under which you labor. Why not be sensible about this and call the Negroes into the Convention? If it is against the law, this is one time when the law should be broken.

Ignoring the law against interracial meetings, the convention invited the African American workers. The convention would eventually vote to affiliate with the IWW.

<text>Bill Callahan (born June 3, 1966) is an American singer-songwriter, who has also recorded and performed under the band name Smog. Callahan began working in the lo-fi genre, with home-made tape-albums recorded on four-track tape recorders. Later he began releasing albums with the label Drag City, to which he remains signed today.

==Career==
Callahan started out as a highly experimental artist, using substandard instruments and recording equipment. His early songs lacked melodic structure and were clumsily played on poorly tuned guitars, resulting in the dissonant sounds on his self-released cassettes and debut album &quot;Sewn to the Sky&quot;. Much of his early output was instrumental, a stark contrast to the lyrical focus of his later work. His use of lo-fi techniques was not primarily an aesthetic preference, but stemmed from his lack of resources to make and record music. Once he signed a contract with Drag City, he started to use recording studios and a greater variety of instruments for his records.

From 1993 to 2000, Callahan&#x27;s recordings grew more and more &quot;professional&quot; sounding, with more instruments, and a higher sound quality. In this period he recorded two albums with the influential producer Jim O&#x27;Rourke and Tortoise&#x27;s John McEntire, and collaborated with Neil Hagerty. Callahan also worked closely with his then-girlfriend Cynthia Dall in his early career, and they contributed vocals to each other&#x27;s albums. After 2000&#x27;s &quot;Dongs of Sevotion&quot;, Callahan began moving back to a slightly simpler instrumentation and recording style, while retaining the more consistent songwriting style he had developed over the years. This shift is apparent in albums such as &quot;Rain on Lens&quot;, &quot;Supper&quot;, and &quot;A River Ain&#x27;t Too Much to Love&quot;.

Smog&#x27;s songs are often based on simple, repetitive structures, consisting of a simple chord progression repeated for the duration of the entire song. His singing is characterized by his baritone voice. Melodically and lyrically he tends to eschew the verse-chorus approach favoured by many contemporary songwriters, preferring instead a more free-form approach relying less on melodic and lyrical repetition. Themes in Callahan&#x27;s lyrics include relationships, animals, relocation, nature, and more recently, politics. On the subject of voice in his albums, Callahan has said, &quot;It&#x27;s usually one character per record. So, the character appears in all or most of the songs on one record and then is gone. Though it makes me feel weird to talk about. Because I don&#x27;t really think in clear terms of characters. My albums as a whole could be seen as one character with many voices.&quot; His generally dispassionate delivery of lyrics and dark irony often obfuscate complex emotional and lyrical twists and turns. Critics have generally characterized his music as depressing and intensely introverted, with one critic describing it as &quot;a peep-show view into an insular world of alienation.&quot;

In 2007, Callahan released &quot;Woke on a Whaleheart&quot;, his first solo album released under his own name. &quot;Sometimes I Wish We Were an Eagle&quot; followed in April 2009. Both recordings were released through Drag City, worldwide. In 2009, Callahan contributed cover songs on four separate tribute albums to Judee Sill, Kath Bloom, Chris Knox, and Merge Records. In 2010, he released his first live album &quot;Rough Travel for a Rare Thing&quot;, which was recorded in 2007 at The Toff in Melbourne, Australia. &quot;Apocalypse&quot; was released in April 2011 to favorable reviews. Critic Sasha Frere-Jones called it &quot;my favorite of Callahan&#x27;s albums, not because it has better songs—those are scattered among at least five others – but because it does exactly what he wants it to do: it conveys an album’s coherence.&quot; A tour film chronicling Callahan&#x27;s 2011 &quot;Apocalypse&quot; tour was released in 2012.

His followup to &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Dream River&quot;, was released in September 2013. A dub remix of the album entitled &quot;Have Fun With God&quot; followed in January 2014. In 2018, Callahan was featured in the &quot;Live at Third Man Records&quot; series. This was his second live album, and features songs from Callahan&#x27;s previous three studio albums.

Callahan took a hiatus from making music after the birth of his son in 2015 and for a time he considered quitting music altogether, citing the demands of being a parent. His musical hiatus ended with the release of &quot;Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest,&quot; on June 14, 2019. It received favourable reviews, with &quot;Pitchfork&quot; contributing editor Jayson Greene referring to it as a &quot;highlight of his career&quot;. His more prolific pace has since returned with the release of &quot;Gold Record&quot;, in September 2020.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Callahan and Will Oldham collaborated on a series of cover songs along with several special guests that they released as a series of videos on YouTube. They compiled these songs into the album &quot;Blind Date Party&quot; that was released in December 2021. Callahan&#x27;s latest solo album &quot;YTI⅃AƎЯ&quot; followed in October 2022.

==Personal life==
Though he was born in Maryland, Callahan&#x27;s family spent a total of eight years living in Knaresborough in England&#x27;s North Riding of Yorkshire, with a four-year return to Maryland from 1969 to 1973. His parents worked as language analysts for the National Security Agency. He currently lives in Austin, Texas.

In 2013, he became engaged to photographer and filmmaker Hanly Banks; they were married the next year. Their son, Bass, was born in March 2015. They also have a daughter born in either 2019 or 2020.

==Books==
In July 2010 Drag City published Callahan&#x27;s &quot;Letters to Emma Bowlcut&quot;, an epistolary novel.

A book of photographs of Callahan by Chris Taylor, titled &quot;The Life and Times of William Callahan&quot;, was released in January 2013.

In October 2014, a collection of ink drawings by Callahan and lyrics spanning his first album as Smog, to &quot;Dream River&quot; was released, titled &quot;I Drive a Valence&quot;.

==Legacy==
His song &quot;Drover&quot; features prominently in the final episode of the 2018 Netflix documentary series &quot;Wild Wild Country&quot;, the title of which is drawn from the song&#x27;s chorus. His song &quot;America&quot; also plays during the credits of Episode 1.

His song “One Fine Morning” is played in episode 8 of Station Eleven. 

His cover of Kath Bloom&#x27;s &quot;The Breeze/My Baby Cries&quot; is featured in the fifth episode of the third series of &quot;Sex Education&quot;.

In November 2021, British rock band Squid covered Callahan&#x27;s song, &quot;America!&quot;.

<text>Samhita (IAST: &quot;Saṃhitā&quot;) literally means &quot;put together, joined, union&quot;, a &quot;collection&quot;, and &quot;a methodical, rule-based combination of text or verses&quot;. &quot;Saṃhitā&quot; also refers to the most ancient layer of text in the Vedas, consisting of mantras, hymns, prayers, litanies and benedictions.

Parts of &quot;Vedic Samhitas&quot; constitute the oldest living part of Hindu tradition.

==Etymology==
&quot;Samhita&quot; is a Sanskrit word from the prefix sam (सम्), &#x27;together&#x27;, and hita (हित), the past participle of the verbal root dhā (धा) &#x27;put&#x27;. The combination word thus means &quot;put together, joined, compose, arrangement, place together, union&quot;, something that agrees or conforms to a principle such as dharma or in accordance with justice, and &quot;connected with&quot;. &quot;Samhitā&quot; (संहिता) in the feminine form of the past participle, is used as a noun meaning &quot;conjunction, connection, union&quot;, &quot;combination of letters according to euphonic rules&quot;, or &quot;any methodically arranged collection of texts or verses&quot;.

==Discussion==
In the most generic context, a &quot;Samhita&quot; may refer to any methodical collection of text or verses: any shastra, sutra, or Sanskrit Epic, along with Vedic texts, might be referred to as a &quot;Samhita&quot;.

&quot;Samhita&quot;, however, in contemporary literature typically implies the earliest, archaic part of the Vedas. These contain mantras – sacred sounds with or without literal meaning, as well as panegyrics, prayers, litanies and benedictions petitioning nature or Vedic deities. Vedic Samhita refer to mathematically precise metrical archaic text of each of the &quot;Vedas&quot; (Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda).

The Vedas have been divided into four styles of texts – the Samhitas (mantras and benedictions), the Brahmanas (text on rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices), the Aranyakas (commentaries on rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices), and the Upanishads (text discussing meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge). The Samhitas are sometimes identified as &quot;karma-khanda&quot; (कर्म खण्ड, action / ritual-related section), while the Upanishads are identified as &quot;jnana-khanda&quot; (ज्ञान खण्ड, knowledge / spirituality-related section). The Aranyakas and Brahmanas are variously classified, sometimes as the ceremonial &quot;karma-khanda&quot;, other times (or parts of them) as the &quot;jnana-khanda&quot;.

The &quot;Vedic Samhitas&quot; were chanted during ceremonies and rituals, and parts of it remain the oldest living part of Hindu tradition.

A collective study of Vedas and later text suggests that the compendium of &quot;Samhitas&quot; and associated Vedic texts were far larger than currently available. However, most have been lost at some point or over a period of Indian history.

Historically, there were five recensions of the Rigveda Samhita, but now only one survives. The Samaveda has three Samhitas, two of which are quite similar, while the Atharvaveda has two. The term &quot;samhita&quot; also appears in titles of some non-Vedic texts like the Pancharatra Samhitas and the Brhat Samhita, an astrological work, as well as in the Bhagavata Purana, which self-references as a samhita.

==Examples==

===Rig veda===
The Gayatri mantra is among the famous Hindu mantras. It is found in Rig Veda Samhita.
:ॐ भूर्भुवस्वः। तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यम्। भर्गो देवस्य धीमहि। धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात्

– Rig Veda 3.62.10

===Sama veda===
Weber noted that the &quot;Samhita&quot; of Samaveda is an anthology taken from the Rigveda-Samhita. The difference is in the refinement and application of arts such as melody, meters of music, and literary composition. Thus, the root hymn that later became the &quot;Rathantara&quot; (Excellent Chariot) mantra chant is found in both Rigveda and Samaveda Samhitas, as follows,

:&quot;Rigveda form&quot;:
:Abhi tva sura nonumo &#x27;dugdha iva dhenavah | isanam asya jagatah svardrsam isanam indra tasthusah

:&quot;Samaveda form&quot;:
:obhitvasuranonumova | adugdha iva dhenava isanamasya jagatassuvardrsam | isanama indra | ta sthu sa o va ha u va | as ||

:&quot;Translation&quot; (same for both):
:We cry out for you, hero, like unmilked cows to the lord of the living world !
:To the lord of the unmoving world whose eye is the sun, O Indra !

===Yajur veda===

The Yajur Veda consists of:

1. Āpastamba-mantra-pāṭhá (Kr̥ṣṇa-yajur-vedá)

2. Kāṭha-saṁhitā́ (Kr̥ṣṇa-yajur-vedá)

3. Kapiṣṭhala-kāṭha-saṁhitā́ (Kr̥ṣṇa-yajur-vedá)

4. Māitrāyaṇa-saṁhitā́ (Kr̥ṣṇa-yajur-vedá)

5. Tāittirīya-saṁhitā́ (Kr̥ṣṇa-yajur-vedá)

6. Vājasaneya-saṁhitā́ (Şukla-yajur-vedá) with (Kāṇvá and Mā́dhyaṁdina as sub-divisions)

Of these six, the Tāittirīya and the Vājasaneya saṁhitā́-s are the most extant ones. The Āpastamba-mantra-pāṭhá consists of mantras only found in the Āpastamba Kalpa sūtrá literature of the Kr̥ṣṇa-yajur-vedá.

The hymns in Section 4.1.5 of the Yajurveda &quot;Samhita&quot;, dedicated to several ancient deities, state:

===Atharva veda===
A hymn in the Atharva Veda Samhita, for example, is a woman&#x27;s petition to deity Agni, to attract suitors and a good husband.
===Post-Vedic Samhitas===
There are many well known books written in the post-vedic period, also known as samhitas, because the word “samhita” also means “systematic compilation of knowledge”. Vedic samhitas should not be confused with these samhitas of post-vedic period.

Some post-vedic Samhitas are –
*Ashtavakra Gita
*Bhrigu Samhita
*Charaka Samhita
*Garga Samhita
*Gheranda Samhita
*Kashyap Samhita
*Shiva Samhita
*Brihat Samhita
*Sushruta Samhita (a treatise on food and medicine)
*Yogayajnavalkya Samhita.

<text>The Social Democratic Party of America (SDP) was a short-lived political party in the United States established in 1898.

The group was formed out of elements of the Social Democracy of America (SDA) and was a predecessor to the Socialist Party of America which was established in 1901.

== Organizational history ==
=== Forerunners ===
Following the defeat of the 1894 American Railway Union (ARU) strike, the former populist Eugene V. Debs exhaustively read socialist literature provided to him by Milwaukee publisher Victor L. Berger and other independent socialists. Debs converted to the socialist cause, believing in the aftermath of the suppression of the ARU strike by federal troops that trade union action alone was insufficient to bring about the liberation of the working class.

In this same summer, smarting from a failed effort at establishing a socialist community near Tennessee City, Tennessee, publisher Julius Wayland established in Kansas City a new socialist weekly newspaper, &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, eventually moving the operation for financial reasons to a small town in southeastern Kansas called Girard. This paper was a major success, quickly gaining a paid subscribership of 80,000 and invigorating the socialist movement. A new colonization project was conceived through this paper, the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth, which aimed to seed an undecided western state with socialist colonies and to electorally take over the government of that state, thus establishing a foothold for socialism in America. Debs was named the head of this project and the planets were thus aligned for the formation of a new national political organization. A convention of the remnant of the American Railway Union was called for June 15, 1897, in Chicago.

=== Formation ===

The convention which gave birth to the new organization actually began as a final conclave of the ARU, which opened Tuesday morning June 15, 1897, in Handel Hall, Chicago. Director William E. Burns called the meeting to order and A.B. Adair of the Typographical Union presided. President of the ARU Eugene V. Debs delivered an address to the assembled delegates. The first three days of the convention were occupied with hearing reports of officers and of committees and closing up the affairs of the ARU.

On Friday, June 18, the organization formally changed its name to the Social Democracy of America and adopted a Declaration of Principles. The convention was then thrown open to delegates representing other organizations. Those represented included the Socialist Labor Party, the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, the Scandinavian Cooperative League, the Metal Polishers and Buffers&#x27; Union, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, the Chicago Labor Union Exchange and an assortment of other organizations.

The Social Democracy of America initially did not have an official head—its executive powers were vested in an executive board, with a chairman (Eugene V. Debs) merely presiding over the activities of that body. The unit of organization of the Social Democracy was the local branch of at least five members. On the first Tuesday in April, each of these local branches was to elect a single representative to the state union, the state-level governing body. On the first Tuesday in May, all the state unions were to assemble and elect one representative each to the National Council, which was in turn to meet on the first Tuesday in May and elect a five-member Executive Board, which was to hold office for a term of one year. An initiation fee of 25 cents was set and monthly dues pegged at 15 cents per month. Office of the organization was established at 504 Trude Building, Corner of Randolph and Wabash Aves., Chicago.

The Social Democracy of America proved to be a short lived and disparate group of Marxists, trade unionists (especially veterans of the ARU), Owenite socialists, populists and unaffiliated radicals. The party initially sought to establish socialist cooperative colonies. In August 1897, a three-member Colonization Committee was established, consisting of Col. Richard J. Hinton (Washington, D.C.), Wilfred P. Borland (Bay City, Michigan) and Cyrus Field Willard (Chicago). This trio explored the possibility of establishing a colony to seed the future Cooperative Commonwealth in the Cumberland plateau of Tennessee. As an associated side-project seems to have made a concrete proposal to the city of Nashville to construct 75 miles of railroad for the city—a project which would put to work the blacklisted and unemployed former members of the ARU and Social Democracy and help to build the notion of social ownership of productive capital in a single moment, it was hoped.
In addition to the &quot;colonizationists&quot;, who favored concentration of their efforts on building a model economic unit and gaining the achievement of socialism through the power of example there emerged a &quot;political action wing&quot;, which sought to achieve socialism through political organization and use of the electoral process, starting with concentration on a single state.

The colonization scheme failed to materialize by the time of the second convention of the SDA, held in Chicago from June 7–11, 1898, and attended by some 70 delegates. Frederic Heath, the first historian of the movement, recounted the gathering in a 1900 book: Chairman Debs presided. Outwardly the meeting presented the picture of a pleasing and harmonious gathering, creditable to the Socialist movement. Under the surface, however, there was a hostility that meant almost certain rupture. The presence of such well-known Anarchists as Mrs. Lucy Parsons, wife of one of the victims of the outrageous Haymarket trial, Emma Goldman, common-law wife of Berkman, who shot Manager Frick at the time of the Homestead strike, and others, all enlisted under the colonization wing, the members of which were now using the phrases of the Anarchists at sneering at political action, showed that a parting of the ways must come. It rapidly developed that the colonization forces had organized to get control of the convention and had even gone to the length of organizing local &#x27;branches on paper&#x27; within three days before the convention, in order to increase its list of delegates and make its control a certainty. These branches had been organized by William Burns and the other members of the national board, with the exception of Messrs. Debs and Keliher.

In his speech to the convention delivered June 8, Debs outlined his ideas on the goal of the Social Democracy and the tactics which the organization had best follow: The mission of Social Democracy is to awaken the producer to a consciousness that he is a Socialist and to give him courage by changing his conditions. I have not changed in regard to our procedure. Give me 10,000 men, aye, 1,000 in a western state, with access to the sources of production, and we will change the economic conditions and we will convince the people of that state, win their hearts and their intelligence. We will lay hold upon the reins of government, and plant the flag of Socialism on the state house.

The Colonization Committee delivered a lengthy report, detailing the proposed purchase of a Colorado gold mine and the establishment of a colony around that operation. This imaginative (or hallucinatory) plan fanned the sentiments of the party&#x27;s political actionists (who called themselves the &quot;antis&quot;), who found themselves more anxious than ever to disentangle themselves from what they perceived as an unsavory stock-selling scheme. A caucus was held of the &quot;anti&quot; faction on the third evening of the convention at which the group determined to fight the colonization program without compromise.

During the fourth day of the proceedings on Friday, June 10, things turned increasingly bitter when James Hogan of Utah delivered a two-hour report as vice chairman of the national executive board and treasurer, during the course of which he directly attacked Secretary Sylvester Keliher (a political actionist), alleging incompetence or dishonesty. The day was absorbed by a bitter debate over the program of the organization, with the main object of division a minority report put forward by John F. Lloyd on behalf of the colonizationists (disparagingly called the &quot;goldbrick&quot; faction by the &quot;antis&quot;). The arguments went on all day Friday June 10, finishing at 2:30 am with a vote in which the colonization minority plank was carried by a vote of 53 to 37. The meeting was adjourned and many delegates straggled off to bed, the anti-colonization faction already having decided to depart the organization and to establish a political party of their own in the aftermath of defeat on the colonization issue. The &quot;anti&quot; faction gathered in Parlor A of the hotel across the street where most of them were staying and in hushed tones continued their discussion until 4 am.

June 11, 1898 marked the conclusion of the convention of the Social Democracy of America as well as the day that 33 delegates bolted to hold a meeting establishing themselves as the Social Democratic Party of America.

=== Chicago Social Democratic Party ===

The political action wing of the Social Democracy bolted the final day of the June 1898 Convention of the Social Democracy of America and instead held their own gathering at Hull House on South Halsted Street in Chicago. Since the gathering was held by a bolting faction of a convention formally called by the Social Democracy of America, subsequent party histories do not regard this first organizational meeting as a formal Convention—although the party organ established at the same time, the &quot;Social Democratic Herald&quot;, did consider it as such.

The fledgling group issued its organizational platform in the form of a Statement of Principles on June 11, 1898. In this document, the group categorized socialism as &quot;the collective ownership of the means of production for the common good and welfare&quot; and called upon &quot;the wage-workers and all those in sympathy with their historical mission to realize a higher civilization&quot; to sever ties with existing conservative capitalist and reformist political parties and to instead work for &quot;the establishment of a system of cooperative production and distribution&quot;.

The split of the Social Democracy in America into a colonization organization on the one hand and the electorally-oriented Social Democratic Party of America on the other demoralized many American socialists. According to founding member Frederic Heath, &quot;the split ... disheartened many Socialists, so that the party grew very slowly. It was not until fully a year after [the split] that real headway began to be made, outside of a few party strongholds like Massachusetts, Milwaukee, and St. Louis&quot;.

A political-action faction led by Victor Berger left the party convention and founded the Social Democratic Party as an explicitly socialist alternative to the mainstream parties. Later that year, the Social Democratic Party managed early success when two members of the party were elected to the Massachusetts General Court.

The colonizationists had taken the Social Democracy of Americans periodical (&quot;Social Democrat&quot;) so the Social Democratic Party started a new national publication (&quot;Social Democratic Herald&quot;) during the negotiations for the unity of the Socialist Party of America, when it was decided that the party would not publish an official national publication so the newspaper was sold to the Milwaukee Social Democrats led by Victor Berger.

Membership data on the organization is scarce. In his official report to the 1900 convention of the party, National Secretary-Treasurer Theodore Debs indicated that as of March 1, 1900, the dues-paying membership of the party was 4,536, participating in 226 active local branches. Of these, the younger Debs brother indicated that 985 members and 53 branches had been established during the previous 60 days, implying a significantly lower membership for the years 1898 and 1899. In the 1900 presidential election, Debs stood as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate and received some 87,000 votes. This was considerably more than the established Socialist Labor Party.

=== Springfield Social Democratic Party ===
In addition to the Chicago-based Social Democratic Party of America mentioned above, there was a second Social Democratic Party of America based in Springfield, Massachusetts. In the second half of the 1890s, the Socialist Labor Party of America was showing signs of growth in size and influence. Divisions arose within the organization over the group&#x27;s relationship to the American Federation of Labor and the party&#x27;s internal regime.

The organization was deeply split between two hostile groups. On one side was a so-called &quot;administration faction&quot;, represented by the party&#x27;s national officials, such as Henry Kuhn, Henry Vogt and Lucien Sanial; and the editors and staffs of the official party publications, &quot;The People&quot; (English) and &quot;Vorwärts&quot; (German). This Regular faction included most prominently Daniel DeLeon, editor of &quot;The People&quot; and the single most influential individual inside the party. Against their continued reign stood an opposition faction, centered on the independently owned German-language socialist daily, the &quot;Newyorker Volkszeitung&quot;, the editor of which was Alexander Jonas.
The latter group was particularly hostile to the trade union policy adopted at the 1896 Convention, believing it to have alienated erstwhile allies in the existing labor movement and thus marginalized the party. It also resented the rigid party discipline practiced by the National Executive Committee, which included the expulsions of dissidents and the suspension of entire sections. This festering split erupted in open conflict in July 1899 over the election of a new General Committee (akin to a City Committee) of Section New York, a group to which the 1896 party convention purportedly delegated the power to elect the committee for the national organization. This new committee was to in turn have the power of selecting editors of the party&#x27;s printed organs. Section New York, narrowly controlled by the dissident faction, elected such a General Committee, which met for the first time on July 8, 1899.

This gathering quickly dissolved in acrimony and a second meeting was hastily scheduled to be held two nights later by the dissident faction. This second session, elected Henry Slobodin as national secretary and named a new editor of &quot;The People,&quot; to replace DeLeon, to whom the dissidents felt personal enmity.

This action of the dissident general committee was not recognized by the sitting National Executive Committee, the meeting held to be illegally constitute and the committee and the official press continued to conduct their regular operations. The dissidents declared themselves the rightful owners of the Socialist Labor Party&#x27;s name, logo and press and established themselves as such. Two parallel organizations, each designating itself the Socialist Labor Party and issuing a publication called &quot;The People&quot;, thus emerged in 1899, naming competing full slates of candidates for the elections of 1899. The matter was taken to the &quot;capitalist&quot; courts. The dissidents were derisively referred to in polemics as the &quot;Kangaroos&quot; by the Regulars—the analogy being drawn between the dissidents&#x27; free-and-loose interpretation of party legality in the calling and conduct of their reorganizational meetings and the &quot;Kangaroo courts&quot; of the wild west.

The dissident faction was bolstered by the support of allies in Chicago, centered on an English language newspaper called &quot;The Workers&#x27; Call&quot;, edited by A.M. Simons. This group initially attempted to circumvent the New York committee of the party by declaring itself the official center of the organization in light of the interparty emergency that erupted in the Summer of 1899 as a result of the rupture of Section New York. In response, Section Chicago was suspended by the New York committee. Dissident Section Chicago moved in fairly short order towards unity the largely German New York party right oppositionists.

An Emergency National Convention was called by the pro-AFL/anti-DeLeon &quot;Kangaroo&quot; dissidents. This gathering was held in Rochester, New York, attended by 59 delegates and proclaimed itself as the official 10th National Convention of the Socialist Labor Party. Henry L. Slobodin was formally elected executive secretary of the Rochester organization, which tentatively continued to call itself the Socialist Labor Party and to issue its own English language newspaper under the name of &quot;The People.&quot; The convention repudiated the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance, the hated &quot;dual union&quot; umbrella organization established by the regular party in 1896 in opposition to the AFL, instead proclaiming its support for the struggles of all trade unions without regard to affiliation. A new platform was adopted and revised by-laws approved. The gathering also enacted a resolution calling for unity with the Social Democratic Party and named a Unity Committee, headed by Morris Hillquit, to attend the forthcoming convention of the party and to there make a unity appeal.

When the New York courts ruled decisively in favor of the claim of DeLeon, Kuhn and the Regulars in the matter of the ownership of the name logo and publication of the Socialist Labor Party against the claim of the dissidents, the Rochester group changed the name of their organization to Social Democratic Party of America, anticipating a rapid merger with Berger, Debs and the Midwestern organization of the same name. The Eastern group established party headquarters in Springfield, Massachusetts and became known as the Springfield SDP in distinction to the Chicago SDP.

According to the report of National Secretary William Butscher made to the July 1901 convention that established the Socialist Party of America, the Springfield SDP had a paid membership of 5,310 in the continental United States, with another 1,080 members in Puerto Rico, for a total of 6,390 as of January 1, 1901. A membership of 7,328 in 147 locals was reported by Butscher for the first six months of 1901, with another 82 locals failing to report.

<doc id="324945" wikidata="Q2923055" url="?curid=324945" title="Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America">
<text>Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) is a national organization of local chapters which provide voluntary after-school programs for young people. The organization, which holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code, has its headquarters in Atlanta, with regional offices in Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, New York City and Los Angeles. BGCA is tax-exempt and partially funded by the federal government.

==History==
The first Boys&#x27; Club was founded in 1860 in Hartford, Connecticut, by three women, Elizabeth Hamersley and sisters Mary and Alice Goodwin. In 1906, 53 independent Boys&#x27; Clubs came together in Boston to form a national organization, the Federated Boys&#x27; Clubs. In 1931, the organization renamed itself Boys&#x27; Clubs of America, and in 1990, to Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. As of 2010, there are over 4,000 autonomous local clubs, which are affiliates of the national organization. In total these clubs serve more than four million boys and girls. Clubs can be found in all 50 states as well as locations in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa and US military bases. In total, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America employ about 50,000 staff members.
&quot;The Chronicle of Philanthropy&quot; ranked Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America number one among youth organizations for the 13th consecutive year, and number 12 among all nonprofit organizations. The Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America is the official charity of Major League Baseball. 

Denzel Washington, a former club member, has been the spokesperson for Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America for over 25 years, since 1993. and in 2006, for the organization&#x27;s 100 anniversary, helped put together together with Daniel Paisner, a book that underscores the lesson: “If you want to change the world, start by changing the life of a child”. &quot;A hand to guide me&quot; features examples from leaders as they tell their life-changing stories of mentorship, when as youngsters they were guided by a caring adult, which shaped the rest of their life, including over 70 of America&#x27;s leading personalities in theatre, sports, business, and politics such as Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, Whoopi Goldberg, Muhammad Ali, Yogi Berra, Toni Morrison, Cal Ripken Jr. and Colin Powell.

<text>An accelerometer is a device that measures the proper acceleration of an object. Proper acceleration is the acceleration (the rate of change of velocity) of the object relative to an observer who is in free fall (that is, relative to an inertial frame of reference). Proper acceleration is different from coordinate acceleration, which is acceleration with respect to a given coordinate system, which may or may not be accelerating. For example, an accelerometer at rest on the surface of the Earth will measure an acceleration due to Earth&#x27;s gravity straight upwards of about &quot;g&quot; ≈ 9.81 m/s2. By contrast, an accelerometer that is in free fall will measure zero acceleration.

Accelerometers have many uses in industry, consumer products, and science. Highly sensitive accelerometers are used in inertial navigation systems for aircraft and missiles. In unmanned aerial vehicles, accelerometers help to stabilize flight. Micromachined micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers are used in handheld electronic devices such as smartphones, cameras and video-game controllers to detect movement and orientation of these devices. Vibration in industrial machinery is monitored by accelerometers. Seismometers are sensitive accelerometers for monitoring ground movement such as earthquakes.
When two or more accelerometers are coordinated with one another, they can measure differences in proper acceleration, particularly gravity, over their separation in space—that is, the gradient of the gravitational field. Gravity gradiometry is useful because absolute gravity is a weak effect and depends on the local density of the Earth, which is quite variable.

A single-axis accelerometer measures acceleration along a specified axis. A multi-axis accelerometer detects both the magnitude and the direction of the proper acceleration, as a vector quantity, and is usually implemented as several single-axis accelerometers oriented along different axes.
==Physical principles==

An accelerometer measures proper acceleration, which is the acceleration it experiences relative to freefall and is the acceleration felt by people and objects. Put another way, at any point in spacetime the equivalence principle guarantees the existence of a local inertial frame, and an accelerometer measures the acceleration relative to that frame. Such accelerations are popularly denoted g-force; i.e., in comparison to standard gravity.

An accelerometer at rest relative to the Earth&#x27;s surface will indicate approximately 1 g &quot;upwards&quot; because the Earth&#x27;s surface exerts a normal force upwards relative to the local inertial frame (the frame of a freely falling object near the surface). To obtain the acceleration due to motion with respect to the Earth, this &quot;gravity offset&quot; must be subtracted and corrections made for effects caused by the Earth&#x27;s rotation relative to the inertial frame.

The reason for the appearance of a gravitational offset is Einstein&#x27;s equivalence principle, which states that the effects of gravity on an object are indistinguishable from acceleration. When held fixed in a gravitational field by, for example, applying a ground reaction force or an equivalent upward thrust, the reference frame for an accelerometer (its own casing) accelerates upwards with respect to a free-falling reference frame. The effects of this acceleration are indistinguishable from any other acceleration experienced by the instrument so that an accelerometer cannot detect the difference between sitting in a rocket on the launch pad, and being in the same rocket in deep space while it uses its engines to accelerate at 1 g. For similar reasons, an accelerometer will read &quot;zero&quot; during any type of free fall. This includes use in a coasting spaceship in deep space far from any mass, a spaceship orbiting the Earth, an airplane in a parabolic &quot;zero-g&quot; arc, or any free-fall in a vacuum. Another example is free-fall at a sufficiently high altitude that atmospheric effects can be neglected.

However, this does not include a (non-free) fall in which air resistance produces drag forces that reduce the acceleration until constant terminal velocity is reached. At terminal velocity, the accelerometer will indicate 1 g acceleration upwards. For the same reason a skydiver, upon reaching terminal velocity, does not feel as though he or she were in &quot;free-fall&quot;, but rather experiences a feeling similar to being supported (at 1 g) on a &quot;bed&quot; of uprushing air.

Acceleration is quantified in the SI unit metres per second per second (m/s2), in the cgs unit gal (Gal), or popularly in terms of standard gravity (&quot;g&quot;).

For the practical purpose of finding the acceleration of objects with respect to the Earth, such as for use in an inertial navigation system, a knowledge of local gravity is required. This can be obtained either by calibrating the device at rest, or from a known model of gravity at the approximate current position.

==Structure==

A basic mechanical accelerometer is a damped proof mass on a spring. When the accelerometer experiences an acceleration, Newton&#x27;s third law causes the spring&#x27;s compression to adjust to exert an equivalent force on the mass to counteract the acceleration. Since the spring&#x27;s force scales linearly with amount of compression (according to Hooke&#x27;s law) and because the spring constant and mass are known constants, a measurement of the spring&#x27;s compression is also a measurement of acceleration. The system is damped to prevent oscillations of the mass and spring interfering with measurements. However, the damping causes accelerometers to have a frequency response.

Many animals have sensory organs to detect acceleration, especially gravity. In these, the proof mass is usually one or more crystals of calcium carbonate otoliths (Latin for &quot;ear stone&quot;) or statoconia, acting against a bed of hairs connected to neurons. The hairs form the springs, with the neurons as sensors. The damping is usually by a fluid. Many vertebrates, including humans, have these structures in their inner ears. Most invertebrates have similar organs, but not as part of their hearing organs. These are called statocysts.

Mechanical accelerometers are often designed so that an electronic circuit senses a small amount of motion, then pushes on the proof mass with some type of linear motor to keep the proof mass from moving far. The motor might be an electromagnet or in very small accelerometers, electrostatic. Since the circuit&#x27;s electronic behavior can be carefully designed, and the proof mass does not move far, these designs can be very stable (i.e. they do not oscillate), very linear with a controlled frequency response. (This is called servo mode design.)

In mechanical accelerometers, measurement is often electrical, piezoelectric, piezoresistive or capacitive. Piezoelectric accelerometers use piezoceramic sensors (e.g. lead zirconate titanate) or single crystals (e.g. quartz, tourmaline). They are unmatched in high frequency measurements, low packaged weight, and resistance to high temperatures. Piezoresistive accelerometers resist shock (very high accelerations) better. Capacitive accelerometers typically use a silicon micro-machined sensing element. They measure low frequencies well.

Modern mechanical accelerometers are often small &quot;micro-electro-mechanical systems&quot; (MEMS), and are often very simple MEMS devices, consisting of little more than a cantilever beam with a proof mass (also known as &quot;seismic mass&quot;). Damping results from the residual gas sealed in the device. As long as the Q-factor is not too low, damping does not result in a lower sensitivity.

Under the influence of external accelerations, the proof mass deflects from its neutral position. This deflection is measured in an analog or digital manner. Most commonly, the capacitance between a set of fixed beams and a set of beams attached to the proof mass is measured. This method is simple, reliable, and inexpensive. Integrating piezoresistors in the springs to detect spring deformation, and thus deflection, is a good alternative, although a few more process steps are needed during the fabrication sequence. For very high sensitivities quantum tunnelling is also used; this requires a dedicated process making it very expensive. Optical measurement has been demonstrated in laboratory devices.

Another MEMS-based accelerometer is a thermal (or convective) accelerometer. It contains a small heater in a very small dome. This heats the air or other fluid inside the dome. The thermal bubble acts as the proof mass. An accompanying temperature sensor (like a thermistor; or thermopile) in the dome measures the temperature in one location of the dome. This measures the location of the heated bubble within the dome. When the dome is accelerated, the colder, higher density fluid pushes the heated bubble. The measured temperature changes. The temperature measurement is interpreted as acceleration. The fluid provides the damping. Gravity acting on the fluid provides the spring. Since the proof mass is very lightweight gas, and not held by a beam or lever, thermal accelerometers can survive high shocks. Another variation uses a wire to both heat the gas and detect the change in temperature. The change of temperature changes the resistance of the wire. A two dimensional accelerometer can be economically constructed with one dome, one bubble and two measurement devices.

Most micromechanical accelerometers operate &quot;in-plane&quot;, that is, they are designed to be sensitive only to a direction in the plane of the die. By integrating two devices perpendicularly on a single die a two-axis accelerometer can be made. By adding another &quot;out-of-plane&quot; device, three axes can be measured. Such a combination may have much lower misalignment error than three discrete models combined after packaging.

Micromechanical accelerometers are available in a wide variety of measuring ranges, reaching up to thousands of &quot;g&quot;″s. The designer must compromise between sensitivity and the maximum acceleration that can be measured.

==Applications==

===Engineering===

Accelerometers can be used to measure vehicle acceleration.
Accelerometers can be used to measure vibration on cars, machines, buildings, process control systems and safety installations. They can also be used to measure seismic activity, inclination, machine vibration, dynamic distance and speed with or without the influence of gravity. Applications for accelerometers that measure gravity, wherein an accelerometer is specifically configured for use in gravimetry, are called gravimeters.

===Biology===

Accelerometers are also increasingly used in the biological sciences. High frequency recordings of bi-axial or tri-axial acceleration allows the discrimination of behavioral patterns while animals are out of sight. Furthermore, recordings of acceleration allow researchers to quantify the rate at which an animal is expending energy in the wild, by either determination of limb-stroke frequency or measures such as overall dynamic body acceleration Such approaches have mostly been adopted by marine scientists due to an inability to study animals in the wild using visual observations, however an increasing number of terrestrial biologists are adopting similar approaches. For example, accelerometers have been used to study flight energy expenditure of Harris&#x27;s Hawk (&quot;Parabuteo unicinctus&quot;). Researchers are also using smartphone accelerometers to collect and extract mechano-biological descriptors of resistance exercise. Increasingly, researchers are deploying accelerometers with additional technology, such as cameras or microphones, to better understand animal behaviour in the wild (for example, hunting behaviour of Canada lynx).

===Industry===
Accelerometers are also used for machinery health monitoring to report the vibration and its changes in time of shafts at the bearings of rotating equipment such as turbines, pumps, fans, rollers, compressors, or bearing fault
which, if not attended to promptly, can lead to costly repairs. Accelerometer vibration data allows the user to monitor machines and detect these faults before the rotating equipment fails completely.

===Building and structural monitoring===
Accelerometers are used to measure the motion and vibration of a structure that is exposed to dynamic loads. Dynamic loads originate from a variety of sources including:

* Human activities – walking, running, dancing or skipping
* Working machines – inside a building or in the surrounding area
* Construction work – driving piles, demolition, drilling and excavating
* Moving loads on bridges
* Vehicle collisions
* Impact loads – falling debris
* Concussion loads – internal and external explosions
* Collapse of structural elements
* Wind loads and wind gusts
* Air blast pressure
* Loss of support because of ground failure
* Earthquakes and aftershocks

Under structural applications, measuring and recording how a structure dynamically responds to these inputs is critical for assessing the safety and viability of a structure. This type of monitoring is called Health Monitoring, which usually involves other types of instruments, such as displacement sensors -Potentiometers, LVDTs, etc.- deformation sensors -Strain Gauges, Extensometers-, load sensors -Load Cells, Piezo-Electric Sensors- among others.

===Medical applications===

Zoll&#x27;s AED Plus uses CPR-D•padz which contain an accelerometer to measure the depth of CPR chest compressions.

Within the last several years, several companies have produced and marketed sports watches for runners that include footpods, containing accelerometers to help determine the speed and distance for the runner wearing the unit.

In Belgium, accelerometer-based step counters are promoted by the government to encourage people to walk a few thousand steps each day.

Herman Digital Trainer uses accelerometers to measure strike force in physical training.

It has been suggested to build football helmets with accelerometers in order to measure the impact of head collisions.

Accelerometers have been used to calculate gait parameters, such as stance and swing phase. This kind of sensor can be used to measure or monitor people.

===Navigation===
An inertial navigation system is a navigation aid that uses a computer and motion sensors (accelerometers) to continuously calculate via dead reckoning the position, orientation, and velocity (direction and speed of movement) of a moving object without the need for external references. Other terms used to refer to inertial navigation systems or closely related devices include inertial guidance system, inertial reference platform, and many other variations.

An accelerometer alone is unsuitable to determine changes in altitude over distances where the vertical decrease of gravity is significant, such as for aircraft and rockets. In the presence of a gravitational gradient, the calibration and data reduction process is numerically unstable.

===Transport===

Accelerometers are used to detect apogee in both professional and in amateur rocketry.

Accelerometers are also being used in Intelligent Compaction rollers. Accelerometers are used alongside gyroscopes in inertial navigation systems.

One of the most common uses for MEMS accelerometers is in airbag deployment systems for modern automobiles. In this case, the accelerometers are used to detect the rapid negative acceleration of the vehicle to determine when a collision has occurred and the severity of the collision. Another common automotive use is in electronic stability control systems, which use a lateral accelerometer to measure cornering forces. The widespread use of accelerometers in the automotive industry has pushed their cost down dramatically. Another automotive application is the monitoring of noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH), conditions that cause discomfort for drivers and passengers and may also be indicators of mechanical faults.

Tilting trains use accelerometers and gyroscopes to calculate the required tilt.

===Volcanology===

Modern electronic accelerometers are used in remote sensing devices intended for the monitoring of active volcanoes to detect the motion of magma.

===Consumer electronics===

Accelerometers are increasingly being incorporated into personal electronic devices to detect the orientation of the device, for example, a display screen.

A &quot;free-fall sensor&quot; (FFS) is an accelerometer used to detect if a system has been dropped and is falling. It can then apply safety measures such as parking the head of a hard disk to prevent a head crash and resulting data loss upon impact. This device is included in the many common computer and consumer electronic products that are produced by a variety of manufacturers. It is also used in some data loggers to monitor handling operations for shipping containers. The length of time in free fall is used to calculate the height of drop and to estimate the shock to the package.

====Motion input====

Some smartphones, digital audio players and personal digital assistants contain accelerometers for user interface control; often the accelerometer is used to present landscape or portrait views of the device&#x27;s screen, based on the way the device is being held. Apple has included an accelerometer in every generation of iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, as well as in every iPod nano since the 4th generation. Along with orientation view adjustment, accelerometers in mobile devices can also be used as pedometers, in conjunction with specialized applications.

Automatic Collision Notification (ACN) systems also use accelerometers in a system to call for help in event of a vehicle crash. Prominent ACN systems include OnStar AACN service, Ford Link&#x27;s 911 Assist, Toyota&#x27;s Safety Connect, Lexus Link, or BMW Assist. Many accelerometer-equipped smartphones also have ACN software available for download. ACN systems are activated by detecting crash-strength accelerations.

Accelerometers are used in vehicle Electronic stability control systems to measure the vehicle&#x27;s actual movement. A computer compares the vehicle&#x27;s actual movement to the driver&#x27;s steering and throttle input. The stability control computer can selectively brake individual wheels and/or reduce engine power to minimize the difference between driver input and the vehicle&#x27;s actual movement. This can help prevent the vehicle from spinning or rolling over.

Some pedometers use an accelerometer to more accurately measure the number of steps taken and distance traveled than a mechanical sensor can provide.

Nintendo&#x27;s Wii video game console uses a controller called a Wii Remote that contains a three-axis accelerometer and was designed primarily for motion input. Users also have the option of buying an additional motion-sensitive attachment, the Nunchuk, so that motion input could be recorded from both of the user&#x27;s hands independently. Is also used on the Nintendo 3DS system.

Sleep phase alarm clocks use accelerometric sensors to detect movement of a sleeper, so that it can wake the person when he/she is not in REM phase, in order to awaken the person more easily.

====Sound recording====
A microphone or eardrum is a membrane that responds to oscillations in air pressure. These oscillations cause acceleration, so accelerometers can be used to record sound. A 2012 study found that voices can be detected by smartphone accelerometers in 93% of typical daily situations.

Conversely, carefully designed sounds can cause accelerometers to report false data. One study tested 20 models of (MEMS) smartphone accelerometers and found that a majority were susceptible to this attack.

====Orientation sensing====

A number of 21st-century devices use accelerometers to align the screen depending on the direction the device is held (e.g., switching between portrait and landscape modes). Such devices include many tablet PCs and some smartphones and digital cameras. The Amida Simputer, a handheld Linux device launched in 2004, was the first commercial handheld to have a built-in accelerometer. It incorporated many gesture-based interactions using this accelerometer, including page-turning, zoom-in and zoom-out of images, change of portrait to landscape mode, and many simple gesture-based games.

As of January 2009, almost all new mobile phones and digital cameras contain at least a tilt sensor and sometimes an accelerometer for the purpose of auto image rotation, motion-sensitive mini-games, and correcting shake when taking photographs.

====Image stabilization====

Camcorders use accelerometers for image stabilization, either by moving optical elements to adjust the light path to the sensor to cancel out unintended motions or digitally shifting the image to smooth out detected motion. Some stills cameras use accelerometers for anti-blur capturing. The camera holds off capturing the image when the camera is moving. When the camera is still (if only for a millisecond, as could be the case for vibration), the image is captured. An example of the application of this technology is the Glogger VS2, a phone application which runs on Symbian based phones with accelerometers such as the Nokia N96. Some digital cameras contain accelerometers to determine the orientation of the photo being taken and also for rotating the current picture when viewing.

====Device integrity====
Many laptops feature an accelerometer which is used to detect drops. If a drop is detected, the heads of the hard disk are parked to avoid data loss and possible head or disk damage by the ensuing shock.

===Gravimetry===
A gravimeter or gravitometer, is an instrument used in gravimetry for measuring the local gravitational field. A gravimeter is a type of accelerometer, except that accelerometers are susceptible to all vibrations including noise, that cause oscillatory accelerations. This is counteracted in the gravimeter by integral vibration isolation and signal processing. Though the essential principle of design is the same as in accelerometers, gravimeters are typically designed to be much more sensitive than accelerometers in order to measure very tiny changes within the Earth&#x27;s gravity, of 1 &quot;g&quot;. In contrast, other accelerometers are often designed to measure 1000 &quot;g&quot; or more, and many perform multi-axial measurements. The constraints on temporal resolution are usually less for gravimeters, so that resolution can be increased by processing the output with a longer &quot;time constant&quot;.

If done without a user&#x27;s knowledge or consent, this is referred to as an inference attack. Additionally, millions of smartphones could be vulnerable to software cracking via accelerometers.

<text>Royal Trux was an American alternative rock band active from 1987 to 2001, and again from 2015 to 2019 consisting of Neil Hagerty (vocals, guitar) and Jennifer Herrema (vocals).

==History==
While still a teenager, Hagerty joined Washington D.C. garage punk band Pussy Galore, led by Jon Spencer, and subsequently relocated to New York. During his time in there, Hagerty convinced his bandmates to release a cassette-only remake of the entire Rolling Stones album &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot;. While he gained underground notoriety for his work with Pussy Galore, Hagerty reportedly viewed it as a job and intended to pursue his own artistic vision with his girlfriend, Jennifer Herrema, under the name Royal Trux.

Hagerty and Herrema released their first album, &quot;Royal Trux&quot;, in 1988. After moving to San Francisco, Royal Trux released the experimental double-album &quot;Twin Infinitives.&quot;

After &quot;Twin Infinitives&quot;, Royal Trux released an untitled album (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Skulls&quot; record because of its sleeve artwork). Forgoing the experimentalism of &quot;Twin Infinitives&quot;, the band instead opted for a more lo-fi approach, recording on an 8-track. The arguably atypical lyricism and sonic atonality of their first two albums was largely abandoned in favor of a more stripped, direct sound.

Following the release of their untitled album, Hagerty and Herrema were joined by guitarist Michael Kaiser and drummer Ian Willers to complete their fourth full-length, &quot;Cats and Dogs&quot;. The songwriting remained highly experimental, but was more melodic, which was revealed on tracks such as &quot;The Flag,&quot; &quot;The Spectre,&quot; and &quot;Turn of the Century.&quot; Around this time, the band signed with Matador and a Royal Trux record was assigned a catalog number for an album which never appeared.

During the corporate interest in underground music that followed Nirvana&#x27;s breakthrough success in 1991, Royal Trux signed a three-record contract totaling over $1 million with the major label Virgin. The label viewed it as a way to gain credibility with other, more promising indie bands that they hoped to attract. Some of the money went into buying a house in Virginia and converting it to a studio, where the band recorded themselves and others (such as The Make-Up). According to interviews, the band also kicked their drug habit at this time. (They spent a prior album advance on drugs and are known for their heroin abuse.) The band added a considerably heavier rhythm section with Dan Brown on bass guitar and Chris Pyle (son of Lynyrd Skynyrd drummer Artimus Pyle) on drums. Pyle left after a brief period and was replaced by Ken Nasta, a prominent Jacksonville drummer, formerly with Chain of Fools, The Fenwicks and many others. They also added a percussionist named Rob Armstrong for a short period. In 1995, they released &quot;Thank You&quot;, recorded almost completely live in the studio with producer David Briggs. Next came &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot;. While the band received mainstream media exposure during their time on Virgin (Herrema appeared in Calvin Klein print and TV ads from 1995 to 2000), Virgin was reportedly unhappy with &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot;. The band was unwilling to record a third record for the label. Royal Trux returned to their own record label Drag City.

On Drag City, the band released &quot;Accelerator&quot; in 1998, &quot;Veterans of Disorder&quot; in 1999, and &quot;Pound for Pound&quot; in 2000.

Royal Trux also released the triple-LP &quot;Singles, Live, Unreleased&quot;, as well as a pair of EPs (&quot;3-Song EP&quot; and &quot;Radio Video&quot;) and substantial video and webwork.

Hagerty and Herrema often credited themselves as Adam and Eve for their production work. They separated as a couple and dissolved the band following the release of &quot;Pound for Pound&quot;. Since then, both have recorded albums for Drag City; Hagerty under his own name and as The Howling Hex, and Herrema under the name RTX. After several releases RTX updated their moniker to Black Bananas.

Two reunion shows were announced for August 16, 2015 at The Observatory in Santa Ana, California as part of the Berserktown festival and December 19, 2015 at Webster Hall in New York City.

They played several more shows around the US throughout 2016. They played their first UK show since reuniting at the Victoria Warehouse for TRANSFORMER on May 28, 2017.

In 2017, the band released a live album, &quot;Platinum Tips + Ice Cream&quot;, which received positive reviews. In early 2018 the band officially left Drag City and signed a new record deal with Mississippi-based indie label Fat Possum Records. The label also made the band&#x27;s entire discography available on streaming outlets for the first time. The new LP was expected in early 2019.
The band released their first studio album in 19 years, &quot;White Stuff&quot;, on March 1, 2019, on Fat Possum Records.

During an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in March 2019 Hagerty announced he was leaving the band, stating &quot;I&#x27;m not touring. She steamrollered right over me, man. I&#x27;m not ... I&#x27;m just doing this as a favour to Fat Possum. The album – I didn&#x27;t approve of it. I have no idea what it is. I&#x27;ve heard like 10 seconds of one song. I&#x27;m out, man.&quot; In response, Herrema stated &quot;He&#x27;s done this on every tour. He always shows up, always does the tours.&quot;

On April 30, after having previously been rescheduled due to Herrema&#x27;s unspecified legal issues, the planned promotional tour for &quot;White Stuff&quot; was cancelled entirely. The band has not been active since and both members have referred to the band reunion finishing in interviews since &quot;White Stuff&quot; was released.

== Legacy ==
Royal Trux&#x27;s music has been significantly influential on a number of underground bands. Dan Koretzky, co-founder of Drag City (to which the band were signed), noted: &quot;If everyone who listened to the Velvet Underground started their own band, then everyone who listened to Royal Trux started reaching beyond their grasp, musical or otherwise&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Stereogum&quot; called them &quot;the most misunderstood band in indie rock. [...] In a world where experimenting and taking chances with music often takes a backseat to image and playing it safe, Royal Trux flipped the script and did the opposite; because they could, and because, for them, it was always, and only, about keeping themselves interested and happy with the music. Their goal from the outset was to deconstruct rock ‘n’ roll and put it back together as they saw fit, with their own artistic vision. It wasn&#x27;t always pretty, but good art often isn&#x27;t. What is true is that their music has stood the test of time and sounds just as, if not more, relevant today than it did when conceived.&quot;

According to Dan Hancox of &quot;The National News&quot;, &quot;their influence can be heard in everything from the bluesy sonic assaults made by The Kills or The White Stripes, to Interpol&#x27;s angular guitars.&quot; Both Jamie Hince &amp; Alison Mosshart of The Kills are notable fans of the band, as are Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream, Stephen Malkmus of Pavement &amp; Derek Miller of Sleigh Bells. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth cited the band&#x27;s debut album as an influence on their music, calling it &quot;the coolest record of that year, it was reckless, had a casual vision and sense of danger to it, it was completely experimental and it rocked. Much more so than any record Red Hot Chili Peppers had that year, or whatever.&quot; 

Nate Young of Wolf Eyes named &quot;Twin Infinitives&quot; one of his favorite albums of all time, praising their avant-garde use of new technology as being influential on his music. Will Oldham, who had worked with the band on his “Trudy Dies”/“Come In” single, named them &quot;hugely influential upon&quot; his &quot;professional musical life.&quot; MGMT identified the band as a big influence on their own creative risk-taking, with Benjamin Goldwasser praising them as &quot;amazing songwriters — they disguise pop songs really well.” Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip cited Royal Trux as his favourite band, stating that &quot;they really set the bar for what I thought a band could be like live. Hot Chip never really sounded like Royal Trux, but the joy of repetition in &quot;Over and Over&quot; is as much to do with their spirit as anything ‘carnal’ (to quote &quot;Run Shaker Life&quot;, the song they opened that set with). They changed it all for me&quot;.

<doc id="324954" wikidata="Q193850" url="?curid=324954" title="Sea Peoples">
<text>The Sea Peoples were a group of tribes hypothesized to have attacked Egypt and other Eastern Mediterranean regions around 1200 BC during the Late Bronze Age. The hypothesis was first proposed by the 19th century Egyptologists Emmanuel de Rougé and Gaston Maspero, on the basis of primary sources such as the reliefs on the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu. Subsequent research developed the hypothesis further, attempting to link these sources to other Late Bronze Age evidence of migration, piracy, and destruction. While initial versions of the hypothesis regarded the Sea Peoples as a primary cause of the Late Bronze Age collapse, more recent versions generally regard them as a symptom of events which were already in motion before their purported attacks.

The Sea Peoples included well-attested groups such as the Lukka, as well as others such as the Weshesh whose origins are unknown. Hypotheses regarding the origin of the various groups are the source of much speculation. Several of them appear to have been Aegean tribes, while others may have originated in Sicily, Sardinia, Cyprus, and Western Anatolia.

==History of the concept==

The concept of the Sea Peoples was first proposed by Emmanuel de Rougé, curator of the Louvre, in his 1855 work &quot;Note on Some Hieroglyphic Texts Recently Published by Mr. Greene&quot;, as an interpretation of the battles of Ramesses III described on the Second Pylon at Medinet Habu, based upon recent photographs of the temple by John Beasley Greene. De Rougé noted that &quot;in the crests of the conquered peoples the Sherden and the Teresh bear the designation of the &quot;, in a reference to the prisoners depicted at the base of the Fortified East Gate. In 1867, de Rougé published his &quot;Excerpts of a dissertation on the attacks directed against Egypt by the peoples of the Mediterranean in the 14th century BC&quot;, which focused primarily on the battles of Ramesses II and Merneptah and which proposed translations for many of the geographic names included in the hieroglyphic inscriptions. De Rougé later became chair of Egyptology at the Collège de France and was succeeded by Gaston Maspero. Maspero built upon de Rougé&#x27;s work and published &quot;The Struggle of the Nations&quot;, in which he described the theory of the seaborne migrations in detail in 1895–96 for a wider audience, at a time when the idea of population migrations would have felt familiar to the general population.

The migration theory was taken up by other scholars such as Eduard Meyer and became the generally accepted theory amongst Egyptologists and Orientalists. Since the early 1990s, however, it has been brought into question by a number of scholars.

The historical narrative stems primarily from seven Ancient Egyptian sources and although in these inscriptions the designation &quot;of the sea&quot; does not appear in relation to all of these peoples, the term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; is commonly used in modern publications to refer to the following nine peoples.

==Primary documentary records==
The Medinet Habu inscriptions from which the Sea Peoples concept was first described remain the primary source and &quot;the basis of virtually all significant discussions of them&quot;.

Three separate narratives from Egyptian records refer to more than one of the nine peoples, found in a total of six sources. The seventh and most recent source referring to more than one of the nine peoples is a list (Onomasticon) of 610 entities, rather than a narrative. These sources are summarized in the table below.

===Ramesses II narrative===
Possible records of sea peoples generally or in particular date to two campaigns of Ramesses II, a pharaoh of the militant 19th Dynasty: operations in or near the delta in Year 2 of his reign and the major confrontation with the Hittite Empire and allies at the Battle of Kadesh in his Year 5. The years of this long-lived pharaoh&#x27;s reign are not known exactly, but they must have comprised nearly all of the first half of the 13th century BC.

In his Second Year, an attack of the Sherden, or Shardana, on the Nile Delta was repulsed and defeated by Ramesses, who captured some of the pirates. The event is recorded on Tanis Stele II. An inscription by Ramesses II on the stela from Tanis which recorded the Sherden raiders&#x27; raid and subsequent capture speaks of the continuous threat they posed to Egypt&#x27;s Mediterranean coasts:

The Sherden prisoners were subsequently incorporated into the Egyptian army for service on the Hittite frontier by Ramesses and fought as Egyptian soldiers in the Battle of Kadesh. Another stele usually cited in conjunction with this one is the &quot;Aswan Stele&quot; (there were other stelae at Aswan), which mentions the king&#x27;s operations to defeat a number of peoples including those of the &quot;Great Green (the Egyptian name for the Mediterranean)&quot;.

The Battle of Kadesh was the outcome of a campaign against the Hittites and their allies in the Levant in the pharaoh&#x27;s Year 5. The imminent collision of the Egyptian and Hittite empires became obvious to both, and they both prepared campaigns against the strategic midpoint of Kadesh for the next year. Ramesses divided his Egyptian forces, which were then ambushed piecemeal by the Hittite army and nearly defeated. Ramesses was separated from his forces and had to fight singlehandedly to get back to his troops. He then mustered several counterattacks while waiting for reinforcements. Once the reinforcements from the South and East arrived, the Egyptians managed to drive the Hittites back to Kadesh. While it was a strategic Egyptian victory, neither side managed to attain their operational objectives.

At home, Ramesses had his scribes formulate an official description, which has been called &quot;the Bulletin&quot; because it was widely published by inscription. Ten copies survive today on the temples at Abydos, Karnak, Luxor and Abu Simbel, with reliefs depicting the battle. The &quot;Poem of Pentaur&quot;, describing the battle, also survived.

The poem relates that the previously captured Sherden were not only working for the Pharaoh but were also formulating a plan of battle for him; i.e. it was their idea to divide Egyptian forces into four columns. There is no evidence of any collaboration with the Hittites or malicious intent on their part, and if Ramesses considered it, he never left any record of that consideration.

The poem lists the peoples who went to Kadesh as allies of the Hittites. Amongst them are some of the sea peoples spoken of in the Egyptian inscriptions previously mentioned, and many of the peoples who would later take part in the great migrations of the 12th century BC (see Appendix A to the Battle of Kadesh).

===Merneptah narrative===

The major event of the reign of the Pharaoh Merneptah (1213–1203 BC), 4th king of the 19th Dynasty, was his battle at Perire in the western delta in the 5th and 6th years of his reign, against a confederacy termed &quot;the Nine Bows&quot;. Depredations of this confederacy had been so severe that the region was &quot;forsaken as pasturage for cattle, it was left waste from the time of the ancestors&quot;.

The pharaoh&#x27;s action against them is attested in a single narrative found in three sources. The most detailed source describing the battle is the Great Karnak Inscription; two shorter versions of the same narrative are found in the &quot;Athribis Stele&quot; and the &quot;Cairo Column&quot;. The &quot;Cairo column&quot; is a section of a granite column now in the Cairo Museum, which was first published by Maspero in 1881 with just two readable sentences – the first confirming the date of Year 5 and the second stating: &quot;The wretched [chief] of Libya has invaded with ——, being men and women, Shekelesh (S&#x27;-k-rw-s) ——&quot;. The &quot;Athribis stela&quot; is a granite stela found in Athribis and inscribed on both sides, which like the Cairo column, was first published by Maspero two years later in 1883. The Merneptah Stele from Thebes describes the reign of peace resulting from the victory but does not include any reference to the Sea Peoples.

The Nine Bows were acting under the leadership of the king of Libya and an associated near-concurrent revolt in Canaan involving Gaza, Ascalon, Yenoam and the Israelites. Exactly which peoples were consistently in the Nine Bows is not clear, but present at the battle were the Libyans, some neighboring Meshwesh, and possibly a separate revolt in the following year involving peoples from the eastern Mediterranean, including the Kheta (or Hittites), or Syrians, and (in the Israel Stele) for the first time in history, the Israelites. In addition to them, the first lines of the Karnak inscription include some sea peoples, which must have arrived in the Western Delta or from Cyrene by ship:

Later in the inscription Merneptah receives news of the attack:

&quot;His majesty was enraged at their report, like a lion&quot;, assembled his court and gave a rousing speech. Later, he dreamed he saw Ptah handing him a sword and saying, &quot;Take thou (it) and banish thou the fearful heart from thee.&quot; When the bowmen went forth, says the inscription, &quot;Amun was with them as a shield.&quot; After six hours, the surviving Nine Bows threw down their weapons, abandoned their baggage and dependants, and ran for their lives. Merneptah states that he defeated the invasion, killing 6,000 soldiers and taking 9,000 prisoners. To be sure of the numbers, among other things, he took the penises of all uncircumcised enemy dead and the hands of all the circumcised, from which history learns that the Ekwesh were circumcised, a fact causing some to doubt they were Greek.

===Ramesses III narrative===

A number of primary sources about the Sea Peoples pertain to the reign of Ramesses III, who reigned from 1186 to 1155 BC. The battles were later recorded in two long inscriptions from his Medinet Habu mortuary temple, which are physically separate and somewhat different from one another. The Year 8 campaign is the best-recorded Sea Peoples invasion.

The fact that several civilizations collapsed around 1175 BC has led to the suggestion that the Sea Peoples may have been involved at the end of the Hittite, Mycenaean and Mitanni kingdoms. The American Hittitologist Gary Beckman writes, on page 23 of &quot;Akkadica 120&quot; (2000):

Ramesses&#x27; comments about the scale of the Sea Peoples&#x27; onslaught in the eastern Mediterranean are confirmed by the destruction of the states of Hatti, Ugarit, Ascalon and Hazor around this time. As the Hittitologist Trevor Bryce observes, &quot;It should be stressed that the invasions were not merely military operations, but involved the movements of large populations, by land and sea, seeking new lands to settle.&quot;

This situation is confirmed by the Medinet Habu temple reliefs of Ramesses III which show that &quot;the Peleset and Tjekker warriors who fought in the land battle [against Ramesses III] are accompanied in the reliefs by women and children loaded in ox-carts.&quot;
The inscriptions of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu record three victorious campaigns against the Sea Peoples that are considered bona fide, in Years 5, 8 and 12, as well as three considered spurious, against the Nubians and Libyans in Year 5 and the Libyans with Asiatics in Year 11. During Year 8, some Hittites were operating with the Sea Peoples.

The inner west wall of the second court describes the invasion of Year 5. Only the Peleset and Tjeker are mentioned, but the list is lost in a lacuna. The attack was two-pronged, one by sea and one by land. That is, the Sea Peoples divided their forces. Ramesses was waiting in the Nile mouths and trapped the enemy fleet there. The land forces were defeated separately.

The Sea Peoples attacked again Year 8 with a similar result. The campaign is recorded more extensively on the inner northwest panel of the first court. It is possible, but not generally believed, that the dates are only those of the inscriptions and both refer to the same campaign.

In Ramesses&#x27; Year 8, the Nine Bows appear as a &quot;conspiracy in their isles&quot;. This time, they are revealed unquestionably as Sea Peoples: the Peleset, Tjeker, Shekelesh, Denyen and Weshesh, which are classified as &quot;foreign countries&quot; in the inscription. They camped in Amor and sent a fleet to the Nile.

He had built a fleet especially for the occasion, hidden it in the mouths of the Nile, and posted coast watchers. The enemy fleet was ambushed there, their ships overturned, and the men dragged up on shore and executed ad hoc.

The land army was also routed within Egyptian controlled territory. Additional information is given in the relief on the outer side of the east wall. This land battle occurred in the vicinity of Djahy against &quot;the northern countries&quot;. When it was over, several chiefs were captive: of Hatti, Amor and Shasu among the &quot;land peoples&quot; and the Tjeker, &quot;Sherden of the sea&quot;, &quot;Teresh of the sea&quot; and Peleset or Philistines.

The campaign of Year 12 is attested by the Südstele found on the south side of the temple. It mentions the Tjeker, Peleset, Denyen, Weshesh and Shekelesh.

Papyrus Harris I of the period, found behind the temple, suggests a wider campaign against the Sea Peoples but does not mention the date. In it, the persona of Ramses III says, &quot;I slew the Denyen (D&#x27;-yn-yw-n) in their isles&quot; and &quot;burned&quot; the Tjeker and Peleset, implying a maritime raid of his own. He also captured some Sherden and Weshesh &quot;of the sea&quot; and settled them in Egypt. As he is called the &quot;Ruler of Nine Bows&quot; in the relief of the east side, these events probably happened in Year 8; i.e. the Pharaoh would have used the victorious fleet for some punitive expeditions elsewhere in the Mediterranean.

The Rhetorical Stela to Ramesses III, Chapel C, Deir el-Medina records a similar narrative.

===Onomasticon of Amenope===
The Onomasticon of Amenope, or Amenemipit (amen-em-apt), gives slight credence to the idea that the Ramesside kings settled the Sea Peoples in Canaan. Dated to about 1100 BC (at the end of the 22nd dynasty) this document simply lists names. After six place names, four of which were in Philistia, the scribe lists the Sherden (Line 268), the Tjeker (Line 269) and the Peleset (Line 270), who might be presumed to occupy those cities. The Story of Wenamun on a papyrus of the same cache also places the Tjeker in Dor at that time. The fact that the Biblical maritime Tribe of Dan was initially located between the Philistines and the Tjekker, has prompted some to suggest that they may have originally been Denyen. Sherden seem to have been settled around Megiddo and in the Jordan Valley, and Weshwesh (connected by some with the Biblical tribe of Asher) may have been settled further north.

==Other documentary records==
===Egyptian single-name sources===
Other Egyptian sources refer to one of the individual groups without reference to any of the other groups.

The Amarna letters, around the mid-14th century BC, including four relating to the Sea Peoples:
* EA 151 refers to the Denyen, in a passing reference to the death of their king;
* EA 38 refers to the Lukka, who are being accused of attacking the Egyptians in conjunction with the Alashiyans (Cypriotes), with the latter having stated that the Lukka were seizing their villages.
* EA 81, EA 122 and EA 123 refer to the Sherden. The letters at one point refer to a Sherden man as an apparent renegade mercenary, and at another point to three Sherden who are slain by an Egyptian overseer.

Padiiset&#x27;s Statue refers to the Peleset, the Cairo Column refers to the Shekelesh, the Story of Wenamun refers to the Tjekker, and 13 further Egyptian sources refer to the Sherden.

===Byblos===

The earliest ethnic group later considered among the Sea Peoples is believed to be attested in Egyptian hieroglyphs on the Abishemu obelisk found in the Temple of the Obelisks at Byblos by Maurice Dunand. The inscription mentions kwkwn son of rwqq- (or kukun son of luqq), transliterated as Kukunnis, son of Lukka, &quot;the Lycian&quot;. The date is given variously as 2000 or 1700 BC

===Ugarit===
Some Sea Peoples appear in four of the Ugaritic texts, the last three of which seem to foreshadow the destruction of the city around 1180 BC. The letters are therefore dated to the early 12th century. The last king of Ugarit was Ammurapi ( 1191–1182 BC), who, throughout this correspondence, is quite a young man.
* RS 34.129, the earliest letter, found on the south side of the city, from &quot;the Great King&quot;, presumably Suppiluliuma II of the Hittites, to the prefect of the city. He says that he ordered the king of Ugarit to send him Ibnadushu for questioning, but the king was too immature to respond. He, therefore, wants the prefect to send the man, whom he promises to return. What this language implies about the relationship of the Hittite empire to Ugarit is a matter of interpretation. Ibnadushu had been kidnapped by and had resided among a people of Shikala, probably the Shekelesh, &quot;who lived on ships&quot;. The letter is generally interpreted as an interest in military intelligence by the king.
* RS L 1, RS 20.238 and RS 20.18, are a set from the Rap&#x27;anu Archive between a slightly older Ammurapi, now handling his own affairs, and Eshuwara, the grand supervisor of Alasiya. Evidently, Ammurapi had informed Eshuwara, that an enemy fleet of 20 ships had been spotted at sea. Eshuwara wrote back and inquired about the location of Ammurapi&#x27;s own forces. Eshuwara also noted that he would like to know where the enemy fleet of 20 ships are now located. Unfortunately for both Ugarit and Alasiya, neither kingdom was able to fend off the Sea People&#x27;s onslaught, and both were ultimately destroyed. A letter by Ammurapi (RS 18.147) to the king of Alasiya—which was in fact a response to an appeal for assistance by the latter—has been found by archaeologists. In it, Ammurapi describes the desperate plight facing Ugarit. Ammurapi, in turn, appealed for aid from the viceroy of Carchemish, which actually survived the Sea People&#x27;s onslaught; King Kuzi-Teshub I, who was the son of Talmi-Teshub—a direct contemporary of the last ruling Hittite king, Suppiluliuma II—is attested in power there, running a mini-empire which stretched from &quot;Southeast Asia Minor, North Syria ... [to] the west bend of the Euphrates&quot; from c. 1175 BC to 990 BC. Its viceroy could only offer some words of advice for Ammurapi.

== Groups ==
The list of Sea Peoples groups include some which are securely identified and others which are not.

=== Lukka ===
The Lukka people are known from numerous other Hittite and ancient Egyptian records. While the Lukka lands were located in the later region of Lycia, Lukka people appear to have been highly mobile. The Lukka were never a unified kingdom, instead having a decentralized political structure. The Lukka people were famously fractious, with Hittite and Egyptian records describing them as raiders, rebels, and pirates.
Lukka people fought against the Hittites as part of the Assuwa confederation, later fought for the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh.

=== Karkiya ===
Karkiya was a region in western Anatolia known from references in Hittite and Egyptian records. Karkiya was governed by a council of chiefs rather than a king, and was not a unified political entity. The Karkiyans had relations with the Hittite Empire, but were never part of the empire proper. Relations with the Hittites had ups and downs, and Karkiyan soldiers fought for the Hittites at the Battle of Kadesh, most likely as mercenaries. The name has been argued to be related to later terms for Caria, though the linguistic connection is not certain.

=== Peleset ===

Historians generally identify the &quot;Peleset&quot; with the later Philistines. The Peleset are generally regarded as originating somewhere within the Aegean cultural area; evidence for this identification comes from , which associates the Philistines with Caphtor and Casluhim, and , which mentions the Caphtorim settling in Gaza. Aegean-style material remains such as Philistine Bichrome ware, as well as genetic evidence suggesting that immigrants from Europe settled in sites such as Ashkalon at the beginning of the Iron Age. Both genetic and archaeological evidence suggests that any newcomers quickly acculturated and intermarried with local populations.

=== Shekelesh ===
The Shekelesh appear in the earlier Great Karnak Inscription, where they are described as auxiliary troops of the Libyan ruler Meryey. In the inscription, the Pharaoh Merneptah claims that he killed between 200 and 222 of them. They may also appear in Hittite records as the seafaring &quot;Shikalayu&quot; (Hittite: 𒅆𒅗𒆷𒅀𒌋 &quot;ši-ka-la-ia/u-u&quot;), though this connection is speculative. It has been hypothesized that the Shekelesh have some connection to Sicily, though evidence is sparse, and proposals vary as to whether Sicily was their original homeland, or if they settled there after the Bronze Age.

=== Sherden ===


The Sherden are previously mentioned in the records of Ramesses II, who claimed to have defeated them in his second year (1278 BC) when they attempted to raid Egypt&#x27;s coast. The pharaoh subsequently incorporated many of them into his personal guard. They may also appear in the Amarna Letters, with their name rendered in Akkadian as &quot;še-er-ta-an-nu&quot;. Based on onomastic similarities, similar weapons, presence in the same places of the Mediterranean and similar relationships with other peoples there, and other analysis of historical and archaeological sources, some archaeologists have proposed to identify the Sherden with the Nuragic civilization of Sardinia. Potential further evidence for this position comes from 12th century Nuragic pottery found at Pyla-Kokkinokremos, a fortified settlement in Cyprus.

=== Weshesh ===
The &quot;Weshesh&quot; are the most sparsely attested among the Sea People. They are only found in documents pertaining to the reign of Ramesses III, and no visual representation of them has ever been identified.

=== Ekwesh and Denyen ===

The &quot;Ekwesh&quot; and the &quot;Denyen&quot; have been tentatively identified with the Ancient Greek ethnonyms and , which are attested in the Homeric epics.

=== Tjeker ===

<text>Audio Video Coding Standard (AVS) refers to the digital audio and digital video series compression standard formulated by the Audio and Video coding standard workgroup of China. Work began in 2002, and three generations of standards were published.

The first generation AVS standard includes &quot;Information Technology, Advanced Audio Video Coding, Part 2: Video&quot; (AVS1) and &quot;Information Technology, Advanced Audio Video Coding Part 16: Radio Television Video&quot; (AVS+.) For the second generation, referred to as AVS2, the primary application target was ultra-high-definition television video, supporting the efficient compression of ultra-high-resolution (4K and above), high-dynamic-range videos, and was published as IEEE international standard IEEE 1857.4. An industry alliance was established to develop and promote AVS standards. A patent pool charges a small royalty for terminal products (like TVs,) excluding content providers and operators.

The AVS3 codec was added to DVB&#x27;s media delivery toolbox.

==Organizations==

=== Workgroup ===

The AVS workgroup was founded in June 2002 to cooperate with Chinese enterprises and scientific research institutions, to formulate and revise common technical standards such as digital audio and digital video&#x27;s compression, decompression, processing and representation, thus to provide efficient and economic coding/decoding technologies for digital audio and digital video devices and systems, serving the high-resolution digital broadcasting, high-density digital laser storage media, wireless broadband multimedia communication, Internet broadband streaming media, and other applications.

The workgroup is headed by Gao Wen, the academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, the professor and Ph.D. supervisor of Peking University, and the deputy director of the National Natural Science Fund Committee, consisting of a requirement group, system group, video group, audio group, test group, intellectual property group and other departments. The first setback was when China did not use AVS for its own digital television broadcast system in 2003.

=== Patent pool ===

A patent pool which manages and authorizes the patents was founded on September 20, 2004. The committee was the first patent pool management institution in China. An independent corporate association, the Beijing Haidian District Digital Audio and Video Standard Promotion Center, is registered in the Civil Affairs Bureau of Haidian District of Beijing City. for patent technologies included in the standard, as the expert committee and the main business decision-making institution of the promotion center. The royalty for the first generation AVS standard was only one yuan per terminal. The plan was to charge a small amount of royalty only for the terminal, excluding the contents, as well as software services on the Internet.

=== Alliance ===
The AVS Industry Alliance, short for Zhongguancun Audio Visual Industry Technology Innovation Alliance, was formed in May 2005 in Beijing by twelve entities, including TCL Group Co., Ltd., Skyworth Group Research Institute, Huawei Technology Co., Ltd., Hisense Group Co., Ltd., Haier Group Co., Ltd., Beijing Haier Guangke Co., Ltd., Inspur Group Co., Ltd., Joint Source Digital Audio Video Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd., New Pudong District Mobile Communication Association, Sichuan Changhong Co., Ltd., Shanghai SVA (Group) Central Research Institute, Zte Communication Co., Ltd., and Zhongguancun Hi-Tech Industry Association. The organization is also known as AVSA, and it collaborates with &quot;AVS Workgroup&quot; and &quot;AVS Patent Pool Management Committee&quot; as part of the &quot;Three Carriages.&quot;

==First generation ==

The first generation AVS standard included Chinese national standard &quot;Information Technology, Advanced Audio Video Coding, Part 2: Video&quot; (AVS1 for short, GB label：GB／T 20090.2-2006) and &quot;Information Technology, Advanced Audio Video Coding Part 16: Radio Television Video&quot; (AVS+ for short, GB label: GB/T 20090.16-2016). A test hosted by the Radio and Television Planning Institute of the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT, later part of the National Radio and Television Administration) shows: if the AVS1 bitrate is half of MPEG-2 standard, the coding quality will reach excellent for both standard definition or high definition; if the bitrate is less than 1/3, it also reaches good-excellent levels. The AVS1 standard video part was promulgated as the Chinese national standard in February 2006.
Around this time, AVS was considered for use in the enhanced versatile disc format, although products never reached the market.

During the May 7–11, 2007 meeting of the ITU-T (ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector), AVS1 was one of the standards available for Internet Protocol television (IPTV) along with MPEG-2, H.264 and VC-1. On June 4, 2013, the AVS1 video part was issued by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as standard IEEE1857-2013, 
AVS+ is not only the radio, film and television industry standard GY/T 257.1-2012 &quot;Advanced Audio Video Coding for Radio and Television, Part 1: Video&quot; issued by the SARFT on July 10, 2012, but also the enhanced version of AVS1.

==Second generation ==

The second-generation AVS standard included the series of Chinese national standard &quot;Information Technology, Efficient Multi Media Coding&quot; (AVS2). AVS2 mainly faces the transmission of extra HD TV programs, 
The SARFT issued AVS2 video as the industry standard in May 2016, and as the Chinese national standard on December 30, 2016. 
AVS2 was published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as standard 1857.4-2018 in August, 2019.

A test showed the coding efficiency of AVS2 more than doubled that of AVS+, and the compression rate surpassed the international standard HEVC (H.265). Compared with the first generation AVS standard, the second can save half transmission bandwidth.
===Features===

AVS2 adopts a hybrid-coding framework, and the whole coding process includes modules such as intra-frame prediction, inter-frame prediction, transformation, quantization, inverse quantization and inverse transformation, loop filter and entropy coding. It owns technical features as followings:

*Flexible Coding Structure Partition
**In order to satisfy the requirements of HD and Ultra HD resolution videos for the compression efficiency, AVS2 adopts a block partition structure based on the quadtree, including the CU (Coding Unit), PU (Prediction Unit) and TU (Transform Unit). An image is partitioned into LCU (Largest CU) of fixed size, which is iterated and partitioned into a series of CUs in the form of quadtree. Each CU contains a luminance-coding block and two corresponding chrominance-coding blocks (the size of the block unit below refers to the luminance coding block). Compared with the traditional macro block, the partition structure based on the quadtree is more flexible, with the CU size extended from 8×8 to 64×64.
**The PU stipulates all prediction modes of CU, and it is the basic unit for the prediction, including intra-frame and inter-frame prediction. The maximum size of PU is not permitted to exceed that of the current CU it belongs to. On the basis of AVS1 square intra-frame prediction blocks, the non-square intra-frame prediction block partition is added. Meanwhile, on the basis of the symmetric prediction block partition, the inter-frame prediction also adds 4 asymmetric partition ways.
**Besides CU and PU, AVS2 also defines a transformation unit TU for the prediction of residual transformation and quantization. TU is the basic unit of transformation and quantization, defined in CU like PU. Its size selection is related to the corresponding PU shape. If the current CU is partitioned into non-square PU, the non-square partition will be applied to the corresponding TU; otherwise, the square partition type will be applied. The size of TU could be greater than that of the PU, but no more than that of the CU it belongs to.
*Intra Prediction Coding
**Compared with the AVS1 and H.264/AVC, AVS2 designs 33 modes for the intra-frame prediction coding of luminance blocks, including DC prediction mode, plane prediction mode, bilinear prediction mode and 30 angel prediction modes. There are 5 modes for chrominance blocks: DC mode, horizontal prediction mode, vertical prediction mode, bilinear interpolation mode as well as the luminance derived mode (DM) newly added.
*Inter Prediction Coding
**Compared with AVS1, AVS2 increases the maximum quantity of candidate reference frames to 4, so as to adapt to the multi-level reference frame management, which also takes full advantage of the redundant space of the buffer.
**In order to satisfy the requirements of multiple reference frame management, AVS2 adopts a kind of multi-level reference frame management mode. In this mode, the frames in each GOP (Group of Pictures) are partitioned into multiple levels according to the reference relationship between frames.
*Inter Prediction Mode
**On the basis of AVS1&#x27;s three image types I, P, B, according to the requirements of application, AVS2 adds the forward multi-hypothesis prediction image F. Aiming at the video surveillance, scene play and other specific applications, AVS2 designs scene frames (Image G and Image GB) and reference scene frame S.
**For Frame B, in addition to traditional forward, backward, two-way mode and skip/direct mode, a new symmetric mode is added. In symmetric mode, only forward motion vectors are required to be encoded, and then backward motion vectors will be derived from the forward motion vectors.
**In order to fully exert the performance of the skip/direct mode of Frame B, AVS2 also adopts multi-direction skip/direct mode under the premise of retaining the original skip/direct mode of Frame B: two-way skip/direct mode, symmetrical skip/direct mode, backward skip/direct mode and forward skip/direct mode. For the four particular modes, the same prediction mode block between adjacent blocks is discovered according to the prediction mode of the current block, and the motion vectors of adjacent blocks with the same prediction mode, which are found out first, will be considered as that of the current block.
**For Frame F, coding blocks can refer to the two forward reference blocks, equivalent to the double hypothesis prediction of Frame P.
**AVS2 divides the multi-hypothesis prediction into two categories, namely temporal and spatial multi-hypothesis mode.
**The current encoding block of the time-domain double hypothesis applies the weighted average of prediction blocks as the current prediction value, but there is only one for both the MVD (Motion Vector Difference) and the reference image index, while another MVD and reference image index are derived from linear scaling based on the distance in the time domain.
**The spatial-domain double prediction is also called DMH (Directional Multi-Hypothesis), which is obtained by fusing two prediction points around the initial prediction point, and the initial point is located in the line between the two prediction points. In addition to the initial prediction point, there are 8 prediction points in total, to be fused only with the two prediction points located in the same straight line with the initial prediction point. Besides four different directions, the adjustment will also be conducted according to the distance, and the four modes with 1/2 pixel distance and 1/4 pixel distance will be respectively calculated, plus the initial prediction point, to work out 9 modes in total for comparison, thus to select out the optimal prediction mode.
**The scene frame is proposed by AVS2 based on the surveillance video coding method of background modeling. When the surveillance tool is not opened, Frame I is only for reference for images before the next random access point. When the surveillance tool is opened, AVS2 will apply a certain frame in the video as the scene image frame G, which can be considered as a long-term reference for the subsequent images.
**AVS2 can generate the scene image frame GB with some frames in the video, and frame GB can also be applied as a long-term reference.
**In order to simplify the motion compensation, AVS2 adopts an 8-tap interpolation filter based on DCT transformation, which requires only one filtering, and supports the generation of higher motion vector accuracy than 1/4 pixel.
*Transformation
**Transformation coding in AVS2 mainly applies integer DCT transformation, which is directly performed on the transformation blocks of Size 4×4, 8×8, 16×16, 32x32.
**For one transformation block with dimension greater than 64, a logical transformation LOT is adopted to conduct the wavelet transformation, followed by the integer DCT transformation.
**After the DCT transformation is achieved, AVS2 will conduct the second 4 x 4 transformation for the 4 x 4 blocks with low frequency coefficients, thus further to reduce the correlation between coefficients, and enable the energy to be more concentrated.
*Entropy Coding
**The AVS2 entropy coding divides transformation coefficients into CGs (Coefficient Group) of 4 x 4 size first, and then conducts encoding and zigzag scan according to the CGs.
**Coefficient coding encodes the CG position containing the last non-zero coefficient first, and then encodes each CG, until all CG coefficients are completed, so as to enable zero coefficients to be more concentrated during the encoding process.
**Binary arithmetic coding and two-dimensional variable-length coding based on the context are still applied in the AVS2.
*Loop Filter
**Loop filter modules of AVS2 contain three parts: deblocking filter, adaptive sample point offset and sample compensation filter.
**The filtering blocks of the deblocking filter are of an 8×8 size, which conduct filtering on the vertical edge first, followed by the horizontal edge. And diverse filtering methods are selected for each edge according to different filtering intensities.
**After the deblocking filter, the adaptive sample offset compensation is adopted to further reduce the distortion.
**The AVS2 adds an adaptive filter after the deblocking filter and sample offset compensation, a Wiener filter with 7×7 cross plus 3×3 square centrosymmetry, which applies the original undistorted image and encoding reconstructed image to figure out the least square filter coefficient, and conduct filtering on the decoding reconstructed image, thus to reduce the compression distortion in the decoding image, and enhance the quality of the reference image.

<text>Krabi-Krabong (, ) is a weapon-based martial art from Thailand. It is closely related to other Southeast Asian fighting styles such as Silat, Burmese banshay and Cambodian kbach kun boran. The royal bodyguard corps of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) were said to be highly trained in krabi-krabong.

== Weapons ==
The system&#x27;s name refers to its main weapons, namely the Krabi (&quot;Thai Cutlass&quot;) and Krabong (&quot;staff&quot;). Typically, practitioner will be practicing &quot;Daab Song Mue&quot; (&quot;duel wielding sword&quot;). Unarmed krabi-krabong (muay boran) makes use of kicks, pressure point strikes, joint locks, holds, and throws.

The weapons of krabi-krabong include the following:
* &quot;Krabi&quot; (): cutlass/curved sword
* &quot;Daab&quot; (): single-edge sword
* &quot;Krabong&quot; (): stick/ cudgel, usually either paired or used with a shield. Not very popular in present-day so often gets confused with long pole
* &quot;Daab song mue&quot; (): Thai double swords, one in each hand
* &quot;Kean/Lo&quot; (): buckler/shield made from wood or buffalo hide
* &quot;Phlong&quot; (): staff/pole, often mislabeled as Krabong
* &quot;Ngao&quot; (): bladed staff
* &quot;Mae sowk&quot; (): a pair of clubs worn on the forearms
Each weapon is taught from both leads through a series of drills which can be used interchangeably with the various weapons.

==Origins==

Krabi–krabong was developed by the ancient Thai warriors for fighting on the battlefield. It was likely used in conjunction with muay boran but whether the two arts were developed together or independently is uncertain. Early warfare in Indochina was mostly between rival kingdoms and were fought en masse. Individual fighters were armoured and carried rhino hide shields. The Burmese invasion of 1767 resulted in the loss of many historical records and cultural documents. However, the Thai fighting arts were traditionally passed down orally and did not rely on written documents for their preservation. Simon de la Loubère, the French diplomat from the court of Louis XIV, observed the existence of muay Thai and Krabi–krabong in his famous account &quot;Du Royaume de Siam&quot; (1689) while visiting the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1688.

Archaeological findings and classical dances bear testament to the myriad of weapons that were once used in Thailand. Some of them are no longer found in the country&#x27;s martial arts today, such as the &quot;kris&quot; (dagger), &quot;hawk&quot; (spear), &quot;trishula&quot; (either long or tekpi &quot;short-handled trident&quot;), &quot;daab&quot; (straight sword) and vajra. Entire dances were built on individual weapons, and calisthenics used by the modern Thai military are still based on these dances.

The weapons, their design and the pre-fight war dance in krabi-krabong show evidence of Indian derivation combined with Chinese characteristics. South Indian scholars, holy men, settlers and traders were especially influential in the evolution of Thai culture and martial arts. The Tamil stick-fighting style of silambam was of particular importance to the history of numerous Southeast Asian fighting systems. During the colonial period, silambam became more common in Southeast Asia than in India where it was banned by the British rulers.
Asian elephants were an integral part of warfare in Thailand. They would commonly be mounted by higher-ranking warriors like generals or royalty. To choose a successor to Intaraja I, his two sons fought on elephants. Krabi–krabong was often practiced by the palace mahouts or elephant trainers. From the back of an elephant, archers could shoot arrows at enemies below or, if he was wielding a polearm, engage in hand-to-hand combat with another mounted fighter. After the 15th-century introduction of gunpowder, elephants served as tanks with cannons mounted on their backs. The legs were the war-elephant&#x27;s weak spot, so they had to be guarded by up to four foot soldiers. Although mahouts no longer practice martial arts, reenactments of such battles are staged by performers who are often from families that have been training elephants since the Ayutthaya Kingdom.

As Indochinese trade extended to Japan, small communities of Japanese people were living and trading around the region. After the Battle Of Sekigahara in 1600, many of those from the losing side of the war came to Thailand. Others were pirates or official traders who arrived on the Red Seal Ships. The Japanese fled Ayutthaya after the Bamars invaded in 1767 but they left their influence on the local fighting arts. Many of the techniques, stances, weapons and throws of krabi-krabong are similar to those found in jujutsu and Okinawan kobudō.

In Thailand, as with other countries in Southern and Southeast Asia, monks acted as teachers to their local community. Young boys would be sent to the temples where, aside from learning about Theravada Buddhism, they would be taught subjects ranging from languages to astrology. One such establishment was the Buddhaisawan Temple in Ayutthaya where the monks taught sword-fighting to their students. The origin of these monks is unknown but they are believed to have come from the kingdom of Lan Na in Northern Thailand. The modern Buddhaisawan Sword Fighting Institute was led by Sumai Mesamana until his death in 1998. His son Pramote Mesamana began training in krabi-krabong at the age of 6. According to the younger Mesamana, the art was passed down in his family from father to son ever since the Ayutthaya Kingdom.

==Historical practitioners==
===Naresuan the Great===
During the 16th century, the First Toungoo Empire ruled over parts of Thailand. Naresuan was born to King Maha Thammaracha but until the age of 16 he was a hostage of the Bamars. Upon his return to the Ayutthaya Kingdom, he renounced allegiance to Bamars on behalf of his father the king. Having studied at Wat Buddhaisawan, Naresuan was well-versed in fighting with the single-edge sword (&quot;daab&quot;). The Bamars attacked the capital numerous times in succession but were always repelled by Naresuan&#x27;s forces. In a final attempt to retake their Thai states, the Bamars sent an army of 25,000 warriors led by Mingyi Swa, the crown prince of Burma atop a war-elephant.

Knowing he was outnumbered, Naresuan charged his own elephant through the Burmese soldiers and fought directly with the prince. Using a halberd (&quot;ngao&quot;), Naresuan cleaved the crown prince in two from the shoulder to the hip. With their monarch now dead, the Burmese fled the battlefield and wouldn&#x27;t become a serious threat to Thai sovereignty for more than a century. Naresuan ascended the throne in 1590 and under his rule the Thai encompassed the Shan States and part of Cambodia.

===King Taksin===
The Ayutthaya Kingdom became progressively weaker during the eighteenth century. The Thais and Burmese had been almost constantly fighting each other along the border territories since the time of King Naresuan the Great. In 1758 the Bamars began a siege which lasted nine years. Buildings, palaces and temples were laid to ruins while documents, archives and records were all destroyed. Royal treasures were stolen and all but 10,000 of the city&#x27;s one million inhabitants were sold into slavery.

Taksin learned krabi-krabong while studying in Wat Buddhaisawan as a boy. But more than his martial expertise, it was Taksin&#x27;s skill as a military strategist that allowed him to quickly attain the rank of general. Before the capture of Ayutthaya, the young general Taksin fled with 500 followers to Rayong. He reorganised his forces and began attacking the Burmese invaders in small bands, destroying their supply routes. Word spread and within a few months Taksin rallied the Thai people to battle once again. Despite being only half the size of the Burmese army, Taksin&#x27;s troops managed to drive out the conquerors and restored Thailand to nearly its former size. With the previous king, Ekkathat, now dead, Taksin was convinced that he was Gautama Buddha&#x27;s reincarnation and proclaimed himself king in 1767. Seven years later, he decided to give up his role as military commander and instead sent out generals to campaign in his stead.
Among all the warriors under Taksin&#x27;s command, the greatest fighter was Phraya Pichai Daab Hak, a nickname meaning &quot;broken sword&quot;. Phraya Pichai was an expert with the dual swords (&quot;daab song mue&quot;) and acquired his moniker during a battle in which he continued fighting after one of his swords was broken. Another notable general was Rama I. Though not as skilled a martial artist as Phraya Pichai, Chakri was as brilliant a commander as Taksin. Under his leadership, Siam captured the Lao Kingdom of Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and Chiang Mai.

Taksin ruled from 1767–1782, but near the end of his reign he became increasingly dictatorial. He was said to have frequently flogged Buddhists monks and executed some of his concubines on false charges. A revolt broke out in the capital of the Thonburi Kingdom and it was agreed by both the army and the nobility that Chakri should take Taksin&#x27;s place as king. The current royal family of Thailand is descended from King Chakri, also called Rama I. Taksin himself was put to death but not in a conventional beheading. Instead, Taksin was wrapped in a velvet bag and beaten to death by his ministers with clubs. This method of execution was instituted to avoid spilling royal blood, and Taksin is the only known Thai king to have been killed in such a way.

==Modern day Krabi Krabong system==
===Daab Chao Ram===
&quot;Daab Chao Ram&quot;, a system of Krabi Krabong wielding mainly Thai single and/or duel swords (“Daab”, Thai single edge sword). This system was created at Ramkhamhaeng University Thai Weaponry Club by the various students of the numerous sword schools  from all over Thailand who compiled their knowledge, skills, and experience which lead to the creation of “Daab Chao Ram”. Daab Chao Ram “” meaning Thai single edge sword, “” meaning lord, and “Ram” is short for King Ramkhamhaeng or Por Khun Ramkhamhaeng Maharaj. All of them together can mean either: 1) Sword of Lord Ram, 2) Legion of Lord Ram, or 3) Might of Lord Ram (meaning might differ from person to person). The name was chosen to commemorate Por Khun Ramkhamhaeng Maharaj for his good deed to the country and for his bravery in battle that earned him the nickname “Khamhaeng” meaning, bold. One prominent school that teaches Daab Chao Ram is Thai Achira. Lamp Sakkapoom is one of the highly regarded practitioner and instructor of Daab Chao Ram. He is also a skilled Muay Chaiya fighter.

<text>Muay Boran (, , , lit. &quot;ancient boxing&quot;) or originally Toi Muay () is an umbrella term for the ancient unarmed martial arts of Thailand prior to the introduction of modern equipment and rules in the 1930s.

== Contemporary history ==
In the early 20th century, one of King Chulalongkorn&#x27;s sons died. He commanded his officers to gather fighters of exceptional skill to perform as part of the funeral ceremonies. Three fighters in particular stood out and were granted titles of muen as a means to promote the quality of muay, which had been diminishing at the time. The chosen fighters were from different parts of the country: Daeng Thaiprasoet from the Northeast region became Muen Changat Choengchok; Klueng Tosa-at from the Central region became Muen Muemaenmat; Prong Chamnongthong from the Southern region became Muen Muaymichue. Each name means and corresponds to a specific style of muay fighting: Changatchoengchok means &quot;effective style of punching&quot;, Muemaenmat means &quot;skillful punches&quot;, and Muaymichue translates to &quot;muay with a reputation&quot;.
From these grew a few different styles of muay: Lopburi, Khorat, Chaiya, and Thasao respectively. Additional varieties came to be later on, but these three styles were originally actualized under the Muay Boran umbrella. The strength of this style are the use of hands, shins and knees are developed. The weakness includes having to be in good shape to be efficient. 

Muay Thai Boran was originally developed in the 13th century for self-defense and also taught to the Thai military for use in warfare. Muay Boran originally is a martial art system which has deadly techniques, grappling techniques and ground fighting techniques apart from its stand up techniques. This differs from modern-day Muay Thai, which consists only of stand up and is only a ring sport. Matches between practitioners of the art then began to be held. These soon became an integral part of Thai culture with fights being held at festivals and fighters from the different areas of Thailand testing their styles against each other. Fighters began to wrap their hands and forearms in hemp rope which not only protected their fists from injury but also made their strikes more likely to cut an opponent. Muay boran fighters were highly respected and the best were enlisted into the King&#x27;s royal guard.
During the 1920s-30s King Rama VII modernized the Thai martial arts competitions, introducing referees, boxing gloves, rounds and western boxing rings. Many of the traditional Muay Boran techniques were banned or were not practical with the addition of the new rules, and so muay boran went into decline.

Tony Jaa&#x27;s martial arts films are credited with helping to showcase the combat systems of Muay Thai, Muay Boran, and &quot;Muay Kotchasaan&quot; (a fighting style Jaa and his mentor Panna Rittikrai developed in 2005).

===Muay Chaiya===
Muay Chaiya is a local Muay art in Chaiya District. Surat Thani Province It was so famous during the reigns of King Rama 5 - 6 that is Plong Chamnongthong was a student of the Chaiya ruler who were bestowed with the title Muenmuaymeechue and were famous. The strength of this style are the techniques can be use against heavier people and can be used if the user is not in great shape. The weakness of this style are the attacks are not decisive and require counterattacks.

===Muay Korat===
Muay Korat was developed in Nakhon Ratchasima (Korat) in Thailand and was popularized in the city of Korat since the reign of King Rama V during the Rattanakosin Era. The style&#x27;s main strength is the power of its attacks, with the use of wide angle strikes from long distances and straight strikes form short distances. Korat boxers also focus on blocking the opponent&#x27;s offense, usually with a neck hold that allows the boxer to land multiple strikes on the opponent. Its main weakness is the loss of stamina after the multiple strike attacks.
===Muay Lopburi===
Muay Lopburi is one of the oldest styles of Muay Boran, developed by the Mons of Dvaravati, it originated in central Thailand around 7th century AD.
Differently from Muay Korat, Lopburi focuses on speed and agility, with boxers trying to distract their opponent to find an opening for an attack.
Afterwards, the boxer constantly pressures the opponent with his strikes while also controlling the pace with his footwork. 
===Muay Thasao===
Muay Thasao is more recent compared to the other styles, and its main strength is its defense.
Thasao boxers rely on speed and versatility, that allows them to change stance and posture as a way to adapt to their opponent&#x27;s style while also protecting themselves from the opponent&#x27;s leg kicks. 
== Muay thai ==
Muay Thai was originally known simply as &quot;muay&quot;. The addition of &quot;Thai&quot; was to differentiate the style from western boxing in the early 1900s. Muay &quot;Boran&quot; only recently became a term used to encompass the origins of Thai martial arts due to the historical writings of Grandmaster Khetr Sriyaphai (a Muay Chaiya practitioner) in the &quot;Parithat Muay Thai&quot; column. With the increasing popularity of Muay Thai in the last few decades, nationalistic supporters of Muay felt a need to establish a history of the martial art, resulting in a sometimes unfounded account of the background of Muay Thai and Muay Boran, extrapolated from brief mentions in written records.

<text>Tantōjutsu (短刀術) is a Japanese term for a variety of traditional Japanese knife fighting systems that used the tantō (短刀), as a knife or dagger. Historically, many women used a version of the tantō, called the kaiken, for self-defense, but warrior women in pre-modern Japan learned one of the tantōjutsu arts to fight in battle.

==Martial arts that practise tantōjutsu==
Tantō with blunt wooden or plastic blades are used to practice martial arts. Metal blades can be used in more advanced training and in demonstrations. Styles that use tantō:

Budō (Gendai):
* Aikido

<doc id="324974" wikidata="Q3754231" url="?curid=324974" title="Full contact karate">
<text>Full contact karate is any format of karate where competitors spar (also called Kumite) full-contact and allow a knockout as winning criterion.

==History==
Full contact karate competition comes in several different formats developed for the art of karate at different times in different places. Some developed independently, others developed out of other full contact rule systems or from light contact rule systems.

There are no major unifying organizations in any of the different formats, and the rule details may change drastically between the many rival sport/style organizations and different promoters. Some organizations stick rigidly to one set of rules. Other use several rule formats harmoniously side by side. Some even have tournaments that switch rule formats between rounds of the same bout. Sometimes the differences between the different rules are large, and sometimes the only significant differences between different sport rules are the organizational structures that use them.

==Different formats==

===Knockdown===
One major format of full-contact sport karate is known as &quot;knockdown karate&quot; or sometimes &quot;Japanese full contact karate&quot;. This style of sport fighting was developed and pioneered in the late 1960s by the Kyokushin karate organization in Japan, founded by Korean-Japanese . In fighting the competitors traditionally wear no gloves, padding or body protection other than groin guards (although local regulations sometimes enforce exceptions to this tradition), but it is bare knuckle fighting. Grabbing and holding the opponent, including clinching, is not allowed under the basic- knockdown karate rules as used in Kyokushin, but are occasionally allowed in some variations used in other styles.

Points are scored by knocking the opponent out, down to the floor, by sweep and controlled follow up for half a point, or by otherwise visibly incapacitating them. Unless there is a knockdown or sweep, the bout is continuous, with stoppages only to break up locked clinches or if the fighters leave the fight area. Unlike American full-contact karate, or point karate, clean hits are not counted in and by themselves, as the scoring depends entirely on the effect of the hits, not on the formal or stylistic appearance of the techniques. No matter the perfection in execution of a technique, it will not score unless it visibly affects the opponent. In the same manner, if a technique does show a visible effect, it does not matter if it is executed in a manner regarded as inferior.

Common, minor variations to the basic-knockdown rules include Ashihara Karate and Enshin Karate knockdown rules that allow one-handed grabbing in order to execute throws to score points.
Many other variations exist, some so extensive that they can no longer be classified as knockdown rules, and several other branches of full-contact karate (typically included in the &quot;gloved&quot;, &quot;MMA inspired&quot; and &quot;others&quot; groups) originate as such a variation of the Knockdown karate rules.

Although this sport format originated with the Kyokushin karate organization, it has spread until now and it&#x27;s used by many karate styles and organizations. Karate styles embracing these rules are often called &quot;knockdown karate&quot; styles, and these include both organizations that originated from Kyokushin, such as Shidōkan Karate, Ashihara Karate, Enshin Karate, Shindenkai and Seidokaikan (the style that originated the K-1), as well as styles that originated independently from Kyokushin such as Ryukyukan from Okinawa and Muso-Kai karate. (Muso-Kai started with Shorin Ryu, Knockdown styles were a huge influence later)

Though severely divided by rivaling styles and organizations (several of which use their own minor variations of the basic rules), and lacking a unifying sport organization, the sport of knockdown karate today is common all over the world.
Despite the lack of a unifying sport organization to hold unifying championships (and the friction between the different styles and organizations), there is a long tradition in most knockdown karate organizations to hold special open-tournament knockdown karate events, where fighters from any knockdown karate (or any other) style and organization are welcome to participate.

===American===
A second full contact karate competition format is &quot;American full contact karate&quot; which was developed in the US by the Professional Karate Association during early 70s by borrowing rules, settings and gloves from western boxing, and adapting it. It is continuous fighting, where the bout is not broken for scoring, but point scores are summed up at the end of the bout. Protective equipment used is boxing gloves and often foot-pads, shin pads, and amateur boxing helmets.

It had its origin when Joe Lewis, a traditional Shorin Ryu black belt, was disappointed with scoring in point karate and wanted to prove martial artists could fight to a knockout. For his role in promoting and organizing the first full contact bout, Joe Lewis is considered the father of American full contact karate and full contact kickboxing, both important predecessor to modern-day mixed martial arts fighting.

American full contact karate is closely related to American kickboxing, and it is often difficult to separate the two sports. As a guideline, both do not allow kicks below the waistline, or the use of knees or elbows.
===Gloved===
One more recent system of full contact karate that has gained in popularity is &quot;Gloved karate&quot; or &quot;Glove karate&quot;. Sometimes called &quot;Shin-karate&quot;/&quot;Shinkarate&quot; (or &quot;new&quot; karate, in a partial translation) depending on sport organization and promoter -with the largest sport organizations being &quot;Shinkaratedo renmei&quot; and &quot;All Japan Glove Karate Federation&quot; This system originates in Japan where it has become a popular amateur sport for karate fighters wishing to enter professional kickboxing. Outside Japan it has gained some momentum in Europe, but is still very small compared to other forms of karate.

The rules are based on the &quot;knockdown karate&quot; rules explained above, but modified to use boxing gloves and allow punches to the face, although it may be argued that it is unclear where this karate competition format ends and kickboxing begins. This is especially true since many gloved karate fighters seamlessly go on from their amateur gloved karate career to professional kickboxing careers. Many Japanese gloved karate fighters have in recent years become well known as pro-kickboxers, and many of the most successful Japanese kickboxers in K-1, such as Kozo Takeda, Yoshihiro Sato, Yasuhiro Kido, Hinata, Yuya Yamamoto, originated in gloved karate.

===Bogu Kumite===

Still another form of full contact karate is Bogu kumite, which is most often associated with a few traditional Okinawan styles of karate like Chito-ryu, Isshin-ryu, Shorinji-ryu and Nippon Kempo. This format of continuous competition uses heavy protective padding to avoid injuries. In the beginning, this protective padding was based on the helmet and armor of Japanese kendo with gloves to protect the knuckles from the helmet&#x27;s steel bars, although in modern days more specific padding has been developed. While allowing knockout as winning criterion, the protective equipment reduces the chances for it, and points are usually scored for clean techniques and techniques knocking the opponent off his feet. Nippon Kempo also allows grappling.

Nevertheless, compared to most other major full contact karate sports, Bogu Kumite is still very small.

===Full contact point karate===
One format of full contact karate competition is full contact point karate. It is similar to non full contact competition karate; the only difference from light contact and semi contact karate bouts is that if the opponent is knocked out, it is a win instead of a disqualification for excessive contact. Points are scored for clean hits to the specified target zones, and unless there is an evident knockout or knockdown, the referee breaks the bout after each exchange to score the hits. The blows are delivered with full contact, although gloves, foot-pads, and in some cases body padding, are worn. This form of full contact karate competition is mainly found in North America, where it originated, although it has a minor following in Europe. It is also similar to the competition format used in full contact Shotokan, Taekwondo, and the sport karate competitions using this format often blur the line between these two related arts.

===Karate Combat===
In 2018, a new professional league was launched with a new full contact rule set, called Karate Combat. The rules were developed by Hungarian karateka Adam Kovacs and allow full contact, with gloves, knockouts, and no grappling. Fighters who have joined the league include Rafael Aghayev of Azerbaijan, Davy Dona of France, Josh Quayhagen of Lake Charles, LA, and Achraf Ouchen of Morocco.
Bas Rutten, the UFC Hall of Famer and actor on CBS&#x27;s Kevin Can Wait, is part of the organization and has served as commentator for events in Budapest, Miami, Athens, Hollywood and New York City. The New York City event was held at the top of One World Trade, the first sporting event ever held there. UFC star Chuck Liddell has acted as an ambassador for the league.

The rules of this contest is punches, kicks to the calf (not thigh) and to the head and body, as well as knee strikes. If a fighter gets knocked down the opponent can punch them on the ground for 5 seconds before the referee stops the fight or stand them back up.

In December 2019, the league announced an extended schedule of fight events for the year around the world with an event in Kyoto, Japan, planned for the Spring. The Kyoto fight was cancelled and the promotion held two events that year, one in Orlando, Florida and one in Hollywood with guest announcer Danny Trejo. In April 2020, the league announced a new plan that would hold all of a season&#x27;s fights in one location and use CGI to add the exotic atmosphere; the plan was partially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Hybrid fighting karate===
Hybrid fighting karate is a form of full contact karate allows the use of both striking (Karate) and grappling (Judo / Jujutsu) techniques, both standing and on the ground.

In 1981, Grandmaster Takashi Azuma created &quot;Karatedo Daido Juku&quot; in Sendai city, Miyagi prefecture. Daido Juku introduced &quot;Kakuto Karate (Combat Karate)&quot; a safe, practical and popular form of tournament karate using the face protector and allowing attacks to the head level attack, throws and grabs. Since then joint locks and chokes were included. Ever since, Daido Juku became a leading organization in the mixed martial arts boom in Japan. Daido Juku competition format, Kudo, allows any strike (including headbutts and groin kicks), throws and limited time grappling on the ground.

Other groups combining traditional karate striking with grappling are Nihon zendokai with their &quot;Vale Tudo Karate&quot; and Kyokushin Budokai with their &quot;allround fighting&quot; rules, as well as a multitude of lesser known minor rule systems. Another hybrid karate style is Seireikai Karate, founded by a Kyokushin and Oyama Karate practitioner. The style is primarily Kyokushin and Oyama Karate striking techniques, combined with the throws and grappling of Judo. The characteristics of this modified kyokushin fighting style relies on punch counters, multi-range kicking, throws and take-downs, and joint locks. Another hybrid Full Contact Karate form is Ashigaru-Ryu founded by Sensei Bob Peppels in the Netherlands.

Another type of Karate Hybrid fighting style is karate Zendokai. This type of karate is based on striking and grappling techniques. 

===Others===
Other sport rules, including versions allowing full contact bare knuckle strikes to the unprotected head, exists, but tend to be small and obscure compared to the above listed major formats. These rules tend to be restricted to a single small style organization or even individual sport event promotions.

Examples of minor full contact rules system are the Irikumi Go as used by some Gōjū-ryū organizations (most notably the International Okinawan Gōjū-ryū Karate-dō Federation and the Jundokan Goju-Ryu organization), and the rules of Mumonkai Karate. Kyokushinkan shinken shobu uses a variation of knockdown karate using thin gloves, and allows headpunches, clinching and throws. Irikumi Go is a traditional continuous fighting using full contact, gloves and face-punches, used in Gojuryu karate. Mumonkai use rules similar to knockdown karate, but modified to allow head-punches with protective headgear and thin gloves.

In France, a full contact karate promotion called pro fight karate, has been formed for professional karate with MMA style gloves, clinching and limited grappling.

An example of full contact karate rules unique to a single promotion is the now defunct Chaos Madmax special event in Japan, arranged by the FSA Kenshinkan style organization. Here fighters fight without gloves or protective equipment, and head-punches allowed.
Chaos Madmax has been replaced by Pro KarateDo, an organization using similar bareknuckle rules.

The Shotokan Karate-Do International Association (SKDIA) run events called FullContact Shotokan. The competitors wear protective equipment and fight under the full contact ruleset. Punches, kicks, knees, throws and sweeps are all allowed, with a 5 second rule for attacks on a grounded opponent. Rumours say these rules influenced the idea of the first Karate Combat ruleset.

<text>Mr. Bungle is an American experimental rock band formed in Eureka, California, in 1985. Having gone through many incarnations throughout its career, the band is best known for its experimental rock period. During this time, it developed a highly eclectic style, cycling through several musical genres, often within the course of a single song, including heavy metal, avant-garde jazz, ska, disco, and funk, further enhanced by frontman Mike Patton&#x27;s versatile singing style. This period also saw the band utilizing unconventional song structures and samples; playing a wide array of instruments; dressing up in masks, jumpsuits, and other costumes; and performing a diverse selection of cover songs during live performances.

The band was founded as a death metal project while the members were in high school. It is named after a character in the 1960 children&#x27;s educational film &quot;Beginning Responsibility: Lunchroom Manners&quot;, as featured in the 1981 HBO special &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;. Mr. Bungle released four demo tapes in the mid-to-late 1980s. On the back of Patton&#x27;s success as frontman of Faith No More, the band was signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1990 and released three studio albums between 1991 and 1999 in the eclectic, experimental style it became known for. The band toured in 1999 and 2000 to support its third album before going on an indefinite hiatus that was confirmed as a dissolution in 2004. It reunited as a thrash metal band for a series of shows in February 2020 to perform its 1986 demo album &quot;The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny&quot; with Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. The band then returned to the studio to re-record the demo as a professional album, released in October of that year.

Mr. Bungle has gone through numerous lineup changes, with Patton, guitarist Trey Spruance, and bassist Trevor Dunn the sole consistent members. The band was based in San Francisco during its tenure with Warner Bros. During much of the band&#x27;s existence, it was in a public dispute with Red Hot Chili Peppers, particularly between Patton and Chili Peppers vocalist Anthony Kiedis.

==History==
=== Formation (1985–1989)===

Mr. Bungle emerged after its members were kicked out of their respective previous bands. &quot;It was kinda like a merger between two bands,&quot; Mike Patton recalled. &quot;One really horrible gothic metal band, which our guitarist and original drummer were in, and one really horrible metal band which did Metallica covers, which is the one Trevor and me came from.&quot; Mr. Bungle initially described themselves as a death metal band, but also dabbled in speed metal, thrash metal, and hardcore punk. The members came very close to naming the band Summer Breeze before settling on the name Mr. Bungle. The Mr. Bungle name was inspired by a 1950s propaganda film that they had seen as a segment of &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;. The members previously used the name to refer to a classmate that they thought to be &quot;a total goober&quot; before adopting it as their band&#x27;s name.

Within a year of formation, the band expanded their sound to include ska. Trevor Dunn noted in 1991: &quot;After about a year we got tired of playing speed metal and wanted to do something a little more creative. So we just stopped and started writing our own style of music, which was influenced by bands like Camper Van Beethoven, Oingo Boingo, Bad Manners and kind of funky, ska-oriented stuff. Then we added a two-piece horn section and a new drummer, so now we don&#x27;t really have any kind of limit on the music we play.&quot; Trey Spruance corroborated this: &quot;When I was 15, I was in a death metal group,&quot; Spruance reminisced. &quot;We had this idea that we were going to play a bunch of ska tunes for a bunch of metalheads. We just had this idea, you know: &#x27;Okay, we&#x27;re going to play this ska music, and that&#x27;ll be amazing.&#x27; Half of the audience hated us, but there was definitely a joy in confronting that wall between styles.&quot;

Given that the band&#x27;s background was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton had to teach him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, &quot;Oh, what I remember was... this was our first... like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this was our first time trying to ever play ska. And I&#x27;d never played... on guitar, like, I&#x27;d never played... I didn&#x27;t know how to do that skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... he taught me how to do it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don&#x27;t... I dunno if we played The Specials, but that&#x27;s what we were listening to.&quot;

Mr. Bungle played their first show in November 1985 at the Bayside Grange Hall in Bayside, California. The band&#x27;s first demo, &quot;The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny&quot;, was recorded during Easter of 1986. It featured a fast, lo-fi death/thrash metal sound, with touches of ska. Instruments utilized on the album included a train whistle, saxophone, bongos and a kazoo. &quot;The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny&quot; was followed in 1987 by the &quot;Bowel of Chiley&quot; demo; it featured a much greater ska presence, as well as the sounds of jazz, swing and funk. Bradley Torreano noted at AllMusic that the recording was &quot;essentially the sound of some very talented teenagers trying to make their love of jazz and ska come together in whatever way they can.&quot; In 1988, Mike Patton became the lead vocalist for Faith No More, getting the job after the band heard him on the first Mr. Bungle demo. Patton continued to be a member of both bands simultaneously and Mr. Bungle released its third demo, &quot;Goddammit I Love America!&quot;, later in 1988, which was musically similar to &quot;Bowel of Chiley&quot;. Mike Patton described its style as &quot;funkadelic, thrashing, circus, ska.&quot; &quot;OU818&quot;, their final demo tape, was recorded in June 1989. &quot;OU818&quot;, was the first release to feature both tenor sax player Clinton &quot;Bär&quot; McKinnon and drummer Danny Heifetz. At the time of this release, Mike Patton described Mr. Bungle as a &quot;weirdo funk band&quot;.

===&quot;Mr. Bungle&quot; (1990–1993)===
During 1990, the band members left Eureka for San Francisco in search of greater musical opportunities. Trey Spruance said the change in location influenced the band&#x27;s style, remarking &quot;[we were interested in] Slayer and Mercyful Fate. Later it was The Specials and Fishbone. Then we moved to San Francisco and got all sophisticated. Now we are improv snobs who rule the avant-garde universe by night, and poor, fucked-up hipsters by day.&quot; Having established a following in Northern California, Mr. Bungle was signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1990, with the label releasing all three of their studio albums during the 1990s. It has been speculated that Patton&#x27;s success as frontman of Faith No More was the primary reason Warner Bros. signed the band. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated in a 1991 article that &quot;Under normal circumstances, you&#x27;d have to describe Mr. Bungle&#x27;s chances of landing a major label deal as... a long shot.&quot;

Their debut album, &quot;Mr. Bungle&quot;, was produced by jazz experimentalist John Zorn and was released on August 13, 1991. The cover featured artwork by Dan Sweetman, originally published in the story &quot;A Cotton Candy Autopsy&quot; in the DC Comics/Piranha Press imprint title &quot;Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children&quot;. The record mixed metal, funk, ska, carnival music and free jazz, but was normally described as funk metal by music critics. It received mostly positive reviews, with journalist Bill Pahnelas calling it &quot;an incredible musical tour de force&quot;. On the style of the album, critic Steve Huey wrote in AllMusic: &quot;&quot;Mr. Bungle&quot; is a dizzying, disconcerting, schizophrenic tour through just about any rock style the group can think of, hopping from genre to genre without any apparent rhyme or reason, and sometimes doing so several times in the same song.&quot;

The album&#x27;s first track and sole single was originally titled &quot;Travolta&quot;. At Warner Brothers&#x27; encouragement, it was renamed &quot;Quote Unquote&quot; in later pressings, due to fears regarding a potential lawsuit by John Travolta. The band created a music video for the song, directed by Kevin Kerslake. However, MTV refused to air the video because of images of bodies dangling on meat hooks. The album sold well despite MTV refusing to air their video and a lack of radio airplay. Almost all the members went by obscure aliases in the album credits. To promote the album in some stores, a Mr. Bungle bubble bath was given away with copies of the record sold. Following the release of the album, the band toured North America.

===&quot;Disco Volante&quot; (1994–1997)===
Due to artwork delays and the band members&#x27; many side-projects, it was four years before &quot;Disco Volante&quot; was released, in October 1995. The new album displayed musical development and a shift in tone from their earlier recordings. While the self-titled album was described as &quot;funk metal&quot;, with &quot;Disco Volante&quot; this label was replaced with &quot;avant-garde&quot; or &quot;experimental&quot;.

The music was complex and unpredictable, with the band continuing with their shifts of musical style. Some of the tracks were in foreign languages and would radically change genres mid-song. Featuring lyrics about death, suicide and child abuse, along with children&#x27;s songs and a Middle Eastern techno number, music critic Greg Prato described the album as having &quot;a totally original and new musical style that sounds like nothing that currently exists&quot;. Not all critics were impressed with the album, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; describing it as &quot;an album of cheesy synthesizers, mangled disco beats, virtuosic playing and juvenile noises&quot;, calling it &quot;self-indulgent&quot; and adding that &quot;Mr. Bungle&#x27;s musicians like to show off their classical, jazz and world-beat influences in fast, difficult passages which are technically impressive but never seem to go anywhere&quot;. Additionally, writer Scott McGaughey described it as &quot;difficult&quot;, and was critical of its &quot;lack of actual songs&quot;. &quot;Disco Volante&quot; included influences from contemporary classical music, avant-garde jazz, electronic music pioneer Pierre Henry, Edgar Allan Poe, John Zorn, Krzysztof Penderecki, and European film music of the 1960s and 1970s, such as those composed by Ennio Morricone and Peter Thomas. The album notes also contained an invitation to participate in an &quot;unusual scam&quot; – if $2 was sent to the band&#x27;s address, participants would receive additional artwork, lyrics to the songs &quot;Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz&quot; and &quot;Chemical Marriage&quot; and some stickers. The vinyl release of this album shipped with a 7&quot; by the then-unknown Secret Chiefs 3.

Mr. Bungle supported &quot;Disco Volante&quot; with their first world tour, performing across North America, Europe and Australia during 1995 and 1996. After this tour, founding member and original saxophone player and keyboardist Theo Lengyel left the band due to creative differences.

In early 1997, the band began work on a covers album, but it was put on indefinite hold due to Patton&#x27;s touring commitments with Faith No More. Later in 1997, the Seattle-based Rastacore Records started distributing CDs of &quot;Bowel of Chiley&quot; (incorrectly labelled &quot;Bowl of Chiley&quot; on the Rastacore release). This was done without official authorization from Mr. Bungle or Warner Bros., and as such production was halted, with only a limited number of CDs surviving.

===&quot;California&quot; (1998–2000)===
After a two-year break, which saw Faith No More split, Mr. Bungle reconvened in 1998 to record new material. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;California&quot;, was released on July 13, 1999. Ground and Sky reviews have described &quot;California&quot; as Mr. Bungle&#x27;s most accessible and, while the band&#x27;s signature genre shifts are still present, they are less frequent, with succinct song formats resulting in an album that the Associated Press called &quot;surprisingly linear&quot;. AllMusic called the record &quot;their most concise album to date; and while the song structures are far from traditional, they&#x27;re edging more in that direction, and that greatly helps the listener in making sense of the often random-sounding juxtapositions of musical genres&quot;. Of the different style of this album, Patton said that to the band &quot;the record is pop-y&quot;, before adding &quot;...but to some fucking No Doubt fan in Ohio, they&#x27;re not going to swallow that.&quot; The album was generally well-received, with music critic Robert Everett-Green writing, &quot;The band&#x27;s newest and greatest album does not reveal itself quickly, but once the bug bites, there is no cure. The best disc of the year, by a length.&quot;

The recording process for &quot;California&quot; was more complex than for the band&#x27;s previous records. It chose to record the album to analog tape rather than digitally and some songs required several 24-track machines, utilizing over 50 tracks. As a result, each song contains layers of original samples, keyboards, percussion and melodies. The album displays influences from Burt Bacharach and The Beach Boys, while blending lounge, pop, doo-wop, jazz, funk, exotica, thrash metal, Hawaiian, Middle Eastern, alternative metal, surf music, kecak, and avant-garde music.

The band toured North America, Australia and Europe to support the record. They also appeared on the 2000 edition of the SnoCore Tour, performing alongside alternative metal acts it had influenced, such as Incubus and System of a Down. According to Dunn, Mr. Bungle was &quot;completely out of place&quot; on the SnoCore Tour. He said: &quot;We were sort of the grandpas of the tour, so we started really messing with the audiences. We dressed up like the Village People and acted super gay which really pissed off the metal kids.&quot;

Mr. Bungle played its last concert in nearly 20 years on September 9, 2000, in Nottingham, England. Following the &quot;California&quot; tour, the members again went their separate ways to pursue their various side projects. During the early 2000s, Patton was primarily touring and recording with his metal project Fantômas (which also featured Dunn) and the newly formed supergroup Tomahawk. Mr. Bungle was assumed to be in another period of &quot;hibernation&quot;, with Patton telling &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in October 2001 that &quot;it&#x27;s gotta take a rest. There&#x27;s a few of us that aren&#x27;t even ready to face it again for a while. We&#x27;ll put it on the shelf for now and see what happens to it and hopefully revisit it again.&quot; However, Patton announced in a 2004 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the group had disbanded.

===Post-breakup events (2000–2019)===
After the dissolution of Mr. Bungle, the members went on to numerous different projects. Patton co-founded the record label Ipecac Recordings and is involved with several other ventures, including various works with composer John Zorn and the bands Fantômas, Tomahawk, and Peeping Tom. In 2004, Björk called upon him to provide vocal work on her album &quot;Medúlla&quot;. He acted in the motion picture &quot;Firecracker&quot;, narrated the film &quot;Bunraku&quot;, and did voice work in the movie &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, performing the screams and howls of the infected humans. He also did zombie and other character voices in the game &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; (as well as the growls for the anger core in the game &quot;Portal&quot;). In 2009 and 2010, Patton embarked on a world tour with Faith No More after it reunited. Spruance is involved with various bands, including Secret Chiefs 3 and Faxed Head. Dunn joined Patton in Fantômas and Tomahawk, and formed a jazz band, Trevor Dunn&#x27;s Trio Convulsant; he also occasionally played bass with Secret Chiefs 3. Heifetz&#x27;s projects included playing with Secret Chiefs 3 and in the country/punk band Dieselhed; he now resides in Sydney, and plays in outfits such as The Exiles, The Tango Saloon and The Fantastic Terrific Munkle. McKinnon also played with Secret Chiefs 3. In 2002, he moved to Melbourne, Australia, after getting into a relationship with an Australian woman he met at a 2000 Mr. Bungle concert in Sydney. Following his move to Melbourne, he went on to play with The Ribbon Device and Umläut.

Spruance joined Patton and Faith No More onstage for the first time to perform &quot;King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime&quot; in its entirety in Santiago in November 2011. Patton sang on the Secret Chiefs 3 song &quot;La Chanson de Jacky&quot; in 2012, provoking further speculation by fans about a reunion. But in a February 2013 interview with &quot;SF Weekly&quot;, Dunn said there would be no Mr. Bungle reunion: &quot;I&#x27;ve heard the faintest murmurings about it, but honestly I don&#x27;t think anyone is interested. It&#x27;s nothing personal, either. We all feel like that band said what it needed to say. It would feel weird and awkward to play that music again. It would take a pant-load of money to make it happen, and honestly, I don&#x27;t want to do it for that reason. I would prefer to let go of it, respectfully.&quot; When asked about Mr. Bungle reuniting in an interview published in February 2014, Patton responded! &quot;Who knows? It certainly doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s on the tip of anyone&#x27;s lips, but I could have said the same thing—and in fact, I did say the same thing—about Faith No More, and that happened. And I think it happened for the better.&quot; Around this time, the book &quot;The Faith No More &amp; Mr. Bungle Companion&quot; was released, which covered both bands&#x27; histories.

===Reunion and &quot;The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny Demo&quot; (2019–present)===
On August 13, 2019, it was announced that Mr. Bungle would reunite in February 2020 for three shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Brooklyn. The reunion was promoted as featuring Patton, Spruance and Dunn, as well as guitarist Scott Ian and drummer Dave Lombardo, performing &quot;The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny&quot; in its entirety. On August 15, after a strong demand for tickets for all three shows, the band added an additional show to each city. A third L.A. show was added on August 21, bringing the total number of reunion shows to seven. The band wrote on its Facebook page that it would not perform any songs from its Warner Bros. albums.

During the reunion shows, Mr. Bungle covered songs of various metal and hardcore punk bands such as Slayer, Corrosion of Conformity, Circle Jerks, Crumbsuckers and Cro-Mags in addition to performing three previously unreleased songs written during the era of &quot;The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny&quot;: &quot;Glutton For Punishment&quot;, &quot;Methamatics&quot;, and &quot;Eracist&quot;. Although the entire recording was promoted as being performed, non-metal songs from the demo (such as &quot;Grizzly Adams&quot; and &quot;Evil Satan&quot;) were absent from the performances. The only exception was &quot;Hypocrites&quot;, albeit with the ska sections eliminated.

The choice of songs received a mixed reaction from certain portions of the band&#x27;s fanbase. In their review of the Los Angeles gig, &quot;Revolver&quot; wrote &quot;One of the most quietly influential bands in metal reunited last night in Los Angeles ... to play zero of the songs that made them influential.&quot;

Mr. Bungle collaborated with several guests during the shows including the comedian Eric Andre, who introduced the band at the beginning of their show at February 7, and Jed Watts, the original drummer of Mr. Bungle.

In the weeks following the February 2020 shows, Mr. Bungle posted without comment on their Twitter account pictures taken in a recording studio, hinting at an upcoming recording. On March 23 and 24, &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine published a two-part press release and interview with Spruance formally announcing that the band, joined by Scott Ian and Dave Lombardo, were currently re-recording &quot;The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny&quot; in addition to the previously unreleased songs and covers performed during the reunion shows, with an expected release on Patton&#x27;s label Ipecac Recordings in the fall of 2020. On June 5, Mr. Bungle released a cover of &quot;U.S.A.&quot; by The Exploited, featuring a hardcore punk sound. &quot;Doesn&#x27;t matter what part of the political spectrum you are on, everyone at some point has said, &#x27;Fuck the USA,&#x27;&quot; Spruance commented. &quot;The closest thing we have to a universal sentiment.&quot;

On August 13, the band officially announced that the album, now titled &quot;The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny Demo&quot;, would be released on October 30. Alongside the announcement, they released an animated music video for the single &quot;Raping Your Mind&quot; directed by Eric Livingston. Dunn described re-recording their earliest material with Lombardo and Ian as &quot;we were finally utilizing our Ph.Ds in Thrash Metal. All we had to do was go back to our original professors for some additional guidance and talk them into joining us. Turns out we were A+ students... We were haunted for 35 years by the fact that this music wasn&#x27;t given it&#x27;s [sic] due respect. Now we can die.&quot;

In December 2023, Theo Lengyel was named as a person of interest in the disappearance of his girlfriend, Alice &quot;Alyx&quot; Kamakaokalani Herrmann. On January 2, 2024, he was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. On October 11, 2024, he was found guilty of killing Herrmann. On November 8, he was given a sentence of life imprisonment with a minimum term of 25 years.

==Style and influence==
According to &quot;Invisible Oranges&quot;, Mr. Bungle &quot;cultivated their own complex universe whose parts, embracing both regimen and disorder, inspired awe with increasing perspective and closer examination&quot;. Initially a death metal band, and later a thrash metal group, Mr. Bungle changed their style in the &#x27;90s to a funk metal sound that showed the influence of ska, disco and avant-garde jazz. In a 2021 interview, Spruance claimed that, &quot;there&#x27;s never been a time in Mr. Bungle’s existence where it wasn&#x27;t a metal band. There was always metal in there somewhere, and when we think ‘metal’; metal isn&#x27;t just riffs and drums playing like a machine; it&#x27;s a whole psychology. The psychology of metal is there, even in that funk metal era; it&#x27;s everywhere.&quot; 

&quot;CBS News&quot; said that the band&#x27;s music was a &quot;anarchic mix of metal, ska, experimental jazz, punk and soundtrack music&quot;. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; described Mr. Bungle as &quot;experimental rockers&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&quot; described the band as &quot;free-form rock radicals&quot; and said that &quot;Mr. Bungle&#x27;s sound and approach are a unique mix of the experimental, the abstract, and the absurd&quot;. Pioneers of avant-garde metal, the band was also categorized as alternative metal by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;The Quietus&quot;.

Prior to the release of their first album in 1991, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that the band &quot;performs oddball music one critic has described as Bugs Bunny-type jazz.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; referred to the band as &quot;Zappa-esque Bay Area pranksters&quot; in 2000. Allmusic&#x27;s Greg Prato described Mr. Bungle&#x27;s music as a &quot;unique mix of the experimental, the abstract, and the absurd&quot;, while Patrick Macdonald of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; characterized their music as &quot;harsh, grating, unstructured, blasting, squeaky, speedy, slow, eerie and strangely compelling&quot;. Distinctive features of the music were the use of numerous different instruments, unusual vocals, and the use of unpredictable song formats along with a number of different musical genres. Greg Prato stated they &quot;may be the most talented rock instrumentalists today, as they skip musical genres effortlessly, while Mike Patton illustrates why many consider him to be the best singer in rock&quot;. Not all have agreed, with one reviewer calling the band the &quot;most ridiculously terrible piece of festering offal ever scraped off the floor of a slaughterhouse&quot;. Journalist Geoffrey Himes criticized the band by stating &quot;the vocals are so deeply buried in the music that the words are virtually indecipherable&quot; and described the music as &quot;aural montages rather than songs, for short sections erupt and suddenly disappear, replaced by another passage with little connection to what preceded it&quot;.

Mr. Bungle frequently incorporated unconventional instruments into their music, including jaw harp, cimbalom, xylophone, glockenspiel, ocarina, bongos, and woodblocks. Journalist John Serba commented that the band&#x27;s instrumentation &quot;sounded kind of like drunken jazz punctuated with Italian accordions and the occasional Bavarian march, giant power chord, or feedback noise thrown in&quot;. Mike Patton&#x27;s vocals often employed extended techniques such as death metal growls, crooning, rapping, screeching, gurgling, or whispering. The arrangement of their songs was also idiosyncratic, often lacking a structured song format and rotating through different genres ranging from slow melodies to thrash metal. &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist Jon Pareles described the band&#x27;s music as &quot;leap[ing] from tempo to tempo, key to key, style to style, all without warning&quot;. Similarly, critic Patrick Macdonald commented, &quot;In the middle of hard-to-follow, indecipherable noise, a relatively normal, funky jazz organ solo will suddenly drift in&quot;. 

The majority of the band&#x27;s music and lyrics were written by Patton, Dunn, and Spruance, with McKinnon and Heifetz occasionally contributing. Regarding their creative process, McKinnon stated in a 2000 interview that &quot;This band is kind of like a cruel boys club in a way. You bring some ideas and if you&#x27;re not 100 percent firm about bringing a certain idea to this group, you can watch it get kicked aside and die really quickly.&quot;

It has been noted that the band were given an unusual amount of artistic freedom during their tenure with the major label Warner Bros. Records. In a 2016 interview, Trevor Dunn reflected:
Trey Spruance claimed that Warner Bros. cared so little about the band that they once considered delivering an entire album&#x27;s worth of static noise to the label, expecting them not to listen to it. &quot;Then we realized – actually it doesn&#x27;t matter to them; that would seem like a big statement but they would just shrug. They don&#x27;t care about that shit.&quot;

==Legacy==
Korn have utilized what they have dubbed the &quot;Mr. Bungle chord&quot; (A flat fifth chord or &quot;tritone&quot;). James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer, one of Korn&#x27;s guitarists, stated in a 2015 interview that Mr. Bungle&#x27;s self-titled debut &quot;set the tone for us and what we went on to do creatively&quot;.

==Stage shows and image==

Mr. Bungle were known for their characteristically unconventional stage shows, where the band members would dress up in costumes and masks. The 1999–2000 shows in support of the &quot;California&quot; album usually featured Dunn dressed as a blonde girl resembling Goldilocks or The St. Pauli Girl, although for the other members this period was largely devoid of masks and outfits due to the increased demands of the music. Occasionally, the band would simply appear in black suits with white dress shirts or dress up in chef costumes, cowboy suits or as the Village People.

==Members==
All of the members of the &#x27;classic&#x27; lineup of Mr. Bungle are multi-instrumentalists. The timeline below reflects only their main roles. Members of the band were known to switch instruments mid-performance.

==Early life==
Charles James Napier was the eldest son of Colonel George Napier, and his second wife, Lady Sarah Lennox, with this being the second marriage for both parties. Lady Sarah was the great-granddaughter of King Charles II. Napier was born at the Whitehall Palace in London.

When he was only three years old his father took up an administrative post in Dublin, moving his family to live in Celbridge in County Kildare, Ireland, within walking distance of Lady Sarah&#x27;s sister, Lady Louisa Conolly. His early education was at the local school in Celbridge. At the age of twelve, he joined the 33rd Infantry Regiment of the British Army in January 1794, but quickly transferred to the 89th and did not immediately take up his commission, but returned to school in Ireland. In 1799, aged 17, he took up active service in the army as aide-de-camp to Sir James Duff.

==Peninsular War==
Napier commanded the 50th (Queen&#x27;s Own) Regiment of Foot during the Peninsular War in Iberia against Napoleon Bonaparte. Napier&#x27;s activities there ended during the Battle of Corunna, in which he was wounded and left for dead on the battlefield. Napier was rescued, barely alive, by a French Army drummer named Guibert, and taken as a prisoner of war. Nevertheless, Napier was awarded an Army Gold Medal after he was returned to British hands.

Napier recuperated from his wounds while he was being held near the headquarters of the French Marshal Soult and afterwards Michel Ney. On 21 March 1809, a British sloop approached Corunna with a letter for the commandant of the city, requesting information about the fate of Napier on behalf of his family. After an agreement between Ney and Napier, the latter was released on a convalescence leave at home for three months, under parole to return to Ney&#x27;s quarters wherever he was on the first of July 1809.

Napier volunteered to return to the Iberian Peninsula in 1810 to fight again against Napoleon in Portugal, notably in the Battle of the Côa, where he had two horses shot out from under him, in the Battle of Bussaco, in the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro, and in the Battle of Badajoz (1812) (the second siege of Badajoz) in Extremadura, Spain, in which he was a lieutenant colonel in command of the 102nd Regiment of Foot. For his deeds at Bussaco and at Fuentes de Oñoro, Napier won the silver medal with two clasps.

==Bermuda Garrison and American War of 1812==

Napier subsequently served in Bermuda, where the 102 Regiment was posted in 1812 to the Bermuda Garrison, stationed at St. George&#x27;s Garrison. Bermuda, part of British North America and in the process of becoming an Imperial fortress, was the main base in winter of the North America Station of the Royal Navy, and his brother Henry Napier, at the time a naval lieutenant serving on a frigate that belonged to the station, was frequently in Bermuda. The American War of 1812 commenced with a declaration of war by the United States as the regiment was leaving England. In 1813, Lieutenant-Colonel, Sir Thomas Sydney Beckwith arrived in Bermuda to command a force tasked with raiding the Atlantic Seaboard of the United States, specifically in the region of Chesapeake Bay, with Napier as his Second-in-Command. Beckwith split the force into two brigades, one, composed of the 102nd Regiment, Royal Marines, and a unit recruited from French prisoners of war, was under Napier&#x27;s command, and the other under Lieutenant-Colonel Williams of the Royal Marines. Embarking aboard naval vessels engaged on the American coast on the 8 June, 1813, they took part in raids on the Atlantic coast of the United States, including the Battle of Craney Island on 22 June 1813. Minus the two companies of Frenchmen, they left the Chesapeake and landed at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 20 September, 1813. The Royal Marine battalion and Royal Marine Artillery were to go to Quebec under the command of Beckwith, leaving Napier a brigade of 1,000 infantry and three artillery pieces. It had been proposed to move the 102nd to operations in the American south, but this was not carried out. Napier transferred by exchange to the 50th Regiment of Foot in September, 1813. The 102nd Regiment was in Maine at the cessation of hostilities (the Treaty of Ghent was signed on 24 December 1814 by the negotiators, ratified by the Prince Regent on 27 December, and by the United States President on 17 February, ending the war). After three years at New Brunswick, it embarked in the autumn of 1817 to return to England under the command of Major Gustavus Rochford.

Napier served as governor of Kefalonia in the Ionian Islands, from 1822 to 1830, and wrote a book about the island. Later he served on a diplomatic mission to Greece during its War of Independence, a conflict in which he had great sympathy for the Greeks. He also wrote two more books on Greece and the Ionian Islands.

==Return to England==
In 1835, Napier was designated Governor of the planned new colony of South Australia, but he resigned the position, recommending William Light for the post. However, John Hindmarsh had already been lobbying for the position and had gained influential support, and was appointed to it.

Napier became the General Officer Commanding of the Northern District in England in April 1839.

=== Service as General Officer Commanding of the Northern District ===
In April 1839, Napier was put in command of 6,000 troops in the Northern District, with one of his designated tasks being to confront the many Chartist protests active in the area. As a leftist who in principle agreed with the Chartist demands for Democracy, Napier made efforts to keep violence to a minimum and calm tensions in the area as best he could whilst still obeying his orders. Napier privately blamed &quot;Tory injustice and Whig imbecility&quot; for the conflicts, and pitied the Chartists rather than feared them.

==Service in India==

In 1842, at the age of 60, Napier was appointed Major General to the command of the British Indian Army within the Bombay Presidency. Here Lord Ellenborough&#x27;s policy led Napier to Sindh Province (Scinde), for the purpose of quelling the insurrection of the Muslim rulers who had remained hostile to the Company rule in India following the First Anglo-Afghan War. Napier&#x27;s campaign against these chieftains resulted in victories in the Battle of Miani (Meanee) against General Hoshu Sheedi and the Battle of Hyderabad, and then the subjugation of the Sindh, and its annexation by its eastern neighbours as the Sind Division.

His orders had been only to put down the rebels: by conquering the whole Sindh Province, he greatly exceeded his mandate. Napier was supposed to have despatched to his superiors the short, notable message, &quot;Peccavi&quot;, the Latin for &quot;I have sinned&quot; (which was a pun on &quot;I have Sindh&quot;). This pun appeared under the title &#x27;Foreign Affairs&#x27; in &quot;Punch&quot; magazine on 18 May 1844. The true author of the pun was, however, Englishwoman Catherine Winkworth, who submitted it to &quot;Punch&quot;, which then printed it as a factual report. Later, Napier made several comments on the Sindh adventure to the effect of: &quot;If this was a piece of rascality, it was a noble piece of rascality!&quot;
On 4 July 1843, Napier was appointed Knight Grand Cross in the military division of the Order of the Bath, in recognition of his leading the victories at Miani and Hyderabad. He was also in 1843 given the colonelcy of the 97th (The Earl of Ulster&#x27;s) Regiment of Foot, transferring later in the year to be colonel of the 22nd (The Cheshire) Regiment of Foot.

Napier was appointed Governor of the Bombay Presidency by Lord Ellenborough. However, under his leadership the administration clashed with the policies of the directors of the British East India Company, and Napier was accordingly removed from office and returned home in disgust. Napier was again dispatched to India during the spring of 1849, in order to obtain the submission of the Sikhs. However upon arriving once again in India, Napier found that this had already been accomplished by Lord Gough and his army.

Napier remained for a while as the Commander-in-Chief in India. He also quarrelled repeatedly with Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India. The source of the dispute was Dalhousie&#x27;s behaviour on India&#x27;s north-west frontier. Dalhousie had requested repeated punitive raids against villagers who had not paid taxes. Napier was opposed to these tactics but accompanied a column of East India Company troops under Sir Colin Campbell and Punjab troops under George Lawrence. The Punjab troops were not under Napier&#x27;s command and began burning villages on Lawrence&#x27;s orders. &quot;This was as impolitic as it was dishonourable to the character of British soldiers,&quot; protested Napier, &quot;yet no power was entrusted to me, and I had been sufficiently cautioned against interfering with the Punjab civil authorities.&quot;

Napier returned home to England for the last time. He was still suffering with physical infirmities which were results of his wounds during the Peninsular War, and he died about two years later at Oaklands, near Portsmouth, England, on 29 August 1853, at the age of 71. However his quarrel with Dalhousie was not over. In his posthumously published &quot;Defects, Civil and Military of the Indian Government&quot; (Westerton, 1853) he detected and condemned the growing superciliousness of the English in India towards the Indians; &quot;The younger race of Europeans keep aloof from Native officers … How different this from the spirit which actuated the old men of Indian renown,&quot; he wrote. He proposed that British officers should learn the language of the natives and that native officers be appointed as ADCs and Companions of the Bath. &quot;The Eastern intellect is great, and supported by amiable feelings&quot;, he wrote, &quot;and the Native officers have a full share of Eastern daring, genius and ambition; but to nourish these qualities they must be placed on a par with European officers.&quot;
When revolt broke out in 1857, Napier&#x27;s &quot;Defects&quot; was hailed as a prophetic work which correctly identified many of the seething tensions in the sub-continent. The problem was as one of his contemporaries observed &quot;Had he made his representations with sober moderation, eschewing all offensive exaggeration, his warnings and suggestions would have commanded attention. Instead they were pooh-poohed as the emanations of a distempered mind.&quot;

Napier&#x27;s former house is now part of Oaklands Catholic School of Waterlooville. Napier died on 29 August 1853 and his remains were buried in the Royal Garrison Church in Portsmouth.

===Sati practice===
Napier enforced the British prohibition of suttee, or &quot;sati&quot; practice. This was the custom of having a widow burning alive on the funeral pyre of her husband. While rarer during the time Napier ruled Sindh, Napier judged that these immolations were motivated by profits for the priests; when told of an actual Sati about to take place, he informed those involved that he would stop the sacrifice. The priests complained that this was a customary religious rite, and that customs of a nation should be respected. As recounted by his brother William, he famously replied:

:&quot;&quot;Be it so. This burning of widows is your custom; prepare the funeral pile. But my nation has also a custom. When men burn women alive we hang them, and confiscate all their property. My carpenters shall therefore erect gibbets on which to hang all concerned when the widow is consumed. Let us all act according to national customs.&quot; &quot;

===On slavery and plunder===
Napier opposed slavery. According to the memoir on Napier by William, the Sindh cultivator was bonded and oppressed, and the numerous Hindus were plundered people and their faith was condemned by Balochis and Sindhis alike. They were eager for peace and protection. Napier removed the Amirs from power, dismantled their private assembly of armed men, proclaimed that taxes previously collected by the Amirs from the peasants be paid to the English instead, and that slavery was abolished throughout the land. This was vehemently opposed by Balochi masters, but welcomed by slave-girls of the harems.

Napier found that the Sindh was divided into land parcels called &quot;kardarats&quot;, under a headman called &quot;kardar&quot;, who were under an Arabian &quot;cadi&quot;. The &quot;cadi&quot; had powers to summarily fine and imprison, and in practice exercised powers of life, death and torture. The &quot;kardar&quot; collected land taxes and customs, frequently fining and torturing the villagers to a level of fear that they were slaves of the chief to whose estate their village belonged. Napier continued the old system of &quot;kardars&quot;, but made them official collectors giving them government salaries, allowing villagers to file complaints against any &quot;kardar&quot;.

While stationed at Karachi, Napier found that the land was owned by the state, Amirs were collecting land taxes with &quot;shocking cruelty – mutilations and tortures&quot;, with land tax rates between half and two-thirds. The due collectors enjoyed hereditary tenures in a feudal &quot;jagir&quot; system where the husbandman was a mere slave. These oppressive practices had led many Sindh farmers to abandon their farms and move to the desert. Napier challenged this oppression.

Napier opposed the slavery custom where, according to William&#x27;s memoir, young girls would be dragged from &quot;their homes for the harems of the great&quot;. His efforts to respect the rights of women and children required him to battle numerous Amirs who previously exercised &quot;unmitigated cruelty and debauchery&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1903, the 25th Bombay Rifles (which as the 25th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry had formed part of Napier&#x27;s force in the conquest of Sindh) was renamed the 125th Napier&#x27;s Rifles. Since amalgamated, it is now the 5th Battalion (Napier&#x27;s) of the Rajputana Rifles.

A bronze in honour of Napier by George Gamon Adams (1821–1898) surveys from its plinth the southwest corner of Trafalgar Square, while a marble stands in the Crypt of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. In his bronze, he is shown bareheaded, in military uniform, with his cloak thrown back. His left hand is grasping his sword by the scabbard and raised above his waist, while his right, extended, holds a scroll symbolic of the government awarded to Scinde during his tenure of office. The monument was erected without ceremony on 26 November 1855 and paid for by means of public subscriptions, the most numerous contributors being private soldiers.

Some controversy was raised in October 2000 when Ken Livingstone, the newly elected mayor of London, requested that the statue of Napier and that of Major General Sir Henry Havelock be moved to less prominent positions, stating as his reason &quot;I have not a clue who two of the generals there are or what they did&quot;, but these requests did not result in any action.

His remains lie in the now-ruined Royal Garrison Church, Portsmouth. His tomb is immediately outside the west door of the church. A loose plaque in the church is thought to have indicated the burial place of Napier, inside what is now the west wall.

The city of Napier in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region of New Zealand is named after him. The suburb of Meeanee commemorates his victory in the Battle of Miani.

The city of Karachi in Sindh (Pakistan) earlier had a Napier Road (now Shahrah-e-Altaf Hussain), Napier Street (now Mir Karamali Talpur Road) and Napier Barracks (now Liaquat Barracks) on Sharah-e-Faisal. In the port area, there is also a Napier Mole. In Manora, the St. Paul&#x27;s Church, erected in 1864, is a memorial to Napier. Karachi Grammar School named its second-oldest house &quot;Napier&quot;. 

There is a residential area in Quetta named Napier Lines.
The Indian city of Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh state has a neighbourhood called Napier Town.

<text>An urtext edition (from German prefix &quot;original&quot;) of a work of classical music is a printed version intended to reproduce the original intention of the composer as exactly as possible, without any added or changed material. Other kinds of editions distinct from urtext are &quot;facsimile&quot; and &quot;interpretive&quot; editions, discussed below.

== Preparing urtext editions ==

===Sources===

The sources for an urtext edition include the autograph (that is, the manuscript produced in the composer&#x27;s hand), hand copies made by the composer&#x27;s students and assistants, the first published edition, and other early editions. When the editor relies on a first edition, it is sometimes best to rely not on the earliest printed copies, but on later printings. This is because publishers sometimes kept the plates from the earliest printing, reusing them for later printings with corrections from the composer. A particularly valuable source for urtext editions is a copy of the first edition that was hand-corrected by the composer.

An urtext edition will often have a prologue stating which sources the editor used. The editor will provide the academic library or other repository where manuscripts or first editions are stored.

Where the sources are few, or misprint-ridden, or conflicting, the task of the urtext editor becomes difficult. Cases where the composer had bad penmanship (for example, Beethoven) or revised the work after publication, likewise create difficulties.

===Issues of interpretation and reporting===
A fundamental problem in urtext editing is how to present variant readings. If the editor includes too few variants, this restricts the freedom of the performer to choose. Yet including unlikely variants from patently unreliable sources likewise serves the performer badly. Where the editor must go farthest out on a limb is in identifying misprints or scribal errors. The great danger—not at all hypothetical—is that an eccentric or even inspired choice on the composer&#x27;s part will be obliterated by an overzealous editor.

One other source of difficulty arises from the fact that works of music usually involve passages that are repeated (either identically or similarly) in more than one location; this occurs, for instance, in the recapitulation section of a work in sonata form or in the main theme of a rondo. Often the dynamic markings or other marks of expression found in one location in the source material are missing in analogous locations. The strictest possible practice is to render all markings literally, but an urtext editor may also want to point out the markings found in parallel passages.

One common response of editors for all of these difficulties is to provide written documentation of the decisions that were made, either in footnotes or in a separate section of commentary.

== Types of editions ==
===Facsimile editions===

Urtext editions differ from facsimile editions, which simply present a photographic reproduction of one of the original sources for a work of music. The urtext edition adds value to what the performer could get from a facsimile by integrating evidence from multiple sources and exercising informed scholarly judgment. Urtext editions are often easier to read than facsimiles, due to poor penmanship or damage to the manuscript in the original document. Thus, facsimile editions are intended mostly for use by scholars, along with performers who pursue scholarship as part of their preparation.

In modern times, digital scans of the composer&#x27;s manuscript or the first edition are increasingly posted on line, by institutions such as the International Music Score Library Project or the Beethoven House in Bonn. Such postings are similar to a facsimile edition but usually lack editorial commentary.

The musicologist James Webster, basing his remarks on his study of two leading urtext editions of Haydn&#x27;s E flat Piano Sonata, H. XVI:49, suggests that players interested in historically informed performance ought to play from a facsimile. The reason is that some markings made by the composer simply cannot be rendered faithfully in a printed edition. For Haydn, these include marks that are intermediate in length between a dot and a stroke (which evidently have different meanings for this composer), or phrase arcs that end high above the notes, leaving it ambiguous where a phrase begins or ends. In such cases, printed editions are forced to make a choice; only a facsimile can provide an unaltered expression of the composer&#x27;s intent.

===Interpretive editions===

Urtext editions also differ from interpretive editions, which offer the editor&#x27;s personal opinion on how to perform the work. This is indicated by providing markings for dynamics and other forms of musical expression, which supplement or replace those of the composer. In extreme cases, interpretive editions have deliberately altered the composer&#x27;s notes or even deleted entire passages. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many famous performing musicians provided interpretive editions, including Harold Bauer, Artur Schnabel, and Ignacy Jan Paderewski. In the days before recorded music, such editions were often the only way that students could obtain inspiration from the performing practice of leading artists, and even today they retain value for this purpose.

A compromise between urtext and interpretive editing is an edition in which the editor&#x27;s additions are typographically distinguished (usually with parentheses, size, greyscale or detailed in accompanying prose) from the composer&#x27;s own markings. Such compromise editions are particularly useful for early music, where the interpretation of the musical notation of long ago often poses difficulties.

==Authenticity==

Webster has suggested that many editions that are labeled &quot;Urtext&quot; do not really qualify:

==Editions currently used==

William S. Newman suggested (in 1986) that in music teaching, urtext editions have become increasingly favored, though he expressed some ambivalence about this development:

The Bülow–Lebert edition to which Newman refers is a well-known interpretive edition of the sonatas.

Robert Estrin, a piano teacher, favors the use of Urtext editions but notes that their use can be problematic for beginning and intermediate students:
If you’re a serious player, you really want to know what the composer wrote and what the editor added. Otherwise, you might not be faithful to the intentions of the composer. However, Bach, for example, rarely wrote any phrasing or dynamics in his keyboard music. But that doesn’t mean it should be played devoid of expression or phrasing. So having some suggestions from the editor can be a godsend. Even Mozart doesn’t have a lot of expression marks. Sometimes having those markings can be incredibly helpful if you’re a beginner or intermediate student.
Estrin advocates the type of urtext edition described above, in which the editor&#x27;s markings intended to help performers are given with grey or otherwise distinct typography. He also advocates editions that offering fingerings for keyboard and string players.

<text>Andouille ( , ; ; from Latin ) is a smoked sausage made using pork, originating in France but also known as an element in Cajun cuisine.

==France==

In France, particularly Brittany and Normandy, the traditional ingredients of andouille are primarily pig chitterlings, tripe, onions, wine, and seasoning. It is generally grey and has a distinctive odor. A similar, but unsmoked and smaller, sausage is called andouillette, literally &quot;little andouille&quot;. Some andouille varieties use the pig&#x27;s entire gastrointestinal system. Various French regions have their own recipes such as: &quot;&quot;l’andouille de Guémené&quot;, &quot;de Vire&quot;, &quot;de Cambrai&quot;, &quot;d’Aire-sur-la-Lys&quot;, &quot;de Revin&quot;, &quot;de Jargeau&quot;, &quot;de Bretagne&quot;, or &quot;du Val d&#x27;Ajol&quot;&quot;.

==Italy==
&#x27;Nduja, a spreadable pork salami from Calabria, probably originates as a variation of andouille, originally introduced to Italy in the 13th century by the Angevins.

==United States==

In the U.S., the sausage is most often associated with Louisiana Cajun cuisine, where it is a coarse-grained smoked sausage made using pork, garlic, pepper, onions, wine, and seasonings. Once the casing is stuffed, the sausage is smoked again (double smoked).
Nicknamed the &quot;Andouille Capital of the World&quot;, the town of LaPlace, Louisiana, on the Mississippi River, is especially noted for its Cajun andouille.

The country Cajuns west of Lafayette, Louisiana, make andouille similar to the French. They season the pig intestines with salt and cayenne pepper, soak them in a water and vinegar bath overnight, and then rinse them well before stuffing them one into another lengthwise. They cut and tie them into long links with string and hang them with the sausage in the smoke house. They are not twisted into links because they are too dense. When a link is cut, the concentric rings of the intestines can be seen.

Though somewhat similar, andouille is not to be confused with &quot;hot links&quot;, New Orleans hot sausage, or similar finely ground, high-fat, heavily peppered sausages.

<doc id="324996" wikidata="Q2749419" url="?curid=324996" title="John Tyndall (far-right activist)">
<text>John Hutchyns Tyndall (14 July 193419 July 2005) was a British neo-fascist political activist. A leading member of various small neo-Nazi groups during the late 1950s and 1960s, he was chairman of the National Front (NF) from 1972 to 1974 and again from 1975 to 1980, and then chairman of the British National Party (BNP) from 1982 to 1999. He unsuccessfully stood for election to the House of Commons and European Parliament on several occasions.

Born in Devon and educated in Kent, Tyndall undertook national service prior to embracing the extreme right. In the mid-1950s, he joined the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL) and came under the influence of its leader, Arthur Chesterton. Finding the LEL too moderate, in 1957 he and John Bean founded the National Labour Party (NLP), an explicitly &quot;National Socialist&quot; (Nazi) group. In 1960, the NLP merged with Colin Jordan&#x27;s White Defence League to found the first British National Party (BNP). Within the BNP, Tyndall and Jordan established a paramilitary wing called Spearhead, which angered Bean and other party members. They expelled Tyndall and Jordan, who went on to establish the National Socialist Movement and then the international World Union of National Socialists. In 1962, they were convicted and briefly imprisoned for their paramilitary activities. After a split with Jordan, Tyndall formed his Greater Britain Movement (GBM) in 1964. Although never changing his basic beliefs, by the mid-1960s, Tyndall was replacing his overt references to Nazism with appeals to British nationalism.

In 1967, Tyndall joined Chesterton&#x27;s newly founded National Front (NF) and became its leader in 1972, overseeing growing membership and electoral growth. His leadership was threatened by various factions within the party which eventually led to his losing his position as leader in 1974. He resumed this position in 1975, although the latter part of the 1970s saw the party&#x27;s prospects decline. Following an argument with long-term comrade Martin Webster, Tyndall resigned from the party in 1980 and formed his short-lived New National Front (NNF). In 1982, he merged the NNF into his own newly formed British National Party (BNP). Under Tyndall, the BNP established itself as the UK&#x27;s most prominent extreme-right group during the 1980s, although electoral success eluded it. Tyndall&#x27;s refusal to moderate the BNP&#x27;s policies or image caused anger among a growing array of &quot;modernisers&quot; in the party, who ousted him in favour of Nick Griffin in 1999. In 2005, Tyndall was charged with incitement to racial hatred for comments made at a BNP meeting. He died two days before his trial was due to take place.

Tyndall promoted a racial nationalist belief in a distinct white &quot;British race&quot;, arguing that this race was threatened by a Jewish conspiracy to encourage non-white migration into Britain. He called for the establishment of an authoritarian state which would deport all non-whites from the country, engage in a eugenics project, and re-establish the British Empire through the military conquest of parts of Africa. He never gained any mainstream political respectability in the United Kingdom although he proved popular among sectors of the British far-right.

==Early life==

=== 1934–1958: Youth ===
John Tyndall was born in Stork Nest, Topsham Road in Exeter, Devon, on 14 July 1934, the son of Nellie Tyndall, &quot;née&quot; Parker and George Francis Tyndall. Through the Tyndall family line, he was related to the early English translator of the Bible, William Tyndale and the physicist John Tyndall. His paternal family were Irish Unionists from County Waterford, who had a long history of service in the Royal Irish Constabulary. His grandfather had been a district inspector in the Constabulary and he had also fought against the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence. His father had moved to England, working as a Metropolitan Police officer, and then he worked as a warden at St George&#x27;s House, a YMCA hostel in Southwark. Tyndall later stated that despite the fact that his father had been raised in a Unionist family, he eventually adopted internationalist views. He claimed that his mother exhibited &quot;a kind of basic British patriotism&quot; and he also claimed that it was she who shaped his early political views. His upbringing was emotionally stable and materially secure. Tyndall studied at the Beckenham and Penge Grammar School in west Kent, where he attained three O-levels, a &quot;moderate&quot; result. At the school, his achievements had been sporting rather than academic, because he enjoyed playing cricket and association football and he also developed a passion for fitness.

Tyndall completed his national service in West Germany from 1952 to 1954. A member of the Royal Horse Artillery, he achieved the rank of lance-bombardier. On completion, he returned to Britain and turned his attention to political issues. Initially interested in socialism, he attended the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students which was held in Moscow, the capital city of the Soviet Union, in 1957. Nevertheless, he began to believe that left-wing politics was being infused with &quot;anti-British attitudes&quot;, moving swiftly to the political right. He was devoted to the preservation of the British Empire and he was hostile to what he believed was the growing permissiveness of British society, stating that &quot;the smell everywhere was one of decadence&quot;. During that decade he read &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, the autobiography and political manifesto of the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, growing sympathetic to Hitler&#x27;s political beliefs and Nazism. In particular, Tyndall approved of &quot;the descriptions of the workings of certain Jewish forces in Germany, which seemed uncannily similar to what I had observed of the same kinds of forces in Britain.&quot; He concluded that Britain&#x27;s decision to go to war against Nazi Germany was ultimately the result of a conspiracy which was primarily headed by Jews, a conspiracy which he thought had also masterminded non-white immigration to Britain after the war.

Around 1957–58, Tyndall decided to commit himself to his political cause full-time, which he was able to do because his job as a salesman allowed him to keep flexible working hours. He decided against joining the Union Movement which was led by the prominent British fascist Oswald Mosley, disagreeing with its promotion of the political union of Britain with continental Europe. Instead, he was attracted to the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL)a right-wing group founded by Arthur Chestertonafter seeing coverage of one of their demonstrations on television. He visited their basement office in Westminster, where he was given some of their literature. He enjoyed Chesterton&#x27;s writings and concurred with his conspiracy theory that Jewish people had been plotting to bring down the British Empire. Tyndall began associating with other young men who had joined the LEL. At a February 1957 by-election in Lewisham North, Tyndall aided the LEL campaign, during which he met another party member, John Bean, an industrial chemist. Both Tyndall and Bean were frustrated by the LEL&#x27;s attempts to exert pressure on the mainstream Conservative Party. They wanted to be involved in a more radical party, one that would combine &quot;nationalism&quot; with &quot;popular socialism&quot; and which would reach out to the white working class through appeals against immigration from the Caribbean.

=== 1958–1962: National Labour Party and the first British National Party ===
In April 1958, Tyndall and Bean founded their own extreme-right group, the National Labour Party (NLP). The group was based at Thornton Heath, Croydon and attracted its early membership from former LEL members living in south and east London. According to the historian Richard Thurlow, the NLP promoted an &quot;English&quot; variant of Nazism and was more pronounced in its &quot;explicit racism&quot; than the LEL had been, focusing less on bemoaning the decline of the British Empire and more on criticising the arrival of non-white immigrants from former British colonies.

The NLP began co-operating with another extreme-right group, the White Defence League, which had been established by Colin Jordan, a secondary school teacher. Together the two groups embarked on a project of stirring up racial tensions among white Britons and black Caribbean immigrants in Notting Hill. Tyndall briefly left the NLP and in his absence Bean and Jordan merged their respective groups into the British National Party (BNP) in 1960. The BNP were racial nationalists, calling for the preservation of a &quot;Nordic race&quot;—of which the &quot;British race&quot; was considered a branch—by removing both immigrants and Jewish influences from Britain. Tyndall soon joined this new BNP, and became a close confidante of Jordan, who helped Tyndall to further embrace neo-Nazism. Tyndall also developed a friendship with Martin Webster, who became a long-term comrade after watching Tyndall speak at a Trafalgar Square rally in 1962.

In April 1961, Tyndall self-published his pamphlet, &quot;The Authoritarian State: Its Meaning and Function&quot;, which helped to cement his reputation within the British far-right. In the pamphlet, he attacked democratic systems of government as part of a conspiracy orchestrated by Jews, quoting from &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. It called for the replacement of the United Kingdom&#x27;s liberal democratic system with an authoritarian one in which a &quot;Leader&quot; is given absolute power.

Within the BNP, Tyndall established an elite group known as Spearhead, members of which wore military-style uniforms inspired by those of the Nazis and underwent paramilitary and ideological training. Tyndall had a great liking for wearing jackboots - Jordan related that on the way to a far-right meeting in Germany, Tyndall made his entourage look for a shoe shop so that he could purchase a pair of genuine German jackboots. It is likely that there were no more than 60 members of Spearhead. The group campaigned on behalf of imprisoned Nazi war criminals Rudolf Hess and Adolf Eichmann. According to the anti-fascist activist Gerry Gable, Spearhead represented the first &quot;terrorist group&quot; founded by neo-Nazis in Britain. Both Bean and another senior BNP member, Andrew Fountaine, were concerned about the overt neo-Nazism embraced by Tyndall and Jordan, instead thinking that the BNP should articulate a more British-oriented form of racial nationalism. In 1962, Bean held a meeting at which Tyndall and Jordan were expelled from the party.

=== 1962–1967: National Socialist Movement and Greater Britain Movement ===
Tyndall and Jordan then regrouped around twenty members of Spearhead and formed the National Socialist Movement (NSM) on 20 April 1962, a date symbolically chosen as Hitler&#x27;s birthday. They celebrated the event with a cake decorated with a Nazi swastika. According to the historian Richard Thurlow, the NSM was &quot;the most blatant Nazi&quot; group active in Britain during the mid-20th century. The NSM gained few members; an estimate in August 1962 suggested that it had only thirty to fifty. The NSM gained the attention of the media as well as Special Branch. In July 1962, Tyndall was arrested for breaching the peace at a Trafalgar Square rally in which he had been attacked by Jewish military veterans and other anti-fascists after calling the Jewish community a &quot;poisonous maggot feeding on a body in an advanced state of decay&quot;. His comments resulted in him being convicted of inciting racial hatred and he was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment, reduced to a fine on appeal. The police then raided the group&#x27;s London headquarters, after which its leading members were brought to trial at the Old Bailey, where they were found guilty of establishing a paramilitary group in contravention of Section Two of the Public Order Act 1936. Tyndall received a six-month prison sentence, while Jordan received nine months.

Although the British authorities had prohibited the American neo-Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell from entering the UK, the NSM managed to smuggle him in via Ireland to attend a summer camp in August 1962. There, the NSM took part in the formation of the World Union of National Socialists (WUNS), at which Jordan was elected &#x27;world führer&#x27; and Rockwell as his heir. Among those in attendance were the neo-Nazi Savitri Devi and the former SS officer Fred Borth.

Jordan had been courting the French socialite Françoise Dior, but while he had been imprisoned, she entered a relationship with Tyndall and they were engaged to be married. On Jordan&#x27;s release, Dior left Tyndall and instead married Jordan in October 1963. This contributed to a growing personal feud between the two men, with Jordan accusing Tyndall and Webster of making obscene phone calls to Dior. Tyndall was also angry at what he perceived as Jordan&#x27;s deviation from orthodox Nazi thought and by the fact that Jordan&#x27;s relationship with Dior had been attracting negative sensationalist press attention for the NSM. In the spring of 1964 Tyndall and Webster tried to oust Jordan as the head of the NSM but failed. In later years Tyndall expressed the view that his involvement in the NSM had been a &quot;profound mistake&quot;, arguing that then he &quot;still had a lot to learn&quot; and that &quot;when one sees one&#x27;s nation and people in danger there is less dishonour in acting and acting wrongly than in not acting at all.&quot;

Now based in Battersea, Tyndall left Jordan and the NSM and formed his own rival, the Greater Britain Movement (GBM). According to Tyndall, &quot;the Greater Britain Movement will uphold and preach pure National Socialism&quot;. According to the political scientist Stan Taylor, the GBM reflected Tyndall&#x27;s desire for &quot;a specifically British variant of National Socialism&quot;. It called for the criminalisation of sexual relations and marriages between white Britons and non-whites and called for the sterilisation of those it deemed unfit to reproduce. The group established its base in a run-down building in Notting Hill, with swastikas being sprayed onto the exterior and an image of Hitler decorating the interior. Tyndall tried to convince the WUNS to accept his GBM as its British representative, but Rockwell—concerned not to encourage schismatic dissenters in his own American Nazi Party—sided with Jordan and the NSM. Tyndall then established contact with Rockwell&#x27;s main rival in the American neo-Nazi scene, the National States&#x27; Rights Party.

Tyndall formed a publishing company, Albion Press, and launched a new magazine which he titled &quot;Spearhead&quot; after his former paramilitary group. &quot;Spearhead&quot; initially labelled itself &quot;an organ of National Socialist opinion in Britain&quot; and described Nazi Germany as &quot;one of the greatest social experiments of our century&quot;. According to the historian Alan Sykes, this magazine became &quot;increasingly influential&quot; in the British far-right. The magazine advertised portraits of Hitler and swastika badges for sale. Much of the material that Tyndall wrote for the journal was less openly neo-Nazi and extreme than his previous writings, something which may have resulted from caution surrounding the Race Relations Act 1965. The GBM engaged in several stunts to raise publicity; in 1964 for instance Webster assaulted the Kenyan leader Jomo Kenyatta outside his London hotel while Tyndall hurled insults at him through a loudspeaker. In 1965, the group staged a shooting incident at its Norwood headquarters, claiming that it had been an attack by anti-fascists. In another instance they distributed stickers emblazoned with a portrait of Hitler and the slogan &quot;he was right&quot;. In 1966, several GBM members were arrested for carrying out arson attacks against synagogues.

==Later career==

=== 1967–1980: National Front ===

In the mid-1960s, there were five extreme-right groups operating in Britain and Tyndall believed that they could achieve more if they united. To that end, &quot;Spearhead&quot; abandoned its open affiliation with neo-Nazism in 1966. That year, Tyndall issued a pamphlet titled &quot;Six Principles of British Nationalism&quot; which made no mention of neo-Nazism or Jewish conspiracies. It also dropped the insistence on armed takeovers present in his earlier thought, acknowledging the possibility that extreme-right nationalists could gain power through the British electoral process. Chesterton read the pamphlet and was impressed, entering into talks with Tyndall&#x27;s GBM about a potential merger of their respective organisations. Independently, Chesterton had also been discussing the issue of a unification with Bean&#x27;s BNP. This proved successful, as the LEL and BNP merged to form the National Front (NF) in 1967. According to Thurlow, the formation of the NF was &quot;the most significant event on the radical right and fascist fringe of British politics&quot; since the internment of the country&#x27;s fascists during the Second World War.

The new NF initially excluded Tyndall and his GBM from joining, concerned that he might seek to mould it in a specifically neo-Nazi direction, although they soon agreed to allow both him and other GBM members to join on probation. On entering, the former GBM soon became the most influential faction within the NF, with many of its members rapidly rising to positions of influence. Tyndall became the party&#x27;s vice chairman and remained loyal to Chesterton, who was the party&#x27;s first chairman, for instance by supporting him when several members of the party directorate rebelled against his leadership in 1970. Although remaining Tyndall&#x27;s private property, &quot;Spearhead&quot; became the &quot;de facto&quot; monthly magazine of the NF. Chesterton resigned as chairman in 1970 and was replaced by the Powellite John O&#x27;Brien. In 1972, O&#x27;Brien and eight other members of the party&#x27;s directorate resigned in protest at Tyndall&#x27;s links to neo-Nazi groups in Germany. This allowed Tyndall to take control as party chairman in 1972.

According to Thurlow, under Tyndall the NF represented &quot;an attempt to portray the essentials of Nazi ideology in more rational language and seemingly reasonable arguments&quot;, functioning as an attempt to &quot;convert racial populists&quot; angry about immigration &quot;into fascists&quot;. Capitalising on anger surrounding the arrival of Ugandan Asian migrants in the country in 1972, Tyndall oversaw the NF during the period of its largest growth. Membership of the party doubled between October 1972 and June 1973, possibly reaching as high as 17,500.
Relations had apparently warmed between Tyndall and Jordan, for they met up after the latter was released from prison in 1968, and Tyndall again met with Jordan in Coventry in 1972 and invited him to join the NF. A poor showing in the February 1974 general election resulted in Tyndall being challenged by two groups within the party, the &#x27;Strasserites&#x27; and the &#x27;Populists&#x27;, the latter of whom were largely Powellite ex-members of the Conservative Party. The Populist challenge was successful and in October 1974 Tyndall was replaced as chairman by John Kingsley Read. Tyndall then used &quot;Spearhead&quot; as a vehicle to criticise rival factions with the NF. As a result, he was expelled from the party during a disciplinary tribunal in November 1975. Tyndall took the issue to the high court, who overturned the expulsion. The &#x27;Populists&#x27; then left the party, splitting to form the National Party in January 1976, which for a short time proved more electorally successful than the NF. Back in the party and with his main rivals gone, Tyndall regained the position of chairman.

Encouraged by Webster and new confidante Richard Verrall, in the mid-1970s Tyndall returned to his openly hardline approach of promoting biological racist and antisemitic ideas. This did not help the NF&#x27;s electoral prospects. In the 1979 general election, the NF mounted the largest challenge of any insurgent party since the Labour Party in 1918, with 303 candidates. Among them were Tyndall&#x27;s wife, mother-in-law and father-in-law. Tyndall stood in Hackney South and Shoreditch, securing 7.6%; this was the Front&#x27;s best result that election, but was down from the 9.4% they had gained in that constituency in October 1974. In the election, the NF &quot;flopped dismally&quot;, securing only 1.3% of the total vote, down from 3.1% in October 1974. This decline may have been due to the increased anti-fascist campaigning of the previous few years, or because the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher had adopted an increasingly tough stance on immigration which attracted many of the votes that had previously gone to the NF. NF membership had also declined and by 1979 had fallen to approximately 5,000. Tyndall nevertheless refused to dilute or moderate his party&#x27;s policies, stating that to do so would be the &quot;naïve chasing of moonbeams&quot;. In November 1979, Fountaine unsuccessfully tried to oust Tyndall as leader, subsequently establishing the National Front Constitutional Movement.

Tyndall had grown distant from Webster over their differences and in the late 1970s began blaming him for the party&#x27;s problems. Webster had for instance disagreed with Tyndall&#x27;s support for Chesterton&#x27;s leadership, while Tyndall was upset with Webster&#x27;s attempts to encourage more skinheads and football hooligans to join the party. Tyndall in particular began criticizing the fact that Webster was a homosexual, emphasising allegations that Webster had been making sexual advances toward young men in the party. More widely, he complained about a &quot;homosexual network&quot; among leading NF members. In October 1979, he called a meeting of the NF directorate at which he urged them to call for Webster&#x27;s resignation. At the meeting, Webster apologised for his conduct and the directorate stood by him against Tyndall. Angered, Tyndall then tried convincing the directorate to grant him greater powers in his position as chairman, but they refused. Tyndall resigned in January 1980, subsequently referring to the party as the &quot;gay National Front&quot;.

In June 1980, Tyndall founded the New National Front (NNF). The NNF claimed that a third of the NF&#x27;s membership defected to join them. Tyndall stated that &quot;I have one wish in this operation and one wish alone, to cleanse the National Front of the foul stench of perversion which has politically crippled it&quot;. As his choice of party name suggested, he remained hopeful that his breakaway group could eventually be re-merged back into the NF. There developed a great rivalry between the two groups, and as the NF&#x27;s new leadership moved it away from the Tyndallite approach, Tyndall realised that he may never have the opportunity to regain his position within it.

=== 1981–1989: Establishing the British National Party ===
In January 1981, Tyndall was contacted by far-right activist Ray Hill, who had become an informant for the anti-fascist magazine &quot;Searchlight&quot;. Hill suggested that Tyndall establish a new political party through which he could unite many smaller extreme-right groups. While Hill&#x27;s real intention had been to cause a further schism among the British far-right and thus weaken it, Tyndall deemed his suggestion to be a good idea. Tyndall made suggestions of unity to a number of other small extreme-right groups and together they established a Committee for Nationalist Unity (CNU) in January 1982.

In March 1982 the CNU held a conference at Charing Cross Hotel in central London and while the NF officially refused to send a delegation, several NF members did attend. The fifty extreme-rightists in attendance agreed that they would establish a new political party, to be known as the British National Party (BNP). According to Tyndall, &quot;The BNP is a racial nationalist party which believes in Britain for the British, that is to say racial separatism.&quot; Under Tyndall&#x27;s leadership, in 1982 the BNP issued its first policy on immigration as &quot;immigration into Britain by non-Europeans ... should be terminated forthwith and we should organise a massive programme of repatriation and resettlement overseas of those peoples of non-European origin already resident in this country.&quot;

Tyndall was to be the leader of this new party, with the majority of its members coming from the NNF, although others were defectors from the NF, British Movement, British Democratic Party and Nationalist Party. The party was formally launched at a press conference held in a Victoria hotel on 7 April 1982. At the conference, Tyndall described the BNP as the &quot;SDP of the far right&quot;, thereby referencing the recent growth of the centrist Social Democratic Party. The historian Nigel Copsey has noted that while the BNP under Tyndall could be described as &quot;Neo-Nazi&quot;, it was not &quot;crudely mimetic&quot; of the original German Nazism. Its stated policy objectives were identical to those that the NF had had under Tyndall&#x27;s leadership in the 1970s. But its constitution was very different. Whereas the NF had a directorate which helped to guide the direction of the party and could replace the leader, Tyndall&#x27;s new BNP gave full executive powers to the chairman. Tyndall ran the BNP from his home, &quot;Seacroft&quot;, in Hove, East Sussex, and he rarely left the county.
In 1986 Tyndall was convicted of inciting racial hatred and sentenced to a year&#x27;s imprisonment; he served only four months before his release. In 1987, the BNP opened discussions with an NF faction, the National Front Support Group (NFSG), to discuss the possibility of a merger, but the NFSG decided against it, remaining cautious about Tyndall&#x27;s total domination of the BNP.

By 1988, &quot;Searchlight&quot; reported that the party&#x27;s membership had declined to around 1,000. Tyndall responded by trying to raise finances, calling for greater sales of their newspaper and increasing the price of membership by 50%. He also promised that he would make the BNP the largest extreme-right group in the UK and that he would establish a professional headquarters for the party. This was achieved in 1989, as a party headquarters was opened in Welling, Southeast London, an area chosen because it was a recipient of significant &#x27;white flight&#x27; from inner London. That year also witnessed the BNP become the most prominent force on the British far-right as the NF collapsed amid internal arguments and schisms.

=== 1990–1999: Growth of the British National Party ===
In the early 1990s, a paramilitary group known as Combat 18 (C18) was formed to protect BNP events from anti-fascist protesters. Tyndall was displeased that by 1992, C18 was having an increased influence over the BNP&#x27;s street activities. Relations between the groups deteriorated such that by August 1993, activists from the BNP and C18 were physically fighting each other. In December 1993, Tyndall issued a bulletin to BNP branches declaring C18 to be a proscribed organisation, furthermore suggesting that it may have been established by agents of the state to discredit the party. To counter C18&#x27;s influence, he secured the American white nationalist militant William Pierce as a guest speaker at the BNP&#x27;s annual rally in November 1995.

Tyndall had observed the electoral success achieved by Jean-Marie Le Pen and the French National Front during the 1980s and hoped that by learning from their activities he could improve the BNP&#x27;s electoral prospects. He saw the issue as being one of credibility among the electorate, declaring that &quot;we should be looking for ways to overcome our present image of weakness and smallness&quot;. He ignored the significant impact that had been achieved by the French NF through moderating its policies and thereby gaining greater respectability among the electorate. While Tyndall had sought to keep skinheads and football hooligans out of the BNP, he still kept a range of Holocaust deniers and convicted criminals close to him. He expressed the view that &quot;we should not be looking for ways of applying ideological cosmetic surgery to ourselves in order to make our features more appealing to our public&quot;. Conversely, in the early 1990s a &#x27;moderniser&#x27; faction emerged in the party that favoured a more electorally palatable strategy and an emphasis on building grassroots support to win local elections. They were impressed by Le Pen&#x27;s move to disassociate his party from biological racism and focus on the perceived cultural incompatibility of different racial groups. Tyndall opposed many of the modernisers&#x27; ideas and sought to stem their growing influence in the party,

In the 1992 general election, the party stood 13 candidates. Tyndall stood in Bow and Poplar, gaining 3% of the vote.
In a council by-election in September 1993, the BNP gained one council seat—won by Derek Beackon in the East London neighbourhood of Millwall—after a campaign that targeted the anger of local whites over the perceived preferential treatment received by Bangladeshi migrants in social housing.
At the time Tyndall described this as the BNP&#x27;s &quot;moment in history&quot;, deeming it a sign that the party was entering the political mainstream. Following an anti-BNP campaign launched by anti-fascist and local religious groups it lost its Millwall seat during the 1994 local elections.

Tyndall stood as the BNP candidate in the 1994 Dagenham by-election, in which he gained 9% of the vote and had his electoral deposit returned. This was the first time that an extreme right candidate had retained their deposit since Webster&#x27;s 1973 showing for the NF in West Bromwich.
In the 1997 general election, the party stood over fifty candidates. Tyndall stood in the East London constituency of Poplar and Canning Town, where he received 7.26% of the vote. Tyndall was attacked and badly beaten by anti-fascists at an election meeting in Stratford, East London. He was also photographed with the London nail bomber, David Copeland. Tyndall claimed that following the election, the party received between 2,500 and 3,000 enquiries—roughly the same as they had received after the 1983 general election—although far fewer of these enquirers became members.
The party was stagnating, and Tyndall&#x27;s &quot;political career was now on borrowed time&quot;.

After the BNP&#x27;s poor performance at the 1997 general election, opposition to Tyndall&#x27;s leadership grew. His position was damaged by a lack of financial transparency in the party, with concerns being raised that large donations to the party had been used instead by Tyndall for personal expenses. The modernisers challenged his control of the party, resulting in its first ever leadership election, held in October 1999. Tyndall was challenged by Nick Griffin, who offered an improved administration, financial transparency and greater support for local branches. 80% of party members voted, with two-thirds backing Griffin; Tyndall had secured only 411 votes, representing 30% of the total membership. Tyndall accepted his defeat with equanimity and stood down as chairman. He stated that he would become &quot;an ordinary member&quot;, telling his supporters that &quot;we have all got to pull together in the greater cause of race and nation&quot;.

=== 1999–2005: Final years ===
Tyndall remained a member of the BNP and continued to support it in the pages of &quot;Spearhead&quot;. But Griffin sought to restrain Tyndall&#x27;s ongoing influence in the party, curtailing the distribution of &quot;Spearhead&quot; among BNP members and instead emphasising his own magazine, &quot;Identity&quot;, which was established in January 2000. To combat the influence of declining sales, Tyndall established the group &#x27;Friends of &quot;Spearhead&quot;&#x27;, whose members were asked to contribute £10 a month.

By 2000, Tyndall was beginning to agitate against Griffin&#x27;s leadership, criticising the establishment of the party&#x27;s Ethnic Liaison Committeewhich had one half-Turkish member (Lawrence Rustem)as a move towards admitting non-whites into the party. He was also critical of Griffin&#x27;s abandonment of the party&#x27;s idea of compulsory removal of migrants and non-whites from the country, believing that if they stayed in a segregated system then Britain would resemble apartheid-era South Africa, which he did not think was preferable. His main criticisms were focused not on the party&#x27;s changing direction, but on Griffin&#x27;s character itself, portraying him as unscrupulous and self-centred. Tyndall was determined to retake control of the party, and in this was supported by a group of party hardliners. During a proposed leadership challenge, Tyndall put forward his name, although withdrew it following the 2001 general election when Griffin led the BNP to a clear growth in electoral support. Tyndall nevertheless believed that the BNP&#x27;s electoral success had less to do with Griffin&#x27;s reforms and more to do with external factors such as the 2001 Oldham riots. In turn, Griffin criticised Tyndall in the pages of &quot;Identity&quot;, claiming that the latter was committed to &quot;the sub-Mosleyite wackiness of Arnold Leese&#x27;s Imperial Fascist League and the Big Government mania of the 1930s&quot;. Griffin expelled Tyndall from the party in August 2003, but had to allow his return following an out-of-court settlement shortly after.

Tyndall gave a speech at a BNP event in which he claimed that Asians and Africans had only produced &quot;black magic, witchcraft, voodoo, cannibalism and Aids&quot;, also attacking the Jewish leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, as an &quot;interloper, this immigrant or son of immigrants, who has no roots at all in Britain&quot;. The speech was filmed by undercover investigator Jason Gwynne and included in a 2004 BBC documentary, &quot;The Secret Agent&quot;. On 12 December 2004, these comments resulted in Tyndall being arrested on suspicion of incitement to racial hatred. That month, Tyndall was again expelled from the BNP, this time permanently. The police then charged him, although he was granted unconditional bail in April 2005. Tyndall died of heart failure at his flat—52 Westbourne Villas in Hove—on 19 July 2005. He had been due to stand trial at Leeds Magistrates&#x27; Court two days later. He was survived by his wife and his daughter, Marina.

==Policies and views==
Tyndall has been described as a racial nationalist, and a British nationalist, as well as a fascist, neo-fascist, and a neo-Nazi. Tyndall adhered to neo-Nazism during the 1960s, although from the 1970s onward he increasingly concealed this behind the rhetoric of &quot;British patriotism&quot;. According to Thurlow, this was because by this time Tyndall had realised that &quot;open Nazism was counter-productive&quot; to his cause. This was in accordance with a wider trend among Britain&#x27;s far-right to avoid the term &quot;British fascism&quot;, with its electorally unpalatable connotations and instead refer to &quot;British nationalism&quot; in its public appeals. Sykes stated that Tyndall split with Jordan because—in contrast to the latter&#x27;s neo-Nazi focus on pan-&#x27;Aryan&#x27; unity—he &quot;thought more traditionally in terms of British nationalism, the British race and the British Empire&quot;. Jordan himself accused Tyndall of being &quot;an extreme Tory imperialist, a John Bull, unable to recognise the call of race beyond Britain&#x27;s frontiers&quot;.

Tyndall later described his membership of these openly neo-Nazi groups as a &quot;youthful indiscretion&quot;. He expressed the view that while he regretted his involvement in them, he was not ashamed of having done so: &quot;though some of my former beliefs were mistaken, I will never acknowledge that there was anything dishonourable about holding them.&quot; As leader of the NF he continued to openly approve of Hitler&#x27;s social and economic programme and well as his policies of German territorial expansion. In his 1988 autobiography &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, he stated that while he thought that &quot;many of [Hitler&#x27;s] intentions were good ones and many of his achievements admirable&quot;, he did not think &quot;that it is right for a British movement belonging to an entirely different phase of history to model itself on the movement of Hitler&quot;.

Following this shift away from overt allegiance to Nazism, Tyndall&#x27;s supporters and detractors continued to dispute whether he remained a convinced Nazi. Academic commentators consider that his basic ideological world-view did not change. In 1981, Nigel Fielding stated that while Tyndall&#x27;s views had &quot;moderated remarkably&quot;, in the NF he had still &quot;preserve[d] and defend[ed]&quot; &quot;those traits which were the hallmark&quot; of earlier neo-Nazi groups. Walker noted that in October 1975 Tyndall wrote articles for &quot;Spearhead&quot; which had clearly &quot;returned to the language and ideology of the Nazi days&quot;, and that another article printed the previous month was &quot;pure Nazism in that it reflects exactly the mood and spirit of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;&quot;. The historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke stated that Tyndall simply &quot;cloaked his former extremism in British nationalism&quot;, while the journalist Daniel Trilling commented that &quot;Tyndall&#x27;s claim to have moderated his views was merely expedient&quot;. On his death, &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that Tyndall had remained &quot;a racist, violent neo-Nazi to the end&quot;, while Trilling described Tyndall as having had &quot;a long pedigree in the most extreme and violent quarters of Britain&#x27;s far right&quot;.

The political scientist Nigel Copsey believed that Chesterton had been the &quot;seminal influence&quot; on Tyndall&#x27;s thought. Thurlow disagreed, arguing that Tyndall had been influenced less by Chesterton and Mosley and more by a third figure in Britain&#x27;s &quot;fascist tradition&quot;, Arnold Leese. Thurlow noted that Tyndall adopted Leese&#x27;s &quot;political intransigence… his refusal to compromise with political reality and his willingness to martyr himself for his beliefs&quot;. According to Trilling, the &quot;two guiding stars in ... Tyndall&#x27;s political universe&quot; were Hitler and the British Empire. In contrast to many of his contemporaries in the British far-right, Tyndall was &quot;thoroughly indifferent&quot; to the ideas of the , a French extreme-right movement which had emerged in the 1960s. Whereas the sought to move away from the approach adopted by the fascist movements of the 1930s and 1940s, Tyndall remained wedded to white racial nationalism, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and nostalgia for the British Empire, all approaches generally repudiated by the .

===Race and nationalism===

Tyndall had &quot;deeply entrenched&quot; biologically racist views, akin to those of earlier fascists like Hitler and Leese. He believed that there was a biologically distinct white-skinned &quot;British race&quot; which was one branch of a wider Nordic race. Tyndall was of the view that race defined a nation and that &quot;if that is lost we will have no nation in the future.&quot; He believed the Nordic race to be superior to others, and under his leadership, the BNP promoted a variety of pseudoscientific claims in support of white supremacy. Those parties he controlled restricted membership to people of Northern European ethnic heritage.

Over the course of his career in far-right politics, Tyndall became less outspoken on race after his prosecution under the Race Relations Act. In the mid-1970s, Tyndall used &quot;Spearhead&quot; to claim that &quot;the negro has a smaller brain and a much less complex cerebral structure&quot; than white Europeans. In 1988, Tyndall described his crime as having &quot;dared to publish an honest and frank opinion on the relative merits of Whites and Negroes&quot;. Tyndall argued that non-whites were unassimilable to Britain and that those living in Britain should be repatriated. Tyndall strongly objected to interracial relationships and miscegenation and remarked in his book &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;: &quot;I feel deeply sorry for the child of a mixed marriage, but I can have no sympathy whatever for the parents ... They produced an offspring that will never wholly fit and will undoubtedly face a life much harder than the normal person born of pure race.&quot; In contrast to his views on non-white migration, he spoke positively of white immigrants from Ireland, Poland, Hungary and the Baltic states, regarding them as being racially similar and sharing the &quot;same basic culture&quot; as the British and were thus easily able to assimilate &quot;within a generation or two&quot;.

Tyndall was antisemitic. From earlier fascists like Chesterton, he had inherited a belief that there was a global conspiracy of Jews bent on world domination, opining that &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; (known since the 1920s to be a forgery) was genuine evidence for this. He believed that Jews were responsible for both communism and international finance capitalism, using both to their own ends and that they were responsible for undermining the British Empire and the British race. Tyndall also believed that both democratic government and immigration into Europe were parts of a Jewish conspiracy to weaken other races. In an early edition of &quot;Spearhead&quot;, he had expressed the view that &quot;if Britain were to become Jew-clean she would have no nigger neighbours to worry about ... It is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. Do you hear me? THE JEWS?&quot; Another of his comments, made in 1963, was that &quot;Jewry is a world pest wherever it is found in the world today. The Jews are more clever and more financially powerful than other people and have to be eradicated before they destroy the Aryan peoples&quot;.

Tyndall also engaged in Holocaust denial, declaring that the Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to gain sympathy for themselves and thus aid their plot for world domination. In &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, Tyndall spoke approvingly of Holocaust denier David Irving. In promoting Holocaust denial, Tyndall and those close to him may have been seeking to rehabilitate Hitler and the Nazi government in the British public&#x27;s view.

===Governance===
In the early 1960s, Tyndall espoused the idea of replacing Britain&#x27;s liberal democratic government—which he regarded as a front for the Jewish world conspiracy—with an authoritarian system that he believed would be free of Jewish influence. Between 1961 and 1966 there was a shift in Tyndall&#x27;s publicly espoused views. This focused largely on his beliefs about the structure of an ideal government for—while not rejecting the idea of an authoritarian dictatorship altogether—he placed greater emphasis on the need for the government to be more acceptable to the population. Rather than self-describing himself as an authoritarian, by the mid-1960s he was accusing the country&#x27;s mainstream parties (and the &quot;liberal minority&quot; whom he alleged ran them) of being the real authoritarians, thus portraying himself as a champion of democracy. In this he presented his arguments in a populist manner.

Tyndall believed that liberal democracy was damaging to British society, claiming that liberalism was a &quot;doctrine of decay and degeneration&quot;. Under Tyndall, the NF and BNP sought to dismantle the UK&#x27;s liberal democratic system of parliamentary governance, although both groups were vague about what they sought to replace this system with. In his 1988 work &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, Tyndall wrote of the need for &quot;an utter rejection of liberalism and a dedication to the resurgence of authority&quot;. Tyndall&#x27;s BNP perceived itself as a revolutionary force that would bring about a national rebirth in Britain, entailing a radical transformation of society. It proposed a state in which the Prime Minister would have full executive powers and would be elected directly by the population for an indefinite period of time. This Prime Minister could be dismissed from office in a further election that could be called if Parliament passed a vote of no confidence. It stated that rather than having any political parties, candidates standing for election to the parliament would be independent.

Tyndall described his approach to the economy as &quot;National Economics&quot;, expressing the view that &quot;politics must lead and not be led by, economic forces&quot;. His approach rejected economic liberalism because it did not serve &quot;the national interest&quot;, although still saw advantages in a capitalist system, looking favourably on individual enterprise. He called on capitalist elements to be combined with socialist ones, with the government playing a role in planning the economy. He promoted the idea of the UK becoming an autarky which was economically self-sufficient, with domestic production protected from foreign competition. This attitude was heavily informed by the corporatist system that had been introduced in Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist Italy.

Under Tyndall, the NF alleged that internationalist institutions and organisations were part of the global Jewish conspiracy. Under Tyndall&#x27;s leadership, the BNP had overt anti-Europeanist tendencies, and throughout the 1980s and 1990s he maintained the party&#x27;s opposition to the European Economic Community. Arguing that Britain should establish a White Commonwealth bloc, Tyndall called for a better relationship with South Africa and Rhodesia (both of which practiced apartheid), and urged those nations to permanently retain their systems of racial segregation. He claimed that &quot;power and responsibility&quot; should not be given to the indigenous Africans living in these countries because they were &quot;ill-fitted to use [it] wisely&quot;. He expressed support for Hitler&#x27;s policy of territorial expansion and claimed that the British race required something similar. In &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, he called for the British to re-colonise parts of Africa.

===Social policy===
During Tyndall&#x27;s period of leadership the BNP promoted eugenics, calling for the forced sterilisation of those with genetically transmittable disabilities. In party literature, it talked of improving the British &quot;racial stock&quot; by removing &quot;inferior strains within the indigenous races of the British Isles&quot;. In his magazine &quot;Spearhead&quot;, Tyndall had stated that &quot;sub-human elements&quot;, &quot;perverts&quot; and &quot;asocials&quot; should be eliminated from Britain through &quot;the gas chamber system&quot;. When questioned as to whether Tyndall would seek to exterminate other races if he was in power, he denied it; although not objecting to said exterminations on moral grounds, he stated that such a programme would incur international unpopularity. It is unclear if these statements reflected his genuine views or were tactical justifications designed to not upset potential NF voters.

Tyndall presented himself as an agnostic although expressed admiration for what he claimed were the moral values of Christianity. Tyndall called for a &quot;complete moral regeneration of the national life&quot;. He objected to homosexuality and advocated for it to be outlawed, writing that &quot;the literary and artistic products of the homosexual mind can only flourish in a society where heterosexual values have been gravely weakened.&quot; He expressed the view that the NF &quot;was itself by no means immune to this sickening cult&quot; and he disapproved of the presence of homosexuals in the party. Under Tyndall, the BNP called for the re-criminalisation of homosexual activity.

==Personal life==
American journalist George Thayer, who met with Tyndall in the 1960s, described him as being &quot;blonde and balding&quot; with &quot;cold, evasive eyes&quot;. Thayer stated that Tyndall &quot;had not the slightest spark of humour. He was suspicious, nervous and excitable and moved with all the stiffness of a Prussian in Court.&quot; In his study of the National Front, the journalist Martin Walker described Tyndall as giving off &quot;an impression of absolute, if brittle, self control&quot;. Nigel Fielding, another to have studied the NF, described Tyndall as &quot;a rather small man with a hard, unlined face and pale blue eyes. His movements are abrupt and energetic and he speaks in a loud voice with a clipped inflection.&quot; Walker described him as having a &quot;keen political mind&quot;, with a &quot;concern for organisation [and] meticulous planning&quot;. Tyndall lived a life of temperance and regular exercise, and—according to Walker—his early morning runs had &quot;long been a joke in Nationalist circles&quot;.

Thurlow thought that Tyndall&#x27;s oratorical style was learned from Mosley&#x27;s example, while Trilling instead believed that it was based on that of Hitler. According to Trilling, Tyndall&#x27;s &quot;speeches were pompous but studied ... [he] copied the hand gestures, the rising delivery that ended in a crescendo of angry epithets [from Hitler] ... But it was flat and tedious, like a provincial PE teacher trying to show his bored pupils how the rugby or football greats might have done it.&quot; After Tyndall&#x27;s death, the BNP spokesman Phil Edwards said that &quot;he was a marvellous speaker. He could hold a room and mesmerise them, but he did not have the answer to the problems.&quot; Copsey stated that &quot;Tyndall may have been a rousing speaker, but his tactical intelligence and vision left much to be desired&quot;. The East London BNP activist Eddy Butler noted that at a 1986 party rally in Dewsbury, Tyndall &quot;lost them completely. He knew how to talk to a small room of nationalists, but he didn&#x27;t know how to talk to a thousand Yorkshire young geezers. He hadn&#x27;t got a clue about normal people or normal politics. He&#x27;d go on about the Britain of Sir Francis Drake; you&#x27;d think &#x27;what&#x27;s he on about?

Walker described Tyndall as being &quot;very close to his mother&quot;, with whom he lived until 1977. On 19 November 1977, he married Valerie Dawn Olliff, a divorcée and fellow right-wing activist. The couple had a daughter named Marina. Valerie died on 24 June 2011 in Hove.

==Reception==
Walker noted that during the 1960s, Tyndall was &quot;well known&quot; yet &quot;unpopular within Nationalist circles because of his arrogance, his overbearing personal manner and the way he brought the authoritarianism of his politics into his personal life&quot;. In contrast, Fielding noted that within the NF of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tyndall&#x27;s standing among &quot;ordinary members&quot; was &quot;very high&quot;, with some of them even chanting his name during his speeches. At Tyndall&#x27;s death, the anti-fascist activist Nick Lowles stated that Tyndall had been &quot;someone that the more hardline nationalists&quot; in the BNP &quot;have always looked up to and rallied around&quot; and that he &quot;still had a lot of support&quot; in the party, particularly in the North West and parts of south London. Despite his standing within the British far-right, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; noted that Tyndall&#x27;s devotion to neo-Nazism &quot;prevented his cause from acquiring the slightest veneer of political respectability.&quot;

<text>Radiological warfare is any form of warfare involving deliberate radiation poisoning or contamination of an area with radiological sources.

Radiological weapons are normally classified as weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), although radiological weapons can also be specific in whom they target, such as the radiation poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko by the Russian FSB, using radioactive polonium-210.

Numerous countries have expressed an interest in radiological weapons programs, several have actively pursued them, and three have performed radiological weapons tests.

== Salted nuclear weapons ==
A salted bomb is a nuclear weapon that is equipped with a large quantity of radiologically inert salting material. The radiological warfare agents are produced through neutron capture by the salting materials of the neutron radiation emitted by the nuclear weapon. This avoids the problems of having to stockpile the highly radioactive material, as it is produced when the bomb explodes. The result is a more intense fallout than from regular nuclear weapons and can render an area uninhabitable for a long period.

The cobalt bomb is an example of a radiological warfare weapon, where cobalt-59 is converted to cobalt-60 by neutron capture. Initially, gamma radiation of the nuclear fission products from an equivalent sized &quot;clean&quot; fission-fusion-fission bomb (assuming the amount of radioactive dust particles generated are equal) are much more intense than cobalt-60: 15,000 times more intense at 1 hour; 35 times more intense at 1 week; 5 times more intense at 1 month; and about equal at 6 months. Thereafter fission drops off rapidly so that cobalt-60 fallout is 8 times more intense than fission at 1 year and 150 times more intense at 5 years. The very long-lived isotopes produced by fission would overtake the cobalt-60 again after about 75 years.

Other salted bomb variants that do not use cobalt have also been theorized. For example, salting with sodium-23, that transmutes to sodium-24, which because of its 15-hour half-life results in intense radiation.

== Surface-burst nuclear weapons ==
An air burst is preferred if the effects of thermal radiation and blast wave is to be maximized for an area (i.e. area covered by direct line of sight and sufficient luminosity to cause burning, and formation of mach stem respectively). Both fission and fusion weapons will irradiate the detonation site with neutron radiation, causing neutron activation of the material there. Fission bombs will also contribute with the bomb-material residue. Air will not form isotopes useful for radiological warfare when neutron-activated. By detonating them at or near the surface instead, the ground will be vaporized, become radioactive, and when it cools down and condenses into particles cause significant fallout.

== Dirty bombs ==

A far lower-tech radiological weapon than those discussed above is a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; or &quot;radiological dispersal device&quot;, whose purpose is to disperse radioactive dust over an area. The release of radioactive material may involve no special &quot;weapon&quot; or side forces like a blast explosion and include no direct killing of people from its radiation source, but rather could make whole areas or structures unusable or unfavorable for the support of human life. The radioactive material may be dispersed slowly over a large area, and it can be difficult for the victims to initially know that such a radiological attack is being carried out, especially if detectors for radioactivity are not installed beforehand.

Radiological warfare with dirty bombs could be used for nuclear terrorism, spreading or intensifying fear. In relation to these weapons, nation states can also spread rumor, disinformation and fear.

In July 2023, both Ukraine and Russia blamed each other for preparing to bomb the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, in order to use the nuclear reactors as dirty bombs.

<text>The governor of New France was the viceroy of the King of France in North America. A French nobleman, he was appointed to govern the colonies of New France, which included Canada, Acadia and Louisiana. The residence of the Governor was at the Chateau St. Louis in the capital of Quebec City. Acadia, Louisiana, and the towns of Trois-Rivières and Montreal had their own particular governors.

Prior to the establishment of the 1663 Sovereign Council, the highest positions in New France were that of Governor and Lieutenant-General, which were often held by the same person. The Governor then had responsibilities over both military and civil affairs in the colonies.

With the new royal administration of 1663, the title of governor general was given to the person responsible for the military and diplomatic relations. The duties of administration of justice, police and finance were given to the Intendant, who presided over the Sovereign Council. The Governor General answered to the French Secretary of State of the Navy and the Controller General of Finance.

Beginning with Charles de Montmagny, First Nations referred to the Governor as Onontio, meaning &#x27;Great Mountain&#x27;. Each Onontio was the head of the Franco-Indian alliance.

<doc id="325001" wikidata="Q5079809" url="?curid=325001" title="Charles Kingsmill">
<text>Admiral Sir Charles Edmund Kingsmill, (7 July 1855 – 15 July 1935) was a Canadian-born naval officer and the first director of the Department of the Naval Service of Canada. After retiring from a career in the Royal Navy, he played a prominent role in the establishment of the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) in 1910. Along with Rear-Admiral Walter Hose, he is considered the father of the Royal Canadian Navy.

==Early life an education==

Kingsmill was born at Guelph, Canada West (now Ontario) in 1855. He was the son of John Juchereau Kingsmill, Crown Attorney for Wellington County, and Ellen Diana Grange. He was educated at Upper Canada College in Toronto.

==Royal Navy career==

In 1870, at age 14, Kingsmill joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman. He was promoted sub-lieutenant in 1875, lieutenant in 1877, commander in 1891, and captain in 1898. During his career in the Royal Navy, he commanded HM Ships (1890–1891), (1895), (1895–1898), (1900), (1900–1903), &quot;Resolution&quot;, &quot;Majestic&quot; (1905–1906), and .

&quot;Mildura&quot; served on the Australia Station in these years. During Kingsmill&#x27;s command of the ship, she was part of the naval escort for the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary) to New Zealand aboard the chartered Royal liner HMS &quot;Ophir&quot; during 1901. The following year, he was with (flagship) and , visiting Norfolk Island in July, Suva, Fiji in August, and Tonga in September.

Kingsmill was given command of the battleship &quot;Dominion&quot; after her launching in 1905. &quot;Dominion&quot; ran aground in Chaleur Bay on 16 or 19 August 1906, while on a good-will tour of the Canadian Atlantic coast. In his March 1907 court-martial, Kingsmill was severely reprimanded for &quot;grave neglect of duty&quot; (not being on the bridge at the time) and given command of the older battleship .

==Royal Canadian Navy==

In 1908, Kingsmill retired from the Royal Navy and returned to Canada. He was appointed honorary aide-de-camp to His Excellency the Governor-General in 1909. At the behest of then prime minister Wilfrid Laurier, he accepted the post of director of the Marine Service in the Department of Marine and Fisheries under then Minister of Marine and Fisheries Louis-Philippe Brodeur. The appointment predetermined his eventual appointment as rear-admiral RCN and director of the Naval Service of Canada upon the formation of the RCN on 4 May 1910. By 1914, at the beginning of World War I, the new navy&#x27;s fleet consisted of two old cruisers and a collection of converted civilian and commercial vessels.

Kingsmill was promoted to admiral on the Royal Navy&#x27;s retired list in 1917. He was made a knight bachelor in 1918. He was awarded for outstanding services as the Director of Naval Services of Canada 1910–1921.

Kingsmill retired on 31 December 1921. He maintained a summer home on Grindstone Island, in Big Rideau Lake, near Portland, Ontario, where he loved to sail. His guests included the Duke of Devonshire, Governor General of Canada from 1916 to 1921; Sir William MacKenzie, railway entrepreneur; and Neville Chamberlain, later Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1937–1940. When he died at Grindstone Island on 15 July 1935, a &quot;huge flotilla of boats brought him in from the island&quot;

Kingsmill is buried in the Anglican cemetery in Portland, where an Ontario Heritage Trust plaque commemorates his contribution to Canadian naval history.

==Family==

Kingsmill and his wife, Constance, were prominent figures in Ottawa&#x27;s social life. She was active in various causes, including as a supporter of birth control. They lived in a large stone house which they named &quot;Ballybeg&quot; on Crescent Road in Rockcliffe, which was designed for them during World War I by Montreal architect H. C. Stone. When the house was built, Rockcliffe was outside city limits, and raising chickens and cattle was permitted. Since 1970, the house has been occupied by Tunisia&#x27;s ambassadors to Canada.

Kingsmill&#x27;s cousin, Colonel Walter Bernard Kingsmill, the son of Admiral Kingsmill&#x27;s uncle, Nicol Kingsmill, was head of the 10th Royal Grenadiers and led the 123rd Battalion on the front lines in France during the First World War.

Kingsmill&#x27;s daughter Diana was an Olympic athlete and journalist, who married historian J. F. C. Wright.

==Legacy==

Kingsmill House is named for him. The junior officer quarters building at Venture NOTC, the Canadian Naval Officer Training Centre, is named after him.

<doc id="325006" wikidata="Q312825" url="?curid=325006" title="Henryk Szeryng">
<text>Henryk Bolesław Szeryng (usually pronounced &quot;-r-ik -r-in-g&quot;) (22 September 19183 March 1988) was a Polish-Mexican violinist.

== Early years ==
He was born in Warsaw, Poland on 22 September 1918 into a wealthy Jewish family. The surname &quot;Szeryng&quot; is a Polish transliteration of his Yiddish surname, which nowadays would be spelled &quot;Shering&quot; in the modern Yiddish-to-English transliteration.

Szeryng started piano and harmony lessons with his mother when he was 5, and at age 7 turned to the violin, receiving instruction from Maurice Frenkel. After studies with Carl Flesch in Berlin (1929–1932), he went to Paris to continue his studies with Jacques Thibaud at the Conservatory, graduating with a premier prix in 1937.

==Career==
He made his solo debut on 6 January 1933 playing the Brahms Violin Concerto with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra under Romanian conductor George Georgescu. From 1933 to 1939 he studied composition in Paris with Nadia Boulanger.

When World War II broke out, Władysław Sikorski, the premier of the Polish government in exile, asked Szeryng, who was fluent in seven languages, to serve as his liaison officer and interpreter. Szeryng took these positions and discontinued his studies, although he continued to perform on the violin, giving over 300 concerts for Allied troops all over the world. When he accompanied Sikorski on a mission to Mexico in 1941 seeking a home for 4,000 Polish refugees, the positive reception moved Szeryng so deeply that he decided to become a Mexican naturalized citizen, and did so in 1946. In 1945 he accepted the request (made in 1943) that he head the string department of National University of Mexico.

In 1954, the pianist Arthur Rubinstein, also a Jewish refugee from Poland, gave a concert in Mexico City; Szeryng visited him backstage afterwards, and accepted Rubinstein&#x27;s invitation to come to his hotel to play music. Szeryng&#x27;s playing of solo violin music of Johann Sebastian Bach that night, said Rubinstein, &quot;reduced me to tears...Real music lovers want emotion—great moments—which Szeryng&#x27;s playing gives them.&quot; Rubinstein encouraged Szeryng to begin concertizing again, and introduced him to impresario Sol Hurok to help achieve this end. Rubinstein and Szeryng made music together regularly for the rest of their careers, and recorded much of the classic chamber music literature either as a duo or in a trio with cellist Pierre Fournier. Szeryng went on to win such major awards as six Grand prix du Disque awards, the Médaille d&#x27;Argent of the city of Paris, two Edison Awards, and was also made an Officer of the Ordre des Arts et Lettres in Paris in 1963, among many other honors received. In 1964 he began a collaborative partnership with the pianist Charles Reiner. Together they made 35 records and performed in more than 900 concerts internationally.

In 1960, Szeryng was named Mexican Cultural Ambassador. In 1966, by which time he had moved to Paris, he was designated Honorary Director of the Conservatory of Music in Mexico City, and a Henryk Szeryng Music Festival was held in his honor in Mexico City. He returned to Mexico twice a year and traveled on a diplomatic passport as Mexico&#x27;s official cultural ambassador, but lived in Paris for two decades, then spent his last five years in Monaco. In 1970, Szeryng recorded Mozart&#x27;s complete works for violin and orchestra for Philips Records, which was used as Volume 8 of The Complete Mozart Edition in 1991.

Szeryng died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Kassel, Germany, on 3 March 1988. He was buried at Cimetière de Monaco, the headstone bearing the concluding bars of the Ciaconna from Bach&#x27;s Partita No.2 for solo violin.

==Notable recordings==
Szeryng made a number of recordings, including two complete cycles of sonatas and partitas for violin by Johann Sebastian Bach, and several sonatas by Beethoven and Brahms with Arthur Rubinstein. He was also the first violinist in history to record Niccolo Paganini&#x27;s then newly discovered 3rd violin concerto. His recordings of Mozart and Beethoven piano and violin sonatas with Ingrid Haebler are widely esteemed. A 1960 released vinyl featured Szeryng, with Charles Munch conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra, performing Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Violin Concerto in D.

Throughout World War II, he appeared in some 300 concerts for the Allies. After the war, he pursued a brilliant international career; was also active as a teacher. In 1970 he was made Mexico&#x27;s special adviser to UNESCO in Paris. He celebrated the 50th anniversary of his debut with a grand tour of Europe and the U.S. in 1983.&quot;

Henryk Szeryng told me that he was born in Zelazowa Wola, near Warsaw.
He presented the Hercules Stradivarius (formerly belonging to Ysaye) to the
City of Jerusalem, then Mayor was Teddy Kollek, to be played on by the
concertmaster of The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. His wish continues to

<doc id="325008" wikidata="Q932821" url="?curid=325008" title="Civil Guard (Spain)">
<text>The Civil Guard (; ) is one of the two national law enforcement agencies of Spain. As a national gendarmerie, it is military in nature and is responsible for civil policing under the authority of both the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence. The role of the Ministry of Defence is limited except in times of war when the Ministry has exclusive authority. The corps is colloquially known as the &quot;&quot; (the meritorious or the reputables). In annual surveys, it generally ranks as the national institution most valued by Spaniards, closely followed by other law enforcement agencies and the armed forces.

It has both a regular national role and undertakes specific foreign peacekeeping missions and is part of the European Gendarmerie Force. As a national gendarmerie force, the Civil Guard was modelled on the French National Gendarmerie and has many similarities.

As part of its daily duties, the Civil Guard patrols and investigates crimes in rural areas, including highways and ports, whilst the National Police deals with safety in urban situations. Most cities also have a Municipal Police Force. The three forces are nationally co-ordinated by the Ministry of the Interior. The Civil Guard is usually stationed at , which are both minor residential garrisons and fully-equipped police stations.

==History==
===Origin===
The was founded as a national police force in 1844 during the reign of Queen Isabel II of Spain by the 2nd Duke of Ahumada and 5th Marquess of Amarillas, an 11th generation descendant of Aztec emperor Moctezuma II. Previously, law enforcement had been the responsibility of the &quot;Holy Brotherhood&quot;, an organization of municipal leagues. Corruption was pervasive in the Brotherhood, where officials were constantly subject to local political influence, and the system was largely ineffective outside the major towns and cities. Criminals could often escape justice by simply moving from one district to another. The first police academy was established in the town of Valdemoro, south of Madrid, in 1855. Graduates were given the Guardia&#x27;s now famous &quot;tricorne&quot; or &quot;Cavaliers&quot; hat as part of their duty dress uniform.
 
The was initially charged with putting an end to brigandage on the nation&#x27;s highways, particularly in Andalusia, which had become notorious for numerous robberies and holdups of businessmen, peddlers, travelers, and even foreign tourists. Banditry in this region was so endemic that the found it difficult to eradicate it completely. As late as 1884, one traveler of the day reported that it still existed in and around the city of Málaga:
The favorite and original method of the Malagueño highwayman is to creep up quietly behind his victim, muffle his head and arms in a cloak, and then relieve him of his valuables. Should he resist, he is instantly disembowelled with the dexterous thrust of a knife...[The Spanish highwayman] wears a profusion of amulets and charms...all of undoubted efficacy against the dagger of an adversary or the rifle of a Civil Guard.
The was also given the political task of restoring and maintaining land ownership and servitude among the peasantry of Spain by the King, who desired to stop the spread of anti-monarchist movements inspired by the French Revolution. The end of the First Carlist War combined with the unequal distribution of land that resulted from prime minister Juan Álvarez Mendizábal&#x27;s first Desamortización (1836–1837) had left the Spanish landscape scarred by the destruction of civil war and social unrest, and the government was forced to take drastic action to suppress spontaneous revolts by a restive peasantry. Based on the model of light infantry used by Napoléon in his European campaigns, the was transformed into a military force of high mobility that could be deployed irrespective of inhospitable conditions, able to patrol and pacify large areas of the countryside. Its members, called &quot;, maintain to this day a basic patrol unit formed by two agents, usually called a &quot;&quot; (a pair), in which one of the &quot; will initiate the intervention while the second &quot; serves as a backup to the first.
Under the pre-1931 monarchy, relations between and the Civil Guard were particularly tense.

===The Civil War (1936–1939)===
During the Spanish Civil War, the forces split almost evenly between those who remained loyal to the Republic, 53% of the members (which changed their name to – &quot;Republican National Guard&quot;) and the rebel forces. However, the highest authority of the corps, Inspector General Sebastián Pozas, remained loyal to the republican government. Their contribution to the Republican war efforts were invaluable, but proved effective on both sides in urban combat.

The proportion of members that supported the rebel faction at the time of the 1936 coup was relatively high compared to other Spanish police corps such as the and the &quot;Carabineros&quot; (), where when the Civil War began over 70% of their members stayed loyal to the Spanish Republic.

Loyalist General of the José Aranguren, commander of the 4th Organic Division and Military Governor of Valencia, was arrested by the victorious Francoist troops when they entered the city of Valencia at the end of March 1939. After being court-martialed, Aranguren was given the death penalty and was executed on 22 April in the same year.

===Colonial service===
Locally recruited units of the were employed in Spain&#x27;s overseas territories. These included three (regiments) in the Philippines and two companies in Puerto Rico prior to 1898. Over six thousand Civil Guards, both indigenous and Spanish, were serving in Cuba in 1885 and smaller units were subsequently raised in Ifni and Spanish Guinea.

===During Francoist era (1939–1975) and attempted coup d&#x27;état 1981===
Following the Civil War, under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco (1939–1975), the was reinforced with the members of the &quot;Carabineros&quot;, the &quot;Royal Corps of Coast and Frontier Carabiniers&quot;, following the disbandment of the carabinier corps.

Critics of the have alleged numerous instances of police brutality because of the organisation&#x27;s association with Franco&#x27;s regime. The fact that the largely operated in mostly rural and isolated parts of the country increased the risk of police violations of individual civil rights through lack of supervision and accountability. García Lorca&#x27;s poems have contributed to the &#x27;s reputation as, at least at the time, a heavy-handed police force.

The involvement of figures in politics continued right up until the end of the twentieth century: on 23 February 1981, Lt. Col. Antonio Tejero Molina, a member of the , participated with other military forces in the failed 23-F coup d&#x27;état. Along with 200 members of the , he briefly took hold of the lower house of the before the coup collapsed following a nationally televised address by King Juan Carlos, who denounced the coup.

==Modern force==
The as a police force, has had additional tasks given to it in addition to its traditional role.

It is the largest police force in Spain, in terms of area served. Today, they are primarily responsible for policing and/or safety regarding the following (but not limited to) areas and/or safety related issues (given in no special order):

==Peacekeeping and other operations==
The has been involved in operations as peacekeepers in United Nations sponsored operations, including operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Angola, Congo, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Haiti, East Timor and El Salvador. They also served with the Spanish armed forces contingent in the war in Iraq, mainly as military police but also in intelligence gathering, where seven of its members were killed.

In the Afghan war effort the rapid reaction branch of the ; the (GAR) were deployed to the Kabul area in 2002 shortly after the invasion and served as the protective team for the High Representative of the European Union. They maintained their services until 2008. In that period, the (Traffic Group), (Customs and Revenue Service), (Judicial Police), and (Public Order and Prevention service) have also had their deployments to Afghanistan for the peacekeeping efforts.

After 2009, the mission of the Civil Guards in Afghanistan shifted focus to training up local security forces in the country. In that period, the counter-terrorism branch of the ; the (UAR) were deployed to Afghanistan to train the Afghan National Police as part of ISAF&#x27;s Police Advisor Team (PAT) formerly the Police Operative Mentoring and Liaison Team (POMLT) 

In addition to (&quot;the armed institution&quot;), the is known as (&quot;the well-remembered&quot;). They served in the Spanish colonies, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Spanish Guinea and Spanish Morocco.

The has a sister force in Costa Rica also called the . The Costa Rican &#x27;guardias&#x27; often train at the same academy as regular Spanish officers.

==Characteristics==

*Members of the &quot;Guardia&quot; typically patrol in pairs.
*Members of the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot; often live in garrisons () with their families.
*Since the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot; must accommodate the families of its &quot;guardias&quot;, it was the first police force in Europe that accommodated a same-sex partner in a military installation.
*The symbol of the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot; consists of the Royal Crown of Spain, a sword and a fasces. The different units have variations of this symbol.
*The sidearm of the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot; from the 1970s to the early 1990s was the Star Model BM chambered in 9mm until its replacement with the Beretta 92, and in recent years the Beretta has been replaced with the H&amp;K USP.

===Traditions===

====Hymn====
The first hymn was composed between 1915 and 1916 by Asunción García Sierra (who wrote the lyrics) and Ildefonso Moreno Carrilllo (who composed the music) as a school hymn. In the 1920s, Lieutenant Colonel José Osuna Pineda was assigned to the center as Head of Studies and arranged the original text and melody. This hymn was that of the College of Young Guardsmen, adopted as the school&#x27;s alma mater march since December 1922. Despite the absence of any legal provision, the hymn became official upon its use.

====Motto====
The motto of the Civil Guard is &quot;Honor is my badge&quot;. It comes from article 1 of the &quot;Cartilla del Guardia Civil&quot;, written by the Duke of Ahumada in 1845. The full text says: &quot;Honor is the main badge of the Civil Guard; it must, therefore, be kept spotless. Once lost, it is never recovered&quot;.

====Music Unit====
The Music Unit of the Civil Guard () is the military band of the Civil Guard and is one of multiple in the Armed Forces. It is officially part of the guard&#x27;s General Directorate. Since its creation in 1844, it has had musical infantry and cavalry formations through various ranks. Only the Civil Guard and the Royal Guard, as well as many Army cavalry and artillery units retained mounted bands with cavalry trumpeters at the time while the infantry of both the Army and Civil Guard had bugle bands then (formerly corps of drums composed of drummers and fifers). It was not until 19 November 1859 when a unified band appeared for the first time. Other bands would be formed throughout the years in both Madrid and Valdemoro. In 1940, the first squads of Civil Guard musicians were officially approved and applications to join the official Civil Guard band were released in October 1941. In 1949, and as a consequence of the merger of the Carabineros Corps and the Civil Guard, their respective Music bands were also unified. These templates remained that way for over two decades when they were increased to adapt them to those of Army Music, forming two bands: one with 75 musicians attached to the General Directorate of the Corps and with 50 instrumentalists belonging to the Jefatura de Enseñanza. More recently, according to the resolutions of 28 June 2004 and 14 February 2006, the two music units were unified, constituting the current band which reports to the General Subdirectorate of Personnel and is administratively attached to the General Affairs Service.

A small mounted band is in service with the Security Group&#x27;s Civil Guard Cavalry Squadron, with its barracks and stables in Valdemoro, administratively under the supervision of the Young Guardsmen&#x27;s College. Unlike other mounted bands, they only use small fanfare trumpets ( and ). They continue the traditions of the Civil Guard cavalry since its foundation. In 2022 the Mounted Band of the Civil Guard Cavalry Squadron finally received its own kettledrummer, bringing it in line with the Royal Guard&#x27;s Mounted Band of the Royal Escort Squadron.

====Tricorn====
The element of uniformity that characterizes the Civil Guard is the tricorn, which is the official service&#x27;s headgear in full and service dress uniforms. Other pieces of headgear such as peaked caps, berets or garrison caps are currently used in addition to this one. Throughout its history, other headwear of various types, colors and shapes have been used, including the Teresiana Kepi. Officially, it is known by the Civil Guard as the &quot;black hat&quot;.

====Patronage====
On 8 February 1913, Our Lady of the Pillar was declared by royal decree as the guard&#x27;s exalted patron saint.

==Uniforms==

A wide range of clothing is currently worn according to the nature of the duties being performed (see schematic diagrams below).

The traditional headdress of the is the hat, originally a tricorne. Its use now is reserved for ceremonial parades and duty outside public buildings, together with the army-style tunic and trousers previously worn. For other occasions a cap or a beret is worn.

The historic blue, white and red uniform of the is now retained only for the Civil Guard Company of the Royal Guard and the (parade markers) of the Civil Guard Academy.

A modernised new style of working uniform was announced for the Civil Guard in 2011, for general adoption during 2012. This comprises a green baseball cap, polo shirt and cargo pants. The kepi-like &quot;gorra teresiana&quot; was abolished.

==Notes==
The Guardia Civil has some training and supervision responsibilities for essentially private security services with similar names:
* Guardas Rurales (country estates and nature reserves)
* Guardas de Caza (hunting grounds and game reserves)
* Guardapescas Marítimos (fish farms and shellfish reserves)
The Guàrdia Urbana de Barcelona is not part of the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot;.

<text>A valve amplifier or tube amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that uses vacuum tubes to increase the amplitude or power of a signal. Low to medium power valve amplifiers for frequencies below the microwaves were largely replaced by solid state amplifiers in the 1960s and 1970s.
Valve amplifiers can be used for applications such as guitar amplifiers, satellite transponders such as DirecTV and GPS, high quality stereo amplifiers, military applications (such as radar) and very high power radio and UHF television transmitters.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Until the invention of the transistor in 1947, most practical high-frequency electronic amplifiers were made using thermionic valves. The simplest valve (named diode because it had two electrodes) was invented by John Ambrose Fleming while working for the Marconi Company in London in 1904. The diode conducted electricity in one direction only and was used as a radio detector and a rectifier.

In 1906 Lee De Forest added a third electrode and invented the first electronic amplifying device, the triode, which he named the &quot;Audion&quot;. This additional &quot;control grid&quot; modulates the current that flows between cathode and anode. The relationship between current flow and plate and grid voltage is often represented as a series of &quot;characteristic curves&quot; on a diagram. Depending on the other components in the circuit this modulated current flow can be used to provide current or voltage gain.

The first application of valve amplification was in the regeneration of long distance telephony signals. Later, valve amplification was applied to the &#x27;wireless&#x27; market that began in the early thirties. In due course amplifiers for music and later television were also built using valves.
The overwhelmingly dominant circuit topology during this period was the single-ended triode gain stage, operating in class A, which gave very good sound (and reasonable measured distortion performance) despite extremely simple circuitry with very few components: important at a time when components were handmade and extremely expensive. Before World War II, almost all valve amplifiers were of low gain and with linearity dependent entirely on the inherent linearity of the valve itself, typically 5% distortion at full power.

Negative feedback (NFB) was invented by Harold Stephen Black in 1927, but initially little used since at that time gain was at a premium. This technique allows amplifiers to trade gain for reduced distortion levels (and also gave other benefits such as reduced output impedance). The introduction of the Williamson amplifier in 1947, which was extremely advanced in many respects including very successful use of NFB, was a turning point in audio power amplifier design, operating a push-pull output circuit in class AB1 to give performance surpassing its contemporaries.

=== Post-war developments ===
World War II stimulated dramatic technical progress and industrial scale production economies. Increasing affluence after the war led to a substantial and expanding consumer market. This enabled electronics manufacturers to build and market more advanced valve (tube) designs at affordable prices, with the result that the 1960s saw the increasing spread of electronic gramophone players, and ultimately the beginnings of &quot;high fidelity&quot;. Hifi was able to drive full frequency range loudspeakers (for the first time, often with multiple drivers for different frequency bands) to significant volume levels. This, combined with the spread of TV, produced a &#x27;golden age&#x27; in valve (tube) development and also in the development of the design of valve amplifier circuits.

A range of topologies with only minor variations (notably different phase splitter arrangements and the &quot;Ultra-Linear&quot; transformer connection for tetrodes) rapidly became widespread. This family of designs remains the dominant high power amplifier topology to this day for music application. This period also saw continued growth in civilian radio, with valves being used for both transmitters and receivers.

===Decline===
From the 1970s the silicon transistor became increasingly pervasive. Valve production was sharply decreased, with the notable exception of cathode-ray tubes (CRTs), and a reduced range of valves for amplifier applications. Popular low power tubes were dual triodes (ECCnn, 12Ax7 series) plus the EF86 pentode, and power valves were mostly being beam tetrode and pentodes (EL84, EL34, KT88 / 6550, 6L6), in both cases with indirect heating. This reduced set of types remains the core of valve production today.

The Soviets retained valves to a much greater extent than the West during the Cold War, for the majority of their communications and military amplification requirements, in part due to valves&#x27; ability to withstand instantaneous overloads (notably due to a nuclear detonation) that would destroy a transistor.

The dramatic reduction in size, power consumption, reduced distortion levels and above all cost of electronics products based on transistors has made valves obsolete for mainstream products since the 1970s. Valves remained in certain applications such as high power RF transmitters and the microwave oven, and audio amplification equipment, particularly for the electric guitar, recording studios, and high-end home stereos.

===Audio usage ===

In audio applications, valves continue to be highly desired by most professional users, particularly in recording studios&#x27; equipment and guitar amplifiers. There is a subgroup of audio enthusiasts who advocate the use of tube amplifiers for home listening. They argue that tube amplifiers produce a &quot;warmer&quot; or more &quot;natural&quot; valve sound. Companies in Asia and Eastern Europe continue to produce valves to cater to this market.

Many professional guitar players use &#x27;tube amps&#x27; because of their renowned &#x27;tone&#x27;. &#x27;Tone&#x27; in this usage is referring to timbre, or pitch color, and can be a very subjective quality to quantify. Most audio technicians and scientists theorize that the &#x27;even harmonic distortion&#x27; produced by valve tubes sounds more pleasing to the ear than transistors, regardless of style. It is the tonal characteristics of valve tubes that have sustained them as the industry standard for guitars and studio microphone pre-amplification.

Tube amplifiers respond differently from transistor amplifiers when signal levels approach and reach the point of clipping. In a tube amplifier, the transition from linear amplification to limiting is less abrupt than in a solid state unit, resulting in a less grating form of distortion at the onset of clipping. For this reason, some guitarists prefer the sound of an all-tube amplifier; the aesthetic properties of tube versus solid state amps, though, are a topic of debate in the guitarist community.

== Characteristics ==

Power valves typically operate at higher voltages and lower currents than transistors - although solid state operating voltages have steadily increased with modern device technologies. High power radio transmitters in use today operate in the kilovolt range, where there is still no other comparable technology available. ([power = voltage × current], so high power requires high voltage, high current, or both)

Many power valves have good linearity but modest gain or transconductance. Signal amplifiers using tubes are capable of very high frequency response ranges – up to radio frequency and many of the directly heated single-ended triode (DH-SET) audio amplifiers use radio transmitting tubes designed to operate in the megahertz range. In practice, however, tube amplifier designs typically &quot;couple&quot; stages either capacitively, limiting bandwidth at the low end, or inductively with transformers, limiting the bandwidth at both ends.

===Advantages ===

*Inherently suitable for high voltage circuits.
*Can be constructed on a scale that can dissipate large amounts of heat (some extreme devices even being water-cooled). For this reason valves remained the only viable technology for very high power applications such as radio and TV transmitters long into the age when transistors had displaced valves in most other applications.
*Electrically very robust, they can tolerate overloads for minutes, which would destroy bipolar transistor systems in milliseconds.
*Withstand very high transient peak voltages without damage, suiting them to certain military and industrial applications.
*Generally operate at applied voltages well below their maximum capability, providing long life and reliability.
*Softer clipping when overloading the circuit, which many audiophiles and musicians subjectively believe gives a more pleasant and more musically satisfying sound.

===Disadvantages ===

*Bad linearity, especially with modest feedback factors.
*Tubes require a cathode heater. Heater power represents a significant heat loss and energy use. 
*Tubes require higher voltages for the anodes compared to solid state amplifiers of similar power rating.
*Tubes are significantly larger than equivalent solid-state devices.
*High impedance and low current output is unsuitable for the direct drive of many real-world loads, notably various forms of electric motors.
*Valves have a shorter working life than solid state parts due to various failure mechanisms (such as heat, cathode poisoning, breakage, or internal short-circuits).
*Tubes are available in only a single polarity, whereas transistors are available in complementary polarities (e.g., NPN/PNP), making possible many circuit configurations that cannot be realized directly.
*Valve circuits must avoid introduction of noise from AC heater supplies.
*Microphonics – valves may sometimes be sensitive to sound or vibration, inadvertently acting like a microphone.

==Operation==
All amplifier circuits are classified by &quot;class of operation&quot; as A, B, AB and C etc. See power amplifier classes. Some significantly different circuit topologies exist compared to transistor designs.

*The grid (where the input signal is presented) needs to be biased substantially negative with respect to the cathode. This makes it extremely difficult to directly couple the output of one valve to the input of a following valve as is normally done in transistor designs.
*Valve stages are coupled with components rated to withstand several hundred volts, typically a capacitor, occasionally a coupling transformer. The phase shifts introduced by coupling networks can become problematic in circuits that have feedback.
*There is no valve analog of the complementary devices widely used in &quot;totem pole&quot; output stages of silicon circuits. Push-pull valve topologies therefore require a phase splitter.
*The very high output impedance of valves (compared with transistors) usually requires matching transformers to drive low impedance loads such as loudspeakers or cutting lathe heads. The transformer is used as the load, in place of the resistor usually used in small-signal and driver stages. The reflected impedance of the transformer primary at the frequencies in use is much higher than the DC resistance of the windings, often kilohms. High performance transformers are, however, severe engineering compromises, are expensive and, in operation, are far from ideal. Output transformers dramatically increase the cost of a valve amplifier circuit compared to a direct-coupled transistor alternative. However, in both tube and solid state amps, matching output transformers are required for public address applications where low-loss high impedance/high voltage lines are used to connect multiple distant loudspeakers.
*The open loop linearity of valves, especially triodes, makes it possible to use little or no negative feedback in circuits whilst retaining acceptable or even excellent distortion performance (especially for small-signal circuits).

===Topologies===
*Linear small signal circuits almost invariably use a triode in the single ended gain stage topology (in class A), including the output stage.
*Broadband valve amplifiers typically use class A1 or AB1.
*Modern high power output stages are usually push pull, often necessitating some form of phase splitter to derive a differential/balanced drive signal from a single ended input, typically followed by a further gain stage (the &quot;driver&quot;) prior to the output tubes. For example, a shunt regulated push-pull amplifier)
*single ended power stages using very large valves exist and dominate in radio transmitter applications. A sidebar is the observation that the niche &quot;DH-SET&quot; topology favored by some audiophiles are extremely simple and typically constructed using valve types originally designed for use in radio transmitters
*more complex topologies (notably the use of active loads) can improve linearity and frequency response (by removing Miller capacitance effects).

===Output impedance===
The high output impedance of tube plate circuits is not well matched to low-impedance loads such as loudspeakers or antennas. A matching network is required for efficient power transfer; this may be a transformer at audio frequencies, or various tuned networks at radio frequencies.

In a &quot;cathode follower&quot; or &quot;common-plate&quot; configuration, the output is taken from the cathode resistance. Because of negative feedback (the cathode-ground voltage cancels the grid-ground voltage) the voltage gain is close to unity and the output voltage &quot;follows&quot; the grid voltage. Although the cathode resistor can be many kilohms (depending on biasing requirements), the small-signal output impedance is very low (see operational amplifier).

==Applications==

=== Audio frequency (AF) and broadband amplifiers ===
Valves remain in widespread use in guitar and high-end audio amplifiers due to the perceived sound quality they produce. They are largely obsolete elsewhere because of higher power consumption, distortion, costs, reliability, and weight in comparison to transistors.

====Telephony====
Telephony was the original application for audio amplification, and remained as the main usage for many years. A specific issue for the telecommunication industry was the technique of multiplexing many (up to a thousand) voice lines onto a single cable, at different frequencies. A single valve &quot;repeater&quot; amplifier can amplify many calls at once, and was thus very cost effective.

The problem is that the amplifiers need to be extremely linear, otherwise &quot;intermodulation distortion&quot; (IMD) will result in &quot;crosstalk&quot; between the multiplexed channels. This stimulated development emphasis towards low distortion far beyond the nominal needs of a single voice channel.

====Audio====
Today, the main application for valves is audio amplifiers for high-end hi-fi and musical performance use with electric guitars, electric basses, and Hammond organs, although these applications have different requirements regarding distortion which result in different design compromises, although the same basic design techniques are generic and widely applicable to all broadband amplification applications, not only audio.

Post World War II, the majority of valve power amplifiers are of the Class AB-1 &quot;push pull&quot; ultralinear topology, or lower cost single ended i.e. 6BQ5/EL84 power tubes, but niche products using the DH-SET and even output transformer-less topologies still exist in small numbers.


==== Instrumentation amplifiers ====

The basic moving coil voltmeter and ammeter itself takes a small current and thus loads the circuit to which it is attached. This can significantly alter the operating conditions in the circuit being measured. The vacuum tube voltmeter (VTVM) uses the high input impedance of a valve to buffer the circuit being measured from the load of the ammeter.

Valve oscilloscopes share this very high input impedance and thus can be used to measure voltages even in very high impedance circuits. There may typically be 3 or 4 stages of amplification per display channel. In later oscilloscopes, a type of amplifier using a series of tubes connected at equal distances along transmission lines, known as a distributed amplifier was employed to amplify very high frequency vertical signals before application to the display tube. Valve oscilloscopes are now obsolete.

In the closing years of the valve era, valves were even used to make &quot;operational amplifiers&quot; – the building blocks of much modern linear electronics. An op-amp typically has a differential input stage and a totem pole output, the circuit usually having a minimum of five active devices. A number of &quot;packages&quot; were produced that integrated such circuits (typically using two or more glass envelopes) into a single module that could be plugged into a larger circuit (such as an analog computer). Such valve op-amps were very far from ideal and quickly became obsolete, being replaced with solid-state types.

=== Narrow band and radio frequency tuned amplifiers ===
Historically, pre-WWII &quot;transmitting tubes&quot; were among the most powerful tubes available. These usually had directly heated thoriated filament cathodes that glowed like light bulbs. Some tubes were capable of being driven so hard that the anode itself would glow cherry red; the anodes were machined from solid material (rather than fabricated from thin sheet) to withstand heat without distorting. Notable tubes of this type are the 845 and 211. Later tetrodes and pentodes such as 817 and (direct heated) 813 were also used in large numbers in (especially military) radio transmitters

RF circuits are significantly different from broadband amplifier circuits. The antenna or following circuit stage typically contains one or more adjustable capacitive or inductive component allowing the resonance of the stage to be accurately matched with carrier frequency in use, to optimize power transfer from and loading on the valve, a so-called &quot;tuned circuit&quot;.

Broadband circuits require flat response over a wide range of frequencies. RF circuits by contrast are typically required to operate at high frequencies but often over a very narrow frequency range. For example, an RF device might be required to operate over the range 144 to 146 MHz (just 1.4%)

Today, radio transmitters are overwhelmingly silicon based, even at microwave frequencies. However, an ever-decreasing minority of high power radio frequency amplifiers continue to have valve construction.

<text>The Voter News Service was an exit polling consortium formed in 1990 by six major U.S. news media organizations, until its disbandment in 2003. Its mission was to provide results for United States presidential elections, so that individual organizations and networks would not have to do exit polling and vote tallying in parallel.

==Members==
The VNS included major United States television networks and newspapers:
* ABC News
* CBS News
* NBC News
* CNN
* Fox News
* The Associated Press

ABC News scooped its partners all night in reporting outcomes of the 1994 US elections when it hired an outside firm to do exit polling and was able to make earlier calls with that data.

==Role in the 2000 presidential election==
===Election night in Florida===
The VNS received intense criticism for its &#x27;flip-flop&#x27; calling of the state of Florida in that election. During the course of the evening, it first called the closely contested state of Florida for Al Gore, then to George W. Bush, and then as &#x27;too close to call&#x27;. Critics argued that the state should never have been called until the state&#x27;s fate was clear. The service also received criticism for calling Florida for Gore before the polls closed in the Florida panhandle, which was located in the Central Time Zone and heavily Republican, and for calling the state to Bush before precincts in Broward, Palm Beach, Volusia, and Miami-Dade Counties reported their results to the state.

===&quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;===
The next day it was discovered that &#x27;bad data&#x27; resulted in the confusion of the previous night. Due to the Bush margin of victory being less than 0.5% of the total number of votes cast, an automatic statewide machine recount was ordered. In Palm Beach County, a butterfly ballot was used to conduct the election in some precincts. On election day, voters intending to vote for Al Gore instead voted for Pat Buchanan, and the Reform Party ticket. Buchanan received 3,407 votes or 0.8% of the total compared to 0.29% of the total statewide. As a result, unwilling Buchanan voters in Palm Beach county reported votes for Gore in exit polling which resulted in flawed data.

==2002 polling attempt and subsequent disbandment==
In 2002, the VNS intended to make calls in the November 2002 U.S. Congressional and Senate elections. It attempted to use a computer system designed for VNS by Battelle Memorial Institute to do this. A system failure occurred in this computer on election night, making quick delivery of data impossible. In fact, collecting and delivering the data took ten months to complete.

In January 2003, the Voter News Service was disbanded largely because of failures in 2000 and 2002. Murray Edelman, VNS editorial director, criticized the decision as making the VNS a scapegoat.

==National Election Pool==
In the 2004 presidential election, the news organizations that had comprised the membership of the Voter News Service set up a new organization named the National Election Pool, utilizing consultants Edison/Mitofsky for exit polling and the Associated Press for official returns. However, the NEP had controversies of its own for 2004 when it released exit polling data early that was significantly different from the final results.

<text>George Elroy Boyd (June 30, 1952 – July 7, 2020) was a playwright and a former co-host of the CBC &quot;Morning News&quot;. He was the first black national news anchor in Canada, working as an original anchor of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Newsworld, which launched in 1989.

==Biography==
One of a family of nine, of seventh-generation Empire Loyalist stock, Boyd was born and raised in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He has written for the stage, radio, television and motion pictures.

In 1988, with his debut play, &quot;Shine Boy&quot;, Boyd became the first indigenous African-Nova Scotian to have a play professionally produced at Neptune Theatre, Nova Scotia&#x27;s premier main stage. Since then, his plays were shown in Lahore, Pakistan, Toronto, Winnipeg, Montreal and New York, US, among other locales.

A recipient of numerous awards from his native Nova Scotia, in 2000, his play &quot;Consecrated Ground&quot; was nominated for a Governor General&#x27;s Award for drama.

&quot;Wade in the Water&quot;, produced by the Black Theatre Workshop of Montreal in 2004, and Centaur Theatre in 2005, garnered Boyd a nomination for the Montreal English Critics Circle Award (MECCA).

More recently his play &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Blues&quot; was adapted into an hour-long TV drama called &quot;The Gospel According to the Blues&quot;, directed by Thom Fitzgerald for Emotion Pictures.

Boyd resided in Montreal. His 2009 play, &quot;Le Code Noir&quot;, about the life of 18th-century composer Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, was produced by Black Theatre Workshop of Montreal, at the Segal Centre for the Performing Arts.

One of Boyd&#x27;s last works was tentatively entitled &quot;The Days Of Douglass&quot;, and regarded the final days in the life of Frederick Douglass.

Boyd died July 7, 2020, in Montreal, Quebec.

<doc id="325015" wikidata="Q2060860" url="?curid=325015" title="Sir John Soane's Museum">
<text>Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum is a house museum, located next to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in Holborn, London, which was formerly the home of neo-classical architect John Soane. It holds many drawings and architectural models of Soane&#x27;s projects and a large collection of paintings, sculptures, drawings, and antiquities that he acquired over many years. The museum was established during Soane&#x27;s own lifetime by a private act of Parliament, Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. &quot;4&quot; ), which took effect on his death in 1837. Soane engaged in this lengthy parliamentary campaign in order to disinherit his son, whom he disliked intensely. The act stipulated that on Soane&#x27;s death, his house and collections would pass into the care of a board of trustees acting on behalf of the nation, and that they would be preserved as nearly as possible exactly in the state they were at his death. The museum&#x27;s trustees remained completely independent, relying only on Soane&#x27;s original endowment, until 1947. Since then, the museum has received an annual Grant-in-Aid from the British Government via the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

From 1988 onwards, a programme of restoration was carried out, with spaces such as the drawing rooms, picture room, study and dressing room, picture room recess and others, restored to their original colour schemes and in most cases having their original sequences of objects reinstated. Soane&#x27;s three courtyards were also restored with his pasticcio (a column of architectural fragments) being reinstated in the monument court at the heart of the museum. In 1997, the trustees purchased the main house at No. 14 with the help of the Heritage Lottery Fund. The house was restored and has enabled the museum to expand its educational activities, to re-locate its research library, and create a Robert Adam Study Centre where Soane&#x27;s collection of 9,000 Robert Adam drawings is housed.

Soane&#x27;s collection of paintings includes works by Canaletto, Hogarth, three works by his friend J. M. W. Turner, Thomas Lawrence, Antoine Watteau, Joshua Reynolds, Augustus Wall Callcott, Henry Fuseli, William Hamilton and 15 drawings by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, many of which are framed and displayed in the museum. There are over 30,000 architectural drawings in the collection, along with various Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities, including the Sarcophagus of Seti I. Owing to the narrow passages in the house, all decked with Soane&#x27;s extensive collections, only 90 visitors are allowed in the museum at any given time, and a formation of queue outside for entry is not unusual. Labels are few and lighting is discreet; there is no information desk or café.

In the year ended March 2024, the museum received a record 157,938 visitors.

The Museum annually awards the Soane Medal for architecture.

== History ==
=== Houses ===
Soane demolished and rebuilt three houses in succession on the north side of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. He began with No. 12 (between 1792 and 1794), externally a plain brick house. After becoming Professor of Architecture at the Royal Academy in 1806, Soane purchased No. 13, the house next door, today the museum, and rebuilt it in two phases in 1808–09 and 1812.

In 1808–09, Soane constructed his drawing office and &quot;museum&quot; on the site of the former stable block at the back, using primarily top lighting. In 1812, he rebuilt the front part of the site, adding a projecting Portland stone façade to the basement, ground and first floor levels and the centre bay of the second floor. Originally, this formed three open loggias, but Soane glazed the arches during his lifetime. Once he had moved into No. 13, Soane rented out his former home at No. 12 (on his death it was left to the nation along with No. 13, the intention being that the rental income would fund the running of the museum).

After completing No.13, Soane set about treating the building as an architectural laboratory, continually remodelling the interiors. In 1823, when he was over 70, he purchased a third house, No. 14, which he rebuilt in 1823–24. This project allowed him to construct a picture gallery, linked to No.13, on the former stable block of No. 14. The front main part of this third house was treated as a separate dwelling and let as an investment; it was not internally connected to the other buildings. When he died, No. 14 was bequeathed to his family and passed out of the museum&#x27;s ownership.
=== Museum ===

The museum was established during Soane&#x27;s own lifetime by a private act of Parliament, (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. &quot;4&quot; ), which took effect on Soane&#x27;s death in 1837. The act required that No. 13 be maintained &quot;as nearly as possible&quot; as it was left at the time of Soane&#x27;s death, and that has largely been done. The act was necessary because Sir John had a living direct male heir, his son George, with whom he had had a &quot;lifelong feud&quot; due to George&#x27;s debts, refusal to engage in a trade, and his marriage, of which Sir John disapproved. He also wrote an &quot;anonymous, defamatory piece for the Sunday papers about Sir John, calling him a cheat, a charlatan and a copyist&quot;. Since under contemporary inheritance law George would have been able to lay claim to Sir John&#x27;s property on his death, Sir John engaged in a lengthy parliamentary campaign to disinherit his son via a private act, setting out to &quot;reverse the fundamental laws of hereditary succession&quot; according to some. The Soane Museum Act was passed in April 1833 and stipulated that on Soane&#x27;s death his house and collections would pass into the care of a board of trustees, on behalf of the nation, and that they should be preserved as nearly as possible exactly as they were left at his death.

Towards the end of the 19th century (1889–90) a break-through was made to re-connect the rear rooms of No. 12 (north of the courtyard) through to the museum in No. 13 and since 1969 No. 12 has been run by the trustees as part of the museum, housing the research library (until 2009), offices and, since 1995, the Eva Jiřičná-designed &#x27;Soane Gallery&#x27; for temporary exhibitions (until Summer 2011). The museum&#x27;s trustees remained completely independent, relying only on Soane&#x27;s original endowment, until 1947. Since that date the museum has received an annual Grant-in-Aid from the British Government (this now comes via the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport).

==== Restoration projects ====
The Soane Museum is now a national centre for the study of architecture. From 1988 to 2005, a programme of restoration within the museum was carried out under Peter Thornton and then Margaret Richardson with spaces such as the drawing rooms, picture room, study and dressing room, picture room recess and others being put back to their original colour schemes and in most cases having their original sequences of objects reinstated; Soane&#x27;s three courtyards were also restored with his pasticcio (a column of architectural fragments) being reinstated in the monument court at the heart of the museum. (Much of the cost of the work was financed by the Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum Foundation, in New York.)

In 1997, the trustees purchased the main house at No. 14 with the help of the Heritage Lottery Fund. The house was restored (2006–09) and has enabled the museum to expand its educational activities, to re-locate its Research Library into that house, and to create a Robert Adam Study Centre where Soane&#x27;s collection of 9,000 Robert Adam drawings is housed in purpose-designed new cabinets by Senior and Carmichael.

==== Opening up the Soane project, 2011–2016 ====

The acquisition of No. 14 enabled the museum under its new director Tim Knox to complete the restoration of the museum&#x27;s historic spaces, for about £7 million, funded by the Monument Trust, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Soane Foundation in New York, and other private trusts. The museum&#x27;s architects are Julian Harrap Architects.

Phase 1 began in March 2011 and was completed in 2013. It included the re-configuration of No. 12, moving the temporary exhibition gallery up to the first floor (with new showcases etc. designed by Caruso St John), and new reception facilities and a shop on the ground floor. It also included new conservation studios, named the John and Cynthia Fry Gunn Conservation Centre, and the installation of lifts to provide disabled access for the first time.

Phase 2 saw the restoration of Soane&#x27;s private apartments on the second floor (bedroom, book room, model room, oratory and Mrs Soane&#x27;s morning room) and opened to public tours in summer 2015. Lost rooms recreated include Soane&#x27;s own bedroom and bathroom, which he showed to the public in his lifetime.

Phase 3 provided a new Study Room at the back of No. 12 for the public to learn more about Soane, and restoration of Soane&#x27;s ground-floor Ante Room with almost 200 works of art and the catacombs beneath it. The final Phase 3 of the programme was completed in summer 2016.

== Architecture ==
The most famous spaces in the house are those at the rear of the museum – the dome area, colonnade and museum corridor. These are mostly toplit and provide some idea in miniature form of the ingenious lighting contrived by Soane for the toplit banking halls at the Bank of England. The ingeniously designed Picture Gallery has walls composed of large &#x27;moveable planes&#x27; (like large cupboard doors) that allow it to house three times as many items as a space of this size could normally accommodate (the original hang in this room was reinstated in January 2011). When visiting, it is necessary to request the planes to be opened and wait for a group to gather before this is done.

The more domestic rooms of No. 13 are at the front of the house, many of them highly unusual, but often in subtle ways. The domed ceiling of the Breakfast Room, inset with convex mirrors, has influenced architects from around the world. The Library-Dining Room reflects the influence of Etruscan tombs and perhaps even gothic design in its repertoire of small pendants like those in fan vaulting. It is decorated in a rich &#x27;Pompeian&#x27; red. The Study contains a collection of Roman architectural fragments and the two external courtyards, the Monument Court and Monk&#x27;s Yard contain an array of architectural fragments, Classical in the Monument Court with its central column or &#x27;pasticcio&#x27; representing Architecture and Gothic in the Monk&#x27;s Yard, filled with medieval stonework from the Palace of Westminster.

== Collections ==

:&quot;See also :Category:Collection of Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum.&quot;

=== Antiquities, medieval and non-western objects ===
As his practice prospered, Soane was able to collect objects worthy of the British Museum, including the Sarcophagus of Seti I, covered in Egyptian hieroglyphs, discovered by Giovanni Battista Belzoni, bought on 12 May 1824 for £2000 ()—Soane&#x27;s most expensive art work.

After the Seti sarcophagus arrived at his house in March 1825, Soane held a three-day party, to which 890 people were invited, the basement where the sarcophagus was housed was lit by over one hundred lamps and candelabra, refreshments were laid on and the exterior of the house was hung with lamps. Among the guests were the then Prime Minister Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool and his wife, Robert Peel, Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, J.M.W. Turner, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Charles Long, 1st Baron Farnborough, Benjamin Haydon as well as many foreign dignitaries.

Other antiquities include: Greek and Roman bronzes, including ones from Pompeii, cinerary urns, fragments of Roman mosaics, Greek vases many displayed above the bookcases in the library, Greek and Roman busts, heads from statues and fragments of sculpture and architectural decoration, examples of Roman glass.

Medieval objects include: architectural fragments, mainly from the Old Palace of Westminster (acquired after the 1834 fire), tiles and stained glass. Soane acquired 44 examples of 18th-century Chinese ceramics as well as 12 examples of Peruvian pottery. Soane also purchased four ivory chairs and a table, believed to be made in Murshidabad for Tipu Sultan&#x27;s palace at Srirangapatna.

=== Sculpture ===
Francis Leggatt Chantrey carved a white marble bust of Soane that is still in the museum, in the &#x27;Dome&#x27; overlooking the Seti sarcophagus. Soane also acquired Sir Richard Westmacott&#x27;s plaster model for &quot;Nymph unclasping her Zone&quot;, displayed at the back of the recess in the Picture Room. Other acquisitions include: the plaster model of John Flaxman&#x27;s memorial sculpture of William Pitt the Younger. The model of Thomas Banks&#x27;s monument to Penelope Boothby.

Of ancient sculptures a miniature copy of the famous sculpture of Diana of Ephesus is one of the most important in the collection. After the death of his teacher Henry Holland, Soane bought part of his collection of ancient marble fragments of architectural decoration, these were purchased by Charles Heathcote Tatham for Holland in Rome in 1794–96.

Plastercasts of famous antique sculptures include: Aphrodite of Cnidus, Hercules Hesperides &amp; Apollo Belvedere. Soane also acquired a plastercast of the Sulis Minerva sculpture found in Bath.

=== Paintings and drawings ===
Soane&#x27;s paintings include: works by Canaletto entitled &quot;View of the Riva degli Schiavoni&quot; painted (1736) purchased in 1806 from William Thomas Beckford for 150 Guineas plus three other works by the artist, and paintings by Hogarth: the eight canvases of the A Rake&#x27;s Progress, purchased from the collection of William Thomas Beckford, at auction for 570 Guineas in 1801, the other Hogarth paintings Soane purchased were the four canvases of the Humours of an Election bought at auction at Christie&#x27;s from David Garrick&#x27;s widow for £1,732, 10s in June 1823. Soane acquired three works by his friend J. M. W. Turner: the oil paintings &quot;Admiral Van Tromp&#x27;s Barge entering the Texel&quot; and &quot;St Hugues Denouncing Vegeance on the Shepherd of Cormayer Val D&#x27;Aoust&quot; and the watercolour &quot;Kirkstall Abbey&quot;. Thomas Lawrence painted a three quarter length portrait of Soane, it is hung over the Dining Room fireplace in the museum. Soane also has a painting by Antoine Watteau, &quot;a fête champêtre&quot;. Soane owned one oil painting by Joshua Reynolds, entitled &quot;Love and Beauty&quot;, which hangs in the dining room over the sideboard. Soane commissioned an oil painting from Augustus Wall Callcott c.1830, entitled &quot;The Passage Point -Italian Composition&quot;. Other paintings include &quot;The Count of Revenna&quot; by Henry Fuseli, and &quot;The Landing of Richard II at Milford Haven&quot; by William Hamilton.
Soane acquired 15 drawings by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, many of which are framed and displayed in the museum. Soane&#x27;s friend John Flaxman, sketched Soane&#x27;s wife, this is framed and displayed in the museum. The collection also includes twenty-two works in gouache and bodycolour by Charles-Louis Clérisseau.
=== Architectural drawings and architectural models ===
There are over 30,000 architectural drawings in the collection. Of Soane&#x27;s drawings of his own designs (many are by his assistants and pupils, most notably Joseph Gandy), covering his entire career, most are bound in 37 volumes, 97 are framed on the museum walls, and the rest are 601 covering the Bank of England, 6,266 of his other works, and 1,080 prepared for the Royal Academy lectures.

In 1817 George Dance the Younger gave Soane a gift of a book containing architectural drawings by Christopher Wren, including Hampton Court Palace &amp; Royal Naval Hospital. A major coup for Soane&#x27;s collection was the purchase of the 57 volumes of 8,856 drawings by Robert Adam and James Adam in 1821 for £200. Another important architectural book was John Thorpe&#x27;s book of architecture, purchased at an auction held at Christie&#x27;s on 3 April 1810 and costing Soane Guineas; the book contains nearly 300 plans and elevations of Elizabethan architecture and Jacobean architecture, mainly large mansions. George Dance the Younger died in 1825, and in 1836 Soane purchased both George Dance the Elder&#x27;s 293 and George Dance the Younger&#x27;s 1,303 surviving drawings from his son, which were housed in the museum in a specially designed cabinet; Sir William Chambers 789 drawings; James Playfair 286 drawings; other architects and artists with drawings in the collection include: Matthew Brettingham, Thomas Sandby, Humphry Repton, Joseph Nollekens, Peter Scheemakers, John Michael Rysbrack, and others, in total 1,635 drawings.
There are a large number of Italian drawings, including an early 16th-century bound volume by Nicolette da Modena; the Codex Coner early 16th century of Roman buildings; 213 mid-16th century drawings by Giorgio Vasari; 3 volumes of 16th to 17th-century drawings by Giovanni Battista Montano; 17th-century drawings by Giovanni Battista Gisleni; two volumes of 18th-century drawings by Carlo Fontana; Drawings of Paestum dated 1768 by Thomas Major; Margaret Chinnery&#x27;s volume of miscellaneous drawings; plus six other volumes of various drawings.

The 252 architectural models in the collection are: 118 of Soane&#x27;s own buildings including 44 of the Bank of England, covering details, façades, rooms as well as complete buildings, models of ancient Roman and Greek buildings, 20 made from plaster and 14 of cork. There are in addition 100 models of architectural details and ornaments. The 20 plaster models are the work of Jean-Pierre Fouquet of Paris and were acquired by Soane in 1834 for £100, these include: Erechtheion, Tower of the Winds, Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, Pantheon, Rome, Temple of Vesta, Tivoli, Temple of Antoninus and Faustina and the Temple of Portunus, the buildings are depicted as reconstructions not in their current ruined state.

== Management ==

=== Attendance ===
To this day only 90 visitors are allowed at a time, which often means a queue outside. Labels are few and lighting is discreet; there is no information desk or café. In 2010, the museum attracted 110,000 visitors.

=== Staff ===
Soane&#x27;s will provided for there to be a curator, and an inspectress (the post was created for Soane&#x27;s housekeeper and close family friend Mrs Sarah Conduitt). The architectural historian Sir John Summerson was curator of the museum from 1945 to 1984. He was assisted by Dorothy Stroud, who served as inspectress from 1945 to 1985.

Summerson was succeeded by Peter Thornton who moved from the Victoria and Albert Museum to take up the post. Thornton retired in 1995, and was followed by Margaret Richardson, the first woman to hold the title of curator. She had succeeded Stroud as inspectress in 1985, and served as curator until 2005, with Helen Dorey as inspectress). From 2005 the director of the museum was Tim Knox, previously head curator of the National Trust, under whose leadership the museum has embarked on the ambitious &#x27;Opening up the Soane&#x27; project combining the restoration of Nos. 12 and 13, including a number of lost historic features, with improved visitor and conservation facilities. The &#x27;Opening up the Soane&#x27; project also includes a programme of audience development, a new website and on-line catalogues of the collections. In 2013, the Victoria and Albert Museum&#x27;s design and architecture curator Abraham Thomas was named director of the Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum. Thomas was succeeded in the post in 2016 by Bruce Boucher, former director of the Fralin Museum of Art. It was announced on 4 August 2023 that Will Gompertz will take over as Director from January 2024.
