<text>Messier 5 or M5 (also designated NGC 5904) is a globular cluster in the constellation Serpens. It was discovered by Gottfried Kirch in 1702.

==Discovery and visibility==
M5 is, under extremely good conditions, just visible to the naked eye as a faint &quot;star&quot; 0.37 of a degree (22&#x27; (arcmin)) north-west of star 5 Serpentis. Binoculars and/or small telescopes resolve the object as non-stellar; larger telescopes will show some individual stars, some of which are as bright as apparent magnitude 10.6.
M5 was discovered by German astronomer Gottfried Kirch in 1702 when he was observing a comet. Charles Messier noted it in 1764 and—a studier of comets—cast it as one of his nebulae. William Herschel was the first to resolve individual stars in the cluster in 1791, counting roughly 200. Messier 5 is receding from the Solar System at a speed over 50 km/s.

==Notable features==
Within M5, there are 105 known variable stars, 97 of them belonging to the RR Lyrae type. RR Lyrae stars, sometimes referred to as &quot;Cluster Variables&quot;, are somewhat similar to Cepheid type variables and as such can be used as a tool to measure distances in outer space since the relation between their luminosities and periods are well known. The brightest and most easily observed variable in M5 varies from magnitude 10.6 to 12.1 in a period of just under 26.5 days.

The cluster contains two millisecond pulsars, one of which is in a binary, allowing the proper motion of the cluster to be measured. The binary could help our understanding of neutron degenerate matter; the current median mass, if confirmed, would exclude any &quot;soft&quot; equation of state for such matter. The cluster has been used to test for magnetic dipole moments in neutrinos, which could shed light on some hypothetical particles such as the axion.

A dwarf nova has also been observed in this cluster.

<text>William Conti (born April 13, 1942) is an American composer and conductor. He is best known for his film scores, including &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), &quot;Rocky II&quot; (1979), &quot;Rocky III&quot; (1982), &quot;Rocky V&quot; (1990), &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; (2006), &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984), &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; (1986), &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; (1989), &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; (1994), &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981), &quot;Dynasty&quot; (and its sequel &quot;The Colbys&quot;), and &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983), which earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Score. He also received nominations in the Best Original Song category for &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot; from &quot;Rocky&quot; and for the title song of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;. He was the musical director at the Academy Awards a record nineteen times.

Conti is known for his collaborations with director John G. Avildsen, having scored fourteen films for Avildsen, beginning with &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976) and ending with &quot;Inferno&quot; (1999). Their collaboration included such pictures as the first three films in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; franchise (1984–1989), &quot;Slow Dancing in the Big City&quot; (1978), &quot;The Formula&quot; (1980), and &quot;Neighbors&quot; (1981).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Conti, an Italian American, was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the son of Lucetta and William Conti. He graduated from North Miami High School in 1959. He is a past winner of the Silver Knight Award presented by the Miami Herald. He is a graduate of Louisiana State University School of Music, where he met his wife Shelby Cox, and earned a master&#x27;s degree with honors from the Juilliard School of Music.

===&quot;Rocky&quot; series===
As early as 1971, Bill was orchestrating pop recordings by Italian artists, such as the album &quot;Sì... incoerenza&quot; (&quot;Yes to Incoherence&quot;) by Italian singer Patty Pravo. He was also a ghostwriter of the scores for Spaghetti Westerns. Conti&#x27;s big break into celebrity came in 1976, when United Artists hired him to compose the music for a small film called &quot;Rocky&quot;. The film became a phenomenon and won three Oscars at the 49th Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The same ceremony was also the first time Conti served as musical director for the telecast, a role he reprised 19 times, more than any other person. His training montage tune, &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot;, topped the Billboard singles chart in 1977, and earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.

Conti also composed music for the sequels &quot;Rocky II&quot; (1979), &quot;Rocky III&quot; (1982), &quot;Rocky V&quot; (1990) and &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; (2006).

===Other film and television credits===
Conti also worked for some other films and, eventually, for television series. In 1981, he wrote the music for the James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, when John Barry was unwilling to return to the United Kingdom for tax reasons, and provided the score for playwright Jason Miller&#x27;s film version of his Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;That Championship Season&quot; the following year.

In 1983, Conti composed the score for HBO&#x27;s first film, &quot;The Terry Fox Story&quot;. He then did &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, &quot;Living Proof: The Hank Williams Jr. Story&quot;, &quot;Mass Appeal&quot;. In 1984, he won an Academy Award for composing the score to 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, after which he wrote the music for the TV series &quot;North and South&quot; in 1985. He also scored the &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; live action film. Another score was the 1987 film &quot;Happy New Year&quot;.

In 1991, Conti composed for &quot;Necessary Roughness&quot;, a college football film. In 1993, he wrote the music for &quot;The Adventures of Huck Finn&quot; starring Elijah Wood and directed by Stephen Sommers. In 1999, he composed the score for &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; remake, starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo. That year, he scored &quot;Inferno&quot;, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Conti composed the themes to television&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;The Colbys&quot;, &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; and &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey.&quot; He wrote the theme song to the original version of &quot;American Gladiators&quot;, worked with CBS on its 1980s film jingle, composed one of the early themes of &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, and wrote the &quot;Primetime Live&quot; theme for ABC News. He composed the score to the studio-altered American version of Luc Besson&#x27;s &quot;The Big Blue&quot;.

Two of Conti&#x27;s previously composed works were reused for the show &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;. These were the love theme &quot;Come with Me Now&quot;, from the soundtrack for &quot;Five Days from Home&quot; (used for the show&#x27;s main theme), and &quot;Runaway&quot;, from &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (used for in-show content).

==Awards and nominations==
Conti has been nominated for three Academy Awards, winning one in the Best Original Score category for &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;. He also received nominations in the Best Original Song category for &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot; from &quot;Rocky&quot; and for the title song of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;.

He had three Golden Globe nominations; two for Best Original Score for &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot;, and one for Best Original Song for the title song of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;.

Conti also received thirteen Emmy nominations, all but one for his role as musical director at the Academy Awards (the exception, his first nomination, was for his music for the 1985 series &quot;North and South&quot;). He won five Emmy Awards for Outstanding Musical Direction for the 64th, 70th and 75th Academy Award ceremonies.

On April 22, 2008, at the LSU Union Theatre at Louisiana State University, Conti was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.

<doc id="336110" wikidata="Q904470" url="?curid=336110" title="Racism in Japan">
<text>comprises negative attitudes and views on race or ethnicity which are held by various people and groups in Japan, and have been reflected in discriminatory laws, practices and action (including violence) at various times in the history of Japan against racial or ethnic groups.

According to census statistics in 2018, 97.8% of Japan&#x27;s population are Japanese, with the remainder being foreign nationals residing in Japan. The number of foreign workers has increased dramatically in recent years, due to the aging population and a shrinking labor force. A news article in 2018 suggests that approximately 1 out of 10 people among the younger population residing in Tokyo are foreign nationals. According to the CIA World Factbook, Japanese make up 98.1% of the population, Chinese 0.5%, and Korean 0.4%, with the remaining 1% representing all other ethnic groups.

Japan lacks any law which prohibits racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination. The country also has no national human rights institutions. Non-Japanese individuals in Japan often face human rights violations that Japanese citizens may not. In recent years, non-Japanese media has reported that Japanese firms frequently confiscate the passports of guest workers in Japan, particularly unskilled laborers.

In the early 20th century, driven by an ideology of Japanese nationalism and in the name of national unity, the Japanese government identified and forcefully assimilated marginalized populations, which included indigenous Ryukyuans, Ainu, and other underrepresented groups, imposing assimilation programs in language, culture and religion. Japan considers these ethnic groups as a mere &quot;subgroup&quot; of the Japanese people and therefore synonymous to the Yamato people, and does not recognize them as a minority group with a distinct culture.

==Background==
===Demographics===

About 2.4% of Japan&#x27;s total legal resident population are foreign citizens. Of these, according to 2022 data from the Japanese government, the principal groups are as follows.

The above statistics do not include the approximately 30,000 U.S. military stationed in Japan, nor do they account for illegal immigrants. The statistics also do not take into account naturalized citizens from backgrounds including but not limited to Korean and Chinese, and citizen descendants of immigrants. The total legal resident population of 2012 is estimated at 127.6 million.

==By target==
===Japanese ethnic minorities===

The nine largest minority groups residing in Japan are: North and South Korean, Chinese (also Taiwanese), Brazilian (many Brazilians in Japan have Japanese ancestors), Filipinos, Vietnamese, the Ainu indigenous to Hokkaido, the Ryukyuans indigenous to Okinawa, and other islands between Kyushu and Taiwan. The burakumin, an outcast group at the bottom of Japan&#x27;s feudal order, are sometimes included. There are also a number of smaller ethnic communities in Japan with a much shorter history.

According to the United Nations&#x27; 2008 Diène report, communities most affected by racism and xenophobia in Japan include:

* the national minorities of Ainu and people of Okinawa,
* people and descendants of people from neighbouring countries (Chinese and Koreans)
* and the new immigrants from other Asian, African, South American and Middle Eastern countries.

===Koreans===

Since the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876 and up to World War II, Koreans sought asylum and educational opportunities that were available in Japan. In 1910, the Japan-Korean Annexation Treaty was established and it stated that Koreans would be granted Japanese citizenship by law because Korea was annexed by Japan. During World War II, the Japanese government established the National Mobilization Law.

Following World War II, Koreans decided to illegally participate in the Post-World War II rebuilding of Japan because of the discrimination which they were being subjected to, both politically and economically; they were treated unfairly and paid low wages in Japan. (resident in Japan) Koreans are permanent residents of Japan registered as Joseon (, Japanese: ) or South Korean nationality. Joseon was annexed by Japan in 1910, therefore Koreans with Joseon citizenship are de facto stateless. After World War II, two million Koreans living in Japan were granted a temporary Joseon nationality under the US military government (because there was no government in Korea then). However, the meaning of Joseon nationality became vague as Korea was divided by the United States and the Soviet Union, and in 1948 North and South Korea each established their own government. Some obtained South Korean citizenship later, but others who opposed the division of Korea or sympathized with North Korea maintained their Joseon nationality because people are not allowed to register North Korean nationality.

Most came to Japan from Korea under Japanese rule between 1910 and 1945. A large proportion of this immigration is said to be the result of Korean landowners and workers losing their land and livelihood due to Japanese land and production confiscation initiatives and migrating to Japan for work. According to the calculation of Rudolph Rummel, a total of 5.4 million Koreans were also conscripted into forced labor and shipped throughout the Japanese Empire. He estimates that 60,000 Koreans died during forced labor in places such as Manchuria and Sakhalin.

During the Japanese rule of Korea, the Japanese government implemented a policy of cultural assimilation. Korean culture was suppressed, artistic and literary works that opposed Japanese rule were subjected to censorship and prohibition, and the Korean language was regarded as a regional ethnic language and suppressed, while the Japanese language was designated as the national language, with Koreans being required to learn it. After a relatively lenient period, the Korean language course in public schools was downgraded to a non-compulsory subject in 1938 and cancelled in 1941, though the Korean language and Hangeul were still used in war-time propaganda until the last days of Japanese rule. Koreans were forced to take Japanese names from 1940. However, Koreans resisted this policy, and by the end of the 1940s, it was almost completely undone. Thousands of ethnic Koreans in Japan were massacred as false rumors spread that Koreans were rioting, looting, or poisoning wells in the aftermath of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake in the Kantō Massacre. Many Korean refugees also came to the country during the Jeju uprising in the First Republic of South Korea. Though most migrants returned to Korea, GHQ estimates in 1946 indicated that approximately 650,000 Koreans remained in Japan.

After World War II, the Korean community in Japan was split between allegiance to South Korea (Mindan) and North Korea (Chongryon). The last major wave of Korean migration to Japan started after South Korea was devastated by the Korean War in the 1950s. Most notably, the large number of refugees were from Jejuans escaping from the massacres on Jeju Island by the authoritarian South Korean government.

 who identify themselves with Chongryon are also an important money source for North Korea. One estimate suggests that the total annual transfers from Japan to North Korea may exceed US$200 million. Japanese law does not allow dual citizenship for adults over 22 and until the 1980s required adoption of a Japanese name for citizenship. Partially for this reason, many did not obtain Japanese citizenship as they saw the process as humiliating.

Although more are becoming Japanese citizens, issues of identity remain complicated. Even those who do not choose to become Japanese citizens often use Japanese names to avoid discrimination, and live their lives as if they were Japanese. This is in contrast with the Chinese living in Japan, who generally use their Chinese names and openly form Chinatown communities. An increase in tensions between Japan and North Korea in the late 1990s led to a surge of attacks against Chongryon, the pro-North residents&#x27; organisation, including a pattern of assaults against Korean schoolgirls in Japan. The Japanese authorities have recently started to crack down on Chongryon with investigations and arrests. These moves are often criticized by Chongryon as acts of political suppression.

When Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara referred to Chinese and Koreans as &quot;sangokujin&quot; in 2000 in the context of foreigners being a potential source of unrest in the aftermath of an earthquake, the foreign community complained. Historically, the word has often been used pejoratively and Ishihara&#x27;s statement brought images of the massacre of Koreans by civilians and police alike after the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake to mind. Therefore, the use of the term in context of potential rioting by foreigners is considered by many as provocative, if not explicitly racist.

In 2014, a United States government human rights report expressed concern about the abuse and harassment directed against Korean nationals by Japanese right-wing groups such as the Uyoku dantai. In 2022, it was reported that anti-Korean racism in Japan has been on the rise, with homes burned, including one in Utoro district in Uji, and death threats made towards ethnic Korean communities.

===Mainland Chinese===

Mainland Chinese are the largest legal minority in Japan (according to the 2018 statistics as shown above). An investigator from the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) said, racism against Koreans and Chinese is deeply rooted in Japan because of history and culture.

===Taiwanese===
There are a number of Taiwanese people that reside in Japan due to Taiwan&#x27;s history as being a colony of Japan from 1895 to 1945. Renhō (born Hsieh Lien-fang ()), the former leader of the Democratic Party, is known to be the most famous mixed Taiwanese-Japanese politician.

In 2000, the then governor of Tokyo Shintaro Ishihara insulted the Taiwanese, referring to them as Sangokujin:

:I referred to the &quot;many who entered Japan illegally.&quot; I thought some people would not know that word so I paraphrased it and used &quot;gaikokujin&quot;, or foreigners. But it was a newspaper holiday so the news agencies consciously picked up the part, causing the problem.

:... After World War II, when Japan lost, the Chinese of Taiwanese origin and people from the Korean Peninsula persecuted, robbed, and sometimes beat up Japanese. It&#x27;s at that time the word was used, so it was not derogatory. Rather we were afraid of them.

:... There&#x27;s no need for an apology. I was surprised that there was a big reaction to my speech. In order not to cause any misunderstanding, I decided I will no longer use that word. It is regrettable that the word was interpreted in the way it was.&quot;

===Ainu===

The Ainu are an indigenous group mainly living in Hokkaidō, with some also living in modern-day Russia. At present, the official Japanese government estimate of the population is 25,000, though this number has been disputed with unofficial estimates of upwards of 200,000.

For much of Japanese history, the Ainu were the main inhabitants of Hokkaido. However, as a result of Japanese migration into the island after 1869, the Ainu were largely displaced and assimilated. Due to Meiji era policies, the Ainu were evicted from their traditional homelands and their cultural practices were outlawed. Official recognition of the Ainu as an indigenous group occurred over a century later on June 6, 2008, as a result of a resolution passed by the government of Japan, which recognized both their cultural differences and their past struggles.

===Ryukyuan===

The Ryukyuan people lived in an independent kingdom until it became a vassal of Japan&#x27;s Satsuma Domain in 1609. The kingdom, however, retained a degree of autonomy until 1872 when the islands were officially annexed by Japan and restructured as Okinawa Prefecture in 1879. They are now Japan&#x27;s largest minority group, with 1.3 million living in Okinawa and 300,000 living in other areas of Japan.

The Okinawan language, the most widely spoken Ryukyuan language, is related to Japanese, the two being in the Japonic languages. Ryukyuan languages were heavily suppressed through a policy of forced assimilation throughout the former Ryukyu Kingdom after it was annexed in 1872. With only the standard Japanese taught in schools and students punished for speaking or writing their native language through the use of dialect cards, the younger generations of Ryukyuans began to give up their &quot;backwards&quot; culture for that of Japan. The Japanese government officially labels the Ryukyuan languages as dialects (Hōgen) of Japanese, although they are not mutually intelligible with one another, or even between each other. In 1940, there was a political debate amongst Japanese leaders about whether or not to continue the oppression of the Ryukyuan languages, although the argument for assimilation prevailed. During the Battle of Okinawa, the Japanese military commander sought to suppress spying by banning the speaking of Okinawan, which is often unintelligible to nonresidents. As a result, around one thousand civilians were killed by soldiers. There are still some children learning Ryukyuan languages natively, but this is rare, especially on mainland Okinawa. The language still is used in traditional cultural activities, such as folk music, or folk dance.

After the annexation of the islands, many Ryukyuans, especially Okinawans, migrated to the mainland to find jobs or better living conditions. They were sometimes met with discrimination, such as workplaces with signs that read, &quot;No Ryukyuans or Koreans.&quot; At the 1903 Osaka Exhibition, an exhibit called the &quot;Pavilion of the World&quot; (Jinruikan) had actual Okinawans, Ainu, Koreans, and other &quot;backwards&quot; peoples on display in their native clothes and housing. During the fierce fighting in the Battle of Okinawa, some Japanese soldiers committed multiple atrocities against Okinawan civilians, including rape and murder, using them as human shields , and persuading or forcing them to commit suicide. In 2007, the Ministry of Education attempted to revise school textbooks to lessen mention of these atrocities, but was met with massive demonstrations in Okinawa.

Culturally, Okinawa showed great influences from southern China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia, reflecting its long history of trade with these regions. However, because of the standard use of Japanese in schools, television, and all print media in Okinawa, these cultural differences are often glossed over in Japanese society. Consequently, many Japanese consider Okinawans to be Yamato Japanese, sometimes ignoring their distinct cultural and historical heritage in insensitive ways.

===Other groups===

People of foreign origin and nationality are often called (foreign country person) or &quot;Gaijin&quot; (outsider or alien), with the latter term occasionally perceived to be pejorative and tended to be avoided by mass media. First large influx of such people have started in the 1980s, as the Japanese economy was growing at a high rate.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the Keidanren business lobbying organization advocated a policy of allowing South Americans of Japanese ancestry (mainly Brazilians and Peruvians) to work in Japan, as Japan&#x27;s industries faced a major labor shortage. Although this policy has been decelerated in recent years, many of these individuals continue to live in Japan, some in ethnic enclaves near their workplaces.

Many people from Southeast Asia (particularly Vietnam and the Philippines) and Southwest Asia (and Iran) also entered Japan during this time, making foreigners as a group a more visible minority in Japan. The TBS television series &quot;Smile&quot; is about Bito Hayakawa, who was born to a Japanese mother and Filipino father, and struggled to overcome the difficulties faced as a mixed race child.

The main concerns of the latter groups are often related to their legal status, a public perception of criminal activity, and general discrimination associated with being non-Japanese.

The first arrival of large influx of Western foreigners in Japan, particularly those from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, occurred in the 1980s. Many found jobs as English conversation teachers, but others were employed in various professional fields such as finance and business. Others have arrived as the Japanese government adopted a policy to give scholarships to large numbers of foreign students to study at Japanese universities. Although some have become permanent residents or even naturalized citizens, they are generally perceived as short-term visitors and treated as outsiders in Japanese society.

South Sakhalin, which was once part of Japan as Karafuto Prefecture, had indigenous populations of Nivkhs and Uilta (Orok). Like the Karafuto Koreans but unlike the Ainu, they were thus not included in the evacuation of Japanese nationals after the Soviet invasion in 1945. Some Nivkhs and Uilta who served in the Imperial Japanese Army were held in Soviet work camps; after court cases in the late 1950s and 1960s, they were recognised as Japanese nationals and thus permitted to migrate to Japan. Most settled around Abashiri, Hokkaidō. The was founded to fight for Uilta rights and the preservation of Uilta traditions in 1975 by Dahinien Gendānu.

The Ōbeikei, living in the Bonin Islands, have a varied ethnic background, including European, Micronesian and Kanak.

Although protection and refugee status has been granted to those seeking asylum from Myanmar, the same has not been offered to refugee Kurds in Japan from Turkey. Without this protection and status, these Kurds who have fled from Turkey due to persecution are generally living in destitution, with no education and having no legal residency status. A clash took place outside the Turkish embassy in Tokyo in October 2015 between Kurds and Turks in Japan which began after a Kurdish party flag was shown at the embassy. Beginning in spring 2023, there was a significant increase in anti-Kurdish Japanese posts on the social media platform X. This was possibly fueled by Turkish people posting in Japanese on the platform. Kurds have reported receiving death threats and demands for their expulsion from the country.

The Burakumin group within Japan is ethnically Japanese; however, they are considered of lower status and lower class standing in comparison to other ethnicities in Japan. They worked as primarily farmers and were considered peasants on the social hierarchy pyramid. Post-World War, the Burakumin group was heavily dissociated from society as the abolishment of the feudal caste system did not put an end to the social discrimination that they faced within restricting housing systems; movements and protests have been maintained throughout the years as they fight to receive and equal status as their peers in regard to access to certain educational, housing, and social benefits and citizenship rights. In order to gain attention to the problems and injustices that they experience, groups such as the militant style, Buraka Liberation League, which uses presentations and speaking to prove and explain their frustrations to a panel.

Representation of black people in Japanese media, such as anime, has been subject to criticism.

Instances of harassment, hate speech and discrimination targeting Russians living in Japan were reported after Russian invasion of Ukraine. Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi condemned human rights abuses against Russians that took place.

In January 2024, three foreign-born residents in Japan sued the national and local governments, alleging racial profiling through illegal police questioning. The plaintiffs asserted that they experienced repeated distress from police questioning based on their appearance and ethnicity, which they claimed violated the constitution. They sought recognition of the illegality of racial profiling and 3 million yen ($20,250) in damages each. The lawsuit emerged during a surge in foreign workers in Japan and discussions on Japanese identity.

== By field ==

===Higher learning===
Although foreign professors teach throughout the Japanese higher education system, Robert J. Geller of the University of Tokyo reported, in 1992, that it was extremely rare for them to be given tenure.

===Non-Japanese citizens and crimes===
As in other countries, foreigners sometimes do work that is not allowed by their visas, or overstay the terms of their visas. Their employment tends to be concentrated in fields where most Japanese are not able to or no longer wish to work.

The yakuza or Japanese organized crime has made use of Chinese immigrants in Japan as henchmen to commit crimes, which have led to a negative public perception.
In 2003, foreigners from Africa were responsible for 2.8 times as much crime per capita as Japanese natives but were slightly less likely to commit violent crime.

According to National Police Authority records, in 2002, 16,212 foreigners were caught committing 34,746 crimes, over half of which turned out to be visa violations (residing/working in Japan without a valid visa). The statistics show that 12,667 cases (36.5%) and 487 individuals (0.038%) were Chinese, 5,272 cases (15.72%) and 1,186 individuals (7.3%) were Brazilian, and 2,815 cases (8.1%) and 1,738 individuals (10.7%) were Korean and ~6000 were others foreigners. The total number of crimes committed in the same year by Japanese was 546,934 cases.

Within these statistics, Japanese committed 6,925 violent crimes, of which 2,531 were arson or rape, while foreigners committed 323 violent crimes, but only 42 cases are classified as arson or rape. Foreigners were more likely to commit crimes in groups: About 61.5% of crimes committed by foreigners had one or more accomplice, while only 18.6% of crimes committed by Japanese were in groups. Japanese commit more violent crimes than foreigners.

By a 2022 study by the National Police Agency illegal residents decreased from 219,000 in 2004 to 113,000 in 2008, and in addition, the number of arrested foreign visitors decreased from 21,842 in 2004 to 13,880 in 2008. The percentage of foreign nationals in all arrestees charged in penal code crimes was about 2.0% and this number has remained relatively stable. While the percentage of foreign nationals among all arrestees charged in cases involving robbery or burglary was around 5.5% in 2008.

According to a survey conducted by the Tokyo Bar Association, more than 60% of 2,000 respondents from foreign backgrounds reported being interrogated by the police. Among those questioned, about 77% stated that the encounters seemed to lack any apparent reason other than their foreign appearance.

The former head of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government&#x27;s Emergency Public Safety Task Force, Hiroshi Kubo, published a book called (in English: &quot;Is Public Safety Really Deteriorating?&quot;, ) disputing foreign crime statistics, suggesting that such statistics were being manipulated by politicians for political gain. He suggested, for example, that including visa violations in crime statistics is misleading. He also said that the crime rate in Tokyo is based on reported rather than actual crimes.

===Access to housing and other services===
A significant number of apartments, and some motels, night clubs, brothels, sex parlours and public baths in Japan have put up signs stating that foreigners are not allowed, or that they must be accompanied by a Japanese person to enter.

In February 2002 plaintiffs sued a Hokkaido bathhouse in district court pleading racial discrimination, and on November 11 the Sapporo District Court ordered the bathhouse to pay the plaintiffs ¥1 million each in damages.

In fact, there were a substantial number of lawsuits regarding discrimination against foreigners. For example, in 2005, a Korean woman who attempted to rent a room was refused because she was not a Japanese citizen. She filed a discrimination lawsuit, and she won in Japanese court.

&quot;Discrimination toward foreign nationals in their searches for homes continues to be one of the biggest problems&quot;, said the head of the Ethnic Media Press Centre. Organizers of the service said they hope to eradicate the racism that prevents foreigners, particularly Non-Westerners, from renting apartments since there are currently no laws in Japan that ban discrimination.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many establishments started to exclude non-Japanese customers over fears that they would spread the coronavirus. For example, a ramen shop owner imposed a rule prohibiting non-Japanese people from entering the restaurant.

=== Healthcare ===
Japan provides universal health insurance for all citizens. Foreigners staying in Japan for a year or more are required to enroll for one of the public health insurance schemes. However, before this policy was mandated, many foreign workers, particularly Japanese Brazilians, were less likely to be covered by health insurance due to refusal of the employer.

Initially, many prefectures refused to allow foreigners from entering the National Health Insurance (&quot;Kokumin Kenkou Hoken&quot;) as foreigners were not considered to be eligible. The policy was revised to include foreigners after local governments witnessed healthcare disparities between Japanese citizens and foreigners. A study conducted revealed that incidences of increased poor health was high among the foreign workers living in the Tochigi Prefecture. A quarter of these workers did not visit clinics or hospitals, due to language barriers and high medical costs. Nearly 60% of the 317 workers surveyed experienced difficulty in communicating in English.

Some hospitals have been known to turn patients away if they could not confirm their residence status. The NTT Medical Center Tokyo, located in the Gotanda district of Tokyo, announced on their website that foreigners must present their insurance card &quot;and&quot; residence cards. If they were unable to then they would be denied service, with the exception of emergency cases. A maternity ward, located in Tokyo, had stated on their website that services would be limited for patients who could only speak at a conversational level in Japanese.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many ethnic-minority healthcare providers have been found to not be assigned to treating patients with the COVID-19 infection. Possible reasons for this include the low number of ethnic-minority healthcare providers working in Japan&#x27;s clinics and hospitals, as well as language barriers.

==History==
===Pre-war xenophobia===
Racial discrimination against other Asians was habitual in Imperial Japan, which first practiced it during the start of Japanese colonialism. The Meiji era Japanese were contemptuous of other Asians because they believed that other Asians were inferior to them. This sentiment was expressed in &quot;Datsu-A Ron&quot;, an editorial whose author espoused the belief that Japan should treat other Asians as other western empires treated them. Discrimination was also enacted against Ryūkyū and Ainu peoples. The Shōwa regime preached racial superiority and racialist theories, based on the nature of &quot;Yamato-damashii.&quot; According to historian Kurakichi Shiratori, one of Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s teachers: &quot;Therefore nothing in the world compares to the divine nature () of the imperial house and likewise the majesty of our national polity (&quot;kokutai&quot;). Here is one great reason for Japan&#x27;s superiority.&quot; The Japanese culture long regarded Gaijin (non-Japanese) people to be subhumans and included Yamato master race theory ideology in government propaganda and schools as well.

As stated in &quot;An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus&quot;, a classified report which was published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare on July 1, 1943, just as a family has harmony and reciprocity, but with a clear-cut hierarchy, the Japanese, as a racially superior people, are destined to rule Asia &quot;eternally&quot; as the head of the family of Asian nations. The most horrific xenophobia of the pre-Shōwa period was displayed after the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, where in the confusion after a massive earthquake, Koreans were wrongly maligned as poisoning the water supply. A vicious pogrom resulted in the deaths of at least 3,000 Koreans, and the imprisonment of 26,000.

In the 1930s, the number of attacks on Westerners and their Japanese friends by nationalist citizens increased due to the influence of Japanese military-political doctrines in the early years of the Showa period, these attacks occurred after a long build-up which started in the Meiji period, when a few &quot;samurai&quot; die-hards refused to accept foreigners in Japan. For an exception, see Jewish settlement in the Japanese Empire.

===World War II===
Racism was omnipresent in the press during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Greater East Asia War and the media&#x27;s descriptions of the superiority of the Yamato people was unwaveringly consistent. The first major anti-foreigner publicity campaign, called (Guard Against Espionage), was launched in 1940 alongside the proclamation of the (New Order in East Asia) and its first step, the &quot;Hakkō ichiu&quot;. Initially, in order to justify Japan&#x27;s conquest of Asia, Japanese propaganda espoused the ideas of Japanese supremacy by claiming that the Japanese represented a combination of all Asian peoples and cultures, emphasizing heterogeneous traits. Japanese propaganda started to place an emphasis on the ideas of racial purity and the supremacy of the Yamato race when the Second Sino-Japanese War intensified.

Mostly after the launching of the Pacific War, Westerners were detained by official authorities, and on occasion were objects of violent assaults, sent to police jails or military detention centers or suffered bad treatment in the street. This applied particularly to Americans, Soviets and British; in Manchukuo at the same period xenophobic attacks were carried out against Chinese and other non-Japanese.

At the end of World War II, the Japanese government continued to adhere to the notion of racial homogeneity and racial supremacy, as well as an overall complex of social hierarchy, with the Yamato race at the top of the racial hierarchy. Japanese propaganda of racial purity returned to post-World War II Japan because of the support of the Allied forces. U.S. policy in Japan terminated the purge of high-ranking fascist war criminals and reinstalled the leaders who were responsible for the creation and manifestation of prewar race propaganda.

Similar to what would occur in Korea, the overwhelming presence of American soldiers, most of whom young and unmarried, had a noticeable effect on the Japanese female populace. The obvious power dynamic after the war outcome, as well as the lack of accountability for American soldiers who impregnated Japanese women, placed these children into a negative light before their lives even began. An unknown number of these children would be abandoned by their fathers. They would grow up associated with defeat and death in their own country and regarded as a reminder of Japanese subordination to a western power.

===Post-war government policy===

Because of the low importance placed on assimilating minorities in Japan, laws regarding ethnic matters receive low priority in the legislative process. Still, in 1997, &quot;Ainu cultural revival&quot; legislation was passed which replaced the previous &quot;Hokkaido Former Aboriginal Protection&quot; legislation that had devastating effects on the Ainu in the past.

Article 14 of the Constitution of Japan states that all &quot;people&quot; (English version) or &quot;citizens&quot; (revised Japanese version) are equal under the law, and they cannot be discriminated against politically, economically, or socially on the basis of race, belief, sex, or social or other background.

However, Japan does not have civil rights legislation which prohibits or penalizes discriminatory activities committed by citizens, businesses, or non-governmental organizations. In January 2024, three Japanese citizens, including a man of Pakistani descent, filed a civil lawsuit against the Japanese government, alleging a consistent pattern of racially motivated police harassment and requesting improved practices, along with approximately ¥3 million ($20,330) each in compensation. The uncommon lawsuit in Japan aims to demonstrate that racial discrimination violates the constitution and international human rights agreements. The plaintiffs, including two permanent residents and one foreign-born Japanese citizen, claim repeated unjustified stops and searches by the police based on their race, prompting concerns about the country&#x27;s ability to address the increasing diversity resulting from a growing number of foreign workers. The lawsuit names the Japanese government, the Tokyo Metropolitan, and Aichi prefecture governments.

Attempts have been made in the Diet to enact human rights legislation. In 2002, a draft was submitted to the House of Representatives, but did not reach a vote. Had the law passed, it would have set up a Human Rights Commission to investigate, name and shame, or financially penalize discriminatory practices as well as hate speech committed by private citizens or establishments.

Another issue which has been publicly debated but has not received much legislative attention is whether to allow permanent residents to vote in local legislatures. organizations affiliated with North Korea are against this initiative, while organizations affiliated with South Korea support it.

Finally, there is debate about altering requirements for work permits to foreigners. As of 2022, the Japanese government does not issue work permits unless it can be demonstrated that the person has certain skills which cannot be provided by locals.

===Comment by a U.N. special rapporteur on racism and xenophobia===
In July 2005, a United Nations special rapporteur on racism and xenophobia expressed concerns about deep and profound racism in Japan and the Japanese government&#x27;s insufficient recognition of the problem.

Doudou Diène (Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights) concluded after an investigation and nine-day tour of Japan that racial discrimination and xenophobia in Japan primarily affect three groups: national minorities, the descendants of people from former Japanese colonies, and foreigners from other Asian countries. John Lie, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, believes that the widespread belief that Japan is an ethnically homogeneous society is inaccurate because Japan is a multiethnic society. Such claims have long been rejected by other sectors of Japanese society such as the former Japanese Prime Minister Tarō Asō, who once described Japan as a nation which is inhabited by people who are members of &quot;one race, one civilization, one language and one culture&quot;.

While it expressed support for anti-discrimination efforts, &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot;, a Japanese national newspaper, expressed doubt about the impartiality of the report, pointing out that Doudou Diène never visited Japan before and his short tour was arranged by a Japanese NGO, IMADR (International Movement Against All Forms of Discrimination). The chairman of the organization is Professor Kinhide Mushakoji (), who is a board member (and the former director of the board) of the International Institute of the Juche Idea (主体思想国際研究所), an organization whose stated purpose is the propagation of &quot;Juche&quot;, the official ideology of North Korea.

In 2010, according to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Japan&#x27;s record on racism has improved, but there is still room for progress. The committee was critical of the lack of anti-hate speech legislation in the country and the treatment of Japanese minorities and its large Korean and Chinese communities. The &quot;Japan Times&quot; quoted committee member Regis de Gouttes as saying that there had been little progress since 2001 (when the last review was held) &quot;There is no new legislation, even though in 2001 the committee said prohibiting hate speech is compatible with freedom of expression.&quot; Many members of the committee, however, praised the Japanese government&#x27;s recent recognition of the Ainu as an indigenous people.

In February 2015, Ayako Sono, a former member of an educational reform panel, wrote a controversial column in Sankei Shimbun in which she suggested that more foreign workers should be imported in an attempt to alleviate labor shortages, but they should be separated from native Japanese with a system of apartheid. She later stated &quot;I have never commended apartheid, but I do think that the existence of a ‘Chinatown’ or ‘Little Tokyo’ is a good thing.&quot;

<text>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) is the national metrology institute of the Federal Republic of Germany, with scientific and technical service tasks. It is a higher federal authority and a public-law institution directly under federal government control, without legal capacity, under the auspices of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

== Tasks ==
Together with NIST in the USA and the NPL in Great Britain, PTB ranks among the leading metrology institutes in the world. As the National Metrology Institute of Germany, PTB is Germany&#x27;s highest and only authority in terms of correct and reliable measurements. The Units and Time Act Bundesgesetzblatt (Federal Law Gazette), volume 2008, part I, No. 28, p. 1185 ff., 11 July 2008] assigns all tasks which are related with the realization and dissemination of the units to PTB. All legally relevant aspects regarding the units as well as PTB’s responsibilities have been combined in this Act. Previously, all questions regarding the units as well as the role of PTB had been distributed among three laws: the Units Act, the Time Act, and the Verification Act.

PTB consists of nine technical-scientific divisions (two of them in Berlin), which are subdivided into approx. 60 departments. These again are subdivided into more than 200 working groups. PTB&#x27;s tasks are as follows: the determination of fundamental and natural constants; the realization, maintenance and dissemination of the legal units of the SI; and safety technology. This spectrum of tasks is supplemented by services such as the German Calibration Service (, DKD) and by metrology for the area regulated by law, metrology for industry, and metrology for technology transfer. As the basis for its tasks, PTB conducts fundamental research and development in the field of metrology in close cooperation with universities, other research institutions, and industry. PTB employs approximately 1900 staff members. It has a total budget of approx. €183 million at its disposal; in 2012, approx. €15 million was, in addition, canvassed as third-party funds for research projects.

The Units and Time Act entrusts PTB also especially with the dissemination of legal time in Germany. To have a time basis for this, PTB operates several atomic clocks (currently two cesium clocks and, since 1999 and 2009, respectively, two cesium fountain clocks). By order of PTB, the synchronization of clocks via radio is performed via the time signal transmitter DCF77 operated by Media Broadcast. Computers which are connected to the Internet can obtain the time also via the three public NTP time servers operated by PTB.

In Berlin-Adlershof, PTB operates the MLS (Metrology Light Source) electron storage ring for calibrations in the field from the infrared (THz) to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV).

Department Q.5 &quot;Technical Cooperation&quot; realizes projects of the German and international development cooperation in the field of quality infrastructure. These activities promote competitiveness as well as environmental protection and consumer protection in developing countries and in countries in transition. One of the tasks of PTB’s &quot;Metrological Information Technology&quot; Department – in accordance with the German Gambling Ordinance (§ 11 ff. SpielV) – is to grant type approvals for gaming machines which offer the possibility to make winnings. Also, according to the Federal Ordinance on Voting Machines, PTB is in charge of the type approval of voting computers. This is, however, moot as, in a judgment of 3 March 2009, the Federal Constitutional Court has declared the use of such voting machines to be inadmissible.

Weapons which may be carried with the Minor Firearms Certificate, i.e. weapons for shooting blanks or irritants and weapons used as signaling devices, require a PTB test mark for their approval. Occasionally, these weapons are also jointly referred to as &quot;PTB weapons&quot; and bear the PTA or PTB proof mark F (see also: Act on the Proof Testing of Arms and Ammunition).

== Sites and structure ==
The main site of PTB is in Braunschweig (Lehndorf-Watenbüttel). Other sites are in Berlin-Charlottenburg and Berlin-Adlershof. Divisions 1 to 6 as well as Division Q are located in Braunschweig. In Berlin-Charlottenburg Divisions 7 and 8 are located, and in Berlin-Adlershof the two electron storage rings BESSY II and the Metrology Light Source (MLS); the latter is located in the Willy Wien Laboratory.

PTB is headed by the Presidential Board in Braunschweig, which is composed of the President, the Vice-President and a further member. Another executive committee is the Directors&#x27; Conference, with the Presidential Board and the Heads of the Divisions as members. PTB is advised by the (PTB&#x27;s Advisory Board), which is composed of representatives from science, the economy and politics.

PTB is composed of the following nine divisions:
# Division 1: Mechanics and Acoustics (site: Braunschweig) with the following departments: Mass, Solid Mechanics, Velocity, Gas Flow, Liquid Flow, Sound, Acoustics and Dynamics
# Division 2: Electricity (site: Braunschweig) with the following departments: Direct Current and Low Frequency, High Frequency and Electromagnetic Fields, Electrical Energy Measuring Techniques, Quantum Electronics, Semiconductor Physics and Magnetism, Quantum Electrical Metrology
# Division 3: Chemical Physics and Explosion Protection (site: Braunschweig) with the following departments: Metrology in Chemistry, Analytics and Thermodynamic State Behavior of Gases, Thermophysical Quantities, Physical Chemistry, Explosion Protection in Energy Technology, Explosion Protection in Sensor Technology and Instrumentation, Fundamentals of Explosion Protection
# Division 4: Optics (site: Braunschweig) with the following departments: Photometry and Applied Radiometry, Imaging and Wave Optics, Quantum Optics and Unit of Length, Time and Frequency
# Division 5: Precision Engineering (site: Braunschweig) with the following departments: Surface Metrology, Dimensional Nanometrology, Coordinate Metrology, Interferometry on Material Measures, Scientific Instrumentation Department
# Division 6: Ionizing Radiation (site: Braunschweig) with the following departments: Radioactivity, Dosimetry for Radiation Therapy and Diagnostic Radiology, Radiation Protection Dosimetry, Ion and Neutron Radiation, Fundamentals of Dosimetry, Operational Radiation Protection
# Division 7: Temperature and Synchrotron Radiation (site: Berlin-Charlottenburg and Adlershof) with the following departments: Radiometry with Synchrotron Radiation, Cryophysics and Spectrometry, Detector Radiometry and Radiation Thermometry, Temperature, Heat and Vacuum
# Division 8: Medical Physics and Metrological Information Technology (site: Berlin-Charlottenburg) with the following departments: Medical Metrology, Biosignals, Biomedical Optics, Mathematical Modeling and Data Analysis, Metrological Information Technology
# The Presidential Staff Office and the Press and Information Office as well as the Divisions Z (Administrative Services) and Q (Scientific-technical Cross-sectional Tasks) report directly to the Presidential Board. Division Q comprises, among other things, the Academic Library, the Legal Metrology and Technology Transfer Departments, the Technical Services, and the Technical Cooperation Department.

== History ==
Two essential factors which led to the founding of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (Imperial Physical Technical Institute – PTR) were the determination of internationally valid, uniform measures in the Meter Convention of 1875 and the dynamic industrial development in Germany in the 19th century. Already in the Franco-German War (1870/71), the stagnation in scientific mechanics and in the science of instruments had become evident in Germany. Increasingly precise metrology was required for industrial production. A considerable impact on the initiative for the founding of a state institute for metrology in order to promote the national interests of the economy, of trade and of the military was made – in particular – by the upcoming electrical industry under the direction of the inventor and industrialist Werner von Siemens. In contrast to the units of length and weight, no recognized methods and standards existed at that time in the field of electrical metrology. The lack of reliable and verifiable measurement methods for the realization of electrical (and other) measurement units was a pressing scientific and economic problem.

In 1872, some Prussian natural scientists joined forces and demanded the establishment of a state institute in order to solve this problem. The reason for this was that such a task was scientifically too ambitious for industrial laboratories and, in addition, not profitable for them, and classical training institutes were not suited for the task either. Among the supporters of the &quot;Schellbach Memorandum&quot; (named after its author Karl Heinrich Schellbach) ranked, among others, Hermann von Helmholtz and the mathematician and physicist Wilhelm Foerster. Prussia, however, initially rejected their demands.

Not until some years later were Werner von Siemens and Hermann von Helmholtz, the &quot;founding fathers&quot; of the PTR, able to make their vision – the establishment of a research institute which was to link scientific, technical and industrial interests in an optimal way – come true. Finally, on 28 March 1887, the Imperial Diet approved the first annual budget of the PTR – the founding of the first state-financed, university-external, major research institution in Germany which combined free fundamental research with services for industry. Werner von Siemens ceded private land in Berlin-Charlottenburg to the Reichsanstalt. Hermann von Helmholtz became its first president. At that time, 65 persons were employed at the PTR – among them more than a dozen physicists – who disposed of a budget of 263,000 Reichsmarks. In its first decades, the PTR succeeded in attracting important scientists and members of the Kuratorium as employees, among them Wilhelm Wien, Friedrich Kohlrausch, Walther Nernst, Emil Warburg, Walther Bothe, Albert Einstein and Max Planck.

=== Birth of quantum physics ===
The first outstanding scientific achievement at the PTR was also closely connected with Max Planck. To decide whether electricity or gas would be more economic for street lighting in Berlin, the PTR was to develop a more precise standard for luminous intensity. For this purpose, in 1895, Otto Lummer and Wilhelm Wien developed the first cavity radiator for the practical generation of thermal radiation. Their measurements of the spectrum of the black-body radiation were so precise that they contradicted Wien&#x27;s radiation law at long wavelengths. This caused one of the cornerstones of classical physics of that time to totter. The measurements prompted a decisive impulse on the part of Max Planck to divide thermal radiation – in an &quot;act of despair&quot;, as he later declared – into separate portions. This was the birth of quantum physics.

=== New structure and new physics ===
In 1914, the PTR President Emil Warburg discontinued the subdivision into a physical and a technical division and re-structured the PTR into divisions for optics, electricity and heat, with sub-divisions of a purely scientific and technical nature. Under Warburg&#x27;s successor Walther Nernst, the Reichsanstalt für Maß und Gewicht (Imperial Institute for Weights and Measures – RMG) was, in addition, integrated into the PTR. A newly established division took over from the RMG extensive tasks with regard to the verification system as well as the measurements of length, weight and volume associated with the verification system. The profile of tasks was thus similar to that of PTB today: Through its own research and development, and through services building on this, the PTR was to ensure the uniformity of metrology and its continuous further development. As regards contents, the PTB was dedicated at that time to the so-called New Physics. This included, among other things, research on the newly discovered X-rays, new atomic models, Einstein&#x27;s Special Theory of Relativity, quantum physics (based on the already mentioned work on the black-body radiator), and the investigation of the properties of the electron. Scientists like Hans Geiger, who established the first radioactivity laboratory of PTR, were involved in this research work. Walther Meißner succeeded in liquefying helium, which led him to the discovery of the superconductivity of a series of metals. In this connection, he recognized some years later – together with his colleague Robert Ochsenfeld – that superconductors have the property of displacing from their interior a magnetic field which has been applied from the outside – the Meißner-Ochsenfeld Effect.

=== Nazi Germany ===
With the appointment of Johannes Stark as president on 1 May 1933, the ideology of National Socialism found its way into the PTR. The convinced advocate of a German Physics terminated diverse research projects on issues of modern physics to which he referred to as &quot;Jewish&quot;, among them, in particular, works on quantum physics and on the theory of relativity. Stark also tried to enforce the &quot;Führer principle&quot; (Führerprinzip) at the PTR: in 1935, he dissolved the Kuratorium and took over its competences himself. Jewish employees and critics of the NSDAP (such as Max von Laue) were dismissed. After World War II, Von Laue participated in the re-founding of PTB. Albert Einstein, who had been thrown out of the Kuratorium already before its dissolution, broke ties to PTR/PTB.

Under Stark and – after 1939 – under his successor Abraham Esau, the PTR strongly dedicated itself to armament research. A newly founded laboratory for acoustics was not only to investigate general – but mainly also military – fields of application. This included, among other things, the acoustic finding of artillery, the military utilization of ultrasound and the development of decoding procedures. In addition, researchers of PTR developed acoustic mines and a steering system for torpedoes which orientated itself on the sound field of traveling ships. Due to its classical metrological tasks, the PTR was also closely connected with the armament industry of the Third Reich. Since exact measures are a basic requirement for the manufacture of military equipment, the PTR gained a key role in armament production and defense. The extent to which the PTR was also involved in the German nuclear weapons project is controversial. It is, however, known that – prior to his time as PTR president – Abraham Esau conducted – until 1939 – a group of researchers dealing with nuclear fission. Later, he took over the specialist area &quot;nuclear fission&quot; in the Reich Research Council which supervised, from spring 1942 on, the German uranium project. Shortly after that, Hermann Göring subordinated the working group under the former PTR physicist Kurt Diebner to Division V for atomic physics at the PTR. Esau received the title &quot;Authorized Representative of the Reichsmarschall for Nuclear Physics&quot;, a post which he, however, ceded to Walther Gerlach already at the end of 1943.

To escape the bombing raids of the allies, the PTR was, in 1943, relocated at the initiative of the president and Thuringian privy councillor Abraham Esau to different places in Germany (for example to Weida and Ronneburg in Thuringia and to Bad Warmbrunn in Lower Silesia). During the attacks on Berlin, the buildings of the PTR were heavily damaged. In 1945, the Reichsanstalt was virtually destroyed and the few departments which still existed were scattered all over the country.

=== Re-founding of PTB in Braunschweig and other PTR successors ===
Approximately from 1947 on, successor institutes were developed in addition to the PTR in Berlin-Charlottenburg, i.e. one in East Berlin – for the Soviet Occupation Zone – and one in the Bizone – and later Trizone. With the well-meaning support of the British Military Government, parts of the old Reichsanstalt were established in Braunschweig. The idea for this re-founding had been developed by the former PTR advisor for theoretical physics, Max von Laue, already during his internment in Farm Hall. In 1947, he succeeded in convincing the British authorities to make the former Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt (Aeronautical Research Institute) in Völkenrode near Braunschweig available to the PTR successor. In 1948, Wilhelm Kösters, who had been the director of Division 1 in Berlin for many years, became its first president. Many former PTR employees from Berlin, Weida and Heidelberg followed him to Braunschweig. The new institute was named ꞋꞋPhysikalisch-Technische AnstaltꞋꞋ (PTA) and, since 1 April 1950, ꞋꞋPhysikalisch-Technische BundesanstaltꞋꞋ. In 1953, the West Berlin PTR was integrated into this institute as ꞋꞋBerlin InstituteꞋꞋ while respecting the four-power status of Berlin.

In the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the Deutsches Amt für Maß und Gewicht (DAMG) had established itself with its principle seat in Berlin. After several renamings, this institute was designated Amt für Standardisierung, Meßwesen und Warenprüfung (Office for Standardization, Metrology and Quality Control – ASMW) during the last GDR years; the name already indicates that this office of the GDR had more extensive tasks than PTB in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), namely additional tasks in the field of standardization and quality assurance and in the area of activity of the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM).

=== Growth and reunification ===
The young PTB grew rapidly in the years after its founding – both in terms of staff and in terms of financial resources. Not only its scientific metrological profile was extended, but also its palette of services rendered to industry, in particular in the form of calibrations of measuring instruments. In the 1970s, this led to the founding of the Deutscher Kalibrierdienst (German Calibration Service), which delegated service tasks to accredited, privately run laboratories and allowed PTB to concentrate itself on more demanding measurement tasks.

From 1967 to 1995, PTB operated the Experimental and Research Reactor Braunschweig. This reactor served in particular as neutron source for fundamental research, not for the investigation of nuclear energy. PTB dealt with this controversial subject from 1977 to 1989, above all due to the fact that the task &quot;long-term management and disposal of radioactive waste&quot; had been assigned to it. Later on, this field of work passed over to the ″Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz″ (Federal Office for Radiation Protection) after same had been newly established. Today, PTB’s Division 6 deals with ionizing radiation in general. This also includes a highly sensitive trace survey station for radionuclides which has been measuring radioactive substances in ground-level air for more than 50 years.

The &quot;Wende&quot; (&quot;political change&quot;) in Germany in 1990 also led to a &quot;reunification in metrology&quot;. PTB took over parts of the ASMW (Office for Standardization, Metrology and Quality Control of the former German Democratic Republic), among them 400 employees, and the site Berlin-Friedrichshagen as additional field office (this has since been given up again). Other parts of the ASMW were integrated into the BAM. Despite a phase of staff reductions – after the strong expansion following reunification – PTB ranks today among the largest national metrology institutes in the world. As such, it is in charge of the realization and dissemination of the physical units and promotes the worldwide uniformity of metrology.

== Journals ==

The PTB magazine , which is published approximately once a year, can be subscribed to free of charge or it can be downloaded from the Internet pages of PTB. It contains articles about the quantities of physics. These articles are intended to be generally understandable and informative for the broad public.

In addition, PTB publishes the scientific information bulletin PTB-news three times a year. On four pages, it contains news from the fields of work &quot;Fundamentals of Metrology&quot;, &quot;Applied Metrology for Industry&quot;, &quot;Medicine and Environmental Protection&quot;, &quot;Metrology for Society&quot; and &quot;International Affairs&quot;. The PTB-news are published in German and in English.

PTB-Mitteilungen is the metrological specialist journal and the official information bulletin of PTB. It is published four times a year and contains original scientific articles as well as overview articles on metrological subjects from PTB&#x27;s fields of activity. Each volume focuses on a main topic. As an official information bulletin, the journal stands in a long tradition which goes back to the beginnings of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (Imperial Technical Physical Institute - PTR, founded in 1887). Until 2014, &quot;PTB-Mitteilungen&quot; was also the official bulletin in which the type approvals granted by PTB as well as the tests and conformity assessments carried out by PTB were published in a section of its own [named &quot;Amtliche Bekanntmachungen&quot; (&quot;Official Notes&quot;)]. With the new Measures and Verification Act which has been in force since 1 January 2015 and with the new Measures and Verification Ordinance, there is no longer a legal basis for these notices. From 2015 onwards, &quot;PTB-Mitteilungen&quot; is, therefore, a purely metrological specialist journal and does not publish any &quot;Official Notes&quot; any more.

<text>DCF77 is a German longwave time signal and standard-frequency radio station. It started service as a standard-frequency station on 1 January 1959. In June 1973, date and time information was added. Its primary and backup transmitter are located at in Mainflingen, about south-east of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The transmitter generates a nominal power of 50 kW, of which about 30 to 35 kW can be radiated via a T-antenna.

DCF77 is controlled by the &quot;Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt&quot; (PTB), Germany&#x27;s national physics laboratory and transmits in continuous operation (24 hours). It is operated by &quot;Media Broadcast GmbH&quot; (previously a subsidiary of &quot;Deutsche Telekom AG&quot;), on behalf of the PTB. With Media Broadcast GmbH, a temporal transmission availability of at least 99.7% per year or under 26.28 hours of annual downtime has been agreed upon. Most service interruptions are short-term disconnections of under two minutes. Longer lasting transmission service interruptions are generally caused by strong winds, freezing rain or snow-induced T-antenna movement. This manifests itself in electrical detuning of the antenna resonance circuit and hence a measurable phase modulation of the received signal. When the maladjustment is too large, the transmitter is taken out of service temporarily. In the year 2002, almost 99.95% availability, or just over 4.38 hours of downtime, was realized. The timestamp sent is either in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)+1 or UTC+2 depending on daylight saving time.

The highly accurate 77.5 kHz ( wavelength) carrier signal is generated from local atomic clocks that are linked with the German master clocks at the PTB in Braunschweig. The DCF77 time signal is used for the dissemination of the German national legal time to the public.

Radio clocks and watches have been very popular in Europe since the late 1980s and, in mainland Europe, most of them use the DCF77 signal to set their time automatically. The DCF77 longwave radio emission offers penetration into buildings and the time-transmissions can be received by small ferrite antennas incorporated in the case of radio-controlled low-cost time keepers without the help of exterior antennas. The accuracy of the DCF77 amplitude-modulated time signals suffices for the every-day use of clocks and watches by consumers where primarily the long-term accuracy matters. Further industrial time-keeping systems at railway stations, in the field of telecommunication and information technology, and at radio and TV stations are radio-controlled by DCF77 as well as tariff change-over clocks of energy supply companies and clocks in traffic-light facilities.

== Location of Antennas ==
According to the Air-Line distance is 350 m between Primary and Backup Antenna. At an receiver location in Northwest or Southeast direction there is a maximum transit time formula_1 and as a minimum exactly orthogonal the transit time difference vanishes. The value for other geographical direction is somewhere in between.

==Signal==


===Time signal===
The DCF77 station signal carries an amplitude-modulated, pulse-width coded 1 bit/s data signal. The same data signal is also phase modulated onto the carrier using a 512-bit long pseudorandom sequence (direct-sequence spread spectrum modulation). The transmitted data signal is repeated every minute.
* Current date and time bits;
* Leap second warning bit;
* Imminent change of CET to CEST, or vice versa, Announcement bit;
* Central European Time (CET) / Central European Summer Time (CEST) bit;
* Abnormal transmitter operation identification bit;
* Several parity bits.

===Experimental civil defence emergency signal===
Since 2003, fourteen previously unused bits of the time code have been used for civil defence emergency signals. This is an experimental service, aimed to one day replace the German network of civil defence sirens.

===Civil protection and weather forecast signal===
Since 22 November 2006, the DCF77 transmitter uses bits 1–14 to transmit warning messages and weather information. Under responsibility of the German Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (the German &quot;Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe&quot;, BBK), warnings to the population can be transmitted using these 14 bits. As a further extension of the information content transmitted by DCF77, appropriately equipped radio clocks can provide a four-day weather forecast for 60 different regions in Europe. The forecast data is provided by and under responsibility of the Swiss company Meteo Time GmbH and is transferred in a proprietary transfer protocol. The same 14 bits are employed in a way that ensures compatibility with the transmission protocols of the warning messages. For decoding, the weather forecast data a license is required. Since the bits previously reserved for the PTB are used, older radio clocks should not be affected by the weather data signal.

===Future and call sign===
The signal distribution contract between the PTB and the DCF77 transmitter operator Media Broadcast GmbH is periodically renewed. After negotiations in 2021, the PTB and Media Broadcast GmbH agreed to continue the dissemination of the German national legal time for the next 10 years. In order to improve the reliability of the broadcast and also the ease of maintenance by the operator, Media Broadcast GmbH has announced that it will build a second remote-controllable high-performance transmitter in 2022. The facilities will then be completely duplicated on site. In the past the PTB expressed it will initialize new negotiations if modernization activities at the transmitting station to improve the signal reception reliability throughout Europe are deemed necessary.

The call sign DCF77 stands for D = &quot;Deutschland&quot; (Germany), C = long wave signal, F = Frankfurt am Main as the umbrella regional unit, 77 = frequency: 77.5 kHz.

== Time code details ==
Like most longwave time transmitters (akin to the 162 kHz 800 kW TDF time signal broadcast from France), DCF77 marks seconds by reducing carrier power for an interval beginning on the second. The duration of the reduction is varied to convey one bit of time code per second, repeating every minute. The carrier is synchronized so the rising zero-crossing occurs on the second. All modulation changes also occur at rising zero-crossings.

=== Amplitude modulation ===
The DCF77 signal uses amplitude-shift keying to transmit digitally coded time information by reducing the amplitude of the carrier to 15% of normal (−16½ dB) for 0.1 or 0.2 seconds at the beginning of each second. A 0.1 second reduction (7750 cycles of the 77500 Hz carrier amplitude) denotes a binary 0; a 0.2 second reduction denotes a binary 1. As a special case, the last second of every minute is marked with no carrier power reduction.

There was also a Morse code station identification until 2006, sent during minutes 19, 39 and 59 of each hour, however this was discontinued as the station is easily identifiable by the characteristic signal. A 250 Hz tone was generated by square wave modulating the carrier between 100% and 85% power, and that tone was used to send one letter per second, between the second marks. During seconds 20–32, the call sign &quot;DCF77&quot; was transmitted twice.

=== Phase modulation ===
In addition, for 793 ms beginning at 200 ms, each time code bit is transmitted using direct-sequence spread spectrum. The bit is mixed with a 512-bit pseudo-random chip sequence and encoded on the carrier using ±15.6° phase-shift keying. The chip sequence contains equal amounts of each phase, so the average phase remains unchanged. Each chip spans 120 cycles of the carrier, so the exact duration is cycles 15500 through 76940 out of 77500. The last 560 cycles (7.23 ms) of each second are not phase-modulated.

The chip sequence is generated by a 9-bit linear feedback shift register (LFSR), repeats every second, and begins with 00000100011000010011100101010110000….

A software implementation of a Galois LFSR can generate the full chip sequence:

 unsigned int i, lfsr;
 lfsr = 0;

 for (i = 0; i &lt; 512; i++) {
 unsigned int chip;

 chip = lfsr &amp; 1;
 output_chip(chip);

 lfsr »= 1;
 if (chip || !lfsr)
 lfsr ^= 0x110;


Each time code bit to be transmitted is exclusive-ored with the LFSR output. The final chipped sequence is used to modulate the transmitter phase. During 0 chips the carrier is transmitted with a +15.6° phase advance, while during 1 chips it is transmitted with a −15.6° phase lag.

In lieu of the special minute marker used in the amplitude code, bit 59 is transmitted as an ordinary 0-bit, and the first 10 bits (seconds 0–9) are transmitted as binary 1.

When compared to amplitude modulation, phase modulation makes better use of the available frequency spectrum and results in a more precise low frequency time distribution with less sensitivity to interferences. Phase modulation is however not used by many DCF77 receivers. The reason for this is the worldwide availability of the (precise time reference) signals transmitted by global navigation satellite systems like the Global Positioning System (GPS), GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou. Due to the GPS signal structure and the larger bandwidth available, the GPS reception would, in principle, achieve an uncertainty of the time transmission that is lower by at least one order of magnitude than the uncertainty that can be achieved with DCF77 phase modulation receiving hardware (GPS time is accurate to about ± 10 to 30 nanoseconds and the Galileo April, May, June 2021 Quarterly Performance Report by the European GNSS Service Centre reported the UTC Time Dissemination Service Accuracy was ≤ 4.3 ns, computed by accumulating samples over the previous 12 months and exceeding the ≤ 30 ns target).

=== Time code interpretation ===
The time is represented in binary-coded decimal. It represents civil time, including summer time adjustments. The time transmitted is the time of the &quot;following&quot; minute; e. g. during 31 December, 23:59, the transmitted time encodes 1 January, 00:00.

The first 20 seconds are special flags. The minutes are encoded in seconds 21–28, hours during seconds 29–34, and the date during seconds 36–58.

Two flags warn of changes to occur at the end of the current hour: a change of time zones, and a leap second insertion. These flags are set during the hour up to the event. This includes the last minute before the event, during which the other time code bits (including the time zone indicator bits) encode the time of the first minute after the event.

In the event of an added leap second, a 0-bit is inserted during second 59, and the special missing bit is transmitted during the leap second itself, second 60.

Although the time code only includes two digits of year, it is possible to deduce two bits of century using the day of week. There is still a 400-year ambiguity, as the Gregorian calendar repeats weeks every 400 years, but this is sufficient to determine which years ending in 00 are leap years.

The time zone bits can be considered a binary-coded representation of the UTC offset. Z1 set indicates UTC+2, while Z2 indicates UTC+1.

The phase modulation generally encodes the same data as the amplitude modulation, but differs for bits 59 through 14, inclusive. Bit 59 (no amplitude modulation) is phase-modulated as a 0-bit. Bits 0–9 are phase modulated as 1 bits, and bits 10–14 are phase modulated as 0 bits. The civil protection warnings and weather information is not included in the phase-modulated data.

==Reception area==

With a relatively high power of , the DCF77 transmissions can reliably be received in large parts of Europe, as far as from the transmitter in Mainflingen. Within this range the signal strength of the DCF77 signal as specified by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) is ≥ 100 μV/m. This signal strength assessment was made according to the reflection model with a reflection (one hop) on the ionospheric D-layer. As an example, reception with consumer grade clocks — assuming the employed radio clock can manage reception with ≈ 100 μV/m signal strength — is possible in Norway (Bodø), Russia (Moscow), Turkey (Istanbul), Gibraltar and Portugal (during night hours). Metal structures or interference caused by other electronic devices can cause reception problems within this range. At shorter distances the DCF77 signal strength is much higher. As an example, under from the transmitter in Mainflingen the expected signal strength of the ground wave is ≥ 1 mV/m.

Depending on signal propagation and multiple reflections (hops) and local interference the DCF77 signal can sometimes be received further away (see tropospheric propagation). This is associated with a significant decrease in the signal strength and depends on many factors, e.g., the daytime and season, the angle of incidence of the skywave on the D-layer and the solar activity.

==Control==
The control signal is not transmitted by wire from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig to the transmitting radio station in Mainflingen but is generated at the place of emission using a control unit developed by the PTB. This control unit, which is housed in an air conditioned room of the transmitting station, is shielded against high-frequency interferences and controlled from Braunschweig. For reasons of operational reliability, the control signal is generated by three independent control channels all equipped with their own caesium atomic clock. In addition a rubidium atomic clock is available on site. To avoid incorrect emissions the output of these three channels are compared in two electronic switch circuits on site. Output for transmission is only generated when at least two of the three channels are in agreement. Via the public telephone network operational data of the control unit can be called up with the aid of a telecontrol system. Furthermore, the carrier phase time and the states of the second markers are compared in Braunschweig with the setpoints specified by the PTB&#x27;s atomic master clocks that provide the UTC (PTB). Of these atomic clocks, the CS2 atomic clock in Braunschweig provides the German national legal time standard, and can be used as a highly accurate frequency standard.
If there are deviations, the necessary corrections will be made via the telecontrol system.

==Accuracy==

===Transmission===
The DCF77 transmitted carrier frequency relative uncertainty is 2 × 10−12 over a 24-hour period and 2 × 10−13 over 100 days, with a deviation in phase with respect to UTC that never exceeds 5.5 ± 0.3 microseconds. The four German primary caesium (fountain) atomic clocks (CS1, CS2, CSF1 and CSF2) in use by the PTB in Braunschweig ensure significantly less long term clock drift than the atomic clocks used in the DCF77 facility in Mainflingen. With the aid of external corrections from Braunschweig the control unit of DCF77 in Mainflingen is expected to neither gain nor lose a second in approximately 300,000 years.

In theory, a DCF77 controlled external clock should be able to synchronize to within one half of the period of the transmitted 77.5 kHz carrier frequency of the DCF77 signal, or within ± 6.452 × 10−6 s or ± 6.452 microseconds.

===Reception===
Due to the propagation process, phase and/or frequency shifts observed in received signals the practical obtainable accuracy is lower than originally realized with the atomic clocks at the place of transmission. As with any time signal radio transmitter the precise establishment of time is affected by the distance to the transmitter, as the time signal propagates to a time signal receiver at the speed of light. For a DCF77 receiver located away from the DCF77 transmitter, due to transit delay the receiver will be set more than 3 milliseconds late. Such a small deviation will seldom be of interest and if desired instrument grade time receivers can be corrected for transit delay.

Further inaccuracies may be caused by the type of wave the receiver records. If pure ground wave reception is anticipated and the reception location is permanent a constant may be included in the calculation, while in the case of pure space waves the receiver cannot compensate for the fluctuations since these are the result of the changing altitude of the reflecting and bending layer of the ionosphere. Similar problems arise where ground and skywaves overlap. This field is not constant but changes in the course of the day between approximately from the transmitter position.

Corrected instrument grade DCF77 receivers, using the amplitude-modulated time signals with accompanying antennas oriented tangential to the transmitter&#x27;s antenna in Mainflingern to ensure the best possible interference-free time signal reception at fixed locations, can achieve a practical accuracy uncertainty better than ± 2 milliseconds.

In addition to the amplitude-modulated time signal transmission this information is also transmitted since June 1983 by DCF77 via a phase modulation of the carrier wave with a pseudorandom noise sequence of 512 bits length. Using cross-correlation the reproduced signal at the receiving end can be used to determine the beginning of the second markers much more accurately. The drawback of using phase-modulated time signals lies in the complex instrument grade receiving hardware required for using this time signal reception method. Using this method the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) measured standard deviations of ± 2 to 22 microseconds between UTC (PTB) and UTC (DCF77), depending on the time in the day and season. This was done in Braunschweig located from the transmitter in Mainflingen.

Normal low cost consumer grade DCF77 receivers solely rely on the amplitude-modulated time signals and use narrow band receivers (with 10 Hz bandwidth) with small ferrite loopstick antennas and circuits with non optimal digital signal processing delay and can therefore only be expected to determine the beginning of a second with a practical accuracy uncertainty of ± 0.1 second. This is sufficient for radio controlled low cost consumer grade clocks and watches using standard-quality quartz clocks for timekeeping between daily DCF77 synchronization attempts, as they will be most accurate immediately after a successful synchronization and will become less accurate from that point forward until the next synchronization. Some DCF77 controlled consumer grade quartz movements promote accurate time keeping by synchronizing and correcting their time automatically more than once spread over a day.

== Network Time Protocol reference clock use ==
Network Time Protocol time servers display the reference ID (REFID) &quot;.DCFa.&quot; (amplitude modulation) or &quot;.DCFp.&quot; (phase modulation) when a standard DCF77 time receiver is used as the reference time source.

<text>The Dumbbell Nebula (also known as the Apple Core Nebula, Messier 27, and NGC 6853) is a planetary nebula (nebulosity surrounding a white dwarf) in the constellation Vulpecula, at a distance of about 1360 light-years. It was the first such nebula to be discovered, by Charles Messier in 1764. At its brightness of visual magnitude 7.5 and diameter of about 8 arcminutes, it is easily visible in binoculars and is a popular observing target in amateur telescopes.

The Dumbbell Nebula appears shaped like a prolate spheroid and is viewed from our perspective along the plane of its equator. In 1992, Moreno-Corral et al. computed that its rate of expansion angularly was, viewed from our distance, no more than (″) per century. From this, an upper limit to the age of 14,600 years may be determined. In 1970, Bohuski, Smith, and Weedman found an expansion velocity of . Given its semi-minor axis radius of , this implies that the kinematic age of the nebula is 9,800 years.

Like many nearby planetary nebulae, the Dumbbell contains knots. Its central region is marked by a pattern of dark and bright cusped knots and their associated dark tails (see picture). The knots vary in appearance from symmetric objects with tails to rather irregular tail-less objects. Similarly to the Helix Nebula and the Eskimo Nebula, the heads of the knots have bright cusps which are local photoionization fronts.

The central star, a white dwarf progenitor, is estimated to have a radius which is (0.13 light seconds) which gives it a size larger than most other known white dwarfs. Its mass was estimated in 1999 by Napiwotzki to be .

<doc id="336125" wikidata="Q1020942" url="?curid=336125" title="Chatsworth, Los Angeles">
<text>Chatsworth is a suburban neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, in the San Fernando Valley. The area around the town was home to Native Americans, who left caves containing rock art. Chatsworth was explored and colonized by the Spanish beginning in the 18th century. The land was part of a Spanish land grant, Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando. After the United States took over the land following the Mexican–American War, it was the largest such grant in California. Chatsworth has seven public and eight private schools. There are large open-space and smaller recreational parks as well as a public library and a transportation center. Landmarks in the town include the former Chatsworth Reservoir and the Santa Susana Field Laboratory.
The neighborhood has one of the lowest population densities in Los Angeles and a relatively high income level. Chatsworth is the home of the Iverson Movie Ranch, a 500-acre area which was the most filmed movie ranch in history, as more than 2,000 productions used it as a filming location.

==Population==

The 2000 U.S. census counted 35,073 residents in the Chatsworth neighborhood, or 2,301 people per square mile, among the lowest population densities for both the city and the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 37,102. In 2000, the median age for residents was 40, considered old for city and county neighborhoods; the percentages of residents aged 35 and older were among the county&#x27;s highest.

The neighborhood was considered to be ethnically &quot;moderately diverse&quot; for both the city of Los Angeles and its county, with a relatively high percentage of whites and Asian people, and a sizable Hispanic/Latino community. The population was 65.7% Non-Hispanic White, 14.4% Asian, 13.5% Hispanic or Latin, 2.2% Black, and 4.2% of other origins. Among the 25.2% of residents born abroad - a low figure for Los Angeles - Korea (10.4%) and the Philippines (9.3%) were the most common places of birth.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $84,456, considered to be a high income for the city. The percentages of families that earned more than $40,000 was considered high for the county. Renters occupied 28.9% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 71.1%. The average household size of 2.6 people was considered average for Los Angeles.

In 2000, there were 2,933 military veterans, or 10.8% of the population, a high percentage compared to the rest of the city. The percentage of married people was among the county&#x27;s highest. The rate of 10% of families headed by single parents was low for the city.

==Geography==
Chatsworth is flanked by the Santa Susana Mountains on the north, Porter Ranch and Northridge on the east, Winnetka, Canoga Park, West Hills on the south, the Simi Hills, and unincorporated Los Angeles County and Ventura County on the west, and Twin Lakes, a community founded by San Francisco&#x27;s George Haight in the early 20th century and unincorporated Los Angeles County which includes a 1,600 acre park with equestrian trails, to the north.

==Climate==
This region experiences hot and dry summers, with average daily high temperatures of 90–100 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Chatsworth has a Mediterranean climate.

==History==

===Indigenous===
Chatsworth was inhabited by the Tongva, Chumash, and Tataviam. They inhabited the valley for an estimated 8,000 years. Stoney Point is the site of the Tongva village of &quot;Momonga&quot;, which was also a trading place with the neighboring Tataviam and Chumash people. The nearby Burro Flats Painted Cave remains a legacy of the Chumash culture&#x27;s rock art and solstice ceremony spirituality.

===Spain and Mexico===
The first European explorers came into the Chatsworth area on August 5, 1769, led by the Spanish military leader Gaspar de Portolà. With its establishment in 1797 and subsequent Spanish Land Grant by the King of Spain, Mission San Fernando (Mission San Fernando Rey de España) gained dominion over the San Fernando Valley&#x27;s lands, including future Chatsworth.

The Native American trail that had existed from the Tongva-Tatavium village called rancheria Santa Susana (Chatsworth) to another village, replaced by Mission San Fernando, became the route for missionaries and other Spanish travel up and down California. It was part of the &quot;El Camino del Santa Susana y Simi&quot; trail that connected the Valley&#x27;s Mission, Los Angeles pueblo (town), and the southern missions with the Mission San Buenaventura, the Presidio of Monterey, and the northward missions. The trail crossed over the Santa Susana Pass to the Simi Valley, through present day city park Chatsworth Park South and the Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park. In 1795, the Spanish land grant had been issued for Rancho Simi, reconfirmed in 1842 by the Mexican governor. Its lands included part of current Chatsworth, westward from Andora Avenue.

In 1821, after the Mexican War of Independence from Spain, the Mission San Fernando became part of Alta California, Mexico. In 1834, the Mexican government began redistributing the mission lands. In 1846, the Mexican land grant for Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando was issued by Governor Pío Pico. It was bounded on the north by Rancho San Francisco and the Santa Susana Mountains, on the west by the Simi Hills, on the east by Rancho Tujunga, and on the south by the Montañas de Portesuelo (Santa Monica Mountains). The Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando received a Federal land patent to retain ownership by the United States Public Land Commission in 1873 and was the single largest land grant in California.

===Chatsworth===
The Chatsworth Historical Society was formed in 1963 in an effort to successfully save the historic Pioneer Church from demolition. The society and Chatsworth Museum are located in Chatsworth Park South at Los Angeles Cultural Historical Monument No. 133, the Homestead Acre . In addition to preserving Chatsworth history and educating the public, the society acts as conservator of the Homestead Acre.

In 1869, the grantee&#x27;s son, Eulogio F. de Celis, returned from Spain to Los Angeles. In 1874, the family sold their northern half of Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando to northern Californians, California State Senator Charles Maclay and his partners George K. Porter, a San Francisco shoe manufacturer, and his cousin Benjamin F. Porter. The Porters&#x27; land was west of present-day Sepulveda Boulevard including most of Chatsworth, and the Maclay land was east of Sepulveda Boulevard.

The Old Santa Susana Stage Road or Santa Susana Wagon Road continued in use as an alternative to the route along El Camino Viejo from 1861 to 1875, replacing the older road as the main route between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The downgrade from the Santa Susana Pass into Chatsworth was known as &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Slide&quot;. A new wagon route bypassing the deteriorating Devil&#x27;s Slide was opened in 1895. Initially called &quot;El Camino Nuevo&quot; (the New Road), it was later named the Chatsworth Grade Road, which continued in use until Santa Susana Pass Road (now Old Santa Susana Pass Road) was built in 1917. In 1876, the Southern Pacific Railroad opened a tunnel through the Newhall Pass, enabling rail connections from Los Angeles north to San Francisco, and rail travel soon replaced travel by stagecoach between Los Angeles and San Francisco. From this time, the stagecoach traffic to Santa Barbara once again used the coast route, and the Santa Susana Pass road was relegated to local traffic. Construction of the 118 Ronald Reagan Freeway through the Santa Susana Pass began in 1968 with major traffic now bypassing Santa Susana Pass Road.

The Chatsworth name, which hails from the stately Chatsworth House in England, was first recorded in 1888, when George R. Crow filed with the Los Angeles County Recorder&#x27;s Office a map of the San Fernando Valley with a subdivision he called &quot;Chatsworth Park&quot;. William Booth Barber, the president of the San Fernando Valley Improvement Company, was born in England 17 miles from the Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s palatial estate, Chatsworth House. In 1893 W.B. Barber filed an additional map with the Recorder&#x27;s Office called the &quot;Plat of Chatsworth Park Townsite&quot;.

===Chatsworth Reservoir===

A distinctive feature in Chatsworth is the Chatsworth Dam and reservoir. Built in 1918 as part of the Los Angeles Aqueduct system, the property belongs to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Due to increasing concerns of the water quality because of algae plumes and storm water inflow, it was taken out of service in August 1969. After the 1971 San Fernando earthquake additional concerns for seismic safety led to its abandonment by the LADWP as a storage facility.
Chatsworth Oaks Park and the Chatsworth Nature Preserve are located here giving views of migrating birds and other animals, and their sounds such as the coyotes calling in the evening. The views of the rocky and dramatic Simi Hills surround the open space.

Chatsworth Reservoir is classified by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as a city neighborhood, but &quot;because there are relatively few homes in this area,&quot; the &quot;Times&quot; does not provide separate statistics for it, but adds them to Chatsworth. The Devonshire and Topanga stations of the Los Angeles Police Department provide services in the area.

==Economy==
Chatsworth is the home of the National Notary Association and the headquarters for Premier America (formerly Litton Federal Credit Union) and Matadors Community Credit Union.

The Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL), once busy with Rocketdyne testing rocket engines and Atomics International doing nuclear research, is quiet and high in the Simi Hills west of Chatsworth. It has been closed, will undergo an extensive environmental cleanup, and will become an open-space park. The park will permanently add to Chatsworth&#x27;s scenic backdrop, greenway, and hiking opportunities.

Some of the current large employers based in Chatsworth are Capstone Turbine, Natel Engineering, and Hydraulics International. Lamps Plus has production and distribution facilities in Chatsworth.

Titus Software&#x27;s United States subsidiary once had its headquarters in Chatsworth.

<text>Messier 107 or M107, also known as NGC 6171 or the Crucifix Cluster, is a very loose globular cluster in a very mildly southern part of the sky close to the equator in Ophiuchus, and is the last such object in the Messier Catalogue. 

==Observational history, namings and guide==
It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in April 1782, then independently by William Herschel in 1793. Herschel&#x27;s son, John, in his 1864 General Catalogue, described it as a &quot;globular cluster of stars, large, very rich, very much compressed, round, well resolved, clearly consisting of stars&quot;. It was not until 1947 that Helen Sawyer Hogg added it and three other objects found by Méchain to the modern Catalogue, the latter having contributed several of the suggested observation objects which Messier had verified and added. The cluster is to be found 2.5° south and slightly west of the star Zeta Ophiuchi.

==Properties==
M107 is close to the galactic plane and about 20,900 light-years from Earth and from the Galactic Center. Its orbit is partly as far out as the galactic halo, as is between from the Galactic Center, the lower figure, the &quot;perigalactic distance&quot; sees it enter and leave the galactic bar. 

It is an Oosterhoff type I cluster with a metallicity of −0.95 and it conforms with the bulk of the halo population. There are 22 known RR Lyrae variable stars in this cluster and a probable SX Phoenicis variable.

<doc id="336138" wikidata="Q474837" url="?curid=336138" title="Amphidromic point">
<text>An amphidromic point, also called a tidal node, is a geographical location where there is little or no difference in sea height between high tide and low tide; it has zero tidal amplitude for one harmonic constituent of the tide. The tidal range (the peak-to-peak amplitude, or the height difference between high tide and low tide) for that harmonic constituent increases with distance from this point, though not uniformly. As such, the concept of amphidromic points is crucial to understanding tidal behaviour. The term derives from the Greek words &quot;amphi&quot; (&quot;around&quot;) and &quot;dromos&quot; (&quot;running&quot;), referring to the rotary tides which circulate around amphidromic points. It was first discovered by William Whewell, who extrapolated the cotidal lines from the coast of the North Sea and found that the lines must meet at some point.

Amphidromic points occur because interference within oceanic basins, seas and bays, combined with the Coriolis effect, creates a wave pattern — called an amphidromic system — which rotates around the amphidromic point. At the amphidromic points of the dominant tidal constituent, there is almost no vertical change in sea level from tidal action; that is, there is little or no difference between high tide and low tide at these locations. There can still be tidal currents since the water levels on either side of the amphidromic point are not the same. A separate amphidromic system is created by each periodic tidal component.

In most locations the &quot;principal lunar semi-diurnal&quot;, known as &quot;M&quot;2, is the largest tidal constituent. Cotidal lines connect points which reach high tide at the same time and low tide at the same time. In Figure 1, the low tide lags or leads by 1 hr 2 min from its neighboring lines. Where the lines meet are amphidromes, and the tide rotates around them; for example, along the Chilean coast, and from southern Mexico to Peru, the tide propagates southward, while from Baja California to Alaska the tide propagates northward.

== Formation of amphidromic points ==
Tides are generated as a result of gravitational attraction by the Sun and Moon. This gravitational attraction results in a tidal force that acts on the ocean. The ocean reacts to this external forcing by generating, in particular relevant for describing tidal behaviour, Kelvin waves and Poincaré waves (also known as Sverdrup waves). These tidal waves can be considered wide, relative to the Rossby radius of deformation (~3000 km in the open ocean), and shallow, as the water depth (&quot;D&quot;, on average ~4 kilometre deep) in the ocean is much smaller (i.e. &quot;D&quot;/&quot;λ&quot; &lt;1/20) than the wavelength (&quot;λ&quot;) which is in the order of thousands of kilometres.
In real oceans, the tides cannot endlessly propagate as progressive waves. The waves reflect due to changes in water depth (for example when entering shelf seas) and at coastal boundaries. The result is a reflected wave that propagates in the opposite direction to the incident wave. The combination of the reflected wave and the incident wave is the total wave. Due to resonance between the reflected and the incident wave, the amplitude of the total wave can either be suppressed or amplified. The points at which the two waves amplify each other are known as antinodes and the points at which the two waves cancel each other out are known as nodes. Figure 2 shows a λ resonator. The first node is located at λ of the total wave, followed by the next node reoccurring λ farther at λ.

A long, progressive wave travelling in a channel on a rotating Earth behaves differently from a wave travelling along a non-rotating channel. Due to the Coriolis force, the water in the ocean is deflected towards the right in the northern hemisphere and conversely in the southern hemisphere. This side-way component of the flow due to the Coriolis force causes a build-up of water that results in a pressure gradient. The resulting slope develops until it is equilibrium with the Coriolis force; resulting in geostrophic balance. As a result of this geostrophic balance, Kelvin waves (originally described by Lord Kelvin) and Poincaré waves are generated. The amplitude of a Kelvin wave is highest near the coast and, when considering a wave on the northern hemisphere, decreases to further away from its right-hand coastal boundary. The propagation of Kelvin waves is always alongshore and its amplification falls off according to the Rossby radius of deformation. In contrast, Poincaré waves are able to propagate both alongshore as a free wave with a propagating wave pattern and cross-shore as a trapped wave with a standing wave pattern.

=== Infinitely long channel ===
In an infinitely long channel, which can be viewed upon as a simplified approximation of the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean, the tide propagates as an incident and a reflective Kelvin wave. The amplitude of the waves decreases further away from the coast and at certain points in the middle of the basin, the amplitude of the total wave becomes zero. Moreover, the phase of the tide seems to rotate around these points of zero amplitude. These points are called amphidromic points. The sense of rotation of the wave around the amphidromic point is in the direction of the Coriolis force; anticlockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere.

=== Semi-enclosed basin ===

In a semi-enclosed basin, such as the North Sea, Kelvin waves, though being the dominant tidal wave propagating in alongshore direction, are not able to propagate cross shore as they rely on the presence of lateral boundaries or the equator. As such, the tidal waves observed cross-shore are predominantly Poincaré waves. The tides observed in a semi-enclosed basin are therefore chiefly the summation of the incident Kelvin wave, reflected Kelvin wave and cross-shore standing Poincaré wave. An animation of the tidal amplitude, tidal currents and its amphidromic behaviour is shown in Animation 2.

=== Position of amphidromic points ===
Figure 2 shows that the first node of the total wave is located at λ with reoccurring nodes at intervals of λ. In an idealized situation, amphidromic points can be found at the position of these nodes of the total tidal wave. When neglecting friction, the position of the amphidromic points would be in the middle of the basin, as the initial amplitude and the amplitude decay of the incident wave and the reflected wave are equal, this can be seen in Animations 1 and 2 However, tidal waves in the ocean are subject to friction from the seabed and from interaction with coastal boundaries. Moreover, variation in water depth influences the spacing between amphidromic points.

Firstly, the distance between amphidromic points is dependent on the water depth:

formula_1

Where &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration, &quot;D&quot; is the water depth and &quot;T&quot; is the period of the wave.

Locations with more shallow water depth have their amphidromic points closer to each other as the distance of the interval (λ) of the nodes decreases. Secondly, energy losses due to friction in shallow seas and coastal boundaries result in additional adjustments of the tidal pattern. Tidal waves are not perfectly reflected, resulting in energy loss which causes a smaller reflected wave compared to the incoming wave. Consequently, on the northern hemisphere, the amphidromic point will be displaced from the centre line of the channel towards the left of the direction of the incident wave.

The degree of displacement on the northern hemisphere for the first amphidrome is given by:

formula_2

Where γ is the displacement of the amphidrome from the centre of the channel (&quot;γ&quot;=0), &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration, &quot;D&quot; is the water depth, &quot;f&quot; is the Coriolis frequency and &quot;α&quot; is the ratio between amplitudes of the reflected wave and the incident wave. Because the reflected wave is smaller than the incident wave, &quot;α&quot; will be smaller than 1 and &quot;lnα&quot; will be negative. Hence the amphidromic displacement &quot;γ&quot; is to the left of the incident wave on the northern hemisphere.

Furthermore, a study has shown than there is a pattern of amphidrome movement related to spring-neap cycles in the Irish Sea. The maximum displacement of the amphidrome from the centre coincides with spring tides, whereas the minimum occurs at neaps. During spring tides, more energy is absorbed from the tidal wave compared to neap tides. As a result, the reflection coefficient &quot;α&quot; is smaller and the displacement of the amphidromic point from the centre is larger. Similar amphidromic movement is expected in other seas where energy dissipation due to friction is high.

It can occur that the amphidromic point moves inland of the coastal boundary. In this case, the amplitude and the phase of the tidal wave will still rotate around an inland point, which is called a virtual or degenerate amphidrome.

=== Amphidromic points and sea level rise ===
The position of amphidromic points and their movement predominantly depends on the wavelength of the tidal wave and friction. As a result of enhanced greenhouse gas emissions, the oceans in the world are becoming subject to sea-level rise. As the water depth increases, the wavelength of the tidal wave will increase. Consequently the position of the amphidromic points located at λ in semi-enclosed systems will move further away from the cross-shore coastal boundary. Furthermore, amphidromic points will move further away from each other as the interval of λ increases. This effect will be more pronounced in shallow seas and coastal regions, as the relative water depth increase due to sea-level rise will be larger, when compared to the open ocean. Moreover, the amount of sea-level rise differs per region. Some regions will be subject to a higher rate of sea-level rise than other regions and nearby amphidromic points will be more susceptible to change location. Lastly, sea-level rise results in less bottom friction and therefore less energy dissipation. This causes the amphidromic points to move further away from the coastal boundaries and more towards the centre its channel/basin.

==In the &quot;M&quot;2 tidal constituent==
Based on Figure 1, there are the following clockwise and anticlockwise amphidromic points:

=== Clockwise amphidromic points ===
* north of the Seychelles
* near Enderby Land
* off Perth
* east of New Guinea
* south of Easter Island
* west of the Galapagos Islands
* north of Queen Maud Land

=== Counterclockwise amphidromic points ===
* near Sri Lanka
* north of New Guinea
* at Tahiti
* between Mexico and Hawaii
* near the Leeward Islands
* east of Newfoundland
* midway between Rio de Janeiro and Angola
* east of Iceland
*Outside Eigersund in southwestern Norway
* The islands of Madagascar and New Zealand are amphidromic points in the sense that the tide goes around them in about 12 and a half hours, but the amplitude of the tides on their coasts is in some places large.

<text>In computer science, a skip list (or skiplist) is a probabilistic data structure that allows formula_1 average complexity for search as well as formula_1 average complexity for insertion within an ordered sequence of formula_3 elements. Thus it can get the best features of a sorted array (for searching) while maintaining a linked list-like structure that allows insertion, which is not possible with a static array. Fast search is made possible by maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences, with each successive subsequence skipping over fewer elements than the previous one (see the picture below on the right). Searching starts in the sparsest subsequence until two consecutive elements have been found, one smaller and one larger than or equal to the element searched for. Via the linked hierarchy, these two elements link to elements of the next sparsest subsequence, where searching is continued until finally searching in the full sequence. The elements that are skipped over may be chosen probabilistically or deterministically, with the former being more common.

== Description ==
A skip list is built in layers. The bottom layer formula_4 is an ordinary ordered linked list. Each higher layer acts as an &quot;express lane&quot; for the lists below, where an element in layer formula_5 appears in layer formula_6 with some fixed probability formula_7 (two commonly used values for formula_7 are formula_9 or formula_10). On average, each element appears in formula_11 lists, and the tallest element (usually a special head element at the front of the skip list) appears in all the lists. The skip list contains formula_12 (i.e. logarithm base formula_13 of formula_3) lists.

A search for a target element begins at the head element in the top list, and proceeds horizontally until the current element is greater than or equal to the target. If the current element is equal to the target, it has been found. If the current element is greater than the target, or the search reaches the end of the linked list, the procedure is repeated after returning to the previous element and dropping down vertically to the next lower list. The expected number of steps in each linked list is at most formula_13, which can be seen by tracing the search path backwards from the target until reaching an element that appears in the next higher list or reaching the beginning of the current list. Therefore, the total &quot;expected&quot; cost of a search is formula_16 which is formula_17, when formula_7 is a constant. By choosing different values of formula_7, it is possible to trade search costs against storage costs.

=== Implementation details ===

The elements used for a skip list can contain more than one pointer since they can participate in more than one list.

Insertions and deletions are implemented much like the corresponding linked-list operations, except that &quot;tall&quot; elements must be inserted into or deleted from more than one linked list.

formula_20 operations, which force us to visit every node in ascending order (such as printing the entire list), provide the opportunity to perform a behind-the-scenes derandomization of the level structure of the skip-list in an optimal way, bringing the skip list to formula_1 search time. (Choose the level of the i&#x27;th finite node to be 1 plus the number of times it is possible to repeatedly divide i by 2 before it becomes odd. Also, i=0 for the negative infinity header as there is the usual special case of choosing the highest possible level for negative and/or positive infinite nodes.) However this also allows someone to know where all of the higher-than-level 1 nodes are and delete them.

Alternatively, the level structure could be made quasi-random in the following way:

 make all nodes level 1
 j ← 1
 while the number of nodes at level j &gt; 1 do
 for each i&#x27;th node at level j do
 if i is odd and i is not the last node at level j
 randomly choose whether to promote it to level j+1
 else if i is even and node i-1 was not promoted
 promote it to level j+1
 end if
 repeat
 j ← j + 1
 repeat

Like the derandomized version, quasi-randomization is only done when there is some other reason to be running an formula_20 operation (which visits every node).

The advantage of this quasi-randomness is that it doesn&#x27;t give away nearly as much level-structure related information to an adversarial user as the de-randomized one. This is desirable because an adversarial user who is able to tell which nodes are not at the lowest level can pessimize performance by simply deleting higher-level nodes. (Bethea and Reiter however argue that nonetheless an adversary can use probabilistic and timing methods to force performance degradation.) The search performance is still guaranteed to be logarithmic.

It would be tempting to make the following &quot;optimization&quot;: In the part which says &quot;Next, for each &quot;i&quot;th...&quot;, forget about doing a coin-flip for each even-odd pair. Just flip a coin once to decide whether to promote only the even ones or only the odd ones. Instead of formula_23 coin flips, there would only be formula_1 of them. Unfortunately, this gives the adversarial user a 50/50 chance of being correct upon guessing that all of the even numbered nodes (among the ones at level 1 or higher) are higher than level one. This is despite the property that there is a very low probability of guessing that a particular node is at level &quot;N&quot; for some integer &quot;N&quot;.

A skip list does not provide the same absolute worst-case performance guarantees as more traditional balanced tree data structures, because it is always possible (though with very low probability) that the coin-flips used to build the skip list will produce a badly balanced structure. However, they work well in practice, and the randomized balancing scheme has been argued to be easier to implement than the deterministic balancing schemes used in balanced binary search trees. Skip lists are also useful in parallel computing, where insertions can be done in different parts of the skip list in parallel without any global rebalancing of the data structure. Such parallelism can be especially advantageous for resource discovery in an ad-hoc wireless network because a randomized skip list can be made robust to the loss of any single node.

=== Indexable skiplist ===
As described above, a skip list is capable of fast formula_1 insertion and removal of values from a sorted sequence, but it has only slow formula_20 lookups of values at a given position in the sequence (i.e. return the 500th value); however, with a minor modification the speed of random access indexed lookups can be improved to formula_1.

For every link, also store the width of the link. The width is defined as the number of bottom layer links being traversed by each of the higher layer &quot;express lane&quot; links.

For example, here are the widths of the links in the example at the top of the page:

 1 10
 o---&gt; o---------------------------------------------------------&gt; o Top level
 1 3 2 5
 o---&gt; o---------------&gt; o---------&gt; o---------------------------&gt; o Level 3
 1 2 1 2 3 2
 o---&gt; o---------&gt; o---&gt; o---------&gt; o---------------&gt; o---------&gt; o Level 2
 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
 o---&gt; o---&gt; o---&gt; o---&gt; o---&gt; o---&gt; o---&gt; o---&gt; o---&gt; o---&gt; o---&gt; o Bottom level
 Head 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th NIL
 Node Node Node Node Node Node Node Node Node Node

Notice that the width of a higher level link is the sum of the component links below it (i.e. the width 10 link spans the links of widths 3, 2 and 5 immediately below it). Consequently, the sum of all widths is the same on every level (10 + 1 = 1 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2).

To index the skip list and find the i&#x27;th value, traverse the skip list while counting down the widths of each traversed link. Descend a level whenever the upcoming width would be too large.

For example, to find the node in the fifth position (Node 5), traverse a link of width 1 at the top level. Now four more steps are needed but the next width on this level is ten which is too large, so drop one level. Traverse one link of width 3. Since another step of width 2 would be too far, drop down to the bottom level. Now traverse the final link of width 1 to reach the target running total of 5 (1+3+1). 
 function lookupByPositionIndex(i)
 node ← head
 i ← i + 1 &quot;# don&#x27;t count the head as a step&quot;
 for level from top to bottom do
 while i ≥ node.width[level] do &quot;# if next step is not too far&quot;
 i ← i - node.width[level] &quot;# subtract the current width&quot;
 node ← node.next[level] &quot;# traverse forward at the current level&quot;
 repeat
 repeat
 return node.value
 end function

==History==
Skip lists were first described in 1989 by William Pugh.

To quote the author:

==Usages==
List of applications and frameworks that use skip lists:
*Apache Portable Runtime implements skip lists.
*MemSQL uses lock-free skip lists as its prime indexing structure for its database technology.
*MuQSS, for the Linux kernel, is a CPU scheduler built on skip lists.
*Cyrus IMAP server offers a &quot;skiplist&quot; backend DB implementation
*Lucene uses skip lists to search delta-encoded posting lists in logarithmic time.
* The &quot;QMap&quot; key/value dictionary (up to Qt 4) template class of Qt is implemented with skip lists.
*Redis, an ANSI-C open-source persistent key/value store for Posix systems, uses skip lists in its implementation of ordered sets.
* Discord uses skip lists to handle storing and updating the list of members in a server.
* RocksDB uses skip lists for its default Memtable implementation.

Skip lists are also used in distributed applications (where the nodes represent physical computers, and pointers represent network connections) and for implementing highly scalable concurrent priority queues with less lock contention, or even without locking, as well as lock-free concurrent dictionaries. There are also several US patents for using skip lists to implement (lockless) priority queues and concurrent dictionaries.

<text>The 1968 Summer Paralympics () were the third Paralympic Games to be held. Organised under the guidance of the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF), they were known as the 17th International Stoke Mandeville Games at the time. The games were originally planned to be held alongside the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, but in 1966, the Mexican government decided against it due to difficulties. The Israeli government offered to host the games in Tel Aviv, a suggestion that was accepted.

The opening ceremony took place in the Hebrew University stadium at the Givat Ram campus in Jerusalem and the games took place in Ramat Gan, Tel Aviv District, at the Israel Sports Center for the Disabled. The closing ceremony took place in the Tel Aviv Trade Center. Therefore, these games were the first in Paralympic history to not be held concurrently with the Olympic Games.

== Sports ==

Lawn bowls was included in the program for the first time. In wheelchair basketball, a women&#x27;s team event was added, as was a 100 m wheelchair race for men in athletics.

* Archery
* Dart archery
* Athletics
* Lawn bowls
* Snooker
* Swimming
* Table tennis
* Weightlifting
* Wheelchair basketball
* Wheelchair fencing

== Medal table ==
The top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below. The host nation, Israel, is highlighted.

== Participating delegations ==
Twenty-eight delegations took part in the Tel Aviv Paralympics. Canada, Denmark, Ethiopia, India, Jamaica, New Zealand, South Korea and Spain took part in the Summer Paralympics for the first time.

Having made its Paralympic Games début four years earlier, South Africa continued to compete at the Paralympics, by sending a delegation to the Tel Aviv Games. It was, at the time, banned from the Olympic Games due to its policy of apartheid, but it was not banned from the Paralympics until 1980 Summer Paralympics in Arnhem.

<text>Babesiosis or piroplasmosis is a malaria-like parasitic disease caused by infection with a eukaryotic parasite in the order Piroplasmida, typically a &quot;Babesia&quot; or &quot;Theileria&quot;, in the phylum Apicomplexa. Human babesiosis transmission via tick bite is most common in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and parts of Europe, and sporadic throughout the rest of the world. It occurs in warm weather. People can get infected with &quot;Babesia&quot; parasites by the bite of an infected tick, by getting a blood transfusion from an infected donor of blood products, or by congenital transmission (an infected mother to her baby).
Ticks transmit the human strain of babesiosis, so it often presents with other tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease. After trypanosomes, &quot;Babesia&quot; is thought to be the second-most common blood parasite of mammals. They can have major adverse effects on the health of domestic animals in areas without severe winters. In cattle, the disease is known as Texas cattle fever or redwater.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Half of all children and a quarter of previously healthy adults with &quot;Babesia&quot; infection are asymptomatic. When people do develop symptoms, the most common are fever and hemolytic anemia, symptoms that are similar to those of malaria. People with symptoms usually become ill 1 to 4 weeks after the bite, or 1 to 9 weeks after transfusion of contaminated blood products. A person infected with babesiosis gradually develops malaise and fatigue, followed by a fever. Hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are destroyed and removed from the blood, also develops. Chills, sweats, and thrombocytopenia are also common symptoms. Symptoms may last from several days to several months.

Less common symptoms and physical exam findings of mild-to-moderate babesiosis:

In more severe cases, symptoms similar to malaria occur, with fevers up to 40.5 °C (105 °F), shaking chills, and severe anemia (hemolytic anemia). Organ failure may follow, including adult respiratory distress syndrome. Sepsis in people who have had a splenectomy can occur rapidly, consistent with overwhelming post-splenectomy infection. Severe cases are also more likely to occur in the very young, very old, and persons with immunodeficiency, such as HIV/AIDS patients.

A reported increase in human babesiosis diagnoses in the 2000s is thought to be caused by more widespread testing and higher numbers of people with immunodeficiencies coming in contact with ticks, the disease vector. Little is known about the occurrence of &quot;Babesia&quot; species in malaria-endemic areas, where &quot;Babesia&quot; can easily be misdiagnosed as &quot;Plasmodium&quot;. Human patients with repeat babesiosis infection may exhibit premunity.

==Cause==
&quot;Babesia&quot; species are in the phylum Apicomplexa, which also has the protozoan parasites that cause malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis. Four clades of &quot;Babesia&quot; species infect humans. The main species in each clade are:
# &quot;B. microti&quot; (&lt; 3 μm)
# &quot;B. duncani&quot;
# &quot;B. divergens&quot; (cattle parasite seen mostly in Europe) and &quot;B. venatorum&quot; (roe deer parasite, formerly called EU1), most closely related to the large &quot;Babesia&quot; clade
# Large&quot; Babesia&quot; (&gt; 3 μm) mostly infects ungulates, but also includes K01 strain (an isolated case observed in South Korea, see isolated cases)

== Pathophysiology ==

&quot;Babesia&quot; parasites reproduce in red blood cells, where they can be seen as cross-shaped inclusions (four merozoites asexually budding, but attached forming a structure looking like a &quot;Maltese cross&quot;) and cause hemolytic anemia, quite similar to malaria.

Unlike the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites that cause malaria, &quot;Babesia&quot; species rarely exhibit an exoerythrocytic phase with trophozoite forms.

In nonhuman animals, &quot;Babesia canis rossi&quot;, &quot;Babesia bigemina&quot;, and &quot;Babesia bovis&quot; cause particularly severe forms of the disease, including severe haemolytic anaemia, with positive erythrocyte-in-saline-agglutination test indicating an immune-mediated component to the haemolysis. Common sequelae include haemoglobinuria &quot;red-water&quot;, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and &quot;cerebral babesiosis&quot; caused by sludging of erythrocytes in cerebral capillaries.

In bovine species, the organism causes hemolytic anemia, so an infected animal shows pale mucous membranes initially. As the levels of bilirubin (a byproduct of red blood cell lysis) continue to increase, the visible mucous membranes become yellow (icterus) due to the failure of the liver to metabolize the excess bilirubin. Hemoglobinuria is seen due to the excretion of red-blood-cell lysis byproducts via the kidneys. A fever of 40.5 °C (105 °F) develops due to the release of inflammatory byproducts.

== Diagnosis ==
Only specialized laboratories can adequately diagnose &quot;Babesia&quot; infection in humans, so &quot;Babesia&quot; infections are considered highly under-reported. It develops in patients who live in or travel to an endemic area or receive a contaminated blood transfusion within the preceding 9 weeks, so this aspect of the medical history is vital. Babesiosis may be suspected when a person with such an exposure history develops persistent fevers and hemolytic anemia. The definitive diagnostic test is the identification of parasites on a Giemsa-stained thin-film blood smear.

So-called &quot;Maltese cross formations&quot; on the blood film are diagnostic (pathognomonic) of babesiosis since they are not seen in malaria, the primary differential diagnosis. Careful examination of multiple smears may be necessary, since &quot;Babesia&quot; may infect less than 1% of circulating red blood cells, thus be easily overlooked.

Serologic testing for antibodies against &quot;Babesia&quot; (both IgG and IgM) can detect low-level infection in cases with high clinical suspicion, but negative blood film examinations. Serology is also useful for differentiating babesiosis from malaria in cases where people are at risk for both infections. Since detectable antibody responses require about a week after infection to develop, serologic testing may be falsely negative early in the disease course.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has been developed for the detection of &quot;Babesia&quot; from the peripheral blood. PCR may be at least as sensitive and specific as blood-film examination in diagnosing babesiosis, though it is also significantly more expensive. Most often, PCR testing is used in conjunction with blood film examination and possibly serologic testing.

Other laboratory findings include decreased numbers of red blood cells and platelets on complete blood count.

In animals, babesiosis is suspected by observation of clinical signs (hemoglobinuria and anemia) in animals in endemic areas. Diagnosis is confirmed by observation of merozoites on a thin film blood smear examined at maximum magnification under oil using Romonovski stains (methylene blue and eosin). This is a routine part of the veterinary examination of dogs and ruminants in regions where babesiosis is endemic.

&quot;Babesia canis&quot; and &quot;B. bigemina&quot; are &quot;large &quot;Babesia&quot; species&quot; that form paired merozoites in the erythrocytes, commonly described as resembling &quot;two pears hanging together&quot;, rather than the &quot;Maltese cross&quot; of the &quot;small &quot;Babesia&quot; species&quot;. Their merozoites are around twice the size of small ones.

Cerebral babesiosis is suspected &quot;in vivo&quot; when neurological signs (often severe) are seen in cattle that are positive for &quot;B. bovis&quot; on blood smear, but this has yet to be proven scientifically. Outspoken red discoloration of the grey matter &quot;post-mortem&quot; further strengthens suspicion of cerebral babesiosis. Diagnosis is confirmed &quot;post-mortem&quot; by observation of &quot;Babesia&quot;-infected erythrocytes sludged in the cerebral cortical capillaries in a brain smear.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of asymptomatic carriers should be considered if parasites are still detected after 3 months. In mild-to-moderate babesiosis, the treatment of choice is a combination of atovaquone and azithromycin. This regimen is preferred to clindamycin and quinine because it has fewer side effects. The standard course is 7 to 10 days, but this is extended to at least 6 weeks in people with relapsing disease. Even mild cases are recommended to be treated to decrease the chance of inadvertently transmitting the infection by donating blood. In severe babesiosis, the combination of clindamycin and quinine is preferred. In life-threatening cases, exchange transfusion is performed. In this procedure, the infected red blood cells are removed and replaced with uninfected ones; toxins produced by the parasites may also be removed.

Imidocarb is a drug used for the treatment of babesiosis in dogs.
Extracts of the poisonous, bulbous plant &quot;Boophone disticha&quot; are used in the folk medicine of South Africa to treat equine babesiosis. &quot;B. disticha&quot; is a member of the daffodil family Amaryllidaceae and has also been used in preparations employed as arrow poisons, hallucinogens, and in embalming. The plant is rich in alkaloids, some of which display an action similar to that of scopolamine.

== Epidemiology ==
Babesiosis is a vector-borne illness usually transmitted by &quot;Ixodes scapularis&quot; ticks. &quot;B. microti&quot; uses the same tick vector as Lyme disease, and may occur in conjunction with Lyme. The organism can also be transmitted by blood transfusion. Ticks of domestic animals, especially &quot;Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus&quot; and &quot;R. (B.) decoloratus&quot; transmit several species of &quot;Babesia&quot; to livestock, causing considerable economic losses to farmers in tropical and subtropical regions.

In the United States, the majority of babesiosis cases are caused by &quot;B. microti&quot;, and occur in the Northeast and northern Midwest from May through October. Areas with especially high rates include eastern Long Island, Fire Island, Nantucket Island, and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now requires state health departments to report infections using Form OMB No. 0920-0728. In 2014, Rhode Island had an incidence of 16.3 reported infections per 100,000 people.

In Europe, &quot;B. divergens&quot; is the primary cause of infectious babesiosis and is transmitted by &quot;I. ricinus&quot;.

Babesiosis has emerged in the Lower Hudson Valley, New York, since 2001.

In Australia, one locally-acquired case of &quot;B. microti&quot; has been reported, which was fatal. A subsequent investigation found no additional evidence of human Babesiosis in over 7000 patient samples, leading the authors to conclude that Babesiosis was rare in Australia. A similar disease in cattle, commonly known as tick fever, is spread by &quot;Babesia bovis&quot; and &quot;B. bigemina&quot; in the introduced cattle tick &quot;Rhipicephalus microplus&quot;. This disease is found in eastern and northern Australia.

===Isolated cases===
A table of isolated cases of babesiosis, which may be underestimated given how widely distributed the tick vectors are in temperate latitudes.
==History==
The disease is named for the genus of the causative organism, which was named after the Romanian bacteriologist Victor Babeș. In 1888, Victor Babeș identified the microorganisms in red blood cells as the cause of febrile hemoglobinuria in cattle. In 1893, Theobald Smith and Frederick Kilborne discovered that a tick was the vector for transmission in Texas cattle. The agent was &quot;B. bigemina&quot;. This was the first demonstration that an arthropod could act as a disease vector to transmit an infectious agent to a vertebrate host.

In 1957, the first human case was documented in a splenectomized Croatian herdsman. The agent was &quot;B. divergens&quot;. In 1969, the first case was reported in an immunocompetent individual on Nantucket Island. The agent was &quot;B. microti&quot;, and the vector was the tick &quot;I. scapularis&quot;. Equine babesiosis (caused by the protozoan &quot;Theileria equi&quot;) is also known as piroplasmosis (from the Latin , meaning pear + Greek &quot;plasma&quot;, a thing formed).

==Other animals==
Veterinary treatment of babesiosis does not normally use antibiotics. In livestock and animals, diminazen (Berenil), imidocarb, or trypan blue would be the drugs of choice for treatment of &quot;B. canis rossi&quot; (dogs in Africa), &quot;B. bovis&quot;, and &quot;B. bigemina&quot; (cattle in Southern Africa). In acute cases in cattle, a blood transfusion may be carried out. A vaccine is effective against &quot;B. canis canis&quot; (dogs in the Mediterranean region), but is ineffective against &quot;B. c. rossi&quot;. &quot;B. imitans&quot; causes a mild form of the disease that frequently resolves without treatment (dogs in Southeast Asia).

<text>The 1972 Summer Paralympics (), the fourth edition of the Paralympic Games, were held in Heidelberg, West Germany, from 2 to 11 August 1972. Organised under the guidance of the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF), they were known as the 21st International Stoke Mandeville Games at the time. The games ended 15 days before the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich, also in West Germany.

== Sports ==

As with previous Paralympics, the 1972 games were intended for wheelchair athletes only. However, demonstration events such as goalball and a 100 m sprint for the visually impaired allowed visually impaired competitors to participate for the first time.

* Archery
* Athletics
* Dartchery
* &quot;Goalball (demonstration sport)&quot;
* Lawn bowls
* Snooker
* Swimming
* Table tennis
* Weightlifting
* Wheelchair basketball
* Wheelchair fencing

== Medal table ==

The top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below. The host nation, West Germany, is highlighted.
== Participating delegations ==
Forty-two delegations took part in the Heidelberg Paralympics. Bahamas, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Hong Kong, Hungary, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Poland, Romania, Uganda and Yugoslavia competed for the first time. 
Between 1964 and 1976, South Africa was competing at the Paralympics for the third time. Although banned from the Olympic Games due to its policy of apartheid, it was not banned from the Paralympics until 1980, and West Germany, as host country, did not object to its participation.

Rhodesia competed for the last time. Its invitation to take part in the 1972 Summer Olympics was withdrawn by the International Olympic Committee four days before the opening ceremony, in response to African countries&#x27; protests against the Rhodesian government. But as the Paralympics that year were held before the Olympics (and between 1968 and 1984 organised independently ), Rhodesia was able to take part in the 1972 Paralympic Games.

<text>The 1976 Summer Paralympics (), branded as Torontolympiad – 1976 Olympiad for the Physically Disabled, was the fifth Paralympic Games to be held. They were hosted by Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from 3 to 11 August 1976, marking the first time a Paralympics was held in the Americas and in Canada. The games began two days after the close of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.

==Context==
This was the first time global politics interfered with the Paralympic Games. &quot;The problem stemmed from the logic that admitting a team from South Africa was to give implicit approval for its government&#x27;s attitude towards segregation and racism.&quot; Although the South African team at the time was a multi-racial one, the Canadian government withdrew its CAD 500.000 contribution and &quot;matching amounts of funds were likely to be pulled out by the metropolitan government&quot;. The provincial government at Queen&#x27;s Park eventually covered the tab.

Two groups, both with the same President - Ludwig Guttmann - were involved in the decision-making: the International Sports Organisation for the Disabled and the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation. Guttman and Robert Jackson, Chairman of the Organizing Committee, worked to convince the Canadian government to honour their promises of support the teams without money to send their delegations and were largely successful. Nevertheless, a small number of African countries withdrew to participate in Paralympics, following on from the 1976 Summer Olympics when 25 countries boycotted the Games, and after this situation, those National Olympic Committees were threatened with exclusion from future events. Later, a series of efforts were made to develop a joint policy with the International Olympic Committee.

Rhodesia was not allowed to participate as the Canadian government refused to grant visas for the Rhodesian Paralympic team to attend the competition.

==Venues==

The opening of the 1976 games was held at Woodbine Race Track in north Etobicoke. There was no athletes&#x27; village, so competitors were housed at collegial campus of York University (Keele campus), University of Toronto (St. George Campus), and the CNIB national headquarters. Israeli athletes were housed in a fourth secret venue due the specific and undisclosed security concerns as the risk of a terrorist attack was real. Closing ceremonies and the athletics events took place at Centennial Park Stadium. Centennial Gymnasium and Centennial Park&#x27;s Olympic Pool were the venues for the swimming events.

==Media coverage==

The 1976 games marked the first time that there was television coverage of Paralympic events. Some events were shown live, with daily bulletins shown to viewers in Southern Ontario.
Within the Toronto area, a small consortium of local cable companies (including Trillium Cable and Rogers Cable) carried the games on channel 10 after CTV and Global TV declined to carry them.

==Sports==
At the 1976 games, amputees and visually impaired athletes competed for the first time; previous editions of the Paralympic Games had included only wheelchair athletes. Within the sport of athletics, new wheelchair racing distances of 200 m, 400 m, 800 m and 1500 m were added. Shooting and goalball, both previously demonstration events, were included as official medal sports.

* Archery
* Athletics
* Dartchery
* Goalball
* Lawn bowls
* Shooting
* Snooker
* Swimming
* Table tennis
* Volleyball
* Weightlifting
* Wheelchair basketball
* Wheelchair fencing

== Medal table ==

The top 10 NPCs by number of gold medals are listed below. The host nation, Canada, is highlighted.
== Participating delegations ==
Forty-one delegations took part in the Toronto Paralympics. Burma, Colombia, Ecuador, Greece, Guatemala, Indonesia and Luxembourg made their first appearances.

South Africa was competing at the Paralympics for the fourth time. Although banned from the Olympic Games due to its policy of apartheid, it was not banned from the Paralympics until 1980, and Canada, as host country, did not object to its participation. These were, however, to be its last Paralympics before the dismantling of apartheid; The Netherlands, as hosts of the 1980 Games, declared South Africa&#x27;s further participation &quot;undesirable&quot;.

<doc id="336175" wikidata="Q107211" url="?curid=336175" title="Jute">
<text>Jute ( ) is a long, rough, shiny bast fibre that can be spun into coarse, strong threads. It is produced from flowering plants in the genus &quot;Corchorus&quot;, of the mallow family Malvaceae. The primary source of the fiber is &quot;Corchorus olitorius&quot;, but such fiber is considered inferior to that derived from &quot;Corchorus capsularis&quot;.

Jute fibers, composed primarily of cellulose and lignin, are collected from bast (the phloem of the plant, sometimes called the &quot;skin&quot;) of plants like kenaf, industrial hemp, flax (linen), and ramie. The industrial term for jute fiber is &quot;raw jute&quot;. The fibers are off-white to brown and range from long. In Bangladesh, jute is called the &quot;golden fiber&quot; for its color and monetary value.

The bulk of the jute trade is centered in South Asia, with India and Bangladesh as the primary producers. The majority of jute is used for durable and sustainable packaging, such as burlap sacks. Its production and usage declined as disposable plastic packaging became common, but this trend has begun to reverse as merchants and even nations phase out or ban single-use plastics.

== Cultivation ==

The jute plant needs plain alluvial soil and standing water. During the monsoon season, the monsoon climate offers a warm and wet environment which is suitable for growing jute. Temperatures from and relative humidity of 70%–80% are favorable for successful cultivation. Jute requires of rainfall weekly, and more during the sowing time. Soft water is necessary for jute production.

===White jute (&quot;Corchorus capsularis&quot;)===
Historical documents (including &quot;Ain-e-Akbari&quot; by Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak in 1590) state that the poor villagers of India used to wear clothing made of jute. The weavers used simple hand-spinning wheels and hand looms, which they also used to spin cotton yarns. History also suggests that Indians, especially Bengalis, used ropes and twines made of white jute from ancient times for household and other uses. Jute is highly functional for carrying grains or other agricultural products.

===Tossa jute (&quot;Corchorus olitorius&quot;)===
Tossa jute (&quot;Corchorus olitorius&quot;) is a variety thought to be native to South Asia. It is grown for both fiber and culinary purposes. People use the leaves as an ingredient in a mucilaginous potherb called &quot;molokhiya&quot; (, of uncertain etymology), which is mainly used in some Arabic countries such as Egypt, Jordan, and Syria as a soup-based dish, sometimes with meat over rice or lentils. The King James translation of the Book of Job (chapter 30, verse 4), in the Hebrew Bible, mistranslates the word &quot;maluaḥ&quot;, which means Atriplex as &quot;mallow&quot;, which in turn has led some to identify this jute species as that what was meant by the translators, and led it to be called &#x27;Jew&#x27;s mallow&#x27; in English. It is high in protein, vitamin C, beta-carotene, calcium, and iron.

Bangladesh and other countries in Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific mainly use jute for its fiber. Tossa jute fiber is softer, silkier, and stronger than white jute. This variety shows good sustainability in the Ganges Delta climate. Along with white jute, tossa jute has also been cultivated in the soil of Bengal where has been known as &quot;paat&quot; since the start of the 19th century. Coremantel, Bangladesh, is the largest global producer of the tossa jute variety. In India, West Bengal is the largest producer of jute.

==History==

Jute has been used for making textiles in the Indus valley civilization since the 3rd millennium BC.

For centuries, jute has been a part of the culture of Bangladesh and some parts of West Bengal and Assam. The British started trading in jute during the seventeenth century. During the reign of the British Empire, jute was also used in the military. British jute barons grew rich by processing jute and selling manufactured products made from it. Dundee Jute Barons and the British East India Company set up many jute mills in Bengal, and by 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish jute trade. Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up jute factories. More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from Bengal to the trenches of World War I, and to the American South for bagging cotton. It was used in multiple industries, including the fishing, construction, art, and arms industries.

Due to its coarse and tough texture, jute could initially only be processed by hand, until someone in Dundee discovered that treating it with whale oil made it machine processable. The industry boomed throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (&quot;jute weaver&quot; was a recognized trade occupation in the 1901 UK census), but this trade largely ceased by about 1970, being substituted for by synthetic fibres. In the 21st century, jute has become a large export again, mainly in Bangladesh.

==Production==

The jute fiber comes from the stem and ribbon (outer skin) of the jute plant. The fibers are first extracted by retting, a process in which jute stems are bundled together and immersed in slow running water. There are two types of retting: stem and ribbon. After the retting process, stripping begins. In the stripping process, workers scrape off non-fibrous matter, then dig in and grab the fibers from within the jute stem.

Jute is a rain-fed crop with little need for fertilizer or pesticides, in contrast to cotton&#x27;s heavy requirements. Production in India is concentrated mostly in West Bengal. India is the world&#x27;s largest producer of jute, but imported approximately 162,000 tonnes of raw fiber and 175,000 tonnes of jute products in 2011. India, Pakistan, and China import significant quantities of jute fiber and products from Bangladesh, as do the United Kingdom, Japan, United States, France, Spain, Ivory Coast, Germany and Brazil. Jute and jute products formerly held the top position among Bangladesh&#x27;s most exported goods, although now they stand second after ready-made apparel. Annually, Bangladesh produces 7 to 8 million bales of raw jute, out of which 0.6 to 0.8 million bales are exported to international markets. China, India, and Pakistan are the primary importers of Bangladeshi raw jute.

==Genome==

In 2002, Bangladesh commissioned a consortium of researchers from University of Dhaka, Bangladesh Jute Research Institute (BJRI) and private software firm DataSoft Systems Bangladesh Ltd., in collaboration with the Centre for Chemical Biology, University of Science Malaysia and University of Hawaii, to research different fibers and hybrid fibers of jute. The draft genome of jute (&quot;Corchorus olitorius&quot;) was completed.

==Uses==
Jutes are relatively cheap and versatile fiber and have a wide variety of uses in cordage and cloth. It is commonly used to make burlap sacks.

The jute plant also has some culinary uses, which are generally focused on the leaves.

Due to its durability and biodegradability, jute matting is used as a temporary solution to prevent flood erosion.

Researchers have also investigated the possibility of using jute and glucose to build aeroplane panels.

===Fibers===


Individual jute fibers can range from very fine to very coarse, and the varied fibers are suited for a variety of uses.

The coarser fibers, which are called &quot;jute butts&quot;, are used alone or combined with other fibers to make many products:
* Hessian cloth
* Sacking
* Agricultural wrapping cloth, most notably wrapping for bales of raw cotton
* Sandbags
* Cloth backing for flooring, such as linoleum or carpet
* Cordage, such as twine or rope
* Pulp (for paper production)

Finer jute fibers can be processed for use in:
* Shoes, such as espadrilles
* Sweaters and cardigans
* Imitation silk
* Curtains
* Chair coverings
* Carpets
* Rugs

Jute was historically used in traditional textile machinery because jute fibers contain cellulose (vegetable fiber) and lignin (wood fiber). Later, several industries, such as the automotive, pulp and paper, furniture, and bedding industries, started to use jute and its allied fibers with their non-woven and composite technology to manufacture nonwoven fabric, technical textiles, and composites.

Jute is used in the manufacture of fabrics, such as Hessian cloth, sacking, scrim, carpet backing cloth (CBC), and canvas. Hessian is lighter than sacking, and it is used for bags, wrappers, wall-coverings, upholstery, and home furnishings. Sacking, which is a fabric made of heavy jute fibers, has its use in the name. CBC made of jute comes in two types: primary and secondary. Primary CBC provides a tufting surface, while secondary CBC is bonded onto the primary backing for an overlay. Jute packaging is sometimes used as an environmentally friendly substitute for plastic.

Other jute consumer products include floor coverings, high performance technical textiles, geotextiles, and composites. Jute has been used as a home textile due to its anti-static and color- and light-fast properties, as well as its strength, durability, UV protection, sound and heat insulation, and low thermal conductivity.

===Culinary uses===
&quot;Corchous olitorius&quot; leaves are used to make mulukhiya, which is sometimes considered the Egyptian national dish, and is also consumed in Cyprus and other Middle Eastern countries. These leaves are an ingredient in stews, typically cooked with lamb or chicken.

In India (West Bengal) and Bangladesh, in the Bengali cuisine, the fresh leaves are stir fried and eaten as &quot;path saak bhaja&quot; (পাঠ শাক ভাজা) along with a mustard sauce called &quot;kasundi&quot; (কাসুন্দি). The leaves are also eaten by making &quot;pakoras&quot; (পাঠ পাতার বড়া) with rice flour or Gram flour batter.

In Nigeria, leaves of &quot;Corchorus olitorius&quot; are prepared in sticky soup called &quot;ewedu&quot; together with ingredients such as sweet potato, dried small fish, or shrimp. The leaves are rubbed until foamy or sticky before they are added to the soup. Among the Yoruba people of Nigeria, the leaves are called &quot;Ewedu&quot;, and in the Hausa-speaking northern Nigeria, the leaves are called &quot;turgunuwa&quot; or &quot;lallo&quot;. The cook shreds the jute leaves adds them to the soup, which generally also contains meat or fish, onions, pepper, and other spices. The Lugbara of Northwestern Uganda also eat jute leaves in a soup called &quot;pala bi&quot;. Jute is also a totem for Ayivu, one of the Lugbara clans.

In the Philippines, especially in Ilocano-dominated areas, this vegetable, which is locally known as &quot;saluyot&quot;, can be mixed with bitter gourd, bamboo shoots, loofah, or a combination of these ingredients, which have a slimy and slippery texture.

Vietnamese cuisine also use edible jute known as &quot;rau đay&quot;. It is usually used in &quot;canh&quot; cooked with crab and loofah.

In Haiti, a dish called &quot;Lalo&quot; is made with jute leaves and other ingredients. One version of Lalo includes lalo with crab and meat (such as pork or beef) served on a bed of rice.

== Environmental impact ==
Fabrics made of jute fibers are carbon neutral and biodegradable, which make jute a candidate material for high performance technical textiles.

As global concern over forest destruction increases, jute may begin to replace wood as a primary pulp ingredient.

<text>A charter is the grant of authority or rights, stating that the granter formally recognizes the prerogative of the recipient to exercise the rights specified. It is implicit that the granter retains superiority (or sovereignty), and that the recipient admits a limited (or inferior) status within the relationship, and it is within that sense that charters were historically granted, and it is that sense which is retained in modern usage of the term. In early medieval Britain, charters transferred land from donors to recipients.

The word entered the English language from the Old French &#x27;, via [[Latin]]&#x27;, and ultimately from Greek (&quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;layer of papyrus&quot;). It has come to be synonymous with a document that sets out a grant of rights or privileges.

== Other usages ==
The term is used for a special case (or as an exception) of an institutional charter. A charter school, for example, is one that has different rules, regulations, and statutes from a state school.

Charter can be used as a synonym for &quot;hire&quot; or &quot;lease&quot;, as in the &quot;charter&quot; of a bus, boat or plane.

A charter member (US English) of an organization is an original member; that is, one who became a member when the organization received its charter. A chartered member (British English) is a member who holds an individual chartered designation authorized under that organization&#x27;s royal charter.

==Different types of charters==
===Anglo-Saxon charters===

Anglo-Saxon charters are documents from the early medieval period in Britain which typically make a grant of land or record a privilege. They are usually written on parchment, in Latin but often with sections in the vernacular, describing the bounds of estates, which often correspond closely to modern parish boundaries. The earliest surviving charters were drawn up in the 670s; the oldest surviving charters granted land to the Church, but from the 8th century surviving charters were increasingly used to grant land to lay people.

===Charter colony===

The British Empire used three main types of colonies as it sought to expand its territory to distant parts of the earth. These three types were royal colonies, proprietary colonies, and corporate colonies. A charter colony by definition is a &quot;colony chartered to an individual, trading company, etc., by the British crown.&quot; Although charter colonies were not the most prevalent of the three types of colonies in the British Empire, they were by no means insignificant.

===Congressional charter===

A congressional charter is a law passed by the United States Congress that states the mission, authority, and activities of a group. Congress issued federal charters from 1791 until 1992 under Title 36 of the United States Code.

===Municipal charter===
A &quot;municipal corporation&quot; is the legal term for a local governing body, including (but not necessarily limited to) cities, counties, towns, townships, charter townships, villages, and boroughs. &quot;Municipal incorporation&quot; occurs when such municipalities become self-governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a municipal charter, a term used because municipal power was historically granted by the sovereign, by royal charter.

=== Order charter ===
Charters for chivalric orders and other orders, such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.
===Project charter===

In project management, a project charter or project definition (sometimes called the terms of reference) is provided by the sponsor to formally authorize the existence of a project. It provides a preliminary delineation of roles and responsibilities, outlines the project purpose and objectives, identifies key stakeholders, and defines the authority of the project manager. It serves as a reference of authority for future planning of the project. The project scope is developed from the project charter.

===Royal charter===

In medieval Europe, royal charters were used to create cities (i.e., localities with recognised legal rights and privileges). The date that such a charter was granted is considered to be when a city was &quot;founded&quot;, regardless of when the locality originally began to be settled.

The Charter of 1814, France&#x27;s constitution during the Bourbon Restoration, was thus called to promote the legal fiction that the King had granted it &quot;voluntarily, and by the free exercise of [his] royal authority&quot;, in the manner of medieval charters.

At one time a royal charter was the only way in which an incorporated body could be formed, but other means (such as the registration process for limited companies) are generally now used instead.

===University charter===

A university charter is a charter issued to create or recognise a university. The form of charter used varies by period and jurisdiction.

===Inspeximus charter===
A charter of &quot;&quot; (Latin, literally &quot;We have inspected&quot;) is frequently a royal charter, by which an earlier charter or series of charters relating to a particular foundation (such as a monastery or a guild) was recited and incorporated into a new charter, usually in order to confirm and renew its validity under present authority. Where the original documents are lost, an inspeximus charter may sometimes preserve their texts and lists of witnesses.

=== Corporate charter ===
See Articles of association.

===Uprising charter ===
In the context of a political uprising, a charter might lay out the basic principles and goals of the movement, define the organizational structure of the movement, and describe the roles and responsibilities of its members.

<text>Magdalene asylums, also known as Magdalene laundries (named after the Biblical figure Mary Magdalene), were initially Protestant but later mostly Roman Catholic institutions that operated from the 18th to the late 20th centuries, ostensibly to house &quot;fallen women&quot;. 

The term referred to female sexual promiscuity or prostitutes, young women who became pregnant outside of marriage, or young girls and teenagers who did not have familial support. They were required to work without pay apart from meagre food provisions, while the institutions operated large commercial laundries, serving customers outside their bases.

Many of these &quot;laundries&quot; were effectively operated as penitentiary workhouses. The strict regimes in the institutions were often more severe than those found in prisons. This contradicted the perceived outlook that they were meant to help women as opposed to punishing them. A survivor said of the working conditions: &quot;The heat was unbelievable. You couldn&#x27;t leave your station unless a bell went.&quot; Laundries such as this operated in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Canada, the United States, and Australia, for much of the 19th and well into the 20th century, the last one closing in 1996.

The first Magdalene institution was founded in late 1758 in Whitechapel, England. A similar institution was established in Ireland by 1767. The first Magdalene asylum in the United States was the Magdalen Society of Philadelphia, founded in 1800. All these were Protestant institutions. Other cities followed, especially from around 1800, with Catholic institutions also being opened. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Magdalene asylums were common in several countries. By 1900, there were more than 300 asylums in England and more than 20 in Scotland.

==By country==
===England, Scotland, and Wales (1758)===
The first Magdalen institution, &quot;Magdalen Hospital for the Reception of Penitent Prostitutes&quot;, was founded in late 1758 in Whitechapel, London by Robert Dingley, a silk merchant, Jonas Hanway and John Fielding. The women worked at services and crafts to help provide financial support for the house. They were also given a small sum of money for their work. Additional income was generated by promoting the house as a tourist attraction for the upper classes. Horace Walpole, Fourth Earl of Orford, described staging one of these entertainments. This was in keeping with visits to Bethlem Royal Hospital and the Foundling Hospital. It later moved to Streatham, and could eventually house about 140 women, admitted between the ages of 15 and 40. Bristol (40 women) followed in 1800, Bath (79) in 1805, and many other cities in the years following, though their names mostly no longer included &quot;Magdalene&quot;. Historians estimate that by the late 1800s, there were more than 300 Magdalene Institutions in England alone.

In 1797, the Edinburgh Royal Magdalene Asylum was founded in the Canongate in Old Town, a popular location for street prostitutes. Some of the women were drawn to the city by industrialisation, some were pregnant and some had been forced into prostitution. Mary Paterson, (also known as Mary Mitchell) was murdered by William Burke shortly after leaving the institution on April 8, 1828. The Edinburgh asylum moved to Dalry around 1842. The programme was supported in part by laundry and sewing work done by the residents. In Glasgow, the Magdalene Asylum became the Magdalene Institute and functioned until 1958.

Writer Charles Dickens and philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts established an alternative in 1846, thinking the Magdalen Hospitals too harsh. At Urania Cottage the young women were prepared for re-entry into mainstream society, or for immigration to the colonies.

By the late 19th century, many of the institutions had departed from the original model and resembled penitentiary work-houses. The question of whether they should become subject to labour regulations and inspections as commercial laundries were became particularly controversial around the turn of the century, with sides often drawn on Irish/English and Catholic/Protestant lines. The Factory Act (1901) limited working hours for girls of thirteen to eighteen years of age to twelve hours a day, but exempted religious institutions. However work by female factory inspectors during the 1900s decade managed to convince religious institutions to submit to voluntary inspections, and by the end of the 1900s, inspections were interdenominationally accepted in England. The normalisation of inspections and other regulations of institutions in England is considered to have softened their regime and improved conditions compared to Ireland.

By the 1950s Magdalene asylums in Britain had mostly either closed or transformed into institutions with a narrower focus, like vocational training centres or approved schools.

===Ireland (1767)===

The first Magdalene laundry or asylum in Ireland, an Anglican or Church of Ireland-run institution, &quot;Magdalen Asylum for Penitent Females&quot;, opened on Leeson Street in Dublin in 1767, after two years of preparation. It was founded by Lady Arabella Denny, admitted only Protestant women, and had an episcopal chapel. Around 1805, John England of Cork established a female reformatory together with male and female poor schools. Pending the opening of the Church of Ireland-run Magdalen Asylum in Cork, he maintained and ministered to many applicants. The Magdalene Asylum in Cork (Sawmill Street) opened in 1810. The last Magdalene laundry closed on 25 September 1996 on Sean MacDermott Street in Dublin.

In Belfast, Northern Ireland, the Church of Ireland-run Ulster Magdalene Asylum and episcopal chapel, was founded in 1839. The asylum closed in 1916 and the St Mary Magdalene chapel became a parish church. Parallel institutions were run by Roman Catholics and Presbyterians (the Ulster Female Penitentiary and Laundry). Ferriter described the laundries as &quot;a mechanism that society, religious orders and the state came up with to try to get rid of people deemed not to conforming to the so-called... Irish identity.&quot; The Irish government claimed that the State was not legally responsible for the abuse suffered by women and girls in the Magdalene laundries, as these were religious institutions.

The discovery in 1993 of a mass grave on the grounds of High Park – a former convent in Dublin – led to media articles about the operations of the institutions. Ultimately the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child called for a government inquiry into the Magdalene laundries. A formal state apology was issued in 2013, and a €60 million compensation scheme for survivors was established. By 2011, the four religious institutes that ran the Irish asylums had not yet contributed to compensate survivors of abuse, despite demands from the Irish government, and the UN Committee Against Torture. The religious sisters continue to care for more than 100 elderly Magdalene women who remain in their care. An estimated 600 survivors were still alive in March 2014.

Senator Martin McAleese chaired an Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen laundries. An Interim Report was released in October 2011. In 2013 the BBC did a special investigation, Sue Lloyd-Roberts&#x27; &quot;Demanding justice for women and children abused by Irish nuns.&quot;

&quot;The Magdalene Sisters&quot;, a 2002 film by Peter Mullan, is based on historical facts about four young women incarcerated in a Magdalene laundry in Ireland from 1964 to 1968.

In 2011, a monument was erected in Ennis, County Clare, dedicated to the Sisters of Mercy, who had an industrial school and a Magdalene Laundry in the town. In 2015, Ennis municipal council decided to honour the same order by renaming a road in recognition of their &quot;compassionate service to vulnerable women and children.&quot; The road runs through the site of the former industrial school and laundry. People are divided about these honours.

===United States (1800)===
The first Magdalene asylum in the United States was the Magdalen Society of Philadelphia, founded in 1800. Other North American cities, including New York, Boston and Chicago quickly followed suit.

Asylum records show that in the early history of the Magdalene movement, many women entered and left the institutions of their own accord, sometimes repeatedly. Lu Ann De Cunzo wrote in her book, &quot;Reform, Respite, Ritual: An Archaeology of Institutions; The Magdalene Society of Philadelphia, 1800–1850&quot;, that the women in Philadelphia&#x27;s asylum &quot;sought a refuge and a respite from disease, the prison or almshouse, unhappy family situations, abusive men, and dire economic circumstances.&quot; In its early years, the Magdalen Society Asylum functioned as a refuge for prostitutes. Most of these stayed a few days or a few weeks, just long enough to get reclothed and recuperated. Attempts at rehabilitation met with little success. In 1877, the asylum was changed into a home for &quot;wayward girls&quot;, with a rule requiring a stay for twelve months. As the Magdalen Society Asylum became more selective, relaxed its emphasis on personal guilt and salvation, and standardized the treatment of inmates, its rate of failure diminished.

The Penitent Females&#x27; Refuge Society of Boston was incorporated in 1823.
New York&#x27;s Magdalen Society was established in 1830 with the purpose of rescuing women from lives of prostitution and vice. Advocates of women sometimes kidnapped them from brothels.

The Magdalen Asylum, operated by the Magdalen Society in New York, provided a structured environment for women seeking refuge and rehabilitation. Upon entering the asylum, women were required to adhere to strict rules and regulations. They received religious instruction, engaged in prayer and devotional activities, and were expected to demonstrate repentance for their past actions. In addition to spiritual guidance, the Magdalen Asylum offered educational and vocational opportunities to its residents. Women received basic literacy and numeracy education and vocational training in areas such as &quot;sewing, laundry work, or domestic service&quot;. The aim was to equip them with practical skills to help them reintegrate into society and secure employment outside the asylum. Critics argue that such organizations did little to address the underlying social and economic factors that often led women into prostitution, and instead focused on moral reform and control.

In 1907 a new home was established in the Inwood section of upper Manhattan. The Society had twice moved to a larger facility. Many of the young women who were temporary residents at the Inwood institution had worked in the taverns, brothels, and alleyways of lower Manhattan before being &quot;rescued&quot; by the Society. Girls were generally committed for a period of three years. Through the years, several girls died or were injured climbing out of windows in failed escape attempts. In 1917, the Magdalen Benevolent Society changed its name to Inwood House. In the early 1920s, bichloride of mercury was commonly used to treat new arrivals for venereal disease, as penicillin was not yet available. Some women suffered mercury poisoning, as happened with patients on the outside. The property was later sold and the agency relocated. Inwood House continues to operate, with its main focus on teen pregnancy.

===Canada (1848)===
The Congregation of the Sisters of Misericorde was founded in Montreal in 1848 by Marie-Rosalie Cadron-Jetté, a widow skilled as a midwife. Their network of asylums developed from their care of unmarried pregnant women until after they gave birth. In this period, unmarried women were encouraged to give their illegitimate children up for adoption. The Misericordia Sisters endeavoured to carry out their ministry discreetly, for the public was neither supportive of their cause nor charitable to the young women they aided. The sisters were accused of &quot;encouraging vice&quot;. The order was particularly sensitive to the social stigma attached to a woman who had borne an illegitimate child. The sisters perceived that, by precluding other employment, this stigma often tended to force a woman into prostitution, and in some cases infanticide. According to Sulpician Father Éric Sylvestre, &quot;When food was scarce, Rosalie would fast so that the moms could eat. She was fond of saying that &#x27;Single mothers are the treasure of the house.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;In receiving patients no discrimination is made in regard to religion, colour, or nationality. After their convalescence, those who desire to remain in the home are placed under a special sister and are known as &#x27;Daughters of St. Margaret&#x27;. They follow a certain rule of life but contract no religious obligations. Should they desire to remain in the convent, after a period of probation, they are allowed to become Magdalens and eventually make the vows of the Magdalen institute.&quot;

In 1858, Elizabeth Dunlop and others founded the Toronto Magdalene Laundries, with the stated goal of &quot;eliminating prostitution by rehabilitating prostitutes&quot;.

===Sweden (1852)===
In Sweden, the first Magdalene asylum (&quot;Magdalenahem&quot;) was founded in Stockholm in 1852 by the philanthropist Emilie Elmblad. By 1900, there were eight asylums in Sweden, of which half were managed by the Salvation Army.

The asylums&#x27; purpose was to educate or train former female prostitutes in a different occupation, to make it possible for them to support themselves when they left the asylum. In practice, they were trained in domestic occupations in the asylums. The asylums tried to place former residents as domestic servants in private homes, preferably with religious employers. In this period, many people still worked as domestic servants, and women especially had limited work opportunities.

As the asylums were normally managed by religious women philanthropists such as Elsa Borg, the goal was not only to provide them with employment but to encourage their religious practice, which was thought to help them avoid returning to prostitution. The asylums provided the clients with factory work only if the first choice of being a domestic in a private religious home failed. Employment in a public establishment, such as a hotel or a restaurant, was considered the least desirable choice, as such work was considered to be a great risk for women in terms of reentering prostitution.

This was in line with several other common private charitable establishments especially in Stockholm, which provided poor women in the cities with shelter and employment (normally as domestics), to prevent them from becoming prostitutes.

The asylums were charity institutions and founded in great part by the work of the women in domestic training there. Initially, women were paid for their work. This practice was abandoned when overseers concluded that it made women less inclined to follow rules. In Sweden, the majority of the inmates of the Magdalena asylums had voluntarily committed themselves, seeking help. There were known cases of women being committed by her family or by authorities. The Magdalena Asylum in Stockholm was closed in 1895.

===Australia (1890)===
From the early 1890s to the 1960s, most Australian state capitals had a large Roman Catholic convent that contained a commercial laundry where the work was done by the mostly teenage girls who were placed in the convent. They were committed, voluntarily or involuntarily, for reasons such as being destitute, &quot;uncontrollable&quot; as judged by family members or picked up by the police. According to James Franklin, the girls came from a variety of very disturbed and deprived backgrounds and were individually hard to deal with in many cases.

Laundry work was regarded as suitable as part of the work program for the girls, as it did not require much training nor substantial capital expense. Former inmates consistently have reported negative memories of conditions in the convent laundries, detailing verbal abuse by nuns and other supervisors, and very hard physical work under difficult conditions. In accordance with the traditions of the nuns, much of the day proceeded in silence. Like orphanages, these institutions received almost no government funds. As in any underfunded institution, the food was described as bland. The nuns shared the conditions of the women inmates, such as bad food, hard work, confinement, and long periods of silence. Education for residents was either of poor quality or lacking altogether. The sisters had no physical contact with the girls, nor emotional contact in the sense of listening to the girls&#x27; concerns.

Dangers included the infectious diseases of the time and workplace accidents. In 1889, one of the sisters of the Abbotsford Convent in Victoria lost her hand in an accident involving laundry machinery. In 1942 14-year-old Doris Dyer lost her arm from the shoulder when she was caught in the laundry mangle at the Home of the Good Shepherd laundry in West Leederville, Western Australia (now the Catherine McAuley Centre).

The asylums were initially established as refuges, with the residents free to leave. In the early 1900s, they reluctantly began to accept court referrals. &quot;They took in girls whom no-one else wanted and who were forcibly confined, contrary to the wishes of both the girls and the nuns.&quot; A 1954 report of the &quot;Sun Herald&quot; of a visit to the Ashfield laundry found 55 girls there involuntarily, 124 voluntary inmates, including 65 mentally challenged adult women, and about 30 who were originally there involuntarily but had stayed on. The dormitories were described as seriously overcrowded.

<text>Corporate-owned life insurance (COLI), is life insurance on employees&#x27; lives that is owned by the employer, with benefits payable either to the employer or directly to the employee&#x27;s families. Other names for the practice include janitor&#x27;s insurance and dead peasants insurance. When the employer is a bank, the insurance is known as a bank owned life insurance (BOLI).

COLI was originally purchased on the lives of key employees and executives by a company to hedge against the financial cost of losing key employees to unexpected death, the risk of recruiting and training replacements of necessary or highly trained personnel, or to fund corporate obligations to redeem stock upon the death of an owner. This use is commonly known as &quot;key man&quot; or &quot;key person&quot; insurance. Although this article refers only to practice and policy in the United States, key person insurance is used in other countries as well.

Primarily in the 1990s, some companies aggressively insured a broad base of employees, as part of general hiring requirements. During the hiring process, employees sign many documents, including life, health and welfare coverage agreements or applications for insurance. Additionally, up until 1984, certain premiums for life insurance were leveraged and deducted. Even today, when a COLI plan&#x27;s death benefits are paid to an employee&#x27;s family directly, the company paying the premiums can deduct them from corporate profits and earnings.

Today, COLI is most common for senior executives of a firm, but its use for general employees is still sometimes practiced.

==United States tax law history==
Under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) dealing with life insurance benefits paid due to the death of the insured, the benefits are usually excluded from the taxable income of the beneficiary.

Because of the tax-free nature of death benefits, the IRC prohibits the deduction of the premiums paid for life insurance when the premium payor is also the beneficiary of the death benefit rather than the individual employee and their family. In addition, loans from insurers secured by policy values are not income and earnings credited to an owner&#x27;s policy values (known as &quot;inside buildup&quot;) by the insurance company are not currently taxed (and may escape taxation altogether if such earnings are not distributed other than as part of the death benefits paid upon the death of the insured).

===1950s: leveraged insurance===
Interest incurred on indebtedness has historically been deductible, (although the deduction of &quot;personal&quot; interest was largely eliminated in 1986), and in the 1950s a type of &quot;leveraged insurance&quot; transaction began being marketed that permitted an insurance owner to in effect deduct the cost of paying for insurance by (1) paying large premiums to create cash values, (2) &quot;borrowing&quot; against the cash value to in effect strip out the large premiums, and (3) paying deductible &quot;interest&quot; back to the insurer, which was in turn credited to the policy&#x27;s cash value as tax-deferred earnings on the policy that could fund the insurer&#x27;s legitimate charges against policy value for cost of insurance, etc.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), via the Supreme Court case Knetsch v. United States (1960), had early success in challenging the bona fides of these types of arrangements as creating legitimate debt and interest eligible to be deducted. However, subsequent court losses and IRC amendments weakened their position, appearing to permit tax-deductible borrowing to provide funds to pay insurance premiums, so long as such borrowing did not account for more than three of the first seven annual premiums on the policy (the &quot;4 out of 7&quot; test).

===1980s: tax shelters===
Another IRC amendment limited to $50,000 the amount that could be borrowed (and yet yield deductible interest payments) with respect to any one insured. Although the 4 out of 7 test was exploited in the 1980s by businesses seeking to in effect pay for insurance on employees/shareholders, e.g., on a deductible basis, the introduction of the US$50,000 cap/insured in 1986 in turn led to the creation of broad-based leveraged COLI transactions, i.e., those in which the employer would purchase life insurance on hundreds or thousands of (usually low-level) employees, that would produce tax savings on interest deductions in excess of the actual cost to the employer of engaging in the transaction. These transactions were deemed by the IRS to be &quot;tax shelters.&quot;

In a typical broad-based leveraged COLI transaction, a corporate employer would purchase policies on masses of lower-level employees, sometimes without the employees&#x27; knowledge or consent. When an insured employee died, the company received the death benefits, and the employee&#x27;s family typically received either a small portion of the proceeds or nothing. These policies could remain in place even after the employee quits or retires.

===1990s to present: limited reform===
Ultimately, the IRS won court cases against several leveraged COLI investors, including Camelot Music, Winn-Dixie, American Electric Power, and Dow Chemical. Other similar investors settled their tax cases with the IRS on a basis mostly favorable to the IRS. Meanwhile, Congress amended the IRC several times again to both ensure that the prohibition on borrowing (on a deductible basis) to fund insurance acquisitions was clear and to deny the tax-free nature of death benefits to corporate employer in some situations (e.g., if the insured was not provided with adequate advance notice and an opportunity to block the insurance acquisition or if the insured was not an employee of the corporation within a year of his or her death).

So long as the employer complies with the new rules (adopted in 2006 and characterized as the &quot;COLI Best Practices Act&quot;), however, the tax-free nature of the death benefits and the tax deferral on earnings credited to policy value remain.

The COLI Best Practices Provision, within the Pension Protection Act of 2006, was signed into law on August 17, 2006. This provision is designed to codify industry &quot;best practices&quot; regarding employer-owned life insurance and amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by introducing conditions that must be met in order to exclude from gross income the proceeds from company-owned life insurance. The Act amends Section 101 of the Internal Revenue Code by adding subsection (j), “treatment of Certain Employer-Owned Life insurance Contracts,” and adds Section 60391, “Returns and Records with respect to Employer-Owned Life Insurance Contracts.”

Under Section 101(j), the employer-owned death benefit proceeds will be considered eligible for exclusion from the employer&#x27;s income provided all the following Notice and Consent Requirements and one of the Specified Exceptions are met.

Notice and Consent Requirements
: &quot;The Employee must, prior to the issuance of the insurance contract:&quot;

# Be notified in writing that the employer intends to insure the employee’s life and the maximum face amount for which the employee could be insured at the time the contract is issued.
# Provide written consent to be insured under the contract during and after active employment.
# Be informed in writing if the employer will be a sole or partial beneficiary of any death benefits.

: &quot;Specified Exception:&quot;
: The insured was an employee at any time during the 12-month period before the insured’s death.

: &quot;Specified Exception:&quot;
: Directors and Highly Compensated Employees: At time of contract issue, the insured employee was a director, or a 5% or greater owner of the business at any time during the preceding year, or received compensation in excess of $95,000, adjusted for future inflation, in the preceding year, or was one of the five highest-paid officers, or was among the highest-paid 35% of all employees.

According to one source, Hartford Life Insurance estimated that one-quarter of all Fortune 500 companies have COLI policies, which cover the lives of about 5 million employees.

<text>The 1980 Summer Paralympics (), branded as the Olympics for the Disabled, were the sixth Summer Paralympic Games. They were held in Arnhem, Netherlands, from 21 to 30 June 1980.

==Background==
The Soviet Union, hosts of the 1980 Summer Olympics, were invited to host these Paralympics. However, disability sport was not there, and they passed; notoriously, a statement was issued denying the existence of any disabled people in the country (labelled &quot;invalids&quot; by Soviet officials). Soviet Paralympic teams were first represented in the 1988 Summer and Winter Games, also the last while the Soviet Union was extant. The first Paralympics on former Soviet territory would be in 2014.

There was controversy during the preparation for these Games over the inclusion of a team from South Africa. In the Netherlands, public and official opinion was against the inclusion of the South African team and pressure came from a number of sports organisations against the Organising Committee. The Dutch Parliament was negative as well. Eventually, the parliament decided against allowing the participation of the South African team. Although &quot;much of the publicity relating to the South African participation had been negative, it did succeed in bringing the disabled sports movement into the minds of many people who would not have otherwise considered the subject at all. Dutch organisers also increased visibility through their fundraising ... building a fund that would hold a surplus years after the games. This would naturally find its expression in the International Fund Sport Disabled, supporting the future of the paralympic movement in the 1980s.&quot;

==Mascots==

The 1980 Paralympics were the first ever to have mascots: a pair of squirrels, Noggi and Joggi, designed by Necky Oprinsen from Sint-Michielsgestel. They were chosen through a design competition by Dutch broadcaster AVRO.

== Sports ==
Competitors were divided into four disability categories: amputee, cerebral palsy, visually impaired, and wheelchair. It was the first time that cerebral palsy athletes competed in the Paralympics. Volleyball was added to the program as a new sport.
* Archery
* Athletics
* Dartchery
* Goalball
* Lawn bowls
* Shooting
* Swimming
* Table tennis
* Volleyball
* Weightlifting
* Wheelchair basketball
* Wheelchair fencing
* Wrestling
== Participating delegations ==
Forty-three delegations took part in the Arnhem Paralympics. Iceland, Kuwait and Sudan made their first appearances.

Prior to the Games, the States General (national Parliament) of the Netherlands, as host country, adopted a motion declaring South Africa&#x27;s participation &quot;undesirable&quot;, due to its policy of apartheid. The 1980 Games thus marked South Africa&#x27;s first absence from the Summer Paralympics since it had joined the movement in 1964, and it remained absent until 1992. The Netherlands&#x27; decision thus corrected the anomaly whereby South Africa had been banned from the Olympic movement since 1960, while still being authorised to take part in the Paralympic Games.

<text>The Baptist Bible Fellowship International (BBFI) is a conservative Baptist Christian denomination. It is headquartered in Springfield, Missouri.

==History==
The Fellowship was founded during a meeting at Fort Worth in 1950 by a group of 100 pastors of the World Baptist Fellowship who disagreed with the authoritative direction of the leader. That same year, the Baptist Bible College (now Mission University) and the organization&#x27;s headquarters were established in Springfield, Missouri. It has established various fundamentalists Baptist Bible churches around the world. In 2000, it had 4,500 churches and 1,200,000 members. According to a denomination census released in 2020, it has 4,000 churches in the United States and has a presence in 80 countries.

==Programs==
There are three functions of the Baptist Bible Fellowship International. Worldwide missions, training, and communication.

The &quot;Baptist Bible Tribune&quot;, published monthly, contains numerous opinion pieces, reports from the foreign mission field, reports from domestic churches, and light theological treatises. It is written by BBFI officers, pastors, and missionaries and is the official voice of the BBFI. Since 2015, the editor is Randy Harp who was preceded by Keith Bassham.

The organizational structure includes the president, vice-presidents, secretary, treasurer, and one director from each state elected by his own state fellowship. Within this organization, there are state fellowships in each of the fifty United States.

== Beliefs ==
The Fellowship has a Baptist confession of faith. Their beliefs are part of the fundamentalist movement.

<doc id="336198" wikidata="Q1517530" url="?curid=336198" title="History of copyright">
<text>The history of copyright starts with early privileges and monopolies granted to printers of books. The British Statute of Anne 1710, full title &quot;An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned&quot;, was the first copyright statute. Initially copyright law only applied to the copying of books. Over time other uses such as translations and derivative works were made subject to copyright and copyright now covers a wide range of works, including maps, performances, paintings, photographs, sound recordings, motion pictures and computer programs.

Today national copyright laws have been standardised to some extent through international and regional agreements such as the Berne Convention and the European copyright directives. Although there are consistencies among nations&#x27; copyright laws, each jurisdiction has separate and distinct laws and regulations about copyright. Some jurisdictions also recognize moral rights of creators, such as the right to be credited for the work.

Copyrights are exclusive rights granted to the author or creator of an original work, including the right to copy, distribute and adapt the work. Copyright does not protect ideas, only their expression or fixation. In most jurisdictions copyright arises upon fixation and does not need to be registered. Copyright owners have the exclusive statutory right to exercise control over copying and other exploitation of the works for a specific period of time, after which the work is said to enter the public domain. Uses which are covered under limitations and exceptions to copyright, such as fair use, do not require permission from the copyright owner. All other uses require permission and copyright owners can license or permanently transfer or assign their exclusive rights to others.

==Early developments==

A possible historical case-law on the right to copy comes from ancient Ireland. The Cathach is the oldest extant Irish manuscript of the Psalter and the earliest example of Irish writing. It contains a Vulgate version of Psalms XXX (30) to CV (105) with an interpretative rubric or heading before each psalm. It is traditionally ascribed to Saint Columba as the copy, made at night in haste by a miraculous light, of a Psalter lent to Columba by St. Finnian. In the 6th century, a dispute arose about the ownership of the copy and King Diarmait Mac Cerbhaill gave the judgement &quot;To every cow belongs her calf, therefore to every book belongs its copy.&quot; The Battle of Cúl Dreimhne was said to be fought over this issue. However, the account of the dispute over the Cathach copy comes from a significantly later source and its validity has been questioned. 
Modern copyright law has been influenced by an array of older legal rights that have been recognized throughout history, including the moral rights of the author who created a work, the economic rights of a benefactor who paid to have a copy made, the property rights of the individual owner of a copy, and a sovereign&#x27;s right to censor and to regulate the printing industry. The origins of some of these rights can be traced back to ancient Greek culture, ancient Jewish law, and ancient Roman law. In Greek society, during the sixth century B.C.E., there emerged the notion of the individual self, including personal ideals, ambition, and creativity. The individual self is important in copyright because it distinguishes the creativity produced by an individual from the rest of society. In ancient Jewish Talmudic law there can be found recognition of the moral rights of the author and the economic or property rights of an author.

Prior to the invention of movable type in the West in the mid-15th century, texts were copied by hand and the small number of texts generated few occasions for these rights to be tested. During the Roman Empire, a period of prosperous book trade, no copyright or similar regulations existed, and copying by those other than professional booksellers was rare. This is because books were, typically, copied by literate slaves, who were expensive to buy and maintain. Thus, any copier would have had to pay much the same expense as a professional publisher. Roman book sellers would sometimes pay a well-regarded author for first access to a text for copying, but they had no exclusive rights to a work and authors were not normally paid anything for their work. Martial, in his &quot;Epigrams&quot;, complains about receiving no profit despite the popularity of his poetry throughout the Roman Empire.

The printing press came into use in Europe in the 1400s and 1500s, and made it much cheaper to produce books. As there was initially no copyright law, anyone could buy or rent a press and print any text. Popular new works were immediately re-set and re-published by competitors, so printers needed a constant stream of new material. Fees paid to authors for new works were high, and significantly supplemented the incomes of many academics.

Printing brought profound social changes. The rise in literacy across Europe led to a dramatic increase in the demand for reading matter. Prices of reprints were low, so publications could be bought by poorer people, creating a mass-market readership. In German-speaking areas, most publications were academic papers, and most were scientific and technical publications, often autodidactic practical instruction manuals on topics such as dike construction. After copyright law became established (in 1710 in England, and in the 1840s in German-speaking areas) the low-price mass market vanished, and fewer, more expensive editions were published. Heinrich Heine, in a 1854 letter to his publisher, complains: &quot;Due to the tremendously high prices you have established, I will hardly see a second edition of the book anytime soon. But you must set lower prices, dear Campe, for otherwise I really don&#x27;t see why I was so lenient with my material interests.&quot;

==Early privileges and monopolies==

The origin of copyright law in most European countries lies in efforts by the church and governments to regulate and control the output of printers. Before the invention of the printing press, a writing, once created, could only be physically multiplied by the highly laborious and error-prone process of manual copying by scribes. An elaborate system of censorship and control over scribes did not exist, as scribes were scattered and worked on single manuscripts. Printing allowed for multiple exact copies of a work, leading to a more rapid and widespread circulation of ideas and information (see print culture). In 1559 the Index Expurgatorius, or &quot;List of Prohibited Books&quot;, was issued for the first time.

In Europe printing was invented and widely established in the 15th and 16th centuries. While governments and church encouraged printing in many ways, which allowed the dissemination of Bibles and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly. As a consequence, governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licences to trade and produce books. The licenses typically gave printers the exclusive right to print particular works for a fixed period of years, and enabled the printer to prevent others from printing the same work during that period. The licenses could only grant rights to print in the territory of the state that had granted them, but they did usually prohibit the import of foreign printing.

The republic of Venice granted its first privilege for a particular book in 1486. It was a special case, being the history of the city itself, the &quot;Rerum venetarum ab urbe condita opus&quot; of Marcus Antonius Coccius Sabellicus. The second author in the world to achieve copyright, Royal printing privileges, was the humanist and grammarian Antonio de Nebrija, in &quot;Lexicon hoc est Dictionarium ex sermone latino in hispaniensem&quot; (Salamanca, 1492).
From 1492 onwards Venice began regularly granting privileges for books. The Republic of Venice, the dukes of Florence, and Leo X and other Popes conceded at different times to certain printers the exclusive privilege of printing for specific terms (rarely exceeding 14 years) editions of classic authors.

The first copyright privilege in England bears date 1518 and was issued to Richard Pynson, King&#x27;s Printer, the successor to William Caxton. The privilege gives a monopoly for the term of two years. The date is 15 years later than that of the first privilege issued in France. Early copyright privileges were called &quot;monopolies,&quot; particularly during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, who frequently gave grants of monopolies in articles of common use, such as salt, leather, coal, soap, cards, beer, and wine. The practice was continued until the Statute of Monopolies was enacted in 1623, ending most monopolies, with certain exceptions, such as patents; after 1623, grants of letters patent to publishers became common.

The earliest German privilege of which there is trustworthy record was issued in 1501 by the Aulic Council to an association entitled the &quot;Sodalitas Rhenana Celtica&quot;, for the publication of an edition of the dramas of Hroswitha of Gandersheim, which had been prepared for the press by Conrad Celtes
. According to historian Eckhard Höffner indicated that there was no effective copyright legislation in Germany in the early 19th century. Prussia introduced a copyright law in 1837, but even then authors and publishers just had to go to another German state to circumvent its ruling.
As the &quot;menace&quot; of printing spread, governments established centralized control mechanisms, and in 1557 the English Crown thought to stem the flow of seditious and heretical books by chartering the Stationers&#x27; Company. The right to print was limited to the members of that guild, and thirty years later the Star Chamber was chartered to curtail the &quot;greate enormities and abuses&quot; of &quot;dyvers contentyous and disorderlye persons professinge the arte or mystere of pryntinge or selling of books.&quot; The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the city of London, which had 53 printing presses. The French crown also repressed printing, and printer Etienne Dolet was burned at the stake in 1546. As the English took control of type founding in 1637, printers fled to the Netherlands. Confrontation with authority made printers radical and rebellious, and 800 authors, printers and book dealers were incarcerated in the Bastille before it was stormed in 1789. The notion that the expression of dissent or subversive views should be tolerated, not censured or punished by law, developed alongside the rise of printing and the press. The Areopagitica, published in 1644 under the full title &quot;Areopagitica: A speech of Mr. John Milton for the liberty of unlicensed printing to the Parliament of England&quot;, was John Milton&#x27;s response to the English parliament re-introducing government licensing of printers, hence publishers. In doing so Milton articulated the main strands of future discussions about freedom of expression. By defining the scope of freedom of expression and of &quot;harmful&quot; speech Milton argued against the principle of pre-censorship and in favour of tolerance for a wide range of views.

==Early British copyright law==

In England the printers, known as stationers, formed a collective organisation, known as the Stationers&#x27; Company. In the 16th century, the Stationers&#x27; Company was given the power to require all lawfully printed books to be entered into its register. Only members of the Stationers&#x27; Company could enter books into the register. This meant that the Stationers&#x27; Company achieved a dominant position over publishing in 17th-century England (no equivalent arrangement formed in Scotland and Ireland). 
The monopoly came to an end in 1695, when the English Parliament did not renew the Stationers&#x27; Company&#x27;s power.

In 1707, the parliaments of England and Scotland were united as a result of the Anglo-Scottish Union. The new parliament was able to change the laws in both countries and an important early piece of legislation was the Copyright Act 1710, also known as the Statute of Anne, after Queen Anne. The act came into force in 1710 and was the first copyright statute. Its full title was &quot;An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned&quot;.

The enforcement of the Statute of Anne in April 1710 marked a historic moment in the development of copyright law. As the world&#x27;s first copyright statute it granted publishers of a book legal protection of 14 years with the commencement of the statute. It also granted 21 years of protection for any book already in print. The Statute of Anne had a much broader social focus and remit than the monopoly granted to the Stationers&#x27; Company. The statute was concerned with the reading public, the continued production of useful literature, and the advancement and spread of education. The central plank of the statute is a social quid pro quo; to encourage &quot;learned men to compose and write useful books&quot; the statute guaranteed the finite right to print and reprint those works. It established a pragmatic bargain involving authors, the booksellers and the public. The Statute of Anne ended the old system whereby only literature that met the censorship standards administered by the booksellers could appear in print. The statute furthermore created a public domain for literature, as previously all literature belonged to the booksellers forever.

According to Patterson and Lindberg, the Statute of Anne:
When the statutory copyright term provided for by the Statute of Anne began to expire in 1731, London booksellers thought to defend their dominant position by seeking injunctions from the Court of Chancery for works by authors that fell outside the statute&#x27;s protection. At the same time, the London booksellers lobbied parliament to extend the copyright term provided by the Statute of Anne. Eventually, in a case known as &quot;Midwinter v Hamilton&quot; (1743–1748), the London booksellers turned to common law and started a 30-year period known as the &quot;battle of the booksellers&quot;, with London booksellers locking horns with the newly emerging Scottish book trade over the right to reprint works falling outside the protection of the Statute of Anne. The Scottish booksellers argued that no common law copyright existed in an author&#x27;s work. The London booksellers argued that the Statute of Anne only supplemented and supported a pre-existing common law copyright. The dispute was argued out in a number of notable cases, including &quot;Millar v Kincaid&quot; (1749–1751) and &quot;Tonson v Collins&quot; (1761–1762).

===Common law copyright===
A debate raged on whether printed ideas could be owned and London booksellers and other supporters of perpetual copyright argued that without it scholarship would cease to exist and that authors would have no incentive to continue creating works of enduring value if they could not bequeath the property rights to their descendants. Opponents of perpetual copyright argued that it amounted to a monopoly, which inflated the price of books, making them less affordable and therefore prevented the spread of the Enlightenment. London booksellers were attacked for using rights of authors to mask their greed and self-interest in controlling the book trade. When &quot;Donaldson v Beckett&quot; reached the House of Lords in 1774, Lord Camden was most strident in his rejection of common law copyright, warning the Lords that, should they vote in favour of common law copyright, effectively a perpetual copyright, &quot;all our learning will be locked up in the hands of the Tonsons and the Lintots of the age&quot;. Moreover, he warned, booksellers would then set upon books whatever price they pleased &quot;till the public became as much their slaves, as their own hackney compilers are&quot;. He declared that &quot;Knowledge and science are not things to be bound in such cobweb chains.&quot;

In its ruling, the House of Lords established that the rights and responsibilities in copyright were determined by legislation. There is, however, still disagreement over whether the House of Lords affirmed the existence of common-law copyright before it was superseded by the Statute of Anne. The Lords had traditionally been hostile to the booksellers&#x27; monopoly and were aware of how the doctrine of common law copyright, promoted by the booksellers, was used to support their case for a perpetual copyright. The Lords clearly decided against perpetual copyright and, by confirming that the copyright term (the length of time that a work is in copyright) did expire according to statute, the Lords also affirmed the public domain. The ruling in &quot;Donaldson v Beckett&quot; confirmed that a large number of works and books first published in Britain were in the public domain, either because the copyright term granted by statute had expired or because they were first published before the Statute of Anne was enacted in 1710. This opened the market for cheap reprints of works by Shakespeare, Milton and Chaucer, works now considered classics. The expansion of the public domain in books broke the dominance of the London booksellers and allowed for competition, with the number of London booksellers and publishers rising nearly threefold, from 111 to 308, between 1772 and 1802.

Eventually an understanding was established whereby authors had a pre-existing common-law copyright over their work, but that with the Statute of Anne parliament had limited these rights in order to strike a more appropriate balance between the interests of the author and the wider social good. According to Patterson and Livingston, confusion about the nature of copyright has remained ever since. Copyright has come to be viewed both as a natural-law right of the author and as the statutory grant of a limited monopoly. One theory holds that copyright is created simply by the creation of a work, the other that it is owed to a copyright statute.

In August 1906, The Copyright Law for Music Act 1906, known also as the T. P. O&#x27;Connor Bill, was added to copyright law when it was passed by the British Parliament, following many of the popular music writers at the time dying in poverty due to extensive piracy by gangs during the piracy crisis of sheet music in the early 20th century. The gangs would buy a copy of the music at full price, copy it, and resell it, often at half the price from the original.

==Early French copyright law==
In pre-revolutionary France all books needed to be approved by official censors and authors and publishers had to obtain a royal privilege before a book could be published. Royal privileges were exclusive and usually granted for six years, with the possibility of renewal. Over time it was established that the owner of a royal privilege has the sole right to obtain a renewal indefinitely. In 1761 the Royal Council awarded a royal privilege to the heirs of an author rather than the author&#x27;s publisher, sparking a national debate on the nature of literary property similar to that taking place in Britain during the battle of the booksellers.

In 1777 a series of royal decrees reformed the royal privileges. The duration of privileges were set at a minimum duration of 10 years or the life of the author, which ever was longer. If the author obtained a privilege and did not transfer or sell it on, he could publish and sell copies of the book himself, and pass the privilege on to his heirs, who enjoyed an exclusive right into perpetuity. If the privilege was sold to a publisher, the exclusive right would only last the specified duration. The royal decrees prohibited the renewal of privileges and once the privilege had expired anyone could obtain a &quot;permission simple&quot; to print or sell copies of the work. Hence the public domain in books whose privilege had expired was expressly recognised.

After the French Revolution a dispute over Comédie-Française being granted the exclusive right to the public performance of all dramatic works erupted and in 1791 the National Assembly abolished the privilege. Anyone was allowed to establish a public theatre and the National Assembly declared that the works of any author who had died more than five years ago were public property. In the same degree the National Assembly granted authors the exclusive right to authorise the public performance of their works during their lifetime, and extended that right to the authors&#x27; heirs and assignees for five years after the author&#x27;s death. The National Assembly took the view that a published work was by its nature a public property, and that an author&#x27;s rights are recognised as an exception to this principle, to compensate an author for his work.

In 1793 a new law was passed giving authors, composers, and artists the exclusive right to sell and distribute their works, and the right was extended to their heirs and assigns for 10 years after the author&#x27;s death. The National Assembly placed this law firmly on a natural right footing, calling the law the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Genius&quot; and so evoking the famous Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. However, author&#x27;s rights were subject to the condition of making depositing copies of the work with the Bibliothèque Nationale and 19th-century commentators characterised the 1793 law as utilitarian and &quot;a charitable grant from society&quot;.

==Early United States copyright law==

The Statute of Anne did not apply to the American colonies. The economy of early America was largely agrarian and only three private copyright acts had been passed in America prior to 1783. Two of the acts were limited to seven years, the other was limited to a term of five years. In 1783 several authors&#x27; petitions persuaded the Continental Congress &quot;that nothing is more properly a man&#x27;s own than the fruit of his study, and that the protection and security of literary property would greatly tend to encourage genius and to promote useful discoveries.&quot; But under the Articles of Confederation, the Continental Congress had no authority to enact copyright law. The Continental Congress passed a resolution urging the States to &quot;secure to the authors or publishers of any new book not hitherto printed ... the copy right of such books for a certain time not less than fourteen years from the first publication; and to secure to the said authors, if they shall survive the term first mentioned, ... the copy right of such books for another term of time no less than fourteen years. Three states had already enacted copyright statutes in 1783 prior to the Continental Congress resolution, and in the subsequent three years all of the remaining states except Delaware passed a copyright statute. Seven of the States followed the Statute of Anne and the Continental Congress&#x27; resolution by providing two fourteen-year terms. The five remaining States granted copyright for single terms of fourteen, twenty and twenty one years, with no right of renewal.

At the Philadelphia Convention in 1787, both James Madison of Virginia and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina submitted proposals that would allow Congress the power to grant copyright for a limited time. These proposals are the origin of the Copyright Clause in the United States Constitution, which allows the granting of copyright and patents for a limited time to serve a utilitarian function, namely &quot;to promote the progress of science and useful arts&quot;. The first federal copyright act was the Copyright Act of 1790. It granted copyright for a term of 14 years &quot;from the time of recording the title thereof&quot; with a right of renewal for another 14 years if the author survived to the end of the first term. The act covered not only books, but also maps and charts. Only works both printed within the United States and created by citizens were eligible. With exception of the provision on maps and charts the Copyright Act of 1790 is copied almost verbatim from the Statute of Anne.

At the time works only received protection under federal statutory copyright if the statutory formalities, such as a proper copyright notice, were satisfied. If this was not the case the work immediately entered into the public domain. In 1834 the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Wheaton v. Peters&quot; (a case similar to the 1774 case of &quot;Donaldson v Beckett&quot; in Britain) that although the author of an unpublished work had a common law right to control the first publication of that work, the author did not have a common law right to control reproduction following the first publication of the work.

==Early internationalisation==
The Berne Convention was first established in 1886, and was subsequently re-negotiated in 1896 (Paris), 1908 (Berlin), 1928 (Rome), 1948 (Brussels), 1967 (Stockholm) and 1971 (Paris). The convention relates to literary and artistic works, which includes films, and the convention requires its member states to provide protection for every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain. The Berne Convention has a number of core features, including the principle of &quot;national treatment&quot;, which holds that each member state to the convention would give citizens of other member states the same rights of copyright that it gave to its own citizens (Article 3-5).

Another core feature is the establishment of minimum standards of national copyright legislation in that each member state agrees to certain basic rules which their national laws must contain. Though member states can if they wish increase the amount of protection given to copyright owners. One important minimum rule was that the term of copyright was to be a minimum of the author&#x27;s lifetime plus 50 years. Another important minimum rule established by the Berne Convention is that copyright arises with the creation of a work and does not depend upon any formality such as a system of public registration (Article 5(2)). At the time some countries did require registration of copyright, and when Britain implemented the Berne Convention in the Copyright Act 1911 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5. c. 46) it had to abolish its system of registration at Stationers&#x27; Hall.

The Berne Convention focuses on authors as the key figure in copyright law and the stated purpose of the convention is &quot;the protection of the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works&quot; (Article 1), rather than the protection of publishers and other actors in the process of disseminating works to the public. In the 1928 revision the concept of moral rights was introduced (Article 6bis), giving authors the right to be identified as a such and to object to derogatory treatment of their works. These rights, unlike economic rights such as preventing reproduction, could not be transferred to others.

The Berne Convention also enshrined limitations and exceptions to copyright, enabling the reproduction of literary and artistic works without the copyright owners prior permission. The detail of these exceptions was left to national copyright legislation, but the guiding principle is stated in Article 9 of the convention. The so-called three-step test holds that an exception is only permitted &quot;in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author&quot;. Free use of copyrighted work is expressly permitted in the case of quotations from lawfully published works, illustration for teaching purposes, and news reporting (Article 10).

==Copyright in communist countries==
==Copyright and technology==
* Digital technology introduces a new level of controversy into copyright policy.
* Inclusion of software as copyright subject matter on the recommendation of CONTU and then later with the EU Computer Programs Directive.
* Enactment of Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).
* Controversy over the copyrightability of databases (&quot;Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service&quot; and contradictory cases); links to the debate over sui generis database rights.
* Enactment of the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty; nations begin passing anti-circumvention laws.

Commentators such as Barlow (1994) have argued that digital copyright is fundamentally different and will remain persistently difficult to enforce; others such as Richard Stallman (1996) have argued that the Internet deeply undermines the economic rationale for copyright in the first place. These perspectives may lead to the consideration of alternative compensation systems in place of exclusive rights for all types of information, including software, books, movies, and music.

==Expansions in scope and operation==
* Move from common law and ad hoc grants of monopoly to copyright statutes.
* Expansions in subject matter (largely related to technology).
* Expansions on duration.
* Creation of new exclusive rights (such as performers&#x27; and other neighbouring rights).
* Creation of collecting societies.
* Criminalisation of copyright infringement.
* Creation of anti-circumvention laws.
* Courts&#x27; application of secondary liability doctrines to cover file sharing networks

<text>Lawrence Douglas &quot;Butch&quot; Morris (February 10, 1947 – January 29, 2013) was an American cornetist, composer and conductor. He was known for pioneering his structural improvisation method, &quot;Conduction&quot;, which he utilized on many recordings.

==Biography==
Morris was born in Long Beach, California, United States. Before beginning his musical career, he served in the U.S. Army as a medic in Germany, Japan and Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Morris came to attention with saxophonist David Murray&#x27;s groups in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Morris&#x27;s brother, double bassist Wilber Morris, sometimes performed and recorded with Murray during this period. Morris led a group called Orchestra SLANG. The group features Drummer Kenny Wollesen, alto saxophonist Jonathon Haffner, trumpeter Kirk Knuffke and others. He performed and presented regularly as part of the Festival of New Trumpet Music, held annually in New York City. Morris wrote most of the incidental music for the 1989 TV show, &quot;A Man Called Hawk&quot;, which starred Avery Brooks, with whom he co-wrote the theme music, along with Stanley Clarke. He also played with well-known artist and would-be drummer A.R. Penck in 1990. For AudioBox Matera 1990: International Festival of Sound Experimentation (Pinotto Fava, curator), Morris created &quot;Spiriti Materani&quot; featuring Wayne Horvitz (keyboards, electronics), J. A. Deane (trombone, electronics), and Butch (cornet). The project took place in Madonna delle Virtù, a 12th-century rupestrian church in Sasso Caveoso, Matera, Italy.

Morris is the originator of &quot;Conduction&quot; (a term borrowed from physics), a type of structured free improvisation where Morris directs and conducts an improvising ensemble with a series of hand and baton gestures. These conductions have received generally positive reviews, and are often considered quite unique, not quite fitting into any one musical genre. Critic Thom Jurek has written, &quot;There are no records like Butch Morris&#x27; conduction sides, nor could there be, though he wishes there were.&quot; and Ed Hazell writes, &quot;At his best, Morris can shake players out of their old habits, or place a microscope on one aspect of a musician&#x27;s artistry and build an orchestral fantasia around it.&quot;

Morris died of lung cancer on January 29, 2013, at the age of 65 in a hospital in New York City.

<text>Texas root rot (also known as Phymatotrichopsis root rot, Phymatotrichum root rot, cotton root rot, or, in the older literature, Ozonium root rot) is a
disease that is fairly common in Mexico and the southwestern United States resulting in sudden wilt and death of affected plants, usually during the warmer months. It is caused by a soil-borne fungus named Phymatotrichopsis omnivora that attacks the roots of susceptible plants. It was first discovered in 1888 by Pammel and later named by Duggar in 1916.

A monograph of this disease, which includes a historical review, was written by R.B. Streets and H.E. Bloss in 1973.

== Host and symptoms ==
&quot;Phymatotrichopsis omnivora&quot; is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that has a very broad host range, attacking almost 2000 dicotyledonous species. It inhabits alkaline, calcareous soils in southwestern United States. It particularly targets dicots as most monocots are immune. Economically important plant hosts affected by the pathogen include: peanuts, cotton, alfalfa, apple, pecans, and ornamental trees.

First symptom of disease is often chlorosis of the leaves then followed by browning and wilting. Two weeks after the first symptoms appear, the plant dies. In the field, infected cotton plants exhibit wilting in the mid to late summer form large circular patches and later die. Upon closer examination, the host plant&#x27;s vascular system show extensive discoloration. Beneath the soil surface, other observable signs are present. Distinctive cruciform branched hyphae develop on infected root tissue which are observable with compound microscope (Figure 1). In addition, taproots of the infect plant are covered in mycelial strands.

Another macroscopic sign is tan and white spore mats developed on the soil surface near the infected plants during favorable high moisture environmental conditions. Despite the name, these spore mats are not known to aid in dispersal. Although presence of the conidial phase on the spore mats is known, the function of the conidia remains unknown since conidial germination is rarely observed.

== Environment ==
The highest concentrations of Texas root rot disease are found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, with cases also reported in India and Pakistan. Texas root rot is caused by a pathogen that prefers alkaline and calcareous soils (pH between 7-8.5), affording the potential for control via soil amendment. Scientific research has discovered that both high precipitation and high temperatures (below ) are further environmental enhancers for Texas root rot by increasing its virulence.

The pathogen earned its common name because of the geographical area where it is most prevalent, the cotton-growing region of Texas. Texas, an area located in the southern half of the United States, receives an annual rainfall between and less than . Researchers collected data on Texas root rot virulence over 13 years at the Blackland Research Center using cotton plants infected with Texas root rot and found that virulence correlates somewhat with precipitation in the range of of rainfall. Higher virulence of Texas root rot was observed after large precipitation events. These experimental findings support the conclusion that Texas root rot preferentially develops in wet over dry soil conditions. The same study also found that virulence of Texas root rot develops inversely to air temperatures over 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

The symptoms of Texas root rot are most severe during hot summers when air temperature increases the average soil temperature over . The elevation in temperatures produces Texas root rot&#x27;s most severe symptoms: wilting and bronze colored leaves. The pathogen is only active in the summer months when the high average temperatures can heat the soil microclimate one foot deep over .

TRR is a pathogen of quarantine concern for Ukraine.

== Disease cycle ==

The disease overwinters as sclerotia or as mycelium on dead plant tissue. In spring to early summer, the germination phase begins with hyphae growth and root colonization. In middle and late summer, the disease reaches its infectious stage when associated symptoms are observed. The pathogen penetrates the host and colonize plant root tissue causing a root rot. This results in the first symptoms of the disease manifested by chlorotic leaves and eventually wilting. Root rot disease rings enlarge, and the field can be categorized into three zones based upon plant status: asymptomatic, disease front and survivor. The pathogen disseminates by infecting neighboring plants, with infected plant tissue serving as a secondary inoculum and further spreading the disease. In situations of high moisture, conidia are produced on spore mats but their role in dispersal is unknown since conidia rarely germinate.

&quot;P. omnivora&quot; forms several kinds of differentiated hyphae. Initially, hyphae emerge from sclerotia overwintering in soil. Sclerotia are the primary inoculum in affected fields. The emerging hyphae either infects the host root or form mycelial strands with a differentiated rind. Upon contact with host roots, &quot;P. omnivora&quot; forms a mycelial mantle on the root&#x27;s surface. This leads to necrosis of epidermis and underlying cortical tissue, leading to root lesions. As the disease progresses, the roots are covered by the characteristic cinnamon-colored mycelial strands covered with acircular sterile hyphae, a diagnostic sign of Texas Root Rot. The roots at later stages of infection show extensive vascular discoloration due to root necrosis. The mycelial strands and symptom development in field-infected roots are especially conspicuous on cotton. During the late summer and fall, mycelial strands formed on the root surfaces or in the soil form sclerotia to survive the winter, thus completing the life cycle.

== Pathogenesis ==
As a soil borne pathogen, &quot;P. omnivora&quot; enters the plant host via the roots. It penetrates the host by growing infectious hyphae that cover the host plant root&#x27;s epidermis and eventually infects epidermis and cortical cell junctions of plant host instead of having specialized penetration organs like an appressoria. From there the fungal pathogen infects root vascular system and begin cause cortical root lesions, which is most pronounced in cotton. Microarray analysis and gene expression profiling revealed that certain pathways related to plant defense such as jasmonic acid, ethylene, and flavonoid production were reduced at later infectious stages. This suggests that &quot;P. omnivora&quot; is able to suppress the production of these phytochemical defenses to ensure disease success.

== Control ==
The most common management strategy to limit the spread and damage produced by Texas root rot is soil manipulation. The goal of soil manipulation is to create a soil environment that is not favorable to Texas root rot to limit its activity. A common approach is to change the soil acidity/soil pH because the pathogen prefers alkaline soils. A recommended method to decrease soil pH is through the application of ammonium sulfate or ammonium phosphate fertilizer at around per . Applications of fertilizer in this manner causes the soil pH to decrease making it less favorable to Texas root rot disease which prefers a more basic soil environment. This management method is impracticable for any moderate or large scale agricultural operation because of the cost required to amend large areas of soil. However, it is well-suited for hobby gardens or other small scale operations.

Texas root displays a varied infection pattern so the most effective treatment plans contain a variety of management strategies. Other control methods for Texas root rot are deep plowing of the soil post-harvest, the establishment of protective plant barriers, and the incorporation of organic crop residues into the soil. Deep plowing after harvest breaks up potentially infected soil deep and has been shown to combat Texas root rot by disrupting the pathogen’s ability to form sclerotia.

The planting of resistant grass crops, such as sorghum, to surround an already infected area can limit the spread of Texas root rot to other areas. By surrounding susceptible crops with immune grasses, a barrier layer in the soil can be created to block root infection of susceptible crops.

Organic amendments are an effective treatment against Texas root rot when applied to the soil before spring planting. The most effective amendment is composed of residues from wheat, oats, and other cereal crops. Though sources disagree, crop rotation is not an effective control method because of Texas root rot’s wide host range of over 2,000 host species. Overall, it is best to avoid areas known to suffer from the Texas root rot because no management technique is a guarantee to control the pathogen.

== Importance ==
Texas root rot (&quot;Phymatotrichopsis omnivora&quot;) is regarded as one of the most impactful diseases of woody dicotyledon plants in large part because of its wide array of dicotyledon host plants, featuring one of the largest host ranges of any known fungal pathogen with over 2,000 possible host species. Though Texas root rot has been studied since 1888, there are few effective management tools because of the unique biological characteristics of the pathogen. Namely, its ability to last virtually indefinitely in soil and its capacity to survive on roots of native vegetation without producing symptoms. The species&#x27; broad host range also makes management difficult because disease populations can be maintained across various host species.

Texas root rot presents a serious economic threat to cotton growers with losses of upwards of $29 million in cotton found in Texas as estimated by Texas A&amp;M.

<doc id="336211" wikidata="Q1356041" url="?curid=336211" title="Ern Malley hoax">
<text>The Ern Malley hoax, also called the Ern Malley affair, is Australia&#x27;s most famous literary hoax. Its name derives from Ernest Lalor &quot;Ern&quot; Malley, a fictitious poet whose biography and body of work were created in one day in 1943 by conservative writers James McAuley and Harold Stewart in order to hoax the Angry Penguins, a modernist art and literary movement centred around a journal of the same name, co-edited by poet Max Harris and art patron John Reed, of Heide, Melbourne.

Imitating the modernist poetry they despised, the hoaxers deliberately created what they thought was bad verse and mailed sixteen poems to Harris under the guise of Ethel, Ern Malley&#x27;s surviving sister. Harris and other members of the Heide Circle fell for the hoax, and, enraptured by the poetry, devoted the next issue of &quot;Angry Penguins&quot; to Malley, hailing him as a genius. The hoax was revealed soon after, resulting in a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; and the humiliation of Harris, who was put on trial, convicted and fined for publishing the poems on the grounds that they contained obscene content. &quot;Angry Penguins&quot; folded in 1946.

In the decades that followed, the hoax proved to be a significant setback for modernist poetry in Australia. Since the 1970s, however, the Ern Malley poems, though known to be a hoax, became celebrated as a successful example of surrealist poetry in their own right, lauded by poets and critics such as John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch and Robert Hughes. The poems of Ern Malley are now more widely read than those of his creators, and the affair has inspired works by major Australian writers and artists, such as Peter Carey and Sidney Nolan. American poet and anthologist David Lehman called Ern Malley &quot;the greatest literary hoax of the twentieth century&quot;.

== Background ==
In 1944, James McAuley and Harold Stewart were in the Army Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs. Before the war they had been part of Sydney&#x27;s Bohemian arts world. McAuley had acted and sung in left-wing revues at Sydney University.

Harris was a 22-year-old &quot;avant-garde&quot; poet and critic in Adelaide, who in 1940, at the age of 18, had started &quot;Angry Penguins&quot;.

== Creating the hoax ==

McAuley and Stewart decided to perpetrate a hoax on Harris and &quot;Angry Penguins&quot; by submitting nonsensical poetry to the magazine under the guise of a fictional poet. They created a fictional biography for the poet, whom they christened &quot;Ernest Lalor Malley&quot;. The name is a &quot;highly Australian-sounding handle&quot;: &quot;Malley&quot; is a pun on the word &quot;mallee&quot;, denoting a class of Australian vegetation and a bird, the native malleefowl. &quot;Lalor&quot; recalls Peter Lalor, leader of the 1854 Eureka Rebellion. The biography stated that Malley had died the year before at the age of 25. The entire body of work attributed to Malley - 17 poems, none longer than a page and intended to be read in sequence under the title &quot;The Darkening Ecliptic&quot; - was written in a single afternoon. The works submitted captured, they felt, the worst of modernist tendencies.

Their writing process, as they described it, was to write down the first thing that came into their heads, lifting words and phrases from the &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary&quot;, a &quot;Collected Shakespeare&quot;, and a &quot;Dictionary of Quotations&quot;: &quot;We opened books at random, choosing a word or phrase haphazardly. We made lists of these and wove them in nonsensical sentences. We misquoted and made false allusions. We deliberately perpetrated bad verse, and selected awkward rhymes from a &quot;Ripman&#x27;s Rhyming Dictionary&quot;.&quot; They also included many bits of their own poetry, though in a deliberately disjointed manner.

The first poem in the sequence, &quot;Durer: Innsbruck, 1495&quot;, was an unpublished serious effort by McAuley, edited to appeal to Harris:
&lt;poem&gt;I had often cowled in the slumbrous heavy air,
Closed my inanimate lids to find it real,
As I knew it would be, the colourful spires
And painted roofs, the high snows glimpsed at the back,
All reversed in the quiet reflecting waters –
Not knowing then that Durer perceived it too.
Now I find that once more I have shrunk
To an interloper, robber of dead men&#x27;s dream,
I had read in books that art is not easy
But no one warned that the mind repeats
In its ignorance the vision of others. I am still
The black swan of trespass on alien waters.&lt;/poem&gt;

David Brooks theorises in his 2011 book, &quot;The Sons of Clovis: Ern Malley, Adoré Floupette and a Secret History of Australian Poetry&quot;, that the Ern Malley hoax was modelled on the 1885 satire on French Symbolism and the Decadent movement, &quot;Les Déliquescences d&#x27;Adoré Floupette&quot;, by Henri Beauclair and Gabriel Vicaire. Stewart claimed to have never heard of Floupette at the time of the Ern Malley hoax, and while there is no evidence McAuley had, his Masters thesis titled &quot;Symbolism: an essay in poetics&quot;, included a study of French Symboliste poetry and poetics.

== Biography of &quot;Ern Malley&quot; ==

According to his inventors&#x27; fictitious biography, Ernest Lalor Malley was born in Liverpool, England, on 14 March 1918. His father died in 1920, and Malley&#x27;s mother migrated to Petersham, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, with her two children: Ern, and his older sister Ethel. After his mother&#x27;s death in August 1933, Ern Malley left school to work as an auto mechanic. Shortly after his seventeenth birthday, he then moved to Melbourne where he lived alone and worked as an insurance salesman, and later as a watch repairman. Diagnosed with Graves&#x27; disease sometime in the early 1940s, Malley refused treatment. He returned to Sydney, moving in with his sister in March, 1943, where he became increasingly ill (as well as temperamental and difficult) until his death at the age of 25 on 23 July of that same year.

Malley&#x27;s life as a poet became known only after his sister Ethel (another fictitious creation of McAuley and Stewart) found a pile of unpublished poems among his belongings. These poems featured a brief preface, which explained that they had been composed over a period of five years, but it left no instructions as to what was to be done with them. Ethel Malley supposedly knew nothing about poetry, but showed the poems to a friend, who suggested that she send the poems to someone who could examine them. Max Harris of &quot;Angry Penguins&quot; was to be that someone.

== Carrying out the hoax ==
McAuley and Stewart then sent Harris a letter, purported to be from Ethel, containing the poems, and asking for his opinion of her late brother&#x27;s work.

Harris read the poems with, as he later recalled, a mounting sense of excitement. Ern Malley, he thought, was a poet in the same class as W. H. Auden or Dylan Thomas. He showed them to his circle of literary friends, who agreed that a hitherto completely unknown modernist poet of great importance had been discovered in suburban Australia. He decided to rush out a special edition of &quot;Angry Penguins&quot; and commissioned a painting by Sidney Nolan, based on the poems, for the cover.

The Autumn 1944 edition of &quot;Angry Penguins&quot; appeared in June 1944 owing to wartime printing delays. Harris eagerly promoted it around the small world of Australian writers and critics. The reaction was not what he had hoped or expected. An article appeared in the University of Adelaide student newspaper, &quot;On Dit&quot;, ridiculing the Malley poems and suggesting that Harris had written them himself in some elaborate hoax.

== The hoax revealed ==

On 17 June, the Adelaide &quot;Daily Mail&quot; raised the possibility that Harris was the hoaxed rather than the hoaxer. Alarmed, Harris hired a private detective to establish whether Ern and Ethel Malley existed or had ever done so, but by then, the Australian national press was on the trail. The next week, the Sydney &quot;Sunday Sun&quot;, which had been conducting some investigative reporting, ran a front-page story alleging that the Ern Malley poems had in fact been written by McAuley and Stewart.

The South Australian police impounded the issue of &quot;Angry Penguins&quot; devoted to &quot;The Darkening Ecliptic&quot; on the grounds that Malley&#x27;s poems were obscene.

After the hoax was revealed, McAuley and Stewart wrote:
Mr. Max Harris and other &quot;Angry Penguins&quot; writers represent an Australian outcrop of a literary fashion which has become prominent in England and America. The distinctive feature of the fashion, it seemed to us, was that it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary discrimination. Our feeling was that by processes of critical self-delusion and mutual admiration, the perpetrators of this humourless nonsense had managed to pass it off on would-be &quot;intellectuals&quot; and &quot;Bohemians&quot;, both here and abroad, as &quot;great poetry&quot;. ... However, it was possible that we had simply failed to penetrate to the inward substance of these productions. The only way of settling the matter was by way of experiment. It was, after all, fair enough. If Mr Harris proved to have sufficient discrimination to reject the poems, then the tables would have been turned.

== Immediate impact ==
The South Australian police prosecuted Harris for publishing immoral and obscene material. The only prosecution witness was a police detective, whose evidence included the statement &#x27;I don&#x27;t know what &quot;incestuous&quot; means, but I think there is a suggestion of indecency about it&#x27;. Despite this, and several distinguished expert witnesses arguing for Harris, he was found guilty and fined £5. &quot;Angry Penguins&quot; soon folded.

Most people, including most educated people with an interest in the arts, were persuaded of the validity of McAuley and Stewart&#x27;s &quot;experiment&quot;. The two had deliberately written bad poetry, passed it off under a plausible alias to the country&#x27;s most prominent publisher of modernist poetry, and completely taken him in. Harris, they said, could not tell real poetry from fake, good from bad. 

For services to Australian literature, Ern Malley was awarded the degree of &quot;Doctor of Science in Oxometry&quot; by the Sydney University Oxometrical Society.

The Ern Malley hoax had long-lasting repercussions. To quote the &quot;Oxford Companion to Australian Literature&quot;, &quot;More important than the hoax itself was the effect it had on the development of Australian poetry. The vigorous and legitimate movement for modernism in Australian writing, espoused by many writers and critics in addition to the members of the &quot;Angry Penguins&quot; group, received a severe setback, and the conservative element was undoubtedly strengthened.&quot;

In a 1975 interview with Earle Hackett, Sidney Nolan credited Ern Malley with inspiring him to paint his first Ned Kelly series (1946–47), saying &quot;It made me take the risk of putting against the Australian bush an utterly strange object.&quot;

== McAuley, Stewart and Harris in later years ==
McAuley went on to publish several volumes of poetry and, with Richard Krygier, founded the literary and cultural journal &quot;Quadrant&quot;. From 1961 he was professor of English at the University of Tasmania. He died in 1976.

Stewart settled permanently in Japan in 1966 and published two volumes of haiku poetry translations which became popular in Australia. He died in 1995.

Harris, however, once he recovered from his humiliation in the Ern Malley hoax, made the best of his notoriety. From 1951 to 1955, he published another literary magazine, which he called &quot;Ern Malley&#x27;s Journal&quot;. In 1961, as a gesture of defiance, he re-published the Ern Malley poems, maintaining that whatever McAuley and Stewart had &quot;intended&quot; to do, they had, in fact, produced some memorable poems. Harris went on to become a successful bookseller and newspaper columnist. Harris died in 1995.

== Subsequent re-appreciation ==
The fictional Ern Malley achieved a measure of celebrity. The poems are regularly re-published and quoted. There have been at least 20 publications of the &quot;Darkening Ecliptic&quot;, either complete or partial. It has reappeared – not only in Australia, but in London, Paris, Lyons, Kyoto, New York and Los Angeles – with a regularity that would be the envy of any real Australian poet.

Some literary critics take the view that McAuley and Stewart outsmarted themselves in their concoction of the Ern Malley poems. &quot;Sometimes the myth is greater than its creators,&quot; Max Harris wrote. Harris, of course, had a vested interest in Malley, but others have agreed with his assessment. Robert Hughes wrote:

The basic case made by Ern&#x27;s defenders was that his creation proved the validity of surrealist procedures: that in letting down their guard, opening themselves to free association and chance, McAuley and Stewart had reached inspiration by the side-door of parody; and though this can&#x27;t be argued on behalf of all the poems, some of which are partly or wholly gibberish, it contains a ponderable truth... The energy of invention that McAuley and Stewart brought to their concoction of Ern Malley created an icon of literary value, and that is why he continues to haunt our culture.

In the &quot;Individual Notes on Works and Authors&quot; in the &quot;Special Collaborations Issue&quot; of Locus Solus, Kenneth Koch wrote, &quot;Though Harris was wrong about who Ern Malley &#x27;was&#x27; (if one can use that word here), I find it hard not to agree with his judgment of Malley&#x27;s poetry.&quot;

The American poet John Ashbery said of Ern Malley, in a 1988 interview in the magazine &quot;Jacket&quot;:
I think it was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I discovered a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry – which I&#x27;d never been able to lay my hands on very much until then – and they had the original edition of &quot;The Darkening Ecliptic&quot; with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry – of which there really wasn&#x27;t very much in English in America at the time – and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course [at Brooklyn College, NY], which I&#x27;m always rather hard put to do, since we haven&#x27;t really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up there is no way of examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn&#x27;t have to pass an examination because they&#x27;re poets who are writing poetry, and I don&#x27;t like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley&#x27;s poems and another forbiddingly modern poem – frequently one of Geoffrey Hill&#x27;s &#x27;Mercian Hymns&#x27;. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud... [the] fraudulent poem.

Two exhibitions by major Australian galleries have been based on Ern Malley. In 1974 the Art Gallery of South Australia&#x27;s Adelaide Festival Exhibitions included the Sidney Nolan exhibition &quot;Ern Malley and Paradise Garden&quot;. The 2009 exhibition &quot;Ern Malley: The Hoax and Beyond&quot; at Heide Museum of Modern Art was the first exhibition to thoroughly investigate the genesis, reception and aftermath of the hoax.

It has been suggested that Malley is better known and more widely read today than either McAuley or Stewart.

In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, David Lehman wrote,
== References to Ern Malley and the hoax ==

Sumner Locke Elliott wrote a 1955 American television play based on the hoax, &quot;Daisy, Daisy&quot; (1955).

The Australian historian Humphrey McQueen alluded to the poems in calling his 1979 history of modernism in Australia &quot;The Black Swan of Trespass&quot;.

Several works of fiction attribute the poems to a third party who actually wrote them; they then fall into the hands of McAuley and Stewart. In 1977 in &quot;Overland&quot;, Barbara Ker Wilson wrote a short story &quot;Black Swan of Trespass&quot;, in which she has Davydd Davis, whom she presents as an antipodean Dylan Thomas, writing the poems. &quot;Malarky Dry&quot;, by Ian Kennedy Williams, was published in 1990 and tells of a sickly, insipid Ern who writes a manual of motorcycle maintenance while a boring bureaucrat Henry Fitzhubert-Ireland writes the poems. Two more recent fictions invent a &quot;real&quot; Ern: &quot;Strangers in the House of the Mind&quot; which appears in Martin Edmond&#x27;s 2007 collection &quot;Waimarino County &amp; Other Excursions&quot;, and David Malley&#x27;s &quot;Beyond is Anything&quot;.

Joanna Murray-Smith&#x27;s play &quot;Angry Young Penguins&quot; (1987) is based on these events.

Peter Carey&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;My Life as a Fake&quot; draws some of its inspiration from the Ern Malley affair. Elliot Perlman recounts the tale of the Ern Malley hoax in his 2003 novel &quot;Seven Types of Ambiguity&quot;. In 2005, &quot;The Black Swan of Trespass&quot;, a surrealist play about the real life of a fictional Ern Malley by Lally Katz and Chris Kohn, premiered at the Melbourne Malthouse Theatre.

In the early years of the 21st century, the artist Garry Shead produced a series of well-received paintings based on the Ern Malley hoax.

In the 2013 novel &quot;Cairo&quot;, after the success of a fictionalized version of the theft of the one of Picasso&#x27;s studies for &quot;The Weeping Woman&quot;, one of characters quotes Malley&#x27;s &quot;Durer: Innsbruck, 1495&quot;.

Stephen Orr&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;Sincerely, Ethel Malley&quot; is a reimagining of the Ern Malley story using Ern&#x27;s sister, Ethel Malley, as the narrator and protagonist.

<text>Bo Hi Pak (August 18, 1930 – January 12, 2019 in Korea. Korean: 박보희/朴普熙) was a prominent member of the Unification Church. During the 1970s and 1980s, he was a major leader in the church movement, leading projects such as newspapers (notably &quot;The Washington Times&quot;), schools, performing arts projects, political projects such as the anti-communist organization CAUSA International, and was president of the Unification Church International 1977–1991. He was also the president of Little Angels Children&#x27;s Folk Ballet of Korea.

== Life ==
Pak was a lieutenant colonel in the South Korean military when he joined the Unification Church in the 1950s. Serving church founder Sun Myung Moon as his main English interpreter during speaking tours in the United States, he was referred to in the media as Moon&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man&quot; (or similarly), such as &quot;Moon&#x27;s top deputy&quot;.

He was the central figure in Moon&#x27;s publishing businesses, including founding President and Publisher, &quot;The News World&quot; (later renamed &quot;New York City Tribune&quot;); founding President and Chairman of the Board, the Washington Times Corporation; and President, World Media Association.

In 1976 Pak incorporated True World Foods which became the largest sushi supplier in America.

In 1977/1978, Pak testified before the Fraser Committee in its investigation of the Unification Church, commenting: &quot;I am a proud Korean – a proud Moonie – and a dedicated anti-Communist and I intend to remain so the rest of my life.&quot; In response to the adversarial investigation, Pak wrote &quot;Truth is My Sword&quot;. Alexander Haig commented in the introduction: &quot;From the battlefield of the Korean peninsula to the halls of the U.S. Congress, Dr. Pak&#x27;s speeches mirror the convictions of an individual whose ardent sense of justice has always been the cornerstone of his advocacy of personal freedom and democracy.&quot;

In 1984 Pak was kidnapped in New York City and held for ransom. The FBI arrested the kidnappers, who claimed that the crime was an attempt to change Unification Church policy.

In 1987 at a church gathering, a Zimbabwean Unification Church member who was thought by Moon to be the continuous &quot;channel&quot; on earth for his deceased son Heung Jin Moon, &quot;beat Bo Hi Pak so badly that he was hospitalized for a week in Georgetown Hospital.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;Later, Pak underwent surgery in South Korea to repair a blood vessel in his skull, according to Times executives.&quot;

In 1994, Pak visited North Korea to attend the funeral of President Kim Il Sung, risking legal trouble by the South Korean government in doing so. In 1998 he visited again, leading a trade delegation representing Unification Church interests with the blessing of the South Korean government.

On July 20, 2004 the Eastern Seoul District Prosecutor imprisoned Pak and charged him with financial fraud because he was unable to repay his debts to Korean businessmen. In 2006, Pak was released on probation after serving 2 years and 3 ½ months. On November 6, 2006, he sent a letter to be distributed by Unification Church publications worldwide to give an account of his experiences in prison. In the letter he wrote:

<text>The history of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) intertwines in its early stages with history of the Haganah.

== Before 1948 ==

Following the 1947 UN Partition Plan, which divided the British Mandate of Palestine, the country became increasingly volatile and fell into a state of civil war between the Jews and Arabs after the Arab residents rejected any plan that would allow for the displacement of so many Arabs. In accordance with Plan Dalet the Haganah tried to secure the areas allotted to the Jewish state in the partition plan and the blocks of settlements that were in the area allotted to the Arab state.

== 1948 Arab–Israeli War ==
David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the Israeli Declaration of Independence on 14 May 1948. His first order was the formation of the IDF – The Israel Defense Forces.

The IDF was based on the personnel who had served in the Haganah and the Palmach (itself the elite force of the Haganah) and was declared as the only legal armed force in Israel. Another main source of manpower were the immigrants from Europe. Some of them Holocaust survivors and others veterans from World War II.

Following the declaration of independence in 1948, Arab armies invaded Israel. Egypt came from the south, Lebanon and Syria from the north, and Jordan from the east backed by Iraqi and Saudi troops, in what Azzam Pasha, Arab League Secretary speaking on Cairo radio, declared would be &quot;a war of extermination and a momentous massacre.&quot;

In the initial phase of the war, the IDF was inferior in both numbers and armament. Invading Arab armies boasted 270 tanks, 150 field guns and 300 aircraft. The IDF had zero planes and three tanks. Due to a number of reasons, the Arabs never managed to exploit their superiority in numbers. The Israelis managed to successfully defend themselves in virtually all battlefields with the notable exception of East Jerusalem. After the first truce 11 June to 8 July, the Israelis managed to seize the initiative due to new troop enrollments and supplies of arms. Notable achievements of the IDF include the conquest of Eilat (Um Rashrash), Nazareth, and the capture of the Galilee and the Negev.

The war continued until 20 July 1949, when the armistice with Syria was signed. By then the IDF had managed to repel the Egyptians to the Gaza Strip while Jordan took over the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.

See 1949 Armistice Agreements.

==Founding==

The evolution from several underground militias to a state army is not simple. Many in the Haganah felt it was their High Command&#x27;s natural role to become the leadership of the new army. The First Law of the Provisional State Council, Paragraph 18, of the Order of Government and Legal Arrangement stated that &quot;the Provisional Government is empowered to set up armed forces on land, sea and air, which will be authorised to carry out all necessary and legal actions for the defence of the country.&quot; The sensitivity of this issue is indicated by the delay of two weeks before, on 26 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion, for the Provisional Government, published the Israel Defense Forces Ordinance Number 4. It covered the establishment of the IDF, conscription duties, the oath of allegiance, and the prohibition of any other armed forces. The execution of the Ordinance was assigned to the Minister of Defence, David Ben-Gurion. His priority was the dissolution of military organisations affiliated to political parties. This led to a series of confrontations with leaders of the Palmach known as The General&#x27;s Revolt.

The army was officially set up on 31 May. This involved renaming existing Haganah and Palmach Brigades and bringing them under one central command. Its officers began to take their oaths of allegiance on 27 June. Lehi and Irgun came under central control in the following months.

Despite several further ordinances the actual role and responsibilities of the Minister of Defense were not defined. Nor was there any legal definition of the Cabinet&#x27;s civil authority over the army.

== 1949–1956 ==

In those years the IDF started to rebuild itself as a modern army. It acquired heavier weapons and established an armored corps and the Israeli Air Force.

In order to enhance the morale and organization of the army and to combat the resurgent problem with Palestinian infiltration, Unit 101 was formed. It was led by Ariel Sharon, and carried out a number of retaliatory strikes on Jordanian territory to deter the infiltrators. After committing the notorious Qibya Massacre in 1953 it was merged with the Paratroopers Battalions and Sharon became its commander. Unit 101 is regarded as the mother of the IDF&#x27;s strike force units.

In those years the IMI Uzi SMG and the FN FAL rifle were issued as standard infantry weapons.

== Suez Crisis ==
From 1954 and 1955 Egypt established a special force unit known as the Fedayeen. It led to the escalation of hostilities over the Israeli-Egyptian border and eventually contributed to the 1956 Suez War.

In mid 1956, The Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser, encouraged by support from the Soviet Union, nationalized the Suez Canal. In response, United Kingdom and France planned Operation Musketeer (1956) aiming at regaining Western control of the Suez Canal and removing the Egyptian president Nasser. In late 1956, the bellicosity of recent Arab statements prompted Israel to remove the threat of the concentrated Egyptian forces in the Sinai, and Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai peninsula. Other Israeli aims were elimination of the Fedayeen incursions into Israel that made life unbearable for its southern population, and opening the blockaded Straits of Tiran for Israeli ships. Israeli armour, equipped with tanks, such as M4 Sherman and AMX-13 quickly defeated the Egyptian forces and took control over the Sinai within a few days. As agreed, within a couple of days, Britain and France invaded too and recaptured the canal. Britain, France and Israel withdrew from Sinai under international pressure, particularly by the United States. But the IDF had achieved numerous goals; the borders dramatically tranquilized, Nasser promised to disband the Fedayeen, the Straits of Tiran were once again opened to Israeli ships and maybe most important of all, Israel had illustrated its military strength. The successful war elevated the reputation of the IDF and contributed highly to the morale of the soldiers.

== 1956–1966 ==
Following the successful campaign in Sinai, the IDF used this relatively quiet decade to arm on a great scale and increase military professionalism. The main suppliers of weapons was France, which provided Israel rifles, tanks and jet fighters, including the Dassault Mirage III. The peak of France&#x27;s assistance was the construction of the Negev Nuclear Research Center near Dimona in 1960.

== Six-Day War ==
By 1966, Israeli-Arab relations had deteriorated to the point of actual battles taking place between Israeli and Arab forces. In 1967, Egypt expelled UN peacekeepers, stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since 1957, and announced a partial blockade of Israel&#x27;s access to the Red Sea. In May 1967 a number of Arab states began to mobilize their forces. Israel saw these actions as a &quot;casus belli&quot;.

On the morning of 5 June 1967, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) launched a massive airstrike that destroyed the majority of the Egyptian air force on the ground. By noon, the Egyptian, Jordanian and Syrian air forces, with about 450 aircraft, were annihilated. This strike was code-named Operation Focus, &quot;Mivtza Moked&quot;.

The Egyptians persuaded Syria and Jordan to join the war by lying to them and reporting on &quot;amazing victories&quot; at Sinai. The two Arab countries reluctantly joined the war, Jordan by shelling the Israeli part of Jerusalem and Syria by entering Israel from the Golan Heights.

Meanwhile, the IDF ground forces quickly overran the Egyptian army in Sinai and were about to reach Alexandria. About 15,000 Egyptian soldiers were killed, 4482 fell into captivity and 80% of the Egyptian tanks were destroyed. 338 Israeli were killed in Sinai and of Israel&#x27;s losses there were about 63 tanks.

All of the Sinai peninsula was captured. The IDF later captured the Golan Heights from the Syrians and the West Bank from Jordan.

On 7 June Israeli troops (the &quot;Harel&quot; unit; &quot;Yerushalmi&quot; unit; and elite paratroopers accompanied by tanks) captured the Old City of Jerusalem The conquest of the Western Wall and Temple Mount was considered as the highlights of the war and a dramatic and emotional peak by the Israeli people. The reunification of east and west Jerusalem as one city under Jewish control were celebrated widely in Israel.

The Six-Day War had great consequences for the state of Israel and the IDF. In six days Israel had defeated three Arab armies – Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Yitzhak Rabin, Moshe Dayan, Israel Tal, Moshe Peled and Mordechai Gur were admired by the public as &quot;war heroes&quot; while the IAF pilots won unprecedented prestige and were considered to be &quot;the best pilots in the world&quot; (even today, the IAF is considered to be one of the most competent air forces in the world).

==War of Attrition==
Israel&#x27;s alleged pre-emptive strike in the Six Day War resulted in a French embargo banning all weapon sales to Israel. Israel overcame the embargo by finding other suppliers (such as the United States) and developing and making its own weapons. A strategic decision was made then to make an Israeli battle tank, an Israeli fighter jet, and an Israeli warship – for example: the Kfir fighter jet and the Merkava tank.

After the Six-Day War was over, IDF outposts on the Suez Canal were shelled by the Egyptian army. It was a long and bitter war that ended after three years due to Israeli air superiority.

There were also frictions and battles with Syrian forces on the northern border. In the Israeli reprisal operation (&quot;Three Day Battles&quot; 24–27 June 1970) about 350 Syrian soldiers were killed.

==Yom Kippur War==
The Yom Kippur War, also known as the &quot;10th of Ramadan War&quot; in Arab countries, tempered Israeli confidence created after the victory of the Six-Day War. This time, Jordan stayed out and wasn&#x27;t involved in the war. The war opened on 6 October 1973 on Yom Kippur, the holiest Jewish holiday.

Egypt and Syria attempted to regain the territory Israel had acquired in the Six-Day War. Their armies launched a joint surprise attack on the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday (the most sacred Jewish day of all in which each Jew must atone for his sins, pray and avoid eating and drinking) – the Syrian forces attacking fortifications in the Golan Heights and the Egyptian forces attacking fortifications around the Suez Canal and on the Sinai Peninsula. The troops inflicted heavy casualties on the Israeli army. After three weeks of fighting, though, and with U.S. air-lifted reinforcements of weapons and equipment (first shipment arrived on 9 October 1973), the IDF pushed the Syrian forces beyond the original lines.

In the Golan Heights, small groups of tank commanders such as Avigdor Kahalani managed to hold back dozens of Syrian tanks. By 10 October, the IDF recaptured the entire Golan Heights and on 11 October Israeli armored forces invaded Syria and destroyed the Iraqi reinforcements. On 22 October, the &quot;Golani&quot; infantry brigade captured Mount Hermon (an important strategic outpost).

In the Sinai Peninsula, Israeli armor was unable to prevent or push back Egyptian infantry crossing the Suez Canal. Most of the fortified Bar Lev Line was captured within the first two days of the war. Subsequent Israeli counterattacks launched by reserve forces arriving to the front were disastrous, and the Israelis were forced to withdraw to a new defensive line. On 14 October, the Israelis repelled a renewed Egyptian attack, and the following day launched their counteroffensive. On 16 October the Israelis crossed the Suez Canal and attempted to capture the towns of Ismailia and Suez and to cut off Egyptian supply lines. The Israelis failed to capture either town, but succeeded on 24 October in cutting off the supply lines of the Egyptian Third Army to the south after breaking for a few hours a United Nations ceasefire resolution. The price of the war was heavy. 2,800 Israelis were killed and 9,000 were wounded. About 300 Israeli soldiers were taken captive. Egyptian and Syrian casualties are estimated at 15,000 and about 30,000 were wounded. 8,300 Egyptian soldiers and 400 Syrian soldiers were captured.

In Israel, the war caused a public outrage, forcing the government to appoint an investigation commission. The Agranat Commission found serious flaws in the functioning of the &quot;intelligence forecasting&quot; branch, which failed to foresee the war and ignored various warnings. The Chief of Staff, David Elazar (&quot;Dado&quot;) resigned after harsh criticism by the commission. Although the commission praised Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir on her leadership during the war, she resigned following the war and was replaced by Yitzhak Rabin.

== 1974–1978 ==
Until 1974, the IDF was countering Syrian and Egyptian attacks meant to weaken IDF posts on the border and force the Israeli government to withdraw. However, the IDF managed to sustain low casualties. The IDF reprisal strikes on the Egyptians and Syrians inflicted heavy casualties. After international negotiations in 1974, the attacks stopped.

Following the French embargo and the U.S. air-lift of supplies, weapons and ammunition, the IDF started to base itself upon American and Israeli made weapons and technologies. The American M16 assault rifle entered service along with the IMI Galil assault rifle – an Israeli variant of the Soviet AK-47. M14 were issued as sniper rifles along with surplus of M1 Carbines given to the Police.

In those years the IDF invested most of its efforts in countering international terror, such as the Munich Massacre, committed by the PLO following its deportion from Jordan to Lebanon in the &quot;Black September&quot; of 1970. The PLO focused mainly on hijacking airlines and kidnapping and its terrorists hijacked several commercial airline flights.

In 1976, a group of PLO terrorist hijacked an airliner with 83 Israeli passengers and held them hostages in the Entebbe airport in Uganda. Israeli elite SF unit – Sayeret Matkal – went on a complex hostages-rescue operation and managed to save 80 of the passengers, with only one soldier lost, the commander, lt. colonel Yonatan Netanyahu, the elder brother of Benjamin Netanyahu. The operation, officially called Operation Johnathan but widely referred to as Operation Entebbe, is regarded by military experts as one of the brightest and most successful covert operations ever conducted.

In those years the IAF received a new generation of warplanes. In 1977 the first F-15 Eagle American warplanes arrived in Israel and only a year later, they logged their first kill in the world when IAF F-15s shot down Syrian MiG (Mikoyan-Gurevich) fighters. In 1980 the F-16 Fighting Falcon arrived and the model&#x27;s first aerial kill was also credited to the Israeli Air Force.

==1978 South Lebanon conflict==
Because of waves of terrorist attacks (most notably the Coastal Road massacre in which 38 civilians and one soldier were killed) coming from the PLO in Lebanon, the IDF undertook Operation Litani, a wide-ranging and thorough anti-terrorist operation that included occupying part of Southern Lebanon in 1978.

==1979–1981==
In 1979 the first Israeli-made Merkava Mk1 main battle tank entered service. The tank was fully developed and manufactured by Israel and exceeded the enemies&#x27; tanks in every parameter. It first saw active service in Lebanon and proved to be a great success.

In 1979 the Egypt–Israel peace treaty was signed, when Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat agreed on peace in return for Israel returning the entire Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. The peace agreement, still valid today, closed the bitter southern front and let the IDF focus on the raging northern border.

In 1981 the Israeli Air Force destroyed Iraq&#x27;s Osiraq nuclear reactor. The Israeli government suspected that the Iraqis would use the nuclear reactor to build atomic weapons (WMD). On 7 June, four F-16 fighters, covered by F-15 jets, flew 1,100 km to Iraq from Israel, and bombed the nuclear reactor, thus, thwarting the Iraqi nuclear program and severely holding back the Iraqi plans for getting a nuclear bomb.

==1982 Lebanon War and the South Lebanon conflict ==
On 6 June 1982, following an assassination attempt against its ambassador in London by the Abu Nidal Organization, Israeli forces under direction of Defense Minister Ariel Sharon invaded southern Lebanon in their &quot;Operation Peace for the Galilee&quot;. They eventually reached as far north as the capital Beirut in an attempt to drive the PLO forces out of the country.

In 1987 a revolt erupted in the Palestinian territories, leading to the Oslo Accords.

Although the Israelis did succeed in driving the PLO from Beirut and out of Lebanon, they had to remain within southern Lebanon for the next 18 years to secure a buffer zone between other terrorist groups supported by Syria operating in Lebanon and Israel. In 2000, in response to a UN resolution calling for this buffer zone to be maintained by the Lebanese government, and for the Syria to end its occupation of Lebanon, Israel withdrew its troops.

Although Syria eventually withdrew from Lebanon, it maintained its influence via Hezbollah who continued to attack Northern Israel long after the withdrawal had been certified by UNIFL. Four years later, the UN passed resolution 1559 calling for disarming Hezbollah. The failure of the Lebanese government to do so has led to the strengthening of Hezbollah&#x27;s militants and to the building of an immense arsenal of 13,000 rockets all aimed at civilian centers within Israel.

The rocket attacks by Hezbollah continued unabated for the next two years, and it was these attacks coupled with the incursion of Hezbollah militants into Northern Israel to kill and kidnap IDF soldiers that led to the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel.

==1987–1993 First Intifada==
==2000–2005 Second Intifada==
==2006 Lebanon War==

After the abduction of an Israeli soldier by Hamas on 25 June, the IDF began an air and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip to get back their kidnapped soldier, and end the fire of rockets onto Israeli territory.

At 9:05 am on 12 July Hezbollah&#x27;s military wing staged a cross-border attack on two Israeli Humvees. The attacks came two weeks after the beginning of the Gaza-focused Operation Summer Rains. Eight Israeli soldiers were killed and two were captured. Later on 12 July Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called the captures an &quot;act of war&quot; warranting a &quot;severe and harsh response&quot; and threatened to &quot;turn Lebanon&#x27;s clock back 20 years.&quot; In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a military offensive into Lebanon. In the following days, hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah increased to a point of both parties exchanging tough rhetoric and escalating into deadly military campaigns. Israel proceeded by destroying energy and transportation infrastructure throughout Lebanon, focusing on highway infrastructure initially claiming they were trying to prevent the kidnapped soldiers from being removed to Iran. Israeli sources later justified their assault on the infrastructure claiming the roads and airports are used to transport the missiles launched from southern Lebanon toward Israeli civilian population centers. After several days of Israeli attacks Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah declared an &quot;open war&quot; with Israel.

IDF Special Operations took place within the borders of Lebanon. On 22 July Israeli troops in large numbers moved into Lebanon to demolish Hezbollah outposts, and diminish Hezbollah missile capabilities.

<text>Yongsan Garrison (; Hanja: ), meaning &quot;dragon hill garrison&quot;, is an area located in the Yongsan District of central Seoul, South Korea. The site served as the headquarters for U.S. military forces stationed in South Korea, known as United States Forces Korea (USFK), and as United States Army Garrison Yongsan (USAG-Yongsan) until 2018, under the supervision of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Installation Management Command Pacific Region. From 1910 to 1945 it served as headquarters for the Imperial Japanese Army in Korea.

The USFK headquarters relocated to the new $11 billion Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek south of Seoul in 2018, as part of the Yongsan Relocation Plan. By the end of 2019, more than 20,000 U.S. troops and family members will have been relocated to the new Camp Humphreys facility south of Seoul. While most of the land will be returned to the South Korean government, the U.S. will retain a small portion of land in order to keep open the Dragon Hill Lodge military resort hotel and for a future site to relocate the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. Korean officials are still debating the future use of the land being returned, with some calling for a large park and others calling for more affordable housing.

==History==
Yongsan Garrison&#x27;s land had traditionally been the site of military facilities under former Korean kingdoms. In 1882, Qing troops used it during the Imo Incident. During that time, the area was on the outskirts of the city in mostly undeveloped land. The Imperial Japanese Army formally established the garrison and from 1910 to 1945 it served as its headquarters in Korea. Since then, the city of Seoul has spread to envelop Yongsan Garrison.

Yongsan Garrison has been used by the United States Army as Garrison Yongsan (USAG-Yongsan), under the supervision of the Installation Management Command Pacific Region.

In November 1992 some 297,000 square meters (77 acres) of land, including a golf course, was given back to the City of Seoul to become Yongsan Family Park and the site of the National Museum of Korea. The opening of the completed National Museum was delayed several years while the fate of a U.S. Army helicopter landing facility (H-208) was decided (its approach path and landing pads were directly in front of the museum).

In April 2003 South Korea and the United States agreed on the early relocation of Yongsan Garrison outside of central Seoul.

In August 2008, U.S. President George W. Bush spoke to U.S. and South Korean military personnel, their families, and civilian employees at Yongsan Garrison&#x27;s Collier Field House, 6 as part of his final visit to Asia. During his speech, Bush said,&quot;Fifty-five years have passed since the guns went quiet and the cease-fire was signed on this peninsula, and since that time our forces have kept the peace. Our nations have built a robust alliance&quot;. He also said that the U.S. would keep its military in South Korea, while returning some bases to South Korean control.

In February 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited senior U.S. and South Korean military leaders at the Combined Forces Command headquarters at Yongsan Garrison on her first official trip overseas as the United States&#x27; Secretary of State.

In 2009 &quot;The Korea Times&quot; reported that defense ministry officials said that South Korea and the United States have agreed to complete the relocation of the U.S. military headquarters in Yongsan to an expanded military base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, by 2014. The plan was delayed to 2018. The 2018 estimates place the relocation completing in 2019 or 2020.

South Korea had traditionally regarded this garrison as insurance against the U.S. Army abandoning Seoul, located only about 65 km from the DMZ. As part of the relocation and the planned withdrawal of U.S. troops near the DMZ, all American troops would be pulled back from north of the Han River. A December 2014 agreement between the South Koreans and the U.S. declared that one U.S. Army brigade would be allowed to remain &quot;north of the Han River&quot;; it is believed this means on or near the present U.S. Army Camp Casey in Dongducheon City.

The Embassy of the United States in Seoul may build a new chancery on part of the land planned to be vacated by the U.S. Army, most probably on Camp Coiner. Most of the U.S. Embassy officials live in an embassy housing compound in an area almost completely enveloped by Yongsan Garrison, and with direct access to it.

==Facilities==
Many of the older, dark-colored brick buildings on the base are former Japanese army buildings and are used by U.S. forces, most notably the Eighth Army headquarters building. Directly across from Eighth Army headquarters is the Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea headquarters, a structure built in the early 1970s. The building is home to the Commanding General, United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea.

Facilities include multiple family housing areas, a large commissary and Post Exchange, Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation facilities, restaurants, indoor and outdoor sports complexes, a library, a bowling alley, a skateboard park, a miniature golf complex, a hospital, a dental clinic, three Department of Defense Dependent Schools, a United Service Organization (USO), child development centers, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, an automotive care center, and a self-service gas station. The garrison is also home to the Dragon Hill Lodge, a hotel which is operated as an Armed Forces Recreation Center by the U.S. Army in support of personnel assigned or employed by the U.S. Forces Korea, their family members, and guests.

The garrison consists of two main parts: Main Post (North Post) and South Post, which are physically divided by Itaewon-ro, a four-lane city boulevard. In 2003, a two-lane overpass bridge was constructed over this boulevard to solve traffic congestion.

The garrison provides installation support for K-16 Air Base, Camp Kim, Sungnam Golf Course, and Camp Coiner. Camp Coiner, covering approximately 50 acres (200,000 m2) on Yongsan Garrison&#x27;s northern edge, is named after 2nd Lt. Randall Coiner, a Korean War Silver Star recipient. Until 2014, it also supported an outlying U.S. Army housing area called Hannam Village in Hannam-dong; that site was sold in 2016 to private developers and, as of 2018, redevelopment as luxury housing was underway. After the Korean War it served as Korea&#x27;s primary in-processing facility for Army troops. (As of 2008, the 1st Replacement Company (1RC), a part of the Yongsan Readiness Center, serves as the central in-processing and orientation center for U.S. servicemembers and their families arriving to Korea.) There was an Officers&#x27; Club, NCO Club and Enlisted Club in the camp.

Collier Field House serves as the garrison&#x27;s primary fitness center. Named in honor of Corporal John Collier, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his service during the Korean War, this sports complex is on Yongsan South Post and features basketball, racquetball, volleyball, baseball, softball, aerobic, and weight training facilities. It offers authorized patrons instructor-lead fitness training programs. The Collier Field House is used for community events and town hall meetings.

The single family suburban style housing areas, with yards and tree lined streets, plus the small wooded areas throughout the Garrison stand in stark contrast to the highly urbanized areas surrounding the facility.

The War Memorial of Korea directly abuts the garrison. Before the construction of this museum, the land was part of the Korean military command and was only slightly separated from the U.S. Army facility, both having been part of the original Japanese Garrison. Outside the garrison, east of the compound is the commercial district of Itaewon, with westernized shopping and nightlife. To the west of Yongsan is the Samgakji subway station and Yongsan Electronics Market.
Although access to the garrison is controlled at the gates, it was possible for larger-than-normal drops of North Korean propaganda (leaflets and CDs) to occur at Yongsan Garrison, as recently as 22 December 2017. US troops were cautioned not to handle the materials themselves but to report them to Eighth Army G2X (counterintelligence).

===Administration===

Yongsan Garrison is commanded by a U.S. Army colonel and is one of four U.S. Army Installation Management Command Pacific Region(IMCOM-P) garrisons in the Republic of Korea, and one of 179 such garrisons worldwide.

IMCOM-P is a military organization primarily to provide the United States Army in Korea the installation capabilities and services to support operations, and to provide a quality of life for soldiers and their families. IMCOM-P is the Korean regional office of the Installation Management Command headquartered in Hawaii.

===Army Family Covenant===
In December 2007 Yongsan Garrison officials and the IMCOM-Korean commanding general pledged their support to develop and improve family programs during an Army Family Covenant signing ceremony. According to garrison officials, &quot;The Army Family Covenant is our commitment to deliver a quality of life commensurate to our Soldiers&#x27; service.&quot; During the ceremony, the Yongsan Garrison commander cited recent improvements to family programs at the USAG-Yongsan, such as elimination of initial registration fees for child care, extended hours for respite care and extended-duty child care, and expanded programs for teens and after-school care, including youth sports. The Army committed $1.4 billion to family programs in fiscal 2008.

===Army Family Housing===
The garrison&#x27;s primary housing areas include Loring Village, Lloyd L. Burke Towers, Watkins Ridge and Krzyzowski Hills. Commonly known as Black Hawk Housing Area, Loring Village consists of 16 housing structures, each containing multiple housing units, and was named after U.S. Air Force Major Charles Loring, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his service during the Korean War. In 2004, South Korean-funded construction of the Lloyd L. Burke Towers (commonly known as Burke Towers) was completed . Consisting of two five-story towers, the housing area includes three-, four- and five bedroom units, as well as outdoor barbecue areas, a basketball court and underground parking facility. The towers were named after Army 1st Lt. Lloyd L. Burke, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his service during the Korean War. Watkins Ridge housing area consists of 23 housing structures, each containing multiple housing units, and was named after Army Master Sergeant Travis Watkins, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his service during the Korean War. Krzyzowski Hills housing area consists of 10 housing structures, with multiple housing units each and named after Army Captain Edward Krzyzowski, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his service during the Korean War.
Unaccompanied military personnel are assigned to Unaccompanied Personnel Housing on-post such as barracks, Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQ), Senior Enlisted Quarters (SEQ), or Bachelor Officer Quarters (BOQ). When on-post housing is not available, unaccompanied military personnel are assigned to off-post quarters.

===Army Community of Excellence===
In 2008, Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Richard A. Cody recognized Yongsan Garrison as one of the top three U.S. Army Installations in the World and recognized the garrison by declaring it an Army Community of Excellence. The ACOE competition recognizes excellence in installation management and encourages and rewards installations that optimize opportunities and demonstrate a commitment to service and excellence.

===Brian Allgood Army Community Hospital===
Yongsan Garrison was home to the Brian Allgood Army Community Hospital (BAACH). The main tenant unit residing in BAACH was the 121st Combat Support Hospital, providing the staff for inpatient and outpatient care. The staff included a mix of active duty soldiers, civilians employees, and Korean employees. It was originally activated in 1944 as the 121st Evacuation Hospital, Semimobile. It participated in the European Theater during World War II and in the Korean War. It has served continuously in Korea as a field unit since 25 September 1950 and as fixed medical treatment facility, Seoul Military Hospital, since 1959. In 1971, Seoul Military Hospital merged with the 121st Evacuation Hospital to become the U.S. Army Hospital, Seoul (121st Evacuation Hospital). On 16 April 1994, the 121st Evacuation Hospital reorganized and was redesignated the 121st General Hospital. On 30 June 2008 the facility was formally renamed the Brian D. Allgood Army Community Hospital. Colonel Allgood served as the commander at this hospital from June 2004 through June 2006. Allgood&#x27;s final assignment was July 2006 when he was posted as the Command Surgeon Multi-National Forces-Iraq (MNF-I). On 20 January 2007, he, along with 11 other U.S. service members, were killed in action when their UH-60 helicopter was shot down by enemy rocket fire in Iraq. In September 2019, BAACH completed its relocation from Yongsan to Camp Humphreys.

===Department of Defense Dependent Schools===
Seoul American High School (SAHS) is on Yongsan Garrison. The school complex comprises eight buildings, containing over 60 classrooms and special purpose rooms. The school has two combination faculty lounges and work areas. A library/media center houses 12,000 books and audio visual materials. The educator staff of 70 is composed of the Department of Defense Dependent Schools education specialists and classroom teachers. SAHS opened in 1959 with approximately 150 students. The first class graduated in 1960. The classrooms at that time were Quonset huts located across from the main Army Community Service building. Taegu, Pusan, and Chinhae students boarded at SAHS as there were no high schools in those areas until 1967. In the fall of 1967, Taegu opened its high school, which alleviated the long drive for students. Construction began on the new high school in 1981 and was completed in the fall of 1982. In addition to the main, arts, and gymnasium buildings a new structure which includes a JROTC section was opened in 1987. The JROTC facilities have two classrooms, three offices, supply room, arms room, four-point indoor rifle range, and a hard top area used for inspections and drills. Additionally, JROTC formal inspections are held on the Falcon Fields, the school&#x27;s full-sized artificial turf football and soccer field. School year, 1995–96 Seoul American High School had 550 students. This year enrollment is 630. SAHS is one of the larger schools in DoDDS Pacific and has a reputation for being one of the leading academic schools. Every year SAHS ranks in the top 15% of high schools academics. Over the summer of 2009, SAHS Football/soccer field recently had &quot;stadium lights&quot; placed along the side of the fields, which can be easily seen when driving by the field, fulfilling their part in the &quot;American Dream&quot;. The tennis court was also taken out and replaced with a new building due to an influx of students from the states.

Seoul American Middle School (SAMS) and Seoul American Elementary School (SAES) are on Yongsan Garrison. In 2008, to accommodate an increase in student population, a classroom building was constructed on the SAMS campus. The new building&#x27;s six classrooms – each – accommodate up to about 170 Department of Defense Dependent Schools students. The SAES campus consists of seven buildings and a cafeteria. The main building houses primary classrooms, the Information Center, the Dolphin Theater, and computer labs. Grades 3, 4 and 5 and some Kindergarten classrooms are located in outlying buildings. SAES is one of the largest schools in DoDDS and ranked as one of the highest in academic performance. There are about 1,100 students at Seoul American Elementary School. The staff consists of over 90 professional educators, 20 educational aides and 10 clerical personnel. The school&#x27;s curriculum is based on the U.S. national standards with special classes including art, music, physical education, computer and Korean culture.

==Environmental problems==
Since 2004, the metropolitan government has tried to clean up high levels of benzene and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in areas adjacent to the Yongsan base, such as Noksapyeong Station.

==Camp Kim==

Camp Kim is adjacent to Yongsan Garrison and home to a USO facility, an Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) distribution and storage facility, an AAFES vehicle repair facility, the Special Operations Command Korea, and the garrison office for vehicle registration and decals.

The USO facility consists of a canteen, tour and ticket office, the Virtues Development Program, the Good Neighbor Program, a big screen television lounge. The Virtues Development Program and the Good Neighbor Program are Community Outreach Programs designed to promote cross-cultural understanding through English education for Korean school-age children.
==Legacy==

As countless USFK personnel as well as Korean civilians have lived and worked on post, Yongsan Garrison has had far-reaching influence on Korea&#x27;s society and development. Historians have been rushing to archive Yongsan&#x27;s history, tracing its influence in areas including music, art, cuisine, medicine, engineering and so on, for the Yongsan Legacy project so it won&#x27;t be forgotten after physical traces have disappeared.

<doc id="336239" wikidata="Q561509" url="?curid=336239" title="Tatamkhulu Afrika">
<text>Ismail Joubert (7 December 1920 – 23 December 2002), commonly known as Tatamkhulu Afrika, which is Xhosa for &quot;Grandfather Africa&quot;, was a South African poet and writer. His first novel, &quot;Broken Earth&quot; was published when he was seventeen (under his &quot;Methodist name&quot;), but it was over fifty years until his next publication, a collection of verse entitled &quot;Nine Lives&quot;.

He won numerous literary awards including the gold Molteno Award for lifetime services to South African literature, and in 1996, his works were translated into French. His autobiography, &quot;Mr Chameleon&quot;, was published posthumously in 2005.

==Biography==
Tatamkhulu Afrika was born Mogamed Fu&#x27;ad Nasif in Egypt to an Egyptian father and a Turkish mother, and came to South Africa as a very young child. Both his parents died of flu, and he was fostered by family friends under the name John Carlton.

He fought in World War II in the North African campaign and was captured at Tobruk. His experiences as a prisoner of war featured prominently in his writing. After World War II he left his foster family and went to Namibia (then South-West Africa), where he was fostered by an Afrikaans family, taking his third legal name of Jozua Joubert.

In 1964, he converted to Islam, legally changed his name to Ismail Joubert, and spent some time in prison. It was here that he first experienced forms of homosexual sex being employed in a state context to intimidate political prisoners, which would go on to become a major theme of his later literary work, as tensions between homophobia and homoeroticism feature largely.

He lived in Cape Town&#x27;s District 6, a mixed race inner-city community. District 6 was declared a &quot;whites only&quot; area in the 1960s and the community was destroyed. With an Egyptian father and a Turkish mother, Afrika could have been classified as a &quot;white&quot;, but refused as a matter of principle. He founded Al-Jihaad to oppose the destruction of District Six and apartheid in general, and when this became affiliated with the African National Congress&#x27; armed wing, Umkhonto We Sizwe, he was given the praise name of Tatamkhulu Afrika, which he adopted until he died.

In 1987, he was arrested for terrorism and banned from speaking or writing in public for five years, although he continued writing under the name of Tatamkhulu Afrika. He was imprisoned in the same prison as Nelson Mandela and was released in 1992.

Tatamkulu Afrika died on 23 December 2002 shortly after his 82nd birthday, from injuries received when he was run over by a motorist two weeks before, just after the publication of his final novel, &quot;Bitter Eden&quot;. He left a number of unpublished works, including his autobiography, two novels, four short novels, two plays and poetry.

<text>Mendele Mocher Sforim (, ; lit. &quot;Mendele the book peddler&quot;; January 2, 1836, Kapyl – December 8, 1917 [N.S.], Odessa), born Sholem Yankev Abramovich (, ) or S. J. Abramowitch, was a Jewish author and one of the founders of modern Yiddish and Hebrew literature. His name was variously transliterated as Moykher, Sfarim, Seforim, etc.

==Youth==
Mendele was born to a poor Lithuanian Jewish family in Kapyl, Minsk Governorate, Russian Empire. His father, Chaim Moyshe Broyde, died shortly after Mendele&#x27;s bar mitzvah. He studied in yeshiva in Slutsk and Vilna until he was 17; during this time he was a day-boarder under the system of &quot;Teg-essen&quot;, barely scraping by, and often hungry.

Mendele traveled extensively around Belarus, Ukraine and Lithuania at the mercy of an abusive beggar named Avreml Khromoy (Russian for &quot;Avreml the Lame&quot;); Avreml would later become the source for the title character of &quot;Fishke der Krumer&quot; (Fishke the Lame). In 1854, Mendele settled in Kamianets-Podilskyi, where he got to know writer and poet Avrom Ber Gotlober, who helped him to understand secular culture, philosophy, literature, history, Russian and other languages.

==Early work==
Mendele&#x27;s first article, &quot;Letter on Education&quot;, appeared in 1857, in the first Hebrew newspaper, &quot;Hamagid&quot;; his mentor Gotlober submitted Mendele&#x27;s school paper without Mendele&#x27;s prior knowledge. In Berdichev, where he lived from 1858 to 1869, he began to publish fiction both in Hebrew and Yiddish. Having offended the local powers with his satire, he left Berdichev to train as a rabbi at the relatively theologically liberal, government-sponsored rabbinical school in Zhitomir, where he lived from 1869 to 1881, and became the head of the traditional school (Talmud Torah) in Odessa in 1881. He lived in Odessa until his death in 1917, except for two years spent in Geneva, where he fled the government-inspired pogroms following the failed revolution of 1905.

==Grandfather of Yiddish literature==
Mendele initially wrote in Hebrew, coining many words in that language, but ultimately switched to Yiddish in order to expand his audience. Like Sholem Aleichem, he used a pseudonym because of the contemporary perception of Yiddish as a ghetto vernacular unsuitable for serious literary work — an idea he did much to dispel. His writing strongly bore the mark of the Haskalah. He is considered by many to be the &quot;grandfather of Yiddish literature&quot;, an epithet first accorded to him by Sholem Aleichem, in the dedication to his novel &quot;&quot;. Mendele&#x27;s style in both Hebrew and Yiddish has strongly influenced several generations of later writers.

While the tradition of journalism in Yiddish had a bit more of a history than in Hebrew, &quot;Kol Mevasser&quot;, which he supported from the outset and where he published his first Yiddish story, , in 1863, is generally seen as the first stable and important Yiddish newspaper.

==Ideology and later work==
Sol Liptzin writes that in his early Yiddish narratives, Mendele &quot;wanted to be useful to his people rather than gain literary laurels&quot;. Two of his early works, the story and the unstaged 1869 drama (The Tax), condemned the corruption by which religious taxes (in the latter case, specifically the tax on kosher meat) were diverted to benefit community leaders rather than the poor. This satiric tendency continued in (The Nag, 1873) about a prince, a stand-in for the Jewish people, who is bewitched and becomes a much put-upon beast of burden, but maintains his moral superiority throughout his sufferings (a theme evidently influenced by Apuleius&#x27;s classical picaresque novel &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;).

His later work became more humane and less satiric, starting with (&quot;Fishke the Lame&quot;; written 1868-1888) – which was adapted as a film of the same title in 1939 (known in English as &quot;The Light Ahead&quot;) – and continuing with the unfinished The Travels of Benjamin III (, 1878), something of a Jewish &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. (The title is a reference to the well-known travel book of the Medieval Spanish-Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela.) In 1938, this work was adapted by as a play for the Jüdischer Kulturbund in Germany, and performed there shortly after Kristallnacht (the Night of Broken Glass), in November of that year.

As with &quot;Fishke&quot;, Mendele worked on and off for decades on his long novel (The Wishing Ring, 1865–1889), with at least two versions preceding the final one. It is the story of a &quot;maskil&quot; — that is, a supporter of the &quot;Haskalah&quot;, like Mendele himself — who escapes a poor town, survives misery to obtain a secular education much like Mendele&#x27;s own, but is driven by the pogroms of the 1880s from his dreams of universal brotherhood to one of Jewish nationalism. The first English translation, by Michael Wex (author of &quot;Born to Kvetch&quot;), was published in 2003.

<doc id="336243" wikidata="Q477632" url="?curid=336243" title="Pericopes of Henry II">
<text>The Pericopes of Henry II (; Munich, Bavarian State Library, Clm 4452) is a luxurious medieval illuminated manuscript made for Henry II, the last Ottonian Holy Roman Emperor, made 1002–1012 AD. The manuscript, which is lavishly illuminated, is a product of the Liuthar circle of illuminators, who were working in the Benedictine Abbey of Reichenau, which housed a scriptorium and artists&#x27; workshop that has a claim to having been the largest and artistically most influential in Europe during the late 10th and early 11th centuries. An unrivalled series of liturgical manuscripts was produced at Reichenau under the highest patronage of Ottonian society. (Other centers include scriptoria at Lorsch, Trier, and Regensburg.)

Unlike a gospel book, gospel pericopes contain only the passages from the gospels which are to be read during the liturgical year, making it easier for the priest celebrating Mass to find the gospel reading. It is 425 mm by 320 mm and has 206 vellum folios.

==Style of the miniatures==
The style of the &quot;Liuthar group&quot;, unlike other schools in Ottonian art, departs further from rather than returning to classical traditions; it &quot;carried transcendentalism to an extreme&quot;, with &quot;marked schematization of the forms and colours&quot;, &quot;flattened form, conceptualized draperies and expansive gesture&quot;. Backgrounds are often composed of bands of colour with a symbolic rather than naturalistic rationale, the size of figures reflects their importance, and in them &quot;emphasis is not so much on movement as in gesture and glance&quot;, with narrative scenes &quot;presented as a quasi-liturgical act, dialogues of divinity&quot;. The group was produced perhaps from the 990s to 1015 or later, and major manuscripts include the Munich Gospels of Otto III, the Bamberg Apocalypse, and a volume of biblical commentary there, and the Pericopes of Henry II, the best known and most extreme of the group, where &quot;the figure-style has become more monumental, more rarified and sublime, at the same time thin in density, insubstantial, mere silhouettes of colour against a shimmering void&quot;. The group introduced the background of solid gold to Western illumination.

== Cover ==
A number of ivory plaques depicting the Crucifixion were created during the Carolingian period. One such ivory plaque was set in a border for the book cover of the “Pericopes of Henry II”. The plaque measures 11 by 5 inches and was made in Germany around the year 870, but was inserted into the cover of “Pericopes of Henry II” in the eleventh century. It serves as an example of how older objects were transformed and incorporated into later Carolingian designs. Ancient Roman personifications set the scene and designate the time despite the Christian content. The plaque is one of several crucifixion-themed works which are often assigned to Charles&#x27; Court School in Metz, but there is not an identified artist. Around 1014, a frame was made for the plaque to rest in. It is made out of enamels, gold, pearls, and gems showing the book cover’s high value.

In the upper section, above the arms of the cross, there are traditional personifications of the sun, moon, and God&#x27;s hand motioning from a cloud bank. Three angels are stationed over the head of Christ. Under the arms of the cross, Ecclesia is seen with her chalice and standard, Longinus and Stephaton on either side of Christ, a group of grieving women, John, and ambiguous figures to the right. A dead snake is wrapped around the base of the cross and below the crucifixion is a representation of the Marys at the tomb. A representation of the dead arising from their graves is visible below, separated by a projection that resembles a shelf. Oceanus and Terra are also shown on the plaque&#x27;s lower edge on either side of a seated woman. The figures depicted closely resemble those in the Utrecht Psalter with their rippling, shape-defining clothing, protruding heads, and aggressive motions. The Four Evangelists are represented in the corners of the frame and Christ and the Twelve Apostles are seen along the border, with Christ in the center along the top edge. The details shown in the plaque and frame indeed give a sense of Christianity and the Carolingian age, which helped to influence the style and ways of interpreting these stories in other art pieces.

<text>The Drogo Sacramentary (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, MS lat. 9428) is a Carolingian illuminated manuscript on vellum from 850 AD, one of the monuments of Carolingian book illumination. It is a sacramentary, a book containing all the prayers spoken by the officiating priest during the course of the year. In the Sacramentary, Christ is depicted as the central figure, holding the staff of Jacob as he accepts God’s hand and begins his ascension into the clouds, from which God&#x27;s hand appears.

The sacramentary was written and painted for the personal use of Charlemagne&#x27;s son Drogo, the Bishop of Metz. Metz was an important bishopric: Charles the Bald was crowned in the Basilica, and Louis the Pious and his illegitimate half-brother Drogo the Bishop are buried there. In 843 Metz became the capital of the kingdom of Lotharingia, and several diets and councils were held there.

Drogo&#x27;s position enabled him to be one of the great patrons of 9th-century arts. He embellished his cathedral in Metz with works which rank among the highlights of Carolingian art in beauty and preciousness. Among them are three surviving manuscripts from the court school, of which the Drogo Sacramentary is the most mature and most accomplished.

This sacramentary is not the product of a monastic scriptorium but reveals an origin in a court school. It contains only those liturgical sections that the bishop spoke. Paintings all around it, showing the beauty and uniqueness. retaining its original scene and meaning to the public. An example of the individual character of its iconography is the initial O for Palm Sunday prayers, which contains a Crucifixion of a new iconographic type, one that would be called &quot;christus patiens&quot; rather than the triumphant Christ on the cross (&quot;christus triumphans&quot;) that had been the norm. In the image, the dead and tortured body of Christ spouts water and blood, which are collected by a female figure recognizable as Ecclesia, the Church, in a chalice, that would become entangled with the Holy Grail legend in the future. The Serpent entwines the base of the cross and figures representing the Sun and Moon witness the event from above. The manuscript&#x27;s style, too, is considered to show the patron&#x27;s influence, in an unusually unified work of a small group of artists working in close cooperation.

It is 264 mm by 214 mm and has 130 folios. It is lavishly illuminated. Art historian Sonia Chalif Simon focused on the Drogo &quot;Sacramentary&quot; for her doctoral dissertation, &quot;Studies on the &quot;Drogo&quot; Sacrementary: Eschatology and the Priest-King&quot; (1975, Boston University).

<doc id="336249" wikidata="Q42129" url="?curid=336249" title="Osan">
<text>Osan (; ) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, approximately south of Seoul. The population of the city is around 200,000. The local economy is supported by a mix of agricultural and industrial enterprises.

It is famous for one of the largest markets in South Korea, Osan Market, which has been in continuous operation since 1792. The city was the scene of the first battle between the US and North Korea during the Korean War in 1950; there is a statue and museum dedicated to UN forces on the outskirts of the city.

The United States Air Force base named after the city, Osan Air Base, is not actually located in the city, but is instead south, in the Songtan district (formerly a separate city) of Pyeongtaek.

Osan Station is a large subway station located in the heart of Osan. It is part of the Seoul Subway Line 1 and the KTX. There is a bus terminal next to the subway station and many buses stop in front of the subway station.

==Name==
Osan came to be called by its current name in 1914, at the time of a general reorganization of local governments under Japanese rule. At that time it became Osan-myeon, part of Suwon. This name in turn was taken from that of a local stream, the Osancheon. However, prior to the Japanese occupation, the name had been rendered in hanja as 鰲山, meaning &quot;soft-shelled turtle mountain.&quot; Because of the complexity of the 鰲 (&quot;o&quot;) character, and because crows were abundant in the area, the Japanese changed the name to 烏山, meaning &quot;crow mountain school.&quot;

==Administrative districts==
The administrative districts of Osan consists of six administrative districts and 24 legal districts. Osan has a population of 228,111 and 97,348 households as of the end of June 2020.
==Climate==
Osan has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm.
==Sister cities==
* Hidaka, Saitama, Japan 
* Ürümqi, Xinjiang, China
* Killeen, Texas, U.S.
* Miami, Florida, U.S.
* Qazvin, Iran

==Economy==
Kyochon, a fried chicken chain, has its head office in Osan.

<doc id="336251" wikidata="Q689450" url="?curid=336251" title="Treaty establishing the European Defence Community">
<text>The Treaty establishing the European Defence Community, also known as the Treaty of Paris, is an unratified treaty signed on 27 May 1952 by the six &#x27;inner&#x27; countries of European integration: Belgium, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and West Germany. The treaty would have created a European Defence Community (EDC), with a unified defence force acting as an autonomous European pillar within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The ratification process was completed in the Benelux countries and West Germany, but stranded after the treaty was rejected in the French National Assembly. Instead, the London and Paris Conferences provided for West Germany&#x27;s accession to NATO and the Western European Union (WEU), the latter of which was a transformed version of the pre-existing Western Union. The historian Odd Arne Westad calls the plan &quot;far too complex to work in practice&quot;.

The treaty was initiated by the Pleven plan, proposed in 1950 by then French Prime Minister René Pleven in response to the American call for the rearmament of West Germany. The formation of a pan-European defence architecture, as an alternative to West Germany&#x27;s proposed accession to NATO, was meant to harness the German military potential in case of conflict with the Soviet bloc. Just as the Schuman Plan was designed to end the risk of Germany having the economic power on its own to make war again, the Pleven Plan and EDC were meant to prevent the military possibility of Germany&#x27;s making war again.

==Planned organisation==
The European Defence Community would have entailed a pan-European military, divided into national components, and had a common budget, common arms, centralized military procurement, and institutions.

Diagram showing the functioning of the institutions provided for by the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community (EDC), the placing of the European Defence Forces at the disposal of the Community, and the link between the EDC and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO, with reference to this organisation&#x27;s Supreme Allied Commander Europe and Council):

The main contributions to the proposed 43-division force:
*France: 14 divisions, 750 planes
*West Germany: 12 divisions*
*Italy: 12 divisions, 450 planes
*Benelux: 5 divisions, 600 planes

*West Germany would have had an air force, but a clause in the EDC treaty would have forbidden it to build war-planes, atomic weapons, guided missiles and battleships.

===Reporting===
In this military, the French, Italian, Belgian, Dutch, and Luxembourgish components would report to their national governments, whereas the West German component would report to the EDC. This was due to the fear of a return of German militarism, so it was desired that the West German government would not have control over its military. However, in the event of its rejection, it was agreed to let the West German government control its own military in any case (something which the treaty would not have provided).

===Defence arm of a &quot;European Political Community&quot;===

A European Political Community (EPC) was proposed in 1952 as a combination of the existing European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the proposed European Defence Community (EDC). A draft EPC treaty, as drawn up by the ECSC assembly (now the European Parliament), would have seen a directly elected assembly (&quot;the Peoples’ Chamber&quot;), a senate appointed by national parliaments and a supranational executive accountable to the parliament.

The European Political Community project failed in 1954 when it became clear that the European Defence Community would not be ratified by the French national assembly, which feared that the project entailed an unacceptable loss of national sovereignty. As a result, the European Political Community idea had to be abandoned.

Following the collapse of the EPC, European leaders met in the Messina Conference in 1955 and established the Spaak Committee which would pave the way for the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC).

== History ==
===Background===
During the late 1940s, the divisions created by the Cold War were becoming evident. The United States looked with suspicion at the growing power of the USSR and European states felt vulnerable, fearing a possible Soviet occupation. In this climate of mistrust and suspicion, the United States considered the rearmament of West Germany as a possible solution to enhance the security of Europe and of the whole Western bloc.

In August 1950, Winston Churchill proposed the creation of a common European army, including German soldiers, in front of the Council of Europe:
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe subsequently adopted the resolution put forward by the United Kingdom and officially endorsed the idea:
In September 1950, Dean Acheson, under a cable submitted by High Commissioner John J. McCloy, proposed a new plan to the European states; the American plan, called &quot;package,&quot; sought to enhance NATO&#x27;s defense structure, creating 12 West German divisions. However, after the destruction that Germany had caused during World War II, European countries, in particular France, were not ready to see the reconstruction of the German military. Finding themselves in the midst of the two superpowers, they looked at this situation as a possibility to enhance the process of integrating Europe, trying to obviate the loss of military influence caused by the new bipolar order and thus supported a common army.

===Launch of the Pleven Plan===

On 24 October 1950, France&#x27;s Prime Minister René Pleven proposed a new plan, which took his name although it was drafted mainly by Jean Monnet, that aimed to create a supranational European army. With this project, France tried to satisfy America&#x27;s demands, avoiding, at the same time, the creation of German divisions, and thus the rearmament of Germany.

The EDC was to include West Germany, France, Italy, and the Benelux countries. The United States would be excluded. It was a competitor to NATO (in which the US played the dominant role), with France playing the dominant role. Just as the Schuman Plan was designed to end the risk of Germany having the economic power to make war again, the Pleven Plan and EDC were meant to prevent the same possibility. Britain approved of the plan in principle, but agreed to join only if the supranational element was decreased.

According to the Pleven Plan, the European Army was supposed to be composed of military units from the member states, and directed by a council of the member states’ ministers. Although with some doubts and hesitation, the United States and the six members of the ECSC approved the Pleven Plan in principle.

===Negotiations===
The initial approval of the Pleven Plan led the way to the Paris Conference, launched in February 1951, where it was negotiated the structure of the supranational army.

France feared the loss of national sovereignty in security and defense, and thus a truly supranational European Army could not be tolerated by Paris. However, because of the strong American interest in a West German army, a draft agreement for a modified Pleven Plan, renamed the European Defense Community (EDC), was ready in May 1952, with French support.

===Signing===
Among compromises and differences, on 27 May 1952 the six foreign ministers signed the Treaty of Paris establishing the European Defence Community (EDC).

===Ratification===
All signatories except France and Italy ratified the treaty. The Italian parliament aborted its ratification process due to France&#x27;s failed ratification.

====French rejection====
The EDC went for ratification in the French National Assembly on 30 August 1954, and failed by a vote of 319 against 264.

By the time of the vote, concerns about a future conflict faded with the death of Joseph Stalin and the end of the Korean War. Concomitant to these fears were a severe disjuncture between the original Pleven Plan of 1950 and the one defeated in 1954. Divergences included military integration at the division rather than battalion level and a change in the command structure putting NATO&#x27;s Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) in charge of EDC operational capabilities. The reasons that led to the failed ratification of the Treaty were twofold, concerning major changes in the international scene, as well as domestic problems of the French Fourth Republic. There were Gaullist fears that the EDC threatened France&#x27;s national sovereignty, constitutional concerns about the indivisibility of the French Republic, and fears about West Germany&#x27;s remilitarization. French Communists opposed a plan tying France to the capitalist United States and setting it in opposition to the Communist bloc. Other legislators worried about the absence of the United Kingdom.

The Prime Minister, Pierre Mendès-France, tried to placate the treaty&#x27;s detractors by attempting to ratify additional protocols with the other signatory states. These included the sole integration of covering forces, or in other words, those deployed within West Germany, as well as the implementation of greater national autonomy in regard to budgetary and other administrative questions. Despite the central role for France, the EDC plan collapsed when it failed to obtain ratification in the French Parliament.

===Aftermath===
The treaty never went into effect. Instead, after the failed ratification in the French National Assembly, West Germany was admitted into NATO and the EEC member states tried to create foreign policy cooperation in the De Gaulle-sponsored Fouchet Plan (1959–1962). European foreign policy was finally established during the third attempt with European Political Cooperation (EPC) (1970). This became the predecessor of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).

Today the European Union and NATO, and formerly also the Western European Union, all carry out some of the functions which was envisaged for the EDC, although none approach the degree of supranational military control that the EDC would have provided for.

<text>A de Sitter universe is a cosmological solution to the Einstein field equations of general relativity, named after Willem de Sitter. It models the universe as spatially flat and neglects ordinary matter, so the dynamics of the universe are dominated by the cosmological constant, thought to correspond to dark energy in our universe or the inflaton field in the early universe. According to the models of inflation and current observations of the accelerating universe, the concordance models of physical cosmology are converging on a consistent model where our universe was best described as a de Sitter universe at about a time after the fiducial Big Bang singularity, and far into the future.

== Mathematical expression ==

A de Sitter universe has no ordinary matter content but with a positive cosmological constant (formula_1) that sets the expansion rate, formula_2. A larger cosmological constant leads to a larger expansion rate:
: formula_3
where the constants of proportionality depend on conventions.
It is common to describe a patch of this solution as an expanding universe of the FLRW form where the scale factor is given by
: formula_4
where the constant formula_2 is the Hubble expansion rate and formula_6 is time. As in all FLRW spaces, formula_7, the scale factor, describes the expansion of physical spatial distances.

Unique to universes described by the FLRW metric, a de Sitter universe has a Hubble Law that is not only consistent through all space, but also through all time (since the deceleration parameter is formula_8), thus satisfying the perfect cosmological principle that assumes isotropy and homogeneity throughout space and time. There are ways to cast de Sitter space with static coordinates (see de Sitter space), so unlike other FLRW models, de Sitter space can be thought of as a static solution to Einstein&#x27;s equations even though the geodesics followed by observers necessarily diverge as expected from the expansion of physical spatial dimensions. As a model for the universe, de Sitter&#x27;s solution was not considered viable for the observed universe until models for inflation and dark energy were developed. Before then, it was assumed that the Big Bang implied only an acceptance of the weaker cosmological principle, which holds that isotropy and homogeneity apply spatially but not temporally.

== Relative expansion ==

The exponential expansion of the scale factor means that the physical distance between any two non-accelerating observers will eventually be growing faster than the speed of light. At this point those two observers will no longer be able to make contact. Therefore, any observer in a de Sitter universe would have cosmological horizons beyond which that observer can never see nor learn any information. If our universe is approaching a de Sitter universe then eventually we will not be able to observe any galaxies other than our own Milky Way (and any others in the gravitationally bound Local Group, assuming they were to somehow survive to that time without merging).

== Role in the Benchmark Model ==
The Benchmark Model is a model consisting of a universe made of three components – radiation, ordinary matter, and dark energy – that fit current data about the history of the universe. These components make different contributions to the expansion of the universe as time elapses. Specifically, when the universe is radiation dominated, the expansion factor scales as formula_9, and when the universe is matter dominated formula_10. Since both of these grow slower than the exponential, in the future the scale factor will be dominated by the exponential factor formula_11 representing the pure de Sitter universe. The point at which this starts to occur is known as the matter–lambda equivalence point and the modern-day universe is believed to be relatively close to this point.

<doc id="336256" wikidata="Q43281" url="?curid=336256" title="Kerrang!">
<text>Kerrang! is a British music webzine and quarterly magazine that primarily covers rock, punk and heavy metal music. Since 2017, the magazine has been published by Wasted Talent Ltd (the same company that owns electronic music publication &quot;Mixmag&quot;). The magazine was named onomatopoeically after the sound of a &quot;guitar being struck with force&quot;.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; was first published on 6 June 1981 as a one-off &quot;Heavy Metal Special&quot; from the now-defunct &quot;Sounds&quot; newspaper. Due to the popularity of the issue, the magazine became a monthly publication, before transitioning into a weekly in 1987. Initially devoted to the new wave of British heavy metal and the rise of hard rock acts, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; musical emphasis has changed several times, focusing on grunge, nu metal, post-hardcore, emo and other alternative rock and metal genres over the course of its forty-year publication history. In 2001, it became the best-selling British music weekly, overtaking &quot;NME&quot;.

After publishing a total of 1,818 issues, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ceased publication of their weekly magazine in March 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, whilst continuing as an online publication featuring digital &quot;cover stories&quot;. In December 2021, the print edition of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; was revived, and is now published on a quarterly basis.

==History==

=== 1980s ===
&quot;Kerrang!&quot; was founded in 1981. The editor of the weekly music magazine &quot;Sounds&quot;, Alan Lewis, suggested that Geoff Barton edit a one-off special edition focusing on the new wave of British heavy metal phenomenon and on the rise of other hard rock acts. Billed as a &quot;&quot;Sounds&quot; Heavy Metal Special&quot;, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; first issue was published on 6 June 1981. Angus Young of AC/DC appeared on &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s first cover. According to Alan Lewis, the first issue reportedly sold out within days of its publication, and the magazine began being published on a monthly basis. In February 1982, after only eight issues, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; frequency was doubled by its publisher, Spotlight Publications (owned by United Newspapers). Starting with issue 148 in 1987, the publication went weekly. During the 1980s and early 1990s the magazine placed many thrash metal and glam metal acts on the cover, including Tigertailz, Mötley Crüe, Slayer, Bon Jovi, Metallica, Poison, and Venom. The term thrash metal was first coined in the music press by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; journalist Malcolm Dome, in reference to the Anthrax song &quot;Metal Thrashing Mad&quot;. Prior to this Metallica&#x27;s James Hetfield had referred to their sound as &quot;power metal&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
In April 1991, Spotlight/United Newspapers sold &quot;Kerrang!&quot; to EMAP Metro (now known as Ascential plc). Although &quot;Kerrang!&quot; had an average weekly circulation of 58,685 by this point and was making profits of £1 million a year, the publication had been faced with significant competition from &quot;RAW&quot; magazine, also owned by EMAP. British journalist David Hepworth, who launched a number of titles for EMAP in the 1980s, said: &quot;We [EMAP] had made it nearly impossible for Spotlight to publish &quot;Kerrang!&quot; profitably because we promoted &quot;RAW&quot; and they had to promote back, and that ate into their margins.&quot; EMAP moved &quot;Kerrang!&quot; offices to Carnaby Street in London&#x27;s West End.

In April 1992, Barton left his post as the magazine&#x27;s editor, and was replaced by Robyn Doreian. Although her tenure as editor was brief, Doreian would balance the magazine&#x27;s focus between heavy metal and the growing alternative music scene, following the unexpected success of grunge acts such as Nirvana. Phil Alexander became the new editor of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in June 1993. Alexander felt that the magazine was lagging behind &quot;RAW&quot; in terms of its coverage of newer bands, and &quot;Kerrang!&quot; emphasis began to largely eschew previously featured glam/metal acts in favour of modern acts, such as Hole, Nine Inch Nails, Kyuss, Corrosion of Conformity and Machine Head. During the Britpop era, the magazine would largely focus on heavier &quot;Britrock&quot; acts such as The Wildhearts, Manic Street Preachers, Terrorvision and Therapy?. Starting in 1995, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; began covering the nu metal genre after one of the magazine&#x27;s journalists, Mörat, was introduced to Korn by Machine Head frontman Robb Flynn. During the late 1990s, the magazine would end up covering the likes of Limp Bizkit, System of a Down, Deftones and Slipknot, and various other punk rock, hip-hop and hardcore acts.

=== 2000s – 2020s ===
In April 2000, Paul Rees became the new editor for &quot;Kerrang!.&quot; In 2001, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; overtook &quot;NME&quot; as the biggest selling music weekly in the United Kingdom, bolstered by its coverage of nu metal. By mid-2002, the magazine had a circulation of 83,988 copies per week. After Rees left them to edit &quot;Q&quot; magazine, former &quot;Kerrang!&quot; reviews editor Ashley Bird appointed editor from 2003 to 2005. Following his departure, Paul Brannigan took over as editor in May 2005. In the mid-to-late 2000s, the genre focus of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; shifted once more, with a new emphasis on emo, post-hardcore, pop-punk and metalcore music, coinciding with the decline of nu metal. Furthermore, the magazine continued to occasionally feature more established bands such as Iron Maiden and Metallica on the cover. In 2006, the magazine&#x27;s circulation stood at 80,186 copies.

In 2008, EMAP sold its consumer magazines to Bauer Media Group. Brannigan left &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 2009 and Nichola Browne was appointed editor. She later stepped down in April 2011. Former &quot;NME&quot; features editor and &quot;GamesMaster&quot; deputy editor James McMahon was appointed as editor on 6 June 2011.

In April 2017, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine, its website, and the &quot;K!&quot; Awards were purchased by Mixmag Media, publisher of dance monthly &quot;Mixmag&quot;, along with assets related to defunct style magazine &quot;The Face&quot;. Mixmag has since formed parent company Wasted Talent, which relaunched &quot;Kerrang!&quot; as a digital-first title, while continuing to publish a weekly print edition. Former Editor-in-Chief Phil Alexander was appointed Global Creative Director on 3 August 2017. Bauer retained ownership of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Radio and the Box Plus Network will continue to operate Kerrang! TV as before. An updated &quot;Kerrang!&quot; logo was debuted in mid-2017 before the magazine received a complete redesign during 2018.

On 13 March 2020, after publishing a total of 1,818 issues, publication of the weekly print edition of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The &quot;Kerrang!&quot; website continued to run articles as normal. On 29 July 2020, the magazine debuted its first weekly digital &#x27;cover story&#x27; long-form article, announcing Corey Taylor&#x27;s first solo album &quot;CMFT&quot; (2020). In December 2021, a one-off print edition of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; was published, celebrating the return of live music events in the UK. Sales of this magazine proved successful enough that a second stand-alone print magazine was published in April 2022. The magazine continues to be published on a quarterly basis.

===International editions===
Emap launched &quot;Kerrang! Australia&quot; in the late 1990s. Unlike its weekly counterpart in the UK, the Australian edition was published monthly due to stiff competition from free local music publications. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; is also published in Spanish and German. Kerrang announced its aim to expand into the US in March 2018.

In March 2018, following a magazine redesign, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; announced it would be expanding to the United States, with an office in New York run by Ethan Fixell. The goal would be to generate US-centric content, events, and brand partnerships.

==Website==
&quot;Kerrang!&quot;&#x27;s website, www.kerrang.com, was launched in summer 2001 by Dan Silver. &quot;Kerrang!&quot;&#x27;s parent company Emap acquired the domain name from a Norwegian cybersquatter by the name of Steingram Stegane for a token sum of £666.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot;&#x27;s website features news and features on both contemporary and classic rock bands, as well as previewing upcoming events. The website hosts &quot;Kerrang!&quot;&#x27;s online shop, podcasts, message board, TV and radio segments ensuring more opportunities to sell associated merchandise and products. In 2001, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; launched its own online forum with the &quot;rants and raves&quot; section taking up most of the traffic. According to Alexa www.kerrang.com is ranked 83,545th globally, and 33,532nd in the U.S.

== Other ventures ==

=== Kerrang! Awards ===

Since 1993, the magazine has held an annual awards ceremony to mark the most successful bands in the interests of their readers. The awards became one of Britain&#x27;s most recognised events by the now defunct &quot;Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;, often listing some of the winners in their annual round-up of the previous year. The event is presented by major music celebrities, with many others outside the industry who attend the event.

After a year hiatus, the Awards were relaunched in 2018, with notable guests that included Johnny Depp, Joe Perry, Tony Iommi, Corey Taylor, and Dave Grohl, among others. After a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ceremony returned in June 2022, with the reader nominations period beginning in April 2022.

=== Kerrang! Radio ===

In 2000, EMAP launched &quot;Kerrang!&quot; as a DAB radio station, across the United Kingdom. This was principally a &#x27;jukebox&#x27; station, playing a back-to-back sequence of rock and alternative music. On 10 June 2004, Kerrang! 105.2 was launched as a regional radio station in Birmingham with an advertising campaign by London-based creative agency ODD. The radio had a number of specialist programmes dedicated to the many subgenres of rock music. The radio output included interviews with those affecting popular culture and society as well as those involved with music. It stopped broadcasting on FM as of 14 June 2013 and once again became a digital station, with listeners able to tune in on DAB or the Kerrang! Radio app. With this broadcasting change came a move in Kerrang! Radio&#x27;s offices from Birmingham to London. Absolute Radio is now broadcasting on its FM frequency.

=== Kerrang! TV ===

In 2001, EMAP launched Kerrang! TV. As with the radio station, the television channel covers the more mainstream side of the rock music as well as classic rock bands including Aerosmith, AC/DC and Guns N&#x27; Roses and classic heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath and Metallica. Kerrang! TV, along with its The Box Plus Network sister channels, was fully owned by Channel Four Television Corporation and subsequently closed due to budget cuts made by Channel 4, along with its sister channels, on 30th June 2024.

=== Kerrang! compilation albums ===

From 1982 the Kerrang! Magazine would occasionally be bundled with compilations, originally on 7&quot; vinyl then moving to cassettes in 1994 and CDs in 1995. The compilations featured new and popular music, music themed around a particular genre, band or theme and best-of lists. In 2001, Kerrang began releasing Kerrang! the Album under Universal Music. From 2016, the albums were released via Rhino Records.

=== Kerrang! Tour ===
The Kerrang! Tour ran from 2006 to 2017. The line-up for each year was usually announced in October of the previous year and was held throughout January and February of the following year. Relentless Energy Drink sponsored the Kerrang! Tour for several years. It is currently unknown if the tour will ever be revived.

*2006, featured Bullet for My Valentine, Hawthorne Heights, Still Remains and Aiden.
*2007, featured Biffy Clyro, The Bronx, The Audition and I Am Ghost.
*2008, featured Coheed and Cambria, Madina Lake, Fightstar and Circa Survive.
*2009, sponsored by Relentless Energy Drink from this year; featured Mindless Self Indulgence, Dir En Grey, Bring Me the Horizon, Black Tide and In Case of Fire.
*2010, featured All Time Low, The Blackout, Young Guns and My Passion. Jettblack were added for two dates at the London Roundhouse at the end of the tour.
*2011, featured Good Charlotte, Four Year Strong, Framing Hanley and The Wonder Years.
*2012. The tour lasted from 5 to 17 February.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012 NFG/SUM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It featured New Found Glory, Sum 41, letlive. and While She Sleeps. On 20 January 2012 it was revealed that Sum 41 had been forced to pull out due to frontman Deryck Whibley who had suffered a back injury and was not well enough to perform for the duration of the tour, they were replaced by The Blackout who had previously played on the 2010 tour.
*2013, featured Black Veil Brides, Chiodos, Tonight Alive and Fearless Vampire Killers. It was an 11-date tour which ran from 3–15 February, with the 6th and 11th being days off. William Control was a guest DJ and also appeared alongside Black Veil Brides on 2 songs; Shadows Die and In the End.
*2014, featured Limp Bizkit, Crossfaith, Nekrogoblikon and Baby Godzilla.
*2015, featured Don Broco, We Are the in Crowd, Bury Tomorrow, Beartooth and Young Guns.
*2016. On 29 September the headliner for the eleventh Kerrang! tour was revealed to be Sum 41. In an interview with Kerrang, frontman Deryck Whibley stated that &quot;After a three-year break, we&#x27;re honoured that our first tour back is the Kerrang!&quot; The tour featured Sum 41, Roam, Frank Carter &amp; The Rattlesnakes and Biters.
*2017, featured The Amity Affliction, Boston Manor, Vukovi, and Casey.

=== The K! Pit ===
The year after the final &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Tour, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; launched a new gig concept known as &quot;The K! Pit&quot;, where the magazine promotes a free gig for a popular band in a tiny London venue. Fans gain access by applying for tickets online and being randomly selected in a competition-style draw. Artists featured so far include Parkway Drive, Mastodon, Fever 333, and Neck Deep, the latter performance coinciding with the 2018 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Awards where Neck Deep would win Best Song. The brand has since also launched the series in Brooklyn, New York, featuring artists such as Sum 41, Baroness, Knocked Loose, Daughters, and Fit For An Autopsy. Performances are streamed on the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Facebook page before being uploaded to YouTube.

==The Official Kerrang!rock chart==
During the 1980s, Kerrang! published weekly heavy metal charts for singles, albums and import albums. Each was compiled from sales data from fifty specialist stores across the United Kingdom.

In March 2012, Kerrang! announced a new weekly rock singles chart for the UK based on upon airplay across Kerrang Radio, Kerrang TV, and specialist rock radio stations, as well as sales figures from the Official Charts Company. As of 2020, the chart continues to be printed in the magazine every week, contains 20 tracks, and often features accompanying facts or artist quotes. The official Kerrang Spotify profile also features a playlist of the tracks on the chart and is updated every Wednesday. The chart was announced on Saturday mornings on Kerrang! Radio and could be viewed online every Saturday at midday. The chart would also be shown on Kerrang! TV on Thursdays at 4 pm.

Unlike the UK Rock &amp; Metal Singles Chart produced by the Official Charts Company, which is typically dominated by classic rock artists, the Kerrang! Rock Chart focuses primarily on new releases by contemporary rock artists.

<text>The Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38 when assigned to Third Fleet, TF 58 when assigned to Fifth Fleet) was a group of ships in World War II. It was the main striking force of the United States Navy in the Pacific War from January 1944 through the end of the war in September 1945. The task force was made up of several separate task groups, each typically built around three to four aircraft carriers and their supporting vessels. The support vessels were screening destroyers, cruisers, and the newly built fast battleships.

== Carrier-based naval warfare ==
With the arrival of the fleet carriers the primary striking power of the navy was no longer in its battleship force, but with the aircraft that could be brought to battle by the carriers. The means by which the US Navy operated these carriers was developed principally by Admiral Marc Mitscher. Mitscher determined that the best defense for a carrier was its own air groups, and that carriers were more easily defended if they operated together in groups, with supporting ships along with them to aid in air defense, anti-submarine defense, and rescue of downed airmen.

Said Mitscher: &quot;The ideal composition of a fast-carrier task force is four carriers, six to eight support vessels and not less than 18 destroyers, preferably 24. More than four carriers in a task group cannot be advantageously used due to the amount of air room required. Less than four carriers requires an uneconomical use of support ships and screening vessels.&quot;

The ships of each task group sailed in a circle formation centered on the carriers. The supporting ships sailed relatively close by, and added their anti-aircraft fire to that of the carriers to help ward off attacking aircraft. When under attack by torpedo aircraft, the task group would turn toward the oncoming aircraft to limit attack angles. Other than this measure, the carriers in the task group would not take evasive action from their attackers. This was in marked contrast with the Imperial Japanese Navy, but the choice made for more stable platforms for the anti-aircraft fire of all the ships in the task group and allowed the ships in the group to sail more closely together. The primary defense of the group against air attack was the group&#x27;s own fighter cover.

== Admirals ==

The individual primarily responsible for the development and operations of the task force was Admiral Mitscher. The overall command of the task force alternated between two very different admirals: Raymond Spruance and William &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey. Spruance was calculating and cautious, while Halsey was more aggressive and known for taking risks. Most higher-ranking officers preferred to serve under Spruance; most common sailors were proud to serve under Halsey. Their commander was Admiral Chester Nimitz, who was responsible for all Pacific Ocean assets.

When the force was part of Admiral Spruance&#x27;s Fifth Fleet, the carrier task force was commanded by Mitscher and bore the designation Task Force (TF) 58. When led by Admiral Halsey as part of the Third Fleet, the carrier force was commanded by Vice Admiral John S. McCain Sr. and its designation was Task Force (TF) 38. Planning for upcoming operations was completed when each admiral and his staff rotated out of active command. This allowed the Navy to perform at a higher operational tempo, while giving the Japanese the general impression of naval assets greater than what were actually available.

== World War II ==
The Fast Carrier Task Force took part in all the US Navy&#x27;s battles in the Pacific during the last two years of the war. The task groups could operate independently or combine with the others as needs dictated. Raids against island strong points such as Iwo Jima or Chichi Jima might be undertaken by one or two task groups, but when a major operation was underway the task force would concentrate all four groups together. Each group would remain distinct but operate in close proximity to the other groups to provide the task force with maximum protection and maximum striking power.

The Fast Carrier Task Force worked in conjunction with the other two major components of the Pacific Fleet: the Amphibious Force, which was much larger overall and which carried and provided direct support to the Marine forces, and the Service Squadrons of hundreds of support vessels which resupplied and maintained the fleet. The fleet and task group designation changed when the command of the fleet changed hands. When under the umbrella of Fifth Fleet, the invasion force was called the Fifth Amphibious Force. When Halsey had command of the fleet, Third Amphibious Force was the designation. By the time of the Battle of Iwo Jima in early 1945, the Task Force included eighteen aircraft carriers, eight battleships and two &quot;Alaska&quot;-class large cruisers, along with numerous cruisers and destroyers. TF 58 alone commanded more firepower than any navy in history.

The original TF 38 came into existence in August 1943, built around , and under the command of Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman. TF 58 was created on 6 January 1944 with Rear Admiral Marc Mitscher commanding, serving under the fleet command of Admiral Spruance in the Fifth Fleet. TF 38 continued to exist, but as a command structure only. TF 58 proved the success of the Fast Carrier TF concept with Operation Hailstone, a massive naval air squadrons and surface vessels attack on the Japanese ships and airfield at Truk Lagoon on 17–18 February 1944.

The only time that any aircraft carriers were used to support operations in New Guinea in the Southwest Pacific theater was during the double landings at Hollandia and Aitape in April 1944, hundreds of miles behind Japanese enemy lines and far beyond the range of short-ranged P-40 fighters of the Allied Air Forces. TF 58 and escort carriers in Task Force 78 supported the landings. TF 58 only stayed for four days but contributed much crucial air support to one of the greatest successes in the Pacific War.

With command change from Spruance to Halsey on 26 August 1944, all units changed designations again. Mitscher, who was an aviator from early training and had a masterful command of the airgroups, requested that he retain command of the Fast Carrier Task Force until his replacement, Admiral John McCain, could have proper time to become more familiar with the handling of a carrier task force. King and Nimitz concurred. Admiral Halsey, like Spruance before him, sailed with the Fast Carrier Task Force. The force grew to nine CVs and eight CVLs in preparation for the landings on Leyte. Task Force 38 was composed of four task groups: Task Group 38.1 was commanded by Admiral McCain, with its previous commander, Admiral Joseph &quot;Jocko&quot; Clark, remaining on as advisor, Task Group 38.2 was under the command of Admiral Gerald Bogan, Task Group 38.3 was led by Admiral Frederick Sherman, and Task Group 38.4 was under the command of Admiral Ralph Davison.

Following the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Mitscher went on shore leave and planning duty, and Vice Admiral McCain took over as commanding officer of TF 38, which continued under Halsey and the Third Fleet. In January 1945 TF 38 raided the South China Sea and attacked Japanese positions in Formosa and Luzon.

On 26 January 1945, Halsey and McCain went on shore leave and planning duty, while Spruance and Mitscher returned to their previous commands. Third Fleet became Fifth Fleet, and TF 38 became TF 58. They led the fleet through the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, facing sustained attacks from land-based Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft. As the Okinawa campaign dragged into its second month, the presence of the carriers was still required to provide close air support to the soldiers on the island as the Army and its Air Corps were not as adept as the Marine Corps at quickly establishing airfields over newly occupied territory. At the end of April, Admiral Nimitz came out to review the situation. After two months operating off the coast of Okinawa in support of Army forces engaged in battle on the island, the command staff was exhausted from the continuous pressure of fending off &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. On his return to Pearl Harbor, he notified Halsey that he would have to take over command from Spruance in thirty days, whether or not the mission was completed.

Nimitz&#x27; assessment of the exhaustion and psychological toll on Spruance and Mitscher and their staff due to the &quot;kamikazes&quot; proved to be justified. The &quot;kamikazes&quot; were so relentless at Okinawa that Spruance&#x27;s flagships were struck two separate times (the heavy cruiser was hit on 31 March and had to retire for repairs which forced him to transfer to the battleship which was also hit on 12 May). On 11 May, Mitscher and his chief of staff Commodore Arleigh Burke were merely yards away from getting killed or wounded by &quot;kamikazes&quot; on his flagship, , which killed three of Mitscher&#x27;s staff officers and eleven of his enlisted staff members and also destroyed his flag cabin along with all of his uniforms, personal papers, and possessions. Just three days later Mitscher&#x27;s new flagship, , was also struck by a &quot;kamikaze&quot;, forcing him to have to change his flagship yet again.

On 28 May 1945, Halsey arrived aboard , his new flagship, whereupon he relieved Spruance, while McCain relieved Mitscher. Spruance and Mitscher returned to Pearl Harbor. Fifth Fleet once again became Third Fleet, and Task Force 58 became Task Force 38. Halsey remained in command until the Japanese surrender ended the war on 2 September 1945.

<doc id="336261" wikidata="Q5259384" url="?curid=336261" title="Dent v. West Virginia">
<text>Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114 (1889), was an important United States Supreme Court case involving the reputable practice of physicians and state laws in the late 19th century. It was a direct challenge to West Virginia having passed &quot;the nation&#x27;s first genuinely restrictive physician licensing law in the early 1880s.&quot;

==The Case==
Frank Dent was a physician who practiced with his father and grandfather in Newburg, West Virginia. Frank had only apprenticed with his father and practiced for six years when West Virginia passed its Board of Health Act in 1881 requiring either a diploma from a reputable medical college, a certificate showing ten years&#x27; practice, or successful passing of a state-administered exam. In 1882 Dent submitted a diploma from the American Eclectic Medical College in Cincinnati, which the Board of Health determined to be a fraudulent eclectic institution. Dent continued practicing and the Board&#x27;s President, James Reeves, had Dent arrested. Frank Dent turned to his cousin Marmaduke H. Dent, Grafton West Virginia attorney and the first graduate of the University of West Virginia for his defense. At his trial in 1883 Frank Dent was found guilty of practicing without a medical license. Marmaduke Dent appealed the decision to the West Virginia Supreme Court on the grounds that the state could not interfere with a citizen&#x27;s right to practice a lawful trade.

The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals heard Dent&#x27;s case in 1884 and rejected Marmaduke&#x27;s arguments. M.H. Dent then filed an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1885 claiming a violation of his cousin&#x27;s rights under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court had a considerable backlog and did not hear the case until 1889.

==The Decision==

Justice Stephen J. Field delivered the Court&#x27;s unanimous opinion on January 14, 1889, which upheld the West Virginia statute. Field noted that each citizen had a right to follow any lawful calling, subject to natural restraints such as age, sex, etc., as well as state restrictions, as long as those state restrictions were reasonable. In addition, the Court ruled that medicine, because of the careful nature of its training, the large knowledge of the human body required of doctors, and the nature of life-and-death circumstances with which doctors dealt, reliance needed to be placed on the assurance of a license. Certain circumstances might prompt states to exclude people without licenses from practicing medicine.

==Aftermath==
Later, the Court would extend its decision in the case &quot;Hawker v. New York&quot;, 170 U.S. 189 (1898) when it ruled that character was also an important qualification for doctors wishing to obtain a license. As in any Supreme Court case, &quot;Dent&quot; has been cited numerous times, particularly in defining the legitimate role of state regulation versus Constitutional prohibitions on Bills of Attainder. See, for example &quot;SBC Communications, Inc. v. FCC&quot;.

<doc id="336267" wikidata="Q7871841" url="?curid=336267" title="USS Minnesota (1855)">
<text>USS &quot;Minnesota&quot; was a wooden steam frigate in the United States Navy. Launched in 1855 and commissioned eighteen months later, the ship served in east Asia for two years before being decommissioned. She was recommissioned at the outbreak of the American Civil War and returned to service as the flagship of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.

During the first day of the Battle of Hampton Roads on 8 March 1862, &quot;Minnesota&quot; ran aground, and the following battle badly damaged her and inflicted many casualties. On the second day of the battle, engaged CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, allowing tugs to free &quot;Minnesota&quot; on the morning of 10 March. &quot;Minnesota&quot; was repaired and returned to duty, and three years later she participated in the Second Battle of Fort Fisher. &quot;Minnesota&quot; served until 1898, when she was stricken, beached and burnt to recover her metal fittings and to clear her name for a newly-ordered battleship, .

== Construction and early duties ==
&quot;Minnesota&quot; was laid down in May 1854 by the Washington Navy Yard on the East Branch of the Potomac River (Anacostia River) in southeast Washington, D.C. She was named and launched on 1 December 1855, sponsored by Susan L. Mann, and commissioned into the lists of the United States Navy on 21 May 1857 with Captain Samuel Francis DuPont in command.

&quot;Minnesota&quot; was named for the Minnesota River, tributary to the upper Mississippi River. Her sister ships were also named for American rivers: the (first in class), , (salvaged 1861-62 and renamed &quot;C.S.S. Virginia&quot; by the Confederate States Navy), and the (later converted to a monitor-type ironclad warship).

&quot;Minnesota&quot;, carrying William B. Reed, appointed U.S. Minister to the Empire of China, departed from Norfolk, Virginia, on 1 July 1857 for the continent of East Asia. During her service with the East India Squadron, she visited many of the principal ports of China and Japan before departing Hong Kong to bring Minister Reed home with a newly-negotiated commerce treaty, the Treaty of Tianjin, with the Manchu dynasty of the Chinese Empire. Upon arrival in Boston, Massachusetts, on 2 June 1859, &quot;Minnesota&quot; was decommissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on the Charles River in Charlestown, Massachusetts, (across from Boston) the same day and remained in ordinary (holding status) there until the outbreak of the American Civil War two years later in April 1861.

== American Civil War ==
&quot;Minnesota&quot; was recommissioned on 2 May 1861, Captain G. J. Van Brunt in command, and became flagship of the Atlantic Blockading Squadron, commanded by Flag Officer Silas Stringham. She arrived at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 13 May and the next day captured the schooners &quot;Mary Willis&quot;, &quot;Delaware Farmer&quot;, and &quot;Emily Ann&quot;. &quot;Minnesota&quot; took the bark &quot;Winfred&quot; on the 25th and the bark &quot;Sally McGee&quot; on 26 June. Schooner &quot;Sally Mears&quot; became her prize 1 July and bark &quot;Mary Warick&quot; struck her colors to the steam frigate on the 10th.
&quot;Minnesota&quot; led a joint Army-Navy expedition, known as the Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries, against two important Confederate forts which had been erected at Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina. The squadron opened fire on Fort Clark on the morning of 28 August 1861, forcing the Confederate gunners to abandon the fort at noon. The following day, the fire of the squadron was concentrated on Fort Hatteras. The bombardment was so effective the Confederates were compelled to seek cover in bomb shelters and surrendered.

When Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough relieved Stringham in command of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron on 23 September, he selected &quot;Minnesota&quot; as his flagship. William B. Cushing, later to distinguish himself for sinking the Confederate ironclad CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot;, was assigned as a junior officer to the &quot;Minnesota.&quot;

=== Battle of Hampton Roads ===
While blockading off Hampton Roads, 8 March 1862, &quot;Minnesota&quot; sighted three Confederate warships, &quot;Jamestown&quot;, &quot;Patrick Henry&quot;, and led by the unique revolutionary appearance of the &quot;CSS Virginia&quot;—the former &quot;USS Merrimack&quot;, (the 1855 steam-powered heavy frigate, rebuilt since burnt/scuttled in 1861 and now protected by riveted iron plates) — rounding Sewell&#x27;s Point from Norfolk and the Elizabeth River, and heading north across the Hampton Roads harbor to the northern peninsula toward Newport News, Virginia. &quot;Minnesota&quot; slipped her cables and got underway to engage the Southern warships in a fight that would come to be known as the Battle of Hampton Roads. When about 1.5 miles off-shore from Newport News, the &quot;Minnesota&quot; grounded.

Meanwhile, &quot;CSS Virginia&quot; passed the federal frigate and rammed and sank sailing frigate . &quot;Virginia&quot; then engaged &quot;Congress&quot; compelling her to surrender and setting her afire. Then the rebel iron warship &quot;Virginia&quot;, along with &quot;Jamestown&quot;, and &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; bombarded the stranded &quot;Minnesota&quot; killing and wounding several of her crew before the Union Navy warship&#x27;s heavy guns drove them off. &quot;Minnesota&quot; also fired upon &quot;Virginia&quot; with her pivot gun. Toward twilight the Southern ironclad withdrew southward back across the harbor toward Norfolk and the Elizabeth River.

The recoil from her broadside guns forced &quot;Minnesota&quot; further upon the mud bank. All night, steam tug boats worked to pull and haul her off the bottom, but to no avail. However, during the night arrived from its southward trip down the East Coast from New York City. &quot;All on board felt we had a friend that would stand by us in our hour of trial,&quot; wrote Captain Gershom Jacques Van Brunt (1798-1863), the stranded and damaged &quot;Minnesota&quot; vessel&#x27;s commander, in his official report to the Navy Department, the day after the engagement in Hampton Roads. Early the next morning, the &quot;CSS Virginia&quot; reappeared. As the range closed, the now guarding little &quot;Monitor&quot;, steaming between &quot;Minnesota&quot; and the iron-clad Southern attacker, fired gun after gun from her revolving turret, and the &quot;Virginia&quot; returned fire with whole broadsides from her numerous cannon on both of her sides, but neither with much apparent effect on the other. &quot;Virginia&quot;, finding she could not hurt &quot;Monitor&quot;, then turned her attention to the grounded &quot;Minnesota&quot;, who answered with all remaining guns. &quot;Virginia&quot; fired from her rifled bow gun a shell which passed through the wooden Union warship&#x27;s chief engineer&#x27;s stateroom, through the engineers&#x27; mess room, amidships, and burst in the boatswain&#x27;s room, exploding two charges of powder there, starting a fire onboard the vulnerable wooden frigate which was promptly extinguished.

At midday &quot;Virginia&quot; withdrew southwards back toward Norfolk, and the Union Navy tugs resumed its efforts to refloat &quot;Minnesota&quot;. Early the next morning, the 1859 side-paddlewheel steamship &quot;S. R. Spaulding&quot; (on duty as a hospital ship with the Hospital Transport Service of the United States Sanitary Commission) joined the several tugs and managed to pull free and refloat the heavy frigate, and she sailed east and anchored under the protecting guns opposite Fortress Monroe (still Union-occupied) at Old Point Comfort for temporary repairs.

Seven African-American sailors of the Union Navy manned the forward gun of the federal vessel. This black crew mustered in earlier at Boston, Massachusetts, and included William Brown, Charles Johnson, George Moore, George H. Roberts, George Sales, William H. White and Henry Williams.

During the two-day engagement, the &quot;Minnesota&quot; shot off 78 rounds of 10-inch solid shot; 67 rounds of 10-inch solid shot with 15-second fuse; 169 rounds of 9-inch solid shot; 180 9-inch shells with 15-second fuse; 35 8-inch shells with 15-second fuse and expended 5,567.5 pounds of service gunpowder.

=== Battles of Fort Fisher (Wilmington, North Carolina) ===
For the next few years she served as flagship of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron for the Union Navy / United States Navy. During the Battle of Suffolk at Norfleet House on 14 April 1863, four of the &quot;Minnesota&quot;″s sailors, Coxswains Robert Jordan and Robert B. Wood and Seamen Henry Thielberg and Samuel Woods, earned the famous congressional Medal of Honor while temporarily assigned to the accompanying . While anchored off Newport News on 9 April 1864, the &quot;Minnesota&quot; was attacked by the Confederate States naval torpedo boat &quot;Squib&quot;, which exploded a torpedo charge alongside the federal warship, fortunately without causing substantial damage and escaped.

On 24 and 25 December 1864, &quot;Minnesota&quot; took part in the joint Union Navy and Army amphibious operations at the Confederate bastion of Fort Fisher which guarded Wilmington, North Carolina (the First Battle of Fort Fisher) upstream on the Cape Fear River, the last major open seaport of the South to the outside world. During the landings she took a position about a mile downstream from the fort and laid down a devastating artillery barrage on the Confederate stronghold. However, Union General Benjamin F. Butler (1818-1893), withdrew his troops, nullifying the previous gains won by the joint Army-Navy effort. 

Three weeks later in January 13-15, 1865, the Union Navy returned with more Federal Army troops, now commanded by the much more vigorous and aggressive General Alfred Terry (1827-1890), to Fort Fisher for a second effort (the Second Battle of Fort Fisher). A landing force of 240 men from &quot;Minnesota&quot;, covered by a cannonade barrage from their own ship, participated in the successful assault. This operation finally after four years of effort closed outside access to the city and port of Wilmington, denying the collapsing southern Confederacy the use of this very last open invaluable major seaport, just three months before the end of the war in the East.

During the Second Battle of Fort Fisher of January 1865, nine sailors and Marines from the &quot;Minnesota&quot; earned the congressional Medal of Honor as part of the landing party which assaulted the fort. The nine men were:
* Landsman Gurdon H. Barter
* Seaman David L. Bass
* Ordinary Seaman Thomas Connor
* Ordinary Seaman Thomas Harcourt
* Seaman Charles Mills
* Corporal John Rannahan
* Private John Shivers
* Private Henry A. Thompson
* Ordinary Seaman Franklin L. Wilcox

== Later service ==

Ordered back north to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine / Portsmouth, New Hampshire, &quot;Minnesota&quot; was then decommissioned and stricken from the lists of the U.S. Navy on 16 February 1865. She was recommissioned however two years later on 3 June 1867 and made a cruise with midshipmen across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. She was subsequently placed in ordinary (holding status) at the New York Navy Yard on 13 January 1868. Recommissioned again after eight years on 12 June 1875, she remained at the New York Navy Yard as a gunnery and training ship for naval seamen apprentices.

In 1881 she was transferred to Newport, Rhode Island where she served as the flagship of the U.S. Navy Training Squadron. From 1881 to 1884 she was commanded by Captain Stephen Luce (1827-1917), who founded the Naval War College there at the end of his command tenure in 1884. The warship took part in dedication ceremonies for the famous Brooklyn Bridge across the East River (between the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn) in New York City on 24 May 1883.

Three sailors assigned to &quot;Minnesota&quot; were awarded the Medal of Honor during this period: Captain of the Top William Lowell Hill and Ship&#x27;s Cook Adam Weissel for rescuing fellow sailors from drowning in separate 1881 incidents, and Second Class Boy John Lucy for his actions during a fire at the Castle Garden immigration facility in 1876.

In October 1895, &quot;Minnesota&quot; was loaned to the Massachusetts Naval Militia, continuing that duty for six years until August 1901 when she was sold by the government to the Thomas Butler &amp; Company of Boston. She eventually was stripped and burned to salvage her iron fittings at nearby Eastport, Maine.

<text>An approximation is anything that is intentionally similar but not exactly equal to something else.

==Etymology and usage==
The word &quot;approximation&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;approximatus&quot;, from &quot;proximus&quot; meaning &quot;very near&quot; and the prefix &quot;ad-&quot; (&quot;ad-&quot; before &quot;p&quot; becomes ap- by assimilation) meaning &quot;to&quot;. Words like &quot;approximate&quot;, &quot;approximately&quot; and &quot;approximation&quot; are used especially in technical or scientific contexts. In everyday English, words such as &quot;roughly&quot; or &quot;around&quot; are used with a similar meaning. It is often found abbreviated as &quot;approx.&quot;

The term can be applied to various properties (e.g., value, quantity, image, description) that are nearly, but not exactly correct; similar, but not exactly the same (e.g., the approximate time was 10 o&#x27;clock).
Although approximation is most often applied to numbers, it is also frequently applied to such things as mathematical functions, shapes, and physical laws.

In science, approximation can refer to using a simpler process or model when the correct model is difficult to use. An approximate model is used to make calculations easier. Approximations might also be used if incomplete information prevents use of exact representations.

The type of approximation used depends on the available information, the degree of accuracy required, the sensitivity of the problem to this data, and the savings (usually in time and effort) that can be achieved by approximation.

== Mathematics ==
Approximation theory is a branch of mathematics, and a quantitative part of functional analysis. Diophantine approximation deals with approximations of real numbers by rational numbers.

Approximation usually occurs when an exact form or an exact numerical number is unknown or difficult to obtain. However some known form may exist and may be able to represent the real form so that no significant deviation can be found. For example, 1.5 × 106 means that the true value of something being measured is 1,500,000 to the nearest hundred thousand (so the actual value is somewhere between 1,450,000 and 1,550,000); this is in contrast to the notation 1.500 × 106, which means that the true value is 1,500,000 to the nearest thousand (implying that the true value is somewhere between 1,499,500 and 1,500,500).

Numerical approximations sometimes result from using a small number of significant digits. Calculations are likely to involve rounding errors and other approximation errors. Log tables, slide rules and calculators produce approximate answers to all but the simplest calculations. The results of computer calculations are normally an approximation expressed in a limited number of significant digits, although they can be programmed to produce more precise results. Approximation can occur when a decimal number cannot be expressed in a finite number of binary digits.

Related to approximation of functions is the asymptotic value of a function, i.e. the value as one or more of a function&#x27;s parameters becomes arbitrarily large. For example, the sum is asymptotically equal to &quot;k&quot;. No consistent notation is used throughout mathematics and some texts use ≈ to mean approximately equal and ~ to mean asymptotically equal whereas other texts use the symbols the other way around.

===Typography ===
The approximately equals sign, ≈, was introduced by British mathematician Alfred Greenhill in 1892, in his book &quot;Applications of Elliptic Functions&quot;.
====LaTeX symbols====
Symbols used in LaTeX markup.
* formula_1 (codice_1), usually to indicate approximation between numbers, like formula_2.
* formula_3 (codice_2), usually to indicate that numbers are not approximately equal (formula_4).
* formula_5 (codice_3), usually to indicate asymptotic equivalence between functions, like formula_6. 
** So writing formula_7 would be wrong under this definition, despite wide use.
* formula_8 (codice_4), usually to indicate proportionality between functions, the same formula_9 of the line above will be formula_10.
* formula_11 (codice_5), usually to indicate congruence between figures, like formula_12.
* formula_13 (codice_6), usually to indicate that two quantities are equal up to constants.
* formula_14 (codice_7) and formula_15 (codice_8), usually to indicate that either the inequality holds or the two values are approximately equal.

====Unicode====
Symbols used to denote items that are approximately equal are wavy or dotted equals signs.
== Science ==
Approximation arises naturally in scientific experiments. The predictions of a scientific theory can differ from actual measurements. This can be because there are factors in the real situation that are not included in the theory. For example, simple calculations may not include the effect of air resistance. Under these circumstances, the theory is an approximation to reality. Differences may also arise because of limitations in the measuring technique. In this case, the measurement is an approximation to the actual value.

The history of science shows that earlier theories and laws can be &quot;approximations&quot; to some deeper set of laws. Under the correspondence principle, a new scientific theory should reproduce the results of older, well-established, theories in those domains where the old theories work. The old theory becomes an approximation to the new theory.

Some problems in physics are too complex to solve by direct analysis, or progress could be limited by available analytical tools. Thus, even when the exact representation is known, an approximation may yield a sufficiently accurate solution while reducing the complexity of the problem significantly. Physicists often approximate the shape of the Earth as a sphere even though more accurate representations are possible, because many physical characteristics (e.g., gravity) are much easier to calculate for a sphere than for other shapes.

Approximation is also used to analyze the motion of several planets orbiting a star. This is extremely difficult due to the complex interactions of the planets&#x27; gravitational effects on each other. An approximate solution is effected by performing iterations. In the first iteration, the planets&#x27; gravitational interactions are ignored, and the star is assumed to be fixed. If a more precise solution is desired, another iteration is then performed, using the positions and motions of the planets as identified in the first iteration, but adding a first-order gravity interaction from each planet on the others. This process may be repeated until a satisfactorily precise solution is obtained.

The use of perturbations to correct for the errors can yield more accurate solutions. Simulations of the motions of the planets and the star also yields more accurate solutions.

The most common versions of philosophy of science accept that empirical measurements are always &quot;approximations&quot; — they do not perfectly represent what is being measured.

==Law==
Within the European Union (EU), &quot;approximation&quot; refers to a process through which EU legislation is implemented and incorporated within Member States&#x27; national laws, despite variations in the existing legal framework in each country. Approximation is required as part of the pre-accession process for new member states, and as a continuing process when required by an EU Directive. &quot;Approximation&quot; is a key word generally employed within the title of a directive, for example the Trade Marks Directive of 16 December 2015 serves &quot;to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks&quot;. The European Commission describes approximation of law as &quot;a unique obligation of membership in the European Union&quot;.

<text>Jean Omer Marie Gabriel Monnet (; 9 November 1888 – 16 March 1979) was a French civil servant, entrepreneur, diplomat, financier, and administrator. An influential supporter of European unity, he is considered one of the founding fathers of the European Union.

Jean Monnet has been called &quot;The Father of Europe&quot; by those who see his innovative and pioneering efforts in the 1950s as the key to establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, the predecessor of today&#x27;s European Union. Although Monnet was never elected to public office, he worked behind the scenes of American and European governments as a well-connected &quot;pragmatic internationalist&quot;.

For three decades, Jean Monnet and Charles de Gaulle had a multifaceted relationship, at some times cooperative and at other times distrustful, from a first encounter in London during the Battle of France in mid-June 1940 until De Gaulle&#x27;s death in November 1970. Monnet and De Gaulle have been referred to together as &quot;probably the two most outstanding Frenchmen of the 20th century&quot;.

Jean Monnet was the first-ever individual to be designated as an Honorary Citizen of Europe in 1976. On the hundredth anniversary of his birth in 1988, his native country of France honoured Monnet&#x27;s memory by transferring his mortal remains to the Panthéon in Paris.

==Early years==

Monnet was born in Cognac, a commune in the department of Charente in France, into a family of cognac merchants. According to Jacques-René Rabier, the values of laicism and republicanism, as well as a strong Catholic tradition, co-existed in Monnet&#x27;s family. His father, Jacques-Gabriel Monnet, had taken control of a mid-sized distiller and distributor of cognac and had it renamed in 1901 as . His mother, née Marie Demelle, was deeply religious; his sister Marie-Louise was a founder of the French branch of Action Catholique, to which Monnet contributed financially. She would later introduce her brother to Pope Paul VI.

Monnet did not complete the qualification and instead travelled to the United Kingdom, where he lived in London learning business with Mr Chaplin, an agent of J.-G. Monnet. Subsequently, he travelled widely – to Canada, the United States, Scandinavia and Russia, for the family business, as well as Egypt for health reasons.

==World War I==
Monnet firmly believed that the only path to an Allied victory lay in combining the war efforts of Britain and France, and he reflected on a concept that would coordinate war resources. In 1914, a friend of the family, Fernand Benon, arranged for young Monnet to meet French Premier René Viviani in Bordeaux to talk about this issue; Monnet managed to convince the French government to agree with him, in principle.

However, during the first two years of the war, Monnet did not have much success pressing for a better organization of the allied economic cooperation. It was not until two years later that stronger combined efforts like the Wheat Executive (end of 1916) and the Allied Maritime Transport Council (end of 1917) were set into motion, adding to the overall war effort.

==Interwar period==

At the Paris Peace Conference, Monnet was an assistant to the French minister of commerce and industry, Étienne Clémentel, who proposed a &quot;new economic order&quot; based on European cooperation. The scheme was officially rejected by the Allies in April 1919.

Due to his experience organizing inter-Allied committees during the war, Monnet was asked to take on the job of Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations by French premier Georges Clemenceau and British statesman Arthur Balfour, upon the League&#x27;s creation in 1919 and after Élie Halévy had declined to take the position, which was reserved for a French national.

Monnet left the League of Nations at the end of 1922. He says &quot;I certainly did not leave out of disenchantment with the League&#x27;s weakness&quot; and he believed &quot;a great deal more could usefully be done.&quot; However, he felt it necessary to devote himself to managing the cognac family business, Monnet Cognac, which was experiencing difficulties. In 1925, Monnet moved to America to accept a partnership in Blair &amp; Co., a New York bank which merged with Bank of America in 1929, forming Bancamerica-Blair Corporation which was owned by Transamerica Corporation. He returned to international politics and, as an international financier, proved to be instrumental to the economic recovery of several Central and Eastern Europe nations. He helped stabilise the Polish zloty in 1927 and the Romanian leu in 1928. In November 1932, the Chinese Minister of Finance invited Jean Monnet to act as chairman of an east–west non-political committee in China for the development of the Chinese economy where he lived (with a six-month interruption) until early 1936. During his time in China, Monnet&#x27;s task of partnering Chinese capital with foreign companies led to the formal inauguration of the China Development Finance Corporation (CDFC) as well as the reorganization of the Chinese railroads.

In 1935, when Monnet was still in Shanghai, he became a business partner of George Murnane (a former colleague of Monnet at Transamerica) in Monnet, Murnane &amp; Co. Murnane was connected to the Wallenberg family in Sweden, the Bosch family in Germany, the Solvays and Boëls in Belgium, and John Foster Dulles, André Meyer, and the Rockefeller family in the United States. He was considered among the most connected persons of his time.

==World War II==

In September 1939, French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier sent Monnet to London to coordinate the organization of Franco-British war supplies. Shortly after the invasion of France in May 1940, Monnet advocated for a Franco-British union because he believed victory was impossible if “the two countries did not act and fight as a single people and if the two nations were not completely and profoundly aware of their unity.&quot; Winston Churchill  supported the union as did Charles de Gaulle and the French prime minister, Paul Reynaud, but the French cabinet was opposed and France instead pursued an armistice with Germany.

Following the failure of the France-UK union attempt, Monnet hosted De Gaulle for a dinner at his London home on , during which De Gaulle first articulated and tested the themes of the historic appeal he would announce on radio the next day. Following the Armistice of 22 June 1940, Monnet disagreed with De Gaulle&#x27;s claim that he alone represented fighting France. He would have preferred that de Gaulle work with others who were supporters, at that time, of continuing the resistance such as General Charles Noguès in North Africa. Also, Monnet thought that an organization centred in London would appear to the French as a movement under British protection and inspired by British interests. In a letter to de Gaulle on June 23, Monnet said he had made these concerns known to British Foreign Office officials Alexander Cadogan and Robert Vansittart, as well as Churchill’s envoy Edward Spears. Monnet would later play a critical role in the consolidation of De Gaulle&#x27;s position as France&#x27;s leader, in Algiers in 1943.

As France was no longer allied with Britain, Monnet resigned as Chairman of the Anglo-French Coordinating Committee and wound up its operations. Churchill invited Monnet to continue his work securing supplies from North America with the British Purchasing Commission. In this role he would ask for rapid and massive increases in the flow of American weapons, and he became known for arguing “Better ten thousand tanks too many than one tank too few.&quot;

Soon after his arrival in Washington, D.C., Monnet became an advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Convinced that America could serve as &quot;the great arsenal of democracy&quot;, he persuaded the President to launch a massive arms production program, both as an economic stimulus and to supply the Allies with military resources. Unlike De Gaulle, Monnet was popular with the Americans and the English. A co-worker of his claimed that sometimes he would help Churchill to write a message to Roosevelt and then subsequently help Roosevelt to compose the response. According to Edward R. Kantowicz, Monnet was impressed by the American organizational energy and saw cooperation with the new superpower as Europe&#x27;s only chance to reorganize and recover itself. In 1941, Roosevelt, with Churchill&#x27;s agreement, launched the Victory Program, which represented the involvement of the United States in the war effort. After the war, British economist John Maynard Keynes stated that Monnet, through his coordination work, had probably shortened World War II by a year.

While in Washington, Monnet and his family lived in a comfortable house built in 1934 at 2415 Foxhall Road NW, which was later home to Adlai Stevenson III and James Baker. He worked from an office of the British Mission at the Willard Hotel.

On , Monnet became one of the first seven members of the French Committee of National Liberation (, CFLN), the French government-in-exile co-chaired by De Gaulle and Henri Giraud and stationed in Algiers, as &quot;Commissaire à l&#x27;Armement&quot; (Minister of Armaments). During a meeting on 5 August of that year, Monnet declared to the Committee:

&quot;There will be no peace in Europe if the States are reconstituted on the basis of national sovereignty, with all that that entails in terms of prestige politics and economic protectionism. The countries of Europe are too small to guarantee their people the prosperity that modern conditions make possible and consequently necessary. Prosperity for the States of Europe and the social developments that must go with it will only be possible if they form a federation or a &quot;European entity&quot; that makes them into a common economic unit.”
==The Blum–Byrnes Agreement==
In 1946, Monnet successfully negotiated the Blum–Byrnes agreement with the United States, which cleared France from a $2.8 billion debt (mostly World War I loans) and provided the country with an additional low-interest loan of $650 million. In return, France opened its cinemas to American movies.

==The Monnet Plan==
Faced with the challenge of reconstruction after WWII, in 1946 France implemented the Modernization and Re-equipment Plan, which was designed to spur economic recovery. This plan is commonly known as the “Monnet Plan” after Jean Monnet, the chief advocate and first head of the General Planning Commission (Le Commissariat général du Plan).

The Monnet Plan emphasized expansion, modernization, efficiency, and modern management practice. Its process – focusing, prioritizing, and pointing the way – has been called “indicative planning” to differentiate it from highly directive and rigid Soviet style planning. 

The Plan’s initial objectives included exceeding France’s 1929 production level by 25% in 1950, which implied an ambitious 11% annual growth rate over five years. Although not all of the goals were met, the Plan has been credited with providing direction, vision, and hope to the nation, and it set France on the road to an economic miracle in the 1950s. 

The Monnet Plan created the impetus for French foreign minister Robert Schuman’s proposal to pool the French and German markets for coal and steel. The Schuman Plan led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, which laid the foundation for the 1958 establishment of the European Economic Community, the forerunner of the European Union.

==European Coal and Steel Community==

Following World War II, when tensions between France and Germany rose over the control of the then vital coal and steel industries, Monnet proposed replacing the International Authority for the Ruhr with an agreement to pool French and German coal and steel industries. On 9 May 1950, with the agreement of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs Robert Schuman made a declaration in the name of the French government. This landmark pronouncement, prepared by Monnet for Schuman and known as the Schuman Declaration, proposed integration of the French and German coal and steel industries under the joint control of a High Authority, open to the other countries of Europe. Schuman declared:

Through the consolidation of basic production and the institution of a new High Authority, whose decisions will bind France, Germany and the other countries that join, this proposal represents the first concrete step towards a European federation, imperative for the preservation of peace.

The date of the Schuman Declaration, 9 May, has been adopted as Europe Day by the European Union. It is generally viewed as the starting point of the development of the Union and its institutions.

Negotiations on the Schuman plan led to the Treaty of Paris (1951), which established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). France and West Germany signed the treaty, alongside Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. In 1952, Jean Monnet became the first president of the ECSC&#x27;s High Authority.

===Luxembourg departure===

The Paris apartment which was to become the headquarters of the Action Committee for the United States of Europe was ready to receive the furniture from our house at Bricherhof on the outskirts of Luxembourg, already packed up. I remember coming home from a walk with Silvia one winter evening to find the house brightly lit and surrounded by cars. My colleagues on the High Authority were waiting for me with their retinue of advisers. At first, I thought it was an improvised farewell party; but they had an embarrassed air which puzzled me. Finally, Etzel pushed forward Michel Gaudet, who made the following statement:

&quot;Monsieur le Président, your legal service has the duty to inform you that you cannot leave your post. We have gone through the Treaty over and over again, and it is clear that you remain President in office for as long as your successor has not been appointed.&quot;

We halted our removal, and I stayed in Luxembourg for five more long months. Everyone had a reason for not hurrying to convene the Ministers of Foreign Affairs ...
Memoirs, 1978

==Action Committee for the United States of Europe==
In 1955, Monnet founded the Action Committee for the United States of Europe in order to revive European construction following the failure of the European Defence Community (EDC). It brought political parties and European trade unions together to become a driving force behind the initiatives which laid the foundation for the European Union as it eventually emerged: first, the European Economic Community (EEC) (1958) (known commonly as the &quot;Common Market&quot;), which was established by the Treaty of Rome of 1957; later the European Communities (1967) with its corresponding bodies, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers, British membership of the Communities (1973), the European Council (1974), the European Monetary System (1979), and a directly elected European Parliament (1979). This process reflected Monnet&#x27;s belief in a &quot;gradualist&quot; approach to constructing European unity.

Monnet resigned and ended the Committee&#x27;s activity on 9 May 1975, the 25th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration.

==Memoirs==
Writing about his life and the principles which drove his action was a longstanding project which Monnet delayed for years as he gave higher priority to his other projects. In the early 1970s, François Fontaine was instrumental in bringing the endeavour to fruition and drafted much of the text, even as Monnet retained ultimate control. The &quot;Memoirs&quot; were published by Fayard in 1976, and an English translation by Richard Mayne by Doubleday in 1978.

==Private life==
In August 1929, during a dinner party in Paris, the 41-year-old Monnet met 22-year-old Italian painter Silvia Giannini (17 August 1907 – 22 August 1982) who had recently married Francisco Giannini, an employee of Monnet when he was a representative in Italy. In April 1931, Silvia gave birth to a daughter, Anna, whose legal father was Giannini.

Since divorce wasn&#x27;t allowed in most European countries, Silvia and Jean Monnet met in Moscow, as it was possible there to obtain citizenship and residence qualifications rapidly and to divorce and remarry at once. In 1934, he returned from China via the Trans-Siberian railway, she from Switzerland. He arranged for Silvia to obtain Soviet citizenship; she immediately divorced her husband and married Jean Monnet. The idea for the Moscow marriage came from Dr. Ludwik Rajchman, whom Monnet had met during his time at the League of Nations (Rajchman was connected to the Soviet Ambassador to China, Dmitrij Bogomołow). It seems that the American and French ambassadors in Moscow, William Bullitt and Charles Alphand, also played a role. The custody of Anna was a problem; in 1935 Silvia took refuge with Anna in the Soviet consulate in Shanghai, where they were living at the time because Francisco Giannini was trying to obtain custody of the child. The legal battle was decided in favour of Silvia in 1937 in New York, but the ruling wasn&#x27;t recognized by some other countries.

In 1941 Monnet and Silvia had another daughter, Marianne. The Monnet family returned to France in 1945 and, after the death of Francisco Giannini in 1974, the couple married canonically in the cathedral of Lourdes. Silvia Monnet was very important to her husband throughout their forty-five years of marriage, according to Louis Joxe, Monnet &quot;would spend hours writing to his wife, whose opinion mattered more to him than that of anyone else&quot;.

==Death and burial==
On 16 March 1979, Jean Monnet died at the age of 90 in his home in Houjarray, Bazoches-sur-Guyonne. His funeral took place in the church of Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury on 20 March 1979, with French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt both present.

On 9 November 1988, on the hundredth anniversary of his birth, his ashes were transferred to the Panthéon in Paris in a ceremony attended by numerous European heads of state and governments.

==Honours==
In 1953 Monnet was awarded the Karlspreis by the city of Aachen in recognition of his achievements.
He received numerous other prizes and honorary degrees, including &quot;Doctor Honoris Causa&quot; from the universities of Cambridge (8 June 1961), Dartmouth (11 June 1961), Yale (12 June 1961), and Oxford (26 June 1963). He was an elected member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1962) and the American Philosophical Society (1964).

On 6 December 1963, he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with Special Distinction, by United States President Lyndon Johnson. The decision had been made by President Kennedy before his assassination.

In 1972, Queen Elizabeth II made him an honorary Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.

He was the first to be bestowed Honorary Citizen of Europe by the European Council of the European Union, for extraordinary work to promote European cooperation on 2 April 1976, he remained the only one for a generation until Helmut Kohl received the same distinction in 1998. Following this, he became the first person then living to be pictured on a Federal Republic of Germany stamp who was not a German head of state.

In the United States, a bill was introduced in 2022 to erect a bench in memory of Monnet in Rock Creek Park, with support from the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission and National Park Service.

===Places===

====Jean Monnet House at Houjarray====

The Jean Monnet House is located in Houjarray, a hamlet of Bazoches-sur-Guyonne, Yvelines, 80 kilometres (50 miles) outside Paris. This old farm became Jean Monnet&#x27;s property in 1945, upon his return to France. It was there that Jean Monnet and his advisors, in the last days of April 1950, drew up the historic declaration that Robert Schuman used to address Europe on 9 May 1950, proposing the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community. In the house, Robert Schuman, Walter Hallstein, Paul-Henri Spaak, Konrad Adenauer, René Pleven, Helmut Schmidt, and many others exchanged their views with Jean Monnet on Europe&#x27;s common future. On Sundays, he had friends passing by come to his house; among them were Dwight Eisenhower, George Ball, and Edward Heath. Monnet liked fireside conversations with journalists such as Walter Lippmann, Hubert Beuve-Méry, or his neighbour Pierre Viansson-Ponté. This house was also where Jean Monnet died on 16 March 1979. The European Parliament acquired the house in 1982 and erected a multimedia conference room in 2000. 

====Public spaces====
Numerous streets, squares, and avenues have been named after Jean Monnet in France and elsewhere in Europe. They include the Place Jean-Monnet in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, and the Jean-Monnet-Strasse in the Moabit neighbourhood of Berlin.

====Educational institutions====

Many educational institutions are named after Monnet, including numerous French Lycées and Jean Monnet University (&quot;Université Jean Monnet de Saint-Étienne&quot;), situated on two campuses in Saint-Étienne. Outside France, educational institutions named after Monnet include a high school in Taiwan, dedicated in 1985 to honour Monnet&#x27;s contribution to the Republic of China and especially to the creation of the China Development Finance Corporation; and the Jean Monnet High School in Bucharest, Romania. The University of Limerick, Ireland, has a lecture theatre named after Monnet.

====Other buildings====
The Jean Monnet Building was the principal location of the European Commission&#x27;s activities in Luxembourg between 1975 and 2016. Its replacement, the Jean Monnet 2 building, will become operational from February 2023.

===Organizations===

====Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe====

The Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe in Lausanne supports initiatives dedicated to the construction of European unity. Its origins date from a meeting between Jean Monnet and Henri Rieben in 1955. It is located on the campus of the University of Lausanne and houses the personal archives of Jean Monnet as well as those of Robert Schuman, Robert Marjolin, François Fontaine, Jacques Van Helmont, Paolo Emilio Taviani, Robert Triffin, and the Earl of Perth.

====Jean Monnet Association====

The Jean Monnet Association, created in 1986 and initially chaired by Étienne Hirsch, is a French non-profit that organizes about 250 conferences on European history and current events each year.

====Jean Monnet Council====

The Jean Monnet Council was formed in the United States in 1988, on the centenary of Monnet&#x27;s birth. It has published several volumes on Monnet, including &quot;Jean Monnet: The Path to European Unity&quot; in 1991, &quot;Monnet and the Americans: The Father of a United Europe and His U.S. Supporters&quot; in 1995, and &quot;The Father of Europe: The Life and Times of Jean Monnet&quot; in 2018. In 1997, it erected a plaque on the Willard Hotel in memory of the office Monnet kept there during World War II.

====Jean Monnet Institute====

The Jean Monnet Institute is a French nonprofit, established in 2021 to leverage Monnet&#x27;s legacy to foster European integration and chaired by Monnet&#x27;s grandson Jean-Marc Lieberherr. One of its early initiatives was a new edition of Monnet&#x27;s Memoirs, with a preface authored by French president Emmanuel Macron.

===Prizes and scholarships===

====Jean Monnet prizes====

The , set up in 1995 by the department of Charente, rewards European authors for books written in, or translated to, French. 

The Jean Monnet Prize for European Integration, given by EuropeanConstitution.eu, a French association, rewards projects contributing to the promotion of European integration. 

Several universities and research centres award prizes named after Jean Monnet.

====Jean Monnet Programme and Chairs====
The European Union maintains Monnet&#x27;s memory with the Jean Monnet Activities, under the Erasmus+ programme of the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA). These activities promote knowledge on European integration and European studies on a worldwide scale, especially at the university level, through the Jean Monnet Centres of Excellence, as well as chairs, policy debates, and support to associations.

Jean Monnet Actions aim to build bridges between academics, researchers and EU policymakers. There is an emphasis on the study of and research on EU integration and in understanding Europe&#x27;s place in a globalised world. Jean Monnet Actions are organised and applied for via higher education institutions.

Jean Monnet Chairs are teaching posts with a specialisation in European Union studies for university professors or senior lecturers. Jean Monnet Chairs can:
* enhance the teaching of EU studies at your institution through the curriculum
* conduct, monitor and supervise research on EU matters at all education levels
* be a mentor and advisor to the next generation of teachers and researchers
* provide expert guidance to future professionals about European matters
Jean Monnet Chairs are encouraged to:
* publish books within their university press during the grant period. The grant will cover part of the publication and, if need be, part of the translation costs
* participate in dissemination and information events in your country and around Europe
* organise events (lectures, seminars, workshops, etc.) with policymakers, civil society and schools
* network with other academics and institutions supported by Jean Monnet
* apply open educational resources, and publish the summaries, content, schedule and expected outcomes of your activities

Jean Monnet chairs have been established, for example, at the following universities (alphabetically):
British educational institutions which honour Monnet include the Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence at King&#x27;s College London, the East Midlands Euro-Centre at Loughborough University, the European Research Institute at the University of Bath, the Jean Monnet Centre at the University of Birmingham, the Jean Monnet European Centre of Excellence at Cambridge, the Jean Monnet European Centre of Excellence at the University of Essex, the Centre for European Union Studies at the University of Hull, the Kent Centre for Europe at the University of Kent, the Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence, a partnership between the University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Salford, the Jean Monnet Centre at Newcastle University, the Jean Monnet Centre for European Studies at the University of Wales

Shortly after his death, Monnet was chosen as patron of the 1980–1981 academic year at the College of Europe. On the centenary of his birth in 1988, he was similarly chosen as class patron by the students who entered École nationale d&#x27;administration that year and graduated in 1990.

In April 2011, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Paris, a new documentary, &quot;Jean Monnet: Father of Europe&quot; was produced. The documentary includes interviews with colleagues of Monnet such as Georges Berthoin, Max Kohnstamm and Jacques-René Rabier, as well as former member of the European Court of Justice David A.O. Edward of the United Kingdom.

<text>Selden G. Hooper (25 December 1904 – 7 February 1976) was the only admiral of the United States Navy to be convicted by court-martial, for homosexual acts carried out post-service.

Hooper was the commissioning commanding officer of the on 22 November 1943.

In &quot;U.S. V. Hooper&quot;, 26 CMR 417 (CMA, 1958), Hooper was tried by general court-martial for sodomy, conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces, and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. Hooper had retired as a rear admiral in 1950, and the acts for which he was tried were committed after he had retired. The defense questioned the military court&#x27;s jurisdiction, but the court explained that &quot;retired personnel are a part of the land or naval forces.&quot; The military retiree, then, is not simply a civilian. The court held that the admiral was &quot;a part of the military forces of this country.&quot; He was described as &quot;an officer of the Navy of the United States, entitled to wear the uniform and to draw pay as such.&quot; He was convicted and sentenced to dismissal and forfeiture of all pay and allowances.

Hooper was the only flag officer of the U.S. Navy to be convicted by court-martial, and strictly speaking, the only Navy flag officer to ever be tried by court-martial. In 1995, Everett L. Greene was acquitted of sexual harassment and other related charges; he had been selected for promotion to rear admiral, but was still a captain when he was tried.

== Personal life and career ==
Son to Rosa Hooper, Hooper&#x27;s career in the military started when he left San Francisco, the town he&#x27;d been raised, to join the National Guard. After graduating from the US Naval Academy of Annapolis, Hooper joined the US Navy as the rank of Ensign. After quickly making lieutenant, he married a daughter of a wealthy paper manufacturer, Kathryn Rising. Just four years later, the United States would enter as a belligerent to World War 2, Hooper was made the commander of the &quot;Fletcher&quot; class destroyer, the &quot;USS Uhlmann&quot;. During service, Hooper was credited with having adverted a crippling attack on American Amphibious Ships.

== Court martial ==
After a series of intelligence missions carried out over 4 weeks in the winter of 1957, four officers of the Office of Naval Intelligence, in which they utilized surveillance gear in an adjacent house they rented out, Hooper was found to be engaging in several homosexual acts. On the first night of surveillance, the officers found a young sailor, Roscoe Braddock, dancing with the retired Navy admiral before witnessing the two kiss. After several subsequent return trips to surveil Hooper&#x27;s residence, the officers discovered another enlisted sailor, John Schmidt, and witnessed the three together, before Hooper and Schmidt undressed and then proceeded to turn the lights out; leaving the officers with strong evidence of homosexual conduct.

In April, the following year, retired Admiral Hooper was officially notified that the commandant of the Eleventh Naval District, Rear Admiral Charles Hartman, has filed charges against him related to the Uniform Code of Military Justice:

* Article 125 - sodomy;
* Article 134 - conduct of a nature to bring discredit on the armed forces;
* Article 135 - conduct unbecoming to an officer and a gentleman.

During the court proceedings, the prosecution (The Navy) enlisted a slew of character witnesses. A significant number were other sailors, including Roscoe Braddock, who, under oath, was forced to admit to sharing a bed with Hooper, thereby corroborating claims of homosexual conduct. The defense for Hooper called upon their own character witnesses, that all testified that Hooper was an upstanding citizen, with a distinguished military record. They also called upon a psychiatrist from San Diego County Hospital, who testified that Hooper was not a homosexual. Despite this, the panel returned a unanimous verdict against Hooper.

<text>A wimple is a medieval form of female headcovering, formed of a large piece of cloth worn draped around the neck and chin, covering the top of the head; it was usually made from white linen or silk. Its use developed in early medieval Europe; in medieval Christianity it was unseemly for a married woman to show her hair. A wimple might be elaborately starched, creased and folded in prescribed ways. Later elaborate versions were supported on wire or wicker framing, such as the cornette.

Italian women abandoned their head coverings in the 15th century or replaced them with transparent gauze, showing their braids. Elaborate braiding and elaborately laundered clothes demonstrated status, because such grooming was performed by others. Today a plain wimple is worn by the nuns of certain orders who retain a traditional habit.

==In literature==
The Wife of Bath and the Prioress are depicted wearing wimples in the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; of Geoffrey Chaucer (1400).

The King James Version of the Bible explicitly lists wimples in Isaiah 3:22 as one of a list of female fineries; however, the Hebrew word () means &quot;kerchief&quot;.

Marvel’s The Scarlet Witch was originally conceived by artist Jack Kirby as wearing a peaked red wimple. In the decades since, it has been reduced in size and evolved into more of a tiara.

<doc id="336296" wikidata="Q313700" url="?curid=336296" title="Henri I, Duke of Guise">
<text>Henri I de Lorraine, Duke of Guise, Prince of Joinville, Count of Eu (31 December 1550 – 23 December 1588), sometimes called (&#x27;Scarface&#x27;), was the eldest son of François, Duke of Guise, and Anna d&#x27;Este. His maternal grandparents were Ercole II d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, and Renée of France. Through his maternal grandfather, he was a descendant of Lucrezia Borgia and Pope Alexander VI.

A key figure in the French Wars of Religion, he was one of the namesakes of the War of the Three Henrys. A powerful opponent of the queen mother, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, Henri was assassinated by the bodyguards of her son, King Henry III.

== Early life ==
Henri was born on 31 December 1550, the eldest son of François de Lorraine, the duke of Guise, one of the leading magnates of France, and Anna d&#x27;Este, daughter of the Duke of Ferrara. In his youth he was friends with Henry III, the future king, and at the behest of Jacques, Duke of Nemours tried to persuade the young prince to run away with him in 1561 to join the arch-Catholic faction, much to the fury of his father and uncle. When he was 12 years old, his father François was assassinated and Henri thus inherited the Duke&#x27;s titles of the Governor of Champagne and Grand Maître de France in 1563.

The Guise family and Guise (as he will henceforth be referred to) craved vengeance against Gaspard II de Coligny, whom they considered responsible for the assassination. As such, he and his uncle Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine would attempt to make a show of force in entering Paris in 1564, but their entry ended with both besieged in their residence and forced to concede. When in 1566 the crown forced Charles at Moulins to make the kiss of peace with Coligny to end their feud, Guise refused to attend. He would also challenge Coligny and Anne de Montmorency to duels, but they rebuffed his attempts.

No longer welcome at court, he and his brother Charles, Duke of Mayenne decided to crusade against the Ottoman Empire in Hungary, serving under Alfonso II d&#x27;Este, with a retinue of 350 men. In September 1568 he reached his majority, just as the Guise returned to the centre of French politics with his uncle&#x27;s readmission to the Privy Council.

==Entry into politics==
Guise took an active military role in the second and third wars of the French Wars of Religion, fighting at the Battle of Saint-Denis in 1567, the Battle of Jarnac in 1569, and successfully defending Poitiers during a siege by Admiral Coligny. He was wounded at the Battle of Moncontour.

In 1570 the third war of religion was brought to an end with the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, part of which stipulated a marriage between the Protestant king of Navarre (future king Henry IV) and the King&#x27;s sister Margaret of Valois as a means of ensuring stability. Around this time Guise began a romance with the King&#x27;s sister, apparently with pretensions to her hand in marriage, which quickly became known around court. Upon discovering this, Margaret&#x27;s brothers Charles IX and the duke of Anjou, were furious, assaulting Margaret in anger. While some suggested Guise be punished with assassination, it was settled on banishing him from court for his indiscretions. On 3 October he married Catherine of Cleves, thus assuming the title of Count of Eu from her inheritance.

The August 1572 marriage between the king of Navarre and Margaret necessitated the presence of the majority of the Protestant leadership in Paris. Shortly after the wedding, Coligny, who had made a rare visit to the capital for the occasion, was shot in the shoulder in an attempted assassination. Guise was a chief suspect of having ordered the attempt, due to his long running feud. 

As the situation in Paris deteriorated over the next several days, the royal council planned and executed a targeted elimination of the Protestant leadership in Paris, which would spiral into the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre. During the massacre Guise would oversee the murder of Coligny, and attempted but failed to capture several other targets, but was displeased at the situation descending into a general massacre, shielding fleeing Protestants in his residence.

When the wars of religion subsequently resumed Guise was wounded at the Battle of Dormans, and was thereafter known, like his father, as . With a charismatic and brilliant public reputation, he rose to heroic stature among the militant Catholic population of France as an opponent of the Huguenots.

== Catholic League ==
In 1576 he formed the Catholic League. His rapidly deteriorating relations with the new King, Henry III (formally the duke of Anjou) created further conflict, known as the War of the Three Henries (1584–1588).
At the death in 1584 of Francis, Duke of Anjou, the king&#x27;s brother (which left the king of Navarre, the Protestant champion, as heir to the throne), Guise concluded the Treaty of Joinville with Philip II of Spain. This compact declared that the Cardinal de Bourbon should succeed King Henry, in preference to the king of Navarre. Henry now sided with the Catholic League (1585), which made war with great success on the Protestants. Guise sent his cousin, Charles, Duke of Aumale, to lead a rising in Picardy (which could also support the retreat of the Spanish Armada). Alarmed, Henry ordered Guise to remain in Champagne; he defied the king and on 9 May 1588 Guise entered Paris, bringing to a head his ambiguous challenge to royal authority in the Day of the Barricades and forcing King Henry to flee.

==Assassination==

The League now controlled France; the king was forced to accede to its demands and created Guise Lieutenant-General of France. But Henry refused to be treated as a mere puppet by the League, and decided upon a bold stroke. On 22 December 1588, Guise spent the night with his current mistress Charlotte de Sauve, the most accomplished and notorious member of Catherine de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s group of female spies known as the &quot;Flying Squadron&quot;. The following morning at the Château de Blois, Guise was summoned to attend the king, and was at once assassinated by &quot;the Forty-five&quot;, the king&#x27;s bodyguard, as Henry looked on. Guise&#x27;s brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, was likewise assassinated the next day. The deed aroused such outrage among the remaining relatives and allies of Guise that Henry was forced to take refuge with the king of Navarre. Henry was assassinated the following year by Jacques Clément, an agent of the Catholic League.

According to Baltasar Gracián in &quot;A Pocket Mirror for Heroes&quot;, it was once said of him to Henry III, &quot;Sire, he does good wholeheartedly: those who do not receive his good influence directly receive it by reflection. When deeds fail him, he resorts to words. There is no wedding he does not enliven, no baptism at which he is not godfather, no funeral he does not attend. He is courteous, humane, generous, the honorer of all and the detractor of none. In a word, he is a king by affection, just as Your Majesty is by law.&quot;

==Issue==
He married on 4 October 1570 in Paris to Catherine of Cleves (1548–1633), Countess of Eu, by whom he had fourteen children:
# Charles, Duke of Guise (1571–1640), who succeeded him
# Henri (30 June 1572, Paris – 3 August 1574)
# Catherine (3 November 1573) (died at birth)

# Charles (1 January 1576, Paris) (died at birth)
# Marie (1 June 1577 – 1582)
# Claude, Duke of Chevreuse (1578–1657) married Marie de Rohan, daughter of Hercule de Rohan, duc de Montbazon
# Catherine (b. 29 May 1579), died young
# Christine (21 January 1580) (died at birth)
# François (14 May 1581 – 29 September 1582)
# Renée (1585 – 13 June 1626, Reims), Abbess of St. Pierre
# Jeanne (31 July 1586 – 8 October 1638, Jouarre), Abbess of Jouarre
# Louise Marguerite, (1588 – 30 April 1631, Château d&#x27;Eu), married on 24 July 1605 François, Prince of Conti
# François Alexandre (7 February 1589 – 1 June 1614, Château des Baux-de-Provence), a Knight of the Order of Malta

==In literature and the arts==

===Literature===
The Duke of Guise appears as an archetypal Machiavellian schemer in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s play &quot;The Massacre at Paris&quot;, which was written about 20 years after the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre. The death of the duke is also mentioned, by the ghost of Machiavelli himself, in the opening lines of &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot;. He appears (as The Guise) in George Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Bussy D&#x27;Ambois&quot; and its sequel, &quot;The Revenge of Bussy D&#x27;Ambois&quot;.

John Dryden and Nathaniel Lee wrote &quot;The Duke of Guise&quot; (1683), based on events during the reign of Henry III.

He appears in the short novel &quot;The Princess of Montpensier&quot;, by Madame de La Fayette.
He appears in Voltaire&#x27;s epic poem &quot;La Henriade&quot; (1723).
He is one of the characters in Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s novel &quot;La Reine Margot&quot; and its sequels, &quot;La Dame de Monsoreau&quot; and &quot;The Forty-Five Guardsmen&quot;. He also appears prominently in Heinrich Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Young Henry of Navarre&quot; (1935).

Stanley Weyman&#x27;s novel &quot;A Gentleman of France&quot; includes the Duke of Guise in its tale about the War of the Three Henries.

Ken Follett&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;A Column of Fire&quot; features Henri, Duke of Guise as a prominent character, and explores his involvement with the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre.

===Film===
In the 2010 film &quot;The Princess of Montpensier&quot;, he was portrayed by actor Gaspard Ulliel.

<doc id="336297" wikidata="Q134140" url="?curid=336297" title="Abu Simbel">
<text>Abu Simbel is a historic site comprising two massive rock-cut temples in the village of Abu Simbel (), Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt, near the border with Sudan. It is located on the western bank of Lake Nasser, about southwest of Aswan (about by road). The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC, during the 19th Dynasty reign of the Pharaoh Ramesses II. Their huge external rock relief figures of Ramesses II have become iconic. His wife, Nefertari, and children can be seen in smaller figures by his feet. Sculptures inside the Great Temple commemorate Ramesses II&#x27;s heroic leadership at the Battle of Kadesh.

The complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968 to higher ground to avoid it being submerged by Lake Nasser, the Aswan Dam reservoir. As part of International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia, an artificial hill was made from a domed structure to house the Abu Simbel Temples, under the supervision of a Polish archaeologist, Kazimierz Michałowski, from the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw.

The Abu Simbel complex, and other relocated temples from Nubian sites such as Philae, Amada, Wadi es-Sebua, are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Nubian Monuments.

==History==

===Construction===
During his reign, Ramesses II embarked on an extensive building program throughout Egypt and Nubia, which Egypt controlled. Nubia was very important to the Egyptians because it was a source of gold and many other precious trade goods. He, therefore, built several grand temples there in order to impress upon the Nubians Egypt&#x27;s might and Egyptianize the people of Nubia. The most prominent temples are the rock-cut temples near the modern village of Abu Simbel, at the Second Nile Cataract, the border between Lower Nubia and Upper Nubia. There are two temples, the Great Temple, dedicated to Ramesses II himself, and the Small Temple, dedicated to his chief wife Queen Nefertari.

Construction of the temple complex started in and lasted for about 20 years, until 1244 BC. It was known as the Temple of Ramesses, Beloved by Amun.

===Rediscovery===
With the passage of time, the temples fell into disuse and the Great Temple eventually became mostly covered by a sand dune. By the 6th century BC, the sand already covered the statues of the main temple up to their knees. The temple was forgotten by Europeans until March 1813, when the Swiss researcher Johann Ludwig Burckhardt found the small temple and top frieze of the main temple. 
When we reached the top of the mountain, I left my guide, with the camels, and descended an almost perpendicular cleft, choaked with sand, to view the temple of Ebsambal, of which I had heard many magnificent descriptions. There is no road at present to this temple... It stands about twenty feet above the surface of the water, entirely cut out of the almost perpendicular rocky side of the mountain, and in complete preservation. In front of the entrance are six erect colossal figures, representing juvenile persons, three on each side, placed in narrow recesses, and looking towards the river; they are all of the same size, stand with one foot before the other, and are accompanied by smaller figures... Having, as I supposed, seen all the antiquities of Ebsambal, I was about to ascend the sandy side of the mountain by the same way I had descended; when having luckily turned more to the southward, I fell in with what is yet visible of four immense colossal statues cut out of the rock, at a distance of about two hundred yards from the temple; they stand in a deep recess, excavated in the mountain; but it is greatly to be regretted, that they are now almost entirely buried beneath the sands, which are blown down here in torrents. The entire head, and part of the breast and arms of one of the statues are yet above the surface; of the one next to it scarcely any part is visible, the head being broken off, and the body covered with sand to above the shoulders; of the other two, the bonnets only appear. It is difficult to determine, whether these statues are in a sitting or standing posture; their backs adhere to a portion of rock, which projects from the main body, and which may represent a part of a chair, or may be merely a column for support.

Burckhardt talked about his discovery with the Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni, who travelled to the site, but was unable to dig out an entry to the temple. Belzoni returned in 1817, this time succeeding in his attempt to enter the complex. A detailed early description of the temples, together with contemporaneous line drawings, can be found in Edward William Lane&#x27;s &quot;Description of Egypt&quot; (1825–1828).

===Relocation===

In 1959, an international donations campaign to save the monuments of Nubia began: the southernmost relics of this ancient civilization were under threat from the rising waters of the Nile that were about to result from the construction of the Aswan High Dam.

One scheme to save the temples was based on an idea by William MacQuitty to build a clear freshwater dam around the temples, with the water inside kept at the same height as the Nile. There were to be underwater viewing chambers. In 1962 the idea was made into a proposal by architects Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry and civil engineer Ove Arup.

The salvage of the Abu Simbel temples began in 1964 by a multinational team of archeologists, engineers and skilled heavy equipment operators working together under the UNESCO banner; it cost some $40 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was carefully cut into large blocks (up to 30 tons, averaging 20 tons), dismantled, lifted and reassembled in a new location 65 metres higher and 200 metres back from the river, in one of the greatest challenges of archaeological engineering in history. Some structures were even saved from under the waters of Lake Nasser. Today, a few hundred tourists visit the temples daily. Most visitors arrive by road from Aswan, the nearest city. Others arrive by plane at Abu Simbel Airport, an airfield specially constructed for the temple complex whose sole destination is Aswan International Airport.

The complex consists of two temples. The larger one is dedicated to Ra-Horakhty, Ptah and Amun, Egypt&#x27;s three state deities of the time, and features four large statues of Ramesses II in the facade. The smaller temple is dedicated to the goddess Hathor, personified by Nefertari, Ramesses&#x27;s most beloved of his many wives. The temple is now open to the public.

==Great Temple==
The Great Temple at Abu Simbel, which took about twenty years to build, was completed around year 24 of the reign of Ramesses the Great (which corresponds to 1265 BC). It was dedicated to the gods Amun, Ra-Horakhty, and Ptah, as well as to the deified Ramesses himself. It is generally considered the grandest and most beautiful of the temples commissioned during the reign of Ramesses II, and one of the most beautiful in Egypt.

===Entrance===
The single entrance is flanked by four colossal, statues, each representing Ramesses II seated on a throne and wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. The statue to the immediate left of the entrance was damaged in an earthquake, causing the head and torso to fall away; these fallen pieces were not restored to the statue during the relocation but placed at the statue&#x27;s feet in the positions originally found.
Next to Ramesses&#x27;s legs are a number of other, smaller statues, none higher than the knees of the pharaoh, depicting: his chief wife, Nefertari Meritmut; his queen mother Mut-Tuy; his first two sons, Amun-her-khepeshef and Ramesses B; and his first six daughters: Bintanath, Baketmut, Nefertari, Meritamen, Nebettawy and Isetnofret.

The façade behind the colossi is high and wide. It carries a frieze depicting twenty-two baboons worshipping the rising sun with upraised arms and a stele recording the marriage of Ramesses to a daughter of king Ḫattušili III, which sealed the peace between Egypt and the Hittites. 

The entrance doorway itself is surmounted by bas-relief images of the king worshipping the falcon-headed Ra Horakhty, whose statue stands in a large niche. Ra holds the hieroglyph &quot;user&quot; and a feather in his right hand, with Maat (the goddess of truth and justice) in his left; this is a cryptogram for Ramesses II&#x27;s throne name, &quot;User-Maat-Re&quot;.

===Interior===
The inner part of the temple has the same triangular layout that most ancient Egyptian temples follow, with rooms decreasing in size from the entrance to the sanctuary. The temple is complex in structure and quite unusual because of its many side chambers. The hypostyle hall (sometimes also called a pronaos) is long and wide and is supported by eight huge Osirid pillars depicting the deified Ramesses linked to the god Osiris, the god of fertility, agriculture, the afterlife, the dead, resurrection, life and vegetation, to indicate the everlasting nature of the pharaoh. The colossal statues along the left-hand wall bear the white crown of Upper Egypt, while those on the opposite side are wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt (pschent). The bas-reliefs on the walls of the pronaos depict battle scenes in the military campaigns that Ramesses waged. Much of the sculpture is given to the Battle of Kadesh, on the Orontes river in present-day Syria, in which the Egyptian king fought against the Hittites. The most famous relief shows the king on his chariot shooting arrows against his fleeing enemies, who are being taken prisoner. Other scenes show Egyptian victories in Libya and Nubia.

From the hypostyle hall, one enters the second pillared hall, which has four pillars decorated with beautiful scenes of offerings to the gods. There are depictions of Ramesses and Nefertari with the sacred boats of Amun and Ra-Horakhty. This hall gives access to a transverse vestibule, in the middle of which is the entrance to the sanctuary. Here, on a black wall, are rock cut sculptures of four seated figures: Ra-Horakhty, the deified king Ramesses, and the gods Amun Ra and Ptah. Ra-Horakhty, Amun Ra and Ptah were the main divinities in that period and their cult centers were at Heliopolis, Thebes and Memphis respectively.

===Solar alignment===
It is believed that the axis of the temple was positioned by the ancient Egyptian architects in such a way that on October 22 and February 22, the rays of the sun would penetrate the sanctuary and illuminate the sculptures on the back wall, except for the statue of Ptah, a god connected with the realm of the dead, who always remained in the dark. People gather at Abu Simbel on these days to witness this.

These dates are allegedly the king&#x27;s birthday and coronation day, respectively. There is no direct evidence to support this. It is logical to assume, however, that these dates had some relation to a significant event. In fact, according to calculations made on the basis of the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (Sothis) and inscriptions found by archaeologists, this date must have been October 22. This image of the king was enhanced and revitalized by the energy of the solar star, and the deified Ramesses the Great could take his place next to Amun-Ra and Ra-Horakhty.

Because of the accumulated drift of the Tropic of Cancer due to Earth&#x27;s axial precession over the past 3 millennia, the event&#x27;s date must have been different when the temple was built. This is compounded by the fact that the temple was relocated from its original setting, so the current alignment may not be as precise as the original one.

===Greek graffito===
A graffito inscribed in Greek on the left leg of the colossal seated statue of Ramesses II, on the south side of the entrance to the temple records that:

 Kerkis was located near the Fifth Cataract of the Nile &quot;which stood well within the Cushite Kingdom.&quot;

==Small Temple==

The temple of Hathor and Nefertari, also known as the Small Temple, was built about northeast of the temple of Ramesses II and was dedicated to the goddess Hathor and Ramesses II&#x27;s chief consort, Nefertari. This was in fact the second time in ancient Egyptian history that a temple was dedicated to a queen. The first time, Akhenaten dedicated a temple to his great royal wife, Nefertiti. The rock-cut facade is decorated with two groups of colossi that are separated by the large gateway. The statues, slightly more than high, are of the king and his queen. On either side of the portal are two statues of the king, wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt (south colossus) and the double crown (north colossus); these are flanked by statues of the queen.

Remarkably, this is one of very few instances in Egyptian art where the statues of the king and his consort have equal size. Traditionally, the statues of the queens stood next to those of the pharaoh, but were never taller than his knees. Ramesses went to Abu Simbel with his wife in the 24th year of his reign. As the Great Temple of the king, there are small statues of princes and princesses next to their parents. In this case they are positioned symmetrically: on the south side (at left as one faces the gateway) are, from left to right, princes Meryatum and Meryre, princesses Meritamen and Henuttawy, and princes Pareherwenemef and Amun-her-khepeshef, while on the north side the same figures are in reverse order. The plan of the Small Temple is a simplified version of that of the Great Temple.

As in the larger temple dedicated to the king, the hypostyle hall in the smaller temple is supported by six pillars; in this case, however, they are not Osiris pillars depicting the king, but are decorated with scenes with the queen playing the sistrum (an instrument sacred to the goddess Hathor), together with the gods Horus, Khnum, Khonsu, and Thoth, and the goddesses Hathor, Isis, Maat, Mut of Asher, Satis and Taweret; in one scene Ramesses is presenting flowers or burning incense. The capitals of the pillars bear the face of the goddess Hathor; this type of column is known as Hathoric. The bas-reliefs in the pillared hall illustrate the deification of the king, the destruction of his enemies in the north and south (in these scenes the king is accompanied by his wife), and the queen making offerings to the goddesses Hathor and Mut. The hypostyle hall is followed by a vestibule, access to which is given by three large doors. On the south and the north walls of this chamber there are two graceful and poetic bas-reliefs of the king and his consort presenting papyrus plants to Hathor, who is depicted as a cow on a boat sailing in a thicket of papyri. On the west wall, Ramesses II and Nefertari are depicted making offerings to the god Horus and the divinities of the Cataracts—Satis, Anubis and Khnum.

The rock-cut sanctuary and the two side chambers are connected to the transverse vestibule and are aligned with the axis of the temple. The bas-reliefs on the side walls of the small sanctuary represent scenes of offerings to various gods made either by the pharaoh or the queen. On the back wall, which lies to the west along the axis of the temple, there is a niche in which Hathor, as a divine cow, seems to be coming out of the mountain: the goddess is depicted as the Mistress of the temple dedicated to her and to queen Nefertari, who is intimately linked to the goddess.

<text>Fernanda Abreu (born September 8, 1961) is a Brazilian singer.

==Biography==
Fernanda was born and raised in a middle-class family of the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. Her first notable public appearance was the backing vocal of the band Blitz until 1986. After that, in 1990, she started a solo career, achieving great success in her native country.

In 1989, she met Herbert Vianna, and with his help and encouragement formed a funk band. Her first solo album, &quot;SLA Radical Dance Disco Club&quot; (1990), was produced by Herbert Vianna and Fábio Fonseca and had a hit with &quot;A Noite&quot;, composed with Luiz Stein and Laufer. Her second album, &quot;SLA2/Be Sample&quot; (1992), was one of the earliest Brazilian pop records to extensively employ the sampler, and had success with &quot;Rio 40 Graus&quot;, composed with Fausto Fawcett and Laufer, portraying Rio de Janeiro climate, people and lifestyle. Since then, Abreu has been considered the first lady of Brazilian funk.

In 2006, she released &quot;Ao Vivo MTV&quot;, the first DVD of her career, which includes many of her hit songs.

Abreu is married to the musician and designer Luiz Stein and has 2 daughters, Alice and Sofia.

<text>John Jenkins (1592–1678), was an English composer who was born in Maidstone, Kent and who died at Kimberley, Norfolk.

==Biography==
Little is known of his early life. The son of Henry Jenkins, a carpenter who occasionally made musical instruments, he may have been the &quot;Jack Jenkins&quot; employed in the household of Anne Russell, Countess of Warwick in 1603. The first positive historical record of Jenkins is amongst the musicians who performed the masque &quot;The Triumph of Peace&quot; in 1634 at the court of King Charles I. Jenkins was considered a virtuoso on the lyra viol. Charles commented that Jenkins did &quot;wonders on an inconsiderable instrument.&quot;

When the English Civil War broke out in 1642 it forced Jenkins, like many others, to migrate to the rural countryside. During the 1640s he was employed as music-master to two Royalist families, the Derham family at West Dereham and Hamon le Strange of Hunstanton. He was also a friend of the composer William Lawes (1602–1645), who was shot and died in battle at the siege of Chester.

Around 1640 Jenkins revived the &quot;In Nomine&quot;, an archaic form for a consort of viols, based upon a traditional plainsong theme. He wrote a notable piece of programme music consisting of a pavane and galliard depicting the clash of opposing sides, the mourning for the dead and the celebration of victory after the siege of Newark (1646).

In the 1650s Jenkins became resident music-master of Lord Dudley North in Cambridgeshire, whose son Roger wrote his biography. It was in these years, during the Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell, in the absence of much competition or organised music-making, that Jenkins took the occasion to write more than 70 suites for amateur household players.

After the Restoration he obtained a place as a musician to the Royal Court. Although the viol consort was less fashionable in the court of king Charles II, Roger North wrote:

:&quot;Tho&#x27; he for many years was incapable to attend, the Court musicians had so much value for him, that advantage was not taken, but he received his salary as they were paid&quot;.

Something of Jenkins&#x27;s own temperament is indicated by his setting the religious poetry of George Herbert to music. Like Joseph Haydn, he was a pious, reticent, and private person. Workmanlike and industrious in composition, he wrote dances &quot;by the cart-load&quot; according to North, who also stated –

:&quot;he was certainly a happy person...of an easy temper, superior in his profession, well accepted by all, knew no want, saw himself outrun by the world, and having lived a good Christian, died in peace&quot;.

Jenkins is buried in the nave of St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Kimberley, Norfolk, with this inscription:
::&quot;Under this Stone Rare Jenkins lie&quot;
::&quot;The Master of the Musick Art&quot;
::&quot;Whom from the Earth the God on High&quot;
::&quot;Called up to Him to bear his part.&quot;
::&quot;Aged eighty six October twenty seven&quot;
::&quot;In anno seventy eight he went to Heaven.&quot;

==Musical style==
Jenkins was a long-active and prolific composer whose many years of life, spanning the time from William Byrd to Henry Purcell, witnessed great changes in English music. He is noted for developing the viol consort fantasia, being influenced in the 1630s by an earlier generation of English composers including Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger, Thomas Lupo, John Coprario and Orlando Gibbons. Jenkins composed numerous 4, 5, and 6 part fantasias for viol consort, almans, courants and pavanes, and he breathed new life into the antiquated form of the &quot;In Nomine&quot;. He was less experimental than his friend William Lawes; indeed, Jenkins&#x27;s music was more conservative than that of many of his contemporaries. It is characterised by a sensuous lyricism, highly skilled craftsmanship, and an original usage of tonality and counterpoint.

The musicologist Wilfrid Mellers claimed that J. S. Bach&#x27;s Orchestral Suites No. 3 and No. 4 in D major (BWV 1068–69) recalled the sensibility of the physician-philosopher Sir Thomas Browne; however, the melancholic pavans, meditative fantasias and vigorous allemands of Jenkins are closer in era, antique style and temperament, to his Norfolk contemporary than Bach. Jenkins may even have socially met or performed in the presence of Browne while employed in his retirement years by Sir Philip Wodehouse of Kimberley as correspondence between Browne and Wodehouse survives.

<text>Voice Crack was a Swiss electronic free improvisation band. Formed in late 1972 by Andy Guhl and Norbert Möslang, Voice Crack began as a free jazz duo. Then they used pre-recorded tape effects and live sound processing. By 1983 they had eliminated normal instruments in favor of what they called &quot;cracked everyday electronics&quot;. This included &quot;radios, turntables, transmitters, dictating machines&quot; and other items that are cracked open and manipulated to produce &quot;new sounds using magnetic and radio waves in a complex system controlled by movements of their hands and by light.&quot; 

The result consisted of buzzes, clicks, drones, and oscillations. Erstwhile Records described it as &quot;cascading magnetic waves&quot; that &quot;arc across the sky as three-headed critters race and rummage through alien flora.&quot; Voice Crack&#x27;s work was favorably compared to some of John Cage&#x27;s.

Voice Crack collaborated with Borbetomagus and Butch Morris and were members of poire z. The group disbanded in 2002.

<doc id="336306" wikidata="Q1187605" url="?curid=336306" title="Denis Quilley">
<text>Denis Clifford Quilley (26 December 1927 – 5 October 2003) was an English actor and singer.
From a family with no theatrical connections, Quilley was determined from an early age to become an actor. He was taken on by the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in his teens, and after a break for compulsory military service he began a West End career in 1950, succeeding Richard Burton in &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Not For Burning&quot;. In the 1950s he appeared in revue, musicals, operetta and on television as well as in classic and modern drama in the theatre.

During the 1960s Quilley established himself as a leading actor, making his first films and starring on Australian television. In the early 1970s he was a member of Laurence Olivier&#x27;s National Theatre company. He joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1977 in the central role in &quot;Privates on Parade&quot;, which was later made into a feature film. His later parts in musicals included the title role in &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; (1980) and Georges in &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; (1986).

In the 1990s Quilley returned to the National Theatre company, playing a wide range of parts, from Shakespearean comedy to Jacobean revenge tragedy, Victorian classics and his final role, a bibulous millionaire in the musical &quot;Anything Goes&quot;.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Quilley was born in Islington, North London, the son of Clifford Charles Quilley, a Post Office telegraphist, and his wife Ada Winifred, &quot;née&quot; Stanley. He won a scholarship to Bancroft&#x27;s School in Woodford Green, London, and was expected to go from there to a university, but he was determined to become an actor as soon as possible. He made his stage debut with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre Company, during the 1945 season, in a company that, he recalled, included Paul Scofield, Stanley Baker, Paul Eddington, Alun Owen and &quot;a 20-year-old &quot;wunderkind&quot; director called Peter Brook, of whom everybody was already in some awe.&quot;

Quilley&#x27;s early career was interrupted when he was conscripted for national service in the army, based in Khartoum. His first London appearance after his release from the forces was at the Globe in 1950, when he took over the part of Richard in John Gielgud&#x27;s production of &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Not For Burning&quot; from Richard Burton, whom he had understudied in the early months of the run. The understudy to Claire Bloom in the play was Stella Chapman, whom Quilley married in 1949. They had a son and two daughters.

Later in 1950 Quilley joined the Old Vic Company for a British Council tour of Italy, playing Fabian in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and Gratiano in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. He took part in a revival of the 17th century gigue &quot;Michael and Francis&quot; at Hampton Court as part of the Festival of Britain in 1951, and sang in other performances by the London Opera Club alongside established opera singers, including their fifth anniversary concert at the Arts Council in 1953. In 1953 he appeared in revue, with Max Adrian, Betty Marsden and Moyra Fraser in &quot;Airs on a Shoestring,&quot; which ran for more than 700 performances. In 1955 he had his first leading role in a West End production, playing Geoffrey Morris in the musical &quot;Wild Thyme&quot;, by Philip Guard and Donald Swann. In &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Philip Hope-Wallace wrote, &quot;Denis Quilley turns out a comparatively rare figure nowadays: a presentable singing English hero, a most likeable performance.&quot; In 1956 Quilley opened in another long-running show, &quot;Grab Me a Gondola&quot; which played for more than 600 performances.

One of Quilley&#x27;s other singing roles of the 1950s was the title character in Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s operetta &quot;Candide&quot;. It ran for only sixty performances in this first London production in 1959; Quilley returned to the piece later in his career, playing the bombastic Baron and the misanthropic Martin in a National Theatre production in 1999. Quilley made no cinema films in the 1950s, but appeared in several television productions, ranging from Shakespeare (Bassanio in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, 1955) to detective fiction (Jimmy Sutane in &quot;Dancers in Mourning&quot; (1959).

===1960s===
After playing in short runs of non-musical productions Quilley returned to a singing role in 1960, when he took over from Keith Michell as Nestor-le-Fripe in &quot;Irma la Douce&quot;. He made his first Broadway appearance the following year, again taking over the part of Nestor and subsequently touring the US with the production. After returning to England, he appeared at the Open Air Theatre, Regent&#x27;s Park in June, 1963, as Benedick in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. In November of that year he played Antipholus of Ephesus in &quot;The Boys From Syracuse&quot;, with Bob Monkhouse as his twin brother, also recorded. At the Savoy in 1964 he played Charles Condomine in the musical &quot;High Spirits&quot;, an adaptation of Coward&#x27;s &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; which had a run of three months. Quilley sang in two complete BBC Gilbert and Sullivan radio broadcasts in 1966; Strephon in &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, and Florian in &quot;Princess Ida&quot;.

In 1965, Quilley appeared in the science-fiction TV series &quot;Undermind&quot; playing Professor Val Randolph - a scientist who after four episodes is revealed to be an alien traitor. The same year he made his first cinema film, playing Ben in &quot;Life at the Top&quot;. His only other film of the 1960s was &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969), in which he appeared as Weston. In the later 1960s he worked extensively in Australia; he toured with June Bronhill in the musical &quot;Robert and Elizabeth&quot;, and became known for his role as Customs Inspector Ted Hallam in ABC Television&#x27;s drama series, &quot;Contrabandits&quot;.

Returning to Britain in 1969 Quilley joined the company of the Nottingham Playhouse, which was among the leading repertory theatres of the time. Among his roles there was Archie Rice in John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, a part created in the original London production by Laurence Olivier. By this time Olivier was in charge of the National Theatre; the director Michael Blakemore, one of his team, saw the new production and recommended Quilley to Olivier.

===1970s===
In the 1970s and again towards the end of his career Quilley was a member of the National company, first at the Old Vic and then at the new building on the South Bank. Under Olivier&#x27;s directorship he played Tullus Aufidius in &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, with Anthony Hopkins in the title role (1971); Jamie in &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot; with Olivier (1971, filmed for television in 1973); Banquo in &quot;Macbeth&quot; (with Hopkins); Bolingbroke in &quot;Richard II&quot;; Crabtree in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;; Hildy Johnson in &quot;The Front Page&quot; (all 1972) and Lopakhin in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; (1973). In &quot;The Times&quot;, the critic Barry Norman said that Quilley was &quot;the only Banquo I have ever seen act Macbeth off the stage&quot;. When Peter Hall succeeded Olivier in 1975, Quilley was the only member of the old company to be invited to appear in the opening production of the new regime, playing Caliban to Gielgud&#x27;s Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot;. When the National moved to the new building in 1976, Quilley disliked acting there; he found it &quot;like going to work in a factory&quot;, and he declined to return during the next 14 seasons.

Quilley made two cinema films in the 1970s, playing Antonio Foscarelli in &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; and Bateson in &quot;The Black Windmill&quot; (both 1974). He appeared on television in a wide range of roles, from Commander Traynor in a children&#x27;s science fiction series, &quot;Timeslip&quot; (1970), to Charles II in &quot;A Bill of Mortality&quot; (1975), George Cannon in a serialisation of the &quot;Clayhanger&quot; novels (1975), and the title role in Frederic Raphael&#x27;s version of Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Agamemnon&quot; (1979).

In 1977, the Royal Shakespeare Company offered Quilley the role of Captain Terri Dennis in Peter Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Privates On Parade&quot;. It was a singing role, but far removed from the romantic leads he had sung before. The character is a camp performer and director in a 1940s army song-and-dance troupe in Malaya. At first he declined the role, but reconsidered, reckoning the captain to be the most human character in the piece; he played him, as &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported, &quot;as a vulnerable human being rather than a buffoon&quot;. For his performance Quilley won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical. He reprised the role in a film version made in 1982. Also in 1977, on the West End, Quilley played James opposite Deborah Kerr in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Candida&quot;. His last stage part of the decade was Sidney in Ira Levin&#x27;s thriller, &quot;Deathtrap&quot;, which had a short run at the Garrick Theatre.

===1980s===
Quilley returned to musicals in 1980, playing the title role in the first London production of Hugh Wheeler and Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;. He won his second SWET award for the performance. He continued to divide his time between the musical and non-musical theatre. In 1983 he played Jupiter/Napoleon III in the BBC television production of &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;. In 1984 Quilley appeared on the original concept album for the musical &quot;Chess&quot; as Molokov. In 1985 at the Chichester Festival he co-starred with Diana Rigg in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. Later that year he was in a BBC Mini-series &quot;Murder of a Moderate Man&quot; and a West End thriller, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, before returning to musical theatre, in &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; in 1986. He played Georges, the partner of the flamboyant Albin (George Hearn). In &quot;The Guardian&quot; Michael Billington wrote that Quilley made his character &quot;dapper, ebullient and tender: he persuades you he might have both sired a son and loved a man.&quot; In 1989 he played Francisco Pizarro in a national tour of &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot;. Billington commented that Quilley &quot;conveys Pizzaro&#x27;s journey from tough, hard brutal commander to enraptured idolater and, finally, grieving lover: he is at once indisputably masculine and a figure skittishly enlivened by his rival&#x27;s physical presence.&quot;

During the 1980s Quilley continued to appear in numerous television broadcasts, playing parts like Parris in &quot;The Crucible&quot;, W. E. Gladstone in &quot;Number 10&quot;, Captain Waterhouse in &quot;Tales Of The Unexpected&quot;, Peter in a biblical mini-series &quot;A.D.&quot; (1985) and Dr. Leon Sterndale in the 1988 Sherlock Holmes adaptation of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Foot&quot;. His cinema roles in the 1980s were Kenneth Marshall in &quot;Evil under the Sun&quot; (1982), Captain Dennis in the film of &quot;Privates on Parade&quot; (1982), Rejeb in &quot;Memed My Hawk&quot; (1984), the prophet Samuel in &quot;King David&quot; (1985), and the Prime Minister in &quot;Foreign Body&quot; (1986). He took the role of God in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; in London in 1995.

===1990s===
In 1993 Quilley played Bob Carruthers in the Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Solitary Cyclist&quot; for the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; drama series. As part of the character, he demonstrated his fine singing voice. Quilley played Judge Turpin in the 1993 revival of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; at the National Theatre, resuming his original role as the demon barber later in the run. His other roles at the National included Sir Oliver Surface in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1990), Brachiano in &quot;The White Devil&quot; (1991), Falstaff in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, Nestor in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (1999), Sir John Vesey in &quot;Money&quot;, (1999), Polonius in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (2000) and George Pye in &quot;Humble Boy&quot; (2001). In his spells at the National from the 1970s onwards he played a total of 28 roles. His last stage performance was as the bibulous tycoon Elisha Whitney in Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Anything Goes&quot; at the Olivier Theatre in 2002. The production was a success, but during the run his health gave way. 

The show transferred to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane shortly after his death, and the first night was dedicated to his memory.

==Personal life==
In the 1980s he was a supporter of the Social Democratic Party. Quilley was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2002 New Year Honours. 

==Death==
Quilley was working on his autobiography in the months before he died in 2003 at his home in London, aged 75, from liver cancer.

<text>Alcione Dias Nazareth (born November 21, 1947) is also known as, &quot;Alcione&quot;, and &quot;A Marrom&quot; (English: &quot;the brown one&quot;) is a Brazilian samba singer. She first gained international recognition in the late 1970 and has had nineteen gold records, as well as five platinum and double platinum records.

In 1987, she dedicated the song &quot;João de Deus&quot; (John of God) to Pope John Paul II and 500,000 people during his second visit to Brazil.

== Biography ==

She was born in São Luís, Maranhão. Her father was a military musician who worked as the conductor of the corps marching band. Alcione was introduced to traditional Brazilian music by her father. At the age of thirteen, she was already performing at college parties. At the same time, she began studying the clarinet and the trumpet.

At age 20, Alcione moved to Rio de Janeiro. There, she worked at the city&#x27;s TV Excelsior and later went on tour in Argentina and Chile for four months. After returning to Brazil, she settled in São Paulo, working in nightclubs and making appearances on television. In 1970, she started her two-year tour in Europe, performing as a vocalist and a trumpet player.

In 1972, when back in Brazil, Alcione recorded her first single. The following year, she traveled to sing in Mexico and, in 1974, Portugal, where she recorded her first full-length album. In 1975, Alcione released her LP, &quot;A Voz do Samba&quot;, which achieved gold sales status and featured several hit tracks. The most successful songs were &quot;Não Deixe o Samba Morrer&quot;, written by Edson and Aloiso, and &quot;O Surdo&quot;, written by Totonho and Paulinho Resende.

In the late 1970s, Alcione became well known as a samba artist and achieved international recognition. She recorded &quot;Alerta Geral&quot; for Philips Records and, in 1978, released this album—the title of which was taken from a television show that Alcione had hosted on TV Globo for two years. Following its success, Alcione continued to release several other full-length albums in late 1970s and early 1980s, including her self-titled album.

In 1997, Alcione signed with Universal Records, subsequently releasing a debut album titled, &quot;Valeu&quot;, through Polygram the next year. This was followed by &quot;Celebração&quot; that same year, and &quot;Claridade---Uma Homenagem A Clara Nunes&quot; in 1999. In December 2002, Alcione was recognized for playing an important part in founding the Paraíso School of Samba in London, England. She also helped organize and prepare the stage for a British version of the &quot;Carnival Brasil, Paraíso dos Orixás&quot; (Brazil, Paradise of the Orishas). Her 2002 album, &quot;Ao Vivo&quot;, received the Best Samba/Pagode Album Award at the fourth Latin Grammy Award ceremony in 2003.

She has had several hits, such as &quot;Não deixe o samba morrer&quot;, &quot;Lá vem você&quot;, &quot;Gostoso veneno&quot;, and &quot;Ilha da maré&quot;.

On July 7, 2007 she performed at the Brazilian leg of Live Earth in Rio de Janeiro.

<doc id="336312" wikidata="Q412382" url="?curid=336312" title="Quinone">
<text>The quinones are a class of organic compounds that are formally &quot;derived from aromatic compounds [such as benzene or naphthalene] by conversion of an even number of –CH= groups into –C(=O)– groups with any necessary rearrangement of double bonds&quot;, resulting in &quot;a fully conjugated cyclic dione structure&quot;.
The archetypical member of the class is 1,4-benzoquinone or cyclohexadienedione, often called simply &quot;quinone&quot; (thus the name of the class). Other important examples are 1,2-benzoquinone (&quot;ortho&quot;-quinone), 1,4-naphthoquinone and 9,10-anthraquinone.

The name is derived from that of quinic acid (with the suffix &quot;-one&quot; indicating a ketone), since it is one of the compounds obtained upon oxidation of quinic acid. Quinic acid, like quinine is obtained from cinchona bark, called in the indigenous languages of Peruvian tribes.

==Properties==
Quinones are oxidized derivatives of aromatic compounds and are often readily made from reactive aromatic compounds with electron-donating substituents such as phenols and catechols, which increase the nucleophilicity of the ring and contributes to the large redox potential needed to break aromaticity. (Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic). Quinones are electrophilic Michael acceptors stabilised by conjugation. Depending on the quinone and the site of reduction, reduction can either rearomatise the compound or break the conjugation. Conjugate addition nearly always breaks the conjugation.

The term quinone is also used more generally for a large class of compounds formally derived from aromatic quinones through replacement of some hydrogen atoms by other atoms or radicals.

== Reactions ==
Quinones form polymers by formation of hydrogen bonds with ρ-hydroquinone.
=== Reduction ===
Quinones are oxidizing agents, sometimes reversibly so. Relative to benzoquinone, more strongly oxidizing quinones include chloranil and 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (also known as DDQ).

The oxidizing power of quinones is enhanced by the presence of acids. In acidic conditions, quinone undergoes two-electron and two-proton reduction to hydroquinone.
In alkaline conditions, quinones undergo a reversible single-step, two-electron reduction. In neutral conditions, quinones may undergo either a one-proton, two-electron reduction or a two-electron reduction.  In aprotic media, quinones undergo two-step reduction without protons. In the first step, a short-lived semiquinone intermediate is formed. In the second step, the semiquinone is reduced into a quinone dianion.

9,10-Anthraquinone-2,7-disulphonic acid (AQDS) a quinone similar to one found naturally in rhubarb has been used as a charge carrier in metal-free flow batteries.

=== Addition ===
Quinones undergo addition reaction to form 1,4-addition products. An example of 1,4-addition reaction is the addition of hydrogen chloride to form chlorohydroquinone:  

Quinones can undergo Diels–Alder reactions. The quinone acts as the dienophile and reacts with a diene at a carbon-carbon double bond.

In Diels–Alder reactions quinones are used as dienophiles. Historically important syntheses include cholesterol, cortisone, morphine, and reserpine.

== Occurrence and uses ==
=== Production of hydrogen peroxide ===

A large scale industrial application of quinones is for the production of hydrogen peroxide. 2-Alkylanthraquinones are hydrogenated to the corresponding hydroquinones (quinizarins), which then transfer to oxygen:

: dihydroanthraquinone + → anthraquinone + 

in this way, several million metric tons of are produced annually.

1,4-Naphthoquinone, derived by oxidation of naphthalene with chromium trioxide. It is the precursor to anthraquinone.

=== Biochemistry ===
Numerous quinones are significant roles in biology. Vitamin K, which is involved in coagulation of blood, is a quinone. Ubiquinone-10 is a naturally occurring 1,4-benzoquinone involved in respiration apparatus. Plastoquinone is a redox relay involved in photosynthesis. Pyrroloquinoline quinone is another biological redox cofactor.

Quinones are conjectured to occur in all respiring organisms. Some serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains such as those in photosynthesis (plastoquinone, phylloquinone), and aerobic respiration (ubiquinone). Phylloquinone is also known as vitamin K1 as it is used by animals to carboxylate certain proteins, which are involved in blood coagulation, bone formation, and other processes. Conversely, the toxicity of paracetamol is due to its metabolism to a quinone imine, which then reacts with liver proteins to cause liver failure.

The auto-oxidation of the neurotransmitter dopamine and its precursor L-Dopa generates the comparatively stable dopamine quinone which inhibits the functioning of dopamine transporter (DAT) and the TH enzyme and leads to low mitochondrial ATP production.

The benzoquinone blattellaquinone is a sex pheromone in cockroaches. In the spray of bombardier beetles, hydroquinone reacts with hydrogen peroxide to produce a fiery blast of steam, a deterrent in the animal world.

=== Medical ===
Several quinones are of pharmacological interest. They form a major class of anticancer cytotoxins. One example is daunorubicin, which is antileukemic. Some of them show anti-tumoral activity. They embody some claims in herbal medicine. These applications include purgative (sennosides), antimicrobial and antiparasitic (rhein and saprorthoquinone, atovaquone), anti-tumor (emodin and juglone), inhibition of PGE2 biosynthesis (arnebinone and arnebifuranone) and anti-cardiovascular disease (tanshinone). Malbranchea cinnamomea is a thermophilic fungus, which produces a quinone antibiotic.

Another quinone-containing drug is Mecarbinate (dimecarbine), made by the reaction of ethyl N-methyl-β-aminocrotonate with para-benzoquinone. Others include Amendol, Oxyphemedol, Phemedol all in FR5142 (M) ― 1967-06-05. Note: These are all indoles made via the Nenitzescu indole synthesis. The antineoplastic Apaziquone.

Benzoquinone compounds are a metabolite of paracetamol.

=== Dyes ===
Many natural and artificial coloring substances (dyes and pigments) are quinone derivatives, for instance lawsone is the active dye compound in henna. They are second only to azo dyes in importance as dyestuffs, with particular emphasis on blue colors. Alizarin (1,2-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone), extracted from the madder plant, was the first natural dye to be synthesized from coal tar.

=== Photography ===
A commercial application of quinones is in black-and-white photography. Black-and-white film is covered with an emulsion containing silver bromide or silver iodide crystals, which exposure to light activates. Hydroquinone is used to reduce the activated silver ions to metallic silver. During this process, hydroquinone is oxidized to quinone. All silver halide not activated by light or reduced by hydroquinone is removed, leaving a negative by deposited silver where the film had been struck by light.

== Nomenclature ==
Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (&quot;benzo-&quot; for benzene, &quot;naphtho-&quot; for naphthalene, &quot;anthra-&quot; for anthracene, etc.) and the &quot;-quinone&quot; suffix. Infix multipliers &quot;-di-&quot;, &quot;-tri-&quot;, &quot;-tetra-&quot; (etc.) are used when there are 4, 6, 8 (etc.) carbonyls. The position of the carbonyl groups can be indicated before the prefix (as in &quot;1,4,5,8-naphthodiquinone&quot;) or after it (&quot;anthra-1,4-quinone&quot;).

== Structural analogues of quinones==
* Quinone methide where one O is replaced by C
* Xylylene where both O&#x27;s are replaced by C&#x27;s
* Quinone imine where one O is replaced by N, illustrated by NAPQI
* Quinone diimine where both O&#x27;s are replaced by N&#x27;s, illustrated by the antiseptic ambazone
* Azaxylylene where both O&#x27;s are replaced by one N and one C, illustrated by various fuchsine dyes like pararosaniline

<doc id="336315" wikidata="Q700853" url="?curid=336315" title="Hessian (soldier)">
<text>Hessians ( or ) were German soldiers who served as auxiliaries to the British Army in several major wars in the 18th century, most notably the American Revolutionary War. The term is a synecdoche for all Germans who fought on the British side, since 65% came from the German states of Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Hanau. Known for their discipline and martial prowess, around 30,000 to 37,000 Hessians fought in the war, comprising approximately 25% of British land forces.

While regarded both contemporaneously and historiographically as mercenaries, Hessians were legally distinguished as auxiliaries: whereas mercenaries served a foreign government on their own accord, auxiliaries were soldiers hired out to a foreign party by their own government, to which they remained in service. Auxiliaries were a major source of income for many small and relatively poor German states, typically serving in wars in which their governments were neutral. Like most auxiliaries of this period, Hessians were attached to foreign armies as entire units, fighting under their own flags, commanded by their usual officers, and wearing their existing uniforms.

Hessians played an essential role in the Revolutionary War, particularly in the northern theater. They served with distinction in many battles, most notably at White Plains and Fort Washington. The added manpower and skill of German troops greatly sustained the British war effort—at some points accounting for up to one-third of British strength—but also outraged colonists and increased support for the Revolutionary cause. The use of &quot;large armies of foreign mercenaries&quot; was one of the 27 colonial grievances against King George III in the Declaration of Independence, and the Patriots cited the deployment of Hessians as proof of British violations of the colonists&#x27; rights.

==History==
The use of foreign soldiers was common in 18th-century Europe. In the two centuries leading up to the American Revolutionary War, the continent saw frequent, though often small-scale, warfare, and military manpower was in high demand. Germany was not yet a unified nation, but a collection of several hundred states loosely organized under the Holy Roman Empire. Conflict between these states led to the creation of professional armies, which were consequently experienced and well trained. Many German societies became militarized, with most men undergoing annual training from adolescence well into adulthood, often serving for life or until they were too old. Several poorer German states came to rely on their troops as an economic resource, especially since sustaining a standing army was costly.

When military conflict broke out, German states provided a ready supply of trained troops prepared to enter military action immediately. The Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel soon emerged as the most prominent source of German soldiers to foreign armies. To field a large professional army with a relatively small population, Hesse-Kassel became the most militarized state in Europe: All Hessian males registered for military service at age seven, and from age 16 until 30 were required to present themselves annually to an official for possible recruitment. Only those whose occupation was considered vital to the country were exempted; those deemed expendable, such as vagrants and the unemployed, could be conscripted at any time. During the 18th century, approximately 5.2% to 14.2% of Hesse-Kassel&#x27;s population were under arms in the 18th century, with one in four households having someone serving in the army—a larger proportion than even heavily militarized Prussia. Whereas Prussia relied partly on mercenaries from other German states, Hesse-Kassel employed only —literally &quot;children of the land&quot;, or native men. 

Hessian military service was notably strict and demanding, emphasizing iron discipline through draconian punishment. Deserters were summarily executed or beaten by an entire company. Morale was generally high, and soldiers were said to take pride in their service. Officers were usually well educated, and unlike most European armies, promoted on the basis of merit. Soldiers were paid relatively high wages, and their families were exempt from certain taxes. Although plunder was officially forbidden, it remained common practice—as in most military forces at the time—offering another incentive for service. Overall, Hessian troops were considered superb fighters, even by their opponents. 

The Hessian military became a major source of economic strength and was the dominant force in society. Hesse-Kassel manufactured its own weapons and uniforms, and its textile industry was so prosperous from supplying the military that workers could afford to buy meat and wine every day. The revenue from renting the army to the British equaled roughly 13 years&#x27; worth of taxes, allowing the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, Friedrich II, to reduce taxes by one-third between the 1760s and 1784. A self-styled enlightened despot, he also oversaw public-works projects, administered a public welfare system, and encouraged education. American historian Edward Jackson Lowell lauded Friedrich II for spending British money wisely, describing him as &quot;one of the least disreputable of the princes who sent mercenaries to America&quot;.

Prior to the American Revolutionary War, Hessian soldiers were familiar in battlefields across 18th century Europe.

In most of these wars, Hesse-Hanau was never formally a belligerent. While its troops remained members of the Hessian military, and even fought in their national uniform, they were hired out for service in other armies, without their government having any stake in the conflict. Thus, Hessians could serve on opposing sides of the same conflict. In the War of the Austrian Succession, both Britain and Bavaria employed Hessian soldiers against one another. In the Seven Years&#x27; War, the forces of Hesse-Kassel served with both the Anglo-Hanoverian and the Prussian armies against the French; although Hesse-Kassel was technically allied to Britain and Prussia, her troops were actually leased by the British. 

Notwithstanding its formal neutrality in many of these conflicts, the practice of lending out auxiliaries did sometimes draw Hesse-Kassel into war. In July 1758, during the course of the Seven Years&#x27; War, most of the country, including its capital of Cassel, was occupied by a French army under Charles de Rohan, Prince of Soubise, which easily overcame the home defence force of 6,000 Hessian militiamen. Soubise ordered his troops to live off the land, take high-ranking hostages, and extort payments of cash and produce, with the intention of forcing Hessian troops to withdraw from the war. Hessian and allied forces attempted to liberate their homeland but were repulsed at the Battle of Sandershausen on 23 July. Following two sieges in 1761 and 1762, Cassel was retaken, which constituted the last military action of the war.

===&quot;Mercenaries&quot; versus &quot;auxiliaries&quot;===
The characterization of Hessian troops as &quot;mercenaries&quot; remains controversial. American history textbooks refer to them as &quot;mercenaries&quot;, and they are still widely perceived as such in the popular imagination of the United States. American historian Charles Ingrao describes Hesse as a &quot;mercenary state&quot; whose prince rented out his regiments to fund his governmental expenditures. By contrast, British historian Stephen Conway referred to them as &quot;auxiliaries&quot;. Military historians Dennis Showalter and Rodney Atwood note that Hessians would not have been legally considered mercenaries at the time, but rather auxiliaries. Whereas mercenaries served a foreign ruler in an individual capacity, auxiliaries forces were controlled by a state, and their foreign service was in direct competition to professional mercenaries. Similarly, in the twentieth century, the Moroccan Goumiers were attached as auxiliaries to the French Army of Africa.

Hessians would not be categorized as mercenaries under modern international law. Protocol I (1977) to the Geneva Convention defines a mercenary as &quot;any person who ... has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.&quot; Hessian troops served in America on official duty from the armed forces of Hesse-Cassel and Hesse-Hanau. Protocol I also requires a mercenary to be &quot;promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party.&quot; While not formally incorporated into the British military, Hessian troops were paid the same wages as British soldiers.

===American Revolutionary War===

Great Britain maintained a relatively small standing army, so it found itself in great need of troops at the outset of the American Revolutionary War. Several German princes saw an opportunity to earn extra income by hiring out their regular army units for service in America. Their troops entered the British service not as individuals, but in entire units, with their usual uniforms, flags, equipment, and officers. Methods of recruitment varied according to the state of origin. The contingent from Waldeck was drawn from an army based on universal conscription, from which only students were exempt. Other German princes relied on long-service voluntary enlistment supplemented by conscription when numbers fell short. Many princes were closely related to the British House of Hanover and were comfortable placing their troops under British command.

A total of 29,875 German troops fought alongside British troops in the Revolutionary War, of which 16,992 came from Hesse-Kassel and 2,422 from Hesse-Hanau. Other contingents came from Brunswick (4,300), Ansbach-Bayreuth (2,353), Anhalt-Zerbst (1,119), and Waldeck (1,225). As the majority of the German troops came from Hesse, Americans use the term &quot;Hessians&quot; to refer to all German troops fighting on the British side.

====Deployment====

Hessian troops included &quot;Jägers&quot;, hussars, three artillery companies, and four battalions of grenadiers. Most infantrymen were &quot;chasseurs&quot;, including sharpshooters, musketeers, and fusiliers. Line infantry was armed with muskets, while the Hessian artillery used the three-pound cannon. The elite &quot;Jäger&quot; battalions used the &quot;Büchse&quot;, a short, large-caliber rifle well-suited to woodland combat. Initially, the typical regiment was made up of 500 to 600 men. Later in the war, due to death in battle, death by disease, and general desertion to settle in the Colonies, the regiments may have been reduced to only around 300 to 400 men.

The first Hessian troops to arrive in British America landed at Staten Island on August 15, 1776, and their first engagement was less than two weeks later in the Battle of Long Island. Hessians proved decisive to the British victory, and they subsequently fought in almost every battle that year.

By 1777, the British used them mainly as garrison and patrol troops. Hessians fought at the Battle of Bennington, the turning point of the Saratoga campaign. At Saratoga, approximately 1,000 Hessians were defeated; being killed or captured by a raw, untrained militia force from Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. General John Burgoyne lost 1,000 of his 8,000 soldiers at Bennington, and the loss of so many Hessians doomed his army later. An assortment of Hessians fought in the battles and campaigns in the southern states during 1778–1780, including at the Guilford Court House, and two regiments fought at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781. Hessians also served in Nova Scotia for five years (1778–1783), where they protected the colony from American privateers, such as during the 1782 Raid on Lunenburg.

Notwithstanding their reputation as skilled and disciplined fighters, many British soldiers shared the American distrust of Hessians, who often spoke little or no English and were perceived as crude and barbaric.

Numerous other incidents strained the relationship between the British and Hessians. In August 1779, Saxon nobleman Johann Philip von Krafft wrote that a group of &quot;English soldiers&quot; attacked and robbed a Hessian grenadier, fatally wounding him in the process; historian Steven Schwamenfeld noted that these soldiers were most likely members of the Volunteers of Ireland, a Loyalist military unit mostly consisting of deserters from the Continental Army. Another incident occurred on August 20, 1780, between British soldiers from the 54th Regiment of Foot and Hessian troops from the Anhalt-Zerbst Regiment. The 54th Regiment of Foot, which had cultivated several vegetable gardens, were relieved by the Hessians, who refused British demands to pay for the privilege of harvesting crops they had sown. In response, a number of British soldiers began pulling up the vegetables and carrying them off, which led to a skirmish breaking out before British and Hessian officers broke it up.

===American attitudes===

Americans, both Revolutionaries and Loyalists, often feared the Hessians, believing them to be rapacious and brutal mercenaries. The American Declaration of Independence, written roughly a year after hostilities broke out, condemned King George III for &quot;transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to [complete] the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.&quot; Throughout the war, reports of plundering by Hessians were said to have galvanized neutral colonists to join the Revolutionary side.

General Washington&#x27;s Continental Army had crossed the Delaware River to make a surprise attack on the Hessians in the early morning of December 26, 1776. In the Battle of Trenton, the Hessian force of 1,400 was quickly overwhelmed by the Continentals, with only about 20 killed and 100 wounded, but 1,000 captured.

Hessians captured in the Battle of Trenton were paraded through the streets of Philadelphia to raise American morale; anger at their presence helped the Continental Army recruit new soldiers. Most of the prisoners were sent to work as farmhands.

By early 1778, negotiations for the exchange of prisoners between Washington and the British had begun in earnest. These included Nicholas Bahner(t), Jacob Trobe, George Geisler, and Conrad Grein (Konrad Krain), who were a few of the Hessian soldiers who deserted the British forces after being returned in exchange for American prisoners of war. These men were both hunted by the British for being deserters and by many of the colonists as a foreign enemy.

Throughout the Revolutionary War, Americans tried to entice Hessians to desert the British, emphasizing the large and prosperous German-American community in the Colonies. The Continental Congress authorized the offer of land of up to 50 acres (roughly 20 hectares) to individual Hessian soldiers who switched sides. British soldiers were offered 50 to 800 acres, depending on rank.

Many Hessian prisoners were held in camps at the interior city of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, home to a large German community known as the Pennsylvania Dutch. German prisoners were treated well, with some volunteering for extra work assignments, helping to replace local men serving in the Continental Army. After the Revolutionary War, many Hessian prisoners of war never returned to Germany and instead chose to accept American offers of religious freedom and free land, becoming permanent settlers. By contrast, British prisoners were also held in Lancaster, but these men did not respond favorably to good treatment and often tried to escape.

After the war ended in 1783, some 17,313 German soldiers returned to their homelands. Of the 12,526 who did not return, about 7,700 were killed in action or died; some 1,200 were killed in action, and 6,354 died from illnesses or accidents, mostly the former. About 5,000 German troops, most of whom had been press-ganged or conscripted in their countries of origin, opted to settle in either the United States or Canada.
