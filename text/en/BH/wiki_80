<text>BellSouth, LLC (stylized as &quot;BELLSOUTH&quot; and formerly known as BellSouth Corporation) was an American telecommunications holding company based in Atlanta, Georgia. BellSouth was one of the seven original Regional Bell Operating Companies after the U.S. Department of Justice forced the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company to divest itself of its regional telephone companies on January 1, 1984.

In a merger announced on March 5, 2006, and executed on December 29, 2006, AT&amp;T Inc. (originally SBC Communications) acquired BellSouth for approximately $86 billion (1.325 shares of AT&amp;T for each share of BellSouth). The merger also consolidated ownership of Cingular Wireless and Yellowpages.com, both of which were joint ventures between BellSouth and AT&amp;T. With the merger completed, wireless services previously offered by Cingular Wireless were then offered under the AT&amp;T name, and BellSouth Telecommunications (a subsidiary of a Bell Operating Company) began doing business as AT&amp;T Southeast.

BellSouth was the last of the Regional Bell Operating Companies to keep its original corporate name after the 1984 AT&amp;T breakup, as well as the last one to retain the Bell logo as part of its main corporate identity.

BellSouth also operated in Latin America in Argentina, Australia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. BellSouth operated in New Zealand under the name of BellSouth New Zealand Limited from 1993 until 1998 when it was acquired by Vodafone to become Vodafone New Zealand. It competed against Telecom New Zealand. Its operations in Australia were under the name of BellSouth Australia Pty Limited. All of Bellsouth&#x27;s operations in Latin America were acquired by Telefonica in late 2004 for nearly $5.85 billion, and became Movistar.

==Organization and services==
As part of the breakup of the old AT&amp;T during 1984, BellSouth was formed as the holding company for the telephone operating companies in the southern portion of the old Bell System—Atlanta-based Southern Bell and Birmingham, Alabama-based South Central Bell. The creation of BellSouth, in effect, reunited most telephone service in the Southeastern United States. Southern Bell had been the Bell System operating company for the entire Southeast until 1967, when the western portion of its service territory became South Central Bell.

BellSouth formed a shared services company, BellSouth Services, to provide centralized functions such as engineering and information technology to Southern Bell and South Central Bell. Services provided in the BellSouth operating area include telephone and DSL/Dial-Up Internet services in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Satellite television service was provided as a partnership with DirecTV. Cable television (often via MMDS) was provided in limited markets as BellSouth Entertainment (as part of the Americast venture).

In 1992, BellSouth merged South Central Bell and BellSouth Services into Southern Bell, which changed its name to BellSouth Telecommunications. This created a single operating company in the BellSouth territory, and fully reunited Southern Bell and South Central Bell. However, BellSouth continued using the Southern Bell name in the eastern portion of its territory and the South Central Bell name in the western portion until 1998, when it adopted BellSouth as the sole customer-facing brand.

The company maintained its largest operation centers in Atlanta and Birmingham. Region-wide headquarters operations were also primarily in Atlanta and Birmingham. Statewide operations centers were located in Birmingham, Miami, Atlanta, Louisville, New Orleans, Jackson, Charlotte, Columbia, and Nashville. BellSouth Mobility was based in Atlanta, Georgia and Birmingham, Alabama.

In August 1998, BellSouth launched FastAccess DSL, their broadband service provided through a DSL connection, initially launched in the Atlanta, Birmingham, Charlotte, Miami/Ft. Lauderdale, Jacksonville, New Orleans and Raleigh/Durham areas. Eventually, it became available in all of BellSouth&#x27;s service area.

Toward its end, BellSouth realigned itself in two important areas, wireless and broadband. In 2001, they merged BellSouth Mobility, their wireless enterprise, with SBC&#x27;s wireless services, and took a 40% stake in the resulting company, Cingular Wireless. The new company provided a large percentage of BellSouth&#x27;s revenue. This joint venture continued after SBC purchased the old AT&amp;T and rebranded as AT&amp;T Inc. Continued increase of broadband penetration and applications in the consumer market was a key strategy to the company. These activities were being funded in part by the sale of Latin America operations.

BellSouth became the first &quot;Baby Bell&quot; that did not operate pay telephones. By 2003, BellSouth&#x27;s payphone operation was discontinued because it had become too unprofitable, most likely due to the increased availability of cell phones. Cincinnati Bell has taken BellSouth&#x27;s place for payphones in northern BellSouth territory; independents have set in further south. 

BellSouth&#x27;s main operating units at its end were the Communications Group, Domestic Wireless, and Advertising and Publishing. The communications group operated two wholly-owned subsidiaries, BellSouth Telecommunications Inc. (BST) and BellSouth Long Distance, Inc. (BSLD). The main marketing groups for the communications group were consumer, small business, large business, and interconnection (wholesale services). The communications group provided wireline communications services, including local exchange, network access, intraLATA long-distance services, and Internet services, as well as long-distance services.

The advertising and publishing group was responsible for printing and distributing telephone books, selling advertising, and operating online electronic directories.

The BellSouth – SBC/AT&amp;T relationship went further than just Cingular Wireless. BellSouth &amp; SBC/AT&amp;T also co-owned yellowpages.com (formerly RealPages.com and SmartPages.com).

BellSouth licensed its trademark to US Electronics, which produced telephones under the BellSouth brand. It also previously maintained a history page at bellsouth.com/servicemarks, which displayed its former and recent BellSouth logo usage.


===BellSouth stops displaying caller ID from Sprint customers===
As of January 1, 2006, BellSouth customers no longer receive caller ID information from Sprint PCS customers. Any incoming call originating from a Sprint PCS cell phone will usually display the City, State format on the caller ID display instead of the name or business name associated with that number. Based on a 1996 agreement between Sprint and BellSouth, it is likely that this is a result of a ten-year contract. In 2003, Sprint sued BellSouth for $20 million as a result of Sprint claiming Bellsouth violated a 1996 contract by not providing Sprint caller-identification information to BellSouth customers.

Similar caller ID &quot;deals&quot; have been left to the consumer to fight either with their own carrier or through government regulatory commissions for what they should have displayed on their caller ID device. In 2002, Sprint and SBC Communications could not come to an agreement on fees charged to carriers to look up the caller name information.

==Alleged NSA cooperation==
In 2006, &quot;USA Today&quot; published an article which erroneously claimed that three of the largest United States carriers, including BellSouth, had been supplying calling records to the National Security Agency for all international and domestic calls. This data, the article claimed, is being used to create, &quot;the largest database ever assembled.&quot;

On May 16, 2006, BellSouth released a retraction claiming that no contract with the NSA existed and that they had never provided information such as calling records to the NSA.

&quot;USA Today&quot; posted an update on June 30, 2006, stating that:

&quot;On May 15, BellSouth said it could not categorically deny participation in the program until it had conducted a detailed investigation. BellSouth said that internal review concluded that the company did not contract with the NSA or turn over calling records.&quot;

<doc id="335390" wikidata="Q170071" url="?curid=335390" title="Josef Albers">
<text>Josef Albers ( , , ; March 19, 1888March 25, 1976) was a German-born American artist and educator who is considered one of the most influential 20th-century art teachers in the United States. Born in 1888 in Bottrop, Westphalia, Germany, into a Roman Catholic family with a background in craftsmanship, Albers received practical training in diverse skills like engraving glass, plumbing, and wiring during his childhood. He later worked as a schoolteacher from 1908 to 1913 and received his first public commission in 1918 and moved to Munich in 1919. 

In 1920, Albers joined the Weimar Bauhaus as a student and became a faculty member in 1922, teaching the principles of handicrafts. With the Bauhaus&#x27;s move to Dessau in 1925, he was promoted to professor and married Anni Albers, a student at the institution and a textile artist. Albers&#x27; work in Dessau included designing furniture and working with glass, collaborating with established artists like Paul Klee. Following the Bauhaus&#x27;s closure under Nazi orders in 1933, Albers emigrated to the United States. He was appointed as the head of the painting program at the experimental liberal arts institution Black Mountain College in North Carolina, a position he held until 1949. 

At Black Mountain, Albers taught students who would later go on to become prominent artists such as Ruth Asawa and Robert Rauschenberg, and invited contemporary American artists to teach in the summer seminar, including the choreographer Merce Cunningham and Harlem Renaissance painter Jacob Lawrence. In 1950, he left for Yale University to head the design department, contributing significantly to its graphic design program. Albers&#x27; teaching methodology, prioritizing practical experience and vision in design, had a profound impact on the development of postwar Western visual art, while his book &quot;Interaction of Color&quot;, published in 1963, is considered a seminal work on color theory. 

In addition to being a teacher, Albers was an active abstract painter and theorist, best known for his series &quot;Homage to the Square&quot;, in which he explored chromatic interactions with nested squares, meticulously recording the colors used. He also created murals, such as those for the Corning Glass Building and the Time &amp; Life Building in New York City. In 1970, he and his wife lived in Orange, Connecticut, where they continued to work in their private studio. In 1971, Albers was first living artist to be given a solo show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Albers died in his sleep on March 25, 1976, at the Yale New Haven Hospital after being admitted for a possible heart ailment.

==Biography==
=== German years ===
==== Formative years in Westphalia ====
Albers was born into a Roman Catholic family of craftsmen in Bottrop, Westphalia, Germany, in 1888. His father, Lorenzo Albers, was variously a housepainter, carpenter, and handyman. His mother came from a family of blacksmiths. His childhood included practical training in engraving glass, plumbing, and wiring, giving Josef versatility and lifelong confidence in the handling and manipulation of diverse materials. He worked from 1908 to 1913 as a schoolteacher in his home town; he also trained as an art teacher at Königliche Kunstschule in Berlin, Germany, from 1913 to 1915. From 1916 to 1919 he began his work as a printmaker at the Kunstgewerbschule in Essen, where he learnt stained-glass making with Dutch artist Johan Thorn Prikker. In 1918 he received his first public commission, &quot;Rosa mystica ora pro nobis&quot;, a stained-glass window for a church in Bottrop. In 1919 he moved to Munich, Germany, to study at the Königliche Bayerische Akademie der Bildenden Kunst, where he was a pupil of Max Doerner and Franz Stuck.

==== Entry into the Bauhaus====

Albers enrolled as a student in the preliminary course (&quot;vorkurs&quot;) of Johannes Itten at the Weimar Bauhaus in 1920. Although Albers had studied painting, it was as a maker of stained glass that he joined the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1922, approaching his chosen medium as a component of architecture and as a stand-alone art form. The director and founder of the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius, asked him in 1923 to teach in the preliminary course &#x27;Werklehre&#x27; of the department of design to introduce newcomers to the principles of handicrafts, because Albers came from that background and had appropriate practice and knowledge.

In 1925, the year the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, Albers was promoted to professor. At this time, he married Anni Albers (&quot;née&quot; Fleischmann) who was a student at the institution. His work in Dessau included designing furniture and working with glass. As a younger instructor, he was teaching at the Bauhaus among established artists who included Oskar Schlemmer, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee. The so-called &quot;form master&quot; Klee taught the formal aspects in the glass workshops where Albers was the &quot;crafts master&quot;; they cooperated for several years.

===Emigration to the United States===
====Black Mountain College====
With the closure of the Bauhaus under Nazi pressure in 1933 the artists dispersed, most leaving the country. Albers emigrated to the United States. The architect Philip Johnson, then a curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, arranged for Albers to be offered a job as head of a new art school, Black Mountain College, in North Carolina. In November 1933, he joined the faculty of the college where he was the head of the painting program until 1949.

At Black Mountain, his students included Ruth Asawa, Ray Johnson, Robert Rauschenberg, Cy Twombly, and Susan Weil. He also invited important American artists such as Willem de Kooning, to teach in the summer seminar. Weil remarked that, as a teacher, Albers was &quot;his own academy&quot;. She said that Albers claimed that &quot;when you&#x27;re in school, you&#x27;re not an artist, you&#x27;re a student&quot;, although he was very supportive of self-expression when one became an artist and began on her or his journey. Albers produced many woodcuts and leaf studies at this time.

====Yale University====
In 1950, Albers left Black Mountain to head the department of design at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. While at Yale, Albers worked to expand the nascent graphic design program (then called &quot;graphic arts&quot;), hiring designers Alvin Eisenman, Herbert Matter, and Alvin Lustig. Albers worked at Yale until he retired from teaching in 1958. At Yale, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Eva Hesse, Neil Welliver, and Jane Davis Doggett were notable students.

In 1962, as a fellow at Yale, he received a grant from the Graham Foundation for the Advanced Studies of Fine Arts for an exhibit and lecture on his work. Albers also collaborated with Yale professor and architect King-lui Wu in creating decorative designs for some of Wu&#x27;s projects. Among these were distinctive geometric fireplaces for the Rouse (1954) and DuPont (1959) houses, the façade of Manuscript Society, one of Yale&#x27;s secret senior groups (1962), and a design for the Mt. Bethel Baptist Church (1973). Also, at this time he worked on his structural constellation pieces.

Also during this time, he created the abstract album covers of band leader Enoch Light&#x27;s Command LP records. His album cover for Terry Snyder and the All Stars 1959 album, &quot;Persuasive Percussion&quot;, shows a tightly packed grid or lattice of small black disks from which a few wander up and out as if stray molecules of some light gas. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1973. In 1970, Albers and his wife moved to Orange, Connecticut, where they continued to work in their private studio. Albers died in his sleep on March 25, 1976, at the Yale New Haven Hospital after being admitted for a possible heart ailment.

====Command Records====
Josef Albers produced album covers for over three years between 1959 and 1961, Albers&#x27; seven album sleeves for Command Records incorporated elements such as circles and grids of dots, highly uncommon in his practice. &quot;The series of records made by Command Records over half a century ago still resonate with audiophiles today, and are much sought-after by connoisseurs of mid-century modern design for their striking covers. This was all due to the collaboration between two individuals, Josef Albers and Enoch Light. Both men — one an influential teacher and artist, the other a stereo-recording pioneer — driven by strong convictions and passion for their respective crafts.&quot;

==Works==

===&quot;Homage to the Square&quot;===
Accomplished as a designer, photographer, typographer, printmaker, and poet, Albers is best remembered for his work as an abstract painter and theorist. He favored a very disciplined approach to composition, especially in the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series &quot;Homage to the Square&quot;. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with nested squares. Usually painting on Masonite, he used a palette knife with oil colors and often recorded the colors he used on the back of his works. Each painting consists of either three or four squares of solid planes of color nested within one another, in one of four different arrangements and in square formats ranging from 406×406 mm to 1.22×1.22 m.

===Murals===
In 1959, a gold-leaf mural by Albers, &quot;Two Structural Constellations&quot; was engraved in the lobby of the Corning Glass Building in Manhattan. For the entrance of the Time &amp; Life Building lobby, he created &quot;Two Portals&quot; (1961), a 42-feet by 14-feet mural of alternating glass bands in white and brown that recede into two bronze centers to create an illusion of depth. In the 1960s, Walter Gropius, who was designing the Pan Am Building with Emery Roth &amp; Sons and Pietro Belluschi, commissioned Albers to make a mural. The artist reworked &quot;City&quot;, a sandblasted glass construction that he had designed in 1929 at the Bauhaus, and renamed it &quot;Manhattan&quot;. The giant abstract mural of black, white, and red strips arranged in interwoven columns stood 28-feet high and 55-feet wide and was installed in the lobby of the building; it was removed during a lobby redesign around 2000. Before he died in 1976, Albers left exact specifications of the work so that it could easily be replicated; in 2019, it was replicated and reinstalled in its original place in the Pan Am building, now renamed MetLife. In 1967, his painted mural &quot;Growth&quot; (1965) as well as &quot;Loggia Wall&quot; (1965), a brick relief, were installed on the campus of the Rochester Institute of Technology. Other architectural works include &quot;Gemini&quot; (1972), a stainless steel relief for the Grand Avenue National Bank lobby in Kansas City, Missouri, and &quot;Reclining Figure&quot; (1972), a mosaic mural for the Celanese Building in Manhattan destroyed in 1980. At the invitation of a former student, the Australian architect Harry Seidler, Albers designed the mural &quot;Wrestling&quot; (1976) for the Mutual Life Centre in Sydney.

==Color theory==
In 1963, Albers published &quot;Interaction of Color&quot;, which is a record of an experiential way of studying and teaching color. He asserted that color &quot;is almost never seen as it really is&quot; and that &quot;color deceives continually&quot;, and he suggested that color is best studied via experience, underpinned by experimentation and observation. The very rare first edition has a limited printing of only 2,000 copies and contained 150 silk screen plates. This work has since been republished, and is now available as an iPad App.
Albers presented color systems at the end of his courses (and at the end of &#x27;Interaction of Color&#x27;) and these featured descriptions of primary, secondary and tertiary color, as well as a range of connotations that he assigned to specific colors on his triangular color model.

In respect to his artworks, Albers was known to meticulously list the specific manufacturer&#x27;s colours and varnishes he used on the back of his works, as if the colours were catalogued components of an optical experiment. His work represents a transition between traditional European art and the new American art. It incorporated European influences from the Constructivists and the Bauhaus movement, and its intensity and smallness of scale were typically European, but his influence fell heavily on American artists of the late 1950s and the 1960s. &quot;Hard-edge&quot; abstract painters drew on his use of patterns and intense colors, while Op artists and conceptual artists further explored his interest in perception.

In an article about the artist, published in 1950, Elaine de Kooning concluded that however impersonal his paintings might at first appear, not one of them &quot;could have been painted by any one but Josef Albers himself&quot;.

==Teaching and influence==
Although Albers prioritized teaching his students principles of color interaction, he was admired by many of his students for instilling a general approach to all materials and means of engaging it in design. Albers &quot;put practice before theory and prioritised experience; &#x27;what counts,&#x27; he claimed &#x27;is not so-called knowledge of so-called facts, but vision – seeing.&#x27; His focus was process.&quot; Although their relationship was often tense, and sometimes, even combative, Robert Rauschenberg later identified Albers as his most important teacher. Albers is considered to be one of the most influential teachers of visual art in the twentieth century.

==Quotes of the artist==
: – &quot;Every perception of colour is an illusion.. ..we do not see colors as they really are. In our perception they alter one another.&quot; [c. 1949, when Albers started his first &quot;Homage to the Square&quot; paintings]
: – &quot;THE ORIGIN OF ART: The discrepancy between physical fact and psychic effect. THE CONTENT OF ART: Visual information of our reaction to life. THE MEASURE OF ART: The ratio of effort to effect. THE AIM OF ART: Revelation and evocation of vision.&quot; [1964, from his text &quot;Homage to the square&quot;]
: – &quot;For me, abstraction is real, probably more real than nature. I&#x27;ll go further and say that abstraction is nearer my heart. I prefer to see with closed eyes.&quot; [1966]
: – &quot;Art is not to be looked at. Art is looking at us.. .To be able to perceive it we need to be receptive. Therefore art is there where art meets us now. The content of art is visual formulation of our relation to life. The measure of art, the ratio of effort to effect, the aim of art revelation and evocation of vision. [1968, in oral history interview with Josef Albers]
: – &quot;I made true the first English sentence [Albers came from Germany] that I uttered (better stuttered) on our arrival at Black Mountain College in November 1933. When a student asked me what I was going to teach I said: &#x27;to open eyes&#x27;. And this has become the motto of all my teaching.&quot; [1970, in &#x27;A conversation with Josef Albers&#x27;]

==Legacy==

The Josef Albers papers, documents from 1929 to 1970, were donated by the artist to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Archives of American Art in 1969 and 1970. In 1971 (nearly five years before his death), Albers founded the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, a nonprofit organization he hoped would further &quot;the revelation and evocation of vision through art&quot;. Today, this organization serves as the office for the estates of both Josef Albers and his wife Anni Albers, and supports exhibitions and publications focused on the works of both artists. The foundation building is located in Bethany, Connecticut, and &quot;includes a central research and archival storage center to accommodate the Foundation&#x27;s art collections, library and archives, and offices, as well as residence studios for visiting artists.&quot; A second, and substantial, part of the Josef Albers estate is held by the Josef Albers Museum in Bottrop, Germany, where he was born. Both institutions continue active outreach to secure the artist&#x27;s reputation.

The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation offers three residency programs in three different parts of the world. They are located in Bethany, Connecticut; Carraig-na-gCat, Ireland; and Thread, Senegal. Residencies usually last between one and two months.

In 2019, his &quot;colossal&quot; mural, &quot;Manhattan&quot;, was reinstalled at the Walter Gropius-designed 200 Park Avenue (Metlife) Building, New York, following an almost two decade absence. &quot;While we appreciate its importance in the art community, it just doesn&#x27;t work for us anymore,&quot; a Metlife representative is quoted as saying, at the time of its removal (2000). Two decades later, the piece is once again being hailed as the vibrant centerpiece of the building, with the Albers Foundation&#x27;s director on hand for the rededication of the work: &quot;This is what art was for him: something that could affect you, maybe gave a little bit of joy to the lives of those people rushing to their trains or rushing out of the station to their workday.&quot;

==Criticism==
Josef Albers&#x27; book &quot;Interaction of Color&quot; continues to be influential despite criticisms that arose following his death. In 1981, Alan Lee attempted to refute Albers&#x27; general claims about colour experience (that colour deceives continually) and to posit that Albers&#x27; system of perceptual education was fundamentally misleading.

Lee examined four topics in Albers&#x27; account of colour critically: In additive and subtractive colour mixture; the tonal relations of colours; the Weber-Fechner Law; and simultaneous contrast. In each case Lee suggested that Albers made fundamental errors with serious consequences for his claims about colour and his pedagogical method. Lee suggested that Albers&#x27; belief in the importance of colour deception was related to a misconception about aesthetic appreciation (that it depends upon some kind of confusion about visual perception). Lee suggested that the scientific colour hypothesis of Edwin H. Land should be considered in lieu of the concepts put forward by Albers. Finally, Lee called for a reassessment of Albers&#x27; art as necessary, following successful challenge to the foundational colour concepts that were the basis of his corpus.

Dorothea Jameson has challenged Lee&#x27;s criticism of Albers, arguing that Albers&#x27; approach toward painting and pedagogy emphasized artists&#x27; experiences in the handling and mixing of pigments, which often have different results than predicted by color theory experiments with projected light or spinning color disks. Furthermore, Jameson explains that Lee&#x27;s own understanding of additive and subtractive color mixtures is flawed.

== Value on the art market ==
Several paintings in Albers&#x27;s series &quot;Homage to the Square&quot; have outsold their estimates, including &quot;Homage to the Square: Joy&quot; (1964) which sold for $1.5 million (nearly double its estimate) at a 2007 sale at Sotheby&#x27;s. In 2015, &quot;Study for Homage to the Square, R-III E.B.&quot; (1970) sold for £785,000 (well above the estimated £350,000–450,000), at &quot;the high point of an active market.&quot;

Albers, a prolific artist, has numerous prints and drawings available outside of the museums where his work is represented.

The Albers Foundation, the main beneficiary of the estates of both Josef and Anni Albers, remains protective of the artist&#x27;s work and reputation. In 1997, one year after the auction house, Sotheby&#x27;s, bought the Andre Emmerich Gallery, the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation did not renew its three-year contract with the gallery. The Foundation has also been instrumental in exposing fakes.

<doc id="335391" wikidata="Q1060827" url="?curid=335391" title="Kikuchi disease">
<text>Kikuchi disease was described in 1972 in Japan. It is also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, Kikuchi necrotizing lymphadenitis, phagocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, subacute necrotizing lymphadenitis, and necrotizing lymphadenitis. Kikuchi disease occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition.

It was first described by Dr Masahiro Kikuchi (1935–2012) in 1972 and independently by Y. Fujimoto.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of Kikuchi disease are fever, enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), skin rashes, and headache. In sixty to ninety percent of cases, lymphadenopathy presents in the posterior cervical lymph nodes with diameter enlargement typically being between one and two centimeters, but up to seven centimeters has been reported in literature. Occasionally, the supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes become swollen as well. Rarely, enlargement of the liver and spleen and nervous system involvement resembling meningitis are seen. Often a bout of extreme fatigue can occur - often taking hold during latter parts of the day and the affected person can be more prone to fatigue from exercise.

==Pathophysiology==
Some studies have suggested a genetic predisposition to the proposed autoimmune response. Several infectious candidates have been associated with Kikuchi disease.

Many theories exist about the cause of KFD. Microbial/viral or autoimmune causes have been suggested. &quot;Mycobacterium szulgai&quot; and &quot;Yersinia&quot; and &quot;Toxoplasma&quot; species have been implicated. More recently, growing evidence suggests a role for Epstein-Barr virus, as well as other viruses (HHV6, HHV8, parvovirus B19, HIV and HTLV-1) in the pathogenesis of KFD. However, many independent studies have failed to identify the presence of these infectious agents in cases of Kikuchi lymphadenopathy. In addition, serologic tests including antibodies to a host of viruses have consistently proven noncontributory and no viral particles have been identified ultrastructurally.
KFD is now proposed to be a nonspecific hyperimmune reaction to a variety of infectious, chemical, physical, and neoplastic agents. Other autoimmune conditions and manifestations such as antiphospholipid syndrome, polymyositis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, bilateral uveitis, arthritis and cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis have been linked to KFD. KFD may represent an exuberant T-cell-mediated immune response in a genetically susceptible individual to a variety of nonspecific stimuli.

Certain Human leukocyte antigen class II genes appear more frequently in patients with Kikuchi disease, suggesting that there may be a genetic predisposition to the proposed autoimmune response.

==Diagnosis==
It is diagnosed by lymph node excision biopsy. Kikuchi disease is a self-limiting illness which has symptoms which may overlap with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma leading to misdiagnosis in some patients. Antinuclear antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-dsDNA, and rheumatoid factor are usually negative, and may help in differentiation from systemic lupus erythematosus.

===Differential diagnosis===
The differential diagnosis of Kikuchi disease includes systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), disseminated tuberculosis, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, and viral lymphadenitis. Clinical findings sometimes may include positive results for IgM/IgG/IgA antibodies. For other causes of lymph node enlargement, see lymphadenopathy.

==Management==
No specific cure is known. Treatment is largely supportive. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are indicated for tender lymph nodes and fever, and corticosteroids are useful in severe extranodal or generalized disease.

Symptomatic measures aimed at relieving the distressing local and systemic complaints have been described as the main line of management of KFD. Analgesics, antipyretics, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids have been used. If the clinical course is more severe, with multiple flares of bulky enlarged cervical lymph nodes and fever, then a low-dose corticosteroid treatment has been suggested.

==Epidemiology==

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare, self-limiting disorder that typically affects the cervical lymph nodes. Recognition of this condition is crucial, especially because it can easily be mistaken for tuberculosis, lymphoma, or even adenocarcinoma. Awareness of this disorder helps prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.

Kikuchi&#x27;s disease is a very rare disease mainly seen in Japan. Isolated cases are reported in North America, Europe, Asia, England, and at least two cases in New Zealand. It is possible that the prevalence of KFD is greater than is reported given lymphadenopathy can be overlooked and the disease&#x27;s self-limiting nature. That a definite identification of KFD can only be done via a biopsy of affected tissues further suggests that cases go unrecognized or undiagnosed. It is mainly a disease of young adults (20–30 years), with a slight bias towards females. The cause of this disease is not known, although infectious and autoimmune causes have been proposed. The course of the disease is generally benign and self-limiting. Lymph node enlargement usually resolves over several weeks to six months. The recurrence rate is about 3%. Death from Kikuchi disease is extremely rare and usually occurs due to liver, respiratory, or heart failure.

<doc id="335393" wikidata="Q45991" url="?curid=335393" title="Wigger">
<text>Wigger, also wigga, whigger and whigga, is a term for a white person of European ethnic origin who emulates the perceived mannerisms, language, and fashions that are generally stereotypically reserved for African-American culture, particularly hip hop culture. The word is a shorthand variation of &quot;white nigger&quot;.

&quot;Dictionary.com&quot; defines the term as a slang derogatory reference to &quot;a white youth who adopts black youth culture by adopting its speech, wearing its clothes, and listening to its music.&quot; Another dictionary defines the term as &quot;offensive slang&quot; referring to a &quot;white person, usually a teenager or young adult who adopts the fashions, the tastes, and often the mannerisms considered typical of urban black youth.&quot;

The term is generally considered a derogatory term reflecting stereotypes of African-American, black British, and white culture (when used as a synonym of white trash). The &quot;&quot; connotation may be used pejoratively.

==Phenomenon==

The phenomenon of white people adopting stereotypical black mannerisms, speech, music taste, and apparel has appeared in several generations since slavery was abolished in the Western world. The concept has been documented in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and other countries with a significant white population. An early form of this was the &quot;white negro&quot; in the jazz and swing music scenes of the 1920s and 1930s; as examined in the 1957 Norman Mailer essay &quot;The White Negro&quot;. It was later seen in the zoot suiter of the 1930s and 1940s, the hipster of the 1940s, the beatnik of the 1950s–1960s, the fascination with Jamaican ska and rude boy culture in Britain&#x27;s 1960s mod subculture, the blue-eyed soul of the 1970s (soul music sung by white singers), and the hip hop done by white rappers in the 1980s and 1990s.

Bakari Kitwana, &quot;a culture critic who&#x27;s been tracking American hip hop for years&quot;, has written &quot;Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wankstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America&quot;. In 1993, an article in the UK newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; described the phenomenon of white, middle-class children who were &quot;wannabe blacks&quot;.

The African-American hip hop artist Azealia Banks has criticized white rapper Iggy Azalea &quot;for failing to comment on &#x27;black issues&#x27; despite capitalising on the appropriation of African American culture in her music&quot;. Banks has called Azalea a &quot;wigger&quot;, and there have been &quot;accusations of racism against Azalea&quot; focused on her &quot;insensitivity to the complexities of race relations and cultural appropriation&quot;.

Robert A. Clift&#x27;s documentary titled &quot;Blacking Up: Hip-Hop&#x27;s Remix of Race and Identity&quot; questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture. The term of art &quot;wigger&quot; &quot;is used both proudly and derisively to describe white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture&quot;. Clift&#x27;s documentary examines &quot;racial and cultural ownership and authenticity—a path that begins with the stolen blackness seen in the success of Stephen Foster, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman, Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones—all the way up to Justin Bieber, Vanilla Ice (popular music&#x27;s ur-wigger) and Eminem&quot;. A review of the documentary refers to the wiggers as &quot;white poseurs&quot;.

==Lawsuit==
A 2011 class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for Minnesota alleged that the administration at a predominantly white high school showed a &quot;deliberate indifference&quot; in allowing a group of students to hold a homecoming event called &quot;Wigger Day&quot; or &quot;Wangsta Day&quot; since at least 2008. A plaintiff named Quera Pruitt sought declaratory judgment and $75,000 in punitive damages from the defendants for creating a racially hostile environment. On July 24, 2012, the parties settled out of court with Pruitt being awarded $90,000.

<doc id="335396" wikidata="Q1545526" url="?curid=335396" title="USS Ticonderoga (CV-14)">
<text>USS &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-14) was one of 24 s built during World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named after the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in the American Revolutionary War. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was commissioned in May 1944, and served in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning five battle stars. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). She was recommissioned too late to participate in the Korean War, but was very active in the Vietnam War, earning three Navy Unit Commendations, one Meritorious Unit Commendation, and 12 battle stars.

&quot;Ticonderoga&quot; differed somewhat from the earlier &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships in that she was longer to accommodate bow-mounted anti-aircraft guns. Most subsequent &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers were completed to this &quot;long-hull&quot; design and were referred to as the . At the end of her career, after a number of modifications, she was said to be in the &quot;Hancock&quot; class according to the Naval vessel register.

&quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was decommissioned in 1973 and sold for scrap in 1975.

==Construction and commissioning==
The ship was laid down as &quot;Hancock&quot; on 1 February 1943 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., renamed &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; on 1 May 1943, and launched on 7 February 1944, sponsored by Miss Stephanie Sarah Pell. She was commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 8 May 1944, Captain Dixie Kiefer in command.

==Service history==

&quot;Ticonderoga&quot; remained at Norfolk for almost two months outfitting and embarking Air Group 80. On 26 June 1944, the carrier shaped a course for the British West Indies. She conducted air operations and drills en route and reached Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 30 June. For the next 15 days, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; trained intensively to weld her air group and crew into an efficient wartime team. She departed the West Indies on 16 July and headed back to Norfolk where she arrived on 22 July for post-shakedown repairs and alterations. On 30 August, the carrier headed for Panama. She transited the Panama Canal on 4 September and steamed up the coast to Naval Base San Diego the following day. On 13 September, the carrier moored at San Diego where she loaded provisions, fuel, aviation gas, and an additional 77 aircraft, as well as the Marine Corps aviation and defense units that went with them. On 19 September, she steamed for Hawaii where she arrived five days later.

&quot;Ticonderoga&quot; remained at Pearl Harbor for almost a month. She and conducted experiments in the underway transfer of aviation bombs from cargo ship to aircraft carrier. Following those tests, she conducted air operations – day and night landing and antiaircraft defense drills – until 18 October, when she exited Pearl Harbor and headed for the western Pacific. After a brief stop at Eniwetok, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; arrived at Ulithi in the Western Caroline Islands on 29 October. There she embarked Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Commander, Carrier Division 6, and joined Task Force 38 (TF 38) as a unit of Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman&#x27;s Task Group 38.3 (TG 38.3).

===World War II===

====Philippine campaign====
The carrier sortied from Ulithi with TF 38 on 2 November 1944. She joined the other carriers as they resumed their extended air cover for the ground forces supporting the Battle of Leyte. She launched her first air strike on the morning of 5 November. The aircraft of her air group spent the next two days pummeling enemy shipping near Luzon and air installations on that island. Her aircraft bombed and strafed the airfields at Zablan, Mandaluyong, and Pasig. They also joined those of other carriers in sinking the heavy cruiser . In addition, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; pilots claimed six Japanese aircraft shot down and one destroyed on the ground, as well as 23 others damaged.

Around 16:00 on 5 November, the enemy attacked with a group of &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft. Two of the suicide aircraft penetrated the American combat air patrol and antiaircraft fire to crash into the aircraft carrier . &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; emerged from that attack unscathed and claimed a tally of two splashes. On 6 November, the warship launched two fighter sweeps and two bombing strikes against the Luzon airfields and enemy shipping in the vicinity. Her airmen returned later that day claiming the destruction of 35 Japanese aircraft and attacks on six enemy ships in Manila Bay. After recovering her aircraft, the carrier retired to the east to resupply.

She refueled and received replacement aircraft on 7 November and then headed back to continue operating against enemy forces in the Philippines. Early on the morning of 11 November, her aircraft combined with others of TF 38 to attack a Japanese reinforcement convoy, just as it was preparing to enter Ormoc Bay from the Camotes Sea. Together, the aircraft accounted for all the enemy transports and four of the seven escorting destroyers. On 12–13 November, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and her sister ships launched strikes at Luzon airfields and docks and shipping around Manila. This raid destroyed the light cruiser , four destroyers, and seven merchant ships. At the conclusion of the raid, TF 38 retired eastward for refueling. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and the rest of TG 38.3, however, continued east to Ulithi where they arrived on 17 November to replenish, refuel, and rearm.

On 22 November, the aircraft carrier departed Ulithi once more and steamed back toward the Philippines. Three days later, she launched air strikes on central Luzon and adjacent waters. Her pilots sank the heavy cruiser , previously damaged in the Battle off Samar. Later, they attacked an enemy convoy about southwest of &quot;Kumano&quot; in Dasol Bay. Of this convoy, cruiser &quot;Yasoshima&quot;, a merchantman, and three landing ships were sunk. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;″s air group ended their day of destruction with an aerial battle which cost the Japanese 15 aircraft shot down and 11 destroyed on the ground.

While her air group fought the Japanese, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;″s shipboard crew also went into action. Just after noon, a torpedo launched by an enemy aircraft broached in the wake of the light aircraft carrier , announcing the approach of an enemy air raid. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;″s gunners manned their battle stations defending against both conventional and suicide attacks on the task group. Her sister ship was set afire when one of the &quot;kamikaze&quot;s crashed into her. When a second suicide aircraft tried to attack the stricken carrier, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;″s gunners joined those firing from other ships in shooting it down. That afternoon, while damage control parties worked on &quot;Essex&quot;, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; recovered aircrew which the damaged &quot;Essex&quot; and were unable to receive. The following day, TF 38 retired to the east.

TF 38 stood out of Ulithi again on 11 December and headed for the Philippines. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; arrived at the launch point early in the afternoon of 13 December and sent her aircraft aloft to blanket Japanese airbases on Luzon while Army aircraft attacked those in the central Philippines. For three days, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; airmen and their comrades launched airstrikes on enemy airfields. She withdrew on 16 December with the rest of TF 38 in search of a fueling rendezvous. While attempting to find calmer waters in which to refuel, TF 38 steamed directly through a violent, but unheralded, typhoon. Though the storm cost Admiral William Halsey&#x27;s force three destroyers and over 800 lives, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and the other carriers managed to ride it out with a minimum of damage. Having survived the battle, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; returned to Ulithi on 24 December.

Repairs occasioned by the typhoon kept TF 38 in the anchorage almost until the end of the month. The carriers did not return to sea until 30 December 1944 when they steamed north to hit Formosa and Luzon in preparation for the landings on the latter island at Lingayen Gulf. Severe weather limited the Formosa strikes on 3–4 January 1945 but also hampered enemy operations. The warships fueled at sea on 5 January. Despite rough weather on 6 January, the strikes on Luzon airfields were carried out. That day, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;″s airmen and their colleagues of the other air groups increased their score by another 32 enemy aircraft. 7 January brought more strikes on Luzon installations. After a fueling rendezvous on 8 January, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; sped north at night to get into position to blanket Japanese airfields in the Ryūkyūs during the Lingayen assault the following morning. However, foul weather, the bugaboo of TF 38 during the winter of 1944 and 1945, forced TG 38.3 to abandon the strikes on the Ryūkyū airfields and join TG 38.2 in pounding Formosa.

====South China Sea combat====

During the night of 9–10 January, TF 38 steamed through the Luzon Strait and then headed generally southwest, diagonally across the South China Sea. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; provided combat air patrol coverage on 11 January and helped to bring down four enemy aircraft which attempted to snoop the formation. Otherwise, the carriers and their consorts proceeded uneventfully to a point some off the coast of Indochina. There, on 12 January, they launched their approximately 850 aircraft and made a series of anti-shipping sweeps during which they sank 44 ships, totaling over .

After recovering aircraft in the late afternoon, the carriers moved off to the northeast. Heavy weather hindered fueling operations on the 13th–14th and air reconnaissance failed to detect any worthwhile targets. On 15 January, fighters raided Japanese airfields on the Chinese coast while the carriers headed for a position from which to strike Hong Kong. The following morning, they launched anti-shipping bombing raids and fighter sweeps of air installations. Weather prevented air operations on 17 January and again made fueling difficult. It worsened the next day and stopped replenishment operations altogether, so that they were not finally concluded until 19 January. The force then took a course generally northward to retransit Luzon Strait via Balintang Channel.

====Attacks on South Japanese islands====
The three task groups of TF 38 completed their transit during the night of 20–21 January. The next morning, aided by favorable flight conditions, their aircraft hit airfields on Formosa, in the Pescadores, and at Sakishima Gunto. While it allowed American flight operations to continue through the day, it also allowed for Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot; operations.

Just after noon, a single-engine Japanese aircraft scored a hit on &quot;Langley&quot; with a glide-bombing attack. Seconds later, a &quot;kamikaze&quot; swooped out of the clouds and plunged toward &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;. The aircraft crashed through the ship&#x27;s flight deck abreast of the No. 2 mount, and its bomb exploded just above her hangar deck. Several aircraft stowed nearby erupted into flames and men were killed. While the crew were ordered into action to save the endangered carrier, Captain Kiefer conned his ship skillfully. First, he changed course to keep the wind from fanning the blaze. Then, he ordered magazines and other compartments flooded to prevent further explosions and to correct a 10° starboard list. Finally, he instructed the damage control party to continue flooding compartments on &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;″s port side which induced a 10° port list which dumped the fire overboard. Firefighters and aircraft handlers completed the dangerous job of dousing the flames and jettisoning burning aircraft.

Other &quot;kamikaze&quot; then assailed the carrier. Her antiaircraft gunners shot down three which all crashed into the sea, but a fourth aircraft struck the carrier&#x27;s starboard side near the island. Its bomb set more aircraft on fire, riddled her flight deck, and injured or killed another 100 sailors, with Captain Kiefer one of the wounded. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;″s crew continued their efforts and were spared further attacks. They brought her fires completely under control not long after 1400, and &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; retired.

====Repair and relaunch====
The stricken carrier arrived at Ulithi on 24 January but remained there only long enough to move her wounded to hospital ship , to transfer her air group to , and to embark passengers bound for home. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; cleared the lagoon on 28 January and headed for the U.S. The warship stopped briefly at Pearl Harbor &quot;en route&quot; to the Puget Sound Navy Yard where she arrived on 15 February. Captain William Sinton assumed command in February 1945.

Her repairs were completed on 20 April, and she cleared Puget Sound the following day for the Alameda Naval Air Station, Alameda, California. After embarking passengers and aircraft bound for Hawaii, the carrier headed for Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 1 May. The next day, Air Group 87 came on board and, for the next week, trained in preparation for the carrier&#x27;s return to combat. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor and shaped a course for the western Pacific. &quot;En route&quot; to Ulithi, on 17 May, she launched her aircraft for what amounted to training strikes on Japanese-held Taroa in the Marshalls. On 22 May, the warship arrived in Ulithi and rejoined the Fast Carrier Task Force as an element of Rear Admiral Radford&#x27;s TG 58.4.

====Preparing for the Japan campaign====
Two days after her arrival, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; sortied from Ulithi with TF 58 and headed north to spend the last weeks of the war in Japanese home waters. Three days out, Admiral Halsey relieved Admiral Raymond Spruance, the 5th Fleet reverted to 3rd Fleet, and TF 58 became TF 38 again for the duration. On 2–3 June, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; fighters struck at airfields on Kyūshū in an effort to neutralize the remnants of Japanese air power – particularly the &quot;kamikaze&quot; – and to relieve the pressure on American forces at Okinawa. During the following two days, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; rode out her second typhoon in less than six months and emerged relatively unscathed. She provided combat air patrol cover for 6 June refueling rendezvous, and four of her fighters intercepted and destroyed three Okinawa-bound &quot;kamikaze&quot;s. That evening, she steamed off at high speed with TG 38.4 to conduct a fighter sweep of airfields on southern Kyūshū on 8 June. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;″s aircraft then joined in the aerial bombardment of Minami Daito and Kita Daito islands before the carrier headed for Leyte where she arrived on the 13th.

During the two-week rest and replenishment period she enjoyed at Leyte, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; changed task organizations from TG 38.4 to Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan&#x27;s TG 38.3. On 1 July, under the flag of Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, she departed Leyte with TF 38 and headed north to resume raids on Japan. Two days later, a damaged reduction gear forced her into Apra Harbor, Guam, for repairs. She remained there until the 19th when she steamed off to rejoin TF 38. On the 24th, her aircraft joined those of other fast carriers in striking ships in the Inland Sea and airfields at Nagoya, Osaka, and Miko. During those raids, TF 38 aircraft found the sad remnants of the once-mighty Japanese Fleet and bagged battleships , , and as well as an escort carrier, , and two heavy cruisers. On 28 July, her aircraft directed their efforts toward the Kure Naval Base, where they pounded an aircraft carrier, three cruisers, a destroyer, and a submarine.

She shifted her attention to the industrial area of central Honshū on 30 July, then to northern Honshū and Hokkaidō on 9–10 August. The latter attacks thoroughly destroyed the marshaling area for a planned airborne suicide raid on the B-29 bases in the Marianas. On 13–14 August, her aircraft returned to the Tokyo area and helped to subject the Japanese capital to another severe drubbing. On the morning of 16 August, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; launched another strike against Tokyo. During or just after that attack, word reached TF 38 to the effect that Japan had capitulated. The shock of peace, though not so abrupt as that of war almost four years previously, took some getting used to. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and her sister ships remained on a full war footing. She continued patrols over Japanese territory and sent reconnaissance flights in search of camps containing Allied prisoners of war so that air-dropped supplies could be rushed to them. On 6 September – four days after the formal surrender ceremony aboard – &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; entered Tokyo Bay.

===Post-war===
Her arrival at Tokyo ended one phase of her career and began another. From Tokyo, she embarked homeward-bound to Bremerton Navy Yard in Puget Sound and was again put to sea on 20 October 1945. After a stop in Pearl Harbor in November to alter the carrier to accommodate additional passengers for the Operation Magic Carpet voyage, she steamed to Okinawa, Japan, to pick up servicemen and returned home with a Typhoon on her back reaching Alameda Navy Yard in Oakland, CA in December 1945. She disembarked her passengers and unloaded cargo before heading out to the Philippines at Samar to pick up another group of veterans. Leaving Philippines in early January 1946, she headed home to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard outside of Seattle, WA delivering an estimated two to four thousand returning servicemen and unloading armaments and ammunition before entering the Bremerton Navy Yard to prepare for inactivation.

Almost a year later on 9 January 1947, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was placed out of commission and berthed with the Bremerton Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

On 31 January 1952, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; came out of reserve and went into reduced commission for the transit from Bremerton to New York. She departed Puget Sound on 27 February and reached New York on 1 April. Three days later, she was decommissioned at the New York Naval Shipyard to begin the extensive SCB-27C conversion. During the ensuing 29 months, the carrier received numerous modifications – steam catapults to launch jets, a new nylon barricade, a new deck-edge elevator and the latest electronic and fire control equipment – necessary for her to become an integral unit of the fleet. On 11 September 1954, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was recommissioned at New York, Captain William A. &quot;Bill&quot; Schoech in command.

In January 1955, the carrier shifted to her new home port – Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia – where she arrived on the 6th. Over the next month, she conducted carrier qualifications with Air Group 6 in the Virginia Capes operating area. On 3 February, she sailed out of Hampton Roads for shakedown near Cuba, after which she returned via Norfolk to New York for additional alterations. During the late summer, the warship resumed carrier qualifications in the Virginia Capes area.

She visited Philadelphia over Labor Day weekend to participate in the International Air Show. To demonstrate the power of her new steam catapults, on three consecutive days she launched North American AJ-1 Savages while standing at anchor in the Delaware River. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; next participated in tests of four new aircraft – the A4D-1 Skyhawk, F4D-1 Skyray, F7U Cutlass, and F3H-2N Demon. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; then returned to normal operations along the East Coast until 4 November when she departed Naval Station Mayport, Florida, and headed for Europe. She relieved &quot;Intrepid&quot; at Gibraltar 10 days later and cruised the length of the Mediterranean during the following eight months. On 2 August 1956, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; returned to Norfolk and entered the shipyard to receive an angled flight deck and an enclosed hurricane bow as part of the SCB-125 program.

Those modifications were completed by early 1957, and in April she got underway for her new home port – Alameda, California. She reached her destination on 30 May, underwent repairs, and finished out the summer with operations off the California coast. On 16 September, she sailed out of San Francisco Bay and shaped course for the Far East. &quot;En route&quot;, she stopped at Pearl Harbor before continuing west to Yokosuka Japan, where she arrived on 15 October. For six months, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; cruised the waters from Japan in the north to the Philippines in the south. Upon arriving at Alameda on 25 April 1958, she completed her first deployment to the western Pacific since recommissioning.

From 1958 to 1963, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; made four more peacetime deployments to the western Pacific. During each, she conducted training operations with other units of the 7th Fleet and made goodwill and liberty port calls throughout the Far East. Early in 1964, she began preparations for her sixth cruise to the western Pacific and, following exercises off the west coast and in the Hawaiian Islands, the carrier cleared Pearl Harbor on 4 May for what began as another peaceful tour of duty in the Far East. The first three months of that deployment brought normal operations—training and port calls.

===Vietnam===

====Gulf of Tonkin incident====

On 2 August, while operating in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin, the destroyer reported being attacked by units of the (North) Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy. Within minutes of her receipt of the message, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; dispatched four, rocket-armed F-8E Crusaders to the destroyer&#x27;s assistance. Upon arrival, the Crusaders launched Zuni rockets and strafed the North Vietnamese craft with their cannon. After the efforts of &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and &quot;Maddox&quot;, one boat was left dead in the water and the other two damaged.

Two days later, late in the evening of 4 August, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; received urgent requests from the destroyer – by then on patrol with &quot;Maddox&quot; – for air support in resisting what the destroyer alleged to be another torpedo boat foray. The carrier again launched aircraft to aid the American surface ships, and &quot;Turner Joy&quot; directed them. The Navy surface and air team believed it had sunk two boats and damaged another pair.

President Lyndon Johnson responded with a reprisal to what he felt at the time to be two unprovoked attacks on American seapower and ordered retaliatory air strikes on selected North Vietnamese motor torpedo boat bases. On 5 August, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and launched 60 sorties against four bases and their supporting oil storage facilities. The USN attacks reportedly resulted in the destruction of 25 PT-type boats, severe damage to the bases, and almost complete razing of the oil storage depot. For her quick reaction and successful combat actions on those three occasions, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; received the Navy Unit Commendation.

====Subsequent operations====
After a return visit to Japan in September, the aircraft carrier resumed normal operations in the South China Sea until winding up the deployment late in the year. She returned to the Naval Air Station North Island, California, on 15 December 1964. Following post-deployment and holiday stand-down, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; moved to the Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard on 27 January 1965 to begin a five-month overhaul. She completed repairs in June and spent the summer operating along the coast of southern California. On 28 September, the aircraft carrier put to sea for another deployment to the Orient. She spent some time in the Hawaiian Islands for an operational readiness exercise then continued on to the Far East. She reached &quot;Dixie Station&quot; on 5 November and immediately began combat air operations.

&quot;Ticonderoga&quot;″s winter deployment of 1965 and 1966 was her first total combat tour of duty during American involvement in the Vietnam War. During her six months in the Far East, the carrier spent a total of 116 days in air operations off the coast of Vietnam dividing her time almost evenly between &quot;Dixie&quot; and &quot;Yankee Stations&quot;, the carrier operating areas off South and North Vietnam, respectively. Her air group delivered over of ordnance in more than 10,000 combat sorties, with a loss of 16 aircraft, but only five pilots. For the most part, her aircraft hit enemy installations in North Vietnam and interdicted supply routes into South Vietnam, including river-borne and coastwise junk and sampan traffic as well as roads, bridges, and trucks on land. Specifically, they claimed the destruction of 35 bridges as well as numerous warehouses, barracks, trucks, boats, and railroad cars and severe damage to a major North Vietnamese thermal power plant located at Uong Bi north of Haiphong. After a stop at Yokosuka, Japan, from 25 April to 3 May 1966, the warship put to sea to return to the United States. On 13 May, she pulled into port at San Diego to end the deployment.

On 5 December 1965, an A-4 Skyhawk was lost overboard while the aircraft carrier was from Kikai Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. The aircraft was being rolled from a hangar bay onto an elevator. The aircraft had mounted on it a B43 nuclear bomb. The pilot, Lieutenant JG Douglas Webster, the A-4E Skyhawk, BuNo &quot;151022&quot;, of Attack Squadron VA-56 &quot;Champions&quot;, and the nuclear weapon were all lost. No public mention was made of the incident at the time and it would not come to light until a 1981 United States Department of Defense report revealed that a one-megaton bomb had been lost. Japan then asked for details of the incident.

====1966–1967, 1967–1968 deployments====
Following repairs she steamed out of San Diego on 9 July to begin a normal round of West Coast training operations. Those and similar evolutions continued until 15 October, when &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; departed San Diego, bound via Hawaii for the western Pacific. The carrier reached Yokosuka, Japan, on 30 October and remained there until 5 November when she headed south for an overnight stop at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, Subic Bay in the Philippines on 10–11 November. On 13 November, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; arrived in the Gulf of Tonkin and began the first of three combat tours during her 1966–1967 deployment. She launched 11,650 combat sorties, all against enemy targets located in North Vietnam. Again, her primary targets were logistics and communications lines and transportation facilities. For her contribution and that of Air Wing Nineteen to Operation Rolling Thunder, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was awarded her second Navy Unit Commendation.

She completed her final line period on 27 April 1967 and returned to Yokosuka, from which she departed again on 19 May to return to the United States. Ten days later, the carrier entered San Diego and began a month-long, post-deployment stand-down. At the beginning of July, she shifted to Bremerton, Washington, where she entered the Puget Sound for two months of repairs. Upon the completion of yard work, she departed Bremerton on 6 September and steamed south to training operations off the coast of southern California.

On 28 December 1967, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; sailed for her fourth combat deployment to the waters off the Indochinese coast and arrived on Yankee Station in January 1968. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was on Yankee Station for the beginning of the 1968 Tet Offensive. Nearly coincidental with the Tet Offensive, the siege of Khe Sanh began and , an American spy ship, was seized by the North Koreans and taken to Wonsan harbor. The aircraft carrier was immediately deployed to the coast of North Korea, beginning Operation Formation Star. Approximately a week later, &quot;Ranger&quot; was relieved off Korea by &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and returned to Yankee Station. joined &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and strikes were planned against seven MiG airfields with approximately 200 MiGS. These strikes were never executed and &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; returned to Yankee Station to resume her role in the Tet Offensive. Between January 1968 and July 1968, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was on the line off the coast of Vietnam for five separate periods totaling 120 days of combat duty. During that time, her air wing flew just over 13,000 combat sorties against North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, most frequently in the continuing attempts to interdict the enemy lines of supply.

Between line periods, she regularly returned to Subic Bay and Naval Air Station Cubi Point for rest and replenishment. She also made port visits at Singapore and Hong Kong. On 9 July, during her fifth line period, LCDR John B. Nichols claimed &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;″s first MiG kill. The carrier completed that line period and entered Subic Bay for upkeep on 25 July. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; then proceeded for her homeport in Naval Air Station North Island, Coronado, California arriving on 17 August 1968 after a one-day delay in the fog off San Diego in the San Clemente Channel. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; moved to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for repairs and certain conversions to handle the A-7 Corsair attack jet and to prepare for her fifth combat cruise in February 1969.

====Final deployments====
During the first month of 1969, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; made preparations for her fifth consecutive combat deployment to the Southeast Asia area. On 1 February, she cleared San Diego and headed west. After a brief stop at Pearl Harbor a week later, she continued her voyage to Yokosuka where she arrived on the 20th. The carrier departed Yokosuka on 28 February for the coast of Vietnam where she arrived on 4 March. Over the next four months, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; served four periods on the line off Vietnam, interdicting Communist supply lines and making strikes against their positions.

During her second line period, however, her tour of duty off Vietnam came to an abrupt end on 16 April when she was shifted north to the Sea of Japan. North Korean aircraft had shot down a Navy reconnaissance aircraft in the area, and &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was called upon to beef up the forces assigned to the vicinity. However, the crisis abated, and &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; entered Subic Bay on 27 April for upkeep. On 8 May, she departed the Philippines to return to &quot;Yankee Station&quot; and resumed interdiction operations. Between her third and fourth line periods, the carrier visited Sasebo and Hong Kong.

The aircraft carrier took station off Vietnam for her last line period of the deployment on 26 June and there followed 37 more days of highly successful air sorties against enemy targets. Following that tour, she joined TF 71 in the Sea of Japan for the remainder of the deployment. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; concluded the deployment—a highly successful one, for she received her third Navy Unit Commendation for her operations during that tour of duty—when she left Subic Bay on 4 September.

===Post-Vietnam service===

&quot;Ticonderoga&quot; arrived in San Diego on 18 September 1969. After almost a month of post-deployment stand-down, she moved to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard in mid-October to begin conversion to an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) aircraft carrier. Overhaul and conversion work began on 20 October, and &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was redesignated &quot;CVS-14&quot; the next day. She completed overhaul and conversion on 28 May 1970 and conducted exercises out of Long Beach for most of June. On 26 June, the new ASW support carrier entered her new home port, San Diego. In July–August, she conducted refresher training, refresher air operations, and carrier landing qualifications. She operated off the California coast for the remainder of the year and participated in two naval exercises-HUKASWEX 4–70 late in October and COMPUTEX 23–70 between 30 November and 3 December.

USS &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; made an all but brief appearance in the Movie &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; which was being filmed in 1970, Ticonderoga Flight Deck Number 14 briefly appears in shot, while playing Admiral William (Bull) Halsey&#x27;s Flagship USS Enterprise (CV-6).

During the remainder of her active career, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; made two more deployments to the Far East. Because of her change in mission, neither tour of duty included combat operations off Vietnam. Both, however, included training exercises in the Sea of Japan with ships of the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. The first of these two cruises also brought operations in the Indian Ocean with units of the Thai Navy and a transit of Sunda Strait during which a ceremony was held to commemorate the loss of the cruisers and in 1942.
In between these two last deployments, she operated in the eastern Pacific and participated in the recovery of the Apollo 16 Moon mission capsule and astronauts 215 miles SE off Christmas Island during April 1972. The second deployment came in the summer of 1972, and, in addition to the training exercises in the Sea of Japan, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; also joined ASW training operations in the South China Sea. That fall, she returned to the eastern Pacific and, in November practiced for the recovery of Apollo 17. The next month, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; recovered her second set of space voyagers near American Samoa at decimal -17.88, -166.11. The carrier then headed back to San Diego where she arrived on 28 December. On 22 June 1973, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; recovered the Skylab 2 astronauts near San Diego.

&quot;Ticonderoga&quot; remained active for nine more months, first operating out of San Diego and then making preparations for inactivation. On 1 September 1973, the aircraft carrier was decommissioned after a board of inspection and survey found her to be unfit for further naval service. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 16 November 1973, and arrangements were begun to sell her for scrap. She was sold for scrap 1 September 1975.
==Legacy==
The USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) is prominently featured in the Japanese historical drama film The Eternal Zero (2013), directed by Takashi Yamazaki. The film chronicles the life of Miyabe Kyuzo, a highly skilled and conscientious pilot serving in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II.

In a pivotal scene set on January 21, 1945, Miyabe undertakes a kamikaze mission, deliberately crashing his aircraft into the USS Ticonderoga. This dramatic moment is portrayed as a culmination of Miyabe&#x27;s internal conflict, personal sacrifices, and his sense of duty. While fictionalized, the film&#x27;s depiction is inspired by actual events, as the Ticonderoga sustained significant damage from kamikaze attacks on the same date.

The inclusion of the USS Ticonderoga in The Eternal Zero underscores the carrier&#x27;s historical significance during the Pacific War and highlights its enduring legacy in popular culture.

<doc id="335398" wikidata="Q7274437" url="?curid=335398" title="R1 (New York City Subway car)">
<text>The R1 was the first New York City Subway car type built for the Independent Subway System (IND). 300 cars were manufactured between 1930 and 1931 by the American Car and Foundry Company, numbered 100 through 399, all arranged as single units. Nicknamed City Cars, the R1s were the first of five subway car classes collectively referred to as the R1–9 fleet, with future passenger stock orders – including contracts R4, R6, R7/A, and R9 – being virtually identical, with minor mechanical and cosmetic variations.

The first R1s were delivered in 1931, in anticipation for the opening of the IND Eighth Avenue Line. For their time, the R1s introduced several improvements to subway car design that greatly sped up the flow of passengers in and out of trains. The R40s, R42s, R44s, and R46s gradually replaced the fleet of R1s, with the final run taking place in 1976. Several R1 cars were saved for preservation, while the rest were scrapped.

==Description==
The R1s were numbered 100–399. They were the first &quot;R&quot; type contract order (referring to the practice of naming a car class by the letter &quot;R&quot; – which stands for rolling stock – followed by a number derived from the actual contract number). Future orders of subway cars, including those built for the A Division, would follow the R contract. The R2 contract order was for trucks and motors for the R1 fleet. In 1930, each new car cost $39,201: $30,483 for the car body under contract R1, and $8,718 for trucks and motors under contract R2.

==History==
The first R1 cars to see passenger service were twenty individual cars to serve for two eight-car trains plus spares that were placed in revenue service on the BMT Sea Beach Line from July 8 to November 1931 for testing and then returned to the IND the same year. The BMT was to have been paid by the City of New York for the testing, but since the trains were well used in passenger service, the BMT and City called it even.

The cars were ordered so that the new Eighth Avenue Line subway could be operated.

In 1949, when all of the R10 cars were delivered and placed in service on the A, some of the R1 cars were transferred to the Coney Island Yard to relieve a car shortage on the BMT Southern Division, as well as to provide fleet for the conversion of the Astoria Line to exclusive BMT operation in fall 1949. The fleet was expanded by stages and reached 140 cars by 1953. They were used for service on the BMT 2 (now R) Broadway–4th Avenue Local service. However, despite ostensibly relieving a car shortage on the BMT, through subway service in rush hours to Coney Island did not occur on the BMT West End Line until December 1953, and on the BMT Culver Line until October 1954, when that line became part of the IND Culver Line. Upon delivery of the R16 cars in 1954–1955, the cars were returned to the IND Division.

===Retirement===
Most R1s were retired from 1968 to 1970 as age decayed the cars&#x27; internal components, causing the cars to perform worse than their newer contemporaries. Some were replaced by the R40s while many more were replaced by the R42s, but some remained past 1970 until being retired and replaced by the R44s. However, car 369, which was renumbered to 576 on October 3, 1969 and then to 1768 on August 27, 1973, was transferred to the East New York Yard. It ran on the Eastern Division until December 1, 1976, when it was finally replaced by the R46s.

Following their removal from service, the majority of the fleet was scrapped. A small number of cars remained in work service and were used until the 1980s. Several other cars have been preserved and remain today, including:
*100 – preserved by the New York Transit Museum and restored. It is the first car of the R1–9 fleet, numerically.
*103 – preserved by Railway Preservation Corp. and restored. This car was retrofitted with axiflow-type fans in the 1940s.
*381 – preserved by Railway Preservation Corp. and restored.

Car 175 is at the Seashore Trolley Museum, but is used only for storage and as a source of spare parts. It does not have trucks, and two of its side doors were donated to R4 401, which has been preserved by Railway Preservation Corp. and restored.

<text>Island single malts are the single malt Scotch whiskies produced on the islands around the perimeter of the Scottish mainland. The islands (excluding Islay) are not recognised in the Scotch Whisky Regulations as a distinct whisky producing region, but are considered to be part of the Highland region. Islay is itself recognised as a distinct whisky producing region (see Islay whisky).

Other sources, however, indicate that the Islands, excluding Islay, constitute a sixth distinct region. This unofficial region includes the following whisky-producing islands: Arran, Jura, Mull, Orkney, and Skye: with their respective distilleries: Arran, Jura, Tobermory, Highland Park, Scapa and Talisker.

The whiskies produced on the Islands are extremely varied and have few similarities, though can often be distinguished from other whisky regions by generally having a smokier flavour with peaty undertones. One source states that the flavour depends on the use of peat which &quot;varies widely depending on the distiller&quot;.

<text>Talisker distillery is an island single malt Scotch whisky distillery based in Carbost, Scotland on the Minginish Peninsula on the Isle of Skye.

The distillery is operated by Diageo and Taliskers’ 10 year old whisky has been nominated as part of their &quot;Classic Malts&quot; series. Whiskies attributed to the Talisker brand have been praised by whisky commentators such as Jim Murray.

In 1830 Hugh MacAskill leased the site from the MacLeods, having raised £3,000 and built the distillery. He chose to name it after his estate, Talisker (some 5 miles west), rather than the village in which it was located.

==History==
After a number of false starts, the distillery was founded in 1830 by Hugh and Kenneth MacAskill. It opened at Carbost in 1831 after they acquired the lease of Talisker House from Clan MacLeod. In 1879, it was purchased for £1,810 () by a firm which became known as R. Kemp &amp; Co. when it had a production capacity of 700 gallons per week. The principal partner was A.G. Allan, Procurator-Fiscal for Elginshire. The other partner was Roderick Kemp, wine merchant of Elgin.

The distillery was rebuilt 1880–87 and extended in 1900. A new lease for the distillery was negotiated in 1892 with the chief of Clan MacLeod for an annual payment of £23.12s () and a ten-gallon cask of best-quality Talisker. By 1894 the output was up to 2,000 gallons per week. In 1895 the business was converted into a limited liability company with Thomas Mackenzie as managing partner, but the shares were not offered to the public.

Talisker was acquired by the Distillers Company in 1925. On 12 August 1948 a fire broke out in the store of the distillery. No whisky was destroyed, but grain in store and over 100 empty barrels were lost.

The distillery was rebuilt again in 1960 after a stillhouse fire completely destroyed the distillery. The distillery operates five stills; two wash stills and three spirit stills. All the stills use worm tubs (condensing coils) rather than a modern condenser, which are believed to give the whisky a &quot;fuller&quot; flavour (itself an indication of higher sugar content). During this early period, the whisky was produced using a triple distilling method, but changed to the more conventional double distilling in 1928. After the 1960 fire, five exact replicas of the original stills were constructed to preserve the original Talisker flavour. In 1972 the stills were converted to steam heating and the maltings floor was demolished. 

DLC was renamed as United Distillers in 1987. In 1998 United Distillers was merged with International Distillers &amp; Vintners to create United Distillers &amp; Vintners, forming the spirits division of Diageo plc.

==Production==
Talisker&#x27;s water comes from springs directly above the distillery via a network of pipes and wells.

The malted barley used in production comes from Muir of Ord. Talisker has an unusual feature—swan neck lye pipes. A loop in the pipes takes the vapour from the stills to the worm tubs, which causes some of the alcohol to condense before it reaches the cooler. It then runs back into the stills and is distilled again. Talisker now has an annual output of three and a half million litres of spirit.

The spirit is most frequently matured in American oak casks. The malt is peated to a phenol level of approximately 18–22 parts per million (ppm), which is a medium peating level. Additionally, the water used for production, from Cnoc nan Speireag (Hawk Hill), flows over peat which adds additional complexity to the whisky.

The distillery began producing special bottlings of the whisky for connoisseurs in the early 2000s, with a 20- and 25-year bottling (where previously only a 10-year and 18-year were available). The 25-year bottling, despite being more expensive than the 20-year bottling, was distributed more widely.

In 2007 Talisker 18-year-old won &quot;Best Single Malt In The World 2007&quot; at the World Whiskies Awards. and in 2015 Talisker 10 Year Old won a Double Gold Medal and &quot;Best Single Malt Scotch up to 12 years&quot; in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.

Talisker was the favourite whisky of writers Robert Louis Stevenson and HV Morton. In his poem &quot;The Scotsman&#x27;s Return From Abroad&quot;, Stevenson mentioned &quot;The king o&#x27; drinks, as I conceive it, Talisker, Islay, or Glenlivet.&quot;

==Reviews and accolades==
Talisker whiskies have generally performed very well at international Spirit ratings competitions and have won some acclaim from liquor review organizations. The 10-, 18-, 25- and 30-year Taliskers have been awarded mostly gold medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. The 10- and 18-year varieties, meanwhile, have received scores of 85-89 and 90-95 from Wine Enthusiast. Spirits ratings aggregator proof66.com, which averages scores from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Wine Enthusiast, and others, classifies Talisker&#x27;s 10-year scotch in its highest (&quot;Tier 1&quot;) performance category.

Talisker Distiller&#x27;s Edition won Best Islands Single Malt at the 2013 World Whiskies Awards.

<doc id="335410" wikidata="Q559194" url="?curid=335410" title="Pope Demetrius I of Alexandria">
<text>Demetrius I (died 22 October 232), 12th Bishop and Patriarch of Alexandria. Sextus Julius Africanus, who visited Alexandria in the Bishoprice of Demetrius, places his accession as eleventh bishop from Mark in the tenth year of Roman Emperor Commodus; Eusebius of Caesarea places it in the tenth year of Septimius Severus.

==Life==
Demetrius was a farmer, who cohabited with his wife as celibates, for 47 years, until he was chosen Patriarch. According to the &quot;Coptic Synaxarium&quot;, a biographical collection of the Church&#x27;s saints, the ailing Patriarch Julian had a vision informing him that his successor would visit him, with a cluster of grapes, while out of season at that time of year. The next day, a farmer named Demetrius arrived with a cluster of grapes for the Bishop, asking for his blessings, and was announced next as Bishop Demetrius I, the twelfth bishop of Alexandria.

Bishop Demetrius was eager to establish a fixed calendar for church fasts and feast days. He established a liturgical calendar by which fast dates were determined. As bishop of the great metropolis, Demetrius was engaged in the controversy over the canonical calculation of Easter. He was the first to apply the calculation method for determining the dates of Easter. His edict was approved by the Nicene Council (325 AD). The Oriental Orthodox churches continue to follow Alexandria.

Jerome claimed that Demetrius sent Pantaenus on a mission to India, it is likely that Clement succeeded Pantaenus as head of the Catechetical School before the patriarchy of Demetrius. When Clement left Alexandria (c. 203), Demetrius appointed Origen, who was in his eighteenth year, as Clement&#x27;s successor.

Demetrius supported Origen in the beginning of his career, it is said to have admired his scholarship. He dispatched Origen to Arabia, upon an invitation for his visit in letters to the prefect of Alexandria. When the Emperor Caracalla sacked Alexandria in 215 AD, Origen fled to Caesarea, where the Palestinean bishops requested him to give sermons. Demetrius was enraged and wrote to rebuke that his teaching was not canonical for him, as a layman. Bishops Alexander of Jerusalem and Theoctistus of Caesarea wrote in his defense and mentioned precedents for laymen to give sermons, but despite their efforts Demetrius recalled Origen.

In 230, Origen was asked to settle a dispute in Achaea which required his presence, so he set out by way of Palestine. Origen was then ordained priest at Caesarea. When Demetrius learned of this, he considered it an act of emancipation, which deteriorated their relationship. Demetrius convened a synod in 232 that banished Origen, then sent a condemnation of Origen&#x27;s behavior to all the churches. It is evident, it was personal jealousy not merely non ordination, that have been alleged by Demetrius for such a reaction. Rome accepted the decision, but Caesarea, Phoenicia, Arabia, Achaea disputed it. From Caesarea Origen sent forth letters in his self defence, and attacked Demetrius.

Demetrius then passed Catechetical School under the charge of Heraclas, an assistant of Origen, who had long been his associate. This may have been Demetrius&#x27; final act as bishop. Demetrius governed the Church of Alexandria for forty-two years, and died at the age of 105.

<text>The University of South Australia is a public research university based in Adelaide, South Australia. Established in 1991, it is the successor of the former South Australian Institute of Technology. Its main campuses along North Terrace are adjacent to the Australian Space Agency in Lot Fourteen and forms part of the Adelaide BioMed City research precinct. It also has a presence in the Adelaide Technology Park in Mawson Lakes. In mid-2023, it agreed to merge with the neighbouring University of Adelaide to form Adelaide University.

Its earliest antecedent institutions were both founded in the Jubilee Exhibition Building of the former Royal South Australian Society of Arts. The South Australian Institute of Technology was founded in 1889 as the School of Mines and Industries and the South Australian College of Advanced Education dates back to the School of Art in 1856. The institute later gained university status during the Dawkins Revolution following their merger in 1991. Its expansion over three decades, including to sites on the west end of North Terrace, and broadening fields of studies later contributed to its status as the state&#x27;s largest university with 34,878 students in 2023.

The university comprises six campuses including the &quot;City East&quot; and &quot;City West&quot; campuses along North Terrace, a tech-oriented campus in Mawson Lakes, the Magill campus specialising in social sciences and two regional campuses in Mount Gambier and Whyalla. Its academic activities are currently divided between the seven academic units. In 2023, the university had a revenue of . It is a member of the Australian Technology Network, an association of technology-focussed universities, but will join the Group of Eight following the merger.

Notable alumni of the university include the incumbent foreign affairs minister Penny Wong, the Human Rights Watch director Tirana Hassan, the founding editor-in-chief of Vogue China Angelica Cheung, former state premier Steven Marshall and retired politician Christopher Pyne. It also manages several museums and exhibitions in a range of fields, including the Samstag Museum and Adelaide Planetarium, and is a part of the state&#x27;s space and defence industry.

== History ==
The University of South Australia was formed in 1991 following by the merger between the South Australian Institute of Technology with three campuses belonging to the South Australian College of Advanced Education.

=== Antecedent institutions ===

==== School of Art ====
The SA School of Art, the earliest antecedent institution of the University of South Australia, was established in 1856 at the former Royal South Australian Society of Arts. The independent art school, which went through many name changes, resided for most of its history at the Jubilee Exhibition Building which was later transferred to the University of Adelaide in 1929. It remained on its campus until 1962 when the building was demolished to make way for several university buildings. It is one of the oldest art schools in Australia, and the oldest public art school. The SASA Gallery in the Kuarna Building, which showcases creative works by students and researchers, is the modern descendant of the school.

==== South Australian Institute of Technology ====

The Jubilee Exhibition Building was also the birthplace of the South Australian Institute of Technology which was established in 1889 as the SA School of Mines and Industries. It moved to the neighbouring Brookman Building in 1903, named after the Scottish-born businessman George Brookman who contributed £15,000 towards its construction.
The building, which took three years to complete, was opened by then-state governor Samuel Way. It is located on the site formerly the eastern annexe of the Jubilee Exhibition Building on the corner of North Terrace and Frome Road between the University of Adelaide and the then-Royal Adelaide Hospital. When opened, only the main hall was named after George Brookman, and a plaque commemorating his contribution is still located in the hall. The Brookman Building in the nearby Grenfell Street, now the site of the Grenfell Centre, was his business headquarters.

The institute maintained strong ties with the neighbouring University of Adelaide that included the co-ordination of teaching, laboratories and examinations across fields of engineering and sciences. Despite the university later establishing its own faculty of engineering in 1937, the reciprocal relationship remained intertwined to its University Council and studies completed at the institute were recognised as equivalent studies eligible for credit towards university courses. The institute later expanded to the regional city of Whyalla in 1962 and to the Adelaide suburb of Mawson Lakes in 1972 as &quot;The Levels&quot;. In 1965, it was designated an advanced college which initiated an expansion in the variety of courses available. The campuses on North Terrace, Mawson Lakes and Whyalla all remain a part of the University of South Australia.

==== South Australian College of Advanced Education ====
The Adelaide Teachers College, which changed names and shifted locations multiple times throughout its existence, was established in 1876. Despite not being located at the University of Adelaide campus until 1900, students from the institution attended university lectures since at least 1878. In 1921, it renamed to the Adelaide Teachers College, in line with other interstate teachers colleges. Despite offers from the university to take control of the college, which was heavily integrated into the university, the Education Department retained administrative authority throughout its early history. The Hartley Building was built as its permanent home in 1927.

The college eventually renamed to the Adelaide College of the Arts and Education. It also established additional teachers colleges in other parts of the city including Magill. Following a series of mergers, the colleges expanded to become advanced colleges which all later amalgamated with the original mother college to become the South Australian College of Advanced Education in 1982. The combined institution continued its presence alongside the University of Adelaide with which it maintained joint teaching, facilities and committees. The campus merged with the latter university in 1991 with three of the remaining campuses merging with the SAIT to establish the University of South Australia.

==== Merger and establishment ====

Stronger demand for advanced college places throughout the country resulted from a broadening appeal of higher education beyond the traditionally elite education provided by the universities. Advanced colleges were originally designed to complement universities, forming a binary system modelled on that of the United Kingdom. It was originally created by the Menzies government following World War II on the advice of a committee led by physicist Leslie H. Martin, during a period of high population growth and corresponding demand for secondary and tertiary education. This sector ceased to exist when, between 1989 and 1992, the Hawke-Keating government implemented the sweeping reforms of Education Minister John Dawkins that dismantled the binary system. The states, eager for increased education funding, merged the colleges either with existing universities or with each other to form new universities. Following its expansion and increasing autonomy from the University of Adelaide, the South Australian Institute of Technology was given the option to merge with either TAFE South Australia or the South Australian College of Advanced Education. It chose to merge with the latter advanced college resulting in the establishment of the University of South Australia, which continues to remain neighbours with the University of Adelaide.

The University of South Australia became the state&#x27;s third public university, a continuation of the former South Australian Institute of Technology that merged with most of the SACAE, and maintained their historical presence next to the University of Adelaide, in the suburbs of Mawson Lakes and Magill and in the regional city of Whyalla. Its expansion over the next few decades, including to sites on the west end of North Terrace, and broadening fields of studies contributed to its status as the state&#x27;s largest university by student population. It also became the second-largest university nationally by number of online students, either in the state or from other parts of the country, and expanded to Mount Gambier in 2005. In 2021, the university celebrated its 30th birthday.

=== Ongoing merger with the University of Adelaide ===
In June 2018, the University of South Australia and the University of Adelaide began discussions regarding the possibility of a merger. The proposition was dubbed a &quot;super uni&quot; by then South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, and Simon Birmingham, but the merger was called off in October 2018 by the University of South Australia, which was less keen. Vice-chancellor David Lloyd, in an email to University of South Australia staff, claimed that the amalgamation lacked a compelling case. This statement was contradicted by the University of Adelaide&#x27;s chancellor who said that the merger continues to be in the state&#x27;s best interests and a spokesperson for the university added that it was still open to future talks. Following the release of several internal FOI documents retrieved by &quot;ABC News&quot;, it was later revealed that the merger talks failed due to disagreements on the post-merger institution&#x27;s leadership structure. The name &quot;Adelaide University of South Australia&quot; was agreed upon by both universities and Chris Schacht, who previously served on the University of Adelaide Council, alleged that the merger talks failed due to disagreement on which vice-chancellor would replace the other following their amalgamation.

In early 2022, the topic of a merger was raised again by the new state government led by premier Peter Malinauskas, which proposed setting up an independent commission to investigate the possibility of a merger between the state&#x27;s three public universities should they decline. He had made an election promise to take a heavy-handed approach towards the merger to reduce students departing to higher-ranking institutions on the east coast and to improve the state&#x27;s ability to attract international students and researchers. At the time, staff&#x27;s opinions were evenly divided on the idea of the commission. Following the appointment of merger advocate Peter Høj as University of Adelaide vice-chancellor, both universities announced that a merger would once again be considered. The universities began a feasibility study into a potential merger at the end of the year. The invitation to merger negotiations was rejected by Flinders University, the state&#x27;s third public university.

The agreement for the merger was reached on 1 July 2023 by the two universities, which then accounted for approximately two-thirds of the state&#x27;s public university population, in consultation with the South Australian Government. The rationale for the amalgamation was a larger institutional scale may be needed in order to increase the universities&#x27; ranking positions, ability to secure future research income and a net positive impact on the state economy. The two universities argued that by combining their expertise, resources and finances into a single institution, they can be more financially viable, with stronger teaching and research outcomes. Support for the merger among existing staff were mixed, with a National Tertiary Education Union SA survey showing that only a quarter were in favour of the amalgamation. Warren Bebbington, who previously served as vice-chancellor at the University of Adelaide, described the proposed institution as a &quot;lumbering dinosaur&quot; in reference to its timing during an ongoing federal review of the higher education sector. Vice-chancellor Colin Stirling described plans to provide the new institution with in research funding and scholarships as &quot;unfair&quot; to students who choose to study at Flinders University. The combined figure was later revised to to include land purchases, with an additional research fund set up for Flinders University.

In November 2023, legislation passed state parliament enabling the creation of the new university to be named &quot;Adelaide University&quot;, previously a colloquial name used by the University of Adelaide. An application for self-accreditation authority was submitted to the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) on 15 January 2024, which was needed for the institution to offer courses that issue qualifications. Following approval on 22 May 2024, students starting studies at the pre-merger institutions from 2025 onwards will be issued degree certificates from Adelaide University. Students enrolled on or prior to 2024 will also be able to opt in adding antecedent institutions&#x27; names and logos on their parchments. The combined institution is expected to become operational by January 2026, with an additional transitional period extending to 2034. It is projected to have 70,000 students at launch, with one-in-four students being international students, and contribute approximately to the Australian economy annually. The amalgamation has been subject to mixed reactions.

== Campuses and buildings ==

The university has six campuses in South Australia including the &quot;City East&quot; and &quot;City West&quot; campuses in the Adelaide city centre, the two metropolitan campuses in Magill and Mawson Lakes and two regional campuses in Mount Gambier and Whyalla.
=== City East ===
The City East campus is located on the corner of North Terrace and Frome Road, next to the University of Adelaide. The main Brookman Building, constructed in 1903 and named after its benefactor George Brookman, formed part of the original School of Mines and Industries later renamed to the South Australian Institute of Technology. It was inherited by the university, which also later expanded to the west end of the terrace as &quot;City West&quot;. The David Murray Library is the main library on the site and is located in the Brookman Building. It is named after Scottish-born merchant and politician David Murray who donated £2000 towards the library.

The original SAIT campus has undergone several building upgrades and expansions. The Basil Hetzel Building was opened in 2005 and includes of multipurpose biomechanical, pharmaceutical and microbiological laboratory space. There was also a major reconstruction to the main Brookman Building from 2008 to 2009 to include a new outdoor plaza, a new exercise physiology clinic, outdoor walkways, student lounges and other upgrades. Some other notable buildings on the east end of the campus include the Playford Building, Bonython Jubilee Building and Centenary Building.
=== City West ===
The City West campus is located on the west end of North Terrace. As the university had expanded to the west end of North Terrace over several decades following its establishment, the buildings on the site are considerably newer than on the east. The Bradley Building is home to various clinical and simulation facilities in the fields of healthcare and medicine, form part of the Adelaide BioMed City Precinct which also includes the affiliated Royal Adelaide Hospital and the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute.

The Hawke Building, also the chancellery, is named after former prime minister Bob Hawke and was constructed in 2007. It is also home to the Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Centre, Kerry Packer Civic Gallery, Samstag Museum, the Allan Scott Auditorium with a seating capacity of 400 seats and the Bradley Forum with 150 seats.

The adjacent Jeffrey Smart Building, named after artist Jeffrey Smart, was constructed in 2014. It is a student hub that comprises &quot;open plan&quot; teaching and learning spaces, the main library on the east end and a central green common area with an outdoor cinema.

Pridham Hall is a gymnasium and multi-sport facility constructed in 2018. It was designed as a collaboration between Norwegian architecture firm Snøhetta, JPE Design Studio and JamFactory. It features a heated swimming pool, gymnasium, dance studio, a sloping roof amphitheatre and a convertible great hall that can be used for both sports or hosting events with up to 2,000 attendees. It was funded largely by alumni, including its namesake Andrew Pridham and his family who donated toward its construction. Other buildings on the east end include the Kaurna Building, Barbara Hanrahan Building, Yungondi Building, Lewis O&#x27;Brien Building, Elton Mayo Building, David Pank Building, Catherine Helen Spence Building, Dorrit Black Building, Way Lee Building, Sir George Kingston Building, Sir Hans Heysen Building, Rowland Rees Building, Liverpool Street Studios and the Enterprise Hub.

=== Magill ===
The Magill campus was established in 1973 and is located on St Bernards Road in the eastern Adelaide suburb of Magill. The campus specialises in the social sciences, psychology, neuroscience, teacher education, sports science, journalism, creative industries, human services, social work, media and communication. It also hosts several media studios, research laboratories, health clinics, a Samsung SMARTSchool and the de Lissa Institute of Early Childhood and Family Studies named after Montessori education pioneer Lillian Daphne de Lissa.

The parkland campus includes the heritage-listed Murray House, named after Scottish-born pastoralist Alexander Borthwick Murray. Built in 1884 and later expanded, the stone building incorporates Victorian-era Italianate and Gothic Revival architecture styles. According to legend, a blonde girl or young woman in Victorian-era attire named &quot;May&quot; supposedly haunts the manor, scaring patrons from the balcony or stairways. The urban myth, one of many supposed &quot;Ghosts of Murray Park&quot;, are akin to the white lady phenomenon in other parts of the world. The house replaced an earlier home built in 1854.

As part of the merger, the entirety of the campus has been sold for housing and commercial re-development. Approximately half of the campus is currently leased back to the university for a period of up to 10 years.

=== Mawson Lakes ===
The Mawson Lakes campus, established in 1972 as &quot;The Levels&quot;, is located in the northern Adelaide suburb of Mawson Lakes along of wetlands. It specialises in fields of science, engineering, computer science, environmental sciences, civil aviation and teacher education. It is also home to the Adelaide Planetarium and several information technology and engineering laboratories, including a defence research lab and the Future Industries Institute.

There are also other private student accommodation providers in the city centre and near other campuses. Additionally, Whyalla campus manages its own student village.

The University of South Australia&#x27;s alumni also includes students from the two antecedent institutions and their predecessors.

Notable alumni of the university include the incumbent foreign affairs minister Penny Wong, the Human Rights Watch director Tirana Hassan, the founding editor-in-chief of Vogue China Angelica Cheung, former state premier Steven Marshall and retired politician Christopher Pyne.

== Controversies ==

=== Initial merger discussions ===
The University of South Australia and the University of Adelaide had previously engaged to discuss a merger in 2018 but failed due to disagreements from the latter about the post-merger leadership structure.

=== Opinion polling on staff ===
The National Tertiary Education Union SA conducted a survey of 1,100 university staff and found that three-quarters of respondents were against the merger. In addition, the state government has been accused of coercing the universities to agree to merge, indicating that a commission of inquiry would be established to find ways to compel the two universities to merge had their councils refused to do so, with less financial support available.

Andrew Miller, the state secretary of the union, raised concerns that staff were under &quot;extreme psychosocial pressure&quot; to meet the 2026 launch deadline. Backing his claims with communications from the &quot;Integration Management Office&quot; staff responsible for merging the two institutions, he added that the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; perception among staff competing &quot;for the final spots of the new Adelaide University&quot; was causing tensions, breakdowns and disharmony. The institutions&#x27; vice-chancellors David Lloyd and Peter Høj criticised the claims, referring to them as &quot;whispers of Little Birds or Littlefingers&quot;, though they had previously admitted that the &quot;two-by-two approach across the board&quot; was &quot;not as linear as first conceived&quot;.

Despite previous polls claiming low support from staff, the vice-chancellors added that the over 3,000 staff who attended the July 2024 Adelaide University launch event were enthusiastic about the new brand identity. They also wrote that criticism should instead be directed towards the proposed caps to international students caused by a national housing shortage.

The post-merger plan to switch to a trimester academic calendar has also been criticised by the union whose internal poll showed that more than 4 in 5 members were against the move. The University of New South Wales had previously also switched to a trimester model, allowing students to complete a 3 year bachelor&#x27;s degree program in 2 years with shorter breaks. As of 2024, UNSW is considering reversing the change following a 40% drop in paid hours for staff, decreased time for non-academic activities and student burnout from increased workload.

=== Land re-development ===
In February 2024, the State Government drew criticism for its plans to convert land it had purchased from two University of South Australia campuses for housing and commercial re-development. As part of the merger agreement, the land was to be sold to the South Australian Government for and leased back to the university for a period of up to 10 years. Following the release of several internal FOI documents retrieved by &quot;InDaily&quot; from the Premier&#x27;s Office, it was later revealed that the land was &quot;earmarked for future development&quot; for residential and commercial purposes.

The original media release replaced the phrase with &quot;short-term transitional lease to university&quot;, referring to the leaseback period of 10 years, following concerns from UniSA vice-chancellor David Lloyd that the original draft would &quot;create enormous community reaction which will be particularly unhelpful at this time&quot;. The land sales account for the entirety of the Magill campus and approximately 50% of the Mawson Lakes campus.

== Tram stop ==
The university is served by two stops on the Glenelg tram line, &quot;University&quot; and &quot;City West&quot;, which connects the &quot;City East&quot; and &quot;City West&quot; campuses respectively along North Terrace.

<text>West End Games (WEG) was a company that made board, role-playing, and war games. It was founded by Daniel Scott Palter in 1974 in New York City, but later moved to Honesdale, Pennsylvania. Its product lines included &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Paranoia&quot;, &quot;Torg&quot;, &quot;DC Universe&quot;, and &quot;Junta&quot;.

== History ==

Scott Palter received a JD from Stanford in 1972 and joined the New York State Bar before he began work at the family firm, Bucci Imports. Drawing on this financial connection, Palter was able to found West End Games, named after the bar in which the meeting that finalized its founding occurred: the West End Bar near Columbia University.

Initially a producer of board wargames, In 1983, Palter hired Ken Rolston, Eric Goldberg and Greg Costikyan as game designers, and WEG&#x27;s focus turned away from traditional wargames. Costikyan&#x27;s 1983 game &quot;Bug-Eyed Monsters&quot; brought WEG into the science-fiction and fantasy genres. Then Costikyan and Goldberg brought Palter a manuscript for a role-playing game that originally had been conceived by their friend Dan Gelber. Palter agreed to buy the rights to the game, and after some editing and polishing by Rolston, it was released at Gencon in 1984 as WEG&#x27;s first role-playing game, &quot;Paranoia&quot;. In 1985, &quot;Paranoia&quot; won WEG an Origins Award for &quot;Best Roleplaying Rules of 1984&quot;.

The high production values demanded by the wargames industry made them one of the few companies who could compete with TSR, and they were able to acquire the license from Columbia Pictures to produce an RPG based on the film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. This game, &quot;Ghostbusters: A Frightfully Cheerful Roleplaying Game&quot;, formed the basis of the D6 System which was to be heavily used in many of their licensed products.

In 1987, the company released their &quot;Star Wars&quot; role-playing game. Since the films had been released some years previously, and there was (at the time) no new media forthcoming, the success of these books came as a surprise. The game established much of the groundwork of what later became the &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe. Lucasfilm considered their sourcebooks so authoritative that when Timothy Zahn was hired to write what became the Thrawn trilogy, he was sent a box of West End Games &quot;Star Wars&quot; books and directed to utilize the background material presented within. Zahn&#x27;s trilogy, in turn, renewed interest in the franchise and provided further sales for West End Games, which released sourcebooks for Zahn&#x27;s three novels from 1992 to 1994.

1990 saw the release of the &quot;Torg&quot; roleplaying game, followed in 1994 by the Masterbook system, which was mostly used in licensed RPG adaptations: &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, &quot;Necroscope&quot;, &quot;Species&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, &quot;Tank Girl, and The World of Aden&quot;. Another licensed game, the &quot;Hercules &amp; Xena Roleplaying Game&quot;, was the last title released by the initial version of the company: in July 1998, West End Games went into bankruptcy, following mismanagement between West End Games and its then-parent company, shoe importer Bucci Retail Group. When the parent company filed for bankruptcy, West End Games was forced to go under as well, despite an attempt by Palter to perform a Chapter 11 reorganization of the company&#x27;s finances. As a result, former WEG designers Costikyan and Goldberg took Palter to court over ownership of &quot;Paranoia&quot;, and in 2000, the courts ruled that the license should revert to Costikyan and Goldberg.

===D6 Legends===

The bankrupt West End Games became WEG / Creative Design Group while a new West End Games (D6 Legends, Inc.) was formed in partnership with Yeti, a French design house and publisher and subsidiary of Humanoids Publishing, in March 1999. Under court supervision, WEG/Creative Design Group sold off product and assets to pay off debt. WEG/Creative Design Group sold to the new company intellectual property, the &quot;Paranoia&quot; licensing contracts, and the trademarks. Licensing contracts for &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Xena&quot; remained with Creative Design Group, though the &quot;Star Wars&quot; license was soon lost to Wizards of the Coast, who released their own &quot;Star Wars&quot; game in 2000.

At the 1999 GAMA Trade Show, the new West End Games announced a third edition of &quot;Paranoia&quot; for late June or early July of that year, followed by a &quot;Bug Sector&quot; supplement, but these were never released. The DC Universe license was acquired and a new RPG was also announced at that time, which was published in 1999.

As Humanoids Publishing was the publisher of the &quot;Metabarons&quot; graphic novels, they utilized the D6 System to release an RPG based upon that setting. The project was a commercial failure, and Humanoids Publications decided to exit from the role-playing game market and sell off West End Games at the end of 2002.

On July 1, 2002, the company made its systems—D6 Classic, D6 Legend, MasterBook, and Torg—available via license to any publisher.

=== Purgatory Publishing ===

In November 2003 West End Games was bought by Eric J. Gibson&#x27;s Purgatory Publishing. He moved the company to Downingtown, Pennsylvania, in 2004. Under his tenure, &quot;Torg&quot; received a revised edition and a generic version of the D6 System was produced, which led to a line of irregularly produced supplements and met with general approval from fans. However, this did not translate into high sales; in a post on the official West End forums in 2008 Gibson announced that none of the D6 products produced since he acquired West End had turned a profit, and West End&#x27;s other RPG lines were not performing as well as he had expected, leading to losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

West End also expanded back into board games, beginning with a new edition of &quot;Junta&quot;, which according to Gibson was one of the few products that did turn a profit.

In 2007, the company announced a new science-fiction RPG by Bill Coffin called &quot;Septimus&quot;, offering preorders, but following delays it was publicly cancelled by Gibson in March 2008. Gibson stated in July 2008 that West End Games could not afford to provide refunds to customers who preordered the cancelled &quot;Septimus&quot; product, and indeed could not even afford to pay the postage to ship books to individuals who were willing to accept a refund in the form of products instead of money. Following the &quot;Septimus&quot; cancellation and fan backlash, Gibson said that he was planning on selling all of WEG&#x27;s properties, although this did not occur at that time. WEG eventually released &quot;Septimus&quot; via PDF and print on demand.

Gibson stated in a 2010 podcast interview that he was &quot;perhaps foolishly optimistic&quot; in assuming sales would be higher than they turned out to be because &quot;the name West End Games would carry a lot of weight&quot;. He further stated that this led him to print more books than he could sell, books which he eventually had to destroy in order to save on storage costs. Gibson planned to release the d6 System under the terms of the Open Gaming License (OGL) to increase sales but also &quot;to protect it from myself&quot;, meaning that if the company had to be sold or go out of business, the system would still be available to the general public. In 2009, West End Games moved forward with these plans, with the resulting license known as OpenD6.

Following the &quot;Septimus&quot; project, Purgatory Publishing sold off most of their properties. In June 2010, &quot;Torg&quot; was sold to German game company Ulisses Spiele, while in July 2010 the Masterbook system, &quot;Shatterzone&quot;, and &quot;Bloodshadows&quot; were sold to Precis Intermedia. West End Games itself and its remaining properties—which by then consisted primarily of the D6 System—was purchased in April 2016 by Nocturnal Media, White Wolf Publishing founder Stewart Wieck&#x27;s gaming company.

=== Nocturnal Media ===
Nocturnal intended to keep the West End Games brand alive, and their first project using this branding was a revised edition of Greg Costikyan&#x27;s 1984 WEG boardgame, &quot;Web and Starship&quot;. A Kickstarter was launched in April 2016 and was successfully funded, but the death of Nocturnal owner Stewart Wieck in June 2017 ultimately resulted in the cancellation of that project. A licensing deal to publish a Second Edition of the D6 System was made with Gallant Knight Games in October 2017.

Company founder Scott Palter fell ill and died on February 17, 2020.

<text>Arran distillery is a whisky distillery in Lochranza, Scotland, Isle of Arran.

In 1994 Arran Distillers was founded by Harold Currie, former director of Chivas and a D-Day veteran, with the intention of building a distillery on Arran. During the construction of the distillery, a pair of golden eagles built their nest on a cliff near the distillery; since golden eagles are a protected species, construction of the distillery was temporarily halted. The distillery, funded by private investors and the sale of bonds, opened in 1995.

There used to be about fifty distilleries on the island, but most of them were &quot;moonlight&quot; or illegal distilleries. The most recent legally founded distillery on Arran, called &quot;Lagg&quot; closed in 1837.

Until recently a proportion of the casks were stored in the warehouses of Springbank, due to a lack of room in the distillery, and the legal impossibility of extending the current warehouses at the Arran distillery. However, the distillery now has a storage warehouse, on site, that allows easier access to barrels. The distillery offers a cask purchase scheme which offers private individuals the opportunity to own their own cask of whisky, which can be stored on site at the distillery.

The Arran distillery is a patron of the World Robert Burns Federation and as such has created a Robert Burns single malt and Robert Burns blended whisky in honour of Scotland&#x27;s national poet. They are the only whisky distillery to be able to use the image and signature of Robert Burns on their packaging.

The whisky of Arran is mostly used to produce their single malt whisky, but a small proportion also goes into the production of their range of blended whiskies: Lochranza Blend, Robert Burns Blend and Arran Gold Single Malt Whisky Cream Liqueur.

The Arran distillery traded at a loss for many years until 2010. In 2003 Currie sold his shares and resigned from the board, the remaining shareholders own the business known as Isle of Arran Distillers Ltd., and the managing director is Euan Mitchell.

2010 saw the release of a 15th Anniversary bottling on the occasion of the distillery open day on 3 July. Autumn 2010 also saw the release of the first official 14-year-old to be released by the distillery. The first peated Arran single malt (called Machrie Moor) has been available since 8 December 2010.

The distillery celebrated its 21st anniversary in June 2016.

==Lagg==

Plans for the company to build a second distillery in Lagg at the south end of the island were approved in August 2016 and building work began on this project in October 2016. Lagg Distillery began production in April 2019 and opened its visitor center on 1 July 2019.

As the company has now opened a second distillery on the island, the distilleries are referred to as &#x27;Lochranza&#x27; and &#x27;Lagg&#x27;. In May 2020, a new blended whisky was announced which is made up from whisky from both of the Arran distilleries.

<doc id="335427" wikidata="Q2602871" url="?curid=335427" title="Erotophobia">
<text>Erotophobia is a term to describe a fear or aversion to sex or related matters. It was coined by a number of researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s to describe one pole on a continuum of attitudes and beliefs about sexuality. The word is derived from the name of Eros, the Greek god of erotic love, and Phobos (), the god of fear. The model of the continuum is a basic polarized line, with erotophobia (fear of sex or negative attitudes about sex) at one end and erotophilia (positive feelings or attitudes about sex) at the other end.

==Types==
Erotophobia has many manifestations. An individual or culture can have one or multiple erotophobic attitudes. Some types of erotophobia include fear of nudity, fear of sexual images, negative attitudes towards homosexuality, negative attitudes towards people with STIs, fear of sex education, fear of sexual discourse.

==Clinical significance==
As a clinical phobia, &quot;erotophobia&quot; describes an irrational and potentially debilitating fear of some object, person or act that is related to sex. This fear either impairs a person&#x27;s desire or ability to have sexual relationships, or completely prevents a person&#x27;s ability to have sex. Erotophobia can also in some (but not all) individual cases, be a part of larger patterns of any of the following psychological problems—social phobia, avoidant personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or general social anxiety problems. Erotophobia can also, for others, be very specific to love making with another person and not be related to any of these other social anxiety disorders. In the case of specific erotophobia, only the fear of something related to sex would be present without any other fears or syndromes.

==Psychological studies==
In psychological studies, the term is often used to describe degree of (general) sexual aversion versus (general) interest in sex. In this sense erotophobia is descriptive of one&#x27;s place in a range on a continuum of sexual feeling or aversion to feeling. Erotophobes score high on one end of the scale that is characterized by expressions of guilt and fear about sex. Psychologists sometimes attempt to describe sexuality on a personality scale. Erotophobes are less likely to talk about sex, have more negative reactions to sexually explicit material, and have sex less frequently and with fewer partners over time. In contrast, erotophiles score high on the opposite end of the scale, erotophilia, which is characterized by expressing less guilt about sex, talking about sex more openly, and holding more positive attitudes toward sexually explicit material.

The continuum of attitudes between Erotophilia and Eurotophobia has been used to assess attitudes to sex and sexuality. Research on this continuum has shown a correlation between high erotophobia scores and less willingness to use condoms (but not necessarily other contraceptive methods), and less knowledge of topics relating to sex.

It is also important because erotophobia has been shown to create relationship and marital difficulties in multiple studies, dating back to Kinsey.

== Political use ==
In his book &quot;The Politics of Lust&quot;, author and sexual activist John Ince examines three distinct cause and effect forces that fuel erotophobia: &quot;antisexualism&quot;, the irrational negative response to harmless sexual expression; &quot;nasty sex&quot;, which includes rape and violent pornography; and &quot;rigidity&quot;, the inability to enjoy &quot;playful and spontaneous&quot; sex. Ince also argues that social inequality and politics are interlinked with erotophobia and that overcoming erotophobia is one of the first steps to a truly democratic society.

<text>Dutton Speedwords, transcribed in Speedwords as &#x27;, is an international auxiliary language as well as an abbreviated writing system using the English alphabet for all the languages of the world. It was devised by Reginald J. G. Dutton (1886–1970) who initially ran a shorthand college promoting Dutton Shorthand (a geometric script), then offered a mail order (correspondence) self-education course in Speedwords while still supporting the Dutton Shorthand. The business was continued by his daughter Elizabeth after his death.

==Requirements for communication==
Any transcription, note taking or correspondence system must fulfill six requirements (Oliver, 2019, Micro-intellectual capital: A case study of Dutton Speedwords):

# Rules for ensuring an agreed vocabulary, how additions are included, and, how technical terms are expressed 
# Systematic method for representing the vocabulary including abbreviations or contractions or truncations, particularly where literal transcription is necessary
# A pronunciation system that makes the vocalisation meaningful
# A meaningful word order
# Rule for designating or rejecting parts of speech
# A method for learning the new system of communication

Ideally, these requirements should not be wholly biased toward English but consider European, Asian and Middle East languages.

The system of Speedwords created over 50 years by Dutton addresses all these requirements. Other systems have copied the solutions devised by Dutton without greatly improving his approach. One major advantage of Dutton&#x27;s Speedwords is that it is readily available to everyone. Its current competitors either require pre-payment for materials before revealing the full details of their system, or, have system that is a subset of the words necessary for a complete system.

==Objectives of Speedwords==
Over time, three objectives were claimed by Dutton for Speedwords:

Initially, Dutton proposed Speedwords as an International Auxiliary Language (often abbreviated IAL) to encourage people to communicate internationally. Dutton wanted to provide a system that a sender could use which did not require them to learn the (foreign) language used by the recipient before establishing communication. Speedwords achieves this by relying on a deliberately small vocabulary. For international communication, the writer and reader are different, so, it is important that communication is unambiguous.

Then Dutton promoted Speedwords for high-speed writing. This used ideas and experience based on Dutton Shorthand. Dutton developed this stenographic method between 1919 and 1926. This approach also assumed that the writer and reader were different.

Up to this time, Speedwords avoided synonyms. Synonyms are variants of the same English word and treated them as equivalent. There are two possibilities: 
* One Speedword for different parts of speech. For example, refers to sincere, sincerely, sincerity. 
* The same Speedword covers several different English words (e.g., means class, kind, or sort. There are also derivatives of Speedwords (e.g., means life but there is also lively, vital, creature, welfare, spirit, death, fatal, kill, murder.

Later, realising that some writing required literal transcription, Dutton expanded the vocabulary to allow words which are synonyms that were required to precisely distinguish shades of meaning. Dutton offered two methods to distinguish these synonyms which were required for literal transcription. The first was to use an initial capital letter. The capital letter indicates the Speedword is being used to denote a specific word not the range of words covered by a Speedword. These were officially recognised by being listed in the Speedwords Dictionary. The second method was to underline the Speedword. Dutton does not detail how this would work so it is assumed that this was left to the discretion of the Speedwords user.

Finally, Dutton promoted Speedwords for individual (personal) note writing and note reading. This approach assumed that the writer and reader were mostly the same person. Dutton encouraged this group of users to adopt some personal conventions to adapt it to their personal needs (e.g., underlining). The widely available &quot;Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords&quot; (original 1951 edition and revised 1971 edition, but paragraph 4 in both editions) was focused on the note-taking and note-making objective although Dutton still claimed it could also be used to fulfill the other objectives.

See below for how these objectives were used to construct Speedwords.

==Usage==

There are three possible uses: writing, speaking including dictation, and, note taking.

=== Writing ===
This was the original use intended by Dutton. Speedwords would allow peoples with different national languages to communicate using Speedwords as the medium. This would be accomplished because it had a compact vocabulary and rigid meanings to avoid ambiguity. All versions of Speedwords were customised for writing and minimising the number of letters that had to be written.

===Speaking including dictation===
Criticisms in 1935-6 of the predecessor of Speedwords (called International 2 Letter Script which had many combinations of consonants) were focused on the difficulty in pronouncing strings of consonants. Speedwords overcame this deficiency.

===Note taking===
&quot;Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords&quot; adapted Speedwords to note taking. It modified the standard Speedwords from written correspondence without any time pressure to allow taking notes at high speed.

==Competitors to Speedwords==
There are three competitors to Speedwords. They are (1) shorthand as simplified letterforms, (2) shorthand as picture symbols, and (3) shorthand using non-stenographic systems (that is, alphabetic characters).

Simplified letterforms are also called stenographic shorthand systems. One type of letterform geometric is based on circles, parts of circles, and straight lines placed strictly horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The most popular example is Pitman shorthand released 1837, and many lesser-known systems such as Boyd&#x27;s syllabic shorthand originally published 1903, as well as predecessor systems such as Duployan Shorthand. These use symbols which do not represent letters, but rather sounds so the words are written more or less as they are spoken. Contrasted with geometric are script shorthands that are oriented around the movement of the hand when writing. The original is Gabelsberger shorthand which began in Germany and spread through Europe. Script-geometric, or semi-script, shorthands are a hybrid of geometric systems and the script systems. The notable example is Gregg shorthand first published in 1888. Other examples include Superwrite, Easyscript, Keyscript, Speedwriting, Quickscript, Breviogrph, Stenoscript ABC, and Teeline.

Picture symbols were proposed by Austrian Charles K. Bliss (1897–1985) who created Blissymbolics in 1949 as a universal written language for speakers of any language to learn and communicate. It avoided the problems of constructed quasi-European language like Esperanto, or, natural languages such as English. Blissymbolics was conceived as a purely visual, speech-less language but provided a basic vocabulary that could be spoken.

Non-stenographic systems or alphabetic systems may also supplement the alphabetic characters by using punctuation marks as additional characters, give different meanings when letters are capitalised, or add non-alphabetic symbols. The most popular of these is Esperanto. Dutton contrasted Speedwords with its major rival Esperanto by claiming correctly that Speedwords had a smaller vocabulary and did not require the extensive study that was required to converse or write Esperanto. Another rapid writing system with a similar name, Speedwriting (also called Brief English Systems), was invented by Emma Dearborn at Simmons College, Columbia University and published in 1925. Her method used letters of the alphabet and some punctuation marks to represent the sounds of English which could be reproduced on the typewriter. Dearborn initially franchised teaching and then sold the rights which passed between various companies who made further changes and marketed it throughout the US and in various languages (e.g., Spanish). Other methods included Personal Shorthand also known as Briefscript, and Keyscript. Forkner Shorthand was promoted as an alternative to Pitman shorthand from 1955–1995 but is no longer taught.

The benchmark for pronunciation is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) produced by the International Phonetic Association. It is easily printable by hand or keyboard although its conventions are often not used to depict pronunciation in dictionaries and other reference materials.

The major reason that Dutton Speedwords continues to receive attention is its strict alphabetical constraint that allows it to be used on a keyboard, and the breadth of practical application which Dutton embodied in his system.

==Design of Speedwords==
The design of Speedwords has four features:

# Unlike other shorthand methods, (e.g., Pitman, Gregg) which use new symbols, strokes or geometric shapes, Speedwords method uses the 26 letters of the English alphabet (upper and lower case) plus the ampersand symbol (&#x27;&amp;&#x27;). 
# Unlike most other shorthand and rapid writing methods, Speedwords has its roots in a shorthand system that Dutton found cumbersome and which he believed he overcame by using alphabetic characters.
# Unlike other shorthand and rapid writing systems, Dutton emphasised the speed of learning.
# Like other shorthand systems, Dutton sought to maximise speed and minimise the amount of writing.

==Principles of Speedwords==
In all publications, Dutton describes various principles of Speedwords but there is no consolidated list of principles. They can be summarised as:

# Select its vocabulary from the entire Indo-European language family, particularly maximising the internationality of words, that is, selecting a word that is common between languages, (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951, page 90).
# Abbreviate those words guided by a 1925 analysis by Horn on the frequency of words. The most frequently used words were allocated the shortest abbreviation. So the most frequent words have just one letter (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951, page 5).
# Structure the vocabulary around high frequency words. A 1,000 word vocabulary handles 85% of daily conversation while a 3,000 word vocabulary handles 98% of daily conversation so Speedwords only needs a simple rule for 2% of its vocabulary. Dutton seems to suggest that the solution is to write out the word in full.
# Make one Speedword have only one meaning which results in a basic vocabulary which Dutton calls &#x27;keywords&#x27; (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 7).
# Avoid grammatical differences, so a keyword can also refer to noun, verb, adjective, adverb (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 5).
# Create other meanings by adding suffixes to show relationships or create antonyms (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 3).

While this approach is sound, it has both advantages and a few disadvantages discussed below.

Speedwords was meant to be written and spoken, so Dutton provided some guidelines on pronunciation which is included below.

==Advantages==
In Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, Dutton claims at least eight benefits from Speedwords:

# Knowing just a few Speedwords (he means the one letter Speedwords) allows immediate savings in time and effort (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords 1951, page 7). The words can be substituted for the English equivalents as the Speedwords vocabulary is learnt. This contrasts with geometric shorthand shapes that require the entire system to be mastered.
# It uses the English alphabet. This means it Speedwords can be written or typed (TYDS, page 8).
# It uses a range of Indo-European words. So, its vocabulary has an &quot;international currency&quot; (page 87). 
# Speedwords are chosen based on the frequency of usage. This means that the most frequently used words are the shortest (TYDS, page 7).
# Correspondence can be exchanged although the individual writers without having to learn the foreign language of all their many correspondents. This means the writers can be ignorant of the language of their correspondent (TYDS, page 8).
# Knowing speed words takes between 20 and 30 hours (TYDS, pages 9, 90). The work of learning &quot;is a fascinating pastime and in no sense an arduous task&quot; (TYDS, page 9)
# Speedwords makes 5 out of 6 words far shorter (page 87). This increases the speed of writing and note taking approximately 100-120 words per minute (page 137) or up to 150 wpm (page 8).
# The &#x27;hurdle&#x27; to overcome language barriers is considerably reduced because the Speedwords vocabulary is small. The basic vocabulary is 493 words (page 89). The more extensive vocabulary is 1,000 words (page 142)

==Disadvantages==
The disadvantages appear to be:

# No-one is developing Speedwords. So authoritative information about it is now hard to find, except for the Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords book. Some have taken Speedwords and adapted it. For example, see Briefscript by Ray Brown at 
# The Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book does not have a full discussion of pronunciation. Dutton suggests is essential to using Speedwords. Hearsay is that Dutton had a simplified pronunciation system which may have been shared with some inquirers after his death, but it was never published
# Dutton did not disclose the rules he used to formulate Speedwords. So there are several apparent anomalies and obscurities. Also, Dutton appears to make arbitrary decisions on the choice of a Speedword. For example, on page 25 Dutton states that &#x27;ao&#x27; means &#x27;away&#x27; although &#x27;ax&#x27; would be logical. However, &#x27;ax&#x27; has already been used to mean &#x27;ask&#x27;. This shows that over 50 years Dutton had not reached 100% perfection of his system. This is consistent with the effort required to be expended to fully complete as shown by the Pareto Principle. Also, on TYDS, page 25 Dutton used the Speedword &#x27;dy&#x27; for since but gives the rationale French &#x27;depuis&#x27; but it does not contain &#x27;y&#x27; and in French could also translate to &#x27;for&#x27; which already has the Speedword &#x27;f&#x27;.
# Some guidelines stated in Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book are difficult to apply. For example, Dutton allows the reader to use synonyms for the basic Speedwords and distinguishes them from the basic speedwords by capitalising their first letter. Also, for example, English &#x27;at&#x27; becomes the Speedword &#x27;A&#x27; because Speedword &#x27;a&#x27; means &#x27;to&#x27; (TYDS, page72). 
# Dutton says the reader can create their own supplementary list but does not detail how this is done or how she or he manages it.

None of these disadvantages prevent its successful use for personal note taking.

==Achievements of Dutton==
Dutton Speedwords continues to be used to despite its orphan status because of his useful qualities:

# Dutton kept the vocabulary compact. This was achieved by using frequency of use as the criterion.
# Dutton provided a proven learning approach which makes it easy to master. He emphasised incremental learning with repetition.
# Dutton persevered with it over a long period. During the period 1933–1970 (until his death) it was refined with his personal experience and feedback from adopters and students.

==Evolution of speedwords==
It appears that Speedwords developed in five main stages:

# As a competitor to Pitman and Gregg shorthand. Based on the available Dutton shorthand publications held in libraries this occurred 1919–1925. At this point, it was a geometric shorthand method that competed with Pitman and Gregg shorthand methods and did not use the English alphabet.
# Under the influence of Horn&#x27;s frequently used words list, an early attempt was made to develop an alternate international abbreviated language. Dutton expressed this in his one-page sheet called International 2-letter correspondence symbols (published 1933).
# Further development occurred to create an alternate international language. It began in 1935 when International 2-letter correspondence symbols were revised and reissued in 1935 as International Symbolic Script. Another version called Word Speedwords was published between 1941–1945 (page 18 of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords). There is a booklet of the same name published in 1946 which appears to contain 100 Speedwords. Despite attempts by Dutton to popularise World Speedwords it was not adopted as an international language. The intention expressed on page 88 in Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords (1951) to produce language-specific versions of the Speedwords course, did not eventuate. It appears another variation called Dutton Youth Speedwords was published in 1943. Both World Speedwords and Speedwords used words from Flemish (Dutch), French, German, Greek, Latin, Portuguese, Scandinavia, Slav, and Spanish are sources for both World Speedwords and Speedwords (According to pages 8, and 88 of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951 and 1971).
# By 1946 it had been renamed Speedwords. By 1951 Dutton conceded that Speedwords was ideal for individual note taking and note making (page 7 Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords) and made some variations to Word Speedwords to adapt it for the new purpose (page 8 Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords). His audience is, therefore, students and time-poor people seeking to make the best use of their time or people who incur high costs in communication. He comments that he hopes that &quot;the student who has worked through the present course will look to this wide horizon (page 88) that is, international communication so Dutton always maintained his duality of objectives and functions.
# It has been revived from time to time in its own right as well as with adaptations. The Dutton Society (no longer extant) promoted Speedwords. Some time management writers and computer specialists who describe online applications including e-mail and situations where communication is either slow or expensive.

==Foreign-language versions of Speedwords==
In Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords (page 88), Dutton says that &quot;It is intended to publish this Speedwords course in all the major languages of both hemispheres.&quot;

This did not occur. It is unclear whether the impediment was (a) problems that equivalents (including the use of suffixes) were not suitable in foreign languages, (b) authors of the foreign-language versions of Speedwords were not forthcoming, (c) lack of a publisher, or (d) anomalies and difficulties became apparent when Speedwords was translated, making the English- and foreign-language version no longer uniform.

==Sources describing Dutton Speedwords==
There are three main sources of information about Speedwords: (1) Speedwords booklets/pamphlets issued by Dutton, (2) the Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book in the Teach Yourself series and (3) third party publications, commentaries and webpages (see the references).

===Dutton booklets/pamphlets===

All the Dutton Speedwords booklets published between 1933 and 1951 are out of print. Very few libraries show holdings of copies. Helpful booklets used in preparing this page were the Speedwords dictionary. It consists of 4,000 basic and with derivatives 10,000 English-Speedword and Speedword-English words.

=== &quot;Teach Yourself Speedwords&quot; (1951, 1962, 1971, 1973) ===
A more accessible version focused on note taking and note making called Dutton Speedwords was published in 1951 in the Teach Yourself series published by English Universities Press as a hardcover. It was reprinted in 1959 and 1962 (with the distinctive yellow dustjacket for both years).

A revised edition was published in 1971. It was reissued in 1973 as a paperback. The only revisions made in 1971 were in Part 1 of the high-speed vocabulary appendix (pages 137–147). Part 2 of the High-Speed appendix which is aimed solely at English speakers was unchanged between the original 1951 and revised 1971 editions. Copies of the 1951 and 1971 editions are relatively easy to find second hand. The 1951 edition and its 1962 reprint are printed on higher quality paper than the updated 1971/1973 edition which has yellowed pages that easily tear.

Both 1951 and 1971 editions have misprints. This is an incomplete list:

# Paragraph number 83 occurs twice: once in Lesson 8, and, also in the High-Speed Appendix.
# Lists in Speedwords are frequently not in alphabetical order: for example, &#x27;fon&#x27; and &#x27;for&#x27; in the Alphabetic Speedwords list is out of order (page 94).

===Third party publications, commentaries, and webpages===
The references below list some third-party publications and commentaries that are still available. (However, as noted below in the section on teaching/learning many promoters of Dutton Speedwords have an incomplete understanding of its use.)

Many authoritative webpages produced in the late 1990s and early 2000s are no longer available as the domain URL is defunct. These missing webpages included:

* Material made available by the Dutton Society
* Robert Petry pages when he was promoting Speedwords in approximately 1997
* Pages by the New Congress/Der Neue Kongress s.Z. who promised a new revised edition of Dutton&#x27;s Speedwords. However, there is no record of a library holding the reissued publication by New Congress/Der Neue Kongress s.Z.

==Timeline of Speedwords &amp; Publication dates==
Dutton was assiduous in developing Speedwords and its predecessor Dutton shorthand. After developing Dutton shorthand, Dutton continued to improve it. But then realising the shortcomings of using shorthand, Dutton develops Dutton Shorthand. Dutton Shorthand was also revised many times. Dutton never gave up refining Speedwords, advocating its merits, and offering it for sale and as a correspondence course.

Below is a selection of publications that Dutton produced over his lifetime.

===Transition from Shorthand to Speedwords===
: 1933 International 2 Letter Script. Skegness: Dutton&#x27;s.
: 1935 reprint (?) of International 2 Letter Script
This publication is described by Dutton in an article to the Royal Society. It uses one letter of the English alphabet which was assigned to a class of meaning, apparently directly inspired by Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus. There was no pronunciation system and criticisms of this omission resulted in Speedwords.

: 1973 Reprint of the 1971 edition of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords

==Size of Speedwords vocabulary==
Dutton variously suggests the size of the Speedwords vocabulary ranges from 493 to 10,000:
* 493 Speedwords. These are Speedword stems or elements (TYDS, page 88, 89, 137).
* 1,000 Speedwords. These are the most frequently used words (TYDS, page 141).
* 4,000 Speedwords. These are the words in the Speedwords Dictionary (TYDS, page 87).
* 10,000 Speedwords. These are derivatives of Speedwords (TYDS, page 91).

===Method of teaching/learning===
Speedwords was taught as a correspondence course by both Dutton and his daughter in the pre and post World War 2 period. Their course was supported by an extensive array of booklets that he had developed. Many of the booklets are listed in the timeline section. The option of enrolling in a course offered directly by Dutton&#x27;s organisation or third parties is no longer available.

Several system such as Forkner shorthand emphasised replacing some longhand writing with shortcuts as soon as they begin studying the system. Many systems also claimed it was possible to achieve dictation rates above 50 words per minute. These all have learning times of a year or more.

Learning Dutton Speedwords takes around a week to a fortnight. In TYDS (page 9) Dutton cites data from his records which show that learning the takes between 20 and 24 hours with 30 hours being the maximum. To improve retention, Dutton agrees that individual Speedwords can be substituted one or two at a time. However, Dutton emphasises that the entire Speedwords system can be learnt quickly and therefore it is not necessary to learn it piecemeal.

Occasionally, a webpage author or blogger will provide a selective summary of Speedwords (typically, the one and two-letter Speedwords) together with some illustrations or highlights of the method. They are not recommended because they either mis-state Dutton or are incomplete. The chief characteristic of Dutton Speedwords is its detail and the extensive guidelines Dutton provides in his booklets.

===Resources for learning===

A few lucky people may be able to read some of the Speedwords booklets Dutton published between 1940–1951. The booklets promote the other booklets which were available but do not explain their interrelationship. So this is a brief description on how to use them. Essentially there are four interrelated booklets. All four are required. They are: (1) The &quot;textbook&quot;. (2) The &quot;companion&quot;. It provides additional exercises and the answers to exercises in the textbook. (3) The &quot;supplement&quot;. It provides further exercises with answers to enhance learning through additional practice (4) The bi-lingual vocabulary. This is an alphabetic list of Speedwords (between 3,00 and 10,000 depending upon the edition) with their English equivalent, as well as an English-to-Speedwords lookup list. The vocabulary contains an introductory commentary by Dutton which is valuable for understanding and using the dictionary. Depending upon when they were published, they may be called &quot;Dutton Speedwords, &quot;Dutton Double Speedwords&quot;, &quot;Duttom Youth Speedwords&quot; or &quot;Dutton World Speeedwords&quot;. They were published at different times with different titles and contain minor differences. There is usually more than one edition of each. Later editions (1946 or preferably 1951) are the most complete and up-to-date. They usually contain an explanation of any changes made in the latest edition.

The most common authoritative source is &quot;Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords&quot;. It is focused on note taking (page 2, paragraph 4). It contains eight lessons, an appendix and a dictionary with about 1,00 speedwords.

==International versus English/domestic use of Speedwords==
One important factor that can affect learning is whether communication is between speakers of Indo-European languages. Learning Speedwords is affected by background. It is oriented to the English language in its vocabulary and sentence construction. Dutton claims (TYDS, page 90) that memorisation will be slower for non-Indo-European language speakers, they will be able to extend their vocabulary as easily once the vocabulary is mastered. This means the learner must always be conscious of whether Dutton is describing Speedwords to be used in international communication or the English only use.

The English-only use makes concessions that are counterproductive to international communication. Those concessions can be summarised as:

# Using selected synonyms found in English which are designated by the word being given a capital letter. For example, &#x27;O&#x27; for &#x27;sir&#x27; (TYDS, page 35, para 35).
# Recognising an even wider range of synonyms and additional words that are not distinguished in any way from the internationally usable Speedwords (See, for example, TYDS, pages 148-154).
# Abbreviating some Speedwords (contractions) which may be inconsistent with international use. For example, &#x27;Bil&#x27; for &#x27;bill&#x27; when there already is &#x27;bil&#x27; used for &#x27;account&#x27;.
# Using Speedwords with abbreviations which will be meaningless in international use. For example, omit the &#x27;i&#x27; from &#x27;bil&#x27; (TYDS, page 141, para 85).
# Creating compounds with additional suffixes. For example, the new suffix &#x27;-c&#x27; is used to -tion, tious, -cious, -tial, ture, -sure while &#x27;-m&#x27; is used to express -ment, (TYS, page 152, rule 14).
# Creating compounds of Speedwords which may be inconsistent with international use. For example, &#x27;ze&#x27; + &#x27;nav&#x27; is abbreviated &#x27;zev&#x27; (page 56, para 60).
Consequently, the learner of Speedwords needs to be aware that some of the extensions they make and use, may inhibit rather than facilitate international communication.

==Lexicon==
The principle behind the choice of word roots of Dutton Speedwords is the maxim that frequently used words should be shorter than seldom-used words in order to speed up communication (see information theory). There are 493 one-, two- and three-letter roots. The 46 most frequent English words are equated with 27 one-letter Speedword roots also called parent words in the Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book:

:&quot;a&quot; &quot;at, to&quot; (&lt; French &quot;à&quot;)
:&quot;b&quot; &quot;but, butt&quot; (&lt; English)
:&quot;c&quot; &quot;this&quot; (&lt; French &quot;ce&quot;)
:&quot;d&quot; &quot;of, from&quot; (&lt; French &quot;de&quot;)
:&quot;e&quot; &quot;to be, is, am, are&quot; (&lt; French &quot;est&quot;)
:&quot;f&quot; &quot;for&quot; (&lt; English)
:&quot;g&quot; &quot;they, them&quot;
:&quot;h&quot; &quot;has, have&quot; (&lt; English?)
:&quot;i&quot; &quot;in, within&quot; (&lt; English)
:&quot;j&quot; &quot;I, me&quot; (&lt; French &quot;je&quot;)
:&quot;k&quot; &quot;that&quot; [conjunction] (&lt; French &quot;que&quot;)
:&quot;l&quot; &quot;the&quot; (&lt; French &quot;le&quot;)
:&quot;m&quot; &quot;with&quot; (&lt; German &quot;mit&quot;)
:&quot;n&quot; &quot;no, not&quot; (&lt; English)
:&quot;o&quot; &quot;on&quot; (&lt; English)
:&quot;p&quot; &quot;can, to be able&quot; (&lt; French &quot;peut&quot;)
:&quot;q&quot; &quot;do (question particle), question, query&quot; (&lt; English)
:&quot;r&quot; &quot;will, shall&quot; (&lt; ?)
:&quot;s&quot; &quot;he, him&quot; (&lt; French &quot;se&quot;)
::&quot;sh&quot; &quot;she, her&quot; (&lt; English)
:&quot;t&quot; &quot;it&quot; (&lt; English)
:&quot;u&quot; &quot;a, an, one&quot; (&lt; Latin &quot;unus&quot;)
:&quot;v&quot; &quot;you&quot; (&lt; French &quot;vous&quot;)
:&quot;w&quot; &quot;we, us&quot; (&lt; English)
:&quot;x&quot; &quot;whether, if&quot; 
:&quot;y&quot; &quot;was, were&quot; 
:&quot;z&quot; &quot;as, then&quot; (&lt; English? &quot;zen&quot;?)
:&quot;&amp;&quot; &quot;and&quot; (&lt; English)

Some two- and three-letter words are

:good -- &quot;gu&quot;
:know -- &quot;sa&quot;
:love -- &quot;am&quot;
:beautiful -- &quot;bel&quot;
:language -- &quot;lin&quot;
:game, play -- &quot;lud&quot;

(Note that all but the first of these examples are taken from Latin roots —&quot;sapio&quot;, &quot;amo&quot;, &quot;bellus&quot;, &quot;lingua&quot;, &quot;ludus&quot;—as are &quot;room&quot; and &quot;sleep&quot; below—&quot;camera&quot; and &quot;dormio&quot;—while &quot;good&quot; and the root for &quot;air&quot; below come from German: &quot;gut&quot;, &quot;luft&quot;.)

The few hundred roots are combined through the use of affixes to expand vocabulary. For example: the affix &quot;-a&quot; indicates an unfavorable connotation to the root-word; thus, &quot;bixy&quot; = kill, &quot;bixya&quot; = murder. Some compounds appear fanciful, or at least not immediately transparent, such as &quot;ky + luf&quot; (eat + air) to mean &quot;picnic&quot;. Grammatical features include the use of single letters (as opposed to verb conjugations) to indicate tense; the letter &quot;r&quot; indicates future tense and &quot;y&quot; indicates past. Thus, &quot;j sa&quot; = I know, &quot;j ysa&quot; = I knew, &quot;j r sa&quot; = I will know. Nouns and verbs have the same form (as do many English words: the light, I light, etc.) as do adverbs and adjectives (&quot;bel&quot; = &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;beautifully&quot;). Compounds follow a headnoun-modifier sequence, as in &quot;ca + dor&quot; (room + sleep) = bedroom.

==Phonology and orthography==
Dutton orthography is irregular. It is combined with phonology below.

===Stress===
Stress is on the first syllable (first vowel), except that the opposite suffix &quot;-o&quot; is always stressed, and the verbal prefixes &quot;u-&quot; (present participle) and &quot;y-&quot; (past tense) are never stressed.

===Vowels===
Vowels are rather similar to Latin. When a vowel occurs at the end of a morpheme or before another vowel, it is long, otherwise, it is usually short (though some suffixes shorten a preceding morpheme-final vowel).

Vowel length for the most part not phonemic, but are determined by position. However, there is morphophonemic contrast in a few cases where a root word contrasts with a suffixed word, with suffixes that do not shorten the vowel. For example,
:&quot;pad&quot; &quot;paid&quot; (&quot;pa&quot; &quot;pay&quot; + &quot;-d&quot; passive participle) vs &quot;pad&quot; &quot;pad&quot;;
:&quot;sud&quot; &quot;improved&#x27; (&quot; &quot;su&quot; + &quot;-d&quot; passive participle) vs &quot;sud&quot; &quot;sudden&quot;.

Only &quot;au&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are diphthongs. Other sequences of vowels are pronounced in separate syllables, e.g. &quot;eis&quot; &quot;ice&quot; is . Vowel sequences in roots are &quot;ei, eu, oi, oe, ui, ue, ia, io, iu&quot;. The sequences &quot;ie, uo&quot; are found in written contractions, but may not be pronounced that way since all written contractions should be pronounced in full.

&quot;Y&quot; is a consonant in &quot;ye&quot; &quot;yes&quot; and in &quot;y&quot; &quot;was, were&quot; only.

===Consonants===
Consonants are mostly as in the IPA; e.g., &quot;s&quot; is always voiceless, as in &quot;less&quot;, &quot;g&quot; is always hard, as in &quot;get&quot;, and &quot;r&quot; is trilled, as in Scots and Italian. Exceptions:
*&quot;c&quot; is (as in &quot;itch&quot;)
*&quot;j&quot; is (as in French)
*&quot;q&quot; is (as in &quot;quick&quot;)
*&quot;sh&quot; is (as in English)
*&quot;x&quot; is (as in English)

Words spelled as a single consonant are usually pronounced as that consonant plus a &quot;very short ee&quot; before a vowel, and as that consonant + schwa otherwise, clearly mirroring Dutton&#x27;s pronunciation of the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;the.&quot; The suffixes &quot;-r&quot; (agent) and &quot;-z&quot; (plural) are pronounced with a preceding schwa when they follow a consonant.

 do not occur in final position. only occurs in final position in an unwritten affix. A nasal occurs (in final position only) in two affixes, but is not written in either. (See below.) occurs initially in just two words, &quot;ye&quot; and &quot;y&quot;; finally it arguably ends the diphthong &quot;y&quot;. The letter &quot;w&quot; does not occur in final position, but arguably ends the diphthong &quot;au&quot;.

Consonant sequences in word-initial position are &quot;bl, br, pl, pr, dr, tr, gl, gr, kl, kr, fl, fr, sl, q&quot; [kw], &quot;sp, st&quot;. The only consonant sequence in root-medial position is &quot;tt&quot; in &quot;otto&quot; &quot;eight&quot;. Consonant sequences in word-final position are &quot;nd, nt, ng, lk, rb, rd, rt, rg, rk, rm, rn, st, sk, and x&quot; [ks]. But &quot;aq&quot;, though written with final consonant, is pronounced ).

===Unwritten consonants and vowels===
Some morphemes spelled with a single consonant have an unwritten vowel, and one prefix spelled with a single vowel has an unwritten consonant:
*&quot;b&quot; &quot;but&quot; is , as in English &quot;but&quot;
*&quot;-c&quot; (a suffix) is , as if it were written &quot;co&quot;. That is, &quot;lec&quot; &quot;mail&quot; is pronounced , not .
*&quot;f&quot; &quot;for&quot; is , as if it were written &quot;fro&quot;
*&quot;m&quot; &quot;with&quot; is , as if it were written &quot;mit&quot;
*&quot;n&quot; &quot;not&quot; is , as if it were written &quot;not&quot;
*&quot;-st&quot; &quot;-ist&quot; is , as if it were written &quot;ist&quot; 
*&quot;u-&quot; (participle) is 
*:(though &quot;having&quot; is &quot;hu&quot; rather than expected *uh)
*&quot;x&quot; &quot;if&quot; is , as if it were written &quot;ex&quot;
*&quot;y&quot; &quot;was/were&quot; is , as if it were written &quot;yo&quot; (with the &quot;y&quot; pronounced as a consonant)
*&quot;z&quot; &quot;as&quot; is , as if it were written &quot;zu&quot;
*&quot;&amp;&quot; &quot;and&quot; is , as if it were written &quot;and&quot;

In the versions of Speedwords prior to 1951, &quot;h&quot; &quot;have/has&quot; (perfect tense auxiliary) is , as if it were written &quot;hi&quot;; however, in the 1951 Dutton Speedwords Dictionary, we find that pre-1951 &quot;hid&quot; &quot;hide&quot; has become &quot;hi&quot; . It is very unlikely Dutton would have kept &quot;h&quot; and &quot;hi&quot; as homophones; but we are not told how &quot;h&quot; is now to be pronounced.

Note: &quot;h&quot; (and its past tense &quot;hy&quot; and present participle &quot;hu&quot;) is used only as an auxiliary verb; &quot;have/has&quot; in the sense of &quot;have/has got&quot; is &quot;ha&quot; 

Some suffixes have an unwritten vowel that only occurs after certain consonants. They are detailed below.

===Affixes===
As noted above, the prefixes past-tense &quot;y-&quot; and &quot;u-&quot; do not take stress, and &quot;u-&quot; is pronounced with an unwritten engma. &quot;Me-&quot; and &quot;my-&quot; also remain unstressed when forming comparatives and superlatives, e.g. &quot;mebel&quot; &quot;more beautiful&quot;, &quot;mybel&quot; &quot;most beautiful&quot;.

Suffixed vowels are long and take an epenthetic (English &quot;y&quot;) when following a vowel. For example, &quot;gree&quot; &quot;awfully, extremely&quot; (&lt; &quot;are + e&quot;) is pronounced , &quot;mua&quot; &quot;too (much)&quot; (&lt; &quot;mua + a&quot;) is and &quot;dau&quot; &quot;allow, grant&quot; (&lt; &quot;da + u&quot;) is 

The suffixes &quot;-n&quot; and &quot;-st&quot; are derived from the speedwords &quot;un&quot; &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;its&quot; &quot;professional&quot; and are always pronounced in full and take an epenthetic when following a vowel, e.g. &quot;gan&quot; &quot;scarcely&quot; (&lt; &quot;ga + n&quot;) is and &quot;rist&quot; &quot;clerk&quot; (&lt; &quot;ri + st&quot;) is .

The words &quot;co&quot; &quot;collect, collection&quot; and &quot;za&quot; &quot;dear, endearment, intimate&quot; may also be used as suffixes; if appended to a word ending in a vowel, they do not shorten that vowel, e.g. &quot;lec&quot; &quot;correspondence, mail&quot; is and &quot;perza&quot; &quot;dad(dy), papa&quot; is 

Suffixes pronounced as a single consonant after a vowel generally shorten that vowel. The exceptions are &quot;-d, -z, -r&quot;, which leave the vowel long. (As noted above, &quot;-z&quot; and &quot;-r&quot; take an epenthetic schwa after any consonant.) Many consonants are pronounced with an unwritten vowel after certain consonants:
*&quot;-d&quot; is pronounced after vowels and voiced consonants but &quot;d&quot;, and after &quot;d&quot; and voiceless consonants.
*&quot;-m&quot; (derived from the word &quot;om&quot; &quot;article, object, thing&quot;) shortens a preceding vowel and is pronounced after any consonant, e.g. &quot;dam&quot; &quot;donation, gift, present&quot; (&lt; &quot;da + m&quot;) is and &quot;tegm&quot; &quot;cover, lid&quot; (&lt; &quot;teg + m&quot;) is 
*Other single-consonant suffixes - &quot;-b&quot; (&lt; &quot;ib&quot; &quot;possible&quot;), &quot;-g&quot; (&lt; &quot;ig&quot; &quot;general&quot;), &quot;-k&quot; (&lt; &quot;ik&quot; &quot;property, quality&quot;, &quot;-l&quot; (&lt; &quot;il&quot; &quot;particular (e)special&quot;, &quot;-p&quot; (&lt; &quot;ep&quot; &quot;location, place, position, set, put&quot;), &quot;-s&quot; (&lt; &quot;is&quot; &quot;complement&quot;) and &quot;-t&quot; (&lt; &quot;et&quot; &quot;little, small&quot;) - shorten the preceding vowel and, when they &quot;can be articulated without difficulty&quot; are pronounced as a single consonant after another consonant, otherwise they are pronounced in full as the words from they are derived after other consonants. Dutton adds that &quot;-s&quot; must always be pronounced after word ending in &quot;-k&quot; or &quot;-g&quot; &quot;to avoid confusion with the suffix &quot;-x&quot;.

In addition, three suffixes have completely different forms after consonants and vowels:
*&quot;-f&quot; after vowels and &quot;-y&quot; after consonants
*&quot;-v&quot; after vowels and &quot;-i&quot; after consonants 
*&quot;-x&quot; after vowels and &quot;-o&quot; after consonants
&quot;f&quot; ~ &quot;-y&quot; are obviously abstracted from &quot;fy&quot; &quot;cause, make, reason, render&quot;; the pairs &quot;-v&quot; ~ &quot;-i&quot; and &quot;-x&quot; ~ &quot;-o&quot; appear to be arbitrary creations.

Also in the pre-1951 version of Speedwords, Dutton gave the apostrophe as a possessive suffix pronounced , e.g. &quot;l mant&#x27;kap&quot; &quot;the boy&#x27;s head&quot;. But in the 1951 Dictionary Dutton list a new root word &quot;zy&quot; &quot;disease&quot;. It is inconceivable that Dutton would have retained the apostrophe homophonous with &quot;zy&quot; &quot;disease.&quot; The apostrophe is retained in &quot;Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords&quot; (1951, 1971) but there is no indication how this is to be pronounced.

===Irregularities to avoid homophones===
The only examples specifically given by Dutton are:
# &quot;away&quot; as an opposite of directional a &quot;to&quot; is ao [aː&#x27;joː] as *ax would be homophonous with ax &quot;ask.&quot;
# The agent suffix &quot;-r&quot; (&lt; &quot;er&quot; &quot;person&quot;) is written as the full word and pronounced with an epenthetic , when it would otherwise create a homophone with an existing word. For example, &quot;maker&quot; is &quot;maer&quot; to avoid confusion with &quot;mar&quot; &quot;marry, marriage&quot; (In &quot;Dutton Double-Speed Words Companion to Text-Book&quot;, Dutton also gives &quot;jeer&quot; &quot;judge&quot; to avoid confusion with &quot;jur&quot; &quot;law, legal&quot;; in the 1951 Dictionary, however, &quot;judge&quot; is given as &quot;just&quot; 

Following 2 above, we may reasonably assume that if adding &quot;-b, -c, -g, -k, -l, -m, -n, -p, -s&quot; or &quot;-t&quot;, then the full word from which these are derived would have been written and pronounced with an epenthetic , thus *&quot;noib&quot; &quot;noticeable&quot; to avoid confusion with &quot;nob&quot; &quot;celebrated, honour, note, repute&quot; .

Following 1 above, we may reasonably assume that this would always be the case if by adding &quot;-x&quot; a homophone would have been created. We may also assume that the same would apply to the &quot;-v&quot; ~ &quot;-i&quot; pair, i.e. if by adding &quot;-v&quot; we had a homophone, we must add &quot;-i&quot; instead; the same well have applied to the &quot;-f&quot; ~ &quot;y&quot; pair, i.e. if by adding &quot;-f&quot; we had a homophone, we must add &quot;-y&quot; instead; but as these suffixes derive from the word &quot;fy&quot;, it may be that Dutton, following 1 above, would have added &quot;-fy&quot;.

===Compound words===
When two roots form a compound, the unwritten affix is placed after the first root. When three roots form a compound, the unwritten affix is placed after the first root. Either affix takes an epenthetic after a consonant. Examples:

:&quot;albe&quot; &quot;already&quot; (&lt; &quot;al + be&quot;) is 
:&quot;diel&quot; &quot;telephone&quot; (&lt; &quot;di + el&quot;) is 
:&quot;rysan&quot; &quot;hospital&quot; (&lt; &quot;ry + san&quot;) is 
:&quot;opmekav&quot; &quot;anti-aircraft&quot; (&lt; &quot;op + mek + av&quot;) is &#x27;OPP-ish-mek-avv&#x27;
:&quot;ryefki&quot; &quot;gymnasium&quot; (&lt; &quot;ry + ef + ki&quot;) is 

==Morphology and syntax==
Root words may function as adjectives, nouns, verb or adverbs. In &quot;Dutton Speedwords Dictionary&quot; (1951, London, Dutton Publications) we read:
&quot;The English language, like most other natural languages, is inconsistent in having separate words for the adjective &#x27;hot&#x27; and the noun &#x27;heat&#x27; whereas the same word &#x27;cold&#x27; can function as either a noun or an adjective according to its context. What applies to &#x27;cold&#x27; can logically apply also to &#x27;hot&#x27;; consequently the Speedword &quot;he&quot; denotes either &#x27;heat&#x27; or &#x27;hot&#x27;, according to circumstance. ...

&quot;Just as there is no distinction in English between the noun &#x27;cold&#x27; and the adjective &#x27;cold&#x27;, so there is none between the adjective &#x27;fast&#x27; and the adverb &#x27;fast&#x27; (there being no English word &#x27;fastly&#x27; corresponding to &#x27;slowly&#x27;). What applies to the adjective &#x27;fast&#x27; can logically apply also to other qualifiers, and consequently, there is no necessity to differentiate between, say, &#x27;beautiful&#x27; and &#x27;beautifully&#x27;. This means that, in international correspondence, the Speedword &quot;bel&quot; can convey not only &#x27;beauty&#x27; and &#x27;beautiful&#x27; ... but &#x27;beautifully&#x27; as well ...

&quot;Verbs and nouns are similarly interchangeable, for in the same way that each of the English words &#x27;work&#x27;, &#x27;answer&#x27; and &#x27;praise&#x27; can function either as a verb or noun according to its environment, so can any other word have a dual role. In English the noun form of the verb &#x27;fail&#x27; is &#x27;failure&#x27;, and of &#x27;pay&#x27; &#x27;payment&#x27;; but in everyday expressions such as &#x27;without fail&#x27; and &#x27;in his pay&#x27; the unnecessary distinction has been eliminated ... the Speedword [&quot;sic?&quot; or speeedwords] policy is to cut the Gordian knot and make &quot;pa&quot; mean either &#x27;pay&#x27; or &#x27;payment&#x27;, &quot;pre&quot; either &#x27;prepare&#x27; or &#x27;preparation&#x27;, &quot;kok&quot; &#x27;cook&#x27; or &#x27;cookery&#x27;, &quot;men&quot; &#x27;remember&#x27; to &#x27;memory&#x27;, and so on throughout.&quot;

There are, however, grammatical affixes pertinent to particular parts of speech.

===Verb affixes===
The present tense is unmarked, e.g. &quot;j spe&quot; &quot;I speak&quot;.
The past is marked by the unstressed prefix &quot;y-&quot; , e.g. &quot;j yspe&quot; &quot;I spoke&quot;.

Two verbs are irregular:
*to be: &quot;e&quot; &quot;be, am. is, are&quot;; &quot;y&quot; &quot;was, were&quot;.
*to have (perfect auxiliary): &quot;h&quot; (post-1951 pronunciation unknown) &quot;has, have&quot;; &quot;hy&quot; &quot;had&quot;.

The unmarked form also serves as the infinitive, e.g.&quot;sh am spe&quot; &quot;she loves to speak&quot;

There are two participles:
: Present participle has prefix &quot;u-&quot; , e.g. &quot;uspe&quot; &quot;speaking&quot;
: Perfect participle has suffix &quot;-d&quot; , e.g. &quot;sped&quot; &quot;spoken&quot;

Only one irregular verb: the present participle of the auxiliary &quot;h&quot; is &quot;hu&quot; 

Note: Dutton is quite clear that the prefix &quot;u&quot; forms a participle, i.e. a verbal adjective, e.g. &quot;u uspe tem&quot; &#x27;a speaking clock&#x27;, &quot;l ura on&quot; &quot;the working man.&quot; Indeed, he devotes five paragraphs to hammer this point home.

Dutton devotes six paragraphs to hammer home the difference between the English gerund (verbal noun) and the present participle. He is adamant that forms prefixed with &quot;u-&quot; may be used &quot;only&quot; as a present participle. In Speedwords the &quot;gerund must be expressed by the same form as the infinitive&quot;, i.e. the unmarked verb, e.g. &quot;g amt spe&quot; &quot;they like speaking&quot;, &quot;gi ko &amp; go&quot; &quot;their coming and going&quot;

Furthermore
:the continuous tenses are formed with &quot;to be&quot; and the unmarked verb, e.g. &quot;s e ri&quot; &quot;he is writing&quot;; &quot;w y ri&quot; &quot;we were writing&quot;.
:the perfect tenses are formed with the auxiliary &quot;h&quot; and the unmarked verb, e.g. &quot;s h ri&quot; &quot;he has written&quot;; &quot;g hy spe&quot; &quot;they had spoken&quot;.

===Noun affixes===
The plural, &quot;where necessary&quot;, is shown by the suffix &quot;-z&quot;, e.g. &quot;femz&quot; &quot;women&quot;. Dutton is emphatic that if it is clear from context that the noun must be plural, the ending &quot;-z&quot; is not used, e.g. &quot;ud fem&quot; &quot;many women&quot;; &quot;cz on&quot; 

In the pre-1951 version of Speedwords, the possessive of nouns is , and written with an apostrophe, e.g. &quot;l fem&#x27; ryg&quot; &quot;the woman&#x27;s house&quot;; but in 1951, Dutton introduced a new root word &quot;zy&quot; meaning &quot;disease&quot;. It is very unlikely that Dutton would have retained the apostrophe with the same sound. But we do not know what he subsequently did.

===Adjective/ Adverb affixes===
:&quot;me-&quot; comparative, more, -er (&lt; &quot;me&quot; greater, increase, more), e.g. &quot;mebel&quot; &quot;more beautiful(ly)&quot;
:&quot;my-&quot; superlative, most, -est (&lt; &quot;my&quot; most), e.g. &quot;mybel&quot; &quot;most beautiful(ly)&quot;

===Word Formative Suffixes===
:&quot;-a&quot; unfavourable
:&quot;-b&quot; possibility, -ible, -able (&lt; &quot;ib&quot; possible)
:&quot;-c&quot; collection (&lt; &quot;co&quot; collect, collection)
:&quot;-e&quot; augmentative
:&quot;-f&quot; causative (after a vowel) (&lt; &quot;fy&quot; cause, make, reason, render)
:&quot;-g&quot; (an idea having a general relationship to the root) (&lt; &quot;ig&quot; general)
:&quot;-i&quot; association (after a consonant), possessive on pronouns
:&quot;-k&quot; quality, -ic (&lt; &quot;ik&quot; property, quality)
:&quot;-l&quot; (an idea having a special relationship to the root) (&lt; &quot;il&quot; particular, special, especial)
:&quot;-m&quot; thing (&lt; &quot;om&quot; article, object, thing)
:&quot;-n&quot; negative, -less, in-, un- (&lt; &quot;un&quot; negative)
:&quot;-o&quot; contrary, opposite (after a consonant)
:&quot;-p&quot; place (&lt; &quot;ep&quot; location, place, position, put, set)
:&quot;-r&quot; person, agent, -er (&lt; &quot;er&quot; person)
:&quot;-s&quot; (an idea having a complementary relationship to the root) (&lt; &quot;is&quot; complement)
:&quot;-t&quot; diminutive, -ette (&lt; &quot;et&quot; little, small)
:&quot;-u&quot; favorable
:&quot;-v&quot; association (after a vowel)
:&quot;-x&quot; contrary, opposite (after a vowel)
:&quot;-y&quot; causative (after a consonant) (&lt; &quot;fy&quot; cause, make, reason, render)
:&quot;-z&quot; plural, -s
:&quot;-st&quot; professional, -ist (&lt; &quot;ist&quot; professional)

In &quot;Dutton World Speedwords&quot; we are given on page 64, §328, the &#x27;indefinite preposition&#x27; &quot;iv&quot;. But it is clear from Dutton&#x27;s entry that the affixes &quot;-i&quot; and &quot;-v&quot; are not derived from this preposition but rather that the preposition is a backformation from the affixes.

Dutton says [words in italics were written as italicized speedwords in the original]: &quot;&quot;The&quot; prepositions &#x27;at&#x27;, &#x27;on&#x27;, &#x27;by&#x27;, &#x27;under&#x27;, etc. &quot;are sometimes&quot; used to convey &quot;a somewhat&quot; loose &quot;idea of&quot; association &quot;without any&quot; definite &quot;idea of position, as in&quot; &#x27;at the most&#x27;, &#x27;by the way&#x27;, &#x27;on business&#x27;, &#x27;under difficulties&#x27;, etc. &quot;When, therefore, any&quot; preposition &quot;is not&quot; literally applicable, &quot;the&quot; Speedword &quot; &#x27;iv&#x27; is&quot; used. &quot;This&quot; Speedword consists &quot;of the two&quot; association suffixes &quot; &#x27;i-&#x27; and &#x27;-v&#x27; and hence&quot; appropriately conveys &quot;the idea of&quot; association &quot;without&quot; definite &quot;sense of place.&quot;&quot;

===Interfixes (not written)===
:&quot;-&quot; two-root compound 
:&quot;-&quot; three-root compound
For examples see Compound words in the &#x27;Phonology and orthography&#x27; section above.

==Potential improvements to Speedwords==
There are three potential improvements to Speedwords which would overcoming ambiguities, remove omissions or deficiencies, and overcome confusion. These were discussed.

A major ambiguity is terminological. Dutton uses three terms interchangeably in TYDS. They are &#x27;parent word&#x27; (page 9, 88), &#x27;radical&#x27; (page 88) &#x27;word-root&#x27; (page 51, 52), and &#x27;word family&#x27; (page 89). He sometimes uses them identically, to mean the stem, that is an indivisible element TYS page 88). At other times he means the indivisible element plus prefix or suffix or the compounds of indivisible elements (TYDS, page 158). By doing so he lacks the ability to distinguish between them. It would be much simpler to reserve the three terms for the indivisible element and then use the term &quot;extension&quot; for the addition of prefix or suffix. &quot;Compound&quot; would retain its existing usage. Even more confusingly he adds another term &#x27;word familities&#x27; (TYDS, page 89). It is not clear whether this refers to the indivisible element plus all its prefixes and suffixes. Dutton also refers to &quot;keywords&quot; meaning the basic or essential stem words to which prefixes and suffixes are added. So, this means there is ambiguity for the learner on what is the basic vocabulary of Speedwords. Some further research is underway to see if this can be clarified.

There is an obvious omission and deficiency. These could have easily been rectified by Dutton using his personal knowledge and included in an expanded TYDS edition.

The major omission is a description of his rationale behind formulating the Speedwords he has chosen. In his opening chapter of all editions of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords titled &quot;Dutton Speedwords Analysed&quot; (TYDS, pages 7–9) he describes some of the principles he used. For example, using Horn&#x27;s analysis of frequently used words to determine how much to abbreviate or truncate his Speedword vocabulary, and, drawing on words common to several European languages. But this does not equate to a systematic account of how new technical words and expressions could be added to the Speedword vocabulary. Nor does it show that the existing Speedwords were wisely chosen.

The major deficiencies arise from overcoming confusion caused by apparent inconsistencies in understanding what is meant by particular Speedwords given the variety of Speedword formation methods available. There are four possible areas of confusion. First, deciphering the meaning of a Speedword can produce several possible candidate meanings. There are 20 suffixes (TYDS, page 90). The practice of incorporating a Speedword suffix into the Speedword meakes it difficult to decide whether a Speedword is either a Speedword stem (that is, an indivisible element) or a Speedword and a suffix. For example, the Speedword &#x27;de&#x27; is day, &#x27;deb&#x27; is debt but &#x27;debe&#x27; is yesterday. The suffix &#x27;e&#x27; is an augmentive (TYDS, page 37) signalling a comparative increase. So, an untutored interpretation would suggest that &#x27;debe&#x27; is a large debt. Dutton&#x27;s answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. Second, contractions of frequently used Speedwords actually multiply the vocabulary by creating new Speedwords. For example, &#x27;debe&#x27; yesterday is shortened to &#x27;db&#x27;, and &#x27;jecen&#x27; percent is shortened to &#x27;jc&#x27;. Again, Dutton&#x27;s answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. Third, there are some puzzling inconsistencies. For example, &#x27;La&#x27; is great, &#x27;Mla&#x27; is greater. &#x27;M&#x27; is also used as an abbreviation for &#x27;Mr&#x27;. It is unclear whether this is a misprint with the L in lower case and what the &#x27;m&#x27; signifies. Finally, Dutton encourages joining Speedwords together as compounds except where they are equivalent to an existing Speedword. This creates new Speedwords which become unrecognisable because they are not in the dictionary, Again, Dutton&#x27;s answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. The disadvantage is it increases the vocabulary reducing the benefit from keeping the vocabulary small.

In summary, these shortcomings are resolvable. Ambiguity could be resolved by obtaining a copy of the Speedwords publication which lists the 493 elementary Speedwords but this is unobtainable. It may also contain the rationale for formulating Speedwords. The deficiencies should be addressed differently. Instead of immediately changing some Speedwords, the system of affixes (prefix, suffix) need to be re-examined. The number of prefixes should be reduced. Some overlap (e.g., augmentation, and favourable, TYDS, pages 37–38, 34 respectively). The complement suffix denote an incorrect pair or is out of sequence TYDS, pages 50–51) for example, &#x27;ze&#x27; means send but &#x27;zes&#x27; is bring. The diminutive suffix does not convey magnitude (TYDS, page 51), for example, &#x27;do&#x27; for live, while &#x27;dot&#x27; is visit). The use of a prefix conceals the Speedword because the first letter cannot be immediately recognised. These proposals would make Speedwords more easily recognisable because the elementary stem would be reliably recognisable. Apparently in the 1980s and 1990s some attempts were made to amend Speedword shortcomings but they are no longer available for inspection and evaluation. Improvements depend upon reading Dutton publications from 1933 and 1951 which may disclose method and rationale.

<doc id="335439" wikidata="Q4387765" url="?curid=335439" title="Jesus Jones">
<text>Jesus Jones are a British alternative rock band from Bradford-on-Avon in Wiltshire, formed in late 1988, who continue to record and perform, as of 2025. Their track &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; was an international hit, and was subsequently globally licensed for promotional and advertising campaigns. The single was also nominated for a Grammy award at the 34th Annual Grammy Awards in 1991, as was its album, &quot;Doubt&quot;. They also achieved chart success with the songs &quot;Real Real Real&quot;, &quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot; and &quot;Info Freako&quot;.

==Career==

===Formation and &quot;Liquidizer&quot; (1986–1989)===
Incorporating elements of electronic music styles such as house and techno to an indie rock format, along with fellow British groups such as The Shamen, Pop Will Eat Itself and EMF, Jesus Jones were one of the leading purveyors of the early 1990s alternative dance scene. In late 1988, while on holiday in Spain, Mike Edwards, Gen, and Al Doughty decided to leave the band they were in at the time, and form their own band. The name of the band came about when they realised that they were three &quot;Joneses&quot; sitting on a beach in Spain surrounded by people called Jesus.
Back in London they advertised in the music press for a guitarist, and Jerry De Borg joined the band. Edwards had recently met Iain Baker in a pub in North London, they had got talking as they recognised each other as skateboarders, due to their footwear. Edwards asked Baker to join as the keyboardist and the line-up was complete.

They achieved initial critical acclaim with their 1989 album &quot;Liquidizer&quot;, and in particular, the single &quot;Info Freako&quot;, which featured buzzing rock guitars with samples and a hip-hop sensibility, relatively new at the time. The track was particularly championed by Bruno Brookes on his BBC Radio 1 programme.

At the end of 1989 they covered the Crazyhead song, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want that Kind of Love&quot; for the 12&quot; Food Xmas EP release, with Diesel Park West covering &quot;Info Freako&quot;.

===&quot;Doubt&quot; and &quot;Perverse&quot; (1990–1995)===
In the spring of 1990, Jesus Jones recorded their second album, &quot;Doubt&quot;, but their record label was forced to delay its release until the beginning of 1991. The album sold well, due to the success of &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;. The song is about the swift end of the Cold War, and reached No. 2 in the US and No. 31 in the UK. In June 1990, Jesus Jones appeared at the Glastonbury Festival.

Other singles from &quot;Doubt&quot; included &quot;Real, Real, Real&quot; and &quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot;, which became two of their biggest hit singles in the UK, reaching No. 19 and No. 7 respectively in the UK Singles Chart. In 1991, Jesus Jones were the only UK winners when they won the Best New Artist award at the MTV Awards. In April 1991, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that their US tour had sold out before Jesus Jones arrived in the country.

The follow-up to &quot;Doubt&quot; was &quot;Perverse&quot; (1993), a darker and more industrial based album, which, though a big seller, did not reach the worldwide hit status of &quot;Doubt&quot;. &quot;Perverse&quot; was one of the first rock albums recorded entirely digitally.

===&quot;Already&quot; and &quot;London&quot; (1996–2003)===
After the release of the &quot;Perverse&quot; album, Jesus Jones took an extended hiatus and did not return to the recording studio until December 1996. After the recording of their fourth album, drummer Gen left the band before the album was released. They released their fourth album, titled &quot;Already&quot;, in 1997 after which Jesus Jones and their record label EMI parted company. The final months of the band are chronicled in the PDF book written by Mike Edwards &quot;Death Threats From An 8 Year Old In The Seychelles&quot;, which was available for a time from the band&#x27;s website, and was published as a book to buy from the usual outlets. The band remained in contact and came back with a new drummer Tony Arthy with the low-selling &quot;London&quot; in 2001 on the indie record label Mi5 Recordings. EMI issued &quot;Never Enough: the Best of Jesus Jones&quot;, a greatest hits compilation album whilst the band moved from the North American-only Mi5 to the newly established Mi5 Recordings UK.

===Later activities (2004–2015)===
With the exception of the release of the &quot;Culture Vulture&quot; EP in 2004, no new material from the band had been released between 2001 and 2018. However, in 2010, a series of download albums were released to Amazon.co.uk. The release consisted of six different albums containing &quot;in concert&quot; performances at the BBC, such as London T+C 1991 and London Astoria 1993.

In 2005, the Live at the Marquee DVD was released on Secret Recordings of a filmed gig from 2002.

The single &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; was resurrected in 2006 as an advertising jingle for the American retailer Kmart, in an image campaign for CBS News, and in promotional advertisements for the now-defunct television channel TechTV. In 2007 Hillary Clinton used the track for her electoral campaign. Ford Motor Company used &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; in their 2010 televisual advertising campaign. A cover of the song was also recorded by New Zealand band The Feelers to use in advertising for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. 
In 2011 the band released &quot;The Collection &amp; Other Rarities&quot;, which included many of their B-side tracks as well as demos and rarities.

In November 2014, EMI reissued all four of the band&#x27;s albums in a special CD+DVD bundle. In addition to the original album&#x27;s tracks the reissues feature radio sessions, long-deleted b-sides, rare remixes and alternate versions. The DVDs include rare live concert footage and other extras.

In a 2015 interview for the online periodical &quot;Soot Magazine&quot; band leader Mike Edwards acknowledged that, besides re-recording some older tracks with new arrangements, he was in the process of writing material for a new album: &quot;I am writing new stuff – I was actually writing some new material yesterday and I have loads of little bits and pieces ticking over.&quot;

Since the mid-2000s, Jesus Jones have continued performing live. In August 2011, the band went on a short tour (dubbed on one poster &quot;The World&#x27;s Smallest World Tour&quot;), playing three shows in Australia before closing with a show in Japan. In November 2011, the band were due to perform in the UK in Birmingham and London, but the dates were postponed due to bass player Al Doughty being ill. They took place in January 2012. The band also toured the UK in December 2013 as part of The Wonder Stuff&#x27;s Sleigh The UK tour. In March 2015, the band again returned to Australia and New Zealand for a five city tour.

On 24 December 2013, the band announced the resignation of drummer Tony Arthy. Having been with the band for 13 years, Arthy had replaced original drummer Simon &quot;Gen&quot; Matthews who had left after the rocky completion of &quot;Already&quot;. On 1 January 2014, the band announced that Matthews would be rejoining the band.

2013 also saw the release of the Liquidizer Live DVD self published.

=== &quot;Passages&quot; and &quot;Voyages&quot; (2016-2018) ===
In 2016, the first song taken from what would become the Passages album, &quot;How is this Even Going Down?&quot; was released with extra tracks &quot;Fall&quot; and &quot;Stripped 2016&quot;.

This was followed in 2016 with the Cdr single &quot;Suck it up&quot; with the extra tracks &quot;So Welcome&quot; and &quot;Grateful&quot;.

All these tracks would later appear on the album Passages, which was released in April 2018 through a pledge music release and cd, with the companion demos album &quot;Voyages&quot; released in November 2018.

=== &quot;Liquidizer&quot; EP 2019 ===
The band released reworkings of Liquidizer album tracks in November 2019 on CD to celebrate its 30th Anniversary. The reworked tracks were - &quot;Move Mountains&quot;, &quot;All the Answers&quot;, &quot;Bring it on Down&quot; and &quot;Someone to Blame&quot;.

=== &quot;Some of the Answers&quot; 2022 ===
The 15 CD Some of the Answers boxset was released in 2022 on Demon Records to cover all song, alternative releases and demos for the band - 6 albums, 131 bonus tracks and a 12x12 booklet of song annotations by the keyboard player Iain Baker.

=== Record Store Day Releases (2018-2023) ===
Over the years, Jesus Jones have participated four times in record store day releases. 

&quot;Zeroes and Ones&quot; was released as a clear limited to 1000, 12&quot; vinyl with remixes by The Prodigy and Aphex Twin on 21st April 2018 on Razor and Tie Industries.

&quot;Right Here Right Now&quot; and remixes followed on clear 12&quot; vinyl limited to 500 on RT industries.

Scratched was released as a 2 LP coloured vinyl on 23rd April 2022 on Demon Records limited to 2000. It had previously been a Japan only CD release.

In 2023, Live in Chicago was released as a 1200 edition, 2 white vinyl set with extra bonus tracks from Amsterdam. This was released on 22nd April.

All information can be found on the Record Store Day official pages.

=== Coloured Vinyl on Demon Records (2022) ===
The older albums were all released onto various coloured vinyl in October 2022 on the Demon Records label.

Liquidizer on green, Doubt on orange, Perverse on blue, Already on clear, London on white, Passages on Yellow.

The compilation 2 LP gold vinyl set &quot;Zeroes and Ones the Best of Jesus Jones&quot; was also released on 28th October 2022.

=== Touring (2019-2023) ===
Apart from during the pandemic years, Jesus Jones continued touring extensively for this time. As well as the UK gigs, they also played in Brazil, USA, Canada and Japan.

=== &quot;Still Smiling&quot; release (2023) ===
A new single &quot;Still Smiling&quot; with an extra track &quot;Blue Skies&quot; was released on customised USB key with extras. This was for a planned Canada/USA tour, but issues with visas meant it was cancelled.

=== More touring (2024) ===
2024 was a busy year for touring, billed as a &quot;35th Anniversary tour&quot; the band played the UK, USA and Australia. They did their first co-headline tour with fellow band from the 90s of a similar ilk, EMF.

=== &quot;Animal Instinct&quot; release (2024) ===
The track &quot;Animal Instinct&quot; was released with a video on youtube.com in 2024. Its the precursor to more new tracks and an album release in 2025.

=== 2025 Plans ===
So far the band have been on the &quot;90s Cruise&quot; with other bands to celebrate the 90s, which was a cruise of Tampa and Mexico, and have gigs planned for the end of March, and with EMF again in October. New song writing continues...

<doc id="335440" wikidata="Q3470504" url="?curid=335440" title="Harriett, Texas">
<text>Harriett, is an unincorporated community in northeastern Tom Green County in the U.S. state of Texas. It is part of the San Angelo, Texas Metropolitan Statistical Area and is situated next to U.S. Highway 67.

A post office was established in 1909 in what would later be Harriett, with Charles P. Lovelace as postmaster. A month later, the post office changed its name from Harriet to Harriett and continued to serve the area until it was moved to San Angelo in 1927. The community reported a population of 12 and two businesses in 1936, and county maps of the 1950s showed a church and several buildings there. Harriett was shown on the 1984 county highway map with a railroad station and, two miles to the northeast, a cemetery.

<text>Stefano Garzelli (born 16 July 1973) is an Italian former professional road racing cyclist, who competed as a professional between 1997 and 2013. The high point of his career was his overall win in the 2000 Giro d&#x27;Italia, after a close three-way competition with Gilberto Simoni and Francesco Casagrande.

==Career==
Born in Varese, Garzelli started out as being a domestique for Marco Pantani but proved in 2000 that he deserved much more. When &quot;The Pirate&quot; lacked form in the beginning of the 2000 Giro, Garzelli was left free of all team duties for , and was able to fight and win his own battle in the Giro. In the final time-trial stage Garzelli took the race leadership away from Casagrande, who was suffering an inflamed sciatic nerve. Casagrande was devastated, and Garzelli dedicated his win to Pantani.

He was a versatile rider with qualities that included decent sprinting, decent time trials and some good skills in the mountains. Without being a great attacker, Garzelli was very constant and, on a good day, he could go with the best climbers.

After his win of the 2000 Giro d&#x27;Italia he was recruited by the Italian super-team in 2001, aiming to repeat his 2000 Giro success. The start of the season showed promise, with Garzelli being a key player in teammate Paolo Bettini&#x27;s win in Liège–Bastogne–Liège, with Garzelli himself finishing second. The finale of the race saw Bettini and Garzelli make tactical moves to benefit from each other&#x27;s attacks and saw them finish the race with a comfortable margin to decide the win amongst themselves.

However, after already winning two stages at the event, Garzelli was caught in the 2002 doping scandal in the Giro d&#x27;Italia, and was forced out of the race. Many believe that the circumstances of his suspension prompted the Mapei boss Giorgio Squinzi to terminate his sponsorship of the team at the end of the year. &quot;The exclusion of Garzelli, who tested positive for a masking agent, wasn&#x27;t a normal thing. At the start nothing was found. Later, as soon as he won a stage, a forbidden substance came out all of a sudden. That&#x27;s bizarre,&quot; said Squinzi in an interview. In a 2011 interview the Belgian double world champion Freddy Maertens cast doubt on whether Garzelli had deliberately used the steroid masking agent concerned, the diuretic Probenecid, likening it to an incident to the 1974 world championships in which he claimed that his water bottle had been deliberately sabotaged by the soigneur of his rival Eddy Merckx.

Garzelli was able to mount a comeback for the 2003 Giro d&#x27;Italia and was able to challenge eventual winner Gilberto Simoni in the race.

In 2006, for the first time since he was a professional, he decided not to race the Giro d&#x27;Italia, but instead to prepare for the Classics, training with some of his Liquigas-Bianchi teammates (including Danilo Di Luca, Patrick Calcagni and Stefano Zanini) at high altitude in the region around Toluca, Mexico. He finished sixth in both in his first race of the season, Milan-Torino, and at Milan-San Remo, after an unsuccessful attack on the Cipressa hill. He accumulated placings during the first part of the season, without ever being able to win a race, until Rund um den Henninger-Turm where he bested German sprint specialists Gerald Ciolek, Danilo Hondo and Erik Zabel in a sprint finish.

In December 2012, Garzelli signed a one-year contract with the team for the 2013 season, and retired thereafter.

He now works for RAI the Italian national broadcaster as a summariser on the Cycling programmes covered by RAIsport such as the Giro d&#x27;Italia and Tour de France.

<doc id="335446" wikidata="Q3110820" url="?curid=335446" title="Education in England">
<text>Education in England is overseen by the Department for Education. Local government authorities are responsible for implementing policy for public education and state-funded schools at a local level. State-funded schools may be selective &quot;grammar schools&quot; or non-selective &quot;comprehensive schools&quot;. All state schools are subject to assessment and inspection by the government department Ofsted (the Office for Standards in Education, Children&#x27;s Services and Skills). England also has private schools (some of which are known as &quot;public schools&quot;) and home education; legally, parents may choose to educate their children by any suitable means. 

The state-funded compulsory school system is divided into &quot;Key Stages&quot;, based upon the student&#x27;s age by August 31. The Early Years Foundation Stage is for ages 3–4. Primary education is divided into Key Stage 1 for ages 5–7 and Key Stage 2 for ages 7–11. Secondary education is divided into Key Stage 3 for ages 11–14 and Key Stage 4 for ages 14–16. At the end of Year 11 (at age 15-16) students typically take General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exams or other Level 1 or Level 2 qualifications. 

&quot;Education&quot; is compulsory until 18, thus post-16 education can take a number of forms, and may be academic or vocational. This can involve continued schooling, known as sixth form, leading to A-levels or alternative Level 3 qualifications. It can also include work-based apprenticeships, traineeships and volunteering. The Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) covers national school examinations and vocational education qualifications.

Higher education often begins with a three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree. Postgraduate degrees include master&#x27;s degrees, either taught or by research, and doctoral level research degrees that usually take at least three years. The Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ), which is tied to the RQF, covers degrees and other qualifications from degree-awarding bodies.

==History of English education==

During the Middle Ages, schools were established to teach Latin to the sons of the aristocracy destined for priesthood or monastic work with the ministry of government or the law. Two universities were established in affiliation with the church: the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, to assist in the further training of the Catholic Christian clergy.

Education in England remained closely linked to religious institutions until the nineteenth century, although charity schools and &quot;free grammar schools&quot;, which were open to children of any religious beliefs, became more common in the early modern period. 

Nineteenth century reforms expanded education provision and introduced widespread state-funded schools. Until 1870 all schools were charitable or private institutions, but in that year the Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 75) permitted local governments to complement the existing elementary schools in order to fill any gaps. The Education Act 1902 allowed local authorities to create secondary schools. The Education Act 1918 abolished fees for elementary schools.

Women&#x27;s colleges were established in the 19th century to give women access to university education, the first being Bedford College, London (1849), Girton College, Cambridge (1869) and Newnham College, Cambridge (1871). The University of London established special examinations for women in 1868 and opened its degrees to women in 1878. University College Bristol (now the University of Bristol) became the first mixed higher education institution upon its foundation in 1876, followed in 1878 by University College London (which had held some mixed classes starting in 1871).

==Legally compulsory education==
Full-time education is compulsory for all children aged 5 to 18, students must stay in a traditional school setting until the age of 16. After this age they are still legally required to receive further education (which may be academic or technical) until the age of 18, but this does not have to be in a traditional school environment and numerous vocational options are legally acceptable and available.

The age at which a pupil may choose to stop education is commonly known as the &quot;leaving age&quot; for compulsory education. This age was raised to 18 by the Education and Skills Act 2008; the change took effect in 2013 for 16-year-olds and 2015 for 17-year-olds. From this time, the formal school leaving age (which remains 16) and the education leaving age (now 18) have been separated. State-provided schooling and sixth-form education are paid for by taxes.

A child begins primary education during the school year they turn 5. Children between the ages of 3 and 5 are entitled to 600 hours per year of optional, state-funded, pre-school education. This can be provided in &quot;playgroups&quot;, nurseries, community childcare centres or nursery classes in schools.

All children in England must currently therefore receive an effective education (at school or otherwise) from the first &quot;prescribed day&quot;, which falls on or after their fifth birthday until their 18th birthday, and must remain in school until the last Friday in June of the school year in which they turn 16. The education leaving age was raised in 2013 to the year in which they turn 17 and in 2015 to their 18th birthday for those born on, or after, 1 September 1997. The prescribed days are 31 August, 31 December and 31 March. The school year begins on 1 September (or 1 August if a term starts in August).

The compulsory stages of education are broken into a Foundation Stage (covering the last part of optional and first part of compulsory education), 4 Key Stages, and post-16 education, sometimes unofficially termed Key Stage Five, which takes a variety of forms, including 6th Form, which covers the last 2 years of secondary education in schools.

==Types of school==
A number of different terms and names exist for the various schools and stages a pupil may go through during the compulsory part of their education. Grammar schools are selective schools, admitting children from 11 years old onward; they are normally state-funded, though fee paying independent grammars do exist. Schools offering nursery (pre-school) education commonly accept pupils from age 3; however, some schools do accept pupils younger than this.

===State-funded schools===
Some 93% of children between the ages of 3 and 18 are in education in state-funded schools without charge (other than for activities such as swimming, cultural visits, theatre visits and field trips for which a voluntary payment can be requested, and limited charges at state-funded boarding schools). 

All schools are legally required to have a website where they must publish details of their governance, finance, curriculum intent and staff and pupil protection policies.

Types of schools in England include:

* Academy schools, established by the 1997-2010 Labour Government to replace poorly-performing community schools in areas of high social and economic deprivation. Their start-up costs are typically funded by private means, such as entrepreneurs or NGOs, with running costs met by central government and, like Foundation schools, are administratively free from direct local authority control. The 2010 Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government expanded the role of Academies in the &quot;Academy Programme.&quot; Some such schools operate selective entrance requirements for some of their entry, similar to grammar schools.
* Community schools, in which the local authority employs the schools&#x27; staff, owns the schools&#x27; lands and buildings, and has primary responsibility for admissions.
* Free schools, introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, are newly established schools in England set up by parents, teachers, charities or businesses, where there is a perceived local need for more schools. They are funded by taxpayers, are academically non-selective and free to attend, and like Foundation schools and Academies, are not controlled by a local authority. They are ultimately accountable to the Secretary of State for Education. Free schools are an extension of the existing Academy Programme. The first 24 free schools opened in Autumn 2011.

*Foundation schools, in which the governing body employs the staff and has primary responsibility for admissions. School land and buildings are owned by the governing body or by a charitable foundation. The foundation appoints a minority of governors. Many of these schools were formerly grant maintained schools. In 2005 the Labour government proposed allowing all schools to become Foundation schools if they wished.
* Voluntary Aided schools, linked to a variety of organisations. They can be faith schools (about two thirds Church of England-affiliated; just under one third Roman Catholic Church, and a few another faith), or non-denominational schools, such as those linked to London Livery Companies. The charitable foundation contributes towards the capital costs of the school (typically 10%), and appoints a majority of the school governors. The governing body employs the staff and has primary responsibility for admissions.
* Voluntary Controlled schools, which are almost always faith schools, with the lands and buildings often owned by a charitable foundation. However, the local authority employs the schools&#x27; staff and has primary responsibility for admissions.
* University technical colleges (UTCs), introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010. These are sponsored by a university and have close ties to local business and industry. They are funded by the taxpayer, and are non-selective, free to attend and not controlled by a local authority. The university and industry partners support the curriculum development of the UTC, provide professional development opportunities for teachers, and guide suitably qualified students to industrial apprenticeships, foundation degrees or full degrees. The sponsor university appoints the majority of the UTC&#x27;s governors and key members of staff. Pupils transfer to a UTC at the age of 14, part-way through their secondary education. The distinctive element of UTCs is that they offer technically oriented courses of study, combining National Curriculum requirements with technical and vocational elements. UTCs must specialise in subjects that require technical and modern equipment, but they also all teach business skills and the use of information and communications technology. UTCs are also supposed to offer clear routes into higher education or further learning in work.
* Maths schools were launched as selective specialist 16–19 schools in 2018, again sponsored by a university, following pilots with King&#x27;s College London Mathematics School and Exeter Mathematics School.

In addition, three of the fifteen City Technology Colleges established in the 1980s still remain; the rest having converted to academies. These are state-funded all-ability secondary schools which charge no fees but which are independent of local authority control. There are also a small number of state-funded boarding schools.

English state-funded primary schools are almost all local schools with a small catchment area. More than half are owned by the Local Authority, though many are (nominally) voluntary controlled and some are voluntary aided. Some schools just include infants (aged 4 to 7) and some just juniors (aged 7 to 11). Some are linked, with automatic progression from the infant school to the junior school, and some are not. A few areas still have first schools for ages around 4 to 8 and middle schools for ages 8 or 9 to 12 or 13.

English secondary schools are mostly comprehensive (i.e. no entry exam), although the intake of comprehensive schools can vary widely, especially in urban areas with several local schools. Nearly 90% of state-funded secondary schools are specialist schools, receiving extra funding to develop one or more subjects (performing arts, arts, business, humanities, languages, science, mathematics, technology, engineering, etc) in which the school specialises, which can select up to 10% of their intake for aptitude in the specialism. In areas children can enter a prestigious grammar school if they pass the eleven plus exam; there are also a number of isolated fully selective grammar schools and a few dozen partially selective schools. A significant minority of state-funded schools are faith schools, which are attached to religious groups, most often the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church.

All state-funded schools are regularly inspected by the Office for Standards in Education, often known simply as Ofsted. Ofsted publishes reports on the quality of education, learning outcomes, management, and safety and behaviour of young people at a particular school on a regular basis. Schools judged by Ofsted to be providing an inadequate standard of education may be subject to special measures, which could include replacing the governing body and senior staff. School inspection reports are published online and directly sent to parents and guardians.

School uniforms are defined by individual schools, within the constraint that uniform regulations must not discriminate on the grounds of sex, race, disability, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, religion or belief. Schools may choose to permit trousers for girls or religious dress. Pupils aged five to seven in state-funded schools (including those in reception class) are entitled to free school meals and fruit. Pupils aged seven to 16 from low income families are eligible for free school meals. All school meals must follow the government&#x27;s healthy eating standards and promote a healthy diet.

State-funded schools are encouraged to provide childcare outside of school hours, including breakfast clubs and after school curriculum activities (drama, computing, food preparation, arts, crafts, sports, science, etc).

=== Private schools ===
Approximately 7% of school children in England attend privately run, fee-charging private schools. Some independent schools for 13–18-year-olds are known for historical reasons as &#x27;public schools&#x27; and for 8–13-year-olds as &#x27;prep schools&#x27;. Some schools offer scholarships for those with particular skills or aptitudes, or bursaries to allow students from less financially well-off families to attend. Independent schools do not have to follow the National Curriculum, and their teachers are not required or regulated by law to have official teaching qualifications. The Independent Schools Inspectorate regularly publishes reports on the quality of education in all independent schools.

=== Education by means other than schooling ===

The Education Act 1944 stated that parents are responsible for the education of their children, &quot;by regular attendance at school or otherwise&quot;, which allows children to be educated at home. Officially referred to as &quot;Elective Home Education&quot;, teaching ranges from structured homeschooling (using a school-style curriculum) to less-structured unschooling. Education Otherwise has supported parents who wished to educate their children outside school since the 1970s. The state provides no financial support to parents who choose to educate their children outside of school.

==Stages of compulsory education==

===Early years===

In the early years foundation stage, the curriculum is organised into seven areas of learning:

* Communication and language
* Physical development
* Personal, social and emotional development
* Literacy
* Mathematics
* Understanding the world
* Expressive arts and design

=== National curriculum ===
The national curriculum covers pupils in primary school (ages 5 to 11; key stages 1 and 2) and secondary school (ages 11 to 16; key stages 3 and 4). It covers what subjects are taught and the standards children should reach in each subject.

State-funded schools in England are required to offer a curriculum which is balanced and broadly based, which promotes the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society, and which prepares pupils for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life. 

State-funded schools are obliged to teach thirteen subjects, including the core English, Mathematics and Science. The structure of the National Curriculum is:

All schools are also required to teach religious education at all key stages, and secondary schools must provide sex and relationship education.

In addition to the compulsory subjects, students at Key Stage 4 have a statutory entitlement to be able to study at least one subject from the arts (comprising art and design, dance, music, photography, media studies, film studies, graphics, drama and media arts), design and technology (comprising design and technology, electronics, engineering, food preparation and nutrition), the humanities (comprising geography and history), business and enterprise (comprising business studies and economics) and a modern language.

=== Post-16 education ===
Compulsory schooling ends on the last Friday of June for pupils who will turn 16 before the start of the next school year. Most pupils at both state schools and independent schools will typically take GCSE examinations at the end of their last year of compulsory schooling. 

After this, young people are mandated to continue in education until age 18, but need not attend a school. They can pursue further education, which includes technical education, in the sixth form of a school, in a specialised sixth form or further education college. Alternatively, they can take an apprenticeship or traineeship, or can volunteer for 20 or more hours a week while undertaking part-time education or training. Types of colleges that focus on education after sixteen include:

* Further education colleges
* Sixth form colleges
* Tertiary colleges
* Art, design and performing art colleges

====Sixth form colleges / further education colleges====
Students over 16 typically study in the sixth form of a school (&quot;sixth form&quot; is a historical term for Years 12–13), in a separate sixth form college or further education college. Courses at FE colleges (referred to as &quot;further education courses&quot;) can also be studied by adults over 18. Colleges can offer a wide range of options for study, including apprenticeships and national qualifications such as:

* A-levels
* Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC)
* City and Guilds qualifications
* Cambridge International 
* Cambridge Technicals
* International Baccalaureate (IB)
* National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs)
* T Levels
* WJEC Eduqas qualifications
* Functional Skills qualifications
* Skills for Life courses

====Apprenticeships and traineeships====
The National Apprenticeship Service helps people 16 or more years of age enter apprenticeships in order to learn a skilled trade. Traineeships are also overseen by the National Apprenticeship Service, and are education and a training programmes that are combined with work experience to give trainees the skills needed to get an apprenticeship.

T Levels are technical qualifications introduced in 2020, developed in collaboration with businesses and education providers to prepare students for skilled employment, apprenticeships and higher study. Every T Level includes an industry placement with an employer focused on developing the practical and technical skills required for an occupation. 

==Higher education==


Higher education in England is provided by Higher Education (HE) colleges, university colleges, universities and private colleges. Students normally enter higher education as undergraduates from age 18 onwards, and can study for a wide variety of vocational and academic qualifications, including certificates of higher education and higher national certificates at level 4, diplomas of higher education, higher national diplomas and foundation degrees at level 5, bachelor&#x27;s degrees (normally with honours) at level 6, and integrated master&#x27;s degrees and degrees in medicine, dentistry, and veterinary science at level 7.

Historically, undergraduate education outside a small number of private colleges and universities has been largely state-financed since the 1960s, with a contribution from top-up fees introduced in October 1998, however fees of up to £9,000 per annum have been charged from October 2012. There is a perceived hierarchy among universities, with the Russell Group seen as being composed of the country&#x27;s more prestigious universities. League tables of universities are produced by private companies and generally cover the whole UK.

The state does not control university syllabuses, but it does influence admission procedures through the Office for Students (OfS), which approves and monitors access agreements to safeguard and promote fair access to higher education. The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) is an independent expert quality body, with a remit to maintain and enhance the quality of teaching and learning in tertiary education in England. Unlike most degrees, the state has control over teacher training courses, and standards are monitored by Ofsted inspectors.

The typical first degree offered at English universities is the bachelor&#x27;s degree with honours, which usually lasts for three years, although more vocational foundation degrees, typically lasting two years (or full-time equivalent) are also available in some institutions. Many institutions now offer integrated master&#x27;s degrees, particularly in STEM subjects, as first degrees; these typically lasts for four years, the first three years running parallel to the bachelor&#x27;s course in the subject. During a first degree students are known as undergraduates. The difference in fees between integrated and traditional postgraduate master&#x27;s degrees (and that fees are capped at the first degree level for the former) makes taking an integrated master&#x27;s degree as a first degree a more attractive option. Integrated master&#x27;s degrees are often the standard route to chartered status for STEM professionals in England.

The majority of international students in the United Kingdom chose a British institution because of the country&#x27;s reputation for high quality education, a far higher proportion than in Canada or Australia (just over 20 per cent) or the US (around 15 per cent). The University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge rank among the top 10 of the major global rankings. At some institutions in London such as the London School of Economics and University College London, the majority of first degree students are from outside the UK. Including postgraduates, international students are also in the majority at Imperial College London and University of the Arts London.

===Postgraduate education===
Students who have completed a first degree can apply for postgraduate and graduate courses. These include:
* Graduate certificates, graduate diplomas, professional graduate certificate in education – level 6 courses aimed at those who have already completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree, often as conversion courses.
* Postgraduate certificates, postgraduate diplomas, postgraduate certificate in education – level 7 courses shorter than a full master&#x27;s degree.
* Master&#x27;s degrees (typically taken in one year, though research-based master&#x27;s degrees may last for two) – taught or research degrees at level 7.
* Doctorates (typically taken in three years) – research degrees at level 8, the top level of the qualifications frameworks, often requiring a master&#x27;s degree for entry. These may be purely research based (PhD/DPhil) or research and practice (professional doctorates). &quot;New Route&quot; PhDs, introduced in 2001, take at least 4 years and incorporate teaching at master&#x27;s level.

===Fees===

Since October 1998, most undergraduates have paid fees repayable after graduation, contingent on attaining a certain level of income, with the state paying all fees for students from the poorest backgrounds. Only those who reach a certain salary threshold (£21,000) pay this fee through general taxation. In practice, higher education remains free at the point of entry in England for a high minority of students. English students are generally entitled to student loans for maintenance and living costs. 

Students admitted from the academic year 2024-25 have paid tuition fees set at a maximum of up to £9,535 per annum. Fees for international students vary but are generally higher. Depending on the discipline and university, Master&#x27;s degrees can cost between £10,000 and £35,000. There are numerous bursaries (awarded to low income applicants) to offset undergraduate fees and, for postgraduates, full scholarships are available for most subjects, and are usually awarded competitively.

The gap between rich and poor students has narrowed since the introduction of the higher fees. This may be because universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that the number of disadvantaged students applying to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.

A study by the Centre for Economic Performance found that the introduction of tuition fees had &quot;increased funding per head, educational standards, rising enrolments, and a narrowing of the participation gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students&quot;.

==Adult education==
Adult education, continuing education or lifelong learning is offered to students of all ages. This can include the vocational qualifications mentioned above, and also:
* One or two year access courses, to allow adults without suitable qualifications access to university.
* The Open University runs undergraduate and postgraduate distance learning programmes.
* The Workers&#x27; Educational Association offers large number of semi-recreational courses, with or without qualifications, made available by Local Education Authorities under the guise of Adult Education. Courses are available in a wide variety of areas, such as holiday languages, arts, crafts and yacht navigation.

==National qualifications frameworks==

The two qualifications frameworks in England are the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF), for qualifications regulated by Ofqual, and the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) for qualifications granted by bodies with degree awarding powers, overseen by the Quality Assurance Agency. These share a common numbering scheme for their levels, which was also used for the earlier Qualifications and Credit Framework. The RQF is linked to the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and the FHEQ to the Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area (QF-EHEA).

==Standards==
The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of British 15-year-olds as 13th in the world in literacy, mathematics, and science with the average British student scoring 503.7, well above the OECD average of 493. Primary school children in England were 4th in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study for reading skills in 2021.

The United Nations ranks the United Kingdom 7th in the Education Index, measuring educational attainment, GDP per capita and life expectancy, ahead most of Europe. From 1997 to 2010, the Labour government introduced city academies in areas of social and economic deprivation. More former local authority schools, deemed &quot;inadequate&quot; or &quot;requiring improvement&quot; by inspectors, transitioned to an academy trust are now rated &quot;good&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot;. 

Academies were established in most disadvantaged areas, they are the key element in the drive to raise standards; raising aspirations and creating opportunity in some of the most disadvantaged communities. By 2015, more students were in &quot;good&quot; and &quot;outstanding&quot; rated schools from all social backgrounds than 2010. This growth in the academy system coincides with the improvement across schools in England, with 88% of all schools rated &quot;good&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot;, an improvement from 68% in August 2010.

==Funding==
Since 2018, English schools have been funded through a national formula. In August 2019, it was announced that the budget for schools and high needs would be increased by 6% (£2.6 billion) in 2020–21, £4.8 billion in 2021-22 and £7.1 billion in 2022-23 respectively – plus an extra £1.5 billion per year to fund additional pensions costs for teachers. This new funding includes £780 million in 2020–21 to support children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND).

<doc id="335453" wikidata="Q3108729" url="?curid=335453" title="Mike Rann">
<text>Michael David Rann, , (born 5 January 1953) is an Australian former politician who was the 44th premier of South Australia from 2002 to 2011. He was later Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 2013 to 2014, and Australian ambassador to Italy, Albania, Libya and San Marino from 2014 to 2016.

Rann grew up in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, completing a Bachelor and Master of Arts in political science at the University of Auckland. Before entering Parliament, Rann worked as an advisor to South Australian Labor Parliamentarians.

Rann became leader of the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party and South Australian Leader of the Opposition in 1994 and led the party to minority government at the 2002 election. He resigned as Premier in October 2011 and was succeeded by Jay Weatherill. Rann is the third-longest serving Premier of South Australia behind Thomas Playford IV and John Bannon and served a record 17 years as South Australian Labor parliamentary leader from 1994 to 2011. He was a South Australian MP in the House of Assembly from the 1985 election and Father of the House from the 2010 election until his parliamentary resignation on 13 January 2012.

==Early life==
Rann was born in Sidcup, Kent, England. His father was an electrician who had served at El Alamein in World War II. His mother was employed in an armaments factory. Most of Rann&#x27;s childhood was spent in the care of his father in South London. In 1962, when he was nine, his family emigrated from Blackfen to Mangakino, a small town north of Taupō on the Waikato River in New Zealand. His family then moved to Matamata, then to Birkenhead, New Zealand on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore where he attended Northcote College.

He completed a Bachelor and a Master of Arts in political science at the University of Auckland. He was Vice President of the New Zealand Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and editor of the student newspaper &quot;Craccum&quot;. As a member of Princes Street Labour, he also spent considerable time working on New Zealand Labour Party campaigns including that of Mike Moore. After university, Rann was a political journalist for the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation. Haydon Manning has stated that &quot;it was reported that&quot; Rann &quot;struggled with being an objective reporter&quot;.

Rann visited his brother Chris in Adelaide during 1977. Shortly afterwards he moved to that city, to carry out a position with then Premier Don Dunstan&#x27;s Industrial Democracy Unit. He subsequently worked as Dunstan&#x27;s press secretary, speech writer and adviser, and went on to serve Labor premiers Des Corcoran and John Bannon after Dunstan&#x27;s retirement from politics. Manning has stated that one commentator reported that Rann was &quot;frankly inspired by Dunstan&#x27;s idealism&quot; as opposed to &quot;Bannon&#x27;s cool electoral pragmatism&quot;. Rann sometimes talked during this period of his ambitions to one day become Premier himself. Meanwhile, Rann wrote speeches on, and assisted in policy development for, civil liberties, Aboriginal land rights, gay and women&#x27;s rights, and opposition to uranium mining. Revealing a vein of idealism, his early predilection was left of centre.

==Parliament==
Rann was elected to Parliament as the Member for the safe Labor seat of Briggs in north Adelaide at the 1985 election. After the 1989 election, he entered the ministry, becoming Minister for Employment and Further Education, Minister of Youth Affairs, Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Minister assisting in Ethnic Affairs.

As Minister for Employment and Further Education he established the Kickstart employment scheme, the South Australian Youth Conservation Corps, presided over a large expansion of TAFE, and signed an agreement in 1992 between Le Cordon Bleu, the Swiss Hotel Association, and the Regency College of TAFE to establish an international hospitality and cooking school, with Le Cordon Bleu school established at the Regency Park location. He introduced the legislation in 1991 to establish the new University of South Australia, now the biggest university in the state. As a member of the Australian Education Council he played a key role in 1992 in the creation of ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, with shared funding of TAFE by Federal as well as state governments. As Minister of Aboriginal Affairs he campaigned for a clean-up of Maralinga lands affected by nuclear tests in the 1950s and legislated in 1991 to return the sacred Ooldea lands to the Maralinga Tjarutja people. As Minister of Tourism he legislated in 1993 to establish the South Australian Tourism Commission and had ministerial responsibility for the Australian Formula One Grand Prix.

Labor lost government at the 1993 election in a landslide due to the State Bank collapse, falling to only 10 seats. After the election, Rann was first elected as Deputy Leader of the Opposition under Lynn Arnold. However, when Arnold resigned a few months later, Rann succeeded him as Parliamentary Leader of the Opposition in September 1994. As Opposition Leader Rann launched a &quot;Labor Listens&quot; strategy designed to re-connect with voters and vigorously opposed the privatisation of water services and electricity assets. Assisted by Liberal government leaks he exploited their internal divisions. Following the ousting of Premier Dean Brown by John Olsen, Rann released a series of damaging Cabinet documents and was involved in a prolonged and bitter legal battle with Premier Olsen.

Rann went into the 1997 election as a decided underdog. However, he turned the campaign into a &quot;referendum on privatisation.&quot; Under Rann&#x27;s leadership, Labor regained much of what it had lost in its severe defeat of four years earlier. Labor picked up a massive 9.4 percent swing, still the largest against a sitting government on record in South Australia. It also more than doubled its seat count compared to 1993, and actually came within three seats of making Rann premier. Olsen was forced into a minority government, supported by the Nationals and independents.

==Premier (2002–2011)==

Rann remained Leader of the Opposition until the 2002 election. The Labor opposition took two seats from the Liberals. This left Labor one short of majority government while the Liberals were four seats short. Despite this, it initially appeared Rob Kerin, who had succeeded Olsen as premier in 2001, would remain in office with the support of four conservative-leaning independents. However, one of those independents, former Liberal Peter Lewis, agreed to support Labor in return for a constitutional convention and being named Speaker. On paper, this allowed Rann to form government by one seat. In response, Kerin announced that in accordance with precedent set by Don Dunstan three decades earlier, he would stay in office until Labor demonstrated it had support on the floor of the House of Assembly. He argued that since the Liberals had won a bare majority of the two-party vote, he still had a mandate to govern. Three weeks of deadlock ended when the new legislature met for the first time. With Lewis presiding, Kerin proposed a motion of confidence in his government. The motion failed, and Kerin&#x27;s government immediately resigned. Rann then advised the Governor, Marjorie Jackson-Nelson that he could form a government, which was duly sworn in the next day. Rann later secured the support of conservative independent Rory McEwen and the Nationals&#x27; Karlene Maywald by adding them to his cabinet. He also agreed to back Liberal-turned-independent Bob Such as Speaker after Lewis retired.

In addition to Premier, Rann also served as the Minister for Economic Development, Minister for Social Inclusion, Minister for the Arts, and Minister for Sustainability and Climate Change. Rann was appointed chairman of a new Australian Federation Council in July 2006, a council which was created to improve state-federal ties. Rann also ran for the national presidency of the ALP in the ALP National Executive in August 2006, and made senior-vice president with 27 percent of the vote. As such, he also served a rotation of the Presidency of the ALP National Executive in 2008.

===Popularity in earlier years===

Rann&#x27;s earlier achievements included raising job numbers and lowering unemployment, increasing new project funding, increasing expenditure on schools, university, health and mental illness, halving rough-sleeping in the streets, making the state home to the largest amount of wind power in Australia, developing hot rock power, and utilising solar power for the public service. South Australia&#x27;s debt achieved a AAA rating under the Rann Labor government, prompting Business SA chief executive Peter Vaughan to praise Labor&#x27;s economic management.

Rann subsidised theatres, added Guggenheim galleries, introduced the Festival of Ideas and Adelaide&#x27;s Thinker in Residence program, and encouraged the idea that film festivals fund movies, leading to the creation of the Adelaide Film Festival and establishing the Adelaide Film Festival Investment Fund as backing. He provided the funding to make three major festivals annual rather than biennial: WOMADelaide (from 2003), the Adelaide Fringe (from 2007) and the Adelaide Festival of Arts (from 2012) .

Rann was comfortably re-elected in 2006, taking 28 seats to the Liberals&#x27; 15—to date, Labor&#x27;s largest majority since the abolition of the Playmander. Labor also garnered a two-party vote of 56.8 percent, a significant comeback from its low of 39 percent in 1993 under Arnold.

Rann personally likened his government to Dunstan&#x27;s, stating &quot;I&#x27;m a totally different person to Don Dunstan, but in the 70s for different reasons South Australia stood head and shoulders above the crowd. We stood out, we were leaders. The federal government is setting up a social inclusion unit based on ours. Again it&#x27;s about us not only making a difference locally, but being a kind of model for others, which is what Dunstan used to say he wanted us to be ... a laboratory and a leader for the future.&quot; Rann says he expected other reforms to be based upon those enacted under his government, citing the state&#x27;s strategic plan, a 10-year framework for the development of government and business. &quot;It&#x27;s a plan for the state, not just promises at each election. A lot of colleagues interstate thought I&#x27;d gone mad when we named targets. Well we didn&#x27;t want to set targets we could easily pass and then pat ourselves on the back for, what&#x27;s the point of that?&quot; A total of 79 economic and social targets were set, and in 2010 Rann commented &quot;with most of its targets achieved, on track or within reach&quot;. However, the state&#x27;s Integrated Design Commissioner, Tim Horton, said in 2011: &quot;Its targets are really great, but I don&#x27;t think any of us have signed on to why those targets exist or what we can do to further them. It&#x27;s a top-down approach. I worry the document exists in the minds of agencies but not in the minds of people.&quot;

During Rann&#x27;s first and second terms, Rann was often the most popular Premier in the country, with his approach to government generally moderate and crisis-free.
Newspoll early in 2007 saw Rann peak at a historic 64 per cent as Preferred Premier, and 61 per cent on the two-party-preferred vote. University of Adelaide Professor of Politics Clem Macintyre said that after the State Bank collapse, Rann had to re-establish Labor&#x27;s credentials as an economic manager as a matter of urgency, and &quot;in that sense Rann had a whole lot of priorities to concentrate on that Dunstan didn&#x27;t even think about&quot;, with a legacy built on economic achievements, achieving the triple-A credit rating, as well as its capacity to deliver infrastructure projects.

Fourth quarter 2007 polling saw a reduction in the strong support for Rann&#x27;s Labor government since the previous election, on 54 percent of the two-party-preferred vote, a fall from the previous poll of five percent. Rann&#x27;s Preferred Premier rating was at 50 percent compared to 25 percent for then Liberal leader Martin Hamilton-Smith. Third quarter 2008 polling saw a more pronounced drop in the primary vote, down three to 38 percent, with the Liberal vote up five to 40 percent, breaking to a two-party vote of 50–50 after preferences – the Preferred Premier figure recorded a six-point drop to 48 percent for Rann and up three to 30 percent for Hamilton-Smith. Some commentators put the poll slump down to &quot;labour movement ructions&quot; over the underfunded WorkCover liability (see 2008 Parnell–Bressington filibuster), consolidation of rural health services, and the continued degradation of the River Murray.

Newspoll saw Labor back in a winning position on 54 to 46 in late 2008, and then 56 to 44 in early 2009 along with increases in the Preferred Premier rating. Polling taken from The Sunday Mail during the 50-50 polling suggested that whilst there had been large swings away from the government in country areas, polling held relatively firm at 2006 election levels in the metropolitan areas.

The 2009 Frome by-election saw Labor pick up a small increase in the two-party-preferred vote. This, coupled with the &quot;dodgy documents affair&quot;, also known as &quot;dodgy-gate&quot;, saw Hamilton-Smith step down from the Liberal leadership, to be replaced by Isobel Redmond.

===Affair allegations===
On 22 November 2009, Seven Network&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night&quot; current affairs program aired a paid television interview alleging that Rann had an affair with Michelle Chantelois, a Parliament House barmaid, between March 2004 and October 2005.

Rann commented before the interview went to air that claims of a sexual relationship were &quot;wildly sensational&quot;, and that once he had seen the program, he would respond with a &quot;brief statement&quot;. He also expressed frustration that he had been unable to &quot;clear the air&quot; because matters were before a court. The day after the allegations were aired, Rann called a press conference where he explicitly denied the allegations made in the interview, claimed the program was outrageous, and stated the claims were malicious lies aimed at damaging him politically and personally.

An out-of-court settlement was paid by Seven Network to Rann in February 2010 and with an apology issued for suggesting the affair had an effect on Rann discharging his duties as Premier of South Australia. Polling was conducted by &quot;The Advertiser&quot; in December 2009 with answers to questions revealing little voter interest in the allegations. Others suggested that it was the turning point for Rann&#x27;s decline, with the issue causing indirect damage over a sustained period of time.

He was also assaulted over this. The husband of Chantelois punched Mike Rann at the National Wine Centre.

===Third term===
The Rann Labor government won a third four-year term at the 2010 state election with 26 of 47 seats though with only 48.4 percent of the two-party preferred vote. It was the first Rann Labor election campaign that took to YouTube and social networking. As Labor held government until the 2014 state election, with four-year terms, it is the longest-serving period of a South Australian Labor government in history. Rann also served as Labor leader since 1994, a record period as Labor leader.

New and continued projects for Rann Labor&#x27;s third term were claimed to be the biggest infrastructure spend in the state&#x27;s history, which included rail electrification of Adelaide&#x27;s train lines, expansion of the Adelaide tram line, construction of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital, the Adelaide Oval redevelopment, expansion of the Adelaide Convention Centre, redesigning the River Torrens Riverbank precinct, expanding mining and defence industries, the Port Stanvac Desalination Plant, and continued various major road works including various upgrades to the North–South Corridor.

Rann conceded that public sector budget cuts introduced in the 2010 budget were not popular, but said that 2011 would bring new activities, such as progress on the multi-billion Olympic Dam expansion, after it had been held up by the global financial crisis. The cuts caused protest amongst unionists, but Rann defeated a motion against his leadership at the yearly Labor convention in 2010.

In early 2011, Rann reshuffled his cabinet after Deputy Premier and Treasurer Kevin Foley resigned from both positions but remained in the cabinet. Attorney-General John Rau became Deputy Premier and Jack Snelling became Treasurer.

The first Newspoll of the third term of the Rann Labor government in March 2011 showed Rann&#x27;s personal satisfaction-dissatisfaction rating at a new low of 30–59 and a two-party vote of 44–56, a swing against Labor of 4.4 percent since the 2010 election. Labor&#x27;s primary vote dived to 29 percent, down 8.5 percent, the Liberal vote remained at 42 percent, whilst the Greens surged to 14 percent, an increase of 6 percent, with &quot;other&quot; slightly higher. The subsequent Newspoll saw the two-party vote narrow to 46–54, a swing against Labor of just 2.4 percent, however there was no statistical change in Rann&#x27;s personal satisfaction-dissatisfaction ratings.

In late July 2011, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and &quot;The Advertiser&quot; reported that senior figures within Labor had indicated to Rann that the state party&#x27;s left and right factions had formally decided to replace Rann with Education Minister Jay Weatherill as party leader. A day later, Rann confirmed he would stand down and undergo a party leadership transition to Weatherill, with the handover occurring in October 2011.

Rann formally resigned from the premiership on 21 October 2011, and Weatherill was elected unopposed as his successor.

Rann resigned from parliament on 13 January 2012 which created an 11 February 2012 Ramsay by-election. Zoe Bettison easily retained the seat for Labor with only a slight swing against her, and Ramsay remained the safest of Labor&#x27;s lower house seats.

==Post-parliamentary career==

Rann&#x27;s post-parliamentary appointments include the new Urban Policy Forum created by the federal government, as a professor in the School of Social and Policy Studies with Flinders University and as a visiting fellowship in political studies at the University of Auckland. He has also joined the International Leadership Council of The Climate Group, and the International Advisory Board of the Ecological Sequestration Trust. Rann was also appointed adjunct professor in public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, Fellow for Democracy and Development at the Washington, D.C.-based Center for National Policy and as member of the Council of the Royal Institution Australia.

Rann was appointed chair of Low Carbon Australia Pty Ltd in early 2012, the federal government&#x27;s &quot;green bank&quot; providing finance to companies to reduce carbon emissions and to the International Leadership Council of The Climate Group.

Rann was announced on 23 August 2012 as the next Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Rann also assumed the role of Permanent Representative to the United Nations International Maritime Organisation, Commonwealth War Graves Commissioner and Trustee of the Imperial War Museum. Mike Rann acted as Australia&#x27;s Ambassador to Italy, San Marino, Albania and Libya. He is also Australia&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nation&#x27;s Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Programme.

As of 2020, he works as a business consultant for the Rann Strategy Group.

In 2022, Rann joined the board of directors of Spacetalk.

==Personal life==
Rann was married to Jenny Russell until the late 1990s and had two children with her, David and Eleanor. On 15 July 2006, he married his second wife, actress Sasha Carruozzo. It was revealed in December 2011 that she was undergoing treatment for breast cancer.

In 2016, Rann&#x27;s son, David, was appointed media advisor to South Australian Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis.

In 2020, Rann announced that he intended to purchase an apartment in Adelaide and that he would then live six months of the year in Adelaide, and the other six in Puglia, Italy, where he would produce olive oil.

<text>Millersview is an unincorporated community in Concho County, Texas, United States. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 75 in 2000. The town is the only one in the United States named Millersview.

==History==
The settlement was given the name Millersview in honor of Edward D. Miller, who co-founded the town with Henry Barr. The village had a post office that opened in 1903 and was operational until the early 1990s. Millersview was given credit for having a windmill and a Woodmen of the World lodge in 1908 by county advertising materials. By 1914, the town boasted three churches, three mercantile businesses, a grocer, a gin, and a grain, hay, and feed company, with a population of 160. By 1931, the population was estimated to be 300; however, by 1933, it had decreased to 100; by 1939, it had increased once again, to 250. After that, the population fell, partly as a result of the 1950s Texas drought. Millersview had the post office, four businesses, and five churches in 1963 when the population was estimated to be 175 people. A population of 75 was recorded between 1970 and 2000.

Although Millersview is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 76862.

On May 7, 1995, an F0 tornado struck Millersview. Another F0 tornado struck the community on May 30, 2012. The tornado had a brief touchdown with no damage.

==Geography==
Millersview is located at the intersection of Farm to Market Roads 2134 and 765 near the west fork of Mustang Creek, southeast of Paint Rock and east of San Angelo in Concho County.

==Education==
The Mustang School, located on Mustang Creek, was the first school in the area. The Millersview school had 92 pupils and two instructors in the 1907–08 school year. Eight teachers taught elementary and high school classes at the institution in 1940. Following the 1957–1958 academic year, the high school was closed; in the next academic year, four teachers taught the elementary classes. In 1963, the school stayed open. Its school had closed by 1989, and students were studying in Eden. Today, the community is served by the Paint Rock Independent School District.

<text>&quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; is a song by American singer Madonna from the soundtrack of the 1987 film of the same name. Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, it was released in Europe as the soundtrack&#x27;s lead single on June 29, 1987 and in the United States on 30 June 1987. An uptempo pop song, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; continued the singer&#x27;s fascination with Latin pop, a genre she had previously explored on her single &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;. It features instrumentation from drums, bass, and trumpets, and has lyrics sung both in English and Spanish. While shooting for the film, then called &quot;Slammer&quot;, Madonna had requested Leonard to develop a song that captured the nature of her character; the producer worked on a demo and, afterwards, Madonna added the lyrics and decided to rename the song, as well as the film, to &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;.

Upon release, the song received positive to mixed reviews from music critics; its similarities to &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; were both praised and criticized. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; became Madonna&#x27;s sixth single to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, which made her the artist with the most number one hits in the 1980s decade. It was also successful overseas, reaching the top of the charts in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy, Ireland, and Belgium. The song was nominated for Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 1988 Grammy Awards, and for Best Original Song at the 45th Golden Globe Awards. The accompanying music video mixed together footage from &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; and scenes of Madonna wandering around a park, decked out in a Latin-inspired outfit. The track was included on the singer&#x27;s Who&#x27;s That Girl (1987) and Rebel Heart (2015―2016) concert tours, and has been covered for tribute albums.

== Background and release ==
In October 1986, Madonna began filming her third motion picture, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;. James Foley, who had worked with the singer on her music videos for &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; and &quot;Live to Tell&quot; (1986), was chosen at her own request to direct the film. Originally titled &quot;Slammer&quot;, in the movie Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman accused of homicide who, after being released on parole, becomes determined to clear her name. Along with Loudon Trott (played by Griffin Dunne), she gets caught up in &quot;36 hours of high adventure&quot;, culminating in a scene where she interrupts a wedding to reveal the identity of the real murderer. Madonna began working on the soundtrack in March 1987; having some specific ideas in her mind about the music of the film, the singer contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had helped to write and produce her third studio album &quot;True Blue&quot;. She wanted the soundtrack to &quot;stand on its own as well as support and enhance what was happening on screen&quot;.

The singer asked Leonard to create an uptempo title song that captured the nature of her character, so the producer created a demo while she worked on the melody and lyrics. However, Madonna couldn&#x27;t come up with a word that rhymed with &quot;Slammer&quot;, so she changed the song and the film&#x27;s title to &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;, considering it to be a better name. Leonard, who supported the title change, recalled that it was recorded in one day, with the singer recording her vocals in one single take; the following day, additional instrumentation from guitars and percussions were added by both Leonard and Bray. In Europe, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; was officially released as the soundtrack&#x27;s lead single on June 29, 1987. The next day, it was released on the United States. Years later, it was included on Madonna&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;Celebration&quot; (2009).

== Composition ==

&quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; was written and produced by Madonna and Leonard, while Michael Barbiero and Steve Thompson were in charge of mixing. Daryl Easlea, one of the authors of &quot;Madonna: Blond Ambition&quot;, wrote that &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; continued the singer&#x27;s exploration of Latin music, which she had already introduced on her previous single &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;. It is a dance-pop song that&#x27;s divided in three parts: Verse, refrain, and bridge. Its instrumentation includes a drum machine, trumpets, and a &quot;bubbling bass synth line&quot;. Modulation is used on the verse, while the vocals are &quot;wonderfully multi-tracked&quot;, specifically in the phrase &quot;She&#x27;s smiling/an invitation to the dance&quot;. On the &quot;earworm&quot; refrain, Madonna sings both in English and Spanish, &quot;¿Quién es esa niña?/Who&#x27;s that girl?/Señorita, más fina/Who&#x27;s that girl?&quot; The bridge has Madonna singing the phrase &quot;What can help me now&quot;. Several lines are combined on its fade out, a technique that had already been used by artists like The Beach Boys and R.E.M.

According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing Inc., &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; is set in common time in the key of A minor with a medium tempo of 104 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor, with Madonna&#x27;s vocals spanning between G3 to B4. The song has a basic sequence of basic chord progression sequence of Am9–G–Csus2–Am9–G–Dm. The lyrics, which are sung in the third person, talk about &quot;how you should be careful around this extremely hot girl because she&#x27;ll break your heart&quot;, according to &quot;Stereogum&quot;″s Tom Breihan. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; is one of Madonna&#x27;s songs that reference her thoughts about &quot;&#x27;girlhood&#x27; as powerfully productive&quot;, as noted by Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of &quot;Madonna&#x27;s Drowned Worlds&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
Upon release, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; received generally positive to mixed reviews. Daryl Easlea said it was, &quot;by far and away, the best song of the soundtrack&quot;. Rikky Rooksby called it delightful, further adding that it was one of the singer&#x27;s &quot;best takes on her original music style&quot;. On Matthew Rettenmund &#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia Madonnica&quot;, he classified &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; as a &quot;laid-back, effortlessly haunting&quot; song. On his of the singer, J. Randy Taraborrelli described it as &quot;quintessential Madonna [...] funky, sassy and melodic&quot;. Stephen Holden, from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, opined that, &quot;[the movie] may not have burned up the box office, but [...] Madonna&#x27;s bilingual title song has the buoyant bounce of an acrobat doing somersaults on a trampoline&quot;. While &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine named it &quot;one of her most compelling musical efforts&quot;, Jim Zebora from the &quot;Record-Journal&quot; opined it was a &quot;joy to hear&quot;. Robert Matthew-Walker wrote: &quot;if &#x27;light and airy&#x27; describes Madonna&#x27;s performance [in &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;], such a phrase can also be aptly applied to the title song [...] a delightful mixture of English and Spanish/Puerto Rican [...] a generous compliment to mid-1980s New York&quot;.

The song&#x27;s similarity to &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, was both praised and criticized. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Andrew Unterberger pointed out that both songs share a &quot;contagious chorus and sparkling production&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Vince Aletti said that, &quot;bobbing up in the wake of &#x27;Isla&#x27;, [&#x27;Who&#x27;s That Girl&#x27;] grabs hold with its bright bilingual chant&quot;. An opinion that was shared by Joe Brown, from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, who added that, &quot;truth be told, her Berlitz treatment does render the repetitiveness of the lyrics more lilting&quot;. For Louis Virtel from The Backlot, &quot;although [Madonna]&#x27;d give us a more timeless tune in that vein, &#x27;Who’s That Girl?&#x27; is still a sexy little tribute to those minxes you just can’t catch up with&quot;. Similarly, Joe Morgan from &quot;Gay Star News&quot; said that, despite not being &quot;the best time [Madonna] was influenced by Spain, it certainly [isn&#x27;t] the worst [...] [it&#x27;s] a great fun song&quot;. Both &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Jude Rogers and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Chuck Arnold deemed it inferior to &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, nonetheless, the latter also deemed it a &quot;tropical delight [...] pure enchantment&quot;. Writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that, even though it lacks the &quot;freshness&quot; of &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, &quot;there’s a slightly haunted quality to the delivery of the titular phrase that lets &#x27;Who’s That Girl&#x27; linger after it’s done playing&quot;.

Despite pointing out its &quot;slick and strong&quot; beats, Tom Breihan called &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; mediocre and uninspired, adding that it sounded as if &quot;[Madonna and Leonard] had taken &quot;everything&quot; they&#x27;d &quot;just&quot; done on &#x27;La Isla Bonita&#x27; and hit[ting] repeat&quot;. The singer&#x27;s vocals were criticized by Brown for being &quot;electronically speeded up, smoothed, sweetened and split into Chipmunk harmonies [...] she comes out sounding like a computer-generated clone&quot;. Breihan added that she did not sound &quot;comfortable or fluid&quot; singing in Spanish. For AllMusic, Erlewine felt the song wasn&#x27;t among Madonna&#x27;s best work and called it forgettable. On a similar note, it was named Madonna&#x27;s &quot;least-remembered No. 1&quot; by Matthew Jacobs from the &quot;HuffPost&quot;. The staff of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; added that, &quot;only hardcore fans [will] remember this lightweight [...] less ponderous sequel to &#x27;La Isla Bonita&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; was nominated for Best Original Song at the 45th Golden Globe Awards, and for the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 30th ceremony.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; debuted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 43 the week of July 11, 1987, becoming Madonna&#x27;s 12th consecutive single to be named the week&#x27;s top new entry. After it reached the chart&#x27;s seventh spot on August 8, and gave the singer her 13th consecutive top 10 hit, it tied her with Lionel Richie as the singer with the longest string of consecutive top 10 hits in the 1980s decade up until that point. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; reached the Hot 100&#x27;s first position on August 22. As Madonna&#x27;s sixth number one single, it gave her several records: She surpassed Lionel Richie, Hall &amp; Oates, and Phill Collins as the artist with the most number one hits in the 1980s; she became one of only two female singers to score six number ones ―and the only one to do it as a solo artist, and achieved her third number one from a movie, following &quot;Crazy for You&quot; ―from &quot;Vision Quest&quot; (1985)― and &quot;Live to Tell&quot; ―from &quot;At Close Range&quot;. According to Warner Bros. Records executive Lou Dennis, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; was the best-selling cassette single from the label up at that point. The single peaked within the top five positions of the Adult Contemporary chart. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; came in at numbers 42 and 48 on the official &quot;Billboard&quot; year-end chart and Dance year-end chart, respectively. In Canada, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; debuted on the 83rd position of &quot;RPM&quot;″s Top Singles chart on the week of July 11, 1987 and, one month later, it peaked at number one.

In &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot;″s European Airplay Top 50, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; debuted at number 3 on July 18, 1987, the highest entry in the chart&#x27;s history according to the magazine. It topped the chart by August 8, and remained on that position for two weeks, her seventh number one there and &quot;another unique achievement&quot;. It peaked at number two, just behind Michael Jackson and Siedah Garrett&#x27;s &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;, on the European Hot 100 Singles chart. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; found success elsewhere: It reached the first position in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Italy. In the latter country, it spent 11 consecutive weeks at the top of the &quot;Musica e dischi&quot; charts, and was the year&#x27;s best-selling single. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; debuted at the third position of the UK Singles Chart on July 18, and, one week later, reached the first spot, becoming Madonna&#x27;s fifth number one there; it spent 10 weeks on the chart overall, and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). According to &quot;Music Week&quot; magazine, over 376,498 copies of the single have been sold in the United Kingdom as of 2008. It peaked within the top 5 of the charts in Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, and New Zealand. In Australia, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; reached the top 10.

== Music video ==
=== Background and synopsis ===
Peter Rosenthal directed the music video for &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;, which was shot over two days at A&amp;M Soundstages in Hollywood, California. Production was in charge of James Foley and Joel Stillman for Broadcast Arts Inc. It alternates footage from &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;, with scenes of Madonna decked out as a &quot;hip Latina&quot;, with an oversized grey jacket over a black bustier, short pants, pork pie hat, and spiky brown hair.

It begins with Madonna entering a park, catching the attention of a man and a group of children. Interspersed footage of her singing the track, wandering around the park, and scenes of the movie, play next. The kids and the man then take her to a darkened room, where she meets a fortune teller; the woman shows Madonna the High Priestess tarot card, which displays a caricature of her character Nikki Finn. The singer looks up and discovers the woman&#x27;s disappeared; she then finds a key to a chest containing a shiny white crystal, which reflects an animated sequence of the Nikki Finn caricature. The man and the children show up again, and the video ends with them dancing &quot;adoringly&quot; with Madonna.

=== Release and reception ===
&quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; premiered on MTV the week of July 4, 1987, and was one of the year&#x27;s most heavily rotated clips on European television. Years later, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; was included on Madonna&#x27;s 2009 compilation &quot;&quot;. Upon release, critical reviews ranged from positive to mixed; Matthew Rettenmund compared the singer&#x27;s appearance in the video to that of Michael Jackson, and applauded the clip for being &quot;movie-plugging&quot;, yet strong enough to &quot;stand[s] alone&quot;. Nonetheless, he noted that it was &quot;rarely played&quot; the years following its release. From website This Is Dig!, Mark Elliot also compared the singer&#x27;s look to Jackson&#x27;s and praised the &quot;charming, low-key&quot; video. Elliot also noted nods to the Pied Piper of Hamelin, a character he felt Madonna had already referenced on her music video for &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; (1986). In &quot;High Concept: Movies and Marketing in Hollywood&quot;, author Justin Wyatt pointed out that, throughout the clip, &quot;Madonna, the singer, gazes longingly at Madonna, the comedienne/actress&quot;.

A less favorable review came from Vincent Canby, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;; according to him, the video&#x27;s purpose was to promote the film, but ended up showcasing &quot;everything that&#x27;s least attractive about it&quot;. Canby was also critical of the persona Madonna adopted for the clip, comparing it negatively to her comedic performance in the movie: &quot;It appeals neither to people who&#x27;ve never seen her before nor to anyone who&#x27;s admired the sometimes brazenly erotic and funny performer [she] is in her best music videos&quot;, he concluded.

== Live performances and covers ==

Madonna has performed the song on two of her concert tours: Who&#x27;s That Girl (1987) and Rebel Heart (2015―2016). On the first one, it was sung as the concert&#x27;s first encore. The singer wore a bright red flamenco dress, and sang the track assisted by her backup singers Niki Haris, Donna De Lory, and Debra Parson. At the end of the performance, she stepped out to the front of the darkened stage and sang the phrase &quot;Who&#x27;s that girl&quot; repeatedly in a &quot;sad chant that became increasingly self-absorbed and haunting&quot;. The number was deemed one of the concert&#x27;s weaker moments by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Richard Harrington. Two different performances can be found on the videos &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl: Live in Japan&quot; and &quot;Ciao Italia: Live from Italy&quot;, filmed in Tokyo on June and in Turin on September, respectively.

An acoustic rendition of &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; was done on the singer&#x27;s Rebel Heart Tour. The number featured Day of the Dead iconography and found Madonna playing guitar. After finishing the song, she said: &quot;I&#x27;m still trying to figure out who I am after all these years [...] Does anyone ever really know?&quot;. For &quot;Rollling Stone&quot;″s Rob Sheffield, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; was the evening&#x27;s &quot;emotional highlight&quot;.

In 1998, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra made an instrumental version of the song for &quot;Material Girl: RPO Plays Music of Madonna&quot;. One year later, a sound-alike cover was done by The Countdown Singers, which was included on &quot;Hit Parade of 80&#x27;s, Vol. 2&quot;. American band The Bubonic Plague recorded a synth-pop rendition of &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Through the Wilderness&quot; (2007); this cover was criticized by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Stephen M. Deusner, who deemed it uninspired and felt was &quot;beyond Bubonic Plague&#x27;s ability to salvage it&quot;. In 2021, the song was sampled by Dutch DJs Joe Stone and Jack Wins on their song &quot;Light Up My Life&quot;; Madonna herself approved of the sampling.

<doc id="335475" wikidata="Q196253" url="?curid=335475" title="Hughes Aircraft Company">
<text>The Hughes Aircraft Company was a major American aerospace and defense contractor founded on February 14, 1934 by Howard Hughes in Glendale, California, as a division of Hughes Tool Company. The company produced the Hughes H-4 Hercules aircraft, the atmospheric entry probe carried by the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft, and the AIM-4 Falcon guided missile.

Hughes Aircraft was founded to build Hughes&#x27; H-1 Racer world speed record aircraft, and it later modified other aircraft for his transcontinental and global circumnavigation speed record flights. The company relocated to Culver City, California, in 1940 and began manufacturing aircraft parts as a subcontractor. Hughes attempted to mold it into a major military aircraft manufacturer during World War II. However, its early military projects ended in failure, with millions of dollars in U.S. government funds expended but only three aircraft actually built, resulting in a highly publicized U.S. Senate investigation into alleged mismanagement. The U.S. military consequently hesitated to award new aircraft contracts to Hughes Aircraft, prompting new management in the late 1940s to instead pursue contracts for fire-control systems and guided missiles, which were new technologies. The company soon became a highly profitable industry leader in these fields.

In a 1953 accounting maneuver designed to reduce his income tax liabilities, Howard Hughes donated most of Hughes Aircraft&#x27;s stock and assets to a charity he created, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), and subsequently ceased managing the company directly. Hughes retained a small cadre of engineers under his personal control as the &quot;Hughes Tool Company Aircraft Division&quot;, which initially operated from the same Culver City complex as Hughes Aircraft, despite being separately owned and managed. This entity subsequently became fully independent from Hughes Aircraft and changed its name to Hughes Helicopters. After Hughes&#x27; 1976 death, Hughes Aircraft was acquired by General Motors from HHMI in 1985 and was put under the umbrella of Hughes Electronics which became DirecTV, until GM sold its assets to Raytheon in 1997.

==History==



During World War II the company designed and built several prototype aircraft at Hughes Airport. These included the famous Hughes H-4 Hercules, better known by the public&#x27;s nickname for it, the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;, the H-1 racer, D-2, and the XF-11. However the plant&#x27;s hangars at Hughes Airport, location of present-day Playa Vista in the Westside of Los Angeles, California, were primarily used as a branch plant for the construction of other companies&#x27; designs. At the start of the war Hughes Aircraft had only four full-time employees—by the end the number was 80,000. During the war, the company was awarded contracts to build B-25 struts, centrifugal cannons, and machine gun feed chutes.

===Post–World War II===
Hughes Aircraft was one of many aerospace and defense companies which flourished in Southern California during and after World War II and was at one time the largest employer in the area.

Yet, employment had dropped to 800 by 1947. By the summer of 1947 certain politicians had become concerned about Hughes&#x27; alleged mismanagement of the Spruce Goose and the XF-11 photo reconnaissance plane project. They formed a special committee to investigate Hughes which culminated in a much-followed Senate investigation, one of the first to be televised to the public. Despite a highly critical committee report, Hughes was cleared.

The company then expanded into the booming electronics field, eventually employing 3,300 Ph.D.s. Hughes hired Ira Eaker, Harold L. George, and Tex Thornton to run the company. By 1953, the company employed 17,000 and had $600,000,000 in government contracts.

In 1948 Hughes created a new division of the company, the Aerospace Group. Two Hughes engineers, Simon Ramo and Dean Wooldridge, had new ideas on the packaging of electronics to make complete fire control systems. Their MA-1 system combined signals from the aircraft&#x27;s radar with a digital computer to automatically guide the interceptor aircraft into the proper position for firing missiles. At the same time other teams were working with the newly formed US Air Force on air-to-air missiles, delivering the AIM-4 Falcon, then known as the F-98. The MA-1/Falcon package, with several upgrades, was the primary interceptor weapon system of the USAF for many years, lasting into the 1980s. Ramo and Wooldridge, having failed to reach an agreement with Howard Hughes regarding management problems, resigned in September 1953 and founded the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, later to join Thompson Products to form the Thompson-Ramo-Wooldridge based in Canoga Park, with Hughes leasing space for nuclear research programs (present day West Hills (Canoga Park)). The company became TRW in 1965, another aerospace company and a major competitor to Hughes Aircraft.

In 1951 Hughes Aircraft Co. built a missile plant in Tucson, Arizona due to Howard Hughes&#x27; fear that his Culver City, California plant could be attacked. By the end of that year, the U.S. Air Force had purchased the property and contracted Hughes (and subsequently Raytheon) to operate the site as Air Force Plant 44. 

Howard Hughes donated Hughes Aircraft to the newly formed Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) in 1953 allegedly as a way of avoiding taxes on its huge income. The next year, Lawrence A. &quot;Pat&quot; Hyland was hired as vice president and general manager of Hughes Aircraft; he would ultimately become company president and CEO after Howard Hughes&#x27; death in 1976.

Under Hyland&#x27;s guidance, the Aerospace Group continued to diversify and become massively profitable, and became a primary focus of the company. The company developed radar systems, electro-optical systems, the first working laser, aircraft computer systems, missile systems, ion-propulsion engines (for space travel), and many other advanced technologies. The &#x27;Electronic Properties Information Center&#x27; (EPIC) of the United States was hosted at the Hughes Culver City library in the 1970s. EPIC published the multi-volume &quot;Handbook of Electronic Materials&quot; as public documents.

Nobel Laureates Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann had Hughes connections: Feynman would hold weekly seminars at Hughes Research Laboratories; Gell-Mann shared an office with Malcolm Currie, later a chairman of the board and chief executive officer at Hughes Aircraft. Greg Jarvis and Ronald McNair, two of the astronauts on the last flight of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;, were Hughes alumni.

===Ground Systems Group===
Hughes Aircraft Ground Systems Group was located in Fullerton, California. The facility was 3 million square feet and included manufacturing, laboratories, offices, and a Munson road test course. It designed developed and produced the Air Defense Systems that replaced the Semi Automatic Defense Ground Environment (SAGE) in the United States with the Joint Surveillance System (JSS) AN/FYQ-93 including NORAD with Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) and provided defense systems and air traffic control systems around the world. These systems are massive and at its peak Ground Systems Group employed 15,000 people and generated revenue in excess of $1 billion per year.

These systems included the following Ground Systems Group subsystems: Computer H5118, Consoles HMD-22 and HMD-44, Liquid Crystal Large Screen Displays, and Software that set the standard for software development based on science and engineering starting with the Combat Grande System. Ground Systems Group was known to push technology envelopes in the computers, displays, local area networks, human interfaces, and software in their systems. They also blazed the path to very highly distributed human intensive systems.

=== Hughes Space and Communications Group ===

Hughes Space and Communications Group and the Hughes Space Systems Division built the world&#x27;s first geosynchronous communications satellite, Syncom, in 1963 and followed by the first geosynchronous weather satellite, ATS-1, in 1966. Later that year their Surveyor 1 made the first soft landing on the Moon as part of the lead-up to the Moon landings in Project Apollo. Hughes also built Pioneer Venus in 1978, which performed the first extensive radar mapping of Venus, and the &quot;Galileo&quot; probe that flew to Jupiter in the 1990s. The company built nearly 40 percent of commercial satellites in service worldwide in 2000.

===Hughes helicopter business===

In 1947, Howard Hughes redirected Hughes Aircraft&#x27;s efforts from airplanes to helicopters. The effort began in earnest in 1948, when helicopter manufacturer Kellett Aircraft Co. sold its latest design to Hughes for production. The XH-17 &quot;Sky Crane&quot; first flew in October 1952, but was commercially unsuccessful. In 1955, Howard Hughes split the helicopter production unit from the Hughes Aircraft Company, and reconstituted it with Hughes Tool Company, calling it Hughes Tool Company&#x27;s Aircraft Division. The Aircraft Division had a focus on the production of light helicopters, mainly the Hughes 269/300 and the OH-6 Cayuse/Hughes 500.

===Howard Hughes Medical Institute sells Hughes Aircraft Company===
Hughes left no will and following his death in 1976 there were numerous claims to his estate. A Hughes executive and a Hughes lawyer claimed they had the right to set up an &quot;executive committee&quot; to take over the running of the HHMI and its Hughes Aircraft subsidiary. The Attorney General of Delaware Richard R. Wier challenged this and filed suit in 1978. Charles M. Oberly continued the action when he became attorney general in 1983. Oberly stated he wished to see an independent board of trustees to ensure both that the institute fulfilled its charitable mission and that it did not continue to operate as a tax shelter.

In January 1984 Judge Grover C. Brown ruled that the Chancery Court should appoint the trustees because Hughes had not left a succession plan. Brown asked for both the executive committee and the attorney general&#x27;s office to submit a list of recommendations that he could approve. Brown approved a list in April 1984. In January 1985 the new board of trustees of the HHMI announced they would sell Hughes Aircraft either by private sale or public stock offering.

===Hughes Electronics Corporation===

On June 5, 1985, General Motors was announced as the winner of a secretive five-month sealed-bid auction. Other bidders included Ford Motor Company and Boeing. The purchase was completed on December 20, 1985, for an estimated $5.2 billion, $2.7 billion in cash and the rest in 50 million shares of GM Class H stock.

On December 31, 1985, General Motors merged Hughes Aircraft with its Delco Electronics unit to form Hughes Electronics Corporation, an independent subsidiary. The group then consisted of: Delco Electronics Corporation and Hughes Aircraft Company.

In August 1992 Hughes Aircraft completed its purchase of General Dynamics&#x27; missile businesses for $450 million. This brought the Tomahawk Cruise Missile, Advanced Cruise Missile, Standard missile, Stinger missile, Phalanx Close-in weapon system, and Rolling Airframe Missile into Hughes&#x27; portfolio.

In 1994 Hughes Electronics introduced DirecTV, the world&#x27;s first high-powered DBS service. In 1995 Hughes Electronic&#x27;s Hughes Space and Communications division became the largest supplier of commercial satellites. Also in 1995 the group purchased Magnavox Electronic Systems from the Carlyle Group. In 1996 Hughes Electronics and PanAmSat agree to merge their fixed satellite services into a new publicly held company, also called PanAmSat with Hughes Electronics as majority shareholder.

In 1995, Hughes Aircraft sold its Technology Products Division (automated wire and die bonder) to an investor group led by Citicorp and incorporated the division as Palomar Technologies. In 2008, Citicorp sold the bonder division to the current management team at Palomar Technologies.

In 1997 GM transferred Delco Electronics to its Delphi Automotive Systems business. Later that year the assets of Hughes Aircraft were sold to Raytheon for $9.5 billion. The remaining companies remained under the Hughes Electronics name and within GM.

In 2000, the Boeing Company purchased three units within Hughes Electronics Corp.: Hughes Space and Communications Co., Hughes Electron Dynamics, and Spectrolab Inc., in addition to Hughes Electronics&#x27; interest in HRL, the company&#x27;s primary research laboratory. The four joined Boeing Satellite Systems, a company subsidiary, later becoming the Satellite Development Center, part of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems.

In 2003 the remaining parts of Hughes Electronics (DirecTV, DirecTV Latin America, PanAmSat, Hughes Network Systems) were purchased by News Corporation from GM and renamed The DirecTV Group.

==Corporate legacy==
The wide range of science and technology developed by Hughes Aircraft never included medical applications because the company was owned by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). This restriction was imposed to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.

The money provided to HHMI by Hughes Aircraft led to major improvements in genetics and cancer research.

The city of Fullerton, California, named Hughes Drive after the site that the company formerly occupied before 1997. After Hughes closed, the city developed Amerige Heights, a residential community.

Darrow appeared as the character Avon, for which he was best known, in all but the first episode of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;. In the mid-to-late 1990s, he purchased the rights to &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; and attempted to produce a big-budget follow-up mini-series, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: A Rebellion Reborn&quot;. According to Darrow, it would have been set 25 years after the final episode of the BBC series.

His film credits are few, but include roles as doctors in &quot;The Raging Moon&quot; (1971) and the Bond movie &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002), for which he filmed but much of his material was deleted before the film was released in cinemas.

Darrow appeared in &quot;Emmerdale&quot; from 13 July 2009, playing Eddy Fox, Alan Turner&#x27;s friend; he knows Turner as &quot;Tank&quot;. He also played the character of Kaston Iago in the &quot;Kaldor City&quot; audio releases.

Darrow played the role of Sam Vimes in the 1998/99 touring production of the play based on Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Discworld novel &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;.

In 2004, Darrow was the subject of the fourth volume of MJTV&#x27;s &quot;The Actor Speaks&quot; audio CDs, featuring frank interviews and dramatic pieces, alongside guest Peter Miles, with a piece specifically written by Tanith Lee.

Darrow narrated the 2008 audio book of Terry Nation&#x27;s classic children&#x27;s story &quot;Rebecca&#x27;s World: Journey to the Forbidden Planet&quot; (2008)

In December 2011, Darrow voiced the character of Overseer Tremel in the Bioware MMORPG release &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;.

In 2012, Darrow returned to the role of Kerr Avon in Big Finish Productions&#x27; &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: The Liberator Chronicles&quot;, a series of dramatic readings which take place during Series One, Two and Three of the original show. He also reprised the part in &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: The Classic Audio Adventures&quot;, a full-cast audio drama series.

In 2015, Darrow starred as Paul Rand, the enigmatic business man in charge of the business institute Atlas in the interactive video game &quot;&quot;. 

Darrow was Patron of the University of York Astronomy Society (AstroSoc) from 1981 to 1984.

An extinct crocodile from the Miocene of Australia, &quot;Baru darrowi&quot;, was named after Darrow.

On 27 October 2018, Darrow appeared on (and won) a celebrity sci-fi edition of the quiz show &quot;Pointless&quot;, along with fellow &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; cast member Michael Keating.

In the mid-1960s Darrow married the actress Janet Lees Price. They were married almost fifty years, until her death in 2012, and lived in later life in Billingshurst, West Sussex.

== Illness and death ==
In his last years Darrow suffered a decline in health. In October 2014, he had an aortic aneurysm, and due to complications during its treatment, surgeons had to amputate both his legs.

<text>Baltimore (; , translated as &quot;fort of the jewels&quot;) is a village in western County Cork, Ireland. It is the main village in the parish of Rathmore and the Islands, the southernmost parish in Ireland. It is the main ferry port to Sherkin Island, Cape Clear Island and the eastern side of Roaring Water Bay (Loch Trasna) and Carbery&#x27;s Hundred Isles.

Although the name &quot;Baltimore&quot; is an anglicisation of the Irish meaning &quot;town of the big house&quot;, the Irish-language name for Baltimore is that of the O&#x27;Driscoll castle, &quot;Dún na Séad&quot; or &quot;Dunashad&quot; (&quot;fort of the jewels&quot;). The restored castle is open to the public and overlooks the town.

In ancient times, &quot;Dunashad&quot; was considered a sanctuary for druids and the place name is associated in Irish mythology with the feast of Bealtaine.

==History==
Baltimore was a seat of one of Ireland&#x27;s most ancient dynasties, the Corcu Loígde, former Kings of Tara and Kings of Munster. Evidence of ancient settlement in the area includes a number of ring fort, fulacht fiadh, souterrain, lime kiln and holy well sites in Baltimore townland. Dunasead Castle, also known as Baltimore Castle, was the site of a fortification from at least the early 13th century.

Baltimore is mentioned in an entry in &quot;The Genealogy of Corca Laidhe&quot; (translated by John O&#x27;Donovan in 1876) which refers to events in December 1413. According to the account, the &quot;Mayor of the City of Waterford&quot;, Simon Wicken, together with his bailiffs and armed men, sailed to &quot;Balintimore&quot; on Christmas Eve. While he was invited, by the O&#x27;Driscolls of Dunasead, to join in the Christmas festivities, Wicken subsequently captured and took the O&#x27;Driscoll family back to Waterford - as prisoners. Another early mention is in a pardon dated 13 December 1551 to the O&#x27;Driscolls of &quot;Ballitimore&quot;, No. 905 in the Fiants of King Edward VI.

An English Puritan colony was founded at Baltimore about 1605 by Sir Thomas Crooke, 1st Baronet, with the blessing of King James I of England; Crooke agreed to rent the land from Sir Fineen O&#x27;Driscoll, Chief of the Name of clan O&#x27;Driscoll. It was a lucrative centre of the pilchard schools and therefore of commercial fishing, and in the early 1600s a pirate base, where not only all the justices including the vice-admiral of Munster, but the entire population, were involved; all the women of Baltimore were reputed to be either the wives or mistresses of pirates. These activities were unaffected by official discouragement under King James, but English piracy generally declined shortly thereafter, partly due to competition from Barbary pirates. In 1607 Baltimore became a market town, with the right to hold a weekly market and two annual fairs. After Crooke&#x27;s death, political control of the town passed to Sir Walter Coppinger.

The town was depopulated in 1631 in the Sack of Baltimore, a raid by Barbary pirates from either Ottoman Algeria or Salé (Morocco). Between 100 and 237 English settlers and local Irish people were abducted and sold into the Barbary slave trade, of whom only two or three ever saw Ireland again. Reminders of the incident still exist in the form of pub names, like the &quot;Algiers Inn&quot;. The survivors fled to Skibbereen, and the ruins of Baltimore were left almost deserted for generations. A slow recovery began in the 18th-century, and by the early 1800s the village was starting to prosper again, only to suffer further losses in the Great Famine.

Baltimore was granted borough status in 1612 with a town government consisting of a &quot;sovereign&quot; (Sir Thomas Crooke) and twelve burgesses. It returned two members to the Irish House of Commons from 1613 to 1801. It was disenfranchised by the Acts of Union 1800.

==Places of interest==

One of the most notable landmarks in the area is the Baltimore Beacon, also known as Lot&#x27;s wife. Towards the end of July 1847, Commander James Wolfe, R.N., informed the Ballast Board that he had recently completed a survey of Baltimore Harbour and noticed the destruction of the beacon on the eastern point of the southern entrance to the harbour.

George Halpin, the Board&#x27;s inspector was ordered to report the matter which he did the following month, stating that the original, locally built beacon was too small, poorly built, and had been vandalised. He recommended a large and properly constructed beacon with which the Board concurred.

Almost a year passed, 6 July 1848, before the Board requested the secretary to seek permission from Lord Carbery for a piece of ground ten yards in diameter, on which to build the beacon. By the end of July, a reply had been received from Mr Arthur Perry-Aylmer informing the Board that Lady Carbery of Castle Freke near Rosscarbery had given her full permission to either rebuild or re-construct the existing beacon and granted free access as the beacon was a matter of such vast importance to fishermen and others.

By February 1849 inspector George Halpin reported that the masonry work of the beacon was complete but the iron staff and vane still had to be placed on top.

The conspicuous conical white-painted Baltimore Beacon, sometimes called the &#x27;pillar of salt&#x27; or &#x27;Lot&#x27;s wife&#x27; is approximately 50 feet (15.2m) high and 5 yards (4.6m) in diameter at the base. The vent, mentioned by Halpin in 1849 was obviously vulnerable and at a later date was replaced by a sphere.

==Tourism==
Baltimore attracts visitors and the resident population increases in the summer months due to the summer homes that have been built in the area. Baltimore is used by visitors interested in sailing, fishing and exploring the countryside. Baltimore is a base from which tourists explore Cape Clear, Sherkin and Lough Hyne. Lough Hyne, Ireland&#x27;s first marine nature reserve is approximately 5 km from the town. Baltimore also has become a venue for scuba diving, due largely to the number and variety of shipwrecks in the bay. These include a Second World War submarine (U-260), the bulk carrier Kowloon Bridge and the Alondra from 1916.

One local restaurant has two Michelin stars (Dede), as did Mews (2018–20).

==Sport==
The local GAA club is Ilen Rovers, which was formed in 1973 and consists of the surrounding parish and that of Lisheen and Kilcoe. They compete in the Cork County Senior Football Championship and appeared in the Senior final in 2007 losing to Nemo Rangers. The local soccer team Baltimore FC also known as the Crabs were established in 2006. They won division 2 in 2010 and are currently a division 1 side in the West Cork League. Sailing is also a popular activity in Baltimore. Courses are held in the summer months for both adults and children.

==Transport==
Ferries sail from Baltimore to Schull further along the coast, to Sherkin Island, and to the more remote Cape Clear Island.

Baltimore is located on the R595 road, leading to the N71 road for Cork, roughly 100 kilometres from the village. The closest town to Baltimore is Skibbereen, 13.4 kilometres northeast of the village. Bus services to Skibbereen and Cork are provided by Bus Éireann. The nearest airport is Cork Airport

Baltimore railway station on the West Cork Railway opened on 2 May 1893, but finally closed on 1 April 1961.

<text>A hydrographic office is an organization which is devoted to acquiring and publishing hydrographic information.

Historically, the main tasks of hydrographic offices were the conduction of hydrographic surveys and the publication of nautical charts. In many countries, various navigation-related services are now concentrated in large governmental organizations, sometimes termed &quot;maritime administration&quot; (however, the International Hydrographic Organization uses the term &quot;hydrographic offices&quot; for its member organizations).

Besides nautical charts, many hydrographic offices publish a body of books and periodicals that are collectively known as nautical publications. The most important of these are:
*Sailing Directions (or &quot;pilots&quot;): detailed descriptions of areas of the sea, shipping routes, harbours, aids to navigation, regulations etc.
*lists of lights: descriptions of lighthouses and lightbouys
*tide tables and tidal stream atlases
*ephemerides and nautical almanacs for celestial navigation
*Notice to Mariners: periodical (often weekly) updates and corrections for nautical charts and publications

Hydrographic organizations may also be involved in services such as:
*pilotage
*search and rescue
*maintenance of lighthouses and other aids to navigation
*ice breaking
*weather observation and information
*sea traffic information and surveillance
*maritime research
*regulatory affairs of ship safety

==History==
In the development of hydrographic services, shipping organizations played a part, but the major players were the naval powers. Recognizing hydrographic information was a military advantage these naval organizations, usually under the direction of a &quot;Hydrographer,&quot; utilized the expertise of naval officers in collecting hydrographic data that was incorporated into the navy&#x27;s collection. In order to distribute the processed information (charts, directions, notices, and such) these organizations often developed specialized printing capabilities.

==Hydrographic organisations of some countries==

===Australia===
Hydrographic tasks in Australian waters were performed by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy since the 19th century. In 1920 the Australian Hydrographic Service was formed as a part of the Royal Australian Navy.

===Brazil===
Hydrographic tasks in Brazilian waters were performed by the (DHN) since 02/02/1876.

===Canada===
Starting in 1883, the &quot;Georgian Bay Survey&quot; was responsible for hydrographic surveying of Georgian Bay and Lake Huron. Its geographic area of responsibility increased and in 1904 the name was changed to the &quot;Hydrographic Survey of Canada.&quot; The current name Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) was adopted in 1928.

In 1951, Canada became a State Member of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the Dominion Hydrographer is Canada&#x27;s representative.

Today, the mandate of CHS is found in the Canada Oceans Act, the Canada Shipping Act (Charts and Publications Regulations) and the Navigable Waters Protection Act.

With its headquarters office located in Ottawa, Ontario there are regional offices in Sidney (British Columbia), Burlington (Ontario), Mont-Joli (Quebec), Halifax (Nova Scotia), and a branch office in St. John&#x27;s Newfoundland. CHS has 300 staff across the country.

The national chart folio consists of 950 paper charts, 541 S-57 vector Electronic Navigation Charts and 651 raster charts in the BSB format. CHS produces and maintains seven volumes of Tides and Water Levels books, 25 Sailing Directions books, and prints and distributes a number of publications such as the Annual Notices to Mariners and Radio Aids to Marine Navigation.

In addition to significant hydrographic data holdings (single &amp; multibeam), CHS operates 78 permanent water level stations, a real time water level and forecast system in the St. Lawrence River, and participates in the operation of Atlantic &amp; Pacific tsunami warning systems.

CHS is directly responsible for the sales and distribution of all its products, in paper and digital form. A network of 850 dealers (domestic and international) distributes CHS paper and digital products. Products and data are also made available to Value Added Resellers, under licence.

===Chile===
Since 1874, the Navy&#x27;s Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (&quot;SHOA&quot;, as acronym of&quot;Servicio Hidrográfico y Oceanográfico de la Armada&quot;) has been the Chilean official authority on drawing and publishing nautical charts of the South Pacific Ocean for Military and Civil navigation.
This institution is also the main authority on controlling the official hour of the country.

===Denmark===
In Denmark (including Greenland and the Faroe Islands), hydrographic surveying and charting is conducted by &quot;Geodatastyrelsen&quot; also known as, Danish Geodata Agency, a division of the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities.

===France===

In France, the first official organization, the French Dépôt des Cartes, Plans, Journaux et Mémoires Relatifs à la Navigation, was formed in 1720.

Today, the SHOM is the official French hydrographic office, it stands for &#x27;Service Hydrographique et Océanographique de la Marine&#x27; and means Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service.

===Germany===
The &quot;Bundesamt für Seeschiffahrt und Hydrographie&quot; (BSH) is the German federal hydrographic office. Its offices are located in Hamburg and Rostock. The BSH is responsible for a wide variety of services, among them hydrographic surveys, nautical publications, ship registration, testing and approval of technical equipment, oceanographic research, development of nautical information systems, and maritime pollution surveillance. The BSH runs six ships for survey and research purposes.

In 1945 the tasks of various predecessor organisations (among them the German Navy&#x27;s hydrographic service, the Wilhelmshaven maritime observatory, and the &quot;Deutsche Seewarte&quot; under Georg von Neumayer) were concentrated in the newly created &quot;Deutsches Hydrographisches Institut&quot; (DHI) in Hamburg. In 1990 the DHI and the corresponding East German organisation, the &quot;Seehydrographische Dienst der DDR&quot; in Rostock were integrated to form the BSH in its present form.

===Greece===
The Hellenic Navy Hydrographic Service (HNHS, ), an independent service of the Hellenic Navy General Staff, is responsible for hydrographic surveying and production and sale of charts. The first naval hydrographic office was created in 1905 and its first mission was the hydrographic survey of Maliakos Gulf. Its first nautical chart was issued in 1909 and in 1919 the Hellenic Navy became a founding member of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). The hydrographic office evolved into the independent naval Hydrographic Service in 1921. Today the HNHS operates three naval hydrographic vessels: &quot;HS OS Nautilos&quot; (A-478), &quot;HS OS Pytheas&quot; (A-474) and &quot;HS Stravon&quot; (A-476).

===Hong Kong ===
The Hong Kong Hydrographic Office is responsible for hydrographic surveying and production of nautical charts covering the waters of Hong Kong. It also produced electronic navigational charts and made available the prediction of tidal stream digitally on the internet.

===Iceland===
The Hydrographic department of the Icelandic Coast Guard is responsible for hydrographic surveying and production of nautical charts of Icelandic waters.

===India===

The Indian Naval Hydro-graphic Department (INHD) headed by Chief Hydrographer to the Government of India is an Indian Government agency responsible for hydro-graphic surveys and nautical charting in India.

===New Zealand===
Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) is responsible for hydrographic surveying, production of nautical charts, and provision of tidal information covering the waters of New Zealand through the New Zealand Hydrographic Authority (NZHA). Nautical charts can no longer be purchased directly from LINZ but must be purchased from Bluestar Group or from an authorised agent.

===Norway===
The Norwegian Hydrographic Service is responsible for hydrographic surveying and production of nautical charts covering the waters of Norway. Also operates the Primar ENC Service.

===Ireland===
Ireland is actively undertaking the largest civilian seabed mapping programme in the world, as a joint venture by the Marine Institute and the Geological Survey of Ireland. Total mapping coverage of the INSS to end of 2005 was 432,000 km2 and taken along with an earlier DCENR Petroleum Affairs Division, over 81% of the Irish designated seabed area (at end 2005) has been mapped. The INtegrated Mapping FOr the Sustainable Development of Ireland&#x27;s MArine Resource (INFOMAR) programme is a successor to the Irish National Seabed Survey (INSS) and concentrates on creating a range of integrated mapping products of the physical, chemical and biological features of the seabed in the near-shore area. The programme is being funded by the Irish Government through the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as part of the National Development Plan, 2007 – 2013 [11]. Data are passed on to the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) for subsequent production of nautical charts.

===Sweden===
&quot;Sjöfartsverket&quot;, Swedish Maritime Administration, includes the Swedish national hydrographic organisation. Established in 1956 and governed by the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communications, Sjöfartsverket is responsible for most aspects of safe navigation in Sweden. This includes maintenance and marking of fairways, surveying and charting Swedish waters, pilotage, search-and-rescue (in cooperation with other organisations), ice-breaking, and safety inspections.

===United Kingdom===
The office of Hydrographer was created in 1795. Royal Navy charts and the related surveys were reputedly officially started as a result of the loss of Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell on an uncharted reef off the Scilly Isles which happened in October 1707 (see main article Scilly naval disaster of 1707).

The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) is now a part of the Ministry of Defence rather than a naval department and is located in Taunton, Somerset, near Creechbarrow hill. It is best known for producing the well-known Admiralty chart series of nautical charts that covers almost every navigable stretch of water on Earth. The UKHO also calculates tide tables for the UK.

In contrast to the US government, all of whose creative work is placed into the public domain, British government policy requires agencies such as the UKHO and the Ordnance Survey to be self-funding through the sale of the information they create. The Hydrographic Office therefore actively protects the copyright of all of its data including paper charts, electronic charts, tidal data and other data and has been known to take measures to ensure that its copyrighted information is used appropriately.

In 2013 the UKHO added an important new service for users of its paper charts by allowing its authorized agents to Print on Demand most paper charts.

UKHO attracted worldwide attention in February 2005 when it published in-depth pictures of the ocean floor in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster of December 26, 2004.

===United States===
In the United States, the Survey of the Coast (America&#x27;s first scientific agency) was established through an 1807 Congressional resolution and signed into law by President Jefferson. It subsequently became the United States Coast Survey in 1836 and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878, and in May 1917 incorporated a new uniformed service of the United States, the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps so that surveyors had a status as commissioned officers could not be shot as spies if captured during time of war. The U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey was abolished and its responsibilities, personnel, facilities, and fleet incorporated into the new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) when NOAA was established in 1970. As the successor to the Coast and Geodetic Survey, NOAA&#x27;s Office of Coast Survey is the national hydrographic office of the United States.

Non-domestic hydrographic and bathymetric surveys are conducted by the United States Navy′s Naval Oceanographic Office, which started with the establishment of the Depot of Charts and Instruments in 1830, which by 1854 was designated the United States Naval Observatory and Hydrographical Office. The hydrographic portion became the United States Hydrographic Office under the Hydrographer of the Navy, appointed from among uniformed U.S. Navy personnel from 1870 through 1961. With the popularization of oceanography in the early 1960s (partly due to President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s interest), the name was changed to the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office in 1962. That office, as a matter of historical and semantic interest, and the United States Naval Observatory are still part of the command overseen by the Oceanographer of the Navy, who replaced the Hydrographer of the Navy, with headquarters at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. In 2001, the position of Hydographer of the Navy was re-established.

===Uruguay===
Hydrographic tasks in Uruguayan waters have been performed by the SOHMA since 1916.

<text>The 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup was the fourth edition of the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the quadrennial championship of women&#x27;s national soccer teams organized by FIFA. It was held in the United States from September 20 to October 12, 2003, at six venues in six cities across the country. The tournament was won by Germany, who became the first country to win both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s World Cup.

China was originally awarded the right to host the tournament, which would have taken place from September 23 to October 11 in four cities. A severe outbreak of SARS in early 2003 affected Guangdong in southern China and prompted FIFA to move the Women&#x27;s World Cup to the United States, who had hosted the previous edition in 1999. China was instead granted hosting rights for the 2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup and financial compensation while the United States Soccer Federation made new arrangements to host at smaller stadiums.

==Preparations==
===Host selection and change===

FIFA awarded hosting rights for the Women&#x27;s World Cup to China on October 26, 2000, beating a bid by Australia. The tournament was originally planned to run from September 23 to October 11 at venues in Shanghai, Wuhan, Chengdu and Hangzhou. Several sporting events in China were canceled or postponed in early April due to the outbreak of SARS in Southern China, including the official draw for the Women&#x27;s World Cup; FIFA launched a joint investigation with the World Health Organization into whether the outbreak would subside by the time of the tournament. The United States, Canada and Australia were mentioned as potential replacement hosts at the time.

On May 3, 2003, FIFA announced that they would move the tournament to an alternate host country, which would be determined at a later date; the United States and Australia had expressed interest in hosting, while Brazil was floated as another potential host. FIFA also announced that they would instead award the 2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup and pay $1 million to the organizing committee to compensate for planning expenses. On May 26, 2003, the United States was announced as the tournament&#x27;s new host, ahead of the other formal bid submitted by Sweden. The United States was judged to be a suitable emergency host because of their experience with organizing the 1999 tournament, despite potential conflicts in the fall sports schedule with American football and baseball. Women&#x27;s soccer boosters in the United States also hoped that interest generated by the tournament would save the struggling professional league, the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association, from folding; the league ultimately folded a few days before the tournament began in September.

==Venues==

The tournament&#x27;s 32 matches were played at six venues and organized into 15 doubleheaders, with the exception of the third-place and final matches, which were played on separate days. The Los Angeles area repeated as host of the final, which was moved from the Rose Bowl to the Home Depot Center, a smaller stadium in Carson, California. The matches were scheduled in doubleheaders and moved from four venues on the East Coast to two on the West Coast as it progressed to later matchdays. The size and scope of the tournament were also reduced from the 1999 edition due to the limited time to organize and prepare for the event.

Mostly due to the rescheduling of the tournament on short notice, FIFA and the United States Soccer Federation were forced to creatively schedule matches. Nine doubleheaders were scheduled in group play (similar to the 1999 format). They also had to abandon the modern practice of scheduling the final matches of the group stage to kick off simultaneously. In Groups A and D, the final matches were scheduled as the two ends of a doubleheader. The final matches in Groups B and C were also scheduled as doubleheaders, but split between two cities, with a Group B match in each city followed by a Group C match. The four quarter-finals were also scheduled as two doubleheaders, and both semi-finals were also a doubleheader.

The host stadiums were announced on June 13, 2003, including three large stadiums to open the tournament and three small, soccer-specific stadiums for later stages. Giants Stadium in the New York City area backed out of hosting after being unable to resolve scheduling issues with the New York Giants. For the tournament, Portland&#x27;s newly renovated PGE Park (formerly Civic Stadium) received a new grass surface and temporary bleachers to expand capacity to 28,359; it was the only venue to host matches during the 1999 and 2003 tournaments. Gillette Stadium replaced the demolished Foxboro Stadium, while RFK Stadium was chosen in place of Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in the Washington, D.C. area. The venues also employed new security measures that were required by the U.S. government following the September 11 attacks in 2001.

==Participating teams and officials==

===Qualification===

Sixteen teams participated in the 2003 Women&#x27;s World Cup, determined by a set of continental qualification tournaments that took place from August 18, 2001, to July 12, 2003. Three teams, Argentina, France, and South Korea, made their Women&#x27;s World Cup debuts in the 2003 tournament. The remaining thirteen teams had competed in the previous World Cup.

China was granted automatic qualification as the host and retained it after the United States were named the replacement host. The remaining fifteen participants, including the replacement host, were determined through a series of continental tournaments from a field of 99 teams. FIFA allocated five berths to Europe; two each to Africa, Asia, North America, and South America (increased by one from the 1999 tournament); and one to Oceania. The 2003 Women&#x27;s World Cup was also used to determine the two European participants in the 2004 Summer Olympics.

===Draw===

The group draw was originally scheduled to take place on May 24, 2003, in Wuhan, China, but was postponed prior to the relocation decision. It instead took place at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California on July 17, 2003, and included a formal handover ceremony for the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup trophy, which was given to U.S. coach April Heinrichs by Chinese coach Ma Liangxing. FIFA also unveiled its Women&#x27;s World Rankings system, which was used to determine seeded groups and retroactively calculated points for over 3,000 international fixtures dating back to 1971.

The United States was placed in Group A and China was placed in Group D, while Norway and Germany were also seeded in Pot 1. The remaining three pots were distributed geographically to prevent two teams from the same confederation from being drawn into the same group, with the exception of one group that would have two European teams. The hosting United States was drawn into the tournament&#x27;s &quot;Group of death&quot; alongside Sweden, Nigeria, and North Korea—all considered strong teams from their respective confederations.

==Group stage==

The tournament format was unchanged from the 1999 edition, with the first round consisting of sixteen teams organized into four groups by the final draw. The round-robin group stage consisted of 24 matches in which each team played one match against the other three teams in their group. The winners and runners-up from each group qualified for the knockout stage, which began with the quarter-finals.

===Group A===

Group A included three teams from the previous edition&#x27;s Group A—hosts and defending champions United States, African champions Nigeria, and Asian champions North Korea—alongside European runners-up Sweden. It was dubbed the tournament&#x27;s &quot;Group of death&quot; at the time of the final draw, due to the presence of three continental champions and a runner-up. Nigeria were defeated 3–0 by North Korea in the opening match of the tournament, played in Philadelphia on September 20, with two goals by Jin Pyol-hui and one by Ri Un-gyong during a dominating performance for most of the match. The United States began its title defense by winning 3–1 in its match against Sweden in Washington, D.C. at RFK Memorial Stadium, which was attended by 34,144 spectators. Kristine Lilly volleyed a shot from in the 28th minute and was followed by a Cindy Parlow header for a 2–0 halftime lead. A header by Victoria Svensson in the 58th minute cut the lead, but the two-goal margin was restored in the 78th minute by Shannon Boxx&#x27;s header on a corner kick.

Sweden won 1–0 in its second match, played against North Korea in Philadelphia, with a seventh-minute volley by Svensson. The Swedish defense limited North Korea to a single shot in the first half, but goalkeeper Ri Jong-hui prevented a rout with several saves. The United States moved further ahead in group standings with a 5–0 defeat of Nigeria, but were unable to clinch an early quarterfinal berth. Mia Hamm, the longtime face of the team, scored from a penalty kick in the sixth minute and a free kick in the twelfth minute. Her strike partner, Cindy Parlow, scored a goal of her own just after halftime by heading in a corner kick taken by Hamm. Substitute forward Abby Wambach scored her first Women&#x27;s World Cup goal and the match&#x27;s final goal came from a penalty kick taken in the 89th minute by Julie Foudy.

The third matchday, played as a doubleheader in Columbus, began with Sweden&#x27;s 3–0 win over Nigeria to earn a quarterfinal berth by finishing second in the group. After a scoreless first half, striker Hanna Ljungberg broke the deadlock in the 56th minute with a header and added a second in the 79th minute; Swedish captain Malin Moström then scored a third goal for her team two minutes later on a breakaway, capping a dominating offensive performance with 14 shots on target. The United States benched several of its starting players in their final group stage match against North Korea, which was the first World Cup match without star striker Mia Hamm. The hosts took the lead in the 17th minute from a penalty kick that was awarded for a foul on Tiffeny Milbrett and scored by Abby Wambach. Cat Reddick, the only college player on the U.S. roster, scored from a deflection in the 48th minute and a header in the 66th minute as the United States won 3–0 and finished at the top of Group A.



===Group B===

In Group B, 1999 semifinalists Brazil and Norway were joined by Women&#x27;s World Cup debutantes France and South Korea. Norway and France had played in the same continental qualification group, finishing first and second in their group; France qualified for the final European berth by winning a two-stage play-off series against Denmark and England. Norway won 2–0 in their opening match against France, with second-half goals from a header by Anita Rapp and rebound by captain Dagny Mellgren. Brazil defeated South Korea 3–0 in their opener, with a penalty scored by 17-year-old midfielder Marta in the 14th minute and two second-half goals from forward Kátia.

Brazil moved to the top of Group B with a 4–1 defeat of Norway, who were unexpectedly overpowered by the younger members of the Brazil squad. 19-year-old Daniela scored in the 26th minute after a long run through the Norwegian defense and was followed by 21-year-old defender Rosana&#x27;s header off a free kick in the 37th minute. Norwegian forward Marianne Pettersen scored with a header before halftime to bring the team within one goal of equalizing, but a tap-in from Marta and header by Kátia in the second half earned Brazil their upset victory. The second doubleheader of the matchday ended with South Korea&#x27;s 1–0 loss to France, with the team&#x27;s first World Cup goal scored in the 84th minute by Marinette Pichon; as a result, France and Norway were left tied in second place with the possibility of a three-way tie at the end of the group stage.

Norway rebounded from its loss to Brazil by defeating South Korea 7–1 to qualify for the quarterfinals as the second-placed team in the group. Dagny Mellgren scored twice in the first half and also recorded two assists on goals by Solveig Gulbrandsen in the fifth minute and Marianne Pettersen before halftime. Defender Brit Sandaune scored from a volley early in the second half and was joined on the score-sheet by Linda Ørmen, who entered the match as a substitute in the 69th minute and scored twice at the end of the match. Kim Jin-hee earned a consolation goal, her nation&#x27;s first in a World Cup, from a defensive mistake in the 75th minute. Brazil took the lead against France in its final group stage match in the 58th minute, through a goal from Kátia, but conceded in stoppage time to a finish by Pichon. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, but Brazil finished atop the group standings and advanced to the quarterfinals.



===Group C===

Group C included 1995 runners-up Germany, North American runners-up Canada; Japan, who qualified through an inter-continental play-off; and debutants Argentina. In the opening match of the first group doubleheader in Columbus, Christine Sinclair scored her first Women&#x27;s World Cup goal in the fourth minute from a header to give Canada the lead. Germany then equalized from a penalty kick before halftime, awarded for a handball, and completed a 4–1 comeback victory with three goals in the second half by Birgit Prinz and substitute Kerstin Garefrekes. The second match in Columbus ended with Argentina being defeated 6–0 by Japan, with two goals from Homare Sawa and a hat-trick scored by Mio Otani in an eight-minute span in the second half. Argentina lost forward Natalia Gatti to a red card in the 39th minute, opening the team to attacks form the Japanese.

The second matchday&#x27;s doubleheader, also played in Columbus, ended with 3–0 victories for Germany over Japan and Canada over Argentina. Germany took advantage of their taller players and physicality to shutout Japan, liming them to a handful of chances. Sandra Minnert scored on a rebound from a corner kick in the 23rd minute and was followed by a pair of goals from forward Birgit Prinz in the 36th and 66th minute, both from overturned balls in the midfield. Canada earned its first World Cup victory in its eighth match with a pair of goals scored by Christine Latham, who also won a penalty in the 19th minute that opened the scoring against Argentina. The victory put Canada level on points with Japan for second place in the group, setting up a winner-take-all scenario in their match against each other.

Canada earned its first quarterfinal berth by defeating Japan 3–1 in their final group stage match, despite conceding to Japan&#x27;s star midfielder Homare Sawa in the 20th minute. Latham equalized with her chipped shot in the 36th minute and Canada took the lead after halftime with a header by Christine Sinclair and a strike by Kara Lang in the 72nd minute. Germany finished atop the group with three wins following their 6–1 rout of Argentina, including four goals scored in the first half. The team lost defender Steffi Jones to a knee injury in the second half and conceded a consolation goal to Argentina before scoring twice at the end of the match to extend their lead.



===Group D===

Original hosts and 1999 runners-up China were seeded into Group D, where they would play alongside African runners-up Ghana, Oceania champions Australia, and 1999 quarter-finalist Russia. Australia continued their Women&#x27;s World Cup winless streak by losing 2–1 to Russia in the opening match, despite taking a 1–0 lead in the 38th minute through a goal from Kelly Golebiowski. Russia tied the match a minute later with an own goal from Dianne Alagich and Elena Fomina scored their second in the 89th minute with a strike from the edge of the penalty area. China, considered the favorites to top the group, won 1–0 in their opener against Ghana with a goal by Sun Wen, who was the top goalscorer in the 1999 World Cup.

Russia secured its quarterfinal berth by defeating Ghana 3–0 in their second match, which took them to first place in the group. They opened the scoring in the 36th minute with a free kick taken by Marina Saenko, which was followed by a pair of close-range shots in the second half from Natalia Barbashina and Olga Letyushova. Group favorites China had unexpectedly conceded to Australia in the first half of their match, with a goal in the 28th minute for midfielder Heather Garriock, that would have snapped a winless World Cup record for the Matildas. A potential equalizer in the first half from Sun Wen was saved off the line by Cheryl Salisbury, but Bai Jie was able to score shortly after halftime to earn a draw for China and prevent an upset victory for Australia.

Australia continued its winless streak in World Cup play after losing 2–1 in its final group stage match against Ghana, who had also been eliminated from advancing to the quarterfinals. Ghanaian striker Alberta Sackey, who had been named Africa&#x27;s best female player, scored twice within five minutes near the end of the first half—once from long range and the other from a rebound on a saved shot. Heather Garriock cut the lead in the 61st minute with her goal and Australia pressed for an equalizer, but were unable to score and finished at the bottom of the group. China qualified for the quarterfinals through Australia&#x27;s elimination and won 1–0 against Russia to finish atop the group standings. Bai Jie scored the lone goal of the match in the 16th minute, despite China&#x27;s 18 shots—of which seven were saved by Russian goalkeeper Alla Volkova.



==Knockout stage==
===Bracket===
===Quarter-finals===

The first quarterfinal doubleheader was played at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, with the ordering of the matches swapped to allow a later kickoff for the U.S. match. Sweden took the lead against Brazil in the first match of the night, with a header by Victoria Svensson in the 23rd minute in the run of play. A minute before halftime, Marta drew and scored an equalizing penalty for Brazil after being tripped by goalkeeper Sofia Lundgren, who was starting in place of Caroline Jönsson because of her drug treatment for stomach cramps. Malin Andersson scored the winning goal for Sweden in the 53rd minute from a free kick as Sweden resisted several chances from Brazil and a controversial uncalled foul in the penalty area during stoppage time to win 2–1. The United States played Norway in their quarterfinal match-up, which pitted two of the tournament favorites and ended in a 1–0 victory for the hosts. Abby Wambach scored in the 24th minute from a header off Cat Reddick&#x27;s free kick from while also creating other chances to score to no avail. The U.S. failed to extend their lead in the 68th minute, with a penalty kick taken by Mia Hamm that was blocked by goalkeeper Bente Nordby.

The second doubleheader was played between teams from Groups C and D at PGE Park in Portland, Oregon, which would also host the semifinals. Germany advanced to the semifinals with a 7–1 defeat of Russia, who matched Chinese Taipei in conceding the most goals in a Women&#x27;s World Cup quarterfinal. The Germans led 1–0 at halftime, with a goal by Martina Müller in the 25th minute, but scored three times within a five-minute span to open the second half after breaking down the Russian defense. After conceding a consolation goal to Elena Danilova in the 70th minute, Germany scored three times in the final ten minutes, including a pair from Brigit Prinz and a second for Kerstin Garefrekes, to close out the match. Canada then achieved an upset defeat of China in their quarterfinal match, taking an early lead in the seventh minute through a header from Charmaine Hooper and maintaining a shutout to win 1–0 despite several scoring chances for the Chinese.
----



===Semi-finals===

Germany advanced to their second Women&#x27;s World Cup final by defeating the United States 3–0 in a major upset of the defending champions in Portland, only their second loss in a Women&#x27;s World Cup. Germany took the lead in the 15th minute through a header by Kerstin Garefrekes and held onto the shutout, despite the U.S. switching formations to produce attacking chances that often required saves from goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg. The German defense remained resilient to the long-ball play of the United States, which increased in intensity and frequency during the second half—producing six shots on target. Maren Meinert and Brigit Prinz scored a pair of goals in stoppage time, taking advantage of the vulnerable American defense with their counterattacks.

The second semifinal fixture, between Canada and Sweden, remained scoreless through the end of the first hour of play despite chances created by Canadian fullback–forward Charmaine Hooper. Canada were awarded a free kick from in the 64th minute, which was shot towards goal by Kara Lang and spun off the hands of Jönsson as she attempted to make the save. Sweden made three substitutions to bring on attacking players and won a free kick in the 79th minute that was quickly taken by Victoria Svensson and passed to Malin Moström, who scored the equalizer. Substitute forward Josefine Öqvist scored the winning goal for Sweden six minutes later, finishing a rebound off a shot by Hanna Ljungberg that was saved by goalkeeper Taryn Swiatek.
----
===Third place play-off===

The third-place play-off was played on the day before the final at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California, between the United States and their continental rivals Canada. The U.S. retained its mix of veteran and youth players who played in the semifinals and controlled play for most of the match, taking the lead in the 22nd minute through a long throw-in by Abby Wambach that was volleyed into the goal by Kristine Lilly. Christine Sinclair equalized for Canada within 16 minutes, but the U.S. kept pressing in the second half and re-took the lead in the 51st minute through a header by Shannon Boxx from a corner kick. Tiffeny Milbrett, who was substituted in for Cindy Parlow after she sustained a concussion before halftime, then scored the team&#x27;s final goal of the tournament in the 80th minute by finishing a rebound off an earlier shot that was blocked at the goal line.

===Final===
Germany defeated Sweden in the Women&#x27;s World Cup final to earn their first world championship and become the first country to win both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournament, as well as the first to win with a female manager. In a rematch of the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2001 final, Sweden took the lead before halftime on a shot by Hanna Ljungberg from . Germany responded with an equalizing goal in the first minute of the second half, with Maren Meinert scoring in the penalty area on a rebound off goalkeeper Caroline Jönsson. The match remained tied after regulation time and was decided by a golden goal scored in the 98th minute by substitute defender Nia Künzer, who headed in a shot from a free kick taken by Renate Lingor.

==Awards==
German striker Birgit Prinz was awarded the Golden Ball for her play in the tournament and the Golden Shoe, having scored seven goals. She was later named the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Player of the Year for 2003, 2004, and 2005. Germany&#x27;s Kerstin Garefrekes also finished the tournament with four goals and no assists, Kátia won the Bronze Shoe by having played fewer minutes (only 360, compared to the 409 minutes of Garefrekes).

FIFA.com shortlisted six teams, the four semi-finalist teams and two other sides chosen by FIFA (Brazil and China), for users to vote on as the tournaments&#x27; most entertaining, with the poll closing on October 10, 2003.

===All-Star Team===
The tournament&#x27;s sixteen-member all-star team, including eleven starters and five substitutes, was selected by the FIFA Technical Study Group and announced on October 8, 2003, by President Joseph Blatter. Germany had five members named to the starting lineup, while runners-up Sweden had two starters and one substitute. Several members of the All-Star Team were later named to the FIFA Women&#x27;s All Star Team that played against Germany on May 20, 2004, for the centennial anniversary of FIFA.

The &quot;FANtasy All-Star Team&quot;, which was sponsored by MasterCard, featured eleven players decided by a poll on FIFA.com.

<text>The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root vegetable closely related to carrot and parsley, all belonging to the flowering plant family Apiaceae. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long taproot has cream-colored skin and flesh, and, left in the ground to mature, becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces a flowering stem topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers in its second growing season, later producing pale brown, flat, winged seeds. By this time, the stem has become woody, and the taproot inedible. Precautions should be taken when handling the stems and foliage, as parsnip sap can cause a skin rash or even blindness if exposed to sunlight after handling.

The parsnip is native to Eurasia; it has been used as a vegetable since antiquity and was cultivated by the Romans, although some confusion exists between parsnips and carrots in the literature of the time. It was used as a sweetener before the arrival of cane sugar in Europe.

Parsnips are usually cooked but can also be eaten raw. The flesh has a sweet flavor, even more so than carrots. It is high in vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals (especially potassium); and also contains both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. Parsnips are best cultivated in deep, stone-free soil. The plant is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, as well as viruses and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious.

==Description==
The parsnip is a biennial plant with a rosette of roughly hairy leaves that have a pungent odor when crushed. Parsnips are grown for their fleshy, edible, cream-colored taproots. The roots are generally smooth, although lateral roots sometimes form. Most are narrowly conical, but some cultivars have a more bulbous shape, which generally tends to be favored by food processors as it is more resistant to breakage. The plant&#x27;s apical meristem produces a rosette of pinnate leaves, each with several pairs of leaflets with toothed margins. The lower leaves have short stems, the upper ones are stemless, and the terminal leaves have three lobes. The leaves are once- or twice-pinnate with broad, ovate, sometimes lobed leaflets with toothed margins; they grow up to long.
The petioles are grooved and have sheathed bases. The floral stem develops in the second year and can grow to more than tall. It is hairy, grooved, hollow (except at the nodes), and sparsely branched. It has a few stalkless, single-lobed leaves measuring long that are arranged in opposite pairs.
The yellow flowers are in a loose, compound umbel measuring in diameter. Six to 25 straight pedicels are present, each measuring that support the umbellets (secondary umbels). The umbels and umbellets usually have no upper or lower bracts. The flowers have tiny sepals or lack them entirely, and measure about . They consist of five yellow petals that are curled inward, five stamens, and one pistil. The fruits, or schizocarps, are oval and flat, with narrow wings and short, spreading styles. They are colored straw to light brown, and measure long.

Despite the slight morphological differences between the two, wild parsnip is the same taxon as the cultivated version, and the two readily cross-pollinate. The parsnip has a chromosome number of 2&quot;n&quot;=22.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Pastinaca sativa&quot; was first officially described by Carolus Linnaeus in his 1753 work &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. It has acquired several synonyms in its taxonomic history:
*&quot;Pastinaca fleischmannii&quot; Hladnik, ex D.Dietr.
*&quot;Pastinaca opaca&quot; Bernh. ex Hornem.
*&quot;Pastinaca pratensis&quot; (Pers.) H.Mart.

Several species from other genera (&quot;Anethum&quot;, &quot;Elaphoboscum&quot;, &quot;Peucedanum&quot;, &quot;Selinum&quot;) are likewise synonymous with the name &quot;Pastinaca sativa&quot;.

Like most plants of agricultural importance, several subspecies and varieties of &quot;P. sativa&quot; have been described, but these are mostly no longer recognized as independent taxa, but rather, morphological variations of the same taxon.

In Eurasia, some authorities distinguish between cultivated and wild versions of parsnips by using subspecies &quot;P. s.&quot; &quot;sylvestris&quot; for the latter, or even elevating it to species status as &quot;Pastinaca sylvestris&quot;. In Europe, various subspecies have been named based on characteristics such as the hairiness of the leaves, the extent to which the stems are angled or rounded, and the size and shape of the terminal umbel.

=== Etymology ===
The etymology of the generic name &quot;Pastinaca&quot; is not known with certainty but is probably derived from either the Latin word , meaning &#x27;to prepare the ground for planting of the vine&#x27; or , meaning &#x27;food&#x27;. The specific epithet &quot;sativa&quot; means &#x27;sown&#x27;.

While folk etymology sometimes assumes the name is a mix of parsley and turnip, it actually comes from Middle English , alteration (influenced by , &#x27;turnip&#x27;) of Old French (now &quot;panais&quot;) from Latin &quot;,&quot; a kind of fork. The word&#x27;s ending was changed to &quot;-nip&quot; by analogy with turnip because it was mistakenly assumed to be a kind of turnip.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Like carrots, parsnips are native to Eurasia.

== Invasivity ==

The parsnip&#x27;s popularity as a cultivated plant has led to its spread beyond its native range, and wild populations have become established in other parts of the world. A scattered population can be found throughout North America.

The plant can form dense stands which outcompete native species and is especially common in abandoned yards, farmland, and along roadsides and other disturbed environments. The increasing abundance of this plant is a concern, particularly due to the plant&#x27;s toxicity and increasing abundance in populated areas such as parks. Control is often carried out via chemical means, with glyphosate-containing herbicides considered effective.

==Cultivation==
===History===
Zohary and Hopf note that the archaeological evidence for the ancient cultivation of the parsnip is &quot;still rather limited&quot; and that Greek and Roman literary sources are a major source about its early use. They warn that &quot;there are some difficulties in distinguishing between parsnip and carrot (which, in Roman times, were white or purple) in classical writings since both vegetables seem to have been called &quot;pastinaca&quot; in Latin, yet each vegetable appears to be well under cultivation in Roman times&quot;.

This plant was introduced to North America simultaneously by the French colonists in Canada and the British in the Thirteen Colonies for use as a root vegetable, but in the mid-19th century, it was replaced as the main source of starch by the potato and consequently was less widely cultivated.

In 1859, a new cultivar called &#x27;Student&#x27; was developed by James Buckman at the Royal Agricultural College in England. He back-crossed cultivated plants to wild stock, aiming to demonstrate how native plants could be improved by selective breeding. This experiment was so successful &#x27;Student&#x27; became the major variety in cultivation in the late 19th century.

===Propagation===
The wild parsnip from which the modern cultivated varieties were derived is a plant of dry, rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, as soon as the ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.
===Problems===
Parsnip leaves are sometimes tunnelled by the larvae of the celery fly (&quot;Euleia heraclei&quot;). Irregular, pale brown passages can be seen between the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves. The effects are most serious on young plants, as whole leaves may shrivel and die. Treatment is by removing affected leaflets, whole leaves, or by chemical means.

The crop can be attacked by larvae of the carrot fly (&quot;Chamaepsila rosae&quot;). This pest feeds on the outer layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled. The damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. The smell of bruised tissue attracts the fly.

Parsnip is used as a food plant by the larvae of some lepidopteran species, including the parsnip swallowtail (&quot;Papilio polyxenes&quot;), the common swift moth (&quot;Korscheltellus lupulina&quot;), the garden dart moth (&quot;Euxoa nigricans&quot;), and the ghost moth (&quot;Hepialus humuli&quot;). The larvae of the parsnip moth (&quot;Depressaria radiella&quot;), native to Europe and accidentally introduced to North America in the mid-1800s, construct their webs on the umbels, feeding on flowers and partially developed seeds.

Parsnip canker is a serious disease of this crop. Black or orange-brown patches occur around the root&#x27;s crown and shoulders, accompanied by cracking and hardening of the flesh. It is more likely to occur when the seed is sown into cold, wet soil, the pH of the soil is too low, or the roots have already been damaged by carrot fly larvae. Several fungi are associated with canker, including &quot;Phoma complanata&quot;, &quot;Ilyonectria radicicola&quot;, &quot;Itersonilia pastinaceae&quot;, and &quot;I. perplexans&quot;. In Europe, &quot;Mycocentrospora acerina&quot; has been found to cause a black rot that kills the plant early. Watery soft rot, caused by &quot;Sclerotinia minor&quot; and &quot;S. sclerotiorum&quot;, causes the taproot to become soft and watery. A white or buff-coloured mould grows on the surface. The pathogen is most common in temperate and subtropical regions with a cool, wet season.

Violet root rot caused by the fungus &quot;Helicobasidium purpureum&quot; sometimes affects the roots, covering them with a purplish mat to which soil particles adhere. The leaves become distorted and discoloured, and the mycelium can spread through the soil between plants. Some weeds can harbour this fungus, and it is more prevalent in wet, acid conditions. &quot;Erysiphe heraclei&quot; causes a powdery mildew that can cause significant crop loss. Infestation by this causes results in the yellowing of the leaf and loss of foliage. Moderate temperatures and high humidity favor the development of the disease.

Several viruses are known to infect the plant, including seed-borne strawberry latent ringspot virus, parsnip yellow fleck virus, parsnip leaf curl virus, parsnip mosaic potyvirus, and potyvirus celery mosaic virus. The latter causes clearing or yellowing of the areas of the leaf immediately beside the veins, the appearance of ochre mosaic spots, and the crinkling of the leaves in infected plants.

==Toxicity==
The shoots and leaves of parsnip must be handled with care, as its sap contains furanocoumarins, phototoxic chemicals that cause blisters on the skin when it is exposed to sunlight, a condition known as phytophotodermatitis. It shares this property with many of its relatives in the carrot family. Symptoms include redness, burning, and blisters; afflicted areas can remain sensitive and discolored for up to two years. Reports of gardeners experiencing toxic symptoms after coming into contact with foliage have been made, but these have been small compared to the number of people who grow the crop. The problem is most likely to occur on a sunny day when gathering foliage or pulling up old plants that have gone to seed. The symptoms have mostly been mild to moderate. Risk can be reduced by wearing long pants and sleeves to avoid exposure, and avoiding sunlight after any suspected exposure.

If eyes are exposed to the sap it can cause blindness.

The toxic properties of parsnip extracts are resistant to heating and periods of storage lasting several months. Toxic symptoms can also affect livestock and poultry in parts of their bodies where their skin is exposed. Polyynes can be found in Apiaceae vegetables such as parsnip, and they show cytotoxic activities.

== Uses ==

Parsnips resemble carrots and can be used in similar ways, but they have a sweeter taste, especially when cooked. They can be baked, boiled, pureed, roasted, fried, grilled, or steamed. When used in stews, soups, and casseroles, they give a rich flavour. In some cases, parsnips are boiled, and the solid portions are removed from the soup or stew, leaving behind a more subtle flavour than the whole root and starch to thicken the dish. Roast parsnip is considered an essential part of Christmas dinner in some parts of the English-speaking world and frequently features in the traditional Sunday roast. Parsnips can also be fried or thinly sliced and made into crisps. They can be made into a wine with a taste similar to Madeira.

The author Dorothy Hartley described parsnips as having &quot;the type of sweetness that mingles with honey and spice...&quot; The food writer Alan Davidson remarks, &quot;parsnip has a taste which, although not strong, is peculiar and not to everyone&#x27;s liking.&quot;

In Roman times, parsnips were believed to be an aphrodisiac. However, parsnips do not typically feature in modern Italian cooking. Instead, they are fed to pigs, particularly those bred to make Parma ham.

=== Nutrition ===
A typical 100 g serving of parsnip provides of food energy. Most parsnip cultivars consist of about 80% water, 5% sugar, 1% protein, 0.3% fat, and 5% dietary fiber. The parsnip is rich in vitamins and minerals and is particularly rich in potassium with 375 mg per 100 g. Several of the B-group vitamins are present, but levels of vitamin C are reduced in cooking. Since most of the vitamins and minerals are found close to the skin, many will be lost unless the root is finely peeled or cooked whole. During frosty weather, part of the starch is converted to sugar, and the root tastes sweeter.

The consumption of parsnips has potential health benefits. They contain antioxidants such as falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and methyl-falcarindiol, which may potentially have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The dietary fiber in parsnips is partly of the soluble and partly the insoluble type and comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The high fiber content of parsnips may help prevent constipation and reduce blood cholesterol levels.

== In culture ==
The parsnip was much esteemed in Rome, and Emperor Tiberius accepted part of the tribute payable to Rome by Germania in the form of parsnips. In Europe, the vegetable was used as a source of sugar before cane and beet sugars were available. As &quot;pastinache comuni&quot;, the &quot;common&quot; &quot;pastinaca&quot; figures in the long list of comestibles enjoyed by the Milanese given by Bonvesin da la Riva in his &quot;Marvels of Milan&quot; (1288).

<text>William Steig (; November 14, 1907 – October 3, 2003) was an American cartoonist, illustrator and writer of children&#x27;s books, best known for the picture book &quot;Shrek!&quot;, which inspired the film series of the same name, as well as others that included &quot;Sylvester and the Magic Pebble&quot;, &quot;Abel&#x27;s Island&quot;, and &quot;Doctor De Soto&quot;. He was the U.S. nominee for the biennial and international Hans Christian Andersen Awards, as both a children&#x27;s book illustrator in 1982 and a writer in 1988.

==Early life==
Steig was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1907, and grew up in the Bronx. His parents were Polish-Jewish immigrants from Lemberg, Austria-Hungary; both socialists. His father, Joseph Steig, was a house painter, and his mother, Laura Ebel Steig, was a seamstress who encouraged his artistic leanings. As a child, Steig dabbled in painting and was an avid reader of literature. Among other works, he was said to have been especially fascinated by &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. In addition to his artistic endeavors, Steig also did well at athletics, being a member of the collegiate All-American water polo team. He graduated from Townsend Harris High School at 15 but never completed college, though Steig attended three schools, spending two years at City College of New York, three years at the National Academy of Design, and a mere five days at the Yale School of Art before dropping out of each one.

==Career==
Hailed as the &quot;King of Cartoons&quot;, Steig began drawing illustrations and cartoons for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1930, producing more than 2,600 drawings and 117 covers for the magazine. One of his cartoon characters, Poor Pitiful Pearl, was made into a popular line of dolls starting in 1956.

For a 1934 auction organized by Langston Hughes to benefit the defence fund for the Scottsboro Boys — nine African-Americans who had been falsely accused of rape and denied fair trials — he contributed an untitled original drawing and a reprint of another.

Steig began writing children&#x27;s books when he was 61. In 1968, Steig published his first children&#x27;s book. He excelled here as well, and his third book, &quot;Sylvester and the Magic Pebble&quot; (1969), won the Caldecott Medal. Steig went on to write more than 30 children&#x27;s books, including the &quot;Doctor De Soto&quot; series, and he continued to write into his nineties. Among Steig&#x27;s other well-known works, the picture book &quot;Shrek!&quot; (1990) formed the basis for the DreamWorks Animation film, &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001). After the release of &quot;Shrek 2&quot; in 2004, Steig became the first sole-creator of an animated movie franchise that went on to generate over $1 billion from theatrical and ancillary markets after only one sequel.

When asked his opinion about the movie based on his picture book, &quot;Shrek&quot;, William Steig responded: &quot;It&#x27;s vulgar, it&#x27;s disgusting — and I loved it.&quot;

In 1984, Steig&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Doctor De Soto&quot;, directed by Michael Sporn, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. That same year, Steig received the CINE Golden Eagle Award in Education for the film adaptation of this book.

==Personal life and death==
Steig married four times and had three children. From 1936 to 1949, Steig was married to educator and artist Elizabeth Mead Steig (1909–83, sister of anthropologist Margaret Mead), from whom he was later divorced. For a time, Steig lived at 75½ Bedford Street, purported to be the narrowest house in Manhattan. Steig&#x27;s first marriage also made him a brother-in-law of Leo Rosten and an uncle of Mary Catherine Bateson. Steig and Mead were the parents of jazz flutist Jeremy Steig (playing the Pied Piper in &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot;) and a daughter, Lucinda. He married his second wife, Kari Homestead, in 1950, and they had a daughter, Margit Laura (now professionally known as Maggie Steig). After their divorce, he was married to Stephanie Healey from 1964 to 1966. His final marriage, to Jeanne Doron in 1968, endured for the rest of his life.

Steig&#x27;s brother, Irwin, was a journalist and painter, for whom William illustrated two books on poker strategy. His brother, Henry, was a jeweler and a writer who played the saxophone and painted. And his brother Arthur was a writer and poet, who, according to Steig, read &quot;The Nation&quot; in the cradle, was telepathic and &quot;drew as well as Picasso or Matisse&quot;.

Steig died of natural causes in Boston, Massachusetts, on October 3, 2003, at the age of 95. &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, which was released seven months after his death, was dedicated to his memory.

<text>Pierre Athanase Larousse (; 23 October 18173 January 1875) was a French grammarian, lexicographer and encyclopaedist. He published many of the outstanding educational and reference works of 19th-century France, including the 15-volume .

==Early life==

Pierre Larousse was born in Toucy, where his father was a blacksmith. At the age of sixteen he won a scholarship at the teaching school in Versailles. Four years later, he returned to Toucy to teach in a primary school, but became frustrated by the archaic and rigid teaching methods. In 1840 he moved to Paris to improve his own education by taking free courses.

==Career==

From 1848 to 1851, Larousse taught at a private boarding school, where he met his future wife, Suzanne Caubel (although they did not marry until 1872). Together, in 1849, they published a French language course for children. In 1851 he met Augustin Boyer, another disillusioned ex-teacher, and together they founded the &quot;Librairie Larousse et Boyer&quot; (Larousse and Boyer Bookshop). They published progressive textbooks for children, and instruction manuals for teachers, with an emphasis on developing the pupils&#x27; creativity and independence. In 1856 they published the &quot;New Dictionary of the French Language&quot;, the forerunner of the &quot;Petit Larousse&quot;, but Larousse was already starting to plan his next, much larger, project. On 27 December 1863 the first volume of the great encyclopedic dictionary, the (Great Universal 19th-Century Dictionary), appeared. It was praised by Victor Hugo and became a classic. It is still highly respected in its modern revised form. In 1869 Larousse ended his partnership with Boyer and spent the rest of his life working on the &quot;Great Dictionary&quot;. The dictionary was finished (15 volumes, 1866–76; supplements 1878 and 1890), by Larousse&#x27;s nephew Jules Hollier in 1876, after Larousse&#x27;s death (in Paris in 1875) from a stroke caused by exhaustion.

==Publishing legacy==
The publishing house Éditions Larousse still survives, but was acquired by Compagnie Européenne de Publication in 1984, Havas in 1997, Vivendi Universal in 1998, and the Lagardère Group in 2002. English-language variants of Éditions Larousse encyclopaedias were published for many decades by Hamlyn (publishers) and Prometheus Books.

<doc id="335520" wikidata="Q3063362" url="?curid=335520" title="Nosaltres, els valencians">
<text>Nosaltres, els valencians (; &quot;We, the Valencians&quot;), is a historical and political essay by the Valencian (Spain) author Joan Fuster, first published in 1962.

The book deals with Valencians, especially their national identity and their relationship with Spain, Catalonia and the Catalan-speaking community as a whole. It does so from an ardourous Catalanism.

The fact that it represented the first solid intellectual effort in the twentieth century to construct an overview of the past and the present of Valencians from a Catalanist point of view explains its relevance and controversy back in the day.
It was because of the novelty of this new Catalanist paradigm, consisting of Catalanism made from Valencia, that the book caused a stir in the Valencian Francoist establishment and, with the advent of democracy in Spain, still remained deeply controversial for its uncompromising views.

&quot;Nosaltres, els valencians&quot; marked the dawn of Valencian nationalism in its modern formulation. It was also the main force behind a revival of the &quot;Països Catalans&quot; idea and, with it, of the blaverist reaction against it as well.

==Criticism==
The book was criticized by some Valencian nationalists as well, who considered that Fuster took the Catalan nationalist model without adjusting it to the reality of what soon after (1982) became the present Valencian Community with the passing of the Valencian Statute of Autonomy.

==Influence==
The book remained most influential in the Valencian Community during the 1980s. It began losing relevance by the early 1990s, as the Unitat del Poble Valencià, a party which had been partially inspired by it, started shifting their doctrine from Catalanism to Valencianism-proper, still within the Catalanist tenet, though. To date, &quot;Nosaltres els Valencians&quot; remains a fundamental cornerstone of the literature on Valencian identity, as much despised by some —who see in it a Catalanist fifth column in Valencia— as revered by others —who regard it as a yet to be surpassed reflection on the Valencian identity.

==Sources and influences==

Fuster was influenced by Jaume Vicens i Vives&#x27;s 1954 essay &quot;Notícia de Catalunya&quot;. &quot;Notícia de Catalunya&quot; was to initially be titled &quot;Nosaltres els catalans&quot;, but it was renamed under Josep Pla&#x27;s advice, for fear of Francoist censorship. Fuster&#x27;s work has the same structure and intention of Vicens&#x27;.

<text>Vikram Seth (born 20 June 1952) is an Indian novelist and poet. He has written several novels and poetry books. He has won several awards such as Padma Shri, Sahitya Akademi Award, Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, WH Smith Literary Award and Crossword Book Award. Seth&#x27;s collections of poetry such as &quot;Mappings&quot; and &quot;Beastly Tales&quot; are notable contributions to the Indian English language poetry canon.

==Early life and education==
Seth was born on 20 June 1952 in Calcutta. His father, Prem Nath Seth, was an executive of Bata Shoes and his mother, Leila Seth, a Barrister by training, became the first female judge of the Delhi High Court and first woman to become Chief justice of a state High Court in India.

Seth was educated at the all-boys&#x27; private boarding school The Doon School in Dehradun, where he was editor-in-chief of &quot;The Doon School Weekly&quot;. At Doon, he was influenced by his teacher, the mountaineer Gurdial Singh, who taught him geography and according to Leila Seth, &quot;guided Vikram in many ways...encouraged him to appreciate Western classical music and instilled in him a love of adventure and daring.&quot; Singh later described Seth as an &quot;indefatigable worker, and he maintains without difficulty his distinguished level in studies...he has put in enormous amount of energy in other spheres of school life, in dramatics, in debating, in first aid, in music, and in editing the Doon School Weekly.&quot; After graduating from Doon, Seth went to Tonbridge School, England, to complete his A-levels. Later he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He then pursued a Ph.D. in Economics at Stanford University though never completed it.

==Work and style==
Seth has published eight books of poetry and three novels. In 1980, he wrote &quot;Mappings&quot;, his first book of poetry. The publication of &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot;, a 1,349-page novel, propelled Seth into the public limelight. It was adapted into a BBC television drama miniseries in 2020. His second novel, &quot;An Equal Music,&quot; deals with the troubled love-life of a violinist. Seth&#x27;s work &quot;Two Lives,&quot; published in 2005, is a memoir of the marriage of his great-uncle and aunt.

In addition to &quot;The Golden Gate,&quot; Seth has written other works of poetry including &quot;Mappings&quot; (1980), &quot;The Humble Administrator&#x27;s Garden&quot; (1985), &quot;All You Who Sleep Tonight&quot; (1990) and &quot;Three Chinese Poets&quot; (1992). His children&#x27;s book, &quot;Beastly Tales from Here and There&quot; (1992) consists of 10 stories about animals. He has written a travel book, &quot;From Heaven Lake: Travels through Sinkiang and Tibet&quot; (1983), an account of a journey through Tibet, China and Nepal. He was also commissioned by the English National Opera to write a libretto based on the Greek legend of Arion and the Dolphin. The opera was performed for the first time in June 1994.

A sequel to &quot;A Suitable Boy,&quot; &quot;A Suitable Girl&quot;, was announced in 2009, but has yet to be published.

Seth&#x27;s former literary agent Giles Gordon recalled being interviewed by Seth for the position, &quot;Vikram sat at one end of a long table and he began to grill us. It was absolutely incredible. He wanted to know our literary tastes, our views on poetry, our views on plays, which novelists we liked&quot;. Seth later explained to Gordon that he had passed the interview not because of commercial considerations, but because unlike the others he was the only agent who seemed as interested in his poetry as in his other writing. Seth followed what he has described as &quot;the ludicrous advance for that book&quot; (£250,000 for &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot;) with £500,000 for &quot;An Equal Music&quot; and £1.4 million for &quot;Two Lives&quot;. He prepared an acrostic poem for his address at Gordon&#x27;s 2005 memorial service.

On 16 June 2024, publishing house Speaking Tiger announced the release of Seth&#x27;s English translation of the sacred Hindu hymn &quot;Hanuman Chalisa&quot; - his first new work in over a decade.

== Views ==
Seth commented on the Indian general elections held during the summer of 2024 saying that &quot;we live in a better situation now than we lived a month ago&quot;. He made this comment less than a month after the elections were over and a new coalition government had been sworn in. Seth said &quot;at least now there is somewhat of limitation on autocracy.&quot;

On the recent sanction to prosecute the author Arundhati Roy, he noted that it was &quot;craziness.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Seth is bisexual. He was in a relationship with the violinist Philippe Honoré for ten years and dedicated his novel &quot;An Equal Music&quot; to him. In 2006, he became a leader of the campaign against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a law against homosexuality. When Section 377 was reinstated in 2013, Seth continued campaigning against the law.

Seth divides his time between the United Kingdom, where he bought and renovated the former home of the Anglican poet George Herbert near Salisbury, and India, where he has a family home in Noida, Uttar Pradesh.

<text>The Stefan Batory Foundation () is an independent Polish non-government organization established by American financier and philanthropist, George Soros, along with a group of Polish opposition leaders of 1980s, and registered in Poland since May 1988. It is named after Stephen Báthory, the 16th-century Polish king. The foundation&#x27;s mission is to support the development of an open, democratic society in Poland along with other Central and East European countries.

Foundation&#x27;s activity is financed from income on endowment and grants from foreign institutions, from gifts of individual donors and 1% personal income tax designations.

==History and beginnings==
The Batory Foundation was founded in 1988 when the communist system in Central Europe was disintegrating. It was established by an American philanthropist of Hungarian extraction, George Soros, and Polish democratic opposition leaders of the 1980s. The mission of the foundation was to contribute to the preparation of Polish society in the transition from communism to democracy, civil society and a market economy.

Early on, the Batory Foundation invested in the preparation of cadres for the market economy and democratic system taking roots in Poland by funding hundreds of scholarships and travel grants for economists, bankers, physicians, teachers, and local government activists. It also made a significant contribution to the various reforms being implemented in the country after the collapse of communism, supporting the reform of local government, public administration, and social welfare policy. These reform-related initiatives eventually gave rise to the Institute of Public Affairs, a major think-tank in Warsaw, which the foundation helped to establish in 1995.

The foundation disbursed hundreds of micro-grants to a variety of local civic initiatives, contributing to the establishment of numerous local organizations.

Until 2007, the Stefan Batory Foundation has spent US$95.9 million on all its programs, US$71 million of which were assigned for grantmaking. Throughout 2007, the foundation provided 513 grants to institutions and organizations, 47 travel grants to cover costs of 169 participants attending events and projects abroad, as well as 5 awards; overall expenditure for grantmaking and operational activities in 2007 totaled EUR 4,9 million.

==Priorities of the Foundation==
In 2016, the foundation ran three grantmaking, and five operational programs.

===Grantmaking programs===
*Citizens for Democracy – the aim of the Programme, planned for 2013-2016 is to strengthen civil society development and enhance the contribution of non-governmental organizations.

*Equal Opportunities – a local scholarship system for secondary school students run by the foundation since 2000.
*For Belarus – the program&#x27;s objective is to support civic initiatives and preparing for democratic changes in Belarus.

===Operational programs===
*Batory Foundation Debates 
*Your Vote, Your Choice – the program&#x27;s goal is to increase public interest in local affairs and to encourage civic participation in public life, including participation in local and parliamentary elections.

*Open Europe 
*Regional Drug and Alcohol Program – the aim of the program is to transfer the Polish experience in fighting alcohol, drug and other additions to Eastern European and Central Asian countries

<text>Open Society Foundations (OSF), formerly the Open Society Institute, is a US-based grantmaking network founded by business magnate George Soros. Open Society Foundations financially supports civil society groups around the world, with the stated aim of advancing justice, education, public health and independent media. The group&#x27;s name was inspired by Karl Popper&#x27;s 1945 book &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;.

As of 2015, the OSF had branches in 37 countries, encompassing a group of country and regional foundations, such as the Open Society Initiative for West Africa, and the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa. The organization’s headquarters is located at 224 West 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. In 2018, OSF announced it was closing its European office in Budapest and moving to Berlin, in response to legislation passed by the Hungarian government targeting the foundation&#x27;s activities. As of 2021, OSF has reported expenditures in excess of US$16 billion since its establishment in 1993, mostly in grants to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) aligned with the organization&#x27;s mission.

==History==
On May 28, 1984, George Soros signed a contract between the Soros Foundation/New York City and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the founding document of the Soros Foundation/Budapest. This was followed by several foundations in the region to help countries move away from Soviet-style socialism in the Eastern Bloc.

In 1991, the foundation merged with the (&quot;Foundation for European Intellectual Mutual Aid&quot;), an affiliate of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, created in 1966 to imbue &#x27;non-conformist&#x27; Eastern European scientists with anti-totalitarian and capitalist ideas.

In 1993, the Open Society Institute was created in the United States to support the Soros foundations in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia.

In August 2010, it started using the name Open Society Foundations (OSF) to better reflect its role as a benefactor for civil society groups in countries around the world.

In 1995, Soros stated that he believed there can be no absolute answers to political questions because the same principle of reflexivity applies as in financial markets.

In 2012, Christopher Stone joined the OSF as the second president. He replaced Aryeh Neier, who served as president from 1993 to 2012. Stone announced in September 2017 that he was stepping down as president. In January 2018, Patrick Gaspard was appointed president of the Open Society Foundations. He announced in December 2020 that he was stepping down as president. In January 2021, Mark Malloch-Brown was appointed president of the Open Society Foundations. On March 11, 2024, OSF announced that Binaifer Nowrojee would start as the group&#x27;s new president on June 1, 2024. 

In 2016, the OSF was reportedly the target of a cyber security breach. Documents and information reportedly belonging to the OSF were published by a website. The cyber security breach has been described as sharing similarities with Russian-linked cyberattacks that targeted other institutions, such as the Democratic National Committee.

In 2017, Soros transferred $18 billion to the foundation.

In 2020, Soros announced that he was creating the Open Society University Network (OSUN), endowing the network with $1 billion.

In 2023, George Soros handed over the leadership of the foundation to his son Alexander Soros, who soon announced layoffs of 40 percent of staff and &quot;significant changes&quot; to the operating model.

==Activities==
The Library of Congress Soros Foundation Visiting Fellows Program was initiated in 1990.

Its $873 million budget in 2013 ranked as the second-largest private philanthropy budget in the United States, after the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation budget of $3.9 billion. As of 2020, its budget increased to $1.2 billion.

In August 2013, the foundation partly sponsored an Aromanian cultural event in Malovište (), North Macedonia.

The foundation reported granting at least $33 million to civil rights and social justice organizations in the United States. This funding included groups such as the Organization for Black Struggle and Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment that supported protests in the wake of the killing of Trayvon Martin, the death of Eric Garner, the shooting of Tamir Rice and the shooting of Michael Brown. According to OpenSecrets, the OSF spends much of its resources on democratic causes around the world, and has also contributed to groups such as the Tides Foundation.

The OSF has been a major financial supporter of US immigration reform, including establishing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

OSF projects have included the National Security and Human Rights Campaign and the Lindesmith Center, which conducted research on drug reform.

The OSF became a partner of the National Democratic Institute, a charitable organization which partnered with pro-democracy groups like the Gov2U project run by Scytl.

On January 23, 2020, the OSF announced a contribution of $1 billion from George Soros for the new Open Society University Network (OSUN), which supports Western university faculty in providing university courses, programs, and research to serve neglected student populations worldwide at institutions needing international partners. The founding institutions were Bard College and Central European University.

In April 2022, OSF announced a grant of $20 million to the International Crisis Group in support of efforts to analyze global issues fuelling violence, climate injustice and economic inequality and providing recommendations to address them.

OSF has given grants to Jewish Voice for Peace.

==Critical reception==
In 2007, Nicolas Guilhot (a senior research associate at the French National Centre for Scientific Research) wrote in &quot;Critical Sociology&quot; that the Open Society Foundations is functionally conservative in supporting institutions that reinforce the existing social order, as the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation have done before them. Guilhot argues that control over the social sciences by moneyed interests, rather than by public officials, reinforced a neoliberal view of modernization.

An OSF effort in 2008 in the African Great Lakes region aimed at spreading human rights awareness among prostitutes in Uganda and other nations in the area was rejected by Ugandan authorities, who considered it an effort to legalize and legitimize prostitution.

Open Society Foundations has been criticized in the pro-Israel publications &quot;Tablet&quot;, &quot;Arutz Sheva&quot; and &quot;Jewish Press&quot; for funding the activist groups Adalah and I&#x27;lam, they accuse of being anti-Israel and supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. Among the documents released in 2016 by DCleaks, an OSF report reads &quot;For a variety of reasons, we wanted to construct a diversified portfolio of grants dealing with Israel and Palestine, funding both Israeli Jewish and PCI (Palestinian Citizens of Israel) groups as well as building a portfolio of Palestinian grants and in all cases to maintain a low profile and relative distance—particularly on the advocacy front.&quot;

In 2013, NGO Monitor, an Israeli NGO, reported that &quot;Soros has been a frequent critic of Israeli government policy, and does not consider himself a Zionist, but there is no evidence that he or his family holds any special hostility or opposition to the existence of the state of Israel. This report will show that their support, and that of the Open Society Foundations, has nevertheless gone to organizations with such agendas.&quot; The report says its objective is to inform the OSF, claiming: &quot;The evidence demonstrates that Open Society funding contributes significantly to anti-Israel campaigns in three important respects:

# Active in the Durban strategy;
# Funding aimed at weakening United States support for Israel by shifting public opinion regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iran;
# Funding for Israeli political opposition groups on the fringes of Israeli society, which use the rhetoric of human rights to advocate for marginal political goals.&quot;

The report concludes, &quot;Yet, to what degree Soros, his family, and the Open Society Foundations are aware of the cumulative impact on Israel and of the political warfare conducted by many of their beneficiaries is an open question.&quot;

In November 2015, Russia banned the group on its territory, declaring &quot;It was found that the activity of the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation represents a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state&quot;.

In 2017, Open Society Foundations and other NGOs for open government and refugee assistance were targeted by authoritarian and populist governments emboldened by the first Trump Administration. Several right-leaning politicians in eastern Europe regard many of the NGO groups to be irritants if not threats, including Liviu Dragnea in Romania, Szilard Nemeth in Hungary, Nikola Gruevski in North Macedonia (who called for &quot;de-Sorosization&quot;), and Jarosław Kaczyński of Poland (who has said that Soros-funded groups want &quot;societies without identity&quot;). Some of the Soros-funded advocacy groups in the region said the harassment and intimidation became more open after the 2016 election of Donald Trump in the United States. Stefania Kapronczay of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, which received half of its funding from Soros-backed foundations, claimed that Hungarian officials were &quot;testing the waters&quot; in an effort to see &quot;what they can get away with.&quot;

In 2017, the government of Pakistan ordered the Open Society Foundations to cease operations in the country.

In May 2018, Open Society Foundations announced they will move its office from Budapest to Berlin, amid Hungarian government interference.

In November 2018, Open Society Foundations announced they are ceasing operations in Turkey and closing their Istanbul and Ankara offices due to &quot;false accusations and speculations beyond measure&quot;, amid pressure from the Turkish government including detention of liberal Turkish intellectuals and academics even tangentially associated with the foundation.

<doc id="335530" wikidata="Q17035486" url="?curid=335530" title="Treatise (music)">
<text>Treatise is a musical composition by British composer Cornelius Cardew (1936–81).
==Summary==
Written between 1963 and 1967, &quot;Treatise&quot; is a graphic musical score comprising 193 pages of lines, symbols, and various geometric or abstract shapes that largely eschew conventional musical notation. Implicit in the title is a reference to the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, which was of particular inspiration to Cardew in composing the work. The score is not accompanied by any explicit instructions to the performers in how to perform the work, or what sound-producing means are to be used. Although the bottom of each page has two five-line musical staves, this is apparently not meant to suggest piano or other keyboard instrument(s), only to indicate that the graphic elements are musical and not purely artistic in character.

Although the score allows for absolute interpretive freedom (no one interpretation will sound like another), the work is not normally played spontaneously, as Cardew had previously suggested that performers devise in advance their own rules and methods for interpreting and performing the work. There are, however, almost infinite possibilities for the interpretation of &quot;Treatise&quot; that fall within the implications of the piece and general principles of experimental music performance in the late 1960s, including presentation as visual art and map-reading.

The British composer Julian Anderson describes &quot;Treatise&quot; as &quot;very suggestive musically...what&#x27;s wrong with playing, say 10 pages of &quot;Treatise&quot; only using the white notes, or only using maybe the Dorian mode.&quot; The few available recordings, or more accurately, recordings of realisations of the score, all adopt a relative slow tempo and a sonic world, which &quot;sounds like AMM&quot;.

Subsequently Cardew embraced Maoism and wholeheartedly repudiated this and other works of his avant-garde period. A savage indictment of &quot;Treatise&quot; may be seen in a speech delivered by Cardew at the ‘International Symposium on the Problematic of Today’s Musical Notation’ held in Rome in October 1972, as transcribed in his highly polemical book &quot;Stockhausen Serves Imperialism&quot; (1974). Curiously, Cardew did not withdraw &quot;Treatise&quot; from publication, despite his repudiation.

==In popular culture==
Sonic Youth play a 3:29 minute excerpt of page 183 of &quot;Treatise&quot; on their album &quot;SYR4: Goodbye 20th Century&quot; (1999).

<text>Disgrace is a novel by J. M. Coetzee, published in 1999. It won the Booker Prize. The writer was also awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature four years after its publication.

==Plot==
David Lurie is a white South African professor of English who loses everything: his reputation, his job, his peace of mind, his dreams of artistic success, and finally even his ability to protect his own daughter. He is twice-divorced and dissatisfied with his job as a &#x27;communications&#x27; lecturer, teaching a class in romantic literature at a technical university in Cape Town in post-apartheid South Africa. Lurie&#x27;s sexual activities are all inherently risky. Before the sexual affair that will ruin him, he becomes attached to a prostitute and attempts to have a romantic relationship with her (despite her having a family), which she rebuffs. He then seduces a secretary at his university, only to completely ignore her afterwards. His &quot;disgrace&quot; comes when he seduces one of his more vulnerable students, a girl named Melanie Isaacs, grooming her with alcohol and other actions that arguably amount to rape. Later, when she stops attending his class as a result, he falsifies her grades. Lurie refuses to stop the affair, even after being threatened by Melanie&#x27;s erstwhile boyfriend, who knocks the papers off Lurie&#x27;s desk, and her father, who confronts him but whom David runs from. This affair is thereafter revealed to the school, amidst a climate of condemnation for his allegedly predatory acts, and a committee is convened to pass judgement on his actions. David refuses to read Melanie&#x27;s statement, defend himself, or apologize in any sincere form and so is forced to resign from his post. Lurie is working on an opera concerning Lord Byron&#x27;s final phase of life in Italy which mirrors his own life in that Byron is living a life of hedonism and excess and is having an affair with a married woman.

Dismissed from his teaching position, he takes refuge on his lesbian daughter Lucy&#x27;s farm in the Eastern Cape. For a time, his daughter&#x27;s influence and natural rhythms of the farm promise to harmonise his discordant life; for example, in attending farmers markets where Lucy sells her wares, and in working with Petrus, a polygamously-married black African whose farm borders Lucy&#x27;s and who nominally works for Lucy as a &quot;dog-man&quot; (Lucy boards dogs). But the balance of power in the country is shifting. Shortly after becoming comfortable with rural life, he is forced to come to terms with the aftermath of an attack on the farm. Three men, who claim to need Lucy&#x27;s phone to call for aid for a sick relative, force their way into the farmhouse. The men rape Lucy and attempt to kill David by setting him on fire. In addition, they also shoot the caged dogs which Lucy is boarding, an action which David later muses was done since black people in South Africa are taught to fear dogs as symbols of white power and oppression. The men drive off in David&#x27;s car: it is never recovered and they are never caught, although police once contact David to come pick up &quot;his&quot; car, which is in fact evidently not his car (different colour and registration number, different sound system). To David&#x27;s relief, newspapers spell Lurie&#x27;s name inaccurately (&quot;Lourie&quot;), meaning nothing will tie his disgraced academic persona to the news story describing the attack on his daughter&#x27;s farm.

Lucy becomes apathetic and agoraphobic after the attack. David presses her to report the full circumstances to the police, but she does not. Lucy does not want to, and in fact does not, discuss the attack with David until much later. The relationship between Lucy and David begins to show strain as the two recover from the attack in different ways. Lurie begins work with Bev Shaw, a friend of Lucy&#x27;s, who keeps an animal shelter and frequently euthanizes animals, which David then disposes of. Shaw has an affair with Lurie, despite David finding her physically unattractive. Meanwhile, David suspects Petrus being complicit in the attack. This suspicion is strengthened when one of the attackers, a young man named Pollux, attends one of Petrus&#x27;s parties and is claimed by Petrus as a kinsman. Lucy refuses to take action against Pollux, and she and David simply leave the party. As the relationship between Lucy and David deteriorates, David decides to discontinue living with his daughter and return to Cape Town.

Returning home to his house in Cape Town, David finds that his house has been broken into during his long absence. He attempts to attend a theatre performance starring Melanie, but is harassed into leaving by the same boyfriend who had earlier threatened him. He also attempts to apologize to Melanie&#x27;s father, leading to an awkward meeting with Melanie&#x27;s younger sister, which rekindles David&#x27;s internal passion and lust. David finally meets with Melanie&#x27;s father, who makes him stay for dinner. Melanie&#x27;s father insists that his forgiveness is irrelevant: Lurie must follow his own path to redemption.

At the novel&#x27;s end, Lurie returns to Lucy&#x27;s farm. Lucy has become pregnant by one of the rapists, but ignores advice to terminate the pregnancy. Pollux ultimately comes to live with Petrus, and spies on Lucy bathing. When David catches Pollux doing this, Lucy forces David to desist from any retribution. David surmises that ultimately, Lucy will be forced into marrying Petrus and giving him her land, and it appears that Lucy is resigned to this contingency. Lurie returns to working with Shaw, where Lurie has been keeping a resilient stray from being euthanised. The novel concludes as Lurie &quot;gives him up&quot; to Bev Shaw&#x27;s euthanasia.

==Reception==
===Critical Reception===
Upon release, &quot;Disgrace&quot; was generally well-received among the British press. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Observer&quot;, &quot;Spectator&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Independent On Sunday&quot;, &quot;Literary Review&quot;, and &quot;TLS&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the novel an average rating of 7.3 out of 10 based on reviews from multiple British newspapers. According to Adam Mars-Jones, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Any novel set in post-apartheid South Africa is fated to be read as a political portrait, but the fascination of &quot;Disgrace&quot; is the way it both encourages and contests such a reading by holding extreme alternatives in tension. Salvation, ruin.&quot; On BookBrowse, a site that aggregates book reviews such as media reviews, the book received a from &quot;Critics&#x27; Opinion&quot;. The book also, based on critics reviews on BookBrowse, ranged from &quot; to a &quot;. Globally, the work was received very well with Complete Review saying on the consensus &quot;&quot;Very&quot; impressed.&quot;.

===Awards and Lists===
The book continued to receive acclaim among many critics lists after and during its time of release. According to &quot;The Greatest Books&quot;, a site that aggregates book lists, it is &quot;The 220th greatest book of all time&quot;. A 2006 poll of &quot;literary luminaries&quot; by &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper named the work as the &quot;greatest novel of the last 25 years&quot; of British, Irish or Commonwealth origin in years between 1980 and 2005. On 5 November 2019 BBC News listed &quot;Disgrace&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

==Interpretation==
In the new South Africa, violence is unleashed in new ways, and Lurie and his daughter become victims, yet the main character is no hero; on the contrary, he commits violence in his own way as is clearly seen in Lurie&#x27;s disregard for the feelings of his student as he manipulates her into having sexual relations with him. This characterization of violence by both the &#x27;white&#x27; and the &#x27;black&#x27; man parallels feelings in post-apartheid South Africa where evil does not belong to the &#x27;other&#x27; alone. By resisting the relegation of each group into positive and negative poles Coetzee portrays the whole range of human capabilities and emotions.

The novel takes its inspiration from South Africa&#x27;s contemporary social and political conflict, and offers a bleak look at a country in transition. This theme of transition is represented in various forms throughout the novel, in David&#x27;s loss of authority, loss of sexuality and in the change in power dynamics of groups that were once solely dominant or subordinate.

Sarah Ruden suggests that:

As in all of his mature novels, Coetzee here deals with the theme of exploitation. His favorite approach has been to explore the innocuous-seeming use of another person to fill one&#x27;s gentler emotional needs.
This is a story of both regional and universal significance. The central character is a confusing person, at once an intellectual snob who is contemptuous of others and also a person who commits outrageous mistakes. His story is also local; he is a white South African male in a world where such men no longer hold the power they once did. He is forced to rethink his entire world at an age when he believes he is too old to change and, in fact, should have a right not to. This theme, about the challenges of aging both on an individual and societal level, leads to a line, &quot;No country, this, for old men&quot;, an ironic reference to the opening line of the W. B. Yeats poem, &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot;. Furthermore, Lurie calls his preference for younger women a &quot;right of desire&quot;, a quote taken up by South African writer André Brink for his novel &quot;The Rights of Desire&quot;.

By the end of the novel, though, Lurie seems to mature beyond his exploitative view of women. In recognizing the right of Lucy to choose her course in life, he finally puts &quot;their strained relationship on a more equal footing&quot; — the first time in his relationships with women. His pursuit of a sexual relationship with Bev Shaw also marks something of a path toward personal salvation, &quot;by annihilating his sexual vanity and his sense of superiority.&quot;

This is Coetzee&#x27;s second book (after &quot;Life and Times of Michael K&quot;) where man is broken down almost to nothing before he finds some tiny measure of redemption in his forced acceptance of the realities of life and death. Coetzee has always situated his characters in extreme situations that compel them to explore what it means to be human. Though the novel is sparse in style, it covers a number of topics: personal shame, the subjugation of women, a changing country, and romantic poetry and its allegory and symbolism.

Another important theme in the novel is the difficulty or impossibility of communication and the limits of language. Although Lurie teaches communications at Cape Town Technical University and is a scholar of poetry, language often fails him. Coetzee writes:

Although he devotes hours of each day to his new discipline, he finds its first premise, as enunciated in the Communications 101 handbook, preposterous: &#x27;Human society has created language in order that we may communicate our thoughts, feelings, and intentions to each other.&#x27; His own opinion, which he does not air, is that the origins of speech lie in song, and the origins of song in the need to fill out with sound the overlarge and rather empty human soul.
A film adaptation of &quot;Disgrace&quot; starring John Malkovich had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2008, where it won the International Critics&#x27; Award.

<text>In literature, Romanticism found recurrent themes in the evocation or criticism of the past, the cult of &quot;sensibility&quot; with its emphasis on women and children, the isolation of the artist or narrator, and respect for nature. Furthermore, several romantic authors, such as Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Maturin and Nathaniel Hawthorne, based their writings on the supernatural/occult and human psychology. Romanticism tended to regard satire as something unworthy of serious attention, a view still influential today. The Romantic movement in literature was preceded by the Enlightenment and succeeded by Realism.

Some authors cite 16th-century poet Isabella di Morra as an early precursor of Romantic literature. Her lyrics covering themes of isolation and loneliness, which reflected the tragic events of her life, are considered &quot;an impressive prefigurement of Romanticism&quot;, differing from the Petrarchist fashion of the time based on the philosophy of love.

The precursors of Romanticism in English poetry go back to the middle of the 18th century, including figures such as Joseph Warton (headmaster at Winchester College) and his brother Thomas Warton, Professor of Poetry at Oxford University. Joseph maintained that invention and imagination were the chief qualities of a poet. The Scottish poet James Macpherson influenced the early development of Romanticism with the international success of his Ossian cycle of poems published in 1762, inspiring both Goethe and the young Walter Scott. Thomas Chatterton is generally considered the first Romantic poet in English. Both Chatterton and Macpherson&#x27;s work involved elements of fraud, as what they claimed was earlier literature that they had discovered or compiled was, in fact, entirely their own work. The Gothic novel, beginning with Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; (1764), was an important precursor of one strain of Romanticism, with a delight in horror and threat, and exotic picturesque settings, matched in Walpole&#x27;s case by his role in the early revival of Gothic architecture. &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, a novel by Laurence Sterne (1759–67), introduced a whimsical version of the anti-rational sentimental novel to the English literary public.

==Germany==

An early German influence came from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, whose 1774 novel &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; had young men throughout Europe emulating its protagonist, a young artist with a very sensitive and passionate temperament. At that time Germany was a multitude of small separate states, and Goethe&#x27;s works would have a seminal influence in developing a unifying sense of nationalism. Another philosophic influence came from the German idealism of Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schelling, making Jena (where Fichte lived, as well as Schelling, Hegel, Schiller and the brothers Schlegel) a centre for early German Romanticism (see Jena Romanticism). Important writers were Ludwig Tieck, Novalis, Heinrich von Kleist and Friedrich Hölderlin. Heidelberg later became a centre of German Romanticism, where writers and poets such as Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, and Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff (&quot;Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts&quot;) met regularly in literary circles.

Important motifs in German Romanticism are travelling, nature, for example the German Forest, and Germanic myths. The later German Romanticism of, for example E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;Der Sandmann&quot; (&quot;The Sandman&quot;), 1817, and Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff&#x27;s &quot;Das Marmorbild&quot; (&quot;The Marble Statue&quot;), 1819, was darker in its motifs and has gothic elements. The significance to Romanticism of childhood innocence, the importance of imagination, and racial theories all combined to give an unprecedented importance to folk literature, non-classical mythology and children&#x27;s literature, above all in Germany. Brentano and von Arnim were significant literary figures who together published &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; (&quot;The Boy&#x27;s Magic Horn&quot; or cornucopia), a collection of versified folk tales, in 1806–08. The first collection of &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; by the Brothers Grimm was published in 1812. Unlike the much later work of Hans Christian Andersen, who was publishing his invented tales in Danish from 1835, these German works were at least mainly based on collected folk tales, and the Grimms remained true to the style of the telling in their early editions, though later rewriting some parts. One of the brothers, Jacob, published in 1835 &quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot;, a long academic work on Germanic mythology. Another strain is exemplified by Schiller&#x27;s highly emotional language and the depiction of physical violence in his play &quot;The Robbers&quot; of 1781.

==Great Britain==
In English literature, the key figures of the Romantic movement are considered to be the group of poets including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley and the much older William Blake, followed later by the isolated figure of John Clare; also such novelists as Walter Scott from Scotland and Mary Shelley, and the essayists William Hazlitt and Charles Lamb. The publication in 1798 of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, with many of the finest poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge, is often held to mark the start of the movement. The majority of the poems were by Wordsworth, and many dealt with the lives of the poor in his native Lake District, or his feelings about nature—which he more fully developed in his long poem &quot;The Prelude&quot;, never published in his lifetime. The longest poem in the volume was Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, which showed the Gothic side of English Romanticism, and the exotic settings that many works featured. In the period when they were writing, the Lake Poets were widely regarded as a marginal group of radicals, though they were supported by the critic and writer William Hazlitt and others.
In contrast, Lord Byron and Walter Scott achieved enormous fame and influence throughout Europe with works exploiting the violence and drama of their exotic and historical settings; Goethe called Byron &quot;undoubtedly the greatest genius of our century&quot;. Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot; in 1805, followed by the full epic poem &quot;Marmion&quot; in 1808. Both were set in the distant Scottish past, already evoked in &quot;Ossian&quot;; Romanticism and Scotland were to have a long and fruitful partnership. Byron had equal success with the first part of &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot; in 1812, followed by four &quot;Turkish tales&quot;, all in the form of long poems, starting with &quot;The Giaour&quot; in 1813, drawing from his Grand Tour, which had reached Ottoman Europe, and orientalizing the themes of the Gothic novel in verse. These featured different variations of the &quot;Byronic hero&quot;, and his own life contributed a further version. Scott meanwhile was effectively inventing the historical novel, beginning in 1814 with &quot;Waverley&quot;, set in the 1745 Jacobite rising, which was a highly profitable success, followed by over 20 further Waverley Novels over the next 17 years, with settings going back to the Crusades that he had researched to a degree that was new in literature.

In contrast to Germany, Romanticism in English literature had little connection with nationalism, and the Romantics were often regarded with suspicion for the sympathy many felt for the ideals of the French Revolution, whose collapse and replacement with the dictatorship of Napoleon was, as elsewhere in Europe, a shock to the movement. Though his novels celebrated Scottish identity and history, Scott was politically a firm Unionist, but admitted to Jacobite sympathies. Several Romantics spent much time abroad, and a famous stay on Lake Geneva with Byron and Shelley in 1816 produced the hugely influential novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; by Shelley&#x27;s wife-to-be Mary Shelley and the novella &quot;The Vampyre&quot; by Byron&#x27;s doctor John William Polidori. The lyrics of Robert Burns in Scotland, and Thomas Moore from Ireland, reflected in different ways their countries and the Romantic interest in folk literature, but neither had a fully Romantic approach to life or their work.

Though they have modern critical champions such as György Lukács, Scott&#x27;s novels are today more likely to be experienced in the form of the many operas that composers continued to base on them over the following decades, such as Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; and Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot; (both 1835). Byron is now most highly regarded for his short lyrics and his generally unromantic prose writings, especially his letters, and his unfinished satire &quot;Don Juan&quot;. Unlike many Romantics, Byron&#x27;s widely publicised personal life appeared to match his work, and his death at 36 in 1824 from disease when helping the Greek War of Independence appeared from a distance to be a suitably Romantic end, entrenching his legend. Keats in 1821 and Shelley in 1822 both died in Italy, Blake (at almost 70) in 1827, and Coleridge largely ceased to write in the 1820s. Wordsworth was by 1820 respectable and highly regarded, holding a government sinecure, but wrote relatively little. In the discussion of English literature, the Romantic period is often regarded as finishing around the 1820s, or sometimes even earlier, although many authors of the succeeding decades were no less committed to Romantic values.

The most significant novelist in English during the peak Romantic period, other than Walter Scott, was Jane Austen, whose essentially conservative world-view had little in common with her Romantic contemporaries, retaining a strong belief in decorum and social rules, though critics such as Claudia L. Johnson have detected tremors under the surface of many works, such as &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; (1817), &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; (1814) and &quot;Persuasion&quot; (1817). But around the mid-century the undoubtedly Romantic novels of the Yorkshire-based Brontë family appeared, most notably Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and Emily&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, both published in 1847, which also introduced more Gothic themes. While these two novels were written and published after the Romantic period is said to have ended, their novels were heavily influenced by Romantic literature they had read as children.

Byron, Keats, and Shelley all wrote for the stage, but with little success in England, with Shelley&#x27;s &quot;The Cenci&quot; perhaps the best work produced, though that was not played in a public theatre in England until a century after his death. Byron&#x27;s plays, along with dramatizations of his poems and Scott&#x27;s novels, were much more popular on the Continent, and especially in France, and through these versions several were turned into operas, many still performed today. If contemporary poets had little success on the stage, the period was a legendary one for performances of Shakespeare, and went some way to restoring his original texts and removing the Augustan &quot;improvements&quot; to them. The greatest actor of the period, Edmund Kean, restored the tragic ending to &quot;King Lear&quot;; Coleridge said that &quot;Seeing him act was like reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning.&quot;

===Scotland===
Although after union with England in 1707 Scotland increasingly adopted English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. Allan Ramsay (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the Habbie stanza as a poetic form. James Macpherson (1736–1796) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard Ossian, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. &quot;Fingal&quot;, written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, through its influence on Johann Gottfried von Herder and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. It was also popularised in France by figures that included Napoleon. Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from Scottish Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.

Robert Burns (1759–96) and Walter Scott (1771–1832) were highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and a major influence on the Romantic movement. His poem (and song) &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; is often sung at Hogmanay (the last day of the year), and &quot;Scots Wha Hae&quot; served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of the country. Scott began as a poet and also collected and published Scottish ballads. His first prose work, &quot;Waverley&quot; in 1814, is often called the first historical novel. It launched a highly successful career, with other historical novels such as &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1817), &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot; (1818) and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1820). Scott probably did more than any other figure to define and popularise Scottish cultural identity in the nineteenth century. Other major literary figures connected with Romanticism include the poets and novelists James Hogg (1770–1835), Allan Cunningham (1784–1842) and John Galt (1779–1839). 
 Scotland was also the location of two of the most important literary magazines of the era, &quot;The Edinburgh Review&quot; (founded in 1802) and &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (founded in 1817), which had a major impact on the development of British literature and drama in the era of Romanticism. Ian Duncan and Alex Benchimol suggest that publications like the novels of Scott and these magazines were part of a highly dynamic Scottish Romanticism that by the early nineteenth century, caused Edinburgh to emerge as the cultural capital of Britain and become central to a wider formation of a &quot;British Isles nationalism&quot;.

Scottish &quot;national drama&quot; emerged in the early 1800s, as plays with specifically Scottish themes began to dominate the Scottish stage. Theatres had been discouraged by the Church of Scotland and fears of Jacobite assemblies. In the later eighteenth century, many plays were written for and performed by small amateur companies and were not published and so most have been lost. Towards the end of the century there were &quot;closet dramas&quot;, primarily designed to be read, rather than performed, including work by Scott, Hogg, Galt and Joanna Baillie (1762–1851), often influenced by the ballad tradition and Gothic Romanticism.

==France==

Romanticism was relatively late in developing in French literature, more so than in the visual arts. The 18th-century precursor to Romanticism, the cult of sensibility, had become associated with the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, and the French Revolution had been more of an inspiration to foreign writers than those experiencing it at first-hand. The first major figure was François-René de Chateaubriand, an aristocrat who had remained a royalist throughout the Revolution, and returned to France from exile in England and America under Napoleon, with whose regime he had an uneasy relationship. His writings, all in prose, included some fiction, such as his influential novella of exile &quot;René&quot; (1802), which anticipated Byron in its alienated hero, but mostly contemporary history and politics, his travels, a defence of religion and the medieval spirit (&quot;Génie du christianisme&quot;, 1802), and finally in the 1830s and 1840s his enormous autobiography &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;Outre-Tombe&quot; (&quot;Memoirs from beyond the grave&quot;).

After the Bourbon Restoration, French Romanticism developed in the lively world of Parisian theatre, with productions of Shakespeare, Schiller (in France a key Romantic author), and adaptations of Scott and Byron alongside French authors, several of whom began to write in the late 1820s. Cliques of pro- and anti-Romantics developed, and productions were often accompanied by raucous vocalizing by the two sides, including the shouted assertion by one theatregoer in 1822 that &quot;Shakespeare, c&#x27;est l&#x27;aide-de-camp de Wellington&quot; (&quot;Shakespeare is Wellington&#x27;s aide-de-camp&quot;). Alexandre Dumas began as a dramatist, with a series of successes beginning with &quot;Henri III et sa cour&quot; (1829) before turning to novels that were mostly historical adventures somewhat in the manner of Scott, most famously &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, both of 1844. Victor Hugo published as a poet in the 1820s before achieving success on the stage with &quot;Hernani&quot;—a historical drama in a quasi-Shakespearean style that had famously riotous performances on its first run in 1830. Like Dumas, Hugo is best known for his novels, and was already writing &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; (1831), one of the best known works, which became a paradigm of the French Romantic movement. The preface to his unperformed play &quot;Cromwell&quot; gives an important manifesto of French Romanticism, stating that &quot;there are no rules, or models&quot;. The career of Prosper Mérimée followed a similar pattern; he is now best known as the originator of the story of &quot;Carmen&quot;, with his novella published 1845. Alfred de Vigny remains best known as a dramatist, with his play on the life of the English poet &quot;Chatterton&quot; (1835) perhaps his best work. George Sand was a central figure of the Parisian literary scene, famous both for her novels and criticism and her affairs with Chopin and several others; she too was inspired by the theatre, and wrote works to be staged at her private estate.

French Romantic poets of the 1830s to 1850s include Alfred de Musset, Gérard de Nerval, Alphonse de Lamartine and the flamboyant Théophile Gautier, whose prolific output in various forms continued until his death in 1872.

Stendhal is today probably the most highly regarded French novelist of the period, but he stands in a complex relation with Romanticism, and is notable for his penetrating psychological insight into his characters and his realism, qualities rarely prominent in Romantic fiction. As a survivor of the French retreat from Moscow in 1812, fantasies of heroism and adventure had little appeal for him, and like Goya he is often seen as a forerunner of Realism. His most important works are &quot;Le Rouge et le Noir&quot; (&quot;The Red and the Black&quot;, 1830) and &quot;La Chartreuse de Parme&quot; (&quot;The Charterhouse of Parma&quot;, 1839).

== Poland ==
Romanticism in Poland is often taken to begin with the publication of Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s first poems in 1822, and end with the crushing of the January Uprising of 1863 against the Russians. It was strongly marked by interest in Polish history. Polish Romanticism revived the old &quot;Sarmatism&quot; traditions of the &quot;szlachta&quot; or Polish nobility. Old traditions and customs were revived and portrayed in a positive light in the Polish messianic movement and in works of great Polish poets such as Adam Mickiewicz (&quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;), Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński. This close connection between Polish Romanticism and Polish history became one of the defining qualities of the literature of Polish Romanticism period, differentiating it from that of other countries. They had not suffered the loss of national statehood as was the case with Poland. Influenced by the general spirit and main ideas of European Romanticism, the literature of Polish Romanticism is unique, as many scholars have pointed out, in having developed largely outside of Poland and in its emphatic focus upon the issue of Polish nationalism. The Polish intelligentsia, along with leading members of its government, left Poland in the early 1830s, during what is referred to as the &quot;Great Emigration&quot;, resettling in France, Germany, Great Britain, Turkey, and the United States.

Their art featured and irrationality, fantasy and imagination, personality cults, folklore and country life, and the propagation of ideals of freedom. In the second period, many of the Polish Romantics worked abroad, often banished from Poland by the occupying powers due to their politically subversive ideas. Their work became increasingly dominated by the ideals of political struggle for freedom and their country&#x27;s sovereignty. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. There developed the idea of the &quot;poeta wieszcz&quot; (the prophet). The &quot;wieszcz&quot; (bard) functioned as spiritual leader to the nation fighting for its independence. The most notable poet so recognized was Adam Mickiewicz.

Zygmunt Krasiński also wrote to inspire political and religious hope in his countrymen. Unlike his predecessors, who called for victory at whatever price in Poland&#x27;s struggle against Russia, Krasinski emphasized Poland&#x27;s spiritual role in its fight for independence, advocating an intellectual rather than a military superiority. His works best exemplify the Messianic movement in Poland: in two early dramas, &quot;Nie-boska komedia&quot; (1835; &quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot;) and &quot;Irydion&quot; (1836; &quot;Iridion&quot;), as well as in the later &quot;Psalmy przyszłości&quot; (1845), he asserted that Poland was the Christ of Europe: specifically chosen by God to carry the world&#x27;s burdens, to suffer, and eventually be resurrected.

== Russia ==
Early Russian Romanticism is associated with the writers Konstantin Batyushkov (&quot;A Vision on the Shores of the Lethe&quot;, 1809), Vasily Zhukovsky (&quot;The Bard&quot;, 1811; &quot;Svetlana&quot;, 1813) and Nikolay Karamzin (&quot;Poor Liza&quot;, 1792; &quot;Julia&quot;, 1796; &quot;Martha the Mayoress&quot;, 1802; &quot;The Sensitive and the Cold&quot;, 1803). However the principal exponent of Romanticism in Russia is Alexander Pushkin (&quot;The Prisoner of the Caucasus&quot;, 1820–1821; &quot;The Robber Brothers&quot;, 1822; &quot;Ruslan and Ludmila&quot;, 1820; &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, 1825–1832). Pushkin&#x27;s work influenced many writers in the 19th century and led to his eventual recognition as Russia&#x27;s greatest poet. Other Russian Romantic poets include Mikhail Lermontov (&quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;, 1839), Fyodor Tyutchev (&quot;Silentium!&quot;, 1830), Yevgeny Baratynsky (&quot;Eda&quot;, 1826), Anton Delvig, and Wilhelm Küchelbecker.

Influenced heavily by Lord Byron, Lermontov sought to explore the Romantic emphasis on metaphysical discontent with society and self, while Tyutchev&#x27;s poems often described scenes of nature or passions of love. Tyutchev commonly operated with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, and the still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Baratynsky&#x27;s style was fairly classical in nature, dwelling on the models of the previous century.

==Spain==
Romanticism in Spanish literature developed a well-known literature with a huge variety of poets and playwrights. The most important Spanish poet during this movement was José de Espronceda. After him there were other poets like Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer, Mariano José de Larra and the dramatists Ángel de Saavedra and José Zorrilla, author of &quot;Don Juan Tenorio&quot;. Before them may be mentioned the pre-romantics José Cadalso and Manuel José Quintana. The plays of Antonio García Gutiérrez were adapted to produce Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s operas &quot;Il trovatore&quot; and &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;. Spanish Romanticism also influenced regional literatures. For example, in Catalonia and in Galicia there was a national boom of writers in the local languages, like the Catalan Jacint Verdaguer and the Galician Rosalía de Castro, the main figures of the national revivalist movements Renaixença and Rexurdimento, respectively.

There are scholars who consider Spanish Romanticism to be Proto-Existentialism because it is more anguished than the movement in other European countries. Foster et al., for example, say that the work of Spain&#x27;s writers such as Espronceda, Larra, and other writers in the 19th century demonstrated a &quot;metaphysical crisis&quot;. These observers put more weight on the link between the 19th-century Spanish writers with the existentialist movement that emerged immediately after. According to Richard Caldwell, the writers that we now identify with Spain&#x27;s romanticism were actually precursors to those who galvanized the literary movement that emerged in the 1920s. This notion is the subject of debate for there are authors who stress that Spain&#x27;s romanticism is one of the earliest in Europe, while some assert that Spain really had no period of literary romanticism. This controversy underscores a certain uniqueness to Spanish Romanticism in comparison to its European counterparts.

==Portugal==

Romanticism began in Portugal with the publication of the poem &quot;Camões&quot; (1825), by Almeida Garrett, who was raised by his uncle D. Alexandre, bishop of Angra, in the precepts of Neoclassicism, which can be observed in his early work. The author himself confesses (in &quot;Camões&quot;″ preface) that he voluntarily refused to follow the principles of epic poetry enunciated by Aristotle in his &quot;Poetics&quot;, as he did the same to Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ars Poetica&quot;. Almeida Garrett had participated in the 1820 Liberal Revolution, which caused him to exile himself in England in 1823 and then in France, after the Vila-Francada. While living in Great Britain, he had contacts with the Romantic movement and read authors such as Shakespeare, Scott, Ossian, Byron, Hugo, Lamartine and de Staël, at the same time visiting feudal castles and ruins of Gothic churches and abbeys, which would be reflected in his writings. In 1838, he presented &quot;Um Auto de Gil Vicente&quot; (&quot;A Play by Gil Vicente&quot;), in an attempt to create a new national theatre, free of Greco-Roman and foreign influence. But his masterpiece would be &quot;Frei Luís de Sousa&quot; (1843), named by himself as a &quot;Romantic drama&quot; and it was acclaimed as an exceptional work, dealing with themes as national independence, faith, justice and love. He was also deeply interested in Portuguese folkloric verse, which resulted in the publication of &quot;Romanceiro&quot; (&quot;Traditional Portuguese Ballads&quot;) (1843), that recollect a great number of ancient popular ballads, known as &quot;romances&quot; or &quot;rimances&quot;, in &quot;redondilha maior&quot; verse form, that contained stories of chivalry, life of saints, crusades, courtly love, etc. He wrote the novels &quot;Viagens na Minha Terra&quot;, &quot;O Arco de Sant&#x27;Ana&quot; and &quot;Helena.&quot;

Alexandre Herculano is, alongside Almeida Garrett, one of the founders of Portuguese Romanticism. He too was forced to exile to Great Britain and France because of his liberal ideals. All of his poetry and prose are (unlike Almeida Garrett&#x27;s) entirely Romantic, rejecting Greco-Roman myth and history. He sought inspiration in medieval Portuguese poems and chronicles as in the Bible. His output is vast and covers many different genres, such as historical essays, poetry, novels, opuscules and theatre, where he brings back a whole world of Portuguese legends, tradition and history, especially in &quot;Eurico, o Presbítero&quot; (&quot;Eurico, the Priest&quot;) and &quot;Lendas e Narrativas&quot; (&quot;Legends and Narratives&quot;). His work was influenced by Chateaubriand, Schiller, Klopstock, Walter Scott and the Old Testament Psalms.

António Feliciano de Castilho made the case for Ultra-Romanticism, publishing the poems &quot;A Noite no Castelo&quot; (&quot;Night in the Castle&quot;) and &quot;Os Ciúmes do Bardo&quot; (&quot;The Jealousy of the Bard&quot;), both in 1836, and the drama &quot;Camões&quot;. He became an unquestionable master for successive Ultra-Romantic generations, whose influence would not be challenged until the famous Coimbra Question. He also created polemics by translating Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; without knowing German, but using French versions of the play. Other notable figures of Portuguese Romanticism are the famous novelists Camilo Castelo Branco and Júlio Dinis, and Soares de Passos, Bulhão Pato and Pinheiro Chagas.

Romantic style would be revived in the beginning of the 20th century, notably through the works of poets linked to the Portuguese Renaissance, such as Teixeira de Pascoais, Jaime Cortesão, Mário Beirão, among others, who can be considered Neo-Romantics. An early Portuguese expression of Romanticism is found already in poets such as Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage (especially in his sonnets dated at the end of the 18th century) and Leonor de Almeida Portugal, Marquise of Alorna.

==Italy==

Romanticism in Italian literature was a minor movement although some important works were produced; it began officially in 1816 when Germaine de Staël wrote an article in the journal &quot;Biblioteca italiana&quot; called &quot;Sulla maniera e l&#x27;utilità delle traduzioni&quot;, inviting Italian people to reject Neoclassicism and to study new authors from other countries. Before that date, Ugo Foscolo had already published poems anticipating Romantic themes. The most important Romantic writers were Ludovico di Breme, Pietro Borsieri and Giovanni Berchet. Better known authors such as Alessandro Manzoni and Giacomo Leopardi were influenced by Enlightenment as well as by Romanticism and Classicism. An Italian romanticist writer who produced works in various genres, including short stories and novels (such as &quot;Ricciarda o i Nurra e i Cabras&quot;), was the Piedmontese Giuseppe Botero (1815–1885), devoting much of his career to Sardinian literature.

==South America==
Spanish-speaking South American Romanticism was influenced heavily by Esteban Echeverría, who wrote in the 1830s and 1840s. His writings were influenced by his hatred for the Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas, and filled with themes of blood and terror, using the metaphor of a slaughterhouse to portray the violence of Rosas&#x27; dictatorship.

Brazilian Romanticism is characterized and divided in three different periods. The first one is basically focused on the creation of a sense of national identity, using the ideal of the heroic Indian. Some examples include José de Alencar, who wrote &quot;Iracema&quot; and &quot;O Guarani&quot;, and Gonçalves Dias, renowned by the poem &quot;Canção do exílio&quot; (Song of the Exile). The second period, sometimes called Ultra-Romanticism, is marked by a profound influence of European themes and traditions, involving the melancholy, sadness and despair related to unobtainable love. Goethe and Lord Byron are commonly quoted in these works. Some of the most notable authors of this phase are Álvares de Azevedo, Casimiro de Abreu, Fagundes Varela and Junqueira Freire. The third cycle is marked by social poetry, especially the abolitionist movement, and it includes Castro Alves, Tobias Barreto and Pedro Luís Pereira de Sousa.
==United States==
In the United States, at least by 1818 with William Cullen Bryant&#x27;s &quot;To a Waterfowl&quot;, Romantic poetry was being published. American Romantic Gothic literature made an early appearance with Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1820) and &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; (1819), followed from 1823 onwards by the &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot; of James Fenimore Cooper, with their emphasis on heroic simplicity and their fervent landscape descriptions of an already-exotic mythicized frontier peopled by &quot;noble savages&quot;, similar to the philosophical theory of Rousseau, exemplified by Uncas, from &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. There are picturesque &quot;local colour&quot; elements in Washington Irving&#x27;s essays and especially his travel books. Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s tales of the macabre and his balladic poetry were more influential in France than at home, but the romantic American novel developed fully with the atmosphere and drama of Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1850). Later Transcendentalist writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson still show elements of its influence and imagination, as does the romantic realism of Walt Whitman. The poetry of Emily Dickinson—nearly unread in her own time—and Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; can be taken as epitomes of American Romantic literature. By the 1880s, however, psychological and social realism were competing with Romanticism in the novel.

===European influence===
The European Romantic movement reached America in the early 19th century. American Romanticism was just as multifaceted and individualistic as it was in Europe. Like the Europeans, the American Romantics demonstrated a high level of moral enthusiasm, commitment to individualism and the unfolding of the self, an emphasis on intuitive perception, and the assumption that the natural world was inherently good, while human society was filled with corruption.

Romanticism became popular in American politics, philosophy and art. The movement appealed to the revolutionary spirit of America as well as to those longing to break free of the strict religious traditions of early settlement. The Romantics rejected rationalism and religious intellect. It appealed to those in opposition of Calvinism, which includes the belief that the destiny of each individual is preordained. The Romantic movement gave rise to New England Transcendentalism, which portrayed a less restrictive relationship between God and Universe. The new philosophy presented the individual with a more personal relationship with God. Transcendentalism and Romanticism appealed to Americans in a similar fashion, for both privileged feeling over reason, individual freedom of expression over the restraints of tradition and custom. It often involved a rapturous response to nature. It encouraged the rejection of harsh, rigid Calvinism, and promised a new blossoming of American culture.

American Romanticism embraced the individual and rebelled against the confinement of neoclassicism and religious tradition. The Romantic movement in America created a new literary genre that continues to influence American writers. Novels, short stories, and poems replaced the sermons and manifestos of yore. Romantic literature was personal, intense, and portrayed more emotion than ever seen in neoclassical literature. America&#x27;s preoccupation with freedom became a great source of motivation for Romantic writers as many were delighted in free expression and emotion without so much fear of ridicule and controversy. They also put more effort into the psychological development of their characters, and the main characters typically displayed extremes of sensitivity and excitement.

The works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience, partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period.

<text>The 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup was the third edition of the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the world championship for women&#x27;s national soccer teams. It was hosted as well as won by the United States and took place from June 19 to July 10, 1999, at eight venues across the country. The tournament was the most successful FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in terms of attendance, television ratings, and public interest.

The 1999 edition was the first to field sixteen teams, an increase from the twelve in 1995, and featured an all-female roster of referees and match officials. It was played primarily in large American football venues due to expected demand following the successful 1996 Olympics women&#x27;s tournament. The average attendance was 37,319 spectators per match and the total attendance was 1.194 million, a record that stood until 2015. The tournament earned a profit of $4 million on its $30 million operating budget.

The final, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, was attended by 90,185 people, setting an international record for spectators at a women&#x27;s sporting event. The United States won the tournament by defeating China in a penalty shootout after a scoreless draw. The 5–4 shootout ended with Brandi Chastain scoring the winning penalty with her team&#x27;s fifth kick, following an earlier miss by China&#x27;s Liu Ying. Chinese forward Sun Wen and Brazilian midfielder Sissi were the joint top goalscorers of the tournament, with seven goals each.

The tournament was considered a &quot;watershed moment&quot; for women&#x27;s soccer in the U.S. that increased interest and participation in women&#x27;s soccer. A new professional league, the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association, was established following the tournament, and played three seasons before folding because of financial difficulties. The United States also hosted the next World Cup in 2003, which was played in smaller venues and ended with the host team finishing in third place.

==Background==
The 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup was the third edition of the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the international women&#x27;s championship created by FIFA following several precursor tournaments that were organized to test its feasibility. International women&#x27;s soccer had gained popularity in the 1970s, following the easing of gender sanctions by national associations, and competitions were organized between national teams, including the Mundialito and Women&#x27;s World Invitational Tournament. A FIFA-organized women&#x27;s tournament was hosted by China in 1988 and was followed by the announcement of the first FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, to be hosted by China in 1991. The tournament, which had several modified rules and was officially known as the 1st FIFA World Championship for Women&#x27;s Football for the M&amp;M&#x27;s Cup until retroactively given the World Cup moniker, was considered a success by FIFA and was followed up by the second World Cup in Sweden four years later with greater media attention but played in front of smaller crowds averaging under 4,500.

===Host selection===
The United States Soccer Federation announced their intention to bid for the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in February 1995, shortly after hosting the successful 1994 men&#x27;s World Cup. Australia and Chile both announced their intention to bid but withdrew from the process in December 1995. This left the United States as the sole applicant by the March 1996 deadline for bids. The FIFA Executive Committee officially awarded hosting rights to the United States on May 31, 1996, the same day that the 2002 men&#x27;s World Cup was jointly awarded to Japan and South Korea.

==Venues==
With the exception of the semifinals, the tournament&#x27;s 32 matches were organized into 15 doubleheaders, consisting of two matches played back-to-back in the same stadium. The semifinals were played in separate venues, but organized as doubleheaders hosted by the San Jose Clash and New England Revolution of Major League Soccer. Eight venues were used for the tournament: three on the East Coast, four on the West Coast, and one in Chicago. Most of the stadiums were American football venues with higher capacities than many of the stadiums used in the first two tournaments. At FIFA&#x27;s request, the tournament&#x27;s organizers had originally planned to use five smaller college football venues on the East Coast located in a single time zone. The final match would be staged at RFK Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C. Following the success of the inaugural women&#x27;s soccer tournament at the 1996 Summer Olympics, which had high attendances and culminated in 76,489 watching the gold medal match, the organizing committee chose to use larger stadiums instead and received 15 bids in 1997.

The eight venues and host cities were announced on November 19, 1997, including five large American football venues that were used in the 1994 men&#x27;s World Cup. The tournament final was awarded to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, which reprised its role from the 1984 Summer Olympics gold medal match and the 1994 men&#x27;s final. The opening match would be played at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, near New York City. The tournament&#x27;s organizing committee estimated that the 1999 World Cup would average an attendance of 25,000 per match, with U.S. matches and later knockout ties at near sellouts in the larger venues. Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in Landover, Maryland, serving the Washington, D.C. market, had a limited capacity of 41,000 seats because of ongoing construction during the group stage. It was later raised to 55,000 for the quarterfinals.

Two smaller venues, Civic Stadium in Portland, Oregon, and Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California, were chosen to each host several group stage matches and one quarterfinal doubleheader. For the tournament, Civic Stadium was outfitted with a temporary grass field that was laid over its artificial turf surface, which debuted during a warm-up friendly on June 6. Other venues underwent small modifications to host the tournament&#x27;s matches, including converting American football locker rooms to accommodate more teams and changing the dimensions of the playing field.

Ticket pre-sales at discounted prices began in October 1997 and over 300,000 were sold by April 1999. By early June, ticket sales had reached 500,000—setting a new record for a women&#x27;s sporting event by surpassing the NCAA women&#x27;s basketball tournament. The opening weekend&#x27;s eight matches were organized into four doubleheaders that attracted a total of 134,236 spectators, surpassing the total attendance for the 1995 World Cup; the United States–Denmark match drew a crowd of 78,972 at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, setting a new U.S. record for attendance at a women&#x27;s sporting event. That figure was later surpassed by the final, played between the United States and China at the Rose Bowl in front of a crowd of 90,185 spectators—a world record for women&#x27;s sports.

==Participating teams and officials==

===Qualification===

The 1999 Women&#x27;s World Cup had sixteen participating teams, an increase from the twelve in 1995 and the largest field in the tournament&#x27;s history. Ghana, Mexico, North Korea, and Russia all made their Women&#x27;s World Cup debuts at the 1999 tournament, with Mexico being the first Spanish-speaking country to qualify while Russia being the first Slavic country to qualify. Of the remaining twelve teams, three were returning for their second tournament; nine had participated in all three editions since 1991. The tournament&#x27;s seven best quarter-finalists also qualified for the 2000 Sydney Olympics alongside hosts Australia.

The United States was granted automatic qualification as the host. The remaining participants were determined through a series of six tournaments run by the continental confederations of world soccer from 1997 to 1998; these comprised 63 countries playing in 141 matches. FIFA allocated six berths to Europe; three to Asia; two to Africa; and one each to North America (excluding the hosts), Oceania, and South America. Another berth (for Mexico) was determined by a play-off series between the second-place finishers in the North and South American tournaments.

===Draw===
The tournament&#x27;s final draw took place on February 14, 1999, on a temporary outdoor stage at Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California. It was televised live by ESPN during the halftime of an exhibition match between the United States women&#x27;s team and the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Stars at the stadium. The United States lost the match 2–1, their first home defeat in more than 40 matches.

The draw was conducted using four pots of four teams each. The four highest-ranked teams, China, Germany, Norway, and the United States, were seeded into Pot A. The remaining pots were organized based on geographic location, with four European teams in Pot B, South America, Asia, and Oceania represented in Pot C, and North America and Africa in Pot D. The United States was placed in slot A1, separated from Canada and Mexico; similarly, China was separated from Japan and North Korea in the draw.

As a result of the restrictions in seeding and pot placement, two of the World Cup groups each contained two European teams. Group B was dubbed the &quot;group of death&quot; because it contained non-seeded Brazil, an Olympic semi-finalist, alongside Germany, Italy, and Mexico. The teams drawn in Groups C and D were switched to place China&#x27;s opening match at Spartan Stadium in San Jose, with hopes of attracting the San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s Chinese-American community.

===Squads===
Each team&#x27;s squad for the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup consisted of 20 players, the same as the 1995 tournament. The sixteen participating national associations were required to confirm their final rosters no later than June 9, 1999. Three days after the deadline, the full rosters were published by FIFA on their website. Several teams, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico, drew much of their roster from U.S. college teams. The oldest player at the tournament was Norwegian captain Linda Medalen, who turned 34 before the opening matchday, while the youngest was 16-year-old Ifeanyi Chiejine of Nigeria.

===Match officials===
The 1999 tournament was the first World Cup to feature a pool of 31 referees composed entirely of women—the result of a directive from FIFA president Sepp Blatter approved the year before. They worked in groups during matching and training and were divided between two base facilities in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. to reduce travel. Before the tournament, several coaches raised concerns over the quality of the referee pool, particularly those chosen for geographic diversity. By the end of the group stage, several coaches had complained of inconsistent fouls and offside calls. This was blamed in part on the referees being inexperienced with working in front of large crowds. In a post-tournament report, FIFA stated that the trial of all-female referees had been successful and that further development would produce better results in future tournaments.

FIFA published the final list of referees on April 13, 1999. From this list, only Ghanaian assistant referee Juliana Akuteye did not officiate at the tournament. American referee Kari Seitz was selected in June as a replacement for another official who had been denied a travel visa to the United States.


==Preparations==
The organizing committee for the 1999 tournament was led by chairwoman Donna de Varona, a former Olympian swimmer and co-founder of the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation, and president Marla Messing, an attorney and protégé of U.S. soccer president Alan Rothenberg who had helped organize the 1994 men&#x27;s World Cup in the United States. Headquartered in Century City, California, it had a $30 million budget for the tournament, a tenth of that for the men&#x27;s tournament. It was partially funded by a $2.5 million loan from the U.S. Soccer Foundation using profits from the 1994 men&#x27;s World Cup. Messing submitted the committee&#x27;s business plan for the tournament in September 1998, two days before giving birth.

The event attracted funding from several major corporate sponsors who had previously shied away from women&#x27;s soccer, including: McDonald&#x27;s, Coca-Cola, Fujifilm, Gillette, and Allstate; the companies, however, did not promote the tournament through advertising and tie-in campaigns like they did for the 1994 men&#x27;s World Cup. The tournament&#x27;s official equipment sponsor was Adidas, who supplied the match balls and other equipment. A new Women&#x27;s World Cup Trophy was commissioned for the tournament, designed by William Sawaya of Sawaya &amp; Moroni. It cost $30,000 to design and assemble the trophy. Following a bureaucratic issue that prevented it from being displayed at the February draw, it was unveiled on April 19, 1999. FIFA also organized several other business events during the tournament, including the FIFA Women&#x27;s Football Symposium and an extraordinary session of the FIFA Congress. Both took place in Los Angeles before the final.

Following the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade a few weeks before the tournament, organizers feared the Chinese team would pull out of the World Cup. However, the team played as planned and reached the final, and the presidents of the United States and China exchanged congratulatory messages. The closing of the U.S. embassy in Beijing also affected the visa process for the North Korean team and staff, as the country did not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., but their visas were approved in time for the tournament.

===Media and marketing===
All 32 matches were televised in the United States on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2, of which 26 were live broadcasts and six were tape delayed. The network also carried some matches in 70 other countries on its affiliated channels. Lifetime Television produced several documentaries and special programs for the World Cup. Eurosport broadcast most matches live across 55 countries, while local broadcasters in several countries also carried matches. The Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), the largest women&#x27;s professional sports league in the country, rescheduled several games to avoid clashing with World Cup fixtures. It also cross-promoted the tournament during its television broadcasts. Over 2,000 accredited journalists covered the event, including 950 writers, 410 photographers, and 600 broadcast personnel. Several major newspapers in the United States sent reporters to cover matches, with credentialed staff growing in number as the tournament went on, while others declined to produce content beyond wire reports.

The official slogan of the tournament was &quot;This is my game. This is my future. Watch me play.&quot; It was unveiled alongside the logo and branding in July 1997. Tickets were marketed primarily to young girls and their fathers, rather than the stereotypical &quot;soccer mom&quot;, and sold out quickly. The organizing committee sponsored and arranged training camps and other events for youth soccer players in host cities. Some of these included appearances by members of the United States team to advertise the tournament and invite players and their families to attend matches. Boy band &#x27;N Sync and pop performers B*Witched and Billie performed at the opening ceremony for the Women&#x27;s World Cup at Giants Stadium; Billie&#x27;s single &quot;Because We Want To&quot; was chosen as the tournament&#x27;s official song. Jennifer Lopez performed at the closing ceremony before the final, where she also recorded an official music video for her single &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Loud&quot;.

==Group stage==
The sixteen participating teams were organized into four groups, labeled A to D, by the final draw on February 14, 1999. The group stage consisted of 24 matches played in a round-robin format, in which each team played one match against the other three in their group. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw, and none for a defeat. The winners and runners-up from each group qualified for the first round of the knockout stage, which began with the quarter-finals on June 30, 1999.

===Group A===


Hosts and 1991 champions United States were placed in Group A alongside Denmark, who were undefeated in European qualification, Nigeria, champions of the African qualifying competition, and North Korea in their World Cup debut. The United States defeated Denmark 3–0 in the opening match, played on June 19 in front of a record 78,972 at Giants Stadium, with goals scored by Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy, and Kristine Lilly. The following day at the Rose Bowl, North Korea lost 2–1 to Nigeria by conceding goals to Mercy Akide and Rita Nwadike in the second half.

The United States hosted Nigeria at Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field for their second match. They fell behind in the second minute by conceding a goal to Nkiru Okosieme after a defensive mistake. The Americans rallied and found an equalizer in the form of an own goal scored by Ifeanyi Chiejine in the 19th minute. This initiated a 23-minute period where the home side scored six goals on their way to a 7–1 victory. North Korea earned an upset victory over Denmark in Portland, winning 3–1 with two first-half goals and another in the 73rd minute before a consolation goal by the Danes. The North Korean victory denied the United States an instant berth in the quarter-finals. It also preserved the chances for all four teams in the group to finish in the top two places and qualify for the knockout stage.

Nigeria became the first African team to advance to the quarter-finals of a Women&#x27;s World Cup with a 2–0 defeat of Denmark in their final group stage match. Nigeria&#x27;s Super Falcons took the lead with a goal by Mercy Akide in the first half and added a second by Okosieme in the 81st minute, while Denmark had a goal disallowed and was unable to finish its chances. The United States rested several of its starting players for its final group stage match against North Korea, but finished with a 3–0 victory with a goal from reserve striker Shannon MacMillan and another two scored by midfielder Tisha Venturini in the second half. The Americans finished first in Group A, with nine points, followed by Nigeria with six.



===Group B===


Group B, dubbed the tournament&#x27;s &quot;group of death&quot;, included 1995 runners-up Germany, Olympic semi-finalists Brazil, 1991 quarter-finalist Italy, and newcomers Mexico. Brazil opened the group stage with a 7–1 blowout win over Mexico at Giants Stadium, scoring the final six goals of the match after it was tied at 1–1 ten minutes in. Forward Pretinha and midfielder Sissi both scored hat-tricks, the former&#x27;s completed in stoppage time and the latter in the 50th minute. Kátia scored from a penalty kick before half-time. Italy and Germany played to a 1–1 draw the following day at the Rose Bowl, avoiding an upset for the Italians with a penalty kick scored by Bettina Wiegmann in the 61st minute to level the match.

Sissi scored twice for Brazil in their second match, a 2–0 victory against Italy in Chicago, earning the team a quarter-finals berth. Mexico was eliminated from the group in a 6–0 loss to Germany in Portland, having been outshot 43–2 and unable to force a save from German goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg until the 89th minute. Inka Grings scored a hat-trick for the Germans, including the opening and closing goals of the match, while her teammates Sandra Smisek, Ariane Hingst, and Renate Lingor each scored one goal.

Brazil and Germany played on the final matchday for first place in Group B, as the second-place team would be drawn against the United States in the quarter-finals. After conceding to Germany&#x27;s Birgit Prinz in the eighth minute, Brazil rallied from behind and took a 2–1 lead by the end of the first half on goals by Kátia and Sissi. A penalty kick, awarded to Germany in the first minute of the second half after Prinz was fouled in the box, was converted by Wiegmann to tie the match at 2–2. The Germans then took the lead on a deflected shot by Steffi Jones, but a last-minute header from substitute forward Maycon in stoppage time tied the match at 3–3. Brazil finished atop the group and would play Nigeria in the quarter-finals, while Germany advanced as the second-placed team to face the United States. Italy, who were already eliminated by the Brazil–Germany draw, defeated Mexico 2–0 at Foxboro Stadium to finish the tournament with a 1–1–1 record.



===Group C===

Reigning World Cup champions Norway were seeded into Group C, which also had 1995 quarter-finalists Japan, North American qualification champions Canada, and newcomers Russia, who qualified through the European play-offs. Canada took the lead in the 32nd minute of its opening match against Japan, played at Spartan Stadium in San Jose, but conceded to Japanese forward Nami Otake in the 64th minute and ended the match with a 1–1 draw. Norway began its defense of the World Cup title in Massachusetts with a 2–1 win over the debuting Russians, with a goal by Brit Sandaune off a 28th-minute corner kick taken by Marianne Pettersen, who scored in the 68th minute and took nine more shots; Galina Komarova scored a consolation goal for Russia in the 78th minute, one of just two shots on goal for the team during the entire match.

At Jack Kent Cooke Stadium near Washington, D.C., Norway became the first team to secure a place in the quarter-finals by winning 7–1 in a rout of Canada. Canada had tied the match at 1–1 with a goal in the 31st minute by Charmaine Hooper, but Norwegian forward Ann Kristin Aarønes, who had scored the first goal in the eighth minute, restored her team&#x27;s lead with a header in the 36th minute. Five Norwegian players scored in the second half, equaling the seven goals they scored against Canada in the first round of the 1995 tournament. Four days after their defeat to Norway, the Russians earned their first World Cup win by defeating Japan 5–0 at Portland&#x27;s Civic Stadium. The team scored four goals in the second half, including two by Olga Letyushova and three throughout the match that were assisted by captain Irina Grigorieva.

Russia qualified for the quarter-finals with a 4–1 victory over Canada at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, finishing in second place with six points. Grigorieva scored Russia&#x27;s first goal in the 54th minute and assisted on their second, the first of two goals scored by Elena Fomina; Canada had reduced the deficit to 2–1 with a goal by Charmaine Hooper in the 76th minute, but Fomina&#x27;s second in the 86th minute and a stoppage time goal from Olga Karasseva finished off the match. Norway finished unbeaten in the group stage by defeating Japan 4–0 at Soldier Field on June 26, benefiting from an early penalty kick and an own goal that were both conceded by Hiromi Isozaki; Isozaki fouled Monica Knudsen in the box in the seventh minute, leading to a penalty converted by Hege Riise a minute later, and misplayed a cross by Unni Lehn into her own goal in the 26th minute. The Norwegian team lost captain Linda Medalen and forward Ann Kristin Aarønes to injuries in the first half, but not before the latter had scored the team&#x27;s third goal. The final goal of the match was scored in the 61st minute by Dagny Mellgren, who headed in a cross produced by Lehn.



===Group D===


Group D included 1995 semi-finalists and Olympic runners-up China, 1995&#x27;s last-place team Australia, newcomers and African tournament runners-up Ghana, and previous hosts and semi-finalists Sweden. In their opening match against Sweden at Spartan Stadium in San Jose, China conceded an early goal in the second minute to Swedish defender Kristin Bengtsson. Forward Jin Yan scored the equalizer for China in the 17th minute and Liu Ailing scored the winning goal in the 69th minute. Australia and Ghana played to a 1–1 draw at Foxboro Stadium in the group&#x27;s other opening match a day later, which began with a red card shown to Ghanaian midfielder Barikisu Tettey-Quao in the 25th minute. Ghanaian goalkeeper Memunatu Sulemana made 11 saves to keep the match scoreless until the 74th minute, when Matildas captain Julie Murray scored to break the deadlock. Ghana equalized less than two minutes later with a finish by substitute Nana Gyamfuah following a rebound off Australian goalkeeper Tracey Wheeler&#x27;s save, securing a point in the group standings.

Sweden took an early lead in its second match, played against Australia at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium near Washington, D.C., with a header in the eighth minute by Jane Törnqvist off a corner kick and a tap-in goal by Hanna Ljungberg twelve minutes later. Julie Murray&#x27;s goal in the 32nd minute reduced the deficit to 2–1 at half-time, but Ljungberg scored again in the 69th minute because of a defensive error by Australia, confirming a 3–1 victory for the Swedes. Sun Wen completed a hat-trick in the first 54 minutes of China&#x27;s match against Ghana, which ended in a 7–0 victory at Portland&#x27;s Civic Stadium and clinched the team&#x27;s quarter-finals berth. Ghana lost defender Regina Ansah to a red card in the 52nd minute and three of her teammates earned three yellow cards for other fouls. The Chinese continued to score in the second half, including a pair by Zhang Ouying in the 82nd minute and at the beginning of stoppage time, while Zhao Lihong added another stoppage time goal a minute later.

China closed out its group stage by defeating Australia 3–1, extending its winning streak to three matches and outscoring its opponents 12–2. Australian forward Alicia Ferguson was sent off for a foul in the second minute, which remains the fastest red card in Women&#x27;s World Cup history. Sun Wen scored her first goal in the 39th minute and followed with a second shortly after half-time, having received passes from Zhao Lihong for both goals. Cheryl Salisbury reduced the deficit to 2–1 with her strike in the 66th minute, ending a 253-minute shutout streak for Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong. The Chinese ultimately won 3–1 after an assurance goal was scored by Liu Ying in the 73rd minute. Sweden advanced to the quarter-finals with a 2–0 victory over Ghana in Chicago, relying on two goals scored by early substitute Victoria Svensson in the 58th and 86th minutes.



==Knockout stage==
The knockout stage of the Women&#x27;s World Cup consisted of three single-elimination rounds leading to a final and a third-place playoff. Following a tie in regulation time, two 15-minute periods of extra time would be used to determine a winner. For the first time in Women&#x27;s World Cup history, the golden goal would be used during extra time to instantly decide the winner in sudden death. If the score remained tied at the end of extra time, a penalty shootout would ensue.

===Bracket===
===Quarterfinals===
The first match of a quarterfinals doubleheader at Spartan Stadium in San Jose featured China and Russia, the only team to debut at the tournament and also advance to the knockout stage. China advanced with a 2–0 victory over Russia, with goals by Pu Wei and Jin Yan, while their opponents did not manage a shot towards goal until stoppage time. The second match of the doubleheader, between neighboring rivals Norway and Sweden, began with a scoreless first half and ended with four goals scored in the second half for a 3–1 Norwegian win. Norway opened the scoring with a header by Ann Kristin Aarønes in the 51st minute, which was followed by a goal from Marianne Pettersen in the 58th minute and a penalty scored by Hege Riise in the 72nd minute; Sweden scored a consolation goal by way of a run and shot from Malin Moström in the 90th minute.

The next doubleheader, at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium near Washington, D.C., began with a match between the United States and Germany played in front of 54,642, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Chelsea Clinton. U.S. defender Brandi Chastain scored an own goal in the fifth minute after a miscommunication with goalkeeper Briana Scurry, but the Americans found an equalizing goal eleven minutes later from Tiffeny Milbrett. Germany retook the lead in first-half stoppage time on a strike by Bettina Wiegmann that beat Scurry from . Chastain redeemed herself by scoring the second equalizing goal for the U.S. in the 49th minute, finishing a corner kick that was taken by Mia Hamm. Defender Joy Fawcett&#x27;s header off a corner kick in the 66th minute proved to be the game-winning goal, allowing the United States to advance with a 3–2 defeat of the Germans.

The second match at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, featuring Brazil and Nigeria, was the first in FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup history to be decided by a golden goal in extra time. Cidinha scored twice in the first 22 minutes of the match and was joined by Nenê in the 35th minute to give Brazil a 3–0 lead at half-time. Nigeria substituted goalkeeper Ann Chiejine for Judith Chime and began pressing its attackers early in the second half. The Super Falcons scored their first goal in the 63rd minute, Prisca Emeafu taking advantage of a defensive mistake, and added a second through Nkiru Okosieme&#x27;s shot off a rebound in the 72nd minute. Nkechi Egbe scored the equalizing goal for Nigeria in the 85th minute with a far-post strike from . The goal forced sudden death extra time, which Nigeria would play with only 10 players after forward Patience Avre was ejected in the 87th minute for receiving a second yellow card. Brazilian midfielder Sissi, who had assisted two of the first-half goals, scored the golden goal from in the 104th minute to win the match 4–3 for Brazil.

The top seven quarterfinalists also qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics alongside hosts Australia, who were eliminated in the group stage. The Olympics qualification was determined by a series of tiebreakers, beginning with the margin of defeat in the quarterfinal match, followed by goals scored in the quarterfinal and group stage performance. Although Russia and Sweden both lost by two goals, the Swedes had scored in their defeat while Russia did not, leaving them as the only quarterfinalist to not qualify for the Olympics.

===Semifinals===
The semifinals played on U.S. Independence Day were organized as doubleheaders with the host Major League Soccer teams, the New England Revolution and the San Jose Clash. Both teams played regular season matches afterwards against the MetroStars and D.C. United, respectively. The United States faced Brazil at Stanford Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area in front of 73,123 spectators. The U.S. began the match with an early lead, following a mistimed catch from Brazilian goalkeeper Maravilha that allowed Cindy Parlow to score from a header in the fifth minute. Brazil responded with several shots in the second half that required goalkeeper Briana Scurry to make three major saves to preserve the lead. On a counterattack in the 80th minute, U.S. striker Mia Hamm drew a penalty kick on a foul from Brazilian captain Elane. Veteran midfielder Michelle Akers, who had stayed on despite two serious head collisions, converted the penalty kick to give the United States a 2–0 victory.

In the second semifinal, played before 28,986 attendees at Foxboro Stadium in Massachusetts, China defeated reigning champions Norway in a 5–0 rout that matched the team&#x27;s worst-ever margin of defeat. Sun Wen opened the scoring in the third minute, with a rebounded shot off a save by goalkeeper Bente Nordby. This was followed by a right-footed volley by Liu Ailing eleven minutes later off a corner kick, increasing the team&#x27;s lead to 2–0. Liu scored her second goal in the 51st minute, hitting a left-footed volley from , and Fan Yunjie scored China&#x27;s fourth goal in the 65th minute with another volley off a free kick taken by Sun. China was awarded a penalty kick in the 72nd minute for a handball in the Norwegian box. Sun converted it, scoring her seventh goal of the tournament to tie Sissi as the leading goalscorer.
----
===Third place playoff===
The third-place playoff, contested by Norway and Brazil, was the first part of a doubleheader with the final at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena kicking off in the morning. Norway had the majority of chances to score during the match, but Maravilha saved all of their shots to preserve her shutout. Pretinha had two chances to score for Brazil and take the lead, but they were denied by Norwegian goalkeeper Bente Nordby late in the second half. After remaining scoreless through regulation time and stoppage time, the match advanced straight into a penalty shootout; the standard golden goal extra time was skipped due to the constraints of television scheduling ahead of the final. Pretinha missed the opening penalty for Brazil, but the remaining five taken by her teammates were all converted; Norway lost its lead in the shootout with a miss in the third round by Silje Jørgensen, and the shootout ended 5–4 in Brazil&#x27;s favor after the sixth round following a miss by Ann Kristin Aarønes and a successful shot by Formiga.

===Final===

The 1999 final at the Rose Bowl was played in front of 90,185 spectators, claimed to be a world record for a women&#x27;s sports event, while its U.S. television broadcast averaged 17.9 million viewers and peaked at 40 million. The two finalists, the United States and China, had previously met in the gold medal match at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, which the U.S. won 2–1. With several unsuccessful attempts at the goal made by the hosts, the match was scoreless after regulation time and moved into extra time. China shot twice towards the U.S. goal in extra time, but saves by midfielder Kristine Lilly and goalkeeper Briana Scurry preserved the tie until the end of extra time.

In the ensuing penalty shootout, the first four players scored on their shots before Liu Ying had her attempt in the third round saved by Scurry. Scurry was accused of cheating by multiple media outlets because she had intentionally stepped ahead of the goal line before saving Liu&#x27;s shot, but stated that &quot;everybody does it&quot;. Lilly and Mia Hamm successfully converted their penalties and gave the Americans a lead, but Zhang Ouying and Sun Wen were able to convert theirs and keep it tied 4–4. Brandi Chastain, who had missed a penalty kick in the Algarve Cup against the Chinese months earlier, beat goalkeeper Gao Hong and won the shootout 5–4 for the United States. Chastain celebrated by removing her jersey and revealing her sports bra underneath, creating one of the most iconic moments in women&#x27;s sports history as it appeared on the covers of major magazines and newspapers.

==Aftermath and legacy==
The 1999 Women&#x27;s World Cup is regarded as a watershed moment in the history of U.S. women&#x27;s soccer because of its cultural impact and the great public interest it generated. It had a total attendance of 1.194 million spectators and averaged 37,319 per match. This remained the highest total attendance for any Women&#x27;s World Cup until 2015, which had more matches. The tournament&#x27;s merchandise sales and television ratings were especially high in the U.S., including several matches that set record for ESPN and ESPN2. The final held the record for the largest domestic television audience for a soccer match until the 2014 men&#x27;s World Cup. The organizing committee reported an estimated profit of $4 million on its $30 million operating budget, making the tournament a financial success.

The United States became the first team to win two Women&#x27;s World Cups as well as the first to simultaneously hold the World Cup and Olympic titles. The team, nicknamed the &quot;99ers&quot; and regarded as the best to have been produced by the U.S. women&#x27;s soccer program, became instant celebrities and appeared on late-night talk shows and news programs. The team went on a months-long victory tour following the final, which was originally self-organized due to a pay dispute with the United States Soccer Federation. They appeared in national advertising campaigns for several major companies. Although the team finished as silver medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics behind Norway, the U.S. team would go on to win gold medals at the three subsequent Olympics. The United States finished third at the next two editions of the Women&#x27;s World Cup and as runners-up to Japan in 2011 before winning their third World Cup title in 2015 and fourth in 2019. Several members of the 2011, 2015, and 2019 teams cited the 1999 tournament as providing inspiration during their pursuit of a professional career in the sport. Christie Rampone was the last member of the 1999 team to retire, doing so in 2017 after earning 311 caps.

The organizers and supporters of the Women&#x27;s World Cup had hoped to ride the momentum from the tournament&#x27;s popularity to form a professional women&#x27;s soccer league akin to Major League Soccer, which was established after the 1994 men&#x27;s World Cup. The Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA) was formed in January 2000 and began play in April 2001 with eight teams and the support of the United States Soccer Federation. The league&#x27;s $40 million, five-year budget lasted only one season while its attendance and television ratings struggled to meet projections and investor demands. The league played three full seasons before folding in September 2003 with losses estimated at $90 million and an average attendance of 6,667 in its final season. The league&#x27;s teams continued playing in exhibition matches, but eventually folded, while another professional league was founded in 2007 and folded after three seasons. The National Women&#x27;s Soccer League was established in 2012 and is the longest-running women&#x27;s soccer league in U.S. history, drawing on greater financial and planning support from the United States Soccer Federation.

China was originally awarded the rights to host the 2003 tournament, but the SARS outbreak forced them to withdraw as hosts. The United States stepped in to host the tournament, which was organized in three months and was used unsuccessfully to prevent the WUSA from folding. The 2003 tournament used smaller venues, including several soccer-specific stadiums built for Major League Soccer teams, and its television broadcasts competed against American football and baseball games that were scheduled at the same time. It averaged an attendance of 20,525 and ended with a victory for Germany over Sweden at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California.

==Awards==
Chinese striker Sun Wen was awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament&#x27;s best player. She also shared the Golden Shoe with Brazilian midfielder Sissi as the tournament&#x27;s joint top goalscorers with seven goals and three assists for both players. Sissi also won the Silver Ball, while American veteran Michelle Akers won the Bronze Ball. Ann Kristin Aarønes won the Bronze Shoe with four goals and one assist. China won the FIFA Fair Play Award for its disciplinary record during the tournament. The tournament&#x27;s awards were presented at the FIFA World Player of the Year ceremony on January 24, 2000, in Brussels.

===All-Star Team===
The sixteen members of the Women&#x27;s World Cup All-Star Team were announced on July 8, 1999, including seven players from China and five from the United States. It was the first all-star team to be chosen during the World Cup by FIFA officials.

==Statistics==

===Goalscorers===
A total of 123 goals were scored at the Women&#x27;s World Cup, setting a new tournament record, and averaged 3.84 per match. 74 different players scored goals, including three own goals and four hat-tricks. Sissi of Brazil and Sun Wen of China PR won the Golden Shoe award for scoring seven goals, while Ann Kristin Aarønes of Norway finished third with four goals.

<text>The 1995 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the second edition of the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, was held in Sweden and won by Norway, who became the first European nation to win the Women&#x27;s World Cup. The tournament featured 12 women&#x27;s national teams from six continental confederations. The 12 teams were drawn into three groups of four and each group played a round-robin tournament. At the end of the group stage, the top two teams and two best third-ranked teams advanced to the knockout stage, beginning with the quarter-finals and culminating with the final at Råsunda Stadium on 18 June 1995.

Sweden became the first country to host both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s World Cup, having hosted the men&#x27;s in 1958.

Australia, Canada, and England made their debuts in the competition. The tournament also hosted as qualification for the 1996 Summer Olympics, with the eight quarter-finalists being invited to the Olympics. In the second edition of the Women&#x27;s World Cup, matches were lengthened to the standard 90 minutes, and three points were awarded for a win.

==Summary==
Bulgaria was originally awarded hosting rights for the tournament, but had to relinquish the rights and FIFA ended up awarding the tournament to Sweden. About 112,000 tickets were sold for the entire tournament.

As a FIFA rules experiment, each team was allowed a two-minute time out each half.

Norway won the 1995 title, with one in four Norwegians watching the game on television. Norway&#x27;s team plane was escorted back to Oslo by two F-16s on their way to a victory celebration.

Notes
==Draw==
The draw for the group stage was held on 18 February 1995 in a public ceremony at the Elite Hotel Marina Plaza in Helsingborg, Sweden. The draw was conducted by Sepp Blatter, then the FIFA General Secretary, and assisted by Swedish internationals Tomas Brolin and Kristin Bengtsson, winners of the 1994 Guldbollen and Diamantbollen, respectively. There was no television coverage of the draw.

Group C started with back-and-forth 3–3 draw between the United States and China with the Chinese coming back from a 3–1 deficit. Denmark&#x27;s opening 5–0 win over Australia, in which Sonia Gegenhuber was sent off in the 45th minute for the Aussies, ultimately led to their securing one of the best third place runner up spots as they would lose their next two matches.

United States goalkeeper Brianna Scurry was sent off in the 88th minute of the second group game against Denmark. With all three substitutions used, U.S. manager Tony DiCicco called upon striker Mia Hamm to play goalkeeper. Hamm made two saves over eight minutes of stoppage time to secure the 2–0 win. In the other game, Angela Iannotta scored Australia&#x27;s first-ever World Cup goal, but China defeated the Matildas 4–2.

<text>The 1991 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup was the first FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the world championship for women&#x27;s national football teams. It took place in Guangdong, China from 16 to 30 November 1991. FIFA, football&#x27;s international governing body selected China as host nation as Guangdong had hosted a prototype world championship three years earlier, the 1988 FIFA Women&#x27;s Invitation Tournament. Matches were played in the provincial capital, Guangzhou, as well as in Foshan, Jiangmen and Zhongshan. The competition was sponsored by Mars, Incorporated, maker of M&amp;M&#x27;s candy. With FIFA still reluctant to bestow their &quot;World Cup&quot; brand, the tournament was officially known as the 1st FIFA World Championship for Women&#x27;s Football for the M&amp;M&#x27;s Cup.

It was won by the United States, whose captain April Heinrichs formed a forward line dubbed the &quot;Triple-Edged Sword&quot; with Carin Jennings and Michelle Akers-Stahl. Jennings was named player of the tournament while Akers-Stahl&#x27;s ten goals won the Golden Boot. The United States defeated Norway 2–1 in the final in front of a crowd of 63,000 people at Guangzhou&#x27;s Tianhe Stadium. Total attendance for the tournament was 510,000, an average per match of 19,615. In the opening match at the same stadium, Norway was defeated 4–0 by hosts China. Chinese defender Ma Li scored the first goal in Women&#x27;s World Cup history, while goalkeeper Zhong Honglian, also of China, posted the first official &quot;clean sheet&quot; in the tournament.

The 12 qualified teams were divided into three groups of four (A to C). The top two teams and the two best third-place finishers from the three groups advanced to the knockout round of eight teams. For only the first edition of the Women&#x27;s World Cup, all matches lasted only 80 minutes, instead of the typical 90, and two points were awarded for a win (both of which would change in 1995).

==Participating teams and officials==
===Qualification===

The 1991 Women&#x27;s World Cup had twelve participating teams compete in the final tournament. Each of the six FIFA confederations had at least one representative. 

==Squads==
For a list of the squads that contended for the final tournament, see &quot;1991 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup squads&quot;.

==Match officials==
For the first time in FIFA competition, six female officials were included. All functioned as lineswomen, except for Cláudia Vasconcelos who took charge of the third place play-off; becoming the first woman to referee a match sanctioned by FIFA.

==Tournament review==
FIFA&#x27;s technical report demonstrates that, after the tournament, players and officials were undecided whether to persist with 80-minute matches, or to change to 90 minutes in line with men&#x27;s football. Opinion was also divided about the suitability of using a size five football. Some teams reported difficulty in sourcing good quality equipment in the correct size.

The tournament was considered a major success in the quality of play and attendances at the games. FIFA president João Havelange wrote that:

The perceived success of the tournament was a significant factor in the subsequent inclusion of women&#x27;s football in the 1996 Summer Olympics. Sue Lopez reported that although attendances were very high, many tickets were complimentary. The &quot;novelty factor&quot; of women from foreign lands playing football also encouraged local people to attend.

==Draw==
The draw for the group stage was held on 14 September 1991 at the Tianhe Stadium in Guangzhou, China. The draw was part of a televised two-hour live show, featuring songs in both Chinese and English from the female singers Zhang Qiang (Beijing), Lin Ping (Guangzhou), Jenny Tseng (Hong Kong) and (Taiwan).

<text>Sveriges Television AB (&quot;Sweden&#x27;s Television Stock Company&quot;), shortened to SVT (), is the Swedish national public television broadcaster, funded by a public service tax on personal income set by the Riksdag (national parliament). Prior to 2019, SVT was funded by a television licence fee payable by all owners of television sets. The Swedish public broadcasting system is largely modelled after the system used in the United Kingdom, and Sveriges Television shares many traits with its British counterpart, the BBC.

SVT is a public limited company that can be described as a &quot;quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation.&quot; Together with the other two public broadcasters, Sveriges Radio and Sveriges Utbildningsradio, it is owned by an independent foundation, &quot;Förvaltningsstiftelsen för Sveriges Radio AB, Sveriges Television AB och Sveriges Utbildningsradio AB&quot;. The foundation&#x27;s board consists of 13 politicians, representing the political parties in the Riksdag and appointed by the Swedish government. The foundation in turn appoints the SVT board members.

SVT&#x27;s regulatory framework is governed by Swedish law. SVT and Sveriges Radio were originally a joint company, but since 1979 they and Sveriges Utbildningsradio are sibling companies sharing some joint services.

SVT maintained a monopoly in domestic terrestrial broadcasting from its start in 1956 until the privately held TV4 started broadcasting terrestrially in 1992. It is barred from accepting advertisements except in the case of sponsors for sporting events. Until the launch of the Swedish language satellite television channel TV3 in 1987, Sveriges Television provided the only Swedish television available to the public. SVT is still the biggest TV network in Sweden, with an audience share of 36.4 per cent.

==History==

When radio broadcasting was first organised in the 1920s in Sweden, it was decided to adopt a model similar to that of the British Broadcasting Company in the United Kingdom. Radio would be a monopoly funded by a licence fee and organised as a limited company, AB Radiotjänst (&quot;Radio Service Ltd.&quot;), owned by the radio industry and the press. The transmitters were owned by the state through Telegrafverket and the press held a monopoly on newscasts through Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå. AB Radiotjänst was one of 23 founding broadcasting organizations of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950.

Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå lost its monopoly on newscasts de jure in 1947 and de facto in 1956, but otherwise, the same model would be applied to television.

It was decided to start test transmissions of television in June 1954. The first transmissions were made on 29 October 1954 from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

In 1956 the Riksdag decided that television broadcasting should continue permanently and on 4 September Radiotjänst initiated official transmissions from the new Nacka transmitter. A television licence for those owning a television set was introduced in October of that year.
Regularly scheduled television programming began in 1957. At the same time, Radiotjänst was renamed Sveriges Radio (SR) and its ownership was changed. The state and the press would each have 40% shares, while the company itself would own 20% (in 1967, the state increased its share to 60% at the expense of the press).

In 1958, the first newscast, &quot;Aktuellt&quot;, was broadcast. During the 1960s the establishment of a second TV channel was frequently discussed. These discussions resulted in the launch of TV2 on 5 December 1969. The original channel became TV1 and it was intended that the two channels would broadcast in &quot;stimulating competition&quot; within the same company.

The first stage of the main headquarters building and TV studios for Sveriges Television called TV-huset , was inaugurated on Oxenstiernsgatan in the Östermalm district in Stockholm on 30 October 1967. The completion of the second stage of TV-huset and its official opening was on 5 December 1969, the same day as the start of operations of TV2, making it one of the largest television studios in Europe at that time.
1970 saw the start of the first regional programme, &quot;Sydnytt&quot; from Malmö. More regional news programmes were launched in 1972 and the entire country was covered by regional news programmes by 1987 when &quot;ABC&quot; from Stockholm began.

When TV2 started the news programmes were reorganised. &quot;Aktuellt&quot; was replaced by &quot;TV-nytt&quot;, which was responsible for the main 19.30 bulletin on TV1 as well as news updates on both channels. In addition, the two channels would get one &quot;commentary bulletin&quot; each. TV2&#x27;s was entitled &quot;Rapport&quot; and TV1&#x27;s was &quot;Nu&quot;.

In 1972, the news was reorganized once again. &quot;Rapport&quot; was moved to the 19.30 slot on TV2 while &quot;Aktuellt&quot; was revived, to broadcast at 18.00 and 21.00 on TV1. These timeslots would mostly stay unchanged for the following decades.

The first colour broadcast was made in 1966 , with regular colour broadcasts being introduced in 1970. Teletext started in 1978.
At the end of the 1970s, SR was reorganised. From 1 July 1979, Sveriges Radio AB became the parent company of four subsidiaries: 
* Sveriges Riksradio (RR) for national radio, 
* Sveriges Lokalradio AB (LRAB) for local radio, 
* Sveriges Utbildningsradio (UR) for educational broadcasting, and 
* Sveriges Television (SVT) for television. 
SVT would provide all television broadcasting, except for educational programming which was the responsibility of UR. The abbreviation SVT was chosen over the arguably more logical &quot;STV&quot; as that abbreviation was already occupied by Scottish Television in the EBU. The Swedish EBU membership is currently jointly held by SVT, SR and UR.

The two channels were reorganised in 1987. TV1 was renamed Kanal 1 and contained almost all programmes produced in Stockholm, while TV2 consisted of the ten regional districts and the &quot;Rapport&quot; news desk.

Broadcasting in Nicam Stereo was made permanent in 1988. This year also saw the launch of a channel called SVT World in southern Finland, broadcasting content from SVT for Swedish-speaking population of Finland. The channel, which was later renamed SVT4, was rebranded as SVT Europa in 1997 when it started broadcasting to all of Europe via satellite. Following its expansion into Asia and Africa, it was rebranded as SVT World in 2005.

In 1992, the Riksdag decided that Sveriges Radio would be reorganised once again, this time into three separate companies (with RR and LRAB merged) without a shared parent company. From 1994, they would be owned by three independent foundations. The three foundations later did only a few years later merge into one.

In 1990, the television broadcasting day would usually begin at 16.00 and end before midnight. The 1990s saw an increase in broadcasting hours, with the addition of reruns in the afternoon, a morning show, and lunchtime news bulletins. SVT also met competition from new commercial broadcasters. TV3 became the first channel to break SVT&#x27;s monopoly on television in Sweden and in 1992 the newly elected right-wing parliamentary majority allowed TV4 to start terrestrial broadcasting. TV4 soon established nationwide coverage and 1995 passed TV2 in the overall ratings to become the nation&#x27;s most-viewed channel.

In 1996, the channels were once again reorganised. The previous organisation and competition between the two channels disappeared as they became part of a single organisation. Kanal 1 and TV2 were renamed SVT1 and SVT2. The first season of &quot;Expedition: Robinson&quot; (Survivor) was shown in 1997.

The first digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasts took place in 1999. SVT started six new channels: the news channel SVT24 and five regional channels. 2000 saw the reorganisation of the news desks. &quot;Aktuellt&quot;, &quot;Rapport&quot;, and SVT24 all came under the control of one central news desk.
In 2001 a new logo and new programme schedules, among other things, were introduced. This made SVT1 the broader mainstream channel with higher ratings and SVT2 the narrower channel. The main news bulletins at 19.30 and 21.00 switched channels, with &quot;Aktuellt&quot; now shown on SVT2 and &quot;Rapport&quot; on SVT1.

The regional channels were closed at the beginning of 2002 and replaced by SVT Extra. In December 2002, a new channel known as Barnkanalen began showing children&#x27;s programmes during the day. On 24 February 2003, SVT24 and SVT Extra were renamed &quot;24&quot;, a theme channel for news and sports. Also in 2003, all the SVT channels dropped their encryption in the DTT network.

On 25 June 2003, SVT broadcast its first programme with 5.1 sound on DTT. The first 5.1 show was &quot;Allsång på Skansen&quot;. In November 2004, SVT added two audio streams that read out the translation subtitles on SVT1 and SVT2. The knowledge-oriented channel Kunskapskanalen started broadcasting in September 2004.

The switch-off of analogue transmitters started in 2005 in Gotland. By 2007 all analogue transmissions from SVT had ceased.

SVT started VODcasting several programmes in February 2006. Altogether three broadcasters competed to be the first one to VODcast in Sweden. In the end, all three started in the same week.

SVT made its first broadcasts in high-definition television during the 2006 FIFA World Cup on a channel operated in co-operation with TV4 AB. Regular high-definition broadcasting started on the SVT HD channel on 22 October 2006. The first programme was the film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, followed the next day by a 50th-anniversary tribute to television in Sweden, which was the first live entertainment programme to be broadcast in high definition in Sweden. On 25 August 2008, new logos and channel identities were introduced on the network with Barnkanalen renamed SVTB and 24 returning to its former name of SVT24, while SVT1 began carrying &quot;Regionala Nyheter&quot; (regional news bulletins) for the first time.

SVT was the host broadcaster for the 1975, 1985, 1992, 2000, 2013, 2016 and 2024 Eurovision Song Contests.

In 2018, the Riksdag voted to replace the traditional TV licensing system with a new public service fee based on personal income tax.

==Programming==
===News===

News programmes are an important part of SVT. Since 1972 there have been two main news programmes: &quot;Rapport&quot; and &quot;Aktuellt&quot; (translated &quot;Report&quot; and &quot;Current [events]&quot;, respectively). The two news programmes had completely separate organisations, meaning a lot of duplicated coverage was provided. After some co-operation in the 1990s, the two programmes were allowed to merge in 2000 with the newly created SVT24 to form a single organisation. The different programme names and identities were kept, however. Eventually, Rapport has become the main news programme, and Aktuellt will only broadcast one bulletin per day from autumn 2007.

The main national news bulletins are &quot;Rapport&quot;, broadcast at 18.00 and 19.30, and &quot;Aktuellt&quot; which reports in greater depth at 21.00. Additionally, shorter news bulletins are shown in the mornings and throughout the day on SVT1, SVT2, and SVT24. These are styled &quot;SVT Nyheter&quot;. SVT also broadcasts video news on the Internet through a service called Play Rapport.

SVT provides news programmes in various minority languages: Uutiset in Finnish, Nyhetstecken in Swedish Sign Language, and, in co-operation with NRK and Yle, Ođđasat in Northern Sami, as well as special editions of &quot;Sverige idag&quot; in Meänkieli and Romani.

There are also regional news bulletins &lt;br&gt;
– on SVT1 at 18.33 on Mondays to Fridays and 18.10 on Sundays, as well as 19.55 daily except Saturdays &lt;br&gt;
– on SVT2 at 21.46 on Mondays to Thursdays and 21.25 on Fridays

*ABC from Stockholm (Stockholm and Uppsala)
*Gävledala from Falun (Dalarna and Gävleborg)
*Mittnytt from Sundsvall (Västernorrland)
*Nordnytt from Luleå (Norrbotten)
*Östnytt from Norrköping (Östergötland, Södermanland and Gotland)
*Smålandsnytt from Växjö (Kronoberg, Kalmar and Jönköping)
*SVT Nyheter Jämtland from Östersund (Jämtland)
*SVT Nyheter Väst from Gothenburg (Västra Götaland and Halland)
*Sydnytt from Malmö (Skåne and Blekinge)
*Tvärsnytt from Örebro (Örebro and Västmanland)
*Värmlandsnytt from Karlstad (Värmland)
*Västerbottensnytt from Umeå (Västerbotten)
In November 2023, SVT joined with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and 69 media partners including Distributed Denial of Secrets and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and more than 270 journalists in 55 countries and territories to produce the &#x27;Cyprus Confidential&#x27; report on the financial network which supports the regime of Vladimir Putin, mostly with connections to Cyprus, and showed Cyprus to have strong links with high-up figures in the Kremlin, some of whom have been sanctioned. Government officials including Cyprus president Nikos Christodoulides and European lawmakers began responding to the investigation&#x27;s findings in less than 24 hours, calling for reforms and launching probes.

====Party political orientation====
A survey in 1999 claimed that 33 percent of the journalists working for SVT and SR supported the Left Party, which was about the same proportion as among journalists employed in commercial broadcasting and the print media, but significantly higher than among the general public, only 15 percent of whom supported the Left Party. Support for the Left Party, the Green Party and the Liberal Party was stronger among journalists on SVT and SR than among the general public, while the Moderate Party, the Social Democrats, and the Christian Democrats had significantly less support among SVT and SR journalists than they did among the public at large. The study nevertheless concluded that the private political opinions of the journalists had little impact on their work and that news stories are treated the same regardless of the political colour of individual journalists. It is also worth mentioning that SJF, the organisation amongst whose members the study was partly conducted, is a trade union, which could have skewed the representativity of the sample (lessening the validity of the survey) as it is possible it excluded some rightwing journalists. The University of Gothenburg also made another study during the Swedish 2006 general election, comparing SVT&#x27;s news programme &quot;Rapport&quot; to the country&#x27;s five largest newspapers. The study concluded that &quot;Rapport&quot;&#x27;s coverage of the election was the most balanced of them all.

===Entertainment===

Entertainment shows on Fridays and Saturdays are, together with popular sports, the programmes that attract the largest audiences.
*Melodifestivalen (1959–present), the Swedish national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. The final generally attracts around four million viewers.
*&quot;Expedition Robinson&quot; (1997–2004, 2009–2012), the original Swedish version of Survivor. Sveriges Television was the first network to broadcast this reality television series in 1997. The show, with a name alluding to Robinson Crusoe, was a major hit in Sweden. The show which consistently held high ratings was concluded after its seventh and final year on the network (the final season aired 2003–2004). The popular series was continued on the commercial channel TV3, but with much lower ratings. Expedition Robinson was aired in 2009 with a brand new season, but the series is/was just called &quot;Robinson&quot;, and now on the commercial channel TV4.
*&quot;På spåret&quot; (1987–present), popular entertainment show in which celebrities answer questions related to different locations. A cut down film in extremely high speed of a train journey towards the location is shown and the sooner the contestants stop it the higher the points. In later years even car journeys has been filmed that way. Humouristic and well hidden clues are given verbally during the journey. The name of the show means &quot;on the track&quot; in English. The show is one of very few Swedish original ideas. It has been syndicated in other countries as well.
*&quot;Så ska det låta&quot; (1997–present), the Swedish adaptation of &quot;The Lyrics Board&quot; which has on several occasions reached more than three million viewers.
*&quot;Allsång på Skansen&quot; (1979–present), a popular summer show features sing-alongs with Swedish folk music, broadcast live from Skansen in Stockholm. The first sing-along at Skansen was held in 1935. Radio transmissions of the event started shortly after. The sing-along at Skansen has been a tradition every summer since.
*&quot;Antikrundan&quot; (1989–present), the Swedish version of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; which has often attracted approximately two million viewers.

Sveriges Television hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 1985, 1992, 2000, 2013, 2016, and 2024, and also as a part of Sveriges Radio hosted the 1975 contest.

===Drama===
SVT produces drama in several genres and forms.
*&quot;Rederiet&quot; (1992–2002) was one of the most popular soap operas in Sweden.

===Regional programming===
Regional content is entirely solely restricted to news which is broadcast on SVT1 and SVT2. The eighteen news programmes are: ABC, Blekingenytt, Gävledala, Hallandsnytt, Jämtlandsnytt, Jönköpingsnytt, Mittnytt, Nordnytt, Smålandsnytt, Sydnytt, Tvärsnytt, Uppland, Värmlandsnytt, Västerbottensnytt, Västmanlandsnytt, Västnytt and Östnytt. The regional news programmes are broadcast on SVT1 at 18.33–18.45 on Mondays to Fridays (18.10–18.15 on Sundays), with a follow-up bulletin at 19.55–20.00. SVT2 also broadcasts regional news following &quot;Aktuellt&quot; at 21.46–21.56 on Mondays to Thursdays and 21.25–21.30 on Fridays. There are no regional news bulletins on Saturdays.

===Children===

&quot;Kalles klätterträd&quot; ran on Sveriges Television starting in 1975 and grew to become one of the most popular children&#x27;s programmes of the 1970s. The children&#x27;s strand &quot;Bolibompa&quot; was broadcast every day at 18.00 on SVT1, before moving to SVTB in August 2008.

===Foreign programming===
SVT also airs foreign programming, primarily from the United States, United Kingdom and other Nordic countries, in their original audio with Swedish subtitles, as is the case on other Nordic television channels.
The only cases in which dubbing is widespread is in programming aimed directly at children who are not expected to have learned reading skills yet. However, for some programmes, viewers may also access &#x27;talking subtitles&#x27; through their remote where someone reads the subtitles to viewers (though &#x27;talking subtitles&#x27; are not strictly in sync with the original audio as dubbing is). These same practices are also done for segments of local programmes that contain foreign language dialogue.

33% of the national first-time broadcasts consisted of foreign content in 2005. Of all acquired programming (including Swedish programming not produced by SVT) 27% came from the United States, 22% from the United Kingdom, 13% from Sweden, 13% from the other Nordic countries, 6% from France, 4% from Germany and 9% from the rest of Europe.

SVT often cooperates with the other Nordic public broadcasters via Nordvision. Thus, many Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Finnish programming air on SVT, while DR, NRK, YLE, KVF and RÚV show Swedish programmes. When there is major breaking news out of Denmark however, SVT may also source live coverage from TV2.

== Channels ==
SVT has five regular channels broadcasting to Sweden:
*SVT1 – The main channel with broad and regional content. The 10 most seen Swedish TV shows in 2006 were shown on this channel. SVT1 HD simulcasts in high definition.
*SVT2 – A channel with slightly narrower programming with an emphasis on culture, current affairs and documentaries. SVT2 HD simulcasts in high definition.
*SVT Barn (&quot;SVT Children&quot;) – Programmes for children and (pre-)teens.
*Kunskapskanalen (&quot;The Knowledge Channel&quot;) – Broadcasting debates, seminars and documentaries in cooperation with UR.
*SVT24 – Reruns of programmes from SVT1 and SVT2 in the evening and continuous news updates during the night. Shares frequency with Barnkanalen.

In addition to these channels, SVT has a special events channel called SVT Extra. It is generally unused and was (as of 2006) last used for live coverage during the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. In 2006, SVT launched a high-definition channel called SVT HD, simulcasting HD versions of programmes on the other SVT channels.

All channels, except SVT1 HD and SVT2 HD, are available in most of Sweden through the digital terrestrial television network and encrypted from Thor and Sirius satellites. Until September 2005, both SVT1 and SVT2 were available nationwide via analogue terrestrial transmitters. Cable networks are required to broadcast four SVT channels for free in either digital or analogue form.

SVT World, a mix of the SVT channels, is broadcast on satellite and worldwide via IPTV, and also as a terrestrial channel in Swedish-speaking areas of southern Finland. For rights reasons, SVT World does not show acquired material, such as movies, sports, or English language programming.

SVT1, SVT2, SVT Barn, SVT24, and Kunskapskanalen are also available through DTT on Åland and can be distributed on Finnish cable networks. In Ostrobothnia, Finland, SVT1, SVT2, SVTB and SVT24 are transmitted through DTT as pay TV to the Swedish-speaking population. The signals from the terrestrial transmitters in Sweden can be received in some areas of Denmark and Norway as well as in northernmost Finland near Sweden. With special equipment reception of Swedish terrestrial transmitters is possible even on some parts of the Finnish coast as well as the Polish and German coast closest to Sweden. Cable networks in the Nordic countries generally redistribute SVT1 and SVT2 often for an additional monthly subscription charge in addition to the subscriber&#x27;s main package. Some Nordic hotels, especially in Denmark and Norway, also offer SVT1 or SVT2 to guests.

SVT considers its website, svt.se, a channel in its own right. SVT also provides an on-demand service called SVT Play through which most of the programmes produced for SVT and aired on its channels are available. However, most non-news and non-current event programmes on SVT Play are only available for viewing in Sweden.

==Organisation==

The executive management of SVT is handled by a CEO, appointed by the board. The CEO of SVT is currently Hanna Stjärne who took over the role from Eva Hamilton in 2015. The chairman of the Board is Lars Engqvist, deputy Prime Minister of the previous Social Democratic government.

SVT is divided into eight operative programme-producing units - four of these are located in Stockholm while the other four are located around the country at regional studios and are based on the ten regional transmission areas which were merged in 2000:
*Malmö – SVT Syd (SVT Malmö and SVT Växjö)
*Gothenburg – SVT Väst (SVT Göteborg)
*Norrköping – SVT Mellansverige (SVT Falun, Dövas TV Leksand, SVT Karlstad, SVT Örebro and SVT Norrköping)
*Umeå – SVT Nord (formerly SVT Luleå, SVT Umeå and SVT Sundsvall)
These four district areas produce networked output and co-ordinate ten of the eleven regional news services broadcast daily on SVT1.

The Stockholm-based units are:
*SVT Nyheter &amp; Samhälle – national news, current affairs, documentaries and the regional news service ABC.
*SVT Sport
*SVT Fiktion – drama, entertainment, youth and children&#x27;s programming.
*SVTi – multimedia and interactive services.

===Chair of the Board of Directors===
*Lennart Sandgren, 1978–1994
*Anna-Greta Leijon, 1994–2000
*Allan Larsson, 2000–2005
* Lars Engqvist, 2005–2011
* Göran Johnsson, 2011–2014
* Anna-Karin Celsing, 2014–2020
* Kia Orback Pettersson 2020–2024
* Christina Björklund, 2024–present

===Chief executive officers===
Before Sveriges Television was formed in 1978, television broadcasting was controlled by channel controllers. Nils Erik Baehrentz was the controller between 1958 and 1968. He was succeeded by Håkan Unsgaard who became TV1&#x27;s controller in 1968 and Örjan Wallquist who became the TV2 controller in 1969.

*Magnus Faxén, 1978–1981
*Sam Nilsson, 1981–1999
*Maria Curman, 2000–2001
*Christina Jutterström, 2001–2006
*Eva Hamilton, 2006–2014
*Hanna Stjärne, 2014–present

When Sam Nilsson retired, the executive chair was split between a CEO and a Programme Officer. This position was abolished in 2007.
*Mikael Olsson, 2000–2000
*Leif Jakobsson, 2001–2007

== Share of viewing figures ==

Since the arrival of commercial television, SVT&#x27;s combined viewing share has declined steadily and digital channels have also provided competition. The commercial TV4 became the most watched station in 1995 and maintained its position until 2002, when SVT1 regained the status. TV4 became the most watched channel again 2006.

The combined viewing share of the SVT channels declined from 50% in 1997 to 40% in 2005. SVT was the most watched network in Sweden with a share of 38.3% in 2006, although all three major commercial channels attract a higher share of 15- to 24-year-olds than the two SVT channels combined.

=== Audience trust ===
A media study released in 2020 showed that trust in SVT programming polarised the audience. 80-90% of viewers who supported liberal or left-leaning parties Green Party, Swedish Social Democratic Party, Liberals, Left Party and Centre Party had high trust in SVT whereas fewer viewers who supported conservative-leaning parties Christian Democrats (60%), Moderate Party (54%) and Sweden Democrats (30%) had high trust in SVT. This meant that SVT was an issue that polarised the audience more than the former US president Donald Trump.

<doc id="335543" wikidata="Q733221" url="?curid=335543" title="European Exchange Rate Mechanism">
<text>The European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) is a system introduced by the European Economic Community on 1 January 1999 alongside the introduction of a single currency, the euro (replacing ERM 1 and the euro&#x27;s predecessor, the ECU) as part of the European Monetary System (EMS), to reduce exchange rate variability and achieve monetary stability in Europe.

After the adoption of the euro, policy changed to linking currencies of EU countries outside the eurozone to the euro (having the common currency as a central point). The goal was to improve the stability of those currencies, as well as to gain an evaluation mechanism for potential eurozone members. As of January 2025, two currencies participate in ERM II: the Danish krone and the Bulgarian lev.

==Intent and operation of the ERM II==
The ERM is based on the concept of fixed currency exchange rate margins, but with exchange rates variable within those margins. This is also known as a semi-pegged system. Before the introduction of the euro, exchange rates were based on the European Currency Unit (ECU), the European unit of account, whose value was determined as a weighted average of the participating currencies.

A grid (known as the Parity Grid) of bilateral rates was calculated on the basis of these central rates expressed in ECUs, and currency fluctuations had to be contained within a margin of 2.25% on either side of the bilateral rates (with the exception of the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo and Pound sterling, which were allowed to fluctuate by ±6%). Determined intervention and loan arrangements protected the participating currencies from greater exchange rate fluctuations.

United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey reportedly chose not to join the ERM in 1979 owing to concerns that it would benefit the German economy by preventing the Deutsche Mark from appreciating, at the expense of the economies of other countries. The UK did join the ERM in October 1990 under Chancellor John Major, in a move which at the time was largely supported by business and the press, but was forced to leave again two years later on Black Wednesday.

==Historical exchange-rate regimes for EU members==

The chart below provides a full summary of all applying exchange-rate regimes for EU members, since the European Monetary System with its Exchange Rate Mechanism and the related new common currency ECU came into being on 13 March 1979. The euro replaced the ECU 1:1 at the exchange rate markets, on 1 January 1999. Between 1979 and 1999 the D-Mark functioned as a &quot;de facto&quot; anchor for the ECU, meaning there was only a minor difference between pegging a currency against the ECU and pegging it against the D-Mark. 

The eurozone was established with its first 11 member states on 1 January 1999. The first enlargement of the eurozone, to Greece, took place on 1 January 2001, one year before the euro had physically entered into circulation. The zone&#x27;s next enlargements were with states that joined the EU in 2004, and then joined the eurozone on 1 January in the mentioned year: Slovenia (2007), Cyprus (2008), Malta (2008), Slovakia (2009), Estonia (2011), Latvia (2014), Lithuania (2015). Croatia, which joined in the EU 2013, adopted the euro in 2023.

All new EU members having joined the bloc after the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 are obliged to adopt the euro under the terms of their accession treaties. However, the last of the five economic convergence criteria, which need to be complied with in order to qualify for euro adoption, is the exchange rate stability criterion. This requires having been a member of the ERM for a minimum of two years without the presence of &quot;severe tensions&quot; for the currency exchange rate.

===Irish pound breaks parity with sterling===
To participate in the European Monetary System, Ireland chose to break the Irish pound&#x27;s parity with sterling in 1979, because the UK had decided not to participate. (The Irish Central Bank had maintained parity with sterling since the foundation of the state in 1922. &quot;It was only in the 1970s, when high inflation in the UK threatened price stability in Ireland, that alternatives were seriously considered&quot;.)

===Sterling&#x27;s forced withdrawal from the ERM===

The United Kingdom entered the ERM in October 1990, but was forced to exit the programme within two years after sterling came under major pressure from currency speculators. The ensuing crash of 16 September 1992 was subsequently dubbed &quot;Black Wednesday&quot;. There was some revision of attitude towards this event given the UK&#x27;s strong economic performance after 1992, with some commentators dubbing it &quot;White Wednesday&quot;.

Some commentators, following Norman Tebbit, took to referring to ERM as an &quot;Eternal Recession Mechanism&quot;, after the UK fell into recession in 1990. The UK spent over £6 billion trying to keep the currency within the narrow limits with reports at the time widely noting that the controversial Hungarian-American investor George Soros&#x27;s individual profit of £1 billion equated to over £12 for each man, woman and child in Britain and dubbing Soros &quot;the man who broke the Bank of England&quot;.

Britain&#x27;s membership of the ERM was also blamed for prolonging the recession at the time, and Britain&#x27;s exit from the ERM was seen as an economic failure which contributed significantly to the defeat of the Conservative government of John Major at the general election in May 1997, despite the strong economic recovery and significant fall in unemployment which that government had overseen after Black Wednesday.

===Increase of margins===
In August 1993, the margin was expanded to 15% to accommodate speculation against the French franc and other currencies.

== History of the ERM II ==
On 31 December 1998, the European Currency Unit (ECU) exchange rates of the eurozone countries were frozen and the value of the euro, which then superseded the ECU at par, was thus established.

In 1999, ERM II replaced the original ERM. The Greek and Danish currencies were part of the new mechanism, but when Greece joined the euro in 2001, the Danish krone was left at that time as the only participant member. A currency in ERM II is allowed to float within a range of ±15% with respect to a central rate against the euro. In the case of the krone, Danmarks Nationalbank keeps the exchange rate within the narrower range of ± 2.25% against the central rate of EUR 1 = DKK 7.46038.

EU countries that have not adopted the euro are expected to participate for at least two years in ERM II before joining the eurozone.

=== New EU members ===
On 1 May 2004, the ten national central banks (NCBs) of the new member countries became party to the ERM II Central Bank Agreement. The national currencies themselves were to become part of the ERM II at dates to be agreed.

The Estonian kroon, Lithuanian litas, and Slovenian tolar were included in the ERM II on 28 June 2004; the Cypriot pound, the Latvian lats and the Maltese lira on 2 May 2005; the Slovak koruna on 28 November 2005.

On 10 July 2020 it was announced that the Bulgarian lev (which had joined the EU on 1 January 2007) and Croatian kuna (which had joined the EU on 1 July 2013) would be included in the ERM II.

These states (with the exception of Bulgaria) have all since joined the eurozone, and hence left ERM II: Slovenia (1 January 2007), Cyprus (1 January 2008), Malta (1 January 2008), Slovakia (1 January 2009), Estonia (1 January 2011), Latvia (1 January 2014), Lithuania (1 January 2015), and Croatia (1 January 2023).

=== Current status ===
As of January 2025, two currencies participate in ERM II: the Danish krone and the Bulgarian lev. The currencies of Sweden (the Swedish krona), the three largest countries which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 (the Polish złoty, the Czech koruna, and the Hungarian forint), and Romania which joined on 1 January 2007 (the Romanian leu), are required to join in accordance with the terms of the applicable treaties of accession.

Sweden has voted in a referendum to stay out of the mechanism, despite being expected to join by the ECB, since Sweden has no opt-out like Denmark. EU members are required to join the ERM by the Maastricht convergence criteria.

=== Exchange rate bands ===
In theory, most of the currencies are allowed to fluctuate as much as 15% from their assigned value. In practice, however, the currency of Denmark deviates very little.

The former members of ERM II are the Greek drachma, Slovenian tolar, Cypriot pound, Estonian kroon, Maltese lira, Slovak koruna, Latvian lats, Lithuanian litas, and Croatian kuna.
