<text>A shell, in a modern military context, is a projectile whose payload contains an explosive, incendiary, or other chemical filling. Originally it was called a bombshell, contrasting with solid shells used for early rifled artillery, but &quot;shell&quot; has come to be unambiguous in a military context. A shell can hold a tracer.

All explosive- and incendiary-filled projectiles, particularly for mortars, were originally called &quot;grenades&quot;, derived from the French word for pomegranate, so called because of the similarity of shape and that the multi-seeded fruit resembles the powder-filled, fragmentizing bomb. Words cognate with &quot;grenade&quot; are still used for an artillery or mortar projectile in some European languages.

Shells are usually large-caliber projectiles fired by artillery, armoured fighting vehicles (e.g. tanks, assault guns, and mortar carriers), warships, and autocannons. The shape is usually a cylinder topped by an ogive-tipped nose cone for good aerodynamic performance, and possibly with a tapered boat tail; but some specialized types differ widely.

==Background==
Gunpowder is a low explosive, meaning it will not create a concussive, brisant explosion unless it is contained, as in a modern-day pipe bomb or pressure cooker bomb. Early grenades were hollow cast-iron balls filled with gunpowder, and &quot;shells&quot; were similar devices designed to be shot from artillery in place of solid cannonballs (&quot;shot&quot;). Metonymically, the term &quot;shell&quot;, from the casing, came to mean the entire munition.

In a gunpowder-based shell, the casing was intrinsic to generating the explosion, and thus had to be strong and thick. Its fragments could do considerable damage, but each shell broke into only a few large pieces. Further developments led to shells which would fragment into smaller pieces. The advent of high explosives such as TNT removed the need for a pressure-holding casing, so the casing of later shells only needed to contain the munition, and, if desired, to produce shrapnel. The term &quot;shell,&quot; however, was sufficiently established that it remained as the term for such munitions.

Hollow shells filled with gunpowder needed a fuse that was either impact triggered (percussion) or time delayed. 
Percussion fuses with a spherical projectile presented a challenge because there was no way of ensuring that the impact mechanism contacted the target. Therefore, ball shells needed a time fuse that was ignited before or during firing and burned until the shell reached its target.

==Early shells==
Cast iron shells packed with gunpowder have been used in warfare since at least early 13th century China. Hollow, gunpowder-packed shells made of cast iron used during the Song dynasty (960-1279) are described in the early Ming Dynasty Chinese military manual &quot;Huolongjing&quot;, written in the mid 14th century. The &quot;History of Jin&quot; 《金史》 (compiled by 1345) states that in 1232, as the Mongol general Subutai (1176–1248) descended on the Jin stronghold of Kaifeng, the defenders had a &quot;thunder crash bomb&quot; which &quot;consisted of gunpowder put into an iron container ... then when the fuse was lit (and the projectile shot off) there was a great explosion the noise whereof was like thunder, audible for more than thirty miles, and the vegetation was scorched and blasted by the heat over an area of more than half a &quot;mou&quot;. When hit, even iron armour was quite pierced through.&quot; Archeological examples of these shells from the 13th century Mongol invasions of Japan have been recovered from a shipwreck.

Shells were used in combat by the Republic of Venice at Jadra in 1376. Shells with fuses were used at the 1421 siege of St Boniface in Corsica. These were two hollowed hemispheres of stone or bronze held together by an iron hoop. At least since the 16th century grenades made of ceramics or glass were in use in Central Europe. A hoard of several hundred ceramic grenades dated to the 17th century was discovered during building works in front of a bastion of the Bavarian city of Ingolstadt, Germany. Many of the grenades contained their original black-powder loads and igniters. Most probably the grenades were intentionally dumped in the moat of the bastion before the year 1723.
 An early problem was that there was no means of precisely measuring the time to detonation reliable fuses did not yet exist, and the burning time of the powder fuse was subject to considerable trial and error. Early powder-burning fuses had to be loaded fuse down to be ignited by firing or a portfire or slow match put down the barrel to light the fuse. Other shells were wrapped in bitumen cloth, which would ignite during the firing and in turn ignite a powder fuse. Nevertheless, shells came into regular use in the 16th century, for example, a 1543 English mortar shell was filled with &quot;wildfire.&quot;
By the 18th century, it was known that if loaded toward the muzzle instead, 
the fuse could be lit by the flash through the windage between the shell and the barrel. At about this time, shells began to be employed for horizontal fire from howitzers with a small propelling charge and, in 1779, experiments demonstrated that they could be used from guns with heavier charges.

The use of exploding shells from field artillery became relatively commonplace from early in the 19th century. Until the mid 19th century, shells remained as simple exploding spheres that used gunpowder, set off by a slow burning fuse. They were usually made of cast iron, but bronze, lead, brass and even glass shell casings were experimented with. The word &quot;bomb&quot; encompassed them at the time, as heard in the lyrics of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; (&quot;the bombs bursting in air&quot;), although today that sense of &quot;bomb&quot; is obsolete. Typically, the thickness of the metal body was about a sixth of their diameter, and they were about two-thirds the weight of solid shot of the same caliber.

To ensure that shells were loaded with their fuses toward the muzzle, they were attached to wooden bottoms called &quot;sabots&quot;. In 1819, a committee of British artillery officers recognized that they were essential stores and in 1830 Britain standardized sabot thickness as a half-inch. The sabot was also intended to reduce jamming during loading. Despite the use of exploding shells, the use of smoothbore cannons firing spherical projectiles of shot remained the dominant artillery method until the 1850s.
==Modern shell==
The mid–19th century saw a revolution in artillery, with the introduction of the first practical rifled breech loading weapons. The new methods resulted in the reshaping of the spherical shell into its modern recognizable cylindro-conoidal form. This shape greatly improved the in-flight stability of the projectile and meant that the primitive time fuzes could be replaced with the percussion fuze situated in the nose of the shell. The new shape also meant that further, armour-piercing designs could be used.

During the 20th century, shells became increasingly streamlined. In World War I, ogives were typically two circular radius head (crh) – the curve was a segment of a circle having a radius of twice the shell caliber. After that war, ogive shapes became more complex and elongated. From the 1960s, higher quality steels were introduced by some countries for their HE shells, this enabled thinner shell walls with less weight of metal and hence a greater weight of explosive. Ogives were further elongated to improve their ballistic performance.

===Rifled breech loaders===
Advances in metallurgy in the industrial era allowed for the construction of rifled breech-loading guns that could fire at a much greater muzzle velocity. After the British artillery was shown up in the Crimean War as having barely changed since the Napoleonic Wars, the industrialist William Armstrong was awarded a contract by the government to design a new piece of artillery. Production started in 1855 at the Elswick Ordnance Company and the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich.

The piece was rifled, which allowed for a much more accurate and powerful action. Although rifling had been tried on small arms since the 15th century, the necessary machinery to accurately rifle artillery only became available in the mid-19th century. Martin von Wahrendorff and Joseph Whitworth independently produced rifled cannons in the 1840s, but it was Armstrong&#x27;s gun that was first to see widespread use during the Crimean War. The cast iron shell of the Armstrong gun was similar in shape to a Minié ball and had a thin lead coating which made it fractionally larger than the gun&#x27;s bore and which engaged with the gun&#x27;s rifling grooves to impart spin to the shell. This spin, together with the elimination of windage as a result of the tight fit, enabled the gun to achieve greater range and accuracy than existing smooth-bore muzzle-loaders with a smaller powder charge.

The gun was also a breech-loader. Although attempts at breech-loading mechanisms had been made since medieval times, the essential engineering problem was that the mechanism could not withstand the explosive charge. It was only with the advances in metallurgy and precision engineering capabilities during the Industrial Revolution that Armstrong was able to construct a viable solution. Another innovative feature was what Armstrong called its &quot;grip&quot;, which was essentially a squeeze bore; the 6 inches of the bore at the muzzle end was of slightly smaller diameter, which centered the shell before it left the barrel and at the same time slightly swaged down its lead coating, reducing its diameter and slightly improving its ballistic qualities.

Rifled guns were also developed elsewhere – by Major Giovanni Cavalli and Baron Martin von Wahrendorff in Sweden, Krupp in Germany and the Wiard gun in the United States. However, rifled barrels required some means of engaging the shell with the rifling. Lead coated shells were used with the Armstrong gun, but were not satisfactory so studded projectiles were adopted. However, these did not seal the gap between shell and barrel. Wads at the shell base were also tried without success.

In 1878, the British adopted a copper &quot;gas-check&quot; at the base of their studded projectiles and in 1879 tried a rotating gas check to replace the studs, leading to the 1881 automatic gas-check. This was soon followed by the Vavaseur copper driving band as part of the projectile. The driving band rotated the projectile, centered it in the bore and prevented gas escaping forwards. A driving band has to be soft but tough enough to prevent stripping by rotational and engraving stresses. Copper is generally most suitable but cupronickel or gilding metal were also used.

===Percussion fuze===
Although an early percussion fuze appeared in 1650 that used a flint to create sparks to ignite the powder, the shell had to fall in a particular way for this to work and this did not work with spherical projectiles. An additional problem was finding a suitably stable &quot;percussion powder&quot;. Progress was not possible until the discovery of mercury fulminate in 1800, leading to priming mixtures for small arms patented by the Rev Alexander Forsyth, and the copper percussion cap in 1818.

The percussion fuze was adopted by Britain in 1842. Many designs were jointly examined by the army and navy, but were unsatisfactory, probably because of the safety and arming features. However, in 1846 the design by Quartermaster Freeburn of the Royal Artillery was adopted by the army. It was a wooden fuze about 6 inches long and used shear wire to hold blocks between the fuze magazine and a burning match. The match was ignited by propellant flash and the shear wire broke on impact. A British naval percussion fuze made of metal did not appear until 1861.

====Types of fuzes====

* Percussion fuzes
** Direct action fuzes
** Graze fuzes
** Delay fuzes
** Base fuzes
* Airburst fuzes
** Time fuzes
** Proximity fuzes
** Distance measuring fuzes
** Electronic time fuzes
===Smokeless powders===

Gunpowder was used as the only form of explosive up until the end of the 19th century. Guns using black powder ammunition would have their view obscured by a huge cloud of smoke and concealed shooters were given away by a cloud of smoke over the firing position. Guncotton, a nitrocellulose-based material, was discovered by Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1846. He promoted its use as a blasting explosive and sold manufacturing rights to the Austrian Empire. Guncotton was more powerful than gunpowder, but at the same time was somewhat more unstable. John Taylor obtained an English patent for guncotton; and John Hall &amp; Sons began manufacture in Faversham. British interest waned after an explosion destroyed the Faversham factory in 1847. Austrian Baron Wilhelm Lenk von Wolfsberg built two guncotton plants producing artillery propellant, but it was dangerous under field conditions, and guns that could fire thousands of rounds using gunpowder would reach their service life after only a few hundred shots with the more powerful guncotton.

Small arms could not withstand the pressures generated by guncotton. After one of the Austrian factories blew up in 1862, Thomas Prentice &amp; Company began manufacturing guncotton in Stowmarket in 1863; and British War Office chemist Sir Frederick Abel began thorough research at Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills leading to a manufacturing process that eliminated the impurities in nitrocellulose making it safer to produce and a stable product safer to handle. Abel patented this process in 1865, when the second Austrian guncotton factory exploded. After the Stowmarket factory exploded in 1871, Waltham Abbey began production of guncotton for torpedo and mine warheads.
In 1884, Paul Vieille invented a smokeless powder called Poudre B (short for &quot;poudre blanche&quot;—white powder, as distinguished from black powder) made from 68.2% insoluble nitrocellulose, 29.8% soluble nitrocellusose gelatinized with ether and 2% paraffin. This was adopted for the Lebel rifle. Vieille&#x27;s powder revolutionized the effectiveness of small guns, because it gave off almost no smoke and was three times more powerful than black powder. Higher muzzle velocity meant a flatter trajectory and less wind drift and bullet drop, making 1000 meter shots practicable. Other European countries swiftly followed and started using their own versions of Poudre B, the first being Germany and Austria which introduced new weapons in 1888. Subsequently, Poudre B was modified several times with various compounds being added and removed. Krupp began adding diphenylamine as a stabilizer in 1888.

Britain conducted trials on all the various types of propellant brought to their attention, but were dissatisfied with them all and sought something superior to all existing types. In 1889, Sir Frederick Abel, James Dewar and W. Kellner patented (No. 5614 and No. 11,664 in the names of Abel and Dewar) a new formulation that was manufactured at the Royal Gunpowder Factory at Waltham Abbey. It entered British service in 1891 as Cordite Mark 1. Its main composition was 58% nitro-glycerine, 37% guncotton and 3% mineral jelly. A modified version, Cordite MD, entered service in 1901, this increased guncotton to 65% and reduced nitro-glycerine to 30%, this change reduced the combustion temperature and hence erosion and barrel wear. Cordite could be made to burn more slowly which reduced maximum pressure in the chamber (hence lighter breeches, etc.), but longer high pressure – significant improvements over gunpowder. Cordite could be made in any desired shape or size. The creation of cordite led to a lengthy court battle between Nobel, Maxim, and another inventor over alleged British patent infringement.

==Other shell types==

A variety of fillings have been used in shells throughout history. An incendiary shell was invented by Valturio in 1460. The carcass shell was first used by the French under Louis XIV in 1672. Initially in the shape of an oblong in an iron frame (with poor ballistic properties) it evolved into a spherical shell. Their use continued well into the 19th century.

A modern version of the incendiary shell was developed in 1857 by the British and was known as &quot;Martin&#x27;s shell&quot; after its inventor. The shell was filled with molten iron and was intended to break up on impact with an enemy ship, splashing molten iron on the target. It was used by the Royal Navy between 1860 and 1869, replacing heated shot as an anti-ship, incendiary projectile.

Two patterns of incendiary shell were used by the British in World War I, one designed for use against Zeppelins.

Similar to incendiary shells were star shells, designed for illumination rather than arson. Sometimes called lightballs they were in use from the 17th century onwards. The British adopted parachute lightballs in 1866 for 10-, 8- and 5-inch calibers. The 10-inch was not officially declared obsolete until 1920.

Smoke balls also date back to the 17th century, British ones contained a mix of saltpetre, coal, pitch, tar, resin, sawdust, crude antimony and sulphur. They produced a &quot;noisome smoke in abundance that is impossible to bear&quot;. In 19th-century British service, they were made of concentric paper with a thickness about 1/15th of the total diameter and filled with powder, saltpeter, pitch, coal and tallow. They were used to &#x27;suffocate or expel the enemy in casemates, mines or between decks; for concealing operations; and as signals.

During the First World War, shrapnel shells and explosive shells inflicted terrible casualties on infantry, accounting for nearly 70% of all war casualties and leading to the adoption of steel combat helmets on both sides. Frequent problems with shells led to many military disasters with dud shells, most notably during the 1916 Battle of the Somme. Shells filled with poison gas were used from 1917 onwards.

==Propulsion==
Artillery shells are differentiated by how the shell is loaded and propelled, and the type of breech mechanism.

===Fixed ammunition===
Fixed ammunition has three main components: the fuzed projectile, the casing to hold the propellants and primer, and the single propellant charge. Everything is included in a ready-to-use package and in British ordnance terms is called fixed quick firing. Often guns which use fixed ammunition use sliding-block or sliding-wedge breeches and the case provides obturation which seals the breech of the gun and prevents propellant gasses from escaping. Sliding block breeches can be horizontal or vertical. Advantages of fixed ammunition are simplicity, safety, moisture resistance and speed of loading. Disadvantages are eventually a fixed round becomes too long or too heavy to load by a gun crew. Another issue is the inability to vary propellant charges to achieve different velocities and ranges. Lastly, there is the issue of resource usage since a fixed round uses a case, which can be an issue in a prolonged war if there are metal shortages.

===Separate loading cased charge===
Separate loading cased charge ammunition has three main components: the fuzed projectile, the casing to hold the propellants and primer, and the bagged propellant charges. The components are usually separated into two or more parts. In British ordnance terms, this type of ammunition is called separate quick firing. Often guns which use separate loading cased charge ammunition use sliding-block or sliding-wedge breeches and during World War I and World War II Germany predominantly used fixed or separate loading cased charges and sliding block breeches even for their largest guns. A variant of separate loading cased charge ammunition is semi-fixed ammunition. With semi-fixed ammunition the round comes as a complete package but the projectile and its case can be separated. The case holds a set number of bagged charges and the gun crew can add or subtract propellant to change range and velocity. The round is then reassembled, loaded, and fired. Advantages include easier handling for larger caliber rounds, while range and velocity can easily be varied by increasing or decreasing the number of propellant charges. Disadvantages include more complexity, slower loading, less safety, less moisture resistance, and the metal cases can still be a material resource issue.

===Separate loading bagged charge===
In separate loading bagged charge ammunition there are three main components: the fuzed projectile, the bagged charges and the primer. Like separate loading cased charge ammunition, the number of propellant charges can be varied. However, this style of ammunition does not use a cartridge case and it achieves obturation through a screw breech instead of a sliding block. Sometimes when reading about artillery the term separate loading ammunition will be used without clarification of whether a cartridge case is used or not, in which case it refers to the type of breech used. Heavy artillery pieces and naval artillery tend to use bagged charges and projectiles because the weight and size of the projectiles and propelling charges can be more than a gun crew can manage. Advantages include easier handling for large rounds, decreased metal usage, while range and velocity can be varied by using more or fewer propellant charges. Disadvantages include more complexity, slower loading, less safety and less moisture resistance.

===Range-enhancing technologies ===

Extended-range shells are sometimes used. These special shell designs may be rocket-assisted projectiles (RAP) or base bleed (BB) to increase range. The first has a small rocket motor built into its base to provide additional thrust. The second has a pyrotechnic device in its base that bleeds gas to fill the partial vacuum created behind the shell and hence reduce base-drag. These shell designs usually have reduced high-explosive filling to remain within the permitted mass for the projectile, and hence less lethality.

==Sizes==


The caliber of a shell is its diameter. Depending on the historical period and national preferences, this may be specified in millimeters, centimeters, or inches. The length of gun barrels for large cartridges and shells (naval) is frequently quoted in terms of the ratio of the barrel length to the bore size, also called caliber. For example, the 16&quot;/50 caliber Mark 7 gun is 50 calibers long, that is, 16&quot;×50=800&quot;=66.7 feet long. Some guns, mainly British, were specified by the weight of their shells (see below).

Explosive rounds as small as 12.7 x 82 mm and 13 x 64 mm have been used on aircraft and armoured vehicles, but their small explosive yields have led some nations to limit their explosive rounds to 20mm (.78 in) or larger. International Law precludes the use of explosive ammunition for use against individual persons, but not against vehicles and aircraft. The largest shells ever fired during war were those from the German super-railway guns, Gustav and Dora, which were 800 mm (31.5 in) in caliber. Very large shells have been replaced by rockets, missiles, and bombs. Today the largest shells in common use are 155 mm (6.1 in).
Gun calibers have standardized around a few common sizes, especially in the larger range, mainly due to the uniformity required for efficient military logistics. Shells of 105 and 155 mm for artillery with 105 and 120 mm for tank guns are common in NATO allied countries. Shells of 122, 130, and 152 mm for artillery with 100, 115, and 125 mm for tank guns, remain in common usage among the regions of Eastern Europe, Western Asia, Northern Africa, and Eastern Asia. Most common calibers have been in use for many decades, since it is logistically complex to change the caliber of all guns and ammunition stores.

The weight of shells increases by and large with caliber. A typical 155 mm (6.1 in) shell weighs about 50 kg (110 lbs), a common 203 mm (8 in) shell about 100 kg (220 lbs), a concrete demolition 203 mm (8 in) shell 146 kg (322 lbs), a 280 mm (11 in) battleship shell about 300 kg (661 lbs), and a 460 mm (18 in) battleship shell over 1,500 kg (3,307 lbs). The Schwerer Gustav large-calibre gun fired shells that weighed between 4,800 kg (10,582 lbs) and 7,100 kg (15,653 lbs).

During the 19th century, the British adopted a particular form of designating artillery. Field guns were designated by nominal standard projectile weight, while howitzers were designated by barrel caliber. British guns and their ammunition were designated in pounds, e.g., as &quot;two-pounder&quot; shortened to &quot;2-pr&quot; or &quot;2-pdr&quot;. Usually, this referred to the actual weight of the standard projectile (shot, shrapnel, or high explosive), but, confusingly, this was not always the case.

Some were named after the weights of obsolete projectile types of the same caliber, or even obsolete types that were considered to have been functionally equivalent. Also, projectiles fired from the same gun, but of non-standard weight, took their name from the gun. Thus, conversion from &quot;pounds&quot; to an actual barrel diameter requires consulting a historical reference. A mixture of designations were in use for land artillery from the First World War (such as the BL 60-pounder gun, RML 2.5 inch Mountain Gun, 4 inch gun, 4.5 inch howitzer) through to the end of World War II (5.5 inch medium gun, 25-pounder gun-howitzer, 17-pounder tank gun), but the majority of naval guns were by caliber. After the end of World War II, field guns were designated by caliber.

==Types==

There are many different types of shells. The principal ones include:

===Armour-piercing shells===
With the introduction of the first ironclads in the 1850s and 1860s, it became clear that shells had to be designed to effectively pierce the ship armour. A series of British tests in 1863 demonstrated that the way forward lay with high-velocity lighter shells. The first pointed armour-piercing shell was introduced by Major Palliser in 1863. Approved in 1867, Palliser shot and shell was an improvement over the ordinary elongated shot of the time. Palliser shot was made of cast iron, the head being chilled in casting to harden it, using composite molds with a metal, water cooled portion for the head.

Britain also deployed Palliser shells in the 1870s–1880s. In the shell, the cavity was slightly larger than in the shot and was filled with 1.5% gunpowder instead of being empty, to provide a small explosive effect after penetrating armour plating. The shell was correspondingly slightly longer than the shot to compensate for the lighter cavity. The powder filling was ignited by the shock of impact and hence did not require a fuze. However, ship armour rapidly improved during the 1880s and 1890s, and it was realised that explosive shells with steel had advantages including better fragmentation and resistance to the stresses of firing. These were cast and forged steel.

AP shells containing an explosive filling were initially distinguished from their non-HE counterparts by being called a &quot;shell&quot; as opposed to &quot;shot&quot;. By the time of the Second World War, AP shells with a bursting charge were sometimes distinguished by appending the suffix &quot;HE&quot;. At the beginning of the war, APHE was common in anti-tank shells of 75 mm caliber and larger due to the similarity with the much larger naval armour piercing shells already in common use. As the war progressed, ordnance design evolved so that the bursting charges in APHE became ever smaller to non-existent, especially in smaller caliber shells, e.g. Panzergranate 39 with only 0.2% HE filling.

====Types of armour-piercing ammunition====
* Solid shell (&quot;shot&quot;) - a solid penetrator that uses only initial impact energy to penetrate armour
** Armour-piercing (AP) 
** Armour-piercing ballistic capped (APBC) - a shot with a cover to improve aerodynamics
** Armour-piercing capped (APC)
** Armour-piercing capped ballistic capped (APCBC)
** Armour-piercing composite rigid (APCR), also known as High-Velocity Armour-Piercing (HVAP) 
** Armour-piercing composite non-rigid (APCNR), also known as Armour-Piercing Super-Velocity (APSV) - fired from a tapering barrel
** Armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS)
** Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS)
* Hard shell with explosives – a mostly solid shell with an explosive element that detonates, after the shell has penetrated the armour using its impact velocity
** Armour-piercing high-explosive (APHE)
** Armour-piercing high-explosive tracer (APHE-T) - an APHE with tracer in base
** Semi-armour-piercing (SAP)
**Semi-armour-piercing high-explosive (SAPHE)
** Semi-armour-piercing high-explosive incendiary (SAPHEI)
** Semi-armour-piercing high-explosive incendiary tracer (SAPHEI-T)
* Indirect-penetration shell – a shell with a mechanism that is triggered upon impact to cause damage behind armour
** High-explosive anti-tank (HEAT)
** High-explosive squash head (HESH), also known as High-explosive plastic/plasticized (HEP)

===High-explosive shells===
Although smokeless powders were used as a propellant, they could not be used as the substance for the explosive warhead, because shock sensitivity sometimes caused detonation in the artillery barrel at the time of firing. Picric acid was the first high-explosive nitrated organic compound widely considered suitable to withstand the shock of firing in conventional artillery. In 1885, based on research of Hermann Sprengel, French chemist Eugène Turpin patented the use of pressed and cast picric acid in blasting charges and artillery shells. In 1887, the French government adopted a mixture of picric acid and guncotton under the name &quot;Melinite&quot;. In 1888, Britain started manufacturing a very similar mixture in Lydd, Kent, under the name &quot;Lyddite&quot;.

Japan followed with an &quot;improved&quot; formula known as &quot;shimose powder&quot;. In 1889, a similar material, a mixture of ammonium cresylate with trinitrocresol, or an ammonium salt of trinitrocresol, started to be manufactured under the name &quot;ecrasite&quot; in Austria-Hungary. By 1894, Russia was manufacturing artillery shells filled with picric acid. Ammonium picrate (known as &quot;Dunnite&quot; or explosive D) was used by the United States beginning in 1906. Germany began filling artillery shells with TNT in 1902. Toluene was less readily available than phenol, and TNT is less powerful than picric acid, but the improved safety of munitions manufacturing and storage caused the replacement of picric acid by TNT for most military purposes between the World Wars. However, pure TNT was expensive to produce and most nations made some use of mixtures using cruder TNT and ammonium nitrate, some with other compounds included. These fills included Ammonal, Schneiderite and Amatol. The latter was still in wide use in World War II.

The percentage of shell weight taken up by its explosive fill increased steadily throughout the 20th Century. Less than 10% was usual in the first few decades; by World War II, leading designs were around 15%. However, British researchers in that war identified 25% as being the optimal design for anti-personnel purposes, based on the recognition that far smaller fragments than hitherto would give a better effect. This guideline was achieved by the 1960s with the 155 mm L15 shell, developed as part of the German-British FH-70 program. The key requirement for increasing the HE content without increasing shell weight was to reduce the thickness of shell walls, which required improvements in high tensile steel.
The most common shell type is high explosive, commonly referred to simply as HE. They have a strong steel case, a bursting charge, and a fuse. The fuse detonates the bursting charge which shatters the case and scatters hot, sharp case pieces (&quot;fragments&quot;, &quot;splinters&quot;) at high velocity. Most of the damage to soft targets, such as unprotected personnel, is caused by shell pieces rather than by the blast. The term &quot;shrapnel&quot; is sometimes used to describe the shell pieces, but shrapnel shells functioned very differently and are long obsolete. The speed of fragments is limited by Gurney equations. Depending on the type of fuse used the HE shell can be set to burst on the ground (percussion), in the air above the ground, which is called air burst (time or proximity), or after penetrating a short distance into the ground (percussion with delay, either to transmit more ground shock to covered positions, or to reduce the spread of fragments). Projectiles with enhanced fragmentation are called high-explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG).

RDX and TNT mixtures are the standard chemicals used, notably Composition B and Cyclotol. The introduction of &quot;insensitive munition&quot; requirements, agreements and regulations in the 1990s caused modern western designs to use various types of plastic bonded explosives (PBX) based on RDX.

====Common====

Common shells designated in the early (i.e. 1800s) British explosive shells were filled with &quot;low explosives&quot; such as &quot;P mixture&quot; (gunpowder) and usually with a fuze in the nose. Common shells on bursting (non-detonating) tended to break into relatively large fragments which continued along the shell&#x27;s trajectory rather than laterally. They had some incendiary effect.

In the late 19th century &quot;double common shells&quot; were developed, lengthened so as to approach twice the standard shell weight, to carry more powder and hence increase explosive effect. They suffered from instability in flight and low velocity and were not widely used.

In 1914, common shells with a diameter of 6-inches and larger were of cast steel, while smaller diameter shells were of forged steel for service and cast iron for practice. They were replaced by &quot;common lyddite&quot; shells in the late 1890s but some stocks remained as late as 1914. In British service common shells were typically painted black with a red band behind the nose to indicate the shell was filled.

Common pointed shells, or CP were a type of common shell used in naval service from the 1890s – 1910s which had a solid nose and a percussion fuze in the base rather than the common shell&#x27;s nose fuze. The ogival two C.R.H. solid pointed nose was considered suitable for attacking shipping but was not armour-piercing – the main function was still explosive. They were of cast or forged (three- and six-pounder) steel and contained a gunpowder bursting charge slightly smaller than that of a common shell, a trade off for the longer heavier nose.

In British service common pointed shells were typically painted black, except 12-pounder shells specific for QF guns which were painted lead colour to distinguish them from 12-pounder shells usable with both BL and QF guns. A red ring behind the nose indicated the shell was filled.

By World War II they were superseded in Royal Navy service by common pointed capped (CPC) and semi-armour piercing (SAP), filled with TNT.

====Common lyddite====

Common lyddite shells were British explosive shells filled with Lyddite were initially designated &quot;common lyddite&quot; and beginning in 1896 were the first British generation of modern &quot;high explosive&quot; shells. Lyddite is picric acid fused at and allowed to solidify, producing a much denser dark-yellow form which is not affected by moisture and is easier to detonate than the liquid form. Its French equivalent was &quot;melinite&quot;, Japanese equivalent was &quot;shimose&quot;. Common lyddite shells &quot;detonated&quot; and fragmented into small pieces in all directions, with no incendiary effect. For maximum destructive effect the explosion needed to be delayed until the shell had penetrated its target.

Early shells had walls of the same thickness for the whole length, later shells had walls thicker at the base and thinning towards the nose. This was found to give greater strength and provide more space for explosive. Later shells had 4 c.r. heads, more pointed and hence streamlined than earlier 2 c.r.h. designs.

Proper detonation of a lyddite shell would show black to grey smoke, or white from the steam of a water detonation. Yellow smoke indicated simple explosion rather than detonation, and failure to reliably detonate was a problem with lyddite, especially in its earlier usage. To improve the detonation &quot;exploders&quot; with a small quantity of picric powder or even of TNT (in smaller shells, 3 pdr, 12 pdr – 4.7 inch) was loaded between the fuze and the main lyddite filling or in a thin tube running through most of the shell&#x27;s length.

Lyddite presented a major safety problem because it reacted dangerously with metal bases. This required that the interior of shells had to be varnished, the exterior had to be painted with leadless paint and the fuze-hole had to be made of a leadless alloy. Fuzes containing any lead could not be used with it.

When World War I began Britain was replacing lyddite with modern &quot;high explosive&quot; (HE) such as TNT. After World War I the term &quot;common lyddite&quot; was dropped, and remaining stocks of lyddite-filled shells were referred to as HE (high explosive) shell filled lyddite. Hence &quot;common&quot; faded from use, replaced by &quot;HE&quot; as the explosive shell designation.

Common lyddite shells in British service were painted yellow, with a red ring behind the nose to indicate the shell had been filled.

====Mine shell====

The mine shell is a particular form of HE shell developed for use in small caliber weapons such as 20 mm to 30 mm cannon. Small HE shells of conventional design can contain only a limited amount of explosive. By using a thin-walled steel casing of high tensile strength, a larger explosive charge can be used. Most commonly the explosive charge also was a more expensive but higher-detonation-energy type.

The &quot;mine shell&quot; concept was invented by the Germans in the Second World War primarily for use in aircraft guns intended to be fired at opposing aircraft. Mine shells produced relatively little damage due to fragments, but a much more powerful blast. The aluminium structures and skins of Second World War aircraft were readily damaged by this greater level of blast.

===Shrapnel shells===
Shrapnel shells are an anti-personnel munition which delivered large numbers of bullets at ranges far greater than rifles or machine guns could attain – up to 6,500 yards by 1914. A typical shrapnel shell as used in World War I was streamlined, 75 mm (3 in) in diameter and contained approximately 300 lead–antimony balls (bullets), each around 1/2-inch in diameter. Shrapnel used the principle that the bullets encountered much less air resistance if they travelled most of their journey packed together in a single streamlined shell than they would if they travelled individually, and could hence attain a far greater range.

The gunner set the shell&#x27;s time fuze so that it was timed to burst as it was angling down towards the ground just before it reached its target (ideally about 150 yards before, and 60–100 feet above the ground). The fuze then ignited a small &quot;bursting charge&quot; in the base of the shell which fired the balls forward out of the front of the shell case, adding 200–250 ft/second to the existing velocity of 750–1200 ft/second. The shell body dropped to the ground mostly intact and the bullets continued in an expanding cone shape before striking the ground over an area approximately 250 yards × 30 yards in the case of the US 3-inch shell. The effect was of a large shotgun blast just in front of and above the target, and was deadly against troops in the open. A trained gun team could fire 20 such shells per minute, with a total of 6,000 balls, which compared very favorably with rifles and machine-guns.

However, shrapnel&#x27;s relatively flat trajectory (it depended mainly on the shell&#x27;s velocity for its lethality, and was lethal only in the forward direction) meant that it could not strike trained troops who avoided open spaces and instead used dead ground (dips), shelters, trenches, buildings, and trees for cover. It was of no use in destroying buildings or shelters. Hence, it was replaced during World War I by the high-explosive shell, which exploded its fragments in all directions (and thus more difficult to avoid) and could be fired by high-angle weapons, such as howitzers.

===Cluster and sub-munition===
Cluster shells are a type of carrier shell or cargo munition. Like cluster bombs, an artillery shell may be used to scatter smaller sub-munitions, including anti-personnel grenades, anti-tank top-attack munitions, and landmines. These are generally far more lethal against both armour and infantry than simple high-explosive shells, since the multiple munitions create a larger kill zone and increase the chance of achieving the direct hit necessary to kill armour. Many modern armies make significant use of cluster munitions in their artillery batteries.

Artillery-scattered mines allow for the quick deployment of minefields into the path of the enemy without placing engineering units at risk, but artillery delivery may lead to an irregular and unpredictable minefield with more unexploded ordnance than if mines were individually placed.

Signatories of the Convention on Cluster Munitions have accepted restrictions on the use of cluster munitions, including artillery shells: the treaty requires that a weapon so defined must contain nine or fewer submunitions, which must each weigh more than 4 kilograms, be capable of detecting and engaging a single target, and contain electronic self-destruct and self-deactivation systems. Submunitions which weigh 20 kg or more are not restricted.

===Chemical===

Chemical shells contain just a small explosive charge to burst the shell, and a larger quantity of a chemical agent or riot control agent of some kind, in either liquid, gas or powdered form. In some cases such as the M687 Sarin gas shell, the payload is stored as two precursor chemicals which are mixed after the shell is fired. Some examples designed to deliver powdered chemical agents, such as the M110 155mm Cartridge, were later repurposed as smoke/incendiary rounds containing powdered white phosphorus.

Chemical shells were most commonly employed during the First World War. Use of chemical agents of all kinds has been forbidden by numerous international treaties starting with the 1925 Geneva Protocol (not to be confused with the Geneva Convention), with the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention being the most modern treaty which also outlaws production, stockpiling and transfer of such weapons. All signatories have renounced the use of both lethal chemical agents and incapacitating agents in warfare.

===Nuclear artillery===
Nuclear artillery shells are used to provide battlefield scale nuclear weapons for tactical use. These range from the relatively small 155 mm shell to the 406 mm shell used by heavy battleship cannon and shore defense units equipped with the same guns.

===Non-lethal shells===
Not all shells are designed to kill or destroy. The following types are designed to achieve particular non-lethal effects. They are not completely harmless: smoke and illumination shells can accidentally start fires, and impact by the discarded carrier of all three types can wound or kill personnel, or cause minor damage to property.

====Smoke====
Smoke shells are used to create smoke screens to mask movements of friendly forces or disorient enemies, or to mark specific areas. The main types are bursting (using a payload powdered chemicals) and base ejection (delivering three or four smoke canisters which are deployed from the rear of the shell prior to impact, or a single canister containing submunitions distributed via a bursting charge). Base ejection shells are a type of carrier shell or cargo munition.

Base ejection smoke is usually white, however, colored smoke has been used for marking purposes. The original canisters typically used hexachloroethane-zinc (HC), modern ones use red phosphorus because of its multi-spectral properties. However, other compounds have been used; in World War II, Germany used oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) and pumice.

Due to the nature of their payload, powder smoke shells using white phosphorus in particular have a secondary effect as incendiary weapons, though they are not as effective in this role as dedicated weapons using thermite.

==== Illumination ====

Modern illuminating shells are a type of carrier shell or cargo munition. Those used in World War I were shrapnel pattern shells ejecting small burning &quot;pots&quot;.

A modern illumination shell has a time fuze that ejects a flare &quot;package&quot; through the base of the carrier shell at a standard height above ground (typically about 600 metres), from where it slowly falls beneath a non-flammable parachute, illuminating the area below. The ejection process also initiates a pyrotechnic flare emitting white or &quot;black&quot; infrared light.
Typically illumination flares burn for about 60 seconds. These are also known as &quot;starshell&quot; or &quot;star shell&quot;. Infrared illumination is a more recent development used to enhance the performance of night-vision devices. Both white- and black-light illuminating shells may be used to provide continuous illumination over an area for a period of time and may use several dispersed aimpoints to illuminate a large area. Alternatively, firing single illuminating shells may be coordinated with the adjustment of HE shell fire onto a target.

Colored flare shells have also been used for target marking and other signaling purposes.
====Carrier====
The carrier shell is simply a hollow carrier equipped with a fuze that ejects the contents at a calculated time. They are often filled with leaflets (see external links), but can be filled with anything that meets the weight restrictions and is able to withstand the shock of firing. Famously, on Christmas Day 1899 during the siege of Ladysmith, the Boers fired into Ladysmith a carrier shell without a fuze, which contained a Christmas pudding, two Union Flags and the message &quot;compliments of the season&quot;. The shell is still kept in the museum at Ladysmith.

====Proof shot====

A proof shot is not used in combat but to confirm that a new gun barrel can withstand operational stresses. The proof shot is heavier than a normal shot or shell, and an oversize propelling charge is used, subjecting the barrel to greater than normal stress. The proof shot is inert (no explosive or functioning filling) and is often a solid unit, although water, sand or iron powder filled versions may be used for testing the gun mounting. Although the proof shot resembles a functioning shell (of whatever sort), so that it behaves as a real shell in the barrel, it is not aerodynamic as its job is over once it has left the muzzle of the gun. Consequently, it travels a much shorter distance and is usually stopped by an earth bank for safety measures.

The gun, operated remotely for safety in case it fails, fires the proof shot, and is then inspected for damage. If the barrel passes the examination, &quot;proof marks&quot; are added to the barrel. The gun can be expected to handle normal ammunition, which subjects it to less stress than the proof shot, without being damaged.

===Guided shells===

Guided or &quot;smart&quot; ammunition features some method of guiding itself post-launch, usually through the addition of steering fins that alter its trajectory in an unpowered glide. Due to their much higher cost, they have yet to supplant unguided munitions in all applications.
==Unexploded shells==
The fuze of a shell has to keep the shell safe from accidental functioning during storage, due to (possibly) rough handling, fire, etc. It also has to survive the violent launch through the barrel, then reliably function at the appropriate moment. To do this it has a number of arming mechanisms which are successively enabled under the influence of the firing sequence.
Sometimes, one or more of these arming mechanisms fail, resulting in a projectile that is unable to detonate. More worrying (and potentially far more hazardous) are fully armed shells on which the fuze fails to initiate the HE firing. This may be due to a shallow trajectory of fire, low-velocity firing or soft impact conditions. Whatever the reason for failure, such a shell is called a &quot;blind&quot; or &quot;unexploded ordnance (UXO)&quot; (the older term, &quot;dud&quot;, is discouraged because it implies that the shell &quot;cannot&quot; detonate.) Blind shells often litter old battlefields; depending on the impact velocity, they may be buried some distance into the earth, all the while remaining potentially hazardous. For example, antitank ammunition with a piezoelectric fuze can be detonated by relatively light impact to the piezoelectric element, and others, depending on the type of fuze used, can be detonated by even a small movement. The battlefields of the First World War still claim casualties today from leftover munitions. Modern electrical and mechanical fuzes are highly reliable: if they do not arm correctly, they keep the initiation train out of line or (if electrical in nature) discharge any stored electrical energy.

<text>The UEFA Super Cup is an annual super cup football match organised by UEFA and contested by the winners of the two main European club competitions: the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. The competition&#x27;s official name was originally the Super Competition, and later the European Super Cup. It was renamed the UEFA Super Cup in 1995, following a policy of rebranding by UEFA.

From 1972 to 1999, the UEFA Super Cup was contested between the winners of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League and the winners of the European/UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. After the discontinuation of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, it has been contested by the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the winners of the UEFA Cup, which was renamed the UEFA Europa League in 2009.

The current holders are Champions League winners Real Madrid, who defeated Europa League winners Atalanta 2–0 in 2024. Real Madrid are also the most successful team in the competition, having won the trophy six times.

==History==
The European Super Cup was created in 1971 by Anton Witkamp, a reporter and later sports editor of Dutch newspaper &quot;De Telegraaf&quot;. The idea came to him in a time when Dutch total football was Europe&#x27;s finest and Dutch football clubs were enjoying their golden era (especially Ajax). Witkamp was looking for something new to definitely decide which was the best team in Europe and also to further test Ajax&#x27;s team, led by their star player Johan Cruyff.

It was then proposed that the winner of the European Cup would face the winner of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. All was set for a new competition to be born. However, when Witkamp tried to get an official endorsement to his competition, the UEFA president turned it down.

The 1972 final between Ajax and Scotland&#x27;s Rangers is considered unofficial by UEFA, as Rangers were banned from European competition due to the behaviour of their fans during the 1972 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final. As a result, UEFA refused to endorse the competition until the following season. It was played in two legs and was financially supported by &quot;De Telegraaf&quot;. Ajax defeated Rangers 6–3 on aggregate and won the first (albeit unofficial) European Super Cup.

The 1973 final, in which Ajax defeated AC Milan 6–1 on aggregate, was the first Super Cup officially recognised and supported by UEFA.

Although the two-legged format was kept until 1997, the Super Cup was decided in one single match because of schedule issues (1984 and 1986) or political problems (1991). In 1974, 1981 and 1985, the Super Cup was not played at all: 1974&#x27;s competition was abandoned because Bayern Munich and Magdeburg could not find a mutually convenient date; 1981&#x27;s was abandoned when Liverpool could not make space to meet Dinamo Tbilisi; while 1985&#x27;s was abandoned due to a ban on English clubs&#x27; participation preventing Everton from playing Juventus.

In the 1992–93 season, the European Cup was renamed the UEFA Champions League and the winners of this competition would face the winners of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in the European Super Cup. In the 1994–1995 season, the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup was renamed the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. The following season, the Super Cup also renamed the UEFA Super Cup.

After the 1998–99 season, the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup was discontinued by UEFA. The 1999 Super Cup was the last one contested by the winners of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Lazio, winners of the 1998–99 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, defeated Manchester United, winners of the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League, 1–0.
Since then, the UEFA Super Cup was contested between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the winners of the UEFA Cup. The 2000 Super Cup was the first one contested by the winners of the UEFA Cup. Galatasaray, winners of the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup, defeated Real Madrid, winners of the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League, 2–1.

In the 2009–10 season, the UEFA Cup was renamed the UEFA Europa League and the winners of this competition would continue to face the winners of the Champions League in the UEFA Super Cup.

In 2013, Chelsea became the first club to contest the Super Cup as holders of all three UEFA club honours, having entered as holders of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (1998), Champions League (2012), and Europa League (2013). Manchester United shared this honour in 2017 after their Europa League win, having qualified as Cup Winners&#x27; Cup holders in 1991.

After 15 consecutive Super Cups being played at Stade Louis II in Monaco between 1998 and 2012, the Super Cup is now played at various stadiums (similar to the finals of the Champions League and the Europa League). It was started with the 2013 edition, which was played at Eden Stadium in Prague, Czech Republic.

Starting in 2014, the date of the UEFA Super Cup was moved from Friday in late August, to Tuesday in mid-August, following the removal of the August international friendly date in the new FIFA International Match Calendar.

In 2020, the Super Cup final was originally scheduled to be played at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal, on 12 August 2020. However, after the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe caused the postponements of the previous season&#x27;s club finals, the UEFA Executive Committee chose to award the rescheduled Champions League final to Portugal, and postponed the match for 24 September 2020 and relocated the stadium to Puskás Aréna, Budapest.

Following discussions with its 55 member associations on 19 August 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee decided on 25 August 2020 to use the final as a pilot match for which a reduced number of spectators, up to 30% of the capacity of the stadium, can be allowed in, and it became the first official UEFA match to have spectators since their competitions were resumed in August 2020.

==Venues==
The competition was originally played over two legs, one at each participating club&#x27;s stadium, except in exceptional circumstances. For instance, in 1991 when Red Star Belgrade were not permitted to play the leg in their native Yugoslavia due to the war which was taking place at the time, so instead Manchester United&#x27;s home leg was only played.

Since 1998, the Super Cup was played as a single match at a neutral venue. Between 1998 and 2012, the Super Cup was played at the Stade Louis II in Monaco. Since 2013 various stadiums have been used.

==Prizes==
===Trophy===

The UEFA Super Cup trophy is retained by UEFA at all times. A full-size replica trophy is awarded to the winning club. Forty gold medals are presented to the winning club and forty silver medals to the runners-up.

The Super Cup trophy has undergone several changes in its history. The first trophy was presented to Ajax in 1973. In 1977, the original trophy was replaced by a plaque with a gold UEFA emblem. In 1987, the next trophy was the smallest and lightest of all the European club trophies, weighing and measuring in height. The UEFA Champions League trophy weighs and the UEFA Europa League trophy . It was designed and manufactured at the Bertoni workshop in Milan. The new model, which is a larger version of the previous trophy, was introduced in 2006 and weighs and measures in height.

Until 2008, a team which won three times in a row or five in total received an original copy of the trophy and a special mark of recognition. Since then, the original trophy has been kept exclusively by UEFA. AC Milan, Barcelona and Real Madrid have achieved this honour, winning a total of five times each, but the Italian team is the only one which was awarded the official trophy permanently in 2007. Barcelona and Real Madrid won their fifth title in 2015 and 2022, respectively, when the policy was no longer in place.

===Prize money===
As of 2020, the fixed amount of prize money paid to the clubs is as follows:
*Runner-up: €3,800,000
*Winner: €5,000,000

==Rules==
The UEFA Super Cup is contested as a single match at a neutral venue. The match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. If the scores are level at the end of 90 minutes, the match goes straight to a penalty shoot-out to determine a winner. Before the 2023 edition, two additional 15-minute periods of extra time were played before the match went to penalties if still tied.

Each team names 23 players, 11 of which start the match. Of the 12 remaining players, a total of 5 may be substituted throughout the match. Each team may wear its first choice kit. If these clash, the previous year&#x27;s Europa League winning team must wear an alternative colour. If a club refuses to play or is ineligible to play then they are replaced by the runner-up of the competition through which they qualified. If the field is unfit for play due to bad weather, the match must be played the next day.

==Sponsorship==
The UEFA Super Cup&#x27;s sponsors are the same as the sponsors for the UEFA Champions League. The tournament&#x27;s current main sponsors are (as of the 2024–25 season):
* FedEx
* Qatar Airways
* Heineken N.V.
* Just Eat Takeaway
* Mastercard
* PepsiCo
** Gatorade
** Lay&#x27;s
* Sony
** PlayStation 5
* Bet365

Adidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball, while Macron supplies the referee kits.

Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising, even if such sponsors conflict with those of the Super Cup. Only two sponsorships are permitted per jersey, plus that of the manufacturer, at the chest and the left sleeve. Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor, or on the back, either below the squad number or between the player name and the collar.

==Tickets==
60% of the stadium capacity is reserved for the visiting clubs. The remaining seats are sold by UEFA through an online auction. There are an unlimited number of applications for tickets given out. The 5 euro administration fee is deducted from each applicant. There is no limit to the number of applications each individual can make.

<text>Lifemapper is building a species diversity map of the world. It is similar to the SETI@Home client, in that it uses a volunteer computing client running primarily on home user&#x27;s computers to correlate georeferenced biological samples with environmental models of the Earth. It is an experimental GIS, or Geographic Information System, that uses a special genetic algorithm to see if predicted rules about where a species lives match up with the species&#x27; observed natural settings. It is hoped that this technique will be able to both represent a current &quot;map&quot; of all organisms habitats on Earth as well as predict where organisms may possibly thrive or face extinction due to climate change and other ecological transformations.

<text>Distributed.net is a volunteer computing effort that is attempting to solve large scale problems using otherwise idle CPU or GPU time. It is governed by Distributed Computing Technologies, Incorporated (DCTI), a non-profit organization under U.S. tax code 501(c)(3).

Distributed.net is working on RC5-72 (breaking RC5 with a 72-bit key). The RC5-72 project is on pace to exhaust the keyspace in just under 37 years as of January 2025, although the project will end whenever the required key is found. RC5 has eight unsolved challenges from RSA Security, although in May 2007, RSA Security announced that they would no longer be providing prize money for a correct key to any of their secret key challenges. distributed.net has decided to sponsor the original prize offer for finding the key as a result.

In 2001, distributed.net was estimated to have a throughput of over 30 TFLOPS. , the throughput was estimated to be the same as a Cray XC40, as used in the Lonestar 5 supercomputer, or around 1.25 petaFLOPs.

==History==
A coordinated effort was started in February 1997 by Earle Ady and Christopher G. Stach II of Hotjobs.com and New Media Labs, as an effort to break the RC5-56 portion of the RSA Secret-Key Challenge, a 56-bit encryption algorithm that had a $10,000 USD prize available to anyone who could find the key. Unfortunately, this initial effort had to be suspended as the result of SYN flood attacks by participants upon the server.

A new independent effort, named distributed.net, was coordinated by Jeffrey A. Lawson, Adam L. Beberg, and David C. McNett along with several others who would serve on the board and operate infrastructure. By late March 1997 new proxies were released to resume RC5-56 and work began on enhanced clients. A cow head was selected as the icon of the application and the project&#x27;s mascot.

The RC5-56 challenge was solved on October 19, 1997, after 250 days. The correct key was &quot;0x532B744CC20999&quot; and the plaintext message read &quot;The unknown message is: It&#x27;s time to move to a longer key length&quot;.

The RC5-64 challenge was solved on July 14, 2002, after 1,757 days. The correct key was &quot;0x63DE7DC154F4D039&quot; and the plaintext message read &quot;The unknown message is: Some things are better left unread&quot;.

The search for Optimal Golomb Rulers (OGRs) of order 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 were completed by distributed.net on 13 October 2004, 25 October 2008, 24 February 2009, 19 February 2014, and 23 November 2022 respectively.

==Client==
&quot;DNETC&quot; is the file name of the software application which users run to participate in any active distributed.net project. It is a command line program with an interface to configure it, available for a wide variety of platforms. distributed.net refers to the software application simply as the &quot;client&quot;. , volunteers running 32-bit Windows with AMD FireStream enabled GPUs have contributed the most processing power to the RC5-72 project and volunteers running 64-bit Linux have contributed the most processing power to the OGR-28 project.

Portions of the source code for the client are publicly available, although users are not permitted to distribute modified versions themselves.

Distributed.net&#x27;s RC5-72 project is available on the BOINC client through the Moo! Wrapper.

==Development of GPU-enabled clients==
In recent years, most of the work on the RC5-72 project has been submitted by clients that run on the GPU of modern graphics cards. Although the project had already been underway for almost 6 years when the first GPUs began submitting results, as of January 2025, GPUs represent 88% of all completed work units, and complete more than 95% of all work units each day.

*NVIDIA
:In late 2007, work began on the implementation of new RC5-72 cores designed to run on NVIDIA CUDA-enabled hardware, with the first completed work units reported in November 2008. On high-end NVIDIA video cards at the time, upwards of 600 million keys/second was observed For comparison, a 2008-era high-end single CPU working on RC5-72 achieved about 50 million keys/second, representing a very significant advancement for RC5-72. As of January 2025, CUDA clients have completed almost 11% of all work on the RC5-72 project, and perform about 9% of the work each day.

*AMD / ATI
:Similarly, near the end of 2008, work began on the implementation of new RC5-72 cores designed to run on AMD FireStream-enabled hardware. Some of the products in the Radeon HD 5000 and 6000 series provided key rates in excess of 1.8 billion keys/second. As of January 2025, FireStream clients have completed over 21% of all work on the RC5-72 project. Daily production from FireStream clients has dropped below 0.5% as the majority of AMD GPU contributors now use the OpenCL client.

*OpenCL
:An OpenCL client entered beta testing in late 2012 and was released in 2013. As of January 2025, OpenCL clients have completed more than 56% of all work on the RC5-72 project, and now perform almost 86% of the work each day. No breakdown of OpenCL production by GPU manufacturer exists, as AMD, NVIDIA, and Intel GPUs all support OpenCL.

<doc id="337012" wikidata="Q3479866" url="?curid=337012" title="Vision Serpent">
<text>The Vision Serpent is an important creature in Pre-Columbian Maya mythology, although the term itself is now slowly becoming outdated.

The serpent was a very important social and religious symbol, revered by the Maya. Maya mythology describes serpents as being the vehicles by which celestial bodies, such as the sun and stars, cross the heavens. The shedding of their skin made them a symbol of rebirth and renewal.

They were so revered, that one of the main Mesoamerican deities, Quetzalcoatl, was represented as a feathered serpent. The name means &quot;Precious/feathered serpent&quot; (from Nahuatl, &quot;quetzalli&quot; is used to describe the bird, its feathers, or something precious depending on the context and &quot;coatl&quot; meaning snake or serpent.).

The Vision Serpent is thought to be the most important of the Maya serpents. &quot;It was usually bearded and had a rounded snout. It was also often depicted as having two heads or with the spirit of a god or ancestor emerging from its jaws.&quot; During Maya bloodletting rituals, participants would experience visions in which they communicated with the ancestors or gods. These visions took the form of a giant serpent which served as a gateway to the spirit realm. The ancestor or god who was being contacted was depicted as emerging from the serpent&#x27;s mouth. The vision serpent thus came to be the method in which ancestors or gods manifested themselves to the Maya. Thus for them, the Vision Serpent was a direct link between the spirit realm of the gods and the physical world.

The Vision Serpent goes back to earlier Maya conceptions and lies at the center of the world as they conceived it. &quot;It is in the center axis atop the World Tree. Essentially the World Tree and the Vision Serpent, representing the king, created the center axis which communicates between the spiritual and the earthly worlds or planes. It is through ritual that the king could bring the center axis into existence in the temples and create a doorway to the spiritual world, and with it power.&quot;

The Vision Serpent is prevalent in bloodletting ceremonies, in Maya religious practices, Maya jewelry, pottery and their architecture.

==Bloodletting rituals==

Many have attempted to explain the manifestation of the Vision Serpent in association with Maya bloodletting. One conclusion is &quot;that massive blood loss causes the brain to release an abundance of natural endorphins, which are chemically related to opiates. As the body goes into shock, a hallucinatory vision occurs.&quot; Once the actual bloodletting was over, the blood soaked ceremonial papers were burned, releasing a column of smoke. The smoke provided the perfect medium for the Vision Serpent to appear. Every major political or religious event involved bloodletting because it provided a medium by which the gods could be called upon to witness and actually participate in the ceremony. Sometimes the spirits of ancestors were also called upon to give guidance. The Hauberg Stela (A. D. 199) from the Maya Lowlands &quot;is one of the first dated monuments that depict the Vision Serpent&#x27;s connection to bloodletting&quot;. 

Lintel 25 depicts one of the bloodletting rituals. &quot;One of Shield Jaguar&#x27;s wives, is seen gazing up towards an enormous bicephalous Vision Serpent. In her left hand, she holds a bowl containing a stingray spine, an obsidian lancet, and papers spattered with blood. The Vision Serpent appears to be emanating from the bowl. From the jaws of the Vision Serpent, spews forth an ancestral Tlaloc warrior complete with spear and shield&quot;.

Lintel 17 refers to &quot;Bird Jaguars as Blood Lord of Yaxchilan&quot; and shows him preparing to draw blood from his penis with a stingray spine. Opposite Bird Jaguar is Lady Balam-Ix, who proceeds to pass coarse rope through a gouge in her tongue. The blood is being collected in the vessel near Bird Jaguar&#x27;s feet. The Vision Serpent&#x27;s mouth is green and, the trickles of blood characteristic of bloodletting are red&quot;.

Lintel 15 depicts the appearance of this Vision Serpent. &quot;The serpent can be seen rising out of the bowl with trickles of blood along a column of blood scrolls. This lintel shows the queen of Yaxchilan involved in a visionary experience following an elaborate bloodletting ceremony. She holds the ritual paraphernalia in her arms while the vision serpent rises from a bowl of blood stained paper.&quot;

==Maya religious rites==
There was a Vision Serpent named Och-Kan, lord of Kalak&#x27;mul.

One of the most common rituals associated with the Vision serpent involved invoking ancestral spirits. Especially during coronation rites, the kings would contact the spirits for guidance and blessings. It is the Vision Serpent who provides the medium for contacting these deities.

It is believed that Lord Pakal&#x27;s sarcophagus lid, which was located at Palenque, is probably “the single most comprehensive image which relates the Vision Serpent to Maya religion.” It depicts the death of Pakal and his descent into the Underworld. “The bicepalous serpent bar is placed horizontally on the World Tree and is the conduit for this transition. In the same way that the Vision Serpent represents a conduit between the physical world and the spirit realm of the ancestors, this bicephalous serpent bar represents a conduit between the realm of the living and the realm of the dead.” 

==Maya jewelry and pottery==
A piece of Maya jewelry depicts an “anthropomorphic, bicephalous serpent.” It is believed to have been worn during a bloodletting ceremony. It clearly shows the arrival of an ancestor from the spirit realm.

The portrayal of the Vision Serpent was very prevalent in Maya pottery. Vessels used during bloodletting ceremonies, depict the Vision serpent. The vessels below are excellent examples. They are carved in stone and are “some of the earliest depiction of Vision Serpent iconography. Blood spews forth from the open jaws of the front head. Although the rear is not physically attached, it sits just above the serpent&#x27;s tail and also represents blood”.

==Maya architectural motifs==
The Vision Serpent also finds a place in Maya architecture and is especially prominent in the decoration of pillars on the interior and exterior of Maya temples.

”In the palace at Labna, serpents adorn the corners of the principle facade. Characteristic of the Vision Serpent, there appears to be either an anthropomorphic deity or the spirit of an ancestor emanating from the gaping jaws of the serpent&#x27;s mouth”.

==Contemporary observances==
Remnants of the Vision Serpent have survived until modern times. Around 1930, J.E.S. Thompson noted in San Antonio, Belize, that the Q&#x27;eqchi&#x27; Maya still performed a ritual very similar to the vision quest of the classic Maya, although in a different context. The ritual marked the initiation of a new shaman for the village. The participant came into direct contact with a giant serpent, Ochan (Och-Kan). It was through this experience that he completed his initiation rites and gained the knowledge that is needed to become a powerful shaman.

<text>John Knowles (; September 16, 1926November 29, 2001) was an American novelist best known for &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; (1959).

==Biography==
Knowles was born on September 16, 1926, in Fairmont, West Virginia, the son of James M. Knowles, a purchasing agent from Lowell, Massachusetts, and Mary Beatrice Shea Knowles from Concord, New Hampshire. His father was a coal company executive, which earned an income that afforded the family a comfortable living. As a youth, Knowles would remark that he could write just as well as the stories from &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;.

Knowles attended St. Peter&#x27;s High School in Fairmont from 1938 to 1940, before he continued at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, and graduated in 1945. Following his time at Phillips Exeter, Knowles spent eight months serving in the US Army Air Forces at the end of World War II.

Knowles graduated from Yale University as a member of the class of 1949. At Yale, Knowles contributed stories to campus humor magazine &quot;The Yale Record&quot; and served on the board of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; during his sophomore, junior, and senior years, notably as editorial secretary during his senior year. He was a record-holding varsity swimmer during his sophomore year. 

Early in his career, Knowles wrote for the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; and was assistant editor for &quot;Holiday&quot; magazine. With encouragement from Thornton Wilder, he concurrently began writing novels.

Knowles died on November 29, 2001, near Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

==&quot;A Separate Peace&quot;==

&quot;A Separate Peace&quot; was first published in London by Secker and Warburg in 1959. Published in New York in 1960 by Macmillan, it is his most celebrated work.

The novel is based upon Knowles&#x27;s experiences at Phillips Exeter Academy. The Devon School, the book&#x27;s setting, is a thinly-veiled fictionalization of Exeter, with both campus and town easily recognizable. Although the plot is not autobiographical, elements of the novel stem from personal experience, including Knowles&#x27;s membership in a secret society and his suffering a foot injury while he jumped from a tree during society exercises. In his essay &quot;A Special Time, A Special Place,&quot; Knowles wrote, &quot;The only elements in &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; which were not in that summer were anger, violence, and hatred. There was only friendship, athleticism, and loyalty.&quot;

The secondary character Finny (Phineas) is the friend of the main character Gene. Knowles has stated that he modeled Finny on David Hackett from Milton Academy, whom he met when both attended a summer session at Phillips Exeter Academy. Hackett was a friend of Robert F. Kennedy under whom he later served in the US Justice Department. A student, Phineas Sprague, lived in the same dormitory as Knowles during the summer session of 1943 and may have inspired the character&#x27;s name.

In his memoir &quot;Palimpsest&quot;, Gore Vidal acknowledged that he and Knowles simultaneously attended Phillips Exeter Academy, though Vidal was two years ahead of Knowles. Vidal stated that Knowles told him the character Brinker was based on him. &quot;We have been friends for many years now,&quot; Vidal said, &quot;and I admire the novel that he based on our school days, &quot;A Separate Peace&quot;.&quot;

==Awards==
Knowles won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction and the Rosenthal Award of the National Institute of Arts and Letters.

<text>Robert Todd Lincoln (August 1, 1843 – July 26, 1926) was an American lawyer and businessman. The eldest son of President Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln, he was the only one of their four children to survive past the teenage years and also the only to outlive both parents. Robert Lincoln became a business lawyer and company president, and served as both United States Secretary of War (1881–1885) and the U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain (1889–1893).

Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois, and graduated from Harvard College. He then served on the staff of General Ulysses S. Grant as a captain in the Union Army in the closing days of the American Civil War. After the war was over, he married Mary Eunice Harlan, and they had three children together. Following completion of his law school studies in Chicago, he built a successful law practice, and became wealthy representing corporate clients.

Lincoln was often spoken of as a possible candidate for national office, including the presidency, but never took steps to mount a campaign. He served as Secretary of War in the administration of James A. Garfield, continuing under Chester A. Arthur, and as Minister to Great Britain in the Benjamin Harrison administration.

Lincoln became general counsel of the Pullman Company, and after founder George Pullman died in 1897, Lincoln assumed the company&#x27;s presidency. After retiring from this position in 1911, Lincoln served as chairman of the board until 1924. In Lincoln&#x27;s later years, he resided at homes in Washington, D.C., and Manchester, Vermont; the Manchester home, Hildene, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. In 1922, he took part in the dedication ceremonies for the Lincoln Memorial. Lincoln died at Hildene in July 1926, at age 82, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Early life==
Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois, on August 1, 1843, to Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln. He had three younger brothers, Edward, William, and Tad. By the time Lincoln was born, his father had become a well-known member of the Whig political party and had served as a member of the Illinois state legislature for four terms. He was named after his maternal grandfather, Robert Smith Todd.

Some commentators believe that Robert Lincoln had a distant relationship with his father, in part because, during his formative years, Abraham Lincoln spent months on the judicial circuit. Lincoln recalled, &quot;During my childhood and early youth he was almost constantly away from home, attending court or making political speeches.&quot;
Abraham apparently realized that his being away had a potential impact on his sons as evidenced by the following quote from his April 16, 1848, letter to his wife: &quot;don&#x27;t let the blessed fellows forget Father&quot;. One such example that gives insight into Robert&#x27;s childhood in general was related by Joseph Humphreys, who had taken a train to Lexington, Kentucky, in 1847: &quot;there were two lively youngsters on board who kept the whole train in a turmoil, and their long-legged father, instead of spanking the brats, looked pleased as Punch and aided and abetted the older one in mischief&quot;.

Lincoln took the Harvard College entrance examination in 1859, but failed fifteen out of the sixteen subjects. Subsequently, Lincoln was enrolled at Phillips Exeter Academy to prepare for college; he graduated Phillips Exeter in 1860. Admitted to Harvard, he graduated in 1864, having been elected vice-president of the Hasty Pudding Club, and was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon (Alpha chapter) fraternity. Welsh author Jan Morris wrote that Robert Lincoln, &quot;having failed fifteen out of sixteen subjects in the Harvard entrance examination, got in at last and emerged an unsympathetic bore.&quot;

==Civil War years==
After graduating from Harvard, Robert Lincoln enrolled at Harvard Law School. Lincoln attended Harvard Law School from September 1864 to January 1865, but left after four months in order to join the Union Army. In 1893, Harvard awarded Lincoln the honorary degree of LL.D.

Mary Todd Lincoln prevented Robert Lincoln from joining the Army until shortly before the war&#x27;s conclusion. President Lincoln argued &quot;our son is not more dear to us than the sons of other people are to their mothers.&quot; In January 1865, the First Lady gave in and President Lincoln wrote Ulysses Grant, asking if Robert could be placed on his staff.

On February 11, 1865, Lincoln was commissioned as an assistant adjutant with a captain&#x27;s rank. He served in the last weeks of the American Civil War on General Grant&#x27;s staff, a status which meant, in all likelihood, he would not be involved in actual combat. He was present at Appomattox when Robert E. Lee surrendered. He resigned his commission on June 12, 1865, and returned to civilian life.

Lincoln was once saved from possible serious injury or death by Edwin Booth, whose brother, John Wilkes Booth, assassinated Robert&#x27;s father. This event took place on a train platform in Jersey City, New Jersey. The exact date is uncertain, but it is believed to have taken place in late 1863 or early 1864, before John Wilkes Booth&#x27;s assassination of President Lincoln. In a letter written in 1909 to the editor of &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;, Robert Lincoln recalled what had happened that day:

Months afterwards, while serving on Grant&#x27;s US Army staff, Robert Lincoln recalled the occurrence to Colonel Adam Badeau, a fellow officer who happened to be a friend of Edwin Booth&#x27;s. Badeau sent a letter to Booth, complimenting the actor for his heroism. Before receiving the letter, Booth had been unaware that the man whose life he had saved on the train platform was the president&#x27;s son. The knowledge of whom he had saved that day was said to have been of some comfort to Booth following his brother&#x27;s assassination of the president. Grant also sent Booth a letter of gratitude for his action.

On the night his father was assassinated, Robert had turned down an invitation to accompany the Lincolns to Ford&#x27;s Theatre due to fatigue after spending much of his recent time in a covered wagon at the battlefront. Ten days later, Robert Lincoln wrote President Andrew Johnson requesting that he and his family be allowed to stay in the Executive mansion for two and a half weeks because his mother had told him that &quot;she can not possibly be ready to leave here&quot;. Lincoln also acknowledged that he was aware of the &quot;great inconvenience&quot; this would be to Johnson since he had become president of the United States only a short time earlier.

In late April, 1865, Robert moved to the city of Chicago with his remaining family. He attended law classes at the Old University of Chicago and studied law at the Chicago firm of Scammon, McCagg &amp; Fuller. On January 1, 1866, Lincoln moved out of the apartment he shared with his mother and brother. He rented his own rooms in downtown Chicago to &quot;begin to live with some degree of comfort&quot; which he had not known when living in cramped conditions with his family. Lincoln graduated from Northwestern University with an LL.B. in 1866 and became licensed as an attorney in Chicago on February 22, 1867. He was certified to practice law four days later on February 26, 1867.

==Family==
===Marriage and children===
On September 24, 1868, Lincoln married Mary Eunice Harlan, daughter of Senator James Harlan and Ann Eliza Peck of Mount Pleasant, Iowa. 
They had three children, two daughters and one son: Mary &quot;Mamie&quot; Lincoln, Abraham &quot;Jack&quot; Lincoln II, and Jessie Harlan Lincoln.

Robert, Mary, and the children would often leave their hot city life behind for the cooler climate of Mount Pleasant, during the 1880s the family would summer at the Harlan home there. The Harlan-Lincoln home, built in 1876, still stands today. Donated by Mary Harlan Lincoln to Iowa Wesleyan College in 1907, it now serves as a museum containing a collection of artifacts from the Lincoln family and from Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s presidency.

Of Robert&#x27;s children, Jessie Harlan Lincoln Beckwith had two children, namely Mary Lincoln Beckwith (&quot;Peggy&quot;) and Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, but neither of them had children of their own. The Robert Todd Lincoln of this article had another daughter, Mary (&quot;Mamie&quot;) Todd Lincoln, who married Charles Bradford Isham in 1891; they had one son, Lincoln Isham, who married Leahalma Correa in 1919, but died without children. The last person acknowledged and known to be of Lincoln lineage, Robert&#x27;s grandson Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, died in 1985.

===Relationship with Mary Todd Lincoln===
In 1871, Lincoln&#x27;s only surviving brother, Tad, died at age 18, leaving his mother devastated. Lincoln was already concerned about what he thought were his mother&#x27;s compulsive and extravagant spending, hallucinations, and eccentric behaviors. Fearing that she was a danger to herself, he arranged to have her committed to a psychiatric hospital in Batavia, Illinois, in 1875. With his mother in the hospital, he was left with control of her finances, although he used his own money to pay for her care. As the head of the family, he felt that it was his duty to protect her, although he did wish that she would have &quot;every liberty and privilege&quot; restored to her as soon as she was better. On May 20, 1875, she arrived at Bellevue Place, a private, upscale sanitarium in the Fox River Valley.

Three months after she started living there, Mary Lincoln was able to escape from Bellevue Place. She smuggled letters to her lawyer, James B. Bradwell, and his wife, Myra. Mary also wrote to the editor of the &quot;Chicago Times&quot; and shortly, the embarrassment Robert had hoped to avoid came to the forefront, with his motives and character being publicly questioned. Bellevue&#x27;s director, who at Mary&#x27;s commitment trial assured the jury she would benefit from treatment at his facility, now declared her well enough to go to Springfield to live with her sister. Her commitment and subsequent events alienated Lincoln from his mother, and they did not possibly reconcile until shortly before her unexpected death.

==Politics==

===Secretary of War (1881–1885)===
From 1876 to 1877 Lincoln served as Town Supervisor of South Chicago, a town which was later absorbed into the city of Chicago. In 1877 he rejected President Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27; offer to appoint him Assistant Secretary of State. He was appointed by President James Garfield as Secretary of War and served from 1881 to 1885 under Garfield and then Chester A. Arthur.

During his term in office, the Cincinnati Riots of 1884 broke out over a case in which a jury gave a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder in a case that many suspected was rigged. Forty-five people died during three days of rioting before U.S. troops dispatched by Lincoln reestablished calm.

Subsequent to serving as Secretary of War, Lincoln assisted Oscar Dudley to establish the Illinois Industrial Training School for Boys (now known as Glenwood Academy) in Norwood Park in 1887, after Dudley (a Humane Society employee) &quot;discovered more homeless, neglected and abused boys than dogs on the city streets.&quot;

===Republican politics===

From 1884 to 1912, Lincoln&#x27;s name was mentioned in varying degrees of seriousness as a candidate for the Republican presidential or vice-presidential nomination. He repeatedly disavowed any interest in running and stated he would not accept nomination for either position. His likeness was included in an 1888 set of &quot;Presidential Possibilities&quot; cards.

===Minister to the Court of St James&#x27;s===
Lincoln served as the U.S. minister to Great Britain, formally to the Court of St James&#x27;s, from 1889 to 1893 under President Benjamin Harrison. Lincoln&#x27;s teenage son, Abraham II &quot;Jack&quot;, died during this time in Europe. After serving as minister, Lincoln returned to private business as a lawyer.

==Later life and career==
Robert fought to preserve and protect his father&#x27;s legacy, clashing with Abraham Lincoln biographer William Herndon over Herndon&#x27;s statements about his father. As a result of their confrontations over his Lincoln biography, in 1890 Herndon wrote to Jesse Weik, his Lincoln biography collaborator, that Robert was &quot;a Todd and not a Lincoln ... a little bitter fellow of the pig-headed kind, silly and cold and selfish.&quot;

Lincoln was general counsel of the Pullman Palace Car Company under George Pullman, and was named president after Pullman&#x27;s death in 1897. According to Almont Lindsey&#x27;s 1942 book, &quot;The Pullman Strike&quot;, Lincoln arranged to have Pullman quietly excused from the subpoena issued for him to testify in the 1895 conspiracy trials of the American Railway Union&#x27;s leaders (during the 1894 Pullman Strike). Pullman hid from the deputy marshal sent to his office with the subpoena and then appeared with Lincoln to meet privately with Judge Grosscup after the jury had been dismissed. In 1911, Lincoln became chairman of the Pullman Company board, a position he held until 1924.

A serious nonprofessional astronomer, Lincoln had an observatory built at Hildene, and a 1909 Warner &amp; Swasey refracting telescope with a six-inch John A. Brashear objective lens was installed. Lincoln&#x27;s telescope and observatory have been restored and it was used by a local astronomy club in the early 2000s. Lincoln was also a dedicated golfer, and served as president of the Ekwanok Country Club in Manchester. His last public appearance was on May 30, 1922, at the dedication ceremony for his father&#x27;s memorial in Washington, D.C.

==Presence at assassinations==
Robert Lincoln was coincidentally either present or nearby when three presidential assassinations occurred.
* Lincoln was not present at Ford&#x27;s Theatre when his father was assassinated but he was at the White House nearby, and rushed to be with his parents. The president was moved to the Petersen House after the shooting, where Robert attended his father&#x27;s deathbed.
* Lincoln was an eyewitness when Charles J. Guiteau shot President James A. Garfield at the Sixth Street Train Station in Washington, D.C., on July 2, 1881. Lincoln was serving as Garfield&#x27;s Secretary of War at the time.
* Lincoln was at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, when President William McKinley was shot by Leon Czolgosz. Though not an eyewitness, he was just outside the Temple of Music when the shooting actually occurred.

Lincoln himself recognized these coincidences. He is said to have refused a later presidential invitation with the comment, &quot;No, I&#x27;m not going, and they&#x27;d better not ask me, because there is a certain fatality about presidential functions when I am present.&quot;

==Death==
Robert Todd Lincoln died in his sleep at Hildene, his Vermont home, on July 26, 1926, at age 82. The cause of death was given by his physician as a &quot;cerebral hemorrhage induced by arteriosclerosis&quot;. His body was stored in the receiving vault at Dellwood Cemetery from July 1926 until March 1928 when arrangements were made to inter his remains at Arlington National Cemetery.

Robert had long expressed his intention to be buried in the Lincoln Tomb with his family at the Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield. Two weeks after his death, his widow Mary Harlan Lincoln wrote to her husband&#x27;s niece of an inspired thought: &quot;...[O]ur darling was a personage, made his own history, independently of his great father, and should have his own place &#x27;in the sun&#x27;&quot;.

Lincoln&#x27;s body was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in a sarcophagus designed by the sculptor James Earle Fraser. He is buried together with his wife, Mary, and their son, Abraham II (&quot;Jack&quot;), who had died in London, England, of sepsis in 1890 at the age of 16. Weeks after Jack&#x27;s death, Robert wrote to his cousin Charles Edwards, &quot;We had a long &amp; most anxious struggle and at times had hopes of saving our boy. It would have been done if it had depended only on his own marvelous pluck &amp; patience now that the end has come, there is a great blank in our future lives &amp; an affliction not to be measured.&quot;
==Legacy==

Historian Michael Burlingame considered Robert Todd Lincoln to be &quot;a particularly unfortunate, even tragic figure.&quot; Lincoln himself once said, &quot;No one wanted me for Secretary of War... For minister to England... For president of the Pullman Company; they wanted Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s son.&quot; Nevertheless, he accepted the appointments and was very well-paid, becoming a millionaire lawyer and businessman, fond of the pleasures of the wealthy conservative Victorian gentlemen of his social circle.

Lincoln is considered to have had little in common with his father personally or politically, not being humorous or unpretentious, but rather cold, stuffy, and aloof. Fanny Seward, daughter of secretary of state William H. Seward, described him, however, as &quot;ready and easy in conversation having, I fancy, considerable humor in his disposition...agreeable, good-natured, and intelligent&quot;.

Lincoln was the last surviving member of the Garfield and Arthur Cabinets, and the last-surviving witness of Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox. The Lincoln Sea, a body of water in the Arctic Ocean between Canada and Greenland, was named after then Secretary of War Lincoln on Adolphus Greely&#x27;s 1881–1884 Arctic expedition.

Lincoln&#x27;s last known surviving descendant, Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, died December 24, 1985.

<text>John Davison &quot;Jay&quot; Rockefeller IV (born June 18, 1937) is a retired American politician who served as a United States senator from West Virginia (1985–2015). He was first elected to the Senate in 1984, while in office as governor of West Virginia (1977–1985). Rockefeller moved to Emmons, West Virginia, to serve as a VISTA worker in 1964 and was first elected to public office as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates (1966–1968). Rockefeller was later elected secretary of state of West Virginia (1968–1973) and was president of West Virginia Wesleyan College (1973–1975). He became the state&#x27;s senior U.S. senator when the long-serving Senator Robert Byrd died in June 2010.

Rockefeller is a great-grandson of oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, who died less than a month before Jay&#x27;s birth. He was the only serving politician of the Rockefeller family during his tenure in the United States Senate, and the only one to have held office as a Democrat, in what has been a traditionally Republican family (though he too was originally a Republican until he decided to run for office in the then-heavily Democratic state). Rockefeller did not seek reelection in 2014 and was succeeded by Republican U.S. Representative Shelley Moore Capito.

==Early life and education==
John Davison Rockefeller IV was born at New York Hospital in Manhattan to John Davison Rockefeller III (1906–1978) and Blanchette Ferry Hooker (1909–1992), 26 days after the death of his patrilineal great-grandfather, John D. Rockefeller (1839–1937). He is a grandson of John D. Rockefeller Jr. Jay graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1955. After his junior year at Harvard College, he spent three years studying Japanese at the International Christian University in Tokyo. He graduated from Harvard in 1961 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Far Eastern languages and history. He attended Yale University and did graduate work in Oriental studies and studied the Chinese language.

After college, Rockefeller worked for the Peace Corps in Washington, D.C., under President John F. Kennedy, where he developed a friendship with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and worked as an assistant to Peace Corps Director Sargent Shriver. He served as the operations director for the Corps&#x27; largest overseas program, in the Philippines. He worked for a brief time in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. He continued his public service in 1964–1965 in the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), under President Lyndon B. Johnson, during which time he moved to Emmons, West Virginia.

==Career==

=== State politics ===

Rockefeller was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1966. During his tenure, in the summer of 1968, after Robert Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, his uncle Nelson Rockefeller, governor of New York, offered him to take up the Senator&#x27;s seat. He would ultimately refuse.

He was later elected to the office of West Virginia Secretary of State in 1968. He won the Democratic nomination for governor in 1972 but was defeated in the general election by the Republican incumbent, Arch A. Moore Jr.. Rockefeller then served as president of West Virginia Wesleyan College from 1973 to 1975.

Rockefeller was elected governor of West Virginia in 1976 and re-elected in 1980. He served as governor when manufacturing plants and coal mines were closing as the national recession of the early 1980s hit West Virginia particularly hard. Between 1982 and 1984, West Virginia&#x27;s unemployment rate hovered between 15 and 20 percent.

=== U.S. Senate ===

==== Elections ====
In 1984, he was elected to the United States Senate, narrowly defeating businessman John Raese as Ronald Reagan easily carried the state in the presidential election. As in his 1980 gubernatorial campaign against Arch Moore, Rockefeller spent over $12 million to win a Senate seat. He was re-elected in 1990, 1996, 2002 and 2008 by substantial margins. He was chair of the Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs (1993–1995; January 3 to 20, 2001; and June 6, 2001 – January 3, 2003). Rockefeller was the chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (2009–2015).

==== Overview ====
In April 1992, he was the Democratic Party&#x27;s finance chairman and considered running for the presidency, but pulled out after consulting with friends and advisers. He went on to strongly endorse Bill Clinton as the Democratic nominee.

He chaired the prominent Senate Intelligence Committee (retiring in January 2009), from which he commented frequently on the war in Iraq.

In 1993, Rockefeller became the principal Senate supporter, with Ted Kennedy, behind Bill and Hillary Clinton&#x27;s sweeping health care reform package, liaising closely with the First Lady, opening up his mansion next to Rock Creek Park for its first strategy meeting. The reform was subsequently defeated by an alliance between the Business Roundtable and a small-business coalition.

In 2002, Rockefeller made an official visit to several Middle Eastern countries, during which he discussed his personal views regarding United States military intentions with the leaders of those countries. In October of that year, Rockefeller strongly expressed his concern for Saddam Hussein&#x27;s alleged weapons of mass destruction program while addressing the U.S. Senate:

In November 2005 during a TV interview, Rockefeller stated,

I took a trip ... in January 2002 to Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria, and I told each of the heads of state that it was my view that George Bush had already made up his mind to go to war against Iraq, that that was a predetermined set course that had taken shape shortly after 9/11.

Rockefeller noted that the comment expresses his personal opinion, and that he was not privy to any confidential information that such action was planned. On October 11, 2002, he was one of 77 senators who voted for the Iraq Resolution authorizing the Iraq invasion.

In February 2010, regarding President Obama, Rockefeller said,

He says &#x27;I&#x27;m for clean coal,&#x27; and then he says it in his speeches, but he doesn&#x27;t say it in here ... And he doesn&#x27;t say it in the minds of my own people. And he&#x27;s beginning to not be believable to me.

Rockefeller faced criticism from West Virginia coal companies, which claimed that he was out of touch.

Rockefeller became the senior U.S. senator from West Virginia when Robert Byrd died in June 2010, after serving in the senate with Rockefeller for 25 years.

In July 2011 Rockefeller was prominent in calling for U.S. agencies to investigate whether alleged phone hacking at News Corporation&#x27;s newspapers in the United Kingdom had targeted American victims of the September 11 attacks. Rockefeller and Barbara Boxer subsequently wrote to the oversight committee of Dow Jones &amp; Company (a subsidiary of News Corporation) to request that it conduct an investigation into the hiring of former CEO Les Hinton, and whether any current or former executives had knowledge of or played a role in phone hacking.

He announced on January 11, 2013, that he would not run for a sixth term. On March 25, 2013, Rockefeller announced his support for gay marriage.

In November 2014, Rockefeller donated his senatorial archives to the West Virginia University Libraries and the West Virginia &amp; Regional History Center. The archival collection documents his 30-year career in the United States Senate.

According to the website GovTrack, Rockefeller missed 541 of 9,992 roll call votes from January 1985 to July 2014. This amounted to 5.4 percent, which was worse than the median of 2.0 percent among senators serving as of July 2014.

Rockefeller, along with his son Charles, is a trustee of New York&#x27;s Asia Society, which was established by his father in 1956. He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonprofit think tank previously chaired by his uncle, David Rockefeller. As a senator, he voted against the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement, which was heavily backed by David Rockefeller.

==== Committees ====
Rockefeller served on the following committees in the 112th Congress:

*Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (chairman)
**As chair of the full committee, Sen. Rockefeller may serve as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees
*Committee on Finance
**Subcommittee on Health Care (chairman)
**Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness
**Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy
*Select Committee on Intelligence
*Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs
*Joint Committee on Taxation

==Political positions==
===Iraq War===
Rockefeller initially supported the use of force based upon the evidence presented by the intelligence community that linked Iraq to nuclear ambitions. After the Niger uranium forgeries, in which the Bush administration gave forged documents to U.N. weapons inspectors to support allegations against Iraq, Rockefeller started an investigation into the falsification and exaggeration of evidence for the war. Through the investigations, he became an outspoken critic of Bush and the Iraq war. As chair of the Intelligence committee, he presided over a critical report on the administration&#x27;s handling of intelligence and war operations.

Rockefeller and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released the final two pieces of the Phase II report on Iraq war intelligence on June 5, 2008. Rockefeller said, &quot;The president and his advisers undertook a relentless public campaign in the aftermath of the attacks to use the war against Al Qaeda as a justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein.&quot;

===Television violence===
In July 2007, Rockefeller announced that he planned to introduce legislation before the August congressional recess that would give the FCC the power to regulate TV violence. According to the edition of July 16, 2007, of Broadcasting &amp; Cable, the new law would apply to both broadcast as well as cable and satellite programming. This would mark the first time that the FCC would be given power to regulate such a vast spectrum of content, which would include almost everything except material produced strictly for direct internet use. An aide to the senator said that his staff had also been carefully formulating the bill in such a way that it would be able to pass constitutional scrutiny by the courts.

===Telecommunications companies===
In 2007, Rockefeller began steering the Senate Intelligence Committee to grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies who were accused of unlawfully assisting the National Security Agency (NSA) in monitoring the communications of American citizens.

This was an about-face of sorts for Senator Rockefeller, who had hand-written a letter to Vice President Dick Cheney in 2003 expressing his concerns about the legality of NSA&#x27;s warrantless wire-tapping program. Some have attributed this change of heart to the spike in contributions from telecommunications companies to the senator just as these companies began lobbying Congress to protect them from lawsuits regarding their cooperation with the National Security Agency.

Between 2001 and the start of this lobbying effort, AT&amp;T employees had contributed only $300 to the senator. After the lobbying effort began, AT&amp;T employees and executives donated $19,350 in three months. The senator has pledged not to rely on his vast fortune to fund his campaigns, and the AT&amp;T contributions represent about 2% of the money he raised during the previous year.

===Torture===
Although publicly deploring torture, Rockefeller was one of two congressional Democrats briefed on waterboarding and other secret CIA practices in the early years of the Bush administration, as well as the existence of taped evidence of such interrogations (later destroyed). In December 2007, Rockefeller opposed a special counsel or commission inquiry into the destruction of the tapes, stating &quot;it is the job of the intelligence committees to do that.&quot;

On September 28, 2006, Rockefeller voted with a largely Republican majority to suspend habeas corpus provisions for anyone deemed by the Executive Branch an &quot;unlawful combatant,&quot; barring them from challenging their detentions in court. Rockefeller&#x27;s vote gave a retroactive, nine-year immunity to U.S. officials who authorized, ordered, or committed acts of torture and abuse, permitting the use of statements obtained through torture to be used in military tribunals so long as the abuse took place by December 30, 2005.
Rockefeller&#x27;s vote authorized the President to establish permissible interrogation techniques and to &quot;interpret the meaning and application&quot; of international Geneva Convention standards, so long as the coercion fell short of &quot;serious&quot; bodily or psychological injury. The bill became law on October 17, 2006.

===2008 presidential election===
On February 29, 2008, he endorsed Barack Obama for president of the United States, citing Obama&#x27;s judgment on the Iraq war and national security issues, and calling him the right candidate to lead America during a time of instability at home and abroad. This endorsement stood in stark contrast to the results of the state primary that was easily won by Hillary Clinton.

On April 7, 2008, in an interview for &quot;The Charleston Gazette&quot;, Rockefeller criticized John McCain&#x27;s Vietnam experience:

McCain was a fighter pilot, who dropped laser-guided missiles from 35,000 feet. He was long gone when they hit. What happened when they get to the ground? He doesn&#x27;t know. You have to care about the lives of people. McCain never gets into those issues.

The McCain campaign called for an apology from Senator Rockefeller and for Barack Obama, whom Rockefeller endorsed, to denounce the comment. Rockefeller later apologized for the comment and the Obama campaign issued a statement expressing Obama&#x27;s disagreement with the comment. Senator Lindsey Graham (R) of South Carolina noted that &quot;John didn&#x27;t drop bombs from 35,000 feet. ... the bombs were not laser guided (in the 1960 and 1970s)&quot;.

===Cybersecurity===
On April 1, 2009, Rockefeller introduced the Cybersecurity Act of 2009 - S.773 before Congress. Citing the vulnerability of the Internet to cyber-attacks, the bill makes provisions to turn the Department of Commerce into a public-private clearing house to share potential threat information with the owners of large private networks. It authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to sequester any information deemed necessary, without regard to any law.

It would also authorizes the president to declare an undefined &quot;cyber-emergency&quot; which would allow them to shut down any and all traffic to what they considers to be a compromised server.

On June 1, 2011, Rockefeller sponsored the fourth West Virginia Homeland Security Summit and Expo. The event ran two days and focused on homeland security with Rockefeller emphasizing cybersecurity.

===Health care===
In 1997, Rockefeller co-authored the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) – a program aimed at giving low-income children health insurance coverage. Annually, CHIP has been successfully covering about 6 million children, who otherwise would have been uninsured. On September 30, 2007, the program expired, requiring Congress to reauthorize the legislation. On August 2, 2007, the vote for reauthorization passed legislation by a strong, bipartisan vote (68–31).

Rockefeller authored successful legislation that required the Department of Veterans Affairs, for the first time, to provide a wide range of extended care services—such as home health care, adult day care, respite care, and hospice care—to veterans who use the VA health care system.

Rockefeller is also a strong supporter of the fight against Alzheimer&#x27;s and neurological disease. The Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute (BRNI) was founded in Morgantown in 1999 by Rockefeller and his family to help advance medical and scientific understanding of Alzheimer&#x27;s and other diseases of the brain. BRNI is the world&#x27;s only non-profit institute dedicated exclusively to the study of both human memory and diseases of memory. Its primary mission is to accelerate neurological discoveries from the lab, including diagnostic tools and treatments, to the clinic to benefit patients who suffer from neurological and psychiatric diseases. A $30 million state-of-the-art BRNI research facility was opened at West Virginia University in Fall 2008. The approximately three-level building will house 100 scientists by 2012.

On Healthcare Reform, Rockefeller has been a proponent of a public option, fighting with some Democrats on the finance committee, in particular Max Baucus, the chairman of the committee, who contended that there was not enough support for a public option to gather the 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster. Baucus asked repeatedly for Rockefeller to stop speaking on the issue.

On September 29, 2009, Rockefeller offered an amendment to the Baucus Health Bill in the Senate Finance Committee to add a public option. The amendment was rejected 15 to 8, with five Democrats (Baucus, Kent Conrad, Blanche Lincoln, Tom Carper, Bill Nelson) and all Republicans voting no.

Rockefeller supported President Barack Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation; he voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and he voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

==Electoral history==


























==Personal life==
Since 1967, Rockefeller has been married to Sharon Lee Percy, the chief executive officer of WETA-TV, the leading PBS station in the Washington, D.C., area, which broadcasts such programs as &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; and &quot;Washington Week&quot;. She is a twin daughter of Senator Charles Harting Percy (1919–2011) and Jeanne Valerie Dickerson.

Jay and Sharon have four children:
*John Davison &quot;Jamie&quot; Rockefeller V (born 1969), who is married to Emily Rockefeller. She is the daughter of former National Football League (NFL) Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.

President Bill Clinton, a friend of Rockefeller&#x27;s, and the Clinton family vacationed at the ranch in August 1995.

Rockefeller is related to several Republican Party supporters and former officeholders: his paternal grandmother Abigail Greene &quot;Abby&quot; Aldrich (1874–1948) was a daughter of Rhode Island Senator Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich (1841–1915). John Davison Rockefeller Jr. (1874–1960) and Abby&#x27;s youngest son was banker David Rockefeller (1915–2017). David&#x27;s brother Winthrop Rockefeller (1912–1973) served as Governor of Arkansas (1967–71). Winthrop and David&#x27;s brother Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller (1908–1979) served as Governor of New York (1959–73) and as Vice President of the United States (1974–77) under President Gerald Ford. Jay is also a first cousin of Arkansas Lt. Governor Winthrop Paul Rockefeller (1948–2006).

<text>Kathleen Mary Ferrier (22 April 19128 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death.

The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J. E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts.

In 1946 Ferrier made her stage debut in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s opera &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot;. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and her many visits to continental Europe.

Ferrier was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 1951. In between periods of hospitalisation and convalescence she continued to perform and record; her final public appearance was as Orfeo, at the Royal Opera House in February 1953, eight months before her death. Among her many memorials, the Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund was launched in May 1954. The Kathleen Ferrier Scholarship Fund, administered by the Royal Philharmonic Society, has since 1956 made annual awards to aspiring young professional singers.

==Early life==

===Childhood===

The Ferrier family originally came from Pembrokeshire in South West Wales. The Lancashire branch originated in the 19th century, when Thomas Ferrier (youngest son of Private Thomas Ferrier of the Pembrokeshire Regiment) settled in the area after being stationed near Blackburn during a period of industrial unrest. Kathleen Ferrier was born on 22 April 1912, in the Lancashire village of Higher Walton where her father William Ferrier (the fourth child of Thomas and Elizabeth, née Gorton) was the head of the village school. Although untrained musically, William was an enthusiastic member of the local operatic society and of several choirs, and his wife Alice (née Murray), whom he married in 1900, was a competent singer with a strong contralto voice. Kathleen was the third and youngest of the couple&#x27;s children, following a sister and a brother; when she was two the family moved to Blackburn, after William was appointed headmaster of St Paul&#x27;s School in the town. From an early age Kathleen showed promise as a pianist, and had lessons with Frances Walker, a noted North of England piano teacher who had been a pupil of Tobias Matthay. Kathleen&#x27;s talent developed quickly; in 1924, she came fourth out of 43 entrants at the Lytham St Annes Festival piano competition, and in the following year at Lytham she achieved second place.

===Telephonist and pianist===

Because of William&#x27;s impending retirement and the consequent fall in the family&#x27;s income, Ferrier&#x27;s hopes of attending a music college could not be realised. In August 1926, she left school to start work as a trainee at the GPO telephone exchange in Blackburn. She continued her piano studies under Frances Walker, and in November 1928 was the regional winner in a national contest for young pianists, organised by the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. Although unsuccessful in the London finals which followed, Ferrier won a Cramer upright piano as a prize.

On 10 March 1929, she made a well-received appearance as an accompanist in a concert at Blackburn&#x27;s King George&#x27;s Hall. After further piano competition successes, she was invited to perform a short radio recital at the Manchester studios of the BBC, and on 3 July 1930 made her first broadcast, playing works by Brahms and Percy Grainger. Around this time she completed her training and she became a fully fledged telephonist.

In 1931, aged 19, Ferrier passed her Licentiate examinations at the Royal Academy of Music. In that year she started occasional singing lessons, and in December sang a small alto role in a church performance of Mendelssohn&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Elijah&quot;. However, her voice was not thought to be exceptional; her musical life centred on the piano and on local concerts, at King George&#x27;s Hall and elsewhere. Early in 1934 she transferred to the Blackpool telephone exchange and took lodgings nearby, to be close to her new boyfriend, a bank clerk named Albert Wilson. While at Blackpool she auditioned for the new &quot;speaking clock&quot; service which the GPO was preparing to introduce. In her excitement, Ferrier inserted an extra aspirate into her audition, and was not chosen for the final selection in London. Her decision in 1935 to marry Wilson meant the end of her employment with the telephone exchange, since at that time the GPO did not employ married women. Of Ferrier&#x27;s career to this point, the music biographer Humphrey Burton wrote: &quot;For more than a decade, when she should have been studying music with the best teachers, learning English literature and foreign languages, acquiring stage craft and movement skills, and travelling to London regularly to see opera, Miss Ferrier was actually answering the telephone, getting married to a bank manager and winning tinpot competitions for her piano-playing.&quot;

===Marriage===

Ferrier met Albert Wilson in 1933, probably through dancing, which they both loved. When she announced that they were to marry, her family and friends had strong reservations, on the grounds that she was young and inexperienced, and that she and Wilson shared few serious interests. Nevertheless, the marriage took place on 19 November 1935. Shortly afterwards the couple moved to Silloth, a small port town in Cumberland, where Wilson had been appointed as manager of his bank&#x27;s branch. The marriage was not successful; the honeymoon had revealed problems of sexual incompatibility, and the union remained unconsummated. Outward appearances were maintained for a few years, until Wilson&#x27;s departure for military service in 1940 effectively ended the marriage. The couple divorced in 1947, though they remained on good terms. Wilson subsequently married a friend of Ferrier&#x27;s, Wyn Hetherington; he died in 1969.

==Early singing career==

In 1937 Ferrier entered the Carlisle Festival open piano competition and, as a result of a small bet with her husband, also signed up for the singing contest. She won the piano trophy; in the singing finals she sang Roger Quilter&#x27;s &quot;To Daisies&quot;, a performance which earned her the festival&#x27;s top vocal award. Ferrier was awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival.

After her Carlisle victories, Ferrier began to receive offers of singing engagements. Her first appearance as a professional vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria. She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang &quot;Ma Curly-Headed Babby&quot; in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcast—her first as a vocalist—attracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed by the death of her mother at the beginning of February. At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss&#x27;s song &quot;All Souls&#x27; Day&quot;, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music teacher with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar.

When Albert Wilson joined the army in 1940, Ferrier reverted to her maiden name, having until then sung as &#x27;Kathleen Wilson&#x27;. In December 1940, she appeared for the first time professionally as &#x27;Kathleen Ferrier&#x27; in a performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, under Hutchinson&#x27;s direction. In early 1941 she successfully auditioned as a singer with the Council for the Encouragement of the Arts (CEMA), which provided concerts and other entertainments to military camps, factories and other workplaces. Within this organisation Ferrier began working with artists with international reputations; in December 1941, she sang with the Hallé Orchestra in a performance of &quot;Messiah&quot; together with Isobel Baillie, the distinguished soprano. However, her application to the BBC&#x27;s head of music in Manchester for an audition was turned down. Ferrier had better fortune when she was introduced to Malcolm Sargent after a Hallé concert in Blackpool. Sargent agreed to hear her sing, and afterwards recommended her to Ibbs and Tillett, the London-based concert management agency. John Tillett accepted her as a client without hesitation after which, on Sargent&#x27;s advice, Ferrier decided to base herself in London. On 24 December 1942, she moved with her sister Winifred into a flat in Frognal Mansions, Hampstead.

==Stardom==

===Growing reputation===

Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess. Although she wrote &quot;went off very well&quot; in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot;. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her &quot;warm and spacious tone&quot; was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: &quot;one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction&quot;. However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to &quot;her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character&quot;.

On 17 May 1943, Ferrier sang in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; at Westminster Abbey, alongside Isobel Baillie and Peter Pears, with Reginald Jacques conducting. According to the critic Neville Cardus, it was through the quality of her singing here that Ferrier &quot;made her first serious appeal to musicians&quot;. Her assured performance led to other important engagements, and to broadcasting work; her increasingly frequent appearances on popular programmes such as &quot;Forces Favourites&quot; and &quot;Housewives&#x27; Choice&quot; soon gave her national recognition. In May 1944, at EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios with Gerald Moore as her accompanist, she made test recordings of music by Brahms, Gluck and Elgar. Her first published record, made in September 1944, was issued under the Columbia label; it consisted of two songs by Maurice Greene, again with Moore accompanying. Her time as a Columbia recording artist was brief and unhappy; she had poor relations with her producer, Walter Legge, and after a few months she transferred to Decca.

In the remaining wartime months, Ferrier continued to travel throughout the country, to fulfil the growing demands for her services from concert promoters. At Leeds in November 1944, she sang the part of the Angel in Elgar&#x27;s choral work &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, her first performance in what became one of her best-known roles. In December she met John Barbirolli while working on another Elgar piece, &quot;Sea Pictures&quot;; the conductor later became one of her closest friends and strongest advocates. On 15 September 1945, Ferrier made her debut at the London Proms, when she sang &quot;L&#x27;Air des Adieux&quot; from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera &quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot;. Although she often sang individual arias, opera was not Ferrier&#x27;s natural forte; she had not enjoyed singing the title role in a concert version of Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; at Stourbridge in March 1944, and generally avoided similar engagements. Nevertheless, Benjamin Britten, who had heard her Westminster Abbey &quot;Messiah&quot; performance, persuaded her to create the role of Lucretia in his new opera &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot;, which was to open the first postwar Glyndebourne Festival in 1946. She would share the part with Nancy Evans. Despite her initial misgivings, by early July Ferrier was writing to her agent that she was &quot;enjoying [the rehearsals] tremendously and I should think it&#x27;s the best part one could possibly have&quot;.

Ferrier&#x27;s performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses.

By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier&#x27;s performance. This was Ferrier&#x27;s first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: &quot;The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!&quot; Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck&#x27;s opera &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;. She had often sung Orfeo&#x27;s aria &quot;Che farò&quot; (&quot;What is life&quot;) as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier&#x27;s limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.

Ferrier&#x27;s association with Glyndebourne bore further fruit when Rudolf Bing, the festival&#x27;s general manager, recommended her to Bruno Walter as the contralto soloist in a performance of Mahler&#x27;s symphonic song cycle &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;. This was planned for the 1947 Edinburgh International Festival. Walter was initially wary of working with a relatively new singer, but after her audition his fears were allayed; &quot;I recognised with delight that here potentially was one of the greatest singers of our time&quot;, he later wrote. &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; was at that time largely unknown in Britain, and some critics found it unappealing; nevertheless, the &quot;Edinburgh Evening News&quot; thought it &quot;simply superb&quot;. In a later biographical sketch of Ferrier, Lord Harewood described the partnership between Walter and her, which endured until the singer&#x27;s final illness, as &quot;a rare match of music, voice and temperament.&quot;

===Career apex, 1948–51===

On 1 January 1948, Ferrier left for a four-week tour of North America, the first of three transatlantic trips she would make during the next three years. In New York City, she sang two performances of &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;, with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic. Alma Mahler, the composer&#x27;s widow, was present at the first of these, on 15 January. In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: &quot;Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed&quot;. After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in Ottawa and Chicago before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February.

During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Alto Rhapsody&quot; at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor at that year&#x27;s Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October 1948, she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot;. She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February 1949 to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home, Ferrier berated &quot;this abominable accompanist&quot; who deserved &quot;a kick in the pants&quot;. When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour&#x27;s promoters: &quot;What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me&quot;. Eventually, when Sándor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship.

Shortly after her return to Britain early in June 1949, Ferrier left for Amsterdam where, on 14 July, she sang in the world premiere of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Spring Symphony&quot;, with Eduard van Beinum and the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Britten had written this work specifically for her. At the Edinburgh Festival in September she gave two recitals in which Bruno Walter acted as her piano accompanist. Ferrier felt that these recitals represented &quot;a peak to which I had been groping for the last three years&quot;. A broadcast of one of the recitals was issued on record many years later; of this, the critic Alan Blyth wrote: &quot;Walter&#x27;s very personal and positive support obviously pushes Ferrier to give of her very best&quot;.

The following 18 months saw almost uninterrupted activity, encompassing a number of visits to continental Europe and a third American tour between December 1949 and April 1950. This American trip broke new ground for Ferrier—the West Coast—and included three performances in San Francisco of &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, with Pierre Monteux conducting. At the rehearsals Ferrier met the renowned American contralto Marian Anderson, who reportedly said of her English counterpart: &quot;My God, what a voice—and what a face!&quot; On Ferrier&#x27;s return home the hectic pace continued, with a rapid succession of concerts in Amsterdam, London and Edinburgh followed by a tour of Austria, Switzerland and Italy. In Vienna, the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was Ferrier&#x27;s co-soloist in a recorded performance of Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor, with the Vienna Symphony under Herbert von Karajan. Schwarzkopf later recalled Ferrier&#x27;s singing of the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; from the &quot;Mass&quot; as her highlight of the year.

Early in 1951, while on tour in Rome, Ferrier learned of her father&#x27;s death at the age of 83. Although she was upset by this news, she decided to continue with the tour; her diary entry for 30 January reads: &quot;My Pappy died peacefully after flu and a slight stroke&quot;. She returned to London on 19 February, and was immediately busy rehearsing with Barbirolli and the Hallé a work that was new to her: Ernest Chausson&#x27;s &quot;Poème de l&#x27;amour et de la mer&quot;. This was performed at Manchester on 28 February, to critical acclaim. Two weeks later Ferrier discovered a lump on her breast. She nevertheless fulfilled several engagements in Germany, the Netherlands and at Glyndebourne before seeing her doctor on 24 March. After tests at University College Hospital, cancer of the breast was diagnosed, and a mastectomy was performed on 10 April. All immediate engagements were cancelled; among these was a planned series of performances of &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot; by the English Opera Group, scheduled as part of the 1951 Festival of Britain.

==Later career==

===Failing health===

Ferrier resumed performing on 19 June 1951, in the Mass in B minor at the Royal Albert Hall. She then made her usual visit to the Holland Festival, where she gave four performances of &quot;Orfeo&quot;, and sang in Mahler&#x27;s Second Symphony with Otto Klemperer and the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Through the summer her concert schedule was interspersed with hospital visits; however, she was well enough to sing at the Edinburgh Festival in September, where she performed two recitals with Walter and sang Chausson&#x27;s &quot;Poème&quot; with Barbirolli and the Hallé. In November, she sang &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; at the reopening of Manchester&#x27;s Free Trade Hall, a climax to the evening which, wrote Barbirolli, &quot;moved everyone, not least the conductor, to tears&quot;. After this, Ferrier rested for two months while she underwent radiation therapy; her only work engagement during December was a three-day recording session of folk songs at the Decca studios.

In January 1952, Ferrier joined Britten and Pears in a short series of concerts to raise funds for Britten&#x27;s English Opera Group, including the premiere of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Canticle II: Abraham and Isaac&quot;. Writing later, Britten recalled this tour as &quot;perhaps the loveliest of all&quot; of his artistic associations with Ferrier. Despite continuing health problems, she sang in Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall on 30 March, &quot;Messiah&quot; at the Free Trade Hall on 13 April, and &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; with Barbirolli and the Hallé on 23 and 24 April. On 30 April Ferrier attended a private party at which the new Queen, Elizabeth II, and her sister, Princess Margaret, were present. In her diary, Ferrier notes: &quot;Princess M sang—&quot;very&quot; good!&quot;. Her health continued to deteriorate; she refused to consider a course of androgen injections, believing that this treatment would destroy the quality of her voice. In May 1952, she travelled to Vienna to record &quot;Das Lied&quot; and Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Rückert-Lieder&quot; with Walter and the Vienna Philharmonic; singer and conductor had long sought to preserve their partnership on disc. Despite considerable suffering, Ferrier completed the recording sessions between 15 and 20 May.

During the remainder of 1952, Ferrier attended her seventh successive Edinburgh Festival, singing in performances of &quot;Das Lied&quot;, &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, &quot;Messiah&quot; and some Brahms songs. She undertook several studio recording sessions, including a series of Bach and Handel arias with Sir Adrian Boult and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in October. In November, after a Royal Festival Hall recital, she was distressed by a review in which Neville Cardus criticised her performance for introducing &quot;distracting extra vocal appeals&quot; designed to please the audience at the expense of the songs. However, she accepted his comments with good grace, remarking that &quot;... it&#x27;s hard to please everybody—for years I&#x27;ve been criticised for being a colourless, monotonous singer&quot;. In December she sang in the BBC&#x27;s Christmas &quot;Messiah&quot;, the last time she would perform this work. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1953, she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Queen&#x27;s New Year Honours List.

===Final performances, illness and death===

As 1953 began, Ferrier was busy rehearsing for &quot;Orpheus&quot;, an English language version of &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; to be staged in four performances at the Royal Opera House in February. Barbirolli had instigated this project, with Ferrier&#x27;s enthusiastic approval, some months previously. Her only other engagement in January was a BBC recital recording, in which she sang works by three living English composers: Howard Ferguson, William Wordsworth and Edmund Rubbra. During her regular hospital treatment, she discussed with doctors the advisability of an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries), but on learning that the impact on her cancer would probably be insignificant and that her voice might be badly affected, she chose not to have the operation.
The first &quot;Orpheus&quot; performance, on 3 February, was greeted with unanimous critical approval. According to Barbirolli, Ferrier was particularly pleased with one critic&#x27;s comment that her movements were as graceful as any of those of the dancers on stage. However, she was physically weakened from her prolonged radiation treatment; during the second performance, three days later, her left femur partially disintegrated. Quick action by other cast members, who moved to support her, kept the audience in ignorance. Although virtually immobilised, Ferrier sang her remaining arias and took her curtain calls before being transferred to hospital. This proved to be her final public appearance; the two remaining performances, at first rescheduled for April, were eventually cancelled. Still the general public remained unaware of the nature of Ferrier&#x27;s incapacity; an announcement in &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated: &quot;Miss Ferrier is suffering from a strain resulting from arthritis which requires immediate further treatment. It has been caused by the physical stress involved in rehearsal and performance of her role in &quot;Orpheus&quot;&quot;.

Ferrier spent two months in University College Hospital. As a result, she missed her CBE investiture; the ribbon was brought to her at the hospital by a friend. Meanwhile, her sister found her a ground-floor apartment in St John&#x27;s Wood, since she would no longer be able to negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions. She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate. Early in June she heard that she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since Muriel Foster in 1914. In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote that this &quot;unbelievable, wondrous news has done more than anything to make me feel so much better&quot;. This letter, dated 9 June, is probably the last that Ferrier signed herself. As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting. She died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing Frederick Delius&#x27;s &quot;A Mass of Life&quot; at the 1953 Leeds Festival. Ferrier was cremated a few days later, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private service. She left an estate worth £15,134 (), which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was &quot;not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day&quot;.

==Assessment and legacy==

The news of Ferrier&#x27;s death came as a considerable shock to the public. Although some in musical circles knew or suspected the truth, the myth had been preserved that her absence from the concert scene was temporary. The opera critic Rupert Christiansen, writing as the 50th anniversary of Ferrier&#x27;s death approached, maintained that &quot;no singer in this country has ever been more deeply loved, as much for the person she was as for the voice she uttered&quot;. Her death, he continued, &quot;quite literally shattered the euphoria of the Coronation&quot; (which had taken place on 2 June 1953). Ian Jack, editor of &quot;Granta&quot;, believed that she &quot;may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen.&quot; Among the many tributes from her colleagues, that of Bruno Walter has been highlighted by biographers: &quot;The greatest thing in music in my life has been to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav Mahler—in that order.&quot; Very few singers, Lord Harewood writes, &quot;have earned so powerful a valedictory from so senior a colleague.&quot; At a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral on 14 November 1953, the Bishop of Croydon, in his eulogy, said of Ferrier&#x27;s voice: &quot;She seemed to bring into this world a radiance from another world.&quot;
From time to time commentators have speculated on the directions Ferrier&#x27;s career might have taken had she lived. In 1951, while recovering from her mastectomy, she received an offer to sing the part of Brangäne in Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; at the 1952 Bayreuth Festival. According to Christiansen she would have been &quot;glorious&quot; in the role, and was being equally sought by the Bayreuth management to sing Erda in the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. Christiansen further suggests that, given the changes of style over the past 50 years, Ferrier might have been less successful in the 21st century world: &quot;We dislike low-lying voices, for one thing—contraltos now sound freakish and headmistressy, and even the majority of mezzo-sopranos should more accurately be categorised as almost-sopranos&quot;. However, she was &quot;a singer of, and for, her time—a time of grief and weariness, national self-respect and a belief in human nobility&quot;. In this context &quot;her artistry stands upright, austere, unfussy, fundamental and sincere&quot;.

Shortly after Ferrier&#x27;s death an appeal was launched by Barbirolli, Walter, Myra Hess and others, to establish a cancer research fund in Ferrier&#x27;s name. Donations were received from all over the world. To publicise the fund a special concert was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 May 1954, at which Barbirolli and Walter shared the conducting duties without payment. Among the items was a rendition of Purcell&#x27;s &quot;When I am laid in earth&quot;, which Ferrier had often sung; on this occasion the vocal part was played by a solo cor anglais. The Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund helped establish the Kathleen Ferrier Chair of Clinical Oncology at University College Hospital, in 1984. , it was continuing to fund oncology research.

As the result of a separate appeal, augmented by the sales proceeds of a memoir edited by Neville Cardus, the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship Fund was created to encourage young British and Commonwealth singers of either sex. The Fund, which has operated from 1956 under the auspices of the Royal Philharmonic Society, initially provided an annual award covering the cost of a year&#x27;s study to a single prizewinner. With the advent of additional sponsors, the number and scope of awards has expanded considerably since that time; the list of winners of Ferrier Awards includes many singers of international repute, among them Felicity Palmer, Yvonne Kenny, Lesley Garrett and Bryn Terfel. The Kathleen Ferrier Society, founded in 1993 to promote interest in all aspects of the singer&#x27;s life and work, has since 1996 awarded annual bursaries to students at Britain&#x27;s major music colleges. In 2012, the Society organised a series of events to commemorate the centenary of Ferrier&#x27;s birth and in February 2012 Ferrier was one of ten prominent Britons honoured by the Royal Mail in the &quot;Britons of Distinction&quot; stamps set. Another was Frederick Delius.

A biographic documentary film, &quot;Kathleen Ferrier&quot;, also known as &quot;&quot; was directed by Diane Perelsztejn and produced by ARTE France in 2012. It featured interviews with her near relatives, friends and colleagues to produce a fresh view of her life and contributions to the arts. Kathleen Ferrier Crescent, in Basildon, Essex, is named in her honour.

==Recordings==

Ferrier&#x27;s discography consists of studio recordings originally made on the Columbia and Decca labels, and recordings taken from live performances which were later issued as discs. In the years since her death, many of her recordings have received multiple reissues on modern media; between 1992 and 1996, Decca issued the Kathleen Ferrier Edition, incorporating much of Ferrier&#x27;s recorded repertoire, on 10 compact discs. The discographer Paul Campion has drawn attention to numerous works which she performed but did not record, or for which no complete recording has yet surfaced. For example, only one aria from Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Dream of Gerontius&quot;, and none of her renderings of 20th century songs by Holst, Bax, Delius and others were recorded. Only a small part of her &quot;St John Passion&quot; was captured on disc.

The recording of the unaccompanied Northumbrian folk song &quot;Blow the Wind Southerly&quot;, initially made by Decca in 1949, has been reissued many times and frequently played on radio in shows such as &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, &quot;Housewives&#x27; Choice&quot; and &quot;Your Hundred Best Tunes&quot;. Another signature aria, first recorded in 1944 and on numerous subsequent occasions, is &quot;What is Life?&quot; (&quot;Che farò&quot;) from &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;. These records sold in large numbers rivalling those of other stars of the time, such as Frank Sinatra and Dame Vera Lynn. In the early 21st century, Ferrier&#x27;s recordings were still selling hundreds of thousands of copies each year.

<text>The Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is a major NASA space research laboratory located approximately northeast of Washington, D.C., in Greenbelt, Maryland, United States. Established on May 1, 1959, as NASA&#x27;s first space flight center, GSFC employs about 10,000 civil servants and contractors. Named for American rocket propulsion pioneer Robert H. Goddard, it is one of ten major NASA field centers. GSFC is partially within the former Goddard census-designated place; it has a Greenbelt mailing address.

GSFC is the largest combined organization of scientists and engineers in the United States dedicated to increasing knowledge of the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe via observations from space. GSFC is a major US laboratory for developing and operating uncrewed scientific spacecraft. GSFC conducts scientific investigation, development, manufacturing and operation of space systems, and development of related technologies. Goddard scientists can develop and support a mission, and Goddard engineers and technicians can design and build the spacecraft for that mission. Goddard scientist John C. Mather shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on COBE.

GSFC also operates two spaceflight tracking and data acquisition networks (the Space Network and the Near Earth Network), develops and maintains advanced space and Earth science data information systems, and develops satellite systems for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

GSFC manages operations for many NASA and international missions including the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the Explorers Program, the Discovery Program, the Earth Observing System (EOS), &quot;INTEGRAL&quot;, MAVEN, OSIRIS-REx, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (&quot;SOHO&quot;), the Solar Dynamics Observatory (&quot;SDO&quot;), &quot;Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System&quot; (TDRS)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Fermi&quot;, and &quot;Swift&quot;. Past missions managed by GSFC include the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (&quot;RXTE&quot;), Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, &quot;SMM&quot;, &quot;COBE&quot;, &quot;IUE&quot;, and &quot;ROSAT&quot;.

== History ==

Founded as Beltsville Space Center, Goddard was NASA&#x27;s first of four space centers. Its original charter was to perform five major functions on behalf of NASA: technology development and fabrication, planning, scientific research, technical operations, and project management. The center is organized into several directorates, each charged with one of these key functions.

On May 1, 1959, the center was renamed the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) for Robert H. Goddard. Its first 157 employees transferred from the United States Navy&#x27;s Project Vanguard missile program, and continued their work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., while the center was under construction.

Goddard Space Flight Center contributed to Project Mercury, America&#x27;s first human spaceflight program. The Center assumed a lead role for the project in its early days and managed the first 250 employees involved in the effort, who were stationed at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. However, the size and scope of Project Mercury soon prompted NASA to build a new Manned Spacecraft Center, now the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, Texas. Project Mercury&#x27;s personnel and activities were transferred there in 1961.
Goddard Space Flight Center remained involved in the crewed space flight program, providing computer support and radar tracking of flights through a worldwide network of ground stations called the Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network (STDN). However, the Center focused primarily on designing uncrewed satellites and spacecraft for scientific research missions. Goddard pioneered several fields of spacecraft development, including modular spacecraft design, which reduced costs and made it possible to repair satellites in orbit. Goddard&#x27;s Solar Max satellite, launched in 1980, was repaired by astronauts on the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1984. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, remains in service and continues to grow in capability thanks to its modular design and multiple servicing missions by the Space Shuttle.

Today, the center remains involved in each of NASA&#x27;s key programs. Goddard has developed more instruments for planetary exploration than any other organization, among them scientific instruments sent to every planet in the Solar System. The center&#x27;s contribution to the Earth Science Enterprise includes several spacecraft in the Earth Observing System fleet as well as EOSDIS, a science data collection, processing, and distribution system. For the crewed space flight program, Goddard develops tools for use by astronauts during extra-vehicular activity, and operates the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, a spacecraft designed to study the Moon in preparation for future crewed exploration.

== Missions ==

A fact sheet highlighting many of Goddard&#x27;s previous missions is recorded on a 40th anniversary webpage.

=== Past ===
Goddard has been involved in designing, building, and operating spacecraft since the days of Explorer 1, the nation&#x27;s first artificial satellite. The list of these missions reflects a diverse set of scientific objectives and goals. The Landsat series of spacecraft has been studying the Earth&#x27;s resources since the launch of the first mission in 1972. TIROS-1 launched in 1960 as the first success in a long series of weather satellites. The Spartan platform deployed from the space shuttle, allowing simple, low-cost 2–3 day missions. The second of NASA&#x27;s Great Observatories, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, operated for nine years before re-entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in 2000. Another of Goddard&#x27;s space science observatories, the Cosmic Background Explorer, provided unique scientific data about the early universe.

=== Present ===
Goddard currently supports the operation of dozens of spacecraft collecting scientific data. These missions include Earth science projects like the Earth Observing System (EOS) that includes the Terra, Aqua, and Aura spacecraft flying alongside several projects from other Centers or other countries. Other major Earth science projects that are currently operating include the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Global Precipitation Measurement mission (GPM), missions that provide data critical to hurricane predictions. Many Goddard projects support other organizations, such as the US Geological Survey on Landsat-7 and -8, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system that provide weather predictions.

Other Goddard missions support a variety of space science disciplines. Goddard&#x27;s most famous project is the Hubble Space Telescope, a unique science platform that has been breaking new ground in astronomy for nearly 20 years. Other missions such as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) study the structure and evolution of the universe. Other missions such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) are currently studying the Sun and how its behavior affects life on the Earth. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is mapping out the composition and topography of the Moon and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is tracking the Sun&#x27;s energy and influence on the Earth. The OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission returned a sample from asteroid 101955 Bennu in 2023 and under the name OSIRIS-APEX is headed to asteroid 99942 Apophis in 2029.

Particularly noteworthy operations include the James Webb Space Telescope, which was launched in 2022 and enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies.

=== Future ===
The Goddard community continually works on numerous operations and projects that have launch dates ranging from the upcoming year to a decade down the road. These operations also vary in what scientists hope they will uncover.

===Addressing scientific questions===

NASA&#x27;s missions (and therefore Goddard&#x27;s missions) address a broad range of scientific questions generally classified around four key areas: Earth sciences, astrophysics, heliophysics, and the Solar System. To simplify, Goddard studies Earth and Space.

Within the Earth sciences area, Goddard plays a major role in research to advance our understanding of the Earth as an environmental system, looking at questions related to how the components of that environmental system have developed, how they interact and how they evolve. This is all important to enable scientists to understand the practical impacts of natural and human activities during the coming decades and centuries.

Within Space Sciences, Goddard has distinguished itself with the 2006 Nobel Physics Prize given to John Mather and the COBE mission. Beyond the COBE mission, Goddard studies how the universe formed, what it is made of, how its components interact, and how it evolves. The center also contributes to research seeking to understand how stars and planetary systems form and evolve and studies the nature of the Sun&#x27;s interaction with its surroundings.

===From scientific questions to science missions===

Based on existing knowledge accumulated through previous missions, new science questions are articulated. Missions are developed in the same way an experiment would be developed using the scientific method. In this context, Goddard does not work as an independent entity but rather as one of the 10 NASA centers working together to find answers to these scientific questions.

Each mission starts with a set of scientific questions to be answered, and a set of scientific requirements for the mission, which build on what has already been discovered by prior missions. Scientific requirements spell out the types data that will need to be collected. These scientific requirements are then transformed into mission concepts that start to specify the kind of spacecraft and scientific instruments need to be developed for these scientific questions to be answered.

Within Goddard, the Sciences and Exploration Directorate (SED) leads the center&#x27;s scientific endeavors, including the development of technology related to scientific pursuits.

===Collecting data in space – scientific instruments===

Some of the most important technological advances developed by Goddard (and NASA in general) come from the need to innovate with new scientific instruments in order to be able to observe or measure phenomena in space that have never been measured or observed before. Instrument names tend to be known by their initials. In some cases, the mission&#x27;s name gives an indication of the type of instrument involved. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope is, as its name indicates, a telescope, but it includes a suite of four distinct scientific instruments: Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI); Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam); Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec); Fine Guidance Sensor and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS-NIRISS). Scientists at Goddard work closely with the engineers to develop these instruments.

Typically, a mission consists of a spacecraft with an instrument suite (multiple instruments) on board. In some cases, the scientific requirements dictate the need for multiple spacecraft. For example, the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) studies magnetic reconnection, a 3-D process. In order to capture data about this complex 3-D process, a set of four spacecraft fly in a tetrahedral formation. Each of the four spacecraft carries identical instrument suites. MMS is part of a larger program (Solar Terrestrial Probes) that studies the impact of the Sun on the Solar System.

===Scientific collaborations===

In many cases, Goddard works with partners (US Government agencies, aerospace industry, university-based research centers, other countries) that are responsible for developing the scientific instruments. In other cases, Goddard develops one or more of the instruments. The individual instruments are then integrated into an instrument suite which is then integrated with the spacecraft. In the case of MMS, for example, Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) was responsible for developing the scientific instruments and Goddard provides overall project management, mission systems engineering, the spacecraft, and mission operations.

On the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), six instruments have been developed by a range of partners. One of the instruments, the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), was developed by Goddard. LOLA measures landing site slopes and lunar surface roughness in order to generate a 3-D map of the Moon.

Another mission to be managed by Goddard is MAVEN. MAVEN is the second mission within the Mars Scout Program that is exploring the atmosphere of Mars in support of NASA&#x27;s broader efforts to go to Mars. MAVEN carries eight instruments to measure characteristics of Mars&#x27; atmospheric gases, upper atmosphere, solar wind, and ionosphere. Instrument development partners include the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the University of California, Berkeley. Goddard contributed overall project management as well as two of the instruments, two magnetometers.

===Managing scientific data===

Once a mission is launched and reaches its destination, its instruments start collecting data. The data is transmitted back to Earth where it needs to be analyzed and stored for future reference. Goddard manages large collections of scientific data resulting from past and ongoing missions.

The Earth Science Division hosts the Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC). It offers Earth science data, information, and services to research scientists, applications scientists, applications users, and students.

The NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive (NSSDCA), created at Goddard in 1966, hosts a permanent archive of space science data, including a large collection of images from space.

== Spinoff technologies ==

Section 102(d) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 calls for &quot;the establishment of long-range studies of the potential benefits to be gained from, the opportunities for, and the problems involved in the utilization of aeronautical and space activities for peaceful and scientific purposes.&quot; Because of this mandate, the Technology Utilization Program was established in 1962 which required technologies to be brought down to Earth and commercialized in order to help the US economy and improve the quality of life.

Documentation of these technologies that were spun off started in 1976 with &quot;Spinoff 1976&quot;. Since then, NASA has produced a yearly publication of these spinoff technologies through the Innovative Partnerships Program Office.

Goddard Space Flight Center has made significant contributions to the US economy and quality of life with the technologies it has spun off. Here are some examples: Weather balloon technology has helped firefighters with its short-range radios; aluminized Mylar in satellites has made sports equipment more insulated; laser optics systems have transformed the camera industry and life detection missions on other planets help scientists find bacteria in contaminated food.

== Facilities ==
Goddard&#x27;s partly wooded campus is northeast of Washington, D.C., in Prince George&#x27;s County. The center is on Greenbelt Road, which is Maryland Route 193. Baltimore, Annapolis, and NASA Headquarters in Washington are 30–45 minutes away by highway. Greenbelt also has a train station with access to the Washington Metro system and the MARC commuter train&#x27;s Camden line.

=== Testing chambers and Manufacturing Buildings ===
The High Bay Cleanroom located in building 29 is the world&#x27;s largest ISO 7 cleanroom with of space. Vacuum chambers in adjacent buildings 10 and 7 can be chilled or heated to ±. Adjacent building 15 houses the High Capacity Centrifuge which is capable of generating 30G on up to a load.

Parsons Corporation assisted in the construction of the Class 10,000 cleanroom to support Hubble Space Telescope as well as other Goddard missions.

=== High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center ===
The High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC) is NASA&#x27;s designated center for the archiving and dissemination of high energy astronomy data and information. Information on X-ray and gamma ray astronomy and related NASA mission archives are maintained for public information and science access.

=== Software Assurance Technology Center ===
The Software Assurance Technology Center (SATC) is a NASA department founded in 1992 as part of their Systems Reliability and Safety Office at Goddard Space Flight Center. Its purpose was &quot;to become a center of excellence in software assurance, dedicated to making measurable improvement in both the quality and reliability of software developed for NASA at GSFC&quot;. The center has been the source of research papers on software metrics, assurance, and risk management.

=== Near Space Operations Control Center (NSOCC) ===
While NASA was in the midst of the Gemini mission era there was a need for a new kind of operations hub and the Manned Space Flight Network Control Center (MSFNOCC) was created in building 13. The name has changed over the years and as such, the capability has grown; the facility has been the GSFC hub for human space flight and launch vehicle missions for years and has the distinct honor of having supported every single Shuttle mission.

After the MSFNOCC, the facility was renamed to the Network Control Center (NCC). It remained the NCC until 1997-1999 when the NIC was born. The NIC supported the beginning of the new age of growing space communications which included the International Space Station (ISS). The facility was later renovated from the floor up to become the Near Space Operations Control Center (NSOCC) in 2023. The NSOCC currently provides critical mission support for various launch efforts including SpaceX Crew &amp; Cargo, Science missions such as JWST &amp; PACE, and provides critical data services for Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and European Space Agency (ESA).

The NSOCC provides a console based workspace for various network elements to collaborate and provide the highest possible level of service to NASA and its customers. Some of the network elements included in the NSOCC support structure are Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF), Human Space Flight (HSF), Launch Vehicles (LV), and Robotics mission support leadership, Search and Rescue (SAR), and “Data Acquisition Processing and Handling Network Environment (DAPHNE+).

=== Goddard Visitor Center ===

The Goddard Visitor Center is open to the public Tuesdays through Sundays, free of charge, and features displays of spacecraft and technologies developed there. The Hubble Space Telescope is represented by models and deep space imagery from recent missions. The center also features a Science On a Sphere projection system.

The center also features an Educator&#x27;s Resource Center available for use by teachers and education volunteers such as Boy and Girl Scout leaders, and hosts special events during the year. As an example, in September 2008 the Center opened its gates for Goddard LaunchFest. The event, free to the public, included; robot competitions, tours of Goddard facilities hosted by NASA employees, and live entertainment on the Goddard grounds. GSFC also has a large ballroom for guest events such as lectures, presentations and dinner parties.

=== External facilities ===
GSFC operates three facilities that are not located at the Greenbelt site. These facilities are:
*The Wallops Flight Facility located in Wallops Island, Virginia, was established in 1945, and is one of the oldest launch sites in the world. Wallops manages NASA&#x27;s sounding rocket program, and supports approximately 35 missions each year.
*The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) located at Columbia University in New York City, where much of the center&#x27;s theoretical research is conducted. Operated in close association with Columbia and other area universities, the institute provides support research in geophysics, astrophysics, astronomy and meteorology.
*The Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility (IV&amp;V) in Fairmont, West Virginia, was established in 1993 to improve the safety, reliability, and quality of software used in NASA missions.

GSFC is also responsible for the White Sands Complex, a set of two sites in Las Cruces, New Mexico, but the site is owned by Johnson Space Center as part of the White Sands Test Facility.

== Employees ==
Goddard Space Flight Center has a workforce of over 3,000 civil servant employees, 60% of whom are engineers and scientists. There are approximately 7,000 supporting contractors on site every day. It is one of the largest concentrations of the world&#x27;s premier space scientists and engineers. The center is organized into eight directorates, which includes Applied Engineering and Technology, Flight Projects, Science and Exploration, and Safety &amp; Mission Assurance.

Co-op students from universities in all 50 States can be found around the campus every season through the Cooperative Education Program. During the summers, programs such as the Summer Institute in Engineering and Computer Applications (SIECA) and Excellence through Challenging Exploration and Leadership (EXCEL) provide internship opportunities to students from the US and territories such as Puerto Rico to learn and partake in challenging scientific and engineering work.

== Community ==
The Goddard Space Flight Center maintains ties with local area communities through external volunteer and educational programs. Employees are encouraged to take part in mentoring programs and take on speaking roles at area schools. On Center, Goddard hosts regular colloquiums in engineering, leadership and science. These events are open to the general public, but attendees must sign up in advance to procure a visitors pass for access to the center&#x27;s main grounds. Passes can be obtained at the security office main gate on Greenbelt Road.

Goddard also hosts several different internship opportunities, including NASA DEVELOP at Goddard Space Flight Center.

== Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s visit ==
Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and her husband Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Goddard Space Flight Center on Tuesday, May 8, 2007. The tour of Goddard was near the end of the Queen&#x27;s visit to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown in Virginia. The Queen spoke with crew aboard the International Space Station from the Network Integration Center (NIC, now NSOCC) located in Building 13.

<text>The Langley Research Center (LaRC or NASA Langley), located in Hampton, Virginia, near the Chesapeake Bay front of Langley Air Force Base, is the oldest of NASA&#x27;s field centers. LaRC has focused primarily on aeronautical research but has also tested space hardware such as the Apollo Lunar Module. In addition, many of the earliest high-profile space missions were planned and designed on-site. Langley was also considered a potential site for NASA&#x27;s Manned Spacecraft Center prior to the eventual selection of Houston, Texas.

Established in 1917 by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the research center devotes two-thirds of its programs to aeronautics and the rest to space. LaRC researchers use more than 40 wind tunnels to study and improve aircraft and spacecraft safety, performance, and efficiency. Between 1958 and 1963, when NASA (the successor agency to NACA) started Project Mercury, LaRC served as the main office of the Space Task Group.

In September 2019, after previously serving as associate director and deputy director, Clayton P. Turner was appointed director of NASA Langley.

== History ==
After U.S.-German relations had deteriorated from neutral to hostile around 1916, the prospect of U.S. war entry became possible. On February 15, 1917, the newly established &quot;Aviation Week&quot; warned that the U.S. military aviation capability was less than what was operating in the European war. President Woodrow Wilson sent Jerome Hunsaker to Europe to investigate, and Hunsaker&#x27;s report prompted Wilson to command the creation of the nation&#x27;s first aeronautics laboratory, which became NASA Langley. 

In 1917, less than three years after it was created, the NACA established the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory on Langley Field. Both Langley Field and the Langley Laboratory are named after aviation pioneer Samuel Pierpont Langley. The Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps had established a base there earlier that same year. The first research facilities were in place and aeronautical research was started by 1920. Initially, the laboratory included four researchers and 11 technicians.
Langley Field and NACA began parallel growth as air power proved its utility during World War I. The center was originally established to explore the field of aerodynamic research involving airframe and propulsion engine design and performance. In 1934 the world&#x27;s largest wind tunnel was constructed at Langley Field with a test section; it was large enough to test full-scale aircraft. It remained the world&#x27;s largest wind tunnel until the 1940s, when a tunnel was built at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center in California.

The West Area Computers were African American, female mathematicians who worked as human computers at the Langley Research Center from 1943 through 1958. The West Computers were originally subject to Virginia&#x27;s Jim Crow laws and got their name because they worked at Langley&#x27;s West Area, while the white mathematicians worked in the East section.

Early in 1945, the center expanded to include rocket research, leading to the establishment of a flight station at Wallops Island, Virginia. A further expansion of the research program permitted Langley Research Center to orbit payloads, starting with NASA&#x27;s Explorer 9 balloon satellite in mid-February 1961. As rocket research grew, aeronautics research continued to expand and played an important part when subsonic flight was advanced and supersonic and hypersonic flight were introduced.

Langley Research Center claims many historic firsts, some of which have proven to be revolutionary scientific breakthroughs. These accomplishments include: Development of the concept of research aircraft leading to supersonic flight, the world&#x27;s first transonic wind tunnel, training the first crews of astronauts, the Lunar Landing Facility which provides the simulation of lunar gravity, and the Viking program for Mars exploration. The center also developed standards for the grooving of aircraft runways based on a previous British design used at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Grooved runways reduce aquaplaning which permits better grip by aircraft tires in heavy rain. This grooving is now the international standard for all runways around the world.

Langley was also a contender for the site of NASA Mission Control, prior to the eventual selection of Houston, due to Langley&#x27;s prominence with NASA at the time, the large existing aerospace industry already present in the Hampton Roads region, and the proximity to Washington, D.C. The selection of Houston actually took many higher-ups at Langley by surprise and caused some lingering controversy in the surrounding area over the loss and transfer of so many jobs to Houston. Though they had lost out on the Manned Spacecraft Center, Langley still played an important role in conducting research and training during the Apollo Program.

==Aeronautics==
Langley Research Center performs critical research on aeronautics, including wake vortex behavior, fixed-wing aircraft, rotary wing aircraft, aviation safety, human factors and aerospace engineering. LaRC supported the design and testing of the hypersonic X-43, which achieved a world speed record of . LaRC assisted the NTSB in the investigation of the crash of American Airlines Flight 587.

Work began in July 2011 to remove the 1940s era transonic wind tunnel. The facility supported development and propulsion integration research for many military aircraft including all fighters since 1960 (F-14, F-15, F-16, F-18 and the Joint Strike Fighter) but had been inactive since 2004. Langley retained transonic wind tunnel testing capabilities facilities in the National Transonic Facility, a high pressure, cryogenically cooled closed loop wind tunnel.

==Fabrication research and development==
===Plastic fabrication===
LaRC also houses a large collection of various inexpensive plastic reformation machines. These machines are used in the freeform fabrication department for faster timing, better precision, and larger quantities of low-cost toys, model, and industrial plastic parts. The fabrication of plastic parts is similar to the EBF³ process but with a thin, grated heating element as its melting apparatus. Both are run by CAD data and deal with various freeform fabrication of raw materials.

==Astronautics==

=== Moon ===
Since the start of Project Gemini, Langley was a center for training of rendezvous in space. In 1965, Langley opened the Lunar Landing Research Facility for simulations of Moon landings with a mock Apollo Lunar Module suspended from a gantry over a simulated lunar landscape. There was experimental work on some Lunar Landing Research Vehicles (LLRV).

=== Mars ===
Langley Research Center supported NASA&#x27;s mission with the designing of a spacecraft for a landing on Mars. (see the Mars Exploration Rover.)

===Earth science===
Langley Research Center conducts Earth science research to support NASA&#x27;s mission.

==Awards==
LRC scientists and engineers have won the Collier Trophy 5 times, listed below.

* 1929: for the development of low-drag cowling for radial air-cooled aircraft engines.
* 1946: to Lewis A. Rodert, Lawrence D. Bell and Chuck Yeager for the development of an efficient wing deicing system.
* 1947: to John Stack of the then Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory for research to determine the physical laws affecting supersonic flight. Lawrence D. Bell and Chuck Yeager also shared in this trophy for their work on supersonic flight.
* 1951: to John Stack for the development and use of the slotted-throat wind tunnel.
* 1954: to Richard T. Whitcomb for the development of the Whitcomb area rule, according to the citation, a &quot;powerful, simple, and useful method of reducing greatly the sharp increase in wing drag heretofore associated with transonic flight, and which constituted a major factor requiring great reserves of power to attain supersonic speeds.&quot;

<doc id="337038" wikidata="Q1066288" url="?curid=337038" title="Figurine">
<text>A figurine (a diminutive form of the word &quot;figure&quot;) or statuette is a small, three-dimensional sculpture that represents a human, deity or animal, or, in practice, a pair or small group of them. Figurines have been made in many media, with clay, metal, wood, glass, and today plastic or resin the most significant. Ceramic figurines not made of porcelain are called terracottas in historical contexts.

Figures with movable parts, allowing limbs to be posed, are more likely to be called dolls, mannequins, or action figures; or robots or automata, if they can move on their own. Figurines and miniatures are sometimes used in board games, such as chess, and tabletop role playing games.

The main difference between a figurine and a statue is size. There is no agreed limit, but typically objects are called &quot;figurines&quot; up to a height of perhaps , though most types are less than high.

==Prehistory==

In China, there are extant Neolithic figurines.

European prehistoric figurines of women, some appearing pregnant, are called Venus figurines, because of their presumed connection to fertility. The two oldest known examples are made of stone, were found in Africa and Asia, and are several hundred thousand years old. Many made of fired clay have been found in Europe that date to 25–30,000 BC, and are the oldest ceramics known.

Olmec figurines in semi-precious stones and pottery had a wide influence all over Mesoamerica about 1000–500 BC, and were apparently usually kept in houses.

These early figurines are among the first signs of human culture. One cannot know in some cases how they were used. They probably had religious or ceremonial significance and may have been used in many types of rituals. Many are found in burials. Some may have been worn as jewelry or intended to amuse children.

==History==

Porcelain and other ceramics are common materials for figurines. Ancient Greek terracotta figurines, made in moulds, were a large industry by the Hellenistic period, and ones in bronze also very common. In Roman art bronze came to predominate. Most of these were religious, and deposited in large numbers in temples as votive offerings, or kept in the home and sometimes buried with their owner. But types such as Tanagra figurines included many purely decorative subjects, such as fashionable ladies. There are many early examples from China, mainly religious figures in Dehua porcelain, which drove the experimentation in Europe to replicate the process.

The first European porcelain figurines, were produced in Meissen porcelain, initially in a plain glazed white, but soon brightly painted in overglaze &quot;enamels&quot;, and were soon produced by nearly all European porcelain factories. The initial function of these seems to have been as permanent versions of sugar sculptures which were used to decorate tables on special occasions by European elites, but they soon found a place on mantelpieces and side tables. There was already some production of earthenware figures in English delftware and stoneware, for example by John Dwight of the Fulham Pottery in London, and after 1720 such figures became more popular. By around 1750 pottery figures were being produced in large numbers all over Europe. Staffordshire figures were cheaper versions in earthenware, and by the late 19th century especially noted for Staffordshire dog figurines.

Genre figurines of gallant scenes, beggars or figurines of saints are carved from pinewood in Val Gardena, South Tyrol (Italy), since the 17th century.

Significant types:
*Ushabti – Ancient Egypt, mostly placed in tombs
*Olmec figurine
*Psi and phi type figurine – Mycenaean Greece
*Euphrates Syrian Pillar Figurines and Horses and Riders – Iron Age
*Tanagra figurines – Hellenistic Greece
*Tang dynasty tomb figures – China, –755
*Mississippian stone statuary – –1600
*Staffordshire figures – England, 1720 to present
*Santons – Provence, France, 18th century to present
*Animal figurines
*Model figure

==Modern era==
Modern figurines, particularly those made of plastic, are often referred to as &quot;figures&quot;. They can encompass modern action figures and other model figures as well as Precious Moments figurines and Hummel figurines, Bobbleheads, Sebastian Miniatures and other kinds of memorabilia. Some companies which produce porcelain figurines are Royal Doulton, Lladró and Camal Enterprises.

Figurines of comic book or sci-fi/fantasy characters without movable parts have been referred to by the terms &quot;inaction figures&quot; (originally used to describe Kevin Smith&#x27;s View Askew figurines) and &quot;staction figures&quot; (a portmanteau of statue and action figures coined by Four Horsemen artists to describe &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; figures). Also Amiibo is a line of plastic figurines with NFC tags embedded to its base that can be used in order to interact with certain videogames for Nintendo consoles.

There is also a hobby known as mini war gaming in which players use figurines (for example toy soldiers) in table top based games. These figurines are mostly made of plastic and pewter. However, some premium models are made of resin.

Figurines can also represent racial and ethnic slurs, for example, Jew with a coin figurines, and Mammy figurines.

<doc id="337043" wikidata="Q17142811" url="?curid=337043" title="Rollout photography">
<text>Rollout photography, a type of peripheral photography, is a process used to create a two-dimensional photographic image of a three-dimensional object. This process is the photographic equivalent of a cylindrical map projection in cartography. It is used predominantly for the projection of images of cylindrical objects such as vases or ceramic vessels. The objective of this process is to present to the observer a planar representation of the object&#x27;s characteristics, most notably the illustrations or artwork extant on the outside surfaces of such vessels. This planar representation is captured using photographic imaging techniques.

==Technique==
In the basic technique, using strip photography, a camera with a vertical slit aperture is positioned opposite a turntable on which an object is centered. Both the object and the camera are oriented as precisely as possible so as to eliminate aberrations due to the focusing mechanism of the camera, the aperture, and the characteristics of the object itself. As the object is rotated on the turntable, the film is exposed in small intervals corresponding to the dimensions of the aperture. Since the image is projected onto the film backwards and upside down, the turntable spins in the direction opposite of the direction of the film advance mechanism.

==History==

In 1972, Justin Kerr worked with author &amp; anthropologist Michael D. Coe to produce a book on ceramic vessels of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization. For this book Kerr had to photograph the ceramics section by section, and then have an artist combine the pictures into one. Since this was slow and did not accurately reproduce the images on the pottery, Kerr set out to find a technique that would make a single, fluid picture. However, at this time no cameras existed that were capable of making peripheral photographs. Therefore, from 1972 to 1978, Kerr created a new camera and essentially reinvented the art of rollout photography.

The technique had existed for years, so by using the methods listed above Justin Kerr succeeded in making a camera that captured the first Maya pottery vessel using rollout photography. The rollout technique was perfected through the use of a record turntable, clamps, and various pieces of wood and belts. The result was a clear and accurate reproduction of a tin can. From there Kerr moved on to Maya vessels. Each vase takes about two minutes to photograph, and is done all in one session. Kerr spends on average 6 hours a day in his studio working on Maya rollouts. Subsequently, Kerr began archiving every container he photographed. To date more than 1400 rollouts have been created. His first successful print was of an Olmec bowl, lent to him from Princeton University.

<doc id="337044" wikidata="Q622135" url="?curid=337044" title="Audi alteram partem">
<text>&#x27; (or &#x27;) is a Latin phrase meaning &quot;listen to the other side&quot;, or &quot;let the other side be heard as well&quot;. It is the principle that no person should be judged without a fair hearing in which each party is given the opportunity to respond to the evidence against them.

&quot;Audi alteram partem&quot; is considered to be a principle of fundamental justice or equity or the principle of natural justice in most legal systems. This principle includes the rights of a party or its lawyers to confront the witnesses against them, to have a fair opportunity to challenge the evidence presented by the other party, to summon one&#x27;s own witnesses and to present evidence, and to have counsel, if necessary at public expense, in order to make one&#x27;s case properly.

==History of use==
As a general principle of rationality in reaching conclusions in disputed matters, &quot;Hear both sides&quot; was treated as part of common wisdom by the ancient Greek dramatists. A similar principle can also be found in Islamic law, based on a hadith indicating that in litigation, both parties must be heard. The principle was referred to by the International Court of Justice in the &quot;Nuclear Tests&quot; case, referring to France&#x27;s non-appearance at judgment. Modern legal systems differ on whether individuals can be convicted &quot;in absentia&quot;. The principle is used in labour law matters in countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe.

The phrase, in its Latin form, is the official motto of the Supreme Court of Illinois.

==Other uses==
The phrase is also the origin of the name of German carmaker Audi. Founder August Horch had left his previous company, Motorwagenwerke, after a dispute with partners and founded a new company on 16 July 1909, initially named the &quot;August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH&quot;. His former partners sued him for trademark infringement, and the German Reichsgericht (Supreme Court) ruled that the Horch brand belonged to his former company. Horch therefore called a meeting with close business friends Paul and Franz Fikentscher, to come up with a new name for the company. During this meeting, Franz&#x27;s son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally blurted out, &quot;Father – &quot;audiatur et altera pars&quot;... wouldn&#x27;t it be a good idea to call it &quot;audi&quot; instead of &quot;horch&quot;?&quot; &quot;Horch!&quot; in German means &quot;Hark!&quot; or &quot;hear&quot;, which is &quot;Audi&quot; in the singular imperative form of &quot;audire&quot; – &quot;to listen&quot; – in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting, and the company was registered as &quot;Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau&quot; in 1910.

<text>Cypselus (, &quot;Kypselos&quot;) was the first tyrant of Corinth in the 7th century BC.

With increased wealth and more complicated trade relations and social structures, Greek city-states tended to overthrow their traditional hereditary priest-kings; Corinth, the richest archaic &quot;polis,&quot; led the way. Like the &quot;signori&quot; of late medieval and Renaissance Italy, the tyrants usually seized power at the head of some popular support. Often the tyrants upheld existing laws and customs and were highly conservative as to cult practices, thus maintaining stability with little risk to their own personal security. As in Renaissance Italy, a cult of personality naturally substituted for the divine right of the former legitimate royal house.

After the last traditional king of Corinth, Telestes, was assassinated by Arieus and Perantas, there were no more kings; instead &quot;prytanes&quot; taken from the former royal house of the Bacchiadae ruled for a single year each. Cypselus, the son of Eëtion and a disfigured woman named Labda, who was a member of the Bacchiad family, the ruling dynasty, usurped power, became tyrant and expelled the Bacchiadae.

According to Herodotus the Bacchiadae heard two prophecies from the Delphic oracle that the son of Eëtion would overthrow their dynasty, and they planned to kill the baby once it was born; however, Herodotus says that the newborn smiled at each of the men sent to kill it, and none of them could go through with the plan. An etiological myth-element, to account for the name Cypselus (cf. κυψέλη, &quot;kypsele&quot;, &quot;chest&quot;) accounted how Labda then hid the baby in a chest, and when the men had composed themselves and returned to kill it, they could not find it. (Compare the infancy of Perseus.) The cedar Chest of Cypselus, richly worked with mythological narratives and adorned with ivory and gold, was a votive offering at Olympia, where Pausanias gave it a detailed description in his 2nd century AD travel guide.

When Cypselus had grown up, he fulfilled the prophecy. Corinth had been involved in wars with Argos and Corcyra, and the Corinthians were unhappy with their rulers. At the time, around 657 BC, Cypselus was polemarch, the archon in charge of the military, and he used his influence with the soldiery to expel the Bacchiadae. He also expelled his other enemies, but allowed them to set up colonies in northwestern Greece. He also increased trade with the colonies in Italy and Sicily.

He ruled for thirty years and in 627 BC was succeeded as tyrant by his son Periander, who was considered one of the Seven Sages of Greece. The treasury Cypselus built at Delphi was apparently still standing in the time of Herodotus.
Cypselus&#x27; second son Gorgus became tyrant of the Corinthian colony Ambracia, followed after his death by his son Periander of Ambracia. Another known Cypselid from Ambracia was named Archinus, whose wife later married Peisistratus of Athens. While some consider him a tyrant as well, the sources are not definite, and there is no reason to believe Ambracia had any Cypselid tyrants other than the aforementioned two. Cypselus&#x27; other grandson by Gorgus was Psammetich, who followed the sage Periander as the last tyrant of Corinth.

<text>Thomas Stevens (24 December 1854 – 24 January 1935) was the first person to circle the globe by bicycle. He rode a large-wheeled Ordinary, also known as a penny-farthing, from April 1884 to December 1886. He later searched for Henry Morton Stanley in Africa, investigated the claims of Indian ascetics and became manager of the Garrick Theatre in London.

== Origins ==

Stevens, known as Tom, was born in Castle Street, Berkhamsted, the son of William and Ann Stevens. His father was a labourer. Thomas had an older sister, Bridget, and younger, Jane. He went to Bourne Charity School, then became an apprentice grocer. His father emigrated to Missouri in 1868 but returned when his wife became ill and before the rest of the family could also go to America. Tom went with a half-brother but without his parents and sisters in 1871 and the rest of the family followed two years later. They moved to Denver and then to San Francisco, where he learned to ride a bicycle.

&quot;Adventure Cyclist&quot; described him as &quot;a man of medium height, wearing an oversized
blue flannel shirt over blue overalls, which were tucked into a pair of leggings at the knee [and] tanned
&#x27;as a nut&#x27;. A mustache protruded from his face.&quot; It said: &quot;A two-year stint in a Wyoming railroad mill ended when he was run out of town after it became known that he was importing British labourers in exchange for part of their salaries. He later found work in a Colorado mine where he came up with the idea of riding a bicycle across the country.&quot;

== Around the World ==
=== America ===
In 1884 he acquired a black-enameled Columbia 50-inch &#x27;Standard&#x27; penny-farthing with nickel-plated wheels, built by the Pope Manufacturing Company of Chicago. He packed his handlebar bag with socks, a spare shirt, a raincoat that doubled as tent and bedroll, and a pocket revolver (described as a &quot;bull-dog revolver&quot;, perhaps a British Bull Dog revolver) and left San Francisco at 8 o&#x27;clock on 22 April 1884. From Sacramento, Stevens travelled through the Sierra Nevada Mountains to Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. En route, he was greeted by members of local bicycle clubs, most prominently the president of a chapter of the League of American Wheelmen in Laramie, Wyoming. He had never seen North America east of the Mississippi. He reached Boston after 3,700 miles on wagon trails, railways, canal towpaths and public roads, to complete the first transcontinental bicycle ride on 4 August 1884.

&quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; reported: &quot;More than one-third of the route followed by Mr. Stevens had to be walked. Eighty-three and a half days of actual travel and twenty days&#x27; stoppage for wet weather, etc., made one hundred and three and a half days occupied in reaching Boston, the distance by wagon-road being about 3,700 miles. He followed the old California trail most of the way across the plains and mountains, astonishing the Indians, and meeting with many strange adventures.&quot;

Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who heard Stevens speak at the Massachusetts Bicycle Club, said: &quot;He seemed like Jules Verne, telling his own wonderful performances, or like a contemporary Sinbad the Sailor. We found that modern mechanical invention, instead of disenchanting the universe, had really afforded the means of exploring its marvels the more surely. Instead of going round the world with a rifle, for the purpose of killing something – or with a bundle of tracts, in order to convert somebody – this bold youth simply went round the globe to see the people who were on it; and since he always had something to show them as interesting as anything that they could show him, he made his way among all nations.&quot;

=== Europe ===
Stevens passed the winter in New York and contributed sketches of his transcontinental trip to &quot;Outing&quot;, a cycling magazine. It made him a special correspondent and sent him on the steamer &quot;City of Chicago&quot; to Liverpool. He landed there 10 days later, on 9 April 1885. He left his bicycle in the underground storerooms of the London and North Western Railway and went by train to London to arrange his crossing of Europe and to investigate conditions in Asia. He was helped by an interpreter at the Chinese embassy who discouraged him from riding across Upper Burma and China.

He returned to Liverpool on 30 April 1885 and on 4 May made a formal start to his ride at Edge Hill church, where several hundred people watched him leave. He wrote:
: A small sea of hats is enthusiastically waved aloft; a ripple of applause escaped from 500 English throats as I mount my glistening bicycle; and with the assistance of a few policemen, 25 Liverpool cyclers who have assembled to accompany me out extricate themselves from the crowd, mount, and fall into line two abreast; and merrily we wheel down Edge-lane and out of Liverpool.

It began raining within minutes.

He rode, wearing a white military helmet through England, passing through Berkhamsted, where he had been born. He recorded that roads in England were better than in America. He took the ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe to cross to France and continued through Germany; Austria; Hungary, where he picked up a temporary cycling companion with whom he shared no language; Slavonia; Serbia; Bulgaria; Rumelia; and Turkey.

In Constantinople he rested among people who had heard of America, refitted with spare spokes, tires and other parts and a better pistol (a .38-calibre Smith &amp; Wesson), waited for reports of banditry to subside, and then pedalled off through Anatolia, Armenia, Kurdistan, Iraq and Iran, where he waited out the winter in Teheran as a guest of the Shah, Naser al-Din.

=== Afghanistan ===
Having been refused permission to travel through Siberia, he set off on 10 March 1886 through Afghanistan although its borders were closed to foreigners and its guards had a fierce reputation. Upon entering the country, Stevens was arrested. As guards took him to his place of detainment, he entertained them with a demonstration of his bicycle, pedalling far ahead of them until an officer caught up on horse and had him wait for the on-foot soldiers to catch up.

He was kept in a villa where he was fed well and given new boots, soap and biscuits imported from England. A fine horse was kept in the garden aside his quarters that he might enjoy looking at.

Finally ejected from Afghanistan, Stevens was accompanied back to Persia. Again, he was allowed to speed ahead of his captors so long as he stopped and waited for them occasionally. Eventually, however, the soldiers grew nervous and disassembled his bicycle, strapping the pieces to a packhorse, which later laid upon the larger wheel, breaking many spokes, the most severe damage the penny-farthing experienced upon the trip. Afghan gunsmiths drilled new holes and stretched new spokes. Some spokes remained subpar, though sufficient to complete the thousands of miles yet ahead.

=== Asia ===

He took a Russian steamer across the Caspian to Baku, a rail to Batoum, and a steamer to Constantinople and India. In the Red Sea his knowledge of mules was useful to the British Army. He cycled across India, noting that the weather was always hot and the Grand Trunk Road was excellent wheeling and free from bandits. Much of his description of life in India, however, suffers from being based on the opinions of experts rather than his own observations. Another steamer brought him from Calcutta to Hong Kong and southern China. He pedalled to eastern China, encountering great difficulty in asking directions in a language he couldn&#x27;t pronounce. A Chinese official gave him refuge from rioters who were angry over a war with the French. From the coast he took a steamer to Japan, where he delighted in the calm of that country. The bicycle part of his journey around the world ends 17 December 1886, at Yokohama. His itinerary accounts &quot;DISTANCE ACTUALLY WHEELED, ABOUT 13,500 MILES&quot;. Stevens returned by steamer to San Francisco, in January 1887.

Stevens&#x27; travels through Japan were reported in the &quot;Jijishinpou&quot; newspaper.
Along the way, Stevens sent a series of letters to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; detailing his experiences and later collected those experiences into a two-volume book of 1,000 pages, &quot;Around the World on a Bicycle&quot;, which is available in a single-volume paperback and publicly available at digital library projects. The price of an original has been estimated at between US$300 and US$400.

The Pope Company preserved Stevens&#x27;s bicycle until World War II, when it was donated to a scrap drive to support the war effort.

== The search for Stanley ==
The &quot;New York World&quot; asked Thomas in 1888 to join its search in East Africa for the explorer Henry Morton Stanley. Stanley had travelled up the Congo but a year and a half had passed without news. Stevens called it &quot;a grand opportunity; the one chance, mayhap, of a lifetime, to spring into fame on the stage of African exploit. How would &quot;I Found Stanley&quot; look in the libraries with &quot;I Found Livingstone&quot;?&quot;

Stevens left New York by ship on 5 January 1889. His instructions, he said, were:
: Go to Zanzibar. Investigate the state of affairs there. Let us know the truth about the troubles between the Germans and the Arabs. See what is to be seen of the slave trade. Find out all you can about Stanley and Emin Pasha, and, if necessary or advisable, organise an expedition and penetrate the interior for reliable news of the Emin Pasha Relief expedition. Spare no expense in carrying out the main object of the enterprise, but at the same time don&#x27;t throw money away recklessly.

Stevens led a six-month expedition, writing for the newspaper of climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and hunting big game. He found Stanley&#x27;s camp in a race with the rival &quot;New York Herald&quot; and wrote his memoir, &quot;Scouting for Stanley in East Africa&quot;. It concluded:
: By the end of February 1890, I was again in New York. I had been gone fourteen months. I had not &#x27;found Stanley,&#x27; as Stanley had found Livingstone in 1871; the circumstances were altogether different. I had, however, gratified a pardonable journalistic ambition in being the first correspondent to reach him and to give him news of the world, after his long period of African darkness. That I had done this under most trying conditions, Mr. Stanley fully appreciated; and warmly reciprocated by showing me every courtesy in his power, on the march to the coast, in Zanzibar, and in Egypt.

Stevens then reported from Russia, sailed the rivers of Europe, and investigated miracles claimed by Indian ascetics. His conclusions that &quot;the stories of travelers, from Marco Polo to the latest witness of Indian miracles ... are quite true&quot; were greeted with scepticism and his career faltered. A planned tour of London with his Indian photographs fell through.

== Return to England ==
Stevens returned to England around 1895 and married Frances Barnes (née Nation), widowed mother of the actresses Irene and Violet Vanbrugh. He became manager of the Garrick Theatre in London. He died in London of cancer of the bladder and was buried at St Marylebone Cemetery in East Finchley, London.

<doc id="337065" wikidata="Q5421286" url="?curid=337065" title="Exploding-bridgewire detonator">
<text>The exploding-bridgewire detonator (EBW, also known as exploding wire detonator) is a type of detonator used to initiate the detonation reaction in explosive materials, similar to a blasting cap because it is fired using an electric current. EBWs use a different physical mechanism than blasting caps, using more electricity delivered much more rapidly. They explode with more precise timing after the electric current is applied by the process of exploding wire. The precise timing of exploding wire detonators compared with other types of detonators has led to their common use in nuclear weapons.

The slapper detonator is a more recent development along similar lines.

== History ==
The EBW was invented by Luis Alvarez and Lawrence Johnston for the Fat Man–type bombs of the Manhattan Project, during their work in Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Fat Man Model 1773 EBW detonators used an unusual, high reliability detonator system with two EBW &quot;horns&quot; attached to a single booster charge, which then fired each of the 32 explosive lens units.

== Description ==

EBWs were developed as a means of detonating multiple explosive charges simultaneously, mainly for use in plutonium-based nuclear weapons in which a plutonium core (called a &quot;pit&quot;) is compressed very rapidly. This is achieved via conventional explosives placed uniformly around the pit. The implosion must be highly symmetrical or the plutonium would simply be ejected at the low-pressure points. Consequently, the detonators must have very precise timing.

An EBW has two main parts: a piece of fine wire which contacts the explosive, and a high-voltage high-current low-impedance electricity source; it must reliably and consistently supply a rapid starting pulse. When the wire is connected across this voltage, the resulting high current melts and then vaporizes the wire in a few microseconds. The resulting shock and heat initiate the high explosive.

This accounts for the heavy cables seen in photos of the Trinity &quot;Gadget&quot;; high voltage cable requires good insulation and they had to deliver a large current with little voltage drop, lest the EBW not achieve the phase transition quickly enough.

The precise timing of EBWs is achieved by the detonator using direct physical effects of the vaporized bridgewire to initiate detonation in the detonator&#x27;s booster charge. Given a sufficiently high and well-controlled amount of electric current and voltage, the timing of the bridgewire vaporization is both extremely short (a few microseconds) and extremely precise and predictable (standard deviation of time to detonate as low as a few tens of nanoseconds).

Conventional blasting caps use electricity to heat a bridge wire rather than vaporize it, and that heating then causes the primary explosive to detonate. Imprecise contact between the bridgewire and the primary explosive changes how quickly the explosive is heated up, and minor electrical variations in the wire or leads will change how quickly it heats up as well. The heating process typically takes milliseconds to tens of milliseconds to complete and initiate detonation in the primary explosive. This is roughly 1,000 to 10,000 times longer and less precise than the EBW electrical vaporization.

=== Use in nuclear weapons ===

Since explosives detonate at typically 7–8 kilometers per second, or 7–8 meters per millisecond, a 1 millisecond delay in detonation from one side of a nuclear weapon to the other would be longer than the time the detonation would take to cross the weapon. The time precision and consistency of EBWs (0.1 microsecond or less) are roughly enough time for the detonation to move 1 millimeter at most, and for the most precise commercial EBWs this is 0.025 microsecond and about 0.2 mm variation in the detonation wave. This is sufficiently precise for very tight tolerance applications such as nuclear weapon explosive lenses.

In the US, due to their use in nuclear weapons, these devices are subject to nuclear control authorities, according to the Guidelines for the Export of Nuclear Material, Equipment and Technology. EBWs are on the United States Munitions List, and exports are highly regulated.

=== Civilian use ===

EBWs have found uses outside nuclear weapons, such as the Titan IV missile, safety conscious applications where stray electrical currents might detonate normal blasting caps, and applications requiring very precise timing for multiple point commercial blasting in mines or quarries. EBW detonators are much safer than regular electric detonators because unlike regular detonators EBWs do not have primary explosives. Primary explosives such as lead azide are very sensitive to static electricity, radio frequency, shock, etc.

== Mechanism of operation ==

The bridgewire is usually made of gold, but platinum or gold/platinum alloys can also be used. The most common commercial wire size is 0.038 mm (1.5 mils) in diameter and 1 mm (40 mils) in length, but lengths ranging from 0.25 mm to 2.5 mm (10 mils to 100 mils) can be encountered. From the available explosives, only PETN at low densities can be initiated by sufficiently low shock to make its use practical in commercial systems as a part of the EBW initiator. It can be chained with another explosive booster, often a pellet of tetryl, RDX or some PBX (e.g., PBX 9407). Detonators without such booster are called &quot;initial pressing detonators&quot; (IP detonators).

During initiation, the wire heats with the passing current until melting point is reached. The heating rate is high enough that the liquid metal has no time to flow away, and heats further until it vaporizes. During this phase the electrical resistance of the bridgewire assembly rises. Then an electric arc forms in the metal vapor, leading to drop of electrical resistance and sharp growth of the current, quick further heating of the ionized metal vapor, and formation of a shock wave. To achieve the melting and subsequent vaporizing of the wire in time sufficiently short to create a shock wave, a current rise rate of at least 100 amperes per microsecond is required.

If the current rise rate is lower, the bridge may burn, perhaps causing deflagration of the PETN pellet, but it will not cause detonation. PETN-containing EBWs are also relatively insensitive to a static electricity discharge. Their use is limited by the thermal stability range of PETN. Slapper detonators, which can use high density hexanitrostilbene, may used in temperatures up to almost in environments ranging from vacuum to high pressures.

==Firing system==

The EBW and the slapper detonator are the safest known types of detonators, as only a very high-current fast-rise pulse can successfully trigger them. However, they require a bulky power source for the current surges required. The extremely short rise times are usually achieved by discharging a low-inductance, high-capacitance, high-voltage capacitor (e.g., oil-filled, Mylar-foil, or ceramic) through a suitable switch (spark gap, thyratron, krytron, etc.) into the bridge wire. A very rough approximation for the capacitor is a rating of 5 kilovolts and 1 microfarad, and the peak current ranges between 500 and 1000 amperes. The high voltage may be generated using a Marx generator. Low-impedance capacitors and low-impedance coaxial cables are required to achieve the necessary current rise rate.

The flux compression generator is one alternative to capacitors. When fired, it creates a strong electromagnetic pulse, which is inductively coupled into one or more secondary coils connected to the bridge wires or slapper foils. A low energy density capacitor equivalent to a compression generator would be roughly the size of a soda can. The energy in such a capacitor would be ·C·V, which for the above-mentioned capacitor is 12.5 J. (By comparison, a defibrillator delivers ~200 J from 2 kV and perhaps 20 μF. The flash-strobe in a disposable camera is typically 3 J from a 300 V capacitor of 100 μF.)

In a fission bomb, the same or similar circuit is used for powering the neutron trigger, the initial source of fission neutrons.

<doc id="337069" wikidata="Q929286" url="?curid=337069" title="Herne Bay">
<text>Herne Bay is a seaside town on the north coast of Kent in South East England. It is north of Canterbury and east of Whitstable. It neighbours the ancient villages of Herne and Reculver and is part of the City of Canterbury local government district, although it remains a separate town with countryside between it and Canterbury. Herne Bay&#x27;s seafront is home to the world&#x27;s first freestanding purpose-built Clock Tower, built in 1837. From the late Victorian period until 1978, the town had the second-longest pier in the United Kingdom.

The town began as a small shipping community, receiving goods and passengers from London en route to Canterbury and Dover. The town rose to prominence as a seaside resort during the early 19th century after the building of a pleasure pier and promenade by a group of London investors, and reached its heyday in the late Victorian era. Its popularity as a holiday destination has declined over the past decades, due to the increase in foreign travel and to a lesser degree exposure to flooding that has prevented the town&#x27;s redevelopment. In 2011 the town had a population of 38,563. 1

== History ==
The town of Herne Bay took its name from the neighbouring village of Herne, two kilometres inland from the bay. The word &quot;herne&quot;, meaning a place on a corner of land, evolved from the Old English &quot;hyrne&quot;, meaning corner. The village was first recorded in around 1100 as Hyrnan. The &quot;corner&quot; may relate to the sharp turn in the minor Roman road between Canterbury and Reculver at Herne.

One of the oldest buildings in Herne Bay is the late 18th-century inn The Ship, which served as the focal point for the small shipping and farming community that first inhabited the town. During this time, passenger and cargo boats regularly ran between Herne Bay and London and boats carrying coal ran from Newcastle. From Herne, there was easy access by road to the city of Canterbury.
The 1801 census recorded Herne Bay, including Herne, as having a population of 1,232. During the early 19th century, a smugglers&#x27; gang operated from the town. The gang were regularly involved in a series of fights with the preventive services until finally being overpowered in the 1820s.

In the 1830s, a group of London investors, who recognised Herne Bay&#x27;s potential as a seaside resort, built a wooden pier and a promenade on the town&#x27;s seafront. This and the subsequent building of a railway station led to the rapid expansion of the town; between 1831 and 1841 the town&#x27;s population grew from 1,876 to 3,041. The London businessmen intended to rename the town St Augustine&#x27;s, but the name was unpopular with residents and the name &quot;Herne Bay&quot; remained. In 1833, an Act of Parliament established Herne Bay and Herne as separate towns. Local landowner Sir Henry Oxenden donated a piece of ground for the site of the town&#x27;s first church, Christ Church, which was opened in 1834. In 1837, Mrs Ann Thwaytes, a wealthy widow from London, donated around £4,000 to build a clock tower on the town&#x27;s seafront. It is believed to be the first freestanding, purpose-built clock tower in the world.
During the 1840s, steamboats began running between Herne Bay and London. There was a type of beach boat unique to Herne Bay and nearby Thanet, known as the Thanet wherry, a narrow pulling boat about long. These boats were mainly used for fishing; however, with the advent of tourism and the decline of fishing, they became mainly used for pleasure trips. A document dated 1840 records the town as having the following schools, all of which are now defunct: Haddington (boarding school), Oxenden House, The British School, Prospect Place and Herne Street School. The village of Herne was often called Herne Street around this time. The same document also mentions the still-existing Rodney Head, The Ship and Upper Red Lion inns.

In 1912, the first &quot;Brides in the Bath&quot; murder by George Joseph Smith was committed in Herne Bay. BBC scriptwriter Anthony Coburn, who lived in the resort, was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. During World War II, a sea-fort was built off the coast of Herne Bay and Whitstable, which is still in existence. The coastal village of Reculver, to the east of Herne Bay, was the site of the testing of the bouncing bomb used by the &quot;Dam Busters&quot; during the war.

=== The pier ===

The original wooden pier had to be dismantled in 1871 after its owners went into liquidation and sea worms had damaged the wood. A shorter -long iron pier with a theatre and shops at the entrance was built in 1873.

However, it was too short for steamboats to berth at. The pier proved to be unprofitable and in 1896 construction began on a replacement iron pier which would be longer and feature an electric tram. At , this pier was the second longest in the country, behind only the pier at Southend-on-Sea.

The town&#x27;s heyday as a seaside resort was during the late Victorian era; the population nearly doubled from 4,410 to 8,442 between 1881 and 1901. Much of the resulting late Victorian seafront architecture is still in existence today. In 1910, a pavilion was added to the landward end of the pier. By 1931, the town&#x27;s population had grown to 14,533. At the beginning of World War II, the army cut two gaps between the landward end of the pier and the seaward terminal as a counter-invasion measure. The pier&#x27;s two gaps were bridged for pedestrians after the war.

1963 marked the end of steamboat services from the pier. In 1970, a fire destroyed the pier&#x27;s pavilion and plans were made to replace it with a sports centre, which was opened in 1976 by former Prime Minister Edward Heath. The centre section of the pier was torn down by a storm in 1978, leaving the end of the pier isolated in the sea. It has not been rebuilt due to the cost; however, residents and businesses in the town have campaigned for its restoration. The sports centre was demolished in 2012, leaving a bare platform.

== Governance ==
Since 1983, Herne Bay has been in the Herne Bay and Sandwich constituency, represented by Roger Gale.

Herne Bay, along with Whitstable and Canterbury, is in the City of Canterbury local government district, although it remains a separate town, with countryside between it and Canterbury. The town contains the five electoral wards of Heron, Herne and Broomfield, Greenhill and Eddington, West Bay and Reculver. These wards have thirteen of the fifty seats on the Canterbury City council. As at the 2011 local elections, twelve of those seats were held by the Conservatives and one by the Liberal Democrats.

== Geography ==
Herne Bay is in north-east Kent, on the coast of the Thames Estuary. The town is situated east of Whitstable and north-north-east of the city of Canterbury. The village of Herne is about to the south and the village of Reculver is about to the east. The town&#x27;s suburbs are Hampton, Greenhill and Studd Hill in the west, Eddington and Broomfield in the south, with Beltinge and Hillborough in the east. The drowned settlement of Hampton-on-Sea once existed beside what is now Hampton.

The landscape of the town has been largely influenced by the Plenty Brook, which flows northward through the centre of the town and into the North Sea. It is thought to have been a much larger stream in ancient times. The coastline has two distinct bays, separated by a jut of land created by silt from the outflow of the brook into the sea. The first buildings in the town were built along the east bay, a short distance from the brook outflow, where the road from Canterbury met the sea. The town has since spread across both bays, across the Plenty Brook valley and onto the relatively high land flanking both sides of the valley. The land to the east of the valley reaches a height of above sea level and to the west reaches . Cliffs are formed where this high land meets the sea.

The rising land beside the coast, between the valley and the eastern cliffs, is known as &quot;The Downs&quot; (no relation to the North or South Downs). This area has been named a Site of Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area for birds. The whole of the north-east Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The geology of the town consists mainly of London Clay, overlaid with brickearth in the west. The sand and clay of The Downs are subject to landslips.

The Plenty Brook passes through the town&#x27;s drainage system, allowing buildings to be built over the top. The brook has been prone to flooding during heavy rain, especially in inland areas, which regularly causes problems for people living in the Eddington area in southern Herne Bay.

Stormy weather can cause the sea level by the coast to rise by up to two metres. In the past, this has caused disastrous flooding in the town; the worst in the town&#x27;s history being in 1953. Coastal defences were subsequently constructed including groynes, sea walls and shingle beach. In the 1990s, these defences were deemed to be inadequate and an offshore breakwater, now known as Neptune&#x27;s Arm, was built to protect the most vulnerable areas of the town.

== Climate ==

Herne Bay experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb).

The nearest Met Office station is at Manston, 10 miles east.

In east Kent, the warmest time of the year is July and August, when maximum temperatures average around 21 °C (70 °F); the coolest months are January and February, when minimum temperatures average around 1 °C (34 °F). East Kent&#x27;s average maximum and minimum temperatures are around 1/2 °C higher than the national average. Herne Bay is sometimes warmer than other parts of Kent as it is backed by the North Downs to the south, causing a Foehn effect when winds are from a south or south westerly direction. Between 1999 and 2005, Herne Bay recorded the highest daily temperature in the United Kingdom nine times. East Kent&#x27;s average annual rainfall is about 728 mm (29 inches), the wettest months being October to January. This was lower than the national average annual rainfall of 838 mm (33 inches), and recent droughts have led to hosepipe bans by Mid Kent Water.

The highest temperature recorded in Herne Bay was in August 2003 when the temperature hit during the 2003 European heatwave and the lowest temperature being in January 1940 with recorded during a notably cold winter that affected the UK.

== Demography ==

As of the 2001 UK census, Herne Bay area wards had a population of 35,188 and a population density of 11.3 persons per hectare.

Of the town&#x27;s 14,732 households, 48.7% were married couples living together, 8.4% were cohabiting couples and 8.3% were lone parents. 30.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 20.5% had someone living alone at pensionable age. 27.7% of households included children aged under 16 or a person aged 16 to 18 who was in full-time education. The average household size was 2.74.

The ethnicity of the town was 98.5% white, 0.6% mixed race, 0.4% Asian, 0.2% black and 0.3% Chinese or other. The place of birth of residents was 96.3% United Kingdom, 0.6% Republic of Ireland, 0.3% Germany, 0.6% other Western Europe countries, 0.2% Eastern Europe, 0.6% Africa, 0.3% Far East, 0.3% South Asia, 0.2% Middle East, 0.2% North America and 0.2% Oceania. Religion was recorded as 77.3% Christian, 0.3% Muslim, 0.2% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist, 0.1% Jewish and 0.1% Sikh. 14.2% were recorded as having no religion, 0.3% had an alternative religion and 7.4% did not state their religion.

For every 100 females, there were 89.9 males. The age distribution was 6% aged 0–4 years, 14% aged 5–15 years, 4% aged 16–19 years, 29% aged 20–44 years, 25% aged 45–64 years and 22% aged 65 years and over. The town had a high percentage of residents over 65, compared with the national average of 16%. As a seaside town, Herne Bay is a popular retirement destination; many modern retirement complexes are located near the seafront.

The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 36% in full-time employment, 13% in part-time employment, 9% self-employed, 3% unemployed, 2% students with jobs, 3% students without jobs, 18% retired, 7% looking after home or family, 6% permanently sick or disabled and 2% economically inactive for other reasons. This was roughly in line with the national figures, except for the number of people in retirement. This figure nationally was significantly lower at 14%. Of the town&#x27;s residents aged 16–74, 12% had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared with 20% nationwide. According to Office for National Statistics estimates, during the period of April 2001 to March 2002 the average gross weekly income of households in the Herne Bay area was £516 (£26,906 per year).

== Economy ==

The advent of overseas travel and changes to holiday trends eventually caused the town&#x27;s economy to decline after the 1960s; regular flooding of the Plenty Brook prevented redevelopment of the town centre. However, extensive seafront regeneration in the 1990s followed the creation of the Neptune&#x27;s Arm sea defence jetty. The jetty has created a small harbour used by leisure boats and from where tourists can take sailing yacht trips to a seal-watching site in the Thames estuary. The Victorian gardens on the seafront were then able to be fully restored. The Central Bandstand, built in 1924, was refurbished after years of disrepair and closure to the public. A swimming pool and cinema were added to the town centre in the early 1990s. In 2005, a wind-farm with thirty 2.75 MW wind turbines was built off the coast of Herne Bay and Whitstable, generating a total of 82.5 MW of electricity. The recent upgrades by the Council have helped improve the image of the town and raise its profile. It is hoped this will attract new investment in tourism and business by the private sector, and lead to the regeneration of the town&#x27;s economy.

In 2006, Canterbury City Council began a public consultation to discuss the regeneration. A concern raised by the council is that the shopping centre is incoherent and fails to attract the tourists who come for the seafront. Other issues raised are the lack of holiday accommodation, car parks and clear pedestrian routes between the three main attractions in the town: the seafront, Memorial park and shopping centre. The council is considering relocating the sports centre from the pier and replacing it with other tourist attractions.

As of the 2001 census, the industry of employment of residents of Herne Bay was 19% retail, 14% health and social work, 11% manufacturing, 10% construction, 9% real estate, 8% education, 8% transport and communications, 5% public administration, 5% hotels and restaurants, 4% finance, 1% agriculture and 5% other community, social or Personal Services. Compared to national figures, the town had a relatively high number of workers in the construction and health/social care industries and a relatively low number in manufacturing and real estate. Many residents commute to work outside the town. As of the 2001 UK census, 14,711 of the town&#x27;s residents were in employment, whereas there were only 8,104 jobs within the town.

One of the largest employers is the centrally located supermarket, which as of January 2006 was considering further expansion. It is one of the major attractions to the town&#x27;s shopping centre, however there are fears that its expansion could lead it to become too dominant, at the cost of smaller shops in the town. Apart from tourism and retail, many jobs are also provided in the manufacturing industry, mainly located in industrial estates on the outskirts of the town, which produce goods such as kitchen furniture and factory machinery. A high number of construction jobs have been created by redevelopment of the seafront, which is expected to continue with the proposed regeneration of the town centre. The elderly population of the town has led to many Health and Social Care jobs at local care homes and at the town&#x27;s Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital. As of the 2001 census, 1.9% of the town&#x27;s population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.

== Landmarks ==
The seafront has a shingle beach, which has been awarded a European Blue Flag and the yellow and blue Seaside Award for its safety and cleanliness. The seafront features a Victorian bandstand and gardens, amusement arcades, and children&#x27;s play areas. Landmarks by the seafront include the Clock Tower, the sea defence jetty, the off-shore World War II sea fort and the off-shore wind farm. There are seaside cafés, fresh seafood restaurants, guesthouses, beach huts and numerous water-sports facilities.

The Memorial Park, situated near the centre of the town, incorporates a children&#x27;s play area, a large shallow duck pond often used for remote control boats, basketball and tennis courts and a large expanse of grass for field games. The park has a monument and an &#x27;Avenue of Remembrance&#x27; as memorials to the town&#x27;s residents killed during the two world wars.

Reculver Country Park is about east of Herne Bay, and is home to the cliff-top remains of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Reculver, with its distinctive twin towers, sited within the remains of a Roman fort; a visitor centre offers information on the local geology, history and wildlife. Wildwood Discovery Park is about south of Herne Bay on the A291 road between there and Sturry, and features over 50 species of native British animals, such as deer, badgers, wild boar and wolves.

Herne Mill, a late 18th-century Kentish smock mill overlooking the village of Herne from a hilltop, is usually open to visitors on Sunday afternoons between April and September. A concrete funnel-shaped water tower overlooks Herne Bay from the top of Mickleburgh Hill. This water tower is now used as a base for radio transmitters.

== Transport ==
Herne Bay railway station is on the Chatham Main Line, which runs between Ramsgate in East Kent and London Victoria. It is also served by Southeastern high speed services to London St Pancras. Other stations on these lines include Broadstairs, Margate, Whitstable, Faversham, Gillingham, Rochester, Bromley South, Gravesend and Stratford International. Herne Bay is around 1 hour and 40 minutes from London Victoria and 80 minutes from St Pancras. A selection of trains run to London&#x27;s Cannon Street and London Blackfriars, primarily for business commuting.

There are Stagecoach South East bus services (Triangle/6/36) running to neighbouring Whitstable and to Canterbury, where many Herne Bay residents go to work and shop. The 36 bus route runs to Margate, another popular seaside resort There is also an infrequent bus service 7 , which formerly linked Herne Bay to Canterbury, but Triangle/6 routes were more frequent, quick and direct; as a result, the 7 was shortened significantly in June 2022.

The A299 road, also known as the Thanet Way, runs between Ramsgate and Faversham via Herne Bay and Whitstable. The road merges with the M2 motorway at Faversham. In the late 1990s, the road was converted into a dual carriageway and redirected to avoid passing through urban areas of Herne Bay and Whitstable.

== Education ==

Herne Bay&#x27;s secondary school is the modern Herne Bay High. It is a mixed ability foundation school with about 1,500 students. In 2002, Herne Bay High was designated a specialist school and Sports College. In 2005, 14% of the school&#x27;s pupils gained at least five GCSEs at grades A*–C including English and maths, ranking it 107th out of Kent&#x27;s 120 secondary schools. Many students commute to schools in other nearby towns, especially to the grammar schools in Faversham, Ramsgate and Canterbury.

Herne Bay Junior School, situated in the town centre, has about 500 students. It was originally established in the late Victorian era and was formerly joined with the neighbouring Herne Bay Infant school. In 2006, Herne Bay Junior School&#x27;s Key Stage 2 results ranked 139th out of Kent&#x27;s 386 state primary schools.

The village schools are Herne Primary School, Herne Church of England Junior School, Herne Church of England Infant and Nursery School, Briary Primary School in Greenhill, Hampton Primary School and Reculver Church of England Primary School. The Church of England schools are voluntary controlled (that is, owned by the church) but, like the other schools, are run by Kent County Council. In 2006, Reculver Church of England Primary School achieved the best Key Stage 2 performances of the schools in the Herne Bay area, ranking 133rd out of Kent&#x27;s 386 state primary schools.

Canterbury College @ Herne Bay is a branch of Canterbury College in Herne Bay town centre, which provides a range of short information technology courses to adults. Whitstable Adult education Centre runs adult learning courses at various Herne Bay locations.

== Religion ==

The Church of England has two parishes in Herne Bay: Christ Church with St Andrew&#x27;s, and St Martin&#x27;s with St Peter&#x27;s. The Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart is in Clarence Road. There is a Baptist church in the High Street. There is a United (Methodist and United Reformed) Church in Mortimer Street. There is also a United Reformed Church in The Meadows, Broomfield. Herne Bay Salvation Army Corps is based in Richmond Street. The Canopy Church is in South Road. The Beacon Church meets at Briary School, Greenhill, Herne Bay. Herne Bay Evangelical Free Church meets in Sunnyhill Road. Herne Bay Christian Spiritualist Church is in Avenue Road.

== Culture ==

Herne Bay Festival happens every August with ten days of almost every event being free, including live music, performance, creative commissions, cultural treats, family fun, workshops, competitions, walks, talks, exhibitions and family entertainment.

Other summer events include Happy Days, a programme of bandstand concerts and family entertainment, Herne Bay Carnival through the town centre, a travelling funfair at the Memorial Park and Herne Bay Bus Rally. Each summer, the council runs a gardening competition, &quot;Herne Bay in Bloom&quot;, which encourages residents and businesses to keep the town looking well presented.

<text>Charles Greeley Abbot (May 31, 1872 – December 17, 1973) was an American astrophysicist and the fifth secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, serving from 1928 until 1944. Abbot went from being director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, to becoming Assistant Secretary, and then Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution over the course of his career. As an astrophysicist, he researched the solar constant, research that led him to invent the solar cooker, solar boiler, solar still, and other patented solar energy inventions.

==Early life and education==

Charles Greeley Abbot was born in Wilton, New Hampshire. His parents, Harris Abbot and Caroline Ann Greeley, were farmers and he was the youngest of four children. As a youth he built and invented numerous things, such as a forge to fix tools, a water wheel to power a saw, and a bicycle. He dropped out of school when he was 13 to become a carpenter. Two years later he went back to high school. He attended Phillips Academy. 
When a friend of his went to Boston to take the entrance exam to get into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Abbot went for the chance to visit Boston. However, upon arrival, he was uncomfortable visiting Boston alone and chose to take the exam instead. He passed and his family gathered the funds to send him to MIT for one year. He started out studying chemical engineering, but eventually moved on to physics.

He graduated in 1894 with a Master of Science in physics. During his time in Boston, Abbot met Samuel P. Langley on the MIT campus when Langley visited seeking an assistant. In 1895, he would start working as an aid at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

==Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory==

While at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), Abbot would work under Samuel P. Langley. Langley would go on to change his focus from solar radiation to aeronautics, with Abbot taking over solar radiation research. Abbot would participate in many expeditions. In 1900 he, along with Langley, would travel to Wadesboro, North Carolina to observe a solar eclipse, followed by another eclipse expedition to Sumatra in 1901. During his expedition experiences he would also travel to Algeria, Egypt, South Africa, Australia, and other countries, often in partnership with the National Geographic Society. Abbot would become acting director of SAO in 1906 and in 1907, Abbot became the Director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, following the death of Samuel P. Langley. While Langley was still Director, he had visited Mount Whitney, and decided it would be a great place for an observatory. Abbot secured funding for the observatory and it was built in 1909. As Director, a position he would hold until his retirement, Abbot would open the Radiation Biology Laboratory in 1929, to study radiation effects on plants, and other organisms. This helped to develop the first wave of biophysics researchers in the United States.

==Life and work as Smithsonian Secretary==

Abbot would become the Assistant Secretary at the Smithsonian Institution in 1918, upon the death of Frederick W. True. In his role as Assistant Secretary he would oversee the Smithsonian Institution Libraries, the International Exchange Service, and the SAO. He also co-created the &quot;Smithsonian Scientific Series&quot; books, which helped raise funds for the Smithsonian.

Ten years later, on January 10, 1928, he became the fifth Secretary of the Smithsonian after the death of Charles Doolittle Walcott. Abbot would also maintain his position as Director of the Astrophysical Observatory. In 1927, Walcott had finalized the Smithsonian&#x27;s strategic plan, which Abbot took on responsibility for upon his election as Secretary. The Smithsonian began a capital campaign in 1929, coinciding with the start of the Great Depression. During this tenure, Abbot oversaw the Smithsonian&#x27;s participation in Works Progress Administration projects, including the Federal Art Project. Projects included new buildings and artwork at the National Zoo, and the start of the Smithsonian&#x27;s first media project, a radio show called &quot;The World is Yours&quot;. The program would be ceased in 1942 due to World War II. In the 1930s an expansion was approved for the National Museum of Natural History building, which would not begin until the 1960s. The Institute for Social Anthropology was also transferred to the Smithsonian during this time. While Secretary, Abbot would fail to acquire the National Gallery of Art for the Smithsonian. Abbot&#x27;s role in the United States National Museum was also minimal, and was under the primary care of Assistant Secretary Alexander Wetmore.

He was the first Smithsonian Secretary to retire, ending his tenure on July 1, 1944. Following retirement, he was awarded Secretary Emeritus status and proceeded to continue his research work. The first Smithsonian holiday party would be held during his tenure. At the party, Abbot sang and played the cello for the partygoers. While in Washington, he was a deacon at the First Congregational Church. He also played tennis frequently at the former tennis courts at the Smithsonian Castle.

==Later life and legacy==
During his lifetime, Abbot was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. On May 31, 1955, the Smithsonian held a birthday party for Abbot, marking his 83rd birthday and his 60th year of association with the Smithsonian. The event was held at the Smithsonian Castle and a bronze bust of Abbot, by Alicia Neatherly, was presented, and donated to the National Gallery of Art. Charles Greeley Abbot died, at age 101 in Maryland, on December 17, 1973. The American Solar Energy Society has an award named in Abbot&#x27;s honor, which is awarded for contributions to solar energy research.

The Abbot crater on the Moon has been named after him.

==Research work==

Abbot began his astrophysics research focusing on solar radiation before proceeding to chart cyclic patterns found in solar variations. With this research he hoped to track solar constant in order to make weather pattern predictions. He believed that the sun was a variable star which effected the weather on Earth, which was criticized by many contemporaries. In 1953, he discovered a connection between solar variations and planetary climate. This discovery allowed general climate patterns to be predicted 50 years in advance. He did field work at the Smithsonian Institution Shelter, which was built during his tenure as director at SAO, Lick Observatory, and Mount Wilson Observatory. At Lick, he worked with W.W. Campbell. To fight critics, Abbot would utilize balloons with pyrheliometers installed on them for measurements. He was the first scientist in America to do so, with the balloons reaching upwards of 25 kilometers. One balloon returned data that allowed Abbot to determine the solar constant at the highest point of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Later in his research career, he turned his focus on solar energy use.

An instrumentalist, he invented the solar cooker, which was first built at Mount Wilson Observatory, the solar boiler, and held fifteen other patents related to solar energy. For his research and contributions to the sciences, Abbot was awarded a Henry Draper Medal in 1910 and a Rumford Medal in 1916.

<text>In neuroanatomy, a nucleus (: nuclei) is a cluster of neurons in the central nervous system, located deep within the cerebral hemispheres and brainstem. The neurons in one nucleus usually have roughly similar connections and functions. Nuclei are connected to other nuclei by tracts, the bundles (fascicles) of axons (nerve fibers) extending from the cell bodies. A nucleus is one of the two most common forms of nerve cell organization, the other being layered structures such as the cerebral cortex or cerebellar cortex. In anatomical sections, a nucleus shows up as a region of gray matter, often bordered by white matter. The vertebrate brain contains hundreds of distinguishable nuclei, varying widely in shape and size. A nucleus may itself have a complex internal structure, with multiple types of neurons arranged in clumps (subnuclei) or layers.

The term &quot;nucleus&quot; is in some cases used rather loosely, to mean simply an identifiably distinct group of neurons, even if they are spread over an extended area. The reticular nucleus of the thalamus, for example, is a thin layer of inhibitory neurons that surrounds the thalamus.

Some of the major anatomical components of the brain are organized as clusters of interconnected nuclei. Notable among these are the thalamus and hypothalamus, each of which contains several dozen distinguishable substructures. The medulla and pons also contain numerous small nuclei with a wide variety of sensory, motor, and regulatory functions.

In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), a cluster of cell bodies of neurons (homologous to a CNS nucleus) is called a ganglion. The fascicles of nerve fibers in the PNS (homologous to CNS tracts) are called nerves.

==Examples==

*Brainstem: red nucleus, vestibular nucleus, inferior olive
*Cerebellum: dentate nucleus, emboliform nucleus, globose nucleus, fastigial nucleus
*Basal ganglia: striatum (caudate and putamen), pallidum (globus pallidus, medial and lateral), substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus
*Cranial nerve nuclei
*Ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus: &quot;The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is a distinct morphological nucleus involved in feeding, fear, thermoregulation, and sexual activity.&quot;

<doc id="337080" wikidata="Q1676888" url="?curid=337080" title="Olive Branch Petition">
<text>The Olive Branch Petition was adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 5, 1775, and signed on July 8, 1775, in a final attempt to avoid war between Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies in America. The Congress had already authorized the invasion of Canada more than a week earlier, but the petition affirmed American loyalty to Great Britain and entreated King George III to prevent further conflict. It was followed by the July 6, 1775 Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, however, which made its success unlikely in London. In August 1775, the colonies were formally declared to be in rebellion by the Proclamation of Rebellion, and the petition was rejected by the British government; King George had refused to read it before declaring the colonists traitors.

==Drafting==

The Second Continental Congress, convened in present-day Independence Hall in the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia in May 1775, and most of its delegates initially generally supported fellow delegate John Dickinson in his quest to attempt to reconcile with King George III. But a smaller group of delegates to the Second Continental Congress, led by John Adams, argued that war with the British would ultimately prove inevitable, and they instead abstained from supporting Dickinson&#x27;s efforts, choosing instead to await a suitable moment to rally the Thirteen Colonies in support of war and the cause of American independence. 

The disengagement of this smaller number of delegates, however, allowed Dickinson and the delegates who supported his efforts to attempt to reconcile their differences and concerns with the British.

Dickinson was the primary author of the Olive Branch Petition, and Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, John Rutledge, and Thomas Johnson served on the drafting committee for the document. Dickinson claimed that the Thirteen Colonies did seek complete independence from the British Empire, but did seek more equitable trade and tax regulations. 

Dickinson asked that King George III establish a lasting settlement between Great Britain and the colonies &quot;upon so firm a basis as to perpetuate its blessings, uninterrupted by any future dissensions, to succeeding generations in both countries&quot;, beginning with the repeal of the Intolerable Acts. The introductory paragraph of the letter named twelve of the thirteen colonies, all except Georgia. The letter was approved on July 5 and was signed by John Hancock, President of the Second Continental Congress, and by representatives of these twelve colonies. On July 8, 1775, the letter was sent to London in the care of Richard Penn and Arthur Lee.

The letter is housed in the National Archives in London. Dickinson hoped that news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord combined with the &quot;humble petition&quot; would persuade the King to respond with a counter-proposal or open negotiations.

==Reception and rejection==
John Adams, a delegate to the Second Continental Congress and advocate of full independence from the British Empire, wrote a friend, saying that the petition served no purpose, that war with the British was inevitable, and that the Thirteen Colonies should have already raised a navy and taken British officials as prisoners. Adams&#x27; letter was intercepted by British officials, and news of its contents reached Great Britain at about the same time as the petition itself arrived. British advocates of a military response used Adams&#x27; letter to argue that the petition itself was insincere.

Penn and Lee provided a copy of the petition to colonial secretary Lord Dartmouth on August 21, followed with the original on September 1. They reported back on September 2, writing, &quot;we were told that as his Majesty did not receive it on the throne, no answer would be given.&quot; 

By this time, King George III had already issued his Proclamation of Rebellion on August 23 in response to news of the Battle of Bunker Hill, declaring the Thirteen Colonies to be in a state of open rebellion and ordering &quot;all Our officers ... and all Our obedient and loyal subjects, to use their utmost endeavours to withstand and suppress such rebellion&quot;. The hostilities which Adams had foreseen undercut the petition, and the King had answered it before it even reached him.

==Consequences==

King George III&#x27;s refusal to consider the petition gave John Adams and others the opportunity they sought to push for the colonies&#x27; full independence and to argue that the King was intransigent and uninterested in addressing the colonists&#x27; grievances. 

Adams served to polarize the issue in the minds of many in the Thirteen Colonies, who began to see that there was little promise for reconciliation and that only two realistic options existed: complete independence, which almost would require war with the British, or complete submission to British colonial rule. Thomas Paine further expanded this recognition in &quot;Common Sense&quot;, his widely-read pamphlet, which was published in January 1776, six months before the Second Continental Congress agreed to unanimously adopt and publish the Declaration of Independence, largely authored by Thomas Jefferson, which detailed the grievances of the Thirteen Colonies and the case for their independence.

<text>The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), or Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), is a disarmament treaty that effectively bans biological and toxin weapons by prohibiting their development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use. The treaty&#x27;s full name is the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction.

Having entered into force on 26 March 1975, the BWC was the first multilateral disarmament treaty to ban the production of an entire category of weapons of mass destruction. The convention is of unlimited duration. As of February 2025, 188 states have become party to the treaty. Four additional states have signed but not ratified the treaty, and another five states have neither signed nor acceded to the treaty.

The BWC is considered to have established a strong global norm against biological weapons. This norm is reflected in the treaty&#x27;s preamble, which states that the use of biological weapons would be &quot;repugnant to the conscience of mankind&quot;. It is also demonstrated by the fact that not a single state today declares to possess or seek biological weapons, or asserts that their use in war is legitimate. In light of the rapid advances in biotechnology, biodefense expert Daniel Gerstein has described the BWC as &quot;the most important arms control treaty of the twenty-first century&quot;. However, the convention&#x27;s effectiveness has been limited due to insufficient institutional support and the absence of any formal verification regime to monitor compliance.

== History ==
While the history of biological warfare goes back more than six centuries to the Siege of Caffa in 1346 CE, international restrictions on biological warfare began only with the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use but not the possession or development of chemical and biological weapons. Upon ratification of the Geneva Protocol, several countries made reservations regarding its applicability and use in retaliation. Due to these reservations, it was in practice a &quot;no-first-use&quot; agreement only. In particular, it did not prevent multiple states from starting and scaling offensive biological weapons programs, including the United States (active from 1943 to 1969) and the Soviet Union (active from the 1920s until at least 1992).

The American biowarfare system was terminated in 1969 by President Nixon when he issued his Statement on Chemical and Biological Defense Policies and Programs. The statement ended, unconditionally, all U.S. offensive biological weapons programs. When Nixon ended the program the budget was $300 million annually.

The BWC sought to supplement the Geneva Protocol and was negotiated in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva from 1969 to 1972, following the conclusion of the negotiation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Of significance was a 1968 British proposal to separate consideration of chemical and biological weapons and to first negotiate a convention on biological weapons. The negotiations gained further momentum when the United States decided to unilaterally end its offensive biological weapons program in 1969 and support the British proposal. In March 1971, the Soviet Union and its allies reversed their earlier opposition to the separation of chemical and biological weapons and tabled their own draft convention. The final negotiation stage was reached when the United States and the Soviet Union submitted identical but separate drafts of the BWC text on 5 August 1971. The BWC was opened for signature on 10 April 1972 with ceremonies in London, Moscow, and Washington, D.C., and it entered into force on 26 March 1975 after the ratification by 22 states, including its three depositary governments (the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States).

There have been some concerned scientists who have called for the modernization of the BWC at the periodic Review Conferences. For example, Filippa Lentzos and Gregory Koblentz pointed out in 2016 that &quot;crucial contemporary debates about new developments&quot; for the BWC Review Conferences included &quot;gain-of-function experiments, potential pandemic pathogens, CRISPR and other genome editing technologies, gene drives, and synthetic biology&quot;.

== Treaty obligations ==

With only 15 articles, the BWC is relatively short. Over time, the treaty has been interpreted and supplemented by additional politically binding agreements and understandings reached by its States Parties at eight subsequent Review Conferences.

=== Summary of key articles ===

* Article I: Never under any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile, acquire, or retain biological weapons.
* Article II: To destroy or divert to peaceful purposes biological weapons and associated resources prior to joining.
* Article III: Not to transfer, or in any way assist, encourage, or induce anyone else to acquire or retain biological weapons.
* Article IV: To take any national measures necessary to implement the provisions of the BWC domestically.
* Article V: Undertaking to consult bilaterally and multilaterally and cooperate in solving any problems which may arise in relation to the objective, or in the application, of the BWC.
* Article VI: Right to request the United Nations Security Council to investigate alleged breaches of the BWC and undertaking to cooperate in carrying out any investigation initiated by the Security Council.
* Article VII: To assist States which have been exposed to danger as a result of a violation of the BWC.
* Article X: Undertaking to facilitate, and have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and information for peaceful purposes.
The remaining articles concern the BWC&#x27;s compatibility with the 1925 Geneva Protocol (Article VIII), negotiations to prohibit chemical weapons (Article IX), amendments (Article XI), Review Conferences (Article XII), duration (Article XIII, 1), withdrawal (Article XIII, 2), joining the convention, depositary governments, and conditions for entry into force (Article XIV, 1–5), and languages (Article XV).

=== Article I: Prohibition of biological weapons ===
Article I is the core of the BWC and requires each state &quot;never in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain:

# microbial or other biological agents, or toxins whatever their origin or method of production, of types and in quantities that have no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes; 
# weapons, equipment or means of delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict.&quot;

Article I does not prohibit any specific biological agents or toxins as such but rather certain purposes for which they may be employed. This prohibition is known as the general-purpose criterion and is also used in Article II, 1 of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The general-purpose criterion covers all hostile uses of biological agents, including those developed in the future, and recognizes that biological agents and toxins are inherently dual use. While these agents may be employed for nefarious ends, they also have several legitimate peaceful purposes, including developing medicines and vaccines to counter natural or deliberate disease outbreaks. Against this background, Article I only considers illegitimate those types and quantities of biological agents or toxins and their means of delivery which cannot be justified by prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful purposes; regardless of whether the agents in question affect humans, animals, or plants. A disadvantage of this intent-based approach is a blurring of the line between defensive and offensive biological weapons research.

While it was initially unclear during the early negotiations of the BWC whether viruses would be regulated by it since they lie &quot;at the edge of life&quot;—they possess some but not all of the characteristics of life—viruses were defined as biological agents in 1969 and thus fall within the BWC&#x27;s scope.

While Article I does not explicitly prohibit the &quot;use&quot; of biological weapons as it was already considered to be prohibited by the 1925 Geneva Protocol, it is still regarded as a violation of the BWC, as reaffirmed by the final document of the Fourth Review Conference in 1996.

=== Article III: Prohibition of transfer and assistance ===
Article III bans the transfer, encouragement, assistance, or inducement of anyone, whether governments or non-state actors, in developing or acquiring any of the agents, toxins, weapons, equipment, or means of delivery specified in Article I. The article&#x27;s objective is to prevent the proliferation of biological weapons by limiting the availability of materials and technology which may be used for hostile purposes.

=== Article IV: National implementation ===
Article IV obliges BWC States Parties to implement the convention&#x27;s provisions domestically. This is essential to allow national authorities to investigate, prosecute, and punish any activities prohibited by the BWC; to prevent access to biological agents for harmful purposes; and to detect and respond to the potential use of biological weapons. National implementing measures may take various forms, such as legislation, regulations, codes of conduct, and others. Which implementing measures are adequate for a state depends on several factors, including its legal system, its size and geography, the development of its biotechnology industry, and its participation in regional economic cooperation. Since no one set of measures fits all states, the implementation of specific obligations is left to States Parties&#x27; discretion, based on their assessment of what will best enable them to ensure compliance with the BWC.

A database of over 1,500 laws and regulations that States Parties have enacted to implement the BWC domestically is maintained by the non-governmental organization VERTIC. A similar database on national implementation measures developed by VERTIC and the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research was launched in 2023. These concern the penal code, enforcement measures, import and export controls, biosafety and biosecurity measures, as well as domestic and international cooperation and assistance. For instance, the 1989 Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act implemented the Convention for the United States. A 2023 VERTIC report concluded that &quot;gaps persist in States Parties&#x27; legal frameworks for implementing the Convention at the national level&quot;. The BWC&#x27;s Implementation Support Unit issued a background information document on &quot;strengthening national implementation&quot; in 2018 and an update in 2019.

=== Article V: Consultation and cooperation ===
Article V requires States Parties to consult one another and cooperate in disputes concerning the purpose or implementation of the BWC. The Second Review Conference in 1986 agreed on procedures to ensure that alleged violations of the BWC would be promptly addressed at a consultative meeting when requested by a State Party. These procedures were further elaborated by the Third Review Conference in 1991. Two formal consultative meetings have taken place, the first in 1997 at the request of Cuba, and the second in 2022 at the request of the Russian Federation.

=== Article VI: Complaint about an alleged BWC violation ===
Article VI allows States Parties to lodge a complaint with the United Nations Security Council if they suspect a breach of treaty obligations by another state. Moreover, the article requires states to cooperate with any investigation which the Security Council may launch. There is a general unwillingness to invoke Article VI due to the highly political nature of the Security Council, where the five permanent members—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—hold veto power, including over investigations for alleged treaty violations. One formal complaint pursuant to Article VI has been lodged by the Russian Federation in 2022.

=== Article VII: Assistance after a BWC violation ===
Article VII obliges States Parties to provide assistance to states that so request it if the UN Security Council decides they have been exposed to danger as a result of a violation of the BWC. In addition to helping victims in the event of a biological weapons attack, the purpose of the article is to deter such attacks from occurring in the first place by reducing their potential for harm through international solidarity and assistance. Despite no state ever having invoked Article VII, the article has drawn more attention in recent years, in part due to increasing evidence of terrorist organizations being interested in acquiring biological weapons and also following various naturally occurring epidemics. In 2018, the BWC&#x27;s Implementation Support Unit issued a background document describing a number of additional understandings and agreements on Article VII that have been reached at past Review Conferences.

=== Article X: Peaceful cooperation ===
Article X protects States Parties&#x27; right to exchange biological materials, technology, and information to be used for peaceful purposes. The article states that the implementation of the BWC shall avoid hampering the economic or technological development of States Parties or peaceful international cooperation on biological projects. The Seventh Review Conference in 2011 established an Article X database, which matches voluntary requests and offers for assistance and cooperation among States Parties and international organizations.

== Membership and joining the BWC ==
The BWC has 188 States Parties as of February 2025, with Comoros the most recent to become a party. Four states have signed but not ratified the treaty: Egypt, Haiti, Somalia, and Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;BWC/CONF.IX/PC/7/Rev.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Five additional states have neither signed nor acceded to the treaty: Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Israel and Kiribati. For one of these ten states not party to the convention, the process of joining is well advanced, while an additional two states have started the process. The BWC&#x27;s degree of universality remains low compared to other weapons of mass destruction regimes, including the Chemical Weapons Convention with 193 parties and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons with 191 parties.

States can join the BWC through either &quot;ratification&quot;, &quot;accession&quot; or &quot;succession&quot;, in accordance with their national constitutional processes, which often require parliamentary approval. Ratification applies to states which had previously signed the treaty before it entered into force in 1975. Since then, signing the treaty is no longer possible, but states can accede to it. Succession concerns newly independent states that accept to be bound by a treaty that the predecessor state had joined. The Convention enters into force on the date when an instrument of ratification, accession, or succession is deposited with at least one of the depositary governments (the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States).

Several countries made reservations when ratifying the BWC declaring that it did not imply their complete satisfaction that the treaty allows the stockpiling of biological agents and toxins for &quot;prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes&quot;, nor should it imply recognition of other countries they do not recognize.

== Verification and compliance ==

=== Confidence-building measures ===

At the Second Review Conference in 1986, BWC States Parties agreed to strengthen the treaty by exchanging annual confidence-building measures (CBMs). These politically binding reports aim to prevent or reduce the occurrence of ambiguities, doubts and suspicions, and at improving international cooperation on peaceful biological activities. CBMs are the main formal mechanism through which States Parties regularly exchange compliance-related information. After revisions by the Third, Sixth, and Seventh Review Conferences, the current CBM form requires states to provide information annually on six issues (CBM D was deleted by the Seventh Review Conference in 2011):

* CBM A: (i) research centres and laboratories, and (ii) national biological defence research and development programs 
* CBM B: outbreaks of infectious diseases and similar occurrences caused by toxins 
* CBM C: efforts to promote research results
* CBM E: legislation, regulations, and other measures
* CBM F: past activities in offensive and/or defensive biological research and development programs 
* CBM G: vaccine production facilities

While the number of CBM submissions has increased over time, the overall participation rate remains slightly above 50 percent. In 2018, an online CBM platform was launched to facilitate the electronic submission of CBM reports. An increasing number of states are making their CBM reports publicly available on the platform, but many reports remain only accessible to other states. The history and implementation of the CBM system have been described by the BWC Implementation Support Unit in a 2022 report to the Ninth Review Conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;BWC/CONF.IX/PC/3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failed negotiation of a verification protocol ===
Unlike the chemical or nuclear weapons regimes, the BWC lacks both a system to verify states&#x27; compliance with the treaty and a separate international organization to support the convention&#x27;s effective implementation. Agreement on such a system was not feasible at the time the BWC was negotiated, largely due to Cold War politics but also due to a belief it was not necessary and that the BWC would be difficult to verify. U.S. biological weapons expert Jonathan B. Tucker commented that &quot;this lack of an enforcement mechanism has undermined the effectiveness of the BWC, as it is unable to prevent systematic violations&quot;.

Earlier drafts of the BWC included limited provisions for addressing compliance issues, but these were removed during the negotiation process. Some countries attempted to reintroduce these provisions when the BWC text was submitted to the General Assembly in 1971 but were unsuccessful, as were attempts led by Sweden at the First Review Conference in 1980.

Following the end of the Cold War, a long negotiation process to add a verification mechanism began in 1991, when the Third Review Conference established an expert group on verification, VEREX, with the mandate to identify and examine potential verification measures from a scientific and technical standpoint. During four meetings in 1992 and 1993, VEREX considered 21 verification measures, including inspections of facilities, monitoring relevant publications, and other on-site and off-site measures. Another stimulus came from the successful negotiation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which opened for signature in 1993.

Subsequently, a Special Conference of BWC States Parties in 1994 considered the VEREX report and decided to establish an Ad Hoc Group to negotiate a legally-binding verification protocol. The Ad Hoc Group convened 24 sessions between 1995 and 2001, during which it negotiated a draft protocol to the BWC which would establish an international organization and introduce a verification system. This organization would employ inspectors who would regularly visit declared biological facilities on-site and could also investigate specific suspect facilities and activities. Nonetheless, states found it difficult to agree on several fundamental issues, including export controls and the scope of on-site visits. By early 2001, the &quot;rolling text&quot; of the draft protocol still contained many areas on which views diverged widely.

In March 2001, a 210-page draft protocol was circulated by the chairman of the Ad Hoc Group, which attempted to resolve the contested issues. However, at the 24th session of the Ad Hoc Group in July 2001 the George W. Bush administration rejected both the draft protocol circulated by the Group&#x27;s Chairman and the entire approach on which the draft was based, resulting in the collapse of the negotiation process. To justify its decision, the United States asserted that the protocol would not have improved BWC compliance and would have harmed U.S. national security and commercial interests. Many analysts, including Matthew Meselson and Amy Smithson, criticized the U.S. decision as undermining international efforts against non-proliferation and as contradicting U.S. government rhetoric regarding the alleged biological weapons threat posed by Iraq and other U.S. adversaries.

In subsequent years, calls for restarting negotiations on a verification protocol have been repeatedly voiced. For instance, during the 2019 Meeting of Experts &quot;several States Parties stressed the urgency of resuming multilateral negotiations aimed at concluding a non-discriminatory, legally-binding instrument dealing with (...) verification measures&quot;. However, since &quot;some States Parties did not support the negotiation of a protocol to the BWC&quot; it seems &quot;neither realistic nor practicable to return to negotiations&quot;. Notably, the Biden administration seems to reconsider the U.S. position on verification, as demonstrated by U.S. ambassador Bonnie Jenkins calling on the 2021 BWC Meeting of States Parties to &quot;establish a new expert working group to examine possible measures to strengthen implementation of the Convention, increase transparency, and enhance assurance of compliance&quot;.

In December 2022, States Parties decided to establish a Working Group on strengthening the Convention, which aims to address among other issues, measures on verification and compliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;BWC/CONF.IX/9&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-compliance ===
A number of BWC States Parties have been accused of breaching the convention&#x27;s obligations by developing or producing biological weapons. Because of the intense secrecy around biological weapons programs, it is challenging to assess the actual scope of biological activities and whether they are legitimate defensive programs or a violation of the Convention—except for a few cases with an abundance of evidence for offensive development of biological weapons.

==== Soviet Union and Russia ====

Despite being a party and depositary to the BWC, the Soviet Union has operated the world&#x27;s largest, longest, and most sophisticated biological weapons program, which goes back to the 1920s under the Red Army. Around the time when the BWC negotiations were finalized, and the treaty was signed in the early 1970s, the Soviet Union significantly expanded its covert biological weapons program under the oversight of the &quot;civilian&quot; institution Biopreparat within the Soviet Ministry of Health. The Soviet program employed up to 65,000 people in several hundred facilities and successfully weaponized several pathogens, such as those responsible for smallpox, tularemia, bubonic plague, influenza, anthrax, glanders, and Marburg fever.

The Soviet Union first drew much suspicion of violating its obligations under the BWC after an unusual anthrax outbreak in 1979 in the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk (formerly, and now again, Yekaterinburg) resulted in the deaths of approximately 65 to 100 people. The Soviet authorities blamed the outbreak on the consumption of contaminated meat and for years denied any connection between the incident and biological weapons research. However, investigations concluded that the outbreak was caused by an accident at a nearby military microbiology facility, resulting in the escape of an aerosol of anthrax pathogen. Supporting this finding, Russian President Boris Yeltsin later admitted that &quot;our military developments were the cause&quot;.

Western concerns about Soviet compliance with the BWC increased during the late 1980s and were supported by information provided by several defectors, including Vladimir Pasechnik and Ken Alibek. American President George H. W. Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher therefore directly challenged President Gorbachev with the information. After the Soviet Union&#x27;s dissolution, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia concluded the Trilateral Agreement on 14 September 1992, reaffirming their commitment to full compliance with the BWC and declaring that Russia had eliminated its inherited offensive biological weapons program. The agreement&#x27;s objective was to uncover details about the Soviet&#x27;s biological weapons program and to verify that all related activities had truly been terminated.

David Kelly, a British expert on biological warfare and participant in the visits arranged under the Trilateral Agreement, concluded that, on the one hand, the agreement &quot;was a significant achievement&quot; in that it &quot;provided evidence of Soviet non-compliance from 1975 to 1991&quot;; on the other hand, Kelly noted that the Trilateral Agreement &quot;failed dramatically&quot; because Russia did not &quot;acknowledge and fully account for either the former Soviet programme or the biological weapons activities that it had inherited and continued to engage in&quot;.

Milton Leitenberg and Raymond Zilinskas, authors of the 2012 book &quot;The Soviet Biological Weapons Program: A History&quot;, assert that Russia may still continue parts of the Soviet biological weapons program today. Similarly, as of 2021, the U.S. Department of State &quot;assesses that the Russian Federation (Russia) maintains an offensive [biological weapons] program and is in violation of its obligation under Articles I and II of the BWC. The issue of compliance by Russia with the BWC has been of concern for many years&quot;.

==== Iraq ====

Starting around 1985 under Saddam Hussein&#x27;s leadership, Iraq weaponized anthrax, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin, and other agents, and created delivery vehicles, including bombs, missile warheads, aerosol generators, and spray systems. Thereby, Iraq breached the provisions of the BWC, which it had signed in 1972, although it only ratified the Convention in 1991 as a condition of the cease-fire agreement that ended the 1991 Gulf War. The Iraqi biological weapons program—along with its chemical weapons program—was uncovered after the Gulf War through the investigations of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), which was responsible for disarmament in post-war Iraq. Iraq deliberately obstructed, delayed, and deceived the UNSCOM investigations and only admitted to having operated an offensive biological weapons program under significant pressure in 1995. While Iraq maintained that it ended its biological weapons program in 1991, many analysts believe that the country violated its BWC obligations by continuing the program until at least 1996.

==== Other accusations of non-compliance ====
In April 1997, Cuba invoked the provisions of Article V to request a formal consultative meeting to consider its allegations that the United States introduced the crop-eating insect &quot;Thrips palmi&quot; to Cuba via crop-spraying planes in October 1996. Cuba and the United States presented evidence for their diverging views on the incident in a formal consultation in August 1997. Having reviewed the evidence, twelve States Parties submitted reports, of which nine concluded that the evidence did not support the Cuban allegations, and two (China and Vietnam) maintained it was inconclusive.

At the Fifth BWC Review Conference in 2001, the United States charged four BWC States Parties—Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea—and one signatory, Syria, with operating covert biological weapons programs. Moreover, a 2019 report from the U.S. Department of State raises concerns regarding BWC compliance in China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. The report concluded that North Korea &quot;has an offensive biological weapons program and is in violation of its obligations under Articles I and II of the BWC&quot; and that Iran &quot;has not abandoned its (...) development of biological agents and toxins for offensive purposes&quot;.

A 2003 article published in &quot;Politics and the Life Sciences&quot; raised concerns about the compliance of the United States. Milton Leitenberg, James F. Leonard, and Richard Spertzel wrote that aspects of the U.S. biodefense program—particularly research conducted at the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center—could be perceived as violating the BWC. The authors said that research on genetically modified pathogens, pathogen dispersal modeling, and &quot;Red Teaming&quot; activities, which simulate biothreat scenarios, resembled elements of past offensive biological weapons programs. The report questioned whether these activities, though carried out under the guise of defense, risked undermining the treaty’s prohibitions.

In recent years, Russia has repeatedly alleged that the United States is supporting and operating biological weapons facilities in the Caucasus and Central Asia, in particular the Richard Lugar Center for Public Health Research in the Republic of Georgia. The U.S. Department of State called these allegations &quot;groundless&quot; and reaffirmed that &quot;all U.S. activities (...) [were] consistent with the obligations set forth in the Biological Weapons Convention&quot;. Biological weapons expert Filippa Lentzos agreed that the Russian allegations are &quot;unfounded&quot; and commented that they are &quot;part of a disinformation campaign&quot;. Similarly, Swedish biodefense specialists Roger Roffey and Anna-Karin Tunemalm called the allegations &quot;a Russian propaganda tool&quot;.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Federation convened a Formal Consultative Meeting under Article V of the Convention to address outstanding questions concerning the operation of biological laboratories in Ukraine by the United States. The meeting did not reach a consensus.

== Implementation Support Unit ==

After a decade of negotiations, the major effort to institutionally strengthen the BWC failed in 2001, which would have resulted in a legally binding protocol to establish an Organization for the Prohibition of Biological Weapons (OPBW). Against this background, the Sixth Review Conference in 2006 created an Implementation Support Unit (ISU) funded by the States Parties to the BWC and housed in the Geneva Branch of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs. The unit&#x27;s mandate is to provide administrative support, assist the national implementation of the BWC, encourage the treaty&#x27;s universal adoption, pair assistance requests and offers, and oversee the confidence-building measures process.

The ISU was initially composed of three full-time staff with a budget smaller than the average McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, and does not compare with the institutions established to deal with chemical or nuclear weapons. For example, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has about 500 employees, the International Atomic Energy Agency employs around 2,600 people, and the CTBTO Preparatory Commission employs around 280 staff. In December 2022, as a result of the Ninth Review Conference, States Parties decided to establish one new full-time staff position within the ISU, only for the period from 2023 to 2027. 

== Review Conferences ==
States Parties have formally reviewed the operation of the BWC at periodic Review Conferences held every five years; the first took place in 1980. The objective of these conferences is to ensure the effective realization of the convention&#x27;s goals and, in accordance with Article XII, to &quot;take into account any new scientific and technological developments relevant to the Convention&quot;. Most Review Conferences have adopted additional understandings or agreements that have interpreted or elaborated the meaning, scope, and implementation of BWC provisions. These additional understandings are contained in the final documents of the Review Conferences and in an overview document prepared by the BWC Implementation Support Unit for the Eighth Review Conference in 2016. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ninth Review Conference originally scheduled for 2021 was postponed to 2022.&lt;ref name=&quot;BWC/MSP/2020/7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intersessional program ==
As agreed at the Fifth Review Conference in 2001/2002, annual BWC meetings have been held between Review Conferences starting in 2003, referred to as the intersessional program. The intersessional program includes both annual Meetings of States Parties (MSP)—aiming to discuss, and promote common understanding and effective action on the topics identified by the Review Conference—as well as Meetings of Experts (MX), which serve as preparation for the Meeting of States Parties. The annual meetings do not have the mandate to adopt decisions, a privilege reserved for the Review Conferences which consider the results from the intersessional program.
== Challenges ==

=== Potential misuse of rapid scientific and technological developments ===
Advances in science and technology are relevant to the BWC since they may affect the threat presented by biological weapons. The ongoing advances in synthetic biology and enabling technologies are eroding the technological barriers to acquiring and genetically enhancing dangerous pathogens and using them for hostile purposes. For example, a 2019 report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute finds that &quot;advances in three specific emerging technologies—additive manufacturing (AM), artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics—could facilitate, each in their own way, the development or production of biological weapons and their delivery systems&quot;. Similarly, biological weapons expert Filippa Lentzos argues that the convergence of genomic technologies with &quot;machine learning, automation, affective computing, and robotics (...) [will] create the possibility of novel biological weapons that target particular groups of people and even individuals&quot;. On the other hand, these scientific developments may improve pandemic preparedness by strengthening prevention and response measures.

=== Technological challenges in the verification of biological weapons ===
There are several reasons why biological weapons are especially difficult to verify. First, in contrast to chemical and nuclear weapons, even small initial quantities of biological agents can be used to quickly produce militarily significant amounts. Second, biotechnological equipment and even dangerous pathogens and toxins cannot be prohibited altogether since they also have legitimate peaceful or defensive purposes, including the development of vaccines and medical therapies. Third, it is possible to rapidly eliminate biological agents, which makes short-notice inspections less effective in determining whether a facility produces biological weapons. For these reasons, Filippa Lentzos notes that &quot;it is not possible to verify the BWC with the same level of accuracy and reliability as the verification of nuclear treaties&quot;.

=== Financial health of the Convention ===
BWC intersessional program meetings have recently been impeded by late payments and non-payments of financial contributions. BWC States Parties agreed at the Meeting of States Parties in 2018, which was cut short due to funding shortfalls, on a package of remedial financial measures including the establishment of a Working Capital Fund. This fund is financed by voluntary contributions and provides short-term financing in order to ensure the continuity of approved programs and activities. At the Ninth Review Conference, States Parties welcomed the improvement of the financial situation following the measures endorsed by the 2018 Meeting of States Parties, confirmed their effectiveness and decided to review them at the Tenth Review Conference. Live information on the financial status of the BWC and other disarmament conventions is available publicly on the financial dashboard of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs.

<doc id="337083" wikidata="Q2072794" url="?curid=337083" title="Particle swarm optimization">
<text>In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle&#x27;s position and velocity. Each particle&#x27;s movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.

PSO is originally attributed to Kennedy, Eberhart and Shi and was first intended for simulating social behaviour, as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The book by Kennedy and Eberhart describes many philosophical aspects of PSO and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of PSO applications is made by Poli. In 2017, a comprehensive review on theoretical and experimental works on PSO has been published by Bonyadi and Michalewicz.

PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. Also, PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi-newton methods. However, metaheuristics such as PSO do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found. 

== Algorithm ==

A basic variant of the PSO algorithm works by having a population (called a swarm) of candidate solutions (called particles). These particles are moved around in the search-space according to a few simple formulae. The movements of the particles are guided by their own best-known position in the search-space as well as the entire swarm&#x27;s best-known position. When improved positions are being discovered these will then come to guide the movements of the swarm. The process is repeated and by doing so it is hoped, but not guaranteed, that a satisfactory solution will eventually be discovered.

Formally, let &quot;f&quot;: ℝ&quot;n&quot; → ℝ be the cost function which must be minimized. The function takes a candidate solution as an argument in the form of a vector of real numbers and produces a real number as output which indicates the objective function value of the given candidate solution. The gradient of &quot;f&quot; is not known. The goal is to find a solution a for which &quot;f&quot;(a) ≤ &quot;f&quot;(b) for all b in the search-space, which would mean a is the global minimum.

Let &quot;S&quot; be the number of particles in the swarm, each having a position xi ∈ ℝ&quot;n&quot; in the search-space and a velocity vi ∈ ℝ&quot;n&quot;. Let pi be the best known position of particle &quot;i&quot; and let g be the best known position of the entire swarm. A basic PSO algorithm to minimize the cost function is then:
 
 for each particle &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;S&quot; do
 Initialize the particle&#x27;s position with a uniformly distributed random vector: xi ~ &quot;U&quot;(blo, bup)
 Initialize the particle&#x27;s best known position to its initial position: pi ← xi
 if &quot;f&quot;(pi) &lt; &quot;f&quot;(g) then
 update the swarm&#x27;s best known position: g ← pi
 Initialize the particle&#x27;s velocity: vi ~ &quot;U&quot;(-|bup-blo|, |bup-blo|)
 while a termination criterion is not met do:
 for each particle &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;S&quot; do
 for each dimension &quot;d&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;n&quot; do
 Pick random numbers: &quot;r&quot;p, &quot;r&quot;g ~ &quot;U&quot;(0,1)
 Update the particle&#x27;s velocity: vi,d ← w vi,d + φp &quot;r&quot;p (pi,d-xi,d) + φg &quot;r&quot;g (gd-xi,d)
 Update the particle&#x27;s position: xi ← xi + vi
 if &quot;f&quot;(xi) &lt; &quot;f&quot;(pi) then
 Update the particle&#x27;s best known position: pi ← xi
 if &quot;f&quot;(pi) &lt; &quot;f&quot;(g) then
 Update the swarm&#x27;s best known position: g ← pi

The values blo and bup represent the lower and upper boundaries of the search-space respectively. The w parameter is the inertia weight. The parameters φp and φg are often called cognitive coefficient and social coefficient.

The termination criterion can be the number of iterations performed, or a solution where the adequate objective function value is found. The parameters w, φp, and φg are selected by the practitioner and control the behaviour and efficacy of the PSO method (below). 

== Parameter selection ==
The choice of PSO parameters can have a large impact on optimization performance. Selecting PSO parameters that yield good performance has therefore been the subject of much research.

To prevent divergence (&quot;explosion&quot;) the inertia weight must be smaller than 1. The two other parameters can be then derived thanks to the constriction approach, or freely selected, but the analyses suggest convergence domains to constrain them. Typical values are in formula_1.

The PSO parameters can also be tuned by using another overlaying optimizer, a concept known as meta-optimization, or even fine-tuned during the optimization, e.g., by means of fuzzy logic.

Parameters have also been tuned for various optimization scenarios.

==Neighbourhoods and topologies==
The topology of the swarm defines the subset of particles with which each particle can exchange information. The basic version of the algorithm uses the global topology as the swarm communication structure. This topology allows all particles to communicate with all the other particles, thus the whole swarm share the same best position g from a single particle. However, this approach might lead the swarm to be trapped into a local minimum, thus different topologies have been used to control the flow of information among particles. For instance, in local topologies, particles only share information with a subset of particles. This subset can be a geometrical one – for example &quot;the &quot;m&quot; nearest particles&quot; – or, more often, a social one, i.e. a set of particles that is not depending on any distance. In such cases, the PSO variant is said to be local best (vs global best for the basic PSO).

A commonly used swarm topology is the ring, in which each particle has just two neighbours, but there are many others. The topology is not necessarily static. In fact, since the topology is related to the diversity of communication of the particles, some efforts have been done to create adaptive topologies (SPSO, APSO, stochastic star, TRIBES, Cyber Swarm, and C-PSO)

By using the ring topology, PSO can attain generation-level parallelism, significantly enhancing the evolutionary speed.

== Inner workings ==
There are several schools of thought as to why and how the PSO algorithm can perform optimization.

A common belief amongst researchers is that the swarm behaviour varies between exploratory behaviour, that is, searching a broader region of the search-space, and exploitative behaviour, that is, a locally oriented search so as to get closer to a (possibly local) optimum. This school of thought has been prevalent since the inception of PSO. This school of thought contends that the PSO algorithm and its parameters must be chosen so as to properly balance between exploration and exploitation to avoid premature convergence to a local optimum yet still ensure a good rate of convergence to the optimum. This belief is the precursor of many PSO variants, see below.

Another school of thought is that the behaviour of a PSO swarm is not well understood in terms of how it affects actual optimization performance, especially for higher-dimensional search-spaces and optimization problems that may be discontinuous, noisy, and time-varying. This school of thought merely tries to find PSO algorithms and parameters that cause good performance regardless of how the swarm behaviour can be interpreted in relation to e.g. exploration and exploitation. Such studies have led to the simplification of the PSO algorithm, see below.

=== Convergence ===
In relation to PSO the word &quot;convergence&quot; typically refers to two different definitions:

* Convergence of the sequence of solutions (aka, stability analysis, converging) in which all particles have converged to a point in the search-space, which may or may not be the optimum,
* Convergence to a local optimum where all personal bests p or, alternatively, the swarm&#x27;s best known position g, approaches a local optimum of the problem, regardless of how the swarm behaves.

Convergence of the sequence of solutions has been investigated for PSO. These analyses have resulted in guidelines for selecting PSO parameters that are believed to cause convergence to a point and prevent divergence of the swarm&#x27;s particles (particles do not move unboundedly and will converge to somewhere). However, the analyses were criticized by Pedersen for being oversimplified as they assume the swarm has only one particle, that it does not use stochastic variables and that the points of attraction, that is, the particle&#x27;s best known position p and the swarm&#x27;s best known position g, remain constant throughout the optimization process. However, it was shown that these simplifications do not affect the boundaries found by these studies for parameter where the swarm is convergent. Considerable effort has been made in recent years to weaken the modeling assumption utilized during the stability analysis of PSO, with the most recent generalized result applying to numerous PSO variants and utilized what was shown to be the minimal necessary modeling assumptions.

Convergence to a local optimum has been analyzed for PSO in and. It has been proven that PSO needs some modification to guarantee finding a local optimum.

This means that determining the convergence capabilities of different PSO algorithms and parameters still depends on empirical results. One attempt at addressing this issue is the development of an &quot;orthogonal learning&quot; strategy for an improved use of the information already existing in the relationship between p and g, so as to form a leading converging exemplar and to be effective with any PSO topology. The aims are to improve the performance of PSO overall, including faster global convergence, higher solution quality, and stronger robustness. However, such studies do not provide theoretical evidence to actually prove their claims.

=== Adaptive mechanisms ===
Without the need for a trade-off between convergence (&#x27;exploitation&#x27;) and divergence (&#x27;exploration&#x27;), an adaptive mechanism can be introduced. Adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) features better search efficiency than standard PSO. APSO can perform global search over the entire search space with a higher convergence speed. It enables automatic control of the inertia weight, acceleration coefficients, and other algorithmic parameters at the run time, thereby improving the search effectiveness and efficiency at the same time. Also, APSO can act on the globally best particle to jump out of the likely local optima. However, APSO will introduce new algorithm parameters, it does not introduce additional design or implementation complexity nonetheless.

Besides, through the utilization of a scale-adaptive fitness evaluation mechanism, PSO can efficiently address computationally expensive optimization problems.

== Variants ==
Numerous variants of even a basic PSO algorithm are possible. For example, there are different ways to initialize the particles and velocities (e.g. start with zero velocities instead), how to dampen the velocity, only update pi and g after the entire swarm has been updated, etc. Some of these choices and their possible performance impact have been discussed in the literature.

A series of standard implementations have been created by leading researchers, &quot;intended for use both as a baseline for performance testing of improvements to the technique, as well as to represent PSO to the wider optimization community. Having a well-known, strictly-defined standard algorithm provides a valuable point of comparison which can be used throughout the field of research to better test new advances.&quot; The latest is Standard PSO 2011 (SPSO-2011).

=== Hybridization ===
New and more sophisticated PSO variants are also continually being introduced in an attempt to improve optimization performance. There are certain trends in that research; one is to make a hybrid optimization method using PSO combined with other optimizers, e.g., combined PSO with biogeography-based optimization, and the incorporation of an effective learning method.

=== Alleviate premature convergence===
Another research trend is to try to alleviate premature convergence (that is, optimization stagnation), e.g. by reversing or perturbing the movement of the PSO particles, another approach to deal with premature convergence is the use of multiple swarms (multi-swarm optimization). The multi-swarm approach can also be used to implement multi-objective optimization. Finally, there are developments in adapting the behavioural parameters of PSO during optimization.

=== Simplifications ===
Another school of thought is that PSO should be simplified as much as possible without impairing its performance; a general concept often referred to as Occam&#x27;s razor. Simplifying PSO was originally suggested by Kennedy and has been studied more extensively, where it appeared that optimization performance was improved, and the parameters were easier to tune and they performed more consistently across different optimization problems.

Another argument in favour of simplifying PSO is that metaheuristics can only have their efficacy demonstrated empirically by doing computational experiments on a finite number of optimization problems. This means a metaheuristic such as PSO cannot be proven correct and this increases the risk of making errors in its description and implementation. A good example of this presented a promising variant of a genetic algorithm (another popular metaheuristic) but it was later found to be defective as it was strongly biased in its optimization search towards similar values for different dimensions in the search space, which happened to be the optimum of the benchmark problems considered. This bias was because of a programming error, and has now been fixed.

==== Bare Bones PSO ====
Initialization of velocities may require extra inputs. The Bare Bones PSO variant has been proposed in 2003 by James Kennedy, and does not need to use velocity at all.

In this variant of PSO one dispences with the velocity of the particles and instead updates the positions of the particles using the following simple rule,
:formula_2
where formula_3, formula_4 are the position and the best position of the particle formula_5; formula_6 is the global best position; formula_7 is the normal distribution with the mean formula_8 and standard deviation formula_9; and where formula_10 signifies the norm of a vector.

==== Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization ====
Another simpler variant is the accelerated particle swarm optimization (APSO), which also does not need to use velocity and can speed up the convergence in many applications. A simple demo code of APSO is available.

In this variant of PSO one dispences with both the particle&#x27;s velocity and the particle&#x27;s best position. The particle position is updated according to the following rule,
:formula_11
where formula_12 is a random uniformly distributed vector, formula_13 is the typical length of the problem at hand, and formula_14 and formula_15 are the parameters of the method. As a refinement of the method one can decrease formula_16 with each iteration, formula_17, where formula_18 is the number of the iteration and formula_19 is the decrease control parameter.

===Multi-objective optimization===
PSO has also been applied to multi-objective problems, in which the objective function comparison takes Pareto dominance into account when moving the PSO particles and non-dominated solutions are stored so as to approximate the pareto front.

===Binary, discrete, and combinatorial===
As the PSO equations given above work on real numbers, a commonly used method to solve discrete problems is to map the discrete search space to a continuous domain, to apply a classical PSO, and then to demap the result. Such a mapping can be very simple (for example by just using rounded values) or more sophisticated.

However, it can be noted that the equations of movement make use of operators that perform four actions:
*computing the difference of two positions. The result is a velocity (more precisely a displacement)
*multiplying a velocity by a numerical coefficient
*adding two velocities
*applying a velocity to a position

Usually a position and a velocity are represented by &quot;n&quot; real numbers, and these operators are simply -, *, +, and again +. But all these mathematical objects can be defined in a completely different way, in order to cope with binary problems (or more generally discrete ones), or even combinatorial ones. One approach is to redefine the operators based on sets.

<text>The Panteón Civil de Dolores is the largest cemetery in Mexico and contains the Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres (). It is located on &quot;Avenida Constituyentes&quot; in the Miguel Hidalgo borough of Mexico City, between sections two and three of Chapultepec Park.

==History==
The history of the cemetery goes back to 1870, when Juan Manuel Benfield—owner of El Rancho de Coscoacoaco (his wife was Concepción Gayosso y Mugarrieta, sister of Eusebio Gayosso)—set aside an area of his ranch measuring , called &quot;La Tabla de Dolores&quot;, on which he intended to establish a cemetery. In 1875, the cemetery was opened and named &quot;El Panteón Civil de Dolores&quot;. Juan Manuel Benfield founded the cemetery in honor of his sister, who died in Veracruz shortly after she had arrived from London, England with their parents. As they were Anglicans, and all cemeteries in Veracruz were consecrated for use only by Roman Catholics, the only suitable burial ground to be had was on the beach. Today, the cemetery has about 700,000 tombs, many with multiple occupants.

==The Rotunda of Illustrious Persons==

The &quot;Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres&quot; (Rotunda of Illustrious Persons) is a site that honors those who are considered to have exalted the civic, national and human values of Mexico. It contains the graves of those who have made important contributions in the military, civic and cultural fields. Originally named “The Rotunda of Illustrious Men” (&quot;Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres&quot;), it was conceived by then President Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada as a space to perpetuate the memory of chosen men. The decree reads, “&quot;In this place of honor, the necessary land will be given free of charge to erect the monuments designed to guard the remains of or perpetuate the memory of the illustrious men who are decreed or for whom posthumous honors are decreed&quot;.”

In 1876, the first person to be honored with a burial there was a soldier by the name of Pedro Litechipia, who died fighting against the empire of Maximilian. By decree of President Vicente Fox, in 2003, the name was changed to “Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres” (“Rotunda of Distinguished Persons”, rather than ‘men’) as the Rotunda has a number of female occupants. The Rotunda contains the graves of three former presidents, many heroes from the Mexican Revolution, writers, artists and scientists. The National General Archive shows 104 images of those buried there.

==Problems==

Generally considered the largest cemetery in Latin America, the most serious problem at the cemetery is limited space. No new grave sites have been established since 1975, and only those individuals who have purchased a site in-perpetuity, prior to 1977, can bury relatives in the cemetery; however, the remains must be stacked above those who are already interred. Municipal laws permit a maximum of five bodies to be buried in the same plot, yet some tombs may have as many as ten buried on top of each other.

The cemetery is working to encourage the acceptance and practice of cremation as an acceptable alternative. The crowded cemetery, along with the desires of many to be interred there, has created a higher demand for exhumations as well as cremation services. The cemetery has four crematoria, averaging about four cremations daily. However, an average of ten traditional burials are still performed each day, all in graves that have been used previously.

The cemetery is listed with National Institute of Anthropology and History as an historical monument, due to the many iconic persons interred there and the old age of the property. However, this status has not kept the cemetery in good repair. There are problems with maintenance as well as security. In the back part of the cemetery, in a gully, workers have discarded old caskets and urns that are considered unusable. Those who work in the cemetery bear witness or can attest to graverobbing for artistic and archaeologically-significant pieces.

In January 2009, a section of the original south-side retaining wall that was built in the 19th century crumbled and fell, damaging a number of graves in the process. This section was over 1 km long and 4 meters high. Rehabilitation work had been scheduled for September 2008, at a cost of 10 million pesos, with a focus of making the cemetery more dignified for visitors, including the remodeling of the main entrance on Constituyentes Avenue.

<text>Yeovil Town Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Yeovil in Somerset, England. The team competes in the National League, the fifth level of the English football league system, after winning the 2023–24 National League South title. The club&#x27;s home ground is Huish Park, built in 1990 on the site of an old army camp. That stadium is named after their former home, Huish, known for its pitch, which had an sideline to sideline slope. The club&#x27;s nickname &quot;the Glovers&quot; is a reference to the history of glove-making in the town of Yeovil, which became a centre of the industry during the 18th and 19th centuries.

Founded in 1895, the club initially joined the Somerset Senior League and competed in a multitude of leagues up until the outbreak of World War II. During this time they won titles in the Southern League, Western League, Bristol Charity League, Dorset District League and Somerset Senior League. They played in the Southern League after the war ended, winning the championship in 1954–55, 1963–64 and 1970–71, before becoming members of the Alliance Premier League from 1979 to 1985. They spent the next three years in the Isthmian League, and were promoted into the Conference after finishing as champions in 1987–88. Relegated in 1995, they were promoted again two years later after winning another Isthmian League title. Yeovil won the 2002 FA Trophy final and secured a place in the Football League after winning the Conference in 2002–03 under the stewardship of Gary Johnson. They then won the League Two title in 2004–05, before reaching the Championship with victory in the 2013 Football League One play-off final in Johnson&#x27;s second spell as manager. However they suffered consecutive relegations, and were relegated once more following the 2018–19 season, ending their 16-season spell in the Football League.

Yeovil are one of the most successful non-league teams in the FA Cup, having defeated major Football League teams, most famously Sunderland in the fourth round in 1949, before going on to play in front of more than 81,000 spectators away at Manchester United in the next round. For some years, as the only Football League side in Somerset, they have had few local rivalries as the club climbed the divisions in the 2000s, though their most notable is the derby shared with Dorset side, Weymouth.

==History==

===Non-League football===
Yeovil Football Club was founded in 1890, and shared its ground with the local rugby club for many years. Five years later, the current club was founded and named Yeovil Casuals and started playing home games at the Pen Mill Athletic Ground. In 1907 the name Yeovil Town was adopted, which on amalgamation with Petters United became Yeovil and Petters United. The name reverted to Yeovil Town before the 1946–47 season.

The club came to national attention as &#x27;giant-killers&#x27; during the 1948–49 FA Cup, in which they defeated Sunderland 2–1 in the fourth round, in front of a record home attendance of 17,000. They were defeated 8–0 in the following round by Manchester United.

Between 1955 and 1973 they were champions of the Southern Football League three times, and runners-up twice. During this period, Yeovil Town applied for election to the Football League on a number of occasions, coming within a few votes of being elected in 1976. In 1979 the Glovers were founder members of the new national non-league division, the Alliance Premier League. In 1985, they were relegated to the Isthmian League. Yeovil won that championship in 1988 and returned to the Conference.

There was success in the Bob Lord Challenge Trophy in 1990 and three years later Yeovil finished fourth in the Conference, their best finish ever. In January 1995, former Weymouth and Spurs player Graham Roberts was appointed manager, but demotion back to the Isthmian League soon followed. Yeovil secured promotion back into the Conference in 1997 after winning the Isthmian League with a record number of points – 101.

Colin Lippiatt became manager for the 1998–99 season and brought Terry Skiverton to the club as a player. Gary Johnson took over as manager in June 2001 and Yeovil won the FA Trophy in his first season in charge with a 2–0 victory over Stevenage Borough in the final at Villa Park – the club&#x27;s first major trophy. Yeovil Town earned promotion to the Football League in the following season, by winning the Football Conference by a record 17 points margin, accumulating 95 points and scoring 100 goals, remaining unbeaten at Huish Park. Their team included many top players, some of whom went on to play Premier League football. Notable players include Gavin Williams who moved to West Ham United, Lee Johnson, Chris Weale, Darren Way and Adam Lockwood.

===Reaching the Football League===
Yeovil&#x27;s first game in the Football League was a 3–1 away win over Rochdale. The Glovers finished their first season in eighth position, and reached the third round of the FA Cup before losing 2–0 at home to Liverpool. Before the game the club released a record sold only in shops in the town: &quot;Yeovil True&quot; reached No. 36 in the UK Singles Chart. The following season Yeovil finished as champions of League Two with 83 points, earning promotion to League One. During the season the club was sold by Jon Goddard-Watts to David Webb, who took over the role of chief executive from chairman John Fry.

At the beginning of the 2005–06 season manager Gary Johnson left Yeovil for Bristol City. He was replaced by his assistant Steve Thompson and Kevin Hodges was appointed as his number two. At the season&#x27;s end Thompson was demoted to first-team coach and he was replaced by Russell Slade. Around this time John Fry had bought all Dave Webb&#x27;s share of the club, becoming Yeovil Town&#x27;s new owner. They again reached the fourth round of the FA Cup and were drawn away against Charlton Athletic, then in the Premier League, to whom they lost 3–2.

Yeovil finished the 2006–07 season in fifth position, qualifying for the League One play-offs. In the semi-final Yeovil beat Nottingham Forest in the two-legged match 5–4 on aggregate, after losing the first home leg 2–0. Yeovil met Blackpool at Wembley Stadium in the final, but were beaten 2–0.

The 2007–08 was less successful, as Yeovil finished 18th in League One with 52 points. Russell Slade continued as Yeovil manager into the 2008–09 season, but he left the position in February 2009. After one game with assistant manager Steve Thompson acting as caretaker manager, club captain Terry Skiverton was announced as manager until the end of the 2009–10 season, with Nathan Jones as his assistant. The duo kept Yeovil in League One, with safety secured following a 1–1 draw at Tranmere Rovers.

Skiverton and Jones helped Yeovil avoid relegation in the following two seasons, but a poor start the 2011–12 campaign prompted a change of manager. On 9 January 2012, the club announced the re-appointment of Gary Johnson, with Terry Skiverton becoming assistant. The Glovers went on to again achieve safety, finishing 11 points clear of the relegation zone.

Yeovil made their best ever start in the 2012–13 season, picking up 10 points from their first four games. Yeovil finished the 2012–13 season in fourth place, reaching the League One play-offs. They reached the final on 6 May 2013 after a 2–0 home victory against Sheffield United, overturning a 1–0 loss at Bramall Lane in the first leg. On 19 May 2013, Yeovil defeated Brentford 2–1 in the League One play-off final at Wembley, reaching the second tier for the first time in their history. Striker Paddy Madden, who netted the opening goal against Brentford at Wembley, finished as the league&#x27;s top scorer.

Yeovil spent one season in the Championship and, despite enjoying memorable victories over Nottingham Forest, Sheffield Wednesday and Watford, suffered immediate relegation back to League One. The club&#x27;s struggles continued the following season, although the club did earn a lucrative FA Cup tie against Manchester United, which they lost 2–0 despite a &quot;gallant challenge&quot;. Manager Gary Johnson was eventually replaced by Paul Sturrock as Yeovil suffered another relegation, returning to League Two for the first time in 10 years.

Following a poor start to the 2015/16 season, Sturrock was sacked and replaced by Darren Way, initially in a caretaker role before being named permanent manager. Way was able to lead Yeovil to safety as they finished their campaign 19th in the table. During Way&#x27;s tenure as manager, Yeovil equalled their record for heaviest Football League defeat with an 8–2 loss to Luton Town on the opening day of the 2017–18 season, although they also recorded their highest Football League victory under his leadership with a 6–0 win over Newport County in September 2018. The club also enjoyed another FA Cup tie with Manchester United in January 2018, however they lost 4–0 to José Mourinho&#x27;s side.

=== Return to non-League football ===
Yeovil&#x27;s 16-year stay in the EFL came to an end when they were relegated during the 2018–19 season, following a 2–2 draw with Northampton Town. Darren Sarll was unveiled as the club&#x27;s new manager in June 2019 and a takeover of the club by a consortium led by Scott Priestnell and Errol Pope was announced in September 2019. On 22 April, the 2019–20 National League season was ended with immediate effect due to the coronavirus outbreak, with the Glovers fourth in the table. In May 2022, South Somerset District Council completed the purchase of Huish Park and its surrounding land for £2.8 million from Yeovil Town&#x27;s owner Scott Priestnall, with the football club becoming tenants of the council through a leaseback arrangement.

In February 2023, it was announced that SU Glovers Limited, a company publicly fronted by Matt Uggla and former England rugby union international Paul Sackey, was in the process of completing a takeover of the majority shareholding of Yeovil Town Football and Athletic Club Limited. It was confirmed (ultimately prematurely) that former majority shareholder and chairman, Scott Priestnall, would no longer be involved with the football club. In April 2023, the club was relegated to the National League South. On 2 May 2023, it was reported that the SU Glovers takeover would not be proceeding; on 13 May 2023, Yeovil was taken over by a local company, the Hellier Group. 

At the end of the 2023–24 season, Yeovil secured an immediate return to the National League after winning the National League South title.

===Recent seasons===

==Rivalries ==

Yeovil have their fiercest rivalry with Dorset club, Weymouth, which has been described as intense. Often when the two clubs meet, a large police presence is required to separate the two sets of fans. In October 2021, fans reportedly clashed before and after the game in Huish, with mounted police and dog units being called into action. The 2020–21 National League season marked the first league encounters between the club and Weymouth since the 1988–89 Football Conference season.

The club also shares a minor historic derby with fellow Somerset club, Bath City, with Yeovil playing them 274 times. Albeit since the turn of the century, the majority of any animosity dissipated heavily. Hereford United were also seen as rivals, before their dissolution in 2014, due to both clubs being fairly well matched during their time in non-league ranks. During the club&#x27;s time in the EFL, Yeovil fans considered both Bristol Rovers and Bristol City to be rivals. In August 2009, Yeovil played Exeter City for the first time in the league, and both clubs have shared a rivalry since, with the match often being billed as a Westcountry Derby. Swindon Town and AFC Bournemouth were also considered somewhat rivals due to geographical proximity.

<doc id="337090" wikidata="Q1129964" url="?curid=337090" title="Society for American Baseball Research">
<text>The Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) is a membership organization dedicated to fostering the research and dissemination of the history and statistical record of baseball. The organization was founded in Cooperstown, New York, on August 10, 1971, at a meeting of 16 &quot;statistorians&quot; coordinated by sportswriter Bob Davids. The organization now reports a membership of over 7,500 and is based in Phoenix, Arizona.

==Membership==
While the acronym &quot;SABR&quot; was used to coin the word sabermetrics (for the use of sophisticated mathematical tools to analyze baseball), the Society is about much more than statistics. Well-known figures in the baseball world such as Bob Costas, Keith Olbermann, Craig R. Wright, and Rollie Hemond are members, along with highly regarded &quot;sabermetricians&quot; such as Bill James and Rob Neyer.

Among Major League Baseball players, Jeff Bajenaru was believed to have been (until 2006) the only active player with a SABR membership; Elden Auker, Larry Dierker, and Andy Seminick also have been involved.

Some prominent SABR members include: 

* Bob Davids, founder (deceased)
* Bob McConnell, Home Run Log (deceased)
* Bill James, analyst, writer
* David Lander, actor (Laverne &amp; Shirley), baseball scout (deceased)
* Larry Lester, Negro Leagues Committee 
* Stan Musial, Hall of Famer for the St. Louis Cardinals (deceased)
* David Neft, writer, historian, encyclopedist
* David Nemec, prolific writer
* Rob Neyer, analyst, journalist
* Pete Palmer, analyst, encyclopedist
* Dave Smith, analyst, Retrosheet founder
* John Thorn, historian, encyclopedist
* Robert L. Tiemann, historian
* Monte Irvin, Hall of Famer and former Negro Leagues star (deceased)
* David W. Vincent, Home Run Log (deceased)
* Larry Dierker, former Major League All-Star pitcher
==Activities==
Only a minority of members pursue &quot;number crunching&quot; research. Rather, the SABR community is organized both by interest and geography:

*Research Committees study a particular issue
*Regional Chapters link members by proximity. The latter are frequently named after baseball personalities relevant to their region.

SABR members keep in touch through online directories and electronic mailing lists set up through the SABR headquarters. The headquarters also maintains a number of research tools on its website, including a lending library, home run and triple play logs, and course syllabi related to the game.

SABR holds annual conventions in a different city each year. The conference generally includes panel discussions, research presentations, city-specific tourism, a ballgame, and an awards banquet. The 2017 convention in New York City, set the attendance record with 806 registered attendees out of approximately 7,000 SABR members. The organization also hosts an annual baseball analytics conference in Phoenix and a Negro Leagues conference, which is held in a different location each year.

===Projects and collections===
* Biography Project, with members authoring well-researched and engaging biographies of a growing list of former big league ballplayers and other notable contributors to the game.
* Games Project, where members research, write, and publish accounts of the major league regular season, postseason, and All-Star Games, including Negro Leagues games, along with other games of historical significance such as in the minor leagues or international or exhibition contests.
* Oral History Collection, a collection of interviews conducted with ballplayers, executives, scouts, authors, writers, broadcasters, and other figures of historical baseball significance.
* SABR-Rucker Archive, an extensive collection of baseball photographs which contain nearly 80,000 images dating from the 19th century to modern-day baseball.

== Publications ==
The Baseball Research Journal (BRJ) is SABR&#x27;s flagship publication since 1972 for members to publish and share their research with like-minded students of baseball. The National Pastime is an annual, published from 1982 to 2008 as The National Pastime: A Review of Baseball History, when it was intended as a more literary outlet than the stats oriented &quot;BRJ&quot;; since 2009 it is a convention-focused journal, with articles about the geographic region where the convention is taking place that year. Other Society publications are an increasing variety of books (since 1976) and ebooks (since 2011); 8–10 new e-books published annually are all free to members.

==Awards==
SABR annual awards include:
* Bob Davids Award: for exceptional SABR members who have made contributions to SABR and baseball that reflect ingenuity, integrity, and self-sacrifice. It is SABR&#x27;s highest honor, and was established in 1985.
* Henry Chadwick Award: for baseball researchers—historians, statisticians, annalists, and archivists.
* Seymour Medal: best book of baseball history or biography published during the preceding calendar year.
* McFarland-SABR Baseball Research Award: for authors of the best articles on baseball history or biography completed during the preceding calendar year (published or unpublished).
* Sporting News-SABR Baseball Research Award: for projects which do not fit the criteria for The Seymour Medal or the McFarland-SABR Award.
* Jerry Malloy Book Prize: best book-length nonfiction manuscript submitted by a member of SABR.
* Doug Pappas Research Award: best oral research presentation at the Annual Convention.
* Lee Allen Award: for the best baseball research project at the annual National History Day competition.
* Jack Kavanagh Memorial Youth Baseball Research Award: research paper by a researcher in grades 6–8 (middle school category), grades 9–12 (high school category), or undergraduates 22 and under (College Category).
* Dorothy Seymour Mills Lifetime Achievement Award: awarded to any person with a sustained involvement in women&#x27;s baseball or any woman with a longtime involvement in baseball in any fashion — player, umpire, writer, executive, team owner, scout, etc. 

In 2013, SABR began collaborating with Rawlings on the Gold Glove Award. Rawlings changed the voting process to incorporate SABR Defensive Index, a sabermetric component provided by SABR, which accounts for approximately 25 percent of the vote for the defensive award.

<text>The Allan Cup is the trophy awarded annually to the senior ice hockey champions of Canada. It was donated by Sir Montagu Allan of Ravenscrag, Montreal, and has been competed for since 1909. It was won by the Dundas Real McCoys in 2024.

==History==
In 1908, a split occurred in the competition of ice hockey in Canada. The top amateur teams left the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association, which allowed professionals, to form the new Inter-Provincial Amateur Hockey Union (IPAHU), a purely amateur league. The trustees of the Stanley Cup decided that the Cup would be awarded to the professional ice champion, meaning there was no corresponding trophy for the amateur championship of Canada. The Allan Cup was donated in early 1909 by Montreal businessman and Montreal Amateur Athletic Association president Sir H. Montagu Allan to be presented to the amateur champions of Canada. It was to be ruled like the Stanley Cup had, passed by champion to champion by league championship or challenge. Three trustees were named to administer the trophy: Sir Edward Clouston, President of the Bank of Montreal, Dr. H. B. Yates of McGill University, (donor of the Yates Cup to the Intercollegiate Rugby Union in 1898) and Graham Drinkwater, four-time Stanley Cup champion.

The trophy was originally presented to the Victoria Hockey Club of Montreal, Quebec, members of the IPAHU, to award to the champions of the IPAHU. The first IPAHU champion, and by extension, first winner of the Cup was the Ottawa Cliffsides hockey club. After the season, the Cliffsides were defeated in the first-ever challenge by the Queen&#x27;s University hockey club of Kingston, Ontario.

In the early years, trustees of the Cup quickly came to appreciate the difficulties of organizing a national competition in so large a country. In 1914, at the suggestion of one of the trustees, Claude C. Robinson, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) was formed as a national governing body for the sport with W. F. Taylor as its first president. One of the CAHA&#x27;s first decisions, in 1915, was to replace the challenge system with a series of national playoffs. Starting in 1920, the Allan Cup champion team would represent Canada in amateur play at the Olympics and World Championships. The CAHA used the profits from Allan Cup games as a subsidy for the national team. Competition for the cup was originally a one-game format, then a two-game total goals format. In 1925, CAHA leaders Silver Quilty and Frank Sandercock, changed the format to a best-of-three series due to increased popularity of the games and demand for a longer series.

At the CAHA general meeting in March 1927, W. A. Fry requested to have the CAHA take control of the Allan Cup and its profits from the trustees, and use the funds to build amateur hockey in Canada. He felt the move justified as the CAHA had evolved and was able to manage its own affairs. His motion asked for H. Montagu Allan to donate the cup to the CAHA, and establish an Allan Cup committee which included trustee William Northey.

In February 1945, CAHA president Frank Sargent announced the cancellation of the 1945 Allan Cup playoffs. It was the first season in which the trophy was not contested since the inaugural 1909 Allan Cup. The cancellation was caused by the reluctance to travel during wartime conditions, and the players&#x27; need to work rather than playing hockey.

In 1951, the CAHA set up a &quot;major league&quot; of competition from the semi-pro and professional senior leagues. The leagues would no longer compete for the Allan Cup, but would compete for the new Alexander Cup. The Allan Cup would be competed for on a more purely amateur basis from teams in smaller centres of Canada. The major league concept broke up by 1953, and the Alexander Cup competition was retired after 1954.

The reigning Allan Cup champion was usually chosen to represent Canada in ice hockey at the Olympic Games or the Ice Hockey World Championships. The practice lasted from 1920 to 1964, when Father David Bauer established a permanent Canada men&#x27;s national ice hockey team.

Since 1984 the Allan Cup has been competed for by teams in the Senior AAA category. Although interest in senior ice hockey has diminished over its history, the Cup retains an important place in Canadian ice hockey. The Cup championship is determined in an annual tournament held in the city or town of a host team, playing off against regional champions.

The Cup has been won by teams from every province and from Yukon, as well as by two teams from the United States which played in Canadian leagues. The city with the most Allan Cup championships is Thunder Bay with 10, including four won as Port Arthur before the city&#x27;s amalgamation. The original Cup has been retired to the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a replica is presented to the champions.

<text>The Middle Colonies were a subset of the Thirteen Colonies in British America, located between the New England Colonies and the Southern Colonies. Along with the Chesapeake Colonies, this area now roughly makes up the Mid-Atlantic states.

Much of the area was part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland until the British exerted their control over the region. The British captured much of the area in their war with the Dutch around 1664, and the majority of the conquered land became the Province of New York. The Duke of York and the King of England would later grant others ownership of the land which would become the Province of New Jersey and the Province of Pennsylvania. The Delaware Colony later separated from Pennsylvania, which was founded by William Penn.

The Middle Colonies had much fertile soil, which allowed the area to become a major exporter of wheat and other grains. The lumber and shipbuilding industries were also successful in the Middle Colonies because of the abundant forests, and Pennsylvania was moderately successful in the textile and iron industries. The Middle Colonies were the most ethnically and religiously diverse British colonies in North America with settlers from England, Scotland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and German states. Farm land was both productive and much less expensive than in Europe. Later settlers included members of various Protestant denominations, which were protected in the Middle Colonies by written freedom of religion laws. This tolerance was very unusual and distinct from the situation in other British colonies.

==History==
The Middle Colonies were explored by Henry Hudson for the Dutch East India Company in 1609, sailing up the Hudson River to present-day Albany, New York, and along the Delaware Bay. The Dutch further explored and charted the area in multiple voyages between 1610 and 1616; the first Dutch settlements were built in 1613 and the name New Netherland appeared on maps from 1614 on. With Swedish funding, the third governor of New Netherland later founded the colony of New Sweden in the region around Delaware Bay in 1638. This area was reclaimed by the Dutch in 1655. In October 1664, as a prelude to the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the English largely conquered this land from the Dutch. Though the war ended in a Dutch victory in 1667, the English retained New Netherland and renamed it New York after the English King&#x27;s brother, the Duke of York, who had co-instigated the war for personal gain and had commanded the attack on New Netherland. In 1673, the Dutch retook the area but relinquished it under the Treaty of Westminster (1674), ending the Third Anglo-Dutch War the next year.

==Province of New Jersey==
King Charles II renamed the land west of the Hudson River in New Jersey, and gave the region between New England and Maryland to his brother, the Duke of York, who later became King James II of England, as a proprietary colony. James II later granted the land between the Hudson River and the Delaware River to two friends who had been loyal to him through the English Civil War: Sir George Carteret and Lord Berkeley of Stratton. This land grant became the Province of New Jersey.

In 1665, the Concession and Agreement was written in an effort to entice settlers to New Jersey. This document provided for religious freedom, no taxes without assembly approval, and a governor appointed by the proprietors. The first governor appointed in this way was Philip Carteret, who founded Elizabethtown. Colonists were required to pay annual quit-rent taxes. On March 18, 1674, after encountering difficulty collecting the taxes, Lord Berkeley sold his share in the colony to Edward Byllynge, a Quaker businessman from London. This sale divided New Jersey into East Jersey and West Jersey; however, the border between the two was not agreed upon until the Quintipartite Deed in 1676. From 1701 to 1765, colonists skirmished in the New York-New Jersey Line War over disputed colonial boundaries.

On April 15, 1702, Queen Anne united West and East Jersey into one Royal Colony, the Province of New Jersey. Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon became the royal colony&#x27;s first governor. After Hyde was recalled to England in 1708 over charges of graft, bribery, and corruption, the governor of New York was charged to also preside over New Jersey. Finally, in 1738, King George II appointed a separate governor, Lewis Morris, to run New Jersey.

The Provincial Congress of New Jersey, made up of elected delegates, formed in January 1776 to govern the colony. The Congress had Royal Governor William Franklin arrested on June 15, declaring him &quot;an enemy to the liberties of this country&quot;. On July 2, 1776, New Jersey enacted the New Jersey State Constitution, soon after having empowered delegates to the Continental Congress, on June 21, to join in a declaration of independence. The United States Declaration of Independence ended their colonial status.

==Province of Pennsylvania==

King Charles II granted the land for the Pennsylvania Colony to William Penn on March 4, 1681 as payment for a debt the crown owed his family. Penn wrote the Frame of Government of Pennsylvania before departing for the colony, which called for religious tolerance towards many groups, including the Religious Society of Friends and local natives. As a proprietary colony, Penn governed Pennsylvania, yet its citizens were still subject to the English crown and laws. Penn&#x27;s cousin William Markham served as the first colonial deputy governor.

Demarcated by the 42nd parallel north and 39th parallel north, Pennsylvania was bordered by the Delaware River and the colonies of New York, Maryland, and New Jersey. In 1704, Dutch land given to Penn by the Duke of York was separated and once again became part of the Delaware Colony. From 1692 to 1694, revolution in England deprived Penn of the governance of his colony. The Pennsylvania Assembly took this opportunity to request expanded power for elected officials, led by David Lloyd. Upon visiting the colony in 1669 and 1701, Penn eventually agreed to allow their Charter of Privileges to be added to the constitution. When the British banned western expansion in 1764, fighting among colonists and against the natives swelled. In 1773, Arthur St. Clair ordered the arrest of a Virginian officer who was commanding troops against armed settlers loyal to Pennsylvania. Pennsylvanian revolutionary sentiment continued to grow, and Philadelphia, the largest city in America, soon became the meeting place of the Continental Congress. The publication of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 by locally elected revolutionaries concluded the history of the Colony, and began the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

==Province of New York==
The first Dutch settlements in the New York area appeared around 1613. The English captured the New Netherland Colony from the Dutch in 1664, renaming it the Province of New York after the King&#x27;s brother, the Duke of York (later King James II). The Dutch recaptured the colony in July 1673 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, but gave it back to the English under the Treaty of Westminster in exchange for Suriname. The Duke of York never governed the colony himself: he instead appointed governors, councils, and other officers to run the government. Richard Nicolls served as the first governor of New York.

In 1665, the Province of New Jersey split from New York; however, the New York-New Jersey Line War continued until the final borders were decided in 1769, and approved by the legislatures and the King in 1772 and 1773 respectively. A Colonial Assembly convened in October 1683, making New York the last colony to have an assembly. A constitution was drafted and passed on October 30, 1683, giving the colonists many rights, including the rights to no taxation without representation. However, upon learning of the constitution, James II declared it void.

When the Duke of York became King James II of England, New York became a royal province. In May 1688 the province briefly became part of the Dominion of New England. When James II was overthrown, the citizens of New York rebelled against the Royal Governor in Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion. When Henry Sloughter became governor in March 1691, the rebellion was crushed and its leader, Jacob Leisler was arrested, tried, and executed for treason. New York&#x27;s charter and constitution were reinstated soon after. In April 1775, American patriots formed the New York Provincial Congress to replace the assembly. Governor William Tryon and all royal officials were forced from the colony on October 19, 1775. Colonial status ended for the new state with the United States Declaration of Independence in July 1776.

==Delaware Colony==

Delaware changed hands between the Dutch and Swedes between 1631 and 1655. The Dutch maintained control of Delaware until 1664, when Sir Robert Carr took New Amstel for the Duke of York, renaming it New Castle. A Deputy of the Duke governed Delaware from 1664 to 1682. When William Penn received his land grant of Pennsylvania in 1681, he received the Delaware area from the Duke of York, and dubbed them &quot;The Three Lower Counties on the Delaware River&quot;. In 1701, after he had troubles governing the ethnically diverse Delaware territory, Penn agreed to allow them a separate colonial assembly.

==Geography==
The partly unglaciated Middle Colonies enjoyed fertile soil vastly different from the nearby New England Colonies, which contained more rocky soil. Because of the large grain exports resulting from this soil, the colonies came to be known as the Bread Basket Colonies. Pennsylvania became a leading exporter of wheat, corn, rye, hemp, and flax, making it the leading food producer in the colonies, and later states, between the years of 1725 and 1840. Broad navigable rivers of relaxed current like the Susquehanna River, the Delaware River, and the Hudson River attracted diverse business. Fur trappers moved along these rivers, and there was enough flow to enable milling with water wheel power.

==Industry==
Abundant forests attracted both the lumbering and shipbuilding industries to the Middle Colonies. These industries, along with the presence of deep river estuaries, led to the appearance of important ports like New York and Philadelphia. While the Middle Colonies had far more industry than the Southern Colonies, it still did not rival the industry of New England. In Pennsylvania, sawmills and gristmills were abundant, and the textile industry grew quickly. The colony also became a major producer of pig iron and its products, including the Pennsylvania long rifle and the Conestoga wagon. Other important industries included printing, publishing, and the related industry of papermaking.

==Politics==
The Middle Colonies&#x27; political groups began as small groups with narrowly focused goals. These coalitions eventually grew into diverse and large political organizations, evolving especially during the French and Indian War.

The Middle Colonies were generally run by Royal or Proprietary Governors and elected Colonial Assemblies. Many Middle Colony constitutions guaranteed freedom of religion and forbade taxation without representation. Royal governors were arrested or overthrown on more than one occasion, most notably when New Jersey arrested its governor and during Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion in New York. Growing unrest in the Middle Colonies eventually led the region to become the meeting place for the Continental Congress, and a center for revolution. However, there were numerous pockets of neutrals and Loyalists.

==Demographics==
The Middle Colonies tended to mix aspects of the New England and Southern Colonies. Landholdings were generally farms of , owned by the family that worked it. In New York&#x27;s Hudson Valley, however, the Dutch patroons operated very large landed estates and rented land to tenant farmers.

Ethnically, the Middle Colonies were more diverse than the other British colonial regions in North America and tended to be more socially tolerant. For example, in New York, any foreigner professing Christianity was awarded citizenship, leading to a more diverse populace. As a consequence, early German settlements in the Americas concentrated in the Middle Colonies region. Indentured servitude was especially common in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York in the 18th century, though fewer worked in agriculture.

German immigrants favored the Middle Colonies. German immigration greatly increased around 1717, and many immigrants began coming from the Rhineland. They were erroneously labeled the Pennsylvania Dutch (the German word for German is &quot;Deutsch&quot;), and comprised one-third of the population by the time of the American Revolution. The industry and farming skills they brought with them helped solidify the Middle Colonies&#x27; prosperity. They were noted for tight-knit religious communities, mostly Lutheran but also including many smaller sects such as the Moravians, Mennonites and Amish

The Scotch-Irish began immigrating to the Middle Colonies in waves after 1717. They primarily pushed farther into the western frontier of the colonies, where they repeatedly confronted the Indians. Other groups included the French Huguenots, Welsh, Dutch, Swedes, Swiss, and Scots Highlanders.

===English colonists===
When the English took direct control of the Middle Colonies around 1664, many Quakers from Rhode Island had already been pushed into the region by Puritans, while Episcopalian businessmen settled in Philadelphia and New York City.

Welsh Quakers, Baptists and Methodists settled in the Welsh Tract of Pennsylvania. While some Welsh colonists like Roger Williams, left to found Rhode Island, Anne Hutchinson founded a seed settlement in New York. Rhode Island was not initially counted as part of New England, having been excluded from the New England Confederation, but later joined the Dominion of New England. Thus, the definition of the Middle Colonies sometimes changed and overlapped with Rhode Island&#x27;s colonial boundaries. After joining the Dominion of New England, however, Rhode Island was permanently thought of as a New England colony. New York&#x27;s initial possession of parts of Maine ensured a close relationship with other New England colonies like Vermont and a continuing New England influence in the colony.

Both William Penn and the Lords Baltimore encouraged Irish Protestant immigration, hoping they could obtain indentured servants to work on their estates and on colonial developments. Often areas of the Middle Colonies displayed prevalent Irish cultural influence.

===Labor===
Labor was always in short supply. The most common solution was indentured servitude of young whites. These were teenagers in Britain or Germany whose parents arranged for them to work for families in the colonies until age 21, in exchange for their ocean passage. The great majority became farmers or farm wives. By the mid-eighteenth century, African American slaves comprised 12% of the population of New York. Most were house servants in Manhattan, or farm workers on Dutch estates.

===Religion===

The Middle Colonies were the religiously diverse part of the British Empire, with a high degree of tolerance. The Penn family were Quakers, and the colony became a favorite destination for that group as well as German Lutherans, German Reformed and numerous small sects such as Mennonites, Amish and Moravian, not to mention Scotch Irish Presbyterians. The Dutch Reformed were strong in upstate New York and New Jersey, and Congregationalists were important in Long Island. The First Great Awakening invigorated religiosity and helped stimulate the growth of Congregational, Methodist and Baptist churches. Non-British colonists included Dutch Calvinist, Swedish Lutherans, Palatine Mennonites, and the Amish. There was a Jewish community already established in New York from 1654 (when it was still New Amsterdam), and Jews settled in what became Pennsylvania from 1655.

<doc id="337101" wikidata="Q325956" url="?curid=337101" title="Marianne">
<text>Marianne () has been the national personification of the French Republic since the French Revolution, as a personification of liberty, equality, fraternity and reason, as well as a portrayal of the Goddess of Liberty.

Marianne is displayed in many places in France and holds a place of honour in town halls and law courts. She is depicted in the &quot;Triumph of the Republic&quot;, a bronze sculpture overlooking the Place de la Nation in Paris, as well as represented with another Parisian statue on the Place de la République. Her profile stands out on the official government logo of the country, and appears on French euro coins and on French postage stamps. She was also featured on the former franc currency and is officially used on most government documents.

Marianne is a significant republican symbol; her French monarchist equivalent is often Joan of Arc. As a national icon Marianne represents opposition to monarchy and the championship of freedom and democracy against all forms of oppression. Other national symbols of Republican France include the tricolor flag, the national motto , the national anthem &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, the coat of arms, and the official Great Seal of France. Marianne also wore a Cockade and a red Phrygian cap symbolising Liberty.

==History==
Since classical times it was common to represent ideas and abstract entities by gods, goddesses, and allegorical personifications. During the French Revolution of 1789, many allegorical personifications of &#x27;Liberty&#x27; and &#x27;Reason&#x27; appeared. These two figures finally merged into one: a female figure, shown either sitting or standing and accompanied by various attributes, including the cockade of France and the Phrygian cap. This woman typically symbolised Liberty, Reason, the Nation, the Homeland and the civic virtues of the Republic. In September 1792, the National Convention decided by decree that the new seal of the state would represent a standing woman holding a spear with a Phrygian cap held aloft on top of it.

Historian Maurice Agulhon, who in several works set out on a detailed investigation to discover the origins of Marianne, suggests that it is the traditions and mentality of the French that led to the use of a woman to represent the Republic. A feminine allegory was also a manner to symbolise the breaking with the old monarchy headed by kings and promote modern republican ideology. Even before the French Revolution, the Kingdom of France was embodied in masculine figures, as depicted in certain ceilings of Palace of Versailles. Furthermore, France and the Republic themselves are, in French, feminine nouns (&quot;la France&quot;, &quot;la République&quot;), as are the French nouns for liberty (Liberté) and reason (Raison).

The use of this emblem was initially unofficial and very diverse. A female allegory of Liberty and of the Republic makes an appearance in Eugène Delacroix&#x27;s painting &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;, painted in July 1830 in honour of the Three Glorious Days (or July Revolution of 1830).

===The First Republic===
Although the image of Marianne did not garner significant attention until 1792, the origins of this &quot;goddess of Liberty&quot; date back to 1775, when Jean-Michel Moreau painted her as a young woman dressed in Roman style clothing with a Phrygian cap atop a pike held in one hand that years later would become a national symbol across France. Marianne made her first major appearance in the French spotlight on a medal in July 1789, celebrating the storming of the Bastille and other early events of the French Revolution. From this time until September 1792, the image of Marianne was overshadowed by other figures such as Mercury and Minerva. It was not until September 1792 when the First French Republic sought a new image to represent the State that her popularity began to expand. Marianne, the female allegory of Liberty, was chosen to represent the new regime of the French Republic, while remaining to symbolise liberty at the same time.

The imagery of Marianne chosen as the seal of the First French Republic depicted her standing, young and determined. It was symbolic of the First Republic itself, a newly created state that had much to prove. Marianne is clad in a classical gown. In her right hand, she wields the pike of revolution with the Phrygian cap resting on it, which represents the liberation of France. Marianne is shown leaning on a fasces, a symbol of authority. Although she is standing and holding a pike, this depiction of Marianne is &quot;not exactly aggressive&quot;, representing the ideology of the moderate-liberal Girondins in the National Convention as they tried to move away from the &quot;frantic violence of the revolutionary days&quot;.

Although the initial figure of Marianne from 1792 stood in a relatively conservative pose, the revolutionaries were quick to abandon that figure when it no longer suited them. By 1793, the conservative figure of Marianne had been replaced by a more violent image; that of a woman, bare-breasted and fierce of visage, often leading men into battle. The reason behind this switch stems from the shifting priorities of the Republic. Although the Marianne symbol was initially neutral in tone, the shift to radical action was in response to the beginning of the Terror, which called for militant revolutionary action against foreigners and counter-revolutionaries. As part of the tactics the administration employed, the more radical Marianne was intended to rouse the French people to action. Even this change, however, was seen to be insufficiently radical by the republicans. After the arrest of the Girondin deputies in October 1793, the Convention sought to &quot;recast the Republic in a more radical mold&quot;, eventually using the symbol of Hercules to represent the Republic. The use of increasingly radical images to symbolise the Republic was in direct parallel to the beginning of the violence that came to be known as the Reign of Terror.

After the Reign of Terror, there was a need for another change in the imagery, to showcase the more civil and nonviolent nature of the Directory. In the Official Vignette of the Executive Directory, 1798, Marianne made a return, still depicted wearing the Phrygian cap, but now surrounded by different symbols. In contrast to the Marianne of 1792, this Marianne &quot;holds no pike or lance&quot;, and leans &quot;languorously&quot; on the tablet of the Constitution of Year III. Instead of looking straight at the observer, she casts her gaze towards the side, thus appearing less confrontational. Similar imagery was used in the poster of the Republic&#x27;s new calendar.

The symbol of Marianne continued to evolve in response to the needs of the State long after the Directory was dissolved in 1799 following the coup spearheaded by Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès and Napoleon Bonaparte. Whereas Mercury and Minerva and other symbolic figures diminished in prominence over the course of French history, Marianne endured because of her abstraction and impersonality. The &quot;malleability&quot; of what she symbolised allowed French political figures to continually manipulate her image to their specific purposes at any given time.

===The Second Republic===
On 17 March 1848, the Ministry of the Interior of the newly founded Second Republic launched a contest to symbolise the Republic on paintings, sculptures, medals, money and seals, as no official representations of it existed. After the fall of the monarchy, the Provisional Government had declared: &quot;The image of liberty should replace everywhere the images of corruption and shame, which have been broken in three days by the magnanimous French people.&quot; For the first time, the allegory of Marianne condensed into itself Liberty, the Republic and the Revolution.

Two &quot;Mariannes&quot; were authorised. One is fighting and victorious, recalling the Greek goddess Athena: she has a bare breast, the Phrygian cap and a red corsage, and has an arm lifted in a gesture of rebellion. The other is more conservative: she is rather quiet, wearing clothes in a style of Antiquity, with sun rays around her head—a transfer of the royal symbol to the Republic—and is accompanied by many symbols (wheat, a plough and the fasces of the Roman lictors). These two, rival Mariannes represent two ideas of the Republic, a bourgeois representation and a democratic and social representation – the June Days Uprising hadn&#x27;t yet occurred.

Town halls voluntarily chose to have representations of Marianne, often turning her back to the church. Marianne made her first appearance on a French postage stamp in 1849.

===The Second Empire===
During the Second Empire (1852–1870), this depiction became clandestine and served as a symbol of protest against the regime. The common use of the name &quot;Marianne&quot; for the depiction of &quot;Liberty&quot; started around 1848/1851, becoming generalised throughout France around 1875.

===The Third Republic===



The usage began to be more official during the Third Republic (1870–1940). Much of the popularity of Marianne was due to the fact that she symbolized French republicanism while at the same time being neutral enough to make her into a symbol that appealed to most people. The legacy of the French Revolution tended to divide people in France as different people in France had different revolutionary heroes and villains, and unlike the United States, the French had no cult of &quot;the Founding Fathers&quot; whose memory was venerated by all. For this reason, the French state tended to promote abstract symbols like Marianne as an unifying national symbol instead of using personalities from history as a national symbol in the manner which the United States used George Washington and Venezuela used Simon Bolivar as national symbols in the 19th century. As a symbol of the Revolution and of the republic, Marianne was sufficiently inoffensive enough to appeal to most people without causing any controversy. Marianne&#x27;s femininity made her appear less threatening as a symbol of the republic than a male figure would have been.

After a turbulent first decade in the 1870s, by the 1880s the republic was accepted by most people in France and as such, the French state did not need history to justify itself, using Marianne as the unifying symbol of the republic. The only historical event that was regularly honored in France was Bastille Day, as the storming of the Bastille in 1789 was the revolutionary occurrence that appealed to most of the French, and the rest of the events of the revolution were not officially honored in order to keep the memory of the revolution as harmonious as possible. It was the strategy of the republican leaders to use symbols and the memory of history in such a way to create as wide a national consensus as possible in favor of the republic, which was why Marianne became such a prominent symbol of the republic. By contrast, the newly unified German &quot;Reich&quot; had too many historical traditions to draw upon, reflecting the histories of the various German states, none of which could appeal to everybody, leading to a situation where the British historian Eric Hobsbawm noted: &quot;Like many another liberated &#x27;people&#x27;, &#x27;Germany&#x27; was more easily defined by what it was against than in any other way.&quot; Hobsbawm argued for this reason, that unlike Marianne who was a symbol of the republic and freedom in general, her German counterpart, Deutscher Michel &quot;...seems to have been essentially an anti-foreign image&quot;.

The Hôtel de Ville in Paris (city hall) displayed a statue of &quot;Marianne&quot; wearing a Phrygian cap in 1880, and was quickly followed by the other French cities. In Paris, where the Radicals had a strong presence, a contest was launched for the statue of Place de la République. It was won by the Morice brothers (with Léopold Morice producing the sculpture and the architect François-Charles Morice designing the pedestal), in 1879, with an academical Marianne, with an arm lifted towards the sky and a Phrygian cap, but with her breasts covered. Aimé-Jules Dalou lost the contest against the Morice brothers, but the City of Paris decided to build his monument on the Place de la Nation, inaugurated for the centenary of the French Revolution, in 1889, with a plaster version covered in bronze. Dalou&#x27;s Marianne had the lictor&#x27;s fasces, the Phrygian cap, a bare breast, and was accompanied by a Blacksmith representing Work, and allegories of Freedom, Justice, Education and Peace: all that the Republic was supposed to bring to its citizens. The final bronze monument was inaugurated in 1899, in the turmoil of the Dreyfus Affair, with Waldeck-Rousseau, a Radical, in power. The ceremony was accompanied by a huge demonstration of workers, with red flags. The government&#x27;s officials, wearing black redingotes, quit the ceremony. Marianne had been reappropriated by the workers, but as the representative of the Social and Democratic Republic (&quot;la République démocratique et sociale&quot;, or simply &quot;La Sociale&quot;).

From the signing of the &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot; between France and Britain in April 1904, Marianne and John Bull personalised the agreement in a number of paintings and cartoons, most famously the Punch cartoon by John Bernard Partridge. In the struggles between ideological parties around the turn of the twentieth century, Marianne was often denigrated by right-wing presses as a prostitute. In Imperial Germany, Marianne was usually portrayed in a manner that was very vulgar, usually suggesting that she was a prostitute or at any rate widely promiscuous while at the same time being a hysterically jealous and insane woman who however always cowered in fear at the sight of a German soldier. The German state in the Imperial period promoted a very xenophobic militarism, which portrayed the &quot;Reich&quot; as forever in danger from foreigners and in need of an authoritarian government. The core of Prussian-German militarism was a cult of &quot;machismo&quot; that equated militarism with masculinity, and Marianne was used in Germany to portray France as a &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; nation in contrast to &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;masculine&quot; Germany. The purpose of Marianne in German propaganda was always to promote contempt for France and with it, a warning about what Germans should not be.

The American historian Michael Nolan wrote in the &quot;hyper-masculine world of Wilhelmine Germany&quot; with its exaltation of militarism and masculine power, the very fact that Marianne was the symbol of the republic was used to argue that French men were effeminate and weak. In this regard, it is significant in German cartoons and posters, Marianne usually faced off against a male figure representing Germany, who was either a typical German soldier or Kaiser Wilhelm II himself and Marianne only very rarely took on Germania. In French cartoons and posters, it was Marianne who took on Wilhelm II, whose bombastic pomposity lent itself well for ridicule, and she almost never took on Deutscher Michel, leading Nolan to comment that French cartoonists missed a great chance for satire since even in Germany itself, Deutscher Michel is portrayed as rather &quot;dim-witted&quot;. On occasion, Marianne was portrayed slightly more favorably in Germany as in a cartoon from May 1914 in the magazine &quot;Kladderadatsch&quot; where Deutscher Michel is working in his garden with a seductive and voluptuous Marianne on one side and a brutish &quot;muzhik&quot; (Russian peasant) on the other; the message of the cartoon was that France should not be allied to Russia, and would be better off allied to Germany, since Deutscher Michel with his well tended garden is clearly a better potential husband than the vodka drinking &quot;muzhik&quot; whose garden is a disorderly disaster.

Marianne differed from Uncle Sam, John Bull, and Deutscher Michel in that Marianne was not just a symbol of France, but of the republic as well. For those on the French right, who still hankered for the House of Bourbon like &quot;Action Française&quot;, Marianne was always rejected for her republican associations, and the preferred symbol of France was Joan of Arc. As Joan of Arc was devoutly Catholic, committed to serving King Charles VII, and fought for France against England, she perfectly symbolized the values of Catholicism, royalism, militarism and nationalism that were so dear for French monarchists. Joan was apparently asexual, and her chaste and virginal image stood in marked contrast to Marianne, whom &quot;Action Française&quot; depicted as a prostitute or as a &quot;slut&quot; to symbolize the &quot;degeneracy&quot; of the republic. The contrast between the asexual Joan vs. the unabashedly sexualized Marianne who was often depicted bare-breasted could not have been greater. Finally, because of Joan&#x27;s status as one of France&#x27; best loved heroines, it was difficult for republicans to attack Joan without seeming unpatriotic. However, the royalist attempt to have Joan of Arc replace Marianne as the symbol of France failed, in large part because most of the French people accepted the republic, and Marianne unlike Joan was the symbol of the republic. In the middle of the 19th century, Marianne was usually portrayed in France as a young woman, but by late 19th century, Marianne was more commonly presented as a middle aged, maternal woman, reflecting the fact that the republic was dominated by a centre-right coalition of older male politicians, who disliked the image of a militant young female revolutionary. After British and German newspapers began to mock the middle-aged Marianne as a symbol of supposed French decline, around 1900 the younger Marianne came back into vogue to symbolize that the republic was not in decline.

In World War I, in German propaganda, Marianne was always depicted as dominating Russia, represented variously as a bear, a thuggish-looking Cossack or by the Emperor Nicholas II, with Marianne being drawn as an angry and emasculating wife. By contrast, John Bull was always depicted in German cartoons as dominating both Marianne and Russia, reflecting the German perception that Britain was the most dangerous of all of Germany&#x27;s enemies. When John Bull was depicted in the company of Marianne in German cartoons, she was always the submissive one.

Few Mariannes were depicted in the First World War memorials, but some living models of Marianne appeared in 1936, during the government of the Popular Front as they had during the Second Republic (then stigmatized by the right-wing press as &quot;unashamed prostitutes&quot;). During World War II, Marianne represented Liberty against the Nazi invaders, and the Republic against the Vichy regime (see Paul Collin&#x27;s representation). During Vichy, 120 of the 427 monuments of Marianne were melted, while the Milice took out its statues in town halls in 1943. Under Vichy, Marianne was banned and Joan of Arc became the official symbol of France. In French schools and government offices, the busts of Marianne were replaced with busts of Marshal Pétain. As Marianne was the symbol of the republic and everything it stood for, under Vichy Marianne was demonized as the most &quot;offensive&quot; symbol of the republic. There was a strong misogyny to Vichy&#x27;s attacks on Marianne under Vichy&#x27;s ideology there were two sorts of women; the &quot;virgin and the whore&quot; with Joan being cast as the former and Marianne as the latter.

===Fifth Republic===

Marianne&#x27;s presence became less important in French imagery after World War II, although under the presidency of Charles de Gaulle she was often used, in particular on stamps or for referendums. The most recent subversive and revolutionary appearance of Marianne was during the May 68 protests. The liberal and conservative president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing replaced Marianne by &quot;La Poste&quot; on stamps, changed the rhythm of the &quot;Marseillaise&quot; and suppressed the commemoration of 8 May 1945.

During the bicentenary of the Revolution, in 1989, Marianne hardly made any public appearance. The Socialist President François Mitterrand aimed to make the celebrations a consensual event, gathering all citizens, recalling more the Republic than the Revolution. The American opera singer Jessye Norman took Marianne&#x27;s place, singing &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; as part of an elaborate pageant orchestrated by avant-garde designer Jean-Paul Goude. The Republic, after harsh internal fighting throughout the 19th century and even the 20th century (6 February 1934 crisis, Vichy, etc.), had become consensual; the vast majority of French citizens were now republicans, leading to a lesser importance of a cult of Marianne.

==Origin of the name==

At the time of the French Revolution, as the most common of people were fighting for their rights, it seemed fitting to name the Republic after the most common of French women&#x27;s names: Marie (Mary) and Anne. The account made of their exploits by the Revolutionaries often contained a reference to a certain Marianne (or Marie-Anne) wearing a Phrygian cap. This pretty girl of legend inspired the revolutionaries, and looked after those wounded in the many battles across the country.

A recent discovery establishes that the first written mention of the name of Marianne to designate the Republic appeared in October 1792 in Puylaurens in the Tarn &quot;département&quot; near Toulouse. At that time people used to sing a song in the Provençal dialect of Occitan by the poet : &quot;&quot;La garisou de Marianno&quot; (French: &quot;La guérison de Marianne&quot;&quot;; &quot;Marianne&#x27;s recovery (from illness)&quot;). At the time Marie-Anne was a very popular first name; according to Agulhon, it &quot;was chosen to designate a régime that also saw itself as popular.&quot;

Some believe that the name came from the name of the Spanish Jesuit Juan de Mariana, the 16th century Monarchomach, a theoretician of tyrannicide. Others think it was the image of the wife of the politician Jean Reubell: according to an old 1797 story, Barras, one of the members of the &quot;Directoire&quot;, during an evening spent at Reubell&#x27;s, asked his hostess for her name—&quot;Marie-Anne,&quot; she replied—&quot;Perfect,&quot; Barras exclaimed, &quot;It is a short and simple name, which befits the Republic just as much as it does yourself, Madame.&quot;

The description by artist Honoré Daumier in 1848, as a mother nursing two children, Romulus and Remus, or by sculptor François Rude, during the July Monarchy, as a warrior voicing the &quot;Marseillaise&quot; on the Arc de Triomphe, are uncertain.

The name of Marianne also appears to be connected with several republican secret societies. During the Second Empire, one of them, whose members had sworn to overthrow the monarchy, had taken her name.

In any case, she has become a symbol in France: considered as a personification of the Republic, she was often used on republican iconography – and sometimes caricatured and reviled by those against the republic, especially royalists and monarchists.

==Models==
The official busts of Marianne initially had anonymous features, appearing as women of the people. From 1969, however, they began to take on the features of famous women, starting with the actress Brigitte Bardot. She was followed by Michèle Morgan (1972), Mireille Mathieu (1978), Catherine Deneuve (1985), Inès de La Fressange (1989), Laetitia Casta (2000) and Évelyne Thomas (2003).

Laetitia Casta was named the symbolic representation of France&#x27;s Republic in October 1999 in a vote open for the first time to the country&#x27;s more than 36,000 mayors. She won from a shortlist of five candidates, scoring 36% among the 15,000 that voted. The other candidates were Estelle Hallyday, Patricia Kaas, , Laëtitia Milot and . 

In July 2013, a new stamp featuring the Marianne was debuted by President François Hollande, allegedly designed by the team of Olivier Ciappa and David Kawena. Ciappa claimed that Inna Shevchenko, a high-profile member of the Ukrainian protest group FEMEN who had recently been granted political asylum in France, was a main inspiration for the new Marianne. However, Kawena and his attorney later claimed that Ciappa was falsely representing himself as having had any level of creative input on the artwork. Kawena further stated that Shevchenko, or any other figure that Ciappa claimed to be an inspiration, was in no way the model for the work, and has sued Ciappa for violation of copyright on the Marianne artwork. Ciappa later refuted the claims that Kawena was ignored, and also revealed his legal name (&quot;David Kawena&quot; being a pseudonym taken from the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; films) in a retaliatory press release; Xavier Héraud, a writer for Yagg (a French LGBT news site), noted that in a 2013 Huffington Post piece by Ciappa he never refers to Kawena and claims authorship of the images within the post. Yagg later reported on a response to their posting from Ciappa where he said that he was not in editorial control of the Huffington Post piece and did not intend to have the phrasing be &quot;My Marianne&quot; as accused by Kawena in his suit; Yagg later contacted Huffington Post who informed them that they sent a draft for Ciappa to look at prior to publishing, which is the current version of the article.

== Government logo ==

Blue-white-red, Marianne, &quot;Liberté-Égalité-Fraternité&quot;, the Republic: these national symbols represent France, as a state and its values. Since September 1999, they have been combined in a new &quot;identifier&quot; created by the Plural Left government of Lionel Jospin under the aegis of the French Government Information Service (SIG) and the public relations officials in the principal ministries. As a federating identifier of the government departments, it appears on a wide range of material—brochures, internal and external publications, publicity campaigns, letter headings, business cards, etc.—emanating from the government, starting with the various ministries (which are able to continue using their own logo in combination with this) and the &quot;préfectures&quot; and &quot;départements&quot;.

==Debate about Islamic dress==
Marianne has featured prominently in the Islamic scarf controversy in France as a symbol of a certain idea of Frenchness and femininity. The American historian Joan Wallach Scott wrote in 2016 that it is no accident that Marianne is often depicted as bare-breasted regardless of where she is or what she is doing, as this reflects the French ideal of a woman, which has been used as an argument for why Islamic dress for women is not French. Scott wrote the topless Marianne has become &quot;...the embodiment of emancipated French women in contrast to the veiled woman said to be subordinated by Islam&quot;.

Later in 2016, the French Prime Minister Manuel Valls stated in a speech that the burkini swimsuit was an &quot;enslavement&quot; of women and that Marianne was usually topless which &quot;The Economist&quot; noted: &quot;The implication seemed to be that women in burkinis are un-French, while true French women go topless.&quot; In a speech on 29 August 2016, Valls said: &quot;Marianne has a naked breast because she is feeding the people! She is not veiled, because she is free! That is the republic!&quot;. Angelique Chisafis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper reported: &quot;The inference that bare breasts were a symbol of France while the Muslim headscarf was problematic sparked scorn from politicians and derision from historians and feminists&quot;. The French president François Hollande sparked much debate in France with his controversial statement &quot;The veiled woman will be the Marianne of tomorrow&quot;.

==Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic logo==
Marianne is one of the elements of the official emblem of the 2024 Summer Olympics and the 2024 Summer Paralympics in Paris, combined with the gold medal and the Olympic and Paralympic flame, which is the first time in history with the same emblem.

<text>A biopsy is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon, an interventional radiologist, or an interventional cardiologist. The process involves the extraction of sample cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease. The tissue is then fixed, dehydrated, embedded, sectioned, stained and mounted before it is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist; it may also be analyzed chemically. When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure is called an excisional biopsy. An incisional biopsy or core biopsy samples a portion of the abnormal tissue without attempting to remove the entire lesion or tumor. When a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are removed without preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy. Biopsies are most commonly performed for insight into possible cancerous or inflammatory conditions.

==History==

The Arab physician Abulcasis (1013–1107) developed one of the earliest diagnostic biopsies. He used a needle to puncture the thyroid and then characterized many types of goiter.

===Etymology===
The term &quot;biopsy&quot; reflects the Greek words , &quot;life,&quot; and , &quot;a sight.&quot;

The French dermatologist Ernest Besnier introduced the word to the medical community in 1879.

==Medical use==

===Cancer===

When cancer is suspected, a variety of biopsy techniques can be applied. An &quot;excisional biopsy&quot; is an attempt to remove an entire lesion. When the specimen is evaluated, in addition to diagnosis, the amount of uninvolved tissue around the lesion, the &quot;surgical margin&quot; of the specimen is examined to see if the disease has spread beyond the area biopsied. &quot;Clear margins&quot; or &quot;negative margins&quot; means that no disease was found at the edges of the biopsy specimen. &quot;Positive margins&quot; means that disease was found, and a wider excision may be needed, depending on the diagnosis.

When intact removal is not indicated for a variety of reasons, a wedge of tissue may be taken in an &quot;incisional biopsy&quot;. In some cases, a sample can be collected by devices that &quot;bite&quot; a sample. A variety of sizes of needles can collect tissue in the lumen (&quot;core biopsy&quot;). Smaller diameter needles collect cells and cell clusters, fine needle aspiration biopsy.

Pathologic examination of a biopsy can determine whether a lesion is benign or malignant, and can help differentiate between different types of cancer. In contrast to a biopsy that merely samples a lesion, a larger excisional specimen called a resection may come to a pathologist, typically from a surgeon attempting to eradicate a known lesion from a patient. For example, a pathologist would examine a mastectomy specimen, even if a previous nonexcisional breast biopsy had already established the diagnosis of breast cancer. Examination of the full mastectomy specimen would confirm the exact nature of the cancer (subclassification of tumor and histologic &quot;grading&quot;) and reveal the extent of its spread (pathologic &quot;staging&quot;).

===Liquid biopsy===

There are two types of liquid biopsy (which is not really a biopsy as they are blood tests that do not require a biopsy of tissue): circulating tumor cell assays or cell-free circulating tumor DNA tests. These methods provide a non-invasive alternative to repeat invasive biopsies to monitor cancer treatment, test available drugs against the circulating tumor cells, evaluate the mutations in cancer and plan individualized treatments. In addition, because cancer is a heterogeneous genetic disease, and excisional biopsies provide only a snapshot in time of some of the rapid, dynamic genetic changes occurring in tumors, liquid biopsies provide some advantages over tissue biopsy-based genomic testing. In addition, excisional biopsies are invasive, cannot be used repeatedly, and are ineffective in understanding the dynamics of tumor progression and metastasis. By detecting, quantifying and characterisation vital circulating tumor cells or genomic alterations in CTCs and cell-free DNA in blood, liquid biopsy can provide real-time information on the stage of tumor progression, treatment effectiveness, and cancer metastasis risk. This technological development could make it possible to diagnose and manage cancer from repeated blood tests rather than from a traditional biopsy.

Circulating tumor cell tests are already available but not covered by insurance yet at maintrac and under development by many pharmaceutical companies. Those tests analyze circulating tumor cells (CTCs) Analysis of individual CTCs demonstrated a high level of heterogeneity seen at the single cell level for both protein expression and protein localization and the CTCs reflected both the primary biopsy and the changes seen in the metastatic sites.

Analysis of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (cfDNA) has an advantage over circulating tumor cells assays in that there is approximately 100 times more cell-free DNA than there is DNA in circulating tumor cells. These tests analyze fragments of tumor-cell DNA that are continuously shed by tumors into the bloodstream. Companies offering cfDNA next generation sequencing testing include Personal Genome Diagnostics and Guardant Health. These tests are moving into widespread use when a tissue biopsy has insufficient material for DNA testing or when it is not safe to do an invasive biopsy procedure, according to a recent report of results on over 15,000 advanced cancer patients sequenced with the Guardant Health test.

A 2014 study of the blood of 846 patients with 15 different types of cancer in 24 institutions was able to detect the presence of cancer DNA in the body. They found tumor DNA in the blood of more than 80 percent of patients with metastatic cancers and about 47 percent of those with localized tumors. The test does not indicate the tumor site(s) or other information about the tumor. The test did not produce false positives.

Such tests may also be useful to assess whether malignant cells remain in patients whose tumors have been surgically removed. Up to 30 percent are expected to relapse because some tumor cells remain. Initial studies identified about half the patients who later relapsed, again without false positives.

Another potential use is to track the specific DNA mutations driving a tumor. Many new cancer medications block specific molecular processes. Such tests could allow easier targeting of therapy to tumors.

===Precancerous conditions===
For easily detected and accessed sites, any suspicious lesions may be assessed. Originally, this was skin or superficial masses. X-ray, then later CT, MRI, and ultrasound along with endoscopy extended the range.

===Inflammatory conditions===

A biopsy of the temporal arteries is often performed for suspected vasculitis.
In inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis), frequent biopsies are taken to assess the activity of the disease and to assess changes that precede malignancy.

Biopsy specimens are often taken from part of a lesion when the cause of a disease is uncertain or its extent or exact character is in doubt. Vasculitis, for instance, is usually diagnosed on biopsy.
* Kidney disease: Biopsy and fluorescence microscopy are key in the diagnosis of alterations of renal function. Immunofluorescence plays vital role in the diagnosis of Crescentic glomerulonephritis.
* Infectious disease: Lymph node enlargement may be due to a variety of infectious or autoimmune diseases.
* Metabolic disease: Some conditions affect the whole body, but certain sites are selectively biopsied because they are easily accessed. Amyloidosis is a condition where degraded proteins accumulate in body tissues. To make the diagnosis, the gingival.
* Transplantation: Biopsies of transplanted organs are performed in order to determine that they are not being rejected or that the disease that necessitated the transplant has not recurred.
* Fertility: A testicular biopsy is used for evaluating the fertility of men and find out the cause of a possible infertility, e.g. when sperm quality is low, but hormone levels still are within normal ranges.

==Biopsied sites==
==Analysis of biopsied material==
After the biopsy is performed, the sample of tissue that was removed from the patient is sent to the pathology laboratory. A pathologist specializes in diagnosing diseases (such as cancer) by examining tissue under a microscope. When the laboratory (see Histology) receives the biopsy sample, the tissue is processed and an extremely thin slice of tissue is removed from the sample and attached to a glass slide. Any remaining tissue is saved for use in later studies, if required.

The slide with the tissue attached is treated with dyes that stain the tissue, which allows the individual cells in the tissue to be seen more clearly. The slide is then given to the pathologist, who examines the tissue under a microscope, looking for any abnormal findings. The pathologist then prepares a report that lists any abnormal or important findings from the biopsy. This report is sent to the surgeon who originally performed the biopsy on the patient.

<doc id="337104" wikidata="Q1566035" url="?curid=337104" title="Buddhist temples in Korea">
<text>Buddhist temples are an important part of the Korean landscape. Most Korean temples have names ending in &quot;-sa&quot; (), which means &quot;monastery&quot; in Sino-Korean.
Many temples participate in the Templestay program, where visitors can experience Buddhist culture and even stay at the temple overnight.

==Background==

A distinctive form of Buddhism evolved in Korea. This was facilitated by the geographical location and cultural conditions. Buddhism first arrived in Korea in 372 in Goguryeo. In 374 the influential Han Chinese monk Ado arrived in the kingdom and inspired King Sosurim of Goguryeo the following year. The first two temples Seongmunsa and Ilbullansa were built in 375 on the order of the king. Buddhism soon became the national religion of Goguryeo.
With the advent of Taoism in 624 the rulers began to suppress Buddhism and its importance quickly declined. The Baekje Kingdom, on the other hand, flourished under the influence of Buddhism. In 552 Buddhist scriptures were sent to Japan. This eventually led to the establishment of Buddhism in Japan.

In Silla, Buddhism was important, too. It flourished during the reign of Jinheung of Silla (540 to 576). Heungnyunsa was built, where any commoner could become a monk. The study of scriptures was greatly highlighted. For about 250 years Buddhism thrived in Later Silla.

Buddhism was admired by Wang Geon, who was enthroned as Taejo of Goryeo. Throughout the country pagodas and other Buddhist structures were built.

In late Goryeo, Buddhism became linked with corruption of the regime. A great number of monks were involved in politics. Bit by bit anti-Buddhist sentiments grew, leading to chaos which was ended by the establishment of Joseon. Taejo of Joseon himself was a devout Buddhist, but the influence of monks was reduced. At times monks were treated as outcasts, but generally there was no hindrance to their practising. Buddhist heritage can be found all over the country in the form of temples, pagodas, sculptures, paintings, handicrafts and buildings.

==Typical Layout==
A typical Korean temple consists of the following elements:
#&quot;Iljumun&quot; (일주문, 一柱門) – One pillar gate found at the entrance to temple grounds
#&quot;Sacheonwangmun&quot; (사천왕문, 四天王門), also &quot;Cheonwangmun&quot; - Gate of the Four Heavenly Kings, to mark the entrance of the temple&#x27;s boundaries
#&quot;Beopdang&quot; (법당, 法堂) – Dharma hall, used for lectures and sermons
#Monastic quarters
#&quot;Jonggo&quot; (종고, 鐘鼓) – bell tower
#&quot;Daeungjeon&quot; (대웅전, 大雄殿) – main shrine hall housing the temple&#x27;s main Buddha images
#Pagoda
#&quot;Myeongbujeon&quot; (명부전, 冥府殿) – judgment hall, housing an image of the bodhisattva Kshitigarbha (지장, 地藏) and depictions of the Buddhist hell
#&quot;Nahanjeon&quot; (나한전, 羅漢殿) – Hall of the Arhats
#&quot;Sansingak&quot; (산신각, 山神閣) – a shamanic shrine dedicated to the mountain god Sansin (산신, 山神), who can be depicted as both a male or a female. Sometimes called &quot;chilseong-gak&quot; (칠성각, 七星閣) or &quot;samseong-gak&quot; (삼성각, 三星閣), this shrine is usually found behind the main shrine hall.
#Hermitage

==North Korea==
It is reported that many temples have been taken over by the state. Once the government controls these buildings, they are used mainly as museums of ancient Korean traditions. A few temples are still in use and they are considered National Treasures. Though few temples in large cities survived the US carpet bombings of the Korean War, many still survive in rural areas, and some of the more famous, large temples destroyed have since been rebuilt (such as the Ryongtongsa and Singyesa). All in all, there are 300 temples.

==South Korea==

There are about 900 traditional Buddhist temples in South Korea, out of about 20,000 Buddhist temples in total.

==Notable temples in both Koreas==
 

The following list is sorted by Romanized names, but it also can be sorted by Korean names, by provinces (SK=South Korea, NK=North Korea), or by counties (i.e. &quot;gun&quot; or &quot;si&quot;). 
Some Korean names, and founding dates are to be completed (the founding date applies to the location, even if none of the original structures survive).
A star in the first column denotes the 31 head temples designated during the Japanese colonial period. Recommended policy: no new entries, except from temples having their own English page in Wikipedia.

<doc id="337108" wikidata="Q2603302" url="?curid=337108" title="The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat">
<text>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales is a 1985 non-fiction book by neurologist Oliver Sacks describing the case histories of some of his patients. Sacks chose the title of the book from the case study of one of his patients who has visual agnosia, a neurological condition that leaves him unable to recognize faces and objects. The book became the basis of an opera of the same name by Michael Nyman, which premiered in 1986.

The book comprises twenty-four essays split into four sections (&quot;Losses&quot;, &quot;Excesses&quot;, &quot;Transports&quot;, and &quot;The World of the Simple&quot;), each dealing with a particular aspect of brain function. The first two sections discuss deficits and excesses (with particular emphasis on the right hemisphere of the brain), while the third and fourth sections describe phenomenological manifestations with reference to spontaneous reminiscences, altered perceptions, and extraordinary qualities of mind found in people with intellectual disabilities.

In addition to describing the cases, Sacks comments on them, explains their pathophysiological background, discusses potential neuroscientific implications of such cases and occasionally makes reference to some psychological concepts, such as the soul, id, ego, and super-ego.

Sacks dedicated the book to Leonard Shengold, M.D.

== Content ==
The individual essays in this book include:

&quot;Part One:&quot;
* &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot;, about Dr. P., a singer and music teacher who has visual agnosia. He perceives separate features of objects, but cannot correctly identify them or the whole objects that they are part of. At first he supposes that diabetes has affected his vision, but an ophthalmologist suspects a neurological problem and refers him to Sacks. As he leaves Sacks&#x27; examination room during his first visit, he momentarily grabs his wife&#x27;s head, supposing it to be his hat. Unable to treat Dr. P.&#x27;s problem, Sacks encourages him to focus on his musical interests, which remain intact.
* &quot;The Lost Mariner&quot;, about Jimmie G., who has anterograde amnesia (the loss of the ability to form new memories) and retrograde amnesia (inability to access memories or information from before the disease occurred) due to atypical Korsakoff syndrome acquired after a rather heavy episode of alcoholism in 1970. He can remember nothing of his life since the end of World War II, including events that happened only a few minutes ago. Occasionally, he can recall a few fragments of his life between 1945 and 1970, such as when he sees &quot;satellite&quot; in a headline and subsequently remarks about a satellite tracking job he had that could only have occurred in the 1960s. He believes it is still 1945 (the segment covers his life in the 1970s and early 1980s), and seems to behave as a normal, intelligent young man aside from his inability to remember most of his past and the events of his day-to-day life. He struggles to find meaning, satisfaction, and happiness in the midst of constantly forgetting what he is doing from one moment to the next.
* &quot;The President&#x27;s Speech&quot;, about a ward of aphasiacs and agnosiacs listening to a speech given by an unnamed actor-president, &quot;the old charmer&quot;, presumably Ronald Reagan. Many of them laughed at the speech, while others were shocked. Sacks observes that while aphasiacs struggle with words, they can understand natural speech, because the words are paired with other expressive cues. They are acutely aware when the words and cues do not match. The agnosiacs perceived the president&#x27;s words without understanding them, and found them illogically structured, with one remarking that &quot;he does not speak good prose.&quot;
* &quot;The Disembodied Lady&quot;, a unique case of a woman losing her entire sense of proprioception (the sense of the position of parts of the body, relative to other neighboring parts of the body), due to acute polyneuropathy. Over the course of months, she learns to control her body by visual feedback alone.
* &quot;The Man Who Fell out of Bed&quot;, is about a young man whom Dr. Sacks sees as a medical student. Sacks encounters the patient on the floor of his hospital room, where he tells Sacks that he woke up to find a strange leg in his bed. Assuming that one of the nurses had played a prank on him, he attempted to toss the leg out of bed, only to find that he was attached to it. Although Sacks attempts to persuade the patient that the leg is his own, he remains bewildered in an apparent case of somatoparaphrenia.
* &quot;On the Level&quot;, another case involving damaged proprioception. Dr. Sacks interviews a patient who has trouble walking upright and discovers that he has lost his innate sense of balance due to Parkinson&#x27;s-like symptoms that have damaged his inner ears; the patient, comparing his sense of balance to a carpenter&#x27;s spirit level, suggested constructing a similar level inside a pair of glasses. This enables him to judge his balance by sight and after a few weeks, the task of keeping his eye on the level became less tiring.
* &quot;Eyes Right!&quot;, about a woman in her sixties who has hemispatial neglect. She completely forgets the idea of &quot;left&quot; relative to her own body and the world around her. When nurses place food or drink on her left side, she fails to recognize that they are there. Dr. Sacks attempts to show the patient the left side of her body using a video screen setup; when the patient sees the left side of her body, on her right, she is overwhelmed with anxiety and asks for it to stop.
&quot;Part Three:&quot;
* &quot;The Dog Beneath the Skin&quot;, concerning a 22-year-old medical student, &quot;Stephen D.&quot;, who, after a night under the influence of amphetamines, cocaine, and PCP, wakes to find he has a tremendously heightened sense of smell. Sacks would reveal many years later that he, in fact, was Stephen D.
&quot;Part Four:&quot;
* &quot;The Twins&quot;, about autistic savants. Dr. Sacks meets twin brothers who can neither read nor perform multiplication, yet are playing a &quot;game&quot; of finding very large prime numbers. While the twins were able to spontaneously generate these numbers, from six to twenty digits, Sacks had to resort to a book of prime numbers to join in with them. The twins also instantly count 111 dropped matches, simultaneously remarking that 111 is three 37s. This story has been questioned by Makoto Yamaguchi, who doubts that a book of large prime numbers could exist as described, and points out that reliable scientific reports only support approximate perception when rapidly counting large numbers of items. Autistic savant Daniel Tammet points out that the twins provided the matchbox and may have counted its contents beforehand, noting that he finds the value of 111 to be &quot;particularly beautiful and matchstick-like&quot;.
* &quot;The Autist Artist&quot;, about a 21-year-old named Jose who had been deemed &quot;hopelessly retarded&quot; and had seizures; however, when given Sacks&#x27; pocket watch and asked to draw it, he composed himself and drew the watch in surprising detail.

==In popular culture==
Christopher Rawlence wrote the libretto for a chamber opera—directed by Michael Morris with music by Michael Nyman—based on the title story. &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot; was first produced by the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1986. A television version of the opera was subsequently broadcast in the UK.

Peter Brook adapted Sacks&#x27;s book into an acclaimed theatrical production, &quot;L&#x27;Homme Qui...&quot;, which premiered at the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, Paris, in 1993. An Indian theatre company performed a play entitled &quot;The Blue Mug&quot;, based on the book, starring Rajat Kapoor, Konkona Sen Sharma, Ranvir Shorey, and Vinay Pathak.

&quot;The Man Who&quot;, an album by the Scottish indie pop band Travis, is named after this book.

<doc id="337115" wikidata="Q1195567" url="?curid=337115" title="Korean Confucianism">
<text>Korean Confucianism is the form of Confucianism that emerged and developed in Korea. One of the most substantial influences in Korean intellectual history was the introduction of Confucian thought as part of the cultural influence from China.

Today the legacy of Confucianism remains a fundamental part of Korean society, shaping the moral system, the way of life, social relations between old and young, high culture, and is the basis for much of the legal system. Confucianism in Korea is sometimes considered a pragmatic way of holding a nation together without the civil wars and internal dissent that were inherited from the Goryeo dynasty.

==Origins of Confucian thought==
Confucius (孔夫子 &quot;Kǒng Fūzǐ&quot;, lit. &quot;Master Kong&quot;) is generally thought to have been born in 551 BC and raised by his mother following the death of his father when Confucius was three years old. The Latinized name &quot;Confucius&quot; by which most Westerners recognize him is derived from &quot;Kong Fuzi&quot;, probably first coined by 16th-century Jesuit missionaries to China. The Analects, or &quot;Lunyu&quot; (論語; lit.&quot;Selected Sayings&quot;), a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher and his contemporaries, is believed to have been written by Confucius&#x27; followers during the Warring States period (475–221 BC), achieving its final form during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). Confucius was born into the class of &quot;shi&quot; (士), between the aristocracy and the common people. His public life included marriage at the age of 19 that produced a son and a variety of occupations as a farm worker, clerk and book-keeper. In his private life he studied and reflected on righteousness, proper conduct and the nature of government such that by the age of 50 he had established a reputation. This regard, however was insufficient for his success in advocating for a strong central government and the use of diplomacy over warfare as the ideal for international relationships. He is said to have spent his last years teaching an ardent group of followers of the values to be appreciated in a collection of ancient writings loosely identified as the Five Classics. Confucius is thought to have died in 479 BC at 71–72 years of age.

Under the succeeding Han dynasty and Tang dynasty, Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence. During the Song dynasty, the scholar Zhu Xi (AD 1130–1200) added ideas from Taoism and Buddhism into Confucianism. In his life Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but not long after his death his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant. Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different, and call his way of thinking Neo-Confucianism. Neo-Confucianism held sway in China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam until the 19th century.

==Early developments towards Confucianism in Korea==

===Before Goryeo===

Confucianism can first be traced to the splitting of Korea into separate states, after which the development of the Korean writing system marked the period in which Confucianism began to be studied and endorsed by the higher classes. Additionally, artifacts that depict Confucian ideals, such as the famous &quot;Painted Basket&quot; and a roof tile imprinted with a Confucian institution&#x27;s symbols, have been found in the Lelang Commandery (located in the modern day city of Pyongyang). These artifacts reflect the influence of Han Chinese and the prevalence of Confucianism among foreigners in Korea, rather than Koreans themselves.

As the Three Kingdoms Period emerged from the Four Commanderies, each Kingdom sought ideologies under which their populations could be consolidated and authority could be validated. From its introduction to the kingdom of Baekje in 338 AD, Korean Buddhism spread rapidly to all of the states of the Three Kingdoms Period. Though Korean Shamanism had been an integral part of Korean culture extending back to earliest time, Buddhism was able to strike a balance between the people and their administration by arbitrating the responsibilities of one to the other.

===Goryeo period===

By the time of the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392) the position, influence, and status of Buddhism far exceeded its role as a mere religious faith. Buddhist temples, originally established as acts of faith had grown into influential landholdings replete with extensive infra-structure, cadre, tenants, slaves and commercial ventures. The state observed a number of Buddhist holidays during the year where the prosperity and security of the nation were inextricably tied to practices and rites that often mixed Buddhist and indigenous Korean beliefs. As in China, Buddhism divided into the more urban faith rooted religious texts and the more contemplative faith of the rural areas. This emphasis on texts and learning produced a &quot;monk examination&quot; wherein the Buddhist clergy could vie with Confucian scholars for positions in the local and national government. During this time, Confucian thought remained in the shadow of its Buddhist rival, vying for the hearts and minds of Korean culture, but with growing antagonism.

With the fall of Goryeo, the position of the landed aristocracy crumbled to be replaced by the growing power of the Korean illiterati who advocated strenuously for land reform. Interest in Chinese literature during the Goryeo Dynasty had encouraged the spread of Neo-Confucianism, in which the older teachings of Confucius had been melded to Taoism and Buddhism. Neo-Confucian adherents could now offer the new Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910) an alternative to the influence of Buddhism. In Goryeo, King Gwangjong (949–975) had created the national civil service examinations, and King Seongjong (1083–1094) was a key advocate for Confucianism by establishing the Gukjagam, the highest educational institution of the Goryeo dynasty. This was enhanced, in 1398, by the Sunggyungwan – an academy with a Neo-Confucian curriculum – and the building of an altar at the palace, where the king would worship his ancestors. Neo-Confucian thought, with its emphasis on Ethics and the government&#x27;s moral authority provided considerable rationale for land reform and redistribution of wealth. Rather than attack Buddhism outright, Neo-Confucian critics simply continued to criticize the system of Temples and the excesses of the clergy.

==Neo-Confucianism in the Joseon dynasty==

By the time of King Sejong (ruled 1418–1450), all branches of learning were rooted in Confucian thought. Korean Confucian schools were firmly established, most with foreign educated scholars, large libraries, patronage of artisans and artists, and a curriculum of 13 to 15 major Confucian works. Branches of Buddhism in Korea were still tolerated outside of the major political centers. In Ming China (1368–1644), Neo-Confucianism had been adopted as the state ideology. The new Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910) followed suit and also adopted Neo-Confucianism as the primary belief system among scholars and administrators. Jo Gwangjo&#x27;s efforts to promulgate Neo-Confucianism among the populace had been followed by the rise of Korea&#x27;s two most prominent Confucian scholars, Yi Hwang (1501–1570) and Yi I (1536–1584), who are often referred to by their pen names &quot;Toe gye&quot; and &quot;Yul gok&quot;. Korean Neo-Confucianist organizations typically did not believe in a god or gods, an afterlife, or an eternal soul.

Having supplanted all other models for the Korean nation-state, by the start of the 17th century, Neo-Confucian thought experienced first a split between Westerners and Easterners and again, between Southerners and Northerners. Central to these divisions was the question of succession in the Korean monarchy and the manner in which opposing factions should be dealt.

A growing number of Neo-Confucian scholars had also begun to question particular metaphysical beliefs and practices. A movement known as Silhak (lit. &quot;practical learning&quot;) posited that Neo-Confucian thought ought be founded more in reform than in maintaining the status quo. Differences among various Confucian and Neo-Confucian schools of thought grew to conflicts as Western countries sought to force open Korean, Chinese and Japanese societies to Western trade, Western technologies and Western institutions. Of particular concern were the growing number of Catholic and Protestant missionary schools which not only taught a Western pedagogy but also Christian religious beliefs. In 1894, Korean Conservatives, nationalists and Neo-Confucians rebelled at what they viewed as the loss of Korean Society and Culture to alien influences by the abandonment of the Chinese classics and Confucian rites.

The Donghak Rebellion—also called the 1894 Peasant War (Nongmin Jeonjaeng)—expanded on the actions of the small groups of the Donghak (lit. Eastern Learning) movement begun in 1892. Uniting into a single peasant guerrilla army (Donghak Peasant Army) the rebels armed themselves, raided government offices and killed rich landlords, traders and foreigners. The defeat of the Dong Hak rebels drove ardent Neo-Confucians out of the cities and into the rural and isolated areas of the country. However, the rebellion had pulled China into the conflict and in direct contention with Japan (First Sino-Japanese War). With the subsequent defeat of Qing China, Korea was wrested from Chinese influence concerning its administration and development. In 1904, the Japanese defeated Russia (Russo-Japanese War) ending Russian influence in Korea as well. As a result, Japan annexed Korea as a protectorate in 1910, ending the Joseon kingdom and producing a thirty-year occupation (Korea under Japanese rule) which sought to substitute Japanese culture for that of Korea. During this period, a Japanese administration imposed Japanese language, Japanese education, Japanese practices and even Japanese surnames on the Korean population predominantly in the large cities and surrounding suburban areas. Though, in the isolated areas of Korea, and well into Manchuria, Korean nationals continued to wage a guerrilla war against the Japanese and found sympathy for Neo-Confucian goals of reform and economic parity among the growing Communist movement. With the end of the Japanese occupation, Confucian and Neo-Confucian thought continued to experience neglect if not willful repression during the Korean War as well as the repressive dictatorships which followed.

However, secret Confucian practice and organization still took place, and later took form as the &quot;Union of Confucian Associations&quot; in 1945–shortly after the Japanese influence was gone. The organization was founded with the goal to eradicate and prevent further colonialist influence, and also update the once &quot;Myeongnyun Institute&quot; into the larger &quot;Seong Gyun-gwan College.&quot; The update was funded by the offerings given to the &quot;hyanggyo&quot; shrines, but fundings for the &quot;Union of Confucian Associations&quot;–later transformed into a new Confucian Association, or &quot;Yohoe&quot;, the following March–came from either membership dues or income from the land of the &quot;hyanggyo&quot;. All the collected money was then to be split 30/20/50; 30% was to go to the local chapter, 20% to the provincial chapter, and then 50% to the Association. Unfortunately, after the ravaging of factionalism and struggle swept throughout the country after 1945, many local chapters refused to contribute, which further fueled the battle in maintaining Confucianism with the Association. As it was, there was an estimate of 150,000 members in the Association of South Korea&#x27;s then population of 26 million. In comparison, Buddhism had over 5,000 monks and roughly 3,500,000 people that actively practiced the religion within South Korea alone.

After the land reform by the Rhee government in 1949, the Association began losing another significant amount of money as the land previously owned by the &quot;hyanggyo&quot; began to dwindle. The once vast land amounts that the &quot;hyanggyo&quot; owned in the Yi dynasty were forced to be ceded to the government for farmland distribution, or given up for education establishments. Slowly, the local chapters no longer had as much income to fund the upkeep for the &quot;hyanggyo&quot; shrines or the activities that occurred throughout the Association.

But the Association was also struggling with the problem their rapidly aging followers posed. With the decline in popularity, according to a questionnaire conducted in 1963, the average Confucian followers per local chapter were in their forties. In contrast, the average age of the local chairmen was 63, and there were very few followers in their thirties or twenties. In conjunction, a misconception was arising in Soul at the time that only aristocratic &quot;yangban&quot; families were able to join and follow Confucianism. This was presumably due to the two local chapters–located on remote Korean islands–that had established that only descendents of Confucius were able to join. This was quickly diffused, however, as it contradicts Confucius&#x27; own outlook on the hereditary ruling class.

==Contemporary society and Confucianism==

With the fall of the Joseon Dynasty in 1910, Neo-Confucianism lost much of its influence. In contemporary South Korea, very few people identify themselves as being Confucian when asked for their religious affiliation. The statistical studies done on this subject can be misleading, however. Confucianism is not an organized religion, making it hard to easily define a person as Confucian or not. Though its prominence as the dominant ideology has faded, there are a lot of Confucian ideas and practices that still saturate South Korean culture and daily life.

The traditional Confucian respect for education remains a vital part of South Korean culture. The civil service examinations were the gateway to prestige and power for a follower of Confucianism in the Joseon Dynasty. Today, exams continue to be an important aspect of South Korean life. The content of what is studied has changed over the years. Confucian teachings were replaced by other topics, such as foreign languages, modern history, economics, science, and mathematics. Like Confucianism from the past, a lot of emphasis is placed on the ability to study and memorize. Since exams are so important for gaining admission to better schools and jobs, a typical student&#x27;s entire life is oriented toward preparing to pass the necessary exams.

Perhaps some of the strongest evidences of continuing Confucian influence can be found in South Korean family life. It is seen not just in South Korea&#x27;s emphasis on family and group-oriented ways of living, but also in the Confucian rituals that are still commonly performed today, the ancestor memorial services. It is a way of showing respect for deceased parents, grandparents, and ancestors, and is a way of showing Confucian filial piety. In some cases, the memorial services have been changed to fit with religious views. This is an example of how Confucianism has melded with religion in South Korea, rather than competing against it.

In 1980, the &quot;Guideline for Family Rituals&quot; was made law. It declared that ancestral ceremonies can only be held for one&#x27;s parents and grandparents, simplified the funeral ceremonies, and reduced the allowed mourning period. The law is not strictly enforced, and no one has been charged for violating it.

In more recent years, there has been a move away from the traditional Confucian idea of complete respect for and submission to parental authority. It can be seen in how marriage has become less of a family decision, and more of an individual&#x27;s choice.

The Confucian emphasis on the importance of the family and the group over the individual has been extended to South Korean business, as well. Employees are expected to regard the workplace as a family, with the head of the company as the patriarch who enjoys exclusive privileges while the workers are expected to work harder. The businesses tend to operate on Confucian ethics, such as the importance of harmonious relations among the employees and loyalty to the company. Importance is placed on attributes such as differences in age, kinship status, sex, and sociopolitical status.

Confucian ethical rhetoric is still used in contemporary South Korea. Other religions will incorporate it into discussions on proper human behavior. It can be found in the government and in the business world being used to encourage people to put the needs of the group above their own individual needs.

Neo-Confucian philosophy going back to the 15th Century had relegated Korean women to little more than extensions of male dominance and producers of requisite progeny. This traditional view of the social role of women is fading away. There is an increasing number of women students holding good positions in universities and the work force, as well as in politics.
The arts still maintain major traditions: Korean Pottery, the Korean Tea Ceremony, Korean Gardens, and Korean flower arrangement follow Confucian principles and a Confucian aesthetic. Scholarly calligraphy and poetry also continue, in much fewer numbers, this heritage. In films, school stories of manners and comic situations within educational frames fit well into the satires on Confucianism from earlier writings. Loyalty to school and devotion to teachers is still an important genre in popular comedies.

With Neo-Confucianism taken out of the school curricula and removed from its prominence in the daily life of Koreans, the sense that something essential to Korean history is missing led to a rebirth of Confucianism in South Korea in the late 1990s.

In 2006, roughly 1.2% of the South Korean population were Confucian.

It is difficult to find accurate information regarding Confucianism in North Korean religion or practices. However, the Juche ideology does encourage the Confucian virtues of loyalty, reverence, and obedience.

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===

Traditionally women in Korea were given the role of housewife due to Confucian gender roles. Meaning women were not allowed to work outside the house. This started to change and by 2001 the women&#x27;s participation in the workforce was at 49.7 percent compared to only 34.4 percent in the 1960s. In 1987 equal opportunity legislation was introduced and been improved by reforms since then to improve the rights of working women. As Korean feminist organizations gained more influence the government listened, and in 2000 established the Department of Gender Equality to allow women to participate in making policy. Even though women are gaining by working right, it has not fully changed the roles when at the house. Working women are still expected to be the primary domestic worker in the family. However, these changes have given women in south Korea more of an option between being a housewife or working outside of the house.

The women who have chosen to work due to the changes in government and legislation had and still have major challenges to face in the workforce. Major companies in South Korea began to change their hiring practices such as Samsung which was one of the first major companies to do so. In 1997 Samsung removed gender discrimination in recruitment and by 2012 had hired 56,000 women employees. However, before 1997 some women did manage to work at Samsung, and there was discrimination in the patriarchally-ran company. Most of the jobs of the woman who worked at Samsung were low-level workers. When the company tried to offer higher positions to women, many of the top male executives took advantage of the women and gave them menial chores, not unlike how some husbands may expect of their wives at home. However, this all began to change in 1994 when an open personnel reform from Samsung&#x27;s chairman, forced top executives to treat and pay men and women equally. Samsung&#x27;s newest goal is increasing the percentage of female top executives from 2 percent to 10 percent by 2020. Still today however in South Korea, women are being discriminated against especially in work environments.

==Korean Confucian art==

Korean Confucian art and philosophy had great and deep effects on the Korean culture.

Confucianism has also inspired experimental art collective in 1960s–70s Korea, such as The Fourth Group.

<text>Robert Rowe Gilruth (October 8, 1913 – August 17, 2000) was an American aerospace engineer and an aviation/space pioneer who was the first director of NASA&#x27;s Manned Spacecraft Center, later renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.

He worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) from 1937 to 1958 and its successor NASA, until his retirement in 1973. He was involved with early research into supersonic flight and rocket-powered aircraft, and then with the United States human spaceflight program, including the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gilruth was born October 8, 1913, in Nashwauk, Minnesota, and moved to Duluth when he was nine years old. He graduated in 1931 from Duluth Central High School. As a teenager, Gilruth was fascinated by aeronautics and spent time building model airplanes. He was inspired to pursue a career in the field after reading about NASA&#x27;s Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in Virginia. Gilruth received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Minnesota in 1935, and received his Master of Science degree in 1936. While there he was a member of the Professional Engineering Fraternity Theta Tau, of which he was later inducted as a Hall of Fame Alumnus.

===Flight test career===

In January 1937 Gilruth was hired at NACA&#x27;s Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, where he performed flight research. His research led to the NACA Report R755, &quot;Requirements for Satisfactory Flying Qualities of an Airplane&quot;, published in 1941, in which he defined a set of requirements for the handling characteristics of an aircraft. Until this point, no set of guidelines for pilots and aircraft designers existed.

Gilruth also pioneered the recording of data from instruments during flight test, to be later correlated with the pilot&#x27;s experience. This would go on to become the standard operating procedure.

=== NASA career ===
Gilruth had been working on hypersonic missile rockets as the assistant director of the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division of NACA. He and his team pushed their superiors to pursue a program to launch satellites into space, but he was rebuffed by administrators. The dynamic quickly changed after the Soviets succeeded in launching Sputnik, and Gilruth became involved in the transition of NACA into NASA.

When NASA was created, Gilruth became head of the Space Task Group, tasked with putting a man in space before the Soviet Union.

In 1961, when President John F. Kennedy announced that America would put a man on the Moon before the end of the decade (the 1960s) and bring him back safely to Earth, Gilruth was &quot;aghast&quot; and unsure that such a goal could be accomplished. He was integral to the creation of the Gemini program, which he advocated as a means for NASA to learn more about operating in space before attempting a lunar landing.

In 1962, he was awarded the President&#x27;s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service by President John F. Kennedy.

Soon the Apollo program was born, and Gilruth was made head of the NASA center which ran it, the new Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) (now the Johnson Space Center). Gilruth was inducted into the National Space Hall of Fame in 1969 and served as director of the MSC until his retirement in 1972. He was inducted as a member of the inaugural class to the International Space Hall of Fame in 1976. He oversaw a total of 25 crewed space flights, from Mercury-Redstone 3 to Apollo 15.

In 1971, Gilruth, along with the Apollo 15 crew, was awarded the Collier Trophy.

In 1992, Gilruth was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum, in 1994, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame and in 2015, the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame as a posthumous induction.

===Death===
In 2000, Gilruth died in Charlottesville, Virginia, at the age of 86.

<text>Kaminaljuyu (pronounced ; from Kʼicheʼʼ, &quot;The Hill of the Dead&quot;) is a Pre-Columbian site of the Maya civilization located in Guatemala City. Primarily occupied from 1500 BC to 1200 AD, it has been described as one of the greatest archaeological sites in the New Worldalthough the extant remains are distinctly unimpressive. Debate continues about its size, integration, and role in the surrounding Valley of Guatemala and the Southern Maya area. 

Kaminaljuyu, when first mapped scientifically, comprised some 200 platforms and pyramidal mounds. The site was largely swallowed up by real estate developments. A portion of the Classic Period center is preserved as a 0.5 square km parka fraction of the original ruins field size of around 5 square km. 

==Archaeological excavations==
The extant remains are distinctly unimpressive and are in a state of destruction with almost daily erasure of material. This is due to their location beneath urbanization and because they were constructed of hardened adobe, weaker than the limestone used to build in the Maya Lowlands. 

Over the past 100 years, more than fifty archaeological projects, large and small, have been mounted at Kaminaljuyu. In addition to excavations, scholars such as Alfred Maudslay and Samuel K. Lothrop have recorded sculptures and made maps of the site. In 1925 Manuel Gamio undertook limited excavations, finding deep cultural deposits yielding potsherds and clay figurines from what later was called the &quot;Middle Cultures&quot; of Mesoamerica (from 1500 BC to 150 AD). A decade later, the importance of the site was confirmed when a local football club began cutting away the edges of two inconspicuous mounds to lengthen their practice field, discovering an impressive buried structure. Lic. J. Antonio Villacorta C., the Minister of Public Education in Guatemala City, requested archaeologists Alfred Kidder, Jesse Jennings and Edwin Shook to investigate. Villacorta gave the site its name from a Kʼicheʼ word meaning &quot;mounds of the ancestors.&quot; 

When first mapped scientifically by E. M. Shook over a period of decades from the 1930s on, at least half of which were from before the end of the Preclassic period (250 AD). Kidder, Jennings, and Shook&#x27;s monograph, published by the Carnegie Institution of Washington – one of the most important archaeological research entities in the history of Maya scholarship – brought excited attention by scholars to the significance of the SMA. This excitement turned to consensus about the priority of high social and cultural developments in the South when Shook and Kidder published their report on Mound E-III-3, a &quot;Miraflores&quot; mound and the largest known thus far from the site, and which contained seven structures built onion-skin fashion over and around each other through time. Two extraordinarily rich royal tombs were found within the edifices, probably representing consecutive rulers during the &quot;Miraflores&quot; Preclassic apogee of Kaminaljuyu.

In the early 1950s Heinrich Berlin excavated a large mound in the ancient Preclassic core of the city. In the 1960s Pennsylvania State University undertook extensive excavations at Kaminaljuyu, under the direction of William T. Sanders and Joseph W. Michels. The processualist and unilineal cultural evolutionary theoretical orientation of the Penn State project were in sharp contrast to the Carnegie work before and to the historical, cultural-historical, sometimes epigraphy- and art-historically driven paradigm of Lowland Maya research after. In the 1990s, Marion Popenoe de Hatch and Juan Antonio Valdés conducted excavations in the southern districts of the site, and a Japanese team investigated a large mound near the modern archaeological park.

Emphases since the 1970s on Classic Maya hieroglyphic texts and discoveries of great sites in the northern Petén turned attention away from the SMA, and a long period ensued during which proponents of a Maya Lowlands origins for Maya civilization held sway. More recently, the debate was rejoined with discoveries along the southern Pacific coast of Mexico and in Guatemala that greatly antedate developments in the Lowlands.

==Occupation history==
The known parts of Kaminaljuyu lie on a broad plain beneath roughly the western third of modern Guatemala City. Soils are rich because of frequent volcanic eruptions; volcanic ash in the form of hardened tuff reaches depths of several hundred meters in and around Kaminaljuyu, and deep clefts or &quot;barrancos&quot; mark the landscape.

There are many mysteries, in addition to size and scale, that likely will remain unanswered about Kaminaljuyu. These questions are mainly about the role of the city as the greatest of the Southern Maya area (SMA) in Preclassic times, particularly during the Miraflores period, c. 400–100 BC. The SMA is long believed to have been seminal in the development of Maya civilization.

===Arévalo and Las Charcas cultures===

Kidder, Jennings, and Shook referred to Kaminaljuyu&#x27;s artifacts as representative of what they called a &quot;Middle Culture&quot; which they believed represented the earliest phase of complex social and cultural development in Mesoamerica. This reflected their conclusion about the great antiquity of developments at Kaminaljuyu and their belief that Kaminaljuyu was primordial for its cultural and social innovations. Since their work, investigations chiefly undertaken by scholars from the New World Archaeological Foundation on the southern Pacific coast of Mexico have greatly altered this view, deepening in time the incipience of complex social and cultural events in Mesoamerica. Cultures of this phase had a stable agricultural community organized probably as a simple chiefdom.

Over many years Shook and Kidder developed the Kaminaljuyu ceramic sequence, and it remains, with refinements by Shook and Marion Popenoe de Hatch, one of the most secure and reliable ceramic chronologies in Mesoamerica, although some doubts remain about the absolute dates due to a paucity of radiocarbon anchors (a revision by Inomata, et al. to the following chronology, based on Bayesian analysis, would push forward the ceramic phases by as much as 300 years, setting the Miraflores apogee to a 100 BC – AD 100 time frame). With Inomata, et al&#x27;s revision in mind, the first significant settlement dates to the Arévalo phase, c. 900–800 BC, with indications of dense populations no later than c. 400 BC. By the end of the Las Charcas culture (800–350 BC), Kaminaljuyu was developing &quot;religious and civic institutions.&quot; Scattered Las Charcas remains throughout the Valley of Guatemala mark a major occupation of the area at sites such as El Naranjo; at this latter site, as well as at El Portón some 50 kilometers to the north and Takalik Abaj, about 130 kilometers to the west in the lower piedmont, plain uncarved upright shaft stones called stelae, mark the first appearance of a cult of time-reckoning and which became one of the bases for the institution of Maya kingship. The architecture of Middle Preclassic structures consisted of hardened adobe bricks that served, later, as foundations for raised platforms and pyramidal temples.

Excavations indicate that from early in the Middle Preclassic the community was large enough to produce heavy refuse deposits. Cotton was grown as well as maize; palaeobotanical research also has identified annonas, avocados, cacao, black beans, palm nuts, plums, and sapodilla (&quot;zapote blanco&quot;). Arboriculture developed – with groves of crop trees grown in terraces down to the edges of great ravines. Specialists practiced loom-weaving and were expert potters. Large-scale workshops for obsidian tool-making were spread around the ancient city. Religious practices that would later be further developed throughout Mesoamerica were elaborating during the early Middle Preclassic at Kaminaljuyu, including the erection of mounds to serve as substructures for small shrines or funerary/administrative temples, the development of a complex pantheon of deities – probably based on some primordial mythology and cosmology of which the Popol Vuh represents a fragment – and euhemerism, an &quot;incensario&quot; and stela cult, and warfare to procure captives for royal sacrifice.

Many of the artifacts from Las Charcas not associated with burials were found in pits. There were principally two types of pits: shallow bowl-like pits and bottle-shaped pits. The shallow pits were possibly used for digging clay to be used in building and later to hold refuse. Carbonized avocado seeds, maize cobs and remnants of textiles, basketry, mats and rope fragments have been found in those that are bottle-shaped. It is thought these pits were used for cooking, storage and refuse containers.

Hand-modeled clay female figurines are also highly characteristic of Las Charcas culture. Those found at Kaminaljuyu are generally of reddish-brown clay and some have a white slip. The female figurines often depict pregnancy and are thought to have been offerings to promote fertility in the fields. Usually, the arms and legs of the figures are mere stumps but some attempt at a realistic body shape has been made. The head has received the most attention to detail. The nose was pinched into the relief and nostrils were made by punctuating the clay. The eyes and the mouth were formed by strategically applied lumps. The figurines often have earplug flares.

===The &quot;Miraflores&quot;===
The apogee of Preclassic developments at Kaminaljuyu occurred during what scholars refer to as the &quot;Miraflores&quot; period – once a name for a Late Preclassic ceramic phase, now split into two, the Verbena and Arenal. Preclassic remains, particularly from this epoch, are extremely abundant at Kaminaljuyu; Shook and Kidder noted that in Mound E-III-3 &quot;...an average of...200 sherds per cubic meter [were found...the mound] in its final stage [having] a volume of some 75,000 cu. m [yielding] the astounding total of approximately 15,000,000 fragments...[A]llowing 30 sherds to represent one vessel – a high average considering the abundance of small pre-Classic bowls...at least 500,000 complete vessels had been used, broken, and their fragments incidentally incorporated in the fill of this one mound.&quot; What Kidder, Jennings, and Shook referred to as the Middle Cultures are now understood as the Middle Preclassic period, which lasted from 1000 to 400 BC, and the Late Preclassic period, dating from 400 BC to 250 AD.

In its &quot;Miraflores&quot; heyday, enormously eclectic sculptures were placed around the city, in plazas, and in front of platforms and temples. Brightly colored murals and giant masks adorned the sides of edifices. Monuments included effigies of toads, bats, owls, jaguars, and serpents; particularly important was the Principal Bird Deity, a symbol of celestial power often invoked in the iconography of kingship. Early versions of other Classic Maya deities were depicted, including the maize god, the Hero Twins, and a merchant god. The sculptural eclecticism is another indication of the Preclassic cosmopolitan and &quot;international&quot; character of Kaminaljuyu, the role of &quot;port-of-trade&quot; or &quot;gateway&quot; capital continuing through Classic times despite a major change of cultural traditions and, possibly, ethnic affiliation at the end of the Preclassic.

====Sacred Kingship====
Enormous thrones and stelae attest to the might and splendor of &quot;Miraflores&quot; Kaminaljuyu. Stela 10, a fragment of a gigantic throne, is carved with a decapitation narrative scene showing a ruler masked and attired to impersonate an underworld jaguar deity wielding a flint axe over what likely was a kneeling captive; the head of a jaguar deity floats to the right of the ruler/protagonist, invoked by the burning of blood in a sacrificial plate. The similarly gigantic Monument 65 is carved, on the front, with three seated, throned rulers, each one framed by two bound, kneeling, nude captives, each ruler and his paired victims vertically positioned within a lower, a central, and an upper register. Almost annually, fragments of once very large sculptural monuments are found in Guatemala City often during unregulated municipal demolition and construction. Many monuments were carved with Preclassic hieroglyphic texts (Kaplan 2011), underscoring the fact that, as Coe observes, &quot;the elite of [Kaminaljuyu] were fully literate at a time when other Maya were perhaps just learning that writing existed.&quot;

====Hydraulics====
In the last twenty years, archaeologists have studied sophisticated water control systems in the southern precincts of &quot;Miraflores&quot; Kaminaljuyu, indicating an extensive bureaucracy and concomitant social hierarchy must have been in place to supervise and maintain the hydraulics. These systems date to the &quot;Miraflores&quot; and endured through to the end of the Preclassic.

===Esperanza cultures and a Teotihuacán Intrusion?===

Two major mounds excavated by Kidder, Jennings, and Shook contained tombs probably representing rulers from the Esperanza period.

In Mound A the tomb is associated with a pit burial. All that remains in the pit burial of its original fill are worn igneous rocks, quantities of coarse sherds and human skull parts that had been cut through by the digging of the tomb. The tomb contains the remains of eight people. One corpse received special treatment, as evinced by the considerable amount of jewelry and the offerings left with it. The bodies were borne into the tomb on fabric mats or animal hides of which only traces remain. Among the objects found as offerings in the tomb were jade beads around the necks of two of the corpses, wafer-like disc shells forming a choker on one skeleton, jade earplug flares, an unusually large number of shells, a fine obsidian blade, a tortoise shell, metates, and various fine pottery pieces including a whistling jar and a carved tripod vessel. Several coarse brown ware vessels heaped against the wall of the tomb probably originally contained food prepared for the after-life journey of the dead.

The Esperanza tombs of Mounds A and B are notable because of the interment within them of elite-use ceramic vessels in unmistakable Teotihuacán style. Teotihuacán was the greatest ancient city in Mesoamerica, with far-flung hegemonic reach from its location in Central Mexico. During the Early Classic period in the Maya world, art and artifacts, as well as hieroglyphics, attest to specific intrusions by and influences from Teotihuacán at great Lowland cities such as Tikal, Piedras Negras, and Copán, although the exact nature of this presence remains controversial. Teotihuacán, like the later Aztec empire, was drawn to the Southern area undoubtedly because of its rich resources of obsidian and cacao.

Dating to Esperanza times and later in the Classic period, twelve ballcourts have been found, possibly indicating an emphasis on the resolution of conflicts through ritual game-playing rather than war, which would underscore Kaminaljuyu&#x27;s role as a nexus and intermediary between powerful foreign entities and as a religious &quot;pilgrimage&quot; site.

==Economics==
Enormous obsidian beds lying 20 km northeast of Guatemala City and known as &quot;El Chayal&quot; (Kakchikel Maya for &quot;obsidian&quot;) are long presumed to have been the most important material basis for Kaminaljuyu&#x27;s ascendance as the greatest polity in the SMA as well as its continuation as the preeminent city in the Southern Maya Area during the Classic period. Distinctively black in color, obsidian from the Chayal beds found at sites throughout the Lowlands as well as the Southern Maya Area supports this assumption, although the specifics of control, whether formally under Kaminaljuyu&#x27;s hegemony or more informally representing a vital material resource whose wealth accrued to the city more or less in direct relation to proximity, remain in the realm of speculation.

In addition to Chayal obsidian, the strategic location of Kaminaljuyu as a nexus for trade between the Pacific coast and piedmont and the Maya Lowlands – salt, fish, and shells from the coast, cacao and other agricultural products from the piedmont, jaguar skins, feathers, and other commodities from the Lowland jungles – underlay Kaminaljuyu&#x27;s wealth and influence throughout the Maya world.

<doc id="337140" wikidata="Q1546173" url="?curid=337140" title="Capture of Fort Ticonderoga">
<text>The capture of Fort Ticonderoga occurred during the American Revolutionary War on May 10, 1775, when a small force of Green Mountain Boys led by Ethan Allen and Colonel Benedict Arnold surprised and captured the fort&#x27;s small British garrison. The cannons and other armaments at Fort Ticonderoga were later transported to Boston by Colonel Henry Knox in the noble train of artillery and used to fortify Dorchester Heights and break the standoff at the siege of Boston.

Capture of the fort marked the beginning of offensive action taken by the Americans against the British. After seizing Ticonderoga, a small detachment captured the nearby Fort Crown Point on May 11. Seven days later, Arnold and 50 men raided Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River in southern Quebec, seizing military supplies, cannons, and the largest military vessel on Lake Champlain.

Although the scope of this military action was relatively minor, it had significant strategic importance. It impeded communication between northern and southern units of the British Army, and gave the nascent Continental Army a staging ground for the invasion of Quebec later in 1775. It also involved two larger-than-life personalities in Allen and Arnold, each of whom sought to gain as much credit and honor as possible for these events. Most significantly, in an effort led by Henry Knox, artillery from Ticonderoga was dragged across Massachusetts to the heights commanding Boston Harbor, forcing the British to withdraw from that city.

==Background==
In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga&#x27;s location did not appear to be as strategically important as it had been in the French and Indian War, when the French famously defended it against a much larger British force in the 1758 Battle of Carillon, and when the British captured it in 1759. After the 1763 Treaty of Paris, in which the French ceded their North American territories to the British, the fort was no longer on the frontier of two great empires, guarding the principal waterway between them. The French had blown up the fort&#x27;s powder magazine when they abandoned the fort, and it had fallen further into disrepair since then. In 1775 it was garrisoned by only a small detachment of the 26th Regiment of Foot, consisting of two officers and forty-six men, with many of them &quot;invalids&quot; (soldiers with limited duties because of disability or illness). Twenty-five women and children lived there as well. Because of its former significance, Fort Ticonderoga still had a high reputation as the &quot;gateway to the continent&quot; or the &quot;Gibraltar of America&quot;, but in 1775 it was, according to historian Christopher Ward, &quot;more like a backwoods village than a fort.&quot;

Even before shooting started in the American Revolutionary War, American Patriots were concerned about Fort Ticonderoga. The fort was a valuable asset for several reasons. Within its walls was a collection of heavy artillery including cannons, howitzers, and mortars, armaments that the Americans had in short supply. The fort was situated on the shores of Lake Champlain, a strategically important route between the Thirteen Colonies and the British-controlled northern provinces. British forces placed there would expose the colonial forces in Boston to attack from the rear. After the war began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the British General Thomas Gage realized the fort would require fortification, and several colonists had the idea of capturing the fort.

Gage, writing from the besieged city of Boston following Lexington and Concord, instructed Quebec&#x27;s governor, General Guy Carleton, to rehabilitate and refortify the forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point. Carleton did not receive this letter until May 19, well after the fort had been captured.

Benedict Arnold had frequently traveled through the area around the fort, and was familiar with its condition, manning, and armaments. En route to Boston following news of the events of April 19, he mentioned the fort and its condition to members of Silas Deane&#x27;s militia. The Connecticut Committee of Correspondence acted on this information; money was &quot;borrowed&quot; from the provincial coffers and recruiters were sent into northwestern Connecticut, western Massachusetts, and the New Hampshire Grants (now Vermont) to raise volunteers for an attack on the fort.

John Brown, an American spy from Pittsfield, Massachusetts who had carried correspondence between revolutionary committees in the Boston area and Patriot supporters in Montreal, was well aware of the fort and its strategic value. Ethan Allen and other Patriots in the disputed New Hampshire Grants territory also recognized the fort&#x27;s value, as it played a role in the dispute over that area between New York and New Hampshire. Whether either took or instigated action prior to the Connecticut Colony&#x27;s recruitment efforts is unclear. Brown had notified the Massachusetts Committee of Safety in March of his opinion that Ticonderoga &quot;must be seized as soon as possible should hostilities be committed by the King&#x27;s Troops.&quot;

When Arnold arrived outside Boston, he told the Massachusetts Committee of Safety about the cannons and other military equipment at the lightly defended fort. On May 3, the Committee gave Arnold a colonel&#x27;s commission and authorized him to command a &quot;secret mission&quot;, which was to capture the fort. He was issued £100, some gunpowder, ammunition, and horses, and instructed to recruit up to 400 men, march on the fort, and ship back to Massachusetts anything he thought useful.

==Colonial forces assemble==
Arnold departed immediately after receiving his instructions. He was accompanied by two captains, Eleazer Oswald and Jonathan Brown, who were charged with recruiting the necessary men. Arnold reached the border between Massachusetts and the Grants on May 6, where he learned of the recruitment efforts of the Connecticut Committee, and that Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys were already on their way north. Riding furiously northward (his horse was subsequently killed), he reached Allen&#x27;s headquarters in Bennington the next day. Upon arrival, Arnold was told that Allen was in Castleton, to the north, awaiting supplies and more men. He was also warned that, although Allen&#x27;s effort had no official sanction, his men were unlikely to serve under anyone else. Leaving early the next day, Arnold arrived in Castleton in time to join a war council, where he made a case to lead the expedition based on his formal authorization to act from the Massachusetts Committee.

The force that Allen had assembled in Castleton included about 100 Green Mountain Boys, about 40 men raised by James Easton and John Brown at Pittsfield, and an additional 20 men from Connecticut. Allen was elected colonel, with Easton and Seth Warner as his lieutenants. When Arnold arrived on the scene, Samuel Herrick had already been sent to Skenesboro and Asa Douglas to Panton with detachments to secure boats. Captain Noah Phelps, a member of the &quot;Committee of War for the Expedition against Ticonderoga and Crown Point&quot;, had reconnoitered the fort disguised as a peddler seeking a shave. He saw that the fort walls were dilapidated, learned from the garrison commander that the soldiers&#x27; gunpowder was wet, and that they expected reinforcements at any time. He reported this intelligence to Allen, following which they planned a dawn raid.

Many of the Green Mountain Boys objected to Arnold&#x27;s wish to command, insisting that they would go home rather than serve under anyone other than Ethan Allen. Arnold and Allen worked out an agreement, but no documented evidence exists concerning the deal. According to Arnold, he was given joint command of the operation. Some historians have supported Arnold&#x27;s contention, while others suggest he was merely given the right to march next to Allen.

==Capture of the fort==
By 11:30 pm on May 9, the men had assembled at Hand&#x27;s Cove (in what is now Shoreham, Vermont) and were ready to cross the lake to Ticonderoga. Boats did not arrive until 1:30 am, and they were inadequate to carry the whole force. Eighty-three of the Green Mountain Boys made the first crossing with B. Arnold and E. Allen, with Major Asa Douglas going back for the rest. As dawn approached, Allen and Arnold became fearful of losing the element of surprise, so they decided to attack with the men at hand. The only sentry on duty at the south gate fled his post after his musket misfired, and the Americans rushed into the fort. The Patriots then roused the small number of sleeping troops at gunpoint and began confiscating their weapons. Allen, Arnold, and a few other men charged up the stairs toward the officers&#x27; quarters. Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, the assistant to Captain William Delaplace, was awakened by the noise, and called to wake the captain. Stalling for time, Feltham demanded to know by what authority the fort was being entered. Allen, who later claimed that he said it to Captain Delaplace, replied, &quot;In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!&quot; Delaplace finally emerged from his chambers (fully clothed, not with &quot;his breeches in his hand&quot;, as Allen would later say) and surrendered his sword.

Nobody was killed in the battle. The only injury was to one American, Gideon Warren, who was slightly injured by a sentry with a bayonet. Eventually, as many as 400 men arrived at the fort, which they plundered for liquor and other provisions. Arnold, whose authority was not recognized by the Green Mountain Boys, was unable to stop the plunder. Frustrated, he retired to the captain&#x27;s quarters to await forces that he had recruited, reporting to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress that Allen and his men were &quot;governing by whim and caprice&quot; at the fort, and that the plan to strip the fort and send armaments to Boston was in peril. When Delaplace protested the seizure of his private liquor stores, Allen issued him a receipt for the stores, which he later submitted to Connecticut for payment. Arnold&#x27;s disputes with Allen and his unruly men were severe enough that there were times when some of Allen&#x27;s men drew weapons.

On May 12, Allen sent the prisoners to Connecticut&#x27;s Governor Jonathan Trumbull with a note saying &quot;I make you a present of a Major, a Captain, and two Lieutenants of the regular Establishment of George the Third.&quot; Arnold busied himself over the next few days with cataloging the military equipment at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, a task made difficult by the fact that walls had collapsed on some of the armaments.

==Crown Point and the raid on Fort Saint-Jean==
Seth Warner sailed a detachment up the lake and captured nearby Fort Crown Point, garrisoned by only nine men. It is widely recorded that this capture occurred on May 10; this is attributed to a letter Arnold wrote to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety on May 11, claiming that an attempt to sail up to Crown Point was frustrated by headwinds. However, Warner claimed, in a letter dated May 12 from &quot;Head Quarters, Crown Point&quot;, that he &quot;took possession of this garrison&quot; the day before. It appears likely that, having failed on May 10, the attempt was repeated the next day with success, as reported in Warner&#x27;s memoir. A small force was also sent to capture Fort George on Lake George, which was held by only two soldiers.

Troops recruited by Arnold&#x27;s captains began to arrive, some after seizing Philip Skene&#x27;s schooner &quot;Katherine&quot; and several bateaux at Skenesboro. Arnold rechristened the schooner . The prisoners had reported that the lone British warship on Lake Champlain was at Fort Saint-Jean, on the Richelieu River north of the lake. Arnold, uncertain whether word of Ticonderoga&#x27;s capture had reached Saint-Jean, decided to attempt a raid to capture the ship. He had &quot;Liberty&quot; outfitted with guns, and sailed north with 50 of his men on May 14. Allen, not wanting Arnold to get the full glory for that capture, followed with some of his men in bateaux, but Arnold&#x27;s small fleet had the advantage of sail, and pulled away from Allen&#x27;s boats. By May 17, Arnold&#x27;s small fleet was at the northern end of the lake. Seeking intelligence, Arnold sent a man to reconnoiter the situation at Fort Saint-Jean. The scout returned later that day, reporting that the British were aware of the fall of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and that troops were apparently on the move toward Saint-Jean. Arnold decided to act immediately.

Rowing all night, Arnold and 35 of his men brought their bateaux near the fort. After a brief scouting excursion, they surprised the small garrison at the fort, and seized supplies there, along with , a seventy-ton sloop-of-war. Warned by their captives that several companies were on their way from Chambly, they loaded the more valuable supplies and cannons on the &quot;George&quot;, which Arnold renamed the . Boats that they could not take were sunk, and the enlarged fleet returned to Lake Champlain. This activity was observed by Moses Hazen, a retired British officer who lived near the fort. Hazen rode to Montreal to report the action to the local military commander, and then continued on to Quebec City, where he reported the news to General Carleton on May 20. Major Charles Preston and 140 men were immediately dispatched from Montreal to Saint-Jean in response to Hazen&#x27;s warning.

Fifteen miles out on the lake, Arnold&#x27;s fleet met Allen&#x27;s, which was still heading north. After an exchange of celebratory gunfire, Arnold opened his stores to feed Allen&#x27;s men, who had rowed in open boats without provisions. Allen, believing he could seize and hold Fort Saint-Jean, continued north, while Arnold sailed south. Allen arrived at Saint-Jean on May 19, where he was warned that British troops were approaching by a sympathetic Montreal merchant who had raced ahead of those troops on horseback. Allen, after penning a message for the merchant to deliver to the citizens of Montreal, returned to Ticonderoga on May 21, leaving Saint-Jean just as the British forces arrived. In Allen&#x27;s haste to escape the arriving troops, three men were left behind; one was captured, but the other two eventually returned south by land.

==Aftermath==

Ethan Allen and his men eventually drifted away from Ticonderoga, especially once the alcohol began to run out, and Arnold largely controlled affairs from a base at Crown Point. He oversaw the fitting of the two large ships, eventually taking command of &quot;Enterprise&quot; because of a lack of knowledgeable seamen. His men began rebuilding Ticonderoga&#x27;s barracks, and worked to extract armaments from the rubble of the two forts and build gun carriages for them.

Connecticut sent about 1,000 men under Colonel Benjamin Hinman to hold Ticonderoga, and New York also began to raise militia to defend Crown Point and Ticonderoga against a possible British attack from the north. When Hinman&#x27;s troops arrived in June, there was once again a clash over leadership. None of the communications to Arnold from the Massachusetts committee indicated that he was to serve under Hinman; when Hinman attempted to assert authority over Crown Point, Arnold refused to accept it, as Hinman&#x27;s instructions only included Ticonderoga. The Massachusetts committee eventually sent a delegation to Ticonderoga. When they arrived on June 22 they made it clear to Arnold that he was to serve under Hinman. Arnold, after considering for two days, disbanded his command, resigned his commission, and went home, having spent more than £1,000 of his own money in the effort to capture the fort.

When Congress received news of the events, it drafted a second letter to the inhabitants of Quebec, which was sent north in June with James Price, another sympathetic Montreal merchant. This letter, and other communications from the New York Congress, combined with the activities of vocal American supporters, stirred up the Quebec population in the summer of 1775.

When news of the fall of Ticonderoga reached England, Lord Dartmouth wrote that it was &quot;very unfortunate; very unfortunate indeed&quot;.

===Repercussions in Quebec===
News of the capture of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and especially the raids on Fort Saint-Jean, electrified the Quebec population. Colonel Dudley Templer, in charge of the garrison at Montreal, issued a call on May 19 to raise a militia for defense of the city, and requested Indians living nearby to also take up arms. Only 50 men, mostly French-speaking landowning seigneurs and petty nobility, were raised in and around Montreal, and they were sent to Saint-Jean; no Indians came to their aid. Templer also prevented merchants sympathetic to the American cause from sending supplies south in response to Allen&#x27;s letter.

General Carleton, notified by Hazen of the events on May 20, immediately ordered the garrisons of Montreal and Trois-Rivières to fortify Saint-Jean. Some troops garrisoned at Quebec were also sent to Saint-Jean. Most of the remaining Quebec troops were dispatched to a variety of other points along the Saint Lawrence, as far west as Oswegatchie, to guard against potential invasion threats. Carleton then traveled to Montreal to oversee the defense of the province from there, leaving the city of Quebec in the hands of Lieutenant Governor Hector Cramahé. Before leaving, Carleton prevailed on Monsignor Jean-Olivier Briand, the Bishop of Quebec, to issue his own call to arms in support of the provincial defense, which was circulated primarily in the areas around Montreal and Trois-Rivières.

===Later actions near Ticonderoga===
In July 1775, General Philip Schuyler began using the fort as the staging ground for the invasion of Quebec that was launched in late August. In the winter of 1775–1776, Henry Knox directed the transportation of the guns of Ticonderoga to Boston. The guns were placed upon Dorchester Heights overlooking the besieged city and the British ships in the harbor, prompting the British to evacuate their troops and Loyalist supporters from the city in March 1776.

Benedict Arnold again led a fleet of ships at the Battle of Valcour Island, and played other key roles in thwarting Britain&#x27;s attempt to recapture the fort in 1776. The British did recapture the fort in July 1777 during the Saratoga campaign, but had abandoned it by November after Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender at Saratoga.

===Broken communications===
Although Fort Ticonderoga was not at the time an important military post, its capture had several important results. Rebel control of the area meant that overland communications and supply lines between British forces in Quebec and those in Boston and later New York were severed, so the British military command made an adjustment to their command structure. This break in communication was highlighted by the fact that Arnold, on his way north to Saint-Jean, intercepted a message from Carleton to Gage, detailing the military troop strengths in Quebec. Command of British forces in North America, previously under a single commander, was divided into two commands. General Carleton was given independent command of forces in Quebec and the northern frontier, while General William Howe was appointed Commander-in-Chief of forces along the Atlantic coast, an arrangement that had worked well between Generals Wolfe and Amherst in the French and Indian War. In this war, however, cooperation between the two forces would prove to be problematic and would play a role in the failure of the Saratoga campaign in 1777, as General Howe apparently abandoned an agreed-upon northern strategy, leaving General John Burgoyne without southern support in that campaign.

===War of words between Allen and Arnold===
Beginning on the day of the fort&#x27;s capture, Allen and Arnold began a war of words, each attempting to garner for himself as much credit for the operation as possible. Arnold, unable to exert any authority over Allen and his men, began to keep a diary of events and actions, which was highly critical and dismissive of Allen. Allen, in the days immediately after the action, also began to work on a memoir. Published several years later (see Further reading), the memoir fails to mention Arnold at all. Allen also wrote several versions of the events, which John Brown and James Easton brought to a variety of Congresses and committees in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Randall (1990) claims that Easton took accounts written by both Arnold and Allen to the Massachusetts committee, but conveniently lost Arnold&#x27;s account on the way, ensuring that Allen&#x27;s version, which greatly glorified his role in the affair, would be preferred. Smith (1907) indicates that it was highly likely that Easton was interested in claiming Arnold&#x27;s command for himself. There was clearly no love lost between Easton and Arnold. Allen and Easton returned to Crown Point on June 10 and called a council of war while Arnold was with the fleet on the lake, a clear breach of military protocol. When Arnold, whose men now dominated the garrison, asserted his authority, Easton insulted Arnold, who responded by challenging Easton to a duel. Arnold later reported, &quot;On refusing to draw like a gentleman, he having a [sword] by his side and cases of loaded pistols in his pockets, I kicked him very heartily and ordered him from the Point.&quot;

<text>Canadian Pacific Air Lines was a Canadian airline that operated from 1942 to 1987. It operated under the name CP Air from 1968 to 1986. Headquartered at Vancouver International Airport in Richmond, British Columbia, it served domestic Canadian as well as international routes until it was purchased by Pacific Western Airlines and absorbed into Canadian Airlines International.

==History==

In the early 1940s, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company purchased, in a short time span, ten bush airlines: Ginger Coote Airways, Yukon Southern Air Transport, Wings, Prairie Airways, Mackenzie Air Services, Arrow Airways, Starratt Airways, Quebec Airways and Montreal &amp; Dominion Skyways finishing with the purchase of Canadian Airways in 1942, to form Canadian Pacific Air Lines. Early management were largely bush flying pioneers, including president Grant McConachie, superintendent Punch Dickins, and Wop May, who would become a repair depot manager in Calgary.

In 1968, Canadian Pacific Air Lines was rebranded as CP Air. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company (renamed Canadian Pacific Limited in 1971) had decided to align the airline&#x27;s name and &quot;Multimark&quot; design to that of its other subsidiaries, including CP Hotels, CP Ships, and CP Transport (CP Rail was spun off from the parent company later).

===Competition with TCA===
CP Air competed with the government-owned Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA, later Air Canada) for international and transcontinental routes for much of its history. Despite early attempts to merge into one national carrier, CP Air continued to operate routes based on its previous bush flying heritage.

The federal government established limits on domestic market share and, through international agreements, limits on which countries CP Air could fly to. This barred CP Air from the traditional routes such as London and Paris and limited their access to major Canadian routes such as Vancouver-Toronto and Toronto-New York. 

===Overseas and international routes===

The development of the &quot;great circle&quot; or &quot;polar&quot; route to the Far East from CP Air&#x27;s Vancouver base would become one of the cornerstones of the airline. Grant McConachie managed to secure flights to Amsterdam, Australia, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, which helped the airline&#x27;s revenue grow from $3 million in 1942 to $61 million by 1964. Flights to Sydney via stops in Honolulu, Kanton Island (which was a technical stop) and Fiji as well as to Hong Kong via Tokyo (preceded by a technical stop at Shemya Island in Alaska) started in 1949, with Canadair North Star aircraft (which was a version of the DC-4); Douglas DC-4s then took over in 1951 followed by Douglas DC-6Bs in 1953. Flights to Lima, Peru started in 1953 (extended to Buenos Aires in 1956) and to Amsterdam in 1955. In August 1956 three Douglas DC-6B flights a week departed Vancouver for Amsterdam, with two flights departing for Tokyo and Hong Kong, one flight to Auckland, one flight to Sydney, and one flight to Buenos Aires.

Several of the key routes in the early days were as follows:

* Flight numbers 1 &amp; 2, flying Hong Kong – Tokyo – Vancouver – Edmonton – Winnipeg – Toronto – Montreal
* Flights 301/302, flying Sydney – Nadi – Honolulu – Vancouver – Edmonton, and non-stop via the Polar route to Amsterdam. Other flights to Europe included Lisbon, Milan, Rome, and Athens.
* Flights 401/402, flying Vancouver, Mexico City, Lima, Santiago and Buenos Aires
* Flights 501/502, Mexico City – Toronto – Santa Maria (Azores) – Lisbon – Madrid

Other routes duplicated parts of the above, but from the 1959 Intercontinental Timetable these appear to be the main routes, and show the inventiveness that Canadian Pacific Airlines needed to employ and how they developed other overseas routes for Canada. The airline was flying DC-4s and DC-6Bs internationally in the 1950s, introducing turboprop Bristol Britannia aircraft in 1958. Douglas DC-8 jetliners began to replace them from 1961, but the Britannias continued on routes that were unsuitable for the new jets well into the 1960s – for example on the route to New Zealand until Whenuapai closed to civil traffic in November 1965. The big Britannia propjet was also used to fly non-stop service from Windsor, Ontario to Mexico City with this flight originating in Toronto before being replaced by a DC-8. Closer to home, non-stop Boeing 737-200 service from Vancouver to San Francisco was being flown by 1970 followed by non-stop Boeing 727-100 service from Vancouver to Los Angeles by the mid-1970s. Also during the mid-1970s, CP Air was operating stretched Douglas DC-8-63 jetliners (which the airline called the Super DC-8 &quot;Spacemaster&quot;) on the Vancouver-Honolulu-Nandi-Sydney route twice a week. Service to New Zealand resumed in 1985 along with non-stop flights from Vancouver to Hong Kong, and in 1986 CP Air became the first North American airline with a non-stop flight between North America and Mainland China with a weekly flight to Shanghai. Flights to Beijing, Bangkok, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo were added in 1987.

Although Canadian Pacific was not allowed scheduled routes to certain European countries, they were permitted to serve countries which Trans Canada Airlines/Air Canada did not choose to serve, so they developed schedules from 1960 onwards to Netherlands (Amsterdam), Italy (Milan and Rome), Greece (Athens), and later several other international destinations. Amsterdam was their principal European destination for these services, with direct flights to both Eastern and Western Canada, and connections were emphasized onwards to other countries. They also developed extensive charter flights (operated mainly in summertime) beginning in the mid-1960s and through the 1970s and 1980s to Britain, France, Germany and other European points which permitted them some access to these markets. Unusually for charter flights, they were listed in detail in their system timetables to show the full reach of the airline.

===Open skies===

By the late 1970s and early 1980s, many of the routes CP Air had pioneered such as Vancouver–Tokyo were now very lucrative and the previous distribution of routes was considered unfair. In 1979, the federal government eliminated the fixed market share of transcontinental flights for Air Canada (the successor to TCA). While this was a condition that was pressed by CP Air for a long time, it now scrambled to upgrade its fleet to expand on newly available routes such as new nonstop service from Vancouver to Hong Kong and Shanghai to go along with adding more flights to its then current routes like Amsterdam, Rome, Tokyo and Sydney to prepare for increased competition from Air Canada in its traditional territory. This required massive fleet renewal and an associated debt of $1 billion.

This debt load, the increased competition, and the economic downturn in Asia would all work against CP Air&#x27;s future.

===Rebranding and sale===

Having been renamed CP Air in 1968 with a new orange livery, the airline in 1986 reverted to its original name, Canadian Pacific Air Lines, with a new navy blue colour scheme and logo. This occurred shortly after the airline had taken over operations of Eastern Provincial Airways.

This new incarnation, however, was short-lived. Less than a year later, in 1987, Canadian Pacific Air Lines was sold, along with Quebec&#x27;s Nordair, to Calgary-based Pacific Western Airlines (PWA) for $300 million. PWA assumed the airline&#x27;s debt of $600 million. In April 1987, PWA announced that the new name of the merged airline would be Canadian Airlines International. In 2001, Canadian Airlines was taken over by and merged into Air Canada.

The DC-8 had not yet cleared the runway following its arrival. The TAA 727 suffered a gash in its fuselage, but the pilots managed to safely return the aircraft to the airport, so that there were no injuries.
* November 29, 1974: (CP71) Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 71, a Boeing 737, was hijacked while en route from Winnipeg to Edmonton, by a man who wanted to get to Cyprus. The flight landed safely in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, with no fatalities, though the hijacker repeatedly attacked his hostage, a flight attendant, with a dinner knife.
* June 23, 1985: (CP3, CP60) At Narita International Airport, a piece of luggage that had come from CP Air 3 exploded as it was being transferred to Air India Flight 301; the explosion killed two baggage handlers (Hideo Asano and Hideharu Koda) and injured four other people. The same kind of bomb, which CP Air staff had improperly allowed to be loaded on domestic flight CP Air 60 to Toronto and there transferred onto Air India Flight 182, exploded one hour after the Narita explosion, killing everyone onboard AI182, with the 747-200 crashing into the Atlantic Ocean southwest of Ireland.

<text>The Cache River is a tributary of the White River, 213 mi (343 km) long, in northeastern Arkansas in the United States. Its headwaters also drain a small portion of southeastern Missouri. Via the White River, the Cache is part of the Mississippi River watershed, placing the river and surrounding watershed in the Arkansas Delta.

==Ecology==
The river supports 53 mammalian species, over 200 bird species, and nearly 50 species of reptiles and amphibians. The refuge is also the most important wintering area for mallard ducks and other migratory waterfowl on the continent. As a result, low-lying areas in the vicinity of the river&#x27;s lower course are a popular destination for duck hunters. This is also where the ivory-billed woodpecker was recently speculated to have been sighted (after it was believed to be extinct for 60 years). The watershed also contains the largest remaining tract of contiguous bottomland hardwood forest found in North America. Because of these combination of these unique features, the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge was created along approximately along the river&#x27;s lower reaches this location was also used by team trees to plant 20 million trees.

==Hydrology==
The Cache is formed by a confluence of agricultural ditches in Butler County, Missouri and soon enters Arkansas, flowing generally south-southwestwardly. Several portions of the river&#x27;s upper course have been straightened and channelized. It joins the White River at the town of Clarendon, Arkansas.

The river is a slow muddy river with meandering channels, sloughs, swampy areas, and oxbow lakes.

==History==
During the American Civil War, the Battle of Cotton Plant was fought along the Cache River at the town of Cotton Plant.

===Etymology===
The name of the river is probably a Picardie word meaning &quot;hunt&quot; as a reference to the abundant wildlife along the river. The first explorer into the area was Father Marquette, for whom Picard was the native tongue.

<doc id="337150" wikidata="Q315577" url="?curid=337150" title="Hideo Kojima">
<text>is a Japanese video game designer. Regarded as one of the first auteurs of video games, he developed a strong passion for film and literature during his childhood and adolescence, which in turn has had a significant influence on his games. In 1986, Kojima joined Konami, for which he directed, designed and wrote &quot;Metal Gear&quot; (1987) for the MSX2, the game that laid the foundations for the stealth genre and the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; franchise, his best known and most acclaimed work. At Konami, he also produced the &quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; series, as well as designing and writing &quot;Snatcher&quot; (1988) and &quot;Policenauts&quot; (1994), graphic adventure games regarded for their cinematic presentation.

Kojima founded Kojima Productions within Konami in 2005, and he was appointed vice president of Konami Digital Entertainment in 2011. Following his departure from Konami in 2015, he refounded Kojima Productions as an independent studio; his first game outside Konami, &quot;Death Stranding&quot;, was released in 2019.

== Early life ==
Hideo Kojima was born on August 24, 1963, in Setagaya, Tokyo. He is the youngest of three children. His father, Kingo, was a pharmacist who frequently traveled on business, and named Kojima after the most common name among doctors he met. When he was four years old, his family moved to Osaka. Describing that stage of his early life, Kojima said it was an abrupt change of environment, and he spent much of his time thereafter indoors, watching television or making figurines. While the family lived in Osaka, his parents began a tradition of the family watching a film together each night, and he was not allowed to go to bed until the film had finished. They were fond of European cinema, westerns, and horror, and did not limit the type of films he was allowed to see.

Kojima took an interest in filmmaking when a friend brought a Super 8 camera to school. They began filming movies together, charging other children 50 yen to see them. Kojima tricked his parents into funding a trip to an island off the coast of Japan without telling them he wanted to film there. Instead of filming, he spent his time swimming, and on the last day changed the plot to being about zombies. He did not show the film to his parents.

By Kojima&#x27;s teenage years, the family had moved to Kawanishi, Hyōgo, in the Kansai region of Japan. When he was 13 years old, his father died. Kojima has discussed the impact of his father&#x27;s death in interviews, and the subsequent financial hardship faced by his family. He enrolled at university to study economics, and it was there that he decided to join the video game industry. He wrote fiction while studying, even including a short story in his thesis.

==Career==

===Early career===

While still in university, Kojima was initially searching for a way into film production. He hoped that, if he were to win awards for his written fiction, he would be approached about directing a film. At that time, he saw Nintendo&#x27;s Famicom and thought of joining the video game industry. Kojima said that he had no friends interested in cinema to encourage him; his friends were also not supportive when he announced he intended to enter game development. He would frequently lie about his occupation in the early days of a career, when a word for game designer did not exist in the Japanese language, and instead told people he worked for a financial firm.

Kojima joined video game publisher Konami&#x27;s MSX home computer division in 1986. He applied to Konami because it was the only games developer listed on the Japanese stock exchange. He was disappointed with the job initially, hoping to make games for the Famicom, and feeling that the 16 colour palette of the MSX was too restrictive. The first game he worked on was &quot;Penguin Adventure&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Antarctic Adventure&quot;, as an assistant director. It significantly expanded upon the gameplay of &quot;Antarctic Adventure&quot;, adding more action game elements, a greater variety of levels, role-playing elements such as upgrading equipment, and multiple endings. In 2019, &quot;Polygon&quot;&#x27;s Julia Lee wrote that for &quot;a game made over 30 years ago, Penguin Adventure had some in-depth features&quot;. After &quot;Penguin Adventure&quot;, Kojima started to design a game called &quot;&quot;, but the game was canceled when it was found to be too complex to run on the MSX.

=== &quot;Metal Gear&quot; and &quot;Snatcher&quot; (1987–1990) ===
Kojima was asked to take over a project, &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, from a senior associate. Hardware limitations hindered the development of the game&#x27;s combat, and Kojima altered the gameplay to focus on a prisoner escaping instead of fighting, inspired by &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. It was released on July 13, 1987, for the MSX2 home computer in Japan, and on September in that year for Europe. The player controls a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake, who is sent to the fortified state of Outer Heaven to stop a nuclear-equipped walking tank known as &quot;Metal Gear&quot;. &quot;Metal Gear&quot; is one of the earliest examples of the stealth game genre. A port of &quot;Metal Gear&quot; was released for the NES in 1987, with altered graphics, difficulty, and an abridged ending without the titular weapon. Kojima has openly criticized many of the changes made in the port, including poor translation and the abridged ending. In an interview, a programmer on the NES version of the game said his team were asked to complete the port in only three months, and the NES hardware was not capable of implementing the Metal Gear fight.

His next project was the graphic adventure game &quot;Snatcher&quot;, released for the NEC PC-8801 and MSX2 computer platforms in Japan on November 26, 1988. Kojima wrote and directed the game. Kojima planned for the game, a graphic adventure with visual novel elements, to have six chapters, but was instructed to trim it down to two. The team wanted to create a third chapter, but were already over the allowed development schedule so were forced to end the game on a cliffhanger. The cyberpunk-influenced game has a semi-open world design. Kojima and character designer Tomiharu Kinoshita treated the project like making a film or anime rather than a game. Former Konami artist Satoshi Yoshoioka designed many of &quot;Snatcher&quot; characters, said he was persistently guided by Kojima to make the game as cinematic as possible, which later critics have cited as a staple of his work. Adrian Chen of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that one of his innovations was &quot;the way he applied cinematic storytelling to console video games&quot;. &quot;Snatcher&quot; draws heavily from Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), and includes enough references that the game strays near copyright infringement. A port for the Sega CD was made without Kojima, but the amount of text and length of the script made localisation expensive and time-consuming, taking three months. &quot;Snatcher&quot; was modestly successful in Japan, but the western port was a commercial failure, selling only a few thousand units. It has developed a cult following in the west.

In 1990, Kojima wrote a remake of &quot;Snatcher,&quot; &quot;SD Snatcher,&quot; a role-playing video game which adapted the storyline of the original &quot;Snatcher&quot; but significantly changed the environments, details of the plot, and core gameplay mechanics. The &quot;SD&quot; stands for &quot;super deformed&quot; in Japanese media, another way to reference chibi character designs. The characters are depicted in a &quot;super deformed&quot; art style, in contrast to the original game&#x27;s realistic style. Like the original computer versions of &quot;Snatcher&quot;, it was only released in Japan. It abandoned random encounters and introduced a first-person turn-based battle system where the player can aim at specific parts of the enemy&#x27;s body with guns. Such a battle system has rarely been used since, but similar ones can later be found in the role-playing games Square&#x27;s &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; (2000), Bethesda Softworks&#x27;s &quot;Fallout 3&quot; (2008), and Nippon Ichi&#x27;s &quot;Last Rebellion&quot; (2010). In 2007, J. C. Fletcher of &quot;Engadget&quot; said that Kojima&#x27;s choice to stylise the character designs &quot;was some postmodern playfulness from Hideo Kojima [...] downplaying the dramatic aspects of his game and overlaying obvious video game conventions on top of it&quot;, and connected that to a similar playfulness in his later games.

=== &quot;Metal Gear 2&quot; and &quot;Policenauts&quot; (1990–1994) ===
The original &quot;Metal Gear&quot; was a commercial success for its release on the NES, and Konami decided to create a sequel to the game, &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge,&quot; without the involvement of Kojima. When Kojima was riding on the Tokyo transit system, he was told about &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot; by a colleague working on the project, who asked him to make a new Snake game of his own. As a result, Kojima began work on his own sequel, &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;, and the two were both released in 1990. Kojima&#x27;s game would not be released overseas in North America and Europe until its inclusion in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence&quot; (2006). &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot; was a commercial success. The game has received positive reviews from retro-reviewers. IGN notes that &quot;Metal Gear 2&quot; introduced stealth mechanics such as making noise to attract guards, crouching and crawling on the ground, disarming mines, and enemies having view cones.

After memory limitation issues prompted him to take a break during the development of &quot;Snatcher&quot;, Kojima began to explore concepts for &quot;Policenauts.&quot; He wanted the game to remain in the adventure genre, feeling it was the best method to express what he wanted with video games. He was also growing frustrated with game development and wanted &quot;a way to take creative control back from the programmers&quot;. After the release of &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot; (1990), he developed a scripting engine so he could decide when animations and music played instead of the programmers. Development on &quot;Policenauts,&quot; originally called &quot;Beyond&quot;, began in 1990, and lasted four years.

&quot;Policenauts&quot; was released in Japan on July 29, 1994, for the PC-9821. In Japan, critics praised &quot;Policenauts&quot; for its high level of presentation. Both &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; and &quot;Famitsu&quot; praised the quality of animation, voice acting, and its engrossing setting. Retrospective reviews have regarded the game generally positively, and sought to contextualise &quot;Policenauts&quot; within Kojima&#x27;s body of work, as heavily stylized and influenced by films.

=== &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; subseries and mainstream success (1994–2012) ===

In 1994, Kojima began to plan a 3D sequel to &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;, titled &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and originally planned for release on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. After the 3DO was discontinued, development shifted to the Sony PlayStation. For the transition from 2D to 3D graphics, a new engine had to be developed by Kojima and his team. A gameplay demo was first revealed to the public at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show, and was later shown on day 2 of E3 1997 as a short video. The game was released to critical acclaim. Many outlets noted the game&#x27;s cinematic qualities and innovative stealth gameplay. Kojima became a celebrity in video game news media, and was surprised when he began to be recognized in public.

In early 2001, Kojima released the first details of the sequel to &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, for the PlayStation 2. The game&#x27;s highly detailed graphics, physics, and expanded gameplay quickly made it one of the most anticipated games at the time. The game was highly successful and critically acclaimed at release, due to its graphics, gameplay, and storyline, which dealt with myriad philosophical themes as specific as memes, censorship, manipulation, patricide, the inherent flaws of democracy and as grandiose as the nature of reality itself. While &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; appealed to gamers with the discussion of these, the bewildering maze of dialogue and plot revelation in the final hours of the game was a disappointment for many gamers, who expected the Hollywood-style resolution of its forerunner.

Before &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; was released, Kojima produced the game and anime franchise &quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; in 2001 to moderate success. In 2003, he produced &quot;&quot; for the Game Boy Advance, which players take the role of a young vampire hunter who uses a solar weapon which is charged by a photometric sensor on the game cartridge, forcing them to play in sunlight. Another team inside Konami, in a collaboration with Silicon Knights, began work on &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot;, a GameCube enhanced remake of the first &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; with all the gameplay features of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; and with cutscenes redirected by director Ryuhei Kitamura.

Afterwards, Kojima designed and released &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; for the PlayStation 2. Unlike the previous games in the series, which took place in the near future and focused on indoor locations, the game is set in a Soviet jungle during the height of the Cold War in 1964, and features wilderness survival, camouflage, and &quot;James Bond&quot; styled espionage. The North American version was released on November 17, 2004, with the Japanese counterpart following on December 16. The European version was released on March 4, 2005. Critical response to the game was highly favorable. Kojima has said that his mother played it, &quot;It took her an entire year to complete &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot;. She would get her friends to help her. When she defeated The End, [a character the player faces off during the game] she called me up and said: &#x27;It is finished&#x27;.&quot;

At that time, Kojima produced &quot;Boktai&quot;″s sequel, &quot;Boktai 2: Solar Boy Django&quot; for the Game Boy Advance. Released in summer 2004, it makes more extensive use of the cartridge&#x27;s sunlight sensor and allows players to combine various new solar weapons. Also released was &quot;Metal Gear Acid&quot; for the PlayStation Portable handheld. A turn-based game, it is less action-oriented than the other &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games and focuses more on strategy. It was released in Japan on December 16, 2004. Its sequel, &quot;Metal Gear Acid 2&quot;, was released on March 21, 2006.

Kojima wanted Solid Snake to appear in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, but Nintendo refused, due to development cycle problems. When &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; was in development, series director Masahiro Sakurai contacted Kojima to work and add Snake and content related to the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, including a stage based on Shadow Moses Island (the main setting of &quot;Solid&quot;), into the game.

Released in June 2008, Kojima co-directed &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; with Shuyo Murata. Initially, Kojima was not going to direct it, but death threats made the team nervous and he decided to work with them. Kojima received a lifetime achievement award at the MTV Game Awards 2008 in Germany. In his speech, he said in English, &quot;I have to say, even though I received this award, let me state that I will not retire. I will continue to create games as long as I live&quot;.

Before E3 2009, Kojima stated interest in working with a Western developer. This later turned out to be a collaboration between him and Spanish developer MercurySteam to work on &quot;&quot;.

Although he announced that &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; would be the last &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game he would be directly involved in, he announced at E3 2009 that he would return to help on two &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games: &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Rising&quot;, as a producer and &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot; as writer, director, and producer. When interviewed at Gamescom 2009, Kojima stated that he got more involved with &quot;Peace Walker&quot; because &quot;there was a lot of confusion within the team and it didn&#x27;t proceed as I wanted it to. Therefore I thought that I needed to jump in and do &quot;Peace Walker&quot;&quot;.
Kojima was at E3 2010 to show off his team&#x27;s latest project, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Rising&quot;. He was also seen in Nintendo&#x27;s 3DS interview video, where he stated he was interested in making a &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; game for the 3DS and wondered what it would be like in 3D. This game ended up being a remake of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; titled &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D&quot;. In late 2011, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Rising&quot; was renamed &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot; with PlatinumGames being involved in developing it alongside Kojima Productions. Nevertheless, Kojima is the game&#x27;s executive producer and showed interest in working in the game&#x27;s demo. Kojima was satisfied with the final product and expressed the possibility of a sequel if Platinum were to develop it.

On April 1, 2011, Kojima was promoted to Executive Vice President and Corporate Officer in Konami Digital Entertainment. At E3 2011, he revealed a new gaming technology named &quot;transfarring&quot;, a &quot;portmanteau&quot; of the verbs &quot;transferring&quot; and &quot;sharing&quot;, which allows gamers to transfer their game data between the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Portable. Transfarring was used in &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot; and the &quot;Metal Gear Solid HD Collection&quot;.

Later that year, he stated he was working on a new intellectual property with Goichi Suda, tentatively titled &quot;Project S&quot;, and preparing new projects. On July 8, 2011, Kojima announced that &quot;Project S&quot; was a radio-show sequel to &quot;Snatcher&quot;, titled &quot;Sdatcher&quot; as a reference to the show&#x27;s producer Suda. The show would air on Fridays on Kojima&#x27;s bi-weekly Internet radio show, starting with episode No. 300 which was broadcast in August 2011. In October, Kojima announced that he would be collaborating with Suda and 5pb. director Chiyomaru Shikura in producing a new adventure game visual novel. It was initially speculated that the game would be the third entry in 5pb.&#x27;s &quot;Science Adventure&quot; series, but it was later confirmed to be a separate title. The game was planned to have an overseas release and an anime adaption. As of 2023, no further news regarding the project has been released.

=== Final Konami projects and departure (2012–2015) ===
In mid-2012 and in the following years after Kojima finished work on the Fox Engine, Kojima has been connected to the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series. During this time, he indicated that he was interested in making a &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game and the first instance of this was on August 18, 2012. He described his excitement regarding the potential use of the Fox Engine on the eighth generation platforms via a tweet of an image of the DVD for the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; film: Later, he added what he had in mind for this game in a series of tweets: &quot;&quot;Silent Hill&quot; is in closed room setting and doesn&#x27;t require full action so that we can focus on the graphic quality. Enemies featured in the game do not have to be consistent or move fast. It only requires scariness by graphics and presentation. As being a creator, making action games in an open world setting, such a type of game is very enviously attractive. If only someone could create this on the Fox Engine.&quot; After a while, and as a result of Kojima&#x27;s interest in making a &quot;Silent Hill&quot; game, Konami asked him to do so. Kojima explained the story in an interview with Eurogamer:

Additionally, in an interview with Geoff Keighley, when a fan asked &quot;which game do you want to direct or reboot?&quot; Kojima stated without hesitation, &quot;&quot;Silent Hill&quot;.&quot; Keighley jumped in and asked &quot;What do you want to do with &quot;Silent Hill&quot;?&quot; Kojima responded: &quot;A guy [like myself] that is such a chicken and is so easily scared – making a scary game – I&#x27;m very confident that something horrifying would come out from that. But on the other hand I would have to prepare myself to have nightmares every single day. Hopefully sometime in the future I&#x27;m able to work on this, but I would really need to prepare to have daily nightmares&quot;. In August 2014, &quot;PT&quot; was released on the PlayStation Store and revealed that a new game in the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; franchise titled &quot;Silent Hills&quot; was being directed by Kojima for the PlayStation 4, alongside Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro. In April 2015, the playable teaser was removed and the game was cancelled.

At the 2013 Game Developers Conference, Kojima unveiled &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;, which was set to be his final &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game, noting that this time unlike previous announcements that he had stopped working on the series, was very serious about leaving; it was preceded by &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes&quot;, a shorter game released in 2014 and serving as a prologue to &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot;. In March 2015, reports began to surface that Kojima would part ways with longtime publisher Konami after the release of &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot;. Konami later stated that they were auditioning for new staff for future &quot;Metal Gear&quot; titles and removed Kojima&#x27;s name from the series&#x27; marketing material. Despite reports that Kojima left the company in October 2015, a spokesman for Konami stated that he was &quot;taking a long time off from work.&quot; At The Game Awards 2015, &quot;Metal Gear Solid V&quot; won the awards for Best Action Game and Best Score/Soundtrack, but Kojima did not attend the event, being reportedly barred from attending by Konami. Instead, the award was accepted by Kiefer Sutherland on his behalf. On February 18, 2016, &quot;Metal Gear Solid V&quot; won the award for Adventure Game of the Year at the 19th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards. On July 10, 2015, Kojima&#x27;s collaborative voice actor Akio Ōtsuka revealed that Konami had closed Kojima Productions.

=== Independent studio, &quot;Death Stranding&quot; and &quot;OD&quot; (2015–present) ===
On December 16, 2015, Kojima announced that Kojima Productions would be re-established as an independent studio, partnered with Sony Computer Entertainment, and that his first game would be exclusive to PlayStation 4. At E3 2016, Kojima personally announced the game&#x27;s title as &quot;Death Stranding&quot; in a trailer. The trailer featured Norman Reedus, whom Kojima had previously worked with in the canceled &quot;Silent Hills&quot;.

Kojima launched his own YouTube channel in 2016, where he and film critic Kenji Yano discuss their favorite films and matters pertaining to Kojima&#x27;s studio. Starting in 2017, Kojima became a regular contributor to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, often discussing recent film releases, and occasionally drawing comparisons to his own works.

In February 2017, Kojima shared his thoughts on the upcoming Nintendo Switch, comparing its functionality to his earlier &#x27;transfarring&#x27; technology.

&quot;Death Stranding&quot; was released on November 8, 2019. It received generally positive reviews and was a commercial success. It also won a number of awards, including &quot;Best Game Direction&quot; and &quot;Best Score/Music&quot; at The Game Awards 2019, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Audio Design&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Technical Achievement&quot; at the 23rd Annual D.I.C.E. Awards.

In November 2019, talking to BBC Newsbeat as part of a documentary about &quot;Death Stranding&quot;, Kojima said &quot;In the future Kojima Productions will start making films. If you can do one thing well, then you can do everything well&quot;. Kojima went on to explain that he sees that movies, TV shows, and games competing in the same space in the future, thanks to streaming technology, and that this will encourage new formats to emerge. &quot;I&#x27;m very interested in the new format of game that will appear on there and that&#x27;s what I want to take on,&quot; Kojima added.

In June 2022, Kojima and Microsoft revealed that Kojima Productions would be working on a game with Xbox Game Studios that will use Microsoft&#x27;s cloud-based tech. Norman Reedus, in an interview, also confirmed that development for a sequel to &quot;Death Stranding&quot; had started.

In 2022, Kojima began a podcast for Spotify called &quot;Hideo Kojima presents Brain Structure&quot;. The podcast, hosted by Kojima with regular appearances from Geoff Keighley, focuses on Kojima&#x27;s history with game development, as well as his interests in books, music, and cinema.

At several game expos in 2022, Kojima has cryptically teased the casting of an upcoming game being developed by Kojima Productions, with Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna confirmed to star. It was unknown whether the game will be related to &quot;Death Stranding&quot;, the aforementioned Xbox collaboration, or an entirely different project. However, at The Game Awards 2022, Kojima officially revealed the game as the sequel to &quot;Death Stranding&quot;, with the working title &quot;Death Stranding 2&quot;. Reedus, Léa Seydoux, and Troy Baker will be returning from the titular game, with Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna revealed to be the new cast members of the game.

At The Game Awards 2023, Kojima and Jordan Peele announced a new game, titled &quot;OD&quot;, published by Xbox Game Studios. The game stars Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier.

On December 14, 2023, Kojima and film studio A24 announced that a live-action feature film adaptation of &quot;Death Stranding&quot; is being produced.

On January 31, 2024, during the PlayStation State of Play event, Kojima announced that he is working a new action-espionage genre game after &quot;Death Stranding 2&quot;.

==Influences and mentality==
Kojima has cited Yuji Horii&#x27;s &quot;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot; (1983) and Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985) as the games that inspired him to enter the video game industry. &quot;Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot;, a murder mystery adventure game, was an important influence because, according to Kojima, it had &quot;mystery, a 3D dungeon, humor, and a proper background and explanation of why the murderer committed the crime. That is why there was drama in this game. My encountering this game expanded the potential of video games in my mind.&quot; He also stated that it &quot;taught me that one can tell a story and develop plots around a scenario in the game genre&quot;. &quot;Portopia&quot; had an influence on his early works, including &quot;Metal Gear&quot; and particularly &quot;Snatcher&quot;.

Kojima&#x27;s love of film is noticeable in his games where he pays homage through his stories and characters, sometimes to the point of pastiche, as in &quot;Snatcher&quot;. He cited a contrast between films and games as while in his games he intends to portray violence like in a movie, in the game it is up to the player to decide. He wants people to understand the effects of violence. As he considers the games too stressful, he also wants comic relief to contrast it.

&quot;Snatcher&quot; is inspired by many science fiction films, particularly from the 1980s, including &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Akira&quot;, &quot;The Thing&quot;, &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;, and &quot;The Terminator&quot;. Examples of influence by films include Solid Snake&#x27;s codename (named after Snake Plissken from &quot;Escape from New York&quot;), Snake&#x27;s alias in &quot;MGS2&quot;: Pliskin (in reference to the last name of Snake Plissken from the &quot;Escape&quot; movies), Snake&#x27;s real name (Dave from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;), and Snake&#x27;s trademark bandana (&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;).

Film would also have an influence on other aspects of his games. Hal &quot;Otacon&quot; Emmerich (named after HAL 9000 from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and film director Roland Emmerich), Sniper Wolf shooting Meryl in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; (&quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;), Psycho Mantis (inspired from the film &quot;The Fury&quot;), and the whole &quot;Metal Gear&quot; stealth concept (&quot;The Great Escape&quot; and &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;). James Bond also had a large influence on the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, with &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; having a &quot;James Bond&quot;-like introduction sequence. Kojima has written that Metal Gear was &quot;strongly influenced&quot; by the &quot;anti-war and anti-nuke&quot; themes of the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; film franchise.

In an article he wrote for &quot;Official PlayStation 2 Magazine&quot;, Kojima described the influence of the film &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; on the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series. The zombie classic inspired &quot;the maximum three-dimensional use of a closed area like a shopping mall with elevators, air ducts, and escalators&quot;. These aspects are similar enough in his view that &quot;&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; is &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; if you replace soldiers with zombies .&quot;

He also received inspiration from anime. His early works, particularly the cyberpunk adventure game &quot;Snatcher&quot; (which uses anime-style art), were influenced by cyberpunk anime, most notably &quot;Akira&quot; (mentioned above). In an interview, he mentioned that his &quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; series was inspired by mecha/robot anime, such as &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. Mecha anime was also an inspiration for the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, which features mecha robots, such as Metal Gear REX and Metal Gear RAY; this is referred to in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, where Otacon mentions mecha anime as an influence on his Metal Gear REX designs.

In regards to storyline development and interaction with them, he said:

Kojima listed &quot;Another World&quot; on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;, &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; arcade version, &quot;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot; on the Famicom, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, and &quot;Xevious&quot; arcade version as his favorite games in 2000. He stated that &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; was his favorite game by Miyamoto.

In 2019, Kojima published a collection of essays in Japan discussing the influence of pop culture on his work under the title &quot;The Gifted Gene and My Lovable Memes&quot;. The book was published in English by Viz Media in October 2021 under the title &quot;The Creative Gene: How Books, Movies, and Music Inspired the Creator of Death Stranding and Metal Gear Solid&quot;.

In terms of reverse influence on film, his work on the storylines of the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series was cited as an influence by screenwriter David Hayter, the voice actor for Solid Snake, on his screenwriting for Hollywood films. He stated that &quot;Kojima and I have different styles (...) but I&#x27;ve certainly learned things from him, especially about ambiguity and telling a story without giving all the answers&quot;.

Kojima has also influenced a number of actors and auteurs in the film industry. Hollywood actors Mads Mikkelsen and Léa Seydoux have voice roles in &quot;Death Stranding&quot;, while director Guillermo del Toro is amongst his biggest fans.

In 2020, Kojima was a member of the international Jury of the 77th Venice International Film Festival, Virtual Reality section.

== Legacy ==
Kojima has been noted for his influence on the video game industry. &quot;Metal Gear&quot; was the first mainstream stealth game, a genre that was later popularized by &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;. Kojima was also a pioneer in the integration of cinematic techniques in video games, especially &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; which &quot;Eurogamer&quot; considers the &quot;first modern video game&quot;.

Kojima&#x27;s work has been cited as an influence by numerous game developers, including &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; and &quot;Far Cry 2&quot; designer Clint Hocking, &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; producer Mathieu Ferland, Silicon Knights founder Denis Dyack, &quot;Unreal&quot; and &quot;Gears of War&quot; creator Cliff Bleszinski, &quot;Tenchu&quot; creator Takuma Endo, &quot;&quot; creator Tom Leonard, Sumo Digital designer Emily Knox, &quot;Crysis 2&quot; animator Luke Kelly, &quot;Uncharted&quot; writer and &quot;The Last of Us&quot; creator Neil Druckmann, and &quot;2064: Read Only Memories&quot; developer MidBoss. Kojima&#x27;s work has also been cited as an influence on creators outside of the video game industry, including novelist Project Itoh and filmmaker Jordan Peele.

=== Themes ===
Kojima has been noted for predicting and exploring themes in his works years before they gained mainstream notoriety on numerous occasions, ranging from the sociological to the scientific.

&quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; was released on November 13, 2001. While the game received universal acclaim upon release for its gameplay and attention to detail, the plot was a divisive topic among critics, with some calling it &quot;absurd&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot;. Reinterpretations of the game&#x27;s plot began to surface in the 2010s, with some calling it &quot;misunderstood&quot; in its time, eerily prescient, and &quot;necessary for the political climate to come&quot; for predicting some of the cultural issues of the 2010s with striking accuracy and similar concepts. GamesRadar+ has cited the prescience of the game in relation to the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal and the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. The concept of &quot;Selection for Societal Sanity&quot; presented in the game was one of the bases for the paper &quot;Filtration Failure: On Selection for Societal Sanity&quot; written by Adrian Mróz and published in the academic journal &quot;Kultura i Historia.&quot;

In &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;, released on September 1, 2015, the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; bacteria is used to halt the reproduction of the fictional &quot;vocal cord parasites&quot;. At the time, large-scale uses of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; to control insect-transmitted diseases like malaria and dengue only existed in simulated computational models and field-test releases in Australia. Deployment of &quot;Wolbachia&quot; was proposed the next year at the peak of the Zika epidemic in the Americas. Large-scale deployments of the &quot;Wolbachia&quot; bacteria became the most effective way to control and eradicate mosquito-related epidemics as of 2019, with successful deployments in Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Brazil.

Kojima&#x27;s &quot;Death Stranding&quot;, released on November 8, 2019, presents a post-apocalyptic setting in which people live isolated in cities and prepper shelters, unable to go outside because of the hazardous conditions brought on by an event named the &quot;Death Stranding&quot;. The inhabitants of the world rely on &quot;porters&quot;, people who risk their lives making deliveries, to receive and exchange the resources they need to survive. Similarities with the COVID-19 pandemic were noted by numerous journalists in early 2020, including the game&#x27;s focus on the themes of isolation, loneliness, and political divide.

==Personal life==
Kojima is private about his personal life. He is married, with at least two sons, and has at least one brother. His father died when he was thirteen years old, and his mother died in early 2017.

==Awards and accolades==
&quot;Newsweek&quot; named Kojima as one of the top ten people of 2002. In 2008, &quot;Next-Gen&quot; placed him seventh in their list of &quot;Hot 100 Developers 2008&quot;.

In 2009, IGN placed him sixth in their list of top game creators of all time.

In December 2015, Kojima was invited to accept an award from The Game Awards 2015 for &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;, but was prevented from attending by Konami.

In February 2016, Kojima received the AIAS Hall of Fame Award at the 19th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards. In December 2016, Kojima was able to attend The Game Awards 2016 and accepted the Industry Icon Award.

Kojima was named a BAFTA Fellowship in 2020, to be awarded to him during the British Academy Games Awards in April 2020, making him the second Japanese person to receive the award for work on video games after Shigeru Miyamoto.

Kojima holds the distinction of having directed four games (&quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot; and &quot;Death Stranding&quot;) out of the 30 total to have achieved a maximum possible score of 40 from the Japanese video games magazine Famitsu. Kojima has also been directly involved with three games (&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;, and &quot;Death Stranding&quot;) that were nominated for Game of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences at the D.I.C.E. Awards.

On January 20, 2022, Kojima received an Industry Legend Award from the Arab Game Awards.

<doc id="337152" wikidata="Q167572" url="?curid=337152" title="Mary Carey (actress)">
<text>Mary Ellen Cook (born June 15, 1980), known professionally as Mary Carey, is an American former adult film actress, Playboy model, radio host, film director and politician known for her appearance on the VH1 reality TV series &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; and &quot;Sober House&quot;. She was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame in 2013. She ran as a replacement candidate in the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election, and had planned on running in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election, but ultimately decided not to run in the election.

==Early life==
Carey was born to a father with cerebral palsy and a mother with schizophrenia. She was raised by her grandparents from the age of three months old, moving with them to Fort Lauderdale, Florida at the age of seven. She attended Pine Crest preparatory school in Fort Lauderdale on a scholarship. She lost her grandfather to lung cancer when she was 16. In 1999, she enrolled in Florida Atlantic University (FAU) with the intention of getting a degree in theatre. Trained in ballet, she performed on the dance team at FAU. After three years, she left university at 21 to help better provide for her family.

==Career==
In addition to appearing in pornographic films, Carey has also worked as a feature dancer and appeared on Playboy TV.
She retired from performing in adult films in 2008. In January/February 2008, Carey was featured on the VH1 reality TV series &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot;, receiving treatment for alcoholism. While on &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot;, she stated that she would leave the porn industry and straighten out her life because of her mother, who was hospitalized in Florida after jumping off a four-story building as a suicide attempt the previous month.

In the reunion episode of the show taped approximately six months after leaving rehab, she claimed she had not made an adult movie since becoming sober and intends to never make another one. However, she continues to &quot;feature dance&quot; in clubs, saying that she needs the money to care for her mother, but also hopes to stop doing this. In an interview with AVN magazine, Carey stated that she had entered rehab to tackle an addiction to Xanax, which she developed around the time she dropped out of her second run for governor and that the focus on alcohol was created by the show.

In 2009, Carey made a film titled &quot;Celebrity Pornhab with Dr. Screw&quot;. The film is a pornographic parody of the VH1 show and includes a sex scene between Carey and a female costar.

In 2011, Carey was interviewed for &quot;Celebrity Rehab Revisited&quot; stating that, following the end of the show, she had quit Xanax and binge drinking, apart from occasional champagne. She had been married to an electrician for two years and stopped making adult films, but continued making a living with personal appearances in night clubs and strip clubs.

==Politics==
During the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election, Carey signed a contract with Kick Ass Pictures and, as a publicity stunt, they came up with the idea that Carey should run for governor. She was an independent candidate, placing tenth in a field of 135 candidates. She ran on an eleven-point platform that included somewhat tongue-in-cheek promises of taxing breast implants, making lap dances tax-deductible, and creating a &quot;Porn for Pistols&quot; exchange program.

In June 2005, Carey announced her bid for Lieutenant Governor of California as an independent in 2006. She dropped out of the race in October 2006 to care for her mother, who had jumped off a building while off her medications.

In April 2021, Carey announced plans to run in the yet to be declared 2021 California gubernatorial recall election. In July, after the recall election was declared, Carey dropped out of the race, citing the short time scale for filing the paperwork for candidacy. As tribute to the porn industry&#x27;s use of the term MILF, she said that her campaign message was going to be MILF, which she defined as &quot;Moderates and Independents for Liberation and Freedom&quot;.

==Personal life==
In April 2005, Carey was arrested in connection with a Lakewood, Washington, cabaret sting operation, for violating a city strip club ordinance that forbids dancers from sexually touching themselves. She subsequently made a plea agreement and received a 19-month sentence, which was suspended on the condition that she was not charged with any other offense within one year.
