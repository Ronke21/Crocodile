<text>A mortar today is usually a simple, lightweight, man-portable, muzzle-loaded cannon, consisting of a smooth-bore (although some models use a rifled barrel) metal tube fixed to a base plate (to spread out the recoil) with a lightweight bipod mount and a sight. Mortars are typically used as indirect fire weapons for close fire support with a variety of ammunition. Historically mortars were heavy siege artillery. Mortars launch explosive shells (technically called bombs) in high-arching ballistic trajectories.

==History==
Mortars have been used for hundreds of years. The earliest reported use of mortars was in Korea in a 1413 naval battle when Korean gunsmiths developed the &quot;wan&#x27;gu&quot; (gourd-shaped mortar) (완구, 碗口). The earliest version of the &quot;wan&#x27;gu&quot; dates back to 1407. Ch&#x27;oe Hae-san (1380–1443), the son of Ch&#x27;oe Mu-sŏn (1325–1395), is generally credited with inventing the &quot;wan&#x27;gu&quot;. In the Ming dynasty, general Qi Jiguang recorded the use of a mini cannon called the hu dun pao that was similar to the mortar.

The first use in siege warfare was at the 1453 siege of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror. An Italian account of the 1456 siege of Belgrade by Giovanni da Tagliacozzo states that the Ottoman Turks used seven mortars that fired &quot;stone shots one Italian mile high&quot;. The time of flight of these was apparently long enough that casualties could be avoided by posting observers to give warning of their trajectories.

Early mortars, such as the Pumhart von Steyr, were large and heavy and could not be easily transported. Simply made, these weapons were no more than iron bowls reminiscent of the kitchen and apothecary mortars whence they drew their name. An early transportable mortar was invented by Baron Menno van Coehoorn in 1701. This mortar fired an exploding shell, which had a fuse that was lit by the hot gases when fired. The Coehorn mortar gained quick popularity, necessitating a new form of naval ship, the bomb vessel. Mortars played a significant role in the Venetian conquest of Morea, and in the course of this campaign an ammunition depot in the Parthenon was blown up. An early use of these more mobile mortars as field artillery (rather than siege artillery) was by British forces in the suppression of the Jacobite rising of 1719 at the Battle of Glen Shiel. High angle trajectory mortars held a great advantage over standard field guns in the rough terrain of the West Highlands of Scotland.

The mortar had fallen out of general use in Europe by the Napoleonic era, although Manby Mortars were widely used on the coast to launch lines to ships in distress, and interest in their use as a weapon was not revived until the beginning of the 20th century. Mortars were heavily used by both sides during the American Civil War. At the Siege of Vicksburg, General Ulysses S. Grant reported making mortars &quot;by taking logs of the toughest wood that could be found, boring them out for shells and binding them with strong iron bands. These answered as Coehorns, and shells were successfully thrown from them into the trenches of the enemy&quot;.

During the Russo-Japanese War, Lieutenant General Leonid Gobyato of the Imperial Russian Army applied the principles of indirect fire from closed firing positions in the field; and with the collaboration of General Roman Kondratenko, he designed the first mortar that fired navy shells.

The German Army studied the Siege of Port Arthur, where heavy artillery had been unable to destroy defensive structures like barbed wire and bunkers. Consequently they developed a short-barrelled rifled muzzle-loading mortar called the &quot;Minenwerfer&quot;. Heavily used during World War I, they were made in three sizes: , , and .

==Types==
===Stokes mortar===
It was not until the Stokes mortar was devised by Sir Wilfred Stokes in 1915 during the First World War that the modern mortar transportable by one person was born. In the conditions of trench warfare, there was a great need for a versatile and easily portable weapon that could be manned by troops under cover in the trenches. Stokes&#x27; design was initially rejected in June 1915 because it was unable to use existing stocks of British mortar ammunition, and it took the intervention of David Lloyd George (at that time Minister of Munitions) and Lieutenant Colonel J. C. Matheson of the Trench Warfare Supply Department (who reported to Lloyd George) to expedite manufacture of the Stokes mortar. The weapon proved to be extremely useful in the muddy trenches of the Western Front, as a mortar round could be aimed to fall directly into trenches, where artillery shells, because of their low angle of flight, could not possibly go.

The Stokes mortar was a simple muzzle-loaded weapon, consisting of a smoothbore metal tube fixed to a base plate (to absorb recoil) with a lightweight bipod mount. When a mortar bomb was dropped into the tube, an impact sensitive primer in the base of the bomb would make contact with a firing pin at the base of the tube and detonate, firing the bomb towards the target. The Stokes mortar could fire as many as 25 bombs per minute and had a maximum range of , firing the original cylindrical unstabilised projectile.

A modified version of the mortar, which fired a modern fin-stabilised streamlined projectile and had a booster charge for longer range, was developed after World War I; this was in effect a new weapon. By World War II, it could fire as many as 30 bombs per minute and had a range of over with some shell types. The French developed an improved version of the Stokes mortar as the Brandt Mle 27, further refined as the Brandt Mle 31; this design was widely copied with and without license. These weapons were the prototypes for all subsequent light mortar developments around the world.

===Mortar carrier===
 
Mortar carriers are vehicles which carry a mortar as a primary weapon. Numerous vehicles have been used to mount mortars, from improvised civilian trucks used by insurgents, to modified infantry fighting vehicles, such as variants of the M3 half-track and M113 armored personnel carrier, to vehicles specifically intended to carry a mortar. Simpler vehicles carry a standard infantry mortar while in more complex vehicles the mortar is fully integrated into the vehicle and cannot be dismounted from the vehicle. Mortar carriers cannot be fired while on the move, and some must be dismounted to fire.

There are numerous armoured fighting vehicles and even main battle tanks that can be equipped with a mortar, either outside or inside of the cabin. The Israeli Merkava tank uses a mortar as a secondary armament. The Russian army uses the &quot;2S4 Tyulpan&quot; self-propelled heavy mortar which is one of the largest mortars in current use.

===Gun-mortars===
Gun-mortars are breech-loaded mortars usually equipped with a hydraulic recoil mechanism, and sometimes equipped with an autoloader. They are usually mounted on an armoured vehicle and are capable of both direct fire and indirect fire. The archetypes are the Brandt Mle CM60A1 and Brandt 60 mm LR, which combine features of modern infantry mortars together with those of modern cannon. Such weapons are most commonly smoothbore, firing fin-stabilised rounds, using relatively small propellant charges in comparison to projectile weight. While some have been fitted with rifled barrels, such as the 2S31 Vena and 2S9 Nona. They have short barrels in comparison to guns and are much more lightly built than guns of a similar calibre – all characteristics of infantry mortars. This produces a hybrid weapon capable of engaging area targets with indirect high-angle fire, and also specific targets such as vehicles and bunkers with direct fire. Such hybrids are much heavier and more complicated than infantry mortars, superior to rocket-propelled grenades in the anti-armour and bunker-busting role, but have a reduced range compared to modern gun-howitzers and inferior anti-tank capability compared to modern anti-tank guided weapons. However, they do have a niche in, for example, providing a multi-role anti-personnel, anti-armour capability in light mobile formations. Such systems, like the Soviet 120 mm 2S9 Nona, are mostly self-propelled (although a towed variant exists). The AMOS (Advanced Mortar System) is an example of an even more advanced gun mortar system. It uses a 120 mm automatic twin-barrelled, breech-loaded mortar turret, which can be mounted on a variety of armoured vehicles and attack boats. A modern example of a gun-mortar is the 2B9 Vasilek.

===Spigot mortar===

A spigot mortar consists mainly of a solid rod or spigot, onto which a hollow tube in the projectile fits—inverting the normal tube-mortar arrangement. At the top of the tube in the projectile, a cavity contains propellant, such as cordite. There is usually a trigger mechanism built into the base of the spigot, with a long firing pin running up the length of the spigot activating a primer inside the projectile and firing the propellant charge. The advantage of a spigot mortar is that the firing unit (baseplate and spigot) is smaller and lighter than a conventional tube mortar of equivalent payload and range. It is also somewhat simpler to manufacture. Further, most spigot mortars have no barrel in the conventional sense, which means ammunition of almost any weight and diameter can be fired from the same mortar.

The disadvantage is that while most mortar bombs have a streamlined shape towards the back that fits a spigot mortar application well, using that space for the spigot mortar tube takes volume and mass away from the payload of the projectile. If a soldier is carrying only a few projectiles, the projectile weight disadvantage is not significant. However, the weight of a large quantity of the heavier and more complex spigot projectiles offsets the weight saved.

A near-silent mortar can operate using the spigot principle. Each round has a close-fitting sliding plug in the tube that fits over the spigot. When the round is fired, the projectile is pushed off the spigot, but before the plug clears the spigot it is caught by a constriction at the base of the tube. This traps the gases from the propelling charge and hence the sound of the firing. After World War II the Belgium Fly-K silent spigot mortar was accepted into French service as the TN-8111.

A 40mm caseless underbarrel spigot launcher, the Batelle Pogojet has been developed by Armor Development Group.
Spigot mortars generally fell out of favour after World War II and were replaced by smaller conventional mortars. Military applications of spigot mortars include:
* The petard mortar used on the Churchill AVRE by Britain in World War II.
* The Type 98 mortar used by Japan in World War II to some psychological effect in the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa
* The Blacker Bombard and PIAT anti-tank launchers used by Britain in World War II.
* The Hedgehog launcher, used from the deck of a ship, used 24 spigot mortars which fired a diamond pattern of anti-submarine projectiles into the sea ahead of the ship. A sinking projectile detonated if it struck a submarine, and the pattern was such that any submarine partly in the landing zone of the projectiles would be struck one or more times.

Non-military applications include the use of small-calibre spigot mortars to launch lightweight, low-velocity foam dummy targets used for training retriever dogs for bird hunting. Simple launchers use a separate small primer cap as the sole propellant (similar or identical to the cartridges used in industrial nail guns).

===Improvised===

Insurgent groups often use improvised, or &quot;homemade&quot; mortars to attack fortified military installations or terrorise civilians. They are usually constructed from heavy steel piping mounted on a steel frame. These weapons may fire standard mortar rounds, purpose-made shells, repurposed gas cylinders filled with explosives and shrapnel, or any other type of improvised explosive, incendiary or chemical munitions. These were called &quot;barrack busters&quot; by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). 

====Syrian civil war====
Improvised mortars used by insurgents in the Syrian civil war are known as &quot; hell cannons&quot;. Observers have noted that they are &quot;wildly inaccurate&quot; and responsible for thousands of civilian deaths.

====Sri Lankan civil war====
Improvised mortars used in the Sri Lankan civil war by the rebel Tamil Tigers are known as &quot;Pasilan 2000&quot;, also known as a &quot;rocket mortar&quot; or &quot;Arti-mortar&quot; like the cannon, successor to the Baba mortar used by the LTTE for ground operations since the 1980s. As Baba mortar rounds contained tar, they caused a fire when they hit the ground. The Baba, the prototype mortar, was crude. But with time the weapon has improved.

The Pasilan 2000, the improved version, has been developed with characteristics similar to a rocket launcher. The Pasilan 2000 was a heavy mortar fired from a mobile launcher mounted on a tractor. The shell does not emit constant muzzle flares like artillery or MBRL. This is ideal for LTTE&#x27;s camouflage and conceals attacking style. Once a round is fired, forward observers/spies/civilian spotters can correct the fire. The way the tube is installed is similar to the positioning of rocket pods. The length and calibre of the barrel indicate Pasilan 2000 system has common features to the Chinese made Type 82 30-tube MLRS (introduced by the Palestinian Liberation Army (PLA) in the early 1980s) rather than rail-guided Katyusha variants such as the Qassam Rocket. The warhead weight is and it is filled with TNT. It had a range of . The rocket has since then undergone some modifications. The Pasilan 2000 was more lethal than Baba mortar. But it was not heavily used for ground attacks during the Eelam War IV. 

==Modern==
===Design===

Most modern mortar systems consist of four main components: a barrel, a base plate, a bipod and a sight. Modern mortars normally range in calibre from 60 mm (2.36 in) to 120 mm (4.72 in). However, both larger and smaller mortars have been produced. The modern mortar is a muzzle-loaded weapon and relatively simple to operate. It consists of a barrel into which the gunners drop a mortar round. When the round reaches the base of the barrel it hits a fixed firing pin that fires the round. The barrel is generally set at an angle of between 45 and 85 degrees (800 to 1500 mils), with the higher angle producing a shorter horizontal trajectory. Some mortars have a moving firing pin, operated by a lanyard or trigger mechanism.

===Ammunition===

Ammunition for mortars generally comes in two main varieties: fin-stabilised and spin-stabilised. Examples of the former have short fins on their posterior portion, which control the path of the bomb in flight. Spin-stabilised mortar bombs rotate as they travel along and leave the mortar tube, which stabilises them in much the same way as a rifle bullet. Both types of rounds can be either illumination (infrared or visible illumination), smoke, high explosive, and training rounds. Mortar bombs are often referred to, incorrectly, as &quot;mortars&quot;.

Operators may fire spin-stabilised rounds from either a smoothbore or a rifled barrel. Rifled mortars are more accurate but slower to load. Since mortars are generally muzzle-loaded, mortar bombs for rifled barrels usually have a pre-engraved band, called an obturator, that engages with the rifling of the barrel. Exceptions to this are the U.S. M2 4.2-inch mortar and M30 mortar, whose ammunition has a sub-calibre expandable ring that enlarged when fired. This allows the projectile to slide down the barrel freely but grip the rifling when fired. The system resembles the Minié ball for muzzle-loading rifles. For extra range, propellant rings (augmentation charges) are attached to the bomb&#x27;s fins. The rings are usually easy to remove, because they have a major influence on the speed and thus the range of the bomb. Some mortar rounds can be fired without any augmentation charges, e.g., the 81 mm L16 mortar.

===Precision guided===

The XM395 Precision Guided Mortar Munition (PGMM) is a 120 mm guided mortar round developed by Alliant Techsystems. Based on Orbital ATK&#x27;s Precision Guidance Kit for 155 mm artillery projectiles, XM395 combines GPS guidance and directional control surfaces into a package that replaces standard fuses, transforming existing 120 mm mortar bodies into precision-guided munitions. The XM395 munition consists of a GPS-guided kit fitted to standard 120 mm smoothbore mortar rounds that includes the fitting of a nose and tail subsystem containing the maneuvering parts.

The Strix mortar round is a Swedish endphase-guided projectile fired from a 120 mm mortar currently manufactured by Saab Bofors Dynamics. STRIX is fired like a conventional mortar round. The round contains an infrared imaging sensor that it uses to guide itself onto any tank or armoured fighting vehicle in the vicinity where it lands. The seeker is designed to ignore targets that are already burning. Launched from any 120 mm mortar, STRIX has a normal range of up to . The addition of a special sustainer motor increases the range to .

The GMM 120 (&quot;Guided Mortar Munition 120&quot;; known as Patzmi; also referred to as Morty) is a GPS and/or laser-guided mortar munition, which was developed by Israel Military Industries. Another Israeli guided mortar is Iron Sting, developed by Elbit. The Russian KM-8 Gran is also laser-guided. 

==Compared to long range artillery==
Modern mortars and their ammunition are generally much smaller and lighter than long range artillery, such as field guns and howitzers, which allows light () and medium (/) mortars to be considered light weapons; i.e. capable of transport by personnel without vehicle assistance. 

Mortars are short-range weapons and often more effective than long range artillery for many purposes within their shorter range. In particular, because of its high, parabolic trajectory with a near vertical descent, the mortar can land bombs on nearby targets, including those behind obstacles or in fortifications, such as light vehicles behind hills or structures, or infantry in trenches or spider holes. This also makes it possible to launch attacks from positions lower than the target of the attack. (For example, long-range artillery could not shell a target away and higher, a target easily accessible to a mortar.)
In trench warfare, mortars can use plunging fire directly into the enemy trenches, which is very hard or impossible to accomplish with long range artillery because of its much flatter trajectory. Mortars are also highly effective when used from concealed positions, such as the natural escarpments on hillsides or from woods, especially if forward observers are being employed in strategic positions to direct fire, an arrangement where the mortar is in relatively close proximity both to its forward observer and its target, allowing for fire to be quickly and accurately delivered with lethal effect. Mortars suffer from instability when used on snow or soft ground, because the recoil pushes them into the ground or snow unevenly. A Raschen bag addresses this problem.

Fin-stabilised mortar bombs do not have to withstand the rotational forces placed upon them by rifling or greater pressures, and can therefore carry a higher payload in a thinner skin than rifled artillery ammunition. Because of the difference in available volume, a smooth-bore mortar of a given diameter will have a greater explosive yield than a similarly sized artillery shell of a gun or howitzer. For example, a 120 mm mortar bomb has approximately the same explosive capability as a 152 mm/155 mm artillery shell. Also, fin-stabilised munitions fired from a smooth-bore, which do not rely on the spin imparted by a rifled bore for greater accuracy, do not have the drawback of veering in the direction of the spin.

==Largest mortars==
From the 17th to the mid-20th century, very heavy, relatively immobile siege mortars were used, of up to calibre, often made of cast iron and with an outside barrel diameter many times that of the bore diameter. An early example was Roaring Meg, with a barrel diameter and firing a hollow ball filled with gunpowder and used during the English Civil War in 1646.

The largest mortars ever developed were the Belgian &quot;Monster Mortar&quot; () developed by Henri-Joseph Paixhans in 1832, Mallet&#x27;s Mortar () developed by Robert Mallet in 1857, and the &quot;Little David&quot; (() developed in the United States for use in World War II. Although the latter two had a calibre of , only the &quot;Monster Mortar&quot; was used in combat (at the Battle of Antwerp in 1832). The World War II German Karl-Gerät was a mortar and the largest to see combat in modern warfare.

<text>Tantric sex or sexual yoga refers to a range of practices in Hindu and Buddhist tantra that utilize sexual activity in a ritual or yogic context. Tantric sex is associated with antinomian elements such as the consumption of alcohol, and the offerings of substances like meat to deities. Moreover, sexual fluids may be viewed as power substances and used for ritual purposes, either externally or internally.

The actual terms used in the classical texts to refer to this practice include &quot;Karmamudra&quot; (Tibetan: ལས་ཀྱི་ཕྱག་རྒྱ &quot;las kyi phyag rgya&quot;, &quot;action seal&quot;) in Buddhist tantras and &quot;Maithuna&quot; (Devanagari: मैथुन, &quot;coupling&quot;) in Hindu sources. In Hindu Tantra, Maithuna is the most important of the five makara (five tantric substances) and constitutes the main part of the Grand Ritual of Tantra variously known as Panchamakara, Panchatattva, and Tattva Chakra. In Tibetan Buddhism, karmamudra is often an important part of the completion stage of tantric practice.

While there may be some connection between these practices and the Kāmashāstra literature (which include the &quot;Kāmasūtra&quot;), the two practice traditions are separate methods with separate goals. As the British Indologist Geoffrey Samuel notes, while the kāmasāstra literature is about the pursuit of sexual pleasure (kāmā), sexual yoga practices are often aimed towards the quest for liberation (moksha).

==History==
In its earliest forms, Tantric intercourse was usually directed to generate sexual fluids that constituted the &quot;preferred offering of the Tantric deities.&quot; While there is already a mention of ascetics practicing it in the 4th century CE &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, those techniques were rare until late Buddhist Tantra. Up to that point, sexual emission was both allowed and emphasized. Around the start of the first millennium, Tantra began to include practices of semen retention, like the penance ceremony of &quot;asidharavrata&quot; and the posterior yogic technique of vajroli mudra. They were probably adopted from ancient, non-Tantric celibate schools, like those mentioned in &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

The &quot;Brhadaranyaka Upanisad&quot; contains various sexual rituals and practices which are mostly aimed at obtaining a child which are concerned with the loss of male virility and power. One passage from the &quot;Brhadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; states:

Her vulva is the sacrificial ground; her pubic hair is the sacred grass; her labia majora are the Soma-press; and her labia minora are the fire blazing at the centre. A man who engages in sexual intercourse with this knowledge obtains as great a world as a man who performs a Soma sacrifice, and he appropriates to himself the merits of the women with whom he has sex. The women, on the other hand, appropriate to themselves the merits of a man who engages in sexual intercourse with them without this knowledge. (&quot;Brhadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; 6.4.3, trans. Olivelle 1998: 88)

According to Samuel, late Vedic texts like the &quot;Jaiminiya Brahmana&quot;, the &quot;Chandogya Upanisad&quot;, and the &quot;Brhadaranyaka Upanisad,&quot; &quot;treat sexual intercourse as symbolically equivalent to the Vedic sacrifice, and ejaculation of semen as the offering.&quot; However, he also writes that while it is possible that some kind of sexual yoga existed in the fourth or fifth centuries, &quot;Substantial evidence for such practices, however, dates from considerably later, from the seventh and eighth centuries, and derives from Saiva and Buddhist Tantric circles.&quot;

Tantric sexual practices are often seen as exceptional and elite, and not accepted by all sects. They are found only in some tantric literature belonging to Buddhist and Hindu Tantra, but are entirely absent from Jain Tantra. In the Kaula tradition and others where sexual fluids as power substances and ritual sex are mentioned, scholars disagree in their translations, interpretations and practical significance.

Emotions, eroticism and sex are universally regarded in Tantric literature as natural, desirable, a means of transformation of the deity within. Pleasure and sex is another aspect of life and a &quot;root of the universe&quot;, whose purpose extends beyond procreation and is another means to spiritual journey and fulfillment. This idea flowers with the inclusion of kama art in Hindu temple arts, and its various temple architecture and design manuals such as the &quot;Shilpa-prakasha&quot; by the Hindu scholar Ramachandra Kulacara.

==Practice==
===In Hinduism===

The actual term used in Hindu classical texts to refer to this practice is (Devanagari: मैथुन, &quot;coupling&quot;). In the Hindu Tantras, is always presented in the context of (the five or tantric substances) which constitutes primary ritual of Tantra. These may also be referred to as &quot;the five Ms&quot;, or the , which consist of (alcohol), (meat), (fish), (pound grain), and (sexual intercourse). Taboo-breaking elements are only practiced literally by &quot;left-hand path&quot; tantrics (&quot;vāmācārin&quot;s), whereas &quot;right-hand path&quot; tantrics (&quot;dakṣiṇācārin&quot;s) use symbolic substitutes.

Jayanta Bhatta, the 9th-century scholar of the Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy and who commented on Tantra literature, stated that the Tantric ideas and spiritual practices are mostly well placed, but it also has &quot;immoral teachings&quot; such as by the so-called &quot;Nilambara&quot; sect where its practitioners &quot;wear simply one blue garment, and then as a group engage in unconstrained public sex&quot; on festivals. He wrote, this practice is unnecessary and it threatens fundamental values of society. This sect might have been an offshoot of the Pashupata Shaivite school, or possibly a Buddhist cult of Vajrapani.

Ascetics of the Shaivite school of Mantramarga, in order to gain supernatural power, reenacted the penance of Shiva after cutting off one of Brahma&#x27;s heads (Bhikshatana). They worshipped Shiva with impure substances like alcohol, blood and sexual fluids generated in orgiastic rites with their consorts.

Douglas Renfrew Brooks states that the antinomian elements such as the use of intoxicating substances and sex were not animistic, but were adopted in some Kaula traditions to challenge the Tantric devotee to break down the &quot;distinctions between the ultimate reality of Brahman and the mundane physical and mundane world&quot;. By combining erotic and ascetic techniques, states Brooks, the Tantric broke down all social and internal assumptions, became Shiva-like. In Kashmir Shaivism, states David Gray, the antinomian transgressive ideas were internalized, for meditation and reflection, and as a means to &quot;realize a transcendent subjectivity&quot;.

As part of tantric inversion of social regulations, sexual yoga often recommends the usage of consorts from the most taboo groups available, such as close relatives or people from the lowest, most contaminated castes. They must be young and beautiful, as well as initiates in tantra.

===In Buddhism===

According to English, Buddhist sexual rites were incorporated from Shaiva tantra. One of the earliest mentions of sexual yoga is in the Mahayana Buddhist &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra&quot; of Asanga (c. 5th century). The passage states:

Supreme self-control is achieved in the reversal of sexual intercourse in the blissful Buddha-poise and the untrammelled vision of one&#x27;s spouse.

According to David Snellgrove, the text&#x27;s mention of a ‘reversal of sexual intercourse’ might indicate the practice of withholding ejaculation. Snellgrove states:

It is by no means improbable that already by the fifth century when Asanga was writing, these techniques of sexual yoga were being used in reputable Buddhist circles, and that Asanga himself accepted such a practice as valid. The natural power of the breath, inhaling and exhaling, was certainly accepted as an essential force to be controlled in Buddhist as well as Hindu yoga. Why therefore not the natural power of the sexual force? [...] Once it is established that sexual yoga was already regarded by Asanga as an acceptable yogic practice, it becomes far easier to understand how Tantric treatises, despite their apparent contradiction of previous Buddhist teachings, were so readily canonized in the following centuries.

Deities like Vajrayogini, sexually suggestive and streaming with blood, overturn traditional separation between intercourse and menstruation. Some extreme texts would go further, such as the 9th-century Buddhist text &quot;Candamaharosana-tantra&quot;, which advocated consumption of bodily waste products of the practitioner&#x27;s sexual partner, like wash-water of her anus and genitalia. Those were thought to be &quot;power substances&quot;, teaching the waste should be consumed as a diet &quot;eaten by all the Buddhas.&quot;

====Japanese Buddhism====

12th-century Japanese school Tachikawa-ryu did not discourage ejaculation in itself, considering it a &quot;shower of love that contained thousands of potential Buddhas&quot;. They employed emission of sexual fluids in combination with worshipping of human skulls, which would be coated in the resultant mix in order to create honzon. However, those practices were considered heretical, leading to the sect&#x27;s suppression.

====Tibetan Buddhism====
In Tibetan Buddhism, the higher tantric yogas are generally preceded by preliminary practices (Tib. &quot;ngondro&quot;), which include sutrayana practices (i.e. non-tantric Mahayana practices) as well as preliminary tantric meditations. Tantric initiation is required to enter into the practice of tantra.

Tibetan tantric practice refers to the main tantric practices in Tibetan Buddhism. The great Rime scholar Jamgön Kongtrül refers to this as &quot;the Process of Meditation in the Indestructible Way of Secret Mantra&quot; and also as &quot;the way of mantra,&quot; &quot;way of method&quot; and &quot;the secret way&quot; in his &quot;Treasury of Knowledge&quot;. These Vajrayāna Buddhist practices are mainly drawn from the Buddhist tantras and are generally not found in &quot;common&quot; (i.e. non-tantric) Mahayana. These practices are seen by Tibetan Buddhists as the fastest and most powerful path to Buddhahood.

&quot;Unsurpassable Yoga Tantra&quot;, (Skt. &quot;anuttarayogatantra&quot;, also known as &quot;Mahayoga&quot;) are in turn seen as the highest tantric practices in Tibetan Buddhism. Anuttarayoga tantric practice is divided into two stages, the &quot;generation stage&quot; and the &quot;completion stage.&quot; In the generation stage, one meditates on emptiness and visualizes one&#x27;s chosen deity (&quot;yidam&quot;), its mandala and companion deities, resulting in identification with this divine reality (called &quot;divine pride&quot;). This is also known as deity yoga (&quot;devata yoga&quot;).

In the completion stage, the focus is shifted from the form of the deity to direct realization of ultimate reality (which is defined and explained in various ways). Completion stage practices also include techniques that work with the subtle body substances (Skt. &quot;bindu&quot;, Tib. &quot;thigle&quot;) and &quot;vital winds&quot; (&quot;vayu, lung&quot;), as well as the luminous or clear light nature of the mind. They are often grouped into different systems, such as the six dharmas of Naropa, or the six yogas of Kalachakra.

Karmamudrā refers to the female yogini who engages in such a practice and the technique which makes use of sexual union with a physical or visualized consort as well as the practice of inner heat (tummo) to achieve a non-dual state of bliss and insight into emptiness. In Tibetan Buddhism, proficiency in tummo yoga, a completion stage practice, is generally seen as a prerequisite to the practice of karmamudrā.

<text>Lekë III Dukagjini (1410–1481), mostly known as Lekë Dukagjini, was a 15th-century member of the Albanian nobility, from the Dukagjini family. A contemporary of Skanderbeg, Dukagjini is known for the &quot;Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit&quot;, a code of law instituted among the tribes of northern Albania. Dukagjini is believed to have been born in Lipjan, Kosovo.

== Biography ==
The Dukagjini Principality stretched from Northern Albania and into modern Kosovo. The western part of Kosovo, sometimes referred to as &quot;Rrafshi i Dukagjinit or Dukagjin&quot;, takes its name after the Dukagjini family. Until 1444 he was pronoier of Koja Zaharia. He took over the county from his father Prince Pal II Dukagjini in 1446, who appears to have died of apoplexy.

Dukagjini fought under the command of Skanderbeg against the Ottomans during the last two years of the legendary War of Skanderbeg. During times of peace they also fought against one another, as Albanian loyalties came and went during that period of their history. Lekë Dukagjini ambushed and killed Lekë Zaharia Altisferi, prince of Dagnum. The two princes had been in dispute over who should marry Irene Dushmani. Irene was the only child of Lekë Dushmani, prince of Zadrima. In 1445, the Albanian princes had been invited to the wedding of Skanderbeg&#x27;s younger sister, Mamica, who was being married to Muzaka Thopia. Irene entered the wedding and hostilities began. Dukagjini asked Irene to marry him but Zaharia, drunk, saw this and assaulted Dukagjini. Some princes attempted to stop the fight, but only more people became involved, resulting in several deaths until peace was established. Neither of the two antagonists had suffered any physical damage, but after the event Dukagjini was morally humiliated. Two years later, in 1447, in an act of revenge, Dukagjini ambushed and killed Zaharia.
However, original Venetian documents contradict this account by showing that this murder happened in 1444. According to Venetian chronicler Stefano Magno it was Nicholas Dukagjin, Zaharia&#x27;s vassal, who killed Lekë Zaharia in the battle, not Lekë as stated by Marin Barleti. 

Nonetheless, the death of Zaharia left his princedom with no successor, resulting in his mother handing the fortress over to Venetian Albania, a stretch of possessions of the Republic of Venice. When Skanderbeg tried (unsuccessfully) to capture Dagnum in 1447 this began the Albanian–Venetian War (1447–1448). In March 1451 Lekë Dukagjini and Božidar Dushmani planned to attack Venetian controlled Drivast. Their plot was discovered and Božidar was forced to flee into exile.
In 1459 Skanderbeg&#x27;s forces captured the fortress of Sati from the Ottoman Empire and Skanderbeg ceded it to Venice in order to secure a cordial relationship with Signoria before he sent his troops to Italy to help King Ferdinand to regain and maintain his kingdom after the death of king Alfonso V of Aragon. Before the Venetians took over the control of Sati, Skanderbeg captured it and the surrounding area, driving Lekë Dukagjini and his forces away, because he was opposed to Skanderbeg and destroyed Sati before the Venetian takeover.

Dukagjini continued to fight with limited success against the Ottoman Empire, carrying on as the leader of the League of Lezhë after the death of Skanderbeg, until 1479. At times his forces united with the Venetians with the blessing of the Pope.

Lekë Dukagjini married Theodora Muzaka with whom he had no issue. However, he did have two natural sons, Stefan and Nicholas Dukagjini. 

== Legacy ==

The Law of Lek Dukagjini (kanun) was named after Lekë Dukagjini who codified the customary laws of the Albanian highlands. Although researchers of history and customs of Albania usually refer to Gjeçovi&#x27;s text of the Kanuni as the only existing version which is uncontested and written by Lekë Dukagjini, it was actually incorrect. The text of the Kanuni, often contested and with many different interpretations which significantly evolved since 15th century, was only named after Dukagjini. Whilst identifying Skanderbeg as the &quot;dragon prince&quot; who dared to fight against any foe, chronicles portray Dukagjini as the &quot;angel prince&quot; who, with dignity and wisdom, ensured the continuity of the Albanian identity.

The set of laws were active in practice for a long time, but it was not gathered and codified until the late 19th century by Shtjefën Gjeçovi. The most infamous laws of Kanuni are those regulating blood feuds. Blood feuds have started once again in Albania (and have since spread to other parts of Albania, and even to expatriates abroad) after the fall of communism in the early 1990s, having been outlawed for many years during the regime of Enver Hoxha, and contained by the relatively closed borders.

Dukagjini&#x27;s military campaigns against the Ottomans had limited success; he also lacked the ability to unite the country and the Albanian people in the way that Skanderbeg had. Loyalties wavered, and splintered, betrayals were common, and Albania fell into complete submission to the Ottomans by the end of the 15th century.

<text>Suctoria are ciliates that become sessile in their developed stage and then lose their redundant cilia. They feed by extracellular digestion. They were originally thought to feed by suction – hence their name. In fact, they use specialized microtubules to ensnare and manipulate their prey. They live in both freshwater and marine environments, including some that live on the surface of aquatic animals, and typically feed on other ciliates. Instead of a single cytostome, each cell feeds by means of several specialized tentacles. These are supported by microtubules and phyllae, and have toxic extrusomes called haptocysts at the tip, which they attach to prey. They then suck the prey&#x27;s cytoplasm directly into a food vacuole inside the cell, where they digest and absorb its contents. Most suctoria are around 15-30 μm in size, with a non-contractile stalk and often a lorica or shell.

Suctoria reproduce primarily by budding, producing swarmers that lack both tentacles and stalks but have cilia. They may also reproduce through conjugation, which is peculiar in involving cells of different size and often involves total fusion. The way buds form is the primary distinction between different orders of suctoria. Among the Exogenida, including common genera like &quot;Podophrya&quot; and &quot;Sphaerophrya&quot;, they appear directly on the cell surface. Among the Endogenida, for instance &quot;Tokophrya&quot; and &quot;Acineta&quot;, they form in an internal pouch and escape through an opening—and among the Evaginogenida, they form in a pouch that inverts before they are released.

Once the swarmers have found a place to attach themselves, they quickly develop stalks and tentacles. The cilia are lost, but the underlying infraciliature persists throughout the entire life-cycle. This has a structure that, together with other ultrastructural similarities, places the suctoria within the class Phyllopharyngea.

At MIT, institute professors are granted a unique level of freedom and flexibility to pursue their research and teaching interests without regular departmental or school responsibilities; they report only to the provost. Usually no more than twelve professors hold this distinction at any one time. 

Institute professors are initially nominated by leaders representing either a department or school. The chair of the faculty then consults with the Academic Council and jointly appoints with the president an ad-hoc committee from various departments and non-MIT members to evaluate the qualifications and make a documented recommendation to the president. The final determination is made based upon recommendations from professionals in the nominee&#x27;s field. The case is then reviewed again by the Academic Council and approved by the executive committee of the MIT Corporation. The position was created by President James R. Killian in 1951, and John C. Slater was the first to hold the title.

<doc id="324552" wikidata="Q2542251" url="?curid=324552" title="Angel Dust (Faith No More album)">
<text>Angel Dust is the fourth studio album by American rock band Faith No More, released on June 8, 1992, by Slash and Reprise Records. It is the follow-up to 1989&#x27;s highly successful &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, and was the band&#x27;s final album to feature guitarist Jim Martin. It was also the first album where vocalist Mike Patton had any substantial influence on the band&#x27;s music, having been hired after the other band members had written and recorded everything for &quot;The Real Thing&quot; except vocals and most of the lyrics. The band stated that they wanted to move away from the funk metal style of their prior releases, towards a more &quot;theatrical&quot; sound.

&quot;Angel Dust&quot; is Faith No More&#x27;s best-selling album to date, having sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide. It also debuted at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the band&#x27;s only top-ten album in the United States.

==Background, title and artwork==
Following the success of their previous album &quot;The Real Thing&quot; and its subsequent tour, Faith No More took a break for a year and a half before beginning work on the follow-up, &quot;Angel Dust&quot;. During this time Mike Patton rejoined his high-school band Mr. Bungle to record their eponymous debut album. They decided not to &quot;play it safe&quot; and instead took a different musical direction, much to the dismay of guitarist Jim Martin. Martin also did not like the title of the album as chosen by keyboardist Roddy Bottum. In an interview taken while they were in the studio he said that &quot;Roddy [Bottum] wanted to name it &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, I don&#x27;t know why, I just want you to know that if it&#x27;s named &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, it didn&#x27;t have anything to do with me.&quot; He also stated that Bottum was the one who came up with a basic concept of a bird front cover and a meat locker back cover.

Bottum stated that he chose the name because it &quot;summed up what [they] did perfectly&quot; in that &quot;it&#x27;s a really beautiful name for a really hideous drug and that should make people think.&quot; Similarly, the artwork contrasted one beautiful image with a gruesome one by depicting a soft blue airbrushed great egret on the front cover (photographed by Werner Krutein) while on the back is an image of a cow hanging on a meat hook (created by Mark Burnstein). Both bassist Billy Gould and Mike Bordin said that the image on the rear of the album is not based on support for vegetarianism but rather a preview of the music, suggesting its combination of being &quot;really aggressive and disturbing and then really soothing&quot;, the &quot;beautiful with the sick&quot;.

The photo of a group of Russian soldiers with the band members&#x27; faces inserted was edited by Werner Krutein and used as the cover of the &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot; single. The band had originally planned for this but then did not like the final product. Mike Bordin described the situation:

==Writing and recording==
===Writing process===
The writing for &quot;Angel Dust&quot; took up most of 1991 with large portion of the songs being written by either Billy Gould, Roddy Bottum, Mike Bordin, and for the first time, Mike Patton. Regarding this Patton said:

Some attributed this to its sonic difference with its predecessors, however, Mike Patton credits it to being &quot;better at playing what [they] hear in [their] heads&quot; and went on to say that &quot;before, we used to kinda cheat around, and play around what it was. We could never translate it into the band, and we&#x27;re getting better at doing that. Like, we wanted to do a real lazy, sappy kinda ballad, so we covered the theme from &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;! And there&#x27;s even a song that sounds like The Carpenters!&quot; In a trend that started when then-vocalist Chuck Mosley lived in Los Angeles while the rest of the band resided in the Bay Area, the band would record demo tapes of the songs and exchange them between each other in Los Angeles before sending them to Jim Martin so that he could work on his guitar arrangements, after which he would send them back for approval.

Album producer Matt Wallace stated there was a great deal of tension between Jim Martin and the rest of the band that made the recording sessions difficult. Speaking on the acrimony, Wallace said:

The lyrics for &quot;Angel Dust&quot; were written for the most part by vocalist Mike Patton. He got his inspiration for the lyrics from many different places such as questions from the Oxford Capacity Analysis, fortune cookies and late-night television. After engaging in a sleep deprivation experiment, he wrote &quot;Land of Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Caffeine&quot;: Patton added that, &quot;I drove around a lot in my Honda, drove to a real bad area of town, parked and just watched people. Coffee shops and white-trash diner-type places were great for inspiration.&quot; Patton described &quot;RV&quot; as being a character sketch based on the &quot;white-trash&quot; people he was observing during the making of the album. He said in 1992, &quot;it&#x27;s the white trash saga: You wake up, you do nothing and you talk a lot of shit... and that&#x27;s what the song does.&quot;

Songs with lyricists other than Patton include &quot;Be Aggressive&quot; by Roddy Bottum (about fellatio); &quot;Everything&#x27;s Ruined&quot;, by Mike Patton and Billy Gould; &quot;Kindergarten&quot; by Mike Patton and Roddy Bottum; and &quot;Jizzlobber&quot;, by Jim Martin and Mike Patton, which according to Patton, is about his fear of imprisonment. However, Gould, in response to a question by a fan, suggested that the song is about a porn star. &quot;Be Aggressive&quot; has homosexual undertones, with Bottum having come out as gay around this time. He said in December 1992 that &quot;what I like about &#x27;Be Aggressive&#x27; is that even though it&#x27;s macho in a homosexual way, lots of FNM listeners probably imagine that it is a woman who is getting down on her knees and swallowing rather than a man. I guess it&#x27;s easier for people to understand and deal with it that way.&quot; 

In addition to exploring instrumental film music with their cover of the &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; theme, the band was experimenting with doing other songs in non-rock genres during this time, including country music on &quot;RV&quot; (which had a working title of &quot;Country Western&quot;), polka music on the B-side &quot;Das Schützenfest&quot; and R&amp;B/soul music on the bonus track &quot;Easy&quot;, which was a cover of the 1977 Commodores song. They would continue to explore doing songs in different genres on their next two releases, with 1995&#x27;s &quot;King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime&quot; having a significant number of tracks which weren&#x27;t written in the style of rock songs.

===Recording process===
For the recording of &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, Faith No More were once again assisted by Matt Wallace, who had produced all of the group&#x27;s previous studio recordings. They entered Coast Recorders in late 1991, originally set to track a total of 17 songs; however after writing two more while in studio (&quot;Malpractice&quot; being one of them), a total of 19 were recorded. At that time, the final song titles had not been chosen so they were often referred to by the following working titles, some of which continued to be used internally by the band, including on their live set lists:
* &quot;Triplet&quot; – &quot;Caffeine&quot;
* &quot;Madonna&quot; – &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot;
* &quot;Macaroni and Cheese&quot;, &quot;Country Western Song&quot; – &quot;RV&quot;
* &quot;Arabic&quot;, &quot;The Arabian Song&quot; – &quot;Smaller and Smaller&quot;
* &quot;F Sharp&quot; – &quot;Kindergarten&quot;
* &quot;I Swallow&quot; – &quot;Be Aggressive&quot;
* &quot;Japanese&quot; – &quot;A Small Victory&quot;
* &quot;Action Adventure&quot; – &quot;Crack Hitler&quot;
* &quot;The Sample Song&quot; – &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;
* &quot;The Carpenters Song&quot; – &quot;Everything&#x27;s Ruined&quot;
* &quot;The Funk Song&quot; – &quot;Land of Sunshine&quot;
* &quot;The Shuffle Song&quot;/&quot;Seagull Song&quot; – Unpublished recording.

While 13 tracks were released on the standard album, the sessions also produced a cover of the Commodores&#x27; &quot;Easy&quot;, a reworking of the previously recorded &quot;As the Worm Turns&quot;, and a song called &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;. In 1992-93, &quot;Easy&quot; and the re-recorded version of &quot;As the Worm Turns&quot; were both included on certain editions of &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, in addition to appearing on other releases such as EPs and singles. &quot;The World Is Yours&quot; was posthumously released on the band&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;Who Cares a Lot? The Greatest Hits&quot;, which came out in October 1998, six months after Faith No More&#x27;s original split. While the songs &quot;Das Schutzenfest&quot; and the Dead Kennedys cover &quot;Let&#x27;s Lynch the Landlord&quot; were both released along with &quot;Easy&quot; on an EP in late 1992, at least one of these songs was not actually recorded during the &quot;Angel Dust&quot; sessions: &quot;Let&#x27;s Lynch the Landlord&quot; was recorded in Bill Gould&#x27;s bedroom and produced by the band, prior to the &quot;Angel Dust&quot; sessions, for &quot;Virus 100&quot;, a Dead Kennedys tribute album. While it is unclear as to whether or not &quot;Das Schutzenfest&quot; is from the &quot;Angel Dust&quot; sessions, Matt Wallace is listed as the engineer for this song but is given no producer credit (in contrast with the co-producer credit he is given for &quot;Angel Dust&quot;).

When the album was being written in 1991, the band went on a month-long tour of Argentina, Brazil and Japan, where they debuted early versions of &quot;The World Is Yours,&quot; &quot;RV,&quot; and &quot;Caffeine&quot;. This run of shows occurred between August and October 1991, and ended with a single show in Oakland, California on October 12, 1991, as part of the Day on the Green festival. The first performances of &quot;The World Is Yours&quot; and &quot;RV&quot; came during an August 31, 1991 concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and the two songs would go on to be played several more times during the mini-tour, with &quot;Caffeine&quot; added during the tour. The other songs from the &quot;Angel Dust&quot; sessions only started being performed live in 1992. To date, the 1991 performances of &quot;The World Is Yours&quot; remain the only times the song is known to have been played live.

===Samples===
There were many samples used on &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, to the point that it was called a &quot;gratuitous&quot; amount and record label executives were concerned about the volume of samples used. They came from such sources as Simon and Garfunkel, Diamanda Galás, Z&#x27;EV, and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The Simon and Garfunkel sample is from the first bar of their song &quot;Cecilia&quot; and appears throughout the drum track of &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot;. &quot;Malpractice&quot; contains a four-second sample of the second movement of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;String Quartet No. 8&quot; as performed by the Kronos Quartet, on their album &quot;Black Angels&quot;; track 8, &quot;Allegro molto&quot;, at 2:10. It features in four points towards the end of the song at 2:56, 3:02, 3:22 and 3:26. Many of the original samples used in the songs were recorded by Roddy on a Digital Audio Tape recorder whilst &quot;just whilst wandering out and about&quot;. &quot;Crack Hitler&quot;, as well as featuring samples of sirens in the background, features a sample in the intro of Iris Lettieri reading a flight announcement at the Rio de Janeiro-Galeão International Airport. She then tried to sue the band for using her voice without permission. There are also samples of aboriginal chanting, amongst the sound effects from Sound Ideas, in the background of &quot;Smaller and Smaller&quot;. Also, a brief succession of sounds, including a police car siren and a warp noise, similar to what Frank Zappa abundantly made use of on his album &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; is recognizable in the song &quot;A Small Victory&quot;. The song &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot; contains a sample of &quot;Car Thief&quot; by the Beastie Boys. The intro of &quot;Caffeine&quot; features sounds of animals, of which monkeys and a wolf can be distinguished. The B-side &quot;The World Is Yours&quot; by far featured the most samples of any songs, and was even referred to as &quot;The Sample Song&quot; by the band. The intro alone features a death sentence by rapid fire (the words &quot;Aim. Fire!&quot; can be heard), and an elephant. The bridge of the song includes a recording of Budd Dwyer&#x27;s suicide that was broadcast on TV in 1987.

&quot;Be Aggressive&quot; has cheerleaders chanting the song title throughout the verses. These chants were made specifically for the album, rather than being samples, and featured four 15 to 17 year old cheerleaders (who performed the song live with the band in 1992). The chants were meant to resemble cheerleaders cheering on a football team, even though the protagonist in the song is someone performing oral sex. Some would later note similarities between &quot;Be Aggressive&quot; and Marilyn Manson&#x27;s 2003 song &quot;mOBSCENE&quot;, which had cheerleaders repeatedly chanting &quot;Be Obscene&quot;.

==Touring and support==
Faith No More started the tour to promote &quot;Angel Dust&quot; shortly after the album&#x27;s completion on the European leg of the Use Your Illusion Tour with Guns N&#x27; Roses and Soundgarden, which Bottum described as a &quot;complete European vacation&quot; due to their light concert schedule. In an interview taken on June 6, 1992, Billy said: 
They continued on this tour through the North America leg with Guns N&#x27; Roses and Metallica before splitting off on their own European tour through Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, seven performances from November 4–11 in Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, 3 more performances in Germany, Belgium, Germany again, the Netherlands, Wales, England, where they played at the Cambridge Corn Exchange on November 23 then three nights straight at the Brixton Academy from November 25–27 and on the following night at the NEC Arena in Birmingham before going through Ireland, Scotland, where they played the first 4 nights of December in the Barrowland Ballroom before going back through England, Belgium, 3 performances from the December 8–10 in France, 3 performances from the December 12–14 in Spain, France again, Italy, Switzerland and Austria again before having a break for Christmas and New Year. They began touring America again in mid January 1993 in Seattle, Washington, and finishing in Utah a month later in mid February.

From April to May 1993, the band embarked on a run of shows in the Pacific, first playing in Honolulu, Hawaii, and then on the islands of Guam and Saipan (which is part of the Northern Mariana Islands). These run of concerts concluded with a four show tour of Japan, a thirteen show tour of Australia and a two show tour of New Zealand (that was later extended to five shows). The Australian tour covered seven of the eight states and territories in the country, including the island state of Tasmania. The only state/territory that wasn&#x27;t covered in the Australian tour was the remote Northern Territory. Following the performances in these countries, the band was going to tour Singapore, Hong Kong, and Indonesia in mid-May 1993, but cancelled these planned shows and instead did another three concerts on New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. While in Guam during April 1993, Gould remembered that they went to a military bar that was showing hardcore pornography on the televisions, saying that later this bar started playing a karaoke version of &quot;I Started a Joke&quot;, by British-Australian group the Bee Gees. A few years later, Faith No More released a studio cover of &quot;I Started a Joke&quot;, with Gould claiming that the experience in Guam had inspired them to record the cover. He recalled in 2015, &quot;it was like God speaking to us: &#x27;You have to do this song.&#x27;&quot;

The band returned to Europe for a show in Germany on May 29 and the following day in Vienna then in Budapest. On June 2 they played at Rotterdam Ahoy followed by 4 performances in Germany from June 3–7 and one in Slovakia on June 10. Towards the end of June they performed on individual nights in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Portugal then a few days later on July 3–4 in Torhout and Werchter, Belgium followed by one last show in Germany, on July 9, and a headline show at Ruisrock Festival in Turku, Finland July 10 before the final show of the tour in Stratford Upon Avon on July 17. The band had planned to tour Peru, Brazil and Venezuela in August 1993, but these dates were cancelled due to issues with Jim Martin.

===Live performances and setlists===
Despite reportedly being unhappy with the band&#x27;s change in direction on &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, Martin has since claimed that he was pleased with their live performances on the &quot;Angel Dust&quot; tour. He said in 2012, &quot;live performances were always very strong. From my perspective, we came across a lot heavier than the records. Over time, the chord progressions and the arrangements would morph in subtle ways that would make the set heavier than the studio version.&quot;

The songs &quot;Malpractice&quot; and &quot;Smaller and Smaller&quot; were rarely or never played on the &quot;Angel Dust&quot; tour and subsequent tours. &quot;Malpractice&quot; would be performed a few times during the band&#x27;s Second Coming Tour in 2009, before again being dropped from their setlist in following years. It has been claimed that &quot;Malpractice&quot; and &quot;Smaller and Smaller&quot; were both performed twice on the &quot;Angel Dust&quot; tour, although the details of these performances are in question, and no live recordings have ever surfaced. In a 2012 interview, Gould stated that they didn&#x27;t perform &quot;Smaller and Smaller&quot; since it was mid-tempo in nature, and having too many of those types of songs in their setlist would make their shows &quot;boring&quot;. Gould said, &quot;for some reason or another, we tend to gravitate towards what is called &#x27;mid-tempo&#x27; in our writing... In other words, songs that are not fast, but not exactly ballads either.&quot; He added that, &quot;&#x27;Smaller and Smaller&#x27; while pretty grandiose in concept, always felt too long and too plodding to even consider doing live. And truth be told, we were never quite as attached to that one as some of the others.&quot;

During the tour, the band covered snippets of various songs, including &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; by En Vogue, &quot;The Goin&#x27; Gets Tough From the Getgo&quot; by Ween, &quot;Life is a Highway&quot; by Tom Cochrane, &quot;Mistadobalina&quot; by Del tha Funky Homosapien, &quot;Warm It Up&quot; by Kris Kross and &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Patton would later do a full cover of &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; with his other band Mr. Bungle, as part of a 1999 Halloween concert parodying the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

==Critical reception and legacy==
&quot;Angel Dust&quot; was met with extensive critical acclaim. One critic wrote that the album is &quot;one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label&quot; and similarly, another called it &quot;the most uncommercial follow-up to a hit record ever&quot;. After hearing the album, the band&#x27;s label warned them that releasing the album would be &quot;commercial suicide&quot;. The single &quot;A Small Victory&quot; is described as a song &quot;which seems to run Madame Butterfly through Metallica and Nile Rodgers, reveals a developing facility for combining unlikely elements into startlingly original concoctions&quot;.

The songs &quot;Malpractice&quot; and &quot;Jizzlobber&quot; have been called &quot;art-damaged death metal&quot; and &quot;nerve-frazzling apocalyptic rock&quot; by contrast with the &quot;accordion-propelled&quot; &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; theme cover that follows. AllMusic calls the album a &quot;bizarro masterpiece&quot;, citing the vocals as &quot;smarter and more accomplished&quot; than its predecessor &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. It gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it one of their album picks. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; was less enthusiastic, considering &quot;Angel Dust&quot;&#x27;s variety of styles &quot;a personality disorder, of sorts, which undermines its potential greatness.&quot; In 1992, &quot;Spin&quot; commented that &quot;there are slow, scary songs, and not as much funk-metal thrash as the average fan would expect.&quot;

The album was also called an &quot;Album of the Year&quot; in 1992 by seven different publications in four countries, making the top 10 in three of them and the top position in one, and was also named the &quot;Most Influential Album of all Time&quot; by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; despite an initially lukewarm review. Brad Filicky of &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; praised the album in 2003, reflecting, &quot;Faith No More was often lumped in with the funk metal masses that were so popular in the early 90s, but after the success of &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, the group&#x27;s first album with Mike Patton, FNM grew tired of the trappings and limitations of the genre. So, rather than release that era&#x27;s equivalent of &quot;Significant Other&quot;, the band flipped the script entirely and dropped an experimental bombshell on the scene.&quot; The 2009 book &quot;Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal&quot; describes the album as &quot;a notoriously difficult album to listen to aside from the radio-friendly cover of the Commodores&#x27; &#x27;Easy&#x27;.&quot;

In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Angel Dust&quot; as 65th on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In a 2018 &quot;Louder Sound&quot; article, Hoobastank singer Doug Robb listed it as one of the ten albums that changed his life. Oceansize frontman Mike Vennart has also named it one of the albums that changed his life. Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance labelled it as a &quot;glorious record&quot; in 2016. In March 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album&#x27;s second track, &quot;Caffeine&quot;, at number 55 on their &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of All Time&quot; list. Alex Tefler of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; refers to &quot;Angel Dust&quot; as &quot;one of the most deliriously strange records ever to appear on a major label.&quot;

<text>The Kanun (also , other names include ) is a set of Albanian traditional customary laws, which has directed all the aspects of the Albanian tribal society.

For at least the last five centuries and until today, Albanian customary laws have been kept alive only orally by the tribal elders. The success in preserving them exclusively through oral systems is an indication of ancient origins. Strong pre-Christian motifs mixed with motifs from the Christian era reflect the stratification of the Albanian customary law across various historical ages. The Kanun has held a sacred – although secular – longstanding, unwavering and unchallenged authority with a cross-religious effectiveness over the Albanians, which is attributed to an earlier pagan code common to all the Albanian tribes. The Albanian &quot;Kanun&quot; is regarded as a literary monument that is of interest to Indo-European studies, reflecting many legal practices of great antiquity that find precise echoes in law codes followed by other Indo-European peoples, potentially inherited from the Proto-Indo-European culture.

Over time, Albanian customary laws have undergone their historical development, they have been changed and supplemented with new norms, in accordance with certain requirements of socio-economic development. &quot;Besa&quot; and &quot;nderi&quot; (honour) are of major importance in Albanian customary law as the cornerstone of personal and social conduct.

The first known codification of Albanian oral customary law was published by the Ottoman administration in the 19th century. Several regional Albanian customary laws have been collected and published during the 20th and 21st centuries, including &quot;The Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini&quot;, &quot;The Kanun of Skanderbeg&quot; and &quot;The Kanun of Labëria&quot;. During the years of the communist regime, the Albanian state abolished by law the customary practices. However their exercise returned after the 1990s as a result of the collapse of state institutions in Albania and in Kosovo. In Albania, in particular, the exercise of customary law was observed especially in matters related to property law.

==Name==
The term &quot;kanun&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;&quot; (&quot;canon&quot;), meaning amongst others &quot;pole&quot; or &quot;rule&quot; and was transported from Greek to Arabic and then into early Turkish. The term must have been divulgated during the Ottoman rule. It was so widely used among Albanians that when something was legal it was said to be &quot;kanun&quot;, and when not legal, &quot;the kanun doesn&#x27;t give it&quot;. The consuetudinary law was called &quot;kanun&quot;. Baroness Von Godin thought it was the Ottomans that gave the name &quot;kanun&quot; and that the Albanian name &quot;Lek&quot; (Latin lex) was only later perceived as a proper name attributed to late Medieval nobleman of the Dukagjini family.

Aside from the term &quot;kanun&quot; other words of Turkish extract were used (usull, itifak, adet, ) or in the Albanian periphrase &quot;rrugë&quot; or &quot;udhë&quot; (way or path). In Martanesh and Çermenikë it was known as &quot;kanun&quot;, in Toskëria it was known as &quot;The Kanun of the Adet&quot;, in Labëria &quot;The sharte of Idriz Suli&quot;, in the Bregu district &quot;Venomet e Himarës.&quot; but in Dibër, Kurbin, Bendë and Tamadhe it was called &quot;zakon&quot; (from slavonic &quot;законъ&quot;).
According to Çabej, Camaj and Schmidt-Neke, the oldest Albanian word by which the customary law was known was &quot;doke&quot;, meaning &quot;custom&quot;, &quot;usance&quot;, &quot;tradition&quot; in Albanian.

== Origin ==
The Albanian customary law is among the Albanian literary monuments that are of interest to Indo-European studies, reflecting many legal practices of great antiquity that are shared with law codes followed by other Indo-European peoples, potentially inherited from the Proto-Indo-European culture. It has been pointed out that &quot;The laws governing such matters as hospitality, the rights of the heads of households, marriage, blood-feuds and payment of damages find precise echoes in Vedic India and ancient Greece and Rome&quot;.

The stratification of the Albanian oral customary law across the various historical eras is reflected in its powerful pre-Christian motifs mixed with motifs from the Christian era. The Albanian &quot;Kanun&quot; contains several customary concepts that have their origins in pagan beliefs, including in particular the ancestor worship, animism and totemism, which have been preserved since ancient times. Comparing the Albanian Kanun of the Mountains with the Iliad and the Odyssey, the Japanese scholar Kazuhiko Yamamoto has concluded that the basic ethical concepts of the stateless social structure of the Homeric Age — &#x27;faith&#x27;, &#x27;honor&#x27;, &#x27;blood&#x27;, &#x27;revenge&#x27;, &#x27;food&#x27;, and &#x27;guest&#x27; — are the same customary concepts of the Albanian tribal society. British anthropologist and writer Edith Durham has suggested that the Albanian Kanun likely dates back to the Bronze Age culture. Others further have conjectured that it may be the continuation of ancient Illyrian tribal laws.

Over time, Albanian customary laws have undergone their historical development, they have been changed and supplemented with new norms, in accordance with certain requirements of socio-economic development emerged throughout the ages: Classical antiquity, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman periods. Some scholars have defined the Albanian &quot;Kanun&quot; as a set of traditions which are more or less ancient and widespread in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean area, however it should be considered independently as a &quot;customary code and a normative heritage&quot; of a people who, on the basis of their own social sense, have created a legal system that was autonomous from the law enforced by the various conquerors. In other words, it can be defined as a &#x27;constitution&#x27; of a stateless social system.

For at least the last five centuries and until today, the Kanun has been kept alive only orally by Albanian tribal elders. The success in preserving them exclusively through oral systems is an indication of ancient origins. In his codification of the &quot;Kanun&quot; Shtjefën Gjeçovi added footnotes in reference to the Roman law, and an earlier indigenous legal system that survived the Roman occupation can be seen in the &quot;doke&quot;.

==History==
Albanian customs have been handed down through traditional memory systems that have survived intact into modern times in Albania, a phenomenon that is explained by the lack of state formation among Albanians and their ancestors – the Illyrians, being able to preserve their &quot;tribally&quot; organized society. This distinguished them from civilizations such as Ancient Egypt, Minoans and Mycenaeans, who underwent state formation and disrupted their traditional memory practices. According to some historical sources, the government of the Roman and Byzantine empire had to recognize autonomous customary laws to the various local communities for their self-administration. In this context, during different periods, Albanian customary laws were implemented in parallel with Roman, Byzantine, Ecclesiastic, and subsequently Sharia and Ottoman laws. This helped the Albanian mountain tribes to preserve their way of life, identity, and neutrality in the face of external centralizing administration.

In the context of religious perceptions, historical sources confirm the relations between the Greco-Roman religious ethics and the Albanian customary laws. These relations can be seen during the rule of the Illyrian emperors, such as Aurelian who introduced the cult of the Sun; Diocletian who stabilized the empire and ensured its continuation through the institution of the Tetrarchy; Constantine the Great who issued the Edict of Toleration for the Christianized population and who summoned the First Council of Nicaea involving many clercs from Illyricum; Justinian who issued the Corpus Juris Civilis and sought to create an Illyrian Church, building Justiniana Prima and Justiniana Secunda, which was intended to become the centre of Byzantine administration.

The Byzantine Empire ruled over Albanians for a long period of time, exercising with its institutions influence on the Albanians as well as on other Balkan ethnicities such as the Serbs. Some influence from Serbian medieval law might have reached Northern Albanian customary law through Montenegro and Herzegovina, as the latter seem to show traces of Serbian medieval law. Albanians and Montenegrins have experienced very strong mutual influences on customary law, religious life and cultural life, and also Albanians, Serbs and Macedonians have experienced mutual influences, albeit to a lesser extent.

In the late Middle Ages Albanian cities codified statutes that included regulations from ancient local customary laws, developing their own legal tradition and achieving a form of local self-administration. In the &quot;Statutes of Scutari&quot; the verb &quot;bessare&quot; is thought to be a trace of Old Albanian, thence viewed as in relation to an early evidence of the Albanian institution of &quot;Besa&quot;. Historical sources from Ragusa mention &quot;the Albanian customs of the Balsha&quot;. It has been argued that an article in &quot;Dušan&#x27;s Code&quot; can be considered speculatively as an early attempt to clamp down on the self-administered Albanian customary law of the mountains, and if so, this would be an early evidence that such customary laws were in effect. Soon after the institution of &quot;Dušan&#x27;s Code&quot; in Albanian life, the Ottomans conquered large parts of the Balkans, and instead of &quot;Dušan&#x27;s Code&quot; customary law and several other patriarchal structures of social organisation were thereafter revived, in particular among the Albanians.

In 1492, the Sublime Porte officially recognized Himara its own customary law () for self-government, as it was the center of the Labëria uprisings against the Ottoman Empire. When the Ottoman administration became acquainted with the social organization of the Albanian lands, around 1550 they mentioned the local customary law as &quot;Canun of the Mountains&quot; (). In the 17th century an anonymous prepared a study in the Venetian language: &quot;Informazioni sopra origine e metodo delle arbitrarie in affari di sangue in Albania (sec. XVIII) interessante pei costumi (Reale Archivio Generale, Cancelleria Secreta, Cattaro e popolazioni confinarie)&quot; (Information on the origin and method of arbitration in the matter of blood-taking in Albania), addressed to the Republic of Venice in order to harmonize the state laws of Venice with the &quot;Kanun&quot; of the Albanians in the area from Kotor to Shkodra where the rule of the Venetian administration extended. The Venetian Senate did not approve the study because no other law was to be recognized in its provinces. In the same century, some English travelers who visited Himara wrote about a strong customary law implemented by the local population.

In his autonomous Pashalik, the Albanian ruler Ali Pasha enforced his own laws in addition to the Sharia for Muslims and Canon law for Christians, allowing only in rare cases the usage of local Albanian tribal customary laws. After annexing Suli and Himara into his semi-independent state in 1798, he sought to organize the judiciary in every city and province according to the principle of social equality, enforcing his laws for the entire population, both Muslims and Christians. To limit blood feud killings, Ali Pasha replaced blood feuds (Albanian: &quot;gjakmarrje&quot;) with other punishments such as blood payment or expulsion up to the death penalty. Ali Pasha also reached an agreement with the Kurveleshi population, not to trespass their territories, which at that time were larger than the area they inhabit today. Since the 18th century and continuously, blood feuds and their consequences in Labëria have been limited principally by the councils of elders. The mountain region of Kurveleshi represents the last example of a tribal system among southern Albanians, which was regulated by the &quot;Code of Zuli&quot; (Albanian: &quot;Kanuni i Papa Zhulit/Zulit&quot; or &quot;Kanuni i Idriz Sulit&quot;).

During the Tanzimat and the implementation of reforms, the Ottoman administration, in order to address the Albanian customary law which has been implemented along with the Ottoman law and Sharia, opened an office called &quot;Shkodra Mountains Commission&quot; (Turkish: &quot;Iskodra Xhibali Komisi&quot;), which was established in 1856–1858, based in Shkodra and with administrative and judicial power over the provinces. The Commission embodied the centralized attitudes of the imperial reforms and the approach it would have with local customary law in the bajrak areas and relied mainly on the &quot;Kanun of the Mountains&quot; (Turkish: &quot;Kanun-i Jhibal&quot;) with some Ottoman administrative element. In 1863 the bylykbashi of Gruda sent a letter to the sergeant asking for the &quot;Kanun-i Jhibal&quot;, giving reason to believe that a codification in Ottoman Turkish already existed. Parts of this codification have been published in twenty paragraphs in the salname of the Vilayet of Shkodra in 1894, which were published translated into Italian and French. The most important elements for the relationship between the Ottoman administration and the local population were: murder, blood feud, reconciliation, blood money, hospitality, theft, and tribal disputes.

== Development and usage ==
The Kanun of Lek Dukagjini was named after Lekë Dukagjini, a medieval prince who ruled in northern Albania and codified the customary laws of the highlands. The code was written down in the 19th century by Shtjefën Gjeçovi and partially published in the &quot;Hylli i Drites&quot; periodical in 1913. The full version appeared only in 1933 after Gjeçovi&#x27;s death in 1926.

Although researchers of history and customs of Albania usually refer to Gjeçovi&#x27;s text of the Kanuni as the only existing version which is uncontested and written by Lekë Dukagjini, it was actually incorrect. The text of the Kanuni, often contested and with many different interpretations which significantly evolved since 15th century, was codified and only named by Dukagjini.

Although the laws are attributed to Lekë Dukagjini, the laws evolved over time as a way to bring order to these lands. The Kanun is divided into 12 sections, and Gjeçovi&#x27;s version has 1,262 articles regulating all aspects of the mountainous life: economic organisation of the household, hospitality, brotherhood, clan, boundaries, work, marriage, land, and so on. The &quot;Besa&quot; (personal honour, compare with Lat. &quot;fides&quot;) and nderi (family honour, Lat. &quot;honor&quot;) are of prime importance throughout the code as the cornerstone of personal and social conduct. The Kanun applies to both Christian and Muslim Albanians.

Some of the Kanun&#x27;s most controversial rules (in particular book 10 section 3) specify how murder is to be handled, which in the past (and sometimes still now) would lead to blood feuds lasting until all men of the two involved families were killed. In situations of murder, tribal law stipulates the principle of &quot;koka për kokë&quot; (head for a head) where the relatives of the victim are obliged to seek &quot;gjakmarrja&quot; (blood vengeance). Regarded simply as producers of offspring, women are referred to in a discriminatory manner and not considered worthy targets as such. In some parts of the country, the Kanun resembles the Italian vendetta. These rules resurfaced in the 1990s in Northern Albania, as people had no faith in the powerless local government and police. There are organizations that try to mediate between feuding families and try to get them to &quot;pardon the blood&quot; (), but often the only resort is for men of age to stay in their homes, which are considered a safe refuge by the Kanuni, or flee the country. Tribal laws also held that thieves would need to pay fines for the relative amount that was stolen.

Albanian tribes from the Dibra region (known as the &quot;Tigers of Dibra&quot;) governed themselves according to the Law of Skanderbeg.

The Albanian Bytyqi, Gashi, Gruda, Trieshi, Hoti, Kastrati, Kelmendi, Krasniqi, Shkrel, and Kuçi tribes are known to follow the &quot;Kanuni i Malësisë së Madhë&quot;, a variant of the Kanun. Its implementation extends from these tribal regions around Shkodër to the Highlands of Gjakova.

Former communist leader of Albania Enver Hoxha effectively stopped the practice of Kanun with hard repression and a strong state police. After Communism&#x27;s fall some communities, however, have tried to rediscover the old traditions, but some of their parts have been lost, leading to fears of misinterpretation. In 2014, about 3,000 Albanian families were estimated to be involved in blood feuds; since the fall of Communism this has led to the deaths of 10,000 people. There is extensive debate on the number of blood feuds and deaths in the present day, a major factor being the use of blood feuds in asylum applications. Cedoca reported in 2017 that, according to Albanian State Police Headquarters, from 2013 to March 2017, there were five deaths related to blood feuds; that said, the British embassy in Tirana claims that police &#x27;tend to estimate the lowest numbers&#x27; when reporting the population involved in blood feuds. Albanian Daily News reported in 2018 that one man had died due to a blood feud.

==Codifications==
The first known codification of Albanian oral customary law is &quot;Lek Dukagin Kanunu&quot; (&quot;The Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini&quot;) by the Ottoman administration, published in 1872 in Prizren, and written in Ottoman Turkish. Albanian oral customary laws have been collected in different regions and published during the 20th and 21st centuries:
*The Old Kanun (Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini) ();
**The Kanun of Mirdita ();
**The Kanun of Pukë ();
*The Kanun of Skanderbeg () also known as The Kanun of Arbëria ().
**The Kanun of Dibra ();
*The Kanun of Çermenikë ();
*The Kanun of Labëria (), also known as The Kanun of Papa Zhuli (&quot;Kanuni i Papa Zhulit&quot;) or Kanun of Idriz Suli (&quot;Kanuni i Idriz Sulit&quot;).

==Translations==
German Baroness Marie Amelie von Godin, in collaboration with Eqrem Vlora, at the request of the Franciscans, started from the year 1938 the systematic translation in German of the &quot;Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini&quot; on the basis of an earlier codification in Albanian by Gjeçovi. It was published in the 1950s, shortly before the author&#x27;s death. Von Godin&#x27;s work was republished in 2001, edited by Robert Elsie with an introduction by Michael Schmidt-Neke. An Italian translation of the &quot;Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini&quot; was published in 1941, translated by the Franciscan Pal Dodaj, and edited by Gjergj Fishta and Giuseppe Schirò, with the introduction by Federico Pateta, and republished in 2009 with the introduction by Donato Martucci. A dual English-Albanian version of the &quot;Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini&quot; was published in 1989, and then republished in 1992. An Italian translation of the &quot;Kanun of Skanderbeg&quot; was published in 2017, translated by Genc Lafe and edited by Donato Martucci.

== Content ==
The Kanun is based on four pillars:
* Honour ()
* Hospitality ()
* Right Conduct ()
* Kin Loyalty ()

The &quot;Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini&quot; is composed of 12 books and 1,262 articles. The books and their subdivisions are as follows:
==Kanun in literature and film==
Albanian writer Ismail Kadare evokes the Kanun several times in his books, and it is the main theme in his novel Broken April. He also evokes the kanun in his novel (), where Kadare literally describes the Monastir massacre of 1830 as the struggle between two empires: the Albanian Kanun with its code of &quot;besa&quot; and the Ottoman Empire itself. According to Kadare in his literary critique book (), where &quot;loser&quot; refers to the great number of tragedies that were lost from Aeschylus, there are evident similarities between the &quot;kanun&quot; and the vendetta customs in all Mediterranean countries.

Barbara Nadel&#x27;s &quot;Deep Waters&quot; refers to Kanun and Gjakmarrja.

Joshua Marston&#x27;s 2011 film The Forgiveness of Blood, a drama set in modern-day Albania, deals with the Kanun. The film relates a blood feud between two families in Northern Albania, focusing primarily on how the feud affects the children of one family.

In season 6, episode 9 of Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent (&quot;Blasters&quot;) the Kanun is referred to as explanation for the sudden retreat of a group of Albanian assassins.

The Kanun plays a major role in the Belgian movie Dossier K.

Elvira Dones&#x27; &quot;Sworn Virgin&quot; refers to Kanun and women&#x27;s practice of swearing celibacy in return for being accepted as men by all local villagers.

Belgian TV maker Tom Waes visited Albania during one of the shows in his series Reizen Waes. He was served spit-roasted goat and was offered the goat&#x27;s head, in keeping with Kanun rules about honoring a guest at dinner.

The Kanun is referred to in &quot;The Closer&quot;; Season 6 | Episode 14: &quot;The investigation into the Albanian blood feud&quot;.

<text>Isadore Manuel Singer (May 3, 1924 – February 11, 2021) was an American mathematician. He was an Emeritus Institute Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.

Singer is noted for his work with Michael Atiyah, proving the Atiyah–Singer index theorem in 1962, which paved the way for new interactions between pure mathematics and theoretical physics. In early 1980s, while a professor at Berkeley, Singer co-founded the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) with Shiing-Shen Chern and Calvin Moore.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Singer was born on May 3, 1924, in Detroit, Michigan, to Polish Jewish immigrants. His father Simon was employed as a printer and only spoke Yiddish, and his mother, Freda (Rosemaity), worked as a seamstress. Singer learned English swiftly and subsequently taught it to the rest of his family.

Singer studied physics at the University of Michigan, graduating in 1944 after just two-and-a-half years so that he could join the military. He was stationed in the US Army in the Philippines, where he was a radar officer. During the daytime, he operated a communications school for the Philippine Army. He undertook correspondence courses in mathematics at night in order to satisfy the prerequisites for relativity and quantum mechanics. Upon his return from military service, Singer studied mathematics for one year at the University of Chicago. Although he initially intended to go back to physics, his interest in math was piqued, and he continued with the subject, earning an M.S. in Mathematics in 1948 and a Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1950 under the supervision of Irving Segal.

===Career===
Singer held a postdoctoral fellowship as a CLE Moore instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1950. After appointments at the University of California, Los Angeles, Columbia University, and Princeton University, he returned to MIT as a professor in 1956 and was appointed as the Norbert Wiener Professor from 1970 to 1979. In 1979, he moved to the University of California, Berkeley as Miller Professor. He returned to MIT in 1983 as the first John D. MacArthur Professor, before being appointed as an Institute Professor in 1987.

Singer was chair of the Committee of Science &amp; Public Policy of the United States National Academy of Sciences, a member of the White House Science Council (1982–88), and on the Governing Board of the United States National Research Council (1995–99). He was one of the founders of the independent non-profit Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, based in Berkeley, California.

Singer died on February 11, 2021, at his home in Boxborough, Massachusetts. He was 96.

==Research==
Partnering with British-Lebanese mathematician Michael Atiyah, Singer created a linkage between the fields of analysis, especially differential equations, and topology. In particular, they resolved a conjecture of Israel Gelfand&#x27;s on how topological constructs could count the number of solutions of differential equations. The Atiyah–Singer index theorem, as it is now known, opened a new field of mathematics called index theory. The development of their work made use of the Dirac operator, the general geometric construction of which was a notable new discovery. It is sometimes called the Atiyah–Singer operator in their honor. In discussions between mathematician Jim Simons and physicist Yang Chen-Ning in the 1970s, it was found that the Atiyah–Singer theorem has a number of applications to physics.

With Richard V. Kadison, he proposed the Kadison–Singer problem in 1959, Inspired by quantum mechanics, it turned out to have reformulations in engineering and computer science. It was finally proved in 2013.

Singer also developed analytic torsion with D.B. Ray and with Henry McKean introduced heat equation formulae to the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. Singer&#x27;s other notable contributions in mathematics include the Ambrose–Singer holonomy theorem and the McKean–Singer theorem.

==Awards and honors==
Singer was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

Among the awards he has received are the Bôcher Memorial Prize (1969) from the American Mathematical Society, the National Medal of Science (1983), the Eugene Wigner Medal (1988), the Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement (2000) from the American Mathematical Society, the Abel Prize (2004) shared with Michael Atiyah, the 2004 Gauss Lecture and the James Rhyne Killian Faculty Achievement Award from MIT (2005).

==Personal life==
Singer&#x27;s first marriage was to Sheila Ruff, a play therapist for disabled children; they later divorced. His second marriage was to Rosemarie Singer, and they remained married until his death. He had five children: Stephen (born visually impaired), Eliot, and Natasha (with Sheila); Emily, and Annabelle (with Rosemarie). Singer&#x27;s brother Sidney was a particle physicist with Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and predeceased him in 2016.

<text>Academic publishing is the subfield of publishing which distributes academic research and scholarship. Most academic work is published in academic journal articles, books or theses. The part of academic written output that is not formally published but merely printed up or posted on the Internet is often called &quot;grey literature&quot;. Most scientific and scholarly journals, and many academic and scholarly books, though not all, are based on some form of peer review or editorial refereeing to qualify texts for publication. Peer review quality and selectivity standards vary greatly from journal to journal, publisher to publisher, and field to field.

Most established academic disciplines have their own journals and other outlets for publication, although many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. There is also a tendency for existing journals to divide into specialized sections as the field itself becomes more specialized. Along with the variation in review and publication procedures, the kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions to knowledge or research differ greatly among fields and subfields. In the sciences, the desire for statistically significant results leads to publication bias.

Academic publishing is undergoing major changes as it makes the transition from the print to the electronic format. Business models are different in the electronic environment. Since the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common. An important trend, particularly with respect to journals in the sciences, is open access via the Internet. In open access publishing, a journal article is made available free for all on the web by the publisher at the time of publication. 

Both open and closed journals are sometimes funded by the author paying an article processing charge, thereby shifting some fees from the reader to the researcher or their funder. Many open or closed journals fund their operations without such fees and others use them in predatory publishing. The Internet has facilitated open access self-archiving, in which authors themselves make a copy of their published articles available free for all on the web. Some important results in mathematics have been published only on arXiv.

==History==
The (later spelled ), established by Denis de Sallo, was the earliest academic journal published in Europe. Its content included obituaries of famous men, church history, and legal reports. The first issue appeared as a twelve-page quarto pamphlet on Monday, 5 January 1665, shortly before the first appearance of the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;, on 6 March 1665.

The publishing of academic journals has started in the 17th century, and expanded greatly in the 19th. At that time, the act of publishing academic inquiry was controversial and widely ridiculed. It was not at all unusual for a new discovery to be announced as a monograph, reserving priority for the discoverer, but indecipherable for anyone not in on the secret: both Isaac Newton and Leibniz used this approach. However, this method did not work well. Robert K. Merton, a sociologist, found that 92% of cases of simultaneous discovery in the 17th century ended in dispute. The number of disputes dropped to 72% in the 18th century, 59% by the latter half of the 19th century, and 33% by the first half of the 20th century. The decline in contested claims for priority in research discoveries can be credited to the increasing acceptance of the publication of papers in modern academic journals, with estimates suggesting that around 50 million journal articles have been published since the first appearance of the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;. The Royal Society was steadfast in its not-yet-popular belief that science could only move forward through a transparent and open exchange of ideas backed by experimental evidence.

Early scientific journals embraced several models: some were run by a single individual who exerted editorial control over the contents, often simply publishing extracts from colleagues&#x27; letters, while others employed a group decision-making process, more closely aligned to modern peer review. It was not until the middle of the 20th century that peer review became the standard.

The COVID-19 pandemic hijacked the entire world of basic and clinical science, with unprecedented shifts in funding priorities worldwide and a boom in medical publishing, accompanied by an unprecedented increase in the number of publications. Preprints servers become much popular during the pandemic, the Covid situation has an impact also on traditional peer-review. The pandemic has also deepened the western monopoly of science-publishing, &quot;by August 2021, at least 210,000 new papers on covid-19 had been published, according to a Royal Society study. Of the 720,000-odd authors of these papers, nearly 270,000 were from the US, the UK, Italy or Spain.&quot;

==Publishers and business aspects==
In the 1960s and 1970s, commercial publishers began to selectively acquire &quot;top-quality&quot; journals that were previously published by nonprofit academic societies. When the commercial publishers raised the subscription prices significantly, they lost little of the market, due to the inelastic demand for these journals. Although there are over 2,000 publishers, five for-profit companies (Reed Elsevier, Springer Science+Business Media, Wiley-Blackwell, Taylor &amp; Francis, and SAGE) accounted for 50% of articles published in 2013. (Since 2013, Springer Science+Business Media has undergone a merger to form an even bigger company named Springer Nature.) Available data indicate that these companies have profit margins of around 40% making it one of the most profitable industries, especially compared to the smaller publishers, which likely operate with low margins. These factors have contributed to the &quot;serials crisis&quot; – total expenditures on serials increased 7.6% per year from 1986 to 2005, yet the number of serials purchased increased an average of only 1.9% per year.

Unlike most industries, in academic publishing the two most important inputs are provided &quot;virtually free of charge&quot;. These are the articles and the peer review process. Publishers argue that they add value to the publishing process through support to the peer review group, including stipends, as well as through typesetting, printing, and web publishing. Investment analysts, however, have been skeptical of the value added by for-profit publishers, as exemplified by a 2005 Deutsche Bank analysis which stated that &quot;we believe the publisher adds relatively little value to the publishing process... We are simply observing that if the process really were as complex, costly and value-added as the publishers protest that it is, 40% margins wouldn&#x27;t be available.&quot;

===Crisis===
A crisis in academic publishing is &quot;widely perceived&quot;; the apparent crisis has to do with the combined pressure of budget cuts at universities and increased costs for journals (the serials crisis). The university budget cuts have reduced library budgets and reduced subsidies to university-affiliated publishers. The humanities have been particularly affected by the pressure on university publishers, which are less able to publish monographs when libraries can not afford to purchase them. For example, the ARL found that in &quot;1986, libraries spent 44% of their budgets on books compared with 56% on journals; twelve years later, the ratio had skewed to 28% and 72%.&quot; Meanwhile, monographs are increasingly expected for tenure in the humanities. In 2002 the Modern Language Association expressed hope that electronic publishing would solve the issue.

In 2009 and 2010, surveys and reports found that libraries faced continuing budget cuts, with one survey in 2009 finding that 36% of UK libraries had their budgets cut by 10% or more, compared to 29% with increased budgets. In the 2010s, libraries began more aggressive cost cutting with the leverage of open access and open data. Data analysis with open source tools like Unpaywall Journals empowered library systems in reducing their subscription costs by 70% with the cancellation of the big deal with publishers like Elsevier.

===Academic journal publishing reform===
Several models are being investigated, such as open publication models or adding community-oriented features.
It is also considered that &quot;Online scientific interaction outside the traditional journal space is becoming more and more important to academic communication&quot;. In addition, experts have suggested measures to make the publication process more efficient in disseminating new and important findings by evaluating the worthiness of publication on the basis of the significance and novelty of the research finding.

==Scholarly paper==
In academic publishing, a paper is an academic work that is usually published in an academic journal. It contains original research results or reviews existing results. Such a paper, also called an article, will only be considered valid if it undergoes a process of peer review by one or more &quot;referees&quot; (who are academics in the same field) who check that the content of the paper is suitable for publication in the journal. A paper may undergo a series of reviews, revisions, and re-submissions before finally being accepted or rejected for publication. This process typically takes several months. Next, there is often a delay of many months (or in some fields, over a year) before an accepted manuscript appears. This is particularly true for the most popular journals where the number of accepted articles often outnumbers the space for printing. Due to this, many academics self-archive a &#x27;preprint&#x27; or &#x27;postprint&#x27; copy of their paper for free download from their personal or institutional website.

===Categories of papers===
An academic paper typically belongs to some particular category such as:

* Concept paper
* Research paper
* Case report or Case series
* Position paper
* Review article or Survey paper
* Species paper
* Technical paper

Note: Law review is the generic term for a journal of legal scholarship in the United States, often operating by rules radically different from those for most other academic journals.

==Peer review==
Peer review is a central concept for most academic publishing; other scholars in a field must find a work sufficiently high in quality for it to merit publication. A secondary benefit of the process is an indirect guard against plagiarism since reviewers are usually familiar with the sources consulted by the author(s). The origins of routine peer review for submissions dates to 1752 when the Royal Society of London took over official responsibility for &quot;Philosophical Transactions.&quot; However, there were some earlier examples.

While journal editors largely agree the system is essential to quality control in terms of rejecting poor quality work, there have been examples of important results that are turned down by one journal before being taken to others. Rena Steinzor wrote:
&quot;Confirmatory bias&quot; is the unconscious tendency to accept reports which support the reviewer&#x27;s views and to downplay those which do not. Experimental studies show the problem exists in peer reviewing.

There are various types of peer review feedback that may be given prior to publication, including but not limited to:
*Single-blind peer review
*Double-blind peer review
*Open peer review

=== Rejection rate ===
The possibility of rejections of papers is an important aspect in peer review. The evaluation of quality of journals is based also on &quot;rejection rate&quot;. The best journals have the highest rejection rates (around 90–95%). American Psychological Association journals&#x27; rejection rates ranged &quot;from a low of 35 per cent to a high of 85 per cent.&quot;
The complement is called &quot;acceptance rate&quot;.

==Publishing process==
The process of academic publishing, which begins when authors submit a manuscript to a publisher, is divided into two distinct phases: peer review and production.

The process of peer review is organized by the journal editor and is complete when the content of the article, together with any associated images, data, and supplementary material are accepted for publication. The peer review process is increasingly managed online, through the use of proprietary systems, commercial software packages, or open source and free software. A manuscript undergoes one or more rounds of review; after each round, the author(s) of the article modify their submission in line with the reviewers&#x27; comments; this process is repeated until the editor is satisfied and the work is accepted.

The production process, controlled by a production editor or publisher, then takes an article through copy editing, typesetting, inclusion in a specific issue of a journal, and then printing and online publication. Academic copy editing seeks to ensure that an article conforms to the journal&#x27;s house style, that all of the referencing and labelling is correct, and that the text is consistent and legible; often this work involves substantive editing and negotiating with the authors. Because the work of academic copy editors can overlap with that of authors&#x27; editors, editors employed by journal publishers often refer to themselves as &quot;manuscript editors&quot;. During this process, copyright is often transferred from the author to the publisher.

In the late 20th century author-produced camera-ready copy has been replaced by electronic formats such as PDF. The author will review and correct proofs at one or more stages in the production process. The proof correction cycle has historically been labour-intensive as handwritten comments by authors and editors are manually transcribed by a proof reader onto a clean version of the proof. In the early 21st century, this process was streamlined by the introduction of e-annotations in Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, and other programs, but it still remained a time-consuming and error-prone process. The full automation of the proof correction cycles has only become possible with the onset of online collaborative writing platforms, such as Authorea, Google Docs, Overleaf, and various others, where a remote service oversees the copy-editing interactions of multiple authors and exposes them as explicit, actionable historic events. At the end of this process, a final version of record is published.

From time to time some published journal articles have been retracted for different reasons, including research misconduct.

==Citations==
Academic authors cite sources they have used, in order to support their assertions and arguments and to help readers find more information on the subject. It also gives credit to authors whose work they use and helps avoid plagiarism. The topic of dual publication (also known as self-plagiarism) has been addressed by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), as well as in the research literature itself.

Each scholarly journal uses a specific format for citations (also known as references). Among the most common formats used in research papers are the APA, CMS, and MLA styles.

The American Psychological Association (APA) style is often used in the social sciences. The Chicago Manual of Style (CMS) is used in business, communications, economics, and social sciences. The CMS style uses footnotes at the bottom of page to help readers locate the sources. The Modern Language Association (MLA) style is widely used in the humanities.

==Publishing by discipline==

===Natural sciences===
Scientific, technical, and medical (STM) literature is a large industry which generated $23.5 billion in revenue in 2011; $9.4 billion of that was specifically from the publication of English-language scholarly journals. The overall number of journals contained in the WOS database increased from around 8,500 in 2010 to around 9,400 in 2020, while the number of articles published increased from around 1.1 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2020.

Most scientific research is initially published in scientific journals and considered to be a primary source. Technical reports, for minor research results and engineering and design work (including computer software), round out the primary literature. Secondary sources in the sciences include articles in review journals (which provide a synthesis of research articles on a topic to highlight advances and new lines of research), and books for large projects, broad arguments, or compilations of articles. Tertiary sources might include encyclopedias and similar works intended for broad public consumption or academic libraries.

A partial exception to scientific publication practices is in many fields of applied science, particularly that of U.S. computer science research. An equally prestigious site of publication within U.S. computer science are some academic conferences. Reasons for this departure include a large number of such conferences, the quick pace of research progress, and computer science professional society support for the distribution and archiving of conference proceedings.

Since 2022, the Belgian web portal Cairn.info is open to STM.

===Social sciences===
Publishing in the social sciences is very different in different fields. Some fields, like economics, may have very &quot;hard&quot; or highly quantitative standards for publication, much like the natural sciences. Others, like anthropology or sociology, emphasize field work and reporting on first-hand observation as well as quantitative work. Some social science fields, such as public health or demography, have significant shared interests with professions like law and medicine, and scholars in these fields often also publish in professional magazines.

===Humanities===
Publishing in the humanities is in principle similar to publishing elsewhere in the academy; a range of journals, from general to extremely specialized, are available, and university presses issue many new humanities books every year. The arrival of online publishing opportunities has radically transformed the economics of the field and the shape of the future is controversial. Unlike science, where timeliness is critically important, humanities publications often take years to write and years more to publish. Unlike the sciences, research is most often an individual process and is seldom supported by large grants. Journals rarely make profits and are typically run by university departments.

The following describes the situation in the United States. In many fields, such as literature and history, several published articles are typically required for a first tenure-track job, and a published or forthcoming &quot;book&quot; is now often required before tenure. Some critics complain that this &quot;de facto&quot; system has emerged without thought to its consequences; they claim that the predictable result is the publication of much shoddy work, as well as unreasonable demands on the already limited research time of young scholars. To make matters worse, the circulation of many humanities journals in the 1990s declined to almost untenable levels, as many libraries cancelled subscriptions, leaving fewer and fewer peer-reviewed outlets for publication; and many humanities professors&#x27; first books sell only a few hundred copies, which often does not pay for the cost of their printing. Some scholars have called for a publication subvention of a few thousand dollars to be associated with each graduate student fellowship or new tenure-track hire, in order to alleviate the financial pressure on journals.

==Open access journals==
Under Open Access, the content can be freely accessed and reused by anyone in the world using an Internet connection. The terminology going back to Budapest Open Access Initiative, Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities, and Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing.
The impact of the work available as Open Access is maximised because, quoting the Library of Trinity College Dublin:

* Potential readership of Open Access material is far greater than that for publications where the full-text is restricted to subscribers. 
* Details of contents can be read by specialised web harvesters.
* Details of contents also appear in normal search engines like Google, Google Scholar, Yahoo, etc.

Open Access is often confused with specific funding models such as Article Processing Charges (APC) being paid by authors or their funders, sometimes misleadingly called &quot;open access model&quot;. The reason this term is misleading is due to the existence of many other models, including funding sources listed in the original the Budapest Open Access Initiative Declaration: &quot;the foundations and governments that fund research, the universities and laboratories that employ researchers, endowments set up by discipline or institution, friends of the cause of open access, profits from the sale of add-ons to the basic texts, funds freed up by the demise or cancellation of journals charging traditional subscription or access fees, or even contributions from the researchers themselves&quot;. For more recent open public discussion of open access funding models, see Flexible membership funding model for Open Access publishing with no author-facing charges.

Prestige journals using the APC model often charge several thousand dollars. Oxford University Press, with over 300 journals, has fees ranging from £1000-£2500, with discounts of 50% to 100% to authors from developing countries. Wiley Blackwell has 700 journals available, and they charge different amounts for each journal. Springer, with over 2600 journals, charges US$3000 or EUR 2200 (excluding VAT). A study found that the average APC (ensuring open access) was between $1,418 and US$2,727.

The online distribution of individual articles and academic journals then takes place without charge to readers and libraries. Most open access journals remove all the financial, technical, and legal barriers that limit access to academic materials to paying customers. The Public Library of Science and BioMed Central are prominent examples of this model.

Fee-based open access publishing has been criticized on quality grounds, as the desire to maximize publishing fees could cause some journals to relax the standard of peer review. Although, similar desire is also present in the subscription model, where publishers increase numbers or published articles in order to justify raising their fees. It may be criticized on financial grounds as well because the necessary publication or subscription fees have proven to be higher than originally expected. Open access advocates generally reply that because open access is as much based on peer reviewing as traditional publishing, the quality should be the same (recognizing that both traditional and open access journals have a range of quality). In several regions, including the Arab world, the majority of university academics prefer open access publishing without author fees, as it promotes equal access to information and enhances scientific advancement, a previously unexplored but crucial topic for the region&#x27;s higher education. It has also been argued that good science done by academic institutions who cannot afford to pay for open access might not get published at all, but most open access journals permit the waiver of the fee for financial hardship or authors in underdeveloped countries. In any case, all authors have the option of self-archiving their articles in their institutional repositories or disciplinary repositories in order to make them open access, whether or not they publish them in a journal.

If they publish in a Hybrid open access journal, authors or their funders pay a subscription journal a publication fee to make their individual article open access. The other articles in such hybrid journals are either made available after a delay or remain available only by subscription. Most traditional publishers (including Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford University Press, and Springer Science+Business Media) have already introduced such a hybrid option, and more are following. The fraction of the authors of a hybrid open access journal that makes use of its open access option can, however, be small. It also remains unclear whether this is practical in fields outside the sciences, where there is much less availability of outside funding. In 2006, several funding agencies, including the Wellcome Trust and several divisions of the Research Councils in the UK announced the availability of extra funding to their grantees for such open access journal publication fees.

In May 2016, the Council for the European Union agreed that from 2020 all scientific publications as a result of publicly funded research must be freely available. It also must be able to optimally reuse research data. To achieve that, the data must be made accessible, unless there are well-founded reasons for not doing so, for example, intellectual property rights or security or privacy issues.

==Growth==

In recent decades there has been a growth in academic publishing in developing countries as they become more advanced in science and technology. Although the large majority of scientific output and academic documents are produced in developed countries, the rate of growth in these countries has stabilized and is much smaller than the growth rate in some of the developing countries. The fastest scientific output growth rate over the last two decades has been in the Middle East and Asia with Iran leading with an 11-fold increase followed by the Republic of Korea, Turkey, Cyprus, China, and Oman. In comparison, the only G8 countries in top 20 ranking with fastest performance improvement are, Italy which stands at tenth and Canada at 13th globally.

By 2004, it was noted that the output of scientific papers originating from the European Union had a larger share of the world&#x27;s total from 36.6% to 39.3% and from 32.8% to 37.5% of the &quot;top one per cent of highly cited scientific papers&quot;. However, the United States&#x27; output dropped from 52.3% to 49.4% of the world&#x27;s total, and its portion of the top one percent dropped from 65.6% to 62.8%.

Iran, China, India, Brazil, and South Africa were the only developing countries among the 31 nations that produced 97.5% of the most cited scientific articles in a study published in 2004. The remaining 162 countries contributed less than 2.5%. The Royal Society in a 2011 report stated that in share of English scientific research papers the United States was first followed by China, the UK, Germany, Japan, France, and Canada. The report predicted that China would overtake the United States sometime before 2020, possibly as early as 2013. China&#x27;s scientific impact, as measured by other scientists citing the published papers the next year, is smaller although also increasing. Developing countries continue to find ways to improve their share, given research budget constraints and limited resources.

== Role for publishers in scholarly communication ==

There is increasing frustration amongst OA advocates, with what is perceived as resistance to change on the part of many of the established academic publishers. Publishers are often accused of capturing and monetising publicly funded research, using free academic labour for peer review, and then selling the resulting publications back to academia at inflated profits. Such frustrations sometimes spill over into hyperbole, of which &quot;publishers add no value&quot; is one of the most common examples.

However, scholarly publishing is not a simple process, and publishers do add value to scholarly communication as it is currently designed. Kent Anderson maintains a list of things that journal publishers do which currently contains 102 items and has yet to be formally contested from anyone who challenges the value of publishers. Many items on the list could be argued to be of value primarily to the publishers themselves, e.g. &quot;Make money and remain a constant in the system of scholarly output&quot;. However, others provide direct value to researchers and research in steering the academic literature. This includes arbitrating disputes (e.g. over ethics, authorship), stewarding the scholarly record, copy-editing, proofreading, type-setting, styling of materials, linking the articles to open and accessible datasets, and (perhaps most importantly) arranging and managing scholarly peer review. The latter is a task that should not be underestimated as it effectively entails coercing busy people into giving their time to improve someone else&#x27;s work and maintain the quality of the literature. Not to mention the standard management processes for large enterprises, including infrastructure, people, security, and marketing. All of these factors contribute in one way or another to maintaining the scholarly record.

It could be questioned though, whether these functions are actually necessary to the core aim of scholarly communication, namely, dissemination of research to researchers and other stakeholders such as policy makers, economic, biomedical and industrial practitioners as well as the general public. Above, for example, we question the necessity of the current infrastructure for peer review, and if a scholar-led crowdsourced alternative may be preferable. In addition, one of the biggest tensions in this space is associated with the question if for-profit companies (or the private sector) should be allowed to be in charge of the management and dissemination of academic output and execute their powers while serving, for the most part, their own interests. This is often considered alongside the value added by such companies, and therefore the two are closely linked as part of broader questions on appropriate expenditure of public funds, the role of commercial entities in the public sector, and issues around the privatisation of scholarly knowledge.

Publishing could certainly be done at a lower cost than common at present. There are significant researcher-facing inefficiencies in the system including the common scenario of multiple rounds of rejection and resubmission to various venues as well as the fact that some publishers profit beyond reasonable scale. What is missing most from the current publishing market, is transparency about the nature and the quality of the services publishers offer. This would allow authors to make informed choices, rather than decisions based on indicators that are unrelated to research quality, such as the JIF. All the above questions are being investigated and alternatives could be considered and explored. Yet, in the current system, publishers still play a role in managing processes of quality assurance, interlinking and findability of research. As the role of scholarly publishers within the knowledge communication industry continues to evolve, it is seen as necessary that they can justify their operation based on the intrinsic value that they add, and combat the perception that they add no value to the process.

<text>Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll is the fifth solo studio album by English musician John Lennon. Released in February 1975, it is an album of rock and roll songs from the late 1950s and early 1960s as covered by Lennon. Recording the album was troubled and spanned an entire year: Phil Spector produced sessions in October 1973 at A&amp;M Studios, and Lennon produced sessions in October 1974 at the Record Plant (East). Lennon was being sued by Morris Levy over copyright infringement of one line in his Beatles song &quot;Come Together&quot;. As part of an agreement, Lennon had to include three Levy-owned songs on &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Spector disappeared with the session recordings and was subsequently involved in a motor accident, leaving the album&#x27;s tracks unrecoverable until the beginning of the &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; sessions. With &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; coming out first, featuring one Levy-owned song, Levy sued Lennon expecting to see Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; album.

The album reached number 6 in both the United Kingdom and the United States, later being certified gold in both countries. It was supported by the single &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, which peaked at number 20 in the US, and 30 in the UK. The cover photo was taken by Jürgen Vollmer during the Beatles&#x27; stay in Hamburg.

== Background ==
In 1969, Lennon composed the song &quot;Come Together&quot; for the Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. Inspired by the Chuck Berry tune &quot;You Can&#x27;t Catch Me&quot;, it bore a melodic resemblance to the original—and Lennon took the third line of the second verse (&quot;Here come [old] flat-top&quot;) for the new lyric. Publisher Morris Levy brought a lawsuit for infringement, and the case was due to be heard in a New York court in December 1973. It was later settled out of court, with the agreement that, according to an announcement by Levy, Lennon had to &quot;record three songs by Big Seven publishers on his next album&quot;. The songs [he] intends to record at this time are &quot;You Can&#x27;t Catch Me&quot;, &quot;Angel Baby&quot; and &quot;Ya Ya&quot;.&quot; Lennon had the right to change the last two songs to any other songs that were published by Big Seven. The settlement also specified that he was to offer licensing rights to any three of seven specified non-Beatle songs owned by Apple Music. In the meantime, Lennon had separated from Yoko Ono and was living in Los Angeles with his personal assistant, May Pang. Nostalgia was a popular trend on film following response to the George Lucas film &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, and television was readying the series &quot;Happy Days&quot; (Lennon, Pang and John&#x27;s son Julian had even visited the set). Lennon, rather than writing his own songs, and partly inspired by his arrangement to include at least three songs from Levy&#x27;s publishing company catalogue, Big Seven Music, decided to record an album of oldies as his next release, following &quot;Mind Games&quot;.

==Recording==

Lennon initially teamed up with producer Phil Spector to record the album, letting Spector have full control. Spector chose some of the songs, and booked the studio and the musicians. When news got around that Lennon was in Hollywood making a record, many musicians working in the city wanted to be involved. In mid-October 1973, sessions were booked at A&amp;M Studios, with many of them having over 30 musicians, but the sessions quickly fell into disarray—fueled by alcohol. Spector once showed up dressed in a surgeon&#x27;s outfit and shot a gun in the ceiling of the studio, hurting Lennon&#x27;s ears. On another occasion, a bottle of whiskey had spilled on the A&amp;M Studio&#x27;s mixing console causing future sessions to be banned from the facility. Unknown to Lennon, each night Spector would remove the master tapes from the studio, and move them to his house. Spector then disappeared with the session tapes and would not be heard from for several months. Spector made one cryptic call to Lennon, claiming to have the &quot;John Dean tapes&quot; from the recent Watergate scandal; Lennon deduced that Spector meant he had the album&#x27;s master tapes. When a car accident on 31 March 1974 left Spector in a coma, the project was put on indefinite hold. In mid-1974, Lennon returned to New York with Pang and began writing and recording a new album of original material, &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot;. Shortly before these sessions began, Al Coury, then-head of A&amp;R/promotion for Capitol Records retrieved the Spector tapes. Not wanting to break stride, Lennon shelved the tapes and completed work on &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot;.

With &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; coming out first, Lennon had reneged on his deal with Levy, and Levy threatened to refile his lawsuit, but Lennon explained to Levy what had happened, and assured him that the covers album was indeed in the works. Levy gave Lennon use of his farm in upstate New York to rehearse material. Lennon then recalled the session musicians from &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; to complete the oldies tracks. Several tracks never made it past the rehearsal stage: &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot;, &quot;Thirty Days&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; – the band also played a few impromptu jams. A cover of the Ronettes&#x27; &quot;Be My Baby&quot; remained unreleased until 1998 when it was included in the &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot; box set.

On 21 October, Lennon went into Record Plant East, completing the oldies tracks in a few days. Lennon wanted the musicians to stay close to the original arrangements of the songs, apart from &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot;. Mixing and editing lasted until mid-November. To assure him progress was being made, Lennon gave Levy a rough tape of the sessions to review. Levy took the tapes and pressed his own version of the album called &quot;&quot; on his record label, Adam VIII, then proceeded to sue Lennon, EMI and Capitol for $42 million for breach of contract. Capitol/EMI quickly sought an injunction. After two trials, in which Lennon had to convince the court of the difference between a rough version and a final take, Levy won $6,795 in damages, and Lennon won $144,700, in February 1976. The album was originally scheduled for release in April 1975; however, in February 1975, Capitol Records rush-released the official &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; as a Capitol &quot;budget&quot; album (prefix code SK—one dollar cheaper than the usual releases) to counteract sales of the Levy album.

==Cover art==

Lennon planned to use some of his childhood drawings for the cover of his oldies album, and production had already begun when Lennon switched gears, so the artwork was used instead for &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot;. In September 1974, May Pang attended the first Beatlefest convention at Lennon&#x27;s behest, and met Jürgen Vollmer, an old friend of the Beatles from Hamburg, Germany, who had photographed the band from their Hamburg days. He was selling some striking portraits, and Pang immediately phoned Lennon to tell him of her find. Reuniting with Vollmer in New York, Lennon chose one of his photos for the album&#x27;s cover. The photo depicts Lennon in a doorway with three blurry figures walking past him in the foreground. Those figures are George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe and Paul McCartney. It was taken at 22 Wohlwillstraße in Hamburg.

The album&#x27;s working title had been &quot;Oldies But Mouldies&quot;; no official title had been chosen until Lennon saw the neon sign prepared as cover art by John Uomoto, with Lennon&#x27;s name and the words &quot;ROCK &#x27;N&#x27; ROLL&quot; beneath. This struck Lennon in a positive way, and it became the album title.

==Reception and aftermath==

Although some critics derided the album as &quot;a step backward&quot;, &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; wrote that &quot;John lends dignity to these classics; his singing is tender, convincing, and fond.&quot; AllMusic described the album &quot;as a peak in [Lennon&#x27;s] post-&quot;Imagine&quot; catalog: an album that catches him with nothing to prove and no need to try&quot;.

The album was released on 17 February 1975 in the US, and a few days later in the UK, on 21 February 1975. It reached number 6 in both the United Kingdom and the United States. On 10 March and 18 April 1975, in the US and UK respectively, &quot;Stand by Me&quot; was released as a single, backed with &quot;Move Over Ms. L&quot;, a song that was meant to appear on &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; but was cut from the final line-up. &quot;Stand by Me&quot; peaked at number 20 in the US and number 30 in the UK. Lennon promoted the song by appearing on the BBC TV show &quot;Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, which also featured an interview by Bob Harris. The show had Lennon singing live over the backing tracks of &quot;Stand by Me&quot; and &quot;Slippin&#x27; and Slidin&#x27;&quot;. Lennon also appeared on &quot;Salute to Sir Lew – The Master Showman&quot; singing live again over backing tracks, this time for three songs: &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, &quot;Slippin&#x27; and Slidin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Imagine&quot;. A second single, &quot;Slippin N Slidin&quot;/&quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; (Apple 1883), was announced, and promotional copies pressed, but it was not released. &quot;Ya Ya&quot;, backed with &quot;Be-Bop-A-Lula&quot;, was released as a single only in Germany, peaking at number 47 on the Media Control Charts. Lennon said the following about &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;: &quot;It started in &#x27;73 with Phil and fell apart. I ended up as part of mad, drunk scenes in Los Angeles and I finally finished it off on my own. And there was still problems with it up to the minute it came out. I can&#x27;t begin to say, it&#x27;s just barmy, there&#x27;s a jinx on that album.&quot;

Not long after the album appeared, Lennon reconciled with Ono, and she soon became pregnant. Determined not to lose another baby after three consecutive miscarriages, Lennon decided to halt his musical career for his family. Sean Lennon was born that October (on his father&#x27;s 35th birthday); following the release of the compilation &quot;Shaved Fish&quot;, Lennon would not return with a new release until 1980. &quot;Stand by Me&quot; was reissued in the US, with &quot;Woman Is the Nigger of the World&quot;, on 4 April 1977. &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; re-charted in the UK on 17 January 1981, at number 64. In the US, it was reissued in October 1980, also at budget price, and it was briefly reissued in the UK by the budget label Music for Pleasure with an alternative cover on 25 November 1981. After Lennon&#x27;s death, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set, which was released in the UK on 15 June 1981. In 1981, Belgium and France issued the album, along with the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot;, as part of a box set. The album was first issued on CD on 26 May 1987. In 1988 it was reissued in Australia with an alternative cover and under the title &quot;Rip It Up&quot;. In 2004, Yoko Ono supervised the remixing of &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; for its reissue, including four bonus tracks from the ill-fated Spector sessions. These leftovers from the sessions had already appeared, as part of 1986&#x27;s &quot;Menlove Ave.&quot; (a collection of outtakes) or the &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot; box set. (The Lennon/Spector co-composition &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; was not included on the remastered &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, and can be found on &quot;Menlove Ave.&quot; as well as on the soundtrack album for &quot;The U.S. vs. John Lennon&quot; and the 2010 &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; 4-CD set, on the 4th CD entitled &quot;Roots&quot; featuring the &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; tracks). In 2010, the original album mixes were remastered, the album was available separately as part of the &quot;John Lennon Signature Box&quot;.

<text>An academic journal or scholarly journal is a periodical publication in which scholarship relating to a particular academic discipline is published. They serve as permanent and transparent forums for the presentation, scrutiny, and discussion of research. They nearly universally require peer review for research articles or other scrutiny from contemporaries competent and established in their respective fields.

== Concept ==

Content usually takes the form of articles presenting original research, review articles, or book reviews. The purpose of an academic journal, according to Henry Oldenburg (the first editor of &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;), is to give researchers a venue to &quot;impart their knowledge to one another, and contribute what they can to the Grand design of improving natural knowledge, and perfecting all Philosophical Arts, and Sciences.&quot;

The term &quot;academic journal&quot; applies to scholarly publications in all fields; this article discusses the aspects common to all academic field journals. Scientific journals and journals of the quantitative social sciences vary in form and function from journals of the humanities and qualitative social sciences; their specific aspects are separately discussed.

The first academic journal was (January 1665), followed soon after by &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; (March 1665), and (1666). The first fully peer-reviewed journal was &quot;Medical Essays and Observations&quot; (1733).

==History==
The idea of a published journal with the purpose of &quot;[letting] people know what is happening in the Republic of Letters&quot; was first conceived by François Eudes de Mézeray in 1663. A publication titled was supposed to be published to fulfill that goal, but never was. Humanist scholar Denis de Sallo (under the pseudonym &quot;Sieur de Hédouville&quot;) and printer Jean Cusson took Mazerai&#x27;s idea, and obtained a royal privilege from King Louis XIV on 8 August 1664 to establish the . The journal&#x27;s first issue was published on 5 January 1665. It was aimed at people of letters, and had four main objectives:

# review newly published major European books,
# publish the obituaries of famous people, 
# report on discoveries in arts and science, and
# report on the proceedings and censures of both secular and ecclesiastical courts, as well as those of universities both in France and outside.

Soon after, the Royal Society established &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; in March 1665, and the established the &quot;&quot; in 1666, which focused on scientific communications. By the end of the 18th century, nearly 500 such periodicals had been published, the vast majority coming from Germany (304 periodicals), France (53), and England (34). Several of those publications, in particular the German journals, tended to be short-lived (under five years). A.J. Meadows has estimated the proliferation of journals to reach 10,000 journals in 1950, and 71,000 in 1987. Michael Mabe wrote that the estimates will vary depending on the definition of what exactly counts as a scholarly publication, but that the growth rate has been &quot;remarkably consistent over time&quot;, with an average rate of 3.46% per year from 1800 to 2003.

In 1733, &quot;Medical Essays and Observations&quot; was established by the Medical Society of Edinburgh as the first fully peer-reviewed journal. Peer review was introduced as an attempt to increase the quality and pertinence of submissions. Other important events in the history of academic journals include the establishment of &quot;Nature&quot; (1869) and &quot;Science&quot; (1880), the establishment of &quot;Postmodern Culture&quot; in 1990 as the first online-only journal, the foundation of arXiv in 1991 for the dissemination of preprints to be discussed prior to publication in a journal, and the establishment of &quot;PLOS One&quot; in 2006 as the first megajournal.

==Scholarly articles==
There are two kinds of article or paper submissions in academia: solicited, where an individual has been invited to submit work either through direct contact or through a general submissions call, and unsolicited, where an individual submits a work for potential publication without directly being asked to do so. Upon receipt of a submitted article, editors at the journal determine whether to reject the submission outright or begin the process of peer review. In the latter case, the submission becomes subject to review by outside scholars of the editor&#x27;s choosing who typically remain anonymous. The number of these peer reviewers (or &quot;referees&quot;) varies according to each journal&#x27;s editorial practice – typically, no fewer than two, though sometimes three or more, experts in the subject matter of the article produce reports upon the content, style, and other factors, which inform the editors&#x27; publication decisions.

Though these reports are generally confidential, some journals and publishers also practice public peer review. The editors either choose to reject the article, ask for a revision and resubmission, or accept the article for publication. Even accepted articles are often subjected to further (sometimes considerable) editing by journal editorial staff before they appear in print. The peer review can take from several weeks to several months.

==Reviewing==
===Review articles===
Review articles, also called &quot;reviews of progress&quot;, are checks on the research published in journals. Some journals are devoted entirely to review articles, some contain a few in each issue, and others do not publish review articles. Such reviews often cover the research from the preceding year, some for longer or shorter terms; some are devoted to specific topics, some to general surveys. Some reviews are enumerative, listing all significant articles in a given subject; others are selective, including only what they think worthwhile. Yet others are evaluative, judging the state of progress in the subject field. Some journals are published in series, each covering a complete subject field year, or covering specific fields through several years. 

Unlike original research articles, review articles tend to be solicited or &quot;peer-invited&quot; submissions, often planned years in advance, which may themselves go through a peer-review process once received. They are typically relied upon by students beginning a study in a given field, or for current awareness of those already in the field.

===Book reviews===
Reviews of scholarly books are checks upon the research books published by scholars; unlike articles, book reviews tend to be solicited. Journals typically have a separate book review editor determining which new books to review and by whom. If an outside scholar accepts the book review editor&#x27;s request for a book review, he or she generally receives a free copy of the book from the journal in exchange for a timely review. Publishers send books to book review editors in the hope that their books will be reviewed. The length and depth of research book reviews varies much from journal to journal, as does the extent of textbook and trade book review.

==Prestige and ranking==
An academic journal&#x27;s prestige is established over time, and can reflect many factors, some but not all of which are expressible quantitatively. In each academic discipline, some journals receive a high number of submissions and opt to restrict how many they publish, keeping the acceptance rate low. Size or prestige are not a guarantee of reliability.

In the natural sciences and in the social sciences, the impact factor is an established proxy, measuring the number of later articles citing articles already published in the journal. There are other quantitative measures of prestige, such as the overall number of citations, how quickly articles are cited, and the average &quot;half-life&quot; of articles. Clarivate Analytics&#x27; &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, which among other features, computes an impact factor for academic journals, draws data for computation from the Science Citation Index Expanded (for natural science journals), and from the Social Sciences Citation Index (for social science journals). Several other metrics are also used, including the SCImago Journal Rank, CiteScore, Eigenfactor, and Altmetrics.

In the Anglo-American humanities, there is no tradition (as there is in the sciences) of giving impact-factors that could be used in establishing a journal&#x27;s prestige. Recent moves have been made by the European Science Foundation (ESF) to change the situation, resulting in the publication of preliminary lists for the ranking of academic journals in the humanities. These rankings have been severely criticized, notably by history and sociology of science British journals that have published a common editorial entitled &quot;Journals under Threat&quot;. Though it did not prevent ESF and some national organizations from proposing journal rankings, it largely prevented their use as evaluation tools.

In some disciplines such as knowledge management/intellectual capital, the lack of a well-established journal ranking system is perceived by academics as &quot;a major obstacle on the way to tenure, promotion and achievement recognition&quot;. Conversely, a significant number of scientists and organizations consider the pursuit of impact factor calculations as inimical to the goals of science, and have signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment to limit its use.

Three categories of techniques have developed to assess journal quality and create journal rankings:
* stated preference;
* revealed preference; and
* publication power approaches

==Costs==

Many academic journals are subsidized by universities or professional organizations, and do not exist to make a profit. They often accept advertising, page and image charges from authors to pay for production costs. On the other hand, some journals are produced by commercial publishers who do make a profit by charging subscriptions to individuals and libraries. They may also sell all of their journals in discipline-specific collections or a variety of other packages.

Journal editors tend to have other professional responsibilities, most often as teaching professors. In the case of the largest journals, there are paid staff assisting in the editing. The production of the journals is almost always done by publisher-paid staff. Humanities and social science academic journals are usually subsidized by universities or professional organization.

The cost and value proposition of subscription to academic journals is being continuously re-assessed by institutions worldwide. In the context of the big deal cancellations by several library systems in the world, data analysis tools like Unpaywall Journals are used by libraries to estimate the specific cost and value of the various options: libraries can avoid subscriptions for materials already served by instant open access via open archives like PubMed Central.

==New developments==

The Internet has revolutionized the production of, and access to, academic journals, with their contents available online via services subscribed to by academic libraries. Individual articles are subject-indexed in databases such as Google Scholar. Some of the smallest, most specialized journals are prepared in-house, by an academic department, and published only online – this has sometimes been in the blog format, though some, like the open access journal &quot;Internet Archaeology&quot;, use the medium to embed searchable datasets, 3D models, and interactive mapping. 

Currently, there is a movement in higher education encouraging open access, either via self archiving, whereby the author deposits a paper in a disciplinary or institutional repository where it can be searched for and read, or via publishing it in a free open access journal, which does not charge for subscriptions, being either subsidized or financed by a publication fee. Given the goal of sharing scientific research to speed advances, open access has affected science journals more than humanities journals. Commercial publishers are experimenting with open access models, but are trying to protect their subscription revenues.

=== Predatory and junk journals ===

The much lower entry cost of on-line publishing has also raised concerns of an increase in publication of &quot;junk&quot; journals with lower publishing standards. These journals, often with names chosen as similar to well-established publications, solicit articles via e-mail and then charge the author to publish an article, often with no sign of actual review. Jeffrey Beall, a research librarian at the University of Colorado, has compiled a list of what he considers to be &quot;potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers&quot;; the list numbered over 300 journals as of April 2013, but he estimates that there may be thousands. The OMICS Publishing Group, which publishes a number of the journals on this list, threatened to sue Beall in 2013 and Beall stopped publishing in 2017, citing pressure from his university. A US judge fined OMICS $50 million in 2019 stemming from an FTC lawsuit.

Some academic journals use the registered report format, which aims to counteract issues such as data dredging and hypothesizing after the results are known. For example, &quot;Nature Human Behaviour&quot; has adopted the registered report format, as it &quot;shift[s] the emphasis from the results of research to the questions that guide the research and the methods used to answer them&quot;. The &quot;European Journal of Personality&quot; defines this format: &quot;In a registered report, authors create a study proposal that includes theoretical and empirical background, research questions/hypotheses, and pilot data (if available). Upon submission, this proposal will then be reviewed prior to data collection, and if accepted, the paper resulting from this peer-reviewed procedure will be published, regardless of the study outcomes.&quot;

=== Electronic journals ===
Some journals are &quot;born digital&quot; in that they are solely published on the web and in a digital format. Though most electronic journals originated as print journals, which subsequently evolved to have an electronic version, while still maintaining a print component, others eventually became electronic-only.

An e-journal closely resembles a print journal in structure: there is a table of contents which lists the articles, and many electronic journals still use a volume/issue model, although some titles now publish on a continuous basis. Online journal articles are a specialized form of electronic document: they have the purpose of providing material for academic research and study, and they are formatted approximately like journal articles in traditional printed journals. Often, a journal article will be available for download in two formats: PDF and HTML, although other electronic file types are often supported for supplementary material. Articles are indexed in bibliographic databases as well as by search engines. E-journals allow new types of content to be included in journals, for example, video material, or the data sets on which research has been based.

With the growth and development of the Internet, there has been a growth in the number of new digital-only journals. A subset of these journals exist as Open Access titles, meaning that they are free to access for all, and have Creative Commons licences which permit the reproduction of content in different ways. High quality open access journals are listed in Directory of Open Access Journals. Most, however, continue to exist as subscription journals, for which libraries, organisations and individuals purchase access.

<doc id="324581" wikidata="Q272610" url="?curid=324581" title="Cormac McCarthy">
<text>Cormac McCarthy (born Charles Joseph McCarthy Jr.; July 20, 1933 – June 13, 2023) was an American author who wrote twelve novels, two plays, five screenplays, and three short stories, spanning the Western, postapocalyptic, and Southern Gothic genres. His works often include graphic depictions of violence, and his writing style is characterised by a sparse use of punctuation and attribution. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest American novelists.

McCarthy was born in Providence, Rhode Island, although he was raised primarily in Tennessee. In 1951, he enrolled in the University of Tennessee, but dropped out to join the U.S. Air Force. His debut novel, &quot;The Orchard Keeper&quot;, was published in 1965. Awarded literary grants, McCarthy was able to travel to southern Europe, where he wrote his second novel, &quot;Outer Dark&quot; (1968). &quot;Suttree&quot; (1979), like his other early novels, received generally positive reviews, but was not a commercial success. A MacArthur Fellowship enabled him to travel to the American Southwest, where he researched and wrote his fifth novel, &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; (1985). Although it initially garnered a lukewarm critical and commercial reception, it has since been regarded as his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, with some labeling it the Great American Novel.

McCarthy first experienced widespread success with &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; (1992), for which he received both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. It was followed by &quot;The Crossing&quot; (1994) and &quot;Cities of the Plain&quot; (1998), completing &quot;The Border Trilogy&quot;. His 2005 novel &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; received mixed reviews. His 2006 novel &quot;The Road&quot; won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction.

Many of McCarthy&#x27;s works have been adapted into film. The 2007 film adaptation of &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; was a critical and commercial success, winning four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The films &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot;, &quot;The Road&quot;, and &quot;Child of God&quot; were also adapted from his works of the same names, and &quot;Outer Dark&quot; was turned into a 15-minute short. McCarthy had a play adapted into a 2011 film, &quot;The Sunset Limited&quot;.

McCarthy worked with the Santa Fe Institute, a multidisciplinary research center, where he published the essay &quot;The Kekulé Problem&quot; (2017), which explores the human unconscious and the origin of language. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2012. His final novels, &quot;The Passenger&quot; and &quot;Stella Maris&quot;, were published on October 25, 2022, and December 6, 2022, respectively.

==Life==
===Early life===
Charles Joseph McCarthy Jr. was born in Providence, Rhode Island, on July 20, 1933, one of six children of Gladys Christina McGrail and Charles Joseph McCarthy. His family was Irish Catholic. In 1937, the family relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, where his father worked as a lawyer for the Tennessee Valley Authority. The family first lived on Noelton Drive in the upscale Sequoyah Hills subdivision, but by 1941, had settled in a house on Martin Mill Pike in South Knoxville. McCarthy later said, &quot;We were considered rich because all the people around us were living in one- or two-room shacks.&quot; Among his childhood friends was Jim Long (1930–2012), who was later depicted as J-Bone in &quot;Suttree&quot;.

McCarthy attended St. Mary&#x27;s Parochial School and Knoxville Catholic High School, and was an altar boy at Knoxville&#x27;s Church of the Immaculate Conception. As a child, McCarthy saw no value in school, preferring to pursue his own interests. He described a moment when his teacher asked the class about their hobbies. McCarthy answered eagerly, as he later said, &quot;I was the only one with any hobbies and I had every hobby there was ... name anything, no matter how esoteric. I could have given everyone a hobby and still had 40 or 50 to take home.&quot;

In 1951, he began attending the University of Tennessee, studying liberal arts. He became interested in writing after a professor asked him to repunctuate a collection of eighteenth-century essays for inclusion in a textbook. McCarthy left college in 1953 to join the U.S. Air Force. While stationed in Alaska, McCarthy read books voraciously, which he said was the first time he had done so. He returned to the University of Tennessee in 1957, where he majored in English and published two stories, &quot;Wake for Susan&quot; and &quot;A Drowning Incident&quot; in the student literary magazine, &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, writing under the name C. J. McCarthy, Jr. For these, he won the Ingram-Merrill Award for creative writing in 1959 and 1960. In 1959, McCarthy dropped out of college and left for Chicago.

For the purpose of his writing career, McCarthy changed his first name from Charles to Cormac to avoid confusion, and comparison, with ventriloquist Edgar Bergen&#x27;s dummy Charlie McCarthy.
Cormac had been a family nickname given to his father by his Irish aunts. Other sources say he changed his name to honor the Irish chieftain Cormac MacCarthy, who constructed Blarney Castle.

After marrying fellow student Lee Holleman in 1961, McCarthy moved to what Lee&#x27;s obituary calls &quot;a shack with no heat and running water in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains outside of Knoxville.&quot; There, the couple had a son, Cullen, in 1962. When writer James Agee&#x27;s childhood home was being demolished in Knoxville that year, McCarthy used the site&#x27;s bricks to build fireplaces inside his Sevier County shack. Lee moved to Wyoming shortly after, where she filed for divorce from McCarthy.

===Early writing career (1965–1991)===

In 1965, Random House published McCarthy&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Orchard Keeper&quot; (1965). He had finished the novel while working part time at an auto-parts warehouse in Chicago and submitted the manuscript &quot;blindly&quot; to Albert Erskine of Random House. Erskine continued to edit McCarthy&#x27;s work for the next 20 years. Upon its release, critics noted its similarity to the work of Faulkner and praised McCarthy&#x27;s striking use of imagery. &quot;The Orchard Keeper&quot; won a 1966 William Faulkner Foundation Award for notable first novel.

While living in the French Quarter in New Orleans, McCarthy was evicted from a $40-a-month room for failing to pay his rent. When he traveled the country, McCarthy always carried a 100-watt bulb in his bag so he could read at night, no matter where he was sleeping.

In the summer of 1965, using a Traveling Fellowship award from The American Academy of Arts and Letters, McCarthy shipped out aboard the liner &quot;Sylvania&quot; hoping to visit Ireland. On the ship, he met Englishwoman Anne DeLisle, who was working on the ship as a dancer and singer. In 1966, they were married in England. Also in 1966, he received a Rockefeller Foundation grant, which he used to travel around Southern Europe before landing in Ibiza, where he wrote his second novel, &quot;Outer Dark&quot; (1968). Afterward, he returned to the United States with his wife, where &quot;Outer Dark&quot; was published to generally favorable reviews.
In 1969, the couple moved to Louisville, Tennessee, and purchased a dairy barn, which McCarthy renovated, doing the stonework himself. According to DeLisle, the couple lived in &quot;total poverty&quot;, bathing in a lake. DeLisle claimed, &quot;Someone would call up and offer him $2,000 to come speak at a university about his books. And he would tell them that everything he had to say was there on the page. So we would eat beans for another week.&quot; While living in the barn, he wrote his next book, &quot;Child of God&quot; (1973). Like &quot;Outer Dark&quot; before it, &quot;Child of God&quot; was set in southern Appalachia. In 1976, McCarthy separated from Anne DeLisle and moved to El Paso, Texas.

In 1974, Richard Pearce of PBS contacted McCarthy and asked him to write the screenplay for an episode of &quot;Visions&quot;, a television drama series. Beginning in early 1975, and armed with only &quot;a few photographs in the footnotes to a 1928 biography of a famous pre-Civil War industrialist William Gregg as inspiration&quot;, McCarthy and Pearce spent a year traveling the South to research the subject of industrialization there. McCarthy completed the screenplay in 1976 and the episode, titled &quot;The Gardener&#x27;s Son&quot;, aired on January 6, 1977. Numerous film festivals abroad screened it. The episode was nominated for two Primetime Emmy awards in 1977.

In 1976, when McCarthy was 42, he met then-16-year-old Finnish-American Augusta Britt at a motel in Arizona. Despite their age difference, the two hit it off immediately, and he drew upon their experiences for &quot;Suttree&quot;, his work-in-progress at the time. By the following year, in 1977, when he was 43, but she was still 17, on a shared trip to Mexico, they had progressed to a physical relationship. They remained friends until his death.

In 1979, McCarthy published his semiautobiographical &quot;Suttree&quot;, which he had written over 20 years before, based on his experiences in Knoxville on the Tennessee River. Jerome Charyn likened it to a doomed &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, noting how the Yew tree of the author&#x27;s sprawling Tennessee garden was inspiration for the &quot;christening of what became the principal character&#x27;s name.&quot;

In 1981, McCarthy was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship worth $236,000. Saul Bellow, Shelby Foote, and others had recommended him to the organization. The grant enabled him to travel the American Southwest to research his next novel, &quot;Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West&quot; (1985). The book is violent, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; declaring it the &quot;bloodiest book since the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Although snubbed by many critics, the book has grown appreciably in stature in literary circles; Harold Bloom called &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; &quot;the greatest single book since Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot;&quot;. In a 2006 poll of authors and publishers conducted by &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; to list the greatest American novels of the previous quarter-century, &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; placed third, behind Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Beloved&quot; (1987) and Don DeLillo&#x27;s &quot;Underworld&quot; (1997). Some have even suggested it is the Great American Novel. &quot;Time&quot; included it on their 2005 list of the 100 best English-language books published since 1923. At the time, McCarthy was living in a stone cottage behind an El Paso shopping center, which he described as &quot;barely habitable&quot;.

As of 1991, none of McCarthy&#x27;s novels had sold more than 5,000 hardcover copies, and &quot;for most of his career, he did not even have an agent&quot;. He was labeled the &quot;best unknown novelist in America&quot;.

===Success and acclaim (1992–2013)===

After working with McCarthy for twenty years, Albert Erskine retired from Random House in 1992. McCarthy turned to Alfred A. Knopf, where he fell under the editorial advisement of Gary Fisketjon. As a final favor to Erskine, McCarthy agreed to his first interview ever, with Richard B. Woodward of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

McCarthy finally received widespread recognition following the publication of &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; (1992), when it won the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. It became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, selling 190,000 hardcover copies within six months. It was followed by &quot;The Crossing&quot; (1994) and &quot;Cities of the Plain&quot; (1998), completing the Border Trilogy.
In the midst of this trilogy came &quot;The Stonemason&quot; (first performed in 1995), his second dramatic work.
McCarthy originally conceived his next work, &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; (2005), as a screenplay before turning it into a novel. Consequently, the novel has little description of setting and is composed largely of dialogue. A western set in the 1980s, &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; was adapted by the Coen brothers into a 2007 film of the same name, which won four Academy Awards and more than 75 film awards globally.

In the early 2000s while staying at an El Paso motel with his young son, McCarthy looked out the window late one night and imagined what the city might look like in fifty or one hundred years and saw: &quot;fires up on the hill and everything being laid to waste&quot;. He wrote two pages covering the idea; four years later in Ireland he expanded the idea into his tenth novel, &quot;The Road&quot;. It follows a lone father and his young son traveling through a post-apocalyptic America, hunted by cannibals. Many of the discussions between the two were verbatim conversations McCarthy had had with his son. Released in 2006, it won international acclaim and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. McCarthy did not accept the prize in person, instead sending Sonny Mehta in his place. John Hillcoat directed the 2009 film adaptation, written by Joe Penhall, and starring Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee. Critics&#x27; reviews were mostly favorable: Roger Ebert found it &quot;powerful&quot; but lacking &quot;emotional feeling&quot;, Peter Bradshaw noted &quot;a guarded change of emphasis&quot;, while Dan Jolin found it to be a &quot;faithful adaptation&quot; of the &quot;devastating novel&quot;.
McCarthy published the play &quot;The Sunset Limited&quot; in 2006. Critics noted it was unorthodox and may have had more in common with a novel, hence McCarthy&#x27;s subtitle: &quot;a novel in dramatic form&quot;. He later adapted it into a screenplay for a 2011 film, directed and executive produced by Tommy Lee Jones, who also starred opposite Samuel L. Jackson.
Oprah Winfrey selected McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;The Road&quot; as the April 2007 selection for her Book Club. As a result, McCarthy agreed to his first television interview, which aired on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; on June 5, 2007. The interview took place in the library of the Santa Fe Institute. McCarthy told Winfrey that he did not know any writers and much preferred the company of scientists. During the interview, he related several stories illustrating the degree of outright poverty he endured at times during his career as a writer. He also spoke about the experience of fathering a child at an advanced age, and how his son was the inspiration for &quot;The Road&quot;.

In 2012, McCarthy sold his original screenplay &quot;The Counselor&quot; to Nick Wechsler, Paula Mae Schwartz, and Steve Schwartz, who had previously produced the film adaptation of McCarthy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Road&quot;. Directed by Ridley Scott, with the production finished in 2012, the film was released on October 25, 2013, to polarized critical reception. Mark Kermode of &quot;The Guardian&quot; found it &quot;datedly naff&quot;, and Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;a droning meditation on capitalism&quot;. However, Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found it &quot;terrifying&quot; and &quot;seductive&quot;.

===Santa Fe Institute (2014–2023)===
McCarthy was a trustee for the Santa Fe Institute (SFI), a multidisciplinary research center devoted to the study of complex adaptive systems. Unlike most members of the SFI, McCarthy did not have a scientific background. As Murray Gell-Mann explained, &quot;There isn&#x27;t any place like the Santa Fe Institute, and there isn&#x27;t any writer like Cormac, so the two fit quite well together.&quot; From his work at the Santa Fe Institute, McCarthy published his first piece of nonfiction writing in his 50-year writing career. In the essay entitled &quot;The Kekulé Problem&quot; (2017), McCarthy analyzes a dream of August Kekulé&#x27;s as a model of the unconscious mind and the origins of language. He theorizes about the nature of the unconscious mind and its separation from human language. The unconscious, according to McCarthy, &quot;is a machine for operating an animal&quot; and &quot;all animals have an unconscious&quot;. McCarthy postulates that language is a purely human cultural creation and not a biologically determined phenomenon.

In 2015, McCarthy&#x27;s next novel, &quot;The Passenger&quot;, was announced at a multimedia event hosted in Santa Fe by the Lannan Foundation. The book was influenced by his time among scientists; it has been described by SFI biologist David Krakauer as &quot;full-blown Cormac 3.0—a mathematical [and] analytical novel&quot;. In March 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;The Passenger&quot; would be released on October 25, 2022, and a second companion novel, &quot;Stella Maris&quot;, on November 22. The latter was McCarthy&#x27;s first novel since &quot;Outer Dark&quot; to feature a female protagonist.

At the time of his death, McCarthy was listed as an executive producer on a film adaption of &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;, to be directed by John Hillcoat, who previously directed the film adaptation of &quot;The Road.&quot; In a 2024 interview, Hillcoat said he and McCarthy spent extended time discussing the film, which the author once volunteered to write and envisioned as a &quot;Faustian tale, the journey of the Judge trying to win the soul of the kid, and consume everything in his path.&quot; McCarthy had rejected a miniseries proposal, finding television lacks a &quot;kind of grandeur about it, an element of scale.&quot;

==Writing approach and style==
===Syntax===

McCarthy used punctuation sparsely, even replacing most commas with &quot;and&quot; to create polysyndetons; it has been called &quot;the most important word in McCarthy&#x27;s lexicon&quot;. He told Oprah Winfrey that he preferred &quot;simple declarative sentences&quot; and that he used capital letters, periods, an occasional comma, or a colon for setting off a list, but never semicolons, which he labeled as &quot;idiocy&quot;. He did not use quotation marks for dialogue and believed there is no reason to &quot;blot the page up with weird little marks&quot;. Erik Hage notes that McCarthy&#x27;s dialogue often lacks attribution, but that &quot;somehow... the reader remains oriented as to who is speaking.&quot; His attitude to punctuation dated to some editing work he did for a professor of English while enrolled at the University of Tennessee; he stripped out much of the punctuation in the book being edited, which pleased the professor. McCarthy edited fellow Santa Fe Institute Fellow W. Brian Arthur&#x27;s influential article &quot;Increasing Returns and the New World of Business&quot;, published in the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; in 1996, removing commas from the text. He also copy edited work for physicists Lawrence M. Krauss and Lisa Randall.

Saul Bellow praised his &quot;absolutely overpowering use of language, his life-giving and death-dealing sentences&quot;. Richard B. Woodward has described his writing as &quot;reminiscent of early Hemingway&quot;. Unlike earlier works such as &quot;Suttree&quot; and &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;, the majority of McCarthy&#x27;s work after 1993 uses simple, restrained vocabulary.

===Themes===

McCarthy&#x27;s novels often depict explicit violence. Many of his works have been characterized as nihilistic, particularly &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;. Some academics dispute this, saying &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; is actually a gnostic tragedy. His later works have been characterized as highly moralistic. Erik J. Wielenberg argues that &quot;The Road&quot; depicts morality as secular and originating from individuals, such as the father, and separate from God.

The bleak outlook of the future, and the inhuman foreign antagonist Anton Chigurh of &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;, is said to reflect the apprehension of the post-9/11 era. Many of his works portray individuals in conflict with society and acting on instinct rather than on emotion or thought. Another theme throughout many of McCarthy&#x27;s works is the ineptitude or inhumanity of those in authority and particularly in law enforcement. This is seen in &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; with the murder spree the Glanton Gang initiates because of the bounties, the &quot;overwhelmed&quot; law enforcement in &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;, and the corrupt police officers in &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot;. As a result, he has been labeled the &quot;great pessimist of American literature&quot;.

===Bilingual narrative practice===
McCarthy was fluent in Spanish, having lived in Ibiza, Spain in the 1960s and later residing in El Paso, Texas and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Isabel Soto argues that after he learned the language, &quot;Spanish and English modulate or permeate each other&quot; in his novels, as it was &quot;an essential part of McCarthy&#x27;s expressive discourse&quot;. Katherine Sugg observes that McCarthy&#x27;s writing is &quot;often considered a &#x27;multicultural&#x27; and &#x27;bilingual&#x27; narrative practice, particularly for its abundant use of untranslated Spanish dialogue&quot;. Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera observes &quot;John Grady Cole is a native speaker of Spanish. This is also the case of several other important characters in the &quot;Border Trilogy&quot;, including Billy Parhnam , John Grady&#x27;s mother (and possibly his grandfather and brothers), and perhaps Jimmy Blevins, each of whom are speakers of Spanish who were ostensibly born in the US political space into families with what are generally considered English-speaking surnames ... This is also the case of Judge Holden in &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;.&quot;

===Work ethic and process===
McCarthy dedicated himself to writing full time, choosing not to work other jobs to support his career. &quot;I always knew that I didn&#x27;t want to work&quot;, McCarthy said. &quot;You have to be dedicated, but it was my number-one priority.&quot; Early in his career, his decision not to work sometimes subjected him and his family to poverty.

Nevertheless, according to scholar Steve Davis, McCarthy had an &quot;incredible work ethic&quot;. He preferred to work on several projects simultaneously and said, for instance, that he had four drafts in progress in the mid-2000s and for several years devoted about two hours every day to each project. He was known to conduct exhaustive research on the historical settings and regional environments found in his fiction. He edited his own writing, sometimes revising a book over the course of years or decades before deeming it fit for publication. While his research and revision were meticulous, he did not outline his plots and instead viewed writing as a &quot;subconscious process&quot; which should be given space for spontaneous inspiration.

After 1958, McCarthy wrote all of his literary work and correspondence with a mechanical typewriter. He originally used a Royal but went looking for a more lightweight machine ahead of a trip to Europe in the early 1960s. He bought a portable Olivetti Lettera 32 for $50 at a Knoxville pawn shop and typed about five million words over the next five decades. He maintained it by simply &quot;blowing out the dust with a service station hose&quot;. Book dealer Glenn Horowitz said the modest typewriter acquired &quot;a sort of talismanic quality&quot; through its connection to McCarthy&#x27;s monumental fiction, &quot;as if Mount Rushmore was carved with a Swiss Army knife&quot;. His Olivetti was auctioned in December 2009 at Christie&#x27;s, with the auction house estimating it would fetch between $15,000 and $20,000. It sold for $254,500, with proceeds donated to the Santa Fe Institute. McCarthy replaced it with an identical model, bought for him by his friend John Miller for $11 plus $19.95 for shipping.

==Personal life and views==
McCarthy was a teetotaler. According to Richard B. Woodward, &quot;McCarthy doesn&#x27;t drink anymore – he quit 16 years ago [i.e. in 1976] in El Paso, with one of his young girlfriends – and &quot;Suttree&quot; reads like a farewell to that life. &#x27;The friends I do have are simply those who quit drinking,&#x27; he says. &#x27;If there is an occupational hazard to writing, it&#x27;s drinking&#x27;.&quot; However, his long-time friend Augusta Britt claimed that he had resumed drinking near the end of his life.

In the 1980s, McCarthy and Edward Abbey considered covertly releasing wolves into southern Arizona to restore their decimated population.

In the late 1990s, McCarthy moved to Tesuque, New Mexico, north of Santa Fe, with his third wife, Jennifer Winkley, and their son, John. McCarthy and Winkley divorced in 2006.

In 2013, Scottish writer Michael Crossan created a Twitter account impersonating McCarthy, quickly amassing several thousand followers and recognition by former site owner Jack Dorsey. Five hours after the account&#x27;s creation, McCarthy&#x27;s publisher confirmed that the account was fake and that McCarthy did not own a computer. In 2018, another account impersonating McCarthy was created. In 2021, it was briefly marked verified following a viral tweet, after which his agent confirmed that the account was again a fake.

In 2016, a hoax spread on Twitter claiming that McCarthy had died, with &quot;USA Today&quot; even repeating the information. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; responded to the hoax with the headline, &quot;Cormac McCarthy isn&#x27;t dead. He&#x27;s too tough to die.&quot;

In 2024, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; published an article about McCarthy&#x27;s relationship with Augusta Britt, whom he met when he was 42 and she was 16. The article claims that he took her to Mexico with a forged birth certificate and began having sex with her when she was still 17. Britt has confirmed this account but denied that the relationship was predatory or abusive. 

===Politics===
McCarthy did not publicly reveal his political opinions. A resident of Santa Fe with a traditionalist disposition, he once expressed disapproval of the city and the people there: &quot;If you don&#x27;t agree with them politically, you can&#x27;t just agree to disagree—they think you&#x27;re crazy.&quot; Academic David Holloway writes that &quot;McCarthy&#x27;s writing can be read as either liberal or conservative, or as both simultaneously, depending on the politics that readers themselves bring with them to the act of reading the work&quot;.

===Science and literature===
In one of his few interviews, McCarthy revealed that he respected only authors who &quot;deal with issues of life and death&quot;, citing Henry James and Marcel Proust as examples of writers who do not. &quot;I don&#x27;t understand them ... To me, that&#x27;s not literature. A lot of writers who are considered good I consider strange&quot;, he said. 
Regarding his own literary constraints when writing novels, McCarthy said he was &quot;not a fan of some of the Latin American writers, magical realism. You know, it&#x27;s hard enough to get people to believe what you&#x27;re telling them without making it impossible. It has to be vaguely plausible.&quot; He cited &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1851) as his favorite novel. Along with &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, McCarthy regarded &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1880), &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922), and &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; (1929) as &quot;great&quot; novels.

Socially, McCarthy had an aversion to other writers, preferring the company of scientists. He voiced his admiration for scientific advances: &quot;What physicists did in the 20th century was one of the extraordinary flowerings ever in the human enterprise.&quot; At MacArthur reunions, McCarthy shunned his fellow writers to fraternize instead with scientists like physicist Murray Gell-Mann and whale biologist Roger Payne. Of all of his interests, McCarthy stated, &quot;Writing is way, way down at the bottom of the list.&quot;

=== Death ===
McCarthy died at his home in Santa Fe on June 13, 2023, at the age of 89. Stephen King said McCarthy was &quot;maybe the greatest American novelist of my time ... He was full of years and created a fine body of work, but I still mourn his passing.&quot;

==Legacy==

In 2003, literary critic Harold Bloom named McCarthy as one of the four major living American novelists, alongside Don DeLillo, Thomas Pynchon, and Philip Roth. Bloom&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;The Western Canon&quot; had listed &quot;Child of God&quot;, &quot;Suttree&quot;, and &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; among the works of contemporary literature he predicted would endure and become &quot;canonical&quot;. Bloom reserved his highest praise for &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;, which he called &quot;the greatest single book since Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot;&quot;, and though he held less esteem for McCarthy&#x27;s other novels he said that &quot;to have written even one book so authentically strong and allusive, and capable of the perpetual reverberation that &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; possesses more than justifies him... He has attained genius with that book.&quot;

A comprehensive archive of McCarthy&#x27;s personal papers is preserved at the Wittliff Collections, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas. The McCarthy papers consists of 98 boxes (46 linear feet). The acquisition of the Cormac McCarthy Papers resulted from years of ongoing conversations between McCarthy and Southwestern Writers Collection founder, Bill Wittliff, who negotiated the proceedings. The Southwestern Writers Collection/Wittliff Collections also holds The Woolmer Collection of Cormac McCarthy, which consists of letters between McCarthy and bibliographer J. Howard Woolmer, and four other related collections.

<text>Huelva ( , , ) is a municipality of Spain and the capital of the province of Huelva, in the autonomous community of Andalusia. Located in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula, it sits between the estuaries of the Odiel and Tinto rivers on the Atlantic coast of the Gulf of Cádiz. According to the 2010 census, the city had a population of 149,410.

While the existence of an earlier pre-Phoenician settlement within the current urban limits since has been tentatively defended by scholars, Phoenicians established a stable colony roughly by the 9th century BC. Modern economic activity conformed to copper and pyrite extraction upstream funded by British capital and to the role of its port, as well as with the later development of a petrochemical industry.

Huelva is home to Recreativo de Huelva, the oldest football club in Spain.

==History==
=== Protohistory ===
At least up to the 1980s and 1990s, the mainstream historians&#x27; view was that Huelva began as an autochthonous Tartessian settlement (possibly the very same Tartessos mentioned in Greek sources); later opinions have held that it was a multi-ethnic enclave, mixing natives with peoples with a mainly Phoenician, and later Greek, extraction. However, following the finding of Phoenician archaeological materials in the Méndez Núñez-Las Monjas site, the chronology as to the Phoenician presence was reassessed. The evidence favours solely viewing Huelva-Onoba as a very early Phoenician colony, a development which was parallel to a certain &quot;dismantling&quot; of the idea of Tartessos as a mainly autochthonous archaeological culture, even though the tentative identification of Huelva with Tartessos was not discarded, but rather kept. Tartessos has also been identified with the biblical Tarshish.

First contacts with the local Phoenician presence have been hypothesised to have taken place as early as 1015 to 975 BCE. However, remains such as those found in the Méndez Núñez-Las Monjas go so far as to show a likely Phoenician settlement of the 9th century BCE, especially to resemble a founding date of a Tyrian settlement from the reign of Ithobaal I between 875 and 850, although the Méndez Núñez-Las Monjas&#x27; archaeological finds have been brought forward as evidence of a 10th-century BCE founding chronology in the era of Hiram I (c. 975–950). The outpost was presumably populated mainly by continental Phoenicians, with some possible addition of the likes of Eteocypriots, Cypriot Phoenicians and Sardinian Phoenicians.

As a Phoenician outpost, it facilitated local exports such as silver, copper, purple dye and salted fish, while it also served as node in the trade routes connecting the Northern Atlantic, the Southern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Population notably increased from the mid-8th century BCE onward, possibly connected to the arrival of refugees fleeing from Tiglath-Pileser III and, overall, from the economic crisis and social unrest induced by the Assyrian subjugation of the Levant.

It was called &quot;ʿunʿu baʿl&quot; (&quot;Baal&#x27;s fort&quot;) by the Phoenicians, which in most Greek texts corrupted to (&quot;Onoba&quot;). The Tartessian world entered a crisis in the 6th century BCE. The transition from the Tartessian period to the ensuing Turdetani period was presumably slow and not traumatic, degenerating from an economy based on mining to a new one focused on the trade of agricultural and fishing products. It was in the hands of the Turdetani at the time of conquest by Rome, and before the conquest, it issued silver coins with Iberian lettering.

=== Antiquity ===

The place was called both &quot;Onoba Æstuaria&quot; or &quot;Onuba&quot; (used on coinage) during Roman times, or, simply, &quot;Onoba&quot;. It was put in the Roman province of Hispania Bætica. According to the Antonine Itinerary: it was a maritime town between the Anas, (modern Guadiana) and Bætis (modern Guadalquivir); it was on the estuary of the Luxia (modern Odiel), and on the road from the mouth of the Anas to Augusta Emerita (modern Mérida). There are still some Roman remains. Huelva hosted a mint; and many coins have been found there bearing the name of the town as Onuba.

=== Middle Ages ===
Soon after the beginning of the Umayyad invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 711, &quot;Onuba&quot; was seized by the troops of Musa ibn Nusayr by April 712. Within a few decades, to both the broader Islamic world and the conquered locals, the town&#x27;s name had corrupted to ولبة (&quot;Walba&quot;).

During the fitna of al-Andalus a weak and ephemeral taifa emerged following the demise of local Umayyad control: the &quot;bakrid&quot;, from 1012 to 1051. In the latter year, it was annexed by the more powerful Taifa of Seville, to be later occupied by the Almoravids in 1091. By 1262, Huelva—then part of the Taifa of Niebla—was taken by Alfonso X of Castile. From 1265 onward, Huelva enjoyed an exemption from the &quot;portazgo&quot; tribute, a portage tax.

Following the Christian conquest, the town became a &quot;royal demesne&quot; for a short time, until it was ceded in Lordship to Admiral in 1293 by Sancho IV of Castile. After a period during which Huelva was probably controlled by Seville, the &quot;tenencia&quot; of the lordship was passed to several lords, including Alonso Meléndez de Guzmán—brother of Eleanor de Guzmán—(in 1338) and Juan Alfonso de la Cerda (). Huelva, again a &quot;realengo&quot; for a short time during the reign of Peter I, saw its privileges confirmed and was granted the right to choose the &quot;alcalde&quot; and the &quot;alguacil&quot; in 1351. The lordship was soon given to the king&#x27;s mistress, María de Padilla.

=== Early modern history ===

It suffered substantial damage in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

Huelva became a leading fishing town in Andalusia in the 16th century (thriving in the sardine and tuna markets). The town became a provincial capital in 1833.

=== Modern history ===
Mines in the countryside still send copper and pyrite to Huelva&#x27;s port for export. From about 1873, the major mining company has been Rio Tinto.

Huelva acquired the status of city (&quot;ciudad&quot;) by means of a royal decree on 17 September 1876.

The ore-smelting caused severe sulfur dioxide pollution and was frequently met by the protests of local farmers, peasants and miners, allied under the anarchist Syndicalist leader Maximiliano Tornet. On 4 February 1888, the Pavi Regiment of the Spanish Army opened fire on demonstrators at the village plaza of Rio Tinto. Historians estimate the number of deaths at 100 to 200. One hundred years later, environmentalists defending the nearby village of Nerva referred to 1888 as the &quot;year of shots&quot;, in their protests against the provincial government&#x27;s plans to site a large waste dump in a disused mine in the 1990s.

The local football club, Recreativo de Huelva was founded in 1889 by workers of Rio Tinto Group. Nicknamed the &quot;Decano&quot; of Spanish football, it is the longest-playing football club in Spain.

The 17–18 July 1936 military coup d&#x27;état that started the Spanish Civil War failed in the city and much of the province. However, on 27 July, 500 &quot;guardias civiles&quot; rose in arms against the Republic in the city, with the authorities escaping and later being shot down. Two days later, on 29 July, a rebel column from Seville on behalf of Gonzalo Queipo de Llano took control of the city. For the rest of the conflict, it remained to the rear of the zone controlled by the Rebel faction. The ensuing Francoist repression took a heavy toll, with an estimated total of deaths all over the province for the rearguard and post-war repression.

During World War II, the city was a hub of espionage activities led by members of the large British and German expatriate communities. German activity centered on reporting British shipping moving in and out of the Atlantic. Most famously, the outskirts was where Operation Mincemeat allowed a cadaver carrying forged identification to wash ashore.

Twenty-five years after the city was declared a &quot;Polo de Desarrollo Industrial&quot; (&quot;Pole of Industrial Development&quot;) in 1964, the population had nearly doubled.

== Geography ==
;Location

Huelva is in the Southwest of the Iberian Peninsula, in the Gulf of Cádiz, facing the Atlantic Ocean. The coastline straddling along the Gulf of Cádiz is known as Costa de la Luz. The city lies next to the estuary formed by the confluence of the Odiel and Tinto, sandwiched in between both rivers.

A rather wide estuary in ancient times, the estuary of Huelva progressively silted up to a large extent.

==Transportation==
Huelva is home to Grupo Damas, a major provincial bus company providing connections between Huelva and other cities in Spain.

The city has a modern train station, inaugurated in 2018, which connects Huelva to Seville via regular trains and to Madrid through daily high-speed AVE train services. Currently, there are no direct train services between Huelva and Portugal.

The Port of Huelva offers passenger ferry services operated by Naviera Armas. The ferry &quot;Volcán del Teide&quot; provides weekly connections to Arrecife (Lanzarote) and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands.

Huelva does not have its own airport yet. The nearest airports are Faro Airport (Portugal), approximately 93 km away, and Seville Airport, about 95 km away. Both airports offer a range of domestic and international flights.

==Demographics==
Huelva had a population of 149,410 in 2010. The city experienced a population boom in the nineteenth century, due to the exploitation of mineral resources in the area, and another with the construction of the &quot;Polo de Desarrollo&quot; (industrial hub) in the 1960s. It had a population of 5,377 inhabitants in 1787, which had risen to only 8,519 by 1857. From 1887, the city experienced rapid growth, reaching 21,539 residents in 1900, 56,427 in 1940, and 96,689 in 1970. Rapid expansion occurred in the following decades, and the population reached 141,479 by 1991.

From 1997 to 2007, immigration both from abroad and from the surrounding area sustained population growth. In 2007, the city reached a population of 145,000, while the metropolitan area had nearly 232,000 inhabitants, encompassing the surrounding areas of Aljaraque, Moguer, San Juan del Puerto, Punta Umbría, Gibraleón, and Palos de la Frontera. The 2006 census recorded a foreign-born population of almost 5,000 people in the urban centre, the majority of whom were of Moroccan origin.

==Climate==

Huelva and its metropolitan area experience a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), characterized by mild, wet winters and long, hot, dry summers. The average annual temperature is approximately 18.1°C (64.6°F), with average highs reaching 25.5°C (77.9°F) in August and lows of 11.4°C (52.5°F) in January. Annual precipitation is around per year, typically spread across 53 rainy days, with December being the wettest month. Extreme temperatures have included a high of 43.9°C (111.0°F) recorded on 25 July 2022 and a low of -3.2°C (29°F) recorded in January. While Huelva experiences milder conditions near the coastline, its location near the river delta slightly amplifies summer warmth.

Snowfall is an extremely rare phenomenon in the city of Huelva. The most significant snowfalls recorded occurred in February 1954 and January 1991, with snow depths reaching up to 10 cm (4 in) and 15 cm (6 in), respectively, causing notable disruptions due to the region&#x27;s lack of preparedness for such events. Huelva&#x27;s climate is further influenced by being in the Atlantic Ocean, which moderates temperatures, particularly in coastal areas.

The Sierra de Huelva&#x27;s unique microclimate also contributes to its occasional snowfalls yearly, making it a distinct feature compared to the otherwise temperate lowlands.


==Artists==
The most well-known artists in Huelva have been the poet and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature Juan Ramón Jiménez, the sculptor Antonio León Ortega, the writer Nicolas Tenorio Cerero and the painter Daniel Vázquez Díaz.
Other outstanding artists from Huelva include the painters José Caballero, Pedro Gómez y Gómez, Antonio Brunt, Mateo Orduña Castellano, Pablo Martínez Coto, Manuel Moreno Díaz, Juan Manuel Seisdedos Romero, Francisco Doménech, Esperanza Abot, José María Labrador, Sebastián García Vázquez, Pilar Barroso, Juan Carlos Castro Crespo, Lola Martín, Antonio Gómez Feu, Rafael Aguilera, and Florencio Aguilera Correa. Miguel Báez Espuny, called &quot;el Litri&quot;, was a very famous bullfighter from Huelva; his son, named Miguel Báez Spínola, was also a very renowned bullfighter who retired in 1999.

<text>The Army of Republika Srpska (; ВРС/VRS), commonly referred to in English as the Bosnian Serb Army, was the military of Republika Srpska, the self-proclaimed Serb secessionist republic, a territory within the newly independent Bosnia and Herzegovina (formerly part of Yugoslavia), which it defied and fought against. Active during the Bosnian War from 1992 to 1995, it continued to exist as the armed forces of RS, one of two entities making up Bosnia and Herzegovina, until 2006 when it was integrated into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Forces of the VRS engaged in several campaigns, including Operation Corridor 92, Operation Vrbas &#x27;92, Operation Bura, and Operation Spider; they were also involved in the siege of Sarajevo, as well as the Srebrenica massacre.

==Personnel==

The Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) was founded on 12 May 1992 from the remnants of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from which Bosnia and Herzegovina had seceded earlier in 1992. When the Bosnian War erupted, the JNA formally discharged 80,000 Bosnian Serb troops. These troops, who were allowed to keep their heavy weapons, formed the backbone of the newly formed Army of the Republika Srpska.

The VRS was made up largely of ethnic Serbs from Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also included ca. 4,000 foreign Orthodox Christian volunteers. 700 of whom came from Russia, and 300–800 from Bulgaria. 100 Greeks also volunteered to fight on the side of the Bosnian Serbs, forming the Greek Volunteer Guard which allegedly participated in the Srebrenica massacre. A number of Romanians and Ukrainians fought as well on the Bosnian Serb side.

==Post-war status and abolishment ==
After the war, the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina had two armies, that of the VRS and the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (AFBiH). AFBiH was itself composed of two elements, the ARBiH and HVO. The two armies functioned without a common command, on the principle of &quot;non-intervention in the affairs of the other&quot;. Bisera Turković noted that it was &#x27;therefore questionable whether in say a foreign attack on Sarajevo [...the VRS] would defend this capital city&#x27;. The existence of the two separate armies was one of the factors impeding civil-military relations development. The VRS conducted demining.

In 2003 the army began to integrate into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2005 a fully integrated unit of Serbs, Bosniaks, and Croats was deployed to augment the US-led coalition forces in Iraq. On 6 June 2006, it was fully integrated into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Leadership==

The supreme commander of the VRS was General Ratko Mladić, later indicted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for genocide, as were some other high-ranking Serb officers. Mladić was arrested in Serbia on 26 May 2011.

== Organization ==
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia stated that:
&quot;In July 1995, the Armed Forces of the Republika Srpska were under the command and control of the Commander-in-Chief, Radovan Karadžić. His headquarters was in Pale.

Within the framework of the VRS, immediately subordinate to the Commander-in-Chief, was the Main Staff of the VRS, headquartered in Han Pijesak and commanded by General Ratko Mladić. It was the responsibility of the Commander of the Main Staff to issue regulations, orders and instructions regarding the implementation of orders by the Commander-in-Chief, and to discharge the command duties delegated to him by the Commander-in-Chief. The Main Staff of the VRS consisted of staff officers and staff support personnel, as well as some specialised military units such as the 65th Protection Regiment, designed to provide protection and combat services for the Main Staff; and the 10th Sabotage Detachment, a unit trained for operations behind enemy lines and other special combat assignments.

The vast majority of the fighting force of the VRS itself was divided into six geographically-based Corps, all subordinate to, and under the command of, General Mladić and, in turn, the Commander-in-Chief, Radovan Karadzic. In July 1995, the six Corps were the Drina Corps, the 1st Krajina Corps, the 2nd Krajina Corps, the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps, the Hercegovina Corps and the East Bosnia Corps.&quot;

<text>Torremolinos () is a municipality in Andalusia, southern Spain, west of Málaga. A poor fishing village before the growth in tourism began in the late 1950s, Torremolinos was the first of the Costa del Sol resorts to be developed and is still the most popular in the region.

On the western shore of the Bay of Málaga and in front of the Sierra de Mijas from Málaga, it is served by the A-7 motorway, which bypasses the city to the north, the Cercanías commuter train and Avanzabus.

In 2013, it had 69,389 inhabitants, making it the sixth largest city in the province. The township has an area of .

Areas of the town are dotted with older high-rise residential buildings and hotels, but height limitations on new developments and a significant number of original old town properties have kept the town centre much more open than other popular resorts such as Benidorm and Fuengirola.

As the name Coast of the Sun implies, Torremolinos enjoys one of the best climates in Europe. It has long, dry summers with relatively low humidity, and mild winters with occasional, though heavy, rainfall. The town benefits in the summer from cool sea breezes predominantly coming from Africa, although this does mean a fair amount of Sahara dust. Temperatures normally hover around in the summer and in the winter. Torremolinos sometimes experiences a sea fog that goes as quickly as it appears.

The beach, which extends for nearly , has cycle and skating lanes alongside the fully illuminated promenade and features many chiringuitos (beach bars/restaurants). The eastern end of the beach, known as Los Álamos, has live dance music events throughout the summer. The easternmost parts of the beach have kitesurfing and windsurfing except under the flight path of the airport.

In addition to its tourism sector, Torremolinos is known locally for its vibrant and liberal nightlife, particularly its numerous bars and clubs catering to the LGBT community. Torremolinos co-hosted World Pride in 2017 in conjunction with Madrid and holds its own Pride in June, now the third largest in Spain.

== History ==


Archaeological finds, including human and animal bones, tools, and pottery prove that the Torremolinos area was settled as early as the Neolithic Age. Some artifacts and tools are Neanderthal in origin, dated to nearly 150,000 years ago through radiocarbon dating.

According to the Egyptian Greek geographer Ptolemy, the Phoenicians had founded here a colony named &quot;Saduce&quot;, but the Romans are the most likely to have founded the current town, as shown by findings of edifices and a necropolis (from whose size it has been deduced that the settlement had around 2,000 inhabitants). They also built the road joining Cadiz with Málaga, passing through Torremolinos.

With the Moorish conquest of Spain, the mills, from which the town takes its name (meaning &quot;Tower of the Mills&quot;), were introduced. However, at the time the population was reduced; the tower was built by the Nasrid rulers of Granada starting from 1300. After the fall of Granada, the town remained subject to North African pirate attacks which lasted from the 18th century; during the War of Spanish Succession, the town was attacked by an Anglo-Dutch flotilla under the British admiral George Rooke and almost entirely destroyed. A document dated 1769 lists a town population of 106.

The mills and the city were rebuilt in the early 20th century, but the mill industry started to decline in the 1920s. It was largely replaced by an increasing tourist interest from 1928, particularly British visitors. Hotel Pez Espada opened in 1960. The first gay bar in Spain, Toni&#x27;s Bar, was founded in Torremolinos in 1962. The Spanish regime reacted to the free lifestyle of the city with arrests of homosexuals and other repressions during the 1970s.

Torremolinos first appeared on the map of the Ensenada&#x27;s Marques in 1748. 
The name comes from the words Torre (Tower) and Molino (Mill). Water mills covered all this area of which only one survives (Molino de Inca) and one tower which forms part of a restaurant. Historians believe that moulded stones discovered at beaches and mountains in Torremolinos indicate the existence of the village 150,000 years ago.

Further evidence of its pre-history are nine skulls, some bones, clay pots, axe heads and arrows, ornaments of necklaces and bracelets, a ring and some animal bones discovered in the excavations of the caves: cueva del Tesoro (treasure cave), cueva tapada (cover cave), cueva del encanto (charm cave), cueva del tejón (badger cave). The study of these items places them at the Neolithic in the Quaternary period, around 5.000 years before Christ at the period when man learned to cultivate, the land. It is estimated that the skeletons found at the caves and at the cape of Torremolinos were 1.5 or 1.6 meters tall (4’9 ft. or 5’2 ft.).

===Pre-Roman===

According to Ptolemy, Phoenicians built the city of Saduce next to Torremolinos. The Romans constructed a road to connect Gades (Cádiz) with Malaca (Málaga). In the 1990s a Roman necropolis was discovered with 23 graves at the &quot;San Luis build&quot; at Cantabria&#x27;s square, which confirm the existence of a village of about 2000 years old.

===Middle Ages===

Around 1300, the Muslim dynasty of the &quot;Nazríes&quot;, which governed Málaga between the 13th and 15th centuries, built the defensive tower that can be seen at the end of San Miguel Street. The tower is 12 metres high and was built with earth. It is composed of two floors and watch windows to the sea and a terrace.

===Before French revolution===

After the Christians conquered the kingdom of Granada, Torremolinos was attacked by pirates until the 18th century.

During the War of Spanish succession, an Anglo-Dutch fleet, commanded by the British Admiral George Rooke, looted and burned the houses and mills and destroyed all of Torremolinos. A census of 1769 shows a population of 106 people.

===Modern age===

During the first half of the 19th century the town was rebuilt and by 1849, there were 14 mills and 785 inhabitants. With the demise of the mills, Torremolinos became a small fishing village until the end of the 1950s when it became one of the first tourist centers in the Costa del Sol. In the 1950s, many celebrities visited Torremolinos such as Brigitte Bardot, Kirk Douglas, Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, Marlon Brando, Orson Welles and Frank Sinatra.

In 1959, the Art Deco styled Hotel Pez Espada was opened, the first luxury hotel along the coast. In the following years, new hotels, nightclubs and other tourist-aimed establishments changed the face of the town and its beaches. By 1965, Torremolinos was already consolidated as a major tourist destination.

In 2023, Torremolinos achieved record numbers of hotel occupancy and tourist spend, particularly from the LGBTQ events such as Madbear and Torremolinos Gay Pride as well as the Feria San Miquel which attracts over 200,000 visitors.

==Climate==
Torremolinos has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;). The summers are hot and dry with relatively low humidity, and the winters are mild and humid, especially in November and December, with occasional, though heavy, rainfall. The town benefits in the summer from cool sea breezes predominately coming from Africa although this does mean a fair amount of Sahara dust. On rare occasions heavy dust storms known as Calima can discolour the normally pristine white buildings and even turn the sky orange. Day temperatures normally hover around in July and August and the upper teens in the winter. In the summer, Torremolinos sometimes experiences a sea fog that goes as quickly as it appears. The phenomenon, known as &#x27;Taró&#x27;, was reported as far back as Phoenician times and is a type of sea advection fog.

==Events==

As a popular tourist destination on the Costa del Sol, with over 1 million visitors and 5 million bed stays in 2023 Torremolinos has many events and festivals throughout the year.

At the end of September Torremolinos has the Feria de San Miguel, a celebration that includes parades, music and dance shows happening both in the fairgrounds and in the city center for up to a week. 

In mid October each year the Komando Motorbike Festival takes place with approximately 15,000 bikers attending the Palacio de Congresso.

==Leisure==

Torremolinos is home to the largest water park on the Costa del Sol. Called Aqualand, it is open from May to October. Next door is the Crocodile Park, which is open year-round. Nearby is a large wooded area with public barbecue facilities and seating.

The botanical gardens, Molino de Inca, are located next to the municipal-run Garden center which backs onto Aqualand.

The local radio station is Radio Planeta on FM 92.8 and only plays dance music in English but with Spanish advertising.

A free English paper, Sur in English, is printed every Friday.

Torremolinos has several large municipal-owned venues, including a conference, exhibition and convention centre, the Palacio de Congresos, the auditorium Prince of Asturias, and the Pablo Ruiz Picasso cultural centre.

==Shopping==
Torremolinos has some early shopping centres built in the 1960s and 70s most of which are sparsely populated due to unmotivated landowners and difficulties with disabled access.

The main tourist shops are on Calle San Miguel, Plaza Costa del Sol, the stairs down to the beach and the beach road itself.

In 2016, approval was given for a massive shopping, hotel, casino and leisure complex to be built by the same company, Intu, that developed the Trafford Centre in Manchester on land next to Aqualand and the A7 motorway and primary ring roads. Costing in excess of 800 million euros, it will be the largest development of its type in the Mediterranean, however the project has been delayed.

==Sports==
Torremolinos has many sporting complexes, including two Olympic swimming pools, track and field facilities, tennis courts, racquet ball courts, as well as football pitches; this, combined with the climate, led to over 900 international athletes training in the town in 2023. 

During the warmer months, the city offers classes for children, as well as adults, in various physical activities such as Aerosalsa, an activity that combines aerobics with Latin dances and salsa, body tonic, indoor cycling, competitive swimming, children&#x27;s swimming, functional training, gap, adult swimming, paddle, pilates, basketball and tennis. The covered tennis courts, unusual in the area, have been frequented by Novak Djokovic.

==Transport==

The coastal towns from Malaga through to Fuengirola are served by Cercanías commuter trains and the fares are divided by zone. 

Málaga Airport is 10 minutes away by train, which runs every 20 minutes. It is the 3rd busiest airport in Spain carrying over 16 million passengers annually. 

Torremolinos is served by 5 rail stations, all of them wheelchair-friendly including the new refurbished main station in the town centre square of La Nogalera, which now has two escalators and lifts following an investment of €7.5 million.

<text>The Costa del Sol (; literally &quot;Coast of the Sun&quot;) is a region in the south of Spain in the autonomous community of Andalusia, comprising the coastal towns and communities along the coastline of the Province of Málaga and the eastern part of Campo de Gibraltar in Cádiz. Formerly made up only of a series of small fishing settlements, today the region is a world-renowned tourist destination. The Costa del Sol is situated between two lesser known coastal regions, the Costa de la Luz and the Costa Tropical.

The region has no official limit, but it is generally accepted that the Costa del Sol stretches from the municipality of La Línea de la Concepción in the west to Nerja in the east, spanning around 150 kilometers of coastline. The term Costa del Sol was coined at the beginning of the 20th century by Rodolfo Lussnigg to promote the Almería coastline. Until the late 1960s, it was used in reference to the entire Mediterranean coast of Eastern Andalusia. The name refers to the sunny climate, present in the region most days of the year. The Costa del Sol is one of the most important tourist areas in Spain; around 35% of Andalusia&#x27;s tourism is concentrated in the region; in 2009 it had 17 million overnight stays.

The region was a relatively prosperous commercial and industrial center for much of the 19th century. The tourist boom in the area began in the 1920s with the opening of the in Málaga and a golf course in Torremolinos. It became an international tourist destination in the 1950s and is today particularly popular among British, German, Scandinavian, French and Moroccan tourists. The most populated city on the Costa del Sol is the city of Málaga, with a metropolitan population of close to one million. Málaga is home to the Málaga-Costa del Sol Airport, which is the third busiest airport in mainland Spain, behind Barajas (Madrid) and El Prat (Barcelona).

The A-7 highway runs through the region, as does the old national highway generally known as N-340. High-speed trains serve the coastal region and inland areas, the AVE service reaches the Málaga-María Zambrano railway station in 2 hours and 46 minutes from Madrid. The Costa del Sol has a population of 1,412,541 inhabitants. The Costa del Sol has spas in Málaga, Tolox, Estepona, Benahavís, Benalmádena, Mijas, Torremolinos and Marbella, the largest concentration of golf courses on the European continent, fifteen marinas, nine theme parks (including amusement parks, aquariums and zoos), as well as an information and communication technology business park (PTA), a Google cybersecurity center and a Vodafone research and development center.

==Geography==
The Costa del Sol includes the city of Málaga and also the towns of Torremolinos, Benalmádena, Fuengirola, Mijas, Marbella, San Pedro de Alcántara, Estepona, Manilva, Casares, Rincón de la Victoria, Vélez-Málaga, Nerja, Frigiliana and Torrox.
This shoreline region extends from the cliffs at Maro in the East to Punta Chullera in the west. It occupies a narrow coastal strip delimited by some ranges of the Penibaetic System, including the Sierra de Mijas, Sierra Alpujata, Sierra Blanca, , and Montes de Málaga to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The coast shows a diversity of landscapes: beaches, cliffs, estuaries, bays and dunes. The rivers are short and seasonal, while the agriculture is hampered by the lee effect caused by the Baetic System.

==History==
=== Prehistory ===

The settlement history of this coast spans about 2,800 years. The first inhabitants to settle here may have been the Bastuli, an ancient Celtiberian tribe. The Phoenicians founded their colony of &quot;Malaka&quot; here about 770 BC, and from the 6th century BC it was under the hegemony of ancient Carthage in north Africa. From 218 BC the region was ruled by the Roman Republic and then at the end of the 1st century it was federated with the Roman Empire.Under the rule of the Roman Republic, the &quot;Municipium Malacitanum&quot; became a transit point on the &quot;Via Herculea&quot;, which revitalised the city both economically and culturally by connecting it with other developed enclaves in the interior of Hispania and with other ports of the Mediterranean Sea.

The decline of the Roman imperial power in the 5th century led to invasions of Hispania Baetica by Germanic peoples and by the Byzantine Empire. The southern Mediterranean coast was part of Visigothic Spain from the fifth century until the Muslim Arab conquest of Hispania (711–718) The city, then known as Mālaqa (مالقة), was encircled by defensive walls and became part of the Muslim Empire. In 1026 it became the capital of the Taifa of Málaga, an independent Muslim kingdom ruled by the Hammudid dynasty in the Caliphate of Córdoba, which was conquered by the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada.

The siege of Mālaqa by the Catholic Monarchs in 1487 was one of the longest of the Reconquista. In the 16th century, the area entered a period of slow decline, exacerbated by epidemics of disease, several successive poor food crops, floods, and earthquakes.

Trade, dominated by foreign merchants, was the main source of wealth in Málaga province of the 18th century, with wine and raisins as the principal commodity exports. Public works done on the Málaga city port as well as those on the Antequera and Velez roadways provided the necessary infrastructure for distribution of the renowned Málaga wines.

Málaga, as headquarters of the &quot;Capitanía General de Granada&quot; (Captaincy General of the Kingdom of Granada) on the coast, played an essential role in the foreign policy of the Bourbon kings of Spain. The regional military and the defence of the Mediterranean were administered in the city. The loss of Gibraltar to the British in the Battle of Málaga of 1704 made the city the key to military defence of the Strait.

During the second half of the 18th century Málaga solved its chronic water supply problems with the completion of one of the largest infrastructure projects carried out in Spain at the time: the building of the Aqueduct of San Telmo. The peasantry and the working classes still made up the vast majority of the population, but the emergence of a business-oriented middle-class lay the foundations for the 19th-century economic boom.

===Beginnings of the tourist industry===
Having been a relatively prosperous commercial and industrial centre for most of the 19th century, Málaga province experienced a severe economic contraction in the 1880s and 1890s. It led to the end of the iron industry in 1893, and weakened the trade and textile industry. The agricultural sector suffered a deep depression that affected the raising of livestock and all the major crops, especially cultivation of Vitis vinifera, a grape used for the wine industry, which was devastated by a Phylloxera epidemic.

The social disruption caused by the crisis and its aftermath of job loss, business collapse and general decline in economic activity, led many residents to consider other means of livelihood. Even at this early date some of them envisaged tourism as an alternative source of income, but years passed before initiatives were put forward to develop Málaga as a tourist resort. The &quot;Sociedad Propagandística del Clima y Embellecimiento de Málaga&quot; (Propagation Society for the Climate and Beautification of Málaga) was founded in 1897 by a pioneering group of influential Málaga businessmen who saw the potential of tourism as a generator of wealth, and tried to organise a rational planned development of this sector of the economy. Their promotional campaigns extolled the mild climate of Málaga, attracting enough tourists and winter visitors to help relieve the economic slump somewhat.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Baños del Carmen beach was developed and opened in the east of Málaga. The Torremolinos golf course followed in 1928. According to local historian Fernando Alcala, on 15 October 1933, the &quot;Hotel Miramar&quot; was inaugurated in Marbella. The owners, Jose Laguno Canas and Maria Zuzuarregui (daughter of Agustina Zuzuarregui y Sutton Clonard) promoted this hotel and the city of Marbella in English and in French, using the expressions &quot;Sunny Coast&quot; and &quot;Côte du Soleil &quot;in all its stationery and lampoons. According to Estefania Rodriguez Camacho, quoting Fernando Alcala&#x27;s book, [&quot;Marbella. Years of Tourism. Volume I. The beginning of a long march.&quot;] these are the real inventors of the expression &quot;Costa del Sol&quot;.

However, development of the tourist sector was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War and World War II.

===Spanish Civil War===
Following the uprising of Francoist forces in July 1936, control of Andalusia was divided between the Republican forces and the Nationalists, with the Costa del Sol remaining in the Republican zone and Málaga serving as a naval base for the Spanish Republican Navy. The Battle of Málaga was the culmination of an offensive in February 1937 by the combined Nationalist and Italian forces under the command of General Queipo de Llano to eliminate Republican control of the province of Málaga. The participation of Moroccan regulars and Italian tanks from the recently arrived Corpo Truppe Volontarie resulted in a complete rout of the Spanish Republican Army and the capitulation of Málaga in less than a week on 8 February. 

The occupation of Málaga led to an exodus of civilians and soldiers on the road to Almería, who were bombarded by Franco&#x27;s air force, navy cruisers, tanks and artillery on 8 February, causing hundreds of deaths. This episode is known as the &quot;Málaga-Almería road massacre&quot;. A local historian recounted that nationalist reprisals after the province was captured resulted in total deaths of over 7,000 people.

===1940s and 1950s===
Until after World War II, Marbella was a small jasmine-lined village with only 900 inhabitants. Ricardo Soriano, Marquis of Ivanrey, moved to Marbella and popularised it among his rich and famous friends. In 1943 he had acquired a country estate located between Marbella and San Pedro called &quot;El Rodeo&quot;, and later built a resort there called &quot;Venta y Albergues El Rodeo&quot;, beginning the development of tourism in Marbella.

Soriano&#x27;s nephew, Prince Alfonso of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, acquired another estate, &quot;Finca Santa Margarita&quot;, which in 1954 would become the Marbella Club, an international resort of movie stars, business executives and the nobility. Both these resorts would be frequented by members of European aristocratic families, transforming Marbella into a destination for the international jet set.

In the 1950s Torremolinos began to become a popular holiday destination and was visited by international celebrities such as Grace Kelly, Ava Gardner, Marlon Brando, Orson Welles, Brigitte Bardot and Frank Sinatra. The Hotel la Roca had opened in 1942, with the Hotel Pez Espada opening in 1959.
===1960s and 1970s===
The Costa del Sol experienced an explosive demographic and economic expansion with the boom in tourism between 1959 and 1974. The name &quot;Costa del Sol&quot; was a brand created specifically to market the Mediterranean coastline of Málaga province to foreign vacationers. Historically the provincial population had lived in the fishing villages, and in the &quot;white&quot; villages (pueblos blancos) a short distance inland in the mountains running down to the coast. The area was developed to meet the demands of international tourism in the 1950s and has since been a popular destination for foreign tourists not only for its beaches but also for its local culture.

The &quot;Spanish miracle&quot; fed itself on the rural exodus which created a new class of industrial workers. The economic boom led to an increase in rapid, largely unplanned building on the periphery of the cities of the Costa del Sol to accommodate the new workers arriving from the countryside. Some cities preserved their historic centres, but most were altered by often haphazard commercial and residential developments. The same fate befell long stretches of scenic coastline as mass tourism exploded. 

Torremolinos&#x27; popularity as a tourist destination had a domino effect, and in the late 1960s and early 1970s, nearby municipalities such as Benalmadena, Fuengirola and Mijas, also saw a growth in the number of tourists. The 1960s brought a radical change in the appearance of the small fishing villages. Hotels were opened in Nerja and Málaga and promoted by Ricardo Soriano and his nephew Alfonso of Hohenlohe. Marbella became a fashionable destination for aristocrats and the rich. The author Juan Bonilla portrayed the swinging Sixties scene on the Costa del Sol in his non-fiction work of caustic cultural criticism, &quot;La Costa del Sol en la hora pop&quot; (2007), depicting real-life characters from elderly expatriate Nazis and jailbird criminal politicians to titled aristocratic playboys like Soriano and Hohenlohe.

===Late 1970s onwards===
The rebuilding of the Málaga Airport was the decisive improvement to infrastructure that facilitated mass tourism on the coast. Low cost charter flights and holiday packages made it a player on the international market. By the 1970s trips to Spain were the predominant business of the European tour operators, and the Costa del Sol continued to increase in popularity through the decade. This trend coincided with rapid industrial growth in Málaga and the decline of dependence on the agricultural sector, although growth in the general economy of Spain slowed almost to a standstill after 1973.

As rapid development proceeded on the Costa del Sol, and the influx of expatriate retirees from northern European countries, notably Great Britain, increased during the late 1970s and 1980s. It has since then sometimes been referred to in the press of the United Kingdom as the &quot;Costa del Crime&quot;, because British criminals would escape justice at home by moving there to live their lives in luxury. The presence of the Italian Camorra in the Costa del Sol is also so strong that Camorra bosses refer to it as &quot;Costa Nostra&quot; (&quot;Our Coast&quot;), according to Italian journalist Roberto Saviano, a specialist on the Naples criminal underworld. With tense relations between the UK and Spain over Gibraltar, extradition arrangements were not at that time agreed. This phenomenon has been alluded to in films and television shows such as &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;, &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, &quot;The Cook Report&quot;, and &quot;The Olsen Gang on the Track&quot;, as well as in the more recent films &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; and &quot;The Business&quot;. Some of the more famous British criminals known to have fled to the Costa del Sol in the past were Charlie Wilson, Ronnie Knight, Freddie Foreman, Anthony Fraser (grandson of Mad Frankie Fraser), and more recently Andrew Moran. John Disley, nicknamed the &quot;King of Marbella&quot;, (not to be confused with the international criminal Monzer al-Kassar whose nickname is the &quot;Prince of Marbella&quot;), masterminded a £700,000 bank fraud. Other European criminal entrepreneurs, many of Russian and Dutch origin, have also settled on this coast for the climate and functional advantages for their enterprises, as well as being active investors in the property sector.

The Costa del Sol welcomes millions of tourists annually. Visitors arriving by air can land at either Málaga Airport, Granada Airport or Gibraltar International Airport. and head to one of the many resorts located along this stretch of coastline from Manilva in the west to Nerja in the east.

==Transport==
Since 1998 the Port of Málaga has been undergoing renovation and expansion as part of the project called the &quot;Plan Especial del Puerto de Málaga&quot;. There are major projects underway or planned which will radically change the image of the port and surrounding areas. The traffic of goods rose from 2,261,828 metric tonnes in 2010 and more than doubled to 5,448,260 tonnes in 2011.

===Passenger===
Cruise shipping has become an essential industry at the port and a major driver of investment in Málaga. In 2012 there were 651,517 passengers visiting the city on board cruise ships calling at the port, including those who started or ended their cruise in Málaga. The development of the cruise industry is proceeding with a new passenger terminal, port museum, and environmental education centre planned for inclusion in the cruise ship facilities at Quay 2. A commercial marina will also operate from Quay 1, catering to 24 super-yachts of up to 30 metres, and the Eastern Quay passenger terminal will be remodeled to improve pedestrian access and double existing capacity to 560,000 passengers a year.

The four ports of Marbella are primarily recreational; although both Puerto Banús and the Puerto de la Bajadilla are permitted to dock cruise ships, neither operates regular service to other ports. The port of Bajadilla is also home to the fishermen&#x27;s guild of Marbella and is used for the transport of goods.

AVE (&quot;Alta Velocidad Española&quot;, AVE), a high-speed rail service operated by Renfe, the Spanish national railway company, inaugurated the Córdoba-Málaga high-speed rail line, a standard gauge railway line in length, on 24 December 2007. Designed for speeds of and compatibility with neighbouring countries&#x27; rail systems, it connects Málaga and Córdoba. The proposed Costa del Sol railway would link Málaga with Marbella and Estepona.

==Gastronomy==
Native cuisine on the Costa del Sol, as in the rest of Andalusia, has been influenced historically by Spanish, Jewish and Arabic traditions, and emphasises seafood. &quot;Pescaíto frito&quot;, small fish breaded without egg and fried in olive oil, then served with fresh lemon, is a universally popular dish. Gazpacho is a famous refreshing cold soup made of raw tomatoes, cucumber, onions, green peppers, garlic, bread, oil and vinegar. &quot;Tortillas&quot;, Spanish omelettes made with potatoes and served cold, are typical, and a plate of thin-sliced &quot;jamón serrano&quot;, or dry-cured ham, with a glass of sherry or Málaga wine is a traditional combination. The &quot;Ir de Tapas&quot; (Tapas tour) is a popular activity where one visits various bars and restaurants to eat Tapas. Some bars will serve a &quot;tapa&quot; for free when one orders a drink. &quot;Churros&quot;, fried-dough pastries served hot and dipped in café con leche or hot chocolate are a typical breakfast food.

&quot;Chiringuitos&quot;, small, open-air beachside restaurants, offer respite from the summer heat of the cities in the high holiday season.

<doc id="324603" wikidata="Q183482" url="?curid=324603" title="National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party">
<text>The National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (; ) is a party congress that is held every five years. The National Congress is formally the highest body within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Since 1987 the National Congress has been held in the months of October or November. The venue for the event, beginning in 1956, is the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The Congress is the public venue for top-level leadership changes in the CCP and the formal event for changes to its constitution. In the past two decades the National Congress of the CCP has been pivotal at least as a symbolic part of leadership changes, and therefore has gained international media attention.

The Congress formally approves the membership of the Central Committee, a body composed of the top decision-makers in the party, state, and society. In practice, however, only slightly more candidates than open seats are nominated for the Central Committee, limiting the Congress&#x27;s role in the selection process to eliminating very unpopular candidates. Each five-year cycle of the National People&#x27;s Congress also has a series of plenums of the Central Committee which since the mid-1990s have been held more or less regularly once every year.

== History ==
From the mid-1980s to the late-2010s, the CCP has attempted to maintain a smooth and orderly succession and avoiding a cult of personality, by having a major shift in personnel every ten years in even number party congresses, and by promoting people in preparation for this shift in odd number party congresses. In addition, as people at the top level of the party retire, there is room for younger members of the party to move up one level. Hence the party congress is a time of a general personnel reshuffle, and the climax of negotiations that involve not only the top leadership but practically all significant political positions in China. Because of the pyramid structure of the party and the existence of mandatory retirement ages, cadres who are not promoted at a party congress are likely to face the end of their political careers.

== Preparation ==
Similar to the practice of the NPC, the delegates to the Congress are formally selected from grassroots party organizations, and like the NPC, there is a system of staggered elections in which one level of the party votes for the delegates to the next higher level. For the National Congress, delegates are elected by the CCP&#x27;s provincial level party congresses or their equivalent units in a selection process that is screened and supervised by the party&#x27;s Organization Department as directed by the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC).

The party rules state that just before the National Congress, a preparatory committee must be established by the Politburo, with the current general secretary of the CCP generally chairing the committee. This committee oversees the election of the few thousand delegates to the National Congress and prepares a list of candidates to be elected to the Central Committee and its bodies, including the Politburo, PSC, Secretariat and the Central Military Commission. It additionally establishes a drafting committee that drafts the work report of the CCP general secretary, and also establishes a group that proposes amendments to the CCP constitution.

On the day before the first session of the National Congress, the incumbent General Secretary presides over a preparatory meeting of the congress&#x27;s delegates. At this meeting he formally proposes the candidates for the Presidium of the National Congress () and a Congress Secretary-General for approval as a single list. After undergoing the formality of election, the Presidium subsequently convenes on the same day and elects a Standing Committee to manage the procedural affairs of the National Congress during its sessions.

The Standing Committee of the Presidium of the National Congress () has been said to be the &quot;leading core&quot; of the Party Congress. It discusses and seeks consent on important issues related to the candidates and accordingly proposes solutions to the Presidium, chairs the plenary meetings of the Presidium and the electoral proceedings, reviews the rehearsal voting outcomes and submits a list of official candidates to the Presidium for discussion and approval. One of the major roles of the Presidium Standing Committee is to submit to the Party Congress Presidium a list of people who would chair the first plenary meeting of the newly elected Central Committee, thereby ensuring leadership continuity during the formal procedure that is used to elect the Politburo, the PSC and the General Secretary.

In recent elections, the members of the SCPNC have included all members of the Politburo and the Secretariat. The size of the committee is not fixed and, in contingency situations, can also include other actors from the party and the state. Since 2002, all living and non-expelled former PSC members have also been members of the committee. This means that the Standing Committee of the National Congress Presidium essentially encompasses the de facto selectorate for the new Politburo and Standing Committee. According to Ling Li, who teaches Chinese studies in the University of Vienna, this system allows for peaceful transitions of power by allowing former and current party leaders to influence outcomes.

== The meeting ==
The National Congress gathers every five years in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. At the opening of the meeting, the General Secretary delivers the &quot;political report&quot; () of the incumbent Central Committee. According to the Center for Strategic Translation, the political report &quot;recapitulates the victories and setbacks the Party experienced over the previous five years, announces changes in the Party’s ideological line, and establishes the goals intended to guide all party and state activity in the years to come&quot;. The political report is the most authoritative document in China&#x27;s political system, and its drafting often lasts a year. It is drafted by a drafting group, which is often led by the person on track to be the next General Secretary. During the drafting process, hundreds of cadres provide feedback on the sections of the political report relevant to their responsibilities.

The Congress formally approves the membership of the Central Committee, a body composed of the top decision-makers in the party, state, and society. It also approves the membership of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and approves changes to the Party Constitution.

<text>Adalberto Javier Ramones Martínez (born 3 December 1961) is a Mexican television presenter and comedian who is known for his comments on Mexican and international social life. Ramones was the host of a popular Mexican television show, &quot;Otro Rollo&quot;, which was produced by Televisa and televised in 53 other countries, including the United States, where the show was transmitted by Univision.

==Biography==
Ramones was born in Monterrey, Nuevo León. He suffered from heart disease for a long portion of his life, but after several operations, he managed to recover. He earned his communication degree from Universidad Regiomontana. Since 1998, Ramones is romantically involved with Gaby Valencia. Their first child, Paola Ramones, was born in 2001.

In 1998, Ramones was a victim of kidnapping one month before his wedding. His kidnappers locked him in a closet, blindfolded with his hands and feet bound. He lost 7 kilos during those seven days, only allowed to drink minimum water and constantly threatened by the criminal gang. Three chapters of his autobiography, to be published by the Planeta publishing house, cover this kidnap episode.

On 10 October 2002, he suffered an accident where he caught fire during the &quot;Reto Burundis&quot; in &quot;Otro Rollo&quot;.

In February 2003, Ramones suffered burns to several parts of his body as he was shooting his show, requiring hospitalization. He had to wear glasses for some time after this.

On 30 July of that year, American pop star Britney Spears sang at his show, and on September of that year, he led the &quot;La pesera del amor&quot; contest, where a man chose among a number of women to pick a future wife. Ramones promised the man and the contest winner that the show would pay for their wedding and he would broadcast it live. &quot;La pesera del amor&quot; was later kept as a regular feature and more contestants participated for the chance to meet someone.

In November 2003, Sylvester Stallone became the second American superstar to participate in the show that year.

Other international stars that have appeared in the show through the years are: Ricky Martin, t.A.T.u., Will Smith (three times), Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin James, Sylvia Saint, Diego Maradona, Christina Aguilera, David Copperfield, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Díaz, Lucy Liu, Chris Rock, Chayanne, John Leguizamo, N*SYNC, The Backstreet Boys, Gloria Gaynor, Shakira and The Rock. Worthy of note, although Paris Hilton was scheduled to appear on the show, she did not show up, leaving him to wait live in front of millions of viewers.

In March 2004 he suffered an accident, breaking an ankle and requiring crutches.

In 2005, he was also nominated for a Mexican MTV Movie Award, being &quot;Favorite Actor&quot; (for his role in &quot;Puños rosas&quot;). He was also the host of the TV reality show &quot;Cantando por un sueño&quot; and &quot;Bailando por un Sueño&quot;.

In December 2006 he participated in the Mexican production of the Mel Brooks musical &quot;The Producers&quot; in the role of Leo Bloom.

On 8 May 2007 the series &quot;Otro Rollo con: Adal Ramones&quot; was broadcast for the last time.

He most recently began co-hosting the television series &quot;La vida es mejor cantando&quot;.

<doc id="324611" wikidata="Q6137869" url="?curid=324611" title="James Lawson (activist)">
<text>James Morris Lawson Jr. (September 22, 1928 – June 9, 2024) was an American activist and university professor. He was a leading theoretician and tactician of nonviolence within the Civil Rights Movement. During the 1960s, he served as a mentor to the Nashville Student Movement and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He was expelled from Vanderbilt University for his civil rights activism in 1960, and later served as a pastor in Los Angeles for 25 years.

==Early life and education==
Lawson was born to Philane May Cover and James Morris Lawson Sr. on September 22, 1928, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. He was the sixth out of nine children. He grew up in Massillon, Ohio. Both Lawson&#x27;s father and grandfather were Methodist ministers. Lawson received his ministry license in 1947 during his senior year of high school.

While a freshman at Baldwin Wallace College in Berea, Ohio, he studied sociology. Because of his refusal to serve in the US military when drafted, he was convicted of draft evasion and sentenced to two years in prison. He served 13 months of his sentence and returned to college, finishing his degree. He joined the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR), an organization led by A. J. Muste, and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), an organization affiliated with FOR. Both FOR and CORE advocated nonviolent resistance to racism.

He went as a Methodist missionary to Nagpur, India, where he studied satyagraha, a form of nonviolence resistance developed by Mohandas Gandhi and his followers. He returned to the United States in 1956, entering the Graduate School of Theology at Oberlin College in Ohio. One of his Oberlin professors introduced him to Martin Luther King Jr. who had also embraced Gandhi&#x27;s principles of nonviolent resistance. In 1957, King urged Lawson to move to the south telling him, &quot;Come now. We don&#x27;t have anyone like you down there.&quot; He moved to Nashville, where he attended Vanderbilt University and began teaching nonviolent protest techniques.

Lawson studied at Oberlin College from 1956 to 1957 and after being there for a year, he married Dorothy Wood and had three sons. He attended Vanderbilt from 1958 to 1960. Lawson was expelled from Vanderbilt in March 1960 for civil rights arrests, but received his S.T.B. from Boston University that same year. Lawson received a post as pastor of the Scott Church in Shelbyville, Tennessee.

==Leadership during the Civil Rights Movement==

Lawson moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and enrolled at the Divinity School of Vanderbilt University, where he served as the southern director for CORE and began conducting nonviolence training workshops for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in a church basement in 1958. While in Nashville, he met and mentored a number of young students at Vanderbilt, Fisk University, and other area schools in the tactics of nonviolent direct action. In Nashville, he trained many of the future leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, among them Diane Nash, James Bevel, Bernard Lafayette, Marion Barry, and John Lewis. In 1959 and 1960, they and other Lawson-trained activists launched the Nashville sit-ins to challenge segregation in downtown stores. In February 1960, following the lunch sit-ins by students at the Woolworth&#x27;s stores in Greensboro, North Carolina, Lawson and several others were arrested. Their actions led to desegregation of some lunch counters.

Lawson was expelled from Vanderbilt due to his participation in these activities. James Geddes Stahlman, the publisher of the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; who served on the university&#x27;s board of trust, published misleading stories that led to his expulsion. Another trustee, John Sloan, the president of Cain-Sloan, supported Stahlman&#x27;s suggestion to expel him. Under the intense pressure, Chancellor Harvie Branscomb enforced the decision. Branscomb later re-examined that action, regretting he did not consider referring the matter to a committee to delay action for three months until Lawson&#x27;s graduation. During the 2006 graduation ceremony, Vanderbilt apologized for its treatment of Lawson. Lawson returned to teach at Vanderbilt as a Distinguished Professor from 2006 to 2009. He donated his papers in 2013.

Lawson&#x27;s students played a leading role in the Open Theater Movement, the Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, Freedom Summer, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, the Children&#x27;s Crusade in Birmingham, the 1965 Selma Voting Rights Movement, the Chicago Freedom Movement, and the Anti-Vietnam War Movement over the next few years. In 1962, Lawson brought King and Bevel together for a meeting that resulted in the two agreeing to work together as equals. Bevel was then named SCLC&#x27;s Director of Direct Action and Director of Nonviolent Education.

In 1961, Lawson helped develop strategy for the Freedom Riders. Lawson encouraged the students to plan a second wave of Freedom Rides from Alabama to continue the work and Lawson joined the group. They arrived in Jackson safe, but when they filed into a &quot;whites only&quot; waiting room they were arrested. Lawson was among the first who was arrested during the Jackson Freedom Ride arrests. The NAACP offered to pay for bail, but Lawson and others refused bail and waited for trial. The judge found all 27 guilty and they remained in jail. Lawson and the Freedom Riders met with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and, in September 1961, President John F. Kennedy ordered that passengers be able to sit anywhere. 
Lawson became pastor of Centenary Methodist Church in Memphis, Tennessee in 1962. In 1968, when black sanitation workers began the Memphis sanitation strike for higher wages and union recognition after two of their co-workers were accidentally crushed to death, Reverend Lawson served as chairman of their strike committee. He co-founded the Committee on the Move to Equality (COME). Lawson extended an invitation to Dr. King to speak in Memphis. King delivered his famous &quot;I&#x27;ve Been to the Mountaintop&quot; speech, and was killed in Memphis in April 1968.

==Later career==
Lawson moved to Los Angeles in 1974, where he was pastor of Holman United Methodist Church. He retired in 1999, but continued his civil rights work. While in Los Angeles, he was active in the labor movement, the American Civil Liberties Union, and movements for reproductive choice and gay rights. He served as chairman of the Laity United for Economic Justice. During this time, Lawson hosted &quot;Lawson Live&quot;, a weekly call-in radio show, where he discussed human- and social-rights issues. He continued to train activists in nonviolence and supports immigrants&#x27; rights in the United States, the rights of Palestinians, and workers&#x27; rights to a living wage.

Lawson took part in a well-publicized three-day Freedom Ride commemorative program sponsored by Vanderbilt University&#x27;s Office of Active Citizenship and Service in January 2007. The program included an educational bus tour to Montgomery and Birmingham, Alabama. Participants also included fellow Civil Rights activists Jim Zwerg, Diane Nash, Bernard Lafayette, C. T. Vivian and John Seigenthaler; journalists and approximately 180 students, faculty and administrators from Vanderbilt, Fisk, Tennessee State University and American Baptist College.
He spearheaded California State University Northridge&#x27;s (CSUN) Civil Discourse and Social Change initiative as a visiting faculty member for the academic year of 2010/11, where he continued to serve as a visiting scholar teaching a semester-long course on nonviolence until his death in 2024. The initiative built on CSUN&#x27;s history of activism and diversity, while focusing on the current budget and policy battles surrounding education. Lawson helped bring perspective, knowledge, and strategic thinking to the campus.

The International Center on Nonviolent Conflict held an eight-day program on civil resistance facilitated by Lawson in Nashville in 2013 and 2014. A class taught by Lawson, Kent Wong, Kelly Lytle Hernandez, and Ana Luz Gonzalez inspired UCLA students to publish &quot;Nonviolence and Social Movements&quot;, a book that focuses on the principles of nonviolence and social change that Lawson taught.

==Death==
Lawson died at a hospital in Los Angeles, on June 9, 2024, at the age of 95. This was the night before the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964&#x27;s filibuster breaking.

==Honors==
In 2004, he received the Community of Christ International Peace Award. On December 10, 2021, UCLA announced the renaming of the UCLA Labor Center building next to MacArthur Park as the UCLA James M. Lawson, Jr. Labor Center, in honor of his longstanding commitment to the advancement of worker rights and the wellbeing of laborers.

On April 24, 2019, as a result of nomination by council member Nick Fish, the Portland Oregon mayor and city council declared that day the Reverend James Lawson Jr. Day in a ceremony at City Hall. That night Rev. Lawson delivered the keynote address to the public at Portland State University, beginning five days of the 6th James Lawson Institute, organized by peace scholar and former SNCC Communications Co-Director (with Julian Bond) Mary E. King.

On July 28, 2023, James Lawson High School opened in Nashville, Tennessee. A of Adams Boulevard near Holman United Methodist Church was renamed in his honor in 2024.

==In media==
Lawson was portrayed in the 2013 motion picture &quot;The Butler&quot; by actor Jesse Williams. The film chronicles Lawson&#x27;s training sessions during the civil rights protests of the 1950s and 1960s. Lawson was the subject of the film &quot;Love and Solidarity: Rev. James Lawson and Nonviolence in the Search for Workers Rights&quot; by Michael K. Honey. The film is an introduction to Lawson&#x27;s contributions to labor rights struggles and the civil rights movement.

<text>The short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) is a widespread grassland species in the family Strigidae. Owls belonging to genus &quot;Asio&quot; are known as the eared owls, as they have tufts of feathers resembling mammalian ears. These &quot;ear&quot; tufts may or may not be visible. The short-eared owl will display its tufts when in a defensive pose, although its very short tufts are usually not visible. The short-eared owl is found in open country and grasslands.

==Taxonomy==
The short-eared owl was formally described in 1763 by the Lutheran bishop Erik Pontoppidan under the binomial name &quot;Strix flammea&quot;. The specific epithet is from the Latin &quot;flammeus&quot; meaning &quot;flammulated&quot; or &quot;flame-coloured&quot;. This owl is now placed with seven other species in the genus &quot;Asio&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760.

Eleven subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. f. flammeus&quot; – : the nominate subspecies, found in North America, Europe, North Africa and northern Asia
* &quot;A. f. cubensis&quot; – : found in Cuba
* &quot;A. f. domingensis&quot; – : found on Hispaniola
* &quot;A. f. portoricensis&quot; – : found in Puerto Rico
* &quot;A. f. bogotensis&quot; – : found in Colombia, Ecuador and northwestern Peru
* &quot;A. f. galapagoensis&quot; – : found on the Galápagos Islands
* &quot;A. f. pallidicaudus&quot; – : found in Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname
* &quot;A. f. suinda&quot; – : found from southern Peru and southern Brazil to Tierra del Fuego
* &quot;A. f. sanfordi&quot; – : found on the Falkland Islands
* &quot;A. f. sandwichensis&quot; – : Pueo or Hawaiian short-eared owl - found on the Hawaiian Islands
* &quot;A. f. ponapensis&quot; – : found on Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands

==Description==
The short-eared owl is a medium-sized owl measuring in length and weighing . It has large eyes, a big head, a short neck, and broad wings. Its bill is short, strong, hooked and black. Its plumage is mottled tawny to brown with a barred tail and wings. The upper breast is significantly streaked. Its flight is characteristically floppy due to its irregular wingbeats. The short-eared owl may also be described as &quot;moth or bat-like&quot; in flight. Wingspans range from . Females are slightly larger than males. The yellow-orange eyes of &quot;A. flammeus&quot; are exaggerated by black rings encircling each eye, giving the appearance of them wearing mascara, and large, whitish disks of plumage surrounding the eyes like a mask.

===Calls===
Short-eared owls have a scratchy bark-like call. Raspy &quot;waowk, waowk, waowk&quot; or &quot;toot-toot-toot-toot-toot&quot; sounds are common. A loud &quot;eeee-yerp&quot; is also heard on breeding grounds. However, short-eared owls are silent on the wintering grounds.

===Separation from the long-eared owl===
Through much of its range, short-eared owls occurs with the similar-looking long-eared owl. At rest, the ear-tufts of the long-eared owl serve to easily distinguish the two (although long-eared owls can sometimes hold their ear-tufts flat). The iris-colour differs: yellow in the short-eared, and orange in the long-eared, and the black surrounding the eyes is vertical on the long-eared, and horizontal on the short-eared. Overall the short-eared tends to be a paler, sandier bird than the long-eared. There are a number of other ways in which the two species the differ which are best seen when they are flying: a) the short-eared often has a broad white band along the rear edge of the wing, which is not shown by the long-eared; b) on the upperwing, short-eared owls&#x27; primary-patches are usually paler and more obvious; c) the band on the upper side of the short-eared owl&#x27;s tail are usually bolder than those of the long-eared; d) the short-eared&#x27;s innermost secondaries are often dark-marked, contrasting with the rest of the underwing; e) the long-eared owl has streaking throughout its underparts, whereas on the short-eared the streaking ends at the breast; f) the dark markings on the underside of the tips of the longest primaries are bolder on the short-eared owl; g) the upper parts are coarsely blotched, whereas on the long-eared they are more finely marked. The short-eared owl also differs structurally from the long-eared, having longer, slimmer wings: the long-eared owl has wings shaped more like those of a tawny owl. The long-eared owl generally has different habitat preferences from the short-eared, most often being found concealed in areas with dense wooded thickets. The short-eared owl is often most regularly seen flying about in early morning or late day as it hunts over open habitats.

==Distribution and habitat==

The short-eared owl occurs on all continents except Antarctica and Australia; thus it has one of the most widespread distributions of any bird. &quot;A. flammeus&quot; breeds in Europe, Asia, North and South America, the Caribbean, Hawaii and the Galápagos Islands. It is partially migratory, moving south in winter from the northern parts of its range. The short-eared owl is known to relocate to areas of higher rodent populations. It will also wander nomadically in search of better food supplies during years when vole populations are low. (See a map of the short-eared owl&#x27;s distribution across the New World.)

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
Sexual maturity is attained at one year. Breeding season in the northern hemisphere lasts from March to June, peaking in April. During this time these owls may gather in flocks. During breeding season, the males make great spectacles of themselves in flight to attract females. The male swoops down over the nest flapping its wings in a courtship display. These owls are generally monogamous.

The short-eared owl nests on the ground in prairie, tundra, savanna, or meadow habitats. Nests are concealed by low vegetation, and may be lightly lined by weeds, grass, or feathers. Approximately 4 to 7 white eggs are found in a typical clutch, but clutch size can reach up to a dozen eggs in years when voles are abundant. There is one brood per year. The eggs are incubated mostly by the female for 21–37 days. Offspring fledge at a little over four weeks. This owl is known to lure predators away from its nest by appearing to have a crippled wing.

===Food and feeding===

Hunting occurs mostly at night, but this owl is known to be diurnal and crepuscular as well. Its daylight hunting seems to coincide with the high-activity periods of voles, its preferred prey. It tends to fly only feet above the ground in open fields and grasslands until swooping down upon its prey feet-first. Several owls may hunt over the same open area. Its food consists mainly of rodents, especially voles, but it will eat other small mammals such as rabbits, mice, ground squirrels, shrews, rats, bats, muskrats and moles. It will also occasionally depredate smaller birds, especially when near sea-coasts and adjacent wetlands at which time they attack shorebirds, terns and small gulls and seabirds with semi-regularity. Avian prey is more infrequently preyed on inland and centers on passerines such as larks, icterids, starlings, tyrant flycatchers and pipits. Insects supplement the diet and short-eared owls may prey on roaches, grasshoppers, beetles, katydids and caterpillars. Competition can be fierce in North America with the northern harrier, with which the owl shares similar habitat and prey preferences. Both species will readily harass the other when prey is caught.

Because of the high pH in the stomach of owls they have a reduced ability to digest bone and other hard parts, so they eject pellets containing the remains of their prey.

==Conservation status==
The short-eared owl has an estimated global population of 1,200,000 to 2,100,000 and a very large range. On that basis, it is evaluated by the IUCN as a species of least concern.

It is listed as declining in the southern portion of its United States range. It is common in the northern portion of its breeding range. It is listed as endangered in New Mexico. Its appearance at the Calverton Executive Airpark on Long Island has prompted the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to take the lead on ruling whether a massive redevelopment of the airport will receive the necessary environmental permits.

<doc id="324616" wikidata="Q838154" url="?curid=324616" title="My Cousin Vinny">
<text>My Cousin Vinny is a 1992 American comedy film directed by Jonathan Lynn from a screenplay by Dale Launer. It stars Joe Pesci, Ralph Macchio, Marisa Tomei, Mitchell Whitfield, Lane Smith, Bruce McGill, and Fred Gwynne in his final film appearance before his death. The film was distributed by 20th Century Fox, and released in the United States on March 13, 1992.

Macchio and Whitfield play William Gambini and Stanley Rothenstein, two young New Yorkers who are arrested in Alabama and put on trial for a murder they did not commit. Unable to afford a lawyer, they are defended by Gambini&#x27;s cousin Vinny Gambini (Pesci), newly admitted to the bar, who arrives with his fiancée, Mona Lisa Vito (Tomei). The clash between the brash Italian-American New Yorkers and the more reserved Southern townspeople provides much of the film&#x27;s humor. The principal location of filming was Monticello, Georgia.

&quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; was a critical and financial success, with Pesci, Gwynne, Macchio and Tomei praised for their performances. Tomei won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Attorneys have also lauded the film for its accurate depiction of criminal procedure and trial strategy.

==Plot==
While driving through Alabama, New York college students Bill Gambini and Stan Rothenstein stop at a convenience store, during which Bill accidentally shoplifts a can of tuna. After they leave, the boys are pulled over and arrested as the shopkeeper has been found robbed and murdered. At the police station, Bill assumes he has been arrested for shoplifting and confesses to being responsible, resulting in him being charged with first-degree murder and Stan as an accessory. Unable to afford a private lawyer, Bill asks for help from his cousin Vinny Gambini, a personal injury lawyer from Brooklyn, who agrees to help the boys. However, they are unaware that Vinny has only just passed the bar to become a lawyer, after multiple failed attempts, and has no trial experience. Vinny promptly arrives in Alabama with his fiancée Mona Lisa Vito.

Vinny fools the trial judge, Chamberlain Haller, into believing he is an experienced New York lawyer who works under the alias Jerry Callo. Haller repeatedly holds Vinny in contempt for his unprofessional attire, attitude, and ignorance of courtroom decorum, resulting in brief stints in jail. The prosecuting district attorney, Jim Trotter III, presents a strong—although circumstantial—case against the boys, offering multiple witnesses to their involvement in the murder. Bill and Stan become concerned when Vinny declines to cross-examine the witnesses during the preliminary hearing, resulting in Stan firing Vinny and hiring the public defender, John Gibbons.

Vinny&#x27;s inexperience with the legal system leads him to try to trick Trotter into sharing his evidence until Lisa tells Vinny that he legally can access the prosecution&#x27;s evidence and prompts him to interview the witnesses, which he does. She grows frustrated with Vinny as he promised several years earlier that they would get married when he wins his first case and is worried he never will. Vinny is also eager to prove himself to his mentor Judge Malloy, who convinced him to go into law.

During the trial, Gibbons&#x27;s nerves and severe stutter only further damage Stan&#x27;s defense. Meanwhile, Vinny uses an aggressive but perceptive questioning style to discredit Trotter&#x27;s witnesses, using his knowledge of the cooking time of grits to force one to admit that his perception of when the crime occurred is inaccurate, and the others by questioning their ability to positively identify the suspects due to obstructions in their sightline and impaired vision. Stan promptly rehires Vinny to defend him.

The next day, Trotter produces a surprise witness, FBI analyst George Wilbur, who testifies that tire markings at the crime scene match those on the boys&#x27; 1964 Buick Skylark, although Vinny makes him admit that the tires are the most used in America. Haller orders a lunch recess and denies Vinny&#x27;s request for a full day&#x27;s continuance to properly counter Wilbur&#x27;s testimony. Stressed by lack of sleep, Haller&#x27;s hostility, low funds, and the prospect of losing the case, Vinny lashes out at Lisa&#x27;s efforts to help, but realizes that one of the photos she has taken during their stay, showing the tire marks at the scene, may help the case.

After asking the local sheriff for a favor, Vinny drags an angry Lisa into court to testify as an expert witness as she and her family have worked as mechanics and she has an encyclopedic knowledge of cars. Looking at the photo, Lisa realizes that only the 1963 Pontiac Tempest, which resembles a Buick Skylark, could have made the tire tracks, thanks to its independent rear suspension and Positraction. Vinny recalls Wilbur who confirms this information, discrediting his own testimony. The sheriff arrives and testifies that, following Vinny&#x27;s request, he identified two men fitting Bill&#x27;s and Stan&#x27;s descriptions who have been arrested in Georgia for driving a stolen Pontiac Tempest and were in possession of a gun matching the murder weapon. His case dismantled, Trotter requests that Haller dismiss all charges. Bill, Stan, the Sheriff, Trotter, and Haller congratulate Vinny on his success. Driving away, Lisa admits that she had Judge Malloy help convince Haller of Jerry Callo&#x27;s &quot;successful&quot; legal career, before she and Vinny bicker about their wedding plans.

==Cast==
==Development==
Screenwriter Dale Launer came up with the idea for &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; as a college student, after hearing about a lawyer who had finally passed the bar after their 13th attempt. Launer thought it would be funny to have someone traveling through the Southern United States run into legal trouble and end up being represented by that type of lawyer. Launer did not develop the concept until after he had written a few successful screenplays, including &quot;Ruthless People&quot; and &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot;. He was inspired by the comedy of Sam Kinison, particularly his approach with hecklers, in developing Vinny, and he based the relationship between Vinny and his fiancée on two dating friends who would argue frequently. Launer also took a road trip through the South in which he got stuck in the mud and had repairs to fix his car, which became part of the script. He met an assistant district attorney who became the basis of the character of Jim Trotter, including casting Lane Smith for the role. He spent several sessions with an attorney to review the process of legal trials, and learned from him that much of criminal court proceedings are not taught in law school but come from practice, which served well for Vinny&#x27;s character.

For casting, the studio originally wanted Andrew Dice Clay for Vinny, but this did not work out. Other considerations included Danny DeVito, Peter Falk, Robert De Niro, and Jim Belushi, but save for De Niro and DeVito, none of these were the Italian American they were looking for. They eventually cast Joe Pesci, who had just finished &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot;, was finishing filming in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, and was an ideal choice for the role. For Mona Lisa, they had approached Lorraine Bracco and Carole Davis, but both had passed on the role. Director Jonathan Lynn auditioned several other actresses, but found Marisa Tomei when he was invited to the set of the movie &quot;Oscar&quot; by John Landis, where Tomei had a minor part. While Fox wanted an actress with more fame, they agreed to Tomei. Ben Stiller and Will Smith were considered for the roles of Bill and Stan but, in both cases, there was concern related to the incarceration of a Jewish and Black person in the South, and Ralph Macchio and Mitchell Whitfield were hired instead.

Exterior filming was done near the town of Greensboro, Georgia; the exterior shots of the courthouse and the surrounding square were shot in Monticello, Georgia, and the courthouse scenes were shot in a set in Covington, Georgia, used for &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. The prison scenes were shot in a real, working prison (Lee Arrendale State Prison in Alto, Georgia) and the prisoners appearing as extras were actual convicts.

==Reception==
===Box office===
With a budget of $11 million, &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; was more successful than anticipated, grossing $52,929,168 domestically and $11,159,384 internationally, bringing its overall worldwide total to $64,088,552.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 85%, based on 61 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;The deft comic interplay between Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei helps to elevate &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; predictable script, and the result is a sharp, hilarious courtroom comedy.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; 2.5 stars out of a possible 4. He declared that despite Macchio&#x27;s co-star billing, the actor was given little to do, and the film seemed adrift until &quot;lightning strikes&quot; with the final courtroom scenes, when Gwynne, Pesci, and Tomei all gave humorous performances. Ebert&#x27;s television partner, Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, liked the film more, singling out Dale Launer&#x27;s screenplay for praise.

===Awards and nominations===
===Continuing reputation===
Despite the good-but-not-great initial reviews, &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; is generally considered to have held up as one of the most remembered and watched movies of the 1990s. The movie performed well in home video sales and rentals (originally VHS, and eventually DVD) and received frequent play on cable television. The film&#x27;s catchier quotes became well known as well.

One element that aged somewhat awkwardly was Austin Pendleton&#x27;s role as a stuttering and ineffective public defender. Pendleton suffered from stuttering in his childhood before overcoming it; during filming he did not enjoy dredging up bad memories from his teenage years and, afterward, he was not pleased to be publicly associated with the character. In a 2022 interview, he said that he felt the role nearly ended his career, and, after receiving angry letters from stutterers, said he regretted agreeing to perform the role at all. Casting director David Rubin said that Pendleton&#x27;s scenes, while funny, probably would have been changed significantly in a newer movie.

==Legal accuracy==
The film&#x27;s director, Jonathan Lynn, has an English law degree from the University of Cambridge, and lawyers have praised the accuracy of &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;″s depiction of courtroom procedure and trial strategy, with one stating that &quot;[t]he movie is close to reality even in its details. Part of why the film has such staying power among lawyers is because, unlike, say, &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, everything that happens in the movie &quot;could&quot; happen—and often &quot;does&quot; happen—at trial&quot;. One legal textbook discusses the film in detail as an &quot;entertaining [and] extremely helpful introduction to the art of presenting expert witnesses at trial for both beginning experts and litigators&quot;; furthermore, criminal defenders, law professors, and other lawyers use the film to demonstrate rules of evidence, voir dire, relevance, and cross examination.

Judge Richard Posner of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, one of the most prominent American federal judges of the late 20th century, praised &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; as being:

In &quot;Ten Things Every Trial Lawyer Could Learn From Vincent La Guardia Gambini&quot;, federal judge Joseph F. Anderson praised Vinny&#x27;s courtroom methods as &quot;a textbook example&quot; of Irving Younger&#x27;s &quot;Ten Commandments of Cross-Examination&quot;, and wrote that the film predicted the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1999 decision &quot;Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael&quot; and its holding regarding the &quot;Daubert&quot; standard, which governs when expert witnesses can testify in U.S. federal trials. He concluded that Lynn and scriptwriter Dale Launer &quot;have given our profession a wonderful teaching tool while producing a gem of a movie that gives the public at large renewed faith in the common law trial and the adversarial system as the best way to determine the truth and achieve justice&quot;. In a 2019 decision, Merrick Garland, then the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, wrote &quot;In 1992, Vincent Gambini taught a master class in cross-examination,&quot; and further extensively quoted from a cross-examination scene in the film.

John Marshall Law School professor Alberto Bernabe wrote that &quot;Vinny is terrible at the things we do teach in law school, but very good at the things we don&#x27;t&quot;:

United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia cited &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; as an example of the principle that a client can choose his own lawyer, but United States Senator John Kennedy told District Court nominee Matthew S. Petersen that having seen the film did not qualify one to be a federal judge during his failed 2017 confirmation hearing. The authors of &quot;Reel Justice: The Courtroom Goes to the Movies&quot; (2006) gave the film its highest rating along with several films based on real trials, such as &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; and &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;. In 2008 the &quot;ABA Journal&quot; ranked the film #3 on its list of the &quot;25 Greatest Legal Movies&quot;, and in 2010 ranked Pesci&#x27;s character as #12 on its list of &quot;The 25 Greatest Fictional Lawyers (Who Are Not Atticus Finch)&quot;.

Lynn, an opponent of capital punishment, believes that the film expresses an anti-death penalty message without &quot;preaching to people&quot;, and demonstrates the unreliability of eyewitness testimony. Lawyers find the film appealing, according to the director, because &quot;there aren&#x27;t any bad guys&quot;, with the judge, prosecutor, and Vinny all seeking justice. Lynn stated that both he and Launer attempted to accurately depict the legal process in &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;, favorably comparing it to &quot;Trial and Error&quot;, for which he could not make what he believed were necessary changes.

==Sequels==
===Proposed film===
In an interview on March 14, 2012, the film&#x27;s screenwriter, Dale Launer, talked about a sequel he had written involving Vinny Gambini practicing law in England. Marisa Tomei dropped out. The studio hired another screenwriter to rework the script without Tomei&#x27;s character. Eventually, the project was shelved.

===Novel series===
In 2017, author Lawrence Kelter began a &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; novel series with &quot;Back to Brooklyn&quot;, which is intended to be in the spirit of &quot;The Thin Man&quot; series. With the setting updated to contemporary times, the series depicts the further cases of Vinny Gambini with Mona Lisa operating as his investigator. After additionally writing a novelization of &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; alongside the first sequel, a third book, titled &quot;Wing and a Prayer&quot;, was published in August 2020.

==Album==
Pesci reprised the Vinny Gambini character for his 1998 album &quot;Vincent LaGuardia Gambini Sings Just for You&quot;, which contains the song &quot;Yo, Cousin Vinny&quot;. The album cover portrays Pesci in a red suit similar to the usher suit he wore in the film.

<text>The History of United States Naval Operations in World War II is a 15-volume account of the United States Navy in World War II, written by Samuel Eliot Morison and published by Little, Brown and Company between 1947 and 1962.

==Background==
Immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Morison, already convinced of the value of personal involvement as a result of sailing experience while writing his biography of Christopher Columbus, wrote to President Roosevelt suggesting the preparation of an official history of the Navy in the war, and volunteering for the task. Both President Roosevelt and the Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox agreed, and in May 1942 Morison was commissioned as a lieutenant commander in the United States Naval Reserve, and assigned a staff of assistants, with permission to go anywhere and to see all official records. Morison&#x27;s reputation as a knowledgeable sailor (based on his analysis in the biography of Christopher Columbus) preceded him, and he was welcomed on a number of ships, eleven of them in all by the end of the war.

The result was a normal historical work, not a prescribed official history. James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy 1944–47, wrote: &quot;The Navy Department has done everything possible to enable him [Morison] to make his research exhaustive and to afford him firsthand impressions. This work, however, is in no sense an official history. The form, style, and character of the narrative are the author&#x27;s own. The opinions expressed and the conclusions reached are those of Dr. Morison, and of him alone. He has been subject to no restrictions other than those imposed by the necessity of safeguarding information which might endanger national security.&quot; 

The limitations of the &quot;History of U.S. Naval Operations&quot; primarily stem from its publication shortly after the end of the war, as Morison himself acknowledged. He recognized that any history written in such proximity to the events it describes cannot claim complete objectivity or definitive accuracy. New facts may emerge later, and discarded information may become relevant in new interpretations. Despite these challenges, Morison argued that writing close to the events, while participants are still alive, offers greater insights than waiting until later, when the physical artifacts are gone and firsthand accounts are lost. In his words: &quot;Historians in years to come may shoot this book full of holes; but they can never recapture the feeling of desperate urgency in our planning and preparations, of the excitement of battle, of exultation over a difficult operation successfully concluded, of sorrow for shipmates who did not live to enjoy the victory.&quot; 

Some material, especially related to codebreaking, was then still classified, and later in-depth research into particular occurrences in the war did clarify points that had been passed over rather lightly. Some rewriting was incorporated in the later printings of this series. This &quot;History of U.S. Naval Operations&quot; also intentionally avoided a certain amount of analysis, for instance deferring to other works for the causes of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The intended audience for the work, to quote from the preface, was &quot;the general reader rather than the professional sailor.&quot;

This &quot;History of U.S. Naval Operations&quot; also played an indirect role in the history of television. One of Morison&#x27;s research assistants in the project, Henry Salomon, knew NBC&#x27;s Robert Sarnoff and, in 1949, first proposed an ambitious documentary TV series on U.S. Navy and Marine Corps warfare in World War II. In 1951 the National Broadcasting Company hired Salomon to produce what would become the 1952–1953 TV series, &quot;Victory at Sea&quot;. The success of this TV series played a major role in establishing the historic documentary—using combat footage—as a viable television genre.

<text>The long-eared owl (Asio otus), also known as the northern long-eared owl or, more informally, as the lesser horned owl or cat owl, is a medium-sized species of owl with an extensive breeding range. The genus name, &quot;Asio&quot;, is Latin for &quot;horned owl&quot;, and the specific epithet, &quot;otus&quot;, is derived from Greek and refers to a small eared owl. The species breeds in many areas through Europe and the Palearctic, as well as in North America. This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as typical owls, of the family Strigidae, which contains most extant species of owl.

This owl shows a partiality for semi-open habitats, particularly woodland edge, as they prefer to roost and nest within dense stands of wood but prefer to hunt over open ground. The long-eared owl is a somewhat specialized predator, focusing its diet almost entirely on small rodents, especially voles, which quite often compose most of their diet. Under some circumstances, such as population cycles of their regular prey, arid or insular regional habitats or urbanization, this species can adapt fairly well to a diversity of prey, including birds and insects. All owls do not build their own nests. In the case of the long-eared owl, it generally utilizes nests that are built by other animals, with a partiality in many regions for those built by corvids. Breeding success in this species is largely correlated with prey populations and predation risks. Unlike many owls, long-eared owls are not strongly territorial or sedentary. They are partially migratory and, although owls appear to generally use the same migratory routes and wintering sites annually, can tend to appear so erratically that they are sometimes characterized as “nomadic”. Another fairly unique characteristic of this species is its partiality for regular roosts that are often shared by a number of long-eared owls at once. The long-eared owl is one of the most widely distributed and most numerous owl species in the world, and due to its very broad range and numbers it is considered a least concern species by the IUCN. Nonetheless, strong declines have been detected for this owl in several parts of its range.

==Taxonomy==
The long-eared owl was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Strix otus&quot;. This owl is now assigned to the genus &quot;Asio&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760.

Owls in the genus &quot;Asio&quot; are sometimes commonly referred to as eared owls. Despite their extensive distribution, only eight modern species are thought to exist. Four species are found both in Eurasia and Africa, and in the Americas, including the long-eared owl and short-eared owl. Despite similarities and being considered as in the same genus, it was found in a study utilizing electrophoresis that the genetic distance between long-eared owls and short-eared owls was unusually large for species within the same genera. Notwithstanding fossil records of &quot;Asio&quot; species showing their presence during prehistory in locations like Kansas and Idaho (&quot;Asio brevipes&quot;) and California (&quot;Asio priscus&quot;), the exact area of evolutionary origin of the long-eared owl is unknown and unlikely to ever be known. At least three modern species represent related derivations, possibly with long-eared owls as the paraspecies or as part of a species complex that potentially bears a basal common ancestor. In all three cases, the related owls are obviously more tropical in distribution and adapted to more humid conditions, with darker plumage, and larger bodies with apparently stronger feet and more overdeveloped talons, possibly exploiting a relatively unoccupied ecological niche against competing owls. One of these three is the Stygian owl, which is the darkest derivation of all and readily known to be distinct for some time. The other two slightly larger, tropical species, possibly housed in a species complex with the long-eared owl, were at one time considered to be part of the long-eared owl species. One of these is the Madagascar owl (&quot;Asio madagascariensis&quot;), obviously endemic to the island of its name, while the other is the Abyssinian owl (&quot;Asio abyssinicus&quot;), native to east Africa, especially in the northern area such as Ethiopia. While the marsh owl of Africa is outwardly very similar to and likely closely related to the short-eared owl, the striped owl (&quot;Asio clamator&quot;) is somewhat of an outlier among living &quot;Asio&quot; species and of mysterious origin. Despite being genetically related to the other living &quot;Asio&quot; species, it does not appear to be a close cousin. Studies of the mitochondrial genome found that the &quot;Asio&quot; genus, and consequently the long-eared owl, diverged most recently among living owl groups from the &quot;Otus&quot; or scops owl genus, with a more distant branch division from the &quot;Strix&quot; genus. A study of the genetic homogeny of long-eared owls in a single roost site was shown to be slightly higher than between different roosts. However, this homogeny is relatively low for a communal roosting bird in general.

===Subspecies===
Four subspecies of the long-eared owl are recognised:

*&quot;A. o. otus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – This is the nominate subspecies and is distributed throughout the species&#x27; range in the Palearctic. It may be found as far west as the Azores, northwestern Africa, the Iberian Peninsula and the British Isles through as far east as Sakhalin, Japan and northern China. Some populations of this race may winter as far south as Egypt, Pakistan, northern India and southern China. The wing chord of the nominate subspecies ranges between and the tail length may be between . Size appears to increase slightly from west to east, with owls in China being about 4% larger winged than those from Europe. Despite there being no known published weights for eastern/Chinese long-eared owls, they appear to obtain the largest sizes within the species. In this subspecies, the facial disc tends to be pale ochraceous tawny, rimmed black with relatively short eyebrows that are marked whitish or absent entirely of markings. The erectile ear-tufts are prominent, being colored mainly blackish-brown with tawny edges. The upperparts are ochraceous-tawny, finely peppered with dusky spots and blackish streaks on a grey &quot;veil&quot;, while the crown is finely mottled to dusky. The nape and hindneck bear dusky shaft-streaks with the feather outer webs of the scapulars being whitish, forming a row across the shoulder. Primaries basally are uniformly ochraceous-tawny, distally barred light and dark, while the secondaries are barred ochraceous and dusky. The tail is typically tawny with a greyish wash, overlaid with 6-8 very narrow dark brown bars. The underparts have a base colour of ochre, with the foreneck and upper breast marked with blackish-brown streaks; these become paler below and marked with dusky shaft-streaks and narrow cross-bars. The underwing has distinctive barring and dark comma-like markings at the wrist (conspicuously lacking on overlapping Eurasian short-eared owls). The eyes tend to be yellowish-orange to orange, but occasionally may be chrome yellow. The cere is brownish-flesh, the bill is grey and the talons are blackish-grey. In this subspecies, the downy chick is whitish with pink skin, while the mesoptile plumage is fluffy greyish to brownish-white with diffusely barred dusky flight and tail feathers, being similar to adults but with the ear-tufts not yet developed.
*&quot;A. o. canariensis&quot; (Madarász, 1901) – This subspecies is endemic to the Canary Islands. With a wing chord measurement of , this is seemingly the smallest subspecies of the long-eared owl. This race averages darker than most long-eared owls of the nominate subspecies, bearing heavier and sharper dark markings overall. Furthermore, the Canary Island long-eared owls tend to have brighter reddish-orange eyes.
*&quot;A. o. wilsonianus&quot; (Lesson, 1830) – This subspecies is found in south-central and southeastern Canada (Manitoba to Nova Scotia) to southern USA (north Oklahoma and Virginia). The wing chord typically measures . In general, American long-eared owls are more vividly marked than many Eurasian populations. The facial disc is bright rufous, with a strong blackish rim and extensive white about the disc. The eyes are typically a deep yellow. Meanwhile, the markings on the underside usually are quite blackish and prominent with distinct cross-bars.
*&quot;A. o. tuftsi&quot; Godfrey, 1948 – The range is from western Canada (southern Yukon to southwest Manitoba) to south-central USA (west Texas). It differs from &quot;A. o. wilsonianus&quot; in having paler plumage. The brown mottling on upper parts is paler and more restricted. It is weakly differentiated and may comprise clinal variations due to region and habitat, rather than subspecific differences.

==Description==

This species is a rather slim and long winged owl with usually prominent erectile ear tufts, which are positioned closer to the center of the head than in many other types of owl. The purposes of ear tufts are not definitively known and are present in about half of living owls. Arguably the most popular theory amongst biologists and ornithologists is that ear tufts could be a means of intraspecies communication of intent and mood. In general coloration, the long-eared owl is often considered a hue of ochraceous-tawny with a grayish or brownish wash variably manifesting. The base color is commonly overlaid with variable blackish vertical streaks (and occasionally spots), which are usually more apparent about the wings and back. The scapulars are usually marked whitish, which provide further contrast when seen against the base color and blackish markings. The wing&#x27;s dark carpal patches can also display broad panels of buff or almost orange on the wings across the base of primaries, which represent a more richly emphasized version of a pattern shared with other owls that tend to be vole-hunting specialists, like short-eared owls (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;) and great gray owl (&quot;Strix nebulosa&quot;). On the underside, the body tends to be a somewhat paler ochraceous-tawny compared to the upperside. Long-eared owls tend to have dusky streaks on the upper breast, below which they may be heavily marked with herring bone pattern (which is created by dusky shaft-streaks and crossbars on these feathers). There is much individual and regional variation in markings with owls dwelling in more extensively forested regions tending to be of a darker hue, often so densely washed above as to appear largely dusky brown on the back and the underside largely overlaid with bolder dusky-blackish marks. Meanwhile, in some desert-like regions, the plumage may tend towards a somewhat more washed out look, at times appearing fairly cream or yellowish, with sparser and lighter dusky markings overall. The facial disc is visibly well developed and variably colored (see subspecies) in the species, rimmed dusky often with white running down along the center through the bill, while at times the white lines form a “moustache” and/or extending to the inside of the facial disc rim. The ear tufts are usually dusky in front and paler tawny on the back. Long-eared owl possess a blackish bill color while its eyes may vary from yellowish-orange to orange-red, tarsi and toes feathered.

The long-eared owl is a medium-sized owl, which measures between in total length. Their wingspan is relatively large for their size, measuring . However, compared to other widespread owls considered of medium size and to which they can appear broadly similar in size, such as barn owl (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;), short-eared owls and tawny owls (&quot;Strix aluco&quot;), the long-eared owl is quite a bit lighter and slenderer bodied, with mature weights around half of those of tawny owls not being uncommon. As expected in owls and birds of prey in general, long-eared owls display reverse sexual dimorphism in which females are usually slightly larger than males (to the contrary of most non-raptorial birds). Males furthermore may tend to be somewhat paler in plumage than females. In Finland, one survey of the body mass of mature birds found that 22 males averaged while 20 females averaged . In body mass, European long-eared owls per a study were shown to run contrary to Bergmann&#x27;s rule (that widespread animals should be smaller closer to the Equator) as body mass seemed to increase further south, being lightest in Sweden, where 37 males averaged and 24 females averaged , intermediate in Denmark and heaviest in the Netherlands, where 21 males averaged and 24 females averaged . In migratory owls largely from Scandinavian summer grounds in England, the average weight of 8 males was and the average of 28 females was . Meanwhile, in various studies in North America, 38 males (in Montana) were found to average , 55 males (also Montana in a different study) to average and 15 males (from Idaho) . From the same studies, respectively, 28 females averaged , 49 females averaged and 19 females averaged . Museum specimens in North America were found to average in 38 males and in 28 females, while 520 migrating adults in Duluth, Minnesota averaged . In all, long-eared owl males may vary in weight from while females may vary from . 
In standard measurements, long-eared owls vary in wing chord length from in males, with 883 in North America averaging , and in females, with 520 American ones averaging . The tail may measure in males and in females, with 1,408 owls averaging . Less widely measured are bill length, which averaged in males and in females from North America, and tarsus length, which averaged in 20 males and for 16 females from Europe, with a range in both sexes of . In terms of their skeletal structure, it bears a relatively wide skull but relatively small eyes and orbits, while the beak is relatively elongated but weak. The legs are relatively long and thin and, while needle-sharp, the talons are relatively fine and the feet relatively weak for an owl. However, the talons are still highly proficient at drawing blood if contact is made with human skin.

===Identification===

If seen well, an experienced observer is usually able to distinguish a long-eared owl by combination of its field marks, size and coloration. However, some potential owl species may be confused for them. The Stygian owl (&quot;Asio stygius&quot;) (which barely overlaps, perhaps in northern Mexico) is larger with partially bare toes and generally darker with inky and more boldly patterned plumage, with often nearly the enter facial mask appearing off-black. Tawny owls, which co-exist with long-eared owls in Eurasia, are unlikely to be mistaken given that they usually appear considerably rounder and bulkier overall (and are indeed slightly larger and much heavier), and possess a much broader, more rounded head. The tawny owl has no ear-tufts, eyes of blackish-brown colour and relatively shorter wings. In flight, tawny owls show well-fingered primaries (with five apparent emarginations) unlike the squared off wings of the long-eared owl. The Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;) is far larger and more massive than a long-eared owl with visibly more overdeveloped and powerful-looking feet and talons and a huge squared-off-looking head with the ear-tufts set nearer to the edge. The eagle-owl is often more heavily patterned on the crown and back with heavy blackish marking but has a less strongly demarcated (and shallower) facial disc when compared to the long-eared owl. In some parts of the wintering range, other eagle-owls may scarcely abut the wide range of long-eared owls in Eurasia (and perhaps northwestern Africa) but are usually distinguishable (similarly as in the Eurasian species) by size differences, plumage characteristics and, occasionally, habitat preferences. Asian fish owls, which are essentially a subset of eagle-owls, are generally also much larger than long-eared owls with tousled-looking ear-tufts, less variable coloring and often feathered over only part of their tarsi. In North America, great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), yet another type of eagle-owl in all but name, have a squarish head and more widely separated ear-tufts. Like other &quot;Bubo&quot; species, great horned owls are also perceptibly larger and more massively built than any long-eared owl (despite being smaller than the Eurasian eagle-owl). Great horned owls also have typically heavily barred, rather than streaked, underparts. Scops and screech owls are much smaller than long-eared owls, as well as differently marked (often with more individually varying overall coloring, i.e. from gray to brown to rufous) and usually having rather short ear-tufts. The Marsh owl (&quot;Asio capensis&quot;) (rare overlap, perhaps in northern Morocco) is generally brown with quite different-looking fine mottling or barring below and has brown eyes and tiny ear-tufts.
Over much of its range, long-eared owls occur with the related short-eared owl, the latter species averaging slightly larger. Much has been written about distinguishing them in the field, though, if seen well, the resemblance between the species is not particularly strong. Furthermore, the two species differ in habitat preferences, with the short-eared owl often favoring (where available) any kind of entirely treeless, open habitats (including many wetlands and Arctic tundra as well as steppe, prairie and extensive meadows), often avoiding the edge habitats favored by the long-eared owl. However, in dim light, at a distance or in flight, confusion is certainly possible. In both long-eared and short-eared owls, the flight style when seen has a distinctive, erratic and buoyant flapping quality that many birdwatchers consider reminiscent of a moth. At rest, the ear-tufts of the long-eared owl serve to easily distinguish the two (although long-eared owls can sometimes hold their ear-tufts lax). The iris-colour differs: yellow in short-eared, and often orange in long-eared. Furthermore, the black surrounding the eyes is vertical and slight on the long-eared, and horizontal and far more conspicuous on the short-eared. Overall, the short-eared owl tends to be a paler, sandier-looking bird than the long-eared, lacking the darker and more extensive markings of the latter. There are a number of other ways in which the two species differ which are best seen when they are flying. Short-eared owls often have a broad white band along the rear edge of the wing, which is not shown by long-eared owls. On the upperwing, the short-eared owl&#x27;s primary-patches are usually paler and more obvious. The band on the upper side of the short-eared owl&#x27;s tail is usually bolder than that of the long-eared. The short-eared&#x27;s innermost secondaries are often dark-marked, contrasting with the rest of the underwing. The long-eared owl has streaking throughout its underparts, whereas on the short-eared the streaking ends at the breast. The dark markings on the underside of the tips of the longest primaries are bolder on short-eared owls. The upperparts of short-eared owls are coarsely blotched, whereas on the long-eared they are more finely marked. The short-eared owl also differs structurally from the long-eared, having longer, slimmer wings. The shorter and broader wings in combination with a squarer tail in long-eared owls produce proportions more reminiscent of a buzzard than the short-eared owl. When studied by their osteological features, however, the long-eared and short-eared owls are difficult to distinguish.

===Vocalizations and ear morphology===
The long-eared owl has relatively large ear slits placed asymmetrically on the sides of its head, as in a majority of owls, with the left ear higher and right lower in order to allow them to absorb sound both from above and below. The ear slit very nearly occupy the full height of the skull, being are about , long and covered in movable skin flaps. The right ear is about 13% larger based on freshly dead owls. Due to its ear structure, the hearing of a long-eared owl is around ten times better at hearing high and medium pitches than humans. Barn owls and boreal owl (&quot;Aegolius funereus&quot;) have (via convergent evolution) roughly similar ear structures, with the relative size of the ear structure and facial disc in owls generally indicative of the level of importance of acute hearing to their life history. Owls with relatively smaller ear slits and shallower or vestigial facial discs tend to skew towards more crepuscular or partially diurnal behaviors, whereas owls such as long-eared owls are more or less entirely nocturnal. It is well known that a majority of owls can hunt in darkness due to their extraordinary hearing, which allows them to pinpoint locations of prey, but they can also utilize their hearing to track intraspecific calls and activities and avoid predation risks.

The vocalizations of this species are highly variable. Amongst owls of all ages, long-eared owls in Michigan were recorded to have made 23 different vocalizations. Karel Voous considered them to likely be the most diverse vocalists of all owl species in the Northern hemisphere. The song of the male long-eared owl is a deep &quot;whoop&quot;, which is repeated at intervals of several seconds. It starts with some hoots at slightly lower pitch before reaching full volume and quality. On calm nights, this song may carry over up to away (at least to human auditory perception). The song of the male is around 400 hertz. In North America, some observers have considered the male&#x27;s song as analogous to the deep cooing of band-tailed pigeons (&quot;Patagioenas fasciata&quot;). Females gives a weaker, less clear and much higher pitched song with a nasal quality. In nearly all owl species, the females, despite being typically the larger sex, have smaller syrinx than the males and so tend to have less powerful voices. The call of the female is at times compared to a weak tin whistle and is only audible at close range, being about 4-5 halftones higher than the song of the male. Females usually call only in duet with male during courtship, but also when the nest is selected and around the beginning of incubation (probably in conjunction with food-begging). In fact, close study has revealed that female calling may occur as frequently as every 2–8 seconds at times of night between nest selection and egg laying. Both sexes utter a cat-like, somewhat hoarse &quot;jaiow&quot; notes or high &quot;yip-yip&quot; notes, the latter reminiscent of a call made by barn owls. When disturbed near the nest holding young, both parents may utter a series of tinny tones, &quot;watt-watt-watt-watt&quot;. During the period of courtship the male flies around and flaps its wing around, producing a clapping sound. During the display flight, the male may make as many as 20 claps. As with many owls, all ages may produce hissing sounds and bill snapping when they feel threatened, especially in the context of nesting. Fledging young call all with high-pitched, drawn-out notes, variously transcribed as &quot;feek&quot;, &quot;peeyee&quot; and &quot;pzeei&quot;, and are often likened to the noise of a gate swinging on a rusty hinge.

==Distribution and habitat==
The long-eared owl has an extremely large distributional range. In Eurasia, they are distributed from the Iberian Peninsula and the British Isles (including almost the entirety of Ireland), in both of which they are found somewhat spottily but quite broadly, especially for an owl. From western France east through the remainder of Europe they are found nearly everywhere. Though still usually quite common in these areas, there are small spots where they do not usually occur in Italy, Austria and Southeastern Europe. In Scandinavia they are found only as a breeding species in about the southern two-thirds of Norway, Sweden and Finland while they usual persist year around in haunts in the southern tips of Norway and Sweden, respectively, as well as in all of Denmark. In coastal Norway they are found at their worldwide northern limit as breeding bird, with long-eared owls nesting as far north as in the Subarctic zone of Troms. In latitudinal range, they are found as far south the Azores, the Canary Islands while their limited breeding range in north Africa is from Morocco to Tunisia, as well as seemingly in northernmost Algeria. Out of Europe, they are found very spottily as breeders in Turkey, northernmost Syria, Israel and Lebanon. They are quite broadly distributed within Russia, breeding in about the southern two-thirds of the country (north as far as roughly Chernyshevsky and Yakutsk) and often occurring year around in about the southern third of it (north to about the cities of Perm, Tyumen and Tomsk) and east to Siberia, ranging far as Sakhalin. Their range is continuous from Russia into most of Kazakhstan, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, about half of Uzbekistan and infrequently into northern Afghanistan and Turkmenistan. In the east, they range through most of Mongolia (absent from the southwest) and the western and eastern parts of northern China, with seasonally uncertain status in the Koreas. Long-eared owls are found throughout the islands of Japan but mainly winter only in points south of Osaka. The long-eared owl occurs apparently only in winter in small spots of southern France, southern Greece, northwestern Egypt, northern Iran, southern Turkmenistan, broadly in much of Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern India (such as the Kutch, Punjab, Kashmir), as well as to the east in Bhutan, southern China, Taiwan and most of South Korea. Irruptive wanderings have resulted in vagrant long-eared owls in various places such as the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Madeira as well as Ryukyu Islands in the east.

This species is found widely distributed in North America as well. Their northern limits are reached in much of British Columbia, though they are mainly absent from the western and coastal part, with the breeding range scarcely spilling over into the southern part of the Northwest Territories. As is the case in most of Eurasia, they are usually found at up to 50 degrees north. Long-eared owls are also found breeding in most of Alberta, all but northern Manitoba and southern Ontario and Quebec only to the southernmost part of the Hudson Bay. However, with the exception of inland southern British Columbia, southern Alberta, and the southern parts of Ontario and Quebec, as well as an isolated population in Newfoundland, long-eared owls usually vacate their Canadian range during winter. The species range as a breeding species is far more extensive in the west than the east within the United States. They breed in Washington, Montana and North Dakota mostly continuously to much of California, where habitat is appropriate, Arizona, western Colorado and western New Mexico as well as less broadly in South Dakota and Iowa. Even though they are absent from the Pacific coasts in Washington and Oregon, they may be found breeding along the Pacific in southern California and even Baja California in Mexico. The first record of breeding for mainland Mexico was recorded for an incidental observed nest built by owls in Janos Biosphere Reserve in Chihuahua. They also breed and occur year around in most of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. Breeding and/or year around occurrence is very rare in the eastern U.S. with a few records of them nesting in Maine, Virginia and West Virginia. The long-eared owl occurs much more broadly in North America during the non-breeding season and may found essentially all over the Midwest, Texas and as far south in Mexico as Colima, Veracruz and northern Oaxaca. The species also occurs in the non-breeding season in Louisiana (but for the southeast) and much of northern Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina north to Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and southern Pennsylvania. Very rarely, these birds have turned up in Florida (in times of exceptional irruption) and, as a vagrant, even the Bermudas. They are found also by winter and in migration in much of the east coast of the United States, from the Outer Banks in North Carolina, broadly in eastern Pennsylvania and almost anywhere in Delaware or New Jersey, southeastern New York (including New York City) and north to much of southern New England including almost all of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island as well as southern New Hampshire.

===Habitat===
Optimal habitat tends towards access to open spaces with short vegetation and abundant prey and wooded cover for roosting and nesting. In terms of attitudinal range, this species may live at many elevations with no strong altitudinal preferences noted, although they tend to be absent above the montane tree line. The species has been recorded exceptionally nesting at above sea level in Kashmir. Long-eared owls tend to inhabit usually rather open landscapes with groups of trees, hedges or small woods, as well as pastureland with rows of trees and bushes, any type of forest with clearings, forest edges, semi-open taiga forest, swampy areas and bogs, especially those with willows, alder and poplars, orchards with old fruit trees, parks, cemeteries with trees and bushes, even gardens and timbered areas in villages, towns or cities. In many parts of the world, including China, Israel and the American southwest, long-eared owls have shown the ability to adapt to deserts, though more commonly semi-desert, and may nest and roost in available oases and adapting to hunt prey over the open desert ground, whether it is sandy or more rocky. The preferred habitat in Great Britain was found to consist most regularly (amongst 200 nests) of small tree plantations, copses or scattered trees on moorlands, heath or mosses (33%), followed by blocks of forest (24.5%), smaller plantations, shelterbelts or hedgerows in various agricultural areas (24%) and scrub or wooded clumps near the coast and in wetlands (15%). All nests in Finland in a study were no more than from cultivated land and only occurred on margins of larger woods or forests. Ecological compensation areas (i.e. habitat for wildlife on privately owned farmland) in Switzerland did provide habitat for long-eared owls but it was found that voles were more extensively hunted in mowed sections of the lands rather than the more densely vegetated areas where voles were most abundant. This indicates habitat (in particular open ground habitat) is more important to the predators than prey densities, at least locally. In Spain, when compared to the little owl (&quot;Athene noctua&quot;), long-eared owls were more likely to be found in low disturbance areas where forest transitioned into plantations and to areas with a relatively low human presence. A preference by long-eared owls for stands of conifers has been noted in many American studies. In Ontario, the species breeds most often in dense conifer stands of wood and reforestation groves that are often somewhat wet, thence less often in mixed or deciduous areas. A similar association with conifers was observed aseasonally in Michigan. In North Dakota, dense thickets of small trees and brushy margins of more extensive forest tracts were the main habitat for these owls. In western areas where mixed woodlands may occur, however, deciduous stands may attract wintering owls, providing they have heavy growths of climbing vines. In the Sierra Nevadas, long-eared owls are often found in riparian zone of mixed woods around oaks and ponderosa pines (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;). Analysis from Oregon has shown that forest management had no discernable effect on long-eared owls, indicating that they are not truly forest owls but clearances of riparian vegetation, conversion of foraging areas to agricultural fields and reforestation of open habitats did reduce local numbers. Despite being adaptable to both very cold areas, including the taiga and scarcely Subarctic, and quite warm areas, including drier and/or arid parts of the subtropics, the long-eared owl is largely confined to temperate zones of the north and is less climatically adaptable than the short-eared owl, with the latter species acclimating to nearly all climates and making its homes both in the Arctic and the tropics whether wet and dry so long as open habitats are available.

==Behaviour==

Long-eared owls are more or less strictly nocturnal in activity. Usually activity for the species commences at dusk. After nightfall long-eared owls in Idaho were least active from 8-10 pm and from 5-6 am, while the hours around 10-12 pm and 3-5 am were often the peak times of activity. When living relatively close to the Arctic, long-eared owls may be forced to forage during daylight as no full nightfall may occur during summer. When flying by day, long-eared owls are often mobbed by diurnal birds such as corvids and other birds of prey. Often long-eared owls will discharge a fairly large amount of pellets and drop them below regular day roosts. Unlike most other owls, the species has no territorial hunting ground. In Switzerland, 14 long-eared owls examined using radiotelemetry were found to have an average home range of . In the study, they required fields along borders of woodlands, avoiding completely treeless areas more so than they were prevalent in the environment. In the České Budějovice area of Czech Republic, 9 radiotagged owls were studied. Nearly equal numbers were found in suburban and urban areas, and urban ones used developed areas for more than 50% of their nocturnal activity while suburban ones used developed areas for less than half of their activities. Similar habitats were favored by both urban and suburban owls but urban owls had to range wider to avoid heavy human activity and access city parks and so had larger average ranges, vs , while suburban ones had easier access to meadows and stands of woods.

===Migration===

Out of roughly 19 regular species of owl in North America and 13 regular species of owl in Europe, the long-eared owl is classed as one of the five in both continents to be truly migratory, moving annually in at least some areas and in some numbers from summer to winter grounds and back whether or not it is an irruptive year. Northern populations are migratory, showing a strong tendency to wander south in autumn. Some normally young bird from central Europe migrate southwest at distances of up to more than . Central European adults are less migratory, at most merely wandering in winter. Long-eared owls that breed Scandinavia generally migrate to nearly anywhere in Europe, from Great Britain to Southeast Europe, though some may disperse as far as north Africa or Asia Minor. In Europe, males and females seem to differ slightly in migratory behaviour. Long-eared owls wintering in Denmark were found to be heavily biased towards females, also there is a bias towards females in winter surveys in other areas such as southern Sweden. At 10 wintering sites in Europe, females were 36% more common than males. The hypothesis posited by those that studied the owls in Denmark is that females face a higher rate of predation by larger birds of prey and may distribute away from Fennoscandia where densities are high of those predators and to areas that show low densities of these predators. Another, non-exclusive, theory is that they may be avoiding areas with deep snow that may inhibit prey capture. Supporting data that male long-eared owls winter further north than females was gathered in southern Norway, where the recovery of dead owls (from car or powerline collisions) of the species encountered in late fall throughout winter, males were 45% more common than females. On evidence, many of the females that vacate Norway and even Fennoscandia come to winter in Great Britain (the female migrants here being up to 3.5 times more common during winter than male migrants in one study). Two birds in ringing studies that were recorded in late winter in Germany were observed to return for the summer to central Russia (near Yaroslavl, away) and to eastern Russia (near Kazan, away). Birds that breed in central Asia have been recorded to winter in a wide variety of locales, including the Egyptian Nile valley, Pakistan, northern India and southern China. In North America, migrants generally sourced from Canada and the Upper Midwest winter almost anywhere in the remaining United States, however they will irruptively migrate as far as Georgia and several areas of Mexico and seldom in Florida. Typically the northern limit of the wintering range fall up to the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, the southern reaches of the Upper Midwest and central New England. Spring migration was tracked along with northern saw-whet owls (&quot;Aegolius acadius&quot;) as they migrated through Oswego County, New York via mist nets, with the saw-whet considerably outnumbering long-eared owls. Here, migration of long-eared owl was between March 21 and April 14 and, unlike the saw-whets, the long-eared owl migration does not appear to be effected as extensively by weather conditions. Long-eared owls are 19.5% of owls (or 197 total owls) recorded migrating through Cape May Point in fall (against a majority, 60.6%, being saw-whet owls), with 26.1% of the specimens from the species caught in the mist nets being adults. More than 90% of long-eared owls migrate between mid-October and late November, with the immatures migrating earlier, 52.1% of juveniles having passed through in October whereas only 9.4% of adults migrated in the month. Cape May studies also indicated that 58.87% of long-eared owls were caught in the dark before dawn rather than other times of night. Based on evidence from Cape May, migrating long-eared owls tend to fly higher above the ground than do migrating saw-whet and barn owls but not as high as the short-eared owl, with the latter owl often able to avoid mist nets apparently via its flying height while moving through. Per a study in Idaho, 7 radio-tagged owls actually migrating both north, north of their respective nesting sites, and to higher elevations after the breeding season (in many cases possibly to exploit displaced rodents in recently logged areas).

The long-eared owl has the peculiar ability to increase populations and then disperse in nearly multi-directional movements during good years for prey numbers. Banding records across North America show highly erratic numbers and movements across the continent of North America with unpredictable peak numbers of migrants in completely different years respectively for the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, New York and New Jersey. Therefore, the species is sometimes considered “nomadic” despite many populations of the species being consistent annual migrants. Similar tendency towards so-called “nomadism” is shared by other widespread raptors semi-specialized to hunting voles over open ground, such as short-eared owls and hen harriers (&quot;Circus cyaneus&quot;). These erratic movements and peaks and ebbs of northern populations has lent to descriptions of the long-eared owl as “irruptive”, however it generally moves in quite different ways from owls largely endemic to the taiga (or tundra), which are more traditionally irruptive in that they tend to migrate little or not at all when prey remain ample in their native home range but then move south in mass when prey populations crash. Long-eared owls, unlike these irruptive northern owls, often migrate from the northern areas regardless of conditions. However, like the northern irruptive owls, long-eared owls tend to appear in unprecedented numbers to the south when a peak prey year is followed by a winter during which prey population crashes. In North America, the migratory habits of long-eared owls are strongly mirrored by those of northern saw-whet owls. Study of banding records in Saskatchewan show that the long-eared owl Canadian populations may be considered more truly irruptive species both as a breeder and migrant in that only appears in numbers during peak vole years, with large numbers only in 4 of 44 banding years. During 7 low years, the long-eared owls of Saskatchewan seemed to disappear altogether from much of the province. Peak years also coincided often with snowshoe hare (&quot;Lepus americanus&quot;) peaks, possibly due to lessened competition (as the larger owls favored prey is locally the hare) and interspecific predation by great horned owls. The phenomena of movements that seem to be nomadic or purportedly irruptive in nature may occur as well in Europe, though given the species&#x27; denser population in general there in comparison to North America may result in less noticeable wide variations in numbers. Years with irruptive numbers of long-eared owls have been noted in the British Isles when prey peaks then crashes back in Scandinavia, resulting in much larger numbers of migrant long-eared owls into the islands than normal, as well as concurrently large numbers of short-eared owls and harriers. In southern Finland during a peak prey year followed by a prey crash, a very large number of long-eared owls were detected and were seen to be likely food stressed, as several were foraging actively during daylight despite the extensive nighttime hours during the season.

===Social and roosting behavior===

During daytime, long-eared owls tends to roost in an upright position on a branch, not infrequently close to the trunk, oftentimes within dense foliage. In winter, the long-eared owl often stays close to the same tree or grove of trees (i.e. in and around parks, large gardens, or cemeteries). Usually, when approached, the owl freezes with its body stiffly upright, eyes closed to narrow slits and ear tufts erect. This is called the “tall-thin position” and is common to at least a couple dozen species of typical owl. If approached closed, the owls will alternately open and close their eyes (apparently having stirred but trying to fool potential predators into thinking the owl is still at rest), finally lowering ear tufts, fluffing body plumage and flying to another roost. Unlike most owls, which show a tendency towards territorial behavior on a fixed range year-around when possible, long-eared owls in the non-breeding season may form aggregations of owls while roosting. Such groupings may include 6 to 50 owls, with a European record of about 150 owls at a single roost. Even other migratory owls in the temperate zone do not tolerate each other as closely as do long-eared owls, with short-eared owls seemingly only forming aggregations when food supplies are exceptionally high, while social roosting in long-eared owls seems to occur regardless of local prey numbers. Long-eared owls tend to roost in the depths of the &quot;darkest stands of trees&quot; in order to conceal their presence, though they prefer being close to forested edge to allow access to hunting over more open ground. A study in the New Jersey Meadowlands area showed that roosting owls had a strong fidelity for certain trees, particularly conifers such as cedars where the main truck is large obscured from view and a grouping of at least 2-3 closely clumped trees occurs. Roost height in the New Jersey study was at or occasionally higher. In New Jersey, different roosts were preferred each year and in the local heavily modified environment, the owls become partially habituated to human activities. However, approach at closer than away usually caused them to flush. Departure of owls for nighttime hunting would generally occur between 40 and 49 minutes after sundown. Studies in the Moscow region of wintering roosts were done over 10 years, with 12 communal and 14 solitary roosts found. The communal roosts included up to 16 individuals per winter, with a mean of 9.9. Overall, the average in Moscow per roost site was 2.1 owls. Vole numbers the preceding year were likely the causes of numeric variations in years here while wind and snow avoidance were key in characteristics of roost sites. Extraordinarily large roosts were the norm in a study in Stavropol, Russia, where the general roost area could host from 80 to 150 individuals each winter over 4 years, with 93.7% of the roosts located in coniferous trees. In Milan, Italy, from 2 to 76 long-eared owls were observed per urban roost site. Here, nighttime observation showed that owls individually would depart the roost at peak during the darkest part of nighttime. A majority of the Milan roosting owls did not fly toward urban areas instead flying to suburban fields and forest where prey is more easily encountered. The reason for roosting in aggregations seems to be at least in part to mitigate predation risks.

==Dietary biology==

Long-eared owls may divide their hunting into phases, the first stopping around midnight, the second beginning some point after midnight and ending an hour before sunrise. While hunting, they tend focuses on the edge of woodlands, hedgerows and open spaces with rough grassland, and over young trees and open ground of all kinds. They hunt mainly on the wing, flying low and fairly slowly, often being quite low to ground, i.e. only around . More often than visually finding their prey, it is thought that long-eared owls most often audibly detect the rustling of their intended food. In lab settings, long-eared owls were considerably more skilled at finding mice by sound in more or less complete darkness than tawny and barred owls (&quot;Strix varia&quot;), and in some American experiments even outclassed the auditorily-acute barn owls in this regard. Once prey is spotted, the long-eared owl&#x27;s flight suddenly stalls, then they quickly drop with talons spread to pounce on prey that is perceived, or especially, that comes out into the open. Habitat may be perhaps even more key than prey numbers to the selection of hunting grounds. Often when prey numbers are more ample in timbered areas nearer the roost or rich marshy areas in the vicinity, the long-eared owls will still often come to more prey-poor areas such as old fields so that they can detect prey on open ground. The footspan of a long-eared owl, including claws, reaches on average in males and females, respectively, which would be large for a diurnal bird of prey but is quite small for an owl of its size, given the physiological differences in the way different birds of prey tend to kill their prey. While acciptrid raptors tend to kill by stabbing with their talons through vital organs, owls are more likely to constrict their prey to death, so tend to have proportionately larger, more robust feet. In other medium-sized owls, the footspan in tawny owls and barn owls respectively averages in between the sexes (notably footspan seems to be a fairly reliable predictor of body mass of an owl as well). Prey capture by long-eared owls was studied and compared to tawny owls in a European experiment. The two owl species caught mammals and beetles caught in similar ways but the long-eared owls shied away from flying sparrows and would only capture the sparrows when they perched (though the tawny did not avoid flying sparrows, it too would only capture the prey when perched). Long-eared owls either disregarded or killed but did not eat amphibians, while tawny owls did catch and eat amphibians when they were available. Occasionally the tawny owls would attack fish whilst one long-eared owl caught but did not eat a fish. The European study further revealed that several owls of different species ate bits of plant and did not appear to do so out of food deprivation or hunger.

Taken as whole, the global population of long-eared owls may appear to have a widely varying diet. One study accrued information from 312 studies from around the species&#x27; range. In total 478 prey species were found to be described, of which 180 were mammal species, 191 were bird species, 83 were assorted invertebrate species, 15 were reptiles, 7 were amphibians, and reportedly just a couple fish species. This included a total of approximately 813,033 prey items having been reviewed. However, on closer inspection, the long-eared owl generally appears to be something of a dietary specialist. It usually takes primarily, often nearly entirely, small mammals, e.g. rodents, as food in almost every part of its range. Usually a broad picture emerges that between 80 and 99% of the diet consists of mammals, averaging 94% in one estimate for all of Europe. However, in warmer, insular or more urbanized environments, a greater percentage or, rarely, even a majority of the diet can locally be non-mammalian prey. Mean prey sizes have been studied extensively and are almost always fall within a very narrow range. In Europe, the mean estimated prey size overall was . Meanwhile, in North America, mean prey sizes have varied between in two estimates. In general, throughout their range, the mean size of prey is generally encapsulated between , usually well under , and only in cases where long-eared owls, perhaps through lessened competition, has regular access to prey weighing or more, may the mean prey size range uncommonly reach . Cases of exceptionally large prey are mentioned where they occur below.

===Mammals===

The long-eared owls derives almost of its food energy from rodents. Among this order, they are usually associated with a single group, the voles. The life history of the long-eared owl is inexorably linked to voles. Voles, members of the family Cricetidae and subfamily Arvicolinae, are often numerous, small-to-medium-sized rodents with relatively short tails. In Europe, especially, the long-eared owl can be considered a specialized vole hunter. Out of 86 prey studies in the continent, in about 69% voles made up more than half of the prey. In particular, in the region of central Europe, a little over 82% of 57,500 prey items was made up of voles. Where a variety of voles are available in Europe, long-eared owls show a preference for the most gregariously inclined common vole (&quot;Microtus arvalis&quot;) over the less sociable field vole (&quot;Microtus agrestis&quot;). In central Europe, 76% of the diet was compromised by the common vole species alone. More specifically, in the largest known study from Germany, of 45,439 prey items in the regions of Berlin and Nordharz, common vole accounted for 72%, with the field vole and tundra vole (&quot;Microtus oeconomus&quot;) collectively another 5.5%. Another large representation of the common vole was in Slovakia, where they made up 84.1% of the diet (27,720 out of 32,192 total prey items). In different years in Slovakia, common voles may range from as much as 92.4% to as little as 57.2% depending on vole numbers. Locally, such as in former Czechoslovakia and in western Ukraine, about 94-95% of the diet may be common voles alone (of 4,153 and 5,896 prey items, respectively). The dietary association with the common vole generally continues to most areas of European Russia, such as Moscow. At times, such as indicated in Moldova, long-eared owls are capable of culling as much as 50% of the common vole population and it was opined that the voles would easily become pestilent to humans if not naturally controlled. Like many voles, common voles are subject to population cycles. In accordance with the cyclic nature of vole populations, the local numbers of long-eared owls can rise and fall sharply. In low vole years, they tend to lay fewer eggs and feed fewer young, and may not attempt to breed at all. In high vole years, they generally lay and hatch more eggs and rear more young. While incubation starts with first egg, only the oldest siblings may be feed in low food years. Generally various species of mice are eaten in poor years for common voles but appear to be an inefficient substitute (at least in more northerly climes) based on the owls&#x27; lower breeding rates. Apparently, common voles at times may collectively shift in temporal activity into more diurnal activity in what may be an attempt to mitigate heavy owl predation (especially as basically all European owls tend to hunt them), although several diurnal predators are nearly as specialized predators of them as well. Evidence has indicated that common voles are altering their life cycles with unknown long-term results due likely to global warming. It is likely that the long-eared owls of the region are to be effected by this but it is uncertain exactly what the resulting effect will be.

In some parts of Europe, common voles are at times not found or are locally infrequent or rare, especially on large islands, Scandinavia and some parts of the southern reaches, such as the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and Greece. Therefore, long-eared owls live mostly on different prey species. Supplemental or, occasionally, primary prey when voles are less common are murid rodents, especially the commoner genera such as &quot;Apodemus&quot; or field mice, &quot;Mus&quot; or house mice and, occasionally, &quot;Rattus&quot; or typical rats. In Scandinavian studies, common voles were still the main prey in Finland where distributed (and outnumbered field voles in the owl&#x27;s diet four-to-one) and partially in Denmark (where foods were split between the two commoner vole species and field mice) but are not in Sweden and Norway. In Sweden, where common voles are not found, field voles were the main food, making up 65.2% of 13,917 prey items, followed by &quot;Apodemus&quot; field mice species, which were a further 25.3%. In Norway, 3,431 prey items were primarily field voles (42.75%), &quot;Apodemus&quot; species (12.64%), tundra voles (12.35%) and bank voles (&quot;Myodes glareolus&quot;) (12.06%). In the British Isles, primary prey switched between field voles (46.6% of 1,228 prey items in the Peak District and 79% in southern Scotland) and &quot;Apodemus&quot; mice, most especially the wood mouse (&quot;Apodemus sylvaticus&quot;), (75.6% of 1,772 prey items pooled from different parts of England and 69.5% of 1,373 prey items in Ireland, where native voles are entirely absent). In warmer areas, the long-eared owls may vary in diet depending on local prey composition. In Spain, voles, including common voles, Mediterranean pine voles (&quot;Microtus duodecimcostatus&quot;) and Lusitanian pine vole (&quot;Microtus lusitanicus&quot;), collectively made up 76.4% of 6,945 prey items in the central part of the country while on the Ebro in northern Spain, the Algerian mouse (&quot;Mus spretus&quot;) was dominant, at 69.5% of 846 prey items. Overall, in 7 studies from assorted Spanish locations, wood mice and &quot;Mus&quot; species were the most regular prey (together accounting for just under 60% of the sum total prey items). Many studies in Italy show that the species is not as much of a specialized feeder in the country with considerable regional variation in prey preferences. Inclement weather in particular, including any kind of precipitation or high winds, seems to cause Italian long-eared owls to increase the diversity of prey that&#x27;s routinely caught. In some Italian studies, Savi&#x27;s pine vole (&quot;Microtus savii&quot;) were the main food, at Prignano Cilento where they made up 60.4% by number and 61.6% by biomass. In others, the wood mouse was the main food, such as Cremona, at 59.1% of 1,482 prey items. An unusual close prey association was noted in northern Italy, where access to landfills allowed them access to exceptionally large prey, brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;), with juvenile rats caught that weighed on average and sometimes weighing up to , making up 20.5% by number and 65.1% by biomass, although wood mice were the most numerous found prey in pellets. Because of the access to rats, the mean prey size in the north Italian study was an exceptionally high Generally, &quot;Mus&quot; mice seem to be the main foods for long-eared owls in Greece, especially the Macedonian mouse (&quot;Mus macedonicus&quot;), but also not infrequently the southern vole (&quot;Microtus levis&quot;) is important in the diet there as well. In the Canary Islands, the introduced house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;) was deemed to primarily support the owls today, consisting of 69.5% of 3,628 prey items per the largest known study.

Outside of Europe within Eurasia, the feeding association with voles for long-eared owls weakens somewhat but does continue apiece in adjacent Turkey, particularly southern vole and Günther&#x27;s vole (&quot;Microtus guentheri&quot;) (the latter, for instance, making up to 78.7% of 5,324 prey items in Karapınar). In the Middle East, prey preferences varied based on soil composition in desert edge areas, with Israeli studies showing primary shifting rapidly from &quot;Gerbillus&quot; gerbil species to &quot;Meriones&quot; jirds to Günther&#x27;s voles, with similar findings in wintering owls in Iran. Relatively large-sized prey, Indian gerbils (&quot;Tatera indica&quot;) and short-tailed bandicoot rats (&quot;Nesokia indica&quot;), was reported for wintering long-eared owls in Iran estimated to average and , respectively, constituted a good portion of the prey (72.9% of biomass) and taken in almost even numbers with smaller &quot;Gerbillus&quot; species. Much further east, in China and Mongolia, long-eared owls often subsist on different varieties rodent, especially small hamsters, which are also cricetid but not arvicoline, such as the Chinese striped (&quot;Cricetulus barabensis&quot;) and Roborovski dwarves (&quot;Phodopus roborovskii&quot;), alternatively with larger jirds, such as midday jirds (&quot;Meriones meridianus&quot;), as well as house mice. In more northerly eastern regions, voles continue to be of import. In western Siberia, tundra voles, narrow-headed voles (&quot;Microtus gregalis&quot;), Eurasian harvest mouse (&quot;Micromys minutus&quot;) and steppe lemming (&quot;Lagurus lagurus&quot;) were the main rodent prey. In Japan, diet is strongly biased to rodents such as Japanese grass vole (&quot;Microtus montebelli&quot;) (84.2% of foods in Niigata on Honshu), grey red-backed vole (&quot;Myodes rufocanus&quot;) (87.2% on Hokkaido) or house mouse (77.7% in Ehime Prefecture, Shikoku).

In North America, long-eared owls also primarily rely on small rodents in their diet, but their diet is somewhat more diverse by rodent family and less completely reliant on voles than their Eurasian counterparts. In general, the further north they are found in North America, the more restricted and vole based the diet is for this species. While diets are poorly researched in detail in Canada, in the northern tier states of Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, New York, Wisconsin and northern Oregon voles were easily the main prey for long-eared owls. In particular, the meadow vole (&quot;Microtus pennsylvanicus&quot;) tends to be a dietary staple, such as in the two of the larger American studies, in Michigan where they constituted 70.6% of 3,269 prey items and in Wisconsin where they constituted 83.4% of 3,273 prey items. Another regularly featured vole in the diet in America is the prairie vole (&quot;Microtus ochrogaster&quot;), but few other voles seem to be taken other than opportunistically excluding Oregon where the gray-tailed vole (&quot;Microtus canicaudus&quot;) and Townsend&#x27;s vole (&quot;Microtus townsendii&quot;) locally led the foods. In North America, non-arvicoline cricetid rodents such as the genus &quot;Peromyscus&quot;, or deermice, and the smaller &quot;Reithrodontomys&quot;, or harvest mice, fill the niche of small wild mice and may be irresistible to hunting long-eared owls. &quot;Peromyscus&quot; mice were the main foods for this species in Colorado, Illinois and most studies from Iowa (composing up to 59.1% of the local diet).

In many areas, particular arid vicinities, the superfamily Geomyoidea supplants cricetid rodents as the primary foods, namely pocket mice, kangaroo rats and occasionally pocket gophers and jumping mice. Particularly this appears to be the case in the American southwest where in Arizona, &quot;Perognathus&quot; pocket mice composed 61.3% of the diet, in New Mexico, where species pairs of pocket mice and kangaroo rats composed 51.8% and 20.5% of the foods, respectively, and in southern California, where &quot;Perognathus&quot; were 51% of foods and &quot;Dipodomys&quot; kangaroo rats were a further 37.8% of the foods. In the Sonoran Desert of Mexico, nearly all known prey were geomyoids, in particular the Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rat (&quot;Dipodomys merriami&quot;), which alone made up 74.7% of the foods. In a well-studied population, Snake River region of southeastern Idaho as well as Owyhee county in the southwest part of the state, geomyoid rodents are usually the most prominent prey, especially the Great Basin pocket mouse (&quot;Perognathus parvus&quot;) and Ord&#x27;s kangaroo rat (&quot;Dipodomys ordii&quot;) (often supplemented heavily with &quot;Peromyscus&quot; mice). Due to the relatively large size of kangaroo rats, in Idaho, mean prey size may range up to at least In some parts of North America, richer biomass are likely when larger prey takes the primary position, such as cotton rats. Cotton rats were the main prey in Janos Biosphere Reserve, Mexico (43.2% by number, 69.1% by biomass) and in Texas, in the latter slightly outnumbering (36%) the much smaller harvest mice (23%). Since the mean body size of hispid cotton rats (&quot;Sigmodon hispidus&quot;) caught reportedly is around , they probably represent a very productive prey resource for long-eared owls. Similarly, exceptional large prey was taken northeastern Oregon, where both juvenile, weighing about and adult, weighing about , northern pocket gophers (&quot;Thomomys talpoides&quot;) were caught and made up 55.7% by number and 74.4% by biomass of the diets of long-eared owls. Depending on circumstances, the mean size of northern pocket gophers taken in different areas can vary from or higher, but long-eared owls usually take juveniles outside of the Oregon study (weighing on the lower end of that mass scale).

Non-rodent mammalian prey is seldom of great import to long-eared owls, though they can take some numbers of other kinds of mammals locally. Despite claims that the long-eared owls “avoids” shrews as prey, it is probably more correct to say that they do not seek them out nearly as often as more socially inclined and/or densely populated rodent prey. Some other owls may be considered regular and common shrew predators, such as often barn owls. In Europe, a broad picture of prey selection indicates about 2% of the diet of long-eared owls consists of shrews. Locally, relatively high numbers of shrews were reported in Finland, where 10.7% of 3,759 prey items were common shrews (&quot;Sorex araneus&quot;), in southern Scotland, where the common shrew made up 17.3% of 514 prey items, in northeast Greece, where lesser white-toothed shrew (&quot;Crocidura suaveolens&quot;) were 19.3% of 311 prey items and in western Siberia, where &quot;Sorex&quot; species were 17.3% of 335 prey items. Similarly, in North America, shrews are rarely more than secondary prey. Exceptionally high numbers of shrews were noted in Ohio, where the relatively large northern short-tailed shrew (&quot;Blarina brevicauda&quot;) and the relatively small North American least shrew (&quot;Cryptotis parva&quot;) made up 10.46% and 10.22% of the diet, respectively, and in Tennessee, where 12.85% of the diet was least shrew. The smallest mammal on earth (and thus smallest recorded mammalian or vertebrate prey), the Etruscan shrew (&quot;Suncus etruscus&quot;), may be seldom hunted by long-eared owls. Bats are another supplemental prey type for long-eared owls. One compilation study based on 12 study sites in the Mediterranean area (in Spain, Italy, Greece, Slovenia, Romania and Switzerland) found up to 2% of prey remains were bats. The bats taken in the Mediterranean region ranged in size from the whiskered bat (&quot;Myotis mystacinus&quot;), estimated at as low as , to the European free-tailed bat (&quot;Tadarida teniotis&quot;), estimated to weigh up to . A exceptionally close predatory relationship was noted between bats, especially Japanese house bats (&quot;Pipistrellus abramus&quot;), and long-eared owls in the Beijing area of China, where bats accounted for 28.6% of 3,561 prey items overall, and 56.6% of the diet locally in urban, rather than suburban, roosts. Other mammals, outside of aforementioned groups (i.e. cricetid, murid and geomyoid) rodents, are known to be hunted but are generally a negligible part of the long-eared owl&#x27;s diet, including hedgehogs, moles, rabbits and hares and weasels as well as rarely taken rodents like dormice, flying squirrels and squirrels (including chipmunks). While lagomorphs such as hares and rabbits are very rare prey for long-eared owls, occasionally they may capture one. Such prey was estimated to weigh (for cottontail rabbits) and (for jackrabbits) in Idaho, meaning very small young rabbits and jackrabbits are likely captured. However, sometimes long-eared owls can very rarely capture exceptionally large lagomorphs. The record sized mammalian prey to be taken by a long-eared owl, was recorded in the case of predation upon a probable juvenile black-tailed jackrabbit (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;) which weighed an estimated . Two instances of scavenging on carrion were reported in Italy, the first known case of this for the species, where long-eared owls consumed parts of an adult crested porcupine (&quot;Hystrix cristata&quot;) and an adult European pine marten (&quot;Martes martes&quot;), both prey the long-eared owls were certainly unlikely to have killed.

===Birds===

Long-eared owls are generally infrequent predators of birds. Food studies from Eurasia place it as an opportunistic and occasional bird predator, while in North America they are do not seem to generally take large numbers of birds in any area. In winter, sometimes these owls can come to live largely off of small birds gathered in communal sleeping places, often near villages or towns. Particularly snow cover during winter is likely to influence local long-eared owls to switch from mammalian to avian prey. Like barn owls, long-eared owls have been known to hover around roosts in bushes in attempts to disturb the sleeping birds, which may provoke the prey to fly out of their shelter, only to be caught. Long-eared owls, along with migrating short-eared owls, were observed in Spain hunting night-migrating passerines that were attracted to manmade light sources. When killing birds, long-eared owls are very likely to peck about the rear part of the body and the head and decapitate their victims, resulting in more skeletal damage than is typical in other owls and making prey identification potentially difficult. Particularly often taken by long-eared owls in urban areas and/or the edge of arid habitat are house sparrows (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;) and occasionally the Eurasian tree sparrow (&quot;Passer montanus&quot;). A surprisingly high balance of prey for wintering long-eared owls in desert areas was shown to be avian. This was in the case in Algeria, where 37.5% of the diet and 40% of the biomass were avian and the most identified overall prey genus was &quot;Passer&quot; species, at 20.7% by number and 17% of biomass. For wintering owls in the city of Jerusalem, 90.7% of the diet (150 prey items) were small birds, led by house sparrow (22%) and the blackcap (&quot;Sylvia atricapilla&quot;) (16.7%). Further study of the long-eared owl&#x27;s diet in Israel&#x27;s Negev desert showed that 28.3% of 3,062 prey items were birds. In Egypt, 24.6% of prey items were birds including house sparrow (15.4%) and European goldfinch (&quot;Carduelis carduelis&quot;) (2.4%). In Europe, birds rarely compromise a majority of the foods, but hearty numbers are taken in several areas nonetheless. In central Europe, birds were estimated to contribute an average of 8% of the diet (of 52 species). In peak vole years, birds could be less than 2% of the foods while in vole low years, as much as 33% were made up of by birds. Similarly, in the Sofia park, Bulgaria, the number of birds, with an average 9.6% by number and 7.9% by biomass, was variable based on vole numbers but a high number of 44 avian prey species were recorded. In the Sonian Forest, Belgium, 38.3% of 355 prey items were birds, mostly of various passerine species. A study in Baden-Württemberg, Germany found birds to compromise 14.75% of 12,890 prey items, a relatively high balance, with the most common identified bird species being the European goldfinch. Overall British studies found in a sample of 7,161 prey items that 1,161 were birds (14.95%) and that bird were present in 90% of examined pellets. Of these, 46.9% were house sparrow, 7.5% were common starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;), 4.65% were common blackbird (&quot;Turdus merula&quot;), 3.35% were European greenfinch (&quot;Chloris chloris&quot;), 2.92% were song thrush (&quot;Turdus philomelos&quot;), 2.49% were Eurasian skylark (&quot;Alauda arvensis&quot;) and 2.23% were common linnet (&quot;Linaria cannabina&quot;). More locally in the Peak District of England, birds were 23% of the prey by number and 31.3% by biomass. Of the birds examined here, a majority of those identified were meadow pipits (&quot;Anthus pratensis&quot;) followed by twite (&quot;Linaria flavirostris&quot;), and identified birds ranged in size from a probable wood warbler (&quot;Phylloscopus sibilatrix&quot;) (average adult weight ) to an adult northern lapwing (&quot;Vanellus vanellus&quot;) (average adult weight ). Furthermore, 80% by number and 11 of 25 bird prey species were characteristic of open habitat.

Many Italian studies reflect relatively high numbers of birds being hunted, mainly in the non-breeding times. One of the smaller large representations was at Prignano Cilento where 13.85% were made up of mostly unidentified birds. In Regional Park of Decima-Malafede, birds were 31.1% of the diet, 13.7% of which were unidentified passerines, while European goldfinches and European greenfinch accounted for a further 7.1% and 4.6% of the prey items. In the Venice area, of 642 prey items examined and a total prey mass of , birds made up 38.47% by number and 41% of the biomass. In the winter roost of Imperia, 63.43% of 1,020 prey items were birds and 36.57% were mammals. The main prey identified was the blackcap (51.6%) while the chaffinch (&quot;Fringilla coelebs&quot;) was secondary among avian prey (6.73%). In Romanian studies avian prey was relatively important as well. In Agigea there, 32.71% of the foods were birds, with &quot;Carduelis&quot; species combined constituting 6.04% and swallows being secondary such as the common house martin (&quot;Delichon urbicum&quot;) (2.52%) and the barn swallow (&quot;Hirundo rustica&quot;) (2.44%). Birds were the main foods for wintering long-eared owls in Romania&#x27;s Danube delta, with birds making up 59.5% of total prey by number and 51.6% by biomass of 948 prey items against 40.7% by number and 48.4% by biomass for mammals. Here, numerous passerines were mostly taken with the finch family (18.6%), Old World sparrow family (15.7%) and the tit family (12.7%) being the commonest prey families among the birds. The mean bird prey size was calculated at while the mean mammal prey size was . House sparrows accounted for 14.3% of biomass and Eurasian blackbirds for 12.3% of the biomass on the Danube. While mammals usually are dominant in the diets of long-eared owls in Spain, in the Albufera reserve of the nation, birds were 53.5% by number and 48.6% of the biomass of 864 prey items. A total of 34 species of birds were noted, led by common chiffchaff (&quot;Phylloscopus collybita&quot;) (12.5% by number, 4.8% by biomass), house sparrow (8.2% by number, 12.2% by biomass), barn swallow (6.4% by number, 7% by biomass) and sand martin (&quot;Riparia riparia&quot;) (3.2% by number, 2.7% by biomass). The main recorded individual prey species in Beijing was the Eurasian tree sparrow, at 38% of the diet, but other avian prey was negligible here.

While most of the passerines attacked by long-eared owls are well within typical prey sizes for this species, while pursuing bird prey many reports note that unusually large prey may be attacked. Avian prey weighing around or somewhat higher such as the larger common thrushes or jays is not uncommonly taken. However, unusually large bird prey for long-eared owls in Europe has included several species at least twice as massive, including adults of the following species: northern lapwings, common wood pigeon (&quot;Columbus palumbus&quot;), with an average adult weight of , common moorhens (&quot;Gallinula chloropus&quot;), with an average adult weight of , red-legged partridges (&quot;Alectoris rufa&quot;), with an average adult weight of , western jackdaws (&quot;Corvus monedula&quot;), with an average adult weight of and Eurasian magpies (&quot;Pica pica&quot;), with an average adult weight of . Much of the largest identifiable and provable prey for long-eared owls in Europe overall were found to be birds. Despite the relatively scarcity of avian prey in the diet in North America, unusually large avian prey has been reported there as well. Such prey have included adults of Northwestern crow (&quot;Corvus caurinus&quot;), averaging , two large adult ruffed grouse (&quot;Bonasa umbellus&quot;), estimated to weigh slightly over , and even apparently at least once an adult sharp-tailed grouse (&quot;Tympanuchus phasianellus&quot;), which average a relatively huge or three times heavier than an average long-eared owl.

===Other prey===
Other than mammals, which compromise a great majority of foods, and birds, which compromise a secondary but locally important portion of the foods, other prey varieties are seldom taken by long-eared owls anywhere. Infrequently, reptiles such as handful of species of snakes and lizards and even fewer amphibians such as frogs and toads. Generally these prey turn up more than singly only as far as is known in slightly arid warmer parts of the species range, mostly within the Canary islands and occasionally the American southwest. Fish are almost never recorded in the diet with a total of two prey fish species, both carp and further unidentified carp, recorded in Europe. Despite a rather high diversities of insects (and a low diversity of other invertebrates like arachnids) collected overall, especially in different parts of Eurasia, they are rarely significant contributors to the long-eared owl&#x27;s diet. Usually in Europe, if any insects are found in pellets, they tend to contribute less than 2% to the prey numbers. Similarly present but slight numbers of insects were noted in Israel as well. Exceptionally large contributor of insects, most often a variety of species or genera of beetle, to prey numbers are noted in some studies such as contributing 6.6% of the diet in Regional Park of Decima-Malafede in Italy, 17.5% in northeastern Greece and 13.3% in western Spain. The record contribution for insects surely for Europe was study in central Poland where a single beetle, the common cockchafer (&quot;Melolontha melolontha&quot;), was found to constitute 25% of the prey items. Based on a couple studies in Algeria, insects are a common supplemental food there, contributing up to about 17.3% of the prey items. On the isle of Tenerife in the Canary islands, an exceptional 33% of the food was recorded to be insects, with both bush crickets and field crickets contributing 14.8% each, although in broader Canary island studies the significance of insects is reduced to 10.4%. The maximum known contribution of insects to the diet in North America was merely 4.3% of the foods for communal roosting long-eared owls in southeast Idaho.

===Interspecies predatory relationships===

The long-eared owl occurs in multiple competitive environments of the temperate zone alongside other birds of prey. A wide variety of owls are especially likely to be encountered both in terms of shared nocturnality and a shared preference for rodent prey, which is favored by about 75% of owls found in North America and about 85% of the owls found in Europe and occasionally favored by nearly all owls in both continents. Much study has gone into contrasting the ecology of long-eared owls against other owls and also occasionally diurnal birds of prey, especially in terms of differences in dietary habits and habitat preferences. In Europe, arguably the most populous owl is likely the tawny owl, which has therefore warranted a considerable number of comparisons with long-eared owls. While tawny owls overlap in prey preferences with the long-eared owl, it tends to show greater dietary flexibility, with larger contributions of secondary prey such as birds, reptiles and amphibians and insects. For example, in southern Sweden, the food niche breadth of tawny owls was roughly three times greater than that of long-eared owls. Generally tawny owls prefer more extensively wooded environments than long-eared owls but can adapt as well as the long-eared to forest fragmentation and peri-urbanisation, thus often competing rather directly over foods. While the tawny owl usually selects slightly larger prey on average than long-eared owls, often over mean prey mass, studied size of common voles hunted in central Lithuania showed that both long-eared and tawny owls selected larger than average voles, with average caught estimated at against the average weight surveyed by humans at . Surprisingly, especially in the non-breeding season in this study, long-eared owls in Lithuania tended to select larger voles on average (at ) than did tawny owls (). Despite the potential for competition and mortality (for long-eared owls) in the interspecific relationship between the tawny and long-eared owls, the proximity of tawny owls in a study from Switzerland appeared to have no deleterious effect on the breeding on the long-eared species. A few studies have examined the habits of the little owl, probably the next most common European owl and just ahead of the long-eared owl in third, and the long-eared owl in areas where their somewhat overlapping habitat preferences draw them into similar areas. However, the long-eared owl takes larger prey on average usually than little owls, since it focuses more on rodents rather than invertebrates like insects and earthworms and, especially during winter, varies its prey compositions less so than the smaller species. Also, the long-eared owl requires some timbered spots for roosting purposes while little owls can adapt to both treeless and partially treed areas as well as, in Spain at least, more heavily modified areas by humans. Many diurnal raptors in Europe broadly overlap in dietary habits, largely taking voles where they are available, including most species of harrier, buzzards and some falcons, especially common kestrels (&quot;Falco tinnunculus&quot;). Other than occasional predatory interactions, competition is limited with most of these diurnal birds of prey due to the temporal differences of their habits. In Europe, several other owls, from ones much smaller than to a few species much larger than a long-eared owl, prefer voles and/or lemmings as prey but often differ considerably in their habitat preferences, distributions, nesting habits and/or hunting habits so the long-eared owls are largely naturally partitioned from competing directly with them.

On a broader scale, both short-eared owls and barn owls potentially compete for resources with long-eared owls. Despite considerable overlap in both range and diet, long-eared owls are largely buffered from considerable competition with short-eared owls by habitat preferences, as the short-eared owls always venture to more open habitats, generally roosting and nesting in tall grasses rather than timber, and seldom, if ever, hunt in the same edge habitats as the long-eared species. In western Russia when compared to short-eared owl, long-eared owl showed less of a tendency to appear in cluster where prey was concentrated, most likely because of the habitat differences. In both western Russia and further east in western Siberia, the short-eared tended to take more tundra voles in addition to common voles, while long-eared owls focused more exclusively on common voles. Comparisons between barn and long-eared owls have been made in many areas of the latter species less extensive range. The habitats used by the barn and long-eared owls are not mutually exclusive nor are their prey species. Despite being similar aerial hunters of open areas, barn owls differ in life history in many respects from long-eared owls, in part by being cavity nesters. While their dietary habits can appear similar and show similar dependence on small mammals, barn owls are somewhat more generalized and catholic as feeders, with less of a heavy reliance on voles. Barn owls can live quite well on virtually any small mammal assemblage. In some parts of Europe, the two species&#x27; food niche breadth is comparable or even slightly higher in the long-eared. However, globally barn owls are much more wide-ranging, more tropical in their central range and globally have a much wider prey spectrum than long-eared owls. Barn owls are also more widely adaptive to insular living than long-eared owls, and are capable living proficiently on a diversity of prey classes even in environments completely lacking small mammals. The American barn owl race is larger than the western barn owl race from Europe and relevant parts of Asia, being more comparable in body mass and foot and talon size to the tawny owl while the western race in Europe is roughly intermediate between the tawny and long-eared owls in body size and foot span. Consequently, in the Americas, barn owls tend to consistently take slightly larger prey than long-eared owls and tend to access a broader overall feeding niche. Despite the great adaptability and range of the barn owl, it was found in a study from France that they experience higher mortality due to starvation than long-eared and tawny owls. This was attributed to the barn owl&#x27;s inferior lipid fat reserves while they attempt to survive the cooler seasons within temperate climates, as they are better suited to survival in warmer climates.

North America has more species of owl than Europe and can be considered a more competitive environment for long-eared owls living there. However, again, in most cases habitat preferences, slight partitioning in dietary preferences (which may be in prey species or body sizes of prey selected) and life histories generally allow most species to persist even when living in proximity to one another. As throughout their range, long-eared owls tend to differ from most other North American owls by being much more migratory in nature. Therefore, cyclic food variations affect them differently and are less likely to be the direct cause of winter mortality than in more permanently residential owls. Oddly enough, among American owls, long-eared owls most strongly mirror the much smaller northern saw-whet owl in distribution, migratory habits and, to a lesser extent, food habits. The main food of saw-whet owls tends to be &quot;Peromyscus&quot; mice where they are available and, like most owls, their rodent food selection can broadly overlap with that of long-eared owls. It has been posited that the less broadly ranging occurrence of long-eared owls in general compared to in their European range is in part due to greater resource competition between them and the two widespread screech owls, the eastern (&quot;Megascops asio&quot;) and western screech owls (&quot;Megascops kennicotti&quot;). However, the feeding niche tends to be much wider and more opportunistic in screech owls, which often feed on a diversity of invertebrates (mainly insects but also crayfish) and alternate prey (a higher balance of birds and frogs, for instance) and so are unlikely to competitively limit rodent numbers to the detriment of long-eared owls.

The most easily observed and most dramatic portion of interspecies owl and raptor ecology is interspecific predations. In this regard, long-eared owls are much more often the victims rather than the predators. Their generally successful life history on the contrary often makes long-eared owls perhaps more vulnerable than most other medium-sized owls to predations and even perhaps many smaller owl species. These include nesting in relatively open abandoned bird nests rather than hard to access cavities. Also, long-eared owls tendency to occur in quite open areas whilst hunting coupled with the loud vocalizations (including begging calls of their fledglings) and other auditory displays are all likely to court predators. In Europe, their most serious predators tend to be the Eurasian eagle-owl and the northern goshawk (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;). One account recorded 768 instances of predation by eagle-owls and 317 by goshawks (or 55% of the owl prey for recorded for goshawks in Europe). Long-eared owls rank in the five most regular predated bird species by eagle-owls in Europe. Some biologists feel that long-eared owls tendency to avoid richer prey concentrations in favor of opener habitats and spatial usage, especially while migrating and wintering, is partial dictated by the detection of eagle-owl (and perhaps goshawk) activity, so therefore the eagle-owl has a serious influence on the long-eared owl&#x27;s life history. In general, long-eared owls endure predation by a formidable array of diurnal birds of prey in Europe. It is likely that largely perch hunting raptor such as &quot;Buteo&quot; and most eagles may either chance upon an owl roost during a hunting foray or encounter a long-eared owl perhaps during overlapping activity around dawn or dusk, while large falcons are likely to only strike one down when an owl is flushed during daytime. Goshawks and other &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks are a particularly deadly threat among diurnal raptors due to their intensive searching hunting methods and willingness to dive into wooded thickets holding roosting owls. Beyond goshawks, diurnal raptors in Europe known to be predators of long-eared owls of potentially any age are known to include golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), Bonelli&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila fasciata&quot;), eastern imperial eagle (&quot;Aquila heliaca&quot;), greater spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga clanga&quot;), lesser spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga pomarina&quot;), black kite (&quot;Milvus migrans&quot;), red kite (&quot;Milvus milvus&quot;), white-tailed eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;), common buzzard, rough-legged buzzard (&quot;Buteo lagopus&quot;), peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), saker falcon (&quot;Falco cherrug&quot;) and even (in two cases) the slightly smaller Eurasian sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;). Other than eagle-owls, tawny owls and Ural owls (&quot;Strix uralensis&quot;) regularly kill long-eared owls where their ranges meet, though in some cases these may begin as territorial attacks by the &quot;Strix&quot; owls, the smaller long-eared may be consumed regardless.

In North America, the range of predators of long-eared owls is no less daunting. Undoubtedly the most dangerous American predator is the great horned owl. Similarly as in its European eagle-owl counterpart, horned owls kill long-eared owls regardless of season and conditions. However, despite many accounts of predation, long-eared owls do not generally seem to be as prominent in the diet of great horned owls, at least as so far documented, as they are in the diet of Eurasian eagle-owls. Barred owls can also be somewhat serious predators of long-eared owls as well. Rarer acts of predation on long-eared owls in North America have reportedly been committed by spotted owls (&quot;Strix occidentalis&quot;) and even their cousins, the short-eared owl. Diurnal predators of long-eared owls including some species that also hunt them in Europe such as golden eagles, northern goshawks and peregrine falcons, as well as bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;), Cooper&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;), red-tailed hawk (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;) and red-shouldered hawk (&quot;Buteo lineatus&quot;). Though less well documented throughout the range, long-eared owls are also vulnerable to mammalian predators, mainly near the nest. Suspected or confirmed predators in Europe are often European pine martens or stone martens (&quot;Martes foina&quot;), which are likely to depredate nestlings but also will consume eggs and adults if they are able to ambush them. Martens are also a potential threat in North America, as are the North American porcupine (&quot;Erethizon dorsatum&quot;), bullsnake (&quot;Pituophis catenifer&quot;) and, especially, the raccoon (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;) (the latter species may semi-regularly kill and eat brooding adult female long-eared owls). Corvids, many of which build the nests long-eared owls use, such as magpies and crows will also semi-regularly raid the long-eared owl&#x27;s nests and eat the eggs or nestlings. On the other side of the equation, long-eared owls themselves may infrequently prey on smaller owls. This species has been known to hunt eastern screech owls, little owls, Eurasian pygmy owls (&quot;Glaucidium passerinum&quot;) and boreal owls (&quot;Aegolius funereus&quot;), as well as the young of the common kestrel.

==Breeding==

Long-eared owls tend to be monogamous breeders. Non-migratory populations are usually monogamous throughout the year, the pair bond being renewed annually. A study in Idaho determined that long-eared owls were locally extremely monogamous, with no extra-pair fertilizations were detected in 59 nestlings from 12 nests. There is a single record of a male breeding with 2 females in Netherlands, a very atypical case. Similarly, evidence of polyandry and alloparenting was found in a nest in western Montana where the four offspring of the female owl had two fathers, one of which was related to the female. Males claim their territory with singing and display flights with wing clapping. Singing normally starts at dusk on calm evenings and may continue through the night, clear windless moonlit nights are preferred. The song is usually delivered from a perch, most often at medium height in trees or from the upper half near the canopy, sometimes in flight. Males are responsive to playback during the period leading up to the breeding season (especially during courtship), to such a degree 45% territories would&#x27;ve been undetected in Spain if males has not responded to recordings (as opposed to listening for spontaneous callings). Often between 8 and 50 pairs are recorded in different parts of the range in a typical range of . In Scotland, about 17% of the 9-18 pairs per were non-breeders. Typical territories for pairs are in Finland when voles are plentiful. Several pairs may nest rather close together nonetheless. The minimal distance is normally around between active nests, but in Idaho a nearest nest distance of only was recorded. When food is abundant, about 10-12 pairs, infrequently as many as 50, may nest within area of . Pairs may tolerate each other in the same patch of trees while nesting if food supplies are abundant. A study in Province of Pisa of Italy of 32 territories found 10-15 pairs per with a mean nest spacing of . In a south-central Idaho study area, pair occurred on average apart. The highest densities may come from central Europe. The average density in central Europe is typically around 10-12 pairs per . However, in Brandenburg, Germany, over a 24-year study, it was found the average density was 72.7 pairs per . Based on studies from Michigan and Wyoming, anywhere from 10 to 100 pairs per was estimated, with the average range in Wyoming riparian habitat about . Densities appeared lower in the Snake River area (0.28-0.42 pairs per square km) than elsewhere in southern Idaho (0.64-1.55 pairs per square km). Globally, many pairs of long-eared owl occupy the same territory all year around but most prefer to use a different nest each year even if the same nest as last year is still in good standing. Females typically take on the duty of inspecting potential nesting sites and duets with its mate; perched on a chosen nest, she sings to contact the male, later vocal activity is confined to weak calls only heard at short range. During displays, females have also been recorded doing the wing clap display but much less intensely than males. Copulation tends to occur close to the nest. In Germany, it was recorded that the male precedes copulation with calls and display flights, followed by strong waving wing signals and tilting their body while perched near female and/or the nest. Copulation has also been observed on both the ground and the trees, preceded frequently by a duet, a male aerial display which ending in descent to ground and a flight by the female. Boundary fights between males are unrecorded in this species. Breeding occurs later in the year than sympatric species such as tawny owls and barn owls perhaps due to their more strongly migratory ways. Rarely mating may occur early as February in cooler temperate areas, but the pairs copulations usually take place in March or April. Winter breeding detected as new juveniles of 14–18 days of age were recorded in early February in Slovakia. Other prior reports of winter breeding are known from Italy, in two cases, as well as in the Czech Republic.
Normally nests in stick nest of large birds, i.e. &quot;Corvus&quot;, &quot;Pica&quot;, raptors and &quot;Ardea&quot; herons. Other nest builders in Europe can often include common wood pigeons and Eurasian sparrowhawks. In Britain and Finland 84% of 239 and 85 nest were made by carrion (&quot;Corvus corone&quot;) or hooded crows (&quot;Corvus cornix&quot;) and Eurasian magpies. In England and Finland, 77% and 66% of the nest were in conifers, respectively. In Brandenburg, Germany, 90% of the nest were built by carrion crows and most were in &quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;. In different studies of Idaho, nearly all known nests were in old corvid nests (most being in juniper). In one large study, nest heights, which averaged , and diameter of the nest construction, which averaged , were deemed likely to be the most significant criteria for nest selection. In Ontario, conifers were usually used, often &quot;Pinus&quot; or &quot;Juniperus&quot;, in corvid nests between high, but mostly between . Nest height averaged in Great Britain. In Slovenia, long-eared owls preferred coniferous trees for breeding (in almost exclusively corvid nests), those that nested in deciduous trees had higher nest mortality especially earlier in the season due to higher predation rates. Similarly, nest site selection was largely correlated to predation risk in Spain, with ivy and tree canopy coverage less important than high scrub cover from below, in part because terrestrial predators were more common in the particular study area than aerial ones. In northeast Switzerland, nesting location are selected for anti-predator features, among 38 nesting sites, the ones seemingly preferred bore denser forest edges, greater canopy cover and were within conifers much more so than were prevalent in the overall environment, while the vicinities of buildings were avoided in the study area. An unusual case of urban breeding long-eared owls was observed in Moscow, Russia, where a loose colony was observed to form. The Moscow nesting was thought to be the result of synanthropization by the owls, in part due to lower predation risk in the urban areas versus rural vicinities (where predation was 6.6% higher). The mean distance of nesting owls in Moscow was whereas it was more than twice the distance in nearby rural areas. Tree nests are usually under above the ground, and can sometimes be so small that the wings and tail of brooding female may be visible from below. More infrequently than avian tree nests, leaf nests of tree squirrels, hawk nests in cacti and cliff nests of various birds may be used. While they usually take up already abandoned nest sites, sometimes long-eared owls are capable of chasing off prior occupant of nest even including other raptors (extending to fierce &quot;Accipiters&quot; such as sparrowhawks, sharp-shinned hawks and even larger Cooper&#x27;s hawks) indicative of their potential for fierceness and tenacity. Other than other bird&#x27;s nests, alternate nesting sites have been used but appear to be usually rare or uncommon. Among these, are shallow depressions on the ground. Some ground nest locations recorded (in Europe) have included among heather, bracken and bramble, and even on reed beds, rabbit warrens. Some nests have been recorded in wicker baskets placed in trees for ducks. In North America, pairs of ground nest were found in each west-central Montana and in Okavagan, British Columbia, in all cases between the roots of or the ground immediate adjacent to the base of trees or bushes (with two other historic records of ground nesting in North America). Artificial nesting platforms made of twigs for the owls are also locally accepted. In Woodwalton Fen reserve of eastern England, 71 nests were built in wicker baskets set out for owls. Also in Yizre&#x27;el in Israel, 6 of 16 nest baskets hung in &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; were used by long-eared owls, with all occupied by February. In this general area of Israel, at least 72 other nest baskets for long-eared owls have been set out, to encourage the rodent controlling birds. Exceptionally, long-eared owls have nested in shallow cavities, in hollow willows or oaks, tree stumps or holes in cliffsides, however as a rule they tend to not be cavity nesters. 6.5% of 153 nests in Great Britain were on natural surfaces (mostly the ground) rather than animal nests. Nesting vicinities where previous attempts were successful are more likely to be reused, i.e. in Idaho where 48% of prior nesting areas were reused after successful attempts.

Egg-laying is between normally between late March and early May in most of the range. Egg laying dates in the northeastern United States, in a sample of 42 eggs, were between March 14 and May 30. Additional records in southern Canada show laying as occurring at as late as June 5. 43 eggs in Ontario were laid between March 19 to May 24, more than half between April 15 and May 5. In northern Italy, the mean egg laying date was March 27. Exceptional eggs were recorded as early as December 31 to January 3 in Spain. Re-nesting can occur within about 20 days after a clutch is lost. In Europe up to two broods have been successfully been raised at times of food abundance. Generally the female lays 3-5 eggs (sometimes more if food is unusually abundant). Larger clutches are typical further north in the range. Record sized clutches have been recorded for Europe of up to 8 eggs in Sweden in years of a “vole plague” while record sized clutches worldwide were recorded of 10–11 in the Kazan area of Russia in similar conditions. In Great Britain, the average clutch size was recorded as 3.9 while in Germany it was 5.5 and, similarly, in Slovenia it was 5.6. In a study from Montana, the mean clutch size was 5. The pure white eggs are on average in both North America and central Europe and weight about . At 1-5 day intervals (on average 2), the eggs are laid on the bottom of nesting area. A clutch of 7 eggs takes 10 to 11 days to lay. Incubation begins with the first egg and continues for about 27–28 days (in extreme cases from about 21 to 30 days). The female alone incubates while the male provides food, which is brought direct to nest. She may leave the nest early on to feed but does so much less later into incubation. A study in Montana found that corticosterone levels were considerably higher in adults of both sexes during the breeding season than during the non-breeding season, suggesting that the breeding season is more stressful on the owls.

The young hatch at 2 day intervals at any point between very late April and June. The average weight of 52 hatchlings in Montana was . Their eyes open at 5–7 days (averaging 6.4 days in Montana) and they are brooded by the mother for about 2 weeks, often while the male perches nearby and watches over. The female alone feeds the chicks. In Idaho, the male was recorded to 2.5 times more prey deliveries during nesting than did the female. Injury feigning displays have been recorded at the nestling stage as an anti-predation measure. Usually long-eared owls are less bold in nest defense than some other owls, &quot;Strix&quot; owls for example, but they are capable of fierce protective attack nonetheless. Nesting defense by parents increased in Italy further into breeding season, with older nestlings being defended more vigorously. Females do a majority of nest defenses. Owl pairs incurring higher levels of regular disturbance are more likely to have a milder nest defense. During a defensive display, the parent ruffles up their plumage and partially spreads the wings to half open, trampling from one foot to the other, hissing and bill snapping and can look surprisingly large in this posture. If a perceived threat continues towards the owls, they may leap up and try to rake and grab at the threat with their talons. Even animals as large as humans may find themselves the victim of long-eared owl defensive attacks if they approach or, especially, if they climb up to a nest. The young leave the nest at 20–27 days of age (average about 22 days) but are initially flightless, often climbing about surrounding branches. At this stage they may be referred to as &quot;branchers&quot;. Quite often the young fall to the ground, but they are usually able to climb back up using their claws and bill with heavy wing flapping. At dusk the begging branchers call to their parents with high pitched notes to indicate their location. At about 35–37 days, they are fully fledged and can fly well, but they often follow their parents and are fed by them for up to about 2 months, continuing to make high pitched calls. In Slovenia, independence was gained about 50–80 days after hatching, while in Idaho it was about 45 to 56 days.

Normally in North America the species produces one clutch per year, but 2 clutches in a year have been recorded in high vole years. An exceptional double brood was recorded in Idaho due to high food availability, allowing the pair to successfully raise all 11 nestlings to fledgling, while in same season 3 other females in same grove were able to produce an average of 5.3 fledglings in their single broods. Like other species using open nests, rather than enclosed cavities, the species has relatively short fledging period and quickly moves away from the dangerous situation of the nest site. Nesting success averaged 46% between two study years in a study of 112 nests in Idaho with raccoon predation considered the most serious cause of nesting failure. A different Idaho study of 24 nests showed that the owls fledged an average of 3.7 young per nest. In Montana, the mean number hatched per nest was 3.8 and mean number to have fledged per nest was approximately 2.2. 59% of 78 nesting attempts failed in Britain, with an average clutch size per successful pair of 3.91 to 4.53. 41 of 78 continuously monitored in this British study nest successfully produced 1 or more fledglings. In another British study, of 58 monitored pairs over 4 years, 83% laid eggs, 63% hatched one or more young, and 57% fledged young, with an average of 3.2 young fledged per successful nest. In yet another English study, this time exclusively of owls using wicker baskets, 50.7% of 71 attempts managed to fledge young. Among the wicker basket users, earlier nesters (i.e. March-early April) raised larger broods and had more fledglings than later (late April-early May), in part due to rising water tables making prey capture less ideal later in nesting season. For 6 pairs of long-eared owls using wicker baskets in Israel, the mean brood size was 3.6 and mean number of young owls to leave the nest was 3. At all stages and in all regions, reproduction tends to be more successful when prey populations are higher. In continental Europe, conditions are better than in England or Finland, perhaps due to the large population of common voles there that are absent in the more northerly countries, and nesting success averages higher. However, breeding success still is reliant on prey populations. In an area of southern Germany, one cold spring with few voles no breeding pairs were found. A year later, with a warm spring and many voles, 19 breeding pairs took up residence in the study area. First year mortality of long-eared owls has been calculated in Germany as 52% and 31%. In Brandenburg, Germany, of 867 breeding attempts, 36.6% (335) pairs were successful in raising 1,468 young, which equates to 1.57 fledgling per all pairs that attempted, 4.31 per successful pair. The Brandenburg data shows that after 1990, when conservation minded farming initiative began, numbers increased significantly. Also in Brandenburg, in one case, 2 successive females to the same male were killed, the male mate was able to pair with a third female and resulting in a late successful fledging (August 24). In Slovenia, as studied between 1984 and 1993, of 79 nests, 32 (40%) produced young, 37 (47%) failed completely, and 10 (12%) failed after hatching. The Slovenian average number of owls hatched was 2.4 per nest (5.3 per successful nest) and the average number of owls fledged was 1.6 per nest (3.9 per successful nest). In Pisa, Italy, long-eared owl pairs produced a mean of 0.95 per territorial pair and 2.13 per successful pair. In central Slovenia, 57 nests produced an average of 5.7 eggs per clutch. Of the 51 fledged owls, 31 died in the study, 22 of which were due to mammal and bird predation, 6 due to starvation, 2 due to road collisions and 1 drowned in ditch. In Britain, the most common diagnosed cause of nest failure was egg theft by humans (accounting for 28.2% of 46 failed nests). Banding studies show that the long-eared owl typically have a short lifespan, with more than 91% of 105 owls recovered in North America of determined age being 4 years or younger. The oldest recorded in these efforts was banded in New York and recovered in Ontario at the age of 11 years and 4 months. Another one may have been over 15 years old, however. One exceptional isolated record is known of a European long-eared owl of just under 28 years of age. Annual survivorship in Germany and Switzerland for adults is 69%.

==Status==

The long-eared owl is rather common and widespread in many regions. With a range of 80 million square kilometers, it is easily one of the most widely found owls. The IUCN estimates the total population between 2 million and 5.5 million, placing it as one of the most numerous owls beyond the wider ranging barn owl and less wide-ranging little owl (both likely between 5 and 10 million total birds) and roughly equaling the total population of great horned owls. The long-eared owl is more numerous than its more scarce but more wide-ranging cousin, the short-eared owl, with the peak number possible of short-ears roughly equivalent to the minimum number of long-ears. Their range of limit for breeding is typically in Mediterranean type arid, hot climates, where terrestrial insects and reptiles may prevail over small, sociable rodents, the long-eared owl is cut-off, whereas these are peak areas for barn owls. In the north, it is scarce to absent in areas of the deep boreal forest and the treeless northern areas such as around large wetland bogs or lower tundra, where the short-eared owl tends to supplant them. Densities of populations depend on availability of food. Local threats are typically pesticides and persecution. Out of myth and ignorance, this species has long been persecuted by humans. In many areas, some humans may carelessly shoot at any crow-like nest in order to destroy the contents, out of resentment for the crow&#x27;s perception as a pest. In North America, hunters historically often shot long-eared owls as all owls were badly persecuted. Even though it was perceived early in the 20th century that the species is actually beneficial to human interests, many hunters continued to shoot them, claiming that they represent young individuals of the then nationally despised great horned owl. Largely in correlation with persecution, long-eared owls were recorded as formerly abundant and then rare in North America in the early 20th century. Long-eared owls potentially face lethal contamination with heavy metals such as mercury, organic biocides, including insecticides, fungicides and rodenticides and PCBs recorded. Pesticides seem to affect the species less than those predators with more varied diets and those that eat carrion. High levels of contamination were found in long-eared owl pellets in Serbia, with the concentrations of pollutants in prey that are sourced from industrial and agricultural practices in the region. Like many birds, they may be vulnerable to helminths, which are probably underrated as a potential source of mortality. Other parasites and mites may reduce health of populations. West Nile virus and Salmonella have been the recorded source of mortality for some long-eared owls. Anticoagulants may also threaten this species. In the Canary islands, it has become increasingly scarce due to loss of habitat. Many long-eared owls are also killed by road traffic. High owl mortality was particularly noted along roadways in France, especially due to common vole being numerous in roadside areas. It was proposed that letting vegetation grow may mitigate some mortalities. During 1963–1995, of 128 dead long-eared owls found in England, 89 were females and 34 were males; 61% turned had died from collisions (40% from those with vehicles). In this study from England, high levels of DDE (metabolite of DDT) and HEOD found in long-eared owls prior to 1977, similar levels to those seen in falcons there, lessened in later samples but 2 birds still had fatal levels of pesticide contamination. In areas such as Switzerland, to offset persecution and increase survival as well as to allow observers to watch them more easily, wintering owls in towns and cities were fed daily white lab mice. Breeding can be promoted by artificial platforms of twigs in bushes or trees. Also augmented feeding may ensure survival during low food winters. An attempt to release captive raised long-eared owls in the wild in Italy was largely unsuccessful. Of these, 3 of 8 owls seemed to disperse successfully while the others died or disappeared, while 8 tawny owls released all but 1 seemed to successfully disperse. The species has actually increased in Iran, rising from 25 records over 12 decades to 49 records in two decades (between late 70s and 1997). Breeding was confirmed in up to 12 regions for the Persian breeding population and between 1997 and 2014 there were 32 non-breeding and 17 breeding records.

In southern California (San Diego county and Orange county), long-eared owls are thought to have lost more than 55% of their range due to habitat alterations. A decreasing trend has been observed in wintering owls in New Jersey, with 9 of 58 known roosts eliminated due to land development, while the remaining 49 have shown reductions or are no longer used over the course of 30 years. Land use changes and habitat destruction accounts for reduced habitat quality and lower vole populations, with more adaptable raptors such as great horned owls and hawks exploiting much of what remains to the detriment of long-eared owls. A similar reduction was noted over 20 years in Pennsylvania. Broader studies of banding across Canada, gathered during long-term monitoring from consistent annual bird counts from 1966 to 1992, showed that long-eared owls have declined relatively significantly. A net total 0.98% decline was recorded over the survey time. This was considered the second greatest reduction behind short-eared owl and burrowing owl (&quot;Athene cunicularia&quot;). Furthermore, among the 19 raptors surveyed in Canada, these 3 owls showed the most declining trends. The long-eared owl was apparently the most scarce of the 6 sub-boreal owl species surveyed. A similar trend has been detected throughout North America with a very large net 1.6% reduction overall during Christmas Bird Counts (CBC), again making it the most severe decline for an owl behind only the short-eared owl and the two related owl species seemed to have had the most severe declines of all 28 raptor species mentioned in these CBC surveys.

==In art==
John James Audubon illustrated the &quot;Long-eared Owl - &quot;Strix otus&quot;&quot; as Plate 383 in &quot;Birds of America&quot;, published London, 1827–38. The print was engraved by Robert Havell in 1837. The original watercolour was purchased from Audubon&#x27;s destitute widow by The New York History Society.

<doc id="324628" wikidata="Q1558858" url="?curid=324628" title="Boarding house">
<text>A boarding house is a house (frequently a family home) in which lodgers rent one or more rooms on a nightly basis and sometimes for extended periods of weeks, months, or years. The common parts of the house are maintained, and some services, such as laundry and cleaning, may be supplied. It normally provides &quot;room and board,&quot; with some meals as well as accommodation.

Lodgers legally obtain a licence, not exclusive possession, to use their rooms and so the landlord retains the right of access.

==Arrangements==

Formerly boarders would typically share washing, breakfast, and dining facilities; in recent years, it has become common for each room to have its own washing and toilet facilities. Such boarding houses were often found in English seaside towns (for tourists) and college towns (for students). It was common for there to be one or two elderly long-term residents. &quot;The phrase &quot;boardinghouse reach&quot; [referring to a diner reaching far across a dining table] comes from an important variant of hotel life. In boardinghouses, tenants rent rooms and the proprietor provides family-style breakfasts and evening dinners in a common dining room. Traditionally, the food was put on the table, and everyone scrambled for the best dishes. Those with a long, fast reach ate best.&quot;

Boarders can often arrange to stay bed-and-breakfast (bed and breakfast only), half-board (bed, breakfast and dinner only), or full-board (bed, breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Especially for families on holiday with children, boarding (particularly on a full-board basis) was an inexpensive alternative and much cheaper than staying in all but the cheapest hotels.

== History ==

Boarding houses were common in most US cities throughout the 19th century and until the 1950s. In Boston, in the 1830s, when landlords and their boarders were added up, between one third and one half of the city&#x27;s entire population lived in a boarding house. Boarding houses ran from large purpose-built buildings down to &quot;genteel ladies,&quot; who rented a room or two as a way of earning a little extra money. Large houses were converted to boarding houses, as wealthy families moved to more fashionable neighborhoods. The boarders in the 19th century ran the gamut as well, from well-off businessmen to poor laborers, and from single people to families. In the 19th century, between a third to half of urban dwellers rented a room to boarders or were boarders themselves. In New York in 1869, the cost of living in a boarding house ranged from $2.50 to $40 a week. Some boarding houses attracted people with particular occupations or preferences, such as vegetarian meals.

The boarding house reinforced some social changes: it made it feasible for people to move to a large city and away from their families. The distance from relatives brought social anxieties and complaints that the residents of boarding houses were not respectable. Boarding out gave people the opportunity to meet other residents and so they promoted some social mixing. That had advantages, such as learning new ideas and new people&#x27;s stories, and also disadvantages, such as occasionally meeting disreputable or dangerous people. Most boarders were men, but women found that they had limited options: a co-ed boarding house might mean meeting objectionable men, but an all-female boarding house might be or at least be suspected of being a brothel.

Boarding houses attracted criticism: in &quot;1916, Walter Krumwilde, a Protestant minister, saw the rooming house or boardinghouse system [as] &quot;spreading its web like a spider, stretching out its arms like an octopus to catch the unwary soul.&quot; Attempts to reduce boarding house availability had a gendered impact, as boarding houses were typically operated or managed by women &quot;matrons,&quot; and closing boarding houses reduced that opportunity for women to make a living from operating such houses.

Later, groups such as the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association provided heavily-supervised boarding houses for young women. Boarding houses were viewed as &quot;brick-and-mortar chastity belts&quot; for young unmarried women, which protected them from the vices in the city. The Jeanne d&#x27;Arc Residence in Chelsea, Manhattan, which was operated by an order of nuns, aimed to provide a dwelling space for young French seamstresses and nannies. Married women who boarded with their families in boarding houses were accused of being too lazy to do all of the washing, cooking, and cleaning necessary to keep house or to raise children properly. While there is an association between boarding houses and women renters, men also rented, notably the poet-authors Walt Whitman and Edgar Allan Poe.

In the decades after the 1880s, urban reformers began working on modernizing cities; their efforts to create &quot;uniformity within areas, less mixture of social classes, maximum privacy for each family, much lower density for many activities, buildings set back from the street, and a permanently built order&quot; all meant that housing for single people had to be cut back or eliminated. By the early 1930s, urban reformers were typically using codes and zoning to enforce &quot;uniform and protected single-use residential district[s] of private houses,&quot; the reformers&#x27; preferred housing type. In 1936, the FHA Property Standards defined a dwelling as &quot;any structure used principally for residential purposes&quot; and noted that &quot;commercial rooming houses and tourist homes, sanitariums, tourist cabins, clubs, or fraternities would not be considered dwellings&quot; as they did not have the &quot;private kitchen and a private bath&quot; that reformers viewed as essential in a &quot;proper home.&quot; As a result, boarding houses became less common in the early 20th century. Another factor that reduced boarding house numbers was that improved mass transit options made it feasible for more city residents to live in the suburbs and work in the city.

By the 1930s, boarding houses were becoming less common in most of the United States. In the 1930s and 1940s, &quot;rooming or boarding houses had been taken for granted as respectable places for students, single workers, immigrants, and newlyweds to live when they left home or came to the city.&quot; However, with the housing boom in the 1950s, middle-class newcomers could increasingly afford their own homes or apartments, which meant that rooming and boarding houses were beginning to be used more often by postsecondary &quot;students, the working poor, or the unemployed.&quot; By the 1960s, rooming and boarding houses were deteriorating, as official city policies tended to ignore them.

== Similar concepts ==
The common lodging-house or flophouse usually offered a space to sleep but little else. When used for temporary purposes, the arrangement was similar to a hostel. Flophouse beds may offer dormitory-style space for as little as one night at a time.

Group homes, residences that provide supervision and assisted living for adults with neurological disabilities or children unable to live with family, share characteristics with boarding houses.

A lodging house, also known in the United States as a rooming house, may or may not offer meals.

Single-room occupancy (SRO) buildings rent individual rooms to residents and have a shared bathroom; some may have a shared kitchen space for residents to cook their own meals.

Dormitory accommodations for postsecondary students are similar to a boarding houses when they include cafeterias.

In the 2010s, microapartments, with one or two rooms rented and access to shared common spaces in the building, are very similar to boarding houses. WeWork, a company mostly known for its shared coworking rental spaces, is also offering shared housing arrangements in which renters get a private bedroom but share a kitchen, living room, and other common areas.

Bed and breakfast accommodation (B&amp;B), which exists in many countries in the world (such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Australia), is a specialized form of boarding house in which the guests or boarders normally stay only on a bed-and-breakfast basis, and long-term residence is rare.
However, some B&amp;B accommodation is made available on a long-term basis to British local authorities which are legally obliged to house persons and families for whom they have no social housing available. Some such boarding houses allow large groups with low incomes to share overcrowded rooms or otherwise exploit people with problems rendering them vulnerable, such as those with irregular immigration status. Such a boarding-house may well cease to be attractive to short-term lodgers, and the residents may remain in unsatisfactory accommodation for long periods. Much old seaside accommodation is so used since cheap flights have reduced demand for their original seasonal holiday use.
Apart from the worldwide spread of the concept of the B&amp;B, there are equivalents of the British boarding houses elsewhere in the world. For example, in Japan, minshuku are an almost exact equivalent although the normal arrangement would be the equivalent of the English half-board. In Hawaii, where the cost of living is high and incomes barely keep pace, it is common to take in lodgers (who are boarders in English terminology) that share the burden of the overall rent or mortgage payable.

In the Indian subcontinent, boarders are also known as &quot; Paying guests.&quot; They stay in a home and share a room with domestic facilities. Rates are nominal and monthly charges usually include food, bed, table, and a cupboard. The rent can go higher for a room in an upscale locality with facilities like single occupancy, air conditioning, and high-speed wireless internet access.

== Legal restrictions ==
In the United States, zoning has been used by neighborhoods to limit boarding houses or ban them outright.

<doc id="324629" wikidata="Q444145" url="?curid=324629" title="Bowood House">
<text>Bowood is a Grade I listed Georgian country house in Wiltshire, England, that has been owned for more than 250 years by the Fitzmaurice family. The house, with interiors by Robert Adam, stands on extensive grounds which include a garden designed by Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown. It is adjacent to the village of Derry Hill, halfway between Calne and Chippenham. The greater part of the house was demolished in 1956.

Since 1754 the estate has been the seat of the Earls of Shelburne, created Marquess of Lansdowne in 1784. The ninth and present Marquess is Charles Petty-Fitzmaurice. Notable guests have included Founding Father Benjamin Franklin and Mirabeau, an early leader of the French Revolution, among others.

== History ==
The first house at Bowood was built circa 1725 on the site of a hunting lodge, by the former tenant Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 2nd Baronet, who had purchased the property from the Crown. His grandfather Sir Orlando Bridgeman, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, had been granted the lease by Charles II. Bridgeman got into financial strife, and in 1739 under a Chancery decree, the house and park were acquired by his principal creditor, Richard Long. In 1754 Long sold it to the first Earl of Shelburne, who engaged the architect Henry Keene to extend the house.
William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, who served as Prime Minister from 1782 to 1783, was created Marquess of Lansdowne to negotiate peace with America after the War of Independence. He furnished Bowood and his London home, Lansdowne House, with superb collections of paintings and classical sculpture, and commissioned Robert Adam to decorate the grander rooms in Bowood and to add a magnificent orangery, as well as a small menagerie for wild animals where a leopard and an orangutan were kept in the 18th century. Adam also built a fine mausoleum in the park for the first earl. Adam commissioned Benjamin Carter to sculpt chimney-pieces for the house.

In the 1770s the two parts of the house at Bowood (the &quot;Big House&quot; and the &quot;Little House&quot;) were joined by the construction of an enormous drawing room. 

In World War I, the 5th Marchioness set up an auxiliary Red Cross hospital in the orangery. During World War II, the Big House was first occupied by a school, then by the Royal Air Force. Afterwards it was left empty, and by 1955, it was so dilapidated that the 8th Marquess demolished it, employing architect F. Sortain Samuels to convert the Little House into a more comfortable home. Many country houses were knocked down at this period. Before it was demolished, the Adam dining room was auctioned and bought by the Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurance market, which dismantled it and re-installed it as the Committee Room in its 1958 building. The room was subsequently moved in 1986 to the 11th floor of its current building, also on Lime Street in the City of London. A portico from the house was re-erected at Roath Court, Cardiff.

The mausoleum was designated as Grade I listed in 1960, and the remaining parts of the main house were given the same status in 1972.

==21st century==

The remaining house is still large, and the front wing is open to the public with rooms, paintings and sculpture on display. One of the rooms was the laboratory of Joseph Priestley, who discovered oxygen there on 1 August 1774. In the year 2000, Bowood House was designated an ACS National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of the importance of Priestley&#x27;s discovery.

The lake was formed at the sacrifice of a village called Manning&#x27;s Hill, which to this day remains submerged. In 2007, divers found the remains of two cottages and stone walls under the water.

On the grounds are an adventure playground for children aged 12 and under, a large waterfall, and many gardens incorporating of rhododendron walks in May and June, and carpets of daffodils, narcissi and bluebells in spring.

== Park and gardens ==

Bowood was laid out over 2,000 acres (8 km2) in the 1760s. It replaced an earlier, more formal garden of avenues and wildernesses. Brown&#x27;s design encompasses a sinuous lake (almost 1 km long), with lawns sloping gently down from the house, and drifts of mature trees. Submerged in the lake are foundations of cottages forming the Mannings Hill hamlet, rediscovered by divers in 2007 in shallow but heavily sedimented water.

Brown planted an arboretum of rare trees in the Pleasure Grounds behind the walled garden, and these were added to in the mid-19th century when a pinetum was begun. It was at about this time that the Doric Temple folly, originally situated by Brown in the Pleasure Grounds, was moved to its present position beside the lake.

In 1766, Lady Shelburne visited the landscape garden created by Charles Hamilton on his Surrey estate, Painshill Park. Hamilton was then asked to improve on Capability Brown&#x27;s design. Working with Josiah Lane, the artisan stonemason who had built a cascade and grotto at Painshill Park, in the 1780s Hamilton added a cascade, grottoes and a hermit&#x27;s cave to the lakeside.

The Italianate terrace gardens on the south front of the house were commissioned by the 3rd Marquess. The Upper Terrace, by Sir Robert Smirke, was completed in 1818, and the Lower, by George Kennedy, was added in 1851. Originally planted with hundreds of thousands of annuals in intricate designs, the parterres are now more simply planted.

In 1987 the formal garden, pleasure ground, park and woodland were listed as Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. A golf course was laid out towards the west of the park in the late 1990s and a hotel was opened nearby on the Home Farm site in 2009.

<doc id="324632" wikidata="Q1575477" url="?curid=324632" title="Hemp oil">
<text>Hemp oil (hemp seed oil) is oil obtained by pressing hemp seeds. Cold pressed, unrefined hemp oil is dark to clear light green in color, with a nutty flavor. The darker the color, the grassier the flavour. It should not be confused with hash oil, a tetrahydrocannabinol-containing oil made from the &quot;Cannabis&quot; flower.
== Description ==
Refined hemp seed oil is clear and colorless, with little flavor. It is primarily used in body care products. Industrial hemp seed oil is used in lubricants, paints, inks, fuel, and plastics. Hemp seed oil is used in the production of soaps, shampoos and detergents. The oil has a 3:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 essential fatty acids. It may also be used as a feedstock for the large-scale production of biodiesel.

== Manufacture ==
Hemp seed oil is manufactured from varieties of &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; that do not contain significant amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive element present in the cannabis plant. This manufacturing process typically includes cleaning the seed to 99.99% before pressing the oil. There is no THC within the hemp seed, although trace amounts of THC may be found in hemp seed oil when plant matter adheres to the seed surface during manufacturing. The modern production of hemp seed oil, particularly in Canada, has successfully lowered THC values since 1998. Regular accredited sampling of THC in Canadian hemp seed oil shows THC levels usually below detection limit of 4 ppm (parts per million, or 4 mg/kg). Legal limit for THC content in foodstuffs in Canada is 10 ppm. In the EU some countries have limits defined such as 5 ppm or &quot;none detected&quot;, while other EU countries have no limits defined.

==Nutrition==

About 49% of the weight of hempseed is an edible oil that contains 76% as polyunsaturated fat, including omega-6 fatty acids such as linoleic acid (LA, 54%) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 3%), and omega-3 fatty acids such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 17%) and stearidonic acid (2%). Both LA and ALA are essential fatty acids. In addition, hempseed oil contains 5% to 11% monounsaturated fat and 5% to 7% saturated fat. In common with other oils and fats, hemp seed oil provides 9 kcal/g.

Compared with other culinary oils, hempseed oil is low in saturated fat and rich in polyunsaturated fat. It has a relatively low smoke point and is not suitable for frying. It is primarily used as a food oil and dietary supplement.

===Comparison to other vegetable oils===
==Wood finish==
Hemp oil is a &quot;drying oil&quot;, as it can polymerize into a solid form. Due to its polymer-forming properties, hemp oil is used on its own or blended with other oils, resins, and solvents as an impregnator and varnish in wood finishing, as a pigment binder in oil paints, and as a plasticizer and hardener in putty.

<text>The Sabians, sometimes also spelled Sabaeans or Sabeans, are a religious group mentioned three times in the Quran (as , in later sources ), where it is implied that they belonged to the &#x27;People of the Book&#x27; (). Their original identity, which seems to have been forgotten at an early date, has been called an &quot;unsolved Quranic problem&quot;. Modern scholars have variously identified them as Mandaeans, Manichaeans, Sabaeans, Elchasaites, Archontics,  (either as a type of Gnostics or as &quot;sectarians&quot;), or as adherents of the astral religion of Harran. Some scholars believe that it is impossible to establish their original identity with any degree of certainty.

At least from the ninth century on, the Quranic epithet &#x27;Sabian&#x27; was claimed by various religious groups who sought recognition by the Muslim authorities as a People of the Book deserving of legal protection (). Among those are the Sabians of Harran, adherents of a poorly understood ancient Semitic religion centered in the upper Mesopotamian city of Harran, who were described by Syriac Christian heresiographers as star worshippers. These Harranian Sabians practiced an old Semitic form of polytheism, combined with a significant amount of Hellenistic elements. Most of the historical figures known in the ninth–eleventh centuries as were probably either members of this Harranian religion or descendants of such members, most notably the Harranian astronomers and mathematicians Thabit ibn Qurra (died 901) and al-Battani (died 929).

From the early tenth century on, the term &#x27;Sabian&#x27; was applied to purported &#x27;pagans&#x27; of all kinds, such as to the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, or to Buddhists. Ibn Wahshiyya (died ) used the term for a type of Mesopotamian paganism that preserved elements of ancient Assyro-Babylonian religion.

Today in Iraq and Iran, the name &#x27;Sabian&#x27; is normally applied to the Mandaeans, a modern ethno-religious group who follow the teachings of their prophet John the Baptist (Yahya ibn Zakariya). These Mandaean Sabians, whose most important religious ceremony is baptism, are monotheistic, and their holy book is known as the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot;. Mandaean Sabian prophets include Adam, Seth, Noah, Shem and John the Baptist with Adam being the founder of the religion and John being the greatest and final prophet.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the Arabic word is disputed. According to one interpretation, it is the active participle of the Arabic root --&quot;ʾ&quot; (&#x27;to turn to&#x27;), meaning &#x27;converts&#x27;. Another widely cited hypothesis, first proposed by Daniel Chwolsohn in 1856, is that it is derived from an Aramaic root meaning &#x27;to dip&#x27; or &#x27;to baptize&#x27;.

The interpretation as &#x27;converts&#x27; was cited by various medieval Arabic lexicographers and philologists, and is supported by a tradition preserved by Ibn Hisham (died 834, editor of the earliest surviving biography of Muhammad) relating that the term was applied to Muhammad and the early Muslims by some of their enemies (perhaps by the Jews), who regarded them as having &#x27;turned&#x27; away from the proper religion and towards heresy. As such, the term may have been reappropriated by early Muslims, first as a self-designation and then to refer to other people from a Jewish Christian background who &#x27;turned&#x27; to the new revelations offered by Muhammad. In the context of the Quranic passages in which the term occurs, it may thus refer to all people who leave their faiths, finding fault in them, but who have yet to come to Islam. In this sense, the term would be similar in meaning to the term .

Understanding the term as a reference to &#x27;dippers&#x27; or &#x27;baptizers&#x27; fits best with those interpretations that identify the Quranic Sabians with baptist sects like the Elchasaites or the Mandaeans. However, this etymology has also been used to explain Ibn Hisham&#x27;s story about Muhammad and his followers being called &#x27;Sabians&#x27;, which would then be a reference to the ritual washing performed by Muslims before prayer, a practice resembling those of various baptist sects.

Other etymologies have also been proposed. According to Judah Segal, the term referred to , a Syriac name for Nisibis, a city in Upper Mesopotamia. It has also been related to Hebrew &quot;ṣābā″&quot;, &quot;[heavenly] host&quot;, implying star worshippers.

==Sabians of the Quran==
===In the Quran===

The Quran briefly mentions the Sabians in three places: in  (2:62), in  (5:69), and in  (22:17).

According to , &quot;surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.&quot;

According to , &quot;surely those who believe and those who are Jews and the Sabians and the Christians whoever believes in Allah and the last day and does good– they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve.&quot;

According to , &quot;surely those who believe and those who are Jews and the Sabians and the Christians and the Magians and those who associate (others with Allah)– surely Allah will decide between them on the day of resurrection; surely Allah is a witness over all things.&quot;

The two first verses have generally been interpreted to mean that the Sabians belonged to the People of the Book (, cf. 5:68), just like the Jews, the Christians and –only according to some interpretations– the Zoroastrians (the &#x27;Magians&#x27;, ). However, neither of the three verses give any indication of who the Sabians might have been or what they may have believed. According to François de Blois, the fact that they are classified in the Quran among Abrahamic monotheists renders it unlikely that they were either the polytheists of Harran or the Mandaeans, the latter of whom defined themselves in opposition to the Abrahamic prophetic tradition.
===In later sources===
====Islamic====
In some Sunni &quot;hadiths&quot;, they are described as converts to Islam.

At the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia, the leader of the Mandaeans, Anush bar Danqa, appeared before Muslim authorities showing them a copy of the Ginza Rabba, the Mandaean holy book, and proclaiming the chief Mandaean prophet to be John the Baptist, who is also mentioned in the Quran by the name Yahya ibn Zakariya. Consequently, the Muslim caliphates provided them acknowledgement as the Quranic Sabians and People of the Book.

Other classical Arabic sources include the &quot;Fihrist&quot; of ibn al-Nadim (c. 987), who mentions the &quot;Mogtasilah&quot; (&quot;Mughtasila&quot;, or &quot;self-ablutionists&quot;), a sect of Sabians in southern Mesopotamia who are identified with the Mandaeans or Elcesaites.

Al-Biruni (writing at the beginning of the eleventh century CE) said that the &#x27;&quot;real Sabians&#x27;&quot; were &quot;the remnants of the Jewish tribes who remained in Babylonia when the other tribes left it for Jerusalem in the days of Cyrus and Artaxerxes. According to E. S. Drower (1937) these remaining tribes ... adopted a system mixed up of Magism and Judaism.&#x27;

According to Abu Yusuf Absha al-Qadi, Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun of Baghdad in 830 CE stood with his army at the gates of Harran and questioned the Harranians about what protected religion they belonged to. As they were neither Muslim, Christian, Jewish or Magian, the caliph told them they were non-believers. He said they would have to become Muslims, or adherents of one of the other religions recognized by the Quran by the time he returned from his campaign against the Byzantines or he would kill them. The Harranians consulted with a lawyer, who suggested that they find their answer in the Quran II.59, which said that Sabians were tolerated. It was unknown what the sacred text intended by &quot;Sabian&quot; and so they took the name.

The pagan people of Harran identified themselves with the Sabians in order to fall under the protection of Islam. The Harranians may have identified themselves as Sabians in order to retain their religious beliefs. Multiple medieval sources state that the Harranian Sabians acknowledged Hermes Trismegistus as their prophet. Validation of Hermes as a prophet comes from his identification with Idris (i.e., Enoch) in Quran 19:57 and 21:85. This has often led modern scholars to think of the Harranian Sabians as Hermeticists, though there is in fact no further evidence for this.

Furthermore, this account of the Harranian Sabians does not fit with the existence of earlier records making reference to Sabians in Harran. Usamah ibn Ayd, writing before 770 CE (his year of death), already referred to a city of Sabians in the region where Harran lies. The jurist Abu Hanifa, who died in 767 CE, is recorded to have discussed the legal status of Harranian Sabians with two of his disciples.

====Other====

=====Maimonides=====
The Jewish scholar Maimonides (1135 or 1138–1204) translated the book &quot;The Nabataean Agriculture&quot;, which he considered an accurate record of the beliefs of the Sabians. According to Maimonides, the Sabians believed in idolatrous practices &quot;and other superstitions mentioned in the Nabatean Agriculture&quot;. He provided considerable detail about the pagan Sabians in his &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot; (completed 1186–1190).

=====Baháʼí writings=====
The Sabians are also mentioned in the literature of the Baháʼí Faith. These references are generally brief, describing two groups of Sabians: those &quot;who worship idols in the name of the stars, who believed their religion derived from Seth and Idris&quot; (Harranian Sabians), and others &quot;who believed in the son of Zechariah (John the Baptist) and didn&#x27;t accept the advent of the son of Mary (Jesus Christ)&quot; (Mandaeans). &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá briefly describes Seth as one of the &quot;sons of Adam&quot;. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh in a Tablet identifies Idris with Hermes Trismegistus. He does not, however, specifically name Idris as the prophet of the Sabians. Sometimes referred to as &quot;Sabeans&quot;, this religious group has been mentioned in the Baha’i Faith among the many early religions of the previous dispensations. In the Baha’i Writing, Secrets of Divine Civilization by `Abdu’l-Bahá’ the Sabeans are attributed with possibly being the source of contributing some foundations to the science of logic.

===Modern scholars===

====Daniel Chwolson====
According to Daniel Chwolson&#x27;s &quot;Die Ssabier und der Ssabismus&quot; (1856), Chwolson differentiates between the pagan &quot;pseudo-Sabians&quot; of Harran with the real Sabians which he identifies as the marsh Arabs of Iraq. The Caliph Mamun asked the pagan Harranians to choose a recognized religion, become Muslim or die. They subsequently identified themselves with the Sabians. Chwolson also connected the Elcesaites with the Manicheans and with the Essenes.

====Nicolas Siouffi====
The Syriac Christian, and later French Vice-Consul at Mosul, Nicolas Siouffi in his &quot;Études sur la religion des Soubbas ou Sabéens, leurs dogmes, leurs moeurs&quot; (Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, 1880) claimed to have identified 4,000 Sabians in the Mandaean population. Siouffi&#x27;s work was well received by the Theosophist G. R. S. Mead, but scholars criticized the estimates and study.

====Sir Austen Henry Layard====

Layard mentions in his travel diary meeting a &quot;travelling silversmith&quot; who was &quot;Sabaean or Christian of St. John [the Baptist]&quot;. He estimated around 300 to 400 families to live in Shooshtar and Basra at the time. He also mentioned Sabians (spelled by Layard as Sabaeans) to be under oppression from Turkish and Persian authorities.

====20th-century scholars====
Gavin Maxwell while travelling with explorer Wilfred Thesiger in the southern marshes of Iraq records in his diary that the Sabians were &quot;People of the Book&quot;. The marsh Arabs called them &quot;Subbi&quot;. They had their own script and religious practices. He estimated their number as &quot;perhaps ten thousand&quot;. They dressed in the manner of the Sunnis. The lived only near moving (rather than stagnant) marsh water. In the mid-1950s they were considered the skilled craftsmen in the area who others turned to for metalwork. The work they were principally known for outside Iraq being silverwork.

====21st-century scholars====
Jaakko Hämeen-Anttila (2002, 2006) notes that in the marsh areas of Southern Iraq, there was a continuous tradition of Mandaean religion, and that another pagan, or Sabian, centre in the tenth-century Islamic world centred on Harran. These pagan Sabians are mentioned in the Nabataean corpus of Ibn Wahshiyya.

==Pagan Sabians==
Among the various religious groups which in the 9th and 10th centuries came to be identified with the Sabians mentioned in the Quran, at least two groups were pagans. Moreover, both appear to have engaged in some kind of star worship.

===Sabians of Harran===
By far the most famous of these two are the Sabians of Harran, adherents of a Hellenized Semitic polytheistic religion that had managed to survive during the early Islamic period in the Upper Mesopotamian city of Harran. They were described by Syriac Christian heresiographers as star worshippers. Most of the scholars and courtiers working for the Abbasid and Buyid dynasties in Baghdad during the ninth–eleventh centuries who were known as &#x27;Sabians&#x27; were either members of this Harranian religion or descendants of such members, most notably the Harranian astronomers and mathematicians Thabit ibn Qurra (died 901) and al-Battani (died 929). There has been some speculation on whether these Sabian families in Baghdad, on whom most of our information about the Harranian Sabians indirectly depends, may have practiced a different, more philosophically inspired variant of the original Harranian religion. However, apart from the fact that it contains traces of Babylonian and Hellenistic religion, and that an important place was taken by planets (to whom ritual sacrifices were made), little is known about Harranian Sabianism. They have been variously described by scholars as (neo)-Platonists, Hermeticists, or Gnostics, but there is no firm evidence for any of these identifications.

===Lower Mesopotamian Sabians===
Apart from the Sabians of Harran, there were also various religious groups living in the Mesopotamian Marshes who were called the &#x27;Sabians of the Marshes&#x27; (Arabic: ). Though this name has often been understood as a reference to the Mandaeans, there was in fact at least one other religious group living in the marshlands of Southern Iraq. This group still practiced a polytheistic Babylonian religion or similar, in which Mesopotamian gods had already been venerated in the form of planets and stars since antiquity. According to Ibn al-Nadim, our only source for this specific group counted among the &#x27;Sabians of the Marshes&#x27;, they &quot;follow the doctrines of the ancient Aramaeans [] and venerate the stars&quot;. However, there is also a large corpus of texts by Ibn Wahshiyya (died c. 930), most famously his Nabataean Agriculture, which describes at length the customs and beliefs — many of them going back to Mespotamian models — of Iraqi Sabians living in the Sawād.

==Contemporary Sabians==

Today in Iraq and Iran, the Sabians are those that follow the teachings of John the Baptist. They are Mandaean Sabians. They have been vulnerable to violence since the 2003 invasion of Iraq and numbered fewer than 5,000 in 2007. Before the invasion, the highest concentrations of Mandaeans were in Amarah, Nasiriyah and Basra. Besides these southern regions and Ahvaz in Iran, large numbers of Mandaeans were found in Baghdad, giving them easy access to the Tigris River. Today, they primarily live around Baghdad, where the high priest resides who conducts services and baptisms. Some have moved from Baghdad to Kurdistan where it is safer.

<text>The , usually translated as &quot;Elder&quot;, was one of the highest-ranking government posts under the Tokugawa shogunate of Edo period Japan. The term refers either to individual Elders, or to the Council of Elders as a whole; under the first two &quot;shōguns&quot;, there were only two &quot;Rōjū&quot;. The number was then increased to five, and later reduced to four. The &quot;Rōjū&quot; were usually appointed from the ranks of the &quot;fudai daimyōs&quot; with domains of between 25,000 and 50,000 &quot;koku&quot;.

==Duties==

The &quot;Rōjū&quot; had a number of responsibilities, most clearly delineated in the 1634 ordinance that reorganized the government and created a number of new posts:

:#Relations with the Emperor, the Court, and the Prince-Abbots.
:#Supervision of those &quot;daimyō&quot; who controlled lands worth at least 10,000 &quot;koku&quot;.
:#Managing the forms taken by official documents in official communications.
:#Supervision of the internal affairs of the Shogun&#x27;s domains.
:#Coinage, public works, and enfiefment.
:#Governmental relations and supervision of monk monasteries and shrines.
:#Compilation of maps, charts, and other government records.

The &quot;Rōjū&quot; served not simultaneously, but in rotation, each serving the Shogun for a month at a time, communicating with the Shogun through a chamberlain, called &quot;Soba-yōnin&quot;. However, the &quot;Rōjū&quot; also served as members of the &quot;Hyōjōsho&quot; council, along with the &quot;Ō-Metsuke&quot; and representatives of various &quot;Bugyō&quot; (Commissions or Departments). As part of the &quot;Hyōjōsho&quot;, the &quot;Rōjū&quot; sometimes served a role similar to that of a supreme court, deciding succession disputes and other such disputed matters of state and its vassals.

Under the reign of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (1680–1709) the &quot;Rōjū&quot; lost nearly all their power, as the Shogun began to work more closely with the &quot;Tairō&quot;, Chamberlains, and others, including Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu, who held the power of a &quot;Tairō&quot;, but not the title. The &quot;Rōjū&quot; became little more than messengers, going through the motions of their proper roles as intermediaries between the Shogun and other offices, but not being able to exercise any power to change or decide policy. As Arai Hakuseki, a major Confucian poet and politician of the time wrote, &quot;All the Rōjū did was to pass on his [Yoshiyasu&#x27;s] instructions&quot; (Sansom 141). Even after Tsunayoshi&#x27;s death, the &quot;Rōjū&quot; did not regain their former power. They continued to exist, however, as a government post and a council with, officially if not in fact, all the powers and responsibilities they originally held, through the Edo period.

==List of &quot;Rōjū&quot;==
&quot;Each office-holder is listed once. Some may have served under multiple &quot;shōguns&quot;, and as a result of multiple terms, the list may not fully accurate reflect the order in which the office was held. For example, Hotta Masayoshi served in 1857–58 after Abe Masahiro (1843–57), but also served earlier, and is listed earlier; he is not also listed after Abe.&quot;

<doc id="324642" wikidata="Q1125638" url="?curid=324642" title="General Confederation of Labour (France)">
<text>The General Confederation of Labour (, CGT) is a national trade union center, founded in 1895 in the city of Limoges. It is the first of the five major French confederations of trade unions.

It is the largest in terms of votes in the Labour Court elections (34.0% in the 2008 election), and second largest in terms of membership numbers.

Its membership decreased to 650,000 members in 1995–96 (it had more than doubled when François Mitterrand was elected president in 1981), before increasing today to between 700,000 and 720,000 members, slightly fewer than the Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail (CFDT).

According to the historian M. Dreyfus, the direction of the CGT is slowly evolving, since the 1990s, during which it cut all organic links with the French Communist Party (PCF), in favour of a more moderate stance. The CGT is concentrating its attention, in particular since the 1995 general strikes, to trade-unionism in the private sector.

==History==

The CGT was founded in 1895 in Limoges from the merger of the &quot;Fédération des bourses du travail&quot; (Federation of Labour Councils) and the &quot;Fédération nationale des syndicats&quot; (National Federation of Trade Unions). Auguste Keufer was amongst the founders and became the first treasurer.

At the end of Henri Krasucki&#x27;s term (1982–1992), he began to distance himself from the French Communist Party (PCF). His successor, Louis Viannet, did the same, going as far as resigning from the political bureau of the party.

CGT General Secretary Phillipe Martinez announced that the union will support the week of climate action beginning on 20 September 2019.

In 2023, the CGT was involved in the interunion social movement against pension reform which organized strikes and protests in 300 towns across France, and wrote to Emmanuel Macron requesting negotiations, then, having not been received, mediation and a suspension of the &lt;bdi&gt;2023 French pension reform bill&lt;/bdi&gt;.

On 18 June 2024, the CGT called for a vote for the New Popular Front (NFP) in the 2024 French legislative elections. with the CGT General Secretary Sophie Binet also personally endorsing the NFP. , a senior CGT member and General Secretary of the Federal Union of State Trade Unions, was nominated by the NFP for Paris&#x27;s 15th constituency. The decision to endorse the NFP presented a turning point, since while the CGT has regularly called for a vote against the far right, in recent decades it has not called for people to vote for any specific party or bloc, due in part to the CGT&#x27;s Amiens Charter—which recognizes the independence of trade unions from political parties.

==Africa==

In 1937 CGT began organizing workers in French West Africa. The union&#x27;s functioning was interrupted by its banning by the Vichy regime, but in 1943-1948 a process of reconstruction took place. The main centers of activity were Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo and the French Soudan. CGT had an upper hand in the Muslim regions in comparison to the rival French Confederation of Christian Workers, who depended on the presence of Catholic communities for its recruitment. CGT emerged as the major trade union force amongst the 100 000 strong organized labour force in Senegal and Mauritania after the Second World War.

Within the CGT branches in the region, there was however a growing wish for independence. A leader of CGT in French West Africa, Bassirou Guèye, promoted this idea. At a meeting of the Territorial Union of Trade Unions in Senegal and Mauritania, held in Dakar 11 November – 12 November 1955, the majority of delegates voted for separation from the French CGT. A conference was held in Saint-Louis on 14 January – 15 January 1956 which formed the Confédération générale des travailleurs africains (CGTA), separating the parts of the West African CGT organizations from the French CGT. At the conference 50 out of 67 delegates had voted for separation.

In Togo, CGT had 45,100 members in 1948 (65% of organized labour). By 1952 the number had decreased to 34,000 (46% of organized labour).

CGT formed a branch in Madagascar in 1936.

<text>The General Confederation of Labor - Workers&#x27; Force (, or simply , FO), is one of the five major union confederations in France. In terms of following, it is the third behind the CGT and the CFDT.

Force Ouvrière was founded in 1948 by former members of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) who denounced the dominance of the French Communist Party over that federation. 

FO is a member of the European Trade Union Confederation. Its leader is Frédéric Souillot, since June 2022.

== History ==
After World War II, members of the French Communist Party attained considerable influence within the CGT, controlling 21 of its 30 federations.
The communists, at the time in the french governement, used their positions inside the CGT to stop strikes in the name of the &quot;battle for national production&quot;. Maurice Thorez, the leader of the PCF, make a telling declaration : &quot;Strike is the tool of the capitalist trusts&quot;.
For quite a number of union members, this attitude is a betrayal of the 1906 &quot;Charte d&#x27;Amiens&quot;, a text who uphold as his main principle the total independance of the unions from the state and any political party.
Senior figures such as Robert Bothereau and the former secretary general, Léon Jouhaux, just coming back from a concentration camp, opposed this development and gathered around the paper &quot;Résistance Ouvrière&quot;, renamed the 20 december 1945 &quot;Force ouvrière&quot;.

In May 1947, the Communist ministers were excluded from the government led by Paul Ramadier, a Socialist, because they were incapable to quell the ultimately victorious strike in the biggest factory in France, the Renault car plant in Boulogne-Billancourt. Tensions rose again when Moscow ask the PCF to boycott the Marshall Plan in September. 
The CGT split in three in November 1947 : Jouhaux and four confederal general secretary leaves officially the confederation and create the CGT-FO the 12 April 1948. The Federation for National Education (FEN) stayed neutral and independant from the two confederations. 

Along with a majority of autonomous syndicalist who believe deeply in the Amiens Charter, the ranks and files of the confederation were also composed of a reformist right-wing linked with the SFIO, and a revolutionary left-wing with anarcho-syndicalist like Hébert and revolutionary syndicalists like Monatte.

In February 1958 the African branches of FO became an independent organization, &quot;Confédération Africaine des Syndicats Libres-FO&quot;.

In 1963, when André Bergeron became leader of the Confederation, the links between FO and the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) became distended. Indeed, if Bergeron was an SFIO member for a short period, he was also a hardcore reformist who believed firmly in &quot;social agreement&quot; with the employers and the De Gaulle right-wing government. He helped create a social security offices with them, that FO presided.

In 1968, FO was one of the Grenelle agreements signatory. Fearing an integration of the unions into the state, they were the only confederation to call for a &quot;No&quot; vote in the 1969 referendum, which lead to the defeat and the final resignation of De Gaulle from power.

The link of the reformists, inside the confederation, with the socialist movement was completely broke in 1972 with the creation of the Socialist Party, because the main syndicalist core of this party was coming from Christian syndicalism, either the CFTC or the secular CFDT. After François Mitterrand&#x27;s election, FO presented like the only independent trade-union confederation.

In 1989, Marc Blondel was elected leader of FO, against the will of Bergeron. He wanted to preserve the independence of the confederation. Supported by the radical minority, he adopted a more combative attitude. In this, he participated in the 1995 social conflict against Alain Juppé&#x27;s plans for welfare reform, and improved relations with the CGT. In consequence, FO lost the precedence of social security offices for the benefit of the Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail.

In 2003, Blondel called for a general strike against the plan of pensions reforms. Then, he let his function to Jean-Claude Mailly. FO participated in the 2006 campaign against the &quot;Contrat première embauche&quot;. In April 2018, Pascal Pavageau, which presents himself as being part of the historical and traditional Workers&#x27; Force trend (independence of trade unions towards the political parties) became the new secretary general.

==CIA involvement==
The group&#x27;s ties with the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were leaked in 1967 by Thomas Braden, a former director of covert operations for the agency. In his expose on &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, Braden wrote of the CGT strike: &quot;Into this crisis stepped [Jay] Lovestone and his assistant, Irving Brown. With funds from Dubinsky&#x27;s union, they organized Force Ouvrière, a non-Communist union. When they ran out of money, they appealed to the CIA. Thus began the secret subsidy of free trade-unions which soon spread to Italy. Without that subsidy, postwar history might have gone very differently.&quot; American influence was never total, and there were disputes between FO leadership and the American representatives (for example, over French colonialism).
The split would have, anyway, never happened without the prostitution of the CGT, by the communists inside it, to the short term interests of the French Communist Party.

==Professional elections==

<text>The French Confederation of Christian Workers (; CFTC) is one of the five major French confederation of trade unions, belonging to the social Christian tradition.

It was founded in 1919 as the Trade Union of Employees of Industry and Commerce under the inspiration of Exupérien Mas with the goal of safeguarding the material as well as the spiritual interests of its members. In 1964, the union split, a majority founding the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT), a non-confessional trade-union.

The CFTC is a member of the International Trade Union Confederation and the European Trade Union Confederation. Its leader is Jacques Voisin.

==Professional elections==

The CFTC won 8.69% of the vote in the employee&#x27;s college during the 2008 professional elections. This result, however, is below the CFTC&#x27;s 9.65% result in 2002, its best showing to date. In 2021 the CFTC won 11% of the vote.

<text>Charles Henry Mosley III (December 26, 1959 – November 9, 2017) was an American musician, singer and songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist for the rock band Faith No More from 1984 to 1988. He contributed to the band&#x27;s early sound, combining elements of funk, punk, and rap-rock, and appeared on their first two albums, &quot;We Care a Lot (1985)&quot; and &quot;Introduce Yourself (1987)&quot;. After leaving Faith No More, Mosley performed with bands like Bad Brains and Cement. He continued to influence the alternative music scene until his death in 2017.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mosley was born in Hollywood, California, but raised in South Central Los Angeles and Venice, California, adopted at a very early age. Coincidentally, both his biological parents and adoptive parents had the same ethnic backgrounds. In a 2013 interview, Mosley said his adoptive parents &quot;met at some kind of socialist/communist get-together in the &#x27;50s. They were interracial—my mom was Jewish and my dad was black and Native American. So that was something controversial in itself. My dad had a daughter and my mom had two daughters, and all they were missing was a boy, so they went out and adopted one, and it was me.&quot;

===Faith No More years===
Mosley first met Billy Gould in 1977, at a The Zeros, Johnny Navotnee and Bags show. He then went on to play keyboards in Gould&#x27;s first band The Animated in 1979. In 1984, he joined Haircuts That Kill, a post-punk band from the San Francisco area. He left the band to join Faith No More in 1985 replacing, among others, Courtney Love, as lead singer.

By 1987, Faith No More were gaining mainstream traction, signing with major label Slash Records (Warner Music Group) and touring with prominent acts such as Red Hot Chili Peppers. According to Billy Gould, he and other band members began to consider firing Mosley during a 1988 tour of Europe when his behaviour became increasingly erratic. Incidents include Mosley allegedly punching Gould on stage and one of Mosley&#x27;s roadies getting into a fist fight with guitarist Jim Martin.

Gould stated: &quot;By the time that happened, Chuck was already kind of out of it for me. I guess Jim and the roadie had been drinking and they got in a fight. It came a point where Jim was our guitar player, and he broke his hand fighting the guy. It&#x27;s the first night of our European tour, and somebody had to go—it obviously wasn&#x27;t going to be our guitar player. Chuck took it very personally, sticking up for this roadie.&quot;

Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe. Gould said: &quot;There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal, and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs. It was just so far off the mark. The upshot was that I got up, walked out and quit the band. I just said: &#x27;I&#x27;m done—I can&#x27;t take this any longer. It&#x27;s just so ridiculous&#x27;. The same day, I talked to Bordin, and he said: &#x27;Well, I still want to play with you&#x27;. Roddy Bottum did the same thing. It was another one of these &#x27;firing somebody without firing them&#x27; scenarios.&quot;

====Subsequent legal battles====
Mosley sued his bandmates in 1989, claiming a partnership interest in Faith No More&#x27;s financial assets. They eventually settled, and Mosley agreed to give up his rights to most of the band&#x27;s works, most of its assets, and its name. At the time of his death, there was an ongoing legal battle between Manifesto Records and Faith No More regarding the right to release the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;. Mosley stated in January 2016, &quot;I am distraught that I am being sued by my former band members and even more distraught if I did something that would negatively impact my future relationship with the band, which I value. I consider certain members of Faith No More as my &#x27;family.&#x27; I would never have signed the Manifesto contract if I fully appreciated the dissention&quot; [sic]&quot; it would cause or how the band would object.&quot;

===Post-Faith No More===

In 1990, Mosley began a stint as lead singer in the revered hardcore punk band Bad Brains. He performed at nearly 60 shows in the United States and Europe, then left the band in January 1992.

Mosley went on to form a new band, Cement in late 1992. They released two albums: &quot;Cement&quot; and &quot;Man with the Action Hair&quot;. Both albums were distributed by Dutch East India Trading (United States) and Rough Trade (Europe). The band toured both locations promoting their music. During the first week of what was to be a year-long tour for &quot;Man with the Action Hair&quot;, the band&#x27;s driver fell asleep at the wheel, causing a major accident. Mosley spent a year recovering from a broken back, the tour was canceled, and the band was subsequently shelved.

Mosley moved to Cleveland, Ohio in March 1996, where he spent several years writing and compiling material while raising his two daughters and working as a chef in various restaurants.

In 2009, Mosley announced an album would be released under the name of &quot;V.U.A. (Vanduls Ugenst Allliderasy)&quot;. The band name was extended to include Mosley&#x27;s name. &quot;Will Rap Over Hard Rock for Food&quot; was released on August 11, 2009 by Reversed Image Unlimited. Guest appearances on the LP include Jonathan Davis (Korn), John 5 (Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie), Michael Cartellone (Lynyrd Skynyrd), and Roddy Bottum (Imperial Teen, Faith No More), and Reversed Image labelmate Leah Lou.

On April 14, 2010, Mosley made an appearance on stage at a Faith No More concert in San Francisco, the first time since 1988 that he performed with the band. Mosley performed the songs &quot;As the Worm Turns&quot;, &quot;Death March&quot;, &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;, and &quot;Mark Bowen&quot; on his own with the band, and was joined by frontman Mike Patton during the final encore, performing a duet of &quot;Introduce Yourself&quot;.

On November 17, 2012, Mosley re-released his album &quot;Will Rap Over Hard Rock for Food&quot; while working on an autobiography.

In 2014, he was interviewed extensively for the book &quot;Punk! Hardcore! Reggae! PMA! Bad Brains!&quot; by author Greg Prato, where he recounted his time as singer of the band.

In late 2014, he publicly revealed that he was broke and that he and his family were on the verge of eviction: &quot;The shocking truth is, that I&#x27;m not rich. We struggle every day, just like most everybody, more, right now, worse than ever, in a long time. I&#x27;m ashamed for being in this condition. Our band, VUA, has had to put off trying to tour or play any shows. We&#x27;re starting to record new stuff, but even that is suffering at the hands of my family&#x27;s financial situation.&quot;

In May 2015 he again made another appearance at a Faith No More concert, performing the track &quot;Mark Bowen&quot; at their Detroit show.

In fall 2015, Mosley published a non-fiction essay in an anthology titled &quot;A Matter of Words&quot;, about the writing and recording of the Faith No More track &quot;Mark Bowen&quot;.

In mid-2016, Mosley toured the U.S. doing an &quot;unplugged&quot; show, and a reissue of the &quot;We Care a Lot&quot; album, with extra tracks. At a performance on July 20 that same year, Bottum joined Mosley on stage for a rendition of an Imperial Teen tune. A month later, Mosley performed two concerts with Faith No More, billed as Chuck Mosley and Friends, which Mosley opened with an acoustic set on August 18 in San Francisco and on August 20 in Los Angeles. This was the last time Mosley performed on stage with Faith No More, and it was also the last set of shows Faith No More did before entering a still-ongoing hiatus.

Mosley appeared as the vocalist on &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Make the Six&quot;, the fourth album from the Cleveland band Indoria. The album, released August 30, 2016, featured an expanded role for Mosley, who had joined the band late during the recording of their previous release.

In 2017 Mosley joined Primitive Race, the industrial collective created by Chris Kniker featuring guitarist Mark Gemini Thwaite (Peter Murphy, Tricky, The Mission, Gary Numan), Erie Loch (LUXT, Blownload, Exageist), and drummer Dale Crover of Melvins. The lineup released sophomore album &quot;Soul Pretender&quot; with Metropolis Records on November 3, 2017, to positive reviews, just a week before Mosley&#x27;s passing.

In July 2017, Mosley played a fictional version of himself in the film &quot;Like an Open Heart It Shines&quot;, written and directed by David Collupy.

In early 2018, it was announced that Mosley will be the subject of a forthcoming documentary &quot;Thanks. And Sorry: The Chuck Mosley Movie&quot;, directed by his guitarist Drew Fortier and produced by bandmate/manager Douglas Esper, who has written a memoir about their time together on the road and in the studio, titled &quot;Reintroducing Chuck Mosley&quot;.

==Death==
On the evening of November 9, 2017, Mosley, 57, was found dead by his partner Pip Logan and their friend on the living room floor of their Cleveland home. Drug paraphernalia was discovered at the scene, with police suspecting a heroin overdose as the cause of death. His family released a statement that read:

After a long period of sobriety, Charles Henry Mosley III lost his life, on November 9th, 2017, due to the disease of addiction. We&#x27;re sharing the manner in which he passed, in the hopes that it might serve as a warning or wake up call or beacon to anyone else struggling to fight for sobriety. He is survived by long-term partner Pip Logan, two daughters, Erica and Sophie and his grandson Wolfgang Logan Mosley. The family will be accepting donations for funeral expenses. Details to follow when arranged. 

Faith No More released the following statement on its Facebook page:

It&#x27;s with a heavy, heavy heart we acknowledge the passing of our friend and bandmate, Chuck Mosley. He was a reckless and caterwauling force of energy who delivered with conviction and helped set us on a track of uniqueness and originality that would not have developed the way it had had he not been a part. How fortunate we are to have been able to perform with him last year in a reunion style when we re-released our very first record. His enthusiasm, his sense of humor, his style and his bravado will be missed by so many. We were a family, an odd and dysfunctional family, and we&#x27;ll be forever grateful for the time we shared with Chuck. 

==Legacy and influences==
Some of Mosley&#x27;s influences included David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Roxy Music, Killing Joke, Motown, Michael Jackson and Black Sabbath. His rock/rap singing style has been cited as an influence by successful rap rock and nu metal groups such as Korn, Disturbed, and Limp Bizkit. Regarding the rap rock genre, Mosley stated in 2017 &quot;I would say I am the originator. Some will argue and say the Chili Peppers, and I will say &#x27;No, that was funk&#x27;. Some will say the Beastie Boys, and I&#x27;ll say &#x27;No, they were playing punk rock, then they started playing the beats, then they started playing the rock&#x27;.&quot;

The original recording of Faith No More&#x27;s &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;, for which he performed the vocals, has been featured as the theme song for the show &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; as well as in the movies &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; and &quot;Bio-Dome&quot;, and it has been used in Major League Baseball games to introduce relief pitchers due to the refrain &quot;it&#x27;s a dirty job, but someone&#x27;s gotta do it.&quot;

<doc id="324651" wikidata="Q12702" url="?curid=324651" title="Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood">
<text>Edgar Algernon Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, (14 September 1864 – 24 November 1958), known as Lord Robert Cecil from 1868 to 1923, was a British lawyer, politician and diplomat. He was one of the architects of the League of Nations and a defender of it, whose service to the organisation saw him awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1937.

==Early life and legal career==
Cecil was born at Cavendish Square, London, the sixth child and third son of Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, three times prime minister, and Georgina, daughter of Sir Edward Hall Alderson. He was the brother of James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury, Lord William Cecil, Lord Edward Cecil and Lord Quickswood and the cousin of Arthur Balfour, with whom he had common grandparents: James Brownlow William Gascoyne-Cecil and Frances Mary Gascoyne (1802–1839), the only daughter and heiress of Bamber Gascoyne (1757–1824) of Childwall, Liverpool, Lancashire, member of Parliament for Liverpool (1780–96). Cecil was educated at home until he was thirteen and then spent four years at Eton College. He claimed in his autobiography to have enjoyed his home education most. He studied law at University College, Oxford, where he became a well-known debater. His first job was as private secretary to his father, when commencing in office as prime minister from 1886 to 1888. In 1887, he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple. He was fond of saying that his marriage to Lady Eleanor Lambton, daughter of George Lambton, 2nd Earl of Durham on 22 January 1889, was the cleverest thing he had ever done.
From 1887 to 1906, Cecil practised civil law, including work in Chancery and parliamentary practice. On 15 June 1899, he was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. After the outbreak of the Second Boer War, he enrolled as a recruit in the Inns of Court Rifles in February 1900, but he never saw active service. He also collaborated in writing a book, entitled &quot;Principles of Commercial Law&quot;. In 1910 he was appointed a member of the General Council of the Bar, and a Bencher of the Inner Temple. He was already a Justice of the Peace when he was raised the following year as Chairman of the Hertfordshire Quarter Sessions.

==Unionist free trader==
Cecil was a convinced believer in free trade, opposing Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s agitation for Tariff Reform, denouncing it as &quot;a rather sordid attempt to ally Imperialism with State assistance for the rich&quot;. In February 1905, he compiled for party leader Arthur Balfour a memorandum on &#x27;The Attack on Unionist Free Trade Seats&#x27; in which he quoted a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; by a member of the Tariff Reform League that stated it would oppose free trade candidates, whether Unionist or Liberal. Cecil argued that he had identified at least 25 seats in which such attacks had taken place. At the 1906 general election, Cecil was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament representing Marylebone East.

In January 1908, Cecil wrote to fellow Unionist free trader Arthur Elliot: &quot;To me, the greatest necessity of all is to preserve, if possible, a foothold for Free Trade within the Unionist party. For, if not, I and others who think like me, will be driven to imperil either free trade or other causes such as religious education, the House of Lords, and even the Union, which seem to us of equal importance&quot;. In March 1910 Cecil and his brother Lord Hugh, unsuccessfully appealed to Chamberlain that he should postpone advocating food taxes at the next election in order to concentrate on opposing Irish Home Rule.

He did not contest the Marylebone seat in either general election in 1910 as a result of the tariff reform controversy. Instead he unsuccessfully contested Blackburn in the January election and Wisbech in the December election. In 1911, he won a by-election in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, as an Independent Conservative and served as its MP until 1923.

==Minister during First World War==
During World War I, Cecil worked for the Red Cross. He was made Vicar-General to the Archbishop of York on account of his deep religious convictions and commitment to pacifism. Following the formation of the 1915 coalition government, he became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on 30 May 1915; on 16 June he was sworn of the Privy Council, and was promoted to Assistant Secretary in 1918–19. He served in this post until 10 January 1919, additionally serving in the cabinet as Minister of Blockade between 23 February 1916 and 18 July 1918. He was responsible for devising procedures to bring economic and commercial pressure against the enemy forcing them to choose between feeding their occupying military forces or their civilian population. After the war, in 1919, he was made an Honorary Fellow, and granted his MA of University College, Oxford, as well as an Honorary Doctorate of Civil Law, apt for a university chancellor which he by then was.

==Formation of League of Nations==
In September 1916, he wrote and circulated a &quot;Memorandum on Proposals for Diminishing the Occasion of Future Wars&quot; in the Cabinet. Cecil noted the suffering and destruction of the war, along with the threat to European civilisation and the likelihood of postwar disputes. He urged an alternative to war as a means of settling international disputes and claimed that neither the destruction of German militarism nor a postwar settlement based on self-determination would guarantee peace. Cecil rejected compulsory arbitration but claimed a regular conference system would be unobjectionable. Peaceful procedures for settling disputes should be compulsory before there was any outbreak of fighting. Sanctions, including blockade, would be necessary to force countries to submit to peaceful procedures. If overwhelming naval and financial power could be combined in a peace system, &quot;no modern State could ultimately resist its pressure&quot;. He hoped that America might be willing to &quot;join in organized economic action to preserve peace&quot;. He later said that it was the &quot;first document from which sprang British official advocacy of the League of Nations&quot;.

In May 1917 Cecil circulated his &quot;Proposals for Maintenance of Future Peace&quot; in which the signatories would agree to keep the postwar territorial settlement for five years, followed by a conference to consider and, if necessary, to implement necessary or desirable territorial changes. Countries would also agree to submit their international disputes to a conference and they would be forbidden to act until the conference had made a decision. However, states would be allowed to act unilaterally if, after three months, the conference had failed to make a decision. All decisions made by conferences would be enforced by all the signatories, &quot;if necessary by force of arms&quot;. If a country resorted to war without submitting the dispute to a conference, the other countries would combine to enforce a commercial and financial blockade. Cecil had originally included proposals for disarmament but these were deleted from the final draft after a diplomat, Sir Eyre Crowe, submitted them to a &quot;devastating critique&quot; that persuaded Cecil they were impractical.

In November 1917, Cecil requested from Balfour the creation of a committee to consider the proposals for a League of Nations. Balfour granted it and in January 1918, a committee, chaired by Lord Phillimore, was established. In May 1918, with the Cabinet&#x27;s permission, Cecil forwarded the Phillimore Report to the American President Woodrow Wilson and his advisor Colonel House.

In October 1918, Cecil circulated a paper on League proposals to the Cabinet after their request for advice. He argued that &quot;no very elaborate machinery&quot; would be required as the proposals rejected any form of international government, but the League would be limited to a treaty binding the signatories never to go to war until a conference had been called. If a country went to war unilaterally, the signatories would use all the power at their command, economic and military, to defeat the aggressor. Cecil viewed the three months&#x27; delay before countries resorted to war as the principal role of the League as that would give public opinion time to exert its peaceful influence. The Cabinet received the paper &quot;respectfully rather than cordially&quot; and made no decision upon it. Cecil used the paper as the basis for a speech on the subject of the League delivered at his inauguration as Chancellor of the University of Birmingham on 12 November. On 22 November Cecil resigned from the government due to his opposition to Welsh disestablishment. He wrote to Gilbert Murray afterwards, saying that he hoped to do more for the establishment of a League of Nations outside the government than within it.

In late November 1918, Cecil was appointed the head of the League of Nations section of the Foreign Office. A. E. Zimmern had written a memorandum elaborating the functions of the League and Cecil selected it as a base to work from. He ordered that a summary of the actual organisation involved in implementing its proposals be written. On 14 December, he was presented with the &quot;Brief Conspectus of League of Nations Organization&quot;, which would later be called the &quot;Cecil Plan&quot; at the Paris Peace Conference. The Plan included regular conferences between the signatories, which would be &quot;the pivot of the League&quot; and that they would have to be unanimous. Annual conferences of prime ministers and foreign secretaries would be complemented by quadrennial meetings between the signatories. A great power could summon a conference, with all members being able to do so if there was a danger of war. The great powers would control the League, with the smaller powers exercising little considerable influence. On 17 December, Cecil submitted the &quot;Cecil Plan&quot; to the Cabinet. The Cabinet discussed the idea of the League on 24 December, with Cecil being the leading pro-League speaker.

The Paris Peace Conference included a League of Nations Commission, which was responsible for creating a scheme for a League, including the drafting of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Cecil viewed Wilson&#x27;s draft for the League and in his diary, he wrote that it was &quot;a very bad document, badly expressed, badly arranged, and very incomplete&quot;. On 27 January Cecil and American legal expert David Hunter Miller spent four hours revising Wilson&#x27;s proposals in what became known as the Cecil-Miller draft. It included granting more powers in the League to the great powers, granting the Dominions their own seats, a revision of Wilson&#x27;s arbitration proposals and the inclusion of a permanent international court. In further negotiations, Cecil was successful in retaining important parts of the British draft. When Wilson tried to amend it, House warned him against alienating Cecil, as he &quot;was the only man connected with the British Government who really had the League of Nations at heart&quot;. Cecil was disappointed in Lloyd George&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm for the League and repeatedly threatened resignation because of some of Lloyd George&#x27;s tactics.

Cecil was greatly concerned at Republican opposition to the League and sought to concede some of Wilson&#x27;s demands to secure American acceptance of the League. That included protecting the Monroe Doctrine in the Covenant. On 21 April, the British Empire delegation met Cecil, who assured them that Dominion criticism of the draft Covenant had been considered and that the new draft avoided &quot;the impression that a super State was being created&quot;. The Canadians objected that while the risk of Canada being invaded was unlikely, the risks to France or the Balkans were much more likely but had not been taken into consideration. Furthermore, the League loaded Canada with more liabilities than it had by being a member of the Empire. Cecil argued that the Council of the League would determine when that obligation would be fulfilled and that its requirement for decisions to be unanimous allowed a Canadian delegate to object, which would cause the end of the matter. George Egerton, in his history of the creation of the League, claimed that Cecil &quot;more than anyone else, deserved credit for the successful outcome of the second phase of the work of the League of Nations Commission&quot;.

After the Treaty of Versailles was first presented to Germany, Cecil argued strongly that it should be made less harsh on Germany and that Germany should be allowed to join the League. Cecil left Paris on 9 June, his hopes of a revision of the treaty disappointed.

==League of Nations Union==

Upon returning to Britain, Cecil eagerly planned the activities of the League of Nations Union. Cecil&#x27;s public life from then on was almost totally devoted to the League; he was its president of the Union from 1923 to 1945. He chaired a reconstruction committee of the Union in July 1919, his primary aim being to ensure that the Union built a powerful pro-League lobby in Britain to make sure that the government put the League at the centre of its foreign policy. Cecil also sought to broaden the membership of the Union, which had largely consisted of Asquithian Liberals, by soliciting the support of Conservatives and Labour.

Cecil was an Esperantist, and, in 1921, he proposed that the League of Nations adopt Esperanto as solution to the language problem.

From 1920 to 1922, he represented the Union of South Africa in the League Assembly. In 1923, he made a five-week tour of the United States, explaining the League to American audiences. He helped draft the League&#x27;s 1923 Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance, which made war of aggression illegal. And one did take place all League members would send troops to defend the victim. His own government opposed the plan and it was never adopted.

He believed that &quot;the war ha[d] shattered the prestige of the European governing classes&quot; and that their disappearance had created a vacuum that needed to be filled if disaster was to be averted. The primary solution was the construction of a European order on the basis of Christian morality, with a machinery of legal conciliation by which &quot;Junkerism and Chauvinism&quot; would be destroyed. The Treaty of Versailles had failed to create that.

His belief in free trade and the League were part of his Cobdenite vision of a world where trade, self-sacrifice and international cooperation went together, along with international adjudication and mutual guarantees of peace. The League was not just a solution to war but also guaranteed that civilisation would be preserved within each member state, including in Britain where &quot;the League point of view [ran] through all politics - Ireland, Industry, even Economy...[involving] a new way of looking at things political - or rather a reversion&quot; to Victorian morality.
===Possible party realignment===
Cecil regarded &quot;class war, whether the class attacked be landowners or Labour, [as] the most insidious form of national disintegration&quot;. From 1920, Cecil wanted to bring down Lloyd George and his coalition government by forming a progressive alliance between anti-coalition and anti-socialist forces. He had been an enemy of Lloyd George for longer than any other major politician.

He wanted to create an anti-socialist centre party led by former Foreign Secretary Viscount Grey, regarding him as the embodiment of &quot;justice&quot; which had been Britain&#x27;s &quot;greatest National asset...in foreign affairs... for the last two generations&quot;. The party would not be anti-working class and would include &quot;the best of the Liberal and Labour people&quot; and &quot;some of the old landowning Tories&quot;. He supported Asquith in the Paisley by-election of February 1920 and wanted an electoral agreement between Labour and pro-League candidates. In mid-July 1920, Cecil was still keen for a realignment under Grey, who was keener on the League of Nations than Asquith, whom Cecil thought still influential in the country but no longer a leader.

With his brother Hugh Cecil, he resigned the Conservative whip in February 1921. In 1921 Cecil abandoned his attempt to form a centre party but still wanted Grey to return to active politics. Talks between Grey and Cecil began in June 1921. A wider meeting (Cecil, Asquith, Grey and leading Asquithian Liberals Lord Crewe, Runciman and Sir Donald Maclean) was held on 5 July 1921. Cecil wanted a genuine coalition, rather than a &quot;de facto&quot; Liberal government, with Grey, rather than Asquith, as prime minister and a formal manifesto by himself and Grey that Asquith and Crewe would then endorse as the official Liberal leaders. Another Conservative, Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, later joined in the talks, and his views were similar to Cecil&#x27;s, but Maclean, Runciman and Crewe were hostile. In July Cecil wrote a public letter to his constituency association attacking the coalition government.

Grey himself was not keen, and his failing eyesight would have been a major handicap to his becoming prime minister. He made, however, a move by speaking in his former constituency in October 1921, to little effect. After Grey&#x27;s speech, Cecil published a second letter in which he announced he would co-operate with a Grey government. In November, when the Irish situation looked likely to cause the fall of the coalition, Cecil wrote to the King urging him to appoint Grey as prime minister.

In April 1922, in another constituency letter, he distanced himself from other anti-coalition Conservatives by insisting on the importance of not being reactionary, and in May, he claimed that the dominant force within the Conservatives was a group of men who only cared for &quot;the preservation of its property&quot;. He again announced his willingness to serve under Grey in a government based on industrial cooperation and support for the League. However Cecil became disillusioned with the Liberals&#x27; opposition to reconstructing the party system and so he declined an invitation to join the Liberals so long as Asquith remained leader, rather than Grey. With the fall of the Lloyd George coalition in October and the appointment of Bonar Law as Conservative prime minister, Cecil pledged to support the new government though he was not offered office.

===Traditional Tory in a modernizing world===
In Baldwin&#x27;s Conservative administrations of 1923 to 1924 and 1924 to 1927, he was the minister responsible, under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Secretary, for British activities in League affairs. On 28 May 1923, Cecil returned to the cabinet as Lord Privy Seal, a position held by several members of his family.

Cecil wrote to Baldwin on 29 October 1923, offering his support on tariff reform if Baldwin would adopt a vigorous pro-League policy in return. He stated that Britain&#x27;s economic problems could not be solved by tariffs, rather by solving the collapse of European credit, war debts and &quot;international suspicion&quot; and withdrawing support from all international organisations except the League. Because of his disagreement with the Conservatives&#x27; policy of tariffs, Cecil did not stand in the general election of December 1923. After the Conservatives lost their majority, he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, of East Grinstead in the County of Sussex, on 28 December 1923. He remained Lord Privy Seal until 22 February 1924, When Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s minority Labour government took office, MacDonald apologised to Cecil for not retaining him as the government&#x27;s League minister. But at the period Chelwood was rewarded by being asked to be Rector of Aberdeen University, when they granted him an Honorary Doctorate of Law.

The Conservatives returned to power at the October 1924 general election and Cecil was asked by Stanley Baldwin to be Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He led the British delegation to the Opium Conference at Geneva in 1925. During a naval conference of 1927 in Geneva, negotiations broke down after the United States refused to agree that Britain needed a minimum of seventy cruisers for adequate defence of the British Empire, its trade and communications. Cutting the number of British cruisers from seventy to fifty was proposed by the US in return for concessions over their size and the calibre of their guns. Cecil, a member of the British delegation, resigned from the cabinet because the British government let the conference break down, rather than reduce the number of Royal Navy cruisers.

Cecil was very concerned about the increasing social problems and public dangers associated with the growth in popularity of the motor car. In 1929, Cecil accepted the post of president of the newly formed Pedestrians Association who were to campaign successfully to introduce many new measures to benefit pedestrians.

Although an official delegate to the League as late as 1932, Cecil worked independently to mobilise public opinion in support of the League. He was joint founder and president, with Pierre Cot, a French jurist, of the International Peace Campaign, known in France as &quot;Rassemblement universel pour la paix&quot;. Among his publications during this period were &quot;The Way of Peace&quot; (1928), a collection of lectures on the &quot;League; A Great Experiment&quot; (1941), a personalised account of his relationship to the League of Nations; and &quot;All the Way&quot; (1949), a more complete autobiography.

The Japanese invasion of Manchuria, which began in 1931, was a flagrant breach of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The World Disarmament Conference began in February 1932, and disarmament meant that Britain was powerless to stop Japanese aggression. Baldwin told Thomas Jones on 27 February, &quot;The very people like Bob Cecil who have made us disarm, and quite right too, are now urging us forward to take action. But where will action take us?... If you enforce an economic boycott you will have war declared by Japan and she will seize Singapore and Hong Kong and we cannot, as we are placed, stop her&quot;.

Cecil wrote to Baldwin in July that he found himself &quot;more and more out of sympathy with modern Conservatism&quot; and he considered the government&#x27;s disarmament proposals made at Geneva &quot;quite inadequate&quot;. In March 1933, he complained to Baldwin that the technical advisers, especially British ones, had sabotaged the prospect of abolishing aircraft and of bombing, particularly from those who wanted to retain it for areas such as the North-West frontier of India.

Cecil&#x27;s experience at the Geneva Disarmament Conference convinced him that the League was being jeopardised by &quot;Hankeyism&quot;, the idea that the balance of power and national interests of countries were the only basis of international relations, which was named after the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence (1912-1938) Sir Maurice Hankey. He admired Anthony Eden, Lord Halifax and Baldwin but regarded MacDonald as an enemy of the League and disliked Lord Londonderry and Lord Hailsham and criticised Sir John Simon as &quot;the worst Foreign Secretary since Derby in 1876&quot;.

===Cecil and appeasement===
After Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933, Cecil was still hopeful of progress in disarmament. He favoured &quot;the total abolition of naval and military aircraft, plus the creation of an international&quot; civil air force along with German equality in aircraft. Later still in 1933 he advocated &quot;the abolition of aggressive arms&quot; as &quot;the power of the defensive&quot; would mean that &quot;France and the smaller countries would be safer than...in any other way&quot;. In October, a month before the Germans left the conference, Cecil said in a broadcast that the &quot;rules governing [German] disarmament&quot; should be &quot;the same in principle as those governing the armaments of any other civilised power&quot; and in a letter to Gilbert Murray he said &quot;Goebbels [had] made rather a favourable impression at Geneva and [was] said to be quite pleased with the League&quot;. He deplored the Nazis&#x27; education policy, however.

In April 1934, Cecil wrote to Philip Noel-Baker that Baldwin had told him that an attempt by Hankey to find a practical way of internationalising civil aviation had failed to which Cecil replied that he &quot;did not think Hankey was a very good adviser on such questions as he disapproved of peace and disarmament&quot;. Hankey had been an early critic of the feasibility of a League of Nations: in 1919 he complained that the British representatives on the League Commission, Cecil and Smuts, were idealists; Cecil was &quot;not very practical on this particular question. I am afraid their scheme will prove unworkable for two reasons, first, that it attempts too much, and second, that not enough attention is given to the machine&quot;. In 1923 he wrote that Cecil was a &quot;crank&quot;.

In 1934, Cecil criticised the British government for the missed opportunity of gaining French co-operation at the conference after the electoral victory of the French Radicals. In August he wrote to Murray that because Baldwin had quoted the &quot;arch-militarist F. S. Oliver&quot; in declaring that Britain&#x27;s real frontier was on the Rhine, he was very far from a League frame of mind and that the government &quot;ought to go&quot; in spite of &quot;the intellectual nonentity of the Labour party&quot;. He denounced the worldwide spread of nationalism and the outbreak of isolationism in Britain, claiming that isolation was a &quot;principle of anarchy&quot; and that in modern conditions countries could &quot;no more live alone than individuals&quot;. The British government in Cecil&#x27;s view was so anti-League that he should sever his connections with the Conservatives and began to favour relations with Labour.

The Stresa Front of 1935 between Britain, France and Italy received Cecil&#x27;s criticism because it appeared to be an alliance in which Germany was excluded and condoned their failure to disarm. Cecil wrote to Baldwin, arguing that Hitler should be given a chance to sign a disarmament treaty, though he doubted whether this would be effective because everything that Hitler had hitherto done, along with Prussian practice of the last two centuries, suggested that it would fail. But after its likely failure, the League would have reason for contemplating the &quot;economic and financial measures which might be applied to a state endangering peace by the unilateral repudiation of its international obligations&quot;.

In June 1935, Cecil believed that a &quot;collective threat from the League or a breach of British friendship&quot; would prevent the Italian invasion of Abyssinia of 1935 and 1936. The attempt to prevent it by ceding a part of British Somaliland to Italy met with Cecil&#x27;s approval. Later that year Cecil used the Union to pressure the government into League action against Italy. He also favoured oil sanctions and the closure of the Suez Canal (even if this breached international law). He became increasingly favourable towards Labour&#x27;s attitude to foreign policy and in August he contemplated joining that party. At the general election held in November, he favoured the Union&#x27;s policy of advising electors to vote for the candidate most likely to support the League. The Hoare-Laval Pact of December met with Cecil&#x27;s disapproval because it would mean that &quot;as between the League of Nations and Mussolini, Mussolini ha[d] won&quot; and that Hoare had set back the only hope of showing that aggression did not pay. Cecil believed that France&#x27;s suspicion of Germany was the main cause of the Pact and that Britain should therefore bargain with France possible British co-operation against Germany in return for French co-operation against Italy.

1935 saw the highest influence that Cecil and the Union had ever possessed. Thereafter, both went into sharp decline. The remilitarization of the Rhineland in March 1936 was to Cecil the &quot;most dangerous crisis since 1914&quot;, but it could not be resolved by &quot;letting off Italy&quot; since &quot;the security of France, of Russia and indeed of every country in Europe would now be greater had the League already proved by its defeat of Italian aggression that the organised community as a whole could stifle war&quot;. In April, Cecil believed that as Italy had to subdue Abyssinia quickly, Britain ought to favour existing sanctions and even increased sanctions against Italy. When Abyssinian resistance collapsed in May, Italy should have been expelled from the League to demonstrate that &quot;an effective system of collective security&quot; was possible. Otherwise, it would become obvious that the League was a &quot;failure&quot;, that the Union was &quot;bankrupt&quot; and that collective security was a &quot;farce&quot;.

Cecil tried to prevent Conservative withdrawal from the Union by presenting the League as &quot;an almost ideal machinery&quot; for the &quot;preservation of the Empire&quot;. However, the Union further swung to the left and received complaints from Neville Chamberlain and Conservative Central Office about the left-wing tone of Union propaganda. In May 1938 Cecil complained that the government had &quot;allowed the League to disintegrate&quot; and in August that their &quot;ambiguities and timidities&quot; were failing to ensure that Hitler understood that further aggression would be a breach of international relations.

In May 1938, he said in a letter that German diplomacy had never in history been founded on honest dealing: &quot;The Germans really conceive of their country as always under war conditions in this respect. No one expects a belligerent to tell the truth and, to the German mind, they are always belligerent. The Germans take the view that war is only intensified peace&quot;. Cecil was a critic of the Munich Agreement, whereby the German-speaking lands of Czechoslovakia were granted to Nazi Germany. He wrote to the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax on 20 September 1938 that he &quot;had not felt so bitterly on any public question since the fall of Khartoum&quot; in 1885. The conduct of the government had completely alienated Cecil from the Conservatives.

In his memoirs, Cecil wrote that the wife of the Czechoslovak President, Edvard Beneš, telephoned him on behalf of her husband and asked for advice on the crisis: &quot;I felt forced to reply that, much as I sympathized with her country, I could not advise her to rely on any help from mine. It was the only reply that could be made, but I have never felt a more miserable worm than I did when making it. To me and many others the transaction was as shameful as anything in our history&quot;. He further lamented, &quot;Nothing was more painful in the whole of these... negotiations than the constant threats of the Germans to enforce by arms any of their demands which were resisted, threats to which we instantly submitted&quot;. He wrote a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; denouncing Munich: &quot;But supposing there is a German guarantee, of what is its value? It is unnecessary to accuse Germany of perfidy. Not only the Nazi Government but all previous German Governments from the time of Frederick the Great downwards have made their position perfectly clear. To them, an international assurance is no more than a statement of present intention. It has no absolute validity for the future&quot;.

After the German invasion of the remaining Czechoslovak state in March 1939, Cecil was opposed to Eden rejoining the government because such a strengthening of Chamberlain would be a disaster. He had a low opinion of the Labour Party (except for Sir Stafford Cripps and Noel-Baker), whom he thought were doctrinaire and unpractical. In his view, Clement Attlee was &quot;not a leader&quot; and would have to be removed if Labour was to be effective. He wanted a &quot;closer union between European states&quot; against &quot;nationalism&quot; in the postwar settlement. In his 1941 book &quot;A Great Experiment&quot;, Cecil strongly criticised Sir John Simon, the Foreign Secretary between 1931-1935 for his weak response to the Japanese seizure of Manchuria region of China in 1931, which he believed had led directly to World War Two. Cecil argued that Simon should had the League of Nations impose sanctions on Japan in 1931, writing: &quot;If it had been stopped by an united League of Nations, it could have had no successors. Above all, it encouraged aggressive Powers in Europe-first in Italy and then Germany-to set at nought the barrier so laboriously erected at Geneva against aggression, and brought us step by step to the present intensely grave position&quot;. 

In the spring of 1946, he participated in the final meetings of the League at Geneva, ending his speech with the sentence: &quot;The League is dead; long live the United Nations!&quot;

==Later life==

He lived for thirteen more years, occasionally occupying his place in the House of Lords, and supporting international efforts for peace through his honorary life presidency of the United Nations Association.

In his last speech in the House of Lords on 23 April 1953, Cecil reiterated his commitment to world peace. He admitted that it is &quot;the essence of national sovereignty that independent nations cannot be compelled, except by force of arms, to take action of which their Governments disapprove—and that remains true, whatever may be the terms of any general agreement they may have made. No elaborate or ingenious organisation will alter that fact&quot;.

He added that any plan for international peace must rest on Christian civilisation and &quot;we British especially insist that in our own country, from the days of King Alfred to the present time, Christian civilisation has been responsible for every improvement and every advance that has been made&quot;. He said that that system had been attacked by Russian dialectical materialism, &quot;its central tenet is that there is no such thing as the spiritual nature of man, or, if there is, it should be ignored or stamped out as speedily as possible&quot;. However, &quot;If you ignore or abolish the spiritual nature of man, you destroy the foundation on which rests all truth, justice and freedom, except such as can flow from the love of money or what money can buy&quot;. He advocated rearmament to prevent a Marxist attack and claimed that &quot;Christian civilisation is the only real alternative to dialectical materialism&quot;. Unless there was a change in the principle of materialism, &quot;I do not see how we can have any permanent security for peace&quot;.

==Honours==

Cecil&#x27;s career brought him many honours. In addition to his peerage, he was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1956, was elected chancellor of the University of Birmingham (1918–1944) and rector of the University of Aberdeen (1924–1927). He was given the Peace Award of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation in 1924. Most significantly, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1937. He was presented with honorary degrees by the Universities of Edinburgh, Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, Liverpool, St Andrews, Aberdeen, Princeton, Columbia, and Athens.

Cecil died on 24 November 1958 at his home at Chelwood Gate, Danehill near Haywards Heath. He left no heirs and his Viscountcy became extinct.

==Legacy==

Lord Home paid tribute to Cecil in the House of Lords two days after his death:

He was one of the first people, perhaps, in the modern world...to foresee the absolute need for nations to meet round the table in discussion of their national affairs in the interests of peace. He was one of the architects of the League of Nations. And your Lordships will recall the unflagging enthusiasm with which he pursued the cause of peace wherever he went. His vision of a world disarmed, where conciliation would hold the day, was time and again disappointed...all since have been convinced of the rightness of his ideal, although the world has not proved itself yet great enough to match his great conception. In the United Nations, which was the successor of the League of Nations, there is many a living monument to Lord Cecil. Many of the committees which do great work in the international field were the result of his conception and are daily drawing people closer and closer together in interdependence. I, myself, because my father was very keen and with him did much in the League of Nations field, remember Lord Robert Cecil coming to stay at home; and many a time at dinner, when I was a comparatively young man, I would watch him, with his long figure, slide more and more under the table, until only the distinguished head was left above his plate, and he would tell us of all his plans for the future peace of the world. Ever since then I have felt that so long as he was alive there was one among us who, however bitter the strife and however blind the world, never despaired of finding peace in our time.

Viscount Alexander of Hillsborough said that Cecil &quot;impressed me by his complete devotion to the cause which ought to be, if it is not, the main cause in all our lives—to try to secure peace and to establish the brotherhood of man...I am sure that the whole nation mourns the loss of a great public figure, to whom and to whose work we are all greatly indebted&quot;. Clement Attlee also paid tribute: &quot;I think the whole world has lost a very great man and a very great friend. Wherever the cause of peace is mentioned, the name of Lord Cecil will always come up, and the complete devotion that he gave to that cause for so many years&quot;. Lord Pethick-Lawrence said of Cecil that his &quot;life was devoted not to self, not to his own aggrandisement or some advantage of a personal kind, but to the well-being of his fellow human beings and the good fortune of this country and the whole world&quot;.

Salvador de Madariaga summed up Cecil&#x27;s character:

The gaunt, stooping, clerical figure of Robert Cecil seemed ever drawn forward by an eager zest which one fancied sharpened his long pointed nose and flashed in his powerful eye (only one: in Cecil the other eye did not matter). That cross hanging from his waistcoat pocket witnessed to the religious basis of his political faiths; but the sharp tongue, the determined chin, the large, powerful hand, the air of a man used to be obeyed, proud towards men if humble before God, did suggest that in that tall figure striding with his long legs the thronged corridors of the League, the levels of Christian charity were kept high above the plane of fools.

<doc id="324659" wikidata="Q1125605" url="?curid=324659" title="French Democratic Confederation of Labour">
<text>The French Democratic Confederation of Labour (, CFDT) is a national trade union center, one of the five major French confederations of trade unions, led since 2023 by . It is the second largest French trade union confederation by number of members (625,000) and recently becoming first in voting results for representative bodies, having traditionally been second.

== History ==
The CFDT has its roots in Christian trade unionism of the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC). 

After the Liberation of France, a left-wing minority, grouped in the Reconstruction tendency, led an internal debate in favour of the “deconfessionalization” seeking to secularise the CFTC and achieve greater autonomy from political and religious circles with which the confederation&#x27;s leadership had been associated. The Reconstruction movement also campaigned for left-wing, social democracy and democratic trade unionism without being Marxist, and against the European treaties deemed to restore a capitalist Europe, under the guise of Christian democracy. 

This tendency took root in the mineworker and steelworker sections, in the wake of French Resistanceand the &quot;&quot;, Gradually the movement grew in strength within the CFTC, becoming its dominant force in to 1960s under the leadership of .

The breakthrough came in 1964, when an extraordinary CFTC congress—held at the Palais des Sports in Paris on 6 and 7 November—voted to secularise the CFTC and rename it to the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT). A minority of approximately 10% opposed the change and instead followed into the immediately refounded &quot;continuation French Confederation of Christian Workers&quot;.

At first, under the leadership of Eugène Descamps, the CFDT presented itself as a social-democratic confederation close to the Unified Socialist Party (&quot;Parti socialiste unifié&quot; or PSU) which was led by Pierre Mendès-France. It sometimes acted in concert with the Communist Party aligned General Confederation of Labour (CGT). This alliance took a part in the May 68 upheaval. Then, the CFDT was auto-gestionary.

In 1974, many PSU and CFDT members joined the Socialist Party (&quot;Parti socialiste&quot; or PS) led by François Mitterrand. With Michel Rocard at their helm, they formed an internal opposition called &quot;the second left&quot;. They abandoned the auto-gestionary project and advocated aligning themselves with the European social-democracy model. At the same time, under the leadership of Edmond Maire, the CFDT cut its ties with the CGT.

In the 1980s, after François Mitterrand&#x27;s election and his choice to follow social democratic economic policies, the CFDT appeared to be a pro-governmental organization. During this time a lot of members and voters were lost. In the 1990s, under the leadership of Nicole Notat, the CFDT chose to distance its strategy from the PS. In this, it supported Alain Juppé&#x27;s plan of Welfare State reform. It replaced Force ouvrière (FO) as the &quot;main partner&quot; of employers and right-wing governments, and the presidency of social security offices.

In 2003, the support of the new CFDT leader François Chérèque for pensions reform plans caused an internal crisis. Some CFDT members left the confederation and chose the CGT or the autonomous trade unions SUD. However, the CFDT participated with the other confederations to the 2006 conflict about the &quot;Contrat première embauche&quot; (CPE).

==Professional elections==
The CFDT won 21.81% of the vote in the employee&#x27;s college during the 2008 professional elections, making it the second largest trade union in terms of votes in those elections. This result, however, is below the CFDT&#x27;s 25.23% result in 2002 and its top result to date, 25.35% in 1997.

<doc id="324663" wikidata="Q1669855" url="?curid=324663" title="Float chamber">
<text>A float chamber is a device for automatically regulating the supply of a liquid to a system. It is most typically found in the carburettor of an internal combustion engine, where it automatically meters the fuel supply to the engine. However, this arrangement is found in many automatic liquid systems, for example the cistern of most toilets could be said to be a type of float chamber.

A float chamber works by allowing liquid within the chamber to lift a float which is linked to a valve which regulates the liquid intake. When the level is low, the float drops and opens the valve, allowing in liquid until the float rises sufficiently to close off the valve again. This is identical in principle to the ballcock valve.

== Carburetors ==
Carburetors are provided with a float chamber to provide a constant hydrostatic head of fuel above the carburettor&#x27;s metering jets, thus a constant pressure. The float chamber itself does not vary the pressure according to demand, but it does vary the supply flowrate with demand, to keep this pressure constant. 

The valve is often described as a needle valve, although this is a misnomer. A true needle valve uses a tapered needle in a tapered seat, so as to provide fine control over flow rate. The float valve uses a pointed needle against a square-edged seat, to give a positive shut-off.

As the float relies on gravity, the chamber must be mounted vertically. Some designs, such as the SU, may allow a separate float chamber body to be adjusted relative to the carburettor to compensate for this. Acceleration effects may also apply a forwards force on the float and so the float hinges often have to be mounted across the car to avoid surging. Some designs, such as the Stromberg use wide, shallow floats to reduce surging. 

One drawback of the basic type of float chamber described is that it only operates correctly when it is the right way up, so more sophisticated solutions are needed in aircraft.
