<text>Howard William Cosell (; né Cohen; March 25, 1918 – April 23, 1995) was an American sports journalist, broadcaster and author. Cosell became prominent and influential during his tenure with ABC Sports from 1953 until 1985.

Cosell was widely known for his blustery, confident personality. Cosell said of himself, &quot;I&#x27;ve been called arrogant, pompous, obnoxious, vain, cruel, verbose, a showoff. And, of course, I am.&quot;
Cosell was sardonically nicknamed &quot;Humble Howard&quot; by fans and media critics. In its obituary for Cosell, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Cosell&#x27;s effect on American sports coverage:

He entered sports broadcasting in the mid-1950s, when the predominant style was unabashed adulation, [and] offered a brassy counterpoint that was first ridiculed, then copied until it became the dominant note of sports broadcasting.

He also brought an antagonistic, almost heel-like commentary, notably his giving criticism of Terry Bradshaw by suggesting that he did not have the intelligence to win in the league.

In 1993, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named Howard Cosell The All-Time Best Sportscaster.

==Early life and family==
Cosell was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to accountant Isidore Cohen and his wife Nellie (Rosenthal) Cohen; his parents were Jewish. He had an elder brother, Hilton (1914–1992). The grandson of a rabbi, he was raised in Brooklyn, New York City.

The name of Cosell&#x27;s grandfather was changed when he entered the United States; Howard Cosell said he changed his name from &quot;Cohen&quot; to &quot;Cosell&quot; while a law student as a way to honor his father and grandfather by reverting to a version of his family&#x27;s original Polish name.

During World War II, Cosell served in the Army Transportation Corps from 1942 to 1945. He was honorably discharged with the rank of major.

==Career==
===Introduction to broadcasting===
In the early 1950s, Cosell had a sports radio show which he would record early in the morning. Ned Garver recalled doing an interview with him in 1951. Cosell told Garver that the sponsor did not provide any gifts to the guests on the show, but Garver found out later that there actually were gifts and that Cosell kept them himself.

Cosell represented the Little League of New York, when in 1953, Hal Neal (president ABC Radio), then an ABC Radio manager, asked him to host a show on New York flagship WABC featuring Little League participants. The show marked the beginning of a relationship with WABC and ABC Radio that would last his entire broadcasting career.

Cosell hosted the Little League show for three years without pay, and then decided to leave law to become a full-time broadcaster. He approached Robert Pauley, President of ABC Radio, with a proposal for a weekly show. Pauley told him the network could not afford to develop untried talent, but he would be put on the air if he would get a sponsor. To Pauley&#x27;s surprise, Cosell came back with a relative&#x27;s shirt company as a sponsor, and the show &quot;Speaking of Sports&quot; was born.

Cosell took his &quot;tell it like it is&quot; approach when he teamed with the ex–Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher &quot;Big &quot;Numba&quot; Thirteen&quot; Ralph Branca on WABC&#x27;s pre- and post-game radio shows of the New York Mets in their nascent years beginning in 1962. He pulled no punches in taking members of the hapless expansion team to task.

Otherwise on radio, Cosell did his show, &quot;Speaking of Sports&quot;, as well as sports reports and updates for affiliated radio stations around the country; he continued his radio duties even after he became prominent on television. Cosell then became a sports anchor at WABC-TV in New York, where he served in that role from 1961 to 1974. He expanded his commentary beyond sports to a radio show, &quot;Speaking of Everything&quot;.

===Rise to prominence, support of black athletes===
Cosell rose to prominence in the early-1960s, covering boxer Muhammad Ali, beginning from the time he fought under his birth name, Cassius Clay. The two seemed to have an affinity despite their different personalities, and complemented each other in broadcasts. Cosell was one of the first sportscasters to refer to the boxer as Muhammad Ali after he changed his name, and supported him when he refused to be inducted into the military. Cosell was also an outspoken supporter of Olympic sprinters John Carlos and Tommie Smith, after they raised their fists in a &quot;black power&quot; salute during their 1968 medal ceremony in Mexico City. In a time when many sports broadcasters avoided touching social, racial, or other controversial issues, and kept a certain level of collegiality towards the sports figures they commented on, Cosell did not, and indeed built a reputation around his catchphrase, &quot;I&#x27;m just telling it like it is.&quot;

Cosell&#x27;s style of reporting transformed sports broadcasting in the United States. Whereas previous sportscasters had mostly been known for color commentary and lively play-by-play, Cosell had an intellectual approach. His use of analysis and context brought television sports reporting closer to &quot;hard&quot; news reporting. However, his distinctive staccato voice, accent, syntax, and cadence were a form of color commentary all their own.

Cosell earned his greatest interest from the public when he backed Ali after the boxer&#x27;s championship title was stripped from him for refusing military service during the Vietnam War. Cosell found vindication several years later when he was able to inform Ali that the United States Supreme Court had unanimously ruled in favor of Ali in &quot;Clay v. United States&quot;.

Cosell called most of Ali&#x27;s fights immediately before and after the boxer returned from his three-year exile in October 1970. Those fights were broadcast on tape delay usually a week after they were transmitted on closed circuit. However, Cosell did not call two of Ali&#x27;s biggest fights, the Rumble in the Jungle in October 1974 and the first Ali–Joe Frazier bout in March 1971. Promoter Jerry Perenchio selected actor Burt Lancaster, who had never provided color commentary for a fight, to work the bout with longtime announcer Don Dunphy and former light-heavyweight champion Archie Moore. Cosell attended that fight as a spectator only. He would do a voice-over of that bout, when it was shown on ABC a few days before the second Ali-Frazier bout in January 1974.

Perhaps his most famous call took place in early 1973 at the fight between heavyweight champion Joe Frazier and top challenger George Foreman in Kingston, Jamaica. When Foreman knocked Frazier to the mat the first of six times, roughly two minutes into the first round, Cosell yelled out:

His call of Frazier&#x27;s first trip to the mat became one of the most quoted phrases in American sports broadcasting history. Foreman beat Frazier by a TKO in the second round to win the World Heavyweight Championship.

Cosell provided blow-by-blow commentary for ABC of some of boxing&#x27;s biggest matches during the 1970s and the early-1980s, including Ken Norton&#x27;s upset win over Ali in 1973 and Ali&#x27;s defeat of Leon Spinks in 1978 recapturing the heavyweight title for the third time. His signature toupee was unceremoniously knocked off in front of live ABC cameras when a scuffle broke out after a broadcast match between Scott LeDoux and Johnny Boudreaux. Cosell quickly retrieved his hairpiece and replaced it. During interviews in studio with Ali, the champion would tease and threaten to remove the hairpiece with Cosell playing along but never allowing it to be touched.

Ali would frequently refer to Cosell&#x27;s hairpiece as a squirrel, rabbit or other wild animal. On one of these occasions, Ali quipped, &quot;Cosell, you&#x27;re a phony, and that thing on your head comes from the tail of a pony.&quot;

With typical headline-generating drama, Cosell abruptly ended his broadcast association with the sport of boxing while providing coverage for ABC for the heavyweight championship bout between Larry Holmes and Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb on November 26, 1982. Halfway through the bout and with Cobb absorbing a beating, Cosell stopped providing anything more than rudimentary comments about round number and the participants punctuated with occasional declarations of disgust during the 15 rounds. He declared shortly after the fight to a national television audience that he had broadcast his last professional boxing match.

Cosell also was an ABC commentator for the television broadcast of the second of the two famous 1973 &quot;Battles of the Sexes&quot; tennis matches, this one between Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean King.

===Feuds===
During Cosell&#x27;s tenure as a sportscaster, he frequently clashed with longtime &quot;New York Daily News&quot; sports columnist Dick Young, who rarely missed an opportunity to denigrate the broadcaster in print as an &quot;ass&quot;, a &quot;shill&quot;, or most often, &quot;Howie the Fraud&quot;. Young would sometimes stand near Cosell and shout profanities so that the audio he was taping for his radio show would be unusable. Writing about Cosell, sportswriter Jimmy Cannon sniped, &quot;This is a guy who changed his name, put on a toupee and tried to convince the world that he tells it like it is.&quot; He further added, &quot;If Howard Cosell were a sport, he&#x27;d be roller derby.&quot;

Cosell, according to longtime ABC racecaster Chris Economaki, &quot;had an enormous and monumental ego, and may have been the most pompous man I&#x27;ve ever met&quot;. Cosell ripped Economaki for a miscue in an interview with Cale Yarborough for ABC &quot;(and he) never let me forget that&quot;. At an ABC Christmas party Economaki&#x27;s wife asked to be introduced to Cosell and Chris said, &quot;″Howard, for some inexplicable reason my wife wants to meet you...&#x27; and it (ticked) him off to no end. He really took it personally.&quot;

===&quot;Monday Night Football&quot;===
In 1970, ABC executive producer for sports Roone Arledge hired Cosell to be a commentator for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; (&quot;MNF&quot;), the first time in 15 years that American football was broadcast weekly in prime time. Cosell was accompanied most of the time by ex-football players Frank Gifford and &quot;Dandy&quot; Don Meredith.

Cosell was openly contemptuous of ex-athletes appointed to prominent sportscasting roles solely on account of their playing fame. He regularly clashed on-air with Meredith, whose laid-back style was in sharp contrast to Cosell&#x27;s more critical approach to the games.

The Cosell-Meredith-Gifford dynamic helped make &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; a success; it frequently was the number one rated program in the weekly Nielsen ratings. The inimitable style of the group (mostly with Cosell, both loved and hated by the public) distinguished &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; as a distinct spectacle, and ushered in an era of more colorful broadcasters and 24/7 TV sports coverage.

It was during his &quot;MNF&quot; run that Cosell coined a phrase that came to be so identified with football that other announcers and spectators—notably Chris Berman—began to repeat it. An ordinary kickoff return began with Cosell giving commentary about a player&#x27;s difficult life. It became extraordinary when he suddenly observed, in his trademark staccato rhythm, &quot;He could ... go all ... the way!&quot;

Cosell has been credited for popularizing the term &quot;nachos&quot; during his time in the &quot;MNF&quot; booth.

====Departure from &quot;MNF&quot;: Alvin Garrett incident====
During the first half of the September 5, 1983 &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game between the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins, Cosell&#x27;s commentary on wide receiver Alvin Garrett included &quot;That little monkey gets loose doesn&#x27;t he?&quot; Cosell&#x27;s references to Garrett as a &quot;little monkey,&quot; ignited a racial controversy that laid the groundwork for Cosell&#x27;s departure from &quot;MNF&quot; at the end of the 1983 season. The Rev. Joseph Lowery, then-president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, denounced Cosell&#x27;s comment as racist and demanded a public apology. Despite supportive statements by Jesse Jackson, Muhammad Ali, and Alvin Garrett himself, the fallout contributed to Cosell&#x27;s decision to leave &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; following the 1983 season.

&quot;I liked Howard Cosell,&quot; Garrett said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel that it was a demeaning statement.&quot; Cosell explained that Garrett&#x27;s small stature, and not his race, was the basis for his comment, citing the fact that he had used the term to describe his own grandchildren. Among other evidence to support Cosell&#x27;s claim is video footage of a 1972 preseason game between the New York Giants and the Kansas City Chiefs that features Cosell referring to athlete Mike Adamle, a 5-foot, 8-inch, 195-pound European American, as a &quot;little monkey.&quot;

===Olympics===
Along with &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, Cosell worked the Olympics for ABC. He played a key role on ABC&#x27;s coverage of the Palestinian terror group Black September&#x27;s mass murder of Israeli athletes in Munich at the 1972 Summer Olympics; providing reports directly from the Olympic Village (his image can be seen and voice heard in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film about the terror attack).

In the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal, and the 1984 games in Los Angeles, Cosell was the main voice for boxing. Sugar Ray Leonard won the gold medal in his light welterweight class at Montreal, beginning his meteoric rise to a world professional title three years later. Cosell became close to Leonard, during this period, announcing many of his fights.

===&quot;The Bronx is burning&quot;===
Cosell was widely attributed with saying the famous phrase &quot;the Bronx is burning&quot;. Cosell is credited with saying this during Game 2 of the 1977 World Series, which took place in Yankee Stadium on October 12, 1977. For a couple of years, fires had routinely erupted in the South Bronx, mostly due to owners of low-value properties burning their own real estate for insurance money. During the bottom of the first inning, an ABC aerial camera panned a few blocks from Yankee Stadium to a building on fire. The scene became a defining image of New York City in the 1970s. Cosell supposedly stated, &quot;There it is, ladies and gentlemen. The Bronx is burning.&quot; This was later picked up by Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan, who then made a special trip to the Bronx, to illustrate the failures of politicians to address the issues in that part of New York City.

In 2005, author Jonathan Mahler published &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning&quot;, a book about New York in 1977, and credited Cosell with the title quote during the aerial coverage of the fire. ESPN produced a 2007 mini-series based on the book &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot;. Cosell&#x27;s comment seemed to have captured the widespread view that New York City was in a state of decline.

The truth was discovered after Major League Baseball published a complete DVD set of all of the games of the 1977 World Series. Coverage of the fire began with Keith Jackson&#x27;s comments regarding the enormity of the blaze, while Cosell added that President Jimmy Carter had visited that area just days before. At the top of the second inning, the fire was once again shown from a helicopter-mounted camera, and Cosell commented that the New York Fire Department had a hard job to do in the Bronx as there were always numerous fires. In the bottom of the second, Cosell informed the audience that it was an abandoned building that was burning and no lives were in danger. There was no further comment on the fire, and Cosell appears to have never said &quot;The Bronx is Burning&quot; (at least not on camera) during Game 2.

Mahler&#x27;s confusion could have arisen from a 1974 documentary entitled &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot;; it is likely Mahler confused the documentary with his recollection of Cosell&#x27;s comments when writing his book.

===Public report of the death of John Lennon===

On the night of December 8, 1980, during a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game between the Miami Dolphins and the New England Patriots, Cosell shocked the television audience by interrupting his regular commentary duties to deliver a news bulletin on the murder of John Lennon in the midst of a live broadcast. Word had been passed to Cosell and Frank Gifford by Roone Arledge, who was president of ABC&#x27;s news and sports divisions at the time, near the end of the game.

Cosell was initially apprehensive about announcing Lennon&#x27;s death. Off the air, Cosell conferred with Gifford and others, saying: &quot;Fellas, I just don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;d like your opinion. I can&#x27;t see this game situation allowing for that news flash, can you?&quot; Gifford replied, &quot;Absolutely. I can see it.&quot; Gifford later told Cosell, &quot;Don&#x27;t hang on it. It&#x27;s a tragic moment and this is going to shake up the whole world.&quot;

On air, Gifford prefaced the announcement saying, &quot;And I don&#x27;t care what&#x27;s on the line, Howard, you have got to say what we know in the booth.&quot; Cosell then replied:

Lennon had been shot four times and had not been pronounced dead on arrival, but the facts of the shooting were not clear at the time of the announcement. Lennon once appeared on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, during the December 9, 1974, telecast of a 23–17 Washington Redskins win over the Los Angeles Rams, and was interviewed for a short breakaway segment by Cosell.

ABC had obtained this scoop as a result of the coincidence of an ABC employee, Alan Weiss, being at the same emergency room where the critically wounded Lennon was brought that night. This unwittingly violated a request to the hospital by Lennon&#x27;s wife, Yoko Ono, to delay reporting his death until she could tell their son, Sean, herself. Sean, age 5, was not watching television at the time as it was near midnight, and Ono was able to break the news to him. NBC beat ABC to the punch, however, interrupting &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; just minutes before Cosell&#x27;s announcement with a &quot;breaking news&quot; segment.

===Sports journalism and &quot;ABC SportsBeat&quot; magazine show===
In the fall of 1981, Cosell debuted a serious investigative 30-minute magazine show, &quot;ABC SportsBeat&quot; on ABC&#x27;s weekend schedule. He made news and covered topics that were not part of general sports coverage - including the first story about drugs in professional sports (the story of former Minnesota Viking Carl Eller&#x27;s cocaine use), an in-depth look at how NFL owners negotiated tax breaks and incentives for building new stadiums, and together with Arthur Ashe, an investigation into apartheid and sports. Though ratings were low, Cosell and his staff earned three Emmy Awards for excellence in reporting, and broke new ground in sports journalism. At the time, &quot;ABC SportsBeat&quot; was the first and only regularly scheduled network program devoted solely to sports journalism.

To produce this pioneering program, Cosell recruited a number of employees from outside the ranks of those that produced games, who he felt might be too invested in the success of the athletes and leagues to look at the hard news. He brought in Michael Marley, then a sportswriter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;; Lawrie Mifflin, a writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;; and a 20-year-old researcher who quickly rose to an associate producer, Alexis Denny. As a sophomore at Yale, Ms. Denny had been a student in a seminar that Cosell taught on the &quot;Business of Big-Time Sports in America&quot;, and was selected by the Director of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; to join their production crew. She took her junior year off to join Cosell&#x27;s staff at ABC Headquarters in New York City, and produced many segments, including in 1983 a half-hour special report previewing the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Despite the games being one of ABC&#x27;s biggest investments, with a record-breaking $225 million rights fee at the time, the 30-minute documentary-style program produced by Denny showed many sides of the questions about the viability of the games themselves—from concerns about traffic, pollution and terrorism, to a look at how the sponsorship deals were structured.

In his 1985 autobiography, Cosell reflected on his highly diverse work, and concluded that the &quot;SportsBeat&quot; series had been his favorite.

==Non-sports-related appearances==
Cosell&#x27;s colorful personality and distinctive voice were featured to fine comedic effect in several sports-themed episodes of the ABC TV series &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. His feuds with New York City sportswriter Oscar Madison (Jack Klugman) mirrored the real life feuds he had with some of New York&#x27;s leading sportswriters. He also appeared in the Woody Allen films &quot;Bananas&quot;, &quot;Sleeper&quot; and &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot;. Such was his celebrity that while he never appeared on the show, Cosell&#x27;s name was frequently used as an all-purpose answer on the popular 1970s game show &quot;Match Game&quot;. Cosell also had a cameo appearance in the 1988 movie &quot;Johnny Be Good&quot; featuring Robert Downey Jr., Anthony Michael Hall and Uma Thurman. His particular speech pattern was also imitated by one of the characters in the film &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;.

Cosell&#x27;s national fame was further boosted in fall 1975 when &quot;Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell&quot; aired on Saturday evenings on ABC. This was an hour-long variety show, broadcast live from the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City and hosted by Cosell, which is not to be confused with the NBC series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (which coincidentally also premiered in 1975 under its original title of &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot;, to avoid confusion with Cosell&#x27;s show). Despite bringing several unknown comedians, such as Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest, and future &quot;SNL&quot; star Bill Murray to national prominence and showcasing the American TV debut of the Bay City Rollers (who later had a hit song by the name of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;), Cosell&#x27;s show was canceled after three months; the NBC show was officially renamed 
&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for the succeeding season and has retained the name ever since. Cosell later hosted the 1984–85 season finale of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Cosell was the announcer of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 1974 ABC television special &quot;Sinatra – The Main Event&quot;.

Cosell appeared alongside Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra, Richie Havens, and others on a 1976 spoken word novelty record, &quot;The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay&quot;.

Beginning in 1976, Cosell hosted a long-running series of specials known as &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot;. The two-hour specials pitted celebrities from each of the three broadcast networks against each other in various athletic competitions, including relay races, swimming relays, tug of war, an obstacle course, and a dunk tank. Some of the specials also featured other events, such as golf, kayak racing, three-on-three touch football, or Frisbee. Cosell conducted short interviews with the participants between events, and was seen laughing, joking, and clearly enjoying himself throughout each show. Of Cosell, the program&#x27;s supervising producer Bill Garnet said in an interview, &quot;Cosell loved doing the show . . . He used to say, &#x27;I’m the biggest star out here. They all want to be around me!&#x27; But he loved doing the show.&quot; Actor LeVar Burton, who participated in 1977 and 1978, spoke warmly of having interacted with Cosell, describing his experience as &quot;...a great joy and one of my fondest memories. It’s like being heckled by Don Rickles, you know? Having Cosell insult you or even just mention your name was the Holy Grail for me.&quot; Cosell hosted all but one of the nineteen specials, including the final episode which aired in 1988.

In 1977, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

==Criticism of boxing==
Cosell denounced professional boxing during the broadcast of a November 26, 1982, WBC heavyweight championship bout between titleholder Larry Holmes and a clearly outmatched Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb at the Astrodome. The fight was held two weeks after the fatal fight between Ray Mancini and Kim Duk-koo, when Kim died shortly after the fight. Cosell famously asked the rhetorical question, &quot;I wonder if that referee [Steve Crosson] understands that he is constructing an advertisement for the abolition of the very sport that he&#x27;s a part of?&quot; Cosell, horrified over the brutality of the one-sided fight, said that if the referee did not stop the fight he would never broadcast a professional fight again.

Major boxing reforms were later implemented, the most important of which allows referees to stop clearly one-sided fights early in order to protect the health of the fighters. In amateur boxing, one-sided fights would be automatically stopped if one fighter had a score considerably higher than his opponent. Hitherto, only the ring physician had the authority to halt a bout. Another change was the reduction of championship bouts from fifteen rounds to twelve rounds by the WBC. (The fatal blows to Kim were in Rounds thirteen and fourteen.) The WBA quickly followed suit, and the IBF did so in 1988. Cosell did not cut off ties with the United States Amateur Boxing Federation. His 1984 broadcasts of the Olympic Trials, box-offs, and the 1984 Summer Olympics boxing tournament, all of which were at the amateur level with much shorter fights, were his last professional calls of the sport.

==&quot;I Never Played the Game&quot; and reaction==
After Cosell&#x27;s memoir &quot;I Never Played the Game&quot;, which, among other things, chronicled his disenchantment with fellow ABC commentators, was published in September 1985, Cosell was taken off scheduled announcing duties for that year&#x27;s World Series and was dismissed by ABC television shortly thereafter. Cosell&#x27;s book was seen by many as a bitter &quot;hate rant&quot; against those who had offended him. &quot;TV Guide&quot; published excerpts of his memoirs and reported that they had never had as many viewers&#x27; responses and they were overwhelmingly negative towards Cosell. The magazine reported some of the &quot;printable&quot; ones saying things such as &quot;Will Rogers never met Howard Cosell&quot;.

In &quot;I Never Played the Game&quot;, Cosell popularized the word &quot;&quot; (originally coined by author Robert Lipsyte), describing how athletes were given announcing jobs that they had not earned. Coincidentally, he was replaced for the 1985 World Series broadcast by Tim McCarver, himself a former baseball player, to join Al Michaels and Jim Palmer. (The title of the book is a double entendre, meaning that Cosell never actually played the game of football or any other professional sport he broadcast, as well as implying that he never played the &quot;game&quot; of corporate politics.) Cosell is notably absent from the Pro Football Hall of Fame. However, he was recently nominated as a semifinalist for the class of 2025 for the bronze bust and gold jacket. 

In his later years, Cosell briefly hosted his own television talk show, &quot;Speaking of Everything&quot;, authored his last book (&quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With Sports&quot;), and continued to appear on radio and television, becoming more outspoken about his criticisms of sports in general.

==Later life==
In 1993, Cosell was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. A year later, in 1994, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. He was also the 1995 recipient of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. After his wife of 46 years, Mary Edith Abrams Cosell (known as &quot;Emmy&quot;) died from a heart attack in 1990, Cosell largely withdrew from the public eye and his health began failing. A longtime smoker, he was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1991, and had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor in his chest. He also had several minor strokes, and was diagnosed with heart disease, kidney disease and Parkinson&#x27;s.

==Death==
Cosell died at the Hospital for Joint Diseases in Manhattan on April 23, 1995, of a cardiac embolism at the age of 77. He is buried at Westhampton Cemetery, Westhampton, New York.

==Legacy==
Cosell was placed as number one on David J. Halberstam&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 50 All Time Network Television Sports Announcers&quot; on Yahoo! Sports in January 2009. The sports complex at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem was named for Cosell. In 2010, Cosell was posthumously inducted into the Observer&#x27;s Category in the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

In Woody Allen&#x27;s 1973 comedy &quot;Sleeper&quot;, Allen&#x27;s character Miles Monroe, who has been revived after 200 years in cryogenic suspension, is shown an excerpt of an ABC Wide World of Sports broadcast in which Cosell talks about Muhammad Ali. One of the scientists who has revived Miles, unsure of what the video means, says that the theory is that watching Cosell was a form of punishment for crimes committed against the state 200 years in the past. Miles Monroe agrees. &quot;Yes, that&#x27;s exactly what that was.&quot;

In the 1985 film &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;, one of the two Asian-American teenage brothers who regularly challenged John Cusack&#x27;s character to a street race is said to have learned English from listening to Cosell. The band Ben Folds Five have a song titled &quot;Boxing&quot; from 1995, which was written as a fictional monolog from Muhammad Ali to Cosell.

In Michael Mann&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Ali&quot;, Cosell is played by Jon Voight, who earned an Academy Award nomination for his performance. In the 2002 television film &quot;Monday Night Mayhem&quot;, Cosell was played by John Turturro.

Cosell&#x27;s daughter, Hilary Cosell, was a producer of NBC SportsWorld, and was one of the first women sports producers. She was also the senior producer of her father&#x27;s show, &quot;Speaking of Everything with Howard Cosell&quot;, an assistant producer of ABC News 20/20, and received four Emmy Award nominations.

Cosell&#x27;s nephew Greg Cosell is a senior producer at NFL Films. Cosell&#x27;s grandson Colin Cosell was named public address announcer (along with Marysol Castro) at Citi Field, home of the New York Mets, in 2018. Colin Cosell intended to honor his grandfather by enunciating Mets&#x27; third baseman Todd Frazier&#x27;s last name the same way Cosell did with Joe Frazier&#x27;s name in his famous &quot;Down Goes Frazier!&quot; call.

<text>Solomon Naumovich Rabinovich (; May 13, 1916), better known under his pen name Sholem Aleichem (Yiddish and , also spelled in Soviet Yiddish, ; Russian and ), was a Yiddish author and playwright who lived in the Russian Empire and in the United States. The 1964 musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, based on Aleichem&#x27;s stories about Tevye the Dairyman, was the first commercially successful English-language stage production about Jewish life in Eastern Europe.

The Hebrew phrase שלום עליכם (shalom aleichem) literally means &quot;[May] peace [be] upon you!&quot;, and is a greeting in traditional Hebrew and Yiddish.

==Biography==

Solomon Naumovich (Sholom Nohumovich) Rabinovich () was born in 1859 in Pereiaslav and grew up in the nearby &quot;shtetl&quot; of Voronkiv, in the Poltava Governorate of the Russian Empire (now in the Kyiv Oblast of central Ukraine). (Voronkiv has become the prototype of Aleichem&#x27;s Kasrilevka.) His father, Menachem-Nukhem Rabinovich, was a rich merchant at that time. However, a failed business affair plunged the family into poverty and Solomon Rabinovich grew up in reduced circumstances. When he was 13 years old, the family moved back to Pereiaslav, where his mother, Chaye-Esther, died in a cholera epidemic.

Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s first venture into writing was an alphabetic glossary of the epithets used by his stepmother. At the age of fifteen, he composed a Jewish version of the novel &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. He adopted the pseudonym &quot;Sholem Aleichem,&quot; a Yiddish variant of the Hebrew expression &quot;shalom aleichem,&quot; meaning &quot;peace be with you&quot; and typically used as a greeting.

In 1876, after graduating from school in Pereiaslav, he began to work as a teacher. During 1877-1880 in Sofijka village, Bohuslav region, he spent three years tutoring a wealthy landowner&#x27;s daughter, Olga (Hodel) (1865–1942). From 1880 to 1883 he served as crown rabbi in Lubny.

On May 12, 1883, he and Olga married, against the wishes of her father, whose estate they inherited a few years later. Their first child, a daughter named Ernestina (Tissa), was born in 1884. In 1890, Sholem Aleichem lost their entire fortune in stock speculation and fled from his creditors. Daughter Lyalya (Lili) was born in 1887. As Lyalya Kaufman, she became a Hebrew writer. (Lyalya&#x27;s daughter Bel Kaufman, also a writer, was the author of &quot;Up the Down Staircase&quot;, which was also made into a successful film.) A third daughter, Emma, was born in 1888. In 1889, Olga gave birth to a son. They named him Elimelech, after Olga&#x27;s father, but at home they called him Misha. Daughter Marusi (who would one day publish &quot;My Father, Sholom Aleichem&quot; under her married name Marie Waife-Goldberg) was born in 1892. A final child, a son named Nochum (Numa) after Solomon&#x27;s father was born in 1901 (under the name Norman Raeben he became a painter and an influential art teacher).

After witnessing the pogroms that swept through southern Russian Empire in 1905, including Kiev, Sholem Aleichem left Kiev (which was fictionalized as Yehupetz) and emigrated to New York City, where he arrived in 1906. His family set up house in Geneva, Switzerland, but when he saw he could not afford to maintain two households, he joined them in Geneva in 1908. Despite his great popularity, he was forced to take up an exhausting schedule of lecturing to make ends meet. In July 1908, during a reading tour in Russia, Sholem Aleichem collapsed on a train going through Baranowicze. He was diagnosed with a relapse of acute hemorrhagic tuberculosis and spent two months convalescing in the town&#x27;s hospital. He later described the incident as &quot;meeting his majesty, the Angel of Death, face to face&quot;, and claimed it as the catalyst for writing his autobiography, &quot;Funem yarid&quot; [From the Fair]. He thus missed the first Conference for the Yiddish Language, held in 1908 in Czernovitz; his colleague and fellow Yiddish activist Nathan Birnbaum went in his place.

Sholem Aleichem spent the next four years living as a semi-invalid. During this period the family was largely supported by donations from friends and admirers (among his friends and acquaintances were fellow Yiddish authors I. L. Peretz, Jacob Dinezon, Mordecai Spector, and Noach Pryłucki). In 1909, in celebration of his 25th Jubilee as a writer, his friend and colleague Jacob Dinezon spearheaded a committee with Dr. Gershon Levine, Abraham Podlishevsky, and Noach Pryłucki to buy back the publishing rights to Sholem Aleichem’s works from various publishers for his sole use in order to provide him with a steady income. At a time when Sholem Aleichem was ill and struggling financially, this proved to be an invaluable gift, and Sholem Aleichem expressed his gratitude in a thank you letter in which he wrote,
Sholem Aleichem moved to New York City again with his family in 1914. The family lived at first in Harlem at 110 Lenox Avenue (at 116th Street) and later moved to 968 Kelly Street in the Bronx. His son, Misha, ill with tuberculosis, was not permitted entry under United States immigration laws and remained in Switzerland with his sister Emma.

Sholem Aleichem died at his Bronx apartment in 1916. He is buried in the main (old) section of Mount Carmel Cemetery in Queens, New York City.

==Literary career==
Like his contemporaries Mendele Mocher Sforim, I.L. Peretz, and Jacob Dinezon, Sholem Rabinovitch started writing in Hebrew, as well as in Russian. In 1883, when he was 24 years old, he published his first Yiddish story, צוויי שטיינער &quot;Tsvey Shteyner&quot; (&quot;Two Stones&quot;), using for the first time the pseudonym Sholem Aleichem.

By 1890 he was a central figure in Yiddish literature, the vernacular language of nearly all East European Jews, and produced over forty volumes in Yiddish. It was often derogatorily called &quot;jargon&quot;, but Sholem Aleichem used this term in an entirely non-pejorative sense.

Apart from his own literary output, Sholem Aleichem used his personal fortune to encourage other Yiddish writers. In 1888–89, he put out two issues of an almanac, די ייִדישע פאָלקסביבליאָטעק &quot;Di Yidishe Folksbibliotek&quot; (&quot;The Yiddish Public Library&quot;) which gave important exposure to young Yiddish writers.

In 1890, after he lost his entire fortune, he could not afford to print the almanac&#x27;s third issue, which had been edited but was subsequently never printed.

&quot;Tevye the Dairyman&quot;, in Yiddish טבֿיה דער מילכיקער &quot;Tevye der Milchiker&quot;, was first published in 1894.

Over the next few years, while continuing to write in Yiddish, he also wrote in Russian for an Odesa newspaper and for &quot;Voskhod&quot;, the leading Russian Jewish publication of the time, as well as in Hebrew for &quot;Ha-melitz,&quot; and for an anthology edited by YH Ravnitzky. It was during this period that Sholem Aleichem contracted tuberculosis.

In August 1904, Sholem Aleichem edited הילף : א זאַמלבוך פיר ליטעראטור אונ קונסט &quot;Hilf: a Zaml-Bukh fir Literatur un Kunst&quot; (&quot;Help: An Anthology for Literature and Art&quot;; Warsaw, 1904) and himself translated three stories submitted by Tolstoy (&quot;Esarhaddon, King of Assyria&quot;; &quot;Work, Death and Sickness&quot;; &quot;The Three Questions&quot;) as well as contributions by other prominent Russian writers, including Chekhov, in aid of the victims of the Kishinev pogrom.

==Critical reception==

Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s narratives were notable for the naturalness of his characters&#x27; speech and the accuracy of his descriptions of shtetl life. Early critics focused on the cheerfulness of the characters, interpreted as a way of coping with adversity. Later critics saw a tragic side in his writing. He was often referred to as the &quot;Jewish Mark Twain&quot; because of the two authors&#x27; similar writing styles and use of pen names. Both authors wrote for adults and children and lectured extensively in Europe and the United States. When Twain heard of the writer called &quot;the Jewish Mark Twain,&quot; he replied, &quot;Please tell him that I am the American Sholem Aleichem.&quot;

==Beliefs and activism==
Sholem Aleichem was an impassioned advocate of Yiddish as a national Jewish language, which he felt should be accorded the same status and respect as other modern European languages. He did not stop with what came to be called &quot;Yiddishism&quot;, but devoted himself to the cause of Zionism as well. Many of his writings present the Zionist case. In 1888, he became a member of Hovevei Zion. In 1907, he served as an American delegate to the Eighth Zionist Congress held in The Hague.

Sholem Aleichem had a fear of the number 13. His manuscripts never had a page 13; he numbered the thirteenth pages of his manuscripts as 12a. Though it has been written that even his headstone carries the date of his death as &quot;May 12a, 1916&quot;, his headstone reads the dates of his birth and death in Hebrew, the 26th of Adar and the 10th of Iyar, respectively.

==Death==

Sholem Aleichem died in New York on May 13, 1916, from tuberculosis and diabetes, aged 57, while working on his last novel, &quot;Motl, Peysi the Cantor&#x27;s Son&quot;, and was buried at Old Mount Carmel cemetery in Queens. At the time, his funeral was one of the largest in New York City history, with an estimated 100,000 mourners. The next day, his will was printed in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and was read into the Congressional Record of the United States.

==Commemoration and legacy==


Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s will contained detailed instructions to family and friends with regard to burial arrangements and marking his &quot;yahrtzeit&quot;.

He told his friends and family to gather, &quot;read my will, and also select one of my stories, one of the very merry ones, and recite it in whatever language is most intelligible to you.&quot; &quot;Let my name be recalled with laughter,&quot; he added, &quot;or not at all.&quot; The celebrations continue to the present day, and, in recent years, have been held at the Brotherhood Synagogue on Gramercy Park South in New York City, where they are open to the public.

He composed the text to be engraved on his tombstone in Yiddish, given here in transliteration:

In 1997, a monument dedicated to Sholem Aleichem was erected in Kyiv; another was erected in 2001 in Moscow.

The main street of Birobidzhan is named after Sholem Aleichem; streets were named after him also in cities in Ukraine, including Kyiv, Odesa, Vinnytsia, Lviv, and Zhytomyr. In New York City in 1996, East 33rd Street between Park and Madison Avenue is additionally named &quot;Sholem Aleichem Place&quot;. Many streets in Israel are named after him.

Postage stamps of Sholem Aleichem were issued by Israel (Scott #154, 1959); the Soviet Union (Scott #2164, 1959); Romania (Scott #1268, 1959); and Ukraine (Scott #758, 2009).

An impact crater on the planet Mercury also bears his name.

On March 2, 2009, 150 years after his birth, the National Bank of Ukraine issued an anniversary coin depicting and celebrating Aleichem.

Vilnius, Lithuania has a Jewish school named after him and in Melbourne, Australia a Yiddish school, Sholem Aleichem College is named after him. Several Jewish schools in Argentina were also named after him.

In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil a library named BIBSA – Biblioteca Sholem Aleichem was founded in 1915 as a Zionist institution by a local Jewish group. Next year, in 1916, the same group that created BIBSA founded a Jewish school named Escola Sholem Aleichem; it closed in 1997. BIBSA had a very active theatrical program in Yiddish for more than 50 years since its foundation and consistently performed Sholem Aleichem plays. In 1947 BIBSA became Associação Sholem Aleichem, under which name it continues to exist. Both the library and club became communist institutions due to a normal transition of power in the founding group, although non-communist members left to found their own school, Colégio Eliezer Steinbarg, in 1956. It is named after the first director of Escola Sholem Aleichem, a Jewish writer born in Romania who immigrated to Brazil.

In the Bronx, New York, a housing complex called The Shalom Aleichem Houses was built by Yiddish speaking immigrants in the 1920s, and was recently restored by new owners to its original grandeur. The Shalom Alecheim Houses are part of a proposed historic district in the area.

On May 13, 2016, a Sholem Aleichem website was launched to mark the 100th anniversary of Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s death. The website is a partnership between Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s family, his biographer Professor Jeremy Dauber, Citizen Film, Columbia University&#x27;s Center for Israel and Jewish Studies, The Covenant Foundation, and The Yiddish Book Center. The website features interactive maps and timelines, recommended readings, as well as a list of centennial celebration events taking place worldwide. The website also features resources for educators.

Hertz Grosbard recited many of his works in so called &quot;word concerts&quot;. A reading in Yiddish of his monologue &quot;If I Were a Rothschild&quot; and several others can be found on the Grosbard Project.

The writer&#x27;s brother, Wolf Rabinovich, published the memoir &quot;My Brother Sholom Aleichem&quot; in Kyiv, Ukrainian SSR, in 1939.

Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s granddaughter, Bel Kaufman, by his daughter Lala (Lyalya), was an American author, most widely known for her novel, &quot;Up the Down Staircase&quot;, published in 1964, which was adapted to the stage and also made into a motion picture in 1967, starring Sandy Dennis.

<text>Selby is a market town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England, south of York on the River Ouse. At the 2021 Census, it had a population of 17,193.

The town was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire; from 1974 until 2023, it was the administrative centre of the Selby District.

Selby once had a large shipbuilding industry, and was an important port on the Selby Canal, which brought trade from Leeds.

==History==
===Foundation===
Archaeological investigations in Selby have revealed extensive remains, including waterlogged deposits in the core of the town dating from the Roman period onwards. It is believed that Selby originated as a settlement called Seletun, which was referred to in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of AD 779.

The place name &#x27;Selby&#x27; is first attested in a Yorkshire charter , where it appears as &quot;Seleby&quot;. It appears as &quot;Selbi&quot; . The name is thought to be a Scandinavian form of Seletun, meaning &#x27;sallow tree settlement&#x27;.

===Development===
The town of Selby is on the main route north from the Midlands and is the traditional birthplace of King Henry I, fourth son of William the Conqueror, in 1068/69; the connection is supported by William and his wife Matilda&#x27;s unique joint charter of Selby Abbey, far to the north of their usual circuit of activities, which was founded for Benedict of Auxerre in 1069 and subsequently supported by the de Lacy family. King Henry I is reputed to have been born there in . A notable feature of the abbey is the 14th-century Washington Window, featuring the heraldic arms of the ancestors of George Washington, the first president of the United States. The design is often cited as an influence for the Stars and Stripes flag.

It is said that the abbey was founded when Benedict saw three swans on a lake in Selby, which he took as a sign of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and that is why the official crest of Selby Abbey is three swans. Selby Abbey was closed in 1539 as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII and the majority of the buildings have since been demolished. The central nave of the abbey church survived and in 1618 it became the parish church of Selby.

During the English Civil War the Royalist garrison of Selby was captured by Parliamentarians in the Battle of Selby on 11 April 1644. There are other historical sites, such as the cholera burial ground on the north side of the abbey, the market cross and the local school, Selby High School. The Market Place has existed since the early 14th century, when the market was moved away from the monastery churchyard. The Crescent which curves eastwards from James Street, was planned in the early 19th century by a local man, John Audus, after he saw Lansdown Crescent in Bath, Somerset.

===Since 2000===
Selby is expanding. New houses and shops are being built on the outskirts as far as the bypass, which has resulted in the loss of some trade from the town centre. Meanwhile, the riverfront is being revamped with modern housing and fashionable flats.

====Rail crash====

The 2001 Great Heck rail crash is also often referred to as the Selby rail crash. It happened a few miles south of Selby, at the village of Great Heck near the M62 motorway, and Selby was the closest major town to the accident site. On 28 February 2001 a vehicle crashed off the M62 down an embankment onto a railway track, where it was struck by a passenger train heading to London. The accident was then compounded by a second collision involving an oncoming goods train.

====Hobson murders====
Selby and its surrounding area came to national prominence once again through another tragedy on 18 July 2004, this time through four exceptionally violent murders carried out by former refuse collector Mark Hobson. Hobson, 34 at the time, killed his girlfriend, Claire Sanderson, 27, and her sister Diane at a flat in the nearby village of Camblesforth. He subsequently murdered an elderly couple, James and Joan Britton, at their home in the village of Strensall, near York. Hobson was later sentenced to life imprisonment, with the trial judge recommending that he should never be released; the High Court later agreed with this recommendation.

==Governance==

At the lowest level of governance is Selby Town Council. The town is divided into three electoral wards, north, south, each represented by five councillors, and west, represented by seven councillors. These 17 councillors are responsible for burial grounds, allotments, play areas and some street lighting. Elections to the town council are held every four years. The Mayor of Selby is elected annually by the members of the town council.

From 1974 to 2023, Selby was administered as part of a two-tier council system by Selby District Council. The town was represented by seven councillors on the District Council, two each for the west and south wards and three for the north ward.
On the North Yorkshire County Council the town was part of the Selby Barlby county division, which elected two representatives to the county council.

In April 2023, both councils, along with all district councils in North Yorkshire, were replaced by North Yorkshire Council. The unitary authority now provides all the services previously provided separately by the two councils.

In the United Kingdom Parliament, Selby formed part of the Selby constituency. It has been represented by Labour MP Keir Mather since July 2023, after he won a by-election held in the predecessor constituency Selby and Ainsty.

==Geography==
Selby lies on the tidal River Ouse in a natural area of Yorkshire known as the Humberhead Levels. The main roads that cross at Selby are the A63 from Leeds to Hull and the A19 from Doncaster to York, though the A19 and A63 have no longer met in Selby itself since the opening of the Selby Bypass in 2004. The River Ouse is navigable upstream as far as York so the old toll bridge, by which the A63 crossed the river at Selby, had to allow for this. For many years the swing bridge in Selby was a notorious local bottleneck but since the opening of the Selby bypass congestion in the town has been relieved.

The importance of Selby as a market town has declined in recent decades and its short-lived prominence as the centre of the Selby Coalfield has also waned. Selby is close to both York and Leeds. Its popularity as a tourist destination, owing to Selby Abbey, has led to a large amount of development and renovation in the town and surrounding area.

The residential areas of Selby have also been subject to expansion and development. A significant development called Staynor Hall continues to the south East of the town, with other developments in the Holmes Lane area and around the villages of Brayton, Barlby and Thorpe Willoughby. More have been built at various points along the riverfront, the result of an ongoing project to improve an area that had been largely derelict since the decline of the shipbuilding industry.

===Floods===
In recent years there have been serious flood problems in Selby and the adjoining village of Barlby. The threat in the Barlby area has been alleviated to some extent by work on improved flood barriers following the major flood of November 2000.

==Religion==
Selby Abbey is one of the largest parish churches in Britain and is larger than several cathedrals.

There are various other Christian churches in the town that offer community and differing styles of worship: King&#x27;s Church, St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Portholme Methodist / URC Church, and St James&#x27; Church. Edge Community was founded in 2009 for the Flaxley Road community, and The Salvation Army opened The Church at the Crossroads on the Abbotts Road estate in 2015.

Brayton has St Wilfrid&#x27;s Anglican Church and the Methodist Chapel and All Saints&#x27; Church is in Barlby. Thorpe Willoughby has St Francis Church.

Selby Churches Together set up and run the Selby and District Food Bank.

==Economy==
Much of the historical wealth of the town is based on its position on the banks of the tidal River Ouse. Selby used to have a large shipbuilding industry and was an important port on the Selby Canal, which brought trade from Leeds. The Selby Canal links the River Ouse at Selby to the River Aire at Haddlesey. The replacement Greenpeace craft (1989–2011), bearing the name &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, was built in Selby in 1957 as a fishing boat.
Selby&#x27;s location allowed vessels to be launched into the river. This often required the more unusual technique of launching the vessels side-on into the river owing to lack of space for a more conventional stern-first or bow-first launch. One famous vessel of the Cochrane and Son&#x27;s shipyard of the town is the preserved trawler &quot;Ross Tiger&quot; at Grimsby&#x27;s National Fishing Heritage Centre. Cochrane launched their last vessel into the Ouse in 1998, a historical occasion which people around the area went to see. After Cochrane had closed the massive cranes still stood over the skyline of Selby until 2001, when very strong winds blew them down. Most of the shipyard buildings are still standing (as of February 2014) and the site, along with interviews with former employees and archive film, was featured in a 2013 video production &#x27;Cochranes of Selby&#x27;. The site of the shipyard is currently home to many small businesses, housed in the buildings once used to build the Selby ships.
For a time Selby was the leading coal-mining area in the UK and featured some of the most advanced mining technology in Europe. It was the first new mine in the UK for decades and seen as a rejoinder to widespread concern that the British mining industry was effectively shutting down, particularly following the defeat of the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike.

Wistow Colliery, which was part of the Selby Coalfield, holds the UK record for coal mined in one week—200,743 tonnes in 1995. The Selby Complex, employing 3,000 miners plus contractors and ancillary staff, closed on Friday 14 May 2004 despite rising demand for coal in the UK. UK Coal, the pit&#x27;s owner, said closure was due to rising costs caused by deteriorating geological conditions and the falling price of coal. In its final years the company listed a £30 million loss on the plant.

Although much of the infrastructure of shipbuilding and coal mining remains both in and around Selby, both industries have long since been defunct. Now the main income for the area is derived from arable farming and as a commuter area for Leeds, Wakefield and York.

In recent years Selby has seen the development of new shopping areas both in the town centre and on the outskirts. The Abbey Walk Shopping Centre was developed on recreational land that runs parallel to the town centre. The expansion not only increased the volume of town-centre shops but also provided large-scale, convenient parking for the town centre. In more recent years the Three Lakes Retail Park has opened on the outskirts of town and continues to expand. Two of the town&#x27;s supermarkets, Tesco and Morrisons, are looking to expand their stores, the latter meaning the resiting of the Abbey Primary School.

On 14 September 2005, Selby District Council was conditionally granted outline planning permission for a state of the art science facility to be built on the site of Burn Gliding Club but these plans did not come to fruition.

==Transport==
Selby is the transport hub for the local area; it has a bus and railway station running services to many places around the area.

Train services from Selby railway station run directly to London King&#x27;s Cross, Leeds, Liverpool Lime Street, Manchester Piccadilly, York and Hull. Services are operated by several train operating companies; these are London North Eastern Railway, Northern Trains, TransPennine Express and Hull Trains.

Bus services are operated predominantly by Arriva Yorkshire, which runs a range of local services, as well as longer-distance routes to Goole, Leeds, Pontefract, Wakefield and York. Thornes Independent operate two routes to Hensall and Hemingbrough.

In July 2001, construction began on the Selby by-pass, which had been authorised for development in 1993. The by-pass runs from the A19 at Barlby, along the southern perimeter of Selby, joining the A63 at Thorpe Willoughby. The project was delayed owing to technical difficulties with the swing bridge over the River Ouse, but was eventually completed in July 2004.

==Culture and sport==
Selby Town Hall has been running a music venue since 2003, with regular performances of music, dance, drama and comedy and local band nights, with an annual Battle Of The Bands final, which in 2009 sold out in 12 hours, seeing local band Leonard&#x27;s Revenge crowned victors.

There have been four cinemas in Selby, with the last one closing in the early 1980s. In 2009 a community group established a cinema project called Selby Globe. The group is also working with local community groups in securing the Abbot&#x27;s Staith, a 15th-century warehouse currently on English Heritage&#x27;s At Risk Register. It is expected that the development of the Abbot&#x27;s Staith could offer opportunities for social, educational, historical and economic solutions for the town while also promoting tourism.
Selby&#x27;s major sporting team is Selby Town F.C. (&#x27;the Robins&#x27;), playing in the Northern Counties East Division One at the Flaxley Road Stadium. As a result of a sponsorship deal with a local business, the stadium is now known as the Fairfax Plant Hire Stadium. The club was founded in 1919 and their most successful season was perhaps 1953–54, when they won the Yorkshire Football League and reached the first round of the FA Cup – meeting Bradford Park Avenue and getting their highest ever attendance of 7,000 fans.

A rugby union club, Selby RUFC, plays at Sandhill Lane Stadium. Sandhill Lane Stadium is currently undergoing construction work to create a new seating stand overlooking the first team&#x27;s pitch, and a gym and new changing rooms are being added to the members&#x27; bar and existing club bar. Selby RUFC have five open-age teams and have veteran and junior set-ups. Selby 1st are currently in Yorkshire League Division One. In the season 2008–09 Selby U10s won the Gullivers Plate at Twickenham, the U16s got to the final of the Yorkshire Bowl and Selby 3rds reached a North Yorkshire final. Selby also has a rugby league club, Selby Warriors, which plays at The Rigid Containers Sports Ground, Foxhill Lane and the Selby Rugby League Referees Society.

Selby Cricket Club, which shares Sandhill Lane Stadium, has four senior league teams, with the 1st and 2nd XI playing in the York and District Senior League, the 1st XI in Division 4 and the 2nd XI in Division 5. The 3rd XI play in Division 4 and 4th XI play in Division 5 of the York Vale League. The team runs two junior teams, the under 11s and 15s, which both play in the York and District Junior League, and an evening league team in the Howdenshire Evening League (West Division).

Selby and District Motor Club has its own clubhouse at Breighton Airfield on Sand Lane. Meeting on Tuesday evenings, its members participate in Road Rallies, Stage Rallies, Sprints, Autotests and Production-Car Trials. Members discuss motor sporting events and regularly show videos. The club organises an annual Road Rally called the Three Swans Rally, based on local roads and forming a major part of local championships.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes is provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire from the Emley Moor TV transmitter.

The town&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio York, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, YO1 Radio, and Selby Radio which is a community based radio station.

Selby&#x27;s longest-established newspaper is the &quot;Selby Times&quot;, owned and published by Chronicle Publications along with its sister paper the &quot;Goole Times&quot;. The company previously owned the &quot;Selby Post&quot; and purchased the title from Johnston Press when they ceased publication of the paper in August 2013. Published weekly, the paper costs 60p and covers the Selby district, including the town centre and villages such as Sherburn-in-Elmet and as far as Tadcaster.

In 2014, despite the shift to online news, The &quot;Goole and Selby Times&quot; together were only one of three newspapers in the country actually to increase print sales. The &quot;Goole Times&quot; (incorporating the &quot;Selby Times&quot;) saw a rise of more than three quarters to 15,045 compared with the same period in 2013.

The &quot;Goole Times&quot; and &quot;Selby Times&quot; received an unprecedented 1,000 toys for their annual Christmas toy appeal in December 2017.

In 2019 The &quot;Selby Chronicle&quot; was relaunched as an online-only newspaper.

<text>The University of Essex is a public research university in Essex, England. Established by royal charter in 1965, it is one of the original plate glass universities. The university comprises three campuses in the county, in Southend-on-Sea and Loughton with its primary campus in Wivenhoe Park, Colchester.

Essex has a largely diverse student community and holds partnerships with more than 100 global higher education institutions. It was named University of the Year at the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; Awards in 2018. Essex&#x27;s Department of Government received Regius Professorship conferred by Queen Elizabeth II in 2013 and the university was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize on two occasions for advancing human rights in 2009 and social and economic research in 2017.

In the 2025 rankings of British universities, Essex is ranked 30th in the &quot;Complete&quot; &quot;University Guide&quot;, 23rd in &quot;The Guardian University Guide&quot; and 46th by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. It has produced alumni in several fields across the world; these include Nobel Prize laureates, a head of state, and senior governors and politicians.

==History==
===Foundation===
The University of Essex is one of the seven original plate glass universities established between 1961 and 1965. The university shield consists of the ancient arms attributed to the Kingdom of Essex and the motto: &quot;Thought the harder, heart the keener&quot; is adapted from the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;.

In July 1959, Essex County Council accepted a proposal from Charles Leatherland, Baron Leatherland to establish a university in the county. A University Promotion Committee was formed, chaired by Lord Lieutenant of Essex, Sir John Ruggles-Brise, which submitted a formal application to the University Grants Committee requesting for the establishment of the University of Essex. Initial reports suggested that the Promotion Committee recommended Hylands Park in Chelmsford as the primary site, however, in May 1961 an announcement in the House of Commons preferred the foundation of the university within Wivenhoe and in December, Wivenhoe Park was acquired for the new university. In July 1962, R. A. Butler was appointed as chancellor, Albert Sloman as vice-chancellor, with Anthony Rowland-Joins as registrar.

The first Professors were appointed in May 1963: Alan Gibson in Physics, Ian Proudman in Mathematics, John Bradley in Chemistry, Richard Lipsey in Economics, Peter Townsend in Sociology, Donald Davie in Literature, and Jean Blondel in Government. Whilst undergoing clearing for construction work, an Appeal Fund was deployed upon a development plan and within six months it exceeded its £1million target with The Queen Mother and Sir Winston Churchill among contributors. In Autumn 1963, red was preferred as the university colour, the first prospectus was prepared and work began on the first permanent buildings. In January 1964, the university&#x27;s academic robes were designed by Sir Hardy Amies, a Royal Warrant holder as designer to the Queen, and in March Sir John Ruggles-Brise was appointed the first Pro-Chancellor and Charles Leatherland, Baron Leatherland the first Treasurer of the university. Two months after, the university&#x27;s Armorial Bearings were published with the motto &quot;Thought the harder, heart the keener&quot;.

===Expansion===

In October 1964, the first 122 students arrived with 28 teaching staff in three schools: Comparative Studies, Physical Sciences and Social Studies. Departments of Chemistry, Physics, Government, Sociology, Literature, Mathematics and Economics opened along with the Language Centre (later the Department of Language and Linguistics) and the Computing Centre (later the Department of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering) with Denis Mesure elected as the first President of the Student Council. Work started on the first residential tower, Rayleigh, with The Queen approving the grant of Charter to take effect from 11 January 1965 in December.

1965 drew 399 students for the start of the new academic year. The number of academic staff more than doubled to 61 and the first degrees, five MSc and five MA degrees, were awarded. Whilst construction began on the library building (later renamed the Albert Sloman Library), the Physics building opened and the first six floors of Rayleigh tower were ready for occupation. Dorothy E. Smith became the first female lecturer to be appointed, for the Department of Sociology. In December, University Court met for the first time with around 500 members. Six months later, work started on the Lecture Theatre Building and the &#x27;Topping out&#x27; ceremony took place for Keynes tower.

In October 1966, the Hexagon Restaurant and General Store opened, with the number of students reaching 750. Lord Butler was installed as Chancellor at a ceremony held in Colchester&#x27;s Moot Hall in 1967 and the first Honorary Degrees were presented, the university&#x27;s mace was carried for the first time, while the first annual Degree Congregation saw 135 degrees conferred in July. At the start of the next academic year, the departments of Computer Science and Electronic Systems Engineering accepted their first students, the SSRC Data Bank (later renamed the UK Data Archive) was established and the Lecture Theatre Building and Library opened along with the first phase of the Social and Comparative Studies building, while work proceeded on Tawney and William Morris residential towers.

===The Protests of 1968===
Amid the worldwide escalation of social conflicts and protests against the Vietnam War, the University of Essex was at the vanguard of the 1960s student uproar. In March 1968, a demonstration against the visitation of the then Shadow Secretary State for Defence, Enoch Powell, received national publicity whereby seven students were summoned to disciplinary hearings to which was ultimately prevented by student sit-ins.

On Tuesday, 7 May 1968, Dr Thomas Inch from Porton Down paid a visit to host a lecture at the university. In a carefully planned demonstration, an indictment was read as Dr Inch began to speak citing chemical and biological warfare activities at Porton Down. Police intervention upon the call of the university was superseded by an insurmountable number of students who managed to prevent arrests.

On Friday, 10 May 1968, three students; Pete Archard, Raphael Halberstadt and David Triesman (now The Lord Triesman) were suspended and ordered off the campus. No evidence or charges were notified to the students, and no opportunity was given for the students to present their defence.

The university&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Wyvern&quot;, reported that on Monday, 13 May, &quot;Students picket all entrances to the university from early morning distributing leaflets calling all students and staff to meeting to discuss suspension of the three students. A huge meeting attended by nearly all the university population, voted overwhelmingly to refuse to participate in the university – in its place a Free University was declared &quot;. After a week the three students were reinstated.

Many Essex students joined protests in Paris over the summer of 1968 and unrest on the Colchester campus continued into 1969.

===The 1970s and 80s===
Within the frame of the 1970s to the 1980s, the university expanded by installing a health care centre, day nursery, bookstore, exhibition gallery and constructed new student residences. The School of Law, Human Rights centre, Department of Philosophy and the Department of Biological Sciences were opened.

In the late 1970s to the early 80s, the university began concentrating its teaching into large departments. Cooperation with local companies were forged allowing the university to secure vital research contracts. Due to its growing international reputation, the university began to attract a sizable number of International students.

In 1987, Martin Harris was appointed Vice-Chancellor, succeeding the founding Vice-Chancellor, Albert Sloman. Within the same year, University of Essex alumnus Oscar Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize.

===The 1990s===
Entering the 1990s, the university extended further by building more residential space in the face of the increase in student population between 1991 and 1992. The Rab Butler Building was opened in 1991 as the headquarters for the British Household Panel Survey. On the 30th anniversary in 1993, the university had built itself up into 17 key departments, providing education and research opportunities for 5,500 students, and employing 1,300 staff and faculty. The university also contained 5 industrial units and housed the Economic and Social Research Council-funded UK Data Archive. Further expansion continued to take place after 1993, with the £5.5 million expansion scheme for the provision of 234 new apartments for 1,200 students in a new student village.

===The 2000s===
Between 2003 and 2004, the university continued to expand. University Quays, a student accommodation complex housing 770 students, opened in September 2003 and within the campus at the Network Centre building opened in May 2004 housing the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering and parts of the Department of Computer Science (which merged in 2007 to create the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering). In 2003 a new satellite campus was opened at Princess Caroline House in Southend-on-Sea.

The Ivor Crewe Lecture Hall, one of the largest lecture theatres in the country hosting a 1,000-seat capacity, opened in 2006. The building was designed by multi-award-winning architect Patel Taylor and attracted a mixed response; Prince Charles referred to it as &#x27;like a dustbin&#x27; whilst the Civic Trust, a charity of which he is patron, awarded it a Civic Trust award (2008) for making &#x27;an outstanding contribution to the quality and appearance of the environment&#x27;. The building was named after Sir Ivor Crewe in April 2007 to mark his retirement from the position of vice chancellor, a position he chaired since 1995.

The Gateway Building at the Southend Campus opened in January 2007 providing facilities for Essex Business School, East 15 Acting School and the School of Health and Social Care plus a business incubation centre. The university also converted a former church into the Clifftown Studios to provide East 15 students with a theatre, studios and workshop spaces, and thus, the university has a theatre at each of its three campuses.

The Social Science Research Centre was completed in February 2007 housing the Institute for Social and Economic Research and the UK Data Archive. Through a unique collaboration with the University of East Anglia, Essex founded the University of Suffolk in 2007. A new building for the health and human sciences opened in 2008, now named the Kimmy Eldridge Building in honour of Kimmy Eldridge who joined the university in 1994 to establish the Nursing and Health Studies Unit, now part of the School of Health and Social Care. The Centre for Brain Science opened in 2009 providing a new home for the Department of Psychology.

=== 2010 to present ===


Essex Business School opened in 2015, the UK&#x27;s first zero-carbon business school building, intended as a symbolic gesture to sustainable and ethical business practices. It houses a winter garden giving the building its own micro-climate and a rainwater pond recycling water to cool the building. The building includes an operating trading floor with Bloomberg terminals offering direct use of Bloomberg market data and information. The building won the RICS Design through Innovation Award for the East of England.

Extensions to the Silberrad Student Centre and Albert Sloman Library were made in 2015 which received RIBA&#x27;s Regional Building of the Year Award 2016 plus a national RIBA award.

The Forum Southend-on-Sea opened in 2013 and was a joint project between Essex, Southend-on-Sea Borough Council and South Essex College and became a runner-up in the &#x27;Buildings that Inspire&#x27; category of The Guardian University Awards in 2015.

In 2018, a STEM Centre opened to conglomerate the university&#x27;s science departments and The Copse student accommodation opened offering 643 new single ensuite rooms and studios. In 2019, the Innovation Centre, Knowledge Gateway opened offering space for more than 50 start-up technology businesses.

In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II conferred upon the university the Regius Professorship, recognising &quot;50 years of excellence in research and education in political science at Essex&quot;. The first Regius professor was David Sanders of the Government Department, who held the post from 20142017. Since December 2017, Kristian Skrede Gleditsch was appointed as the second Regius Professor.

In March 2019, Essex joined seven other universities across European to form the Young Universities for the Future of Europe (YUFE) Alliance. Later in June 2019, the European Commission announced YUFE to be one of 17 projects that will receive funding for a three-year pilot under the European Universities Initiative funded by the Erasmus+ programme. The objective of the programme is to create &#x27;European Universities&#x27; based on cross-border alliances of higher education institutions that share a common long-term strategy in the promotion of European values and identity.

==Colchester campus and architecture==

Wivenhoe Park, the home of the primary campus, was painted by landscape painter John Constable in 1816. The park houses the main 1960s buildings along with Wivenhoe House, an 18th-century mansion that also features in Constable&#x27;s painting. Wivenhoe House hotel was closed in December 2010 for major refurbishment and reopened in 2012 as a combined four-star country house hotel and hotel school. The Edge Hotel School was originally a partnership between the university and the Edge Foundation and is now a department of the university. It is the UK&#x27;s first working hotel school dedicated to the development of future leaders of the hotel, events and hospitality industry.

With its concrete architecture, the university is typical of England&#x27;s 1960s universities and was heavily influenced by the international Brutalist architecture movement. Due to its particular form of architecture involving the use of prefabricated concrete and glass, the university is also referred to as a plateglass university.

The architect of the campus, Kenneth Capon of the Architects&#x27; Co-Partnership, took the Tuscan town of San Gimignano with its squares and towers as an inspiration (the university has six residential towers mainly for undergraduates, but the original plan was to build 29).

The landmark buildings include the residential towers, The Hexagon and the Albert Sloman library – which was selected as an &#x27;icon of British design&#x27; by the Victoria and Albert Museum in its 2012 exhibition British Design 1948–2012. The library has one of the few still operating continuous-loop paternoster lifts in the country.
An exhibition called &quot;Something Fierce&quot; was created in The Hexagon to celebrate the university&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2014, reflecting on the university&#x27;s founding vision and its relationship with its architecture. The exhibition was curated by art historian Jules Lubbock and director of the university&#x27;s Art Exchange gallery. The university&#x27;s original buildings were also featured in the Futures Found exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in 2017 which reflected on post-war architecture in the UK.

The Silberrad Student Centre and extension of the Albert Sloman Library completed in 2015 were designed to reflect the Brutalist architecture of the original campus buildings. The project was named RIBA Regional Building of the Year Award in 2016.
Essex Business School also opened in 2015 and won the Design through Innovation category at the RICS Awards 2016 for the East of England.

== Controversies and criticisms ==
=== Academic and Professional Integrity ===
In her article &quot;Diary: Why I Quit&quot; in the London Review of Books, the novelist and the chair of judges for the 2015 Man Booker International Prize, Dame Marina Warner, compared the University of Essex to &quot;the world of Chinese communist corporatism where enforcers rush to carry out the latest orders from their chiefs in an ecstasy of obedience to ideological principles which they do not seem to have examined, let alone discussed with the people they order to follow them, whom they cashier when they won’t knuckle under&quot;. Further critique in the article &quot;The Strange Death of the Liberal University&quot;, Michael Bailey describes the university as a place that promotes &quot;divisive competition, false economies and philistine instrumentality&quot;.

In 2021, following the Reindorf Review, the university was obliged to apologise to Professor Rosa Freedman and Professor Jo Phoenix after their invitation was withdrawn to speak. The Vice-Chancellor Professor Anthony Forster said: &quot;The report makes clear that we have made serious mistakes and we need to do our very best to learn from these and to ensure they are not repeated. The review notes the particular responsibility placed on universities to protect freedom of speech within the law, and to ensure that a diversity of voices and views can be heard on our campuses. On behalf of the university, I have issued an open apology to each of Professor Phoenix and Professor Freedman&quot;.

=== Anti-semitism and allegations of racial profiling ===
In February 2019, the university was involved in an anti-semitism controversy; a number of students voted against the establishment of the Jewish student society. Staff member Dr Maaruf Ali was dismissed due to posting holocaust denial images on social media.

In October 2021, the university received some criticism as anti-semitic chants were made by protestors outside a talk by Richard Kemp on the Colchester campus.

In January 2021, a black student was allegedly racially profiled by security staff which resulted in the student being confronted by armed police officers. The student was quoted as saying: &quot;Their description of the suspected individual was black, six-feet tall, athletic build, with dreadlocked hair. Being threatened with guns on the campus where my safety is supposed to be provided for is troubling and concerning. How are black students supposed to be safe from racial discrimination and fear of potential death when their biggest threat are those that are supposed to protect them? My hair is far from dreadlocks – and I&#x27;m not that tall.&quot;

Essex has been criticised for a lack of commitment towards sensitive issues except when it is perceived to be in the interest of its public image. The universities public denouncement of the George Floyd incident was cited as a notable example of the institution taking a stand on social media and then refusing to follow through with their commitment to solidarity when students continued to express concerns on being racially profiled by staff.

<text>Adipocere (), also known as corpse wax, grave wax or mortuary wax, is a wax-like organic substance formed by the anaerobic bacterial hydrolysis of fat in tissue, such as body fat in corpses. In its formation, putrefaction is replaced by a permanent firm cast of fatty tissues, internal organs, and the face.

==History==
Adipocere was first described by Sir Thomas Browne in his discourse &quot;Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial&quot; (1658):

The chemical process of adipocere formation, saponification, came to be understood in the 17th century when microscopes became widely available.

In 1825, physician and lecturer Augustus Granville is believed to have (somewhat unwittingly) made candles from the adipocere of a mummy and used them to light the public lecture he gave to report on the mummy&#x27;s dissection. Granville apparently thought that the waxy material from which he made the candles had been used to preserve the mummy, rather than its being a product of the saponification of the mummified body.

The body of the &quot;Soap Lady&quot;, whose corpse turned into adipocere, is displayed in the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Probably the most famous known case of adipocere is that of Scotland&#x27;s Higgins brothers, murdered by their father in 1911 but whose bodies were not found until 1913. The bodies had been left floating in a flooded quarry, resulting in an almost complete transformation into adipocere. Pathologists Sydney Smith and Professor Littlejohn were able to find more than enough evidence from the preserved remains for police to identify the victims and charge the killer, who was hanged. At the same time, the pathologists secretly took some of the remains back to Edinburgh University for further study; nearly a century later, a relative requested the return of those remains so they could be given a Christian burial. The university agreed to do so if the claimant could prove her relationship to the boys and if other relatives agreed to her plan, and the remains were eventually cremated in 2009.

==Appearance==
Adipocere is a crumbly, waxy, water-insoluble material consisting mostly of saturated fatty acids. Depending on whether it was formed from white or brown body fat, adipocere is either grayish white or tan in color.

In spite of its etymology, Latin (&quot;fat&quot;) and (&quot;wax&quot;), it is neither fat nor wax.

In corpses, the firm cast of adipocere allows some estimation of body shape and facial features, and injuries are often well-preserved.

==Formation==
Adipocere is formed by the anaerobic bacterial hydrolysis of fat in tissue. The transformation of fats into adipocere occurs best in an environment that has high levels of moisture and an absence of oxygen, such as in wet ground or mud at the bottom of a lake or a sealed casket, and it can occur with both embalmed and untreated bodies. Adipocere formation begins within a month of death, and, in the absence of air, it can persist for centuries. Adipocerous formation preserved the left hemisphere of the brain of a 13th-century infant such that sulci, gyri, and even Nissl bodies in the motor cortex could be distinguished in the 20th century. An exposed, insect-infested body or a body in a warm environment is unlikely to form deposits of adipocere.

Corpses of women, infants and overweight persons are particularly prone to adipocere transformation because they contain more body fat. In forensic science, the utility of adipocere formation to estimate the postmortem interval is limited because the speed of the process is temperature-dependent. It is accelerated by warmth, but temperature extremes impede it.

The degradation of adipocere continues after exhumation at the microscopic level resulting from the combination of exposure to air, handling, dissection and the enzymatic activity of microbiota.

<text>Mahavira Janma Kalyanaka is one of the most important religious festivals in Jainism. It celebrates the birth of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth and last Tīrthaṅkara (supreme preacher) of present Avasarpiṇī. On the Gregorian calendar, the festivity occurs either in March or April.

==Birth==

According to Jain texts, Mahavira was born on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the moon in the month of &quot;Chaitra&quot; in the year 599 BCE (Chaitra Sud 13). According to Shvetambara tradition, he was born in Kshatriyakund of Bihar. Some modern historians consider Kundagram (which is today&#x27;s Kundalpur in Muzaffarpur district of Bihar) as his birthplace. He was born in a democratic kingdom (Ganarajya), Vajji, where the king was chosen by votes. Vaishali was its capital. He was named Vardhamana, meaning &quot;One who grows&quot;, because of the increased prosperity in the kingdom at the time of his birth. In Vasokund, Mahavira is revered by the villagers. A place called &quot;Ahalya bhumi&quot; has not been ploughed for hundreds of years by the family that owns it, as it is considered to be the birthplace of Mahavira.

===Legend===
Mahavira was born into Jnatra clan of the Ikshvaku dynasty as the son of King Siddhartha of Kundagrama and Queen Trishala. During her pregnancy, Trishala was believed to have 14 auspicious dreams, all signifying the coming of a great soul. Shwetamber Sect of Jainism believes that the mother saw 14 and Digambara sect believes mother saw sixteen dreams which were interpreted by the King Siddhartha. It is said that when Queen Trishala gave birth to Mahavira, Indra, the head of heavenly beings (&quot;devas&quot;) performed a ritual called &quot;abhisheka on Sumeru Parvat&quot;, this being the second of five auspicious events (&quot;Panch Kalyanakas&quot;), said to occur in the life of all &quot;Tirthankaras&quot;.

==Celebrations==
The idol of Mahavira is carried out on a chariot, in a procession called &quot;rath yatra&quot;. On the way stavans (religious rhymes) are recited. Statues of Mahavira are given a ceremonial anointment called the &quot;abhisheka&quot;. During the day, most members of the Jain community engage in some sort of charitable act, prayers, pujas, and vratas. Many devotees visit temples dedicated to Mahavira to meditate and offer prayers. Lectures by monks and nuns are held in temples to preach the path of virtue as defined by Jainism. Donations are collected in order to promote charitable missions like saving cows from slaughter or helping to feed poor people. Ancient Jain temples across India typically see an extremely high volume of practitioners come to pay their respects and join in the celebrations. Ahimsa runs and rallies preaching Mahavira&#x27;s message of Ahiṃsā (non-violence) are taken out on this day.

<doc id="331824" wikidata="Q208722" url="?curid=331824" title="Wrasse">
<text>The wrasses are a family, Labridae, of marine ray-finned fish, many of which are brightly colored. The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 81 genera, which are divided into nine subgroups or tribes.

They are typically small, most of them less than long, although the largest, the humphead wrasse, can measure up to . They are efficient carnivores, feeding on a wide range of small invertebrates. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing. Juveniles of some representatives of the genera &quot;Bodianus&quot;, &quot;Epibulus&quot;, &quot;Cirrhilabrus&quot;, &quot;Oxycheilinus&quot;, and &quot;Paracheilinus&quot; hide among the tentacles of the free-living mushroom corals and &quot;Heliofungia actiniformis&quot;.
==Etymology==
The word &quot;wrasse&quot; comes from the Cornish word &quot;wragh&quot;, a lenited form of &quot;gwragh&quot;, meaning an old woman or hag, via Cornish dialect &quot;wrath&quot;. It is related to the Welsh &quot;gwrach&quot; and Breton &quot;gwrac&#x27;h&quot;.
== Taxonomy ==
Parrotfish were traditionally regarded as comprising their own family (Scaridae), but are now often treated as a subfamily (Scarinae) or tribe (Scarini) of the wrasses (Labridae), being nested deep within the wrasse phylogenetic tree. The odacine wrasses, traditionally classified as forming their own family, were found nested deep within the wrasse tribe Hypsigenyini, and most closely related to the tuskfishes.

== Genera ==
==Description==
Wrasses have protractile mouths, usually with separate jaw teeth that jut outwards. Many species can be readily recognized by their thick lips, the inside of which is sometimes curiously folded, a peculiarity which gave rise to the German name of &quot;lip-fishes&quot; (&quot;Lippfische&quot;), and the Dutch name of &quot;lipvissen&quot;. The dorsal fin has eight to 21 spines and six to 21 soft rays, usually running most of the length of the back. Wrasses are sexually dimorphic. Many species are capable of changing sex. Juveniles are a mix of males and females (known as initial-phase individuals), but the largest adults become territory-holding (terminal-phase) males.

The wrasses have become a primary study species in fish-feeding biomechanics due to their jaw structures. The nasal and mandibular bones are connected at their posterior ends to the rigid neurocranium, and the superior and inferior articulations of the maxilla are joined to the anterior tips of these two bones, respectively, creating a loop of four rigid bones connected by moving joints. This &quot;four-bar linkage&quot; has the property of allowing numerous arrangements to achieve a given mechanical result (fast jaw protrusion or a forceful bite), thus decoupling morphology from function. The actual morphology of wrasses reflects this, with many lineages displaying different jaw morphology that results in the same functional output in a similar or identical ecological niche.

==Distribution and habitat==
Most wrasses inhabit the tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, though some species live in temperate waters: the Ballan wrasse is found as far north as Norway. Wrasses are usually found in shallow-water habitats such as coral reefs and rocky shores, where they live close to the substrate.

==Reproductive behavior==

Most labrids are protogynous hermaphrodites within a haremic mating system. A good example of this reproductive behavior is seen in the California sheephead. Hermaphroditism allows for complex mating systems. Labroids exhibit three different mating systems: polygynous, lek-like, and promiscuous. Group spawning and pair spawning occur within mating systems. The type of spawning that occurs depends on male body size. Labroids typically exhibit broadcast spawning, releasing high numbers of planktonic eggs, which are broadcast by tidal currents; adult labroids have no interaction with offspring. Wrasses of a particular subgroup of the family Labridae, Labrini, do not exhibit broadcast spawning.

Sex change in wrasses is generally female-to-male, but experimental conditions have allowed for male-to-female sex change. Placing two male &quot;Labroides dimidiatus&quot; wrasses in the same tank results in the smaller of the two becoming female again. Additionally, while the individual to change sex is generally the largest female, evidence also exists of the largest female instead &quot;choosing&quot; to remain female in situations in which she can maximize her evolutionary fitness by refraining from changing sex.

===Broodcare behavior of the tribe===
The subgroup Labrini arose from a basal split within family Labridae during the Eocene period. Subgroup Labrini is composed of eight genera, wherein 15 of 23 species exhibit broodcare behavior, which ranges from simple to complex parental care of spawn; males build algae nests or crude cavities, ventilate eggs, and defend nests against conspecific males and predators. In species that express this behavior, eggs cannot survive without parental care. Species of &quot;Symphodus, Centrolabrus&quot;, and &quot;Labrus&quot; genera exhibit broodcare behavior.

== Sexual developmental systems ==
Wrasses exhibit three types of sexual development, depending on the species. Sex in this context refers to functional sex, ie the individual&#x27;s role when mating. Some species show functional gonochorism, meaning that they are born functionally either male or female, and remain so for their entire life; there is no sex change. Meanwhile, functionally hermaphoditic species exhibit sex change, and are protogynous, meaning that individuals that are functionally female can become functionally male. These protogynous species are either monandric (all individuals are born functionally female, but can become functionally male) or diandric (individuals can be born either female or male, and individuals that are born female can become male).

Evolutionarily, wrasse lineages trend towards developing monandry. Monandric lineages rarely transition directly to diandry, instead transitioning through functional gonochorism first on the pathway to diandry.

== Potential tool use ==
Many species of wrasses have been recorded using large rocks or hard coral as &quot;anvils&quot;, upon which they smash open hard-shelled prey items. At least some of these species can remember to use a particular rock or coral repeatedly for this purpose. This behaviour usually involves invertebrate prey such as clams, sea urchins, and crabs, but on one occasion, a blue tuskfish was filmed smashing a young green sea turtle on an anvil.

21 species of 8 genera have been documented exhibiting this behaviour, including &quot;Choerodon&quot; (&quot;C. anchorago&quot;, &quot;C. cyanodus&quot;, &quot;C. graphicus&quot;, &quot;C. schoenleinii&quot;), &quot;Coris&quot; (&quot;C. aygula&quot;, &quot;C. bulbifrons&quot;, &quot;C. julis&quot;, &quot;C. sandeyeri&quot;), &quot;Cheilinus&quot; (&quot;C. fasciatus&quot;, &quot;C. lunulatus&quot;, &quot;C. trilobatus&quot;), &quot;Thalassoma&quot; (&quot;T. hardwicke&quot;, &quot;T. jansenii&quot;, &quot;T. lunare&quot;, &quot;T. lutescens&quot;, &quot;T. pavo&quot;), &quot;Symphodus&quot; (&quot;S. mediterraneus&quot;), &quot;Halichoeres&quot; (&quot;H. garnoti&quot;, &quot;H. hortulanus&quot;), &quot;Bodianus&quot; (&quot;B. pulcher&quot;), and &quot;Pseudolabrus&quot; (&quot;P. luculentus&quot;).

==Cleaner wrasse==

Cleaner wrasses are the best-known of the cleaner fish. They live in a cleaning symbiosis with larger, often predatory, fish, grooming them and benefiting by consuming what they remove. &quot;Client&quot; fish congregate at wrasse &quot;cleaning stations&quot; and wait for the cleaner fish to remove gnathiid parasites, the cleaners even swimming into their open mouths and gill cavities to do so.

Cleaner wrasses are best known for feeding on dead tissue, scales, and ectoparasites, although they are also known to &#x27;cheat&#x27;, consuming healthy tissue and mucus, which is energetically costly for the client fish to produce. The bluestreak cleaner wrasse, &quot;Labroides dimidiatus&quot;, is one of the most common cleaners found on tropical reefs. Few cleaner wrasses have been observed being eaten by predators, possibly because parasite removal is more important for predator survival than the short-term gain of eating the cleaner.

In a 2019 study, cleaner wrasses passed the mirror test, the first fish to do so. However, the test&#x27;s inventor, American psychologist Gordon G. Gallup, has said that the fish were most likely trying to scrape off a perceived parasite on another fish and that they did not demonstrate self-recognition. The authors of the study retorted that because the fish checked themselves in the mirror before and after the scraping, this meant that the fish had self-awareness and recognized that their reflections belonged to their own bodies. In a 2024 study, &quot;mirror-naive&quot; bluestreak cleaner wrasse were reported to initially show aggression to wrasse photographs sized 10% larger or 10% smaller than themselves, regardless of size. However, upon viewing their reflections in a mirror, they avoided confronting photographs 10% larger than they were.

==Significance to humans==
In the Western Atlantic coastal region of North America, the most common food species for indigenous humans was the tautog, a species of wrasse. Wrasses today are commonly found in both public and home aquaria. Some species are small enough to be considered reef safe. They may also be employed as cleaner fish to combat sea-lice infestations in salmon farms. Commercial fish farming of cleaner wrasse for sea-lice pest control in commercial salmon farming has developed in Scotland as lice busters, with apparent commercial benefit and viability.

==Parasites==
As all fish, labrids are the hosts of a number of parasites. A list of 338 parasite taxa from 127 labrid fish species was provided by Muñoz and Diaz in 2015. An example is the nematode &quot;Huffmanela ossicola&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, the prime-counting function is the function counting the number of prime numbers less than or equal to some real number . It is denoted by (unrelated to the number).

A symmetric variant seen sometimes is , which is equal to if is exactly a prime number, and equal to otherwise. That is, the number of prime numbers less than , plus half if equals a prime.

==Growth rate==

Of great interest in number theory is the growth rate of the prime-counting function. It was conjectured in the end of the 18th century by Gauss and by Legendre to be approximately
formula_1
where is the natural logarithm, in the sense that
formula_2
This statement is the prime number theorem. An equivalent statement is
formula_3
where is the logarithmic integral function. The prime number theorem was first proved in 1896 by Jacques Hadamard and by Charles de la Vallée Poussin independently, using properties of the Riemann zeta function introduced by Riemann in 1859. Proofs of the prime number theorem not using the zeta function or complex analysis were found around 1948 by Atle Selberg and by Paul Erdős (for the most part independently).

===More precise estimates===
In 1899, de la Vallée Poussin proved that

formula_4
for some positive constant . Here, is the big notation.

More precise estimates of are now known. For example, in 2002, Kevin Ford proved that
formula_5

Mossinghoff and Trudgian proved an explicit upper bound for the difference between and :
formula_6

For values of that are not unreasonably large, is greater than . However, is known to change sign infinitely many times. For a discussion of this, see Skewes&#x27; number.

===Exact form===

For let when is a prime number, and otherwise. Bernhard Riemann, in his work &quot;On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude&quot;, proved that is equal to
formula_7
where
formula_8
 is the Möbius function, is the logarithmic integral function, indexes every zero of the Riemann zeta function, and is not evaluated with a branch cut but instead considered as where is the exponential integral. If the trivial zeros are collected and the sum is taken &quot;only&quot; over the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, then may be approximated by
formula_9

The Riemann hypothesis suggests that every such non-trivial zero lies along .

==Table of , , and ==

The table shows how the three functions , , and compared at powers of 10. See also, and

In the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, the column is sequence , is sequence , and is sequence .

The value for was originally computed by J. Buethe, J. Franke, A. Jost, and T. Kleinjung assuming the Riemann hypothesis.
It was later verified unconditionally in a computation by D. J. Platt.
The value for is by the same four authors. 
The value for was computed by D. B. Staple. All other prior entries in this table were also verified as part of that work.

The values for 1027, 1028, and 1029 were announced by David Baugh and Kim Walisch in 2015, 2020, and 2022, respectively.

== Algorithms for evaluating ==

A simple way to find , if is not too large, is to use the sieve of Eratosthenes to produce the primes less than or equal to and then to count them.

A more elaborate way of finding is due to Legendre (using the inclusion–exclusion principle): given , if are distinct prime numbers, then the number of integers less than or equal to which are divisible by no is

:formula_10

(where denotes the floor function). This number is therefore equal to

:formula_11

when the numbers are the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of .

=== The Meissel–Lehmer algorithm ===

In a series of articles published between 1870 and 1885, Ernst Meissel described (and used) a practical combinatorial way of evaluating : Let be the first primes and denote by the number of natural numbers not greater than which are divisible by none of the for any . Then

: formula_12

Given a natural number , if and if , then

:formula_13

Using this approach, Meissel computed , for equal to , 106, 107, and 108.

In 1959, Derrick Henry Lehmer extended and simplified Meissel&#x27;s method. Define, for real and for natural numbers and , as the number of numbers not greater than with exactly prime factors, all greater than . Furthermore, set . Then

:formula_14

where the sum actually has only finitely many nonzero terms. Let denote an integer such that , and set . Then and when . Therefore,

:formula_15

The computation of can be obtained this way:

:formula_16

where the sum is over prime numbers.

On the other hand, the computation of can be done using the following rules:

#formula_17
#formula_18

Using his method and an IBM 701, Lehmer was able to compute the correct value of and missed the correct value of by 1.

Further improvements to this method were made by Lagarias, Miller, Odlyzko, Deléglise, and Rivat.

==Other prime-counting functions==

Other prime-counting functions are also used because they are more convenient to work with.

===Riemann&#x27;s prime-power counting function===
Riemann&#x27;s prime-power counting function is usually denoted as or . It has jumps of at prime powers and it takes a value halfway between the two sides at the discontinuities of . That added detail is used because the function may then be defined by an inverse Mellin transform.

Formally, we may define by
:formula_19
where the variable in each sum ranges over all primes within the specified limits.

We may also write
:formula_20
where is the von Mangoldt function and

:formula_21

The Möbius inversion formula then gives
:formula_22
where is the Möbius function.

Knowing the relationship between the logarithm of the Riemann zeta function and the von Mangoldt function , and using the Perron formula we have
:formula_23

=== Chebyshev&#x27;s function ===
The Chebyshev function weights primes or prime powers by :

:formula_24

For ,
:formula_25
and
:formula_26

==Formulas for prime-counting functions==

Formulas for prime-counting functions come in two kinds: arithmetic formulas and analytic formulas. Analytic formulas for prime-counting were the first used to prove the prime number theorem. They stem from the work of Riemann and von Mangoldt, and are generally known as explicit formulae.

We have the following expression for the second Chebyshev function :

:formula_27

where

: formula_28

Here are the zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the critical strip, where the real part of is between zero and one. The formula is valid for values of greater than one, which is the region of interest. The sum over the roots is conditionally convergent, and should be taken in order of increasing absolute value of the imaginary part. Note that the same sum over the trivial roots gives the last subtrahend in the formula.

For we have a more complicated formula

:formula_29

Again, the formula is valid for , while are the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function ordered according to their absolute value. The first term is the usual logarithmic integral function; the expression in the second term should be considered as , where is the analytic continuation of the exponential integral function from negative reals to the complex plane with branch cut along the positive reals. The final integral is equal to the series over the trivial zeros:

:formula_30

Thus, Möbius inversion formula gives us

:formula_31

valid for , where

:formula_32

is Riemann&#x27;s R-function and is the Möbius function. The latter series for it is known as Gram series. Because for all , this series converges for all positive by comparison with the series for . The logarithm in the Gram series of the sum over the non-trivial zero contribution should be evaluated as and not .

Folkmar Bornemann proved, when assuming the conjecture that all zeros of the Riemann zeta function are simple, that
:formula_33
where runs over the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function and .

The sum over non-trivial zeta zeros in the formula for describes the fluctuations of while the remaining terms give the &quot;smooth&quot; part of prime-counting function, so one can use

:formula_34

as a good estimator of for . In fact, since the second term approaches 0 as , while the amplitude of the &quot;noisy&quot; part is heuristically about , estimating by alone is just as good, and fluctuations of the distribution of primes may be clearly represented with the function

:formula_35

==Inequalities==
Ramanujan proved that the inequality
:formula_36
holds for all sufficiently large values of .

Here are some useful inequalities for .

:formula_37

The left inequality holds for and the right inequality holds for . The constant is to 5 decimal places, as has its maximum value at .

Pierre Dusart proved in 2010:

:formula_38

More recently, Dusart has proved
(Theorem 5.1) that
:formula_39
for and , respectively.

Going in the other direction, an approximation for the th prime, , is
:formula_40

Here are some inequalities for the th prime. The lower bound is due to Dusart (1999) and the upper bound to Rosser (1941).

:formula_41

The left inequality holds for and the right inequality holds for . A variant form sometimes seen substitutes formula_42 An even simpler lower bound is
:formula_43
which holds for all , but the lower bound above is tighter for .

In 2010 Dusart proved (Propositions 6.7 and 6.6) that
:formula_44
for and , respectively.

In 2024, Axler further tightened this (equations 1.12 and 1.13) using bounds of the form
:formula_45
proving that
:formula_46
for and , respectively.
The lower bound may also be simplified to without altering its validity. The upper bound may be tightened to if .

There are additional bounds of varying complexity.

==The Riemann hypothesis==

The Riemann hypothesis implies a much tighter bound on the error in the estimate for , and hence to a more regular distribution of prime numbers,

:formula_47
Specifically,

:formula_48

 proved that the Riemann hypothesis implies that for all there is a prime satisfying
:formula_49

<text>John Westerdale Bowker (born 30 July 1935) is an English Anglican priest and pioneering scholar of religious studies. A former director of studies and dean of chapel at Corpus Christi and Trinity College, Cambridge he is credited with introducing religious studies as a discipline to Cambridge University. He has been a Professor of religious studies at the universities of Cambridge, Lancaster, Pennsylvania and North Carolina State University. He is an Honorary Canon of Canterbury Cathedral, a consultant for UNESCO, a BBC broadcaster and author and editor of numerous books.

==Life==
Bowker was educated at St John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead, Worcester College, Oxford and Ripon Hall, Oxford. He undertook his national service with the RWAFF in northern Nigeria and then became the Henry Stevenson Fellow at the University of Sheffield in 1961. He then moved to the University of Cambridge where he was Dean of Chapel of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (1962) and Assistant Lecturer (1965) and Lecturer (1970). In 1974 he was appointed Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Lancaster, and in 1984 moved back to Cambridge as Dean of Chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge (1984–91) and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge (1984–93), also teaching, supervising and researching at the University. From 1992 to 1997 he was Gresham professor of Divinity at Gresham College, London.

He was appointed adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania and at North Carolina State University in 1986.

He gave many invited lectures including the Wilde (University of Oxford), Riddell Newcastle University, Boutwood University of Cambridge, Scott Holland University of London, Bicentenary Georgetown University.

He served on various commissions including the Archbishops&#x27; Commission on Doctrine (1977–86). He was appointed Vice-President of the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science in 1980.

==Academic work==
Bowker has written and edited many books on world religions. He has also taken a deep interest in science and religion and in particular the relationship of biology and psychology to religion.

In 1983 he edited &quot;Violence and Aggression&quot; and 1987 he wrote &quot;Licensed Insanities: religions and belief in God in the contemporary world&quot;

In 1992 and 1993 he gave lectures at Gresham College analysing in detail the claim by Richard Dawkins that belief in God was a kind of mental virus. In the scientific parts he collaborated with Quinton Deeley, a student of his whose dissertation on biogenetic structuralism led to his deciding to re-train as a doctor and is now a published psychiatrist. He suggests that this &quot;account of religious motivation...is...far removed from evidence and data.&quot; and that, even if the God-meme approach were valid, &quot;it does not give rise to one set of consequences... Out of the many behaviours it produces, why are we required to isolate only those that might be regarded as diseased? And who ... decides, and on what grounds, what is diseased? ... there is nothing here as objective as the observation of chicken-pox... the observer...is highly relative&quot;.

In his 2005 book &quot;The Sacred Neuron: The Extraordinary New Discoveries Linking Science and Religion&quot; he suggests that it is incorrect to view faith and reason as opposing functions. He argues that recent discoveries in the neurosciences are revealing startling facts about the workings of the human mind and how certain ideas are processed into beliefs. His publishers assert that &quot;John Bowker shows that faith and belief are not separate or distinct from reason, but are actually rooted in it. And science—especially neurophysiology—is the key to unlocking how we think about God, about the relationship between different cultures and religions, and about the processes of the human mind that influence our behavior. When rationality and faith are viewed as complementary a new understanding of the human mind can serve as a basis for resolving conflicts between religions and cultures. This discovery has stunning implications for the world.&quot;

<doc id="331842" wikidata="Q335178" url="?curid=331842" title="John Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun">
<text>John Adrian Louis Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow, 7th Earl of Hopetoun, (25 September 1860 – 29 February 1908) was a British aristocrat and statesman who served as the first governor-general of Australia, in office from 1901 to 1902. He was previously Governor of Victoria from 1889 to 1895.

Hopetoun was born into the Scottish nobility, and succeeded his father as Earl of Hopetoun at the age of 12. He attended Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, but opted not to pursue a full-time military career. Hopetoun sat with the Conservative Party in the House of Lords, and became a Lord-in-waiting in 1885 and Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1887. He was appointed Governor of Victoria at the age of 29, and had a successful tenure in a time of political and economic instability.

After returning to England in 1895, Hopetoun served in Lord Salisbury&#x27;s cabinet as Paymaster General and Lord Chamberlain. The announcement of his appointment to the new governorship-general in July 1900 was met with praise. However, he arrived in Australia ill-informed about the political aspects of federation, and his decision to call on William Lyne to form a caretaker government became known as the &quot;Hopetoun Blunder&quot;. Lyne, who had campaigned against federation, had little support from the political establishment, and Hopetoun was forced to turn to Edmund Barton to serve as Australia&#x27;s first prime minister. His relationship with Barton once in office was civil, although his interferences in political matters were not well received.

Hopetoun was popular with the general public, but developed a reputation for flamboyance and ostentation. The Cookatoo Inn in Surry Hills was revamped and renamed the Hopetoun Hotel in 1901 in his honour. His desire for a large expenses allowance was rebuffed by parliament, and he consequently relinquished office in July 1902. He was granted a marquessate upon his return to England, and thereafter withdrew from public life, except for a brief term as Secretary of State for Scotland in 1905. He died in France at the age of 47, after several years of ill health. Hopetoun&#x27;s term as governor-general is generally regarded as a failure, and his successors generally avoided emulating his extravagance. Only Lord Denman held the position at a younger age.

==Early life and career==
Hope was born at South Queensferry, West Lothian, Scotland, the eldest son of John Hope, 6th Earl of Hopetoun, and the former Ethelred Anne Birch-Reynardson. He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he passed out in 1879. However, he chose not to join the regular army upon graduation. He later explained &quot;the affairs of the family estate, to which I succeeded at 13, seemed to call for my personal attention&quot;. Subsequently, he devoted his attentions to managing the more than seventeen thousand hectares (42,500 acres) of family estate located around the Firth of Forth.

He married, in London on 18 October 1886, Hersey Alice Eveleigh-de Moleyns (formerly Mullins), a Scots-born Irish aristocrat (daughter of the 4th Baron Ventry) then aged 19. They had two sons and a daughter; a second daughter died in infancy. Their elder son, Victor, became Viceroy and Governor-General of India (1936–43), after having declined the governorship of Madras and the governor-generalship of Australia.

In 1883, Hopetoun became Conservative whip in the House of Lords and served as a Lord in Waiting to Queen Victoria from June 1885 to January 1886 and August 1886 to August 1889. From 1887 to 1889 he was also appointed Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

==Governor of Victoria==
In 1889 he was appointed Governor of Victoria (and additionally a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George), where he served until 1895. His appointment came amid a general stylistic change in colonial governors. Reflecting &quot;Britain&#x27;s more flamboyant pride in Empire, Australian colonial governors began to display a new colour and ostentation&quot;. Increased interest in Empire had spurred the appearance of young and wealthy aristocrats in place of previous career administrators.

Hopetoun&#x27;s time as Governor was in keeping with the newly emerging style. He rapidly developed a reputation for lavish entertaining and spectacular vice-regal galas. Notwithstanding poor health and colonial astonishment at his habit of wearing hair-powder, his youthful enthusiasm for routine duties and his fondness for informal horseback tours won him many friends.

Hopetoun&#x27;s term coincided with a number of serious difficulties being faced by the colonies. The economic boom in the colony was reversed by the Great Crash in 1891, leading to a decade of depression, bank failures, industrial action and political instability. In contrast to the troubles faced during this period by other colonial governors, Hopetoun by most accounts handled this period ably and subsequently stayed in office for longer than the usual term. However, the reality of the 1890s was that colonial governors had lost much of their administrative and political power, instead assuming more figurative and representative roles.

Hopetoun&#x27;s term also coincided with the important years of the federation movement in Victoria. The economic crash and resultant political and social problems laid bare the inefficiencies of the colonial system and sparked renewed interest in an Australian federation. Hopetoun was an active supporter of the movement, appearing at numerous banquets and giving speeches in its favour. At one such banquet he even offered to return to Australia as their first governor-general should Federation be implemented. Upon leaving the governorship and returning to the United Kingdom in 1895, Hopetoun was a widely popular figure in Victoria and New South Wales.

==Governor-General of Australia==
After his return to the United Kingdom he was made a privy councillor, was appointed Paymaster-General in the Salisbury government from 1895 to 1898, and then became Lord Chamberlain until 1900. 1900 also saw his appointment as a Knight of the Order of the Thistle and a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.

The Australian colonies had agreed to federate, to form the Commonwealth of Australia from 1 January 1901. Hopetoun&#x27;s popularity in Victoria and his friendship with leading Australian politicians made him an obvious choice to be the first Governor-General of Australia. In his submission to Queen Victoria in July 1900, Secretary of State for the Colonies Joseph Chamberlain described Hopetoun as &quot;exceptionally qualified to discharge the duties of this important position with ability and efficiency&quot; and stated that he would be &quot;heartily welcomed&quot; in Australia. His strong ties with the Queen and with the incumbent British administration were also important to appointers in London. His appointment was approved by the Queen on 14 July 1900 and on 29 October letters patent were issued constituting the office and his own instructions. Hopetoun arrived in Sydney on 15 December, via India, where he had caught typhoid fever and his wife malaria. Already in poor health during the preceding years in England, the trip further diminished Hopetoun&#x27;s capacities.

Intercolonial rivalries and traditional suspicions in Sydney of the excessive influence of Melbourne over national affairs were cause for some complex manoeuvres during Hopetoun&#x27;s arrival. Though he was initially intended to arrive via Melbourne, local politicians insisted that the incoming Governor-General should disembark in Perth before going on to Sydney. Illness and misadventure following the Indian leg of the journey disrupted Hopetoun&#x27;s tour and made the arduous arrival preparations difficult to complete. Lady Hopetoun had suffered a relapse of her condition during the trip across Australia, adding further to Hopetoun&#x27;s personal troubles.

===&quot;Hopetoun Blunder&quot;===

Hopetoun&#x27;s immediate task was to appoint a prime minister to form an interim government, which would take office on 1 January 1901. Since the first federal election was not scheduled to be held until March, he could not follow the usual convention of appointing the leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives. On 19 December 1900 Hopetoun chose to ask Sir William Lyne, the Premier of New South Wales, to form the first Commonwealth ministry. This caused great surprise amongst Australian and British politicians. In Australia, it had generally been assumed that Edmund Barton, a key leader of the Federation movement and drafter of the Constitution, would be offered the post in the first instance. The decision was defensible in terms of protocol, but it ignored the fact that Lyne had long strongly opposed federation until the passage of the referendums of 1899, and was unpopular with the leading federalist politicians. Explanations for the appointment generally revolve around the precedent established by Canada, whereby the Premier of the senior colony, John A. Macdonald of Ontario, had formed the first federal Canadian government. Also, Barton was not a member of any parliament (he had resigned from the NSW Parliament earlier that year), and, although he had considerable political experience, he was considered in some quarters to be politically inept. Lyne, on the other hand, was recognised as a tough and experienced politician.

However, it quickly became apparent that Lyne would not be able to form the first government. Alfred Deakin and other prominent politicians, particularly Victorian politicians, told Hopetoun they would not serve under Lyne. Lyne returned his commission on 24 December and Hopetoun sent for Edmund Barton, the leader of the federal movement and the man everybody believed was entitled to the post. Barton successfully assembled a cabinet, one that included Lyne, and it was sworn in by Hopetoun on the inauguration of the Commonwealth on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1901. That afternoon, Hopetoun and the new government assembled at Government House, Sydney for the first meeting of the Federal Executive Council.

Hopetoun, wary that his actions would constitute important precedents for the new nation, generally followed pre-existing Canadian and British conventions in discharging his constitutional duties. Hopetoun was well-acquainted with many members of the first government and built a strong personal relationship with Barton, placing him in a position of respect and influence with the new federal politicians. He consulted regularly with the Prime Minister and with George Reid, the effective leader of the opposition, in the lead up to the first federal election in March 1901.

===Conflict over the position===
More problems soon arose though in establishing the new machinery of government. Hopetoun had brought his own Official Secretary, Captain Edward William Wallington, who handled all his communications with London. Wallington was highly experienced in Australian colonial administration, having advised many governors previously and earning a reputation as an expert in managing communications and relations with the Colonial Office in London. However Australians resented an Englishman being in charge of official business, and the fact that Wallington had no responsibility to the new Commonwealth parliament despite his influential governmental position.

Other problems appeared with regard to the relationship between the new Governor-General and the continuing state governors. Disputes emerged between Hopetoun and several state governors—particularly South Australian governor Lord Tennyson, who would be Hopetoun&#x27;s successor—over the Governor-General&#x27;s right of access to dispatches and communiqués of the state governors. Questions of the independence of the states were raised and some fears of federal takeover of local affairs persisted during the disputes, until uneasy compromises were reached which saw some but not total subordination of state governors. Hopetoun continued to struggle to diminish pre-existing local parochial sentiments within the states, though his position within the Commonwealth was much better publicised and secured after his co-ordination and hosting of the Royal Visit in 1901. Tactful dealings with state governors and his strength at mediation helped secure that position in the early years of the Commonwealth as confidence in the new national entity was forged.

There was also resentment over the regal pomp upon which Hopetoun insisted in carrying out his role, and the expense which this entailed. Official visits to the states often incurred significant local expenses often not reimbursed by the Commonwealth, causing ructions in State-Federal relations until a resolution was reached in 1905, well after Hopetoun&#x27;s term expired.

===Influence over the Barton government===
Hopetoun also proved to be problematic as a public speaker in the new role. Though steering clear of any controversial subjects and stressing national unity and identity during his first months, in late 1901 and early 1902, he had committed several constitutional faux pas by publicly taking positions on political matters. Most notably in a speech to the Australian Natives&#x27; Association in January 1902, Hopetoun chose to discuss government policy towards the Boer War. He defended Barton&#x27;s decision to commit support to the conflict, emphasised his own role in the making of the decision alongside Barton and professed a belief that it was Australia&#x27;s duty to stand behind the imperial government in the war.

Though Barton and most of those who present were pleased with the patriotic speech, opposition leader George Reid quickly seized upon the issue as an example of inappropriate interference by the governor-general in political affairs that were the exclusive domain of parliament. A debate resulted in parliament which was generally critical, or at least tacitly disapproving, of Hopetoun&#x27;s comments. &quot;The Bulletin&quot; summarised the opposition opinion in its editorial: &quot;Since the day of the Governor-General&#x27;s arrival, he has shown a disposition to assert, and Mr Barton to allow, powers utterly at variance with the rights of a self-governing people.&quot;

Though most other opinion leaders did not go as far to state outright opposition to the governor-general&#x27;s actions, they did spur important early debates as to the role of the governor-general. Barton himself admitted to some influence from the Governor-General: though initially Barton was reluctant to commit support to the Boer War, communications by Hopetoun to the Colonial Office in December 1901 revealed that Barton&#x27;s position had been changed in favour of committing support and that change had most likely been driven by Hopetoun&#x27;s efforts.

Hopetoun also notably exercised influence over the content and passage of the Immigration Restriction Bill of 1901. Instructions from the Colonial Office revealed that in its original form, the bill was unacceptable to the British government, and Hopetoun was instructed to reserve Royal Assent until changes had been made. Hopetoun was left in a difficult position, as fears of immigration were rampant in Australia at the time and the bill was popular, notwithstanding the disapproval of the British government. A difficult period of private manoeuvring followed, after which Hopetoun was obliged to reserve assent on further amendments to the bill in the absence of instructions from London in an attempt to balance the interests of the Commonwealth and the Colonial Office. Eventually, important concessions were made by the Barton government and the bill was assented to by Hopetoun, although still not completely in line with imperial policy. Hopetoun&#x27;s use of the assent power to negotiate changes in Commonwealth legislation was effective and skilfully deployed so as to avoid public confrontation over the issue.

An interesting friendship developed between Lord Hopetoun and the Melbourne anarchist and union pioneer, John &#x27;Chummy&#x27; Fleming. In May 1901, Fleming protested against unemployment in Melbourne by rushing onto the Prince&#x27;s Bridge to halt the governor-general&#x27;s carriage. Hopetoun told the police not to interfere and listened to Fleming put the case for the unemployed. Out of this encounter came a friendship which endured after Hopetoun returned to England. According to some reports, Hopetoun is credited with pressuring the government to speed up government work projects.

===Financial dispute and resignation===
Hopetoun&#x27;s time as governor-general came to an abrupt and embarrassing end after a dispute over the financial arrangements for the office emerged in mid-1902. The Constitutional Conventions of the 1890s had set the governor-general salary at a generous £10,000, equivalent to the Canadian office. Yet in Canada, extensive provisions had been made for travel, residence and entertaining, no provisions for which were made in the Australian case.

Discussion of this matter provoked traditional rivalries between New South Wales and Victoria, with both maintaining that the governor-general&#x27;s seat should be in their respective state capitals. Eventually, houses in both states were provided for the governor-general&#x27;s use and expectations were made that the viceroy would share his time between the two. However provision for the cost of maintaining two large residences, while planning the construction of a third in the future federal capital, became subject to the long-running dispute between the Commonwealth and the states.

Victoria and New South Wales both avoided the issue and failed to pass bills allowing for the governor-general&#x27;s expenses while present in either state to be paid by the state itself. By the assumption of duties in 1901, Hopetoun still did not have a formal allowance approved for his expenses, but was privately assured by Barton that at least £8000 per annum would be at his disposal for the conduct of vice-regal duties.

Hopetoun was advised by the Colonial Office that he should limit his entertaining and expenses while the situation remained officially unresolved, but Hopetoun was by nature an extravagant figure in public life and significant resources were expended by Hopetoun travelling and hosting the Royal Visit. Barton meanwhile delayed on preparing a Commonwealth bill to cover the costs, stalling until mid-1902 to present the bill.

By this time, the euphoria of the royal tour had ended and political focus was on the still serious recession and drought that were straining the Australian economy. Barton&#x27;s speech in favour of the £8000 allowance was weak, and every other speaker in the debate on the bill opposed the legislation, which was subsequently amended into an unrecognisable measure designed to recoup the expense of the royal visit. The parliament then made it clear that no allowance would be approved for the vice-regal activities beyond what salary was already paid. Hopetoun was shocked: he had already incurred very great costs out of his own pocket to cover the expense of the office, which had strained his personal fortunes.

Publicly humiliated by the parliamentary rebuke, still in relatively ill health, and now under financial duress; on 5 May Hopetoun announced to the Colonial Office his desire to be recalled from the position. The Colonial Office expressed displeasure at the actions of the Barton government and complied with the request.

Though newspapers and politicians were divided on who was to blame for the sudden resignation, and many tried to dissuade Hopetoun from his decision, ultimately it became clear that Hopetoun&#x27;s perceptions that the governor-general would be a position analogous to the Viceroy of India or similar elaborate position were out of touch with public perceptions of the role. Hopetoun&#x27;s attempts to serve Australia as a glamorous figure of the British Empire had brought him into conflict with domestic politics and ultimately were cause for the abrupt end to his term. Although Hopetoun&#x27;s brief and frictional time in office revitalised some debate over whether the position should be a locally elected one, successors in the role quickly realised and conformed with the relative modesty which the position demanded and the system of British appointments continued.

Hopetoun and his family left Australia from Brisbane on 17 July 1902, at which point Lord Tennyson, Governor of South Australia, took over as Administrator of the Government. Still very popular with the Australian public, there were elaborate and tearful farewell ceremonies in Melbourne and Sydney. Upon Hopetoun&#x27;s return to Britain, King Edward VII recognised his service by bestowing upon him the title of Marquess of Linlithgow, in the county of Linlithgow or West Lothian, on 23 October 1902. However among observers, and particularly Hopetoun himself, &quot;there was little doubt that he had been less than successful in the great test of his public career&quot;.

In the wake of his resignation, Alfred Deakin provided an explanatory editorial under alias for the British public in &quot;The Morning Post&quot;: &quot;Our first Governor General may be said to have taken with him all the decorations and display and some of the anticipations that splendidly surrounded the inauguration of our national existence...we have...revised our estimate of high office, stripping it too hastily, but not unkindly, of its festal trappings. The stately ceremonial was fitting, but it has been completed.&quot;

==Later life==
Though he greatly desired appointment to the Viceroyalty of India, Linlithgow was prevented from attaining the position by poor health and adverse political developments, though his son Victor, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow, eventually assumed this role (after rejecting the post of Australian Governor-General in 1935) from 1936 to 1943. His grandson Lord Glendevon married the daughter of the English novelist W. Somerset Maugham.

In 1904 he accepted the position of President of the influential Scottish conservationist organisation the Cockburn Association, retaining the role until 1907.

His final political appointment was to that of Secretary for Scotland during the last months of the ministry of Arthur Balfour in 1905. His political career failed to advance, and still plagued by poor health, he died suddenly of pernicious anaemia at Pau, France, on 29 February 1908.

<doc id="331847" wikidata="Q3518775" url="?curid=331847" title="History of New York (state)">
<text>The history of New York begins around 10,000 B.C. when the first people arrived. By 1100 A.D. two main cultures had become dominant as the Iroquoian and Algonquian developed. European discovery of New York was led by Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524 followed by the first land claim in 1609 by the Dutch. As part of New Netherland, the colony was important in the fur trade and eventually became an agricultural resource thanks to the patroon system. In 1626, the Dutch thought they had bought the island of Manhattan from Native Americans. In 1664, England renamed the colony New York, after the Duke of York and Albany, brother of King Charles II. New York City gained prominence in the 18th century as a major trading port in the Thirteen Colonies.

New York played a pivotal role during the American Revolution and subsequent war. The Stamp Act Congress in 1765 brought together representatives from across the Thirteen Colonies to form a unified response to British policies. The Sons of Liberty were active in New York City to challenge British authority. After a major loss at the Battle of Long Island, the Continental Army suffered a series of additional defeats that forced a retreat from the New York City area, leaving the strategic port and harbor to the British army and navy as their North American base of operations for the rest of the war. The Battle of Saratoga was the turning point of the war in favor of the Americans, convincing France to formally ally with them. New York&#x27;s constitution was adopted in 1777, and strongly influenced the United States Constitution. New York City was the national capital at various times between 1788 and 1790, where the Bill of Rights was drafted. Albany became the permanent state capital in 1797. In 1787, New York became the eleventh state to ratify the United States Constitution.

New York hosted significant transportation advancements in the 19th century, including the first steamboat line in 1807, the Erie Canal in 1825, and America&#x27;s first regularly scheduled rail service in 1831. These advancements led to the expanded settlement of western New York and trade ties to the Midwest settlements around the Great Lakes.

Due to New York City&#x27;s trade ties to the South, there were numerous southern sympathizers in the early days of the American Civil War and the mayor proposed secession. Far from any of the battles, New York ultimately sent the most soldiers and money to support the Union cause. Thereafter, the state helped create the industrial age and consequently was home to some of the first labor unions.

During the 19th century, New York City became the main entry point for European immigrants to the United States, beginning with a wave of Irish during their Great Famine. Millions came through Castle Clinton in Battery Park before Ellis Island opened in 1892 to welcome millions more, increasingly from eastern and southern Europe. The Statue of Liberty opened in 1886 and became a symbol of hope. New York boomed during the Roaring Twenties, before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and skyscrapers expressed the energy of the city. New York City was the site of successive tallest buildings in the world from 1913 to 1974.

The buildup of defense industries for World War II turned around the state&#x27;s economy from the Great Depression, as hundreds of thousands worked to defeat the Axis powers. Following the war, the state experienced significant suburbanization around all the major cities, and most central cities shrank. The Thruway system opened in 1956, signaling another era of transportation advances.

Following a period of near-bankruptcy in the late 1970s, New York City renewed its stature as a cultural center, attracted more immigration, and hosted the development of new music styles. The city developed from publishing to become a media capital over the second half of the 20th century, hosting most national news channels and broadcasts. Some of its newspapers became nationally and globally renowned. The state&#x27;s manufacturing base eroded with the restructuring of industry, and the state transitioned into service industries.

==Prehistory==
The first peoples of New York are estimated to have arrived around 10,000 BC. Around AD 800, Iroquois ancestors moved into the area from the Appalachian region. The people of the Point Peninsula complex were the predecessors of the Algonquian peoples of New York. By around 1100, the distinct Iroquoian-speaking and Algonquian-speaking cultures that would eventually be encountered by Europeans had developed. The five nations of the Iroquois League developed a powerful confederacy about the 15th century that controlled territory throughout present-day New York, into Pennsylvania around the Great Lakes. For centuries, the Mohawk cultivated maize fields in the lowlands of the Mohawk River, which were later taken over by Dutch settlers at Schenectady, New York when they bought this territory. The Iroquois nations to the west also had well-cultivated areas and orchards.

The Iroquois established dominance over the fur trade throughout their territory, bargaining with European colonists. Other New York tribes were more subject to either European destruction or assimilation within the Iroquoian confederacy. Situated at major Native trade routes in the Northeast and positioned between French and English zones of settlement, the Iroquois were intensely caught up with the onrush of Europeans, which is also to say that the settlers, whether Dutch, French or English, were caught up with the Iroquois as well. Algonquian tribes were less united among their tribes; they typically lived along rivers, streams, or the Atlantic Coast. But, both groups of natives were well-established peoples with highly sophisticated cultural systems; these were little understood or appreciated by the European colonists who encountered them. The natives had &quot;a complex and elaborate native economy that included hunting, gathering, manufacturing, and farming...[and were] a mosaic of Native American tribes, nations, languages, and political associations.&quot; The Iroquois usually met at an Onondaga in Northern New York, which changed every century or so, where they would coordinate policies on how to deal with Europeans and strengthen the bond between the Five Nations.

Tribes who have managed to call New York home have been the Iroquois, Mohawk, Mohican, Susquehannock, Petun, Chonnonton, Ontario and Nanticoke.

==Pre-colonial period==
In 1524, Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian explorer in the service of the French crown, explored the Atlantic coast of North America between the Carolinas and Newfoundland, including New York Harbor and Narragansett Bay. On April 17, 1524, Verrazzano entered New York Bay, by way of the Strait now called the Narrows. He described &quot;a vast coastline with a deep delta in which every kind of ship could pass&quot; and he adds: &quot;that it extends inland for a league and opens up to form a beautiful lake. This vast sheet of water swarmed with native boats&quot;. He landed on the tip of Manhattan and perhaps on the furthest point of Long Island.

In 1535, Jacques Cartier, a French explorer, became the first European to describe and map the Saint Lawrence River from the Atlantic Ocean, sailing as far upriver as the site of Montreal.

==Dutch and British colonial period==
On April 4, 1609, Henry Hudson, in the employ of the Dutch East India Company, departed Amsterdam in command of the ship &quot;Halve Maen&quot; (Half Moon). On September 3 he reached the estuary of the Hudson River. He sailed up the Hudson River to about Albany near the confluence of the Mohawk River and the Hudson. His voyage was used to establish Dutch claims to the region and to the fur trade that prospered there after a trading post was established at Albany in 1614.

In 1614, the Dutch under the command of Hendrick Christiaensen, built Fort Nassau (now Albany) the first Dutch settlement in North America and the first European settlement in what would become New York. It was replaced by nearby Fort Orange in 1624. In 1625, Fort Amsterdam was built on the southern tip of Manhattan Island to defend the Hudson River. This settlement grew to become the city New Amsterdam.

The British conquered New Netherland in 1664; Lenient terms of surrender most likely kept local resistance to a minimum. The colony and New Amsterdam were both renamed New York (and &quot;Beverwijck&quot; was renamed Albany) after its new proprietor, James II later King of England, Ireland and Scotland, who was at the time Duke of York and Duke of Albany. The population of New Netherland at the time of English takeover was 7,000–8,000.

==Province of New York (1664–1776)==

Thousands of poor German farmers, chiefly from the Palatine region of Germany, migrated to upstate districts after 1700. They kept to themselves, married their own, spoke German, attended Lutheran churches, and retained their own customs and foods. They emphasized farm ownership. Some mastered English to become conversant with local legal and business opportunities. They ignored the Indians and tolerated slavery (although few were rich enough to own a slave).

Large manors were developed along the Hudson River by elite colonists during the 18th century, including Livingston, Cortlandt, Philipsburg, and Rensselaerswyck. The manors represented more than half of the colony&#x27;s undeveloped land. The Province of New York thrived during this time, its economy strengthened by Long Island and Hudson Valley agriculture, in conjunction with trade and artisanal activity at the Port of New York; the colony was a breadbasket and lumberyard for the British sugar colonies in the Caribbean. New York&#x27;s population grew substantially during this century: from the first colonial census (1698) to the last (1771), the province grew ninefold, from 18,067 to 168,007.

==New York in the American Revolution==
New York played a pivotal role in the Revolutionary War. The colony verged on revolt following the Stamp Act of 1765, advancing the New York City–based Sons of Liberty to the forefront of New York politics. The Act exacerbated the depression the province experienced after unsuccessfully invading Canada in 1760. Even though New York City merchants lost out on lucrative military contracts, the group sought common ground between the King and the people; however, compromise became impossible as of April 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord. In that aftermath the New York Provincial Congress on June 9, 1775, for five pounds sterling for each hundredweight of gunpowder delivered to each county&#x27;s committee.

Two powerful families had for decades assembled colony-wide coalitions of supporters. With few exceptions, members long associated with the DeLancey faction went along when its leadership decided to support the crown, while members of the Livingston faction became Patriots.

New York&#x27;s strategic central location and port made it key to controlling the colonies. The British assembled the century&#x27;s largest fleet: at one point 30,000 British sailors and soldiers anchored off Staten Island. General George Washington barely escaped New York City with his army in November 1776; General Sir William Howe was successful in driving Washington out, but erred by expanding into New Jersey. By January 1777, he retained only a few outposts near New York City. The British held the city for the duration, using it as a base for expeditions against other targets.

In October 1777, American General Horatio Gates won the Battle of Saratoga, later regarded as the war&#x27;s turning point. Had Gates not held, the rebellion might well have broken down: losing Saratoga would have cost the entire Hudson–Champlain corridor, which would have separated New England from the rest of the colonies and split the future union.

==Statehood to the Civil War==
 Upon war&#x27;s end, New York&#x27;s borders became well–defined: the counties east of Lake Champlain became Vermont and the state&#x27;s western borders were settled by 1786.

Many Iroquois supported the British (typically fearing future American ambitions). Many were killed during the war; others went into exile with the British. Those remaining lived on twelve reservations; by 1826 only eight reservations remained, all of which survived into the 21st century.

The state adopted its constitution in April 1777, creating a strong executive and strict separation of powers. It strongly influenced the federal constitution a decade later. Debate over the federal constitution in 1787 led to formation of the groups known as Federalists—mainly &quot;downstaters&quot; (those who lived in or near New York City) who supported a strong national government—and Antifederalists—mainly upstaters (those who lived to the city&#x27;s north and west) who opposed large national institutions. In 1787, Alexander Hamilton, a leading Federalist from New York and signatory to the Constitution, wrote the first essay of the &quot;Federalist Papers&quot;. He published and wrote most of the series in New York City newspapers in support of the proposed United States Constitution. Antifederalists were not swayed by the arguments, but the state ratified it in 1788.

In 1785, New York City became the national capital and continued as such on and off until 1790; George Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States in front of Federal Hall in 1789. The United States Bill of Rights was drafted there, and the United States Supreme Court sat for the first time. From statehood to 1797, the Legislature frequently moved the state capital between Albany, Kingston, Poughkeepsie, and New York City. Thereafter, Albany retained that role.

In the early 19th century, New York became a center for advancement in transportation. In 1807, Robert Fulton initiated a steamboat line from New York to Albany, the first successful enterprise of its kind. By 1815, Albany was the state&#x27;s turnpike center, which established the city as the hub for pioneers migrating west to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory.

In 1825 the Erie Canal opened, securing the state&#x27;s economic dominance. Its impact was enormous: one source stated, &quot;Linking the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes, the canal was an act of political will that joined the regions of the state, created a vast economic hinterland for New York City, and established a ready market for agricultural products from the state&#x27;s interior.&quot; In that year western New York transitioned from &quot;frontier&quot; to settled area. By this time, all counties and most municipalities had incorporated, approximately matching the state&#x27;s is organized today. In 1831, the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad started the country&#x27;s first successful regularly–scheduled steam railroad service.

Advancing transportation quickly led to settlement of the fertile Mohawk and Genessee valleys and the Niagara Frontier. Buffalo and Rochester became boomtowns. Significant migration of New England &quot;Yankees&quot; (mainly of English descent) to the central and western parts of the state led to minor conflicts with the more settled &quot;Yorkers&quot; (mainly of German, Dutch, and Scottish descent). More than 15% of the state&#x27;s 1850 population had been born in New England . The western part of the state grew fastest at this time. By 1840, New York was home to seven of the nation&#x27;s thirty largest cities.

During this period, towns established academies for education, including for girls. The western area of the state was a center of progressive causes, including support of abolitionism, temperance, and women&#x27;s rights. Religious enthusiasms flourished and the Latter Day Saint movement was founded in the area by Joseph Smith and his vision. Some supporters of abolition participated in the Underground Railroad, helping fugitive slaves reach freedom in Canada or in New York.

In addition, in the early 1840s the state legislature and Governor William H. Seward expanded rights for free blacks and fugitive slaves in New York: in 1840 the legislature passed laws protecting the rights of African Americans against Southern slave-catchers. One guaranteed alleged fugitive slaves the right of a jury trial in New York to establish whether they were slaves, and another pledged the aid of the state to recover free blacks kidnapped into slavery, (as happened to Solomon Northup of Saratoga Springs in 1841, who did not regain freedom until 1853.) In 1841 Seward signed legislation to repeal a &quot;nine-month law&quot; that allowed slaveholders to bring their slaves into the state for a period of nine months before they were considered free. After this, slaves brought to the state were immediately considered freed, as was the case in some other free states. Seward also signed legislation to establish public education for all children, leaving it up to local jurisdictions as to how that would be supplied (some had segregated schools).

New York culture bloomed in the first half of the 19th century: in 1809 Washington Irving wrote the satirical &quot;A History of New York&quot; under the pen name Diedrich Knickerbocker, and in 1819 he based &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; in Hudson Valley towns. Thomas Cole&#x27;s Hudson River School was established in the 1830s by showcasing dramatic landscapes of the Hudson Valley. The first baseball teams formed in New York City in the 1840s, including the New York Knickerbockers. Professional baseball later located its Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. Saratoga Race Course, an annual summer attraction in Saratoga Springs, opened in 1847.

==New York in the American Civil War==

A civil war was not in the best interest of business, because New York had strong ties to the Deep South, both through the port of New York and manufacture of cotton goods in upstate textile mills. Half of New York City&#x27;s exports were related to cotton before the war. Southern businessmen so frequently traveled to the city that they established favorite hotels and restaurants. Trade was based on moving Southern goods. The city&#x27;s large Democrat community feared the impact of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s election in 1860 and the mayor urged secession of New York.

By the time of the 1861 Battle of Fort Sumter, such political differences decreased and the state quickly met Lincoln&#x27;s request for soldiers and supplies. More soldiers fought from New York than any other Northern state. While no battles were waged in New York, the state was not immune to Confederate conspiracies, including one to burn various New York cities and another to invade the state via Canada.

In January 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the slaves in states that were still in rebellion against the union. In March 1863, the federal draft law was changed so that male citizens between 20 and 35 and unmarried citizens to age 45 were subject to conscription. Those who could afford to hire a substitute or pay $300 were exempt. Antiwar newspaper editors attacked the law, and many immigrants and their descendants resented being drafted in place of people who could buy their way out. Democratic Party leaders raised the specter of a deluge of freed southern blacks competing with the white working class, then dominated by ethnic Irish and immigrants. On the lottery&#x27;s first day, July 11, 1863, the first lottery draw was held. On Monday, July 13, 1863, five days of large-scale riots began, which were dominated by ethnic Irish, who targeted blacks in the city, their neighborhoods, and known abolitionist sympathizers. As a result, many blacks left Manhattan permanently, moving to Brooklyn or other areas.

==End of the Civil War to 1901==

In the following decades, New York strengthened its dominance of the financial and banking industries. Manufacturing continued to rise: Eastman Kodak founded in 1888 in Rochester, General Electric in Schenectady, and Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company in the Triple Cities are some of the well-known companies founded during this period. Buffalo and Niagara Falls attracted numerous factories following the advent of hydroelectric power in the area. With industry blooming, workers began to unite in New York as early as the 1820s. By 1882, the Knights of Labor in New York City had 60,000 members. Trade unions used political influence to limit working hours as early as 1867. At the same time, New York&#x27;s agricultural output peaked. Focus changed from crop-based to dairy-based agriculture. The cheese industry became established in the Mohawk Valley. By 1881, the state had more than 241,000 farms. In the same period, the area around New York Harbor became the world&#x27;s oyster capital, retaining that title into the early twentieth century.

Immigration increased throughout the latter half of the 19th century. Starting with refugees from the Great Famine of Ireland in the 1840s, New York became a prominent entry point for those seeking a new life in the United States. Between 1855 and 1890, an estimated 8 million immigrants passed through Castle Clinton at Battery Park in Manhattan. Early in this period, most immigrants came from Ireland and Germany. Ellis Island opened in 1892, and between 1880 and 1920, most immigrants were German and Eastern European Jews, Poles, and other Eastern and Southern Europeans, including many Italians. By 1925, New York City&#x27;s population outnumbered that of London, making it the most populous city in the world. Arguably New York&#x27;s most identifiable symbol, &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot; (the Statue of Liberty), a gift from France for the American centennial, was completed in 1886. By the early 20th century, the statue, designed by sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, was regarded as the &quot;Mother of Exiles&quot;—a symbol of hope to immigrants.

New York&#x27;s political pattern changed little after the mid–19th century. New York City and its metropolitan area was already heavily Democrat; Upstate was aligned with the Republican Party and was a center of abolitionist activists. In the 1850s, Democratic Tammany Hall became one of the most powerful and durable political machines in United States history. Boss William Tweed brought the organization to the forefront of city and then state politics in the 1860s. Based on its command of a large population, Tammany maintained influence until at least the 1930s. Outside the city, Republicans were able to influence the redistricting process enough to constrain New York City and capture control of the Legislature in 1894. Both parties have seen national political success: in the 39 presidential elections between 1856 and 2010, Republicans won 19 times and Democrats 20 times.

==1901 through the Great Depression==

By 1901, New York was the richest and most populous state. Two years prior, the five boroughs of New York City became one city. Within decades, the city&#x27;s emblem had become the skyscraper: the Woolworth Building was the tallest building in the world from 1913, surpassed by 40 Wall Street in April 1930, the Chrysler Building in 1930, the Empire State Building in 1931, and the World Trade Center in 1972 before losing the title in 1974.

The state was serviced by over a dozen major railroads and at the start of the 20th century and electric Interurban rail networks began to spring up around Syracuse, Rochester and other cities in New York during this period.
In the late 1890s governor Theodore Roosevelt and fellow Republicans such as Charles Evans Hughes worked with many Democrats such as Al Smith to promote Progressivism. They battled trusts and monopolies (especially in the insurance industry), promoted efficiency, fought waste, and called for more democracy in politics. Democrats focused more on the benefits of progressivism for their own ethnic working class base and for labor unions.
Democratic political machines, especially Tammany Hall in Manhattan, opposed woman suffrage because they feared that the addition of female voters would dilute the control they had established over groups of male voters. By the time of the New York State referendum on women&#x27;s suffrage in 1917, however, some wives and daughters of Tammany Hall leaders were working for suffrage, leading it to take a neutral position that was crucial to the referendum&#x27;s passage.

Following a sharp but short-lived Depression at the beginning of the decade, New York enjoyed a booming economy during the Roaring Twenties. New York suffered during the Great Depression, which began with the Wall Street crash on Black Tuesday in 1929. The Securities and Exchange Commission opened in 1934 to regulate the stock market. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected governor in 1928, and the state faced upwards of 25% unemployment. His Temporary Emergency Relief Agency, established in 1931, was the first work relief program in the nation and influenced the national Federal Emergency Relief Administration. Roosevelt was elected President in 1932 in part because of his promises to extend New York–style relief programs across the country via his New Deal. In 1932, Lake Placid was host to the III Olympic Winter Games.

==World War II and the modern era==
As the largest state, New York again supplied the most resources during World War II. New York manufactured 11 percent of total United States military armaments produced during the war and suffered 31,215 casualties. The war affected the state both socially and economically. For example, to overcome discriminatory labor practices, Governor Herbert H. Lehman created the Committee on Discrimination in Employment in 1941 and Governor Thomas E. Dewey signed the Ives-Quinn Act in 1945, banning employment discrimination. The G.I. Bill of 1944, which offered returning soldiers the opportunity of affordable higher education, forced New York to create a public university system since its private universities could not handle the influx; the State University of New York was created by Governor Dewey in 1948.

World War II constituted New York&#x27;s last great industrial era. At its conclusion, the defense industry shrank and the economy shifted towards producing services rather than goods. Returning soldiers disproportionately displaced female and minority workers who had entered the industrial workforce only when the war left employers no other choice. Companies moved to the south and west, seeking lower taxes and a less costly, non–union workforce. Many workers followed the jobs.
The middle class expanded and created suburbs such as the one on Long Island. The automobile accelerated this decentralization; planned communities like Levittown offered affordable middle-class housing.

Larger cities stopped growing around 1950. Growth resumed only in New York City, in the 1980s. Buffalo&#x27;s population fell by half between 1950 and 2000. Reduced immigration and worker migration led New York State&#x27;s population to decline for the first time between 1970 and 1980. California and Texas both surpassed it in population.

New York entered its third era of massive transportation projects by building highways, notably the New York State Thruway. The project was unpopular with New York City Democrats, who referred to it as &quot;Dewey&#x27;s ditch&quot; and the &quot;enemy of schools&quot;, because the Thruway disproportionately benefited upstate. The highway was based on the German Autobahn and was unlike anything seen at that point in the United States. It was within of 90% of the population at its conception. Costing $600 million, the full project opened in 1956.

Nelson Rockefeller was governor from 1959 to 1973 and changed New York politics. He began as a liberal, but grew more conservative: he limited SUNY&#x27;s growth, responded aggressively to the Attica Prison riot, and promulgated the uniquely severe Rockefeller Drug Laws. The World Trade Center and other profligate projects nearly drove New York City into bankruptcy in 1975. The state took substantial budgetary control, which eventually led to improved fiscal prudence.

The Executive Mansion was retaken by Democrats in 1974 and remained under Democratic control for 20 years under Hugh Carey and Mario Cuomo. Late–century Democrats became more centrist, including US Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (1977–2001) and New York City Mayor Ed Koch (1978–1989), while state Republicans began to align themselves with the more conservative national party. They gained power through the elections of Senator Alfonse D&#x27;Amato in 1980, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in 1993, and Governor George Pataki in 1994. New York remained one of the most liberal states. In 1984, Ronald Reagan was the last Republican to carry the state, although Republican Michael Bloomberg served as New York City mayor in the early 21st century.

==Last decades of 20th century==
In the late 20th century, telecommunication and high technology industries employed many New Yorkers. New York City was especially successful at this transition. Entrepreneurs created many small companies, as industrial firms such as Polaroid withered. This success drew many young professionals into the still–dwindling cities. New York City was the exception and has continued to draw new residents. The energy of the city created attractions and new businesses. Some people believe that changes in policing created a less threatening environment; crime rates dropped, and urban development reduced urban decay.

This in turn led to a surge in culture. New York City became, once again, &quot;the center for all things chic and trendy&quot;. Hip-hop and rap music, led by New York City, became the most popular pop genre. Immigration to both the city and state rose. New York City, with a large gay and lesbian community, suffered many deaths from AIDS beginning in the 1980s. 
New York City increased its already large share of television programming, home to the network news broadcasts, as well as two of the three major cable news networks. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; became two of the three &quot;national&quot; newspapers, read throughout the country. New York also increased its dominance of the financial services industry centered on Wall Street, led by banking expansion, a rising stock market, innovations in investment banking, including junk bond trading and accelerated by the savings and loan crisis that decimated competitors elsewhere in New York.

Upstate did not fare as well as downstate; the major industries that began to reinvigorate New York City did not typically spread to other regions. The number of farms in the state had fallen to 30,000 by 1997. City populations continued to decline while suburbs grew in area, but did not increase proportionately in population. High-tech industry grew in cities such as Corning and Rochester. Overall New York entered the new millennium &quot;in a position of economic strength and optimism&quot;.

==21st century (2001–present day)==

In 2001, New York entered a new era following the 9/11 attacks, the worst terrorist attack ever to take place on American soil. Two of the four hijacked passenger jets crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, destroying them, and killing almost 3,000 people. One flew into the Pentagon demolishing the walls. The final one was almost taken back over by the passengers aboard and crashed into an open grassland with 296 out of the 500 people dead. Thousands of New Yorkers volunteered their time to search the ruin for survivors and remains in the following weeks.

Following the attacks, plans were announced to rebuild the World Trade Center site. 7 World Trade Center became the first World Trade Center skyscraper to be rebuilt in five years after the attacks. One World Trade Center, four more office towers, and a memorial to the casualties of the September 11 attacks are under construction as of 2011. One World Trade Center opened on November 3, 2014.
On October 29 and 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive destruction of the state&#x27;s shorelines, ravaging portions of New York City, Long Island, and southern Westchester with record-high storm surge, with severe flooding and high winds causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, and leading to gasoline shortages and disruption of mass transit systems. The storm and its profound effects have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of New York City and Long Island to minimize the risk from another such future event. Such risk is considered highly probable due to global warming and rising sea levels.

<doc id="331860" wikidata="Q763446" url="?curid=331860" title="Trick (1999 film)">
<text>Trick is a 1999 American gay-themed romantic comedy film directed by Jim Fall and starring Christian Campbell, John Paul Pitoc, Miss Coco Peru, and Tori Spelling. Independently produced by Eric d&#x27;Arbeloff, Ross Katz, and Fall, the film was written by Jason Schafer. &quot;Trick&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1999 and was later released theatrically by Fine Line Features that July. The film grossed $2million at the United States box office, which was seen by Fine Line Features as &quot;credible business&quot;.

==Plot==
Gabriel, an office temp by day and aspiring Broadway composer by night, makes eye contact with Mark, a go-go dancer at a gay bar. The two meet again in the subway the same night, and go back to Gabriel&#x27;s place to have sex. They are thwarted in the attempt first by Gabriel&#x27;s aspiring actress friend Katherine, who is obsessed with her role in an adaptation of &quot;Salomé&quot; set in a women&#x27;s prison, and then by Gabriel&#x27;s roommate Rich, who returns home with his girlfriend Judy and has similar (and conflicting) plans for the apartment.

Gabriel and Rich argue over which of them should get to use the apartment that night, and decide to settle the matter with a coin toss. When Gabriel loses the coin toss and he and Mark have to leave, Gabriel seeks out his friend Perry to request the use of Perry&#x27;s place. Unfortunately, as Perry escorts Gabriel and Mark there, they run into Perry&#x27;s ex-boyfriend. Perry and his ex tearfully reconcile and they go back to Perry&#x27;s, frustrating Gabriel and Mark yet again. The two then decide to hit a gay club for some dancing. There, a malicious drag queen, Miss Coco, corners Gabriel in the restroom. She badmouths Mark to Gabriel, telling him of the time they trickedwhich sounds very much like how Gabriel and Mark metand how Mark left abruptly after climaxing, leaving her with a fake phone number to boot. Crushed by this news, Gabriel decides to take off.

Mark follows Gabriel back to his and Rich&#x27;s apartment to talkand also because he has left his house keys there. They go in to look for the keys and try to talk things out while Judy mediates, topless. Mark asserts that while he did indeed trick once with Miss Coco, it was actually the latter who tried to take advantage of &quot;him&quot; by secretly videotaping their encounter without Mark&#x27;s consent. Gabriel accepts this story, but still does not trust Mark, so Mark leaves angrily. Judy then finds Mark&#x27;s keys, and Gabriel chases after Mark with them down into the subway. Just when it seems that Mark is gone forever, he reappears; he and Gabriel made a connection after all.

Having reconciled, they decide to get something to eat but run into Katherine and some of her theatre friends at a diner, where Katherine proceeds to monopolize the conversation. Gabriel finally blows up at her, and Katherine, humiliated, melts down and leaves in a huff. Gabriel chases after her and apologizes; they smooth things over and Katherine and her friends depart. As the new morning dawns, Mark gives Gabriel his phone number, they kiss, and Mark heads home. Gabriel calls the number on a nearby payphone, and is relieved to learn that it&#x27;s Mark&#x27;s actual number. While they never found a spot to trick, Mark and Gabriel instead formed a budding relationship beyond the simple one-night stand they had first been trying for.

Filming was completed in less than three weeks in August 1998.

==Critical reception==

Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;The movie imposes a Doris Day story line on material that wants to be more sexual; it’s about a character whose quasi-virginity is preserved through an improbable series of mishaps and coincidences.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;&quot;Trick&quot; is a tenderhearted boy-meets-boy story that manages to incorporate the courtship-interruptus style of the Doris Day era into a Greenwich Village one-night stand.&quot;

==Sequel==
In a December 2012 AfterElton.com interview, director Fall stated that he and writer Schafer were in the early stages of developing a sequel to &quot;Trick&quot;. Fall said the film would take place 12 years after the first one, with main characters Gabriel and Mark — not having stayed together because they were &quot;not really right for each other&quot; — meeting again and falling in love as grown men in their 40s.

Fall announced in a non-public social media post in August 2018 that script for the sequel was completed and the project was moving forward, with Coco Peru attached to co-star. Scheduled for release in 2019, the film will be set in Los Angeles. Fall subsequently told &quot;Out&quot; that Campbell, Pitoc, Spelling, Beyer and Hayes would be reprising their roles in &quot;Trick 2&quot;. Other cast members announced in September 2018 include Guillermo Diaz, Jimmy Fowlie, Tara Karsian, Arne Gjelten, Joe Arellano, and Elizabeth Regensburger-Gonzalez.

<doc id="331863" wikidata="Q192615" url="?curid=331863" title="Ferdinand Foch">
<text>Ferdinand Foch ( , ; 2 October 1851 – 20 March 1929) was a French general, Marshal of France and a member of the Académie Française and Académie des Sciences. He distinguished himself as Supreme Allied Commander on the Western Front during the First World War in 1918.

A commander during the First Marne, Flanders and Artois campaigns of 1914–1916, Foch became Supreme Allied Commander in late March 1918 in the face of the all-out German spring offensive. He successfully coordinated the French, British and American efforts, deftly handling his strategic reserves. He stopped the German offensive and launched a war-winning counterattack. In November 1918, Marshal Foch accepted the German cessation of hostilities and was present at the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

At the outbreak of war in August 1914, Foch&#x27;s XX Corps participated in the brief invasion of Germany before retreating in the face of a German counter-attack and successfully blocking the Germans short of Nancy. Ordered west to defend Paris, Foch&#x27;s prestige soared as a result of the victory at the Marne, for which he was widely credited as a chief protagonist while commanding the French Ninth Army. He was then promoted again to assistant commander-in-chief for the Northern Zone, a role which evolved into command of Army Group North, and in which role he was required to cooperate with the British forces at Ypres and the Somme. At the end of 1916, partly owing to the disappointing results of the latter offensive and partly owing to wartime political rivalries, Foch was transferred to Italy. Foch was appointed &quot;Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies&quot; on 26 March 1918 following being the commander-in-chief of Western Front with the title Généralissime in 1918. He played a decisive role in halting a renewed German advance on Paris in the Second Battle of the Marne, after which he was promoted to Marshal of France. Author Larry H. Addington says, &quot;to a large extent the final Allied strategy which won the war on land in Western Europe in 1918 was Foch&#x27;s alone.&quot;

On 11 November 1918, Foch accepted the German request for an armistice. Foch advocated peace terms that would make Germany unable to pose a threat to France ever again. He considered the Treaty of Versailles too lenient on Germany. Winston Churchill attributed this famous but apocryphal quote about the Peace Treaty of Versailles to Foch: &quot;This is not Peace. It is an Armistice for twenty years.&quot; Indeed, the next war sprung out 20 years later.

== Early life ==
Ferdinand Foch was born in Tarbes, a municipality in the department of Hautes-Pyrénées, in southwestern France, into a modest, devout, middle-class Catholic family. His last name reflects the ancestry of his father, a civil servant from Valentine, a village in Haute-Garonne, whose lineage may trace back to 16th-century Alsace. From a young age, he loved to study and work, showed great interest in military history and strategy, and was an avid reader of military literature. He attended school in Tarbes, Rodez, Gourdan-Polignan and at the Jesuit in Saint-Étienne before attending the Jesuit in Metz. A professor there once said of Foch, &quot;A geometric mind, he is made for the Polytechnique.&quot; His brother, Germain Foch, became a Jesuit priest, which may have hindered Foch&#x27;s rise in the French Army since the Republican government of France was anti-clerical.

When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, the 19-year-old Foch enlisted in the French 4th Infantry Regiment, which did not take part in combat. He remained in the army after the war. In 1871, he passed the entrance exams to the grandes écoles scientifiques and later entered the &quot;École Polytechnique.&quot; There, he was an excellent, hard-working, and studious student, and pursued studies in mathematics, engineering, science, history, and literature. He eventually chose the school of artillery. In 1873, he received his commission as an artillery officer and served as a lieutenant in the 24th Artillery Regiment in Tarbes, despite not having completed his course, because there was a shortage of junior officers. In 1876, he attended the cavalry school of Saumur to train as a mounted artillery officer. On 30 September 1878, he became a captain and arrived in Paris on 24 September 1879 as an assistant in the Central Personnel Service Depot of the artillery.

In 1885 Foch undertook a course at the &quot;École Supérieure de Guerre&quot; where he was later an instructor from 1895 to 1901. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1898, and colonel in 1903. As a colonel he became regimental commander of the 35th Artillery Regiment (35e R.A) at Vannes. Foch was known for his physical strength and his sharp mind who always maintained a highly dignified bearing. Foch was a quiet man, known for saying little and when he did speak, it was a volley of words accompanied by much gesturing of his hands that required some knowledge of him to understand properly. One of Foch&#x27;s favourite phrases was &quot;Pas de protocole!&quot; as he preferred to be approachable by all officers. Foch&#x27;s only rigidity was always taking his meals at noon and at 7:30; otherwise, he would work all sorts of irregular hours from dawn until well into the night.

In 1907 Foch was promoted to &quot;Général de Brigade&quot;, and in the same year, he assumed command of the French War College. He held this position until 1911, the year in which he was appointed &quot;Général de Division&quot;. Foch influenced General Joseph Joffre (Chief of General Staff, 28 July 1911 – 12 December 1916) when he drafted the French plan of campaign (Plan XVII) in 1913. In 1913 he took command of at Nancy, and he had held this appointment for exactly one year when he led XX Corps into battle in August 1914.

== Military thought ==
Foch was later acclaimed as &quot;the most original military thinker of his generation&quot;. He was a disciple of Napoleon, and made use of the lessons taught by Moltke. He became known for his critical analyses of the Franco-Prussian and Napoleonic campaigns and of their relevance to military operations in the new twentieth century. His re-examination of France&#x27;s defeat in 1870 was among the first of its kind. At the college, Foch was a professor of military history, strategy, and general tactics while becoming the French theorist on offensive strategies. He also employed mathematical terms in his lectures.

During his time as an instructor, Foch created renewed interest in French military history, inspired confidence in a new class of French officers, and brought about &quot;the intellectual and moral regeneration of the French Army&quot;. His thinking on military doctrine was shaped by the Clausewitzian philosophy, then uncommon in France, that &quot;the will to conquer is the first condition of victory.&quot; Collections of his lectures, which reintroduced the concept of the offensive to French military theory, were published in the volumes &quot;Des Principes de la Guerre&quot; (&quot;On the Principles of War&quot;) in 1903, and &quot;De la Conduite de la Guerre&quot; (&quot;On the Conduct of War&quot;) in 1904. Both &quot;thought&quot; and &quot;will&quot; were the key words of these teachings. While Foch advised &quot;qualification and discernment&quot; in military strategy and cautioned that &quot;recklessness in attack could lead to prohibitive losses and ultimate failure&quot;, his concepts, distorted and misunderstood by contemporaries, became associated with the extreme offensive doctrines (&quot;l&#x27; offensive à outrance&quot;) of his successors. The cult of the offensive came to dominate military circles, and Foch&#x27;s reputation was damaged when his books were cited in the development of the disastrous offensive that brought France close to ruin in August 1914.

Foch was seen as a master of the Napoleonic school of military thought, but he was the only one of the Military College Commandants (Maillard, Langlois, Bonnal) still serving. Their doctrines had been challenged, not only by the German school, but also since about 1911 by a new French school inspired by General Loiseau de Grandmaison, which criticised them as lacking in vigour and offensive spirit and contributing to needless dispersion of force. The French Army fought under the new doctrines, but they failed in the first battles of August 1914, and it remained to be seen whether the Napoleonic doctrine would hold its own, would give way to doctrines evolved during the war, or would incorporate the new moral and technical elements into a new outward form within which the spirit of Napoleon remained unaltered. The war gave an ambiguous answer to these questions, which remains a source of controversy among experts.

== World War I ==
=== 1914 ===
On the outbreak of World War I, Foch was in command of XX Corps, part of the Second Army of General de Castelnau. On 14 August the Corps advanced towards the Sarrebourg–Morhange line, taking heavy casualties in the Battle of the Frontiers. The defeat of the XV Corps to its right forced Foch into retreat. Foch acquitted himself well, covering the withdrawal to Nancy and the Charmes Gap before launching a counter-attack that prevented the Germans from crossing the River Meurthe.

Foch was then selected to command the newly formed Ninth Army during the First Battle of the Marne with Maxime Weygand as his chief of staff. Only a week after taking command, with the whole French Army in full retreat, he was forced to fight a series of defensive actions to prevent a German breakthrough. During the advance at the marshes at St.-Gond he is said to have declared: &quot;My centre is yielding. My right is retreating. Situation excellent. I am attacking.&quot; These words were seen as a symbol both of Foch&#x27;s leadership and of French determination to resist the invader at any cost, although there is little evidence that the signal was sent. Accordingly, on 4 October 1914, Foch was made the Assistant Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Zone under Joseph Joffre.

Foch&#x27;s counterattack was an implementation of the theories he had developed during his staff college days and succeeded in stopping the German advance. Foch received further reinforcements from the Fifth Army and, following another attack on his forces, counter-attacked again on the Marne. The Germans dug in before eventually retreating. On 12 September, Foch regained the Marne at Châlons and liberated the city. The people of Châlons greeted as a hero the man widely believed to have been instrumental in stopping the retreat and stabilising the Allied position. Receiving thanks from the Bishop of Châlons (Joseph-Marie Tissier), Foch piously replied, &quot;non nobis, Domine, non nobis, sed nomini tuo da gloriam&quot; (&quot;Not unto us, o Lord, not unto us, but to Your name give glory&quot;, Psalm 115:1).

As assistant Commander-in-Chief with responsibility for co-ordinating the activities of the northern French armies and liaising with the British forces; this was a key appointment as the Race to the Sea was then in progress. General Joseph Joffre, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the French Army, had also wanted to nominate Foch as his successor &quot;in case of accident&quot;, to make sure the job would not be given to Joseph Gallieni, but the French Government would not agree to this. When the Germans attacked on 13 October, they narrowly failed to break through the British and French lines. They tried again at the end of the month during the First Battle of Ypres, this time suffering terrible casualties. Foch had again succeeded in coordinating a defense and winning against the odds.

Field Marshal Sir John French, C-in-C of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had described Foch in August 1914 to J. E. B. Seely, a liaison officer, as &quot;the sort of man with whom I know I can get on&quot; and later in February 1915 described him to Lord Selbourne as &quot;the best general in the world&quot;. By contrast, Lieutenant General William Robertson, another British officer, thought that Foch was &quot;rather a flat-catcher, a mere professor, and very talkative&quot; (28 September 1915).

On 2 December 1914, King George V appointed him an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.

=== 1915–16 ===
In 1915, his responsibilities by now crystallised in command of the Northern Army Group, he conducted the Artois Offensive and, in 1916, the French effort at the Battle of the Somme. He was strongly criticised for his tactics and the heavy casualties that were suffered by the Allied armies during these battles, and in December 1916 was removed from command by Joffre and sent to command Allied units on the Italian front; Joffre was himself sacked days later.

=== 1917 ===
Just a few months later, after the failure of General Robert Nivelle&#x27;s offensive, General Philippe Pétain, the hero of Verdun, was appointed Chief of the General Staff; Foch hoped to succeed Pétain in command of Army Group Centre, but this job was instead given to General Fayolle. The following month Pétain was appointed C-in-C in place of Nivelle, and Foch was recalled and promoted to chief of the general staff. Like Pétain, Foch favoured only limited attacks (he had told Lieutenant General Sir Henry Wilson, another British Army officer, that the planned Flanders offensive was &quot;futile, fantastic &amp; dangerous&quot;) until the Americans, who had joined the war in April 1917, were able to send large numbers of troops to France.

Outside of the Western Front, Foch opposed British Prime Minister David Lloyd George&#x27;s plans to send British and French troops to help Italy take Trieste, but was open to the suggestion of sending heavy guns. The Anglo-French leadership agreed in early September to send 100 heavy guns to Italy, 50 of them from the French army on the left of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, C-in-C of the BEF, rather than the 300 which Lloyd George wanted. As the guns reached Italy, Cadorna called off his offensive (21 September).

Until the end of 1916, the French under Joffre had been the dominant allied army; after 1917 this was no longer the case, due to the vast number of casualties France&#x27;s armies had suffered in the now three and a half-year-old struggle with Germany.

The Supreme War Council was formally established on 7 November 1917, containing the Prime Minister and a Minister from each of the Western Front powers (i.e., excluding Russia), to meet at least once a month. Foch (along with Wilson and Italian general Cadorna) were appointed military representatives, to whom the general staffs of each country were to submit their plans. The French tried to have Foch as representative to increase their control over the Western Front (by contrast, Cadorna was disgraced after the recent Battle of Caporetto) and Wilson, a personal friend of Foch, was deliberately appointed as a rival to General Sir William Robertson, the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff, an ally of Haig&#x27;s, who had lost 250,000 men at the battle of Ypres the same year. Clemenceau was eventually persuaded to appoint Foch&#x27;s protégé Weygand instead, although many already suspected that Foch would eventually become the Allied Generalissimo.

Late in 1917 Foch would have liked to have seen Haig replaced as C-in-C of the BEF by General Herbert Plumer; however, Haig would remain in command of the BEF for the remainder of the war.

=== 1918 ===
In January 1918, in accordance with Lloyd George&#x27;s wishes, an executive board was set up to control the planned Allied General Reserve, with Clemenceau&#x27;s agreement being obtained by having Foch on the board rather than Maxime Weygand. Pétain agreed to release only eight French divisions and made a bilateral agreement with Haig, who was reluctant to release any divisions at all, to assist one another. The situation was worsened by Clemenceau&#x27;s and Pétain&#x27;s dislike of Foch. At a Supreme War Council meeting in London (14–15 March), with a German offensive clearly imminent, Foch protested to no avail for the formation of the Allied Reserve.

On the evening of 24 March, after the German spring offensive was threatening to split apart the British and French forces, Foch telegraphed Wilson (who by now had replaced Robertson as Chief of the Imperial General Staff) &quot;asking what [he] thought of situation &amp; we are of one mind that someone must catch a hold or we shall be beaten&quot;. Wilson reached France the following lunchtime. Pétain had sent a dozen divisions to plug the gap and it is unclear that a committee would actually have acted any faster during the immediate crisis. At the Doullens Conference (26 March) and at the Beauvais Conference (3 April), Foch was given the job of coordinating the activities of the Allied armies, forming a common reserve and using these divisions to guard the junction of the French and British armies and to plug the potentially fatal gap that would have followed a German breakthrough in the British Fifth Army sector. Two days later, while Foch was writing in his notebook, he allowed an interview to a group of war correspondents. At a later conference he was given the title Supreme Commander of the Allied Armies with the title of Généralissime (&quot;Supreme General&quot;). In May 1918, in the fifth session of the Supreme War Council, Foch was given authority over the Italian Front.

Foch controlled the Military Board of Allied Supply (MBAS), an Allied agency for the coordination of logistical support of the Allied forces. In March 1918 Colonel Charles G. Dawes, the general purchasing agent for the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) recommended to his commanding general John J. Pershing that a new intergovernmental agency was necessary to coordinate transportation and storage of military supplies in France. Pershing took the recommendation to French Premier Georges Clemenceau. The British were hesitant at first but finally the key players were in agreement and the Board was established in May 1918. It involved coordinating the entirely different supply systems for the American, British, and French armies, as well as the Italian and Belgian armies. It started operation from its base in Paris at the end of June. The president of the board was French general Jean-Marie Charles Payot (1868–1931), assisted by an international staff. Board decisions had to be unanimous, and once made were binding on all of the armies. However each army continued to be responsible for its own logistical system and procedures.

Foch was surprised by the German offensive (&quot;&quot;Bluecher&quot;&quot;) on the Chemin des Dames (27 May). Foch believed it was a diversion to draw Allied reserves away from Flanders. This was partly true, although the planned German Flanders Offensive (&quot;Hagen&quot;) never took place. The Allied armies under Foch&#x27;s command ultimately held the advance of the German forces. The celebrated phrase, &quot;I will fight in front of Paris, I will fight in Paris, I will fight behind Paris&quot;, attributed both to Foch and Clemenceau, illustrated the Généralissime&#x27;s resolve to keep the Allied armies intact, even at the risk of losing the capital. The British general Sir Henry Rawlinson, commanding the British Fourth Army, commented after meeting Foch: &quot;I am overjoyed at his methods and far-sighted strategy. I was in close touch with him in 1916. He is a better man now than he was then, for his fiery enthusiasm has been tempered by adversity.&quot; Rawlinson also noted Foch&#x27;s intense Frenchness: &quot;He knew nothing of Britain. The Rhine was for him a river of life and death.&quot;

At the sixth session of the Supreme War Council on 1 June Foch complained that the BEF was still shrinking in size and infuriated Lloyd George by implying that the British government was withholding manpower. At a major Allied conference at Beauvais (7 June) Lord Milner agreed with Clemenceau that Foch should have the power to order all Allied troops as he saw fit, over the protests of Haig who argued that it would reduce his power to safeguard the interests of the British Army.

The British were disappointed that Foch operated through his own staff rather than through the Permanent Military Representatives at Versailles, and on 11 July 1918 British ministers resolved to remind Foch that he was an Allied, and not a French, C-in-C. The Allies (mainly French and the growing American forces) counterattacked at the Second Battle of the Marne in July 1918. On 6 August 1918, Foch was made a Marshal of France. Along with the British commander, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, Foch planned the Grand Offensive, opening on 26 September 1918, which led to the defeat of Germany. After the war, he claimed to have defeated Germany by smoking his pipe. An unintended consequence of Foch&#x27;s appointment was that he sheltered Haig from British political interference.

Before the armistice and after the Armistice of Villa Giusti, Foch controlled all the operations against Germany including a planned invasion from Italy into Bavaria. Foch accepted the German cessation of hostilities in November from the German delegate, Matthias Erzberger, at 5:00 a.m. local time. However, he refused to accede to the German negotiators&#x27; immediate request to declare a ceasefire or truce so that there would be no more useless waste of lives among the common soldiers. By not declaring a truce even between the signing of the documents for the Armistice at 5:45 a.m. and its entry into force, &quot;at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month&quot;, about 11,000 additional men were needlessly wounded or killed – far more than usual, according to the military statistics.

On the day of the armistice, 11 November 1918, he was elected to the Académie des Sciences. Ten days later, he was unanimously elected to the Académie française. He received many honours and decorations from Allied governments.

== Assessments ==
In the euphoria of victory Foch was regularly compared to Napoleon and Julius Caesar. However, historians took a less favourable view of Foch&#x27;s talents as commander, particularly as the idea took root that his military doctrines had set the stage for the futile and costly offensives of 1914 in which French armies suffered devastating losses. Supporters and critics continue to debate Foch&#x27;s strategy and instincts as a commander, as well as his exact contributions to the Marne &quot;miracle&quot;: Foch&#x27;s counter-attacks at the Marne generally failed, but his sector resisted determined German attacks while holding the pivot on which the neighbouring French and British forces depended in rolling back the German line.

After the reading of the preamble of the November 1918 armistice, Foch left the carriage, in a move that was perceived as humiliating by the defeated Germans. In 1940, after the defeat of France by Germany early in World War II, when France signed an armistice with Germany, Adolf Hitler, in a calculated gesture of disdain to the French delegates, left the carriage, as Foch had done in 1918.

Foch&#x27;s pre-war contributions as a military theorist and lecturer have also been recognised, and he has been credited as &quot;the most original and subtle mind in the French Army&quot; of the early 20th century.

== Paris Peace Conference ==
In January 1919, at the Paris Peace Conference Foch presented a memorandum to the Allied plenipotentiaries in which he stated:

In a subsequent memorandum, Foch argued that the Allies should take full advantage of their victory by permanently weakening German power in order to prevent her from threatening France again:

Upon returning home. Foch wrote in his diary:

He later wrote:

However, the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the American President Woodrow Wilson objected to the detachment of the Rhineland from Germany so that the balance of power would not be too much in favour of France, but agreed to Allied military occupation for fifteen years, which Foch thought insufficient to protect France.

Foch considered the Treaty of Versailles to be &quot;a capitulation, a treason&quot; because he believed that only permanent occupation of the Rhineland would grant France sufficient security against a revival of German aggression. It is claimed that Foch said: &quot;This is not peace. It is an armistice for 20 years&quot;.

== Post-war career and legacy ==
Foch was made a British field marshal in 1919, and, for his advice during the Polish–Soviet War of 1920, as well as his pressure on Germany during the Greater Poland Uprising, he was awarded the title of Marshal of Poland in 1923.

On 1 November 1921 Foch was in Kansas City, Missouri, to take part in the groundbreaking ceremony for the Liberty Memorial that was being constructed there. Also present that day were Lieutenant General Baron Jacques of Belgium, Admiral David Beatty of Great Britain, General Armando Diaz of Italy and General John J. Pershing of the United States. One of the main speakers was Vice President Calvin Coolidge of the United States. The local veteran chosen to present flags to the commanders was a Kansas City haberdasher, Harry S. Truman, who would later serve as 33rd President of the United States from 1945 to 1953. In 1935, bas-reliefs of Foch, Jacques, Diaz and Pershing by sculptor Walker Hancock were added to the memorial.

Foch made a 3000-mile circuit through the American Midwest and industrial cities such as Pittsburgh and then on to Washington, D.C., which included ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery for what was then called Armistice Day. During the tour, he received numerous honorary degrees from American Universities.

In 1923, Foch retired from the French Army, having served a total of 55 years in uniform. His career began as the Lebel Model 1886 rifle had just entered service, and ended after Foch had commanded hundreds of thousands of soldiers in World War I.

On chemistry, he said, &quot;There is no science that is so nearly bound up with the future of our industrial and military forces. France will not remain indifferent to this branch of science that she has neglected for so long.&quot;

Foch died on 20 March 1929. He was buried in Les Invalides, next to Napoleon and other famous French soldiers and officers. Initially he was interred in the crypt of the Saint-Louis Church, or . In 1937 his remains were transferred to a monumental tomb sculpted by Paul Landowski, with inspiration from the 15th-century tomb of Philippe Pot, at the center of the Dome Church&#x27;s northeastern chapel ().

A statue of Foch was set up at the Compiègne Armistice site when the area was converted into a national memorial. This statue was the one item left undisturbed by the Germans following their defeat of France in June 1940. Following the signing of France&#x27;s surrender on 21 June, the Germans ravaged the area surrounding the railway car in which both the 1918 and 1940 surrenders had taken place. The statue was left standing, to view nothing but a wasteland. The Armistice site was restored by German prisoner-of-war labour following the Second World War, with its memorials and monuments either restored or reassembled.

In the 2022 film &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, Foch is portrayed by Thibault de Montalembert.

== Honours and awards ==
A heavy cruiser and an aircraft carrier were named in his honor. An early district of Gdynia, Poland was also named &quot;Foch&quot; after the Marshal but was renamed by the communist government after the Second World War. Nevertheless, one of the major avenues of the City of Bydgoszcz, located then in the Polish corridor, holds Foch&#x27;s name as sign of gratitude for his campaigning for an independent Poland. Avenue Foch, a street in Paris, was named after him. Several other streets have been named in his honor in Melbourne, Ypres, Lyon, Kraków, Chrzanów, Grenoble, Quito, Beirut, New Orleans, Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, Wynnum, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Mineola, New York, Queens, New York, Milltown, Shanghai (now part of Yan&#x27;a Road) and Singapore (Foch Road). A city quarter in the former French sector of Berlin is called Cité Foch in his honor. This is where French garrison soldiers were housed while Berlin was divided. Fochville in South Africa was also named in his honour. A statue of Foch stands near Victoria railway station in London. He is the only Frenchman ever to be made an honorary field-marshal by the British. A statue of Foch stands on the Bapaume-Peronne road, near the village of Bouchavesnes, at the point where Messimy&#x27;s &quot;chasseurs&quot; broke through on 12 September 1916. General Debeney spoke at the statue&#x27;s unveiling in 1926, praising Foch&#x27;s operational concepts of 1918. Foch also has a grape cultivar named after him. In the Belgian city of Leuven, one of the central squares was named after him after the First World War, but it was renamed in 2012. Mount Foch in Alberta is also named after him. The position of Marshal Foch Professor of French Literature at the University of Oxford was founded in 1918 shortly after the end of the First World War.

In the late 1920s, Foch Avenue in Mount Roskill, Auckland was named after him.

<doc id="331884" wikidata="Q2482717" url="?curid=331884" title="Particle horizon">
<text>The particle horizon (also called the cosmological horizon, the comoving horizon (in Scott Dodelson&#x27;s text), or the cosmic light horizon) is the maximum distance from which light from particles could have traveled to the observer in the age of the universe. Much like the concept of a terrestrial horizon, it represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the universe, so its distance at the present epoch defines the size of the observable universe. Due to the expansion of the universe, it is not simply the age of the universe times the speed of light (approximately 13.8 billion light-years), but rather the speed of light times the conformal time. The existence, properties, and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular cosmological model.

==Conformal time and the particle horizon==
In terms of comoving distance, the particle horizon is equal to the conformal time formula_1 that has passed since the Big Bang, times the speed of light formula_2. In general, the conformal time at a certain time formula_3 is given by

:formula_4

where formula_5 is the (dimensionless) scale factor of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric, and we have taken the Big Bang to be at formula_6. By convention, a subscript 0 indicates &quot;today&quot; so that the conformal time today formula_7. Note that the conformal time is &quot;not&quot; the age of the universe, which is estimated around formula_8. Rather, the conformal time is the amount of time it would take a photon to travel from where we are located to the furthest observable distance, provided the universe ceased expanding. As such, formula_9 is not a physically meaningful time (this much time has not yet actually passed); though, as we will see, the particle horizon with which it is associated is a conceptually meaningful distance.

The particle horizon recedes constantly as time passes and the conformal time grows. As such, the observed size of the universe always increases. Since proper distance at a given time is just comoving distance times the scale factor (with comoving distance normally defined to be equal to proper distance at the present time, so formula_10 at present), the proper distance to the particle horizon at time formula_3 is given by

:formula_12

and for today formula_13

:formula_14

==Evolution of the particle horizon==

In this section we consider the FLRW cosmological model. In that context, the universe can be approximated as composed by non-interacting constituents, each one being a perfect fluid with density formula_15, partial pressure formula_16 and state equation formula_17, such that they add up to the total density formula_18 and total pressure formula_19. Let us now define the following functions:

* Hubble function formula_20
* The critical density formula_21
* The &quot;i&quot;-th dimensionless energy density formula_22
* The dimensionless energy density formula_23
* The redshift formula_24 given by the formula formula_25

Any function with a zero subscript denote the function evaluated at the present time formula_26 (or equivalently formula_27). The last term can be taken to be formula_28 including the curvature state equation. It can be proved that the Hubble function is given by

:formula_29

where the dilution exponent formula_30. Notice that the addition ranges over all possible partial constituents and in particular there can be countably infinitely many. With this notation we have:

:formula_31

where formula_32 is the largest formula_33 (possibly infinite). The evolution of the particle horizon for an expanding universe (formula_34) is:

:formula_35

where formula_2 is the speed of light and can be taken to be formula_28 (natural units). Notice that the derivative is made with respect to the FLRW-time formula_3, while the functions are evaluated at the redshift formula_24 which are related as stated before. We have an analogous but slightly different result for event horizon.

==Horizon problem==

The concept of a particle horizon can be used to illustrate the famous horizon problem, which is an unresolved issue associated with the Big Bang model. Extrapolating back to the time of recombination when the cosmic microwave background (CMB) was emitted, we obtain a particle horizon of about

which corresponds to a proper size at that time of:

Since we observe the CMB to be emitted essentially from our particle horizon (formula_40), our expectation is that parts of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that are separated by about a fraction of a great circle across the sky of

(an angular size of formula_41) should be out of causal contact with each other. That the entire CMB is in thermal equilibrium and approximates a blackbody so well is therefore not explained by the standard explanations about the way the expansion of the universe proceeds. The most popular resolution to this problem is cosmic inflation.

<doc id="331887" wikidata="Q4818046" url="?curid=331887" title="Attacks on humanitarian workers">
<text>Humanitarian aid workers belonging to United Nations agencies, nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement are among the list of protected persons under international humanitarian law that grant them immunity from attack by belligerent parties. However, deliberate violence is the leading cause of death among aid workers, and attacks have become increasingly more frequent since 1997 when the Aid Worker Security Database (AWSD) began tracking them.
The number of aid workers attacked has increased from 260 in 2008 to 595 in 2023. For the first 20 years of the AWSD, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, and Syria were consistently the most dangerous places for aid workers to operate. Between 2013 and 2018, an average of 127 aid workers were killed, 120 injured, and 104 abducted worldwide per year. In November 2024, the UN reported that 281 aid workers had been killed that year, making 2024 the deadliest year on record; 175 of the deaths occurred in Gaza. Additionally the UN stated that 333 aid workers had been killed thus far in the Gaza War, the highest number recorded in a single crisis.

The most common causes of death among aid workers are shootings and air strikes, with road travel being particularly dangerous. A large contributor to violence against aid workers is kidnapping, though most end in release after negotiations. Motives for attacks on aid workers are often unknown, but of those that are known the cause is often political. Aid workers may be targeted for delivering aid to a population whom others do not wish aid to reach or for being seen as collaborating with an enemy group. During the War in Afghanistan, for example, there was an increase in politically motivated attacks, potentially because local residents stopped distinguishing between organisations who worked directly with the US military and those who did not.

==Legal basis for the protection of humanitarian workers==

The legal basis for the protection of humanitarian workers in armed conflicts is contained in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the related Protocols I and II of 1977. These treaties outline the rights and obligations of non-combatants who fulfill the criteria of protected persons during armed conflicts. These rights include the right to be treated humanely; to have access to food, water, shelter, medical treatment, and communications; to be free from violence to life and person, hostage taking, and humiliating or degrading treatment; and the prohibition against collective punishment or imprisonment. Protected persons include citizens and nationals of countries that are not a party to the conflict, except if such persons happen to be in the territory of a belligerent power, which maintains diplomatic relations with their home states.

While the Geneva Conventions guarantee protection for humanitarian workers, they do not guarantee access of humanitarian workers to affected areas: governments or occupying forces may, if they wish, ban a relief agency from working in their area. Médecins Sans Frontières was created in 1971 with the express purpose of ignoring this restriction, by providing assistance to populations affected by the Biafran civil war despite the prohibitions of the government of Nigeria.

In addition, the Geneva Conventions do not require that parties to the conflict guarantee the safety of humanitarian workers. The Conventions prohibit combatants from attacking protected persons, and they require occupying forces to maintain general order. However, the Conventions do not require that combating parties provide security escorts, for example, when other factions threaten the safety of protected persons operating in their area.

In 2003, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1502 giving greater protection to humanitarian workers and treating attacks on them as a war crime. ICRC promotes a framework for Neutral Independent Humanitarian Action (NIHA) to enable differentiated role understanding.

== Recording attacks on humanitarian workers ==
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Aid Worker Security Database is &quot;widely regarded as an authoritative reference for aid organisations and governments in assessing trends in security threats.&quot; A project of Humanitarian Outcomes, it receives funding from USAID. Since 1997, it has tracked incidents of violence such as abduction, killing, serious injury, and sexual assault but not safety incidents like vehicle crashes or accidental detonations during mine clearing projects. Aid workers are defined as employees and other staff of non-profit aid organizations providing humanitarian relief, such as the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, non-governmental organizations, UNDP, UNRWA, WHO, UNICEF, and other UN agencies. The database does not track attacks on UN peacekeepers, election monitors, or employees of advocacy organizations. 

Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED) is another database that includes attacks on humanitarian workers in addition to other conflict-related incidents. Insecurity Insight produces monthly &quot;Aid in Danger&quot; reports that highlight attacks during the month from news media, the AWSD and ACLED.

=== Summary of major incidents involving aid workers by country (1997–2023) ===
Major incidents recorded by the Aid Worker Security Database include killings, kidnappings, and attacks resulting in serious injury. The data is verified through December 31, 2023. A full list of major incidents from 1997 to the present, can be found on the organization&#x27;s website.
==Trends==
Accidents and illnesses contribute only a minority of reported aid worker deaths; the majority are caused by deliberate violence, most commonly 
shootings and air strikes. Road travel is by far the most dangerous context for aid workers, who can be attacked via ambushes, IEDs, or fake checkpoints. Others include raids and individual attacks.

A large contributor to violence against aid workers is abduction, though most are not fatal. On average, foreign aid workers are abducted for a longer period than local staff due to higher ransom demands from kidnappers. Previously, abduction was the highest cause of violence, after the number of kidnappings quadrupled between 2002 and 2012.

In 2008, 260 aid workers were attacked, the highest since the AWSD began in 1997. The record increased in 2011 when 308 aid workers were attacked. Between 2013 and 2018, an average of 127 aid workers were killed, 120 injured, and 104 abducted per year. Between 1997 and 2018, the countries with the greatest total number of attacks on aid workers were Afghanistan, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, and Syria. During the Global War on Terror, including the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan, the number of attacks in the Middle East and Central Africa grew. After the CIA used a sham polio vaccination program to locate and kill Osama bin Laden, violence against vaccination aid workers increased.

In 2019, the record for aid workers who were attacked increased again to 483. In 2023, 595 aid workers were attacked. 280 aid workers were killed in 33 countries,163 of which died in Gaza during the first three months of the Gaza War. The countries with the next highest number of deaths were South Sudan with 34 deaths and Sudan with 25. By November 2024, 281 aid workers had been killed, making 2024 the deadliest year for aid workers on record. 175 of the deaths occurred in Gaza. Additionally the UN stated that 333 aid workers had been killed thus far in the Gaza War, the highest number recorded in a single crisis.

== Motives ==
It is often hard to ascertain a motive for attacks on aid workers; for instance, in 55% of the incidents recorded by the AWSD in 2008, the motive was described as &quot;undetermined&quot;. However, of those that were determined, political motivations have increased (29% of the determined total in 2003 to 49% in 2008) relative to economic motivations, or when the victim&#x27;s status as an aid worker was only incidental. Aid workers can be targeted for political reasons both directly and by association. Sometimes the humanitarian organisation may be targeted for something that it has done or a statement it has made, or simply for the delivery of aid to a population, to whom others do not wish aid to reach. It can also be targeted as a result of being associated as an entity collaborating with a group or government seen as an enemy, leading humanitarian organizations to strive be seen as politically independent and neutral. However, evidence shows that this has little impact and instead that western aid agencies are perceived as an intrinsic part of western governments&#x27; agendas and not merely associated with it.

Afghanistan reflected this dynamic during the War on Terror when it was one of the most dangerous countries for humanitarian workers to operate. In 2007, 61% of incidents there were carried out by criminals and 39% by political opposition groups, but in 2008, 65% of incidents were the work of armed opposition groups. According to a 2009 report by Humanitarian Outcomes, this increase in politically motivated attacks may have occurred because Afghan locals stopped distinguishing between organisations who worked with the US military and those who did not, with the notable exception of the ICRC. In remote areas, humanitarian workers sometimes represented the only accessible western target. However, at least two studies did not find evidence indicating heightened aid worker insecurity in provinces where the US military was present.

<text>Peterson&#x27;s algorithm (or Peterson&#x27;s solution) is a concurrent programming algorithm for mutual exclusion that allows two or more processes to share a single-use resource without conflict, using only shared memory for communication. It was formulated by Gary L. Peterson in 1981. While Peterson&#x27;s original formulation worked with only two processes, the algorithm can be generalized for more than two.

== The algorithm ==
The algorithm uses two variables: codice_1 and codice_2. A codice_3 value of codice_4 indicates that the process codice_5 wants to enter the critical section. Entrance to the critical section is granted for process P0 if P1 does not want to enter its critical section or if P1 has given priority to P0 by setting codice_2 to codice_7.


The algorithm satisfies the three essential criteria to solve the critical-section problem. The while condition works even with preemption.

The three criteria are mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting.

Since codice_2 can take on one of two values, it can be replaced by a single bit, meaning that the algorithm requires only three bits of memory.

=== Mutual exclusion ===

P0 and P1 can never be in the critical section at the same time. If P0 is in its critical section, then codice_9 is true. In addition, either codice_10 is codice_11 (meaning that P1 has left its critical section), or codice_2 is codice_7 (meaning that P1 is just now trying to enter the critical section, but graciously waiting), or P1 is at label codice_14 (trying to enter its critical section, after setting codice_10 to codice_4 but before setting codice_2 to codice_7 and busy waiting). So if both processes are in their critical sections, then we conclude that the state must satisfy codice_9 and codice_10 and codice_21 and codice_22. No state can satisfy both codice_21 and codice_22, so there can be no state where both processes are in their critical sections.
(This recounts an argument that is made rigorous in Schneider 1997.)

=== Progress ===
Progress is defined as the following: if no process is executing in its critical section and some processes wish to enter their critical sections, then only those processes that are not executing in their remainder sections can participate in making the decision as to which process will enter its critical section next. Note that for a process or thread, the remainder sections are parts of the code that are not related to the critical section. This selection cannot be postponed indefinitely. A process cannot immediately re-enter the critical section if the other process has set its flag to say that it would like to enter its critical section.

=== Bounded waiting ===
Bounded waiting, or bounded bypass, means that the number of times a process is bypassed by another process after it has indicated its desire to enter the critical section is bounded by a function of the number of processes in the system. In Peterson&#x27;s algorithm, a process will never wait longer than one turn for entrance to the critical section.

=== Filter algorithm: Peterson&#x27;s algorithm for more than two processes ===

The filter algorithm generalizes Peterson&#x27;s algorithm to processes. Instead of a boolean flag, it requires an integer variable per process, stored in a single-writer/multiple-reader (SWMR) atomic register, and additional variables in similar registers. The registers can be represented in pseudocode as arrays:

 level : array of N integers
 last_to_enter : array of N − 1 integers

The variables take on values up to , each representing a distinct &quot;waiting room&quot; before the critical section. Processes advance from one room to the next, finishing in room , which is the critical section. Specifically, to acquire a lock, process executes

 i ← ProcessNo
 for ℓ from 0 to N − 1 exclusive
 level[i] ← ℓ
 last_to_enter[ℓ] ← i
 while last_to_enter[ℓ] = i and there exists k ≠ i, such that level[k] ≥ ℓ
 wait

To release the lock upon exiting the critical section, process sets to −1.

That this algorithm achieves mutual exclusion can be proven as follows. Process exits the inner loop when there is either no process with a higher level than , so the next waiting room is free; or, when , so another process joined its waiting room. At level zero, then, even if all processes were to enter waiting room zero at the same time, no more than will proceed to the next room, the final one finding itself the last to enter the room. Similarly, at the next level, will proceed, etc., until at the final level, only one process is allowed to leave the waiting room and enter the critical section, giving mutual exclusion.

Unlike the two-process Peterson algorithm, the filter algorithm does not guarantee bounded waiting.

==Note==
When working at the hardware level, Peterson&#x27;s algorithm is typically not needed to achieve atomic access. 
Some processors have special instructions, like test-and-set or compare-and-swap, which, by locking the memory bus, can be used to provide mutual exclusion in SMP systems.

Most modern CPUs reorder memory accesses to improve execution efficiency (see memory ordering for types of reordering allowed). Such processors invariably give some way to force ordering in a stream of memory accesses, typically through a memory barrier instruction. Implementation of Peterson&#x27;s and related algorithms on processors that reorder memory accesses generally requires use of such operations to work correctly to keep sequential operations from happening in an incorrect order. Note that reordering of memory accesses can happen even on processors that don&#x27;t reorder instructions (such as the PowerPC processor in the Xbox 360).

Most such CPUs also have some sort of guaranteed atomic operation, such as codice_25 on x86 processors and load-link/store-conditional on Alpha, MIPS, PowerPC, and other architectures. These instructions are intended to provide a way to build synchronization primitives more efficiently than can be done with pure shared memory approaches.

<doc id="331896" wikidata="Q197889" url="?curid=331896" title="Zhongnanhai">
<text>Zhongnanhai () is a compound that houses the offices of and serves as a residence for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the State Council. It was a former imperial garden, and is located adjacent to the Forbidden Palace in Beijing. The term &quot;Zhongnanhai&quot; is often used as a metonym for China&#x27;s central government and its leadership at large.

The state leaders, including the president, general secretary of the CCP, and other top party and state leadership figures carry out many of their day-to-day administrative activities inside the compound, such as meetings with foreign dignitaries. China Central Television (CCTV) frequently shows footage of meetings inside the compound, but limits its coverage largely to views of the interior of buildings. Though numerous maps of the complex exist from before the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the interior layout of Zhongnanhai has been altered significantly since then, including a wave of major renovations in the 1970s. Today many buildings share the names of older, pre-PRC structures, but have completely changed in layout and purpose. The complex is divided into two main sections, reflecting the parallel authority of the highest level of state and party institutions in the country. Northern Zhongnanhai is used as the headquarters of the State Council and includes the offices of its senior most leaders as well as its principal meeting rooms. Southern Zhongnanhai is the headquarters of the CCP Central Committee, including its staff and its highest level coordinating institutions, such as the Standing Committee, Politburo and Secretariat.

The current basic outline of Zhongnanhai emerged during the Ming dynasty when the Yongle Emperor began a project to subdivide and reclaim land around Taiye Lake in order to create a garden retreat. By the late Qing dynasty, Zhongnanhai was used as the de facto center of government, with Empress Dowager Cixi and later Prince Regent Chun building residences there instead of the Forbidden City. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the new president, Yuan Shikai remodeled Zhongnanhai to become the formal center of what would become known as the Beiyang Government. In late 1949, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong moved into the complex after initially staying in the suburbs. Mao received many important foreign leaders in Zhongnanhai, including Nikita Khrushchev, Che Guevara, Richard Nixon, Georges Pompidou, Kakuei Tanaka and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, among others. Mao&#x27;s favorite places in Zhongnanhai were the Library of Chrysanthemum Fragrance (his personal residence, filled with bookshelves) and the Poolside House, next to the large indoor swimming pool, where he would spend much of the day swimming or reading books and reports by the pool. After Mao&#x27;s death, the Chrysanthemum Library along with many of his belongings was preserved as a museum which is no longer accessible to the general public.

==Location==
The name of the Zhongnanhai complex, immediately west of the Forbidden City, means &quot;Central and Southern Seas&quot; referring to two lakes, the Central Sea (中海) and Southern Sea (南海), within the compound; it is sometimes translated as &quot;Sea Palaces&quot;. The two lakes were part of a series of projects carried out during the construction of the Imperial City. The corresponding &quot;Northern Sea&quot;, or &quot;Beihai&quot; (北海) to the north is now a public park. The interconnected Northern, Central and Southern Seas are jointly called the Taiye Lake (太液池); adjacent Shichahai (什剎海, ) is connected to Beihai through Qianhai.

The Taiye Lake originally formed the core of an imperial garden called Western Park (&quot;Xiyuan&quot;; 西苑) or Western Court (&quot;Xinei&quot;; ), with parklands on the shores, enclosed by a red wall in the western part of the Imperial City. Most of the pavilions, shrines, and temples survive from this period. Whereas the Northern Sea had a religious focus, the shores of Central and Southern Seas were dotted with a number of worldly palaces.

==History==


During the Jin dynasty (1115–1235), Emperor Zhangzong of Jin built the northern lake in 1189. The northern section of Zhongnanhai was the original Taiye Lake, with an attached palace called the &quot;Palace of Great Peace&quot; (&quot;Daninggong&quot;). During the Yuan dynasty, which lasted from 1271 to 1368, Taiye Lake was included within the Imperial City. It was also expanded, covering approximately the area occupied by the Northern and Central Seas today. Three new palaces were built around the lake.

After the Ming dynasty moved its capital to Beijing in 1403 by order of the Yongle Emperor, construction of the now extant Imperial Palace began in 1406. The new Ming palace was built to the south of the Yuan dynastic palace, as a result, a new Southern Sea was dug to the south of the existing lake. The excavated soil, together with that from the construction of the palace moat, was piled up to form Jingshan, a hill to the north of the Forbidden City. At this time, the three lakes were connected through channels and collectively called the Taiye Lake, part of the extensive royal park called &quot;Xiyuan&quot; (西苑, &quot;Western Park&quot;) that extended from the western wall of the Imperial City to the western wall of the Forbidden City. In the middle period of the Ming dynasty, Zhengde Emperor and Jiajing Emperor built many more palaces, Taoist temples and pavilions around the lakes and spent more time here rather than in the Forbidden City.

After the Qing dynasty established its capital in Beijing, the government reduced the size of Xiyuan to the area centered around the three lakes enclosed by a small wall, portions of which form the basis of Zhongnanhai&#x27;s current boundary. During the late Qing dynasty, several gatehouses were built on both sides of Jin&#x27;ao Yudong Bridge[Chinese Wikipedia], giving Zhongnanhai and Beihai Park separate wall enclosures within Xiyuan. Several successive emperors built pavilions and houses along the lakeshores of Zhongnanhai, where they would carry out government duties in the summer. During the reign of the Empress Dowager Cixi, both the Empress Dowager and the Emperor would often live in the Zhongnanhai compound, traveling to the Forbidden City only for ceremonial duties.

During the Boxer Rebellion of 1899–1901, allied troops occupied Zhongnanhai. Almost all artifacts and decorations in the compound were looted. Later, the Eight-Nation Alliance commander also lived in Zhongnanhai. When Puyi was crowned Emperor, his father as the Prince Regent lived for a short time in the compound.

Zhongnanhai continued to be politically significant during the first years of the Republic of China, as the Beiyang Government under Yuan Shikai placed its presidential palace in the Zhongnanhai compound from 1912. This decision was made because the regime wished to house its government close to the historical center of power, the Forbidden City, even though it could not use the Forbidden City itself because the abdicated Emperor Puyi still lived there. The current main gate, Xinhua Gate or &quot;Gate of New China&quot;, was created by Yuan Shikai. The present &quot;gatehouse&quot; was previously a pavilion located on the southern shore the Southern Sea, close to the southern wall. Entry to the compound was instead directly from the Forbidden City. Yuan wished to create a new entrance from Chang&#x27;an Avenue, independent of the Forbidden City. Thus the pavilion was modified to become a gatehouse, with nearby walls cut back, resulting in the angled walls near the entrance today. Yuan renamed Zhongnanhai Palace of the New China (&quot;Xinhua Palace&quot;, ) during his brief reign as Emperor of China. When the Republic of China government moved its capital to Nanjing, the Zhongnanhai compound was opened to the public as a park.

After the CCP&#x27;s Capture of Beijing in 1949, the party&#x27;s senior leadership began plans to relocate their headquarters to the old capital, but they did not initially agree on the location of their central workplace. Mao and the other party leaders initially made their headquarters at Xiangshan Park, in the city&#x27;s suburbs. As part of the planning for the first Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference Zhou Enlai decided that, with some modifications, Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai would be ideal, but he did not initially recommend it during meetings to become the party headquarters. In these early months, Zhou would commute into Beijing for work. However, because of the poor quality of the roads, he would often stay at Zhongnanhai instead of traveling home in the evening. It was Ye Jianying, the interim administrator of Beijing, who ultimately recommended Zhongnanhai as the party headquarters for security reasons. Mao initially refused to move into Zhongnanhai because of its imperial associations. Zhou Enlai nonetheless agreed to the move, as did the majority of the Politburo. Since then, Zhongnanhai has served as the principal center of government in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

When the CCP leaders first moved into the compound, many of the buildings were dilapidated and gardens overgrown from years of neglect. Zhongnanhai also lacked either a modern administrative office complex or a purpose-built auditorium for government meetings. These deficiencies prompted the construction of &quot;West Building&quot; compound and the complete remodeling of &quot;Huairen Hall&quot; by 1954, along with numerous other architectural changes. Early party and state laters were assigned residences in Zhongnanhai on an ad hoc basis, often using houses built for servants of the Qing court, or by repurposing buildings intended for other purposes.

=== In contemporary times ===

Since Zhongnanhai became the central government compound, it has been mostly inaccessible to the general public. The exception to this was during the years of relative freedom following the end of the Cultural Revolution, when the compound was open to members of the public, who could obtain tickets to visit the compound from relevant government authorities. Following the political turmoil that culminated in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, security was greatly increased. Access has now been closed to the general public, with numerous plain clothed military personnel patrolling the area on foot. However, cars are not strictly prohibited from stopping on stretches of adjacent roadway and cabs are allowed to stop except during important conferences or events. Chinese maps of Beijing show Zhongnanhai as an insignificant green area with a water body; in contrast, the municipal government, however, is shown significantly with a red star.

The most important entrance to the compound is the southern one at Xinhuamen (Xinhua Gate, or &quot;Gate of New China&quot;), surrounded by two slogans: &quot;long live the great Chinese Communist Party&quot; and &quot;long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.&quot; The view behind the entrance is shielded by a traditional screen wall with the slogan &quot;Serve the People&quot;, written in the handwriting of Mao Zedong. The Xinhuamen entrance lies on the north side of West Chang&#x27;an Avenue.

Zhongnanhai is considered the &quot;de jure&quot; residence of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee members and other senior leaders for electoral purposes. Though it serves as their formal residence, many senior party leaders do not actually live in Zhongnanhai, preferring to live in homes elsewhere in the city. Several more recent leaders, such as then General Secretary and paramount leader Hu Jintao reportedly chose to live in the Jade Spring Hill compound in western Beijing due to overcrowding inside Zhongnanhai. China&#x27;s current leader Xi Jinping also has a home in Jade Spring Hill. There continues to be no standardized system for awarding certain houses to leaders of a certain rank in Zhongnanhai. After a senior leader&#x27;s death, their spouse is often permitted to stay in the house indefinitely. Several of these houses were occupied by the families of their original post-revolution residents into the 1990s.

== Internal layout ==
=== Central Sea ===
The buildings around the &quot;Central Sea&quot; () constitute the headquarters of the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and its affiliate institutions, including the offices of the premier and the vice premiers as well as the State Council General Office. Important guests, both foreign and domestic, are typically received here in the northern half of Zhongnanhai. This area is also known as the &quot;North District&quot; ().

==== Regent Palace ====
The original &quot;Regent Palace&quot; () was a large siheyuan-style mansion that took up most of the northwestern corner of Zhongnanhai. Though most of the building no longer exists, it is now the site of the principal meeting areas and offices of the State Council. The large three story building that occupies much the south western area of the former Regent Palace is the location of the State Council Office Secretariat, which facilitates the State Council&#x27;s plenary sessions. Altogether, the State Council possesses a total of six numbered meeting rooms which are used to convene conferences and policymaking sessions. Conference rooms one and two are located on either side of a thirty-meter corridor which is used for informational exhibits and displays relevant to State Council activities. This corridor is located at the south end of the former Regent Palace area. Both the full State Council and the weekly meetings of the State Council Standing Committee are convened in conference room number one.

During the Ming dynasty, the Jiajing Emperor built Wanshou Palace in this area as his main living palace within Zhongnanhai. Nothing remained of this palace by the late Qing era, however. The building that came to be known as Regent Palace took its name from Puyi&#x27;s regent Zaifeng, Prince Chun. Prince Chun was given the land to build his palace here in 1909, though the building was not completed by the time the Qing dynasty ended in 1911. Under the Republic of China, the building was initially the location of the prime minister&#x27;s office and the meeting place of the cabinet. In 1918, President Xu Shichang switched the president&#x27;s residence and the prime minister&#x27;s office, relocating his residence to Regent Palace, while the prime minister and Cabinet moved to Dianxu Hall in the Garden of Abundant Beneficence. When Huairen Hall became the Presidential residence in 1923, Regent Palace became the location of the army and naval department.

After 1949, the People&#x27;s Republic of China again used the building as the headquarters of the premier and the State Council. Though the building was beginning to show its age at the time, initially Premier Zhou Enlai resisted renovation efforts citing a commitment to fiscal austerity. During a massive renovation of Zhongnanhai in the late 1970s, plans were made to modernize Regent palace as well. It was found, however, that the quality of the building was very poor, the foundations were loose and the gaps between the wooden columns were filled with broken bricks. As a result, the upper and entrance halls were torn down and rebuilt completely. The location where these halls once stood is currently the location of several of the State Council&#x27;s conference rooms.

====West Flower Hall====
Located in the northwestern corner of Zhongnanhai, &quot;West Flower Hall&quot; () was constructed as the living quarters to Regent Palace. West Flower Hall hence served as Premier Zhou Enlai&#x27;s personal residence. The building has two courtyards. The front courtyard was where Zhou would meet and dine with foreign guests, while the back courtyard included Zhou&#x27;s personal office, bedroom and meeting rooms. After Zhou&#x27;s death, his wife Deng Yingchao continued to live here until 1990. Immediately adjoining to West Flower Hall is the slightly smaller &quot;East Flower Hall&quot; (), which became the residence of Vice Premier Li Xiannian in the mid-1950s. East Flower Hall once had a rockery courtyard that was the location of one of the State Council&#x27;s conference rooms during the Zhou Enlai era.

During the large scale demolition and redevelopment of Regent Palace, Wang Dongxing built a large house adjacent to both West and East Flower Halls for Paramount Leader Hua Guofeng. When Hua Guofeng was forced from power, he exchanged this house with Li Xiannian and moved to Li Xiannian&#x27;s temporary residence outside of Zhongnanhai. Li Xiannian and his family subsequently lived here through his presidency until his death, after which, his wife Lin Jiamei continued to occupy the residence. In 1996, Li Peng attempted to claim West Flower Hall as his post premiership residence. Li Peng was motivated in part by the relationship he had with Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao as their foster son. Li Peng&#x27;s efforts were unsuccessful, however, and West Flower Hall subsequently became part of the &quot;North Courtyard Core&quot; () residence assigned to Lin Jiamei. Lin Jiamei was reportedly still living here as late as 2014.

====Premier&#x27;s Office====

The modern workplace of the premier and the vice premiers of the State Council, the &quot;Premier&#x27;s Office&quot; () was built during the large scale renovation of Regent Palace in the 1970s. Unlike the offices of CCP officials in the West Building Compound, which are assigned to specific individuals and do not necessarily change if the individual loses their title or role, the offices of the premier and vice premier are assigned specifically to the incumbent holders of those positions and their occupants must move out when their term ends. The premier&#x27;s office does not have a front gate and courtyard like other buildings in the former Regent Palace area, instead featuring a covered access ramp. Immediately to the south is a building that serves as the headquarters for the State Council General Office.

==== Fourth Conference Room ====

The State Council&#x27;s &quot;Fourth Conference Room&quot; () is located in a building specifically dedicated to this purpose. It is used for meetings between State Council officials and specially invited persons who are often not affiliated with the government. There is a large traditional Chinese gate and courtyard in front of the fourth conference room that is used for photo opportunities between State Council officials and their guests. In Regent Palace&#x27;s original configuration as built by Prince Chun, the area where the fourth conference room is located was known as &quot;Yin&#x27;an Hall&quot; (). The Fourth Conference Room was last rebuilt in 2003.

==== Ziguang Hall====
Literally translated as Hall of Purple Light (&quot;Ziguangge&quot;; ), &quot;Ziguang Hall&quot; is a two-storey pavilion located on the northern west bank of the Central Sea. Immediately behind Ziguang Hall is another pavilion called &quot;Wucheng Hall&quot; () which connects to Ziguang Hall to form a courtyard. In the Ming dynasty, it was originally a platform built by the Zhengde Emperor for military exercise. His successor, the Jiajing Emperor, built Ziguang Hall here as a replacement for the platform. The building was rebuilt during the Qing dynasty by the Kangxi Emperor, who would use the location to inspect his bodyguards. During the reign of the Qianlong Emperor the building was used to display battle wall charts and seized weapons. The building was also known as the Hall of Barbarian Tributes and was used to receive tribute missions to the Emperor. In 1873 and 1891, the emperors Tongzhi and Guangxu, respectively, received envoys from the foreign legations in Beijing, in the hall. After 1949 the building was occasionally used for dances. A large modern conference area was later built on the building&#x27;s western side. Ziguang Hall is used today as the main reception area in Zhongnanhai for meeting with foreign diplomats and conducting talks with world leaders. Wucheng Hall is often used for photo opportunities in which a Chinese leader will be pictured sitting alongside their visiting counterpart.

The &quot;State Council Auditorium&quot; () is connected to the western side of Ziguang Hall. In the early years after 1949, the State Council Auditorium was used as a movie theatre which held showings several times a week. The building also formerly served as the canteen for State Council staff. This auditorium was updated to its present form in 1979 and is primarily used for ceremonies and conferences on specific policy issues. The plenary sessions of the full State Council are also occasionally convened here as well.

Immediately adjacent to Ziguang Hall are a variety of other institutions and facilities such as the State Council Research Office and the Zhongnanhai north district&#x27;s canteen. Between 2003 and 2013, there was also a roughly 300-square-meter supermarket store belonging to the Sichuan-based Hongqi chain located near Ziguang Hall.

====Tennis Court====
Initial plans to build an indoor tennis court in the State Council section of Zhongnanhai were made in the late 1980s. At the time China was receiving a significant influx of new diplomatic delegations on international exchange trips. Feeling that the facilities for hosting these diplomats at Ziguang Hall at the time were inadequate, some officials proposed that a guest lounge and tennis court be built nearby. The proposal for an indoor tennis court was, at the time, vetoed by Vice Premier Tian Jiyun. In spite of this initial resistance, an outdoor tennis court was built in Zhongnanhai by the early 2000s. In 2006, the building around the tennis court was rebuilt and modernized. Immediately to the north of the tennis court is the Zhongnanhai clinic.

====Indoor Pool====
An indoor swimming pool was built in 1955 by the Urban Construction and Design Institute. Mao Zedong&#x27;s wife Jiang Qing reportedly proposed the building&#x27;s construction during Mao&#x27;s absence in order to secure its approval. Mao nonetheless used the pool because it was more convenient than traveling to the pool at Tsinghua University. Mao often stayed and worked at the pool for long periods of time. In 1958, Mao met with Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev at the pool. During the time when Mao lived nearby at Poolside House, the indoor swimming pool was remodeled and enlarged under the supervision of Zhongnanhai&#x27;s head engineer Tian Genggui. Today the pool is used by senior party leaders and also contains a workout area.

==== Poolside House ====
The Zhongnanhai outdoor swimming pool was built in 1933 as a public–private partnership when Zhongnanhai was a public park. Tickets were sold to Beijing citizens each year from May to August. From 1946 to 1949, it was difficult to operate the pool profitably due to high inflation. After Zhongnanhai was taken over for the exclusive use of the government, a poolside house was built next to the swimming pool as a residence for Mao Zedong. It was initially built for practical reasons, as Mao would frequently spend much of the day either swimming in the pool or reading political and historical books and reports from government officials by the pool&#x27;s side. Therefore, a reception room, a bedroom and a study with Mao&#x27;s favorite books were built, thus creating the Poolside House which allowed Mao to be permanently close to the swimming pool. Eventually, among Zhongnanhai staff, the phrase &quot;you are wanted at the swimming pool&quot; meant that they were ordered to immediately report to Mao.

Mao permanently left the Chrysanthemum Library and moved into the Poolside House in 1966, at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. Especially in his later years, the Poolside House would be the place for visiting foreign leaders to see Mao. This was the case for Richard Nixon and Kakuei Tanaka. After Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, Zhou Enlai&#x27;s wife Deng Yingchao briefly lived at poolside house during the extensive redevelopment of the Regent Palace area before returning to West Flower Hall. During the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests, President Yang Shangkun moved into Zhongnanhai and lived at Poolside House due to security concerns created by the protesters.

====Yanqing House====
&quot;Yanqing House&quot; (), as well as several other adjoining buildings, was built during the Beiyang Government around 1922. During his time as de facto ruler of the Beiyang Government, Cao Kun used Yanqing House as his workplace while living in nearby Huairen Hall. His wives and concubines lived in several of the adjoining buildings. After Cao Kun was overthrown in 1924, he was imprisoned in Yanqing House for two years. The original Yanqing House was ultimately destroyed in a fire in 1947. The KMT military commander of Beiping, Fu Zuoyi, subsequently built a series of small bungalows in this location to house military and political personnel. By the early 2000s, a one-story building with two courtyards existed on the former site of Yanqing House. The building was sometimes referred to as &quot;Yanqingzhai&quot; ().

==== Wan Shan Temple ====
Also known in English as Thousand Benevolence Hall (), &quot;Wan Shan&quot; is a Buddhist Temple located on the eastern bank of the Central Sea. Originally known as &quot;Chongzhi Hall&quot;, the temple was built by the Qing dynasty&#x27;s Shunzhi Emperor. Statues of the Buddha line the hall. Behind the temple is &quot;Thousand Sage Hall&quot;, which includes a dome and a seven-story pagoda.

==== Water Clouds Pavilion ====
Located on an island in the Central Sea, the &quot;Water Clouds Pavilion&quot; contains a stele engraved by the Qianlong Emperor reading &quot;Autumn Wind on the Taiye Lake&quot;.

=== Southern Sea ===
The &quot;Southern Sea&quot; (&quot;Nanhai&quot;, ) compound is the headquarters of the CCP, including the office of the general secretary and the offices of the staff of the Central Committee General Office. Southern Zhongnanhai also includes the meeting places for the Politburo, Standing Committee and Secretariat. This area is also known as the &quot;South District&quot; ().

====Huairen Hall====

&quot;Huairen Hall&quot; () is a two-story Chinese-style hall that is used by the CCP as the main meeting place for the Politburo and as an alternate meeting place for the Politburo Standing Committee. The building is also the meeting location of several of the CCP&#x27;s leading groups such as the Financial and Economic Affairs Leading Group and the Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms.

The building served as the daily workplace of Dowager Empress Cixi, the then de facto ruler of China, replacing the Hall of Mental Cultivation in the nearby Forbidden City. After the Boxer rebellion, Huairen Hall became the headquarters of the occupying Eight Nation Alliance&#x27;s commander Alfred von Waldersee until the building was damaged in a fire. In 1902 Empress Cixi rebuilt Huairen Hall at a cost of five million taels of silver before ultimately dying here in 1908. After the founding of the Republic of China in 1911, President Yuan Shikai used the building to meet with foreign guests and to accept New Year&#x27;s Day greetings. After Yuan&#x27;s death, it was the site of his funeral. When Cao Kun became president, he used Huairen Hall as his residence. After the end of the Beiyang Government Huairen Hall had no permanent use and was given to the Beijing City Government.

After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the first plenary session of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was held in Huairen Hall in September 1949. In order to serve as an audience hall for the CPPCC, an iron sheet roof was built over one of the building&#x27;s courtyards. In 1952, this roof was replaced with a more permanent two-story auditorium in preparation for the Asia-Pacific Peace Conference. The new meeting hall was then used for first session of the National People&#x27;s Congress in 1954. Huairen Hall became the auditorium of the central government, often hosting various art shows and political meetings, including Central Committee plenums before the construction of Jingxi Hotel in 1964.

====Qinzheng Hall====
&quot;Qinzheng Hall&quot; () is the headquarters of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party and the location of the office of the party&#x27;s general secretary, a title currently synonymous with the paramount leader of the country. The building also includes a conference room that serves as the main meeting place for the Politburo Standing Committee. The room that the Politburo Standing Committee meets in is referred to as the &quot;small meeting room&quot; and is located along the corridor on the northern side of Qinzheng Hall. The small meeting room is also a meeting place for the secretaries of the CCP Secretariat.

The general secretary&#x27;s personal office is located behind an office which, in the 1980s, served as workplace of his policy secretary. The office of the policy secretary was occupied by Secretary Bao Tong at the time, and the position and staff associated with it have since been more formalized as the Office of the General Secretary. The policy secretary&#x27;s office is, in turn, behind another office which served as a workplace for the director of the Central Committee&#x27;s General Office. It is partially because the head of the General Office has a workplace in front of the office suite of the general secretary that the director&#x27;s position is referred to as the &quot;Danei Zongguan&quot; (), roughly translated as &quot;the gatekeeper&quot;.

In addition to the General Secretary&#x27;s suite, Qinzheng Hall is also the location of the offices for all of Secretaries of the Secretariat, including the First Secretary of the Secretariat, who has de facto responsibility for the secretariat&#x27;s day-to-day administration of the party. Each secretarial suite in Qinzheng Hall has a space for receiving guests and a space for working. The General Secretary&#x27;s suite is comparatively larger and has the most complete facilities in the building, including a sleeping space so that the General Secretary does not need to return to his residence when working for long periods of time. There is an encrypted hotline that runs from Qinzheng Hall to the White House in Washington, D.C. for the purpose of conducting high level talks with American leaders.

The original Qinzheng hall was built by the Kangxi Emperor as the main hall of the Zhongnanhai complex, serving as the Emperor&#x27;s primary living and working space in Zhongnanhai. After the 1911 revolution, the building served as a venue for government conferences during both the Republic of China and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Qinzheng Hall served as the meeting place for the Central People&#x27;s Government Committee, the interim council that governed China from 1949 until the promulgation of the 1954 Constitution. While serving as the headquarters of the Central People&#x27;s Government, Qinzheng hall was the site of the 1951 Seventeen Points Agreement which established the terms under which Tibet would come under the sovereignty of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In the late 1970s, Wang Dongxing, the director of the Central Committee General Office, demolished Qinzheng hall and spent 6.9 million yuan intended for its reconstruction to build his own private residence. Wang&#x27;s removal as head of the Central Committee General Office in 1978 prevented him from completing his plan. Ultimately, the rebuilt Qinzheng hall was inaugurated as the Secretariat&#x27;s new headquarters in March 1980.

====Benevolence Hall====
The former &quot;Benevolence Hall&quot; () was a two-story western-style palace originally known as the Hall of the Calm Sea (&quot;Haiyantang&quot;) during the Qing dynasty. Dowager Empress Cixi had the building constructed to entertain her female guests, and also to receive foreign diplomats. After the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion, Eight Nation Alliance commander Alfred von Waldersee moved here after Yi Luang Temple was destroyed in a fire. After the founding of the Republic of China, the building was renamed the &quot;Hall of Benevolence&quot; (&quot;Jurentang&quot; or &quot;Jerenteng&quot;), by Yuan Shikai, who continued to use it to host visitors. Benevolence Hall became the headquarters of KMT commander Li Zongren after the defeat and withdrawal of the Japanese Army and later the command of post of General Fu Zuoyi before his surrender to the CCP.

After 1949, the building served as the first headquarters of the Central Military Commission (CMC) before the CMC staff relocated outside of Zhongnanhai. In 1956, the CCP Secretariat became an institution separate from the staff of the party chairman and required its own headquarters. The new general secretary, Deng Xiaoping, chose Benevolence Hall to house the Secretariat. During this period, the building did not undergo any significant maintenance and was finally deemed unsafe and demolished in 1964. The Secretariat offices temporarily moved to &quot;Building C&quot; in the West Building Compound before moving to &quot;Qinzheng Hall&quot; in 1980. The former location of Benevolence Hall is currently an open park area.

====Four Blessing Halls====
The &quot;Four Blessing Halls&quot; (), which date from the time of the Qianlong Emperor, line the eastern side of a narrow lane that once formed a western boundary of Zhongnanhai. All four are named according to a consistent theme and are consequently known as &quot;Yongfutang&quot; (永福堂), &quot;Laifutang&quot; (來福堂), &quot;Zengfutang&quot; (增福堂), and &quot;Xifutang&quot; (錫福堂). After 1949, the buildings were used as residences for several important early party officials, particularly those that did propaganda and ideological work. The PRC&#x27;s first Defense Minister Peng Dehuai lived at Yongfutang, the building closest to Huairen Hall, until being purged in 1959. In the early days of the PRC, an informal school called the &quot;Zhongnanhai Amateur University&quot; was run out of this location for the benefit of the Central Committee&#x27;s secretaries and security staff. The school still de facto exists, but in practice has merged with the Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute. In 1982, Yongfutang became the headquarters of the administrative office of the Central Advisory Commission (CAC) due to the location&#x27;s convenient proximity to where CAC Standing Committee meetings were held at Huairen Hall. Laifutang was the location of a commemorative post-funeral ceremony for the late General Secretary Jiang Zemin&#x27;s cremated remains.

====West Building Compound====

The complex of buildings known as &quot;West Building Compound&quot; () is named for its location in the southwestern corner of Zhongnanhai. The first of these buildings was built by the engineering battalion of the Central Guard Regiment from 1949 to 1951 to house workplaces and apartments for the Central Committee General Office&#x27;s staff. West Building is one of the workplaces of the Director of the Central Committee General Office, in addition to Qinzheng Hall. One of the original main buildings in this complex was simply called &quot;West Building Hall&quot; () while the other buildings in the West Building complex were designated A, B, C, D and F. Buildings C and D were originally intended to be used as accommodations for Provincial Communist Party Committee Secretaries when they were visiting Beijing for meetings. Many of the Mishus or secretarial staff assigned to support the General Office work within the West Building Compound. As late as the 1990s, West Building Compound included a dormitory for the young workers of the Center Committee General Office. The West Building includes a large kitchen and cafeteria for the General Office staff and a smaller eating area that doubles as a conference room for the use of senior leadership. The formal address of West Building Compound is 12 Fuyou Street, Xicheng District, Beijing.

After West Building was constructed, the complex became the site of the offices of the State Chairman, Premier and all state Vice Chairmen under the Common Program who were also Communist Party members. When the positions of the State Chairman and Chairman of the Communist Party were separated in 1959 and Liu Shaoqi assumed the State Chairmanship, the State Chairman&#x27;s workplace continued to be located in West Building. Building A was originally intended as the residence and workplace of Mao Zedong, but because he had become used to living in the Chrysanthemum Library, he refused to move into the building. Consequently, Building A became the residence and workplace of state Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi in 1950. Likewise, Marshal Zhu De&#x27;s office remained in Building B of the West Building compound when he served as singular state Vice Chairman under the 1954 Constitution. In 1962, President Liu Shaoqi presided over an extraordinary, enlarged meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee in this location, known as the &quot;West Building Meeting&quot;. At the meeting, the party leaders discussed in significant detail the dire fiscal and economic situation in the country in the aftermath of the failure of the Great Leap Forward and promised to recover the agricultural sector.

Between 2007 and 2008, part of the original West Building Compound was demolished to make way for a new three-story rectangular building that was completed by 2010. The Central Committee General Office&#x27;s physical office footprint has now expanded beyond Zhongnanhai to include several buildings on the other side of Fuyou Street from West Building as well as other buildings in the Xicheng District area. The gate on Fuyou Street that Central Committee staff use to travel between buildings inside and outside of the complex is called the &quot;Great West Gate&quot; because it has the highest regular use of Zhongnanhai&#x27;s gates.

Many of the agencies directly under the supervision of the Central Committee General Office now have their formal headquarters in an annex of buildings spread out on the western side of Fuyou Street adjacent to Zhongnanhai as well as certain locations still within southern Zhongnanhai. The formal addresses of these agencies are as follows:

*Research Office: 8 Fuyou Street, Xicheng District, Beijing
*Secretary Bureau: 1 Boxue Hutong, Xicheng District, Beijing
*Bureau of Regulations: 99 Fuyou Street, Xicheng District, Beijing
*Security Bureau: 81 Nanchang Street, Xicheng District, Beijing (Shuqingyuan Pavilion)
*Confidential Bureau: 7 Dianchang Road, Fengtai District, Beijing
*Confidential Transportation Bureau: 11 Xihuangchenggen North Street, Xicheng District, Beijing
*Special Accounting Office: 14 Fuyou Street, Xicheng District, Beijing
*Supervision and Inspection Office: Unknown location, Beijing
*Personnel Bureau: 12 Fuyou Street, Xicheng District, Beijing (West Building Compound proper)
*Office of the General Secretary: Qinzheng Hall, Xicheng District, Beijing
*Veterans Bureau: 50 Dajue Hutong, Xicheng District, Beijing
*Administration Bureau of Organs directly under the Central Committee: 9 Xihuangchenggen North Street, Xicheng District, Beijing

====Garden of Abundant Beneficence====
Some of the buildings within the &quot;Garden of Abundant Beneficence&quot; () were built by the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty who originally used them to raise silkworms. More buildings were later added by the Qianlong Emperor, who used them as libraries and as a personal retreat. Throughout this garden, there are wooden placards at the buildings&#x27; entrances, inscribed by the Qianlong Emperor. In the northwestern area of the garden is a building called &quot;Chunlianzhai&quot; () which once housed the seal of the Qianlong Emperor as well as several artworks. After the Boxer Rebellion Chunlianzhai was looted and it subsequently became a summer residence for the commander of the German contingent of the Eight Nation Alliance Army. In the early days of the People&#x27;s Republic of China Chunlianzhai was used as a dance hall, where dances were held twice a week by senior party leaders.

The largest building in the Garden of Abundant Beneficence is &quot;Dianxu Hall&quot;, which was known as &quot;Chong Ya Temple&quot; during the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s reign, &quot;Yinian Temple&quot; () during the Guangxu Emperor&#x27;s reign and finally as &quot;Yitingnian&quot; during the Republic of China. During the Beiyang Government (1912–1928) of the Republic of China, the office of the president was initially located in Dianxu Hall. In 1918 President Xu Shichang switched the president&#x27;s residence and the prime minister&#x27;s office, relocating his residence to Regent Palace, while the prime minister instead moved to Dianxu Hall in the Garden of Abundant Beneficence. Dianxu Hall became a general purpose meeting area for CCP officials after 1949. During Mao Zedong&#x27;s time as Paramount Leader, Politburo Meetings were often held in Dianxu Hall due its proximity to Mao&#x27;s house. Before 1980 the Politburo Standing Committee also met in one of the small conference rooms of Dianxu Hall during the times when meetings were not held in Mao&#x27;s house.

The Garden of Abundant Beneficence also contains Chairman Mao Zedong&#x27;s first personal residence and office, which he used from 1949 to 1966, a building called the Library of Chrysanthemum Fragrance (). The Chrysanthemum library is a courtyard-style building with four halls constructed during the time of the Kangxi Emperor to house a collection of books for the imperial family. The north hall of the Chrysanthemum library is called &quot;Ziyunxuan&quot; () and was the site of Mao&#x27;s bedroom and personal study. The east hall was the location of Mao&#x27;s office and the south hall was the location of Jiang Qing&#x27;s residence for a period of time. An air raid shelter was dug in the courtyard of Chrysanthemum library shortly after Mao moved in, but it was rarely used. Mao relocated to a new building known as the Poolside House in 1966 at the start of the Cultural Revolution. After Mao&#x27;s death, the Chrysanthemum Library was preserved as a museum which is not accessible to the general public. Immediately to the east of the library are a series of buildings known as the &quot;Western Eight Houses&quot; (), which served as a dormitory for Mao&#x27;s personal aides and secretaries.

====Shuqingyuan Pavilion====
Located in the northeastern corner of the Southern Sea, the &quot;Shuqingyuan Pavilion&quot; () was built for the Qianlong Emperor as part of a small garden, similar in style to the Beihai Park. After 1959, the original building was destroyed in order to make way for the construction of a barracks and officer staff quarters for Unit 8341, the Zhongnanhai security guard regiment. The formal address of Shuqingyuan Pavilion and the surrounding complex of buildings used by Unit 8341 is 81 Nanchang Street, Xicheng District, Beijing.

====Building 202====
The building (202别墅) next to &quot;Huairen Hall&quot; was constructed in 1974 as a specially reinforced earthquake shelter. Before the current building was built on this location, the area to the east of Huairen Hall was the site of the homes of Dong Biwu and Chen Boda. Mao Zedong was relocated to Building 202 from Poolside House after the July 1976 Tangshan earthquake. Mao died in this building on September 9, 1976. During the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests, Premier Li Peng moved into Zhongnanhai and lived in Building 202 due to the perception that he was vulnerable to attack at his residence at Wanshou Road.

====Western Four Houses====
The &quot;Four Western Houses&quot; () were built as part of the western wing of the &quot;Huairen Hall&quot; complex as living quarters for eunuchs and palace maids that served Empress Dowager Cixi. They are also known as Qingyuntang (). These buildings were acquired by the Peking Institute of Historic Research after the end of the Beiyang government. After 1949, the Propaganda Department was located here before it was eventually moved to its current headquarters on 5 West Chang&#x27;an Street. The four buildings were subsequently given the designations &quot;Courtyard No. 1&quot; through &quot;Courtyard No. 4&quot; and became the residences of Li Fuchun, Tan Zhenlin, Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yi respectively. During his paramount leadership, however, Deng Xiaoping did not live in Zhongnanhai, instead living at No. 11 Miliangku Hutong (Rice Grain Depot Hutong) near Di&#x27;anmen. Deng moved there in 1977 and lived there until his death. After Chen Yi&#x27;s death, Zhao Ziyang lived in Courtyard No. 4, the northernmost of the Western Four Houses during his time as General Secretary.

====Wanzi Gallery====
The original buildings in the area of &quot;Wanzi Gallery&quot; () were built by the Qianlong Emperor in 1742 to celebrate his mother&#x27;s 50th birthday.

During his presidency, Liu Shaoqi moved to a building in this area called &quot;Fuluju&quot; () in 1963. After Liu was denounced and purged, both the original Wanzi Gallery and Fuluju were demolished during the Cultural Revolution. Wanzi Gallery was later reconstructed and Mao&#x27;s wife Jiang Qing lived in what was then called Building No. 201 during the height of the power of the Gang of Four. This building was also known as the Spring Lotus Chamber.

====Yingtai Island====
Located in the Southern Sea, the artificial &quot; Yingtai Island&quot; () was completed in 1421 by Ming Emperor Yongle after he relocated his capital to Beijing. The island was given its current name by Qing Emperor Shunzhi in 1655. Yingtai Island is connected with the shore via a stone bridge. Due to a slope of elevation on the island, the main temple in the north is a single-story building while in the south there exists a two-story pavilion called &quot;Penglai Pavilion&quot;. There are two temples to the north of &quot;Hanyuan Temple&quot;, &quot;Qingyun Temple&quot; to the east and &quot;Jingxing Temple&quot; to the west. In July 1681, the Kangxi Emperor held the &quot;Yingtai hearings&quot; on the development of a national strategy to put down civil strife. Dowager Empress Cixi imprisoned Emperor Guangxu at Hanyuan Temple on Yingtai in August 1898 after the failure of the Hundred Days Reform. Emperor Guangxu was subsequently poisoned and died here in 1908; Empress Dowager Cixi, Yuan Shikai, and Li Lianying—Cixi&#x27;s favourite eunuch—were the three main suspects.

Since 1949, Yingtai is used as the site of banquets and other hospitality activities. According to some sources, Jiang Zemin lived in Hanyuan Temple on Yingtai Island during his time as paramount leader.

====Xinhua Gate====

Zhongnanhai&#x27;s main entrance, the &quot;Xinhua Gate&quot; () is located to the north of West Chang&#x27;an Avenue. The gate was originally built by the Qianlong Emperor in 1758 as a pavilion for one of his concubines. After the 1911 Revolution, Yuan Shikai transformed the pavilion into a gate and named it &quot;Xinhua Gate&quot; or &quot;New China Gate&quot; in 1912. The slogans &quot;Long live the great Chinese Communist Party &quot; and &quot;long live invincible Mao Zedong Thought &quot; are now on the walls on both sides of Xinhua Gate. On the door is the inscription &quot;为人民服务&quot; (&quot;serve the people&quot;) in Mao Zedong&#x27;s handwriting. In 1959, an underground passage was built between Xinhua Gate and the Great Hall of the People shortly before the construction of the latter was completed. This passage was intended to be used only by members of the Politburo Standing Committee at the time.

<text>The archerfish (also known as spinner fish or archer fish) or Toxotidae are a monotypic family (although some include a second genus) of perciform tropical fish known for their unique predation technique of &quot;shooting down&quot; land-based insects and other small prey with jets of water spit from their specialized mouths. The family is small, consisting of ten species in a single genus, Toxotes. Most archerfish live in freshwater streams, ponds and wetlands, but two or three species are euryhaline, inhabiting both fresh and brackish water habitats such as estuaries and mangroves. They can be found from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, through Southeast Asia, to Melanesia and Northern Australia.

Archerfish have deep and laterally compressed bodies, with the dorsal fin and the profile a straight line from dorsal fin to mouth. The mouth is protractile, and the lower jaw juts out. Sizes are fairly small, typically up to about , but &quot;T. chatareus&quot; can reach .

Archerfish are popular exotic fish for aquaria, but are difficult to feed and maintain by average fishkeepers since they prefer live prey over typical fish foods.

==Capture of prey==
Archerfish are remarkably accurate in their shooting; an adult fish almost always hits the target on the first shot. Although it is presumed that all archerfish species do this, it has only been confirmed from &quot;T. blythii&quot;, &quot;T. chatareus&quot; and &quot;T. jaculatrix&quot;. They can bring down insects and other prey up to above the water&#x27;s surface. This is partially due to their good eyesight, but also to their ability to compensate for the refraction of light as it passes through the air-water interface when aiming at their prey. They typically spit at prey at a mean angle of about 74° from the horizontal but can still aim accurately when spitting at angles between 45° and 110°.

When an archerfish selects its prey, it rotates its eye so that the image of the prey falls on a particular portion of the eye in the ventral temporal periphery of the retina, and its lips just break the surface, squirting a jet of water at its victim. The archerfish does this by forming a small groove in the roof of its mouth and its tongue into a narrow channel. It then fires by contracting its gill covers and forcing water through the channel, shooting a stream that, shaped by its mouth parts, travels faster at the rear than at the front. This speed differential causes the stream to become a blob directly before impact as the slower leading water is overtaken by the faster trailing water, and it is varied by the fish to account for differences in range. It also makes this one of the few animals that both make and use tools, as they both utilise the water and shape it to make it more useful to them. They are persistent and will make multiple shots if the first one fails.

Young archerfish start shooting when they are about long but are inaccurate at first and must learn from experience. During this learning period, they hunt in small schools. This way, the probability is enhanced that at least one jet will hit its target. A 2006 experimental study found that archerfish appear to benefit from observational learning by watching a performing group member shoot, without having to practice: However, little of their social behaviour is currently known beyond that archerfish are sensitive to, and make changes to their shooting behaviour, when conspecifics are visible to them. This is probably as a result of the potential threat of kleptoparasitism that other archerfish represent to a shooting fish.

An archerfish will often leap out of the water and grab an insect in its mouth if it happens to be within reach. Individuals typically prefer to remain close to the surface of the water.

New research has found that archerfish also use jets to hunt underwater prey, such as those embedded in silt. It is not known whether they learned aerial or underwater shooting first, but the two techniques may have evolved , as improvements in one can be adapted to the other. This makes it an example of exaptation.

==Species==
There are 9 valid species, 8 in the genus &quot;Toxotes&quot;:

*&quot;Protoxotes lorentzi&quot; - primitive archerfish
*&quot;Toxotes blythii&quot; - clouded archerfish, zebra archerfish
*&quot;Toxotes carpentariensis&quot;, 
*&quot;Toxotes chatareus&quot; - largescale archerfish, common archerfish
*&quot;Toxotes jaculatrix&quot; - banded archerfish
*&quot;Toxotes kimberleyensis&quot; - Kimberley archerfish, western archerfish
*&quot;Toxotes microlepis&quot; - smallscale archerfish
*&quot;Toxotes oligolepis&quot; - big scale archerfish
*&quot;Toxotes sundaicus&quot;

<doc id="331910" wikidata="Q1339989" url="?curid=331910" title="The Haunted (Swedish band)">
<text>The Haunted is a Swedish heavy metal band from Gothenburg, formed in 1996. The original members were Anders and Jonas Björler, Peter Dolving, Adrian Erlandsson and Patrik Jensen. Both of the Björler brothers and Erlandsson were members of the seminal melodic death metal band At the Gates, a pioneering force in the Swedish death metal scene.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;The Haunted&quot;; first Dolving-era (1996–1999)===
On 27 July 1996, Patrik Jensen co-created the band with Adrian Erlandsson, who had just become an ex-member of his former band, At the Gates, due to the band&#x27;s split the day before. They had made their demo, called &quot;Demo &#x27;97&quot;, in 1997.

The band were signed to Earache Records and subsequently released their first album, the self-titled debut &quot;The Haunted&quot; in 1998. The album resulted in The Haunted being praised as &quot;Newcomer of the Year&quot; by several magazines, and the album being called &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by Terrorizer Magazine. The Haunted made a respectable live reputation staging the Swedish metal scene, as well the international scene, touring the UK with Napalm Death.

After the release of this album, Peter Dolving and Adrian Erlandsson both left the band in 1999, the former focusing on a solo career and the latter joining Cradle of Filth. Their replacements were Marco Aro and Per Möller Jensen. The band began to record their second album shortly afterwards.

===&quot;Made Me Do It&quot; and &quot;One Kill Wonder&quot;; first Aro-era (2000–2003)===
Their second album, &quot;Made Me Do It&quot;, released in 2000, was more melodic and resembled the Gothenburg style (with bands such as At the Gates, etc.) more than old-school thrash metal that was used on &quot;The Haunted&quot;. It is originally called &quot;Made Me Do It&quot;, but the idea is for the band name to be included in the title. &quot;The Haunted Made Me Do It&quot; topped CMJ Loud Rock Radio Chart for four weeks, and won a Swedish Grammy for &quot;Best Hard Rock Album&quot;. The album was followed by European tours with Entombed and Nile, The Crown in the UK, and In Flames in Japan. The Haunted played festivals such as &quot;2000 Decibel&quot;, Hultsfred (both in Sweden), Graspop (Belgium), and Wacken Open Air (Germany). The band subsequently released their first live album - &quot;Live Rounds in Tokyo&quot;.

In August 2001, guitarist/songwriter Anders Björler left the band and he was temporarily replaced by Marcus Sunesson of The Crown for The Haunted&#x27;s headlining tour; in less than a year Björler returned to the band. This meant that he could appear on the third studio album.

The next album was released in February 2003 and was titled &quot;One Kill Wonder&quot;. The Haunted broke their own record being listed at number one on CMJ Loud Rock Radio Chart in five weeks. Alternative Press hailed The Haunted as one of metal&#x27;s 25 most important bands. The song &quot;D.O.A.&quot;, from this album, became available for download in March 2008 for the video game Rock Band, on the Xbox 360&#x27;s Xbox Live Marketplace, and the PlayStation 3&#x27;s PlayStation Network. Another song from the same album, &quot;Shadow World&quot;, was announced as a future download.

===&quot;Revolver&quot;; second Dolving-era (2003–2005)===
&quot;One Kill Wonder&quot; resulted in the band dominating album charts all over the world, and their first tours to Australia and South Africa, another tour to Japan, and a second Grammy. After another tour to Scandinavia, North America, United Kingdom and Europe in late 2003, the sudden departure of Marco Aro came as a shock. Though, this opened a new chance of building up a reunion with former vocalist Peter Dolving.

Their first album with Peter Dolving back at the helm (and signed to a new deal with Century Media), was entitled &quot;Revolver&quot;. The new album was released in October 2004 and the name was to convey the evolution of the band and the music it now played as a whole. &quot;Revolver&quot; was met with a fair amount of fan support and critical acclaim, and the band toured the world extensively in support of it, including a second stage spot at Ozzfest 2005. On 2 February 2005, Marco Aro played his last show in Stockholm, Sweden but as a guest singer. In 2006, the band performed on the Extreme The Dojo vol.15 tour in Japan with Exodus and Nile, while Edge of Spirit opened for them.

===&quot;The Dead Eye&quot; and &quot;Versus&quot; (2006–2009)===

The Haunted&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;The Dead Eye&quot;, was released on 30 October 2006 in Europe and was again a success, showing a more sinister side to Dolving&#x27;s lyrics and a more technical, haunting musical approach. It was released in the US on 31 October 2006. They later toured Europe and toured with Dark Tranquillity, Into Eternity, and Scar Symmetry for the North America &quot;Metal For The Masses&quot; tour. They later toured Europe for the &quot;Cursed Earth&quot; tour with bands like Wolf, Municipal Waste, and Lyzanxia before taking a break in order to later return to play further tours and some shows in Russia.

Their sixth studio album, Versus, was released on 17 September 2008 in Sweden, 19–24 September in the rest of Europe, and 14 October in the US. In 2009 the band released a compilation album Warning Shots. In April 2010, the band released a live CD called &quot;Road Kill&quot;, and they supported heavy metal legends Slayer on their August 2010 tour. The band was also confirmed as being part of the soundtrack for Namco Bandai Games&#x27; 2010 remake of Splatterhouse.

===&quot;Unseen&quot;, going on hiatus (2010–2012)===
In April 2010, Dolving revealed that they had started writing new material, and the recording of a seventh album started that same fall. On 30 December, the band announced that the upcoming album was to be called &quot;Unseen&quot; and was to be released in March 2011.

The first sneak preview of the album was on 22 January 2011, when the band performed the song &quot;No Ghost&quot; on the P3 Guld Gala, broadcast live on TV and radio throughout Sweden.

However, on 29 February 2012, Peter Dolving quit the band for the second time. On 1 March 2012, The Haunted announced vocalist auditions via their Facebook page:
On 16 October 2012 two more members of the band, guitarist Anders Björler and drummer Per Möller Jensen also quit, leaving the band&#x27;s future up in the air. Jonas announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook that both he and Patrik were still deeply committed to the band, but acknowledged that now two additional band members had left, they were naturally uncertain of the band&#x27;s future. Unsurprisingly, a hiatus followed this turbulent series of events, and fans waited nervously to see what would transpire.

===&quot;Exit Wounds&quot;; second Aro-era (2014–2016)===

Patrik Jensen and Jonas Björler had a discussion at Jonas&#x27; 40th birthday party about not letting The Haunted disband. When Jensen asked Björler who should be the new vocalist in the band, Björler could only think of former member, Marco Aro. A few days later Jensen phoned Aro asking him to rejoin The Haunted. Aro had missed being in the band and was tempted to rejoin, but he was hesitant at first because he was not interested in returning to the hectic touring he had done with The Haunted in his past stint as vocalist. The Haunted had done a lot of touring for almost a decade straight after Aro left, reducing the band&#x27;s desire to continue with such scheduling going forward. More hesitation came because Aro had struggled with drug addiction during his time with the band, causing problems with his family, which he did not want to risk a reoccurrence of. He indicated that he needed to discuss rejoining the band with his family.
Aro was also in the band The Resistance and did not want to have conflicting schedules with both bands, so he had to have a discussion with The Resistance as well. Aro told Jensen he&#x27;d give him a response two weeks later. By then, the band had shown him the a breakdown of future tours, which encouraged Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Before publicly revealing information of the band&#x27;s new lineup, Aro stated only that there was &quot;good news coming from the band&quot;. His picture was in a silhouette on the band&#x27;s official Facebook the day before the band announced a new line-up. 

Original drummer Adrian Erlandsson now returned to the band also, and Ola Englund from Six Feet Under was brought in as the band&#x27;s new lead guitarist. The band then began writing for an EP titled &quot;Eye of the Storm,&quot; which was released on 20 January 2014 in Europe and 21 January 2014 in North America. The band had already been rehearsing before the announcement of the new lineup, and their first live performance followed at the 70000 Tons of Metal which set sail 27–31 January 2014.

On 1 July 2014, it was announced that their new album would be titled &quot;Exit Wounds&quot;, with the release date of 25 August 2014 in Europe and 2 September 2014 in North America. The track listing and the album cover were revealed on the same day.

===&quot;Strength in Numbers&quot; (2017–2021)===
On 10 May 2017, Century Media Records announced the band&#x27;s ninth studio album would be entitled &quot;Strength in Numbers&quot; and it was subsequently released worldwide on 25 August 2017.

===Upcoming tenth studio album (2022–present)===
On 7 August 2022, Ola announced on his Youtube channel that The Haunted were preparing to write a new album.

By August 2024, The Haunted were in the studio working on their tenth studio album, with drummer Adrian Erlandsson confirming that he was &quot;working on drums&quot; for it.

<text>Qualitative psychological research is psychological research that employs qualitative methods.

Qualitative research methodologies are oriented towards developing an understanding of the meaning and experience dimensions of human lives and their social worlds. Good qualitative research is characterized by congruence between the perspective that informs the research questions and the research methods used.

== Definition ==

Many techniques and methods join in qualitative research. Sullivan et al. (2018, p. 17) identify some commonly occurring features of qualitative research in Psychology:
* A tendency to use relatively unstructured data (…);
* An approach to theory that involves generating theories that are localised and context specific, rather than testing large-scale theories that seek to explain psychological process in all people (…);
* A tendency to use data-analysis practices that seek out themes in the data (…);
* A focus on language and the way things are represented in text (…);
* An interest in the perspectives, sense-making and individual experiences of people (…).

== Main authors ==
=== Lincoln &amp; Guba ===
The work of Yvonna Lincoln and Egon Guba is an example of a contribution to the field of qualitative research.

== Types ==
=== Conversation Analysis ===
Conversation analysis is a type of qualitative research in the field of sociology.

=== Discourse Analysis ===
Discourse analysis is type of qualitative research in the field of sociolinguistics.

=== Historical Analysis ===
Historical analysis is a type of qualitative research in the social sciences.

=== Grounded Theory ===
Grounded theory is a type of qualitative research in the social sciences.

=== Focus-grouping ===
According to Lederman, focus-grouping is a &quot;technique that involves the use of profound group interviews in which participants are selected because they are a purposive sampling of a specific population, with the group being &#x27;focused&#x27; on a given topic.&quot; According to Powell et al., a group of individuals selected and gathered by researchers to discuss and comment on, from personal experience, the topic that is the subject of the research form a focus-group.

Some of the features of focus-group discussions include each member&#x27;s participation, a number of consecutive meetings, common characteristics of members with respect to interests, the collection of qualitative data, and discussion that is focused on a topic that is determined by the purposes of the research.

One of the main purposes of focus-group discussions is to get insight into each participant&#x27;s phenomenological world, including the individual&#x27;s thinking, perceiving, and feeling, which may be largely independent of a group or its cultural and social settings. The group discussion is thought to make it likely that the participant&#x27;s phenomenal world will revealed in the context of the participant&#x27;s interaction with other members of the focus group. Focus-group discussions help in elaborating the different viewpoints and emotional processes of each member within a group. The individual interview is simpler for the researcher to control, but a focus-group discussion helps the researcher to obtain more information in less time than individual interviews ordinarily take. However, focus-group discussions are still organized and planned. The discussions are especially helpful when there are differences relating to power between its members, decision-makers, or professionals; and when the researcher or a member wants to understand and explore the level of consensus on a given topic.

<doc id="331921" wikidata="Q502895" url="?curid=331921" title="Common name">
<text>In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, country name, popular name, or farmer&#x27;s name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; and is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is often based in Latin. A common name is sometimes frequently used, but that is not always the case.

In chemistry, IUPAC defines a common name as one that, although it unambiguously defines a chemical, does not follow the current systematic naming convention, such as acetone, systematically 2-propanone, while a vernacular name describes one used in a lab, trade or industry that does not unambiguously describe a single chemical, such as copper sulfate, which may refer to either copper(I) sulfate or copper(II) sulfate.

Sometimes common names are created by authorities on one particular subject, in an attempt to make it possible for members of the general public (including such interested parties as fishermen, farmers, etc.) to be able to refer to one particular species of organism without needing to be able to memorise or pronounce the scientific name. Creating an &quot;official&quot; list of common names can also be an attempt to standardize the use of common names, which can sometimes vary a great deal between one part of a country and another, as well as between one country and another country, even where the same language is spoken in both places.

== Use as part of folk taxonomy ==

A common name intrinsically plays a part in a classification of objects, typically an incomplete and informal classification, in which some names are degenerate examples in that they are unique and lack reference to any other name, as is the case with say, &quot;ginkgo&quot;, &quot;okapi&quot;, and &quot;ratel&quot;. Folk taxonomy, which is a classification of objects using common names, has no formal rules and need not be consistent or logical in its assignment of names, so that say, not all flies are called flies (for example Braulidae, the so-called &quot;bee lice&quot;) and not every animal called a fly is indeed a fly (such as dragonflies and mayflies). In contrast, scientific or biological nomenclature is a global system that attempts to denote particular organisms or taxa uniquely and , on the assumption that such organisms or taxa are well-defined and generally also have well-defined interrelationships; accordingly the ICZN has formal rules for biological nomenclature and convenes periodic international meetings to further that purpose.

== Common names and the binomial system ==
The form of scientific names for organisms, called binomial nomenclature, is superficially similar to the noun-adjective form of vernacular names or common names which were used by non-modern cultures. A collective name such as &quot;owl&quot; was made more precise by the addition of an adjective such as &quot;screech&quot;. Linnaeus himself published a flora of his homeland Sweden, &quot;Flora Svecica&quot; (1745), and in this, he recorded the Swedish common names, region by region, as well as the scientific names. The Swedish common names were all binomials (e.g. plant no. 84 Råg-losta and plant no. 85 Ren-losta); the vernacular binomial system thus preceded his scientific binomial system.

Linnaean authority William T. Stearn said:

== Geographic range of use ==
The geographic range over which a particularly common name is used varies; some common names have a very local application, while others are virtually universal within a particular language. Some such names even apply across ranges of languages; the word for &quot;cat&quot;, for instance, is easily recognizable in most Germanic and many Romance languages. Many vernacular names, however, are restricted to a single country and colloquial names to local districts.

Some languages also have more than one common name for the same animal. For example, in Irish, there are many terms that are considered outdated but still well-known for their somewhat humorous and poetic descriptions of animals.
== Constraints and problems ==
Common names are used in the writings of both professionals and laymen. Lay people sometimes object to the use of scientific names over common names, but the use of scientific names can be defended, as it is in these remarks from a book on marine fish:
* Because &quot;common names often have a very local distribution&quot;, the same fish in a single area may have several common names.
* Because of &quot;ignorance of relevant biological facts among the lay public&quot;, a single species of fish may be called by several common names, because individuals in the species differ in appearance depending on their maturity, gender, or can vary in appearance as a morphological response to their natural surroundings, i.e. ecophenotypic variation.
* In contrast to common names, formal taxonomic names imply &quot;biological relationships between similarly named creatures&quot;.
* Because of &quot;incidental events, contact with other languages, or simple confusion&quot;, common names in a given region will sometimes &quot;change with time&quot;.
* In a book that lists over 1200 species of fishes &quot;more than half have no widely recognised common name&quot;; they either are too nondescript or too rarely seen to have earned any widely accepted common name.
* Conversely, a &quot;single common name often applies to multiple species&quot; of fishes. The lay public might simply not recognise or care about subtle differences in appearance between only very distantly related species.
* Many species that are rare, or lack economic importance, do not have a common name.

== Coining common names ==
In scientific binomial nomenclature, names commonly are derived from classical or modern Latin or Greek or Latinised forms of vernacular words or coinages; such names generally are difficult for laymen to learn, remember, and pronounce and so, in such books as field guides, biologists commonly publish lists of coined common names. Many examples of such common names simply are attempts to translate the scientific name into English or some other vernacular. Such translation may be confusing in itself, or confusingly inaccurate, for example, &quot;gratiosus&quot; does not mean &quot;gracile&quot; and &quot;gracilis&quot; does not mean &quot;graceful&quot;.

The practice of coining common names has long been discouraged; de Candolle&#x27;s &quot;Laws of Botanical Nomenclature&quot;, 1868, the non-binding recommendations that form the basis of the modern (now binding) International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants contains the following:

Various bodies and the authors of many technical and semi-technical books do not simply adapt existing common names for various organisms; they try to coin (and put into common use) comprehensive, useful, authoritative, and standardised lists of new names. The purpose typically is:

* to create names from scratch where no common names exist
* to impose a particular choice of name where there is more than one common name
* to improve existing common names
* to replace them with names that conform more to the relatedness of the organisms

Other attempts to reconcile differences between widely separated regions, traditions, and languages, by arbitrarily imposing nomenclature, often reflect narrow perspectives and have unfortunate outcomes. For example, members of the genus &quot;Burhinus&quot; occur in Australia, Southern Africa, Eurasia, and South America. A recent trend in field manuals and bird lists is to use the name &quot;thick-knee&quot; for members of the genus. This, in spite of the fact that the majority of the species occur in non-English-speaking regions and have various common names, not always English. For example, &quot;Dikkop&quot; is the centuries-old South African vernacular name for their two local species: &quot;Burhinus capensis&quot; is the Cape dikkop (or &quot;gewone dikkop&quot;, not to mention the presumably much older Zulu name &quot;umBangaqhwa&quot;); &quot;Burhinus vermiculatus&quot; is the &quot;water dikkop&quot;. The thick joints in question are not even, in fact, the birds&#x27; knees, but the intertarsal joints—in lay terms the ankles. Furthermore, not all species in the genus have &quot;thick knees&quot;, so the thickness of the &quot;knees&quot; of some species is not of clearly descriptive significance. The family Burhinidae has members that have various common names even in English, including &quot;stone curlews&quot;, so the choice of the name &quot;thick-knees&quot; is not easy to defend but is a clear illustration of the hazards of the facile coinage of terminology.

For collective nouns for various subjects, see a list of collective nouns (e.g. a flock of sheep, pack of wolves).

=== Official lists ===
Some organizations have created official lists of common names, or guidelines for creating common names, hoping to standardize the use of common names.

For example, the Australian Fish Names List or AFNS was compiled through a process involving work by taxonomic and seafood industry experts, drafted using the CAAB (Codes for Australian Aquatic Biota) taxon management system of the CSIRO, and including input through public and industry consultations by the Australian Fish Names Committee (AFNC). The AFNS has been an official Australian Standard since July 2007 and has existed in draft form (The Australian Fish Names List) since 2001.
Seafood Services Australia (SSA) serve as the Secretariat for the AFNC. SSA is an accredited Standards Australia (Australia&#x27;s peak non-government standards development organisation) Standards Development

The Entomological Society of America maintains a database of official common names of insects, and proposals for new entries must be submitted and reviewed by a formal committee before being added to the listing.

Efforts to standardize English names for the amphibians and reptiles of North America (north of Mexico) began in the mid-1950s. The dynamic nature of taxonomy necessitates periodical updates and changes in the nomenclature of both scientific and common names. The Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles (SSAR) published an updated list in 1978, largely following the previous established examples, and subsequently published eight revised editions ending in 2017. More recently the SSAR switched to an online version with a searchable database. Standardized names for the amphibians and reptiles of Mexico in Spanish and English were first published in 1994, with a revised and updated list published in 2008.

A set of guidelines for the creation of English names for birds was published in &quot;The Auk&quot; in 1978. It gave rise to &quot;Birds of the World: Recommended English Names&quot; and its Spanish and French companions.

The Academy of the Hebrew Language publish from time to time short dictionaries of common name in Hebrew for species that occur in Israel or surrounding countries e.g. for Reptilia in 1938, Osteichthyes in 2012, and Odonata in 2015.

<text>Bakewell is a market town and civil parish in the Derbyshire Dales district of Derbyshire, England, known for Bakewell pudding. It lies on the River Wye, 15 miles (23 km) south-west of Sheffield. It is the largest settlement and only town within the boundaries of the Peak District National Park. At the 2011 census, the population of the civil parish was 3,949. It was estimated at 3,695 in 2019. The town is close to the tourist attractions of Chatsworth House and Haddon Hall.

==History==
Although there is evidence of earlier settlement in the area, Bakewell itself was probably founded in Anglo-Saxon times in the Anglian kingdom of Mercia. The name Bakewell means a spring or stream of a woman named Badeca or Beadeca, so deriving from a personal name with the Old English suffix &quot;wella&quot;. In 949, it was called Badecanwelle, and in the 1086 Domesday Book &quot;Badequelle&quot;. The Domesday Book listing stated that King Edward the Confessor held land here and there was a church and a mill.

These are the outlying estates or berewicks of the manor: Haddon, Holme [in Bakewell], Rowsley, Burton [in Bakewell], Conksbury, Oneash, Monyash, and Over Haddon.

Bakewell Parish Church, a Grade I listed building, dates from 920 and has a 9th-century cross in the churchyard. The present building was built in the 12th–13th centuries, but it was virtually rebuilt in the 1840s by William Flockton. By Norman times Bakewell had gained in importance. The Domesday Book mentions the town and its church having two priests. A motte and bailey castle was built in the 12th century. In the early 14th-century, the vicar was terrorised by the Coterel gang, which evicted him and confiscated his church&#x27;s money at the instigation of the canons of Lichfield Cathedral.

A market was established in 1254, allowing Bakewell to develop as a trading centre. The Grade I listed five-arched bridge over the River Wye dates from the 13th century, as one of the few remnants of that period. Also Grade I listed, Holme Bridge dates from 1664 and crosses the Wye on the north-eastern outskirts of the town. A chalybeate spring was discovered and a bath house built in 1697. This led to an 18th-century attempt to develop Bakewell as a spa town in the manner of Buxton. Construction of Lumford Mill by Richard Arkwright in 1777 was followed by the rebuilding of much of the town in the 19th century.

The mill, built about 1782 and employing over 300 people during the peak years, housed its workforce in cottages. It was sold to the Duke of Devonshire in 1860, but in 1868 suffered fire damage and was rebuilt. It is now a scheduled monument, the oldest part being Grade I listed. A full 183 listed buildings are located in the town. Its layout altered in the 1800s when Rutland Square was created.

==Geography==
Bakewell is in the valley of the River Wye in central Derbyshire. Its centre is near the river at about above sea level, with the highest parts of the town at about on the valley sides. The town is in the Derbyshire Dales district and about south-west of Sheffield, south-east of Manchester, and north of Derby. Nearby towns include Matlock to the south-east, Chesterfield to the east and Buxton to the north-west. Villages near Bakewell include Ashford-in-the-Water, Elton, Great Longstone, Monyash, Over Haddon, Sheldon, Rowsley, Pilsley, Youlgreave and Baslow.
==Economy==
Bakewell attracts domestic and foreign tourists. Monday is popular as this is when the town&#x27;s traditional market day falls each week. The cattle market is held in a purpose-built agricultural centre across the river from the town centre, where a stall market is held.

A major employer is the Peak District National Park Authority, with its offices at Aldern House, Baslow Road. Its task is to conserve, enhance and promote understanding and enjoyment of the local area. Opposite Aldern House is another major employer, Newholme Hospital, an NHS cottage hospital providing outpatient services. The 19th century listed building was deemed as not suitable for the delivery of modern healthcare during the Better Care Closer to Home conference led by NHS commissioners in 2017. Subsequent to this decision, the hospital was sold in 2024 to a private developer. Newholme Health Centre, a new, modern facility, now stands next to the old site, as of summer 2024. Establishment of a Costa Coffee branch in the town caused a protest among some local businesses. After almost 10 years of being open, the coffee shop closed its doors in spring 2023.

Local television news is provided by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central; however, BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire can also be received in the town.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Derby on 95.3 FM and Peak FM 102.0 FM.

==Landmarks==

All Saints&#x27; Church is a Grade I-listed church founded in 920, in Saxon times. The churchyard has two Saxon crosses. One is the Beeley Cross, unearthed in a field at a disputed location near Beeley and moved for some years to the grounds of Holt House near Darley Bridge. Although only the base and lower part of the shaft survive, it stands over 5 ft/152 cm high and is carved on all four faces. The other is the Bakewell Cross, 8 ft/244 cm high and almost complete. It was carved in the 7th–8th centuries and shows scenes that include the Annunciation. This may originally have stood at Hassop Cross Roads. During restoration work on the church in the 1840s, many carved fragments of Saxon stonework were found in and around the porch, along with some ancient stone coffins.

The church contains a selection of medieval and Anglo-Saxon cross fragments and carved stones collected by Thomas Bateman and donated to Weston Park Museum in Sheffield, before they were moved to Bakewell in 1899. They include a notable alabaster memorial to Sir Godfrey de Foljambe, who acquired the manor of Bakewell about 1350, and to his wife Avena.

The town&#x27;s Old House Museum occupies a 16th-century dwelling house originating from the time of Henry VIII and extended under Elizabeth I. It is a Grade II* listed building.

The Old Town Hall in King Street dates from 1602, while the current Town Hall, in Anchor Street, was completed in 1890.

==Transport==
===Railway===
The Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway opened Bakewell railway station in 1862, then became part of the Midland Railway and later of the LMS main line from London to Manchester. John Ruskin objected to what he saw as desecration of the Derbyshire countryside and to the fact that &quot;every fool in Buxton can be at Bakewell in half an hour, and every fool in Bakewell at Buxton.&quot; In return for the Duke of Rutland&#x27;s permission for the line to pass through his estate at Haddon Hall, Bakewell station buildings on the hillside overlooking the town are more imposing than expected and the Duke&#x27;s coat of arms is carved in the stonework. Such pandering to landowners was common at the time, as their support was needed to pass the Act of Parliament allowing the line to be built. However, the inconvenient altitude of the line forced Bakewell station to be placed out of town, as the Duke insisted it be out of sight of Haddon Hall. These buildings are now used by small businesses, as the line between Matlock and Buxton was closed in 1968. Most of it has been designated the Monsal Trail, a bridle path for walking, cycling and riding.

Passenger trains operated by East Midlands Railway run from Derby, via Ambergate, only as far as Matlock; from the west, Northern trains from Manchester Piccadilly reach only as far as Buxton. There have been efforts to reopen the remaining Wye Valley portion of the line, which would run through Bakewell and over the Monsal Dale viaduct. Peak Rail, a local preserved railway, has reopened the line from Matlock to Rowsley. Reaching Bakewell is one of Peak Rail&#x27;s long-term ambitions. To keep up intentions for a future return of the railway, Derbyshire County Council currently protects the track bed from development.

===Roads===
The A6, which links Carlisle with Luton, runs through the town; it connects Bakewell with Buxton, Matlock and Derby.

The A619 road begins in Bakewell, travels through Chesterfield and leads to Worksop in Nottinghamshire. The medieval Bakewell Bridge carries this road over the River Wye.

==Cuisine==

Bakewell is known for the Bakewell pudding, a jam pastry with a filling enriched with egg and ground almond. Bakewell tart is a different confection, made with shortcrust pastry, an almond topping and a sponge and jam filling. Mr Kipling also made &quot;Cherry Bakewells&quot;, often also known as Bakewell tarts. The origins of these are not clear, but the popular story goes that the combination began by accident in 1820, when the landlady of the &quot;White Horse Inn&quot; (now the &quot;Rutland Arms Hotel&quot;) left instructions for her cook to make a jam tart with an egg and almond paste pastry base. The cook, however, spread the eggs and almond paste on top of the jam instead of mixing them into the pastry. When cooked the jam rose through the paste. The result was successful enough for it to be a popular confection at the inn. Commercial variations, usually with icing sugar on top, have spread the name.
Three shops in Bakewell offer what they claim to be the original recipe. The Bakewell Tart Shop and Coffee House sells four variations: Bakewell Tart, Iced Bakewell Tart, Moist Bakewell Tart and Traditional Bakewell Pudding. The Old Original Bakewell Pudding Shop and Bloomers of Bakewell both sell a Bakewell Pudding of their own.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census, Bakewell was 99.1 per cent White, 0.2 per cent Asian and 0.5 per cent mixed/multiple.

==Education==
In 1888, William Storrs Fox, a Cambridge graduate and naturalist, founded St Anselm&#x27;s School, Bakewell. The school is now co-educational, with some 250 day and boarding pupils aged 3–16. Lady Manners School is a co-educational secondary with about 1,450 pupils. It is also home to the Brew School, the UK&#x27;s biggest dedicated brewing and distilling school, established in 2014 at the historic Rutland Mill.

The town&#x27;s primary schools include All Saints Church of England School and Bakewell Methodist Junior School. There are other primaries in neighbouring villages.

==Events==
The Peak District traditional well dressing takes place in June; colourful images made of petals embedded in clay appear at several places in the town. Then follows Carnival week, culminating in a procession at the beginning of July. August brings the Bakewell Arts Festival, a music and theatre event begun in 1997. The Peak Literary Festival is held in the spring and autumn of each year. The spring one starts on the last Friday in May and the autumn one on the last Friday in October.

Until 2017, The Bakewell Agricultural Show was among the largest covered agricultural shows in the UK, attracting about 65,000 visitors. It took place on the first Wednesday and Thursday in August at the Bakewell Showground. Known also as the Little Royal, it was founded by Wootten Burkinshaw Thomas in 1819. In 2018 and 2019 (the bicentennial year), the Bakewell Show was suspended in favour of more lucrative commercial events.

==Sport and recreation==
Rugby union is played regularly by Bakewell Mannerians RUFC, which competes in Midlands 2 East (North).

Bakewell has a recreation park to the east of the centre, with tennis courts, a children&#x27;s playground, and football and cricket pitches. Near the library there is a municipal swimming pool and gym. The River Wye provides a popular riverside walk.

The town&#x27;s association football team, Bakewell Town F.C., competes in the Central Midlands Football League Premier Division South.

==Stephen Downing case==

The Stephen Downing case involved the conviction and imprisonment in 1974 of a 17-year-old council worker, Stephen Downing, for the murder of a 32-year-old legal secretary in Bakewell Cemetery. After a campaign by a local newspaper, his conviction was overturned in 2002, by which time Downing had served 27 years in prison. This is thought to be the longest miscarriage of justice in British legal history, and attracted worldwide media attention.

==Media==
===In literature===
Bakewell is named by the protagonist Elizabeth Bennet as the town from which she travelled to Pemberley in Chapter 43 of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

===On television===
*Bakewell features in the last episode of &quot;Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders&quot;, where the team covers a Christmas Eve murder in the 1800s.
*In 2010 the Rutland Arms Hotel featured in an episode of &quot;The Hotel Inspector&quot;.

<text>Heraclides, Heracleides or Herakleides (Greek: ) in origin was any individual of the legendary clan of the Heracleidae, the mythological patronymic applying to persons descended from Hercules. As they were of the legendary tribe of the Dorians, the name in the classical age could mean anyone of Dorian background. The Dorians had their own group of dialects, which may or may not have been spoken by given individuals. Usage of the name was concentrated at Syracuse, a Dorian colony, Tarentum, a Spartan colony, and central Greece, legendary ancestral homeland of the Dorians, but they colonized the islands, Crete, and Anatolia as well. As a personal name, Heraclides may refer to:

<text>Brazing is a metal-joining process in which two or more metal items are joined by melting and flowing a filler metal into the joint, with the filler metal having a lower melting point than the adjoining metal.

Brazing differs from welding in that it does not involve melting the work pieces. Brazing differs from soldering through the use of a higher temperature and much more closely fitted parts. During the brazing process, the filler metal flows into the gap between close-fitting parts by capillary action. The filler metal is brought slightly above its melting (liquidus) temperature while protected by a suitable atmosphere, usually a flux. It then flows over the base metal (in a process known as wetting) and is then cooled to join the work pieces together. A major advantage of brazing is the ability to join the same or different metals with considerable strength.

== Process ==

Brazing has many advantages over other metal-joining techniques, such as welding. Since brazing does not melt the base metal of the joint, it allows much tighter control over tolerances and produces a clean joint without the need for secondary finishing. Additionally, dissimilar metals and non-metals (i.e. metalized ceramics) can be brazed. In general, brazing also produces less thermal distortion than welding due to the uniform heating of a brazed piece. Complex and multi-part assemblies can be brazed cost-effectively. Welded joints must sometimes be ground flush, a costly secondary operation that brazing does not require because it produces a clean joint. Another advantage is that the brazing can be coated or clad for protective purposes. Finally, brazing is easily adapted to mass production and it is easy to automate because the individual process parameters are less sensitive to variation.

One of the main disadvantages is the lack of joint strength as compared to a welded joint due to the softer filler metals used. The strength of the brazed joint is likely to be less than that of the base but greater than the filler metal. Another disadvantage is that brazed joints can be damaged under high service temperatures. Brazed joints require a high degree of base-metal cleanliness when done in an industrial setting. Some brazing applications require the use of adequate fluxing agents to control cleanliness. The joint color is often different from that of the base metal, creating an aesthetic disadvantage.

High-quality brazed joints require that parts be closely fitted with base metal surfaces exceptionally clean and free of oxides. In most cases, joint clearances of are recommended for the best capillary action and joint strength; in some brazing operations, however, it is not uncommon to have joint clearances around . Cleanliness of the brazing surfaces is also important, as any contamination can cause poor wetting (flow). The two main methods for cleaning parts, prior to brazing, are chemical cleaning and abrasive or mechanical cleaning. In the case of mechanical cleaning it is important to maintain the proper surface roughness, as wetting on a rough surface occurs much more readily than on a smooth surface of the same geometry.

Another consideration is the effect of temperature and time on the quality of brazed joints. As the temperature of the braze alloy is increased, the alloying and wetting action of the filler metal increases as well. In general, the brazing temperature selected must be above the melting point of the filler metal. However, several factors influence the joint designer&#x27;s temperature selection. The best temperature is usually selected to:

* Minimize braze temperature
* Minimize any heat effects on the assembly
* Minimize filler metal/base metal interaction
* Maximize the life of any fixtures or jigs used

In some cases, a worker may select a higher temperature to accommodate other factors in the design (e.g., to allow use of a different filler metal, or to control metallurgical effects, or to sufficiently remove surface contamination). The effect of time on the brazed joint primarily affects the extent to which these effects are present. In general, however, most production processes are selected to minimize brazing time and associated costs. This is not always the case, however, since in some non-production settings, time and cost are secondary to other joint attributes (e.g., strength, appearance).

== Techniques ==


There are many heating methods available to accomplish brazing operations. The most important factor in choosing a heating method is achieving efficient transfer of heat throughout the joint and doing so within the heat capacity of the individual base metals used. The geometry of the braze joint is also a crucial factor to consider, as is the rate and volume of production required. The easiest way to categorize brazing methods is to group them by heating method. Here are some of the most common:

* Torch brazing
* Furnace brazing
* Induction brazing
* Dip brazing
* Resistance brazing
* Infrared brazing
* Blanket brazing
* Electron beam and laser brazing
* Braze welding

These heating methods are classified through localised and diffuse heating techniques and offer advantages based on their different applications.

=== Torch brazing ===
Torch brazing is by far the most common method of mechanized brazing in use. It is best used in small production volumes or in specialized operations, and in some countries, it accounts for a majority of the brazing taking place. There are three main categories of torch brazing in use: manual, machine, and automatic torch brazing.

&quot;Manual torch brazing&quot; is a procedure where the heat is applied using a gas flame placed on or near the joint being brazed. The torch can either be hand held or held in a fixed position depending on whether the operation is completely manual or has some level of automation. Manual brazing is most commonly used on small production volumes or in applications where the part size or configuration makes other brazing methods impossible. The main drawback is the high labor cost associated with the method as well as the operator skill required to obtain quality brazed joints. The use of flux or self-fluxing material is required to prevent oxidation. Torch brazing of copper can be done without the use of flux if it is brazed with a torch using oxygen and hydrogen gas, rather than oxygen and other flammable gases.

&quot;Machine torch brazing&quot; is commonly used where a repetitive braze operation is being carried out. This method is a mix of both automated and manual operations with an operator often placing brazes material, flux and jigging parts while the machine mechanism carries out the actual braze. The advantage of this method is that it reduces the high labor and skill requirement of manual brazing. The use of flux is also required for this method as there is no protective atmosphere, and it is best suited to small to medium production volumes.

&quot;Automatic torch brazing&quot; is a method that almost eliminates the need for manual labor in the brazing operation, except for loading and unloading of the machine. The main advantages of this method are: a high production rate, uniform braze quality, and reduced operating cost. The equipment used is essentially the same as that used for Machine torch brazing, with the main difference being that the machinery replaces the operator in the part preparation.

=== Furnace brazing ===
Furnace brazing is a semi-automatic process used widely in industrial brazing operations due to its adaptability to mass production and use of unskilled labor. There are many advantages of furnace brazing over other heating methods that make it ideal for mass production. One main advantage is the ease with which it can produce large numbers of small parts that are easily jigged or self-locating. The process also offers the benefits of a controlled heat cycle (allowing use of parts that might distort under localized heating) and no need for post braze cleaning. Common atmospheres used include: inert, reducing or vacuum atmospheres all of which protect the part from oxidation. Some other advantages include: low unit cost when used in mass production, close temperature control, and the ability to braze multiple joints at once. Furnaces are typically heated using either electric, gas or oil depending on the type of furnace and application. However, some of the disadvantages of this method include: high capital equipment cost, more difficult design considerations and high power consumption.

There are four main types of furnaces used in brazing operations: batch type; continuous; retort with controlled atmosphere; and vacuum.

A &quot;batch&quot; type furnace has relatively low initial equipment costs, and can heat each part load separately. It can be turned on and off at will, which reduces operating expenses when it&#x27;s not in use. These furnaces are suited to medium to large volume production, and offer a large degree of flexibility in type of parts that can be brazed. Either controlled atmospheres or flux can be used to control oxidation and cleanliness of parts.

&quot;Continuous type&quot; furnaces are best suited to a steady flow of similar-sized parts through the furnace. These furnaces are often conveyor fed, moving parts through the hot zone at a controlled speed. It is common to use either controlled atmosphere or pre-applied flux in continuous furnaces. In particular, these furnaces offer the benefit of very low manual labor requirements and so are best suited to large scale production operations.

&quot;Retort-type&quot; furnaces differ from other batch-type furnaces in that they make use of a sealed lining called a &quot;retort&quot;. The retort is generally sealed with either a gasket or is welded shut and filled completely with the desired atmosphere and then heated externally by conventional heating elements. Due to the high temperatures involved, the retort is usually made of heat resistant alloys that resist oxidation. Retort furnaces are often either used in a batch or semi-continuous versions.

&quot;Vacuum furnaces&quot; is a relatively economical method of oxide prevention and is most often used to braze materials with very stable oxides (aluminum, titanium and zirconium) that cannot be brazed in atmosphere furnaces. Vacuum brazing is also used heavily with refractory materials and other exotic alloy combinations unsuited to atmosphere furnaces. Due to the absence of flux or a reducing atmosphere, the part cleanliness is critical when brazing in a vacuum. The three main types of vacuum furnace are: single-wall hot retort, double-walled hot retort, and cold-wall retort. Typical vacuum levels for brazing range from pressures of 1.3 to 0.13 pascals (10−2 to 10−3 Torr) to 0.00013 Pa (10−6 Torr) or lower. Vacuum furnaces are most commonly batch-type, and they are suited to medium and high production volumes.

=== Silver brazing ===

Silver brazing, sometimes known as hard soldering, is brazing using a silver alloy based filler. These silver alloys consist of many different percentages of silver and other metals, such as copper, zinc and cadmium.

Brazing is widely used in the tool industry to fasten &quot;hard metal&quot; (carbide, ceramics, cermet, and similar) tips to tools such as saw blades. &quot;Pretinning&quot; is often done: the braze alloy is melted onto the hard metal tip, which is placed next to the steel and remelted. Pretinning gets around the problem that hard metals are difficult to wet.

Brazed hard metal joints are typically two to seven mils thick. The braze alloy joins the materials and compensates for the difference in their expansion rates. It also provides a cushion between the hard carbide tip and the hard steel, which softens impact and prevents tip loss and damage—much as a vehicle&#x27;s suspension helps prevent damage to the tires and the vehicle. Finally, the braze alloy joins the other two materials to create a composite structure, much as layers of wood and glue create plywood. The standard for braze joint strength in many industries is a joint that is stronger than either base material, so that when under stress, one or other of the base materials fails before the joint. Silver brazing may cause defects in certain alloys, e.g. stress-induced inter-granular cracking in copper-nickel.

One special silver brazing method is called &#x27; or &#x27;. It has been developed especially for connecting cables to railway track or for cathodic protection installations. The method uses a silver- and flux-containing brazing pin, which is melted in the eye of a cable lug. The equipment is normally powered from batteries.

=== Braze welding ===

&quot;Braze welding&quot; is the use of a bronze or brass filler rod coated with flux to join steel workpieces. The equipment needed for braze welding is basically identical to the equipment used in brazing. Since braze welding usually requires more heat than brazing, acetylene or methylacetylene-propadiene gas (MAPP gas) fuel is commonly used. The name comes from the fact that no capillary action is used.

Braze welding has many advantages over fusion welding. It allows the joining of dissimilar metals, minimization of heat distortion, and can reduce the need for extensive pre-heating. Additionally, since the metals joined are not melted in the process, the components retain their original shape; edges and contours are not eroded or changed by the formation of a fillet. Another effect of braze welding is the elimination of stored-up stresses that are often present in fusion welding. This is extremely important in the repair of large castings. The disadvantages are the loss of strength when subjected to high temperatures and the inability to withstand high stresses.

Carbide, cermet and ceramic tips are plated and then joined to steel to make tipped band saws. The plating acts as a braze alloy.

=== Cast iron &quot;welding&quot; ===

The &quot;welding&quot; of cast iron is usually a brazing operation, with a filler rod made chiefly of nickel being used although true welding with cast iron rods is also available.
Ductile cast iron pipe may be also &quot;cadwelded,&quot; a process that connects joints by means of a small copper wire fused into the iron when previously ground down to the bare metal, parallel to the iron joints being formed as per hub pipe with neoprene gasket seals. The purpose behind this operation is to use electricity along the copper for keeping underground pipes warm in cold climates.

=== Vacuum brazing ===

Vacuum brazing is a material joining technique that offers significant advantages: extremely clean, superior, flux-free braze joints of high integrity and strength. The process can be expensive because it must be performed inside a vacuum chamber vessel. Temperature uniformity is maintained on the work piece when heating in a vacuum, greatly reducing residual stresses due to slow heating and cooling cycles. This, in turn, can significantly improve the thermal and mechanical properties of the material, thus providing unique heat treatment capabilities. One such capability is heat-treating or age-hardening the workpiece while performing a metal-joining process, all in a single furnace thermal cycle.

Products that are most commonly vacuum-brazed include aluminum cold plates, plate-fin heat exchangers, and flat tube heat exchangers.

Vacuum brazing is often conducted in a furnace; this means that several joints can be made at once because the whole workpiece reaches the brazing temperature. The heat is transferred using radiation, as many other methods cannot be used in a vacuum.

=== Dip brazing ===

Dip brazing is especially suited for brazing aluminium because air is excluded, thus preventing the formation of oxides. The parts to be joined are fixtured and the brazing compound applied to the mating surfaces, typically in slurry form. Then the assemblies are dipped into a bath of molten salt (typically NaCl, KCl and other compounds), which functions as both heat transfer medium and flux. Many dip brazed parts are used in heat transfer applications for the aerospace industry.

== Filler materials ==
A variety of alloys are used as filler metals for brazing depending on the intended use or application method. In general, braze alloys are composed of three or more metals to form an alloy with the desired properties. The filler metal for a particular application is chosen based on its ability to: wet the base metals, withstand the service conditions required, and melt at a lower temperature than the base metals or at a very specific temperature.

Braze alloy is generally available as rod, ribbon, powder, paste, cream, wire and preforms (such as stamped washers). Depending on the application, the filler material can be pre-placed at the desired location or applied during the heating cycle. For manual brazing, wire and rod forms are generally used as they are the easiest to apply while heating. In the case of furnace brazing, the alloy is usually placed beforehand since the process is usually highly automated. Some of the more common types of filler metals used are
* Aluminum-silicon
* Copper
* Copper-silver
* Copper-zinc (brass)
* Copper-tin (bronze)
* Gold-silver
* Nickel alloy
* Silver
* Amorphous brazing foil using nickel, iron, copper, silicon, boron, phosphorus, etc.

Some brazes come in the form of &quot;trifoils&quot;, laminated foils of a carrier metal clad with a layer of braze at each side. The center metal is often copper; its role is to act as a carrier for the alloy, to absorb mechanical stresses due to e.g. differential thermal expansion of dissimilar materials (e.g. a carbide tip and a steel holder), and to act as a diffusion barrier (e.g. to stop diffusion of aluminum from aluminum bronze to steel when brazing these two).

Brazing alloys form several distinct groups; the alloys in the same group have similar properties and uses.

; Pure metals: Unalloyed. Often noble metals – silver, gold, palladium.
; Ag-Cu: Silver-copper. Good melting properties. Silver enhances flow. Eutectic alloy used for furnace brazing. Copper-rich alloys prone to stress cracking by ammonia.
; Ag-Zn: Silver-zinc. Similar to Cu-Zn, used in jewelry due to its high silver content so that the product is compliant with hallmarking. The color matches silver, and it is resistant to ammonia-containing silver-cleaning fluids.
; Cu-Zn (brass): Copper-zinc. General purpose, used for joining steel and cast iron. Corrosion resistance usually inadequate for copper, silicon bronze, copper-nickel, and stainless steel. Reasonably ductile. High vapor pressure due to volatile zinc, unsuitable for furnace brazing. Copper-rich alloys prone to stress cracking by ammonia.
; Ag-Cu-Zn: Silver-copper-zinc. Lower melting point than Ag-Cu for same Ag content. Combines advantages of Ag-Cu and Cu-Zn. At above 40% Zn the ductility and strength drop, so only lower-zinc alloys of this type are used. At above 25% zinc less ductile copper-zinc and silver-zinc phases appear. Copper content above 60% yields reduced strength and melts above 900 °C. Silver content above 85% yields reduced strength, high liquidus and high cost. Copper-rich alloys prone to stress cracking by ammonia. Silver-rich brazes (above 67.5% Ag) are hallmarkable and used in jewellery; alloys with lower silver content are used for engineering purposes. Alloys with copper-zinc ratio of about 60:40 contain the same phases as brass and match its color; they are used for joining brass. Small amount of nickel improves strength and corrosion resistance and promotes wetting of carbides. Addition of manganese together with nickel increases fracture toughness. Addition of cadmium yields Ag-Cu-Zn-Cd alloys with improved fluidity and wetting and lower melting point; however cadmium is toxic. Addition of tin can play mostly the same role.
; Cu-P: Copper-phosphorus. Widely used for copper and copper alloys. Does not require flux for copper. Can be also used with silver, tungsten, and molybdenum. Copper-rich alloys prone to stress cracking by ammonia.
; Ag-Cu-P: Like Cu-P, with improved flow. Better for larger gaps. More ductile, better electrical conductivity. Copper-rich alloys prone to stress cracking by ammonia.
; Au-Ag: Gold-silver. Noble metals. Used in jewelry.
; Au-Cu: Gold-copper. Continuous series of solid solutions. Readily wet many metals, including refractory ones. Narrow melting ranges, good fluidity. Frequently used in jewellery. Alloys with 40–90% of gold harden on cooling but stay ductile. Nickel improves ductility. Silver lowers melting point but worsens corrosion resistance. To maintain corrosion resistance, gold must be kept above 60%. High-temperature strength and corrosion resistance can be improved by further alloying, e.g., with chromium, palladium, manganese, and molybdenum. Added vanadium allows wetting ceramics. Gold-copper has low vapor pressure.
; Au-Ni: Gold-Nickel. Continuous series of solid solutions. Wider melting range than Au-Cu alloys but better corrosion resistance and improved wetting. Frequently alloyed with other metals to reduce proportion of gold while maintaining properties. Copper may be added to lower gold proportion, chromium to compensate for loss of corrosion resistance, and boron for improving wetting impaired by the chromium. Generally no more than 35% Ni is used, as higher Ni/Au ratios have too wide melting range. Low vapor pressure.
; Au-Pd: Gold-Palladium. Improved corrosion resistance over Au-Cu and Au-Ni alloys. Used for joining superalloys and refractory metals for high-temperature applications, e.g. jet engines. Expensive. May be substituted for by cobalt-based brazes. Low vapor pressure.
; Pd: Palladium. Good high-temperature performance, high corrosion resistance (less than gold), high strength (more than gold). usually alloyed with nickel, copper, or silver. Forms solid solutions with most metals, does not form brittle intermetallics. Low vapor pressure.
; Ni: Nickel alloys, even more numerous than silver alloys. High strength. Lower cost than silver alloys. Good high-temperature performance, good corrosion resistance in moderately aggressive environments. Often used for stainless steels and heat-resistant alloys. Embrittled with sulfur and some lower-melting point metals, e.g. zinc. Boron, phosphorus, silicon and carbon lower melting point and rapidly diffuse to base metals. This allows diffusion brazing, and lets the joint be used above the brazing temperature. Borides and phosphides form brittle phases. Amorphous preforms can be made by rapid solidification.
; Co: Cobalt alloys. Good high-temperature corrosion resistance, possible alternative to Au-Pd brazes. Low workability at low temperatures, preforms prepared by rapid solidification.
; Al-Si: Aluminum-silicon. For brazing aluminum.
; Active alloys: Containing active metals, e.g., titanium or vanadium. Used for brazing non-metallic materials, e.g. graphite or ceramics.

Some additives and impurities act at very low levels. Both positive and negative effects can be observed. Strontium at levels of 0.01% refines grain structure of aluminum. Beryllium and bismuth at similar levels help disrupt the passivation layer of aluminum oxide and promote wetting. Carbon at 0.1% impairs corrosion resistance of nickel alloys. Aluminum can embrittle mild steel at 0.001%, phosphorus at 0.01%.

In some cases, especially for vacuum brazing, high-purity metals and alloys are used. 99.99% and 99.999% purity levels are available commercially.

Care must be taken to not introduce deleterious impurities from joint contamination or by dissolution of the base metals during brazing.

=== Melting behavior ===

Alloys with larger span of solidus/liquidus temperatures tend to melt through a &quot;mushy&quot; state, during which the alloy is a mixture of solid and liquid material. Some alloys show tendency to liquation, separation of the liquid from the solid portion; for these the heating through the melting range must be sufficiently fast to avoid this effect. Some alloys show extended plastic range, when only a small portion of the alloy is liquid and most of the material melts at the upper temperature range; these are suitable for bridging large gaps and for forming fillets. Highly fluid alloys are suitable for penetrating deep into narrow gaps and for brazing tight joints with narrow tolerances but are not suitable for filling larger gaps. Alloys with wider melting range are less sensitive to non-uniform clearances.

When the brazing temperature is suitably high, brazing and heat treatment can be done in a single operation simultaneously.

Eutectic alloys melt at single temperature, without mushy region. Eutectic alloys have superior spreading; non-eutectics in the mushy region have high viscosity and at the same time attack the base metal, with correspondingly lower spreading force. Fine grain size gives eutectics both increased strength and increased ductility. Highly accurate melting temperature lets joining process be performed only slightly above the alloy&#x27;s melting point. On solidifying, there is no mushy state where the alloy appears solid but is not yet; the chance of disturbing the joint by manipulation in such state is reduced (assuming the alloy did not significantly change its properties by dissolving the base metal). Eutectic behavior is especially beneficial for solders.

Metals with fine grain structure before melting provide superior wetting to metals with large grains. Alloying additives (e.g. strontium to aluminum) can be added to refine grain structure, and the preforms or foils can be prepared by rapid quenching. Very rapid quenching may provide amorphous metal structure, which possess further advantages.

=== Interaction with base metals ===
For successful wetting, the base metal must be at least partially soluble in at least one component of the brazing alloy. The molten alloy therefore tends to attack the base metal and dissolve it, slightly changing its composition in the process. The composition change is reflected in the change of the alloy&#x27;s melting point and the corresponding change of fluidity. For example, some alloys dissolve both silver and copper; dissolved silver lowers their melting point and increases fluidity, copper has the opposite effect.

The melting point change can be exploited. As the remelt temperature can be increased by enriching the alloy with dissolved base metal, step brazing using the same braze can be possible.

Alloys that do not significantly attack the base metals are more suitable for brazing thin sections.

Nonhomogenous microstructure of the braze may cause non-uniform melting and localized erosions of the base metal.

Wetting of base metals can be improved by adding a suitable metal to the alloy. Tin facilitates wetting of iron, nickel, and many other alloys. Copper wets ferrous metals that silver does not attack, copper-silver alloys can therefore braze steels silver alone won&#x27;t wet. Zinc improves wetting of ferrous metals, indium as well. Aluminum improves wetting of aluminum alloys. For wetting of ceramics, reactive metals capable of forming chemical compounds with the ceramic (e.g. titanium, vanadium, zirconium...) can be added to the braze.

Dissolution of base metals can cause detrimental changes in the brazing alloy. For example, aluminum dissolved from aluminum bronzes can embrittle the braze; addition of nickel to the braze can offset this.

The effect works both ways; there can be detrimental interactions between the braze alloy and the base metal. Presence of phosphorus in the braze alloy leads to formation of brittle phosphides of iron and nickel, phosphorus-containing alloys are therefore unsuitable for brazing nickel and ferrous alloys. Boron tends to diffuse into the base metals, especially along the grain boundaries, and may form brittle borides. Carbon can negatively influence some steels.

Care must be taken to avoid galvanic corrosion between the braze and the base metal, and especially between dissimilar base metals being brazed together. Formation of brittle intermetallic compounds on the alloy interface can cause joint failure. This is discussed more in-depth with solders.

The potentially detrimental phases may be distributed evenly through the volume of the alloy, or be concentrated on the braze-base interface. A thick layer of interfacial intermetallics is usually considered detrimental due to its commonly low fracture toughness and other sub-par mechanical properties. In some situations, e.g. die attaching, it however does not matter much as silicon chips are not typically subjected to mechanical abuse.

On wetting, brazes may liberate elements from the base metal. For example, aluminum-silicon braze wets silicon nitride, dissociates the surface so it can react with silicon, and liberates nitrogen, which may create voids along the joint interface and lower its strength. Titanium-containing nickel-gold braze wets silicon nitride and reacts with its surface, forming titanium nitride and liberating silicon; silicon then forms brittle nickel silicides and eutectic gold-silicon phase; the resulting joint is weak and melts at much lower temperature than may be expected.

Metals may diffuse from one base alloy to the other one, causing embrittlement or corrosion. An example is diffusion of aluminum from aluminum bronze to a ferrous alloy when joining these. A diffusion barrier, e.g. a copper layer (e.g. in a trimet strip), can be used.

A sacrificial layer of a noble metal can be used on the base metal as an oxygen barrier, preventing formation of oxides and facilitating fluxless brazing. During brazing, the noble metal layer dissolves in the filler metal. Copper or nickel plating of stainless steels performs the same function.

In brazing copper, a reducing atmosphere (or even a reducing flame) may react with the oxygen residues in the metal, which are present as cuprous oxide inclusions, and cause hydrogen embrittlement. The hydrogen present in the flame or atmosphere at high temperature reacts with the oxide, yielding metallic copper and water vapour, steam. The steam bubbles exert high pressure in the metal structure, leading to cracks and joint porosity. Oxygen-free copper is not sensitive to this effect, however the most readily available grades, e.g. electrolytic copper or high-conductivity copper, are. The embrittled joint may then fail catastrophically without any previous sign of deformation or deterioration.

== Flux ==

Unless brazing operations are contained within an inert or reducing atmosphere environment (i.e. Nitrogen), a flux such as borax is required to prevent oxides from forming while the metal is heated. The flux also serves the purpose of cleaning any contamination left on the brazing surfaces. Flux can be applied in any number of forms including flux paste, liquid, powder or pre-made brazing pastes that combine flux with filler metal powder. Flux can also be applied using brazing rods with a coating of flux, or a flux core. In either case, the flux flows into the joint when applied to the heated joint and is displaced by the molten filler metal entering the joint. Excess flux should be removed when the cycle is completed because flux left in the joint can lead to corrosion, impede joint inspection, and prevent further surface finishing operations. Phosphorus-containing brazing alloys can be self-fluxing when joining copper to copper. Fluxes are generally selected based on their performance on particular base metals. To be effective, the flux must be chemically compatible with both the base metal and the filler metal being used. Self-fluxing phosphorus filler alloys produce brittle phosphides if used on iron or nickel. As a general rule, longer brazing cycles should use less active fluxes than short brazing operations.

== Atmosphere ==

As brazing work requires high temperatures, oxidation of the metal surface occurs in an oxygen-containing atmosphere. This may necessitate the use of an atmospheric environment other than air. The commonly used atmospheres are:

; Air: Simple and economical. Many materials susceptible to oxidation and buildup of scale. Acid cleaning bath or mechanical cleaning can be used to remove the oxidation after work. Flux counteracts the oxidation, but may weaken the joint.
; Combusted fuel gas: Low hydrogen, AWS type 1, &quot;exothermic generated atmospheres&quot;. 87% N2, 11–12% CO2, 5-1% CO, 5-1% H2. For silver, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper and brass.
; Combusted fuel gas: Decarburizing, AWS type 2, &quot;endothermic generated atmospheres. 70–71% N2, 5–6% CO2, 9–10% CO, 14–15% H2. For copper, silver, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, nickel alloys, Monel, medium carbon steels.
; Combusted fuel gas: Dried, AWS type 3, &quot;endothermic generated atmospheres. 73–75% N2, 10–11% CO, 15–16% H2. For copper, silver, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, low-nickel alloys, Monel, medium and high carbon steels.
; Combusted fuel gas: Dried, decarburizing, AWS type 4. 41–45% N2, 17–19% CO, 38–40% H2. For copper, silver, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, low-nickel alloys, medium and high carbon steels.
; Ammonia: AWS type 5, also called forming gas. Dissociated ammonia (75% hydrogen, 25% nitrogen) can be used for many types of brazing and annealing. Inexpensive. For copper, silver, nickel, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, nickel alloys, Monel, medium and high carbon steels and chromium alloys.
; Nitrogen+hydrogen: Cryogenic or purified (AWS type 6A). 70–99% N2, 1–30% H2. For copper, silver, nickel, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals.
; Nitrogen+hydrogen+carbon monoxide: Cryogenic or purified (AWS type 6B). 70–99% N2, 2–20% H2, 1–10% CO. For copper, silver, nickel, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, low-nickel alloys, medium and high carbon steels.
; Nitrogen: Cryogenic or purified (AWS type 6C). Non-oxidizing, economical. At high temperatures can react with some metals, e.g. certain steels, forming nitrides. For copper, silver, nickel, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, low-nickel alloys, Monel, medium and high carbon steels.
; Hydrogen: AWS type 7. Strong deoxidizer, highly thermally conductive. Can be used for copper brazing and annealing steel. May cause hydrogen embrittlement to some alloys. For copper, silver, nickel, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, nickel alloys, Monel, medium and high carbon steels and chromium alloys, cobalt alloys, tungsten alloys, and carbides.
; Inorganic vapors: Various volatile fluorides, AWS type 8. Special purpose. Can be mixed with atmospheres AWS 1–5 to replace flux. Used for silver-brazing of brasses.
; Noble gas: Usually argon, AWS type 9. Non-oxidizing, more expensive than nitrogen. Inert. Parts must be very clean, gas must be pure. For copper, silver, nickel, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, nickel alloys, Monel, medium and high carbon steels chromium alloys, titanium, zirconium, hafnium.
; Noble gas+hydrogen: AWS type 9A.
; Vacuum: Requires evacuating the work chamber. Expensive. Unsuitable (or requires special care) for metals with high vapor pressure, e.g. silver, zinc, phosphorus, cadmium, and manganese. Used for highest-quality joints, for e.g. aerospace applications.

== Preforms ==

A brazing preform is a high quality, precision metal stamping used for a variety of joining applications in manufacturing electronic devices and systems. Typical brazing preform uses include attaching electronic circuitry, packaging electronic devices, providing good thermal and electrical conductivity, and providing an interface for electronic connections. Square, rectangular and disc shaped brazing preforms are commonly used to attach electronic components containing silicon dies to a substrate such as a printed circuit board. Rectangular frame shaped preforms are often required for the construction of electronic packages while washer shaped brazing preforms are typically utilized to attach lead wires and hermetic feed-throughs to electronic circuits and packages. Some preforms are also used in diodes, rectifiers, optoelectronic devices and components packaging.

== Safety ==

Brazing may entail exposure to hazardous chemical fumes. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in the United States recommends that exposure to these fumes is controlled to levels below the allowed exposure limit.

<text>A spiced bun is a sweet bun to which spices were added during the baking process. Common examples are the hot cross bun and the Jamaican spiced bun.

==Common spices==
Spices used in the preparation of spiced buns include:

* cinnamon
* mace
* nutmeg
* coriander
* allspice
* saffron
* mixed spice - a non-standardised mixture of spices used in the preparation of many spicy foods.

==Types==
Many local forms of the &quot;spiced bun&quot; exist, an example of which is the Cornish saffron bun.

The hot cross bun is probably the most well-known manifestation of the spiced bun, and a great tradition has grown up around it in England. Hot cross buns are traditionally baked on Good Friday, although they can often be purchased at other times of year. In Australia and New Zealand, the Boston bun is a larger variety of the spiced bun, topped with coconut icing.

The Jamaican spiced bun is shaped like a loaf of bread and is a dark brown colour. It is commonly eaten with cheese and is also eaten with butter or alone with a glass of milk. It is also popular in other Caribbean nations.

Bon bread, also called pambón or black bread, is a traditional bread from the Afro-Anglo-Saxon Caribbean, typical of the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, and the Colombian archipelago of San Andrés and Providencia. It is a dark spiced bread, derived from gingerbread of English origin.
Bread bon derives from bun, a type of English bun characterized by its dark color, due to the addition of ginger. The origin of this bread can be traced back to the Middle Ages. During Elizabethan times, buns made with spices and eggs were cooked, to which, during Lent, raisins and corintas were added. After the Lutheran Reformation, this bread was consumed on Good Friday, with the custom of marking it with a cross before putting it in the oven, as a way to ward off evil spirits. In the 17th century, it became popular as a breakfast.

The English gingerbread recipe was learned by African slaves when they were brought by the British to the West Indies. In the Caribbean islands, ginger was replaced by sugar cane molasses, due to the abundance of sugar plantations. This molasses is what gives it the dark color.

Foot-Notes of Decorah began playing Scandinavian-American old time dance music in 1991 under the leadership of fiddler Beth Hoven Rotto. Foot-Notes maintains an oral tradition of tunes passed down by old time fiddlers in the &quot;borderlands&quot; around Decorah, Iowa and Spring Grove, Minnesota, most prominent of these fiddlers being Bill Sherburne, a notable Norwegian-American fiddler who died at age 90 in 1991. Rotto apprenticed with Sherburne and learned his complete repertoire his passing. The band continues a tradition of playing for community dances in a rustic 1911 vintage two-room schoolhouse in Highlandville, Iowa, where such dances began in the mid-1970s with the music of Bill Sherburne and his band. Foot-Notes music has been featured on Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa public radio and Norwegian national radio programs. The group was selected to represent the State of Iowa at the Smithsonian Institution Festival of American Folklife in 1996 and the Festival of Iowa Folklife in Des Moines, Iowa that same year.

<text>The Lizard (Dr. Curtis &quot;Curt&quot; Connors) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, he first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #6 (November 1963) as an enemy of the superhero Spider-Man. While the character has retained this role throughout most of his subsequent appearances, he has also been portrayed as a tragic antihero and occasional ally of Spider-Man. Connors is sometimes an ally of Spider-Man just as himself, and not necessarily as his alter ego.

In the original Earth-616 version of the story, Curt Connors was a geneticist researching the ability of certain reptiles to regrow missing limbs. He developed a lizard DNA-based serum that would allow humans to do the same, and tested it on himself, hoping to regain his missing right arm; instead, he transformed into a feral anthropomorphic lizard. Although Spider-Man was able to undo the transformation, the Lizard remained a part of Connors&#x27;s subconscious and would resurface time and time again, often retaining Connors&#x27;s intelligence and attempting to replace mankind with a race of reptilian creatures like himself. Many stories featuring the Lizard deal with the effects he has on Connors&#x27;s life and psyche since the latter lives in constant fear that the Lizard will one day completely and irreversibly take over his body. Because of this, he works tirelessly to find a permanent cure for his alternate personality, much to the worry of his wife, Martha Connors, and son, Billy, but also standing in contrast to other Spider-Man foes who take pride in their powers and use them irresponsibly.

The character has appeared in numerous &quot;Spider-Man&quot; adaptations, including films, animated series, and video games. In live-action, Curt Connors was portrayed by Dylan Baker in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004) and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007), while Connors / Lizard is portrayed by Rhys Ifans in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (2012) and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021). In 2009, the Lizard was ranked &quot;IGN&quot;″s 62nd Greatest Comic Villain of All Time.

==Publication history==
The Lizard first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #6 (November 1963), and was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Curtis &quot;Curt&quot; Connors was born in Coral Gables, Florida. He was a gifted surgeon who enlisted in the U.S. Army. He performed emergency battlefield surgery on wounded GIs. However, his right arm was injured in a wartime blast, resulting in its amputation.

After his return to civilian life as a research technologist, Connors became obsessed with uncovering the secrets of reptilian limb regeneration. Working from his home in the Florida Everglades with the help of war buddy Ted Sallis, he finally developed an experimental serum taken from reptilian DNA. The serum successfully regrew the missing limb of a rabbit, so then Connors chose to test the serum on himself. He ingested the formula and he did indeed grow a new arm.

However, the formula had an unfortunate side effect: Connors was subsequently transformed into a reptilian humanoid monster. Spider-Man discovered this situation during a trip to Florida to investigate newspaper reports of the Lizard after his employer the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; challenged him. After discovering the Lizard&#x27;s true identity and origin, Spider-Man used Connors&#x27;s notes to create an antidote to restore him to his human form and mentality. Another attempt to develop this serum for safe use again resulted in Connors transforming into the Lizard, but on this occasion, he was saved thanks to his former colleague Professor X and his first team of X-Men, Beast and Angel tracking the Lizard down in the swamps so that the Iceman could send him into hibernation long enough to develop a cure.

===Life in New York===
Later, Curt Connors relocated to New York City attending Empire State University. He was able to repay Spider-Man by developing a formula to save May Parker&#x27;s life after Peter Parker had given his aunt his radioactive blood during a transfusion, unintentionally putting her in mortal peril. It later became clear that the success of Connors&#x27;s apparent cure from the Lizard persona was short-lived. A repeating pattern soon occurred, with stress or a chemical reaction turning Connors into the Lizard, Spider-Man fighting him, and then forcing him to swallow the antidote to reverse the transformation until the next time. A second personality had formed with the Lizard, one with the familiar goal shared by many villains of taking over the world. The Lizard envisioned a world where all humans had been transformed into (or replaced by) super-reptiles like himself. Despite the Lizard&#x27;s overall hatred of humans, he was often shown to be unwilling to harm his wife Martha or young son Billy.

As Connors, he aided Spider-Man in defeating the Rhino by developing a formula to dissolve the Rhino&#x27;s bulletproof hide, but accidentally transformed himself into the Lizard due to exposure to the chemicals needed to create the formula and was restored by Spider-Man. Connors was later abducted and forced to create a rejuvenation serum for Silvermane. However, the stress from this caused Connors to again transform; the Lizard then battled Spider-Man and the Human Torch, and was restored to normal once again by Spider-Man.

During another encounter with Spider-Man after Peter&#x27;s attempts to remove his powers resulted in him growing four extra arms, a bite from Morbius endowed the Lizard with Connors&#x27;s personality via the infection of a strange enzyme. Connors then synthesized an antidote for himself and Spider-Man using the Morbius enzyme. Curt Connors later aided Spider-Man, Ka-Zar, and Black Panther against Stegron. After the apparent death of the Jackal, Connors determined that Spider-Man was not a clone. Later, the Lizard battled both Stegron and Spider-Man after Stegron kidnapped Billy Connors. For a time, Peter Parker worked as a teaching assistant to Connors at Empire State University, although Connors had no idea that Peter was Spider-Man. During this time, Spider-Man and Connors dealt with one of Connors&#x27;s previous experiments in the form of the Iguana.

During the first of the Secret Wars, the Lizard had reverted to his more primitive state and refused to participate on either side of the conflict. Although he was collected by the Beyonder along with other villains, he broke away from the main group after the first battle to settle in a swamp, where he befriended the Wasp, who had helped him treat an injury that he had sustained in the first battle. After the Lizard was blasted by the magic of the Enchantress, he reverted to human form.

After Connors&#x27;s return from this event, his wife Martha, unable to take it anymore since Connors had said that he had been permanently cured, only to disappear for many days and then return home in tattered clothing with no plausible explanation as to where he had been, took their son Billy and separated from Curt. The Lizard had been affected by inter-dimensional teleportation so that Connors&#x27;s mind presided over the Lizard, and he battled the Owl alongside Spider-Man. However, mystical activity during &quot;Inferno&quot; once again brought the Lizard&#x27;s bestial nature to the fore, and Spider-Man cured him again.

===The 1990s through 2007: &quot;Civil War&quot;===
Connors then tried to straighten out his life and control the Lizard, with some degree of success. This ended when the villainess Calypso used her voodoo magic to take control of the Lizard (during the &quot;Torment&quot; storyline) for her purposes, reducing him to a mindless, savage state. After a series of bloody battles, the Lizard and Calypso were defeated by Spider-Man, and Spider-Man assumed that he perished under Calypso&#x27;s spell. Connors once again gained control of the Lizard&#x27;s mind and body, although it was very weak. Curt carried out a plan to cure himself temporarily, after which he voluntarily submitted to incarceration in the supervillain prison the Vault. When Calypso forces the transformation and attempted to control the Lizard once again, the creature killed her and escaped from the Vault. After this escape, the Lizard falls into a quicksand pit during a battle in the Everglades with Spider-Man and the bounty hunter Warrant and was believed to have died.

Later, a huge bestial Lizard appeared, shortly after Connors was called in to investigate Peter Parker&#x27;s sudden sickness (the result of Peter&#x27;s recently lost spider-powers returning). Spider-Man (Ben Reilly) realized that not only had the Lizard survived, but revealed later his new monstrous transformation seemed to be permanent and the personality of Curt Connors appeared completely lost. However, when this savage mindless Lizard later unexpectedly encountered Dr. Connors himself while Connors was helping Peter, Curt became the true Lizard once again and saved his family by killing the &quot;Lizard-clone.&quot; It was revealed that the Lizard clone was a scientific accident resulting from an experimental formula being tested on a piece of the original Lizard&#x27;s tail, which had then grown into a fully formed second creature.

Although reunited after Curt&#x27;s apparent death, Martha and Billy were diagnosed with cancer after being exposed to carcinogens from living near an industrial lab in Florida. Spider-Man assisted Curt in successfully forcing Monnano, the lab&#x27;s owner, to admit culpability, but Martha died from her cancer. Billy recovered but remained bitter towards his father. Curt&#x27;s guilt and internalized anger led him to become the Lizard once again, and once human, Curt attempted a bank robbery so that he would be sent to prison. After a short-lived term, Connors was released and changed into the Lizard once more, this time due to a scheme by Norman Osborn to form the Sinister Twelve to kill Spider-Man. The Sinister Twelve were defeated and captured by the combined forces of Daredevil, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers.

The Lizard resurfaced to face Spider-Man with the aid of Billy Connors, who was changed into an adolescent Lizard by his father. Both the Lizard and his son were captured and reverted. Billy&#x27;s transformational ability has been ignored since. A new Sinister Six team, including new member the Lizard, appeared during the superhero &quot;Civil War&quot;, but it was stopped by Captain America and his Secret Avengers.

Post-&quot;Civil War&quot;, Curt Connors aided Spider-Man in developing a cure for the victims of Mister Hyde who were mutated with unstable versions of Spider-Man&#x27;s powers. Dr. Connors has also monitored the progress of the hero Komodo, a female grad student who stole a sample of Connors&#x27;s Lizard formula. She modified the formula for her own DNA to grow back her missing legs and to give herself reptilian powers.

===&quot;Brand New Day&quot; (2008) and beyond===
Doctor Curt Connors appeared in the 2008 &quot;Brand New Day&quot; storyline, where he experimented with animal stem cells as well as aiding forensic specialist Carlie Cooper. The third Freak mistook Connors&#x27;s stem cells experiment for drugs. Connors helped Spider-Man defeat the Freak during their second encounter.

During the events of &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;, Curt Connors was working for the pharmaceutical company Phelcorp under executive Brian King. Connors had lost custody of his son, Billy, and started hearing the voice of the Lizard persona goading him to let it have control. After Connors&#x27;s assistant slept with King, Connors began struggling to contain the Lizard, ultimately losing control when King stopped him from taking a dose of his Lizard suppressing antidote. When Connors changed into the Lizard, he devoured King as a rival male. Knowing that the Lizard has targeted Connors&#x27;s son Billy in the past, Peter Parker decides to protect Billy and swings to his foster parents&#x27; home. There, he finds that Billy was kidnapped and his new parents are being held hostage by Ana Kravinoff. Ana had left Billy in an alley, where the Lizard ate him, the trauma of which functionally destroyed the Connors persona. No longer having Connors internally warring with the Lizard, he enters a metamorphosis, emerging in a new form, sporting a leaner physique, long brown spikes on its head, spikes on its right forearm, human intelligence, and the ability to telepathically communicate with the underdeveloped &quot;lizard hindbrain&quot; portion of human brains. He demonstrated the latter ability by triggering the instinctual prey response of Spider-man&#x27;s lizard brain, temporarily overwhelming the superhero and causing him to flee in terror. Back on the street, the Lizard mentally triggered the lizard portion of numerous people&#x27;s brains, causing them to behave in savage and often violent ways. Away from the Lizard, Spider-Man ingested Connors&#x27;s Lizard suppressant formula, temporarily making him immune to the Lizard&#x27;s mind controlling powers. Spider-Man then injected the Lizard with some of the formula, hoping that Connors would be able to resume control. Although Connors is no longer present, the formula does increase the prominence of the Lizard&#x27;s &quot;monkey brain&quot;, aka the human intelligence portion of its brain. This causes him to consider (and regret) some of his actions, including killing Billy and trying to make people embrace their lizard instincts. Reverting most of the people he had affected with his telepathic powers, The Lizard disappeared into the sewers after the fight.

During the &quot;Origin of the Species&quot;, the Lizard joined Doctor Octopus&#x27;s supervillain team and stole Menace&#x27;s baby. As Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man fought within the Lizard&#x27;s hideout, the Lizard at first attacked Spider-Man, but then gladly returned the baby. He revealed that he already took a blood sample from the baby and found out that Norman Osborn was not the father; therefore, the baby was useless to him and all of the villains. Doctor Octopus, angry about the Lizard&#x27;s hypnotism obstructing his intellect, attacked him while Spider-Man escaped with the baby. Both Doctor Octopus and the Lizard survived this fight.

A short time later, while investigating kidnappings in New York, the X-Men found themselves working with Spider-Man after they discovered that the abductor is the Lizard, who had been turning the victims into lizard people, while maintaining his control over the city&#x27;s reptile population. The X-Men and Spider-Man discovered that the Lizard was being used by the Dark Beast, who had given the Lizard his &#x27;reptilian shift&#x27; abilities by using a machine. During the battle, the Lizard shifted Gambit, Storm, and Wolverine into lizard people. Emma Frost and Spider-Man escaped the machine&#x27;s effects, released the Lizard and used him to defeat the Dark Beast, who was arrested while the Lizard escaped.

Sometime later, Michael Morbius discovered that the Lizard had used DNA samples from Billy Connors&#x27; corpse to restore Curt Connors to humanity. Unfortunately, the Lizard&#x27;s psyche was still present and was pretending to be Connors so that he would be left alone. The Lizard/Connors released blood into the air supply to provoke Morbius into attacking the other lab workers. The Lizard/Connors then tried to recreate his original Lizard formula so that he could change again, but Morbius&#x27; cure instead only allowed him to regrow his missing arm. The Lizard/Connors then injected Max Modell and other Horizon Lab personnel with his formula to discover how to &quot;cure&quot; himself. Attempting to appear to be the &quot;normal&quot; Connors, the Lizard/Connors cut off his regrown limb, but the Lizard began to appreciate human life, to the point that when he found the correct Lizard serum, he contemplated remaining human, but he took the cure when Spider-Man arrived and threatened him with custody. This resulted in yet another streamlined, new form. A new cure was developed for the lab employees that he had changed, but this formula failed on the Lizard&#x27;s new form; he was instead knocked out and taken to the Raft. Visiting him in the Raft, Spider-Man was unaware that the serum had restored Connors&#x27; psyche and Connors remained in prison willingly, as he felt that he deserved it for his actions as the Lizard.

During the &quot;Dying Wish&quot; storyline, Peter Parker (whose mind was trapped within Doctor Octopus&#x27; dying body) was freed from the Raft by the Trapster, Hydro-Man, and the Scorpion. The Trapster offered to free the Lizard, but Connors declined. When Morbius the Living Vampire managed to escape his cell, the Lizard pointed out that he still had nowhere to go. For unknown reasons, Morbius then freed the Lizard.

The Lizard was then seen back in his cell, being one of the few inmates left to be transported out of the decommissioned Raft. When Alistair Smythe attempted an escape from the Raft, he temporarily shut down the Raft&#x27;s power, letting the Lizard out of his cell. The Lizard protected J. Jonah Jameson from the Scorpion, revealing that he had the mind of Curt Connors, and that he &quot;will never let the monsters win again.&quot; Jameson defended the Lizard from the Raft&#x27;s warden, calling him a hero, and protesting the use of a restraining device, though the Lizard himself preferred to be cautious. During Smythe&#x27;s final escape attempt, the Lizard was impaled through the shoulder, but survived.

As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; as part of the lead-up to the &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; storyline, the Lizard was shown at the Andry Corrections Facility. He was escorted to the visitor&#x27;s room and his restraints were removed. After the guards left the visitor&#x27;s room, the Lizard met the mysterious red-suited man where he claimed to have met Curt Connors before. The Lizard detected familiar scents accompanying the man, scents that could not be there, and warned him not to toy with the Lizard. The red-suited man replied that he was not the Lizard; inside he was Curt Connors, a model prisoner who saved Mayor J. Jonah Jameson and various civilians before and was trapped in a monster&#x27;s body. The Lizard lashed out at him, demanding to know how can the people that he was smelling be there. The man said that the Lizard had abilities that he could use and if he escaped and joined him, he could give him anything. He snapped his fingers and Martha Connors and Billy Connors stepped forward, where they were somehow alive. The red-suited man asked if they have a deal. The Lizard tearfully accepted his deal. It was revealed that the revived Martha Connors and Billy Connors were clones that the red-suited man had gathered to grow clones with false memories that span all the way to their deaths. The Lizard and a depowered Electro were later sprung from Andry Corrections Facility by the Rhino on the red-suited man&#x27;s behalf. The Lizard worked with the Jackal on a procedure that would repower Electro. The first time it was interrupted, the Lizard was present when the Jackal summoned a somehow-revived Francine appears to convince Maxwell to go through with it. The second time it was interrupted was when Martha Connors informed everyone present about a fire in Edmond, Oklahoma that neither of them was responsible for. While escaping from New U Technologies, Spider-Man and Spider-Woman of Earth-65 quickly incapacitate the Lizard. When Doctor Octopus pulled a switch which activated the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and caused them to start rapidly decaying, the Lizard saw that Martha Connors and Billy Connors were affected. During the ensuing battle, the Lizard escaped with Martha and Billy as he vowed to find a way to keep them from dying. In the sewers of San Francisco, the Lizard saved Martha and Billy Connors from the Carrion Virus by injecting them with the Lizard formula, turning his wife and son into lizard people like himself.

Connors was later shown having returned to Empire State University, now using a special chip implanted in the back of his neck to control his Lizard persona, with the chip acting as an inhibitor that stopped him from attacking humans. Teaching once again, Connors offered to support Peter Parker&#x27;s efforts to re-apply for his doctorate after he was academically disgraced by accusations of plagiarism of Otto Octavius&#x27; thesis since Doctor Octopus&#x27; mind was in Peter&#x27;s body at the time. The inhibitor proved to be a disadvantage when Connors&#x27; class was attacked by the Taskmaster and the Black Ant and he could not defend himself.

When Connors was captured by Kraven the Hunter as part of his organized hunt for various animal-themed villains, he was locked in a cell with Spider-Man while the two of them watched live footage of the Black Cat and the Lizard-esque Billy Connors being hunted, with Billy admitting that he actually remembers his original death. Faced with a threat to his son, Connors asked Spider-Man to tear out the inhibitor chip so that he could rescue his son, despite the risk of this action leaving Connors paralyzed at best, the two unaware that Kraven had set the situation up precisely to force Spider-Man into a position where he would become the ruthless warrior that Kraven believes that he &#x27;should&#x27; be. However, Connors managed to maintain control and retrieve Billy without killing anyone.

In a prelude to the &quot;Sinister War&quot; storyline, Doctor Octopus coerced Curt Connors into using the Isotope Genome Accelerator on himself which separates him from his Lizard side. Kindred then completed the Sinister Six by having Mysterio join him as Kindred notes that his endgame with Spider-Man is approaching. Spider-Man found Connors in his wrecked lab as he was informed on what happened. Peter then took Connors home in the sewer to recover with his family. Spider-Man suspects that Doctor Octopus is forming his latest incarnation of the Sinister Six. Lizard&#x27;s Isotope Genome Accelerator duplicate and the rest of the Sinister Six proceeded to compete with the other villains that Kindred enlisted to take out Spider-Man. Doctor Octopus managed to have all the villains subdued when he hacked into Black Ant&#x27;s helmet by changing the setting to centipedes which affected the centipedes in every villains&#x27; head.

During the &quot;Beyond&quot; storyline, Maxine Danger of the Beyond Corporation sent Misty Knight and Colleen Wing into the sewers where they apprehended Lizard&#x27;s Isotope Genome Accelerator duplicate. Upon being taken to Beyond Corporation&#x27;s secret facility on Staten Island, the genetic template of Lizard&#x27;s Isotope Genome Accelerator duplicate was combined with the genetic template of Morbius the Living Vampire to create a binary clone called Creature Z which looks like a white version of Lizard with the fangs and wings of a vampire bat. After the facility was destroyed by Monica Rambeau and the Machine Man Imposter and Creature Z was overloaded with the blood it sucked out, Lizard&#x27;s Isotope Genome Accelerator duplicate was rescued by Morbius. As Morbius planned to work with him in curing their conditions, he is unaware that the Lizard he rescued is an Istopte Genome accelerator duplicate.

During the &quot;Blood Hunt&quot; storyline, Spider-Man was fighting some vampires until he ran into Lizard&#x27;s Isotope Genome Accelerator duplicate. Lizard&#x27;s Isotope Genome Accelerator duplicate was revealed to be recruited by Misty Knight to help look for Morbius the Living Vampire and Colleen Wing. They fought against the vampires and found a computer in a fake church established by the Beyond Corporation.

==Powers and abilities==
Dr. Curtis Connors gave himself superhuman powers as a result of exposure to the Lizard Formula, allowing him to transform into the Lizard. In human form, he has none of his superhuman powers, but he is highly intelligent and a well known scientist in fields of genetics, physics, biochemistry and herpetology.

When Connors is transformed into the Lizard, his strength is increased to superhuman levels. Likewise, his speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes are also raised to a level equivalent to that of Spider-Man. He can also scale walls using a combination of his sharp claws and micro-scales on his hands and feet that create molecular friction like those of a gecko. He is highly resistant to injury due to his thick scaly hide, allowing him to resist punctures and lacerations from ordinary weapons and lower-caliber firearms. In addition, the Lizard has highly enhanced healing abilities which allow him to quickly recover from grievous wounds, including regenerating lost limbs. He also has a powerful tail which he can whip at high speeds. The Lizard has razor-sharp teeth set in muscular jaws that can deal a lethal bite (the latter is established in the Lizard&#x27;s later appearances; in his earlier appearances he seems to have no teeth at all). Like a reptile, he has cold-blooded characteristics and is therefore sensitive to drops in temperature; a sufficiently cold environment will cause his metabolism to slow drastically and become dormant if he is exposed to cold temperatures for too long.

The Lizard can mentally communicate and command all reptiles within a mile of himself via limited telepathy. He has also on at least one occasion secreted powerful pheromones which caused nearby humans to behave violently. Post-&quot;Brand New Day&quot;, a further enhancement of his telepathy granted him the power of telepathically compelling humans to act out their primal urges, by suppressing emotional control in their amygdala (the &quot;lizard brain&quot;).

Based on various physiological and environmental factors, the Lizard&#x27;s intelligence can range from bestial and animalistic to normal human intelligence. The Lizard personality has most often manifested with human intelligence, capable of speech and higher reasoning, although some versions have been more feral than others. During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; in particular, he appeared less ruthless than his normal portrayal, showing concern for Volcana and the Wasp after they showed him kindness despite his usual disdain for humans. However, even when operating at the level of a human, the Lizard is rarely as intelligent as Dr. Connors, showing on many occasions an inability to understand his human self&#x27;s work and use it to further his own ends despite his best efforts.

The Lizard has apparently &quot;destroyed&quot; the Curt Connors persona, but has subsequently begun to display some of Connors&#x27;s human emotions. In contrast to his previously feral nature, he has also shown sufficient intellectual capabilities to replicate Connors&#x27; work for himself, although he is still hampered by his inability to fully comprehend human emotions.

== Continuity ==
In a 2004 story arc entitled &quot;Lizard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, written by Paul Jenkins in the &quot;Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; comic book, it was revealed that the Lizard persona was not a separate personality from Dr. Connors after all — Curt had been consciously controlling his reptilian alter ego all along. Furthermore, Connors was shown to know that Peter Parker was Spider-Man, despite the discovery of the secret identity never being explained or depicted. The story ended with Dr. Connors deliberately getting himself sent to prison and hoping the Lizard would not be unleashed again. The Lizard&#x27;s next appearance after this was as a member of the Sinister Twelve, where he showed no indication of being controlled by the mind of Dr. Connors. Although the idea of Connors controlling the Lizard was subsequently ignored, when the Lizard&#x27;s mind was briefly trapped in Connors&#x27; human form, he attempted to mutate the staff of Horizon Labs into lizard people like himself, with none of the other lizards demonstrating the same hostility to humans as the Lizard, prompting Spider-Man to speculate that the Lizard&#x27;s anti-human traits came from Connors&#x27; anger at the world for his lost arm and family rather than the Lizard being completely separate from Connors.

Another continuity-related issue involves Connors&#x27; son Billy. Unlike many other Marvel Comics children, he has not appreciably grown up since the comics&#x27; stories of the 1960s. Billy&#x27;s visible age also seems to waver back and forth between approximately eight and 13 years old, depending on the particular comic artist drawing the character.

In the episode &quot;Where Crawls the Lizard&quot;, he works on a serum intended to cure &quot;swamp fever&quot;, only for it to transform him into the Lizard Man. He plots to create an army of lizard people like himself and take over the world until Spider-Man foils his plans and restores him to his human form. In &quot;Conner&#x27;s Reptiles&quot;, Conner experiments with increasing reptiles&#x27; intelligence, but inadvertently turns a regular alligator into another humanoid lizard called Reptilla (voiced by Paul Soles). It kidnaps Conner, but Spider-Man rescues the latter and restores Reptilla.

* Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard appears in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1994), voiced by Joseph Campanella. This version maintains his genius-level intellect as the Lizard coupled with his alter ego&#x27;s savage mindset from the comics. In the pilot episode &quot;Night of the Lizard&quot;, Connors transforms into the eponymous character after using himself as a test subject for his experiments with lizard DNA in the hopes of regenerating his right arm. While transformed, the Lizard abducts his wife Margaret and attempts to transform New York&#x27;s population into lizards like himself, only to be defeated by Spider-Man and restored to his human form. In &quot;The Lizard King&quot;, a number of sewer lizards become mutated by Connors&#x27;s chemicals and abduct him, who transforms into the Lizard to become their king. With Debra Whitman&#x27;s help, Margaret and Mary Jane Watson create a cure, which Spider-Man administers, restoring the mutated lizards to normal. In the three-part episode &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, the Lizard is among several supervillains that the Beyonder transports to an alien planet to engage in a war against a team of heroes led by Spider-Man, though the Lizard defects to the heroes&#x27; side after Iron Man and Mister Fantastic use a machine to allow Connors&#x27;s mind to take control of the Lizard&#x27;s body. After the war ends, Connors is returned to Earth with no memory of what happened.
* Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard appears in the &quot;Spider-Man: The New Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Law of the Jungle&quot;, voiced by Rob Zombie. This version is Peter Parker&#x27;s science teacher at Empire State University who lost his right arm as a result of an accident while testing Oscorp Industries&#x27; Wide Area Fragmentation Explosive Round (WAFER). Connors intentionally transforms into the Lizard to exact revenge, maintaining his intelligence and ability to speak.

Spider-Man tries to reason with him, but the Lizard lunges at him, accidentally cutting the webbing and falling to his death.
* Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard appears in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.

* Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard appears in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, voiced by Tom Kenny in the first season and subsequently by Dee Bradley Baker. This version is a S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist. After being forced to amputate his right arm following the Green Goblin&#x27;s attack on the Helicarrier during the first season finale, the second season sees Connors and Spider-Man retrieve several of Doctor Octopus&#x27;s animal DNA formulas to study for potential medicinal use. He injects himself with the lizard formula, which restores his right arm, but mutates him into the Lizard until Spider-Man helps restore his human form. In subsequent appearances, the Lizard joins the Sinister Six and gains the ability to mutate others via his bite.
** A vampiric alternate universe variant of the Lizard called the Lizard King appears in the episode &quot;Return to the Spider-Verse&quot;, also voiced by Baker. The ruler of a vampire-infested world, he collaborates with Wolf Spider to obtain a Siege Perilous fragment and block out the sun.

===Film===
* Dr. Curt Connors appears in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy, portrayed by Dylan Baker. This version is a former college classmate and friend of Otto Octavius and a Columbia University physics professor who is concerned for Peter Parker&#x27;s well-being and academic performance in his quantum mechanics course. While Connors does not become the Lizard in this continuity, Raimi, Baker and producer Grant Curtis expressed interest in exploring the concept in sequels.
* Rhys Ifans portrays Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard in two Marvel films. This version is an Oscorp biologist and former partner of Richard Parker whose research focused on genetically combining animal traits with humans to improve health. Additionally, Connors is a sympathetic yet misguided individual driven by the loss of his right arm and a desire to do genuine good while his Lizard alter-ego is more feral than most incarnations despite retaining Connors&#x27; intelligence. Additionally, he does not wear clothes and has a less pronounced snout, giving him a more humanoid appearance.
** Connors first appears in the Sony film &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (2012). Peter Parker finds Richard&#x27;s notes and visits Connors to continue what he and Richard started. The two successfully formulate a serum together, which Connors injects himself with after being fired from Oscorp for refusing to rush into human trials. The serum regenerates Connors&#x27; lost arm, but eventually mutates him into the Lizard, who goes on a rampage until Spider-Man intervenes. Escaping into the sewer, he reverts to his human self, but the effects of the serum makes him obsessed with his abilities. He builds a makeshift off-site lab while the Lizard persona further corrupts his mind by manipulating him to experiment on himself further. The Lizard discovers Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity, develops a mind of his own, and asserts himself as the dominant personality while seeking to mutate all of New York into lizards like himself. However, Spider-Man foils his plan with Captain George Stacy&#x27;s help and cures him. With the Lizard&#x27;s personality gone and his sanity restored, Connors surrenders to the authorities. In the film&#x27;s mid-credits scene, Connors is remanded to Beloit Psychiatric Hospital, where he speaks with the Gentleman regarding the Parkers&#x27; knowledge of him.
** Ifans reprised his role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021). Sometime after learning Peter&#x27;s secret identity, Connors is transported to an alternate universe (MCU), where he is found and imprisoned by Doctor Strange alongside other alternate universe-displaced supervillains. He encounters the MCU&#x27;s version of Peter Parker, who offers to cure them and avert their original fates upon returning to their respective universes. Skeptical of this for fear of unforeseen consequences, Connors joins Green Goblin in fighting back. The former later joins Sandman and Electro in fighting three Spider-Men before he is eventually defeated and cured by the second Parker. After reverting to his human form, Strange returns Connors and the other displaced individuals to their respective home universes.
* The &quot;Spider-Gwen&quot; incarnation of Peter Parker / Lizard makes minor appearances in &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; (2018) and its sequel &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (2023), voiced by Jack Quaid in the latter film.

<text>Dore is a large village in the Sheffield district, in the county of South Yorkshire, England. The village lies on a hill above the River Sheaf which gave Sheffield its name and, until 1934, was part of Derbyshire but it is now a suburb of the city.

Dore and Totley was the only ward of the city which regularly elected a Conservative councillor; however, as of May 2016, all three councillors were Liberal Democrats. The Member of Parliament for the Sheffield Hallam constituency, of which Dore is part, is Olivia Blake (Labour) who was elected in 2019.

==History==

The name &quot;Dore&quot; is most likely to derive from one of two possible origins. It could be the same Old English root as &quot;door&quot;, signifying a &#x27;gateway&#x27; or pass between two kingdoms. Alternatively, it could be associated with the Cymric (Welsh) &#x27;dwr&#x27; (dur) for water, as is also found in Dour in Fife, Aberdeen and Kent, Dorchester in Dorset, Durra in Cornwall, and Doro in Ireland. This Welsh derivation would refer to the streams that meet at Dore. The Limb Brook, River Sheaf, and Meers Brook marked the boundary between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Deira (later Northumbria) and Mercia.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; contains the earliest written record of Dore, recording that in 827 (more likely 829) King Egbert of Wessex led his army to the village to receive the submission of King Eanred of Northumbria, thereby establishing his overlordship over the whole of Anglo-Saxon Britain:
It can therefore be reasonably argued that Egbert became the first king of all England at Dore. A plaque commemorating the event was erected on the village green in 1968 by the Dore Village Society. The Old School was built in 1821 on the site of a previous school, on the right hand side was the teacher&#x27;s accommodation. When Dore&#x27;s new school was opened, the Old School was restored and opened as a community centre.
Christ Church is Grade II listed and was built in 1828 and Dore became a separate parish in 1844. Dore remained a small village, having a population of just 500 in the 19th century, until it became part of Sheffield in 1934.

A paper mill was built on Avenue Farm in the 17th century, Joshua Tyzack converted the building into a scythe forge in 1839 and in 1881 built a large house next to the forge as a country retreat, his initials can be seen above the front door. In 1932 Dore&#x27;s Parish council built a memorial commemorating the deaths of the First World War.

Dore was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Dronfield, in 1866 Dore became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished and merged with Sheffield. In 1931 the parish had a population of 2684. It is now in the unparished area of Sheffield.

==Brinkburn Grange==

Brinkburn Grange was built in 1883 by Thomas B. Matthews. The land was part of Bradway Mill and Matthews was director of Turton Brothers &amp; Matthews, a Sheffield steel, file and spring makers. The mill dam was then used as an ornamental lake. The Grange was demolished in 1938.

==Sheffield Clarion Club House==
Dore Moor was the site chosen for the Sheffield Clarion Club House, often known as the Dore Moor Clarion Club House. This was an independent socialist social centre which continued operating until 1967, by which time the club house was more or less defunct.

==Schools==

Schools in Dore include Dore Primary School, King Ecgbert School (secondary) and the Rowan Primary Special School. There is also the old school which is used for social events such as brownies.

==Transport==

The village is served by Dore and Totley railway station on the Hope Valley Line between Sheffield and Manchester, via . Services generally operate hourly in each direction.

The railway tunnel between Dore and Totley, under a limb of the Pennines to Grindleford in Derbyshire, is the longest main line railway tunnel in England and is second only in Great Britain to the Severn Tunnel between England and South Wales.

==Sport==

Abbeydale Park, a former county cricket ground for both Derbyshire and Yorkshire, lies just north of the suburb.

==Residents==
Notable residents include: 

* Gary Megson, a former footballer and manager of Sheffield Wednesday

* Dave Bassett, former footballer and former manager of Southampton, Watford, Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest

* Chris Waddle, former England international footballer and player with Sheffield Wednesday and Tottenham Hotspur football clubs. 

* Bryan Robson, the former Sheffield United manager and Manchester United player, owns a penthouse in the village.

* Former England footballer and captain, the late Emlyn Hughes, lived in the village.

* Michael Vaughan, former Yorkshire County Cricket Club cricketer and former captain of the England cricket team, is a resident.

* Joe Root, also of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, a notable batter and England&#x27;s former cricket captain, was born and raised in Dore.

* Sheffield-born Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis-Hill, who attended the King Ecgbert School in Dore, purchased a property in the village in 2012.

<doc id="331951" wikidata="Q854873" url="?curid=331951" title="Fish anatomy">
<text>Fish anatomy is the study of the form or morphology of fish. It can be contrasted with fish physiology, which is the study of how the component parts of fish function together in the living fish. In practice, fish anatomy and fish physiology complement each other, the former dealing with the structure of a fish, its organs or component parts and how they are put together, such as might be observed on the dissecting table or under the microscope, and the latter dealing with how those components function together in living fish.

The anatomy of fish is often shaped by the physical characteristics of water, the medium in which fish live. Water is much denser than fish, holds a relatively small amount of dissolved oxygen, and absorbs more light than air does. The body of a fish is divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage (cartilaginous fish) or bone (bony fish). The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays which, with the exception of the caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.
The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and then around the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear. Low-frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, which responds to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.

Sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, and they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales. They have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large yolky eggs. Some species are ovoviviparous, having the young develop internally, but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.

The bony fish lineage shows more derived anatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum, and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping scales. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.

== Body ==
In many respects, fish anatomy is different from mammalian anatomy. However, it still shares the same basic body plan from which all vertebrates have evolved: a notochord, rudimentary vertebrae, and a well-defined head and tail.

Fish have a variety of different body plans. At the broadest level, their body is divided into the head, trunk, and tail, although the divisions are not always externally visible. The body is often , a streamlined body plan often found in fast-moving fish. Some species may be filiform (eel-shaped) or (worm-shaped). Fish are often either compressed (laterally thin and tall) or depressed (dorso-ventrally flattened).

==Skeleton==

There are two different skeletal types: the exoskeleton, which is the stable outer shell of an organism, and the endoskeleton, which forms the support structure inside the body. The skeleton of the fish is made of either cartilage (cartilaginous fishes) or bone (bony fishes). The endoskeleton of the fish is made up of two main components: the axial skeleton consisting of the skull and vertebral column, and the appendicular skeleton supporting the fins. The fins are made up of bony fin rays and, except for the caudal fin, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported only by the muscles. The ribs attach to the spine.

Bones are rigid organs that form part of the endoskeleton of vertebrates. They function to move, support, and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells and store minerals. Bone tissue is a type of dense connective tissue. Bones come in a variety of shapes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight, yet strong and hard, in addition to fulfilling their many other biological functions.

==Vertebrae==


Fish are vertebrates. All vertebrates are built along the basic chordate body plan: a stiff rod running through the length of the animal (vertebral column or notochord), with a hollow tube of nervous tissue (the spinal cord) above it and the gastrointestinal tract below. In all vertebrates, the mouth is found at, or right below, the anterior end of the animal, while the anus opens to the exterior before the end of the body. The remaining part of the body beyond the anus forms a tail with vertebrae and the spinal cord, but no gut.

The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, in which the notochord (a stiff rod of uniform composition) found in all chordates has been replaced by a segmented series of stiffer elements (vertebrae) separated by mobile joints (intervertebral discs, derived embryonically and evolutionarily from the notochord). However, a few fish have secondarily lost this anatomy, retaining the notochord into adulthood, such as the sturgeon.

The vertebral column consists of a centrum (the central body or spine of the vertebra), vertebral arches which protrude from the top and bottom of the centrum, and various processes which project from the centrum or arches. An arch extending from the top of the centrum is called a neural arch, while the haemal arch or chevron is found underneath the centrum in the caudal vertebrae of fish. The centrum of a fish is usually concave at each end (amphicoelous), which limits the motion of the fish. In contrast, the centrum of a mammal is flat at each end (acoelous), a shape that can support and distribute compressive forces.

The vertebrae of lobe-finned fishes consist of three discrete bony elements. The vertebral arch surrounds the spinal cord, and is broadly similar in form to that found in most other vertebrates. Just beneath the arch lies the small plate-like pleurocentrum, which protects the upper surface of the notochord. Below that, a larger arch-shaped intercentrum protects the lower border. Both of these structures are embedded within a single cylindrical mass of cartilage. A similar arrangement was found in primitive tetrapods, but in the evolutionary line that led to reptiles, mammals and birds, the intercentrum became partially or wholly replaced by an enlarged pleurocentrum, which in turn became the bony vertebral body.

In most ray-finned fishes, including all teleosts, these two structures are fused with and embedded within a solid piece of bone superficially resembling the vertebral body of mammals. In living amphibians, there is simply a cylindrical piece of bone below the vertebral arch, with no trace of the separate elements present in the early tetrapods.

In cartilaginous fish such as sharks, the vertebrae consist of two cartilaginous tubes. The upper tube is formed from the vertebral arches, but also includes additional cartilaginous structures filling in the gaps between the vertebrae, enclosing the spinal cord in an essentially continuous sheath. The lower tube surrounds the notochord and has a complex structure, often including multiple layers of calcification.

Lampreys have vertebral arches, but nothing resembling the vertebral bodies found in all higher vertebrates. Even the arches are discontinuous, consisting of separate pieces of arch-shaped cartilage around the spinal cord in most parts of the body, changing to long strips of cartilage above and below in the tail region. Hagfishes lack a true vertebral column, but a few tiny neural arches are present in the tail. Hagfishes do, however, possess a cranium. For this reason, hagfishes have sometimes been excluded from Vertebrata in the past, and instead placed as a sister group of vertebrates within the taxon &quot;Craniata&quot;. Molecular analyses since 1992 have shown that hagfishes are the sister group of lampreys within the clade Cyclostomi, and therefore are vertebrates in a phylogenetic sense.

==Head==


The head or skull includes the skull roof (a set of bones covering the brain, eyes and nostrils), the snout (from the eye to the forward-most point of the upper jaw), the operculum or gill cover (absent in sharks and jawless fish), and the cheek, which extends from the eye to the preopercle. The operculum and preopercle may or may not have spines. In sharks and some primitive bony fish the spiracle, a small extra gill opening, is found behind each eye.

The skull in fishes is formed from a series of only loosely connected bones. Jawless fish and sharks only possess a cartilaginous endocranium, with the upper and lower jaws of cartilaginous fish being separate elements not attached to the skull. Bony fishes have additional dermal bone, forming a more or less coherent skull roof in lungfish and holost fish. The lower jaw defines a chin.

In lampreys, the mouth is formed into an oral disk. In most jawed fish, however, there are three general configurations. The mouth may be on the forward end of the head (terminal), may be upturned (superior), or may be turned downwards or on the bottom of the fish (subterminal or inferior). The mouth may be modified into a suckermouth adapted for clinging onto objects in fast-moving water.

The simpler structure is found in jawless fish, in which the cranium is represented by a trough-like basket of cartilaginous elements only partially enclosing the brain and associated with the capsules for the inner ears and the single nostril. Distinctively, these fish have no jaws.

Cartilaginous fish such as sharks also have simple, and presumably primitive, skull structures. The cranium is a single structure forming a case around the brain, enclosing the lower surface and the sides, but always at least partially open at the top as a large fontanelle. The most anterior part of the cranium includes a forward plate of cartilage, the rostrum, and capsules to enclose the olfactory organs. Behind these are the orbits, and then an additional pair of capsules enclosing the structure of the inner ear. Finally, the skull tapers towards the rear, where the foramen magnum lies immediately above a single condyle, articulating with the first vertebra. Smaller foramina for the cranial nerves can be found at various points throughout the cranium. The jaws consist of separate hoops of cartilage, almost always distinct from the cranium proper.

In the ray-finned fishes, there has also been considerable modification from the primitive pattern. The roof of the skull is generally well formed, and although the exact relationship of its bones to those of tetrapods is unclear, they are usually given similar names for convenience. Other elements of the skull, however, may be reduced; there is little cheek region behind the enlarged orbits, and little if any bone in between them. The upper jaw is often formed largely from the premaxilla, with the maxilla itself located further back, and an additional bone, the sympletic, linking the jaw to the rest of the cranium.

Although the skulls of fossil lobe-finned fish resemble those of the early tetrapods, the same cannot be said of those of the living lungfishes. The skull roof is not fully formed, and consists of multiple, somewhat irregularly shaped bones with no direct relationship to those of tetrapods. The upper jaw is formed from the pterygoid bones and vomers alone, all of which bear teeth. Much of the skull is formed from cartilage, and its overall structure is reduced.

The head may have several fleshy structures known as barbels, which may be very long and resemble whiskers. Many fish species also have a variety of protrusions or spines on the head. The nostrils or nares of almost all fishes do not connect to the oral cavity, but are pits of varying shape and depth.

==External organs==

===Jaw===


The vertebrate jaw probably originally evolved in the Silurian period and appeared in the Placoderm fish which further diversified in the Devonian. Jaws are thought to derive from the pharyngeal arches that support the gills in fish. The two most anterior of these arches are thought to have become the jaw itself (see hyomandibula) and the hyoid arch, which braces the jaw against the braincase and increases mechanical efficiency. While there is no fossil evidence directly to support this theory, it makes sense in light of the numbers of pharyngeal arches that are visible in extant jawed animals (the gnathostomes), which have seven arches, and primitive jawless vertebrates (the Agnatha), which have nine.


It is thought that the original selective advantage garnered by the jaw was not related to feeding, but to increase respiration efficiency. The jaws were used in the buccal pump (observable in modern fish and amphibians) that pumps water across the gills of fish or air into the lungs of amphibians. Over evolutionary time, the more familiar use of jaws in feeding was selected for and became a very important function in vertebrates.

Linkage systems are widely distributed in animals. The most thorough overview of the different types of linkages in animals has been provided by M. Muller, who also designed a new classification system which is especially well suited for biological systems. Linkage mechanisms are especially frequent and various in the head of bony fishes, such as wrasses, which have evolved many specialized aquatic feeding mechanisms. Especially advanced are the linkage mechanisms of jaw protrusion. For suction feeding a system of connected four-bar linkages is responsible for the coordinated opening of the mouth and 3-D expansion of the buccal cavity. Other linkages are responsible for protrusion of the premaxilla.

===Eyes===

Fish eyes are similar to terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rod cells and cone cells (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. The ancestors of modern hagfish, thought to be protovertebrate, were evidently pushed to very deep, dark waters, where they were less vulnerable to sighted predators and where it is advantageous to have a convex eyespot, which gathers more light than a flat or concave one. Unlike humans, fish normally adjust focus by moving the lens closer to or further from the retina.

===Gills===

===Skin===
The skin of the fish are a part of the integumentary system, which contains two layers: the epidermis and the dermis layer. The epidermis is derived from the ectoderm and becomes the most superficial layer that consists entirely of live cells, with only minimal quantities of keratin. It is generally permeable. The dermis is derived from the mesoderm and resembles the little connective tissue which are composed of mostly collagen fibers found in bony fish. Some fish species have scales that emerge from the dermis, penetrate the thin layer of the basement membrane that lies between the epidermis and dermis, and becomes externally visible and covers the epidermis layer.

Generally, the skin also contains sweat glands and sebaceous glands that are both unique to mammals, but additional types of skin glands are found in fish. Found in the epidermis, fish typically have numerous individual mucus-secreting skin cells called goblet cells that produce a slimy substance to the surface of the skin. This aids in insulation and protection from bacterial infection. The skin colour of many mammals are often due to melanin found in their epidermis. In fish, however, the colour of the skin are largely due to chromatophores in the dermis, which, in addition to melanin, may contain guanine or carotenoid pigments. Many species, such as flounders, change the colour of their skin by adjusting the relative size of their chromatophores. Some fishes may also have venom glands, photophores, or cells that produce a more watery serous fluid in the dermis.
===Scales===
Also part of the fish&#x27;s integumentary system are the scales that cover the outer body of many jawed fish. The commonly known scales are the ones that originate from the dermis or mesoderm, and may be similar in structure to teeth. Some species are covered by scutes instead. Others may have no scales covering the outer body.

There are four principal types of fish scales that originate from the dermis.
* Placoid scales, also called dermal denticles, are pointed scales. They are similar to the structure of teeth, in which they are made of dentin and covered by enamel. They are typical of cartilaginous fish (even though chimaeras have it on claspers only).
* Ganoid scales are flat, basal-looking scales. Derived from placoid scales, they have a thick coat of enamel, but without the underlying layer of dentin. These scales cover the fish&#x27;s body with little overlapping. They are typical of gar and bichirs.
* Cycloid scales are small, oval-shaped scales with growth rings like the rings of a tree. They lack enamel, dentin, and a vascular bone layer. Bowfin and remora have cycloid scales.
* Ctenoid scales are similar to cycloid scales, also having growth rings, lack enamel, dentin, and a vascular bone layer. They are distinguished by spines or projections along one edge. Halibut have this type of scale.


===Lateral line===

The lateral line is a sense organ used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water. For example, fish can use their lateral line system to follow the vortices produced by fleeing prey. In most species, it consists of a line of receptors running along each side of the fish.

===Photophores===

===Fins===


Fins are the most distinctive features of fish. They are either composed of bony spines or rays protruding from the body with skin covering them and joining them together, either in a webbed fashion as seen in most bony fish, or similar to a flipper as seen in sharks. Apart from the tail or caudal fin, fins have no direct connection with the spine and are supported by muscles only. Their principal function is to help the fish swim. Fins can also be used for gliding or crawling, as seen in the flying fish and frogfish. Fins located in different places on the fish serve different purposes, such as moving forward, turning, and keeping an upright position. For every fin, there are a number of fish species in which this particular fin has been lost during evolution.

====Spines and rays====

Spines have a variety of uses. In catfish, they are used as a form of defense; many catfish have the ability to lock their spines outwards. Triggerfish also use spines to lock themselves in crevices to prevent them being pulled out.

Lepidotrichia are bony, bilaterally-paired, segmented fin rays found in bony fishes. They develop around actinotrichia as part of the dermal exoskeleton. Lepidotrichia may have some cartilage or bone in them as well. They are actually segmented and appear as a series of disks stacked one on top of another. The genetic basis for the formation of the fin rays is thought to be genes coding for the proteins actinodin 1 and actinodin 2.

====Types of fin====
* Dorsal fins: Located on the back of the fish, dorsal fins serve to prevent the fish from rolling and assist in sudden turns and stops. Most fishes have one dorsal fin, but some fishes have two or three. In anglerfish, the anterior of the dorsal fin is modified into an illicium and esca, a biological equivalent to a fishing rod and lure. The two to three bones that support the dorsal fin are called the proximal, middle, and distal pterygiophores. In spinous fins, the distal pterygiophore is often fused to the middle or not present at all.
* Caudal/Tail fins: Also called the tail fins, caudal fins are attached to the end of the caudal peduncle and used for propulsion. The caudal peduncle is the narrow part of the fish&#x27;s body. The hypural joint is the joint between the caudal fin and the last of the vertebrae. The hypural is often fan-shaped. The tail may be , reversed heterocercal, , , or .
** Heterocercal: vertebrae extend into the upper lobe of the tail, making it longer (as in sharks)
** Reversed heterocercal: vertebrae extend into the lower lobe of the tail, making it longer (as in the Anaspida)
** Protocercal: vertebrae extend to the tip of the tail; the tail is symmetrical but not expanded (as in cyclostomatans, the ancestral vertebrates and lancelets).
** Diphycercal: vertebrae extend to the tip of the tail; the tail is symmetrical and expanded (as in the bichir, lungfish, lamprey and coelacanth). Most Palaeozoic fishes had a diphycercal heterocercal tail.
** Homocercal: vertebrae extend a very short distance into the upper lobe of the tail; tail still appears superficially symmetric. Most fish have a homocercal tail, but it can be expressed in a variety of shapes. The tail fin can be rounded at the end, truncated (almost vertical edge, as in salmon), forked (ending in two prongs), emarginate (with a slight inward curve), or continuous (dorsal, caudal, and anal fins attached, as in eels). 
* Anal fins: Located on the ventral surface behind the anus, this fin is used to stabilize the fish while swimming.
* Pectoral fins: Found in pairs on each side, usually just behind the operculum. Pectoral fins are homologous to the forelimbs of tetrapods, and aid walking in several fish species such as some anglerfish and the mudskipper. A peculiar function of pectoral fins, highly developed in some fish, is the creation of the dynamic lifting force that assists some fish such as sharks in maintaining depth and also enables the &quot;flight&quot; for flying fish. Certain rays of the pectoral fins may be adapted into finger-like projections, such as in sea robins and flying gurnards. 
** &quot;Cephalic fins&quot;: The &quot;horns&quot; of manta rays and their relatives, sometimes called cephalic fins, are actually a modification of the anterior portion of the pectoral fin.
* Pelvic/Ventral fins: Found in pairs on each side ventrally below the pectoral fins, pelvic fins are homologous to the hindlimbs of tetrapods. They assist the fish in going up or down through the water, turning sharply, and stopping quickly. In gobies, the pelvic fins are often fused into a single sucker disk that can be used to attach to objects.
* Adipose fin: A soft, fleshy fin found on the back behind the dorsal fin and just in front of the caudal fin. It is absent in many fish families, but is found in Salmonidae, characins and catfishes. Its function has remained a mystery, and is frequently clipped off to mark hatchery-raised fish, though data from 2005 showed that trout with their adipose fin removed have an 8% higher tailbeat frequency. Additional research published in 2011 has suggested that the fin may be vital for the detection of and response to stimuli such as touch, sound and changes in pressure. Canadian researchers identified a neural network in the fin, indicating that it likely has a sensory function, but are still not sure exactly what the consequences of removing it are.

==Internal organs==

===Intestines===
As with other vertebrates, the intestines of fish consist of two segments, the small intestine and the large intestine. In most higher vertebrates, the small intestine is further divided into the duodenum and other parts. In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear, and the terms &quot;anterior intestine&quot; or &quot;proximal intestine&quot; may be used instead of duodenum.
In bony fish, the intestine is relatively short, typically around one and a half times the length of the fish&#x27;s body. It commonly has a number of pyloric caeca, small pouch-like structures along its length that help to increase the overall surface area of the organ for digesting food. There is no ileocaecal valve in teleosts, with the boundary between the small intestine and the rectum being marked only by the end of the digestive epithelium. There is no small intestine as such in non-teleost fish, such as sharks, sturgeons, and lungfish. Instead, the digestive part of the gut forms a &quot;spiral intestine&quot;, connecting the stomach to the rectum. In this type of gut, the intestine itself is relatively straight, but has a long fold running along the inner surface in a spiral fashion, sometimes for dozens of turns. This fold creates a valve-like structure that greatly increases both the surface area and the effective length of the intestine. The lining of the spiral intestine is similar to that of the small intestine in teleosts and non-mammalian tetrapods. In lampreys, the spiral valve is extremely small, possibly because their diet requires little digestion. Hagfish have no spiral valve at all, with digestion occurring for almost the entire length of the intestine, which is not subdivided into different regions.

===Pyloric caeca===
Many fish have a number of small outpocketings, called pyloric caeca, along their intestine. The purpose of the caeca is to increase the overall surface area of the intestines, thereby increasing the absorption of nutrients. 

The number of pyloric caeca varies widely between species, and in some species of fish no caeca are present at all. Species with few or no caeca compensate for their lack by having longer intestines, or by have taller or more convoluted intestinal villi, thereby achieving similar levels of absorptive surface area.
Lungfish also have a pouch located at the beginning of their intestine, which is also called a pyloric caecum, but it has a different structure and function that the pyloric caeca of other fish species. The lungfish caecum is homologous (due to common descent) with the caecum present in most amniotes (tetrapod vertebrates that include all mammals, reptiles, and birds). In most herbivores the caecum receives partially digested food from the small intestine, and serves as a fermentation chamber to break down cellulose (such as grass or leaves) in the diet. In carnivores the caecum is often greatly reduced or missing.

===Stomach===
As with other vertebrates, the relative positions of the esophageal and duodenal openings to the stomach remain relatively constant. As a result, the stomach always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter. However, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and some teleost fish have no stomach at all, with the esophagus opening directly into the intestine. These fish consume diets that either require little storage of food, no pre-digestion with gastric juices, or both.

===Kidneys===
The kidneys of fish are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying a significant portion of the trunk. They are similar to the mesonephros of higher vertebrates (reptiles, birds, and mammals). The kidneys contain clusters of nephrons, serviced by collecting ducts which usually drain into a mesonephric duct. However, the situation is not always so simple. In cartilaginous fish, there is also a shorter duct which drains the posterior (metanephric) parts of the kidney, and joins with the mesonephric duct at the bladder or cloaca. Indeed, in many cartilaginous fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function altogether in the adult. Hagfish and lamprey kidneys are unusually simple. They consist of a row of nephrons, each emptying directly into the mesonephric duct.
Like the Nile tilapia, the kidney of some fish shows its three parts; head, trunk, and tail kidneys.
Fish do not have a discrete adrenal gland with distinct cortex and medulla, similar to those found in mammals. The interrenal and chromaffin cells are located within the head kidney.

===Urinary bladder===

===Spleen===
The spleen is found in nearly all vertebrates. It is a non-vital organ, similar in structure to a large lymph node. It acts primarily as a blood filter, and plays important roles in regards to red blood cells and the immune system. In cartilaginous and bony fish it consists primarily of red pulp and is normally a somewhat elongated organ as it actually lies inside the serosal lining of the intestine. The only vertebrates lacking a spleen are the lampreys and hagfishes. Even in these animals, there is a diffuse layer of haematopoietic tissue within the gut wall, which has a similar structure to red pulp, and is presumed to be homologous to the spleen of higher vertebrates.

===Liver===
The liver is a large vital organ present in all fish. It has a wide range of functions, including detoxification, protein synthesis, and production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. It is very susceptible to contamination by organic and inorganic compounds because they can accumulate over time and cause potentially life-threatening conditions. Because of the liver&#x27;s capacity for detoxification and storage of harmful components, it is often used as an environmental biomarker.

===Heart===
Fish have what is often described as a two-chambered heart, consisting of one atrium to receive blood and one ventricle to pump it, in contrast to three chambers (two atria, one ventricle) of amphibian and most reptile hearts and four chambers (two atria, two ventricles) of mammal and bird hearts. However, the fish heart has entry and exit compartments that may be called chambers, so it is also sometimes described as three-chambered, or four-chambered, depending on what is counted as a chamber. The atrium and ventricle are sometimes considered &quot;true chambers&quot;, while the others are considered &quot;accessory chambers&quot;. In similarity to humans, fish have a closed circulatory system where the blood is contained in a circuit of blood vessels, and the blood never leaves these vessels. Deoxygenated blood is carried from the veins to the heart from different parts of the body. The blood from the heart is then pumped to the gills to be oxygenated, and is then circulated through the rest of the body.

The four compartments are arranged sequentially:
# Sinus venosus: A thin-walled sac or reservoir with some cardiac muscle that collects deoxygenated blood through the incoming hepatic and cardinal veins.
# Atrium: A thicker-walled, muscular chamber that sends blood to the ventricle.
# Ventricle: A thick-walled, muscular chamber that pumps the blood to the fourth part, the outflow tract. The shape of the ventricle varies considerably, usually tubular in fish with elongated bodies, pyramidal with a triangular base in others, or sometimes sac-like in some marine fish.
# Outflow tract (OFT): Goes to the ventral aorta and consists of the tubular conus arteriosus, bulbus arteriosus, or both. The conus arteriosus, typically found in more primitive species of fish, contracts to assist blood flow to the aorta, while the bulbus anteriosus does not.
Ostial valves, consisting of flap-like connective tissues, prevent blood from flowing backward through the compartments. The ostial valve between the sinus venosus and atrium is called the sino-atrial valve, which closes during ventricular contraction. Between the atrium and ventricle is an ostial valve called the atrioventricular valve, and between the bulbus arteriosus and ventricle is an ostial valve called the bulbo-ventricular valve. The conus arteriosus has a variable number of semilunar valves.

The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta is divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).

The circulatory systems of all vertebrates are closed. Fish have the simplest circulatory system, consisting of only one circuit, with the blood being pumped through the capillaries of the gills and on to the capillaries of the body tissues. This is known as &quot;single cycle&quot; circulation.

In the adult fish, the four compartments are not arranged in a straight row, instead forming an S-shape with the latter two compartments lying above the former two. This relatively simpler pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the ray-finned fish. In teleosts, the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described as part of the aorta rather than of the heart proper. The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes, presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable.

===Swim bladder===


===Weberian apparatus===
Fishes of the superorder Ostariophysi possess a structure called the Weberian apparatus, a modification which allows them to hear better. This ability may explain the marked success of ostariophysian fishes. The apparatus is made up of a set of bones known as Weberian ossicles, a chain of small bones that connect the auditory system to the swim bladder of fishes. The ossicles connect the gas bladder wall with Y-shaped lymph sinus that is next to the lymph-filled transverse canal joining the saccules of the right and left ears. This allows the transmission of vibrations to the inner ear. A fully functioning Weberian apparatus consists of the swim bladder, the Weberian ossicles, a portion of the anterior vertebral column, and some muscles and ligaments.

== Reproductive organs ==


Fish reproductive organs include testicles and ovaries. In most species, gonads are paired organs of similar size, which can be partially or totally fused. There may also be a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness. The genital papilla is a small, fleshy tube behind the anus in teleost fishes from which the sperm or eggs are released; the sex of a fish often can be determined by the shape of its papilla. Sex determination in fish, which is dependent on intrinsic genetic factors, is followed by sex differentiation through gene expression of feedback mechanisms that ensure the stability of the levels of particular hormones and cellular profile. However, the hermaphroditic species are an exception in which they are able to alter the course of sex differentiation in order to maximize their fitness. There are various determination mechanisms for gonadal sex in fish and processes that aid development of the gonadal function. Gonadal sex is influenced by a number of factors, including cell-autonomous genetic mechanisms, endocrine, paracrine, behavioral, or environmental signals. This results in the primordial germ cells (PGCs) to be able to interpret internal or external stimuli to develop into spermatogonia or oogonia. Spermatogenesis in testes is a process in which spermatogonia differentiates into spermatocytes through mitosis and meiosis, which halves the number of chromosomes, creating haploid spermatids. During spermiogenesis, the last stage of spermatogenesis, the haploid spermatids develop into spermatozoa. In the ovaries, oogonia also undergo mitosis and meiosis during oogenesis, and this gives rise to primary oocytes and then eventually the ovum. The primary oocyte divides and produces the secondary oocyte as well as a polar body, before the secondary oocyte develops into the haploid ootid.
===Testes===
Most male fish have two testes of similar size. In the case of sharks, the testis on the right side is usually larger. The primitive jawless fish have only a single testis located in the midline of the body, although even this forms from the fusion of paired structures in the embryo.

Under a tough membranous shell, the tunica albuginea, the testis of some teleost fish, contains very fine coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules. The tubules are lined with a layer of cells (germ cells) that from puberty into old age, develop into sperm cells (also known as spermatozoa or male gametes). The developing sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the rete testis located in the mediastinum testis, to the efferent ducts, and then to the epididymides (depending on the species) where newly created sperm cells mature (see spermatogenesis). The sperm move into the vasa deferentia, and are eventually expelled through the urethra and out of the urethral orifice through muscular contractions.

However, most fish do not possess seminiferous tubules. Instead, the sperm are produced in spherical structures called &quot;sperm ampullae&quot;. These are seasonal structures, releasing their contents during the breeding season and then being reabsorbed by the body. Before the next breeding season, new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen. The ampullae are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in higher vertebrates, including the same range of cell types.

In terms of spermatogonia distribution, the structure of teleost testes have two types: in the most common, spermatogonia occur all along the seminiferous tubules, while in Atherinomorpha, they are confined to the distal portion of these structures. Fish can present cystic or semi-cystic spermatogenesis in relation to the release phase of germ cells in cysts to the lumen of the seminiferous tubules.

===Ovaries===
Many of the features found in ovaries are common to all vertebrates, including the presence of follicular cells and tunica albuginea There may be hundreds or even millions of fertile eggs present in the ovary of a fish at any given time. Fresh eggs may be developing from the germinal epithelium throughout life. Corpora lutea are found only in mammals, and in some elasmobranch fish; in other species, the remnants of the follicle are quickly resorbed by the ovary. The ovary of teleosts is often contains a hollow, lymph-filled space which opens into the oviduct, and into which the eggs are shed. Most normal female fish have two ovaries. In some elasmobranchs, only the right ovary develops fully. In the primitive jawless fish and some teleosts, there is only one ovary, formed by the fusion of the paired organs in the embryo.

Fish ovaries may be of three types: gymnovarian, secondary gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids and a few other teleosts.

==Nervous system==

=== Central nervous system ===
Fish typically have quite small brains relative to body size compared with other vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal. However, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably mormyrids and sharks, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and marsupials.

Fish brains are divided into several regions. At the front are the olfactory lobes, a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves. Similar to the way humans smell chemicals in the air, fish smell chemicals in the water by tasting them. The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction. Together these structures form the forebrain.

The forebrain is connected to the midbrain via the diencephalon (in the diagram, this structure is below the optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis. The pineal body lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains circadian rhythms, and controls colour changes. The midbrain or mesencephalon contains the two optic lobes. These are very large in species that hunt by sight, such as rainbow trout and cichlids.

The hindbrain or metencephalon is particularly involved in swimming and balance. The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest part of the brain. Hagfish and lampreys have relatively small cerebella, while the mormyrid cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their electrical sense.

The brain stem or myelencephalon is the brain&#x27;s posterior. As well as controlling some muscles and body organs, in bony fish at least, the brain stem governs respiration and osmoregulation.

Vertebrates are the only chordate group to exhibit a proper brain. A slight swelling of the anterior end of the dorsal nerve cord is found in the lancelet, though it lacks the eyes and other complex sense organs comparable to those of vertebrates. Other chordates do not show any trends towards cephalisation. The central nervous system is based on a hollow nerve tube running along the length of the animal, from which the peripheral nervous system branches out to the various systems. The front end of the nerve tube is expanded by a thickening of the walls and expansion of the central canal of spinal cord into three primary brain vesicles; the prosencephalon (forebrain), mesencephalon (midbrain) and rhombencephalon (hindbrain) then further differentiated in the various vertebrate groups. Two laterally placed eyes form around outgrows from the midbrain, except in hagfish, though this may be a secondary loss. The forebrain is well developed and subdivided in most tetrapods, while the midbrain dominates in many fish and some salamanders. Vesicles of the forebrain are usually paired, giving rise to hemispheres like the cerebral hemispheres in mammals. The resulting anatomy of the central nervous system, with a single, hollow ventral nerve cord topped by a series of (often paired) vesicles is unique to vertebrates.

===Cerebellum===
The circuits in the cerebellum are similar across all classes of vertebrates, including fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. There is also an analogous brain structure in cephalopods with well-developed brains, such as octopuses. This has been taken as evidence that the cerebellum performs functions important to all animal species with a brain.

There is considerable variation in the size and shape of the cerebellum in different vertebrate species. In amphibians, lampreys, and hagfish, the cerebellum is little developed; in the latter two groups, it is barely distinguishable from the brain-stem. Although the spinocerebellum is present in these groups, the primary structures are small paired nuclei corresponding to the vestibulocerebellum.

The cerebellum of cartilaginous and bony fishes is extraordinarily large and complex. In at least one important respect, it differs in internal structure from the mammalian cerebellum: The fish cerebellum does not contain discrete deep cerebellar nuclei. Instead, the primary targets of Purkinje cells are a distinct type of cell distributed across the cerebellar cortex, a type not seen in mammals. In mormyrids (a family of weakly electrosensitive freshwater fish), the cerebellum is considerably larger than the rest of the brain put together. The largest part of it is a special structure called the &quot;valvula&quot;, which has an unusually regular architecture and receives much of its input from the electrosensory system.

Most species of fish and amphibians possess a lateral line system that senses pressure waves in water. One of the brain areas that receives primary input from the lateral line organ, the medial octavolateral nucleus, has a cerebellum-like structure, with granule cells and parallel fibers. In electrosensitive fish, the input from the electrosensory system goes to the dorsal octavolateral nucleus, which also has a cerebellum-like structure. In ray-finned fishes (by far the largest group), the optic tectum has a layer—the marginal layer—that is cerebellum-like.

===Identified neurons===
A neuron is &quot;identified&quot; if it has properties that distinguish it from every other neuron in the same animal—properties such as location, neurotransmitter, gene expression pattern, and connectivity—and if every individual organism belonging to the same species has one and only one neuron with the same set of properties. In vertebrate nervous systems, very few neurons are &quot;identified&quot; in this sense (in humans, there are believed to be none). In simpler nervous systems, some or all neurons may be thus unique.

In vertebrates, the best known identified neurons are the gigantic Mauthner cells of fish. Every fish has two Mauthner cells, located in the bottom part of the brainstem, one on the left side and one on the right. Each Mauthner cell has an axon that crosses over, innervating neurons at the same brain level and then travelling down through the spinal cord, making numerous connections as it goes. The synapses generated by a Mauthner cell are so powerful that a single action potential gives rise to a major behavioral response: within milliseconds the fish curves its body into a C-shape, then straightens, thereby propelling itself rapidly forward. Functionally, this is a fast escape response, triggered most easily by a strong sound wave or pressure wave impinging on the lateral line organ of the fish. Mauthner cells are not the only identified neurons in fish—there are about 20 more types, including pairs of &quot;Mauthner cell analogs&quot; in each spinal segmental nucleus. Although a Mauthner cell is capable of bringing about an escape response all by itself, in the context of ordinary behavior, other types of cells usually contribute to shaping the amplitude and direction of the response.

Mauthner cells have been described as command neurons. A command neuron is a special type of identified neuron, defined as a neuron that is capable of driving a specific behavior all by itself. Such neurons appear most commonly in the fast escape systems of various species—the squid giant axon and squid giant synapse, used for pioneering experiments in neurophysiology because of their enormous size, both participate in the fast escape circuit of the squid. The concept of a command neuron has, however, become controversial, because of studies showing that some neurons that initially appeared to fit the description were really only capable of evoking a response in a limited set of circumstances.

== Immune system ==
Immune organs vary by type of fish. In the jawless fish (lampreys and hagfish), true lymphoid organs are absent. These fish rely on regions of lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, erythrocytes, macrophages and plasma cells are produced in the anterior kidney (or pronephros) and some areas of the gut (where granulocytes mature). They resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish.

Cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) have a more advanced immune system. They have three specialized organs that are unique to chondrichthyes; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissues similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the Leydig&#x27;s organ within the walls of their esophagus, and a spiral valve in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable thymus and a well-developed spleen (their most important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.

Chondrostean fish (sturgeons, paddlefish and bichirs) possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the meninges, the membranes surrounding the central nervous system. Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, reticular cells and a small number of macrophages. The chondrostean kidney is an important hemopoietic organ; it is where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop.

Like chondrostean fish, the major immune tissues of bony fish (teleostei) include the kidney (especially the anterior kidney), which houses many different immune cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes are believed to reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus. In 2006, a lymphatic system similar to that in mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where unstimulated naive T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen.

<text>Gregory Dane Brown (born July 2, 1949) is an American folk singer-songwriter and guitarist from Iowa.

==Early life==
Brown was born into a musical family, and his father was a Pentecostal minister. He grew up in the Hacklebarney region of southwestern Iowa, which he describes as &quot;hill country.&quot; Brown spent several years traveling with a band before returning to Iowa, where he performed live and pursued his songwriting career.

==Career==

During the 1980s Brown toured and had recurring performances on &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;. Brown self-published two albums, &quot;44 &amp; 66&quot; and &quot;The Iowa Waltz&quot;. Bob Feldman and Susan Ode founded the record company called Red House Records after producing a sold-out concert at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1990. Brown became its first recording artist. Brown has recorded two dozen albums. In 1986 he released an album called &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot; based on poems by William Blake. His album &quot;One Big Town&quot; (1989) won an Indie Award from the National Association of Independent Record Distributors and marked the beginning of Brown&#x27;s long collaboration with Iowa guitarist Bo Ramsey.

&quot;The Poet Game&quot; (1994), his tenth studio album, saw significant international radio play (charting on AAA and topping &quot;The Gavin Report&quot;&#x27;s Americana chart), and received a NAIRD Indie award for singer-songwriter Album of the Year. &quot;The Live One&quot; (1995) proved to be a fan favorite capturing the humor, warmth, insights and spirit of his live shows. His 1996 release, &quot;Further In&quot;, topped them all: critics called it a masterpiece and it received a four-star review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Brown&#x27;s 1997 release &quot;Slant 6 Mind&quot; earned him his second Grammy nomination.

1999 brought the re-release of &quot;One Night&quot;, a live concert recording from October 1983 originally released on the Coffeehouse Extempore label. His album &quot;Solid Heart&quot; CD was recorded in 1999 during a benefit concert. Two releases followed in &quot;2000: Over and Under&quot; (Trailer Records) and the critically acclaimed &quot;Covenant&quot;, which won the Association for Independent Music’s award for Best Contemporary Folk Album of 2000. A 2002 tribute album, &quot;Going Driftless: An Artist’s Tribute to Greg Brown&quot; featured guest vocal performances by Ani DiFranco, Gillian Welch, Shawn Colvin, and his three daughters.

In 2006 he released &quot;The Evening Call&quot;, which &quot;Acoustic Guitar&quot; magazine described as &quot;among Brown&#x27;s finest work&quot; and which was featured on an episode of NPR&#x27;s On Point. A recording of another benefit concert was recorded and released in 2007 under the name &quot;Yellow Dog&quot; on the EarthWorks Music label. In 2007, Brown was nominated for a Folk Alliance Award. In 2010, Brown played Hades on &quot;Hadestown&quot;, a concept album by Anaïs Mitchell. His most recent studio album, &quot;Hymns to What Is Left&quot;, was released in 2012.

Brown retired from touring in 2019, although he performed two times in 2023, stating they were his final shows.

In 2024 he released &quot;Ring Around The Moon: A Songbook&quot;, a collection of essays, photographs, and sheet music.

==Personal life==
Greg Brown has been married three times. He has one daughter from his first marriage: Pieta Brown; and two from his second marriage: Constance Brown and Zoe Brown—all three are musicians. He has one son. Brown married singer-songwriter Iris DeMent in November 2002. In 2005, he and his wife adopted a daughter from Russia, Daria Chesnokva Victorona (Dasha Brown).

<text>Matricaria discoidea, commonly known as pineappleweed, wild chamomile, disc mayweed, and rayless mayweed, is an annual plant native to North America and introduced to Eurasia where it grows as a common herb of fields, gardens, and roadsides. It is in the daisy family Asteraceae. The flowers exude a chamomile/pineapple aroma when crushed. They are edible and have been used in salads (although they may become bitter by the time the plant blooms) and to make herbal tea.

==Description==

The flower head or pseudanthium is cone-shaped, composed of densely packed yellowish-green corollas, and lacking ray-florets. The leaves are pinnately dissected and sweet-scented when crushed. The plant grows high. Flowerheads are produced from March to September.

==Distribution and habitat==
The plant grows well in disturbed areas, especially those with poor, compacted soil. It can be seen blooming on footpaths, roadsides, and similar places in spring and early summer. It is native to North America, from central Alaska south to California and Texas and east to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. It is also native to Greenland. Though other sources, like the Flora of North America, assert that it is only native to the Pacific Northwest and while noting that NatureServe incorrectly list it as introduced to North America.

Alongside a variety of other plant species, wild chamomile seeds are known to be inadvertently transported to new areas through soil carried by cars; A study by Dunmail J. Hodkinson and Ken Thompson found that M. discoidea is one of the most common plants to be transported in this way.

It has been introduced widely in the northern hemisphere and is common and naturalized throughout Britain where it is one of the fastest-spreading plants in the 20th century.

== Uses ==
The greens can be washed and eaten, and both the flowers and the whole plant can be steeped to make tea, described as &quot;excellent&quot; by one field guide.

<doc id="331957" wikidata="Q7137779" url="?curid=331957" title="Park Hill, Sheffield">
<text>Park Hill is a housing estate in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It was built between 1957 and 1961, and in 1998 was given Grade II* listed building status. Following a period of decline, the estate is being renovated by developers Urban Splash into a mostly private mixed-tenure estate made up of homes for market rent, private sale, shared ownership, and student housing while around a quarter of the units in the development will be social housing. The renovation was shortlisted for both the 2013 and 2024 RIBA Stirling Prize, for the first and second phases of the redevelopment respectively. The Estate falls within the Manor Castle ward of the City. Park Hill is also the name of the area in which the flats are sited. The name relates to the deer park attached to Sheffield Manor Lodge, the remnant of which is now known as Norfolk Park.

==History==
Park Hill was previously the site of back-to-back housing, a mixture of 2–3-storey tenement buildings, open ground, quarries and steep gennels (alleyways) connecting the homes. The streets were arranged in a gridiron with terraces of back-to-back housing; a row facing the street, backed with a row facing inwards to a court-yard. There were shared privies unconnected to mains drainage. One standpipe supported up to 100 people. It was colloquially known as &quot;Little Chicago&quot; in the 1930s, due to the incidence of violent crime there. Clearance of the area began during the 1930s. The first clearance was made for the Duke/Bard/Bernard Street scheme in 1933. The courts were replaced with four storey blocks of maisonettes. In 1935 it was proposed to clear the central area which included streets to the south of Duke Street; South Street, Low Street, Hague Lane, Lord Street, Stafford Street, Long Henry Street, Colliers Row, Norwich Street, Gilbert Street and Anson Street. John Rennie, the city&#x27;s Medical Officer of Health, concluded:
:&quot;...the dwelling houses in that area [of Duke Street, Duke Street Lane, South Street and Low Street] are by reason of disrepair or sanitary defects unfit for human habitation, or are by reason of their bad arrangement, or the narrowness or bad arrangement of the streets, dangerous or injurious to the health of the inhabitants of the area, and that the other buildings in the area are for a like reason dangerous or injurious to the health of the said inhabitants, and that the most satisfactory method of dealing with the conditions in the area is the demolition of all the buildings in the area.&quot;

G. C. Craven, the city&#x27;s planning officer, recommended wholesale demolition and possible replacement with multi-storey flats. The Second World War halted this.

Following the war it was decided that a radical scheme needed to be introduced to deal with rehousing the Park Hill community. To that end, architects Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith under the supervision of J. L. Womersley, Sheffield Council&#x27;s City Architect, began work in 1953 designing the Park Hill Flats. Inspired by Le Corbusier&#x27;s Unité d&#x27;Habitation and the Smithsons&#x27; unbuilt schemes, most notably for Golden Lane in London, the deck access design was viewed as &#x27;revolutionary&#x27;; in reality the fantastical schemes were often less practical for the families actually living in them. The style is known as brutalism.

===Construction===

Construction began in 1957. Park Hill (Part One) was officially opened by Hugh Gaitskell, MP and Leader of the Opposition, on 16 June 1961. The City Council published a brochure on the scheme which was in several languages, including Russian.
To maintain a strong sense of community, neighbours were re-homed next door to each other and old street names from the area were re-used (e.g. Gilbert Row, Long Henry Row). Cobbles from the terraced streets surrounded the flats and paved the pathways down the hill to Sheffield station and tramlines.

The second phase consisted of four high rise blocks, containing 1,160 dwellings, on the hill behind, joined to the main scheme by two three-storey terraces to the east of Bernard Street that contained 153 dwellings. This was renamed in May 1961, becoming the Hyde Park flats. The terraces became Hyde Park Walk and Hyde Park Terrace. The Hyde Park tower blocks were between five and 19 storeys high. This was opened on 23 June 1966 by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.

Further housing schemes were completed to similar designs, including the Broomhall and Kelvin developments in Sheffield. At first these &#x27;Streets in the sky&#x27; enjoyed some popularity and success; for the first time in their lives, the working-poor tenants had the luxury of private bathrooms and efficient heating, but problems soon began to surface; Parents felt unable to keep an eye on their children in the playgrounds so many floors below, some older people felt isolated – if the access lifts were out of order it meant many stairs to climb, and even when they were working, lifts could be unpleasant due to being used as &#x27;toilets&#x27; especially at weekends, requiring a caretaker to swill them with strong smelling disinfectant. Secluded walkways and stairwells provided opportunity for crime and anti-social behaviour while high balconies invited some to throw refuse and other more dangerous items over them; in the late 1970s a child was killed by a TV set thrown from Hyde Park flats. The high platforms also attracted suicidal jumpers. Government restrictions on how potential tenants were allocated to flats, the decay of the building&#x27;s fabric when not maintained, poor noise insulation and issues with resident security caused their popularity to wane. For many years, the council found it difficult to find tenants for the flats.

===Listing and renovation===
Despite the problems, the complex remained structurally sound, unlike many system-built blocks of the era, and controversially was Grade II* listed in 1998 making it the largest listed building in Europe. Sheffield City Council hoped this would attract investment to renovate the building, but this was not initially forthcoming. The decision to list the estate was controversial at the time and it continues to attract criticism.
A part-privatisation scheme by the developer Urban Splash in partnership with English Heritage to turn the flats into upmarket apartments, business units and social housing is now underway.

Sheffield City Council have created a new public park, South Street Open Space, between the railway station and Park Hill. This includes a series of seating terraces and new planting areas.

==== Phase 1 ====
Flanks A, B and C (the tallest sections of the buildings) were initially cleared, leaving only their concrete shell. The renovation was one of the six shortlisted projects for the 2013 RIBA Stirling Prize. The renovation was due to start in around 2007 but was put on hold due to the recession. Work started in 2009 with the first phase open to residents in 2010/11.

==== Phase 2 ====
In comparison to the boldness of the Phase 1 renovation, Phase 2 instead implemented a &#x27;light touch&#x27; approach which retains the original brick infill and full width of the streets. 195 new flats and townhouses will be developed in flanks D, E, F, G and H around a central residents garden as well as of commercial space. This phase also included the restoration of the link bridge to Phase 1.

Planning approval was granted in December 2017 and work began on site in January  2019. Homes went on sale in February 2020 and residents moved in from January 2022.

A pub opened in September 2023, the first pub at Park Hill since the original development. Its name, The Pearl, is an amalgamation of the names of 2 of those earlier establishments – The Parkway Tavern and The Earl George.

Phase 2 of the Park Hill redevelopment was shortlisted for the 2024 RIBA Stirling Prize.

==== Phase 3 ====
Phase 3 has been developed as student accommodation, consisting of 356 rooms in 74 townhouse style units as well as communal spaces and a convenience shop. Flanks M, N, O, P and Q were developed as part of this phase which has been named Béton House.

Planning approval was granted in July 2018 and work began on site in May 2019. Work completed in autumn 2020 with the first students moving in during September 2020.

The convenience store, Park Hill Provisions, opened in October 2021.

==== Phase 4 ====
Planning approval was granted in August 2019 for the redevelopment of flanks R, S and T into 95 residential units, artist accommodation, heritage flats, artist studios, and contemporary art gallery. An updated planning application was submitted in June 2023 in which the art gallery (and associated studios and accommodation) were removed due to a lack of funding. It also included controversial plans to replace some of the existing green space with car parks. A further amended planning application was approved in November 2023.

==== Phase 5 ====
A planning application for the fifth and final phase of the redevelopment was submitted in June 2024. Plans for flanks I, J, K and L included 105 residential units, a flexible commercial space and a residents allotment. Planning approval was granted in September 2024.

==Description==

===Background===
The Park Hill area of Sheffield contained and had a population density in the range of . It was identified as a slum where, according to Patrick Abercrombie&#x27;s Sheffield Civic Survey and Development Plan (1924), there were death rates in the lower Park district of 20–26 per 1,000 inhabitants, and infant (under one year) mortality rate of 153–179 per 1,000 births. The central area amounted to , and contained 140 designated clearance areas.

===Design===

The 995 Park Hill flats and maisonettes, three pubs and 31 shops were built in four ranges linked by bridges across the upper decks. The ranges were canted at obtuse angles to maximise the panoramic views across the city and the southern Pennines. The stair columns and lifts were placed at each turn. There were two service lifts capable of elevating maintenance vehicles.

The site is steeply sloping (gradient 1 in 10), enabling the designers to maintain a constant roof level though the buildings ranged from four to 13 storeys. There were access roadways on every third storey; these serviced a one-storey flat beneath and a two-storey maisonette on that level and on the level above. The horizontal design repeated itself every three bays, centred on a H-frame that carried the services and stair columns. Each of these units contained a one-bedroom flat, a two-bedroom flat, a two-bedroom maisonette and a three-bedroom maisonette, and stair columns. The kitchens and bathrooms were vertically aligned, allowing simple ducting for services and the Garchey waste disposal system.

Construction is of an exposed concrete frame with a progression of purple, terracotta, light red and cream brick curtain walling. However, as a result of weathering and soot-staining from passing trains, few people realise this and assume the building to be constructed entirely from concrete.

The concept of the flats was described as streets in the sky. There were four street decks, wide enough for milk floats, with large numbers of front doors opening onto them. This was a key concept of the design. Each deck of the structure, except the top one, has direct access to ground level at some point on the sloping site.

The shopping facilities, known as The Pavement, were provided on the lowest part of the site. There were four pubs: The Earl George on The Pavement, The Link and the Scottish Queen on Gilbert Row, and the Parkway on Hague Row.

==Location==
Park Hill is one of the seven hills on which Sheffield is built. It is south of the River Don, and to the east of the River Sheaf. The estate is on steeply rising land the lower slopes, it is upwind of the former heavily polluting industrial areas of the Don Valley. The estate is bounded by Park Square roundabout on the A61, the B6070 Duke Street, B6071 Talbot Street and South Street.

Immediately to the west is Sheffield railway station that in 2010–11, was the 35th-busiest in the UK, and the 11th-busiest outside London.

==Arts==
A piece of graffiti, &quot;Clare Middleton I love you will u marry me&quot;, written on one of the &quot;bridges&quot; linking two of the blocks, was the subject of a documentary broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2011. Jason Lowe spray-painted the graffiti proposal in 2001; Middleton did not marry him, and died of cancer in 2007. The graffiti was mentioned by Yungblud in his song &quot;I Love You, Will You Marry Me&quot;, and Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys wore a T-shirt with a reproduction of the &quot;I love you will u marry me&quot; at a gig. As part of the renovation, Urban Splash overlaid that part of the graffiti in neon in 2008, but in early 2021 removed it while renovating the bridge.

Even now, inhabitants of Sheffield are split on the matter of Park Hill; many believe it to be a part of Sheffield&#x27;s heritage, while others consider it an eyesore and blot on the landscape. Public nominations led it to the top 12 of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Demolition&quot; programme. Other television appearances for the flats include &quot;Police 2020&quot; and in an Arctic Monkeys video. A BBC programme called &quot;Saving Britain&#x27;s Past&quot; sheds light on the building site&#x27;s past and discusses the listing from several viewpoints in its second episode, called &quot;Streets in the Sky&quot;. The 2014 film &quot;&#x27;71&quot; used the buildings to recreate Belfast&#x27;s notorious Divis Flats during The Troubles.

Park Hill has featured as a major source of inspiration for British artist Mandy Payne, with her paintings of the estate winning several awards.

Park Hill is referenced in the lyrics of Pulp&#x27;s song &quot;Sheffield Sex City&quot;.

Park Hill appears on the cover of Eagulls&#x27; self-titled debut album.

The building was used as the location for Harvey and Gadget&#x27;s flat in &quot;This Is England &#x27;90&quot; and also features in &quot;This Is England &#x27;86&quot; during the fight scene.

The area and above-mentioned graffiti are the subject of the song &quot;I Love You, Will You Marry Me&quot; by South Yorkshire-born musician Yungblud.

Park Hill is featured in the eleventh series and twelfth series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, as the family home of companion Yaz Khan.

The musical &quot;Standing at the Sky&#x27;s Edge&quot;, featuring songs by Richard Hawley, is set in Park Hill and tells the story of three families over sixty years beginning in 1961. The musical premiered at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield in 2019 and transferred to the National Theatre in London in 2023. That same year, it won Best New Musical at the Laurence Olivier Awards. After the run at the National Theatre, it was announced that the musical would open in the West End in February 2024 at the Gillian Lynne Theatre.

Park Hill is featured in the 2017 science fiction romantic comedy film &quot;How to Talk to Girls at Parties&quot;, based on the short story of the same name by Neil Gaiman. Park Hill serves as the setting for a part of the main character&#x27;s love story, as well as the climax of the film.

In July 2022, Park Hill was used as a filming location for The Full Monty (TV series).

Scenes for Bodies (2023 TV series) were filmed at Park Hill during September 2022.
