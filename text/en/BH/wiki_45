<text>Stephen Peter Marriott (30 January 1947 – 20 April 1991) was an English actor, musician, guitarist, singer and songwriter. He was a student at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London and appeared in the West End, before taking a role in music. He co-founded and played in the rock bands Small Faces and Humble Pie, in a career spanning over 20 years. Marriott was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Small Faces.

In Britain, Marriott became a popular, often-photographed mod style icon. Marriott was influenced by musicians such as: Miles Davis, Buddy Holly, Booker T &amp; the MG&#x27;s, Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Muddy Waters and Bobby Bland.
In his later life, Marriott distanced himself from the mainstream music industry and turned away from major record labels, remaining in relative obscurity. He returned to his musical roots, playing in local pubs and clubs around London and Essex.

Marriott died on 20 April 1991 when a fire, which was thought to have been caused by a cigarette, swept through his 16th-century home in Arkesden, Essex. He was 44 and posthumously received an Ivor Novello Award in 1996 for his &quot;Outstanding Contribution to British Music&quot;, and was listed in &quot;Mojo&quot; as one of the top 100 greatest singers of all time.

== Early life ==
Steve Marriott was born on 30 January 1947 at East Ham Memorial Hospital, Plashet, East Ham, (London, E7), England to parents Kay and Bill Marriott who lived at Strone Road, Manor Park. Born three weeks premature and weighing just , he developed jaundice and was kept in hospital four weeks before being well enough to go home. Marriott came from a working-class background and attended Monega Junior School. His father Bill worked as a printer and later owned a jellied eels stall, called &#x27;Bill&#x27;s Eels&#x27;, outside the Ruskin Arms hotel. For a short time he also sold pie and mash.

Kay worked at the Tate &amp; Lyle factory in Silvertown. Bill was an accomplished pub pianist. Bill bought Marriott a ukulele and harmonica which Marriott taught himself to play. Marriott showed an early interest in singing and performing, busking at local bus-stops for extra pocket money and winning talent contests during the family&#x27;s annual holiday to Jaywick Holiday camp near Clacton-on-Sea.

In 1959, at the age of twelve, Marriott formed his first band with school friends Nigel Chapin and Robin Andrews. They were called &#x27;The Wheels&#x27;, later the &#x27;Coronation Kids&#x27;, and finally &#x27;Mississippi Five&#x27;. They later added Simon Simkins and Vic Dixon to their line-up. From a young age, Marriott was a huge fan of American singer Buddy Holly and would mimic his hero by wearing large-rimmed spectacles with the lenses removed. He wrote his first song, called &quot;Shelia My Dear&quot;, after his aunt Shelia to whom he was close. Those who heard the song said it was played at a jaunty pace in the style of Buddy Holly and his bandmates also nicknamed him &#x27;Buddy&#x27;.

They would play at the local coffee bars in East Ham and perform Saturday morning gigs at the Essoldo Cinema in Manor Park. Marriott was a cheeky, hyperactive child, according to his mother Kay, and well known by his neighbours in Strone Road for playing pranks and practical jokes. While he was a pupil at local Sandringham Secondary Modern School, Marriott was said to be responsible for deliberately starting a fire in a classroom, though he always denied this.

=== Acting career: 1960–1965 ===
In 1960, Bill Marriott spotted an advertisement in a London newspaper for a new Artful Dodger replacement to appear in Lionel Bart&#x27;s popular musical &quot;Oliver!&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; by Charles Dickens, at the &quot;New Theatre&quot; (now called the Noël Coward Theatre) in London&#x27;s West End, and without telling his son, applied for him to audition. At the age of thirteen, Marriott auditioned for the role. He sang two songs, &quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now&quot; by Connie Francis, and &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot; by Buddy Holly. Bart was impressed with Marriott&#x27;s vocal abilities and hired him. Marriott stayed with the show for twelve months, playing various boys&#x27; roles during that time, for which he was paid £8 a week. Marriott was also chosen to provide lead vocals for the Artful Dodger songs &quot;Consider Yourself&quot;, &quot;Be Back Soon&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;, which appear on the official album to the stage show, released by World Record Club and recorded at the famous Abbey Road Studios. In 1961 the Marriott family moved from Strone Road to a new council flat in Daines Close, Manor Park.

Following Marriott&#x27;s successful acting debut in &quot;Oliver!&quot;, his family encouraged him to pursue an acting career. In 1961 he auditioned and was accepted as a student at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London. Because his family were unable to afford the private school fees, it was mutually agreed the fees would be deducted from acting work the school found him. After Marriott&#x27;s enrolment at the Italia Conti Academy, he quickly gained acting roles, working consistently in film, television and radio, often typecast as the energetic Cockney child. In 1963, he appeared in &quot;Heavens Above!&quot; (1963), acting alongside Peter Sellers. Marriott utilised his passion for music and starred in &quot;Live it Up!&quot; (1963) as a drummer named Ricky and its follow-up &quot;Be My Guest&quot; (1965). Soon he lost interest in acting and turned his attention back to his first love, which was music. His parents were devastated and his decision to give up acting caused a family rift. As a result, he left the family home for a short period to stay with friends.

=== Early music career: 1963–1964 ===
In 1963, Marriott wrote &quot;Imaginary Love&quot; and touted it around the big record labels in London. On the strength of &quot;Imaginary Love&quot;, Marriott secured a Decca Records deal as a solo artist with Dick Reagan (also an agent for Cliff Richard). Marriott&#x27;s first single was a song written by Kenny Lynch, &quot;Give Her My Regards&quot;, with Marriott&#x27;s self-penned song as the B-side. The single was released in July 1963 and was commercially unsuccessful. In the same year Marriott formed The Frantiks, who recorded a cover version of Cliff Richard&#x27;s song &quot;Move It&quot; with ex-Shadows drummer Tony Meehan, who was brought in to help with production.

Despite the single being hawked around the major record companies, no one was interested and the song was never released. The band then changed their name to The Moments, or Marriott and his Moments. They played support for artists such as The Nashville Teens, The Animals, Georgie Fame and John Mayall, playing venues such as the 100 Club in Soho, London, and the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond. The Moments gained a loyal following, and for a short time had their own fanzine, &quot;Beat &#x27;64&quot;, started by Stuart Tuck and dedicated to &#x27;Steve Marriott&#x27;s Moments&#x27;.

They are noted as performing a total of 80 gigs in 1964. The group was asked to record a single for the American market, a cover version of The Kinks&#x27; UK hit song &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, released on the World Artists record label (1964). When their version of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; failed to get attention, Marriott was dropped from the band, with members claiming he was too young to be a lead singer. According to Don Craine, frontman of London R&amp;B band The Downliners Sect, Marriott applied to join the band as a replacement harmonica player. Craine did not invite him to audition because he knew Marriott wanted to be lead vocalist.
Between leaving the Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements:&quot;He actually approached us (The Checkpoints) and said he needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was with us for a couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren&#x27;t very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn&#x27;t put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He seemed to me to be a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist&#x27;s red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them.&quot;

== Career ==

=== Small Faces: 1965–1969 ===
On 28 July 1964, Marriott first saw his future Small Faces partners, Ronnie Lane and 16-year-old drummer Kenney Jones. They were all performing at the Albion in Rainham, with their bands. Lane and Marriott met again by chance in the J60 Music Bar, a music shop in High Street North, Manor Park, where Marriott was working after his recent departure from the Moments. Lane came in looking to purchase a bass guitar, and afterwards was invited to Marriott&#x27;s home to listen to his extensive collection of rare American R&amp;B import records. With their shared love of R&amp;B the trio were soon firm friends.Marriott was invited by Lane and Jones to perform with &quot;the Outcasts&quot; (previously called &quot;the Pioneers&quot;) at the band&#x27;s regular gig the Earl of Derby in Bermondsey. The trio each ended up completely drunk and Marriott enthusiastically destroyed the piano he was playing, much to the amusement of Lane and Jones. The landlord sacked them and the band was finished.

According to David Bowie on a 1999 episode of &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot;, in 1964 he and his good friend Marriott planned to form an R&amp;B duo called &#x27;David and Goliath&#x27;. Instead, Marriott, Lane and Jones decided to form their own band, with Marriott bringing along his acquaintance, Jimmy Winston (Winston was later replaced by Ian McLagan). Marriott&#x27;s friend Annabel, an ex-student from the Italia Conti, came up with the band&#x27;s distinctive name after commenting that they all had &quot;small faces&quot;; the name stuck in part because they were all (apart from Winston) small (none being over 5 ft 6 tall), and the term &quot;face&quot; in English mod culture was the name given to a well-known and respected mod. Small Faces were signed to Don Arden within six weeks of forming and quickly became a successful mod influenced band highly regarded by the youth cult&#x27;s followers when their debut single &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do About It&quot; hit the UK singles chart.

Robert Plant was a fan of Small Faces and a regular at their early gigs where he also ran small errands for them. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s song &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; is a direct take of Marriott&#x27;s version of the classic song &quot;You Need Lovin&#x27;&quot;, originally written by Willie Dixon and recorded by American blues singer Muddy Waters. Small Faces would regularly perform &quot;You Need Lovin&#x27;&quot; in their live set and the song also appears on their debut album &quot;Small Faces&quot;, released by Decca in May 1966.

&quot;It was fantastic, I loved it, Muddy Waters recorded it but I couldn&#x27;t sing like Muddy Waters so it wasn&#x27;t that much of a nick. I was a high range and Muddy was a low range so I had to figure out how to sing it. So I did and that was our opening number for all the years we were together. Every time we were on stage that was our opening number, unless we had a short set. That&#x27;s where Jimmy Page and Robert Plant heard it. Robert Plant used to follow us around. He was like a fan.&quot; – Steve Marriott

However Marriott bore no animosity toward Plant. He is quoted as shouting &quot;Go on my son!&quot; and wishing him luck when he first heard Plant&#x27;s version on the radio. Arden paid the band a wage of £20 a week each, along with accounts in clothes shops in Carnaby Street. On Boxing Day 1965, Arden arranged for them to move into a rented house, 22 Westmoreland Terrace, Pimlico. In his autobiography, McLagan describes the house as &quot;party central&quot;, a place where the likes of Marianne Faithfull, Brian Epstein, Pete Townshend and other celebrities would hang out. Marriott was just 18 years old.

In 1967, after a dispute over unpaid royalties, relations between the Small Faces and Don Arden broke down and Arden sold them on to Andrew Loog Oldham, who owned the Immediate Records label. The band were much happier at Immediate, spending more time in the recording studio and far less time playing live, but they lost the dynamic live sound that had made them famous.

Marriott wrote or co-wrote most of Small Faces&#x27; hit singles. In an interview in 1984, Marriott was asked what his best Small Faces songs were: &quot;I think &#x27;All or Nothing&#x27;, that I wrote, takes a lot of beating. To me, if there&#x27;s a song that typifies that era, then that might be it. Words regardless, cos it&#x27;s only a silly love song, but the actual feel and arrangement of the thing, and maybe &#x27;Tin Soldier&#x27;&quot;. In 1967, Marriott wrote the evocative rock-ballad &quot;Tin Soldier&quot; to woo model Jenny Rylance. They first met in 1966 and Marriott was immediately smitten, but Rylance was dating up-and-coming singer Rod Stewart and so the two became friends. She later broke up with Stewart and had a brief romantic liaison with Marriott, but much to his disappointment ended it to go back to Stewart. Rylance and Stewart later split for good after a rocky four-year relationship; when Marriott found out he pursued her relentlessly, leading him to write &quot;Tin Soldier&quot;. The song was a hit for the band in 1967 and for Marriott a personal triumph. He and Rylance were married at Kensington Register Office, London, on 29 May 1968.

In 1968, Marriott moved into Beehive Cottage with his wife Rylance in Moreton, Essex, a property he had bought jointly with Ronnie Lane and wife Susan and where he established his &quot;Clear Sounds&quot; music studio. 

After the success of the group&#x27;s number one hit concept album &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot; Marriott was keen for the group to evolve and wanted to bring in ex-Herd frontman Peter Frampton, but McLagan, Jones and Lane refused. Marriott started to feel the band had reached the end creatively and began to spend more time with Frampton and Greg Ridley. After rumours in the press about the band splitting up, which were always officially denied, Marriott quit the group, storming off stage during a disastrous live performance on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1968. In a 1984 interview with NME reporter Paolo Hewitt on the subject of leaving the band, Marriott said &quot;You grow apart for Christsakes. You&#x27;re talking about people living together from the ages of seventeen to twenty-two and that&#x27;s a growing up part of your life and we got to hate each other, no doubt about it. We didn&#x27;t speak to each other for fucking years. Maybe ten years.

Frampton has said that after Marriott&#x27;s departure from the Small Faces, the remaining members, Lane, McLagan and Jones, turned up at his home and offered him Marriott&#x27;s role in the band: &quot;The following day after the Alexandra Palace gig (where Steve walked off), I was back home and I got a call from Ronnie Lane who said, &quot;Me, Kenney and Mac would like to come round and see you.&quot; I thought, &#x27;Hello, what&#x27;s all this about?&#x27; Anyway, they all came round to my horrible little flat in Earls Court and asked me to join the Small Faces. All I could say was it&#x27;s a bit late now. Why couldn&#x27;t you have asked me while we were in Paris? We&#x27;d all be in the same band together and Steve wouldn&#x27;t have left.&quot; Ian McLagan vehemently denied this story.

=== Humble Pie: 1969–1975 ===
Shortly after leaving Small Faces in 1969, Marriott joined the newly formed rock band Humble Pie with Peter Frampton, drummer Jerry Shirley and bassist Greg Ridley. In the early years, Humble Pie allowed Marriott the artistic freedom he craved but was denied in Small Faces due, in part, to commercial pressures and individual differences. After extensive secret rehearsals at his Clear Sounds home recording studio, the band released on Immediate their debut album &quot;As Safe As Yesterday Is&quot;, closely followed by the Marriott-penned debut single &quot;Natural Born Bugie&quot; (an intentional misspelling of &quot;boogie&quot;), which peaked at No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart in the summer of 1969. Humble Pie almost disbanded after their first American tour when they returned to Britain and discovered that Immediate had gone into liquidation. They transferred to A&amp;M Records and focused all their attention on the lucrative US market. Their new manager, Dee Anthony, had the band scrap its &#x27;unplugged&#x27; set and crank the volume up.

Humble Pie toured constantly over the next three years, completing nineteen tours in the US alone. The band&#x27;s next album releases, &quot;Humble Pie&quot; and &quot;Rock On&quot;, benefitted from their touring. Their live album &quot;Performance Rockin&#x27; the Fillmore&quot; (1971) became the band&#x27;s most successful release to date. During these recordings, Marriott&#x27;s strong vocal performances became the focal point of the band. Dee Anthony pushed Marriott to take more of the on-stage spotlight, something he had, up to then, been sharing with Frampton and Ridley. Marriott&#x27;s new prominence is said to have resulted in Frampton&#x27;s decision to leave the band. (Frampton was replaced by Clem Clempson.)

Some close to Marriott, such as his wife and even Marriott himself, would say that his personality changed for the worse when he toured America. Eventually, possibly as a result of excessive alcohol and drug use, Marriott started showing signs of mild schizophrenia. He had regularly taken amphetamines (speed) and smoked cannabis in his days in the Moments and Small Faces, and in the latter half of the 1960s he also tried LSD. But by the time Humble Pie began to tour America regularly in the early 1970s, Marriott allegedly developed a destructive cocaine and alcohol addiction, which is thought to have been the cause of his marriage break-ups and to have contributed to his premature death in a house fire.

&quot;He (Steve) became another person to cope with the pressures, he would say things like, &quot;Please tell me that you&#x27;ll leave me if I go on tour again because if you say that I&#x27;ll have justification not to go, if I go and have to be that other person again I&#x27;ll just go mad.&quot; This would be said in a moment of truth but the next day had changed his mind and he&#x27;d be up and off... He was married to his music and I didn&#x27;t mind that especially in the early years when he would play me new songs on an acoustic guitar but what didn&#x27;t make me happy was when he was in the home studio, out of his brain, trying to come up with the next album because he was being pressurised into it. He would just disappear into the studio for three or four days at a time. He never slept and there would be all sorts of strange people in there with him. It was a crazy business and even the nicest people get mixed up. All sorts of chemicals were presented to him and he became addicted to them in the end. It was drugs that destroyed our relationship. Before the home studio was built Beehive Cottage was our sanctuary, afterwards it just became his workplace.&quot; – Jenny Rylance 

Rylance finally left Marriott in 1973. She said: &quot;The drugs and the drink I would tolerate no more. It broke my heart to leave Steve but it had to be done, I was ultimately the stronger&quot;. Due to the break-up of his marriage and growing drug use, some band members said that Marriott at times became domineering, aggressive and intolerable to work with. Humble Pie disbanded in 1975, citing musical differences as the reason for the split. Financial mismanagement and widespread substance abuse within the band also played a part. In an interview in 2000 with John Hellier, Jerry Shirley said:

&quot;We were all doing too many drugs, we&#x27;d lost sight of our business arrangements and no-one within the band had any control over money matters. But the main reason was that we were making bad records, it all came to a head in early 1975. The rot had set in so deep it was inevitable.&quot; – Jerry Shirley (Humble Pie).
Marriott always believed Dee Anthony had syphoned off band earnings to promote his new project, Frampton and his album &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot; After Marriott&#x27;s death, second wife Pam Stephens claimed in an interview that while they were making the &quot;Marriott&quot; solo album they were warned off accusing Anthony of any financial misdealings and received threatening phone calls. Anthony was alleged to have links with the Genovese crime family (among others). She also claimed that after Marriott confronted Anthony about the missing money, she and Marriott were summoned to a meeting at the Ravenite Social Club on Mulberry Street in New York&#x27;s Little Italy district. Among those present were John Gotti, Frank Locascio and Paul Castellano, all members of the Gambino crime family. Marriott was informed that he would not be getting any money and was warned to drop the matter. Marriott took the threats seriously.

Jerry Shirley, however, denies some of the rumours that Anthony was Mafia-related and has dismissed them as &quot;bollocks&quot; and &quot;romanticised exaggeration&quot;. He has acknowledged Anthony&#x27;s connections and a lot of the stories being folklore.

=== Solo career ===

Marriott released his first solo album, &quot;Marriott&quot;, in 1976 and moved back to Britain. Stephens gave birth to their first child Toby on 20 February 1976, and they were married on 23 March 1977, at Chelsea Register Office in London. The money from Humble Pie&#x27;s farewell tour soon ran out, and Marriott was reduced to stealing vegetables from a field next to his home. He went on to form the Steve Marriott Allstars with ex-Pie bassist Greg Ridley, drummer Ian Wallace and ex-Heavy Metal Kids&#x27; guitarist Mickey Finn, and found a new manager, Laurie O&#x27;Leary. In the 1980s O&#x27;Leary asked Marriott to meet a friend of his, the infamous Ronnie Kray, who was incarcerated in Broadmoor Hospital for the murder of George Cornell. Marriott gave him a signed photo.

After the departure of Mick Taylor in 1975 from the Rolling Stones, Marriott was considered as his replacement; however, Mick Jagger allegedly blocked the move after Marriott upstaged him during the audition. According to Ronnie Wood in his autobiography &quot;Ronnie&quot;, Marriott was Richards&#x27; first choice to replace Taylor.

 &quot;Steve told me, &#x27;I was good and stood at the back for a while but then Keith [Richards] would hit this lick and I just couldn&#x27;t keep my mouth shut.&#x27; Keith wanted him in but there was no way that once Steve opened his mouth Mick would have him in the band. He knew Steve would never stay in the background. They were the one band in the world that Steve would have loved to have been in. He just wanted to work with Keith.&quot; – Pam Marriott 

=== Small Faces reformed: 1976–1978 ===
In 1976 a court ruled that Arden still owed the Small Faces £12,000 in unpaid royalties. He agreed to pay in monthly instalments, but disappeared after making just one payment.

Due to the success of re-released singles &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot; and &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot; in 1975 and 1976, McLagan, Jones and Marriott were persuaded to re-form Small Faces. Rick Wills took the place of Lane, who pulled out after just two rehearsals. Unknown to the others, Lane was suffering from multiple sclerosis. The band recorded two albums, &quot;Playmates&quot; (1977) and &quot;78 in the Shade&quot; (1978), but the albums were both critical and commercial failures and they disbanded. Marriott did not make any money out of the venture. His earnings were used to extricate him from old management contracts. Due to financial problems, Marriott was forced to sell Beehive Cottage, which had been his home since 1968, and move to a small terraced house in Golders Green, London.Late in 1978, the Inland Revenue informed Marriott that he still owed £100,000 in back tax from his Humble Pie days; he thought manager Dee Anthony had made all the necessary payments. O&#x27;Leary, Marriott&#x27;s manager, advised him to leave Britain or go to prison. He sold the house in Golders Green and moved to California. Marriott, Pam and son Toby were staying with friends in Santa Cruz and Marriott formed a new band called The Firm, with Jim Leverton and (most notably) former Mountain guitarist Leslie West. But after Leverton had to leave the US due to visa problems, and disputes over potential royalties, the band broke up. Marriott was by now completely broke and forced to collect empty glass bottles to redeem them for small change.

=== Humble Pie reformed: 1980–1981 ===
According to Leslie West, Marriott needed the money and accepted a lucrative offer to reform Humble Pie. In 1980, Marriott contacted Jerry Shirley, who was living in New York City, to discuss a Humble Pie reunion. Shirley agreed and they recorded &quot;Fool for a Pretty Face&quot;, which Marriott had written. The new line-up included Anthony &quot;Sooty&quot; Jones, who was a well-respected bassist among American East Coast musicians, as well as vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench, former member of the Jeff Beck Group. The song proved good enough for them to secure a recording contract with Atco. In the UK their material was released by Jet Records, owned by ex-Small Faces manager Don Arden.

They recorded the heavy rock album &quot;On to Victory&quot; (1980), followed by &quot;Go for the Throat&quot; (1981), and both proved reasonably successful. They also toured America as part of the &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Marathon&quot; bill. In the latter half of 1981, Marriott was beset with personal problems. His marriage was almost over and after he broke his wrist in an accident and was hospitalised with a suspected burst ulcer, whilst opening for Judas Priest the new Humble Pie line-up disintegrated.

=== Majik Mijits: 1981, 2000 ===
During a visit to Britain in 1981, Marriott became eager to see Ronnie Lane. By this time Lane had begun to use a wheelchair. After an emotional meeting, Marriott suggested they gig together. They got together with Jim Leverton, Mick Weaver, Dave Hynes, Zoot Money and Mel Collins to record an album called &quot;Majik Mijits&quot;. The album features songs by Lane and Marriott, though none were co-written. Due to Lane&#x27;s illness, they were unable to tour and promote the album.

&quot;Steve and Ronnie went to America to see Clive Davis of Arista Records. They played him the tape. Clive Davis was tapping his foot and tapping his very expensive pen on his very expensive desk. He said &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s great man&quot;. Steve said &quot;So you like the tape, Clive&quot;. Steve then stopped the tape, ejected it and said &quot;WELL YOU CAN&#x27;T FUCKING HAVE IT!&quot; The story that Steve told me was that it would have meant touring and Ronnie just wasn&#x27;t up to it. It would have meant pretty much carrying him everywhere, no tour, no album. That&#x27;s why the Mijits never came out at that point in time. It&#x27;s been gathering dust for ages&quot; – Jim Leverton. 

The album was released nineteen years later, in 2000. After the &quot;Majik Mijits&quot;, Marriott went back to New York playing on the club circuit again.

=== Later years ===
For the next year and a half, Marriott was on the road with Jim Leverton, Goldy McJohn, formerly of Steppenwolf, and Fallon Williams. They played mostly Small Faces and Humble Pie material, touring non-stop for the next eighteen months. After the departure of McJohn, the trio changed the band&#x27;s name to the Three Trojans. Despite attempts at reconciliation, Marriott&#x27;s marriage finally came to an end when his wife found out that Marriott was expecting a child with Terry Elias, a Canadian girl he had met while they were separated.

Leverton was unable to return to the US in 1983 so he was replaced by Keith Christopher (currently with Lynyrd Skynyrd). Steve went through several guitar players that year including Tommy Johnson, and Phil &quot;Duck&quot; Dix. The band toured the US extensively as Humble Pie in 1983 playing clubs, festivals, and theaters. The final US show as Humble Pie took place in Marietta, GA on New Year&#x27;s Eve. In early 1984, Rick Richards (Georgia Satellites) replaced Phil Dix on guitar as the band was about to record demos with Eddie Offord (Yes, ELP) at his studio in Atlanta. The new lineup only lasted 24 hours and Marriott decided to return to the UK. 

=== Packet of Three: 1984–1986 ===
Accepting that his marriage was over, Marriott moved back to the UK. With no home and no money, he stayed in the spare bedroom of his sister Kay&#x27;s house. Marriott formed Packet of Three, again playing the pub circuit. He insisted on being paid for each gig in cash as the Inland Revenue were still pursuing him for back taxes. In 1984, Aura Records released &quot;Packet of Three&quot; (1984), it was later reissued as &quot;Steve Marriott Live at Dingwalls 6.7.84&quot;. Marriott contacted longtime friend Manon Piercey, and they quickly developed a close relationship and rented a house together. Piercey gave birth to daughter Mollie Mae on 3 May 1985. With Piercey&#x27;s help, Marriott reduced his excessive drink and drug habits. His sister Kay said: &quot;Steve would say, I&#x27;m not drinking any more, and he&#x27;d stop, six weeks, two months, he was very strong willed; if he wanted to, he could&quot;. In 1985 Marriott was still touring with Packet of Three playing Canada, the US and Europe.

During Live Aid in 1985, London-based Phoenix Modernist Society joined mod revival bands such as the Lambrettas and Purple Hearts, with 1960s stars such as Chris Farlowe and PP Arnold and &#x27;80s mod singers Eleanor Rigby &amp; Martin Burton of The Gents. Together they cut a version of &quot;All or Nothing&quot; for Band Aid Trust. Kenny Lynch persuaded Marriott to get involved, and the single was released under the collective name the Spectrum.

In 1985, Marriott ended his relationship with Piercey when he met Toni Poulton at a Packet of Three gig.

Due to his financial situation, Marriott jokingly later renamed the group Steve Marriott and the Official Receivers. In the mid-1980s Marriott and Poulton moved to a rented cottage in the small village of Arkesden. The 16th century cottage was also used for location shots for the home of the title character in the BBC&#x27;s long-running television series &quot;Lovejoy&quot;, starring Ian McShane. Marriott became well-known locally, often popping into the pub opposite his home to buy bottles of brandy and borrowing glasses. He once turned up wearing trainers and a dressing gown and became something of an eccentric figure, playing pranks, particularly on the owner of the pub.

=== Disillusionment with music business ===
Due to past experiences, in later years Marriott became wary of success and fame as well as involvement with big record companies, and turned down lucrative concert and recording deals with names such as EMI. Because of this attitude, the band grew resentful, believing that he was holding them back, and Packet of Three was disbanded. For the next year Marriott took time off. By now he was 39 years old. He had health problems, was overweight, and had a scruffy appearance. There was little left of the striking 1960s mod icon.

Film-maker Paolo Sedazzari recalled, &quot;I remember going to see him in the 1980s, and he was brilliant. Great voice, great guitarist but what I couldn&#x27;t get over were the dungarees and the mullet haircut. That was really disappointing.&quot; According to his wife, Marriott still smoked cannabis and took cocaine, but nothing compared to what he had once consumed. In his later years Marriott liked reading; his favourite authors included Stephen King, Philip K. Dick and anything on Noël Coward, whom Marriott had always admired.

=== The DTs, various projects: 1988–1990 ===
In May 1988, Marriott started rehearsing with a band from Leicestershire, the DTs, though by the time they starting touring they were called Steve Marriott and the DTs. Despite being out of the public gaze, Marriott was still asked to participate in various projects. Andrew Lloyd Webber asked Marriott to record two songs for his musical &quot;Evita&quot;, though after becoming drunk at the meeting Marriott declined. Film composer Stephen Parsons asked Marriott to sing the title track &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot; for the low budget horror film &quot;Gnaw: Food of the Gods II&quot; (1989); Marriott agreed, seeing it as easy money. While recording the song, Trax Records asked Marriott to record a solo album. &quot;30 Seconds To Midnite&quot; was recorded at Alexandra Palace. Marriott used the money to buy a narrowboat. On 14 July 1989, Marriott and Toni Poulton were married at Epping Register Office. Afterwards, they threw a party at their cottage.

During this period Jim Leverton got in touch and Marriott formed a new group called Steve Marriott&#x27;s Next Band, with Leverton and ex-members of both the DTs and the Official Receivers. When several members left due to financial disagreements, the band name Packet of Three resurfaced.

=== Frampton: 1990–1991 ===
By 1990 Marriott was playing an average 200 gigs a year, when Frampton flew into Britain and asked Marriott to reform Humble Pie to produce a one-off album and a reunion tour. The payment would be enough to allow Marriott to take things easier. He agreed, and they flew out to Frampton&#x27;s recording studio in Los Angeles on 27 January 1991. They began writing songs, but the project was never completed, as Marriott had a change of heart and returned home.

Two recorded songs from this final effort, &quot;The Bigger They Come&quot; and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let You Down&quot;, with Marriott on vocals (and guitar), appeared on Frampton&#x27;s album &quot;Shine On: A Collection&quot;. A third song, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, featuring both Marriott and Frampton, was featured on the first solo recording Frampton made after Marriott&#x27;s death. A fourth song, &quot;An Itch You Can&#x27;t Scratch&quot;, has been found on many illegal compilations and even on one of two &quot;authorised&quot; British releases. The recording date, and whether Frampton played on it, have never been verified.

== Relationships and family ==
Marriott had liaisons with many women and had four children with four of them, including one of his three wives. 

His first wife was model Jenny Rylance (1968–1973). He met American air hostess Pam Stephens in 1975 and their son Toby Marriott was born in 1976. They married after Toby was born. The song &quot;Toe Rag&quot; written 1977 and recorded for the &quot;Majik Mijits&quot; album in 1981, was about the infant Toby who, aged approximately two years old, guested on the original demo as featured on 2005 compilation &quot;Rainy Days&quot;. Marriott&#x27;s third wife was Toni Poulton. They were married from July 1989 until Marriott&#x27;s death in 1991.

Marriott had three daughters. The first, Lesley, was born to fellow teen Sally Foulger before Marriott became famous. She was originally known as Sarah Lisa Foulger (born 9 June 1966). She was adopted but later found out who her father was and has been accepted by her siblings. The second was Tonya, with Canadian Terri Elias in 1984. His third daughter Mollie Mae, known as singer Mollie Marriott, was born in 1985 when Marriott was with his childhood friend Manon Piercey.

== Death ==

On Friday 19 April 1991, Marriott and Poulton flew home from the United States, where Marriott had recorded songs for a future album with Frampton. During the flight, according to Poulton, Marriott was drinking heavily and was in a foul mood, and the two argued constantly. After arriving in the UK, a mutual friend met them and they all went for dinner to one of Marriott&#x27;s favourite restaurants, The Straw Hat in Sawbridgeworth, where he consumed more alcohol. After dinner, they returned to their friend&#x27;s house and decided to stay overnight, since it was late, but upstairs in bed, Marriott and Poulton continued to argue. Poulton finally fell asleep and later woke to discover that Marriott had taken a taxi to his home in the nearby village of Arkesden.

At about 6:30 am on 20 April, a passing motorist saw the roof of Marriott&#x27;s cottage ablaze and called the fire brigade. It was reported that four or five engines were needed to put out the fire. In newspaper interviews, the Assistant Divisional Fire Officer of Essex Fire Brigade, Keith Dunatis, who found Marriott, said:

&quot;It was a tough fight getting upstairs. We searched the bedroom areas and it was very hot, we knew immediately that no-one could have survived the fire. We began to feel around the walls and discovered him lying on the floor between the bed and the wall. I would say he had been in bed and tried to escape. As soon as I saw the body clearly I knew who it was. I used to be a fan, it&#x27;s difficult to put my feelings into words. The scene was horrific in that corner of the room. I saw him lying there and thought what a pity it all was. I deal with many fires but this one was like walking down memory lane. We managed to salvage all his guitars and musical equipment. I feel a bit upset, all the firemen do. It was like seeing part of our lives gone forever.&quot; – (Fire Officer) 

It is believed that the most likely cause of the fire was that soon after arriving home, jet-lagged and tired, in the early hours, Marriott had lit a cigarette while in bed and almost immediately fallen into a deep sleep.

Since Marriott was found lying on the floor between the bed and wall, investigators concluded that he tried unsuccessfully to escape after being awakened by the blaze. Disorientated and confused after inhaling large amounts of thick smoke, Marriott had turned left instead of right towards the bedroom door and safety. He had been unable to rectify his mistake before being overcome by smoke. At the inquest, a verdict of accidental death by smoke inhalation was recorded. Marriott&#x27;s blood was found to contain quantities of Valium (taken earlier for flight nerves), alcohol and cocaine (taken for nerves and/or recreation).

&quot;He (Marriott) was certainly the most talented person I ever worked with. He was like a brother to me and I was devastated when he died. He always lived on the edge and I was always waiting for a &#x27;phone call to say that he had died but I never dreamed it would be under those circumstances. He&#x27;s never got the credit he deserves. He should be in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame because he was the greatest white soul singer that England ever produced. I&#x27;m certain that if you caught the likes of Rod Stewart and Paul Rodgers in a private moment and asked them who was the main man, they would say Steve Marriott.&quot; – Jerry Shirley 

The Small Faces song &quot;All or Nothing&quot; was played as the requiem at Marriott&#x27;s funeral held on 30 April 1991, at the Harlow crematorium. Amongst the mourners, noted attendees included ex-Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones, as well as Peter Frampton, Joe Brown, P. P. Arnold, Terence Stamp, Jerry Shirley and Greg Ridley. Among those who sent wreaths were David Gilmour (of Pink Floyd) and Rod Stewart and his then-wife Rachel Hunter. Nothing was heard from ex-Small Faces members Ian McLagan or Ronnie Lane.

== Legacy ==

To mark the 10th anniversary of Marriott&#x27;s death a tribute concert was held at the London Astoria on 20 April 2001. All the songs performed at this concert were from the Small Faces or Humble Pie catalogue. Pre-1980 Humble Pie alumni Peter Frampton, Clem Clempson, Greg Ridley and Jerry Shirley gave a one-off performance. Other guest appearances included two original members of the Small Faces, Kenney Jones and Ian McLagan, Paul Weller, Noel Gallagher and Bobby Tench from Marriott&#x27;s 1980&#x27;s Humble Pie line-up and John&#x27;s Children. Other musicians such as Alan White, Gem Archer, Midge Ure, Zak Starkey, Rabbit Bundrick, Steve Ellis and Tony Rivers appeared in band line-ups during the two and half-hour concert, released on DVD as the Stevie Marriott Astoria Memorial concert. The proceeds of the concert were donated to &quot;The Small Faces Charitable Trust&quot; set up by Kenney Jones in memory of Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane.

In September 2007 Marriott, along with the other members of the Small Faces and manager Don Arden, were honoured with a plaque unveiled in Carnaby Street, on the site of Don Arden&#x27;s offices, the spiritual home of the band in the 1960s.

Posthumously, his songs have been featured in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; video game franchise, with &quot;Get Down to It&quot; in &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, &quot;Cocaine&quot; in &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, &quot;30 Days in the Hole&quot; and &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot; in &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto Online&quot;; the latter was featured in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;&#x27;s first trailer in 2011.

In May 2024, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Marriott&#x27;s estate had authorised the release of AI-generated recordings of him by Cleopatra Records. The idea was strongly opposed by Marriott&#x27;s children, his former bandmates, and other high-profile musicians. His estate responded that &quot;there are no confirmed plans to use [his] voice on AI recordings ... That does not mean a deal will not be done with one of several suitors who have made offers.&quot;

<text>War Plan Orange (commonly known as Plan Orange or just Orange) was a series of United States Joint Army and Navy Board war plans for dealing with a possible war with Imperial Japan during the years between the First and Second World Wars. It failed to foresee the significance of the technological changes to naval warfare, including the submarine, air support and aircraft carriers, and although the Battle of Midway was important, and the US Navy did &quot;island-hop&quot; to regain lost territory, there was no culminating &quot;showdown&quot; battle as anticipated by Plan Orange.

==Development==

Informal studies as early as 1906 covered a number of possibilities, from basing at Gibraltar or Singapore (an idea revived by the British before World War II) to &quot;a quick trans-Atlantic dash&quot; to the Pacific. The plan eventually adopted was conceived by Rear Admiral Raymond P. Rodgers in 1911.

* 9 Dec 1936: Changes in Joint Basic War Plan Orange (JB 325, Serial 594)
* 19 Feb 1938: Joint Army and Navy Basic War Plan Orange (1938) (JB 325, Serials 617 &amp; 618)

The plan was formally adopted by the Joint Army and Navy Board beginning in 1924. Predating the Rainbow plans, which presumed the assistance of allies, Orange assumed that the United States would fight Japan alone.

==Strategy==
As originally conceived, it anticipated a blockade of the Philippines and other U.S. outposts in the western Pacific. They were expected to hold out on their own while the Pacific Fleet marshaled its strength at bases in California and Hawaii and guarded against attacks on the Panama Canal. After mobilization (the ships maintained only half of their crews in peacetime), the fleet would sail to the western Pacific to relieve American forces in Guam and the Philippines. Afterwards, the fleet would sail north for a decisive battle against the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s Combined Fleet and then blockade the Japanese home islands.

The strategy was in keeping with the theory of Alfred Thayer Mahan, a doctrine to which every major navy subscribed before World War II in which wars would be decided by engagements between opposing surface fleets (as they had been for over 300 years).

Following the 1933 Operations IV Wargame, which resulted in defeat for a hypothetical blue fleet meant to symbolize a US Philippine relief force, War Plan Orange was revised to account for a more steady, methodical advance in order to take Japanese strongpoints in the Marshall Islands. This was done in accordance to observations that both stretched logistical capacity in the &quot;through ticket to the Philippines&quot; strategy, and inability to repair damaged vessels, allowed Japan to gain command of the sea via the neutralization of the US battle line force.

Despite this, the strategy followed by the U.S. in the Pacific War differed little from Rodgers&#x27; concept from 1911: a &quot;leapfrog&quot; campaign to conquer the Marshalls and Carolines (held by Japan before the war); liberation of the Philippines; and blockade. Absent was the &quot;decisive battle&quot; of Mahan, and of Japanese planning.

==Japanese plans==
In accordance with the &quot;Kantai Kessen&quot; naval strategy, the Imperial Japanese Navy developed its own plan that allowed the US Pacific Fleet to sail across the Pacific while the IJN would use submarines and carrier attacks to weaken it. The Japanese fleet would then attempt to force a fleet action against the weakened US fleet in a &quot;decisive battle area&quot;, near Japan, also in line with Mahanian doctrine, which Japan had enthusiastically embraced. It was the basis for Japan&#x27;s demand for a 70% ratio (10:10:7) at the Washington Naval Conference, which was considered necessary to provide Japan superiority in the &quot;decisive battle area&quot; (taking into account that the US had naval commitments in other theaters, while Japan did not). It was also the basis of the United States&#x27; insistence on 60%, which amounted to parity.

== Outcomes ==
Actual events generally followed the plan. Although carrier battles and the use of airplanes and submarines overshadowed surface action, the &quot;leapfrog&quot; campaign played out largely as anticipated.

The Imperial Japanese Navy, obsessed with the &quot;decisive battle&quot; doctrine, ignored the vital need for defense against submarines. The German and American submarine campaigns against their opponents&#x27; merchant shipping demonstrated the need for an anti-submarine warfare strategy. While the Allies took extensive measures to combat the threat of German U-boats, the Japanese failed to effectively counter the American submarines which ultimately choked Japan&#x27;s industrial production and paralyzed her navy. Japan also notably failed to institute an anti-commerce campaign where systematic use of commerce raiders could have made Allied operations much more complex and conquering and holding Japanese-held islands more difficult.

American war planners failed to appreciate that technological advances in submarines and naval aviation had made Mahan&#x27;s doctrine obsolete and did not anticipate a preemptive strike from the Japanese. In particular, they did not yet know either that aircraft would be able to effectively sink battleships or that Japan might put the American battleship force (the Battle Line) out of action at a stroke, which actually happened at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

American plans changed after this attack. Even after major Japanese defeats like Midway, once the effectiveness of aircraft carriers was known, the Americans favored a methodical &quot;island-hopping&quot; advance, never going far beyond land-based air cover. Meanwhile, a blockade was imposed from the very beginning of the war, with the first American submarine, , arriving off Japan on about 31 December 1941.

A number of requirements grew out of Orange, including the specification for a fleet submarine with high speed, long range, and heavy torpedo armament. These coalesced in the submarine in 1932 (only to be rejected and returned to with the in around August 1941). The demand for submarines of this size also drove the development of the notoriously problematic Mark 14 torpedo (and its equally notorious Mark VI exploder), under the guidance of Commander Ralph W. Christie. The Navy also spent &quot;several hundred thousand dollars&quot; to develop powerful, compact diesel engines, among them the troublesome Hooven-Owens-Rentschler, which proved useful for railroads.

<doc id="329882" wikidata="Q505072" url="?curid=329882" title="Johnny Thunders">
<text>John Anthony Genzale (July 15, 1952 – April 23, 1991), known professionally as Johnny Thunders, was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. He came to prominence in the early 1970s as a member of New York Dolls. He later played with the Heartbreakers and as a solo artist.

==Early life and career==

Thunders was born John Anthony Genzale in Queens, New York, the second child of Josephine Genzale (née Nicoletti, 1923–1999) and Emil Genzale (1923–1982), both of Italian descent (Neapolitan/Sicilian). Thunders had an older sister, Mariann (1946–2009). He first lived in East Elmhurst and then Jackson Heights.

His first musical performance was in the winter of 1967 with The Reign. Shortly thereafter, he played with Johnny and the Jaywalkers, under the name Johnny Volume, at Quintano&#x27;s School for Young Professionals, around the corner from Carnegie Hall, on 56th Street near 7th Avenue.

In 1968, he began going to the Fillmore East and Bethesda Fountain in Central Park on weekends. His older sister, Mariann, started styling his hair like Keith Richards. In late 1969, he got a job as a sales clerk at D&#x27;Naz leather shop, on Bleecker Street in the West Village, and started trying to put a band together. He and his girlfriend, Janis Cafasso, went to see The Rolling Stones at Madison Square Garden in November 1969, and they appear in the Maysles brothers&#x27; film &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;.

Dolls bass guitarist Arthur &quot;Killer&quot; Kane later wrote about Thunders&#x27;s guitar sound, as he described arriving outside the rehearsal studio where they were meeting to jam together for the first time: &quot;I heard someone playing a guitar riff that I myself didn&#x27;t know how to play. It was raunchy, nasty, rough, raw, and untamed. I thought it was truly inspired ...&quot;, adding, &quot;His sound was rich and fat and beautiful, like a voice.&quot;

The New York Dolls were signed to Mercury Records, with the help of A &amp; R man Paul Nelson. Thunders recorded two albums with the band, &quot;New York Dolls&quot; and&quot; Too Much Too Soon&quot;. They were managed by Marty Thau, and booked by Leber &amp; Krebs. Subsequently, they worked with Malcolm McLaren for several months, later becoming a prototype for the Sex Pistols.

In 1975, Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan left the band; Thunders later blamed McLaren for the band&#x27;s demise. The Dolls&#x27; lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain continued playing, along with Peter Jordan, Tony Machine (an ex-assistant agent at Leber &amp; Krebs) and Chris Robison, as the New York Dolls until late 1976.

==The Heartbreakers==
Thunders formed The Heartbreakers with former New York Dolls drummer Jerry Nolan and former Television bassist Richard Hell. Walter Lure, former guitarist for the New York City punk band The Demons joined them soon after. After conflict arose between Thunders and Hell, Hell left to form Richard Hell and the Voidoids and was replaced by Billy Rath. With Thunders leading the band, the Heartbreakers toured America before going to the UK to join the Sex Pistols, The Clash and The Damned on the Anarchy Tour. The group stayed in the UK throughout 1977, where their popularity was significantly greater than in the U.S., particularly among punk bands. 

While in the UK, they were signed to Track Records and released their only official studio album, &quot;L.A.M.F.&quot;, an abbreviation for &quot;Like A Mother Fucker&quot;. &quot;L.A.M.F.&quot; was received positively by critics, but was criticised for its poor production. Displeased with the production, the band members individually remixed the record, a competition which culminated in drummer Jerry Nolan quitting in November 1977. Shortly thereafter, the Heartbreakers disbanded.

==Solo career, Gang War and Heartbreakers reunions==
Thunders stayed in London and recorded the first of a number of solo albums, beginning with &quot;So Alone&quot; in 1978. The drug-fuelled recording sessions featured a core band of Thunders, bassist Phil Lynott, drummer Paul Cook and guitarist Steve Jones, with guest appearances from Chrissie Hynde, Steve Marriott, Walter Lure, Billy Rath and Peter Perrett. The CD version of the album contains four bonus tracks, including the single &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; and a cover of the early Marc Bolan song &quot;The Wizard&quot;. 

Soon afterwards, Thunders moved back to the US, joining former Heartbreakers Walter Lure, Billy Rath and sometimes Jerry Nolan for gigs at Max&#x27;s Kansas City venue in New York City. Around this time Thunders played a small number of gigs at London&#x27;s The Speakeasy Club with a line up including Cook and Jones, Henri Paul on bass and Judy Nylon and Patti Palladin (Snatch) as back up vocalists.
In late 1979, Thunders moved to Detroit with his wife Julie and began performing in a band called Gang War. Other members included John Morgan, Ron Cooke, Philippe Marcade and former MC5 guitarist Wayne Kramer. They recorded several demos and performed live several times before disbanding. Zodiac Records released an EP of their demos in 1987. In 1990 they also released a live album titled &quot;Gang War&quot;, which was credited to Thunders and Kramer.

During the early 1980s, Thunders re-formed The Heartbreakers for various tours; the group recorded their final album, &quot;Live at the Lyceum&quot;, in 1984. The concert was also filmed and released as a video and later a DVD titled &quot;Dead Or Alive&quot;.

In the 1980s, Thunders lived in Paris and Stockholm with his wife and daughter. In 1985, he released &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot;, a collection of new songs with his then band The Black Cats, and &quot;Crawfish&quot;, a duet with former Snatch vocalist Patti Palladin. Three years later, he again teamed up with Palladin to release &quot;Copy Cats&quot;, a covers album. The album, produced by Palladin, featured a wide assortment of musicians to recreate the 1950s and 1960s sound of the originals, including Alexander Balanescu on violin, Bob Andrews on piano, The Only Ones John Perry and others on guitar, and a horn section.

==Final years==
From August 1988 until his death in April 1991, Thunders performed in The Oddballs, with Jamie Heath (saxophone), Alison Gordy (vocals), Chris Musto (drums), Stevie Klasson (guitar) and Jill Wisoff (bass). From April–May 1990, Thunders performed an acoustic tour of the UK and Ireland joining up occasionally with John, Sam and Peter of The Golden Horde, whom he had met and played with previously in 1984 at the TV Club, and were concurrently on tour (of the UK and Ireland) at that time also, for full-band electric performances and TV appearances. On May 8, 1990, recording sessions in London for a joint EP-single cover version with The Golden Horde of &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; by The Archies, and original material, had to be cancelled when Thunders experienced health problems following his performances in Wakefield, UK while on tour.

His final recording was a version of &quot;Born To Lose&quot;, with German punk rock band Die Toten Hosen, recorded 36 hours before his death in New Orleans.

==Death==
Rumors surround Thunders&#x27;s death at the Inn on St. Peter hotel (formerly known as St. Peter Guest House) in New Orleans, Louisiana, on April 23, 1991.

Thunders apparently died of drug-related causes, but it has been speculated that it was the result of . According to his autobiography &quot;Lobotomy: Surviving The Ramones&quot;, Dee Dee Ramone took a call in New York City the next day from Stevie Klasson, Thunders&#x27; rhythm guitar player. Dee Dee said, &quot;They told me that Johnny had gotten mixed up with some bastards ... who ripped him off for his methadone supply. They had given him LSD and then murdered him. He had gotten a pretty large supply of methadone in England, so he could travel and stay away from those creeps – the drug dealers, Thunders imitators, and losers like that.&quot;

Singer Willy DeVille, who lived next door to the hotel in which Thunders died, described his death this way:

There is conflicting information about the New Orleans coroner&#x27;s report.

An article in the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; states: &quot;[He] died of an overdose of cocaine and methadone, according to the coroner&#x27;s office in New Orleans. Chief investigator John Gagliano said tests completed last week found substantial amounts of both drugs.&quot;

However, other sources state that an autopsy was conducted by the New Orleans coroner, but served only to compound the mystery. According to Thunders&#x27;s biographer Nina Antonia as posted on the Jungle Records website, the level of drugs found in his system was not fatal. According to the book &quot;Rock Bottom: Dark Moments in Music Babylon&quot; by Pamela Des Barres, who interviewed Thunders&#x27;s sister, Mariann Bracken, the autopsy confirmed evidence of advanced leukemia, which would explain the decline in Thunders&#x27;s appearance in the final year of his life.

In a 1994 &quot;Melody Maker&quot; interview, Thunders&#x27;s manager Mick Webster described the family&#x27;s efforts to get New Orleans police to investigate the matter further: &quot;We keep asking the New Orleans police to re-investigate, but they haven&#x27;t been particularly friendly. They seemed to think that this was just another junkie who had wandered into town and died. They simply weren&#x27;t interested.&quot;

Thunders was survived by his wife Julie Jourden and four children: sons John, Vito, and Dino, and daughter Jamie Genzale by Susanne Blomqvist.

<doc id="329883" wikidata="Q1737017" url="?curid=329883" title="Kauffman Stadium">
<text>Kauffman Stadium () (nicknamed &quot;The K&quot;) is a ballpark located in Kansas City, Missouri, and the home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Kansas City Royals. It is next door to Arrowhead Stadium, home of National Football League&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs. Both make up the Truman Sports Complex. The stadium is named for Ewing Kauffman, the founder and first owner of the Royals. It opened in 1973 as Royals Stadium and was named for Kauffman twenty years later on July 2, 1993. Since its last major renovation in 2009, the listed seating capacity is 37,903.

Kauffman Stadium was built specifically for baseball during an era when building multisport &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; stadiums was commonplace. It is often held up along with Dodger Stadium (1962) in Los Angeles as one of the best examples of modernist stadium design. It is currently the only stadium in the American League to be named after a person and is also one of eight stadiums in Major League Baseball that does not have a corporate-sponsored name. The stadium is the sixth-oldest stadium in the majors and has hosted the 1973 and the 2012 MLB All-Star Games, along with Royals home games during the 1980, 1985, 2014, and 2015 World Series. Between 2007 and 2009, Kauffman Stadium underwent a $250 million renovation, which included updates and upgrades in fan amenities, a new Royals hall of fame area, and other updates throughout the facility.

In 2022, the Royals announced intentions to build and open a new stadium before the team&#x27;s lease agreement with Jackson County expires at the end of the 2030 MLB season. In 2024, the team announced their intention for the stadium to be located in downtown Kansas City&#x27;s Crossroads district. The plan would involve displacing several small businesses that would be in the footprint of the stadium. In April 2024, Jackson County voters overwhelmingly rejected a ballot initiative to help fund the new stadium by a 16% margin. A financial analysis of the new stadium plans estimates that the cost to taxpayers would be between $4.4 billion to $6.4 billion. As of June 2024, the team was considering relocating to Kansas City, Kansas.

==History==
In 1967, voters in Jackson County approved the bonds for the Truman Sports Complex, which replaced the multipurpose Municipal Stadium and featured a football stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs and a baseball stadium for the Kansas City Athletics. The owner of the Athletics, Charles O. Finley, had just signed a new lease to remain in Kansas City. The proposal of the Truman Sports Complex was unusual, as conventional wisdom at the time held that separate football and baseball stadiums were not commercially viable. Before the 1968 season, however, Finley moved the A&#x27;s to Oakland, California, and their brand-new multi-purpose stadium.
After the move, Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri threatened to press for the revocation of baseball&#x27;s anti-trust exemption if they did not give Kansas City a new team. Major League Baseball responded by hastily granting expansion franchises to four cities, including a Kansas City team owned by local pharmaceutical magnate Ewing Kauffman. The new teams were due to start to play in . However, Symington forced MLB to move up the start date to as he was unwilling to have Kansas City wait three years to have baseball again. The other expansion team in the American League, the Seattle Pilots, were without a suitable stadium in 1969 and the accelerated schedule forced by Symington led to their bankruptcy after just one season. In 1970, they relocated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Milwaukee Brewers. With lawsuits pending, Seattle returned to the majors with the Mariners in 1977.

Jackson County continued its plans to build a new ballpark. Like the rest of the complex, it was designed by Kivett and Myers, and constructed by the joint venture of the Sharp, Kidde, and Webb construction firms. Royals Stadium broke ground on July 11, 1968, and was opened in on April 10, 1973, with a 12–1 win over the Texas Rangers that saw 39,464 fans in attendance. Five weeks later, Nolan Ryan of the California Angels threw the first of his seven no-hitters, blanking the Royals 3–0, three walks away from a perfect game. Two months later on July 24, the stadium hosted the first of its two All-Star Games.

Following the 1976 regular season, the Royals competed in the first postseason game of their history on October 9, but lost 4–1 at home to the New York Yankees in the ALCS. The Royals won the next game 6–3 on October 10 for their first postseason win in Royals Stadium.
The first World Series game held in Kansas City was on October 17, 1980, against the Philadelphia Phillies. In the first inning, George Brett hit a home run down the right field line, and the Royals recorded their first-ever World Series win, 4–3 in ten innings, but lost the Series in six games.

On October 11, 1985, in Game 3 of the ALCS, Brett hit two home runs off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Doyle Alexander, made a back-handed stop at third base to throw out a runner at home, and recorded the final out to give the Royals a much-needed 6–5 win. The Royals went on to win the American League pennant in seven games.

Two weeks later, on October 27, the Royals clinched their first World Series title in franchise history, winning Game 7 in Royals Stadium. Led by the pitching of Bret Saberhagen, Darryl Motley&#x27;s two-run home run, and George Brett&#x27;s four hits, the Royals beat the St. Louis Cardinals 11–0; Motley caught the title-clinching out. The Royals were the first team in the history of the World Series to lose the first two games of the series at home and come back to win.
In 2012, the stadium hosted its second All-Star Game, which the National League won 8–0.

The stadium hosted the Royals&#x27; first playoff game in nearly 29 years when the city&#x27;s former team, the Athletics, came to town in 2014 for the Wild Card Game. Despite trailing 7–3 in the eighth inning, Kansas City rallied to win 9-8 and advanced to the ALDS. They won their ALDS, the ALCS, and hosted Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 of the World Series, but fell to the San Francisco Giants.

In 2015, Kansas City returned to the playoffs, this time as the top seed in the American League. Games 1, 2, and 5 of the ALDS against the Houston Astros were played at the stadium, with the Royals winning Games 2 and 5, as well as Games 1, 2, and 6 of the ALCS against the Toronto Blue Jays, with the Royals winning all three games. The stadium hosted games 1 and 2 of the World Series against the New York Mets as a result of the American League winning the All-Star Game 6–3. The Royals won Game 1 (5–4 in 14 innings) and game 2 (7–1), as well and closed out the Mets in five games to win the 2015 World Series.

==Future==
In 2020, Kansas City-based design firm Populous unveiled a concept for a potential new downtown baseball stadium, showing an intimate facility with unique amenities. In November 2022, team owner John Sherman announced the franchise&#x27;s controversial intention to leave Kauffman Stadium before the lease ends after the 2030 MLB season, with intentions of building a new stadium in downtown Kansas City (East Village) or North Kansas City.

In April 2024, Jackson County rejected a ballot initiative to extend the Royals&#x27; pre-existing 3/8-cent sales tax for Kauffman Stadium to build a new stadium in the Crossroads district in downtown Kansas City near the intersection of 16th and McGee streets (south of T-Mobile Center) with over 58% of voters against. the ballot also included funding renovations to Arrowhead stadium. 

The plan was a controversial one, Considering the proposed stadium location would displace over a dozen small businesses, the limited amount of parking downtown, and claims that Kauffman got a “bad batch of concrete” when built. The Royals had pledged to invest at least $1 billion towards purchasing and developing land around the stadium, but was only willing to put $300 million towards a new ballpark. 

Shortly after the vote, the wife of Royals majority owner Marny Sherman, criticized the vote results stating, “The lack of leadership has lost the city two treasured assets. I mean if you don’t support the Chiefs after three Super Bowl wins why would they stay? We will be lucky if both teams wind up in Kansas.” No more Jackson County for sure&#x27;: Wife of Royals owner reacts to election results The stadium would have a seating capacity of about 34,000.

On June 8, 2024, Sam Mellinger, the Royals&#x27; vice president of communications, said that the team is evaluating &quot;all options that may be available with respect to a new stadium,&quot; and pointed to the Kansas Legislature&#x27;s upcoming vote to make changes to the state&#x27;s Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) bonds program to attract major sports teams to the state.

In August 2024, &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; reported that the Royals were considering a new site for a downtown ballpark in Washington State Park, an area located between Union Station and Crown Center. In November 2024, it was reported that the Royals were also examining &quot;two or three&quot; potential stadium sites in Johnson County, Kansas.

==Features==
Kauffman Stadium was the only baseball-only park built in the majors (not counting temporary facilities) from 1966 to 1991. It was one of the few baseball-only facilities built in the majors during the heyday of the cookie-cutter stadium era, and is one of two such facilities (with Dodger Stadium) that are still active and were never converted for use as multi-purpose stadiums.

Although a baseball-only facility, its design took several stylistic cues from the multi-purpose stadiums of the day, plus the Googie style that was more prevalent in the decades prior. The main stadium itself is primarily concrete, with a smooth, uncovered concrete facade. The stands wrap around the infield and end at the foul poles, with smaller bleacher sections (or &quot;outfield plazas,&quot; as the Royals call them) in the outfield. In their book, &quot;The Ultimate Baseball Road Trip&quot;, Josh Pahigian and Kevin O&#x27;Connell wrote that it is essentially one-third of a cookie-cutter stadium, containing only the seats in a cookie-cutter stadium that provide the best views for baseball. The upper deck is quite steep, though not as high as other parks built during this time. Many minor-league stadiums built in the 1980s and early 1990s, as well as Rate Field in Chicago, employ a similar design.
The park&#x27;s best-known feature is the fountain and waterfall display (known as the Water Spectacular) behind the right-field fence. At , it is the largest privately funded fountain in the world. The fountains are on display before and after the game and between innings, while the waterfalls are constantly flowing.
When the stadium was originally built, Kansas City was the westernmost major league city other than those along the Pacific Coast (1,600 mi. [2,600 km] away), which was a major reason why the Royals initially decided to use a faster-draining AstroTurf surface. Before the Colorado Rockies expansion franchise began play in Denver, Colorado, in the 1993 Major League Baseball season, the Royals&#x27; &quot;home&quot; territory included the Rocky Mountains in addition to a large swath of the Great Plains, and Kauffman didn&#x27;t want fans who drove many hundreds of miles to go home without seeing games completed. The Truman Sports Complex&#x27;s legendary groundskeeper, George Toma, best known as the head groundskeeper for every Super Bowl, thus had the job of maintaining two carpets for most of his career. He also maintained the surface at Arrowhead Stadium, which had AstroTurf from 1972 through 1993. However, Toma has said that artificial turf requires a good deal of maintenance as well; his crews were able to keep Royals Stadium&#x27;s original carpet for two decades, somewhat longer than the typical lifetime for outdoor artificial turf. This is also due to the fact that Kauffman Stadium has never hosted a football game, and has no movable seating, thus avoiding the wear and tear typical of cookie-cutter stadiums.

The stadium&#x27;s AstroTurf was replaced by grass for the 1995 season. As part of the project, perforated tiles were installed at centers across the entire field in order to improve drainage.

In 2014, the Royals started placing a &quot;W&quot; on the Hall of Fame wall for every home win, similar to the Chicago Cubs hoisting a white flag with a blue &quot;W&quot; at Wrigley Field for every Cub home win.

==Renovations==

Prior to the 1991 season, a Sony Jumbotron full-color video board was installed beyond the left field wall. At tall and wide, it was the largest of its kind in the United States when it debuted, and remained in use through the 2007 season.

In order to generate more home runs, Kauffman Stadium&#x27;s outfield fences from bullpen to bullpen were moved in ten feet from their original dimensions, and the outfield wall height was reduced from to prior to the 1995 season. They were returned to their original dimensions prior to the 2005 season.

On opening Day 1999, minor renovations were debuted, including the addition of the &quot;Crown Club&quot; premium seating area behind home plate between the dugouts, and dugout level suites. Kauffman Stadium&#x27;s seats originally featured a descending color scheme of red, gold, and orange, similar to Arrowhead Stadium; the original field level seats in Kauffman Stadium were replaced by dark blue seats, and by 2000, the gold loge level seats and red upper-level seats were all replaced by dark blue seats, the field level seats also getting cupholders.
On April 4, 2006, Jackson County voters approved a 0.375% sales tax increase to fund plans to renovate the Truman Sports Complex. As part of this measure, every Jackson County residential address was to receive vouchers good for 50% off two tickets at Royals games on certain nights. The construction began with a ceremonial groundbreaking inside Kauffman Stadium on October 3, 2007, with completion of Kauffman Stadium in time for Opening Day in 2009, and full renovation of the complex (including nearby Arrowhead Stadium) by 2010, depending upon cost overruns. The team committed to a lease that will keep them in Kansas City until 2030, an extension of their current lease expiration of 2015.

The improvements to Kauffman Stadium included the following:

* Reducing seating capacity to 37,903
* Four new entry ticket gates
* Enhanced vertical circulation to all seating levels
* Wider concourses
* Two widened vomitorium portals in the upper deck
* Two widened vomitorium portals in the field level
* New and upgraded concessions and toilet amenities on all concourses
* New press facilities
* New HD scoreboard, dubbed &quot;Crown Vision,&quot; and control room
* 360-degree outfield concourse
* Fountain view terraces
* Outfield kids&#x27; area
* &quot;Taste of KC&quot; food court
* Right field sports bar-themed restaurant
* Left field Hall of Fame and conference center
* New group sales areas

Extensive renovations in the outfield including the relocation of the bullpens caused the left and right center field dimensions to be increased by .

The new HD scoreboard was one of the first features to be installed. It replaced the matrix board in the shape of the Royals logo that had been in use in the park since its opening, along with the video board in left field. It was adorned with a crown, giving it an appearance similar to the old matrix board. The new scoreboard was ready for Opening Day 2008. It is wide and tall, and was, at the time it entered service, the largest high-definition LED display in the world. The Kauffman Stadium screen was eventually surpassed by the new scoreboard at Seattle&#x27;s T-Mobile Park in 2013. The display was assembled in 55 separate segments, including an active bottom taper to resemble the shield in the Royals logo. The video scoreboard alone cost $8.3 million, and the control room that operates it is staffed with 17 people on game days. Strobe lights atop the crown flash after every Royals home run.

A second proposal on the April 2006 ballot would have installed a rolling roof at the Truman Sports Complex. The roof could have been moved to cover either Kauffman Stadium or Arrowhead Stadium when needed. The proposal was defeated by less than 4,000 votes.

==Concerts==


==Buck O&#x27;Neil legacy seat==

Beginning with the 2007 season, the Royals had a red seat placed in the stadium amongst the all-blue seats behind home plate to honor Buck O&#x27;Neil. Every game, there will be a person who embodies the spirit of Buck O&#x27;Neil selected from community nominees to sit in that seat, formerly occupied by O&#x27;Neil. The seat is located behind home plate in what was Section 101, Row C, Seat 1, until 2008. Due to the stadium renovations and accompanying section renumbering in 2009, the seat number is now Section 127, Row C, Seat 9, and the seat bottom is now padded. O&#x27;Neil played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro leagues from 1937 to 1955.

==Statues==
Four statues lay out in the outfield concourse behind the fountains. Three of the statues are located in right field (George Brett, Dick Howser and Frank White). The fourth is located in left field, and is the former Royals owner Ewing Kauffman and his wife Muriel.

==Notes==
: Candlestick Park (), Angel Stadium (), and Jarry Park Stadium () were all originally built as baseball-only facilities. Candlestick Park has been demolished, and Jarry Park Stadium was renovated into Stade IGA, a tennis-specific stadium with only a small portion of the original stadium present. Both Candlestick Park and Angel Stadium were converted to multi-purpose facilities. Anaheim Stadium, now known as Angel Stadium of Anaheim, was re-converted into a baseball-only facility in 1996, though that venue continues to host high school playoff football games.

<doc id="329886" wikidata="Q355382" url="?curid=329886" title="Midge Ure">
<text>James &quot;Midge&quot; Ure (; born 10 October 1953) is a Scottish singer-songwriter and record producer. His stage name, Midge, is a phonetic reversal of Jim. Ure enjoyed particular success in the 1970s and 1980s in bands including Slik, Thin Lizzy, Rich Kids, Visage, and as the second bandleader of Ultravox after John Foxx had left, carrying the band into the high charts positions for the six following years before disbanding it. In 1984, he co-wrote and produced the charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; putting together for the occasion the supergroup Band Aid. The single has sold 3.7 million copies in the UK at first release, and has become a staple of Christmas songs compilations ever since. The song is the second-highest-selling single in UK chart history. 
Ure co-organised Band Aid and the events Live Aid and Live 8 with Bob Geldof. He acts as a trustee for the charity and also serves as an ambassador for Save the Children.

Ure is the producer and writer of several other synth-pop and new wave hit singles of the 1980s, including &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; (1980) by Visage and the Ultravox signature songs &quot;Vienna&quot; (1980), &quot;Hymn&quot; (1983) and &quot;Dancing with Tears in My Eyes&quot; (1984). He achieved his first UK top 10 solo hit in 1982 with &quot;No Regrets&quot;. In 1985, his solo debut studio album &quot;The Gift&quot; reached number two in the UK Albums Chart and yielded the UK Singles Chart number-one single &quot;If I Was&quot;. He also co-wrote Phil Lynott&#x27;s &quot;Yellow Pearl&quot;, which served as the theme of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; for much of the 1980s.

==Biography and career==

===Early years===
Born to a working-class family in Cambuslang (on the outskirts of Glasgow), Ure attended Rutherglen Academy until he was 15 years old. For the first 10 years of his life he lived in a one-bedroom tenement flat in Cambuslang with his brother, sister and parents, later moving to a new house in nearby Eastfield.

After leaving school, Ure attended Motherwell Technical College and then began to work as an engineer, training at the National Engineering Laboratory (NEL) in nearby East Kilbride. He started playing music in a Glasgow band called Stumble (c.1969 – c.1971).

Ure joined Salvation as a guitarist in 1972. The band had been formed in Glasgow in June 1970 by the brothers Kevin (vocals) and Jim McGinlay (bass guitar). Jim McGinlay (born James McGinlay) decided to turn Ure&#x27;s name backwards to &quot;Mij&quot; (Midge, as a good-natured mocking hint to Ure&#x27;s diminutive stature) to avoid any confusion caused by two members of the band having the same first name. Ure has since presented himself in the music scene as Midge Ure. The band performed covers as house band in the Glasgow and Edinburgh Clouds discothèques. The band also comprised Billy McIsaac on keyboards and Kenny Hyslop on drums.

In April 1974, Kevin McGinlay left to pursue a solo career, so Ure assumed vocals in addition to his guitar duties. In November 1974, the band changed its name to Slik, with Bay City Rollers writers Bill Martin and Phil Coulter providing songs. In 1975 Ure turned down an offer to join the Sex Pistols, stating that he felt at the time that Malcolm McLaren had &quot;his priorities completely wrong!&quot;, a position he later reversed.

Slik achieved a number one single on the UK Singles Chart in February 1976 with &quot;Forever and Ever&quot;. In early 1977, Jim McGinlay decided to quit the band, being replaced by Russell Webb. Slik terminated their contract with Martin and Coulter, believing that their boy band image was hindering their chances of success during the rising punk rock scene. They changed their name to PVC2 and adopted a more punkish style. Ure&#x27;s only release with the band under this name was the single &quot;Put You in the Picture&quot;.

===Rich Kids===
By October 1977, Ure had left PVC2 to join former Sex Pistol bass guitarist Glen Matlock in Rich Kids. He moved to London and soon found himself immersed in a scene he had previously only read about in the pages of the &quot;NME&quot;. Musical tensions within the band led to Ure&#x27;s departure. Having acquired a Yamaha CS50 synthesiser, Ure – alongside bandmate Rusty Egan – wanted to integrate the new instrument into the band&#x27;s sound. With Glen Matlock and Steve New preferring to remain with the traditional guitars and drums approach, the band broke up.

In January 2010, Rich Kids reformed, for one night only, for a benefit concert for former Rich Kids guitarist Steve New, going then by the name Stella Nova, who was fighting terminal cancer (and who died on 24 May 2010). Although it had been over 30 years since they played together, the press reports praised the gig, which included energetic performances of &quot;Ghosts of Princes in Towers&quot; and &quot;Hung on You&quot;. Rich Kids were joined onstage by Mick Jones of the Clash and Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet. Ure also played an acoustic set of Ultravox and Visage songs.

In February 2016, it was announced that Rich Kids would reform for a joint headline show with the Professionals at London&#x27;s O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. The show was later rescheduled (due to building work at the Empire) to the O2 Islington Academy on Thu 23 June 2016, and went ahead as rescheduled, with Ure singing and playing guitar.

===Visage===
In 1978, Egan and Ure formed Visage with lead vocalist Steve Strange, and utilised their new synthesiser when they recorded a cover of the Zager and Evans classic &quot;In the Year 2525&quot; for promotional purposes. The line-up was expanded in 1979 with the addition of Magazine members Dave Formula, John McGeoch and Barry Adamson, and Ultravox keyboardist Billy Currie, and the band signed briefly to Radar Records for the release of their first single &quot;Tar&quot; in November 1979. The single failed to chart, but the band managed to secure a deal with Polydor Records, the following year. In November 1980 their second single, &quot;Fade to Grey&quot;, became a hit-single (making the top ten in the UK and topping the chart in several other countries), and was quickly followed by the release of their self-titled debut album which was also a chart success.

In 1982 the second album &quot;The Anvil&quot; went silver in the UK and reached number 6 in the album chart, although the album spawned two further hit singles (&quot;The Damned Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and &quot;Night Train&quot;), tensions within the band members were beginning to threaten its musical future. Ure left Visage shortly after the second album was released, citing creative differences with frontman Steve Strange.

===Thin Lizzy===
Ure already knew Thin Lizzy singer Phil Lynott, and in early 1979 Ure received co-writing credit for &quot;Get Out of Here&quot; on Thin Lizzy&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Black Rose&quot; (1979). In July 1979 Ure stepped in to help Thin Lizzy complete a US tour following guitarist Gary Moore&#x27;s abrupt departure. Ure also contributed guitar parts to &quot;Things Ain&#x27;t Working Out&quot; and &quot;Dublin&quot; for the Thin Lizzy remix compilation album &quot;The Continuing Saga of the Ageing Orphans&quot; (1979). Thin Lizzy then toured America and Japan. In 1980, during the second part of this tour, Ure switched to keyboards, and was replaced by Dave Flett and then Snowy White as guitarist. At the end of the tour Ure left Thin Lizzy and returned to his primary interest at that time, Ultravox. Ure continued to collaborate with Lynott, co-writing Lynott&#x27;s biggest solo hit, &quot;Yellow Pearl&quot;, and produced the track &quot;Together&quot; on &quot;The Philip Lynott Album&quot;.

===Ultravox===

In 1979, Ure and Billy Currie formed a close bond playing together in Visage. Rusty Egan persuaded Billy Currie to ask Ure if he was interested in joining a revived Ultravox. Ultravox had been presumed defunct since guitarist Robin Simon quit and lead vocalist John Foxx had left to pursue a solo career. In April 1979 Ure regrouped the band and assumed duties as singer, songwriter, guitarist and second keyboardist. This second incarnation would become the classic line-up, with Currie (keyboards, violin), Chris Cross (bass) and Warren Cann (electronic drums). Although Ure had spent the latter half of 1979 on tour with Thin Lizzy, Ultravox found time late in the year to tour in the US. During this time the band wrote a number of songs which were included on their first studio album with Ure.

The album, &quot;Vienna&quot;, was released in July 1980. Although it was the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, it was the first with Ure, and the first one to chart, although it was only a minor success on first release. However, when the title track &quot;Vienna&quot; was released as a single in January 1981 it became a huge hit and spent four weeks at no. 2 in the UK singles chart and was the 5th highest selling single in the UK that year. The album itself re-entered the album chart and peaked at no. 3. Inspired by the film noir &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), the music video for &quot;Vienna&quot; was directed by Russell Mulcahy utilising cinematic techniques, and became quite influential. In an interview Ure recalled the way that &quot;music video changed after that. All these things that became video clichés – cropping the top and bottom off the screen, shooting on film as opposed to videotape, making it look like a movie ... we were quite a groundbreaking act for a while.&quot; The same year that Ultravox released the &quot;Vienna&quot; album, Visage also released their self-titled debut studio album which made the UK Top 20 and featured the hit single &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; (co-written by Ure and Currie with Chris Payne), also influential in the direction of the New Romantic electropop music scene.
For a while between 1979 and 1980, then, Ure was deeply committed to three different bands, all of them quite successful: Ultravox, Visage and Thin Lizzy.

In September 1981, Ultravox released their second studio album with Ure as frontman, &quot;Rage in Eden&quot;, which was a Top 5 hit in the UK. This period saw Ure also work as a producer for other artists, amongst them Steve Harley, Peter Godwin, and Strasse. In 1982 Ure had left Visage, and Ultravox released their third studio album with Ure, &quot;Quartet&quot;, in October 1982, with production by Beatles producer George Martin. The album became their third Top 10 hit and featured four Top 20 singles.

After the live album &quot;Monument&quot; released in October 1983, Ultravox released their fourth studio album with Ure, &quot;Lament&quot;, in April 1984. The album was another Top 10 success and contained the Top 3 hit &quot;Dancing with Tears in My Eyes&quot;. The band released &quot;The Collection&quot;, their first &quot;greatest hits&quot; album at the end of the year, featuring all the singles from 1980 onwards. The album peaked at no. 2 in the UK and was later certified triple platinum.

After Ure&#x27;s successful debut solo studio album in 1985, the fifth and final Ultravox studio album with Ure, &quot;U-Vox&quot;, was released in October 1986. Although another Top 10 hit, the album (and singles) fared less well than their earlier releases. After the end of the U-Vox Tour Ure left Ultravox. He stated in an Extreme Voice Fanzine 1991: &quot;The spark kind of went out of it for me, Live Aid and Band Aid had a lot to do with it, I suppose. We had a long break from each other and when we came back together we were all working in different directions&quot;.&quot;I think we went out with a kind of whimper but we chose to do that really, we didn&#x27;t do the all-singing, all-dancing farewell tour cash-in that a load of bands do. I had decided that I was leaving before we did our last European tour, the U-Vox tour. We were in Italy.&quot;

Ure and Currie had met in October 2008 and played an acoustic &quot;Vienna&quot; together on Absolute Radio in UK. In April 2009, Ure and the other members (Cann, Currie and Cross) reformed Ultravox for the Return to Eden tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the album &quot;Vienna&quot; (1980), and in their own words, the &quot;anniversary of their classic line-up&quot;. Ure stated in a BBC interview in April 2009, &quot;we are not trying to get our youth back, nor the hair that&#x27;s fallen off already&quot;. After appearing at the Isle of Wight Festival 2009 Ultravox followed up the next year with a second round of the tour. In late 2010, Ultravox started working on their sixth studio album fronted by Ure. This album, titled &quot;Brilliant&quot;, was released in May 2012. Following this release the band embarked on the &#x27;Brilliant Tour&#x27; performing shows in the UK and Europe in late 2012. In November 2013, Ultravox were special guests on a four-date arena tour with Simple Minds.

Ure also did backstage photography for Ultravox.

===Band Aid and charity work===
In November 1984, Ure co-wrote the Band Aid hit, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; with Bob Geldof. Ure was rehearsing with Ultravox for an episode of the Channel 4 music show &quot;The Tube&quot; when host Paula Yates handed him the phone. It was her then husband, Geldof, who proceeded, recalls Ure, &quot;to rant on about the Michael Buerk BBC news report on the Ethiopian famine&quot;. Geldof provided the initial lyrics, with Ure working the musical theme on a small keyboard in his kitchen. The second half was composed by Ure, with the bridging chorus only assembled in the studio when the artists had gathered. Ure has described the song as not one of the best he has ever written, commenting that &quot;the momentum the artists gave it in the recording studio is what made it&quot;.

At the studio recording Ure took on the production duties for the song. Although Trevor Horn had been approached to undertake this role, he needed more time to fulfill other obligations than was available. Ure stepped into the breach, with Horn providing his studio, remixing the track and producing the 12&quot; version. Ure and Geldof jointly set up the Band Aid Trust, and he remains active as a Band Aid Trustee. He also co-organised the Live Aid concert of 1985 along with Geldof and Harvey Goldsmith. Geldof and Ure have been honoured with two Ivor Novello Awards for writing the song.

In 1988, Ure helped to organise the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute, at which he also performed. He first performed at The Prince&#x27;s Trust rock concert 1982, and has also been the Musical Director at the concerts 1986, 1987, 1988, 2010 and 2011.

Ure performed at Music for Montserrat on 15 September 1997 to raise funds for the Caribbean island of Montserrat, which had been devastated by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and again in 1997, when the island was impacted by volcanic activity. Ure himself lost a house on Montserrat, which was destroyed.

On 24 July 1999, Ure was the Musical Director of the Wicked Women concert for the Breakthrough Breast Cancer charity held at Hyde Park in London, featuring artists Ronan Keating, Big Country and Lisa Stansfield.

In 2005, he organised Live 8 concerts with Bob Geldof with the aim of pressing G8 leaders into taking action to end world poverty. Later that year he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to music and charity in the 2005 Birthday Honours. He has received five honorary degrees and was made an Honorary Doctor of Arts in 2005 by the University of Abertay Dundee for his artistic and charity work over the past 30 years. He was made a Doctor of Music by University of Edinburgh in 2006. In 2007, he received his third honorary doctorate, from the University of Paisley, for his contribution to Scottish culture and charity work. In 2008, Glasgow Caledonian University awarded him his fourth honorary doctorate, for his musical and humanitarian achievements.

Ure was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Bath in December 2010. As an ambassador for Save the Children, Ure returned to Ethiopia in 2004 and 2009 and visited Sierra Leone in 2006.

In August 2020, Ure contributed on ReMission International, Wayne Husseys re-recording of the Mission&#x27;s &quot;Tower of Strength&quot; called &quot;TOS 2020&quot;, to help COVID-19 charities around the world.

===Solo career===
In June 1982 Ure released his first solo single, a cover version of the 1968 Tom Rush song &quot;No Regrets&quot; (based on the 1975 hit cover version by the Walker Brothers), which made the UK Top 10. Ure also recorded the David Bowie track &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; for the soundtrack to the British comedy film &quot;Party Party&quot; (1983). Ure met bassist Mick Karn at the first ever Prince&#x27;s Trust concert in May 1982. Sir George Martin was the musical director and Pete Townshend of the Who was the band leader. In three days in February 1983 Ure and Karn were at AIR Studios in London and recorded the UK top 40 single &quot;After a Fashion&quot;. They also travelled to Cairo to film one of the most expensive music videos that Karn would ever be involved in.

After working on the Band Aid project and during a hiatus from Ultravox, Ure pursued a solo career in 1985. The single &quot;If I Was&quot; released in September was a UK number one single, and his debut studio album, &quot;The Gift&quot;, reached No. 2. Ure recruited Mick Ronson to play guitar on his upcoming solo tour. They rehearsed, but Ure was not satisfied with Ronson&#x27;s playing. A rehearsal live recording of &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; with Ronson&#x27;s guitar is available from 27 September 1985. Zal Cleminson took over in the five-piece band, alongside Craig Armstrong on keyboards and Kenny Hyslop on drums. After returning to Ultravox for what would be their last studio album together until their 2012 reunion album, the band effectively disbanded in 1987 and Ure concentrated solely on his solo career but with less commercial success.

The second studio album, &quot;Answers to Nothing&quot; (1988), reached the UK top 30. It featured a duet with Kate Bush called &quot;Sister and Brother&quot;, and the single &quot;Dear God&quot;, which helped Ure gain his first foothold with American audiences. It reached No. 6 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart and at No. 4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Music chart. The following year Ure toured in the US with Howard Jones.

A change of label to Arista-BMG for his third solo studio album &quot;Pure&quot; (1991) saw him back in the UK Top 40. It contained the single &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; which reached UK Top 20, and &quot;I See Hope in the Morning Light&quot;, a song written about the possible release of Nelson Mandela and recorded as a celebration. 11 November 1991, Ure played at the Royal Albert Hall, with a five-piece band featuring drummer Mark Brzezicki, keyboardist Josh Phillips, bass player Jeremy Meehan, and multi-instrumentalists Steven A. Williams and Willie Dowling. From 22 March to 22 April 1992 Ure toured in the US with four songwriters, Don Henry, Chip Taylor, Darden Smith and Rosie Flores. The tour was called &quot;In Their Own Words&quot;.

&quot;If I Was&quot;, a retrospective compilation album of solo and Ultravox hits, was released in February 1993 by Chrysalis. It went as high as number 10 in the UK album chart. To support the release he went on a tour in the UK called &quot;Out Alone&quot; which saw Ure performing on his own, accompanying himself primarily on just an acoustic guitar and a keyboard. Ure also made an appearance at the prestigious Oxford University Union Debating Society.

His fourth solo studio album, &quot;Breathe&quot; (1996), was produced by Richard Feldman. This album had a very Celtic feel with a plethora of acoustic instruments from Uilleann pipes to mandolins and accordions. Ure said in an interview 2001: &quot;My lowest point was when my album &quot;Breathe&quot; came out. I spent two years writing and recording it to find that people weren&#x27;t taking any notice. As a result all the doors that were normally open to me such as television, had closed.&quot; In 1996 the new &quot;Breathe&quot; album was followed by further extensive touring, including dates in the US as special guest to the Chieftains.

In 1998 the single &quot;Breathe&quot; became a hit-single, in several European countries boosted by its use in a Swatch TV ad campaign, two years after its original release. It entered at No. 1 on both the Italian and the Austrian charts. In 1998 Ure played on a European tour with Troy Donockley, and he also recorded the soundtrack to two American films that year, both directed by Richard Schenkman, &quot;October 22&quot;, and &quot;Went to Coney Island on a Mission from God... Be Back by Five&quot;.

Ure&#x27;s fifth solo studio album, &quot;Move Me&quot;, was first released September 2000, on Arista label in Germany, later to be released 2001 in the UK on Curb Records. 28 March 2001 Ure was the subject of the &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; TV show hosted by Michael Aspel on BBC. The same year Ure also released &quot;Little Orphans&quot; exclusively from his website. A compilation of previously unreleased recordings. It contained &quot;Feel So Good&quot; with Gordon Giltrap, &quot;Heart&quot; with Chip Taylor, &quot;Personal Heaven&quot; with Glenn Gregory of Heaven 17 and two songs recorded with Mick Karn, Steve Jansen and Richard Barbieri of Japan.

In November 2004 Ure released his autobiography, &quot;If I Was&quot;, through Virgin Books.

In September 2008 &quot;10&quot; was released. The album contains Ure&#x27;s own interpretations of 10 songs that influenced him and shaped his songwriting. It was recorded in a log cabin in Eastern Canada, near Montreal, during the long snow bound winter of 2007–2008.

Ure worked for over a decade on the next solo studio album, &quot;Fragile&quot;, which was released on 7 July 2014. The making of &quot;Fragile&quot; coincided with Ultravox&#x27;s 2012 reunion album &quot;Brilliant&quot;. Reuniting with Ultravox inspired him to focus on music again, and ultimately finish the material that would become &quot;Fragile&quot;. The album featured the song &quot;Dark, Dark Night&quot;, a collaboration with Moby.

In August 2014, Ure also returned to the US with the Retro Futura Tour, featuring Howard Jones, Tom Bailey of Thompson Twins, China Crisis and Katrina Leskanich of Katrina and the Waves.

In 2015, Ure&#x27;s recording of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was featured in the video game &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;.

On 1 December 2017, the &quot;Orchestrated&quot; album was released. It features orchestrated re-recordings of Ultravox and solo career songs arranged by the British composer Ty Unwin, and a new written track called &quot;Ordinary Man&quot;.
Ure returned to North America in the summer of 2018 on a co-headline tour with Paul Young, called &quot;The Soundtrack of Your Life Tour&quot;.

In 2019 Ure continued to tour with the Band Electronica (Russell Field, Cole Stacey, Joseph O&#x27;Keefe) with &quot;The 1980 Tour&quot;, during which they performed Ultravox&#x27;s album &quot;Vienna&quot; (1980) in full and also included highlights from Visage&#x27;s self-titled debut studio album. On 27 September 2019, Chrysalis Records released &quot;Soundtrack 1978-2019&quot;, a 32-song collection, encompassing four decades of Ure&#x27;s rich and varied career.

In August 2020, Ure was creating his &quot;Backstage Lockdown Club&quot; with livestreamed acoustic songs and Q&amp;A sessions, to members on the Patreon website. Ure also invited other artists, including Mark King of Level 42, Glenn Gregory, Howard Jones, Nik Kershaw, Gary Kemp, and Clare Grogan of Altered Images.

From 4 January 2021 Ure was hosting on Scala Radio, on their show The Space. 8 October 2021 Ure released the single &quot;Das Beat&quot; with Band Electronica. The project came about when Ure was performing in Düsseldorf in 2020. Wolfgang Flür of Kraftwerk was in the audience and later asked Ure to join a new project he was working on. A few days later, with thoughts of Flür&#x27;s electronic drumming, the role Düsseldorf has played in the scene, Ure wrote &quot;Das Beat&quot;. Whilst Flür went on to record his own version of the song for his album &quot;Magazine 1&quot; released in 2022, Ure laid down &quot;Das Beat&quot; with Band Electronica in its original form.

Following the 2019&#x27;s &#x27;The 1980 Tour&#x27;, Ure and the Band Electronica returned in 2022 with the &#x27;Voice &amp; Visions&#x27; tour in Europe, celebrating 40 years since the release of Ultravox studio albums &quot;Rage in Eden&quot; (1981) and &quot;Quartet&quot; (1982).

The much delayed UK leg of the &#x27;Voice &amp; Visions&#x27; tour began at Sheffield City Hall in April 2023, and was scheduled to play at 28 venues before concluding in Swindon at the end of May.

To mark his 70th birthday, Midge Ure headlined a one-night-only concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 4 October 2023, subtitled &#x27;Celebrating 7 Decades: A Life In Music&#x27;. The concert was recorded and released as the live album &#x27;Live at The Royal Albert Hall 04.10.23&#x27; on 8 November 2024

==Personal life==
Midge Ure lives near Bath with his wife, actress and yoga teacher Sheridan Forbes, whom he married in 2003. They have three daughters.

He was first married to television presenter, actress and novelist Annabel Giles in 1985. They divorced in 1989, and had one daughter, Molly Lorenne, who was frontwoman and lead guitarist in The Faders from 2004 to 2006. Giles died on 20 November 2023 from a brain tumour.

Ure appeared on the 2007 &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; series, winning his heat and progressing to the final on 15 June, alongside Nadia Sawalha and Craig Revel Horwood.

Ure has been a recovering alcoholic since 2005, something he discusses openly and has written about in his 2004 autobiography &quot;If I Was,&quot; the name of his 1985 hit single.

<text>Caroline Webster &quot;Lina&quot; Schermerhorn Astor (September 22, 1830 – October 30, 1908) was an American socialite who led the Four Hundred, high society of New York City in the Gilded Age. Referred to later in life as &quot;the Mrs. Astor&quot; or simply &quot;Mrs. Astor&quot;, she was the wife of yachtsman William Backhouse Astor Jr. They had five children, including Colonel John Jacob Astor IV, who perished on the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. Through her marriage, she was a member of the Astor family and matriarch of the American Astors.

==Early life==
Caroline Webster Schermerhorn, called &quot;Lina&quot;, was born on September 22, 1830, into a wealthy family who were part of New York City&#x27;s Dutch aristocracy, descendants of the city&#x27;s original settlers. Her father, Abraham Schermerhorn (1783–1850), and the extended Schermerhorn family were engaged in shipping. At the time of Lina&#x27;s birth, Abraham was worth half a million dollars (equivalent to $ million in ). Her mother was Helen Van Cortlandt (née White) Schermerhorn (1792–1881). Lina was the couple&#x27;s ninth child. Her older sister Elizabeth married General James I. Jones, who owned a vast farm in upper Manhattan called Jones&#x27;s Wood.

Her maternal grandparents were Henry White and Anne (née Van Cortlandt) White while her paternal grandparents were Peter Schermerhorn and Elizabeth (née Bussing) Schermerhorn. Among her extended Schermerhorn family was first cousin, William Colford Schermerhorn, the father of Annie Schermerhorn Kane, wife of John Innes Kane (a great-grandson of John Jacob Astor).

At the time of her birth, her family lived at 1 Greenwich Street, near the Bowling Green, but the population growth and increasing urbanization of lower Manhattan in the 1830s led her family to move farther north to 36 Bond Street, near the ultra-fashionable &quot;Lafayette Place,&quot; which had been developed by her future husband&#x27;s paternal grandfather, fur-trader John Jacob Astor.

Young Lina was educated at a school run by Mrs. Bensee, a French emigrée. There, she learned to speak French fluently.

==Marriage and family==


On September 23, 1853, she married William Backhouse Astor Jr. (1829–1892) at Trinity Church. Her husband was the middle son of real estate businessman William Backhouse Astor Sr. and Margaret Alida Rebecca Armstrong. His paternal grandfather was John Jacob Astor and his maternal grandparents were Senator John Armstrong Jr. and Alida (née Livingston) Armstrong, daughter of Robert Livingston of the Livingston family.

Her husband&#x27;s family, the Astors, had made a fortune initially through the fur trade, and later through investing in New York City real estate. Despite the wealth of the Astor family, Lina had the superior pedigree as a member of an old Knickerbocker (original 1600s Dutch settlers of Manhattan) family.

Together, they had five children:
* Emily Astor (1854–1881), who married James John Van Alen (1848–1923), a sportsman/politician, and had three children.
* Helen Schermerhorn Astor (1855–1893), who married James Roosevelt &quot;Rosy&quot; Roosevelt (1854–1927), a diplomat and the elder half-brother of future President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and had two children.
* Charlotte Augusta Astor (1858–1920), who married James Coleman Drayton and had four children. She later married George Ogilvy Haig.
* Caroline Schermerhorn &quot;Carrie&quot; Astor (1861–1948), who married Marshall Orme Wilson, the brother of banker Richard Thornton Wilson, Jr. and socialite Grace Graham Wilson, in 1884 and had two sons.
* John Jacob &quot;Jack&quot; Astor IV (1864–1912), who married Ava Lowle Willing (1868–1958), a socialite, and had two children, later married socialite Madeleine Talmage Force (1893–1940), sister of real estate businesswoman/socialite Katherine Emmons Force, and had one son, born after John Jacob Astor IV died in the &quot;Titanic&quot; sinking.

==Socialite==
Although popularly imagined as wholly preoccupied with &quot;high society&quot;, for the first several decades of her married life, Lina Astor was principally occupied with raising her five children and running her household, as was typical of women of her class in mid-19th-century New York City. Due to an inheritance from her parents, Lina had her own money, thus she was far less dependent on her husband than most American women of the time.

In 1862, she and her husband built a four-bay townhouse in the newly fashionable brownstone style at 350 Fifth Avenue, the present site of the Empire State Building. The home was next door to her husband&#x27;s elder brother, John Jacob Astor III; the two families were next-door neighbors for 28 years, although the Astor brothers&#x27; wives did not get along. The Astors also maintained a grand &quot;summer cottage&quot; in Newport, Rhode Island, called Beechwood, which had a ballroom large enough to fit &quot;The 400&quot; – the most fashionable New York socialites of the day. It also neighbored his brother&#x27;s family, who lived at Beaulieu.

===The Gatekeeper===

In the decades following the Civil War the population of New York City grew almost exponentially, and immigrants and wealthy &quot;arrivistes&quot; from the Midwest began challenging the dominance of the old New York Establishment. Aided by the social arbiter Ward McAllister, whose first cousin, Samuel Cutler Ward, had married into the Astor family, Lina attempted to codify proper behavior and etiquette, as well as determine who was acceptable among the &quot;arrivistes&quot; for an increasingly heterogeneous city. They were the champions of old money and tradition.

McAllister once stated that, amongst the vastly rich families of Gilded Age New York, there were only 400 people who could be counted as members of Fashionable Society. He did not, as is commonly written, arrive at this number based on the limitations of Mrs. Astor&#x27;s New York City ballroom. (McAllister referred to her as the &quot;Mystic Rose.&quot;) Her husband&#x27;s lack of interest in the social whirl did not stop but instead fueled her burgeoning social activities, which increased in intensity as her children grew older.

Lina was the foremost authority on the &quot;Aristocracy&quot; of New York in the late nineteenth century. She held ornate and elaborate parties for herself and other members of the elite New York socialite crowd. None was permitted to attend these gatherings without an official calling card from her. Lina&#x27;s social groups were dominated by strong-willed &quot;aristocratic&quot; women. These social gatherings were dependent on overly conspicuous luxury and publicity. More so than the gatherings themselves, importance was highly placed upon the group as the upper-crust of New York&#x27;s elite. She and her ladies therefore represented the &quot;Aristocratic,&quot; or the Old Money, whereas the newly wealthy Vanderbilt family would establish a new wave of New Money.

===Relationship with the Vanderbilts===

The Vanderbilts, as members of socialite New York through the copious amounts of money that the family had earned rather than inherited, represented a type of wealth that was abhorrent to Astor and her group. Lina Astor found railroad money distasteful. For this reason, she was reluctant to call upon the Vanderbilt girls. In 1883, however, Astor was forced to formally acknowledge the wealthy socialite Alva Erskine Smith, first wife of horse breeder/railroad manager William Kissam Vanderbilt, thereby providing the Vanderbilts, the greatest &quot;new&quot; fortune in New York, entrance into the highest rungs of society.

An oft-repeated New York legend has it that Alva Vanderbilt had planned an elaborate costume ball for her housewarming, with entertainments given by young society figures, but at the last minute notified young Caroline Astor (Lina&#x27;s youngest daughter) that she could not participate, because Astor had never formally called on Vanderbilt. Also likely, Astor had noted the rising social profile of the Vanderbilt family, led by Alva and Willie and, viewing them as useful allies in her efforts to keep New York society exclusive, had called formally on the Vanderbilts prior to Alva&#x27;s lavish ball which Astor herself attended. The Vanderbilts were subsequently invited to Astor&#x27;s annual ball, a formal acknowledgement of their full acceptance into the upper echelon of New York society.

===Use of &quot;Mrs. Astor&quot;===
Until 1887, Lina Astor had been formally known as &quot;Mrs. William Astor&quot;, but with Charlotte Augusta Gibbes&#x27;s death that year, she shortened her formal title to &quot;Mrs. Astor&quot;, as she was then the senior Mrs. Astor, the only remaining one in her generation. Charlotte&#x27;s son, William Waldorf Astor, felt that his own wife, Mary &quot;Mamie&quot; Dahlgren Paul, should be &quot;the Mrs. Astor.&quot; With the death of John Jacob Astor III in 1890, William Waldorf Astor had inherited his father&#x27;s share of the Astor holdings and, titularly, became the head of the Astor family. In his mind, this made Mamie &quot;the Mrs. Astor.&quot; However, Mamie was eighteen years younger than Lina and lacked Lina&#x27;s social power.
His further attempts at challenging Lina&#x27;s preeminence in New York society, however, were thwarted, and he soon moved with his family to England, where he later became a viscount.

In retaliation for his aunt&#x27;s intransigence, William Waldorf Astor had his father&#x27;s house torn down and replaced by the first Waldorf Hotel. The hotel was specifically designed to overshadow Mrs. Astor&#x27;s mansion, which was right next door, in an attempt to overshadow her status with it. The Waldorf Hotel was thirteen stories tall and was built in the form of a German Renaissance chateau: it thus not only overshadowed Lina, but all other structures in the neighborhood as well. Mrs. Astor famously stated about the hotel, &quot;There&#x27;s a glorified tavern next door.&quot;

Until the opulence of the Waldorf Hotel revolutionized how New York socialized publicly, polite society did not gather in public places, especially hotels. Unwilling to live next door to New York&#x27;s latest sensation and public draw, Mrs. Astor and her son, Jack, first contemplated tearing down her house and replacing it with livery stables. Eventually she and Jack tore down their house and erected another hotel at its site, the Astoria, and soon the two hotels merged and became the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Astor consequently built a double mansion, one of the largest ever built in New York, for her and her son, with Mrs. Astor occupying the northern residence, 841 Fifth Avenue and her son occupying the southern half, 840 Fifth Avenue.

The Astors&#x27; Fifth Avenue home and the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel were both eventually torn down in 1927 and 1928 to make way for Temple Emanu-El and the Empire State Building, respectively.

==Death==
By the time she moved into her new house facing Central Park, at the corner of 65th Street, Mrs. Astor&#x27;s husband had died, and she lived with her son and his family. Spending her last several years suffering from periodic dementia, she died at age 78 on October 30, 1908, and was interred in the Trinity Church Cemetery in upper Manhattan.

Her youngest daughter, Carrie, erected a commemorative 39-foot-tall (11.9 m) cenotaph in her memory, in addition to her uptown burial plot. The inscription is dated A.D. MCMXIV and the cenotaph is located within the small churchyard cemetery at the intersection of Broadway and Wall Street, in which many prominent early Americans are buried.

Following Mrs. Astor&#x27;s death, it reportedly took three women to fill her role in New York Society: Marion Graves Anthon Fish, the wife of Stuyvesant Fish, Theresa Fair Oelrichs, the wife of Hermann Oelrichs, and Alva Belmont, by then the wife of Oliver Belmont.

Mrs. Astor has been portrayed by Donna Murphy in the HBO drama &quot;The Gilded Age&quot;.

<doc id="329893" wikidata="Q166120" url="?curid=329893" title="Black Rebel Motorcycle Club">
<text>Black Rebel Motorcycle Club (sometimes abbreviated to BRMC) is an American rock band from San Francisco, California. The group originally consisted of Peter Hayes (vocals, guitar, harmonica), Robert Levon Been (vocals, bass, guitar), and Nick Jago (drums). Jago departed the band in 2008 and was replaced by Leah Shapiro.

They have released eight studio albums: &quot;B.R.M.C.&quot; (2001), &quot;Take Them On, On Your Own&quot; (2003), &quot;Howl&quot; (2005), &quot;Baby 81&quot; (2007), &quot;The Effects of 333&quot; (2008), &quot;Beat the Devil&#x27;s Tattoo&quot; (2010), &quot;Specter at the Feast&quot; (2013) and &quot;Wrong Creatures&quot; (2018), as well as several EPs, and live albums.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1998–1999)===
The band was formed in 1998, originally called The Elements. After discovering that another band had the same name, the members changed the name to Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, after Marlon Brando&#x27;s motorcycle club in the 1953 film &quot;The Wild One&quot;.

Bassist Robert Levon Been and guitarist Peter Hayes met at high school in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Lafayette and formed a band, Hayes having recently left The Brian Jonestown Massacre. Been has said in interviews that Hayes had a turbulent home life and would park and sleep in his car outside the Been household. After about a year of doing this, Been and his father Michael persuaded Hayes to live with them. Later, the pair started looking for a drummer. They met Nick Jago, from Devon, England, who had moved to California to be with his parents after spending some time at Winchester School of Art, where he was studying fine art. The vocals are shared between Been and Peter Hayes.

===&quot;B.R.M.C.&quot; and &quot;Take Them On, On Your Own&quot; (2000–2003)===
The band&#x27;s first two records &quot;B.R.M.C.&quot; (2001) and &quot;Take Them On, On Your Own&quot; (2003) were indebted to classic hard rock influenced by Led Zeppelin and also encompassed slower-paced psychedelic rock, space rock, and noise pop influences from bands such as The Verve, Loop, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Their second album (recorded with producer Rik Simpson) has several songs such as &quot;Generation&quot; and &quot;US Government&quot; that are critical of the United States government.

Been used the pseudonym &#x27;Robert Turner&#x27; on the first two records, in an attempt not to be linked to his father (Michael Been of The Call). He later dropped this identity when promoting &quot;Howl&quot;. The senior Been later toured with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club as part of their sound crew.

In 2003, a concert in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, had to be cancelled halfway through the set, after Leeds City Council officials suspected the 150-year-old floor of Leeds Town Hall might collapse. This led to the band sometimes being referred to as &#x27;the band who broke the floor&#x27;. Problems with drummer Nick Jago began surfacing publicly at the 2003 NME Awards, when Jago remained on stage for nine minutes, completely silent, while accepting an award.

===&quot;Howl&quot; (2004–2006)===
After conflict with their record label, the band was dropped by Virgin Records in 2004. Jago&#x27;s conflicts came to a head in Scotland, when Jago and Hayes came to blows after a tense gig. Before long, Jago quit. As such, Jago did not take part in the sessions for the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Howl&quot;. Instead, he went through various rehab attempts, eventually rejoining the band in time to record one track, the ballad &quot;Promise&quot;.

In 2005, the band signed to Echo in the UK, and RCA in the U.S. &quot;Howl&quot; was released to mostly favorable reviews. &quot;Howl&quot; had a stripped-down folk style, a departure from the earlier B.R.M.C. sound. Several of the songs on &quot;Howl&quot; are said to have been written long before the idea of B.R.M.C. was conceived. On tour for this album the band also employed a temporary fourth member, guitarist Spike Keating.

===&quot;Baby 81&quot; and &quot;The Effects of 333&quot; (2007–2009)===
By 2007, Nick Jago had rejoined BRMC. The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Baby 81&quot;, was released on April 30, 2007, in the UK and Europe and May 1, 2007, in the U.S.

On June 6, 2007, BRMC performed in a concert that was streamed live on the internet via MSN Music.

In June 2008, Jago once again left BRMC&#x27;s touring line-up, being replaced by The Raveonettes&#x27; touring drummer Leah Shapiro. Jago stated he &quot;took it as I am fired again and to be honest with you I respect their decision&quot;. However, Hayes and Been issued a statement reading: &quot;Nick won&#x27;t be joining us for the upcoming European tour, but it&#x27;s not true that he is fired. We just feel Nick needs time to sort out exactly what he wants right now. His heart and all his energy and attention is on his own solo project and he needs to see that through.&quot; However, in October 2015 Robert admitted that &quot;We were ready to be an international band that never toured the States again. Thank God, we got his (Jago) visa back and we were able to play together again until we fired him, but that&#x27;s a whole other story when things got even darker&quot;.

On October 27, 2008, the band announced via a MySpace bulletin that they would release their newest album independently. The album would be their first release through their own &quot;Abstract Dragon&quot; label. The album, titled, &quot;The Effects of 333&quot; is instrumental and was made available as a digital download through their music store on 3:33 A.M Pacific Time on November 1, 2008.

On November 10, 2009, BRMC released a live DVD through Vagrant Records. It was recorded in Glasgow, Berlin, and Dublin during the Baby 81 world tour.

===&quot;Beat the Devil&#x27;s Tattoo&quot; (2010–2011)===
A song by BRMC, &quot;Done All Wrong&quot;, appeared on the soundtrack to the 2009 film &quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon&quot;.

BRMC&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Beat the Devil&#x27;s Tattoo&quot; was released March 8, 2010 in the UK and Europe and March 9, 2010, in North America. The band went on a world tour that lasted from February to December.

On August 19, 2010, after the band&#x27;s performance at the Pukkelpop Festival in Belgium, Robert&#x27;s father Michael Been died backstage of a heart attack.

On November 1, 2010, the band released their second live DVD, called &quot;Live in London&quot;, on their own website and at HMV stores in the UK. The DVD would also be for sale at the band&#x27;s headlining shows throughout the tour. It was filmed in front of a sold-out London Forum on April 23, the same year. This is the last project Michael Been has worked on with the band, mixing it.

In 2011 the band started working on their 7th album, which was released in 2013. In between the recording sessions the band performed a South American tour and played their first shows in South Africa, as part of the Synergy Festival in Cape Town and China, in Beijing and Shanghai.

The band went on a brief successful three-show tour of small clubs in California to promote the album. These shows were at Slim&#x27;s in San Francisco, The Catalyst in Santa Cruz, and The Troubador of Los Angeles on the December 19, 20 and 21, respectively. All three shows sold out and BRMC played to packed houses each night where the setlist ranged from classics to quite a bit of new material.

===&quot;Specter at the Feast&quot; (2013–2016)===
After the success of these first shows, the band announced several more shows across Europe with stops in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy among other countries. The last announced show was at the Austin Psych Fest on April 26, 2013.

On January 9, 2013, the band announced via Facebook the name of their seventh album called &quot;Specter at the Feast&quot; which was released on March 18 in the UK and Europe and on March 19 in U.S., Canada and worldwide.

It received mostly positive reviews; many critics noting that despite the band having been together for some time the album showed a mellower and moodier side with songs such as opener &quot;Firewalker&quot;.

The band made the first single from the record available, a cover of The Call&#x27;s 1989 hit &quot;Let the Day Begin&quot;, as a free download on their website. The decision to record the song was a tribute to Robert&#x27;s father Michael, who used his experience from The Call to help BRMC in the last couple of years before his death. The single became &quot;Q&quot; Magazine&#x27;s track of the day. The same song also reached a worldwide audience when BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; used it for its 21st season trailer both on the live TV show and online. The band have also released the &quot;Let the Day Begin&quot; EP free, the EP consists of the single and the album track &quot;Returning&quot;, made available for streaming on the official website.

The band continued to show a willingness to tour despite obstacles. During the 2013 tour, the organisers of the Harvest festival in Australia decided to abandon the multi-city event, of which BRMC were one of the lead acts, only a few months ahead of the performances. BRMC was the first band to announce it would still visit the country and play its own shows. Several sold out.

On October 2, 2014, the band announced they were in the studio mixing the audio for a forthcoming live album and DVD recorded in Paris during the Specter at the Feast tour.

===&quot;Wrong Creatures&quot; (2017–present)===

In May 2017, the band confirmed they were working on a new studio album to be released in the fall of 2017. On September 12, 2017, they announced the album, &quot;Wrong Creatures&quot;, would be released on January 12, 2018. The announcement was accompanied by the release of the first track, &quot;Little Thing Gone Wild&quot;.

<doc id="329898" wikidata="Q1192209" url="?curid=329898" title="Stationary process">
<text>In mathematics and statistics, a stationary process (also called a strict/strictly stationary process or strong/strongly stationary process) is a stochastic process whose statistical properties, such as mean and variance, do not change over time. More formally, the joint probability distribution of the process remains the same when shifted in time. This implies that the process is statistically consistent across different time periods. Because many statistical procedures in time series analysis assume stationarity, non-stationary data are frequently transformed to achieve stationarity before analysis.

A common cause of non-stationarity is a trend in the mean, which can be due to either a unit root or a deterministic trend. In the case of a unit root, stochastic shocks have permanent effects, and the process is not mean-reverting. With a deterministic trend, the process is called trend-stationary, and shocks have only transitory effects, with the variable tending towards a deterministically evolving mean. A trend-stationary process is not strictly stationary but can be made stationary by removing the trend. Similarly, processes with unit roots can be made stationary through differencing.

Another type of non-stationary process, distinct from those with trends, is a cyclostationary process, which exhibits cyclical variations over time.

Strict stationarity, as defined above, can be too restrictive for many applications. Therefore, other forms of stationarity, such as wide-sense stationarity or &quot;N&quot;-th-order stationarity, are often used. The definitions for different kinds of stationarity are not consistent among different authors (see Other terminology).

==Strict-sense stationarity==
===Definition===

Formally, let formula_1 be a stochastic process and let formula_2 represent the cumulative distribution function of the unconditional (i.e., with no reference to any particular starting value) joint distribution of formula_1 at times formula_4. Then, formula_1 is said to be strictly stationary, strongly stationary or strict-sense stationary if

Since formula_6 does not affect formula_7, formula_8 is independent of time.

===Examples===

White noise is the simplest example of a stationary process.

An example of a discrete-time stationary process where the sample space is also discrete (so that the random variable may take one of &quot;N&quot; possible values) is a Bernoulli scheme. Other examples of a discrete-time stationary process with continuous sample space include some autoregressive and moving average processes which are both subsets of the autoregressive moving average model. Models with a non-trivial autoregressive component may be either stationary or non-stationary, depending on the parameter values, and important non-stationary special cases are where unit roots exist in the model.

====Example 1====
Let formula_9 be any scalar random variable, and define a time-series formula_1, by
:formula_11
Then formula_1 is a stationary time series, for which realisations consist of a series of constant values, with a different constant value for each realisation. A law of large numbers does not apply on this case, as the limiting value of an average from a single realisation takes the random value determined by formula_9, rather than taking the expected value of formula_9.

The time average of formula_15 does not converge since the process is not ergodic.

====Example 2====
As a further example of a stationary process for which any single realisation has an apparently noise-free structure, let formula_9 have a uniform distribution on formula_17 and define the time series formula_1 by
:formula_19
Then formula_1 is strictly stationary since (formula_21 modulo formula_22) follows the same uniform distribution as formula_23 for any formula_24.

==== Example 3 ====
Keep in mind that a weakly white noise is not necessarily strictly stationary. Let formula_25 be a random variable uniformly distributed in the interval formula_26 and define the time series formula_27

formula_28

Then 
:formula_29
So formula_30 is a white noise in the weak sense (the mean and cross-covariances are zero, and the variances are all the same), however it is not strictly stationary.
==&quot;N&quot;th-order stationarity==

In , the distribution of formula_31 samples of the stochastic process must be equal to the distribution of the samples shifted in time &quot;for all&quot; formula_31. &quot;N&quot;-th-order stationarity is a weaker form of stationarity where this is only requested for all formula_31 up to a certain order formula_34. A random process formula_1 is said to be &quot;N&quot;-th-order stationary if:

==Weak or wide-sense stationarity==
===Definition===

A weaker form of stationarity commonly employed in signal processing is known as weak-sense stationarity, wide-sense stationarity (WSS), or covariance stationarity. WSS random processes only require that 1st moment (i.e. the mean) and autocovariance do not vary with respect to time and that the 2nd moment is finite for all times. Any strictly stationary process which has a finite mean and covariance is also WSS.

So, a continuous time random process formula_1 which is WSS has the following restrictions on its mean function formula_37 and autocovariance function formula_38:

The first property implies that the mean function formula_39 must be constant. The second property implies that the autocovariance function depends only on the &quot;difference&quot; between formula_40 and formula_41 and only needs to be indexed by one variable rather than two variables. Thus, instead of writing,

:formula_42

the notation is often abbreviated by the substitution formula_43:

:formula_44

This also implies that the autocorrelation depends only on formula_43, that is

:formula_46

The third property says that the second moments must be finite for any time formula_47.

===Motivation===
The main advantage of wide-sense stationarity is that it places the time-series in the context of Hilbert spaces. Let &quot;H&quot; be the Hilbert space generated by {&quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)} (that is, the closure of the set of all linear combinations of these random variables in the Hilbert space of all square-integrable random variables on the given probability space). By the positive definiteness of the autocovariance function, it follows from Bochner&#x27;s theorem that there exists a positive measure formula_48 on the real line such that &quot;H&quot; is isomorphic to the Hilbert subspace of &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;μ&quot;) generated by {&quot;e&quot;−2&quot;iξ⋅t&quot;}. This then gives the following Fourier-type decomposition for a continuous time stationary stochastic process: there exists a stochastic process formula_49 with orthogonal increments such that, for all formula_47

:formula_51

where the integral on the right-hand side is interpreted in a suitable (Riemann) sense. The same result holds for a discrete-time stationary process, with the spectral measure now defined on the unit circle.

When processing WSS random signals with linear, time-invariant (LTI) filters, it is helpful to think of the correlation function as a linear operator. Since it is a circulant operator (depends only on the difference between the two arguments), its eigenfunctions are the Fourier complex exponentials. Additionally, since the eigenfunctions of LTI operators are also complex exponentials, LTI processing of WSS random signals is highly tractable—all computations can be performed in the frequency domain. Thus, the WSS assumption is widely employed in signal processing algorithms.

===Definition for complex stochastic process===
In the case where formula_1 is a complex stochastic process the autocovariance function is defined as formula_53 and, in addition to the requirements in , it is required that the pseudo-autocovariance function formula_54 depends only on the time lag. In formulas, formula_1 is WSS, if

==Joint stationarity==
The concept of stationarity may be extended to two stochastic processes.

===Joint strict-sense stationarity===
Two stochastic processes formula_1 and formula_57 are called jointly strict-sense stationary if their joint cumulative distribution formula_58 remains unchanged under time shifts, i.e. if

===Joint (&quot;M&quot; + &quot;N&quot;)th-order stationarity===
Two random processes formula_1 and formula_57 is said to be jointly (&quot;M&quot; + &quot;N&quot;)-th-order stationary if:

===Joint weak or wide-sense stationarity===
Two stochastic processes formula_1 and formula_57 are called jointly wide-sense stationary if they are both wide-sense stationary and their cross-covariance function formula_63 depends only on the time difference formula_43. This may be summarized as follows:

==Relation between types of stationarity==
* If a stochastic process is &quot;N&quot;-th-order stationary, then it is also &quot;M&quot;-th-order stationary for all .
* If a stochastic process is second order stationary (formula_65) and has finite second moments, then it is also wide-sense stationary.
* If a stochastic process is wide-sense stationary, it is not necessarily second-order stationary.
* If a stochastic process is strict-sense stationary and has finite second moments, it is wide-sense stationary.
* If two stochastic processes are jointly (&quot;M&quot; + &quot;N&quot;)-th-order stationary, this does not guarantee that the individual processes are &quot;M&quot;-th- respectively &quot;N&quot;-th-order stationary.

==Other terminology==
The terminology used for types of stationarity other than strict stationarity can be rather mixed. Some examples follow.
*Priestley uses stationary up to order &quot;m&quot; if conditions similar to those given here for wide sense stationarity apply relating to moments up to order &quot;m&quot;. Thus wide sense stationarity would be equivalent to &quot;stationary to order 2&quot;, which is different from the definition of second-order stationarity given here.
* Honarkhah and Caers also use the assumption of stationarity in the context of multiple-point geostatistics, where higher n-point statistics are assumed to be stationary in the spatial domain.

== Differencing ==
One way to make some time series stationary is to compute the differences between consecutive observations. This is known as differencing. Differencing can help stabilize the mean of a time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, and so eliminating trends. This can also remove seasonality, if differences are taken appropriately (e.g. differencing observations 1 year apart to remove a yearly trend).

Transformations such as logarithms can help to stabilize the variance of a time series.

One of the ways for identifying non-stationary times series is the ACF plot. Sometimes, patterns will be more visible in the ACF plot than in the original time series; however, this is not always the case. 

Another approach to identifying non-stationarity is to look at the Laplace transform of a series, which will identify both exponential trends and sinusoidal seasonality (complex exponential trends). Related techniques from signal analysis such as the wavelet transform and Fourier transform may also be helpful.

<text>The Battle of Auray took place on 29 September 1364 at the Breton-French town of Auray. This battle was the decisive confrontation of the Breton War of Succession, a part of the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

In the battle, which began as a siege, a Breton army, led by Duke John de Montfort, assisted by English forces commanded by John Chandos, opposed a Breton army led by his rival Charles of Blois and assisted by French forces led by Bertrand du Guesclin.

==Prelude==
At the beginning of 1364, after the failure of the negotiations of Évran, Montfort, with the assistance of John Chandos, came to attack Auray, which had been in the hands of Franco-Bretons since 1342. He entered the town of Auray and besieged the castle, which was blockaded by sea by the ships of Nicolas Bouchart coming from Le Croisic.

Without food supplies, the besieged agreed to surrender the place, if help did not arrive before Michaelmas (29 September). Two days before, Charles of Blois had arrived east of the abbey of Lanvaux. Bertrand du Guesclin, who commanded the vanguard of the French troops, was in nearby Brandivy.

On 28 September, du Guesclin landed on the left bank of the river, and took up position before the castle. To avoid being caught between the castle and the French Army, Montfort evacuated Auray and took up a position facing the enemy, on the slope of the right bank of the river.

On the 29 September, attempts at agreement having failed, Charles of Blois prepared for the attack. His army crossed the river and lined up facing south, considered a bad position by some of his commanders because it was on a marshy plain north of the town and castle. Montfort followed the movement and lined up facing north, in a more dominating position. Rejecting the advice of du Guesclin, Charles of Blois then ordered the attack against Montfort&#x27;s forces.

== Involved forces ==

=== Franco-Breton army of Charles of Blois ===

On the left the Count of Auxerre, on the right Du Guesclin, in the center Charles of Blois. A reserve was not used. Each division had roughly 1,000 men.

=== Anglo-Breton army of John of Montfort ===

On the right Olivier de Clisson, on the left Robert Knolles, in the centre John de Montfort and John Chandos. A significant reserve, under Hugh Calveley, was also on hand ready to intervene.

== Battle ==
The battle began with a short skirmish between the French arbalesters and the English archers. The men-at-arms then engaged directly without seeking to maneuver. It was a bloody combat because all wanted the battle to be decisive to put an end to the long and cruel war. Moreover, orders were given on both sides not to give quarter to captives.

Each Anglo-Breton &quot;corps&quot; was attacked head on, one after the other, but the reserves restored the situation. The right wing of the Franco-Breton position was then counterattacked and driven back and since it was not being supported by its own reserves, it was folded up towards the centre. The left wing then folded in turn, the Count of Auxerre was captured, and the troops of Charles of Blois broke and fled. Charles, having been struck down by a lance, was finished off by an English soldier, obeying orders to show no quarter. Du Guesclin, having broken all his weapons, was obliged to surrender to the English commander Chandos. Du Guesclin was taken into custody and ransomed by Charles V for 100,000 francs.

== Consequences ==

This victory put an end to the war of succession. One year later, in 1365, under the first Treaty of Guérande, the king of France recognized John IV, the son of John of Montfort as duke of Brittany. However, John IV then paid homage to Charles V of France, rather than to his patron, Edward III of England. The Anglo-Breton military victory appeared to result in a diplomatic coup for the King of France.

<doc id="329902" wikidata="Q429049" url="?curid=329902" title="No-hitter">
<text>In baseball, a no-hitter or no-hit game is a game in which a team does not record a hit through conventional methods. Major League Baseball (MLB) officially defines a no-hitter as a completed game in which a team that batted in at least nine complete innings recorded no hits. A pitcher who prevents the opposing team from achieving a hit is thereby said to have &quot;thrown a no-hitter&quot;. In most cases, no-hitters are recorded by a single pitcher who throws a complete game; one thrown by two or more pitchers is a combined no-hitter.

A no-hitter is a rare accomplishment for a pitcher or pitching staff—only 326 have been thrown in MLB history since 1876, an average of about two per year. The most recent major league no-hitter and combined no-hitter was thrown by starter Shota Imanaga and relief pitchers Nate Pearson and Porter Hodge of the Chicago Cubs against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 4, 2024, while the most recent no-hitter by a single pitcher was thrown by Blake Snell of the San Francisco Giants against the Cincinnati Reds on August 2, 2024.

The MLB season with the most no-hit games under modern rules is 12, in 1897. The second highest season is a tie between and seasons, in which nine official no-hitters were pitched. Additionally, there were two other games pitched without giving up a hit, but were not official no-hitters because they were less than nine innings.

It is possible for a batter to reach base without a hit, most commonly by a walk, an error, or being hit by a pitch. Other possibilities include the batter reaching first after an uncaught third strike or catcher&#x27;s interference. (One other possibility is a fielder&#x27;s choice, but this requires that there already is a runner on base.) A no-hitter in which no batters reach base at all is a perfect game, a much rarer feat. Because batters can reach base by means other than a hit, a pitcher can throw a no-hitter (though not a perfect game) and still give up runs or even lose the game, although this is extremely uncommon, and most no-hitters are also shutouts. One or more runs were given up in 25 recorded no-hitters in MLB history, most recently by Ervin Santana of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in a 3–1 win against the Cleveland Indians on July 27, 2011. On two occasions, a team has thrown a nine-inning no-hitter and still lost the game. It is theoretically possible for opposing pitchers to throw no-hitters in the same game, although this has never happened in the major leagues. Two pitchers, Fred Toney and Hippo Vaughn, completed nine innings of a game on May 2, 1917, without either giving up a hit or a run; Vaughn gave up two hits and a run in the 10th inning, losing the game to Toney, who completed the extra-inning no-hitter.

==MLB no-hitters==
===Definition===
A no-hitter is defined by MLB: &quot;An official no-hit game occurs when a pitcher (or pitchers) allows no hits during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings.&quot; This 1991 definition by MLB&#x27;s Committee for Statistical Accuracy caused previously recognized no-hitters of fewer than nine innings or where the first hit had been allowed in extra innings to be stricken from the official record books. Games lost by the visiting team in innings but without allowing any hits do not qualify as no-hitters, as the visiting team has only pitched eight innings.

===Frequency===
MLB has recognized 326 no-hitters thrown since 1876, 24 of which were perfect games. Two no-hitters have been thrown on the same day twice: Ted Breitenstein and Jim Hughes on April 22, 1898; and Dave Stewart and Fernando Valenzuela on June 29, 1990.

Nine no-hitters were thrown in the 2021 season. The previous record was eight, set in 1884. The previous modern era record (since 1901) was seven, accomplished in 1990, 1991, 2012, and 2015.

The longest period between two no-hitters in the modern era is three years and 44 days, between Bobby Burke on August 8, 1931, and Paul &quot;Daffy&quot; Dean on September 21, 1934. There was a drought of three years and 11 months without a no-hitter between the first National League no-hitter on July 15, 1876 pitched by George Bradley and the first National League perfect game on June 12, 1880, pitched by Lee Richmond. The most recent year without any no-hitters is 2005.

The greatest span of games without a no-hitter in the major leagues is 6,364, between Randy Johnson&#x27;s perfect game on May 18, 2004, for the Arizona Diamondbacks, and Aníbal Sánchez&#x27;s no-hitter on September 6, 2006, for the Florida Marlins. The previous record was a 4,015-game streak without a no-hitter between Mike Witt&#x27;s perfect game on September 30, 1984 for the California Angels and Mike Scott&#x27;s no-hitter on September 25, 1986 for the Houston Astros.

====Individual====

The pitcher who holds the record for the most no-hitters is Nolan Ryan, who threw seven in his 27-year career. His first two came exactly two months apart with the California Angels: the first on May 15, 1973, and the second on July 15. He had two more with the Angels on September 28, 1974, and June 1, 1975. Ryan&#x27;s fifth no-hitter with the Houston Astros on September 26, 1981, broke Sandy Koufax&#x27;s previous record. His sixth and seventh no-hitters came with the Texas Rangers on June 1, 1990, and May 1, 1991. When he tossed number seven at age 44, he became the oldest pitcher to throw a no-hitter.

Only Ryan, Koufax (four), Cy Young (three), Bob Feller (three), Larry Corcoran (three), and Justin Verlander (three) have pitched more than two no-hitters. Corcoran was the first pitcher to throw a second no-hitter in a career (in 1882), as well as the first to throw a third (in 1884).

Thirty-six pitchers have thrown more than one no-hitter, combined no-hitters not counting. Nolan Ryan has the longest gap between no-hitters: he threw his first as a member of the Los Angeles Angels on May 15, 1973, and his last as a Texas Ranger on May 1, 1991.

The pitcher who holds the record for the shortest time between no-hitters is Johnny Vander Meer, the only pitcher in history to throw no-hitters in consecutive starts, while playing for the Cincinnati Reds in 1938. Besides Vander Meer, Allie Reynolds (in 1951), Virgil Trucks (in 1952), Ryan (in 1973), and Max Scherzer (in 2015) were the only major leaguers to throw two no-hitters during the same regular season.

Jim Maloney also had two no-hitters under the old rules in the 1965 season, both of them taking extra innings. In the first one on June 14, he gave up a home run to Johnny Lewis to open the top of the 11th inning, turning 10 innings of no-hit ball into a 1–0 loss to the New York Mets. According to the rules at the time, this was considered a no-hitter. On August 19, a home run by Leo Cárdenas in the tenth inning allowed Maloney to earn a 1–0 10-inning no-hit win over the Chicago Cubs.

Roy Halladay threw two no-hitters in 2010 – a perfect game during the regular season and a no-hitter in the 2010 National League Division Series. He is the only major leaguer to have thrown no-hitters in regular season and postseason play.
Two pitchers missing their non-pitching hand have thrown no-hitters; Hugh Daily, of the Cleveland Blues, defeated the Philadelphia Quakers 1–0 on September 13, 1883, and Jim Abbott, of the New York Yankees, defeated the Cleveland Indians 4–0 on September 4, 1993. Daily lost his left hand in a gun accident as a child, and Abbott was born without a right hand.

The record for most no-hitters caught by a catcher is four, a record shared by Boston Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek and Philadelphia Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz. Varitek caught no-hitters for Hideo Nomo, Derek Lowe, Clay Buchholz, and Jon Lester. Varitek also caught a rain-shortened, five-inning unofficial no-hitter for Devern Hansack on October 1, 2006. Ruiz caught two no-hitters for Roy Halladay, including a perfect game, as well as one for Cole Hamels, and a combined no-hitter for Cole Hamels, Jake Diekman, Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon. Before MLB redefined &quot;no-hitter&quot;, Ray Schalk had long held the record of catching four no-hitters, but his first nine-inning no-hitter had ended with a hit in the tenth inning. Victor Caratini is the only player to catch consecutive no-hitters with two different teams, and the tenth to catch consecutive no-hitters at all. the first came on September 13, 2020, with the Chicago Cubs, and the second on April 9, 2021, with the San Diego Padres.

The record for most modern-day no-hitters participated in belongs to Jose Altuve of the Houston Astros. (Mike Fiers, Justin Verlander, Framber Valdez, Ronel Blanco, and the three combined no-hitters combined with Matt Cain&#x27;s Perfect Game).

Five pitchers have thrown a no-hitter in both the American League and the National League: Cy Young, Ryan, Jim Bunning, Nomo, and Randy Johnson. Only five catchers have caught a no-hitter in each league: Gus Triandos, Jeff Torborg, Darrell Porter, Ron Hassey, and most recently, Drew Butera. Triandos caught Hoyt Wilhelm&#x27;s 1958 no-hitter and Jim Bunning&#x27;s perfect game, Torborg caught Koufax&#x27;s perfect game and Ryan&#x27;s first no-hitter, Porter caught Jim Colborn&#x27;s 1977 no-hitter and Bob Forsch&#x27;s second no-hitter in 1983, and Hassey caught Len Barker&#x27;s and Dennis Martínez&#x27;s perfect games. Butera caught a 2011 no-hitter by Francisco Liriano and a 2014 no-hitter by Josh Beckett.

====Team====
No team has thrown no-hitters in consecutive games, although it has happened once on consecutive &quot;days&quot;: On May 5, 1917, Ernie Koob of the St. Louis Browns no-hit the Chicago White Sox, and teammate Bob Groom repeated the feat in the second game of a doubleheader the following day.

On two occasions, there have been back-to-back no-hitters thrown by each team in a series. On September 17, 1968, Gaylord Perry of the San Francisco Giants no-hit the St. Louis Cardinals, and the Cardinals&#x27; Ray Washburn no-hit the Giants the following day. On April 30, 1969, Jim Maloney of the Cincinnati Reds no-hit the Houston Astros, and the Astros&#x27; Don Wilson no-hit the Reds the following day. Surprisingly, it was both Maloney&#x27;s and Wilson&#x27;s second no-hitter in their careers.

Teams have thrown two straight no-hitters, with no other teams pitching one in the interim, 20 times; most recently by the Houston Astros (a combined no-hitter using four pitchers during Game 4 of the 2022 World Series and a combined no-hitter using 3 pitchers during the 2022 regular season). The only team to throw three straight no-hitters was the Milwaukee Braves, with Lew Burdette, followed by consecutive no-no&#x27;s by Warren Spahn, in 1960 and 1961. Individual pitchers have thrown two straight no-hitters seven times: Addie Joss 1908 and 1910; Vander Meer in 1938; Allie Reynolds in 1951; Warren Spahn in 1960 and 1961; Ryan twice, first in 1973, then in 1974 and 1975; and Homer Bailey in 2012 and 2013. All seven instances were with the same team.

The Cleveland Guardians are the only team to be no-hit three times in a single season, doing so in 2021. They were no-hit by Carlos Rodón of the Chicago White Sox on April 14, 2021. They then failed to record a hit against the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; Wade Miley on May 7, 2021. Finally, they were held hitless by Corbin Burnes and Josh Hader of the Milwaukee Brewers on September 11, 2021. Remarkably, Zach Plesac was the Guardians&#x27; pitcher for all three no-hitters. In addition to these official no-hitters, the Guardians also failed to record a hit against the Tampa Bay Rays in the second game of a doubleheader on July 7, 2021. This is not considered an official no-hitter because the game only lasted seven innings.

===Combined no-hitters===
The vast majority of no-hit games are finished by the starting pitcher, but 20 MLB no-hitters have been thrown by a combination of the starting and relief pitchers. The first such combined no-hitter occurred on June 23, 1917, when Ernie Shore of the Boston Red Sox relieved starter Babe Ruth, who had been ejected for arguing with the umpire after walking the first batter of the game. The runner was subsequently caught stealing and Shore retired the next 26 batters without allowing any baserunners. This game was long considered a perfect game for Shore, since he recorded 27 outs in succession; current rules classify it only as a combined no-hitter. Another major league combined no-hitter did not occur until April 30, 1967, when Stu Miller of the Baltimore Orioles recorded the final out in relief of Steve Barber in a 2–1 loss to the Detroit Tigers.

The only combined extra inning no-hitter to date occurred on July 12, 1997. Pittsburgh Pirates pitchers Francisco Córdova (9 innings) and Ricardo Rincón (1 inning) combined to no-hit the Houston Astros, 3–0. Victory was secured with a three-run walk-off home run by pinch hitter Mark Smith in the bottom of the tenth inning.
On June 11, 2003, the Houston Astros set a record with six pitchers involved in a combined no-hitter. On that day, Roy Oswalt, Pete Munro, Kirk Saarloos, Brad Lidge, Octavio Dotel, and Billy Wagner combined to hold the New York Yankees hitless. Oswalt was removed after one inning due to injury. Munro pitched the most innings, . He also allowed five of the six baserunners, giving up three walks, hitting a batter and seeing another reach on an error by third baseman Geoff Blum. The only other baserunner was allowed by Dotel, who threw a third-strike wild pitch to Alfonso Soriano with one out in the eighth; Dotel went on to record the forty-fifth four-strikeout inning in regular-season play. Lidge, who retired all six hitters he faced over the sixth and seventh innings, earned the victory. On June 8, 2012, the Seattle Mariners tied this record when Kevin Millwood, Charlie Furbush, Stephen Pryor, Lucas Luetge, Brandon League, and Tom Wilhelmsen combined to no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers. Millwood pitched 6 innings before he was taken out due to a groin injury.

Only one pitcher has thrown a no-hitter as a starter and contributed to a combined no-hitter as a reliever. On September 30, 1984, Mike Witt threw a 1–0 perfect game for the California Angels against the Texas Rangers. On April 11, 1990, pitching the eighth and ninth innings in relief of Mark Langston, Witt earned a save in another 1–0 no-hit victory for the Angels over the Seattle Mariners.

Vida Blue, Kent Mercker, Kevin Millwood, and Cole Hamels are the only pitchers to start both a complete game no-hitter and a combined no-hitter. Vida Blue no-hit the Minnesota Twins on September 21, 1970, while pitching for the Oakland Athletics. He combined with Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad, and Rollie Fingers to no-hit the California Angels on September 28, 1975. While with the Atlanta Braves in 1991, Mercker, Mark Wohlers and Alejandro Peña no-hit the San Diego Padres in the National League&#x27;s first combined no-hitter. Mercker threw a complete game no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 8, 1994. In addition to the game above in which Millwood and the Seattle Mariners tied the record by using six pitchers in a no-hitter, Millwood previously threw a complete game no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants on April 27, 2003, while with the Philadelphia Phillies. Both Mercker and Blue were All-Stars in the seasons of their combined no-hitters, and Blue also won the Cy Young Award and the Most Valuable Player Award during his career.

In 2022, Cristian Javier started in two combined no-hitters that were both successfully closed out by Ryan Pressly. They became the only pitchers to participate in multiple combined no-hitters.

Combined no-hitters are not recognized by Nippon Professional Baseball and KBO League.

===Opening Day, title-clinching, and postseason no-hitters===

The Cleveland Indians&#x27; Bob Feller left the Chicago White Sox hit-less in the 1940 season opener on April 16, the first official Opening Day no-hitter. With the 2020 recognition of certain Negro Leagues as major leagues, Leon Day&#x27;s no-hitter on May 5, 1946, to open the season for the Newark Eagles against the Philadelphia Stars, should also be recognized.

The Houston Astros&#x27; Mike Scott no-hit the San Francisco Giants on September 25, 1986, a victory that also clinched the National League West title for the Astros; this is the only such concurrence in Major League history to date. In the first game of a doubleheader on September 28, 1951, Allie Reynolds of the New York Yankees pitched a no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox which clinched a tie for the American League pennant; the pennant was clinched outright in the doubleheader&#x27;s second game.

There have been three postseason no-hitters in MLB history: two solo and one combined. On October 8, 1956, Don Larsen of the New York Yankees threw a perfect game in Game 5 of that year&#x27;s World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Nine years earlier, the Yankees&#x27; Bill Bevens had come within one out of a no-hitter against the Brooklyn Dodgers in Game 4 of the 1947 World Series, only to lose the game on a pinch-hit double by Cookie Lavagetto. (There have been other one-hitters in the World Series, with the lone hit coming earlier in the game than in Bevens&#x27; effort.) On October 6, 2010, Roy Halladay of the Philadelphia Phillies, in the first postseason appearance of his career, threw the second no-hitter in postseason history, in Game 1 of the Phillies&#x27; NLDS against the Cincinnati Reds. On November 2, 2022, Cristian Javier, Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero, and Ryan Pressly of the Houston Astros combined to no-hit the Phillies in Game 4 of that year&#x27;s World Series.

===Rookie no-hitters===
Twenty-five MLB rookies have pitched a no-hitter since 1901. Four pitchers have thrown a no-hitter in their first major league start; two others have done it in their second major league starts.

Bumpus Jones of the Cincinnati Reds threw a no-hitter on October 15, 1892, in his first major league game. Jones pitched only eight games in the big leagues, finishing with a career win–loss record of 2–4 and a career earned run average of 7.99.

Ted Breitenstein pitched a no-hitter in his first major league start on October 4, 1891; however, it was not his first major league game. He later threw a second no-hitter on April 22, 1898.

On May 6, 1953, Bobo Holloman pitched a no-hitter for the St. Louis Browns in his first major league start (although not his first major league game, as he had previously pitched in relief). This game would prove to be one of only three major league wins that Holloman achieved, against seven losses, all in 1953. Bill Veeck, then-owner of the Browns, in his autobiography described the 27 outs of Holloman&#x27;s no-hitter as consisting of hard-hit ground balls, screaming line drives, and deep fly balls.

On August 14, 2021, Tyler Gilbert of the Arizona Diamondbacks pitched a no-hitter against the San Diego Padres in his first major league start and fourth appearance. His first major league game came just 11 days before his no-hitter.

At the other end of the spectrum, there are nine 300-game winners—Grover Cleveland Alexander, Kid Nichols, Lefty Grove, Early Wynn, Steve Carlton, Don Sutton, Greg Maddux, Roger Clemens and Tom Glavine—who failed to pitch a no-hitter.

On August 11, 1991, Wilson Álvarez of the Chicago White Sox pitched a no-hitter in his second career major league start. During Alvarez&#x27;s first career start, he had allowed three runs on a pair of home runs and did not retire a single batter. Unlike Jones and Holloman, Alvarez went on to win 102 games over a 16-year career.

Clay Buchholz pitched a no-hitter for the Boston Red Sox in his second major league start on September 1, 2007, at Fenway Park. The game ended in a 10–0 victory for the Red Sox over the Baltimore Orioles.

Charlie Robertson of the Chicago White Sox pitched a perfect game against the Detroit Tigers on April 30, 1922, in his fourth career start and fifth career appearance.

===Nine-inning no-hitters in a losing effort===

Unlike a perfect game, in which no batters reach base, in regular no-hitters batters can reach base in other ways, such as a walk, an error, or a hit batsman, thus it is possible for the team pitching the no-hitter to lose. On April 23, 1964, Ken Johnson of the Houston Colt .45s became the only pitcher to lose a complete game no-hitter in nine innings when he was beaten, 1–0, by the Cincinnati Reds. The winning run was scored by Pete Rose in the top of the ninth inning via an error, groundout, and another error.

On April 30, 1967, Steve Barber and Stu Miller of the Baltimore Orioles pitched a combined no-hitter, but lost 2–1 to the Detroit Tigers.

On July 1, 1990, Andy Hawkins of the New York Yankees pitched an eight-inning no-hitter (the Yankees were the away team) against the Chicago White Sox and lost the game 4–0 after an eighth inning which saw three errors. The four runs that the White Sox scored are the most by any team in a game in which they had no hits. Because Hawkins only threw eight innings, this game is not recognized as an official no-hitter by Major League Baseball; however, it was considered a no-hitter at the time it was pitched. In the year after the game, the rules regarding no-hitters, (and rules regarding other statistics), were changed and applied retroactively in order to &quot;clean up the record book&quot;. The Hawkins &quot;no-hitter&quot; failed on one main provision of the new standards. To be classified a valid no-hitter, the pitcher or pitching staff must hold the opposing team hitless for the entire game &quot;and&quot; face opposing batters in at least nine full innings, meaning the only way a team can pitch a losing no-hitter on the road is if the game goes to extra innings and the home team manages to win the game on a walk-off without the benefit of a hit.

On April 12, 1992, Matt Young of the Boston Red Sox faced the Cleveland Indians in the first game of a doubleheader. Young allowed no hits but gave up two runs on seven walks and an error by shortstop Luis Rivera, en route to the second unofficial no-hitter by a losing pitcher on the road.

Jered Weaver and José Arredondo of the Los Angeles Angels also combined for eight innings of no-hit baseball in a 1–0 road loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 28, 2008, after Matt Kemp reached on an error, stole second, advanced to third on another error, and scored on a sacrifice fly. However, since the Angels only pitched eight innings, this game is once again not recognized as an official no-hitter.

On May 15, 2022, Cincinnati Reds pitchers Hunter Greene and Art Warren also combined to pitch an eight inning no-hit loss against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The only run of the game was scored when Pirates shortstop Rodolfo Castro scored on a groundout. The game is again not recognized as an official no-hitter, due to only 8 innings of no-hit play.

===Shortened no-hitters===

A game shortened by previous agreement or that cannot continue due to weather or darkness may be considered a completed official game, as long as at least five innings have been completed. Until 1991, any such game in which a pitcher held the opposing team without hits was considered an official no-hitter; however under the current rule, a no-hitter must last for at least nine innings to count. There are thirty-seven such shortened no-hitters. As the rule was applied retroactively, there are thirty-five games in which a no-hitter was shortened by previous agreement, weather, or darkness, with lengths ranging from 5 to 8 innings, that are no longer considered no-hitters.

There are four shortened no-hitters that were ended early as part of a previous agreement for travel purposes.

In 2020 and 2021, MLB used seven-inning doubleheaders, and on April 25, 2021, Madison Bumgarner threw the fifth shortened no-hitter in baseball history not shortened by weather or darkness. On July 7, 2021, Collin McHugh, Josh Fleming, Diego Castillo, Matt Wisler, and Pete Fairbanks of the Tampa Bay Rays threw a combined seven-inning no-hitter. No-hitters recorded in seven-inning doubleheaders do not count as official no-hitters unless the game lasts at least nine innings and the no-hitter is preserved through the end of the game.

If the home team leads after the top of the ninth, they do not bat in the bottom of the ninth, thus the visiting team only pitches eight innings. Since it is possible to score runs without getting hits, a visiting team can complete a full game without allowing a hit but not be credited with an official no-hitter. This has happened five times in MLB history. Silver King (1890), Andy Hawkins (1990), and Matt Young (1992) pitched complete games without allowing a hit, but pitched only eight innings as the losing pitcher from the visiting team, and thus are not credited with a no-hitter. In 2008, Jered Weaver and José Arredondo combined to throw eight no hit innings, and in 2022, Hunter Greene and Art Warren also combined to throw eight no-hit innings, while losing the game 1–0.

===No-hitters broken up in extra innings===
A game that is a no-hitter through nine innings may be broken up in extra innings. Under current rules, such a game (whether won or lost) is not considered an official no-hitter because the pitching staff did not keep the opposing team hitless for the entire course of the game.
On May 2, 1917, a game between the Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds reached the end of nine innings in a hitless scoreless tie, the only time in baseball history that &quot;neither&quot; team has had a hit in regulation. Both Hippo Vaughn of the Cubs and Fred Toney of the Reds continued pitching into the tenth inning. Vaughn lost his no-hitter in the top of the tenth, as the Reds got two hits and scored the winning run. Toney retired the side in the bottom of the tenth and recorded a ten-inning no-hitter. This game was long considered a &quot;double no-hitter&quot;, but Vaughn is no longer credited with a no-hitter under the current rules.

Of the sixteen potential no-hitters that have been lost in extra innings, two were perfect games until the inning when the first hit was surrendered. On May 26, 1959, Harvey Haddix of the Pittsburgh Pirates pitched a remarkable twelve perfect innings against the Milwaukee Braves before losing the perfect game on an error and then the no-hitter and the game in the thirteenth inning. On June 3, 1995, Pedro Martínez of the Montreal Expos pitched nine perfect innings against the San Diego Padres before giving up a hit in the tenth and exiting the game, which the Expos then won, 1–0.

On August 23, 2017, in a game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Pittsburgh Pirates, Dodgers pitcher Rich Hill pitched nine no-hit innings, only to lose his no-hit bid (and the game) on a walk-off homer by Josh Harrison in the 10th inning. This was another potential perfect game; the perfect game was broken up by a ninth-inning error, the first time that had happened in MLB history.

On April 23, 2022, the Tampa Bay Rays threw a combined no-hitter against the Red Sox that was broken up in the tenth inning. J. P. Feyereisen, Javy Guerra, Jeffrey Springs, Jason Adam, Ryan Thompson, and Andrew Kittredge threw nine hitless frames before Matt Wisler surrendered a triple to Boston&#x27;s Bobby Dalbec, which scored the extra-innings runner on second base. The Rays would go on to walk-off the game in the bottom of the inning with a Kevin Kiermaier home run; Wisler was credited with the win.

On September 10, 2023, the Milwaukee Brewers threw 10 combined no-hit innings against the New York Yankees, before the no-hitter was broken up in the bottom of the 11th, with the Yankees later winning the game. Corbin Burnes pitched 8 of those no-hit innings, followed by Devin Williams and Abner Uribe in two consecutive no-hit innings, before Oswaldo Cabrera hit a run-scoring double off of Joel Payamps in the bottom of the 11th. The Yankees ultimately won on a Kyle Higashioka double in the bottom of the 13th off of Hoby Milner, who is credited with the loss.

===Time between franchise no-hitters===
All 30 active teams in Major League Baseball have pitched a no-hitter. The last active MLB team to throw its first no-hitter was the San Diego Padres, when pitcher Joe Musgrove struck out ten batters and held the Texas Rangers hitless at Globe Life Field on April 9, 2021, 52 years after the team&#x27;s debut in 1969. The closest attempt by a single pitcher prior to 2021 was against the Philadelphia Phillies on July 18, 1972: Steve Arlin came within one out of a no-hitter before Denny Doyle broke up his bid with a single. On July 9, 2011, five Padres pitchers combined for innings of no-hit pitching against the Los Angeles Dodgers before Juan Uribe hit a double, which was followed by a Dioner Navarro single that allowed the Dodgers to score to win the game, 1–0.

The Cleveland Guardians have the longest active no-hitter drought; the last such game thrown by the team was Len Barker&#x27;s perfect game on May 15, 1981.

The New York Mets, who began play in 1962, went without a no-hitter until Johan Santana pitched one on the night of June 1, 2012, against the St. Louis Cardinals at home at Citi Field. The 8–0 victory closed out their era as the oldest franchise without a no-hitter and ended a drought that lasted 8,019 regular-season and 74 post-season games. As of the start of the 2021 season, Mets pitchers have thrown 39 one-hitters.

The longest no-hitter drought in MLB history was suffered by the Philadelphia Phillies between May 1, 1906, and June 21, 1964, a span of 8,945 games.

The Washington Nationals achieved their first no-hitter on September 28, 2014. The franchise has four previous no-hitters in its history as the Montreal Expos, including a perfect game by Dennis Martínez.

Six current NL teams—the Braves, Dodgers, Giants, Phillies, Cubs and Reds—all pitched their first no-hitters before the advent of the American League in 1901. Among the early National League teams still playing, the last to get their first no-hitter was the St. Louis Cardinals, when Jesse Haines pitched one on July 17, 1924. Of the original American League teams, the last team to get their first no-hitter was the New York Yankees, when George Mogridge pitched one on April 24, 1917. There are a number of short-lived Major League franchises from the nineteenth century that folded without ever recording a no-hitter.



===Avoiding no-hitters===
All modern-era MLB teams have experienced at least two no-hitters pitched against them. The record for the longest period of time without being no-hit is held by the Chicago Cubs, who succeeded in getting at least one hit in every game following Sandy Koufax&#x27;s perfect game against them on September 9, 1965, until they were no-hit by Cole Hamels of the Philadelphia Phillies on July 25, 2015, a period of (7951 games, including 31 postseason games). Koufax&#x27;s perfect game, together with Bob Hendley&#x27;s one-hitter, is the only major league game in which the two teams combined for only one hit.

The second-longest streak without having an official no-hitter pitched against them is held by the New York Yankees, who had a gap of between nine-inning no-hitters from September 21, 1958, to June 10, 2003. However, during this time, the Yankees failed to collect a hit in a rain-shortened official game on July 12, 1990, after .

Including games of less than nine innings, the St. Louis Cardinals have the second-longest streak between games when they did not collect a hit: May 12, 1919, to May 14, 1960, a period of . Among AL teams, the Kansas City Royals hold the longest such streak: May 15, 1973 to May 19, 2008, a period of .

The longest current streak is held by the Los Angeles Angels, last held hitless on September 11, 1999 () ago by Minnesota Twins pitcher Eric Milton.

===No-hitters and ballparks===
Forbes Field, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates from the middle of the 1909 season until the middle of the 1970 season, is the only long-term major league ballpark where a no-hitter was never thrown during its existence. There are three recently built fields where no-hitters have not yet been thrown, Busch Stadium, Truist Park, and Target Field. Four parks presently in existence for a decade or more have only seen one no-hitter each: Coors Field, the hitter-friendly home of the Colorado Rockies (Hideo Nomo on September 17, 1996); the Orioles&#x27; current home, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, known for being hitter friendly (Nomo on April 4, 2001); PNC Park, the current home of the Pirates, which like Forbes Field is known for being hitter-friendly (Homer Bailey on September 28, 2012); and Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres, which initially was known as a pitcher&#x27;s park but was modified with shorter fences in 2013 (Tim Lincecum on July 13, 2013).

American Family Field, home of the Milwaukee Brewers, has hosted two no-hitters, but only one involved its home team. Both no-hitters were thrown by the Chicago Cubs—Alec Mills threw a no-hitter on September 13, 2020, against the Brewers; and Carlos Zambrano pitched one on September 14, 2008, against the &quot;home&quot; Houston Astros in a game displaced by Hurricane Ike.

==All-American Girls Professional Baseball League==
The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) existed from 1943 to 1954. 56 no-hitters are known to have occurred in the league.

Olive Little threw the first no-hitter in team and league history, for the Rockford Peaches on June 10, 1943.

Four of the league&#x27;s players pitched a perfect game (note that all perfect games are no-hitters, but not all no-hitters are perfect games): Annabelle Lee in 1944, Carolyn Morris in 1945, Doris Sams in 1947, and Jean Faut in 1951 (against the Rockford Peaches) and again in 1953 (against the Kalamazoo Lassies). Faut is the only professional baseball player, male or female, to have pitched two perfect games.

==Nippon Professional Baseball==

There have been 66 no-hitters in Nippon Professional Baseball history. As noted above, unlike Major League Baseball, the Japanese league does not count combined or not shutout no-hitters.

==KBO League==

There have been 14 no-hitters in KBO League history. As noted above, unlike Major League Baseball, the KBO League does not count combined or not shutout no-hitters.

==Negro leagues==

Ongoing research by baseball historians has revealed the existence of 34 no-hitters thrown in Negro league baseball; the research has had to clarify differences between play from teams and barnstorming, and one of the no-hitters was done at a Benefit All-Star Game. In 2020, Major League Baseball announced the addition of the seven &quot;Negro Major Leagues&quot; that played from 1920 to 1948 as major leagues, which recognized statistics from over 3,400 players that played in those seasons, which will only increase the need for further research and verification over no-hitters.

This presumes that 22 to 24 no-hitters from that said era (22 regular season, one postseason, one All-Star game) could be recognized by official record books such as Elias in future years. There are also six games that were prematurely cut from the intended length of nine innings that were called due to weather that ranged from 1926 to 1945, one of which includes Luther Farrell and his seven-inning no-hitter in Game 5 of the 1927 Colored World Series.

Four pitchers threw two no-hitters: Phil Cockrell, Jesse Winters, Satchel Paige, and Porter Moss; Dick Redding, nicknamed &quot;Cannonball&quot;, was reported to have thrown as many as 30 no-hitters in his career, but the disparity in finding enough box scores to verify such claim still proves too great for researchers (incidentally, Paige had estimated he threw 55 no-hitters in a long career of league games and barnstorming). At any rate, his no-hitter for the Lincoln Giants against the Cuban Stars is generally considered the first no-hitter documented between two African American teams considered to have played at the highest level. Leon Day threw a no-hitter on May 5, 1946, to open the season for the Newark Eagles against the Philadelphia Stars, which is believed to be the second no-hitter thrown by a pitcher on Opening Day.

Eleven were done in the 1910s, while fourteen were verified to have been done in the 1920s, six in the 1930s, and three in the 1940s. Likely the most famous no-hitter thrown by a player in the Negro leagues was Red Grier, who pitched a no-hitter in Game 3 of the 1926 Colored World Series on October 3, 1926, doing so for the Bacharach Giants against the Chicago American Giants. It was the first no-hitter thrown in a major league postseason game, and no one would throw another in the playoffs until Don Larsen 30 years later.

==International competition==
In the 2006 World Baseball Classic, Shairon Martis pitched a shortened no-hitter for the Netherlands against Panama. The game was ended after seven innings due to the mercy rule. In the 2023 World Baseball Classic, four Puerto Rico pitchers (José De León (5.2 innings), Yacksel Ríos (0.1 inning), Edwin Díaz (1 inning), and Duane Underwood Jr. (1 inning)) combined for a shortened perfect game against Israel. The game was ended after eight innings due to the mercy rule.

==Other notable no-hitters==
Two no-hitters have been thrown in the Caribbean Series. The first, in 1952, was thrown by Tommy Fine of the Leones del Habana (Cuba), against Cerveceria Caracas (Venezuela). The second would not be thrown until 2024, by Ángel Padrón of Tiburones de La Guaira (Venezuela) in a 9-0 victory over Gigantes de Rivas (Nicaragua).

Considered to be one of the greatest amateur pitchers in Ontario in the 1950s and 1960s, southpaw Jack Roberts pitched two consecutive no-hitters for the Campbellville Merchants – a team with a .771 winning percentage – in an Ontario Baseball Association Intermediate C round-robin final in 1966.

In 1974 Bunny Taylor became the first girl to pitch a no-hitter in Little League Baseball.

A very unusual seven-inning no hitter was thrown by the LA Angels AA minor league affiliate of the Southern League, the Rocket City Trash Pandas, a team based in Madison, Alabama. On April 8, 2023 in a scheduled 7-inning game, Rocket City was leading Reds AA affiliate, the Chattanooga Lookouts, 3-0 heading into the top of the 7th inning, just three outs from completing the no-hitter. With the aide of 5 walks, 4 batters hit by pitch, a wild pitch, and a crucial 2-out, three-run error to center field on a fly out that would have ended the game in a win if caught, Chattanooga scored seven runs without a hit, eventually winning the game 7-5. Only six major league teams have had no-hitters in a loss; however, to give up 7 runs, all in the top of the last inning without a hit is unprecedented.

==No-hitter with complete game shutout win==
Unlike MLB and the WBSC (global sanctioning body of baseball) definitions, a no-hitter is called a &quot;no hit, no run&quot; game in Eastern Asian professional leagues. The requirements are different from the traditional definition; the game is a shutout victory where the starting pitcher pitches the entire game while allowing no hits, and no runs are scored (a no-hitter by the traditional definition runs may score by walk, hit by pitch, defensive interference, errors, stolen bases, and balks). In those leagues, a no-hitter is not regarded as official record unless the starting pitcher pitches the whole game and the opposing team scores zero runs, and the team either wins or the game ends in a tie, which happens when the innings limit is reached. There is a twelve-inning limit in these leagues.

==Superstitions==
One of the most common baseball superstitions is that it is bad luck to mention a no-hitter in progress, especially to the pitcher and in particular by their teammates (who sometimes even go so far as to avoid even going &quot;near&quot; the pitcher). Some sportscasters observe this taboo while others have no reservations about mentioning no-hitters before completion. When Sandy Koufax pitched his no-hitter against the Mets in 1962, one of their 120 losses that season, Mets&#x27; coach Solly Hemus, apparently trying to jinx Koufax, kept heckling him through the game about pitching a no-hitter, according to a post-game interview Koufax gave after pitching his third no-hitter in 1964. An early biography of Koufax quoted him as telling his catcher, during that 1964 no-hitter, &quot;Let&#x27;s just go to the fastball and get this no-hit thing over with.&quot; Mickey Mantle, in an interview for Ken Burns&#x27; 1994 &quot;Baseball&quot; documentary series, related that Don Larsen, famed for his 1956 World Series perfect game, tried to talk about his no-hitter throughout the contest but much to his chagrin his Yankee teammates avoided his conversation and maintained the superstition.

When Los Angeles Angels rookie Bo Belinsky entered the final inning of his no-hitter in 1962, Baltimore Orioles outfielder Jackie Brandt passed him on the field as the teams changed sides. According to Belinsky biographer Maury Allen, Brandt told Belinsky, &quot;Nice game, Bo, but it&#x27;s over. I&#x27;m leading off with a bunt single.&quot; Belinsky got Brandt out to start the final inning of his no-hitter.

In 2009, when Mark Buehrle was pitching his perfect game, as he exited the field after the eighth inning, White Sox broadcaster Ken Harrelson exclaimed, &quot;Call your sons! Call your daughters! Call your friends! Call your neighbors! Mark Buehrle has a perfect game going into the ninth!&quot; Buehrle retired the side in the ninth to complete the perfect game.

When Jim Bunning was pitching his perfect game in 1964, he deliberately violated this superstition, talking to his teammates about the perfect game&#x27;s progress in order to dispel the tension in the dugout.

<text>Liberty Records was a record label founded in the United States by chairman Simon Waronker in 1955 with Alvin Bennett as president and Theodore Keep as chief engineer. It was reactivated in 2001 in the United Kingdom and had two previous revivals.

==History==
===1950s===
Liberty&#x27;s early releases focused on film and orchestral music. Its first single was Lionel Newman&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Upstairs&quot;. Its first big hit, in 1955, was by Julie London singing her version of the torch song, &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, which climbed to No. 9 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It helped Liberty sell her first album, &quot;Julie Is Her Name&quot;.

In 1956, Liberty signed Henry Mancini and released two singles and several albums by him. He left in 1958, signing with RCA Victor, where his record sales increased. Billy Rose and Lee David&#x27;s song &quot;Tonight You Belong to Me&quot; reached number 4 (US) and number 28 (UK) when it was performed by teen sisters Patience and Prudence (McIntyre), selling over a million copies. Liberty also scored a Top 10 hit with Margie Rayburn&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Available&quot; and the singer went on to record two dozen singles for them.

The label&#x27;s biggest rock singer was Eddie Cochran who starred in his second film, &quot;Untamed Youth&quot;. His first hit for the label was John D. Loudermilk&#x27;s &quot;Sittin&#x27; in the Balcony&quot; in 1957, then came &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; and &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot;.

The roster included R&amp;B act Billy Ward and His Dominoes after Jackie Wilson quit, replacing him with ex-Lark Eugene Mumford. Their version of Hoagy Carmichael&#x27;s 1927 song &quot;Stardust&quot; reached No. 13 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and 13 on the UK Singles Chart in October 1957. It was the group&#x27;s only million seller.

By 1958, Liberty was close to bankruptcy when singer-songwriter Ross Bagdasarian, performing as David Seville, had a number one hit with his novelty song &quot;Witch Doctor&quot;. Later that year, he combined multi-track recording with the altered speed technique he had used in &quot;Witch Doctor&quot; and introduced the Chipmunks (Alvin, Simon, and Theodore—named after Liberty executives Bennett, Waronker, and Keep, respectively) in &quot;The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don&#x27;t Be Late)&quot;. In the months leading to Christmas of 1958, the record went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the first Christmas record to reach number 1 on that chart and selling 4.5 million copies.

Also in 1958, Liberty formed a sublabel called Freedom which lasted through 1959, when Liberty moved to its long-time address at 6920 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.

===1960s and 1970s===

Liberty&#x27;s most successful signing of the early 1960s was Bobby Vee, picking up &quot;Suzie Baby&quot;, a single he recorded with the Shadows for Soma. He covered the Clovers&#x27; 1955 doo-wop ballad &quot;Devil or Angel&quot; in mid-1960 and later that year recorded Gene Pitney&#x27;s &quot;Rubber Ball&quot;, which made him an international star. In the summer of 1961 Vee had a hit with &quot;Take Good Care of My Baby&quot;, which peaked at number one (US) and number 3 (UK). He had hits until 1970. Other acts on the roster were Willie Nelson, Jan and Dean, Johnny Burnette, Gene McDaniels, Del Shannon, Ralph Williams/The Marauders, Gary Lewis and the Playboys, Timi Yuro, and Vikki Carr. Snuff Garrett produced easy listening albums credited to &quot;The 50 Guitars of Tommy Garrett&quot;. Liberty sent an annual report for the fiscal year ended 31 January 1962 that included a limited edition 33-1/3 vinyl record with songs by Bobby Vee, Timi Yuro, Gene McDaniels, Si Zentner, and Tommy Garrett. A welcome message recorded by Simon Waronker was also included.

In 1963, Liberty was sold to electronics corporation Avnet for $12 million. Avnet also bought Blue Note, Imperial, Dolton, Aladdin, and Minit. After two years of losses, Avnet sold the labels back to Al Bennett for $8 million. Liberty earlier acquired Pacific Jazz, founded in 1952. In 1966, Sunset was started to reissue records from the acquired labels. Sunset&#x27;s catalog included Eddie Harris (&quot;The Explosive Eddie Harris&quot;), Jimmy Reed (&quot;Something Else&quot;), Les McCann (&quot;Django&quot;), Teddy Buckner (&quot;A Salute to Satchmo&quot;), Wild Bill Davis (&quot;Flying Home&quot;), Lester Young (&quot;Giant of Jazz&quot;), The Ventures (&quot;Supergroup&quot;), and Chet Baker (&quot;Swings Pretty&quot;).

Liberty recordings were distributed in the UK by the Decca group on London Records, then by EMI on Liberty. Liberty established a branch office in London, which signed the Bonzo Dog Band, Idle Race, and the Aynsley Dunbar Retaliation. After moving distribution to Philips in 1967, they returned to EMI in 1970. Liberty also signed the Searchers. In 1967, Liberty issued the first single by Family. Ron Kass, onetime president of Liberty, became the head of Apple, the label of the Beatles. Ron Bledsoe, assistant to Al Bennett, was picked by Clive Davis to run the Nashville branch of Columbia. In 1966 singer Johnny Rivers started another Liberty subsidiary, Soul City. The following year, Liberty discontinued the Dolton label and moved its catalog to the parent label. In 1967, Liberty signed Canned Heat, which had three hit singles for the label. In 1968, Liberty was bought for $24 million by Transamerica Corporation, an insurance company, and combined with United Artists. Two years later Imperial and Minit were shut down and transferred its catalog and artists to Liberty and United Artists. In 1970 Sugarloaf scored a top 10 hit in the United States with &quot;Green-Eyed Lady&quot;, which reached number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Sugarloaf would score again in 1975 with &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Us, We&#x27;ll Call You&quot; (US number 9).

In 1971, Liberty and its remaining labels (except for Soul City, whose catalog was sold to Bell and Blue Note) were shifted to United Artists, and Liberty was no more. In 1978, Artie Mogull and Jerry Rubinstein acquired United Artists and Liberty with money they borrowed from Capitol. In February 1979, Capitol&#x27;s parent company EMI foreclosed on them and took over Liberty. Eight months later, Thorn Electrical Industries merged with EMI to form Thorn EMI.

===1980s and 1990s===

In 1980, EMI dropped the United Artists name and revived the Liberty name. EMI used Liberty to reissue the catalogs of United Artists, Liberty, and Imperial. From 1980 to 1984, Capitol used Liberty in America primarily as a country music label for acts such as Kenny Rogers and Dottie West, though heavy metal band Manowar was also signed to the company. In the United Kingdom, many new wave acts like The Stranglers were moved over to the &#x27;new&#x27; label from United Artists (as Kirk Kerkorian had purchased the name for his film company) and were soon joined by new acts such as New Romantic band Classix Nouveaux. In 1991, Capitol-EMI renamed its Capitol Nashville label to Liberty before returning to the Capitol Nashville name four years later.

In 1994, Liberty president Jimmy Bowen founded a sister label called Patriot Records, whose roster included Bryan Austin, Lisa Brokop, John Berry, Deana Carter, John Bunzow, and Noah Gordon. After the label closed in 1995, Berry, Brokop, and Carter transferred to Capitol Nashville.

===2000s to 2010s===
After releasing many late-1990s Europop acts like the Hermes House Band, EMI reformatted the label in 2001 to focus on &#x27;heritage acts&#x27;. The label, operating in a similar sphere to that of rival Sanctuary, signed The Alarm (then branded as the Alarm MMVI) and Prefab Sprout, with the Stranglers releasing their first EMI album in over twenty years, &quot;Norfolk Coast&quot;, on the label in 2004. Liberty also licensed the Bangles&#x27; 2003 album &quot;Doll Revolution&quot; from their own indie label Down Kiddie! Records, distributing it in Canada and some European countries alongside the United Kingdom. The label later went into abeyance, never bringing out newer releases again.

<doc id="329904" wikidata="Q3087440" url="?curid=329904" title="Fremont, Seattle">
<text>Fremont is a neighborhood in the North Central District of Seattle, Washington, United States. Originally a separate city, it was annexed to Seattle in 1891. It is named after Fremont, Nebraska, the hometown of two of its founders: Luther H. Griffith and Edward Blewett.

==Geography==
Fremont is situated along the Fremont Cut of the Lake Washington Ship Canal to the north of Queen Anne, the east of Ballard, the south of Phinney Ridge, and the southwest of Wallingford. Its boundaries are not formally fixed, but they can be thought of as consisting of the Ship Canal to the south, Stone Way N. to the east, N. 50th Street to the north, and 8th Avenue N.W. to the west.

The neighborhood&#x27;s main thoroughfares are Fremont and Aurora Avenues N. (north- and southbound) and N. 46th, 45th, 36th, and 34th Streets (east- and westbound). The Aurora Bridge (George Washington Memorial Bridge) carries Aurora Avenue (State Route 99) over the Ship Canal to the top of Queen Anne Hill, and the Fremont Bridge carries Fremont Avenue over the canal to the hill&#x27;s base. A major shopping district is centered on Fremont Avenue N. just north of the bridge.

==Counterculture==

Fremont is sometimes referred to as &quot;The People&#x27;s Republic of Fremont&quot; or &quot;The Artists&#x27; Republic of Fremont,&quot; and was at one time a center of counterculture; however, the neighborhood has become somewhat gentrified since the 1990s. It remains home to a controversial statue of Vladimir Lenin salvaged from Slovakia by an art lover from Washington state who was teaching in the area at the time. After the 1989 fall of the Communist government, he brought the statue to Fremont with money raised through a mortgage on his house. The &quot;Fremont Troll&quot; is an concrete sculpture of a troll crushing a Volkswagen Beetle in its left hand, created in 1990 and situated under the north end of the Aurora Bridge. The street running under the bridge and ending at the Troll was renamed Troll Avenue N. in 2005.

The neighborhood also features various signs giving advice such as &quot;set your watch back five minutes,&quot; &quot;set your watch forward five minutes,&quot; and &quot;throw your watch away.&quot; Other landmarks include the Fremont Rocket, a Fairchild C-119 tail boom modified to resemble a missile, and the outdoor sculpture &quot;Waiting for the Interurban&quot;.

Since the early 1970s some Fremont residents have been referring to their neighborhood as &quot;The Center of the Universe&quot; (which also appears on a large &quot;Welcome&quot; sign). An unofficial motto &quot;De Libertas Quirkas&quot; (&quot;Freedom to be Peculiar&quot; in mock Latin) appears in brochures and websites about the area.

==Events and institutions==
The Fremont Arts Council sponsors several highly attended annual events in Fremont. The Summer Solstice Parade &amp; Pageant has made Fremont famous for its nude Solstice Cyclists. Another event is Troll-a-ween.

Also important to Fremont is the large block on Linden Avenue N. that contains the B.F. Day Elementary School and B.F. Day Playground, two separate entities. B.F. Day is the longest continually operating school in the Seattle school district, having been founded in 1892.

Another longstanding institution is the Fremont branch of the Seattle Public Library. An informal library predated the 1891 annexation of Fremont to Seattle, and annexation made it the city&#x27;s first branch library. The present structure dates from 1921.

Besides the B.F. Day playfield, Fremont has three small public parks, Fremont Peak Park just south of N. 45th Street, Ross Park and Playground at 3rd Avenue NW and NW 43rd Street, and A.B. Ernst Park next to the library. Ernst Park was named for Ambrose Ernst, a Fremont resident. He was known as the &quot;Father of City Playfields&quot;. He served on the Board of Park Commissioners from 1906 to 1913 and helped implement Seattle&#x27;s Olmsted parks plan.

The Burke–Gilman Trail passes through Fremont just north of the Lake Washington Ship Canal. The large Gas Works Park is just east of Fremont on the north shore of Lake Union.

==Companies and organizations==
Theo Chocolate&#x27;s factory and store, golf and daywear label Cutter &amp; Buck&#x27;s corporate headquarters, and Brooks Sports&#x27; headquarters are located here. Fremont has several breweries including Hale&#x27;s Ales brewery and Fremont Brewing. The original Redhook breweries were located in Fremont until their closures in 1988 and 2002, respectively. Google opened offices here in 2006, and the parent company of Geocaching.com is headquartered in Fremont.

A growing number of technology companies have offices in Fremont, including Adobe Systems, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, SDL PLC, Groundspeak, Impinj, Sporcle, and Tableau Software. Most of these offices are along the Lake Washington Ship Canal.

The neighborhood is home to a number of nonprofit organizations, including Literacy Source and Provail, a provider of social services to people with disabilities and an affiliate of the United Cerebral Palsy network.

A wedge-shaped building on Leary Way, a diagonal street cutting across Fremont from the adjacent Ballard neighborhood, once housed the legendary Seattle producer Jack Endino&#x27;s Reciprocal Recording studio, where he recorded (among many other records) Nirvana&#x27;s first demos and the band&#x27;s debut on Sub Pop records, &quot;Bleach&quot;.

<text>Pulkovo Federal State Unified Aviation Service Company (ФГУАП “Пулково”) was an airline with its head office in Moskovsky District, Saint Petersburg, Russia. It operated the Pulkovo Airport and was 100% state owned. It was the third largest airline in Russia. On 29 October 2006 it completed a merger with government owned Federal State Unified Aviation Service Company to form a new company under the Rossiya name.

== History ==

The airline was named after the area where it is located, along with the village of Pulkovo and Pulkovo Observatory. The airline began on 24 June 1932 with the landing of two aircraft from Moscow at the newly constructed Shosseynaya Airport south of Leningrad. Air travel expanded rapidly, and in 1939 Shosseynaya Airport operated 29 routes, carrying 6,305 passengers, 708 tons of cargo, and over 333 tons of mail.

The airport became known as Pulkovo in the late 1950s. The airport complex consists of two separate terminals which are so far away from each other than can they can be classified as separate airports.

Pulkovo used the Aeroflot livery until ordered to change it in 1997 so to avoid ambiguity. It joined the IATA in June 2000.

In 2003, it employed about 7,000 workers, and in the first half of 2003, it carried 911,563 passengers, of 515,720 were domestic and 395,843 international and CIS passengers. It also carried 3,753.6 tons of cargo, of which 3,138.5 was domestic and 615.1 international and CIS (this last was an increase of 34% over the same period in 2002).

In 2006, Pulkovo completed its merger with Rossiya. They now operate as a single company.

== Incidents and accidents ==
*On 24 February 1994 Pulkovo Aviation Enterprise Flight 9045 crashed in poor weather conditions on approach to Nalchik Airport.
*28 July 2002, at 3:25pm local time, Pulkovo Aviation Enterprise Flight 9560, an Ilyushin Il-86 registration RA-86060, crashed shortly after takeoff with 16 crew on board, from Moscow Sheremetyevo International Airport while on a repositioning flight to Saint Petersburg. Witnesses reported seeing the aircraft enter a steep climb immediately after takeoff, bank left, and crash into a forest near the end of the runway. Initial examination of the aircraft&#x27;s Digital Flight Data Recorder indicates that, two seconds after liftoff, the plane&#x27;s horizontal stabilizer spontaneously shifted to a full nose-up position. The Captain immediately pushed the control yoke fully forward in an attempt to lower the aircraft&#x27;s nose, but was unsuccessful in doing so. Two flight attendants aboard survived.
*On 22 August 2006, Pulkovo Aviation Enterprise Flight 612, a Tu-154 airliner with 160 passengers and 10 crew on board en route from Anapa to Saint Petersburg, crashed near Donetsk in Ukraine. The flight crew attempted to navigate through high clouds containing an extremely powerful thunderstorm. The aircraft entered an uncontrolled spin and could not recover. Everyone on board died. The Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) determined that the causes of the crash were airplane entering a stall condition due to excessive angle of attack and lack of airspeed in manual flight mode due to insufficient control and cooperation among the flight crew members.

<text>Civil disorder, also known as civil disturbance, civil unrest, civil strife, or turmoil, are situations when law enforcement struggle to maintain public order or tranquility.

==Causes==
Any number of things may cause civil disorder, whether it is a single cause or a combination of causes; however, most are born from political grievances, economic disparities, social discord, but historically have been the result of long-standing oppression by a group of people towards another.

Civil disorder arising from political grievances can include a range of events, from a simple protest to a mass civil disobedience. These events can be spontaneous, but can also be planned. These events can turn violent when agitators and law enforcers overreact.

Civil disorder has in history arisen from economic disputes, political reasons (such as in opposition to oppressive or tyrannical government forces), religious opposition, racial oppression and social discord among various cases throughout history.

==Crowd==
===Formation===

Exploiting a crowd&#x27;s mood, radicals can manipulate and a crowd, using skillful agitation to coax the crowd&#x27;s capacity for violence and turn it into a vengeful mob, directing the crowd&#x27;s aggression and resentment at the agitator&#x27;s chosen target.

Tactical agitators can leverage media, including social media, to connect with potential crowd members and incite them to break the law or provoke others, all without direct personal contact. Conversely, a skilled leader can calm or divert a crowd using strategic suggestions, commands, or appeals to reason, aiming to de-escalate a situation.

Emotional contagion plays a significant role in crowd behaviour by fostering a sense of unity among its members. This unity can lead the crowd to adopt a mob mentality and engage in mob behaviour. Crowd members amplify each other&#x27;s emotions, creating a heightened state of collective emotion. Ideas rapidly spread among the group and to bystanders and mass media.

When emotional contagion prevails, raw emotion is high while self-discipline is low. Personal prejudices and unsatisfied desires – usually restrained – are unabashedly released. This incentivizes crowd membership, as the crowd provides cover for individuals to do things they want to do, but would not dare try to do alone. This incentive can become greater for the crowd than its concern for law and authority, leading to unlawful and disruptive acts. Once the crowd engages in such acts, it effectively becomes a mob – a highly emotional, unreasonable, potentially violent crowd.

===Behavior===
Crowd behavior is the emotional needs, fears, and prejudices of the crowd members. It is driven by social factors such as the strength, or weakness, of leadership, moral perspective, or community uniformity, and also by psychological factors of suggestion e.g. imitation, anonymity, impersonality, emotional release, emotional contagion, panic, etc.

During civil disorder, any crowd can be a threat to law enforcers because it is open to manipulation. This is because the behavior of a crowd is under the direction of the majority of its members. While its members are usually inclined to obey the law, emotional stimuli, and the feeling of fearlessness that arises from being in a crowd, can cause crowd members to indulge in impulses, act on aggressions, and unleash rage. When law enforcement limits the full realization of these actions, the crowd will channel this hostility elsewhere, making the crowd a hostile and unpredictable threat to law enforcers.

Crowds want to be directed, and can become frustrated by confusion and uncertainty; therefore, leadership can have a profound influence on the intensity and conduct of a crowd&#x27;s behavior. The first person to authoritatively direct a crowd will likely be followed. Opportunity for radicals to take charge of a group to emerge when no authoritative voice emerges, and the crowd becomes frustrated without direction.

Panic, which is extremely and quickly contagious, also affects crowd behavior by influencing their ability to reason, lending to frantic, irrational behavior that can not only endanger the crowd, but also others. During civil disorder, panic can set in when a crowd member realizes –

* They are in danger and fleeing is necessary to escape arrest or harm
* Few escape routes exist
* The few escape routes are congested with traffic
* Their actions have caused harm to others
* When they have not dispersed the scene quickly enough, that their life, or freedom, is at risk from encroaching law enforcement agents

===Tactics===

A goal of violent demonstrators is to spur law enforcers to take action that can be exploited as acts of brutality in order to generate sympathy for their cause, and/or to anger and demoralize the opposition. Crowds can use a range of tactics to evade law enforcement or to promote disorder, from verbal assault to distracting law enforcers to building barricades. The more well-planned tactics occur, the more purposeful the disorder. For example, crowds may form human blockades to shut down roads, they may trespass on government property, they may try to force mass arrests, they may handcuff themselves to things or to each other, or they may lock arms, making it more difficult to separate them, or they might create confusion or diversions through the use of rock throwing, arson, or terrorist acts, giving leeway to law enforcers to be forceful or excessive while trying to remove them. 

Most participants of civil disorder engage on foot. However, organized efforts can often implore the use vehicles and wireless communication.

Participants have been known to use scanners to monitor police frequencies or transmitters to sabotage law enforcement communications.

If a crowd turns violent, effectively becoming a &quot;mob,&quot; it may execute physical attacks on people and property, such as by throwing homemade weapons like Molotov cocktails, firing small arms, and planting improvised explosive devices. A crowd may resort to throwing rocks, bricks, bottles, etc. If violence is pre-arranged, the crowd can hide their weapons or vandalism tools well before the crowd formation, catching law enforcement by surprise.

Crowds may arm themselves with:

* Gas masks
* Rocks
* Helmets
* Homemade shields
* Improvised picket signs
* Molotov cocktails
* Paint bombs
* Pipes
* Safety goggles
* Wire cutters

A mob may erect barricades to impede, or prevent, the effectiveness of law enforcement. For example, they may use grappling hooks, chains, rope, or vehicles to breach gates or fences. They may use sticks or poles to limit law enforcement&#x27;s use of billy clubs and bayonets. They may overturn civilian vehicles to impede troops advancing to engage them or vandalize law enforcement vehicles to try to spark over-reaction from law enforcement or to incite further lawlessness from the mob.

Mobs often employ fire, smoke, or hidden explosive devices e.g. strapped to animals, masked in cigarette lighters or toys, rigged to directed vehicles, etc. Not only can these devices be used to create confusion or diversion, but they can also be used to destroy property, mask looting of mob participants, or provide cover for mob participants firing weapons at law enforcement. If law enforcement engages with the mob, in returning fire, any innocent casualties resulting from the chaos usually make law enforcement look undisciplined and oppressive.
==United States==
===Legal definition===
According to the U.S. Code, a person is engaged in civil disorder if he or she -

Like mob participants, law enforcers are also susceptible to crowd behavior. Such tense confrontation can emotionally stimulate them, creating a highly emotional atmosphere all around. This emotional stimulation can become infectious throughout law enforcement agents, conflicting with their disciplined training.

When emotional tension is high among law enforcement agents, they may breach their feeling of restraint and commit acts, against people in the mob, that they normally would suppress. The emotional atmosphere can also make them highly susceptible to rumors and fear.

Like mob members, law enforcement agents, acting as a group, can also lose their sense of individuality and develop a feeling of anonymity. Under emotional instability, individual prejudices, that any individual law enforcement agent may harbor against the mob, or against individual participants of the mob, may influence the behavior of the law enforcement agent. Like the mob, these conditions make law enforcement actors more likely to imitate the behavior of each other, which can result in a chain of biased, excessive, or otherwise, dangerous, behavior in which law enforcement agents act upon mob agents as impersonal threats and not as human beings. Such action is heightened in which law enforcement agents are monolithic, across race and ethnicity, as law enforcement will become more susceptible to framing the disorder as a confrontation between &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us.&quot;

Actions by law enforcement agents, motivated by emotion and prejudice, is often used as evidence against their ill will toward a crowd, or a mob, with their behavior only further inflaming confrontation rather than reducing it.

Under such situations, law enforcement agents are rarely held accountable for all their actions against a crowd.

<doc id="329908" wikidata="Q313588" url="?curid=329908" title="Oliver Reed">
<text>Robert Oliver Reed (13 February 1938 – 2 May 1999) was an English actor, known for his upper-middle class, macho image and his heavy-drinking, &quot;hellraiser&quot; lifestyle. His screen career spanned over 40 years, between 1955 and 1999. At the peak of his career, in 1971, British exhibitors voted Reed fifth-most-popular star at the box office.

After making his first significant screen appearances in Hammer Horror films in the early 1960s, his notable film roles included La Bete in &quot;The Trap&quot; (1966), Bill Sikes in &quot;Oliver!&quot; (a film directed by his uncle Carol Reed that won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Picture), Gerald in &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1969), the title role in &quot;Hannibal Brooks&quot; (1969), Urbain Grandier in &quot;The Devils&quot; (1971), Athos in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (1974), Uncle Frank in &quot;Tommy&quot; (1975), Dr. Hal Raglan in &quot;The Brood&quot; (1979), Dolly Hopkins in &quot;Funny Bones&quot; (1995) and Antonius Proximo in &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000).

For playing the old, gruff gladiator trainer in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Gladiator&quot;, in what was his final film, Reed was posthumously nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture in 2000.

The British Film Institute (BFI) stated that &quot;partnerships with Michael Winner and Ken Russell in the mid-[19]60s saw Reed become an emblematic Brit-flick icon&quot;, but from the mid-1970s his alcoholism began affecting his career, with the BFI adding: &quot;Reed had assumed Robert Newton&#x27;s mantle as Britain&#x27;s thirstiest thespian&quot;.

== Early life ==
Robert Oliver Reed was born on 13 February 1938 at 9 Durrington Park Road, Wimbledon, southwest London, to Peter Reed, a sports journalist, and Marcia (née Napier-Andrews). He was the nephew of film director Sir Carol Reed, and grandson of the actor-manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and his mistress, Beatrice May Pinney (who later assumed the name &#x27;Reed&#x27;), she being &quot;the only person who understood, listened to, encouraged and kissed Oliver&quot;. Reed claimed to have been a descendant (through an illegitimate step) of Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia. Reed attended 14 schools, including Ewell Castle School in Surrey. &quot;My father thought I was just lazy,&quot; Reed later said. &quot;He thought I was a dunce.&quot;

Reed claimed he had worked as a boxer, a bouncer, a taxi driver and a hospital porter. He then did his compulsory army service in the Royal Army Medical Corps. &quot;The army helped,&quot; he said later. &quot;I recognized that most other people were actors as well. I was in the peacetime army and they were all telling us youngsters about the war.&quot;

== Career ==
=== Early years (1955-1961) ===
Reed began his acting career as an extra in films. He appeared uncredited in Ken Annakin&#x27;s film &quot;Value for Money&quot; (1955) and Norman Wisdom&#x27;s film &quot;The Square Peg&quot; (1958). Uncredited television appearances included episodes of &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1958), &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Third Man&quot;. He appeared in the documentary &quot;Hello London&quot; (1958).

Reed&#x27;s first break was playing Richard of Gloucester in a six-part BBC TV series &quot;The Golden Spur&quot; (1959). It did not seem to help his career immediately: He was not credited in the films &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Table&quot; (1959), &quot;Upstairs and Downstairs&quot; (1959), directed by Ralph Thomas, &quot;Life Is a Circus&quot; (1960), &quot;The Angry Silence&quot; (1960), &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; (1960) or &quot;Beat Girl&quot; (1960). He played a bouncer in &quot;The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll&quot; (1960) for Hammer Films with which he would become associated; the director was Terence Fisher. Reed was then in &quot;The Bulldog Breed&quot; (1960), another Wisdom film, playing the leader of a gang of Teddy Boys roughing up Wisdom in a cinema.

Reed got his first significant role in Hammer Films&#x27; &quot;Sword of Sherwood Forest&quot; (1960), again directed by Fisher. He went back to small roles for &quot;His and Hers&quot; (1961), a Terry-Thomas comedy; &quot;No Love for Johnnie&quot; (1961) for Ralph Thomas; and &quot;The Rebel&quot; (1961) with Tony Hancock. He played the role of Sebastian in the ITV series &quot;It&#x27;s Dark Outside&quot;, which was popular with teenagers, making him an idol for the first time.

=== Leading man ===
Reed&#x27;s first starring role came when Hammer cast him as the central character in Terence Fisher&#x27;s &quot;The Curse of the Werewolf&quot; (1961). Hammer liked Reed and gave him good supporting roles in the swashbuckler &quot;The Pirates of Blood River&quot; (1962), directed by John Gilling; &quot;Captain Clegg&quot; (1962), a smugglers tale with Peter Cushing; &quot;The Damned&quot; (1963), a science fiction film directed by Joseph Losey; &quot;Paranoiac&quot; (1963), a psycho thriller for director Freddie Francis; and &quot;The Scarlet Blade&quot; (1963); a swashbuckler set during the English Civil War, directed by Gilling, with Reed as a Roundhead.

During this time, he appeared in some ITV &quot;Playhouse&quot; productions, &quot;Murder in Shorthand&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Second Chef&quot; (1962), and guest-starred in episodes of &quot;The Saint&quot;. He also had the lead in a non-Hammer horror, &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; (made 1963, released 1965), directed by Guy Hamilton.

=== Michael Winner and Ken Russell ===
In 1964, he starred in the first of six films directed by Michael Winner, &quot;The System&quot; (known as &quot;The Girl-Getters&quot; in the US). The film was seen by Ken Russell who then cast Reed in the title role of &quot;The Debussy Film&quot; (1965), a TV biopic of French composer Claude Debussy. Reed said this was crucial to his career because &quot;That was the first time I met Ken Russell and it was the first part I had after I&#x27;d had my face cut in a fight and no one would employ me. Everybody thought I was a cripple.&quot; It was also the first time he broke away from villainous roles. &quot;Until that time they thought I was a neolithic dustbin,&quot; said Reed. Reed later said &quot;Hammer films had given me my start and Michael Winner my bread then Ken Russell came on the screen and gave me my art.&quot;

He narrated Russell&#x27;s TV movie &quot;Always on Sunday&quot; (1965). Reed returned to Hammer for &quot;The Brigand of Kandahar&quot; (1965), playing a villainous Indian in an imperial action film for Gilling. He later called it the worst film he ever made for Hammer. He guest-starred in episodes of &quot;It&#x27;s Dark Outside&quot; and &quot;Court Martial&quot;, the latter directed by Seth Holt. He had a regular role in the TV series &quot;R3&quot; (1965). Reed was the lead in a Canadian-British co-production, &quot;The Trap&quot; (1966), co-starring with Rita Tushingham.

Reed&#x27;s career stepped up another level when he starred in the popular comedy film &quot;The Jokers&quot; (1966), his second film with Winner, alongside Michael Crawford. After playing a villain in a horror movie, &quot;The Shuttered Room&quot; (1967), he did a third with Winner, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forget What&#x27;s&#x27;isname&quot; (1967), co-starring with Orson Welles. Reed was reunited with Russell for another TV movie, &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot; (1967), playing Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

=== &quot;Oliver!&quot; and stardom ===

Reed&#x27;s star rose further as a result of playing Bill Sikes in &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1968), alongside Ron Moody, Shani Wallis, Mark Lester, Jack Wild and Harry Secombe, in his uncle Carol Reed&#x27;s screen version of the successful stage musical. It was a huge hit, winning the Academy Award for Best Picture, with Reed receiving praise for his villainous performance.

He was in the black comedy &quot;The Assassination Bureau&quot; (1969) with Diana Rigg and Telly Savalas, directed by Basil Dearden; and a war film for Winner, &quot;Hannibal Brooks&quot; (1969).

More successful than either was his fourth film with Russell, a film version of &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1969), in which he wrestled naked with Alan Bates in front of a log fire. In 1969, Interstate Theatres awarded him their International Star of the Year Award.

&quot;Take a Girl Like You&quot; (1970) was a sex comedy with Hayley Mills based on a novel by Kingsley Amis; &quot;The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun&quot; (1970) was a thriller directed by Anatole Litvak. The following year, Reed appeared in the controversial film &quot;The Devils&quot; (1971), directed by Russell with Vanessa Redgrave.

An anecdote holds that Reed could have been chosen to play James Bond. In 1969, Bond franchise producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were looking for a replacement for Sean Connery and Reed (who had recently played a resourceful killer in &quot;The Assassination Bureau&quot;) was mentioned as a possible choice for the role, with Timothy Dalton and Roger Moore as the other choices. Whatever the reason, Reed was never to play Bond. After Reed&#x27;s death, the &quot;Guardian Unlimited&quot; called the casting decision, &quot;One of the great missed opportunities of post-war British movie history.&quot;
He made a series of action-oriented projects: &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; (1971), a Western shot in Spain with Gene Hackman; &quot;Sitting Target&quot; (1972), a tough gangster film; and &quot;Z.P.G.&quot; (1972), a science fiction film with Geraldine Chaplin. In March 1971, he said he would make a film, &quot;The Offering&quot;, which he would co-write and produce, but it was not made. He did &quot;The Triple Echo&quot; (1972) directed by Michael Apted, and featured Reed alongside Glenda Jackson. Reed also appeared in a number of Italian films: &quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; (1973), with Marcello Mastroianni; &quot;One Russian Summer&quot; (1973) with Claudia Cardinale; and &quot;Revolver&quot; (1973) with Fabio Testi.

He had great success playing Athos in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (1974) for director Richard Lester from a script by George MacDonald Fraser. Reed had an uncredited bit-part in Russell&#x27;s &quot;Mahler&quot; (1974), was the lead in &quot;Blue Blood&quot; (1973) and &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1974), produced by Harry Alan Towers. His next project with Ken Russell was &quot;Tommy&quot;, where he plays Tommy&#x27;s stepfather, based on The Who&#x27;s 1969 concept album, &quot;Tommy&quot;, and starring its lead singer Roger Daltrey. &quot;Royal Flash&quot; (1975) reunited him with Richard Lester and George MacDonald Fraser, playing Otto von Bismarck. He had a cameo in Russell&#x27;s &quot;Lisztomania&quot; (1975).

Reed appeared in &quot;The New Spartans&quot; (1975), then acted alongside Karen Black, Bette Davis, and Burgess Meredith in the Dan Curtis horror film, &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; (1976). He was in &quot;The Sell Out&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Great Scout &amp; Cathouse Thursday&quot; (1976) with Lee Marvin. After &quot;Assault in Paradise&quot; (1977), he returned to swashbuckling in &quot;Crossed Swords&quot; (UK title &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;) (1977), as Miles Hendon alongside Raquel Welch and a grown-up Mark Lester, who had worked with Reed in &quot;Oliver!&quot;, from a script co-written by Fraser.

Reed did &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes&quot; (1978) for Peter Colinson and &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1978) with Winner. He and Jackson were reunited in &quot;The Class of Miss MacMichael&quot; (1978), then he made a film in Canada, &quot;The Mad Trapper&quot;, that was unfinished. Reed returned to the horror genre as Dr. Hal Raglan in David Cronenberg&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;The Brood&quot; and ended the decade with &quot;A Touch of the Sun&quot; (1979), a comedy with Peter Cushing.

=== 1980s ===
After the 1970s, Reed&#x27;s films had less success. He did a comedy for Charles B. Griffith, &quot;Dr. Heckyl and Mr. Hype&quot; (1980) and played Gen. Rodolfo Graziani in &quot;Lion of the Desert&quot; (1981), which co-starred Anthony Quinn and chronicled the Senussids resistance to Italian occupation of Libya. On 20 January 2016, ISIS used a clip of &quot;Lion of the Desert&quot; as part of a propaganda video threatening Italy with terrorist attacks.

Reed was a villain in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Condorman&quot; (1981) and did the horror film &quot;Venom&quot; (1981). He was a villain in &quot;The Sting II&quot; (1983) and appeared in &quot;Sex, Lies and Renaissance&quot; (1983). He also starred as Lt-Col Gerard Leachman in the Iraqi historical film &quot;Clash of Loyalties&quot; (1983), which dealt with Leachman&#x27;s exploits during the 1920 revolution in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq). Reed was in &quot;Spasms&quot; (1983), &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; (1983), &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1984), &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; (1985), &quot;Black Arrow&quot; (1985) and &quot;Captive&quot; (1986). He says he was contemplating quitting acting when Nicolas Roeg cast him in &quot;Castaway&quot; (1986) as the middle-aged Gerald Kingsland, who advertises for a &quot;wife&quot; (played by Amanda Donohoe) to live on a desert island with him for a year.

Reed was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1986 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at Rosslyn Park rugby club in west London. Reed was in &quot;The Misfit Brigade&quot; (1987), &quot;Gor&quot; (1987), &quot;Master of Dragonard Hill&quot; (1987), &quot;Dragonard&quot; (1987), &quot;Skeleton Coast&quot; (1988), &quot;Blind Justice&quot; (1988), &quot;Captive Rage&quot; (1988), and &quot;Rage to Kill&quot; (1988). Most of these were exploitation films produced by the impresario Harry Alan Towers filmed in South Africa and released straight to video.

He was in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988) (as the god Vulcan); &quot;The Lady and the Highwayman&quot; (1989) with Hugh Grant; &quot;The House of Usher&quot; (1989); &quot;The Return of the Musketeers&quot; (1990) with Lester and Fraser; &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1990) with Charlton Heston; &quot;A Ghost in Monte Carlo&quot; (1990); &quot;Hired to Kill&quot; (1990); &quot;Panama Sugar&quot; (1990); &quot;The Revenger&quot; (1990); &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; (1991); &quot;Prisoner of Honor&quot; (1991) for Russell; and &quot;Severed Ties&quot; (1993).

=== Later years ===
Films Reed appeared in include &quot;Return to Lonesome Dove&quot; (1993); &quot;Funny Bones&quot; (1995); &quot;The Bruce&quot; (1996); &quot;Jeremiah&quot; (1998); and &quot;Parting Shots&quot; (1998). His final role was the elderly slave dealer Proximo in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000), in which he played alongside Richard Harris, an actor whom Reed admired greatly both on and off the screen. The film was released after his death with some footage filmed with a double, digitally mixed with outtake footage. The film was dedicated to him. In addition to his posthumous BAFTA recognition, he shared the film&#x27;s nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture with the rest of the principal players.

=== Music ===
In addition to acting, Reed released several singles in the popular music vein, though with limited success. These included &quot;Wild One&quot;/&quot;Lonely for a Girl&quot; (1961), &quot;Sometimes&quot;/&quot;Ecstasy&quot; (1962), &quot;Baby It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; (duet with Joyce Blair) and &quot;Wild Thing&quot; (1992) (duet with snooker player Alex Higgins). Reed also later narrated a track called &quot;Walpurgis Nacht&quot; by the Italian heavy metal band Death SS.

== Personal life ==
In 1959, Reed married Kate Byrne. The couple had one son, Mark, before their divorce in 1969. While filming his part of Bill Sikes in &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1968), he met Jacquie Daryl, a classically trained dancer who was also in the film. They became lovers and subsequently had a daughter, Sarah. In 1985, he married Josephine Burge, to whom he remained married until his death. When they met in 1980, she was 16 years old and he was 42. In his final years, Reed and Burge lived in Churchtown, County Cork, Ireland.

In December 1974, Reed appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, a show where the guest, a &quot;castaway&quot;, talks about their life and chooses eight favourite songs and the reasons for their choices. He named &quot;Jardins sous la pluie&quot; by French composer Claude Debussy as his favourite piece of music, and when asked what book and inanimate luxury item he would take with him on a desert island Reed chose &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; by A. A. Milne and an inflatable rubber woman.

=== Activities ===

In 1964, Reed was in the Crazy Elephant nightclub in Leicester Square and got into a dispute at the bar with a couple of men that ended with Reed walking away with a dismissive remark. They waited until he went to the toilet, followed him in and attacked him with broken bottles. He received 63 stitches in one side of his face, was left with permanent scarring, and initially thought his film career was over. According to his brother, subsequent to the attack, when arguing, the burly Reed would bring his hands up in a gesture that was defensive but many men found very intimidating.

In 1993, Reed was unsuccessfully sued by his former stuntman, stand-in and friend Reg Prince, for an alleged spinal injury incurred by the latter while on location for the filming of &quot;Castaway&quot;.

He claimed to have turned down a major role in the Hollywood movie &quot;The Sting&quot; (although he did appear in the 1983 sequel &quot;The Sting II)&quot;. When the 1970s UK government raised taxes on personal income, Reed initially declined to join the exodus of major British film stars to Hollywood and other more tax-friendly locales. In the late 1970s, Reed relocated to Guernsey as a tax exile. He had sold his large house, Broome Hall, between the Surrey villages of Coldharbour and Ockley, and initially lodged at the Duke of Normandie Hotel in Saint Peter Port.

Reed often described himself as a British patriot and preferred to live in the United Kingdom over relocating to Hollywood. He supported British military efforts during the Falklands War. According to Robert Sellers, Reed tried reenlisting, at age 44, in the British Army following the outbreak of the conflict but was turned down.

In 2013, the writer Robert Sellers published &quot;What Fresh Lunacy Is This? – The Authorised Biography of Oliver Reed&quot;.

=== Alcoholism ===

Reed was known for his alcoholism and binge drinking. Numerous anecdotes exist, such as Reed and 36 friends drinking, in one evening: 60 gallons of beer, 32 bottles of scotch, 17 bottles of gin, four crates of wine, and a bottle of Babycham. Reed subsequently revised the story, claiming he drank 106 pints of beer on a two-day binge before marrying Josephine Burge: &quot;The event that was reported actually took place during an arm-wrestling competition in Guernsey, about 15 years ago; it was highly exaggerated.&quot; In the late 1970s, Steve McQueen told the story that, in 1973, he flew to the UK to discuss a film project with Reed, who suggested that the two of them visit a London nightclub. They ended up on a marathon pub crawl throughout the night, during which Reed got so drunk that he vomited on McQueen.

Reed became a close friend and drinking partner of the Who&#x27;s drummer Keith Moon in 1974, while working together on the film version of &quot;Tommy&quot;. With their reckless lifestyles, Reed and Moon had much in common, and both cited the hard-drinking actor Robert Newton as a role model. Sir Christopher Lee, a friend and colleague of Reed, commented on his alcoholism in 2014, saying &quot;when he started, after [drink] number eight, he became a complete monster. It was awful to see.&quot;

Reed was often irritated that his appearances on television chat shows concentrated on his drinking feats rather than his acting career and latest films. On 26 September 1975, while Reed was interviewed by Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Shelley Winters, angered by derogatory comments Reed had made about feminists and women&#x27;s liberation, poured a cup of whiskey over his head on-camera.

Reed was held partly responsible for the demise of BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Sin on Saturday&quot; after some typically forthright comments on the subject of lust, the sin featured on the first programme. The series had many other issues, and a fellow guest revealed that Reed recognised this when he arrived, and virtually had to be dragged in front of the cameras. Near the end of his life, he was brought onto some television series specifically for his drinking; for example, &quot;The Word&quot; put bottles of vodka in his dressing room so he could be secretly filmed getting drunk. According to Reed the whole thing was a stunt (&quot;I knew all about the &#x27;secret&#x27; camera, and the vodka was water&quot;), and that he was paid to &quot;act drunk&quot;. Reed left the set of the Channel 4 television discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot; after arriving drunk and attempting to kiss feminist writer Kate Millett, uttering the phrase, &quot;Give us a kiss, big tits.&quot;

However, &quot;Evil Spirits&quot;, a biography of Reed that was written by Cliff Goodwin, offered the theory that Reed was not always as drunk on chat shows as he appeared to be, but rather was acting the part of an uncontrollably sodden former star to liven things up, at the producers&#x27; behests. In October 1981, Reed was arrested in Vermont, where he was tried and acquitted of disturbing the peace while drunk. However, he pleaded no contest to two assault charges and was fined $1,200. In December 1987, Reed, who was overweight and already suffered from gout, became seriously ill with kidney problems as a result of his alcoholism, and had to abstain from drinking for over a year, on the advice of his doctor.

During the filming of Renny Harlin&#x27;s &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; (1995), he was cast in a cameo role as Mordechai Fingers. Due to his arriving extremely intoxicated, having already been in trouble for a bar fight, before attempting to &quot;expose himself&quot; to lead actress Geena Davis, he was fired and replaced with British character actor George Murcell.

In his final years, when he lived in Ireland, Reed was a regular in the one-roomed O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bar in Churchtown, County Cork, close to the 13th-century cemetery in the heart of the village where he would be buried.

== Death ==
During a break from filming &quot;Gladiator&quot; in Valletta on the afternoon of 2 May 1999, Reed died from a sudden heart attack at the age of 61. According to &quot;Gladiator&quot; screenwriter David Franzoni, Reed had encountered a group of Royal Navy sailors from HMS &quot;Cumberland&quot; who were on shore leave at a bar and challenged them to a drinking match. He fell ill during the match and collapsed, dying in the ambulance en route to the hospital despite resuscitation efforts by his friends.

Despite his outspoken British patriotism, a funeral for Reed was held in the Irish village of Churchtown, where he had lived during the last years of his life. His body was interred in the village&#x27;s Bruhenny Graveyard, a short distance from the pub he would frequent. The epitaph on his gravestone reads, &quot;He made the air move.&quot;

In 2016, Reed&#x27;s &quot;Gladiator&quot; co-star Omid Djalili said of his death, &quot;[Reed] hadn&#x27;t had a drink for months before filming started... everyone said he went the way he wanted, but that&#x27;s not true. It was very tragic. He was in an Irish bar and was pressured into a drinking competition. He should have just left, but he didn&#x27;t.&quot; Reed had made a number of promises to &quot;Gladiator&quot; director Ridley Scott prior to filming, including that he would not drink during production, which he worked around by only drinking on weekends when filming was not underway. Another &quot;Gladiator&quot; co-star, David Hemmings, was a long-time friend of Reed; Scott stated in 2020, &quot;[David] promised to look after him and said to me [upon his death] &#x27;I&#x27;m really sorry, old boy&#x27;.&quot;

== Aftermath ==
As a result of his death, Reed&#x27;s remaining scenes in &quot;Gladiator&quot; had to be completed using a body double and computer-generated imagery (CGI) techniques. Despite this, he was posthumously nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.

<text>The Siuslaw are an Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest. Their autonym is sha’yuushtl’a.

Today Siuslaw people are enrolled with the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians and the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians located on the southwest Oregon, on the Pacific Coast. 

== Territory ==
Historically, the Siuslaw lived along the Siuslaw River in western Oregon. They had 34 distinct named villages in the 1880s.

== Language ==
The Siuslaw are closely related to the Lower Umpqua (or Kuitsh), and both group spoke dialects of Siuslaw language, a Coast Oregon Penutian language. The Siuslaw language is extinct.

== History ==

The Siuslaw people lived in their villages along the Siuslaw River for centuries until 1860, when they were forcibly removed to an Indian reservation in Yachats, Oregon.

The Siuslaw, Coos, and Lower Umpqua had signed the 1855 Empire Treaty; however, the United States failed to ratify this treaty and lost it until 1916. In 1918, members of these three tribes who were not enrolled in the Confederated Siletz Tribes sued the U.S. federal government in the U.S. Court of Claims for federal recognition. After two decades in 1938, the court ruled against the tribes. They filed suits with the Indian Claims Commission in 1951 and 1952 but were rejected. Despite not having secured recognition, these tribes were included in the 1954 law terminating recognition of more than 61 tribes in Oregon that went into effect in 1966. In 1984, the U.S. Congress recognized the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians through legislation.

<doc id="329913" wikidata="Q669979" url="?curid=329913" title="St. Julian's, Malta">
<text>Saint Julian&#x27;s () is a town in the Eastern Region of Malta. As of 2020, its registered number of inhabitants stands at 13,792. It is situated along the coast, north of the country&#x27;s capital, Valletta. It is known for tourism-oriented businesses, such as hotels, restaurants and nightclubs which are centred mainly in an area known as Paceville.

==Etymology, feast and traditions==
The town is named after its patron saint; Saint Julian who is widely known as Julian the Hospitaller and Julian the Poor whereby he is the patron saint of hunters. Before the reform of the Calendar of Saints, the memorial to St Julian was on 27 January. Nowadays, it is celebrated on 12 February, although in Malta an additional feast, in the spirit of the many summer feasts around the island, is celebrated on the last Sunday of August.

A very particular competition connected with the town&#x27;s feast is known as &quot;ġostra&quot;. This traditional competitive feat involves participants climbing and running as far as possible along a sloping greased pole which is suspended above the sea. The winner is the person to grab one of three flags dangling from the end of the pole, each flag representing a certain prize.

Another tradition connected with the feast of this locality is &quot;&#x27;Musketterija&quot;. Starting in 1982, this tradition sees Hunters firing blank cartridges filled with black powder from the roof of the parish church as the statue of the patron saint is brought out of the church. Many say this tradition is in line with the history of the locality which used to be hunting grounds for the Knights of Malta.

==Location and areas==
The town is located on Malta&#x27;s east coast, north of Valletta and the neighbouing town of Sliema. It is subdivided into informal districts which are Paceville, Ta&#x27; Ġiorni, Tal-Għoqod and St Andrew&#x27;s, as well as the regions surrounding St George&#x27;s Bay, Spinola Bay, Balluta Bay, and Il-Qaliet cliffs. St Julian&#x27;s is a tourist destination, especially popular during the summer months. 

Malta&#x27;s tallest building, the still-under construction Mercury Tower, is located in St. Julian&#x27;s, along with the island&#x27;s previous tallest building, the Portomaso Business Tower.

===History===
====Old Parish Church====

The earliest documentary evidence of this church is of the pastoral visit of Bishop Tommaso Gargallo of 1601, which he says was built in 1580 and was dedicated to Saint Julian. In 1736, when Monsignor Alpheran de Bussan re-visited Saint Julian&#x27;s, he noted that the locality was already known as &quot;Portus Sancti Juliani&quot;, meaning &quot;St Julian&#x27;s port&quot;. In 1854, the 600 or so residents of Saint Julian&#x27;s appealed to the church authority, in order to make it a parish. The chapter at Birkirkara protested strongly against such an application and consequently the application was denied; but it was granted at reapplication in 1891. Dun Guzepp Scerri became the first parish priest.

The parish church was designed by Maltese architect Arturo Zammit and its first stone was laid in 1961. It was used for the first time in 1968 when it was still not fully built. The church welcomed Pope John Paul II on his first visit to Malta on 27 May 1990.

The Millenium Chapel designed by Maltese architect Richard England was inaugurated in 2000. It houses a meditation garden inaugurated in May 2018 as a refuge for contemplation and tranquility right in the heart of the entertainment Zone of Paceville. Built on the initiative and run by Fr Hilary Tagliaferro, this church is run by Augustinian clergy through the Millenium Chapel Foundation.
Until the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, St. Julians was a very peaceful coastal town known for its Latin architecture such as the Spinola Palace and greenery surrounding it. Moreover, Spinola Bay was characterized by its fishermen and farmers dwelling the countryside.

It has seen one of the largest infrastructure developments on the island with many old houses being demolished to construct blocks of apartments. In 2020 plans to develop a tourist Ferry point within Balluta Bay have been met with public concern and protests by individuals, local council and NGOs.

====Spinola Palace====
Because of fear of attacks by Muslims, the northern coastal area remained undeveloped until the diminished attacks after the Great Siege of Malta in 1565. The building of Spinola Palace, coming as it does in 1688, is to be regarded as the stepping stone for the coastal reclamation of San Ġiljan. The palace, together with the surrounding gardens, was built by Fra Paolo Raffaele Spinola for the public entertainment as stated in the inscription above the portico. The palace was enlarged in 1733 through the efforts of Fra Giovanni Battista Spínola, successor to his uncle as rector and Curator of the Abbazia. During the French occupation of these islands in 1798, St Julians was the first town in Malta to be conquered by French troops led by General Claude Henri Vaubois who led the French forces into Spinola Bay.

<doc id="329915" wikidata="Q1200828" url="?curid=329915" title="Supercentenarian">
<text>A supercentenarian, sometimes hyphenated as super-centenarian, is a person who is 110 or older. This age is achieved by about one in 1,000 centenarians. Supercentenarians typically live a life free of significant age-related diseases until shortly before the maximum human lifespan is reached.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;supercentenarian&quot; has been used since 1832 or earlier. Norris McWhirter, editor of &quot;The Guinness Book Of Records&quot;, used the term in association with age claims researcher A. Ross Eckler Jr. in 1976, and the term was further popularised in 1991 by William Strauss and Neil Howe in their book &quot;Generations&quot;.

The term &quot;semisupercentenarian&quot;, has been used to describe someone aged 105-109. Originally the term &quot;supercentenarian&quot; was used to mean someone well over the age of 100, but 110 years and over became the cutoff point of accepted criteria for demographers.

==Incidence==
The Gerontology Research Group maintains a top 30–40 list of oldest verified living people. The researchers estimate, based on a 0.15% to 0.25% survival rate of centenarians until the age of 110, that there should be between 300 and 450 living supercentenarians in the world. A study conducted in 2010 by the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research found 663 validated supercentenarians, living and dead, and showed that the countries with the highest total number (not frequency) of supercentenarians (in decreasing order) were the United States, Japan, England plus Wales, France, and Italy. The first verified supercentenarian in human history was Dutchman Geert Adriaans Boomgaard (1788–1899), and it was not until the 1980s that the oldest verified age surpassed 115.

==History==
While claims of extreme age have persisted from the earliest times in history, the earliest supercentenarian accepted by Guinness World Records is Dutchman Thomas Peters (reportedly c. 1745–1857). However, Peters&#x27;s age cannot be reliably verified due to an absence of any documents recording his early life. Other scholars, such as French demographer Jean-Marie Robine, consider Geert Adriaans Boomgaard, also of the Netherlands, who turned 110 in 1898, to be the first verifiable case, as the alleged evidence for Peters has apparently been lost. The evidence for the 112 years of Englishman William Hiseland (reportedly 1620–1732) does not meet the standards required by Guinness World Records.

Church of Norway records, the accuracy of which is subject to dispute, also show what appear to be several supercentenarians who lived in the south-central part of present-day Norway during the 16th and 17th centuries, including Johannes Torpe (1549–1664), and Knud Erlandson Etun (1659–1770), both residents of Valdres, Oppland.

In 1902, Margaret Ann Neve, born in 1792, became the first verified female supercentenarian.

Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 aged 122 years, 164 days, had the longest human lifespan documented. The oldest man ever verified is Jiroemon Kimura of Japan, who died in 2013 aged 116 years and 54 days.

Inah Canabarro Lucas (born 8 June 1908) of Brazil is the world&#x27;s oldest living person, aged . João Marinho Neto (born 5 October 1912) of Brazil is the world&#x27;s oldest living man, aged .

==Research into centenarians==

Research into centenarians helps scientists understand how an ordinary person might live longer.

Organisations that research centenarians and supercentenarians include the GRG, LongeviQuest, and the Supercentenarian Research Foundation.

In May 2021, whole genome sequencing analysis of 81 Italian semi-supercentenarians and supercentenarians were published, along with 36 control group people from the same region who were simply of advanced age.

==Morbidity==
Research on the morbidity of supercentenarians has found that they remain free of major age-related diseases (e.g., stroke, cardiovascular disease, dementia, cancer, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and diabetes) until the very end of life when they die of exhaustion of organ reserve, which is the ability to return organ function to homeostasis. About 10% of supercentenarians survive until the last three months of life without major age-related diseases, as compared to only 4% of semi-supercentenarians and 3% of centenarians.

By measuring the biological age of various tissues from supercentenarians, researchers may be able to identify the nature of those that are protected from ageing effects. According to a study of 30 different body parts from a 112-year-old female supercentenarian, along with younger controls, the cerebellum is protected from ageing, according to an epigenetic biomarker of tissue age known as the epigenetic clock—the reading is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian. These findings could explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age-related dementia as compared to other brain regions.

A 2021 genomic study identified genetic characteristics that protect against age-related diseases, particularly variants that improve DNA repair. Five variants were found to be significant, affecting STK17A (increased expression) and COA1 (reduced expression) genes. Supercentenarians also had an unexpectedly low level of somatic mutations.

<text>Coos people are an indigenous people of the Northwest Plateau, living in Oregon. They live on the southwest Oregon Pacific coast. Today, Coos people are enrolled in the following federally recognized tribes: 
* Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians of Oregon
* Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon
* Coquille Indian Tribe.

==Language==
The Coosan language family consists of two languages: Hanis (also known as Coos) and Miluk. Both are extinct. The Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw has a language program to revitalize them.

==History==
Their neighbors were Siuslauan, Kalapuyan, and the Umpqua Indians. The total population of Hanis and Miluk Coos in 1780 has been estimated to be around 2,000.

On February 8, 1806, the Coos people were first mentioned by Euro-Americans. William Clark, wintering at Fort Clatsop near the Columbia with Meriwether Lewis and the Corp of Discovery, reported the existence of the &quot;Cook-koo-oose nation&quot;. His journal entry stated: &quot;I saw several prisoners from this nation with the Clatsops and Kilamox, they are much fairer than the common Indians of this quarter, and do not flatten their heads.&quot;

The Coos joined with the Umpqua and Siuslaw tribes and became a confederation with the signing of a Treaty in August 1855. In 1857, the U.S. Government removed the Coos Indians to Port Umpqua. Four years later, they were again transferred to the Alsea Sub-agency at Yachats Reservation where they remained until 1876. In 1876, the sub-agency was handed over to white settlement and the Indians were assigned to relocate to the Siletz Reservation, which created a major disruption among the tribal members. By 1937, their population had dwindled to 55.

In 1972, Hanis and Miluk Coos, along with members of the Kuitsh and Siuslaw tribes, incorporated as the Coos Tribe of Indians. In subsequent years, they began providing food assistance for low-income families and established job placement and drug and alcohol abuse programs.

==Culture==
There were 40–50 villages in the Coos tribes (they lived around the Coos bay and North Bend area). Most of them were hunters, fishermen, and gatherers. For entertainment, they held foot races, canoe races, dice (bone or stick) games, target practice, and also shinny (field hockey).

==Namesakes==
Several Oregon landmarks are named after the tribe, including Coos Bay, the city of Coos Bay, Oregon, and Coos County.

==Notable Coos people==
* Annie Miner Peterson (1860–1939), last speaker of the Miluk language

<doc id="329927" wikidata="Q7305591" url="?curid=329927" title="Redd Kross">
<text>Redd Kross is an American rock band from Hawthorne, California, who had their roots in 1978 in a punk rock band called the Tourists, which was started by brothers Jeff and Steve McDonald while Steve was still in middle school. With the addition of friends Greg Hetson and John Stielow on drums, the band&#x27;s first gig was opening for Black Flag. The band has since released eight albums and three EPs.

==Career==
===Red Cross===
In April 1979, the band had their first practice in the living room of original drummer, John Stielow&#x27;s parent&#x27;s home. They eventually changed the band name to Red Cross, which was allegedly inspired by the masturbation scene in the film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. They soon began working on their 1980 debut self-titled EP. Eventually, Hetson left to join the Circle Jerks (and later Bad Religion) and Reyes left for Black Flag. They appeared on the Posh Boy compilation &quot;The Siren&quot;, and then to complete the lineup on their first full-length album, &quot;Born Innocent&quot;, they assembled a revolving door of musicians including original drummer John Stielow. Full of the brothers&#x27; pop culture obsessions, &quot;Born Innocent&quot; featured odes to Linda Blair (who starred in a television movie of the same name), a cover of &quot;Look on Up at the Bottom&quot; by the Carrie Nations from &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot;, and Charles Manson (whose song &quot;Cease to Exist&quot; they covered). The album also contains nods to Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, Tatum O&#x27;Neal, and Lita Ford. Not long after the release of the album, the group was threatened with a lawsuit from the International Red Cross and changed the spelling of their name to Redd Kross.

===Redd Kross===
In 1984, Redd Kross returned with drummer Dave Peterson to record &quot;Teen Babes from Monsanto&quot;, an album featuring covers. Later that year, lead guitarist Robert Hecker joined the band, as they embarked on tour in support of &quot;Teen Babes from Monsanto&quot;. In that same year, they were featured on the soundtrack of &quot;Desperate Teenage Lovedolls&quot; with their cover of the Brady Bunch Kids&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s a Sunshine Day&quot;.

In 1987, Redd Kross released &quot;Neurotica&quot;.

===1990s===
On February 20, 1990, Redd Kross appeared on Episode 2 of the cult Public-access television show &quot;Decoupage&quot; with Summer Caprice.

In 1990, Redd Kross signed with Atlantic Records, releasing &quot;Third Eye&quot;, and appeared with David Cassidy in the film &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;, and issued several singles, including &quot;Annie&#x27;s Gone&quot;, which had some mild success on college radio.

The album &quot;Phaseshifter&quot; was released in 1993, with new band members Eddie Kurdziel, Gere Fennelly, and Brian Reitzell. The videos for &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Lady In The Front Row&quot; were both shown on MTV&#x27;s 120 Minutes. They toured on &quot;Phaseshifter&quot; for over a year, headlining their own shows as well as tours supporting The Lemonheads and The Spin Doctors in late 1993 and Stone Temple Pilots in 1994.

In 1997, Redd Kross released &quot;Show World&quot;, produced by Chris Shaw (who also produced albums for Weezer and Soul Asylum) and toured supporting The Presidents of the United States of America. The band took an indefinite hiatus after the &quot;Show World&quot; tour, and their future was uncertain after the death of guitarist Eddie Kurdziel on June 6, 1999.

=== 2010s ===
In 2019, Emmy Award–winning television comedy writer Andrew Reich, best known as an Executive Producer on &quot;Friends&quot;, was directing a documentary on the band called &quot;Born Innocent: The Redd Kross Story&quot;.

=== 2020s ===
On June 26, 2020, the band reissued their debut EP on Merge Records.

Steven McDonald and Redd Kross were included in a feature article for the 25th anniversary of TapeOp magazine.

The documentary &quot;Born Innocent: The Redd Kross Story&quot; received its Los Angeles premiere at the Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock Festival on May 23, 2024.

On June 28, 2024, Redd Kross released its 8th studio album, a self-titled double album, featuring singles &quot;Candy Coloured Catastrophe&quot; and &quot;Too Good to Be True.&quot;

The brothers released a memoir, &quot;Now You’re One of Us: The Incredible Story of Redd Kross&quot;, in October 2024, co-written with Dan Epstein and published by Omnibus Press.

==Side projects==

The McDonald brothers collaborated with Astrid McDonald (Jeff&#x27;s daughter with Charlotte Caffey, guitarist for The Go-Go&#x27;s) and Anna Waronker (Steve&#x27;s wife, frontwoman of That Dog) on a side project. Performing as Ze Malibu Kids, they released the album &quot;Sound It Out&quot; in 2002.

Both McDonald brothers appeared with David Cassidy in the comedy film &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;.
==Soundtracks==
Redd Kross songs appear on the soundtracks to &quot;Desperate Teenage Lovedolls&quot;, &quot;Good Burger&quot;, &quot;PCU&quot;, &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot;, &quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot;, and &quot;Varsity Blues&quot;. Their song &quot;1976&quot; plays over the end credits of the 1990 movie &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;. They contributed one song &quot;It&#x27;s a Scream&quot; for the 2000 film &quot;Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday The Thirteenth&quot; but the soundtrack was never released and the song itself wasn&#x27;t heard until it appeared on &quot;Hot Issue&quot; in 2016. The song &quot;Uglier&quot; was licensed and used in the film &quot;Hits&quot; by David Cross.

<text>The Iceland gull (Larus glaucoides) is a medium-sized gull that breeds in the Arctic regions of Canada and Greenland, but not in Iceland (as its name suggests), where it is only seen during winter. The genus name is from Latin &quot;larus&quot;, which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird. The specific name &quot;glaucoides&quot; denotes its resemblance to &quot;Larus glaucus&quot;, a synonym of &quot;Larus hyperboreus&quot;, the glaucous gull; &quot;-oides&quot; is Ancient Greek and means &quot;resembling&quot;.

==Description==
The Iceland gull is a medium-sized gull, although relatively slender and light in weight. In length, it can measure from , wingspan is from , and weight is from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is , and the tarsus is . It is smaller and thinner-billed than the very large glaucous gull, and is usually smaller than the herring gull. It takes four years to reach maturity.
==Call==
The call is a &quot;laughing&quot; cry like the herring gull, but higher pitched.

==Ecology==
It is migratory, wintering from in the North Atlantic as far south as the British Isles and northernmost states of the eastern United States, as well as in the interior of North America as far west as the western Great Lakes. It is much scarcer in Europe than the similar glaucous gull.

This species breeds colonially or singly on coasts and cliffs, making a nest lined with grass, moss, or seaweed on the ground or cliff. Normally, two or three light brown eggs are laid. They breed in Canada and Greenland, but not in Iceland.

Like most &quot;Larus&quot; gulls, these are omnivores, eating fish, molluscs, offal, scraps, and eggs. They forage while flying, picking up food at or just below the water&#x27;s surface, and they also feed while walking or swimming. Their scavenging habits lead them to frequent garbage dumps, sewage outlets, and places where fish are cleaned.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The American taxon of Iceland gull by the American Ornithological Society as of 2017 considers the following as subspecies:
* Kumlien&#x27;s gull, &quot;L. g. kumlieni&quot;
* Thayer&#x27;s gull, &quot;L. g. thayeri&quot;

The nominate subspecies, &quot;L. g. glaucoides&quot;, is very pale in all plumage, with absolutely no melanin in the tips of the primaries in adult plumage. Adults are pale grey above, with a yellowish-green bill. Immatures are very pale grey; the bill is more extensively dark than with glaucous gull, and lacks pink.

<doc id="329930" wikidata="Q3612530" url="?curid=329930" title="Alley Theatre">
<text>Alley Theatre is a Tony Award-winning theatre company in Houston, Texas. It is the oldest professional theatre company in Texas and the third oldest resident theatre in the United States. Alley Theatre productions have played on Broadway at Lincoln Center, toured more than 40 American cities, and played internationally in Berlin, Paris, and St. Petersburg.

==History==

Under the leadership of Nina Eloise Whittington Vance (1914–1980), Alley Theatre was founded in 1947 in a &quot;former dance studio with an opening on Main Street. A brick corridor led from Main to the back of the studio, hence the name Alley Theatre.&quot; In 1948, early paying members scouted Houston for a new location for the Alley, finally landing on an abandoned fan factory on Berry Avenue. The Alley re-opened on February 8, 1949, with a production of Lillian Helman&#x27;s &quot;The Children’s Hour&quot;.

In 1954, Ms. Vance brought in Albert Dekker to guest-star in &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;. The Alley then became a fully professional/Equity company.

The United States State Department invited Alley Theatre to represent the American Regional Theatre at the Brussels World&#x27;s Fair in 1958.

In 1962, the Houston Endowment gifted land worth $800,000 and grants worth $2.5 million were awarded to the Alley from the Ford Foundation for the new building at 615 Texas Ave. In the summer of 1963, the theatre raised more than $900,000 from Houstonians. These funds helped the theatre grow from its modest beginnings into one of the most prestigious non-profit resident theatres in the United States.

Paul Zindel&#x27;s &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds&quot; was staged at the Alley in 1964 and in 1971 Zindel won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work.

In 1996, Alley Theatre won the Regional Theatre Tony Award and has toured 40 American cities and abroad. and is regarded as “one of the most respected resident companies in the country.”

In 1977, Nina Vance was invited on the State Department tour of Russian theater, which led to an invitation from Nina to Galina Volchek, director of the Sovremennik Theater of Moscow, to come to Houston to produce Mikhail Roschin’s play, &quot;Echelon&quot;. This marked the first time a Russian had been invited to the U.S. to recreate a play precisely as it appeared in the Soviet Union.

Having forged alliances with such international luminaries as Edward Albee, Vanessa Redgrave and Frank Wildhorn, landmark theatrical events at the Alley have included the world premieres of &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;, &quot;The Civil War&quot;, and in 1998, &quot;Not About Nightingales&quot; a newly discovered play by Tennessee Williams, which moved to Broadway in 1999 and was nominated for six Tony Awards, including Best Play.

The Alley is currently led by Artistic Director Rob Melrose and Managing Director Dean R. Gladden.

&quot;Texas Monthly&quot; writes, no other theatre &quot;in Texas comes close&quot; to the Alley and its &quot;productions often rival Broadway in quality, thanks to its resident acting company (one of the few left in the country) and top-to-bottom production staff.&quot;

On March 1, 2011, Alley Theatre was awarded a Texas Medal of Arts Award by the Texas Cultural Trust, bestowed upon Texas leaders and luminaries in the arts and entertainment industry for creative excellence and exemplary talent.

The theatre was completely renovated in the mid-2010s but was flooded by Hurricane Harvey and sustained the worst damage of any Houston theatre. The Neuhaus Theatre, located on the building&#x27;s basement level, was filled with seventeen feet of water. The company&#x27;s prop storage, containing close to 100,000 props, was completely destroyed. In response to Harvey, the company commissioned a touring children&#x27;s play that was performed throughout Houston area schools.

== Building ==
The opening of the new home of Alley Theatre in November 1968 was a nationally chronicled event. It has two stages – the Hubbard Stage, which has 774 seats, and the more intimate Neuhaus Stage, which has 296 seats.
The Alley&#x27;s building at 615 Texas Ave. was designed by Ulrich Franzen, who, along with Ms. Vance, wanted to create “a building that sings from any viewpoint.” The theatre building has no right angles but does have wide bands and terraces and is “reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright’s buildings.” Franzen selected the concrete exterior because he was inspired by Houston&#x27;s location and the warm weather of the Southwest. There are three triangles in the main building and “the curves cling to and move around the triangles.”

Franzen designed the Alley in what is known as the Brutalist style, which was popular from the 1950s through the mid-1970s. The term “brutalism” was coined in 1953 and comes from the French béton brut meaning &quot;raw concrete&quot;. Concrete is the material most widely associated with Brutalist architecture.

The Alley&#x27;s building is among many famous Brutalist structures, including Washington D.C.&#x27;s L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, the J. Edgar Hoover Building, and the Metro stations (WMATA), Yale University’s Art and Architecture Building, Boston City Hall, the FBI Academy, and the Royal National Theatre (London).

The new Alley Theatre became “the most modern, elastic theatre house in the world for the dramatic arts” thanks to Yale University professor George Izenour’s first-of-its-kind light grid, adjustable walls and analogue recorder. The tension wire grid, which Izenour described as similar to a bedspring, was made of a couple miles of aircraft cable, which formed a mesh 19 feet above the stage, allowing lighting technicians to easily walk on it before shows to adjust lighting and eliminated the need for footlights, spotlights and curtains.

Houston architect Preston Bolton wrote of Franzen and the Alley building, &quot;I believe the architect, Ulrich Franzen, has created a most successful building for the Alley Theatre – one that will receive much recognition for the city, and enhance the excellent productions that are to come.”

Newsweek wrote about the new Alley Theatre, “the most striking theatre in the U.S. … another step along the road toward ending Broadway’s domination of the American theatre,” and Sydney Johnson of The Montreal Star wrote, &quot;… it looks as though the new Alley Theatre is going to be one of the best – and probably the very best – in the U.S. at least, simply because the building has been designed to house a specified stage and auditorium instead of the other way round.&quot;
The new theater was deemed &quot;a very successful statement of both theatrical and architectural values&quot; and was cited by the American Institute of Architects as “inside and out, a brilliant theatrical event.” Of the Brutalist theatres built in the 1960s, including the Vivian Beaumont at Lincoln Center, Arena Stage in Washington D.C., Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, and the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, only the Alley Theatre&#x27;s architect, Franzen, won the national Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects for designing the theatre (1972).

In 1994, Alley Theatre was chosen to receive the Twenty-Five Year Award by the American Institute of Architects/Houston, which recognizes distinguished architecture of lasting quality.

In 1996, the Alley was featured in the “&quot;Book of American Architecture: 500 Notable Buildings from the 10th Century to Present&quot; by G. E. Kidder Smith.

In June 2001, Tropical Storm Allison severely damaged the Neuhaus Stage located on the basement level of the theatre. The flood destroyed the theatre&#x27;s costume, props, and scenic shops. The theatre was flooded with 14 feet of water.

In 2002, the Alley unveiled its new Center for Theatre Production, a 75,000-square-foot facility. It is adjacent to the main theatre building.

The &quot;Houston Press&quot;, along with others like the George R. Brown Convention Center, ranked the building as one of the ten least photogenic buildings in Downtown Houston. John Nova Lomax, the author of the list, commented &quot;Yeah, yeah, I like the curves and all that, but this concrete hulk still looks like something Stalin’s favorite architect would have come up with on ‘shrooms.&quot;

In 2017, Hurricane Harvey brought massive flooding to the greater Houston region. Flood improvements made by the Alley after Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, such as flood doors on the basement level, held. However, water entered the Alley basement through an electrical box located in the theatre&#x27;s driveway. The Alley Theatre&#x27;s Neuhaus Stage was flooded with 17 feet of water and most of the theatre&#x27;s prop collection, dating back to the 1940s, was destroyed. A massive renovation was undertaken and the theatre re-opened 2 months later in time for its annual production of A Christmas Carol.

== Building renovation ==
In 2013–2015, the Alley underwent a $46.5 million building renovation, the first major improvements since the building opened in 1968, including major improvements to the Hubbard Theatre, backstage area, and public spaces. The renovation was funded by private and public contributions to the Alley through the Extended Engagement Capital Campaign. Improvements included the installation of a new four-story fly loft, creation of a fully trapped stage floor allowing for an orchestra pit and actor and scenery entrances/exits, and a more intimate relationship between the audience&#x27;s seating area and the stage. New audience amenities included new seats, expanded restrooms and a new lobby space with a skyline view. With more than 350 performances annually, the Alley produces more performances than all other performing arts organizations in the Houston Theater District combined. Alley Theatre&#x27;s historic renovation of the Hubbard Theatre opened to the public on October 2, 2015, with &quot;One Man, Two Guvnors&quot;.

== TYPE ==
The Alley sponsors what is known as the Texas Young Playwrights Exchange (TYPE), which offers a skills-enhancing experience for people under the age of twenty who want to write for the stage.

<doc id="329935" wikidata="Q5164280" url="?curid=329935" title="Constitutional Commission">
<text>A constitutional commission is a body of commissioners appointed by a government for the purpose of making or revising a constitution. The commissioners are typically experts. However, in a country governed by a military regime, the commissioners may be actual or alleged experts whose political opinions match those of that government, and in other countries there may perceptions or allegations that the commissioners include such persons. The commission may be advisory or preparatory to another body or to a referendum.

A number of bodies have been called a Constitutional Commission.

==Afghanistan==
*Afghan Constitution Commission
**Timeline of the War in Afghanistan (August 2003)
*Reigns of Nadir Shah and Zahir Shah

== Australia ==
In 1985 a Constitutional Commission was established (by the Hawke Labor government) to review the Australian Constitution and reported in 1988. It was seen as too partisan by many Liberals and the eventual referendum questions were not supported; leading to the lowest &#x27;yes&#x27; vote count for any referendum in Australia (in 1988).

== Canada ==
The federally initiated Rowell–Sirois Commission of 1937 to 1940 recommended (successfully) that the federal government take over unemployment insurance and pensions from the provinces.

The Quebec-initiated Royal Commission of Inquiry on Constitutional Problems of 1953 to 1956 argued (unsuccessfully) for the devolution of more powers to the Province of Quebec.

The federal Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism recommended (successfully) that Canada become officially bilingual and bicultural (later modified to &quot;multi&quot;cultural).

==Philippines==
In January 1942, the Philippine Executive Commission, or PEC, was established as the temporary caretaker government of the City of Greater Manila, and eventually, of the whole Philippines during the Japanese occupation of the country during World War II. The PEC existed until the Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic was established in October 1943.

In 1986, President Corazon Aquino dissolved the 1973 Constitution and called for its revision. From February 1986 to February 1987, the Philippines was governed under a provisional constitution called the &quot;Freedom Constitution&quot;, which was drafted by her Executive Secretary Joker Arroyo. In September 1986, the Constitutional Commission of 1986 was set up with all its members appointed by Aquino. The revised Philippine Constitution was ratified by a plebiscite with 76% of votes in the affirmative.

An unrelated concept is a &quot;constitutional commission&quot;, which is a commission created by the 1987 Constitution. These are governmental bodies that are independent of the three main branches of government. These constitutional commissions are the:
*Civil Service Commission
*Commission on Audit
*Commission on Elections

The 1987 Constitution does not place upon a constitutional commission the task of amending the Constitution—that task falls to the Constitutional Convention, the Constituent Assembly, or the People&#x27;s Initiative, the three constitutionally sanctioned methods of amending the Constitution.

==Scotland==

==Seychelles==
*Seychelles Constitutional Commission, established in 1992

==Tanzania==
*Tanzanian Constitutional Review Commission

*Constitutional convention (political meeting)

<doc id="329938" wikidata="Q2065280" url="?curid=329938" title="Umpqua people">
<text>The Umpqua people are an umbrella group of several distinct tribal entities of Native Americans of the Umpqua Basin in present-day south central Oregon in the United States. The area south of Roseburg is now known as the Umpqua Valley.

At least four tribal groups have historically lived in the Umpqua River Basin: the Southern Molalla, the Lower Umpqua tribe, the Upper Umpqua tribe, and the Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua Tribe of Native Americans. Before European settlement in the region, the tribes spoke several different languages, including Siuslaw (Lower Umpqua), Yoncalla (Southern Kalapuya), Upper Umpqua, Takelma, and the Molalla language.

Archaeological evidence indicates that the Native American settlement in the Umpqua region began at least 8,000 years before the arrival of European settlers. The name &quot;Umpqua&quot; likely derives from a Tolowa word for &quot;a place along the river.&quot; Other theories report that &quot;Umpqua&quot; means &quot;thundering water,&quot; &quot;dancing water&quot; or &quot;bring across the river.&quot;

==Overview==
=== Lower Umpqua ===
The Lower Umpqua (Kuitsh) tribe spoke the Lower Umpqua (Kuitsh/Quuiič) dialect of the Siuslaw language. Their self-designation was Kuitsh, Quuiič or Quuiich (″The Southern People″, probably derived from the words &quot;qiiuu&quot;, ″south″, and &quot;hiich&quot;, ″people″). Prior to European settlement, the Lower Umpqua (Kuitsh) lived on the coast from Siltcoos River south to Tenmile Creek.

Today, the &quot;Lower Umpqua (Kuitsh) people&quot; are represented by the following tribes:
* Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians 
* Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, and
* Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon

=== Upper Umpqua ===
The Upper Umpqua people lived mostly on the South Umpqua River, near present Roseburg, Oregon and the Umpqua River upstream of the head of tide (present-day Scottsburg, Oregon). Their self-designation was Etnemitane, Tl&#x27;uu-dv-nee-yu (literally &quot;prairie people&quot;) or simply Dv-nee-yu / Dv-ne (&quot;people&quot;). The now-extinct Upper Umpqua language formed with three other closely related languages the ″Oregon Athabaskan cluster″ of the Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages.

By neighboring Athapascan-speaking peoples they were known as ″Umpqua River People″—in the original languages:
:* Tututni and (Upper) Coquille-Tututni: Ci-cta-́qwût-mê ́ t̟ûn-nĕ
:* Chasta Costa-Tututni: Ci-stá-qwŭt dv-nee-yu
:* Naltunne-Tututni: Cac-taⁿ-́qwût me-́t̟ûn-nĕ
:* Chetco-Tolowa: Ûm-́kwa-me (origin of the English word &quot;Umpqua&quot;)

Today, the &quot;Upper Umpqua people&quot; are represented by the following tribes:
* Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon
* Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, and 
* Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians

=== Cow Creek Band of Upper Umpqua ===
Originally a band of the Takelma people along the South Umpqua River, Myrtle Creek, and Cow Creek, the Cow Creek people were called Cow Creek Takelma, or The Cow Creek Band.

Today, the &quot;Cow Creek Band of Upper Umpqua&quot; are represented by the following tribes:
* Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Native Americans
* Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians, and
* Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon

The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Native Americans is one of nine federally recognized indigenous Tribal Governments in the State of Oregon. They were the first tribes in the Oregon Territory to sign a treaty with the US government, on 19 September 1853. As a result of the treaty, the Cow Creek Tribe became a landless tribe, ceding more than 800 square miles of Southwestern Oregon to the United States. The Cow Creek Tribe never received the reservation their treaty promised, but even without a reservation, the people remained in their homelands.

=== Southern Molalla ===
The Molala were living along the Deschutes River. They later moved to the headwaters of the Umpqua River and Rogue River.

Today, the &quot;Molalla people&quot; are represented by the following tribes:
* Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon (with 141 of the 882 members in the 1950s claiming Molalla descent)
* Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, and
* Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians

==History==
The Native Americans who lived in the Umpqua region prior to European settlementwere highly dependent on the annual cycle of nature. Their cultures were rich and complex, with distinct rituals, rites and responsibilities. In winter, the people lived in cedar plank houses in permanent villages. Here they made baskets, clothing, tools, and weapons, and recounted a wide variety of stories including creation stories and tales of a magical time when animals and humans shared the same language. In the spring, summer, and fall, they went to seasonal camps to take advantage of seasonally-abundant food resources.The first known contact with whites was with fur trappers in the late 1700s. In the 1820s, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company began intensive trapping of beavers and regular trade with the Native Americans in the Umpqua Basin.Relations with fur trappers were generally good, although there were occasional skirmishes. An especially notorious conflict occurred in 1828 between the Lower Umpqua Indians and a party of fur traders led by Jedediah Smith.  Due perhaps to inappropriate advances of Smith&#x27;s men toward Indian women, or due perhaps to the alleged theft of an ax by a young Native American, a Lower Umpqua man was killed by Smith&#x27;s party, for which the Lower Umpquas retaliated and killed 15 of the 19 of Smith&#x27;s men.

<text>Auckland Grammar School (often simplified to Auckland Grammar, or Grammar), established in 1869, is a state, day and boarding secondary school for boys in Auckland, New Zealand. 

The school was originally situated on Howe Street in Freeman’s Bay, where Auckland Girls Grammar School is now located. It moved to its current site on Mountain Road in Epsom in 1916. As of 2020, it has 2606 students, making it the third largest school in New Zealand. The current headmaster, Tim O’Connor, who was appointed in 2012, received a Blake Leader Award in 2007.

== History ==

Auckland Grammar School was endowed in 1850 by the then Governor of New Zealand, Sir George Grey. 

Sir George Grey, during his times as governor in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand is also affiliated with the establishment of other educational institutions such as Whanganui Collegiate School in Whanganui, New Zealand, Grey College in Bloemfontein, South Africa, and Grey High School in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.

Auckland Grammar was recognised as an educational establishment in 1868 through the Grammar School Appropriation Act. It officially opened in 1869 in the old Immigration Barracks site on Howe Street with 78 boys enrolled. The school was initially privately funded, as New Zealand did not have a state education system until 1877.

A growing roll caused the school to move twice in the 1870s, and in 1880, it moved to Symonds Street, where it remained for 35 years. The site today houses the University of Auckland’s School of Architecture. Due to the economic impact of the 1880s depression, girls from Girls High School joined what was by then called the Auckland College and Grammar School. In 1909, Auckland Girls Grammar School opened on the original Howe Street site, and the renamed Auckland Grammar School became an all-boys school again. In 1916, the school moved to its current location in Mountain Road, Epsom, which was opened by Governor General Arthur Foljambe the Earl of Liverpool.

Auckland Grammar School buildings contain two Category I historic places, the school&#x27;s main block and a war memorial, and one Category II historic place, the former janitor&#x27;s house. An obelisk located in front of the school commemorates former students who fought in various wars. The school&#x27;s main block, built in 1916 in the Spanish Mission style, is used for daily assemblies and exhibitions, and it also contains classrooms on its two levels. Surrounding the main hall in which students sit for daily assemblies are the school honours boards, listing the names of the school&#x27;s top scholars.

In the early 20th century, inmates from the neighbouring Mount Eden Prison worked at two stone quarries adjacent to the school and were involved in the construction of the 1916 school building itself. Early prisoners were used as labourers to quarry stone for use in road construction around Auckland, including the quarries at Maungawhau / Mount Eden and Auckland Grammar School. The flat land was redeveloped into sports fields for Auckland Grammar School. 

The school owns a facility called the VentureLodge located in the township of Ohakune, in the central North Island, which is used by students for camps.

The school&#x27;s motto is in , which translates to &quot;Through difficulties to greatness&quot;. The school has also translated the motto as &quot;Through rough ravines to hallowed heights.&quot; The origin of the motto is uncertain, but it was a common maxim at the time of the school&#x27;s founding.

A documentary on the school titled &quot;Grammar Boys &quot;was aired in July 2005 on TV3.

== Architecture ==

The main building was constructed in 1916, designed by the architectural firm of Arnold &amp; Abbott. It and the adjacent caretaker&#x27;s residence are designed in the Spanish Mission style. Following the completion of the main building, three smaller buildings were constructed in the same style; the library block to the north, the gymnasium to the south and a toilet block adjoining the main building. The main building is listed by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I Historic Place.

In the 1950s, a large science block was constructed to the south of the main block in a modern style with metal windows. Further to the south again is a concrete block built in the early 1970s, raised on pilotis to give access to the upper playing fields. Between it and the 1920 gymnasium is a large gymnasium which was constructed in the mid-1970s and opened by then Prime Minister Robert Muldoon.

Adjacent to the Spanish Mission-style library from the 1920s is the Centennial Theatre (opened 1969) and the swimming pool. This abuts the Motorway, the construction of which, in the 1960s, removed some of the School&#x27;s land to the north. Between the 1970s and 2014-2015, a complex of &#x27;prefabs&#x27; adjacent to the Mountain Road boundary evolved, built to house the increasing roll. Following the development of a new classroom block in 2015, these have now been almost entirely removed. The loss of playing space on the upper part of the school property meant new sports fields needed to be created in two former quarries at a lower level than the original school. Each has a sports pavilion. The pavilion on the upper field was rebuilt soon after.

Between 2014 and 2015, the toilet block adjoining the main building was demolished and a new building constructed in its place for classroom use.

The school’s 150th century anniversary capital project is Te Ara Matauranga. Te Ara plans to include a new library, swimming pool and study block located in between the Centennial Theatre and the War Memorial.

== Enrolment ==

Historically, entry was selective to the school. The school was zoned at least since the 1960s. Since 2000, school zoning is determined by a state school enrollment scheme, which gives first preference to students living in a designated home zone, and then to brothers of current students who live outside the zone. The school argues that zoning increases house prices in the zone, reducing access to the school for students from lower socio-economic groups. Research by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand shows there is a 30 percent premium ($257,000) on houses in-zone compared to those out of zone. In 2014, nearby One Tree Hill College and Selwyn College introduced enrolment schemes which initially planned to overlap parts of the Auckland Grammar zone. Both were forced to backtrack after opposition from parents in the overlapping areas, who feared it could ultimately lead to Auckland Grammar shrinking its zone and affecting the resale value of their homes.

Auckland Grammar&#x27;s requested voluntary donation is the highest for a non-integrated state school in New Zealand. In 2014, the requested donation reached $1,050 per student per year. The school claimed the donation is high to cover the gap in government funding between it, a decile 9Q school, and the lowest decile schools (i.e. decile 1A). As a comparison, Auckland Grammar&#x27;s female counterpart, Epsom Girls&#x27; Grammar School, asks for a donation of $665, despite also being decile 9Q.

International students are tested for English language proficiency and some students may be required to complete an intensive course of English language before starting at Auckland Grammar School. The international students at Auckland Grammar School paid the highest tuition fees in New Zealand state schools at more than $20,000 each year.

== Education ==
As a state school, Auckland Grammar School is required to follow the New Zealand Curriculum (NZC).

=== Results ===
In 2015, 95.1 percent of students leaving Auckland Grammar held at least NCEA Level 1 or IGCSE, 91.6 percent held at least NCEA Level 2 or AS level, and 81.5 percent held at least NCEA Level 3 or A level. This is compared to 87.1%, 76.3%, and 45.8% respectively for boys nationally.

In its regular survey of Auckland’s schools, &quot;Metro&quot; in 2011 reported that Auckland Grammar’s academic results are comparable with most private schools and that it scores very well in the National Scholarship exams. In its 2016 report, the Education Review Office reported that the school continued to achieve high-education outcomes for its students. It was ranked seventh in the Crimson-QS Best New Zealand schools in 2019 for entrance into top-ranked universities.

=== NCEA ===
The previous headmaster, John Morris, is a vocal critic of NCEA. In response to what is perceived by the school to be a poorly designed system being forced on them, the school introduced Cambridge International Examinations in 2002, offering the IGCSE, AS Level and A2 examinations to its more talented students. Other students sit NCEA exams. Students placed in an IGCSE/AS/A2 class are allowed to switch to NCEA, but this is usually discouraged by the school. However, in the ensuing years the majority of students were encouraged to take part in CIE qualifications. The introduction of New Zealand Scholarship has been viewed sceptically by the school, and it encourages only the top students to attempt it. Despite this, the school had the highest number of scholarships of any school in New Zealand in 2006.
The 2008 Education Review Office (ERO) report commented the School ranks among the highest performing schools in New Zealand from the results in national and international examinations. From 2011, the school offered the CIE Form 5 programme to all students in Form 5. From 2019, the School replaced all external examinations (both Cambridge IGCSE and NCEA Level 1) for Fifth Formers with an in-house preparatory qualification, Pre-Q, set to be &quot;more rigorous than IGCSE&quot;, in response to planned reforms to NCEA, abolishing external examinations at Level 1.

The school song was introduced in March 1955. The words were composed in 1954 by L. W. A. Crawley, senior Classics lecturer at Auckland University College (now the University of Auckland). The song consists of two verses in Latin and includes the school motto as a refrain. It is sung to the melody of the German hymn &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot; (&quot;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God&quot;).
