<text>Lutte Ouvrière (&quot;Workers&#x27; Struggle&quot;; ) is a Trotskyist communist party in France, named after its weekly paper. Arlette Laguiller was the party&#x27;s spokeswoman from 1973 to 2008 and ran in each presidential election until 2012, when Nathalie Arthaud was the candidate. Robert Barcia (Hardy) was its founder and central leader. Lutte Ouvrière is a member of the Internationalist Communist Union. It emphasises workplace activity and has been critical of such recent phenomena as alter-globalization.

== History ==
Its origins lie in the tiny Trotskyist Group founded in 1939 by David Korner (Barta). This developed factory work throughout the war and was instrumental in the Renault strike of 1947, along with the anarcho-syndicalists. The group was exhausted by this effort and collapsed in 1952.

After attempts to revive the Trotskyist Group, Voix Ouvrière was founded in 1956 by Robert Barcia, known as Hardy and the group&#x27;s pre-eminent leader, and by Pierre Bois, a leading activist in the Renault plant. Effort was made to involve Barta but disputes between him, Hardy and Bois prevented it.

VO established itself through the 1960s by producing mass factory bulletins, usually weekly. The Communist Party of France (PCF) retained its hegemonic position within the workers&#x27; movement in France and its members sometimes tried to prevent the distribution of VO bulletins. In part this explains the continued use of semi-clandestine operation within VO and in LO today.

After being banned due to its support of the Students Revolt of May &#x27;68, the group became Lutte Ouvrière.

== Since the 1970s ==
An ongoing issue is the possibility and conditions of cooperation with fellow Trotskyist party the Revolutionary Communist League, the French section of the Fourth International. In 1970, LO initiated fusion discussions with the LC (as the LCR was then called). After extensive discussions, the two organisations had agreed the basis for a fused organisation. However, the fusion was not completed. In 1976 discussions between the Ligue and Lutte Ouvrière progressed again. The two organisations started to produce a common weekly supplement to their newspapers, common electoral work and other common campaigning. Since then on occasions the two organizations have stood joint candidates at some elections.

LO has made great efforts to stand in elections either on its own or in an alliance with the LCR. As a result, Arlette Laguiller has become well known to the public as LO&#x27;s perennial presidential candidate. The early 1970s also saw two breakaways from Lutte Ouvrière. The first such split, in 1974 in Bordeaux, took the name l&#x27;Union Ouvrière, but rapidly disintegrated, so much so that when another small split group that developed a year later expected to be able to fuse with l&#x27;Union Ouvrière, it found it had already disappeared and were forced to form their own organisation as a consequence. This new group, Combat Communiste, evolved into Socialisme International, an affiliate of the International Socialist Tendency.

Another more recent breakaway developed after Arlette Laguiller&#x27;s relatively high electoral results in the 1990s and LO&#x27;s statement that this meant that a new workers&#x27; party was a possibility. This statement, as well as a dispute over the personal code members were expected to abide by, led to the departure of over a hundred members to form the Voix des Travailleurs group. This later fused with another smaller group but has more recently joined the Revolutionary Communist League as a recognised faction. In the period up to 2008, a minority faction existed within LO and appeared publicly, although its supporters were segregated in their own cells.

LO has gained critique for their position on the 2004 French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools. André Victor written in his article &quot;Islamic Hijab and the Subjugation of Women&quot; 25 April 2003 that &quot;Sarkozy has spoken out against hijab on passport photos, and presumably earned the approval of millions of voters, which was probably the real purpose of this exercise in demagoguery&quot;. It considers that &quot;The real problem is that wearing the hijab, visible sign of the subjugation of women to their husband, father, brother or men in general, has been the subject of a political campaign of organizations present in fundamentalist migrant groups to impose their law within them, especially women. ... Therefore this policy leads to increase the weight of the most reactionary religious authorities within the immigrant population&quot;. While considering the law as &quot;hypocrite&quot;, LO stated that &quot;For teachers, not accepting hijab, - particularly in the classroom, - means to support women in their family and social environment, attempting to resist the machismo&quot;.

Following the very low score of Arlette Laguiller in the first round of the April–May 2007 presidential election (1,33%, compared to 5,72% in 2002), the party was left with a debt of €1.4 million. According to Michel Rodinson, a party official, the campaign cost was in total €2 million (800,000 of which are paid by the state). The rent of the Zenith for meetings in Paris, as well as the December political poster campaign, account for most of the expenses.
In the local elections in 2008, Lutte Ouvrière broke with tradition by joining the Socialist Party-led slates by the first round of the elections in a number of towns, preferring this tactic to the more usual option of cooperating with other far left groups to run a joint election campaign. Because an organized minority faction called &quot;L&#x27;Étincelle&quot; supported some lists running against lists supported by the party leadership, Lutte Ouvrière suspended the faction from the organization in February 2008; the faction was expelled in September 2008. The faction has agreed to take part in the initial stages of the New Anticapitalist Party set up by the LCR with others, though this may not be a long-term strategy, with one member explaining it as &quot;foot in both camps&quot; strategy.

Unlike in 2004 and 1999, when it ran common lists with the Revolutionary Communist League, LO ran autonomous lists in the 2009 European Parliament election in France. For the 2022 French legislative election, LO announced that the party would run its own slate separate from the New Ecologic and Social People&#x27;s Union, which they believe to be reformist.

==Fête de Lutte Ouvrière==
Another very public activity of LO is their annual fête which is held in the grounds of a chateau which the organisation purchased for that purpose in 1981. The annual Fête de Lutte Ouvrière is probably the largest public gathering of the revolutionary left in Europe.

== Leadership ==

The 2012 presidential candidate, Nathalie Arthaud, is a teacher and was an elected town councillor for Vaulx-en-Velin, in charge of youth matters. Arthaud was also the spokesperson for Arlette Laguiller&#x27;s 2007 presidential campaign. Arlette Laguiller had first run as the LO candidate in 1974, and subsequently in 1981, 1988, 1995, 2002, with 2007 being her last candidacy, and still plays an active part in the leadership of the party. For long, the internal organisations of the party were largely unknown to the general public, the spokeswoman and regular presidential candidate Arlette Laguiller being the only party leader appearing in public. Even to party members, some leaders were known only by cadre names. The party justified such secrecy measures by the possibility that it may have to enter clandestinity, should a highly repressive government take power. For similar reasons, marriages and children were strongly discouraged.

Bernard Seytre, a member of LO for 20 years, confirmed the &quot;iron discipline which rhythms the life of this Trotskyist organisation, whose responsibles [&quot;cadres&quot;] do not have the right to have children, lest they be excluded&quot;.

Lutte Ouvrière was criticised by political opponents in the 2002 presidential campaign as being a political cult, for example by Daniel Cohn-Bendit, his older brother Gabriel Cohn-Bendit, &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; and &quot;Libération&quot;. In part, this strict disciplinary attitude has enabled LO to be a very stable organisation in contrast to the instability that they allege characterises so many other left groups. LO is a difficult organisation to actually join and after becoming a member, individuals are expected to conform to a code of conduct, which is considered old fashioned by some critics.

<text>Benjamin Vautier (; 18 July 1935 – 5 June 2024), also known mononymously as Ben, was a French visual artist.

== Early life ==
Benjamin Vautier was born on 18 July 1935 in Naples, Italy, to a French family. He was the great-grandson of the Swiss painter Benjamin Vautier (1829–1898).

==Career==
Vautier discovered Yves Klein and the Nouveau Réalisme in the 1950s, but he quickly became interested in the French dada artist Marcel Duchamp and the music of John Cage. In 1959, Vautier founded the journal &quot;Ben Dieu&quot;. In 1960, he had his first one-man show, &quot;Rien et tout&quot; in &quot;Laboratoire 32&quot;.

Vautier ran a record shop called &quot;Magazin&quot; between 1958 and 1973. Vautier joined George Maciunas in the Fluxus artistic movement, in October 1962.

Vautier was also active in Mail-Art and was mostly known for his text-based paintings or &quot;écritures&quot;, begun in 1953, with his work &quot;Il faut manger. Il faut dormir&quot; (&quot;One must eat. One must sleep.&quot;). Another example of the latter is &quot;L&#x27;art est inutile. Rentrez chez vous&quot; (&quot;Art is Useless, Go Home&quot;). A notable work made for Harald Szeemann&#x27;s Documenta 5 exhibition in 1972 shouts, &quot;KUNST IST ÜBERFLÜSSIG&quot; (English: &quot;Art is Superfluous&quot;), and was installed across the top of the Fridericianum museum in Kassel, Germany.

Vautier long defended the rights of minorities in all countries, and he was influenced by the theories of François Fontan about ethnism. For example, he defended the Occitan language (southern France).

In 1981, he coined the name of the French art movement of the 1980s Figuration Libre (&quot;Free Figuration&quot;).

In 2010 was published ”INTROSPECTION TRUTH ART &amp; SEX”, the Personal Structures Art Projects Number #07

His work is included in some of the most important collections in the world, including MoMA in New York and Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid. The Centre Pompidou in Paris has Ben Vautier&#x27;s &quot;Magasin&quot; (&quot;Shop&quot;), an enormous piece, on permanent display. In 2022, the MUAC in Mexico City organised one of the most ambitious exhibitions about Vautier, curated by Ferran Barenblit.

==Death==
Vautier died of suicide by firearm on 5 June 2024, at the age of 88, after his wife Annie Vautier had died from a stroke the previous evening.

<doc id="323499" wikidata="Q470040" url="?curid=323499" title="Sammy Cahn">
<text>Samuel Cohen (June 18, 1913 – January 15, 1993), known professionally as Sammy Cahn, was an American lyricist, songwriter, and musician. He is best known for his romantic lyrics to films and Broadway songs, as well as stand-alone songs premiered by recording companies in the Greater Los Angeles Area. He and his collaborators had a series of hit recordings with Frank Sinatra during the singer&#x27;s tenure at Capitol Records, but also enjoyed hits with Dean Martin, Doris Day and many others. He played the piano and violin, and won an Oscar four times for his songs, including the popular hit &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot;.

Among his most enduring songs is &quot;Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!&quot;, cowritten with Jule Styne in 1945.

==Life and career==
Cahn was born Samuel Cohen in the Lower East Side of New York City, the only son (he had four sisters) of Abraham and Elka Reiss Cohen, who were Jewish immigrants from Galicia, then ruled by Austria-Hungary. His sisters, Sadye, Pearl, Florence, and Evelyn, all studied the piano. His mother did not approve of Sammy studying it though, feeling that the piano was a woman&#x27;s instrument, so he took violin lessons. After three lessons and following his bar mitzvah, he joined a small dixieland band called Pals of Harmony, which toured the Catskill Mountains in the summer and also played at private parties. This new dream of Cahn&#x27;s destroyed any hopes his parents had for him to be a professional man.

Some of the side jobs he had were playing violin in a theater-pit orchestra, working at a meat-packing plant, serving as a movie-house usher, tinsmith, freight-elevator operator, restaurant cashier, and porter at a bindery. At age 16, he was watching vaudeville, of which he had been a fan since the age of 10, and he witnessed Jack Osterman singing a ballad Osterman had written. Cahn was inspired and, on his way home from the theater, wrote his first lyric, which was titled &quot;Like Niagara Falls, I&#x27;m Falling for You – Baby.&quot; Years later he would say &quot;I think a sense of vaudeville is very strong in anything I do, anything I write. They even call it &#x27;a vaudeville finish,&#x27; and it comes through in many of my songs. Just sing the end of &#x27;All the Way&#x27; or &#x27;Three Coins in the Fountain&#x27;—&#x27;Make it mine, make it mine, MAKE IT MINE!&#x27; If you let people know they should applaud, they will applaud.&quot;

Much of Cahn&#x27;s early work was written in partnership with Saul Chaplin. They first met when Cahn invited Chaplin to audition for him at the Henry Street Settlement. Cahn said, &quot;I&#x27;d learned a few chords on the piano, maybe two, so I&#x27;d already tried to write a song. Something I called &#x27;Shake Your Head from Side to Side.&#x27;&quot; Billed simply as &quot;Cahn and Chaplin&quot; (in the manner of &quot;Rodgers and Hart&quot;), they composed witty special material for Warner Brothers&#x27; musical short subjects, filmed at Warners&#x27; Vitaphone studio in Brooklyn, New York.

&quot;There was a legendary outfit on West 46th Street, Beckman and Pransky ... they were the MCA, the William Morris of the Borscht Belt. I got a room in their offices, and we started writing special material. For anybody who&#x27;d have us—at whatever price.&quot; They did not make much money, but they did work with up-and-comers Milton Berle, Danny Kaye, Phil Silvers, and Bob Hope.

One of his childhood friends was Lou Levy, who had gone from neighborhood bum to blackface dancer with the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra.Lyric writing has always been a thrilling adventure for me, and something I&#x27;ve done with the kind of ease that only comes with joy! From the beginning the fates have conspired to help my career. Lou Levy, the eminent music publisher, lived around the corner and we met the day I was leaving my first music publisher&#x27;s office. This led to a partnership that has lasted many years. Lou and I wrote &quot;Rhythm is Our Business,&quot; material for Jimmie Lunceford&#x27;s orchestra, which became my &quot;first&quot; ASCAP copyright. I&#x27;d been churning out &quot;special lyrics&quot; for special occasions for years and this helped facilitate my tremendous speed with lyric writing. Many might have written these lyrics better—but none faster! Glen Gray and Tommy Dorsey became regular customers and through Tommy came the enduring and perhaps most satisfying relationship of my lyric writing career – Frank Sinatra. The song became the Orchestra&#x27;s signature song. The duo then worked for Glen Gray&#x27;s Casa Loma Orchestra and their premiere at Paramount Theatre. They also worked for Andy Kirk and his Clouds of Joy and they wrote &quot;Until the Real Thing Comes Along&quot;.

Cahn wrote the lyrics to &quot;Love and Marriage,&quot; later used as the ironic theme song for the FOX TV show &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. The song originally debuted in a 1955 television production of &quot;Our Town&quot;, and won an Emmy Award in 1956. This was only one of many songs that Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen wrote for Frank Sinatra. They were &quot;almost considered to be his personal songwriters.&quot;

Cahn contributed lyrics for two otherwise unrelated films about the Land of Oz, &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1982). The former were composed with Van Heusen, the latter with Allen Byrns, Joe Hisaishi, and Yuichiro Oda.

Cahn became a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972. He later took over the presidency of that organization from his friend Johnny Mercer when Mercer became ill.
While not possessing a great voice, Cahn sang concerts of his own music with pianist and composer Harper MacKay serving as his musical director and accompanist.

===Personal life===
He changed his last name from Cohen to Kahn to avoid confusion with comic and MGM actor Sammy Cohen and again from Kahn to Cahn to avoid confusion with lyricist Gus Kahn.

He was married twice: first in 1945 to vocalist and former Goldwyn girl Gloria Delson, with whom he had two children. They divorced after 18 years of marriage. Gloria went on to marry world-class tennis player Mike Franks in 1965. In 1970, Cahn married Virginia (Tita) Curtis, a former fashion coordinator for the clothes designer Donald Brooks.

He was the father of Laurie Cahn and jazz/fusion guitarist Steve Khan who, early in his career, changed the spelling of his last name to Khan in order to &quot;create a separate identity from [his] famous father&quot; and because he was &quot;so hurt and angry with him for so many childhood things.&quot;

Sammy Cahn died on January 15, 1993, at the age of 79 in Los Angeles, California from heart failure. His remains were interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.

==Honors, awards and legacy==
Over the course of his career, he was nominated for 31 Academy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, and an Emmy Award. He also received a Grammy Award nomination, with Van Heusen, for Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Show for the film &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot;. He has won the Christopher Award, the Outer Critics Circle Award, and the Theatre World Award (for Best Newcomer to Broadway).

In 1988, the Sammy Film Music Awards (the &quot;Sammy&quot;), an annual award for movie songs and scores, was started in his honor. When notified by Roger Lee Hall, Cahn said he was &quot;flattered and honored&quot; that these awards were named after him.
He was chosen because he had received more Academy Award nominations than any other songwriter, and also because he received four Oscars for his song lyrics.

In 1993, taking up the sentiments expressed in the song, &quot;High Hopes,&quot; the Cahn estate established the &quot;High Hopes Fund&quot; at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. The former Joslin patient and songwriter&#x27;s goal was to provide hope and encouragement to kids with diabetes while supporting research into the causes of the disease.

The lyrics he wrote for Sinatra are the subject of a chapter in Gilbert Gigliotti&#x27;s &quot;A Storied Singer: Frank Sinatra as Literary Conceit&quot;, &quot;Come [Fly, Dance, and Waltz with] Us on Equal Terms: The Whitmanesque Sinatra of Sammy Cahn,&quot; published by Greenwood Press in 2002.

<text>Qin Er Shi (230/222207 BC), given name Ying Huhai, was the second emperor of the Chinese Qin dynasty, reigning from 210 to 207 BC. The son of Qin Shi Huang, he was put on the throne by Li Si and Zhao Gao, circumventing his brother Fusu, who had been the designated heir. Upon Huhai&#x27;s ascension, both Fusu and the popular general Meng Tian were killed on the orders of Li and Zhao, with Qin Er Shi&#x27;s role in the assassinations remaining uncertain and controversial. A weak ruler, Qin Er Shi&#x27;s reign was completely dominated by Zhao Gao, who eventually forced him to commit suicide. By the time of his death, the Qin Empire&#x27;s power had lessened so much that his successor Ziying ruled as a king, not emperor.

==Early life==
Huhai () was the personal name of the Second Emperor. Its Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as . Although his parentage was questioned by many historians including Sima Qian, they accepted Qin Er Shi as a member of the state of Qin&#x27;s House of Ying. Huhai is the eighteenth son of Qin Shi Huang. As the youngest son, he was doted on by his father. It is not clear who his mother was, although most likely she was &quot;The Hu (barbarian) princess&quot; Hu Ji (). Although he is sometimes known as &quot;Ying Huhai&quot; according to the practice of modern Chinese names, the ancient custom was not to combine the names in this way: his personal name never appears in combination with Ying, Zhao, or Qin. From an early age, Huhai was apprenticed to the minister Zhao Gao to learn Legalism, by the decree of Qin Shi Huang. There is a possibility that Hu Ji was a princess from the Greco-Bactrian Euthydemid dynasty offered to Ying Zheng as an alliance gift from neighboring Gansu in 230 BC.

==Ascension to throne==
Qin Shi Huang died during one of his tours of eastern China in the summer of 210 BC at the palace in Shaqiu. The announcement of his death was withheld until the entourage, which was accompanied by Premier Li Si and the imperial court, returned to the capital, Xianyang, two months later. Nevertheless, Huhai and Zhao Gao were aware of Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s death and began plotting an internal intrigue.

The eldest son Fusu was supposed to be elected as the next emperor. However, Li Si and the chief eunuch Zhao Gao conspired to kill Fusu to get rid of Meng Tian, Fusu&#x27;s favourite general and their court rival. They were afraid that if Fusu were enthroned, they would lose their power. Li Si and Zhao Gao forged a fake edict by Qin Shi Huang ordering both Fusu and Meng to commit suicide. Their plan worked, and the younger son, Huhai, acceded the throne to become the second emperor, later known as Qin Er Shi. However, recent findings of bamboo strips dating from the time of the intrigue note that Huhai was elected and killed his brother. That would indicate that the fake edict, in the case of Fusu, was an imperial cover story.

==Second Emperor of Qin==

In the first year of his reign in 210 BC, Huhai was made the second emperor of Qin at the age of 19. His regnal name Qin Er Shi means &#x27;second generation of the Qin&#x27;, and is a contraction of Qin Er Shi Huangdi (). The name followed the nomenclature established by the First Emperor, who envisioned an empire that would last for ten thousand generations and for his successors to bear the aspiration in their reign names. The practice ended abruptly with the third emperor, Ziying, when the Qin dynasty was overturned by Chu and Han.

Qin Er Shi depended on the eunuch Zhao Gao so much so that he acted as a puppet emperor, with the eunuch as puppeteer. Zhao Gao was made the Qin prime minister during Qin Er Shi&#x27;s reign, which was cruel and brought much suffering to the people. From his reign onwards, the Qin dynasty declined.

After one of the tours, Zhao Gao suggested for him to examine the governors and military commandants and to punish those guilty of some crime. That way, he could do away with those who disapproved of the emperor&#x27;s actions. Six imperial princes were killed at Tu (杜). The emperor then further punished people for petty crimes. The emperor&#x27;s brother Jianglu () and two other brothers were imprisoned. A messenger was then sent to read them a death sentence. Jianglu looked to the heavens and cried out loud three times that he did not commit any crime. All three brothers cried and drew their own swords to commit suicide. Zhao Gao said that the second emperor was young and that as the Son of Heaven, his own voice must never be heard, and his face must never be shown. Accordingly, the emperor remained in the inner palaces and consulted only with Zhao Gao. Therefore, the high ministers rarely had the opportunity to see the emperor in court.

===Revolts===
Bandits and brigands grew in numbers from different directions to attack the Qin. Military leaders such as Chen Sheng delegitimized the rule of Qin Er Shi by claiming Fusu should have been made ruler. One of the immediate revolts was the Dazexiang Uprising in 209. The rebellion occurred in the territory that was formerly Chu state and claimed to be restoring Chu&#x27;s greatness.

Overall, Qin Er Shi was not able to contend with nationwide rebellions. He was not as capable as his father, and many revolts against him quickly erupted. His reign was a time of extreme civil unrest, and everything the First Emperor had worked for crumbled away within a short period. Later, an envoy reported about the rebellion in court. The emperor was enraged, and the envoy was punished. Then, all other envoys reporting about uprisings would say that the bandits were being pursued and captured. Without any need to worry, the emperor was pleased.

===Death of allies===
The bandits and brigands continued to grow in numbers. The chancellor Feng Quqi, Li Si and the general Feng Jie came forward to complain that the Qin military could not hold off the increasing number of revolts. They suggested for the construction of Epang Palace to be suspended lest the burden of tax should be too heavy. The emperor then questioned their loyalty. All three of them were handed over to law officials, who subjected them to examinations to see if they were guilty of other crimes. Feng Quqi and Feng Jie committed suicide to avoid enduring disgrace. Li Si was put in prison, and then killed via The Five Pains punishment. Zhao Gao continued to push the emperor to find associates with loyalty and to punish those who showed disloyalty with more severe penalties. Meng Yi and other chief ministers were executed. Twelve of the princes were executed in a marketplace in Xianyang. Ten princesses in Du were executed and their bodies were torn apart.

===Horse and deer test===
On 27 September 207 BC, the eunuch Zhao Gao tested his power against the emperor&#x27;s. He presented a deer to the Second Emperor but called it a horse. The emperor laughed and said, &quot;Is the chancellor perhaps mistaken, calling a deer a horse?&quot; He questioned those around him. Some remained silent, and some aligned with Zhao Gao and called it a horse. Zhao Gao executed every official who had called it a deer. This incident provides the modern Chinese &quot;chengyu&quot; &quot;point to a deer and call it a horse&quot; ( );.

==Dynastic collapse==

Although Qin managed to suppress most of the nationwide rebellions, they still caused serious damage. Qin&#x27;s manpower and supplies were greatly reduced. Qin was decisively defeated at the Battle of Julu. Court plots led Zhang Han to surrender along with his soldiers, which later led to the live burial of 200,000 Qin troops. In total, Qin lost over 300,000 men. Even then, Qin Er Shi failed to grasp the severity of the defeat, erroneously thinking that Qin had many more spare troops due to courtiers hiding the truth to him in fear of execution. Finally, a daring and loyal eunuch told Qin Er Shi the truth. Shocked, Qin Er Shi tried to capture Zhao Gao and to hold him responsible.

Zhao Gao, however, had expected that Qin Er Shi would ask him to take the blame. Therefore, Zhao Gao conspired with his loyal soldiers to force the emperor to commit suicide. Surrounded and with no means of escape, Qin Er Shi asked the loyal eunuch why he had not told the truth earlier. The eunuch replied that it was Qin Er Shi himself who had decided to execute anyone who would tell him the truth.

In 207 BC, the Qin dynasty collapsed only fifteen years after it had been established. Ziying of Qin, allegedly a son of Fusu—there is no consensus as to his actual relationship to the house of Qin—was made &quot;king of Qin state&quot;, a reduced title. Ziying soon killed Zhao Gao and surrendered to Liu Bang one year later.

==Death and burial==

Qin Er Shi reigned only for three years and was forced to commit suicide eventually by Zhao Gao at the age of 22. Qin Er Shi was condemned by Zhao Gao after his death and was denied a royal burial. He was buried in modern Xi&#x27;an, near the Wild Goose Pagoda. Compared to his father, his tomb is much less elaborate and does not have a Terracotta Army. Qin Er Shi did not have a temple name.

<text>The Lion of Judah (, ) is a Jewish national and cultural symbol, traditionally regarded as the symbol of the tribe of Judah. The association between the Judahites and the lion can first be found in the blessing given by Jacob to his fourth son, Judah, in the Book of Genesis of the Hebrew Bible.

It is also mentioned in the Book of Revelation of the New Testament as a term representing Jesus of Nazareth, according to Christian theology. The Lion of Judah was also one of the titles used by Ethiopian emperors from the Solomonic dynasty.

== History ==

=== Judaism ===

The biblical Judah (in Hebrew: &quot;Yehuda&quot;) is the eponymous ancestor of the Tribe of Judah, which is traditionally symbolized by a lion. In Genesis, the patriarch Jacob (&quot;Israel&quot;) gave that symbol to this tribe when he refers to his son Judah as a , &quot;Young Lion&quot; (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him. In Jewish naming tradition the Hebrew name and the substitute name are often combined as a pair, as in this case. The Lion of Judah was used as a Jewish symbol for many years, and as Jerusalem was the capital of the Kingdom of Judah, in 1950 it was included in the Emblem of Jerusalem.

=== Christianity ===
The phrase appears in the New Testament in :

This is widely regarded as a reference to the Second Coming among Christians.

Many Christian organizations and ministries use the lion of Judah as their emblem or even as their names.

==== Ethiopia ====
It was depicted on a map of the Upper Nile published in 1683 by the German Hiob Ludolf describing the Lion of Judah symbol as the royal insignia of the Ethiopian Empire. The Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia claims to have its patrilineal origin in the Israelite Royal House of Judah. The Lion of Judah served as the hereditary title of the Solomonic Ethiopian emperors and nobles including Sabagadis Woldu, Kenfu Hailu, Wube Haile Mariam, Tewodros II, Yohannes IV, Menelik, and Haile Selassie and was depicted on the flag of Ethiopia from 1897 to 1974. Due to its association with Haile Selassie, it continues to be an important symbol among members of the Rastafari movement.

The Lion of Judah motif figured prominently on the old imperial flag, currency, stamps, etc. and may still be seen gracing the terrace of the capital as a national symbol. After the collapse of the Derg in 1990, a minor political party bearing the name made its appearance.

===== &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot; =====
Ethiopia&#x27;s history as recorded and elaborated in a 13th-century treatise, the &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot;, asserts descent from a retinue of Israelites who returned with Makeda, the Queen of Sheba from her visit to King Solomon in Jerusalem, by whom she had conceived the Solomonic dynasty&#x27;s founder Menelik I. As Solomon was of the tribe of Judah, his son Menelik I would continue the line, which according to Ethiopian history was passed directly down from king to king until Emperor Haile Selassie I (ostensibly the 225th king from King David) was deposed in 1974.

Both Christian and Jewish Ethiopian history have it that there were also immigrants of the Tribes of Dan and Judah that accompanied Makeda back from her visit to Solomon; hence the Ge&#x27;ez motto (&quot;The Lion of Judah has conquered&quot;), included among the titles of the Emperor throughout the Solomonic Dynasty.

=== Rastafari ===
The Lion of Judah is a prominent symbol in the Rastafari movement. It represents Emperor Haile Selassie I as well as being a symbol of strength, kingship, pride and African sovereignty.
Rastafari consider the mention of &quot;The Lion of Judah&quot; in Genesis 49:9 and Revelation 5:5 of the Bible to refer to Emperor Haile Selassie I. Rastafari hail Haile Selassie I with the titles &quot;King of kings, lord of lords, conquering Lion of Judah, elect of God, the light of the world&quot;.

== The Lion of Judah 1981 ==
In 1981 Lutz Becker published archival film footage showing the occupation of Ethiopia by Fascist Italy in the documentary film &quot;The Lion of Judah&quot;. The archival footage shows the illegal combat with mustard gas.

== In literature ==
Inspired by the Lion of Judah, C. S. Lewis used a lion named Aslan to represent Jesus in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;.

<doc id="323509" wikidata="Q3228903" url="?curid=323509" title="Lee Kyung-hae">
<text>Lee Kyung-hae (; 1947 – September 10, 2003) was a South Korean farmer and activist who opposed neo-liberal globalization and protested for the local farmers and fishermen of his home country whose jobs were threatened. He was president of the Federation of Farmers and Fishermen of Korea. He died by suicide at the 2003 WTO conference in Cancún, Mexico.

==Early life==
Lee Kyung Hae was born in Jangsu, Jeollabuk-do, in what was then a united Korea. He graduated from Seoul Agricultural College in 1974 and pursued farming as a career, even though farming was not seen at that time as a logical career for college graduates. He established a dairy farm on what had been a deserted wasteland, and developed it to a capacity of seventy cows. He also developed vegetable farms and opened all of his farms to agricultural students seeking real-life experience. It was during that time that Lee married Kim Baek-i, a journalist for the local &quot;Mountains&quot; magazine.

==Activism==
In 1979, he was elected president of the Jangsu Livestock Breeders Association. Throughout the 1980s he worked to improve the situation of farmers nationwide, and as a result of his efforts he was elected to many prominent agricultural positions. He became president of the Jangsu Young Farmers Association in 1983 and the larger Jeonbuk Young Farmers Association in 1987. In response to falling crop prices, he participated in the establishment of the Korean Young Farmers Association. His actions gained the attention of the FAO (The Food and Agricultural Organization) of the UN, and in 1989 Lee was given the award for ‘Farmer of the Year’. In 1989, he was elected president of the Korean Advanced Farmers Federation, and held this position until 1991. In 1990, he started the social activist magazine Korean Young Farmers’ Weekly News. 

In the 1990s, Lee adopted more visible methods in his battle for the Korean farmer. He became a member of the provincial legislature when he was elected three times to serve in the Jeonbuk Provincial Assembly. When the South Korean government attempted to stop the second Nationwide Meeting of the Korean Young Farmers Association, Lee led a hunger strike in protest. 

Hunger strikes continued to be a common tactic for Lee in his struggle against the World Trade Organization. According to him, the WTO&#x27;s trade policies destroyed South Korean farmers, reducing them to poverty or worse. In 1993, he attempted suicide at the WTO&#x27;s Geneva, Switzerland, offices, but was hospitalized and recovered. Lee led a hunger strike in 1994, when the WTO put pressure on South Korea to open its markets to foreign agricultural products. He remained for seventeen days outside the National Assembly Building, in an effort to persuade parliament to pass a law against the WTO. In December 2000, Lee Kyung-hae went on another hunger strike for twenty-six days. 

In February and March 2003, Lee led a hunger strike at WTO headquarters in Geneva, but his actions were ignored by the WTO and by mainstream media. However, Lee&#x27;s hunger strike and his continued statements concerning the effect of rapidly dropping crop prices on Korean farmers were reported in many local newspapers. In Cancun, Lee joined a march of over 15,000 other farmers and indigenous people from around the world and carried a sandwich board that stated, &quot;WTO Kills Farmers.&quot; 

===Death===
On September 10, 2003, Lee stood on top of a police barricade at a major protest demonstration near the WTO conference in Cancún, Mexico, and in front of media television cameras he stabbed himself. Although he was rushed to a local hospital, he died during surgery. The cause of death was officially ruled as a suicide.

Lee is sometimes seen as a martyr to the anti-globalization movement. His death is seen by opponents of neo-liberal globalization as an example of the destructive effects of free trade on the lives of workers.

==Legacy==
Apart from different memorial ceremonies, a candlelight vigil was organised for September 10, 2005, in Hong Kong to commemorate the victims of the WTO, especially Lee Kyung Hae.

Anti-Flag dedicated their song, &quot;The WTO Kills Farmers&quot; to Lee Kyung Hae, as well as Percy Schmeiser and other farmers hurt by the WTO&#x27;s policies.

Ahleuchatistas has a song named &quot;Lee Kyung Hae&quot; in dedication to his activism.

<doc id="323510" wikidata="Q12942" url="?curid=323510" title="Arlette Laguiller">
<text>Arlette Yvonne Laguiller (; born 18 March 1940) is a French politician. From 1973 to 2008, she was the spokeswoman and the best-known leader and presidential nominee of Lutte Ouvrière (LO), a Trotskyist political party.

==Career==
Born at Les Lilas, Seine-Saint-Denis, France, Arlette became a clerical worker in a bank. She was a member of the CGT until 1965 when she was expelled for her Trotskyist views. She joined &quot;Lutte Ouvrière&quot; in 1968. She became the leader of a 1974 bank workers&#x27; strike that began with the actions of employees at Crédit Lyonnais. She continues to live in a council high-rise in Les Lilas and her only income is her pension from the bank where she worked for 40 years.

She has been a frequent candidate for the French presidency, starting with the election of 1974, and continuing through those of 1981, 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2007. During most of these, Laguiller was the only female candidate and was the first female candidate to the French presidency in 1974. Her best result was in 2002 when she came in fifth place and received 5.72% of the vote. In December 2005, Laguiller announced that she would run for president for the sixth and final time in 2007. After finishing a distant ninth in 2007&#x27;s first round of voting (487,857 votes, totaling 1.33% of the popular vote), for the first time since 1981, she endorsed the Socialist Party candidate (Ségolène Royal) for the second round. In the past, Laguiller and LO have often refrained from openly supporting the Socialist Party and take a neutral stance in the second round.

==Popular culture==

The puppet show, &quot;Les Guignols de l&#x27;info&quot; frequently caricatured Laguiller as saying, &quot;Travailleuses, travailleurs ! On vous ment, on vous spolie !&quot; (&quot;Female workers, male workers! You are being lied to, you are being robbed!&quot;). Laguiller indeed did begin most of her speeches with the formula, &quot;&quot;Travailleuses, travailleurs!&quot;.

In 1995, pop singer Alain Souchon recorded the song &quot;Arlette Laguiller&quot;, commenting that, &quot;Her words, of course, may be a little worn-out&quot;,&quot; but praising her &quot;&quot;peppermint-fresh&quot; way of expressing them, and indicating that, &quot;When Arlette sings, you feel a real sense of love&quot;.&quot; He has since lost his soft spot for Laguiller after she refused to back Jacques Chirac against Jean-Marie Le Pen in the 2002 presidential election and has stated that he won&#x27;t sing the song again. Although, in 2008 Laguiller mentioned that Souchon had started singing the song again.

The area of present-day Canoga Park was the homeland of Native Americans in the Tongva-Fernandeño and Chumash-Venturaño tribes, that lived in the Simi Hills and along to the tributaries of the Los Angeles River. They traded with the north Valley Tataviam-Fernandeño people. Native American civilizations inhabited the Valley for an estimated 8,000 years. Their culture left the Burro Flats Painted Cave nearby.

From 1797 to 1846, the area was part of Mission San Fernando Rey de España (Mission San Fernando). After the Mexican War of Independence from Spain the &#x27;future Canoga Park&#x27; land became part of Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando. In 1845, a land grant for the separate and historically rich Rancho El Escorpión was issued by Governor Pío Pico to three Chumash people, Odón Eusebia, his brother-in-law Urbano, and Urbano&#x27;s son Mañuel. It was located in the area west of Fallbrook Avenue and later called Platt Ranch.

===American history===

In 1863, the syndicate San Fernando Homestead Association led by Isaac Lankershim and Isaac Van Nuys purchased the southern half of the historic San Fernando Valley. They established seven wheat ranch operations and were the first to ship wheat to Europe from California. In 1869, Alfred Workman acquired the westernmost ranch, a wheat farm in future Canoga Park &quot;(for more: See Landmarks section below)&quot;. Eucalyptus trees were introduced into the San Fernando Valley by Albert Workman, who imported seedlings from his native Australia and planted them on the Workman Ranch. In time, they spread through the Canoga Park area ranches, farms and beyond. It has been said that these trees are the parents of all eucalyptus trees in Southern California.

The entire south San Fernando Valley, from Roscoe Boulevard south to the hills, with certain exceptions, were to be subdivided in anticipation of the Los Angeles aqueduct&#x27;s completion in 1913. The purchasers of the land included Harry Chandler and Harrison Gray Otis of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Moses Sherman (a Los Angeles Pacific Railroad streetcar line builder), and Hobart Johnstone Whitley, an all purpose real estate developer who, from a start in the Land Rush of 1889 in Oklahoma to platting out 140 towns, including Hollywood.

The area was originally named &quot;Owensmouth&quot; by Los Angeles Suburban Home Company by general manager Hobart Johnstone Whitley as a sales tactic in that the town would be the new mouth of the Owens River, after the Los Angeles Aqueduct would be completed the next year. The town was founded on March 30, 1912, and the Suburban Home Company contracted with the Janss Investment Company, to sell properties. A pre-development scheme brought Pacific Electric streetcars and an all purpose highway (Sherman Way) out all the way from Hollywood through Cahuenga Pass, through the previously subdivided Van Nuys (1911). Highlighting the &quot;opening day barbecue&quot; was the display of the &quot;Owensmouth Baby&quot;, a racecar that could go up and down the paved Sherman Way at the incredible speed of 35 mph.

Owensmouth, as the junior San Fernando Valley city to Van Nuys, promoted itself with the &quot;baby&quot; motif—using storks in their advertisement. The &quot;baby city&quot; of the Valley remained a very small community.

The lack of an independent water supply made annexation to the City of Los Angeles inevitable, and on February 26, 1917, it joined with its larger neighbor. The name was changed to &quot;Canoga Park&quot; in 1931, thanks to the efforts of local civic leader Mary Logan Orcutt. Eventually, the area&#x27;s zoning was rural/agricultural and its industry was small farms involved in the production of fruits, vegetables, and melons, some livestock, horses, a movie/television studio, and a stunt location.

The Canoga Park Airstrip occupied the area now known as &quot;Warner Center&quot; (as shown on the street map 1955 Thomas Guide).

===Recent history===

In 1955, Rocketdyne, then a division of North American Aviation (NAA), moved into the area and built its main manufacturing facility in Canoga Park. The facility became a major employer along with the Atomics International and Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) divisions of NAA. Other aerospace companies followed: including Thompson Ramo Wooldridge-TRW, Hughes Aircraft, Rockwell International, Boeing, and Teledyne. Small machine shops and other ancillary businesses also sprang up to service the aerospace industry. The Rocketdyne facility was in the end operated by Aerojet Rocketdyne, who moved out of Canoga Park in 2014. Demolition and site clearing of the former Rocketdyne facility in Canoga Park commenced in August 2016. The Santa Susana Field Lab property has also been closed and will be undergoing an extensive environmental cleanup, and become an open-space park.

In 1987, much of the western district of Canoga Park was renamed West Hills. On June 25, 2005, Canoga Park was named an All-America City.

The use of toxic chemicals like trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethene as cleaning solvents during production by aerospace and defense contractor companies in their Canoga Park industrial facilities led to groundwater pollution on their sites and across the neighborhood.

Since 2003, environmental testing on a former Litton Industries, later Northrop Grumman, industrial site revealed unsafe levels of toxic chemicals on the site; 2007 tests further revealed that toxins had spread to an area beyond the site. In 2021, a petition for a class action against Northrop Grumman on behalf of affected residents was filed. The petition sought monetary compensation for losses in property value and called on Northrop Grumman to mitigate the contamination, alleging that the chemicals had leaked from the site and contaminated groundwater under 3,200 properties in an area about 2.4 miles long and 1.8 miles wide and that the corporation failed to properly contain or remediate the damage after it acquired the site in 2001. The corporation argued that they had complied with the California State Water Resources Control Board and that the Board had approved their actions.

A June 2024 report on soil vapor and groundwater inspections conducted near the vacant Rocketdyne site, delivered to the California State Water Resources Control Board on behalf of RTX Corporation, reported levels of toxic cleaning solvents that were above levels that could pose a threat to the environment and human health. According to the LA Times in August, several residents of apartments which had been inspected reported that they were not notified of the testing nor of test results. The Water Board confirmed that they were reviewing the report and responded about 7,000 individuals in residences and businesses within 500 feet of the site were notified. The Board also reported that they had notified some 4,000 Canoga Park residents about exposure to toxic chemicals from the former Litton Industries site.

==Geography==
Canoga Park is bordered by Woodland Hills on the south, West Hills on the west, Chatsworth on the north, and Winnetka on the east.

Bell and Dayton Creeks flowing from the Simi Hills, and Arroyo Calabasas (Calabasas Creek) from the Santa Monica Mountains are several of the headwaters of the Los Angeles River that originate in the western San Fernando Valley that flow through Canoga Park. The Los Angeles River itself begins at the confluence of Calabasas Creek and Bell Creek behind Canoga Park High School. These and other small creeks supply stormwater and suburban runoff water to the Los Angeles River, and several are considered year round creeks. Although the creeks are now channeled and run within concrete walls, they do form a significant urban wildlife landscape and contribute to the population of indigenous wildlife left within the San Fernando Valley.

===Climate===
This area experiences hot and very dry summers. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Canoga Park has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csa&quot; on climate maps.

==Population==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 53,227 residents in the Canoga Park neighborhood—or 12,240 people per square mile, about an average population density for the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 60,578. In 2000, the median age for residents was 30, also about average for city and county neighborhoods.

The neighborhood was considered &quot;highly diverse&quot; ethnically within Los Angeles. The breakdown was 50.9% Latino; 30.7% White; 11.1% Asian; 4.3% Black; and 3.1% other. Mexico (45.8%) and El Salvador (11.6%) were the most common places of birth for the 42.8% of the residents who were born abroad—which was about an average percentage for Los Angeles as a whole.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $51,601, considered average for the city. Renters occupied 63.6% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 36.4%. The average household size of three people was average for Los Angeles. The 18.1% of families headed by single parents was also average for city neighborhoods.

The percentage of residents aged 19 to 34 was among the county&#x27;s highest, as was the percentage of never-married men (40.4%).

== Economy ==
Canoga Park is the headquarters of electronic provider Electro Rent.

==Government==
===Police===
Los Angeles Police Department Topanga Community Police Station serves residents in Canoga Park, parts of Winnetka, West Hills, and Woodland Hills. The Topanga Community Police Station opened in January 2009. The police department named the station after a village in the Tongva language of the historically local Tongva-Fernandeño Native Americans tribe. The department originally planned to name it the Northwest Station, but residents preferred a name linking to the town&#x27;s history. Prior to the opening of the Topanga station, the Devonshire Community Police Station served addresses north of Roscoe Boulevard while the West Valley Police Station served addresses south of Roscoe Boulevard.

<text>Dongting Lake () is a large, shallow lake in northeastern Hunan Province, China. It is a flood basin of the Yangtze River, so its volume depends on the season. The provinces of Hubei and Hunan are named after their location relative to the lake: &quot;Hubei&quot; means &quot;North of the Lake&quot; and &quot;Hunan&quot;, &quot;South of the Lake&quot;.

Dongting Lake is famous in Chinese culture as the place of origin of dragon boat racing. It is the site of Junshan Island and is home to the critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoise.

==Geography==
In the July–September period, flood water from the Yangtze flows into the lake, enlarging it greatly. The lake&#x27;s area, which normally is (data before 1998), may increase to in flood season, when vast amounts of water and sediment from the Chang Jiang flow into the lake. The lake is also fed by four major rivers: the Xiang, Zi, Yuan and Li rivers. Small rivers also flow in, the most famous being the Miluo River, where the loyal official and poet Qu Yuan committed suicide in the early 3rd century BC, according to tradition. In addition, the Xiao River flows into the Xiang near Yongzhou, before the Xiang flows into the lake. Ocean-going vessels can travel through the Xiang to reach Changsha.

==River and lake==

The Dongting Lake catchment area is . The lake&#x27;s only outlet is a natural channel 14 km long and on average 1 km wide. 

There are five main rivers in the catchment (excluding the area whose water flows directly into the Yangtze River, the same hereafter): 
* Xiang, from the south;
* Zi, from the southwest; 
* Yuan, from the west; 
* Lishui, from the north;
* Miluo, from the east.
All of these rivers flow directly into the lake. In addition, some of water of the Yangtze River also flows into the lake through the Sankou distributary channels. 

The catchment has highly complex flow regimes featuring strong river-lake interactions. Dongting Lake receives water from the upper Jingjiang reach of the Yangtze River. The water in Dongting Lake finally flows into the lower Jingjiang reach of the Yangtze River at the Chenglingji Station and discharges downstream. The water in Dongting Lake mainly comes from surface runoff and direct rainfall on the lake surface. The Dongting Lake catchment begins to enter the rainy season in April and the rainfall reaches its maximum in June. Then, the rainy area moves to the upper part of the Yangtze River Basin in July and flood water flowing into the lake from upstream increases significantly. The rainy season may continue until the end of September. The flow regime of Dongting Lake maintains the same temporal pattern as the rainfall regime. 

The flood season is from April to September. In general, flood water comes mainly from the catchment from April to June and from water diversion of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River from July to September. 

The annual runoff from Dongting Lake to the Yangtze River is , of which to is received from the Yangtze River through the inlets. Influenced by the monsoon, the lake shows a significant seasonal change in its flow regime. The lake water level fluctuates dramatically throughout a year, up to . The water surface area also varies with the fluctuation of the water level from thousands of square kilometers in the flood season to only a few hundred square kilometers in the dry season.

==History==
The earliest rice paddies yet discovered in the world were in the Liyang plain, which was then on the western edge of Dongting lake. The state of Chu occupied the region in the Eastern Zhou period, and its territory there was taken over by Qin in the 3rd century BCE. During the Han dynasty, Yunmeng Marsh ( literally &quot;Great Marsh of Cloud Dream&quot;), which lies to the north of Dongting Lake in Hubei Province, served as the main flood-basin of the Yangtze. The rich sediment of the marsh attracted farmers. Embankments were built, keeping the river out, and the Dongting Lake area south of the Yangtze gradually became the river&#x27;s main flood-basin. The Han state was actively involved in the colonization of the region, maintaining dikes in Liyang to protect farmland from flooding.

At that time, Dongting Lake was China&#x27;s largest freshwater lake. Because of its size, it gained the name &quot;Eight-hundred-li-Dongting&quot; (). Nowadays, it is the second-largest, after Poyang Lake, as much of the lake has been turned into farmland.

==Culture and mythology==

The area is well known in Chinese history and literature. &quot;Dongting&quot; literally means &quot;Grotto Court&quot;, and the lake was named for the huge hall or cavern, which was believed to exist beneath the lake, where the spirits of the Sage-King Shun&#x27;s wives Ehuang and Nüying were said to be the rulers of this grotto, which was claimed to have underground passages opening to all parts of the empire. Dragon boat racing is said to have begun on the eastern shores of Dongting Lake as a search for the body of Qu Yuan, the Chu poet (340–278 BC), and a dragon-king is said to live at the bottom of the lake.

Junshan was also named after the goddess-wives of Shun, who lived there after his death by drowning, while they mourned him and sought for his body all the way from the source of the Xiang River, in which he drowned, and then on down to where it could have drifted, into the lake. Junshan Island, a former Taoist retreat, is a famous -wide island with 72 peaks in the middle of the lake. The island is also famous for its Junshan Yinzhen tea. The basin of Dongting Lake and its surrounding area is famous for its scenic beauty, which has been encapsulated in the phrase &quot;Hunan of the Xiao and Xiang rivers&quot; ().

The scenery of the Jiuyi Mountains and of the Xiao and Xiang rivers below is often mentioned in Chinese poetry. The late Tang dynasty poet Yu Wuling is supposed to have been fond of the scenery of Dongting Lake. During the Song dynasty, it became the fashion to paint this region&#x27;s scenery in a set of eight scenes, usually entitled as Eight Views of Xiaoxiang. It is also said that Han Shizhong settled in the region after retired from military service. The fashion spread to Japan, where eventually other famous places were substituted for the Xiao and Xiang rivers. One of the famous ponds based on the geography of the lake is at the Daikaku-ji in Kyoto.

==Environmental issues==

The agricultural colonization of the region began in ancient times, and by the 19th century much of the lake&#x27;s shallower areas had been destroyed to create farmland. After 1949 a new round of wetland drainage destroyed much of what remained, leaving only a fraction of the original wetland intact, though some of that area has subsequently been returned to wetland conditions. Nonetheless, along with Poyang Lake, it remains one of the largest lakes in China, and is an important wintering area for migratory birds. It has been designated as a protected Ramsar site since 1992.

In 2007 fears were expressed that China&#x27;s finless porpoise, a native of the lake, might follow the baiji, the Yangtze river dolphin, into extinction. There have been calls for action to save the finless porpoise, of which there are about 1400 left living, with approximately 700 to 900 in the Yangtze, and approximately another 500 in Poyang and Dongting Lakes.
The 2007 population levels were less than half the 1997 levels, and the population continues to drop at a rate of 7.3 per cent per year. Pressure on the finless porpoise population on Poyang Lake comes from the high numbers of ships passing through, as well as sand dredging.

After flooding of the Yangtze River in late June 2007, approximately 2 billion mice were displaced from the islands of the lake when water was released from the Three Gorges Dam to control the excess. The mice invaded surrounding communities, damaging crops and dikes and forcing the government to construct walls and ditches to control the population. Villagers killed an estimated 2 million mice by beating them to death or using poisons, which also had an adverse effect on their predators.

A restoration project, the Sino-Norwegian Project of Biodiversity Protection Management, began in 2005. According to a 2007 article in the China Daily, &quot;[The Dongting Lake area] will be restored to a sustainable biodiversity environment within five to 10 years&quot;.

<text>Herbert Irving Schiller (November 5, 1919 – January 29, 2000) was an American media critic, sociologist, author, and scholar. He earned his PhD in 1960 from New York University.

Schiller warned of two major trends in his prolific writings and speeches: the private takeover of public space and public institutions at home, and U.S. corporate domination of cultural life abroad, especially in the developing nations. His eight books and hundreds of articles in both scholarly and popular journals made him a key figure both in communication research and in the public debate over the role of the media in modern society. He was widely known for the term “packaged consciousness,” that argues American media is controlled by a few corporations that “create, process, refine and preside over the circulation of images and information which determines our beliefs, attitudes and ultimately our behavior.” Schiller used Time Warner Inc. as an example of packaged consciousness, stating that it “basically dominates publishing, cable television, recordings, tapes and filmmaking.”

He was married to librarian and scholar Anita Schiller, and their children include sons Zach and Dan. Zach Schiller is a public policy analyst in Ohio, and Dan Schiller is a telecommunications historian at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

<text>Sir Terence Ernest Manitou Frost RA (13 October 1915 – 1 September 2003) was a British abstract artist, who worked in Newlyn, Cornwall. Frost was renowned for his use of the Cornish light, colour and shape to start a new art movement in England. He became a leading exponent of abstract art and a recognised figure of the British art establishment.

==Career==
Born in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, in 1915, he did not become an artist until he was in his 30s. He left school aged fourteen and went to work at Curry&#x27;s cycle shop and then at Armstrong Whitworth in Coventry. During World War II, he served in France, the Middle East and Greece, before joining the commandos. Whilst serving with the commandos in Crete in June 1941 he was captured and sent to various prisoner of war camps. As a prisoner of war at Stalag 383 in Bavaria, he met Adrian Heath who encouraged him to paint. Commenting later he described these years as a &#x27;tremendous spiritual experience, a more aware or heightened perception during starvation&#x27;.

As soon as war was over he went to Birmingham College of Art, where he met Barrie Cook. However Frost quickly assumed that the action was elsewhere. At first attended Camberwell School of Art under Leonard Fuller. The following year, 1946 he removed for a year out to St. Ives School of Painting where his first solo exhibition was held in 1947 at G.B. Downing&#x27;s bookshop, before returning to London and that autumn the Camberwell School of Art under Victor Pasmore, Ben Nicholson and William Coldstream bringing him to paint his first abstract work in 1949. For three years he exhibited with the St Ives Society of Artists until in 1950 he was elected a member of the Penwith Society; he maintained a permanent connection with the Newlyn school. Already settled in the town by 1951 he worked as an assistant to the sculptor Barbara Hepworth. He was joined there by Roger Hilton, where they began a collaboration in collage and construction techniques.

His first exhibition was the Leicester Galleries in the heart of London&#x27;s West End. Frost&#x27;s academic career included teaching at Bath Academy of Art, the Coventry College of Art and was appointed on the recommendation of Herbert Read as the Gregory Fellow on Painting (1954-1956) at the University of Leeds. There he befriended the painter Stass Paraskos, who would later invite Frost to spend time working and teaching in Cyprus at the Cyprus College of Art.

In 1958 while still living in Leeds and teaching at Leeds School of Art he joined the London Group. He moved to St Ives, and then in 1963 to Banbury, where his house at 2 Old Parr Street now sports an Oxfordshire Blue Plaque.

Later he became Artist in Residence and Professor of Painting at the Department of Fine Art of the University of Reading.

In the 1960s, Frost was represented by the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York.

In 1992 he was elected a Royal Academician and he was knighted in 1998. A retrospective of his work was held in 2000.

==Personal life==
He married Kathleen Clarke in 1945. They had five sons and one daughter. Two of his sons, Adrian and Anthony, also became artists, while a third son, Stephen, is a comedian and actor. His grandson Luke Frost (son of Anthony) is also an artist.

<doc id="323556" wikidata="Q296691" url="?curid=323556" title="Miguel de la Madrid">
<text>Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado (; 12 December 1934 – 1 April 2012) was a Mexican politician affiliated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) who served as the 59th president of Mexico from 1982 to 1988.

Inheriting a severe economic and financial crisis from his predecessor José López Portillo as a result of the international drop in oil prices and a crippling external debt on which Mexico had defaulted months before he took office, De la Madrid introduced sweeping neoliberal policies to overcome the crisis, beginning an era of market-oriented presidents in Mexico, along with austerity measures involving deep cuts in public spending. In spite of these reforms, De la Madrid&#x27;s administration continued to be plagued by negative economic growth and inflation for the rest of his term, while the social effects of the austerity measures were particularly harsh on the lower and middle classes, with real wages falling to half of what they were in 1978 and with a sharp rise in unemployment and in the informal economy by the end of his term.

De la Madrid&#x27;s administration was also famous for his &quot;Moral Renovation&quot; campaign, whose purported goal was to fight the government corruption that had become widespread under previous administrations, leading to the arrests of top officials of the López Portillo administration.

In addition, his administration was criticized for its slow response to the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, and the handling of the controversial 1988 elections in which the PRI candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari was declared winner, amid accusations of electoral fraud.

==Early life and education==
Miguel de la Madrid was born in the city of Colima, Colima, Mexico. He was the son of Miguel de la Madrid Castro, a notable lawyer (who was assassinated when the future President was only two), and Alicia Hurtado Oldenbourg. His grandfather was Enrique Octavio de la Madrid, the governor of Colima.

He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) —one of his teachers there, José López Portillo, would later become President of Mexico— and received a master&#x27;s degree in Public Administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in the United States.

In 1953, he was introduced to Paloma Cordero by her older brother. The couple began dating in 1955 and married four years later at the Santa Rosa de Lima Church in Cuauhtémoc in 1959. Cordero and de la Madrid had five children - Margarita, Miguel, Enrique Octavio, Federico Luis and Gerardo Antonio.

==Early career==
He worked for the Bank of Mexico and lectured in law at UNAM before he got a position at the Secretariat of Finance in 1965. Between 1970 and 1972, he was employed by , Mexico&#x27;s state-owned petroleum company, after which he held several other bureaucratic posts in the government of Luis Echeverría. In 1979, he was chosen to serve in José López Portillo&#x27;s cabinet as Secretary of Budget and Planning, replacing Ricardo García Sainz.

==1982 election==

De la Madrid had no political experience as an elected official prior to becoming the candidate for the PRI. In the assessment of political scientist Jorge G. Castañeda, López Portillo designated De la Madrid as a candidate by elimination, not by choice, and that De la Madrid remained in contention as a candidate because he was never the bearer of bad news to the president. Other contenders were Javier García Paniagua and David Ibarra Muñoz. When his candidacy was revealed, his &quot;candidacy was greeted with unusual hostility from some sectors of the political establishment--an indication of the emerging rift between the old &quot;políticos&quot; and emerging technocrats.&quot; De la Madrid did not run against a strong opposition candidate. His campaign rhetoric emphasized traditional liberal values of representation, federalism, strengthening of the legislature and the judiciary. There was massive turnout in the election, for the first time in many years, voting overwhelmingly for De la Madrid.

==Presidency==
De la Madrid inherited the financial catastrophe from his predecessor; Mexico experienced per capita negative growth for his entire term. De la Madrid&#x27;s handling of the devastating 1985 Mexico City earthquake was his own major misstep. The end of his administration was even worse, with his choice of Carlos Salinas de Gortari as his successor, the split in the PRI with the exit of Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, and the government&#x27;s handling of balloting with election results deemed fraudulent. His administration did have some bright spots, with Mexico&#x27;s becoming a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1985. Mexico also was part of the Contadora process to find a solution of the conflicts in Central America.

===Economic policy===
Unlike previous Mexican leaders, he was a market-oriented president. Inflation increased on an average of 100% a year and reached to an unprecedented level of 159% in 1987. The underemployment rate soared to 25% during the mid-1980s, income declined, and economic growth was erratic since prices rose usually much faster than incomes.

All that was a stark reminder of the gross mismanagement and policies of his two immediate predecessors, particularly the financing of development with excessive overseas borrowing, which was often countered by high internal capital flights. De la Madrid himself had been Minister of Budget and Programming under López Portillo, and as such he was perceived by many as being co-responsible for the crisis that he himself had to deal with upon taking office.
As an immediate reaction to the economic crisis, he first presented the Immediate Economic Reorganization Program (&quot;Programa Inmediato de Reordenación Económica&quot;) and, a couple of months later, the National Development Plan (&quot;Plan Nacional de Desarrollo&quot;). Some of the measures proposed were a reduction of public spending, fiscal reforms, a restructuring of the bureaucracy, and employment protection.

During his presidency, De la Madrid introduced neoliberal economic reforms that encouraged foreign investment, widespread privatization of state-run industries, and reduction of tariffs, a process that continued under his successors, and which immediately caught the attention of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international observers. In January 1986, Mexico entered the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) following its efforts at reforming and decentralizing its economy. The number of state-owned industries went down from approximately 1,155 in 1982 to 412 in 1988. De la Madrid re-privatized companies that had been made state-run under his predecessors. He sought better public-private sector relations, but the private sector began backing opposition candidates nonetheless. Given the dire economic circumstances he inherited from his predecessor, he pursued policies of economic austerity, rather than deficit spending.

===Domestic elections===

President De la Madrid initially stated that further democratization of the country was necessary, and the political system opened up to greater competition. As other parties showed the potential for their electoral success, however, his attitude later seemed to be hostile to the advance of opposition parties, instead allowing the PRI to maintain near-absolute power of the country (at the time, the PRI still governed all of the Mexican states plus the Federal District, in addition to holding 299 of the 400 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 63 of the 64 seats in the Senate). However, it was during his administration that the opposition National Action Party (also known as &quot;PAN&quot; for its initials in Spanish) started to become popular with the masses, especially in Northern Mexico.

In 1983, during the municipal elections in the northern state of Chihuahua, the PAN won the state&#x27;s nine biggest Municipalities, which held 70% of its population. The border state had been one of the most affected by the government&#x27;s policies, specially the nationalization of the Bank decreed in the last months of former President López Portillo&#x27;s administration. Rather than accepting that the unpopularity and corruption of the PRI in Chihuahua had led to such a defeat, the local PRI bosses claimed that the Catholic Church, the local businessmen and even &quot;foreign influences&quot; had persuaded voters to support the PAN. Most importantly, the local PRI stated that the electoral defeat was a &quot;tragic disaster&quot; that should never be repeated.

The 1986 gubernatorial elections in that same state [es] were marked by accusations of Electoral fraud. Although the PRI candidate, Fernando Baeza, was officially pronounced winner, the PAN candidate Francisco Barrio Terrazas, who officially ended in second place with 35.16% of the vote (at the time, the biggest percentage of votes that an opposition candidate had earned in Chihuahua) did not recognize the results, and the PAN promoted acts of civil disobedience to resist the alleged fraud. Many other local elections were marked by accusations of fraud in those years, sometimes ending with violent clashes. In some small municipalities of Veracruz and Oaxaca, the local population even seized or burned the local Town halls in response to alleged electoral frauds.

===Electoral reform===
In response to these controversies, an electoral reform was conducted in 1986:
* The number of members of the Chamber of Deputies being elected by proportional representation (&quot;plurinominales&quot;) was increased from 100 to 200 and allowed for a better representation of opposition parties.
* The Senate is composed of two senators from each state and two from the Federal District of Mexico. An election of half of its members takes place every three years.
* The Legislative Assembly of the Federal District of Mexico was created.
=== Attempt to legalize abortion ===
Since his campaign for the presidency, De la Madrid had mentioned the importance of discussing the topic of abortion, given the high national demographic growth and the scarce resources that the country had to deal with the necessities of an ever-growing population, specially in the middle of the economic crisis.

Upon becoming President, De la Madrid and the Attorney General Sergio García Ramírez attempted to reform the Penal Code of the Federal District to decriminalize abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy &quot;due to failure of the contraceptive methods, fetal alterations and pregnancies due to rape, with previous medical authorization and carried out at a hospital center&quot;. However, due to the highly negative reaction of the Catholic church and the conservative sectors, the initiative was finally withdrawn.

===1984 Molotov cocktail attack===
On 1 May 1984, an anti-government activist named José Antonio Palacios Marquina, along with others, threw Molotov cocktails at the balcony of the Presidential Palace, where De la Madrid was reviewing the May Day parade. Although the President was unharmed, the incident left many officials and guests injured, including the then-director of the ISSTE, Alejandro Carrillo.

===San Juanico explosions===
On 19 November 1984, a massive series of explosions occurred at a liquid petroleum gas (LPG) tank farm in the town of San Juan Ixhuatepec (outside of Mexico City, Mexico).
The disaster was initiated by a gas leak on the site, likely caused by a pipe during transfer operations, which caused a plume of LPG to concentrate at ground level for 10 minutes. The plume eventually grew large enough to drift on the wind towards the west end of the site, where the facility&#x27;s waste-gas flare pit was located. The explosions devastated the town of San Juan Ixhuatepec, and resulted in 500-600 deaths and 7,000 people with severe injuries.

The tragedy sparked a national outrage, and President De la Madrid visited the affected area on 20 November. He instructed the creation of a commission to help the survivors and to rebuild the destroyed homes. On 22 December, the Procuraduría General de Justicia found the state-run oil company Pemex to be responsible for the incident, and was ordered to pay indemnification to the victims. Due to the tragedy apparently having been caused by corruption and incompetence at the state-run company, the public further resented the Government and public institutions.

===1985 Earthquake===

In the morning of 19 September 1985, an 8.0 magnitude earthquake devastated Mexico City and caused the deaths of at least 5,000 people. De La Madrid&#x27;s mishandling of the disaster damaged his popularity because of his initial refusal of international aid. It placed Mexico&#x27;s delicate path to economic recovery in an even more precarious situation, as the destruction extended to other parts of the country.

The federal government&#x27;s first public response was President de la Madrid&#x27;s declaration of a period of mourning for three days starting from 20 September 1985.

De la Madrid initially refused to send the military to assist on the rescue efforts, and it was later deployed to patrol streets only to prevent looting after a curfew was imposed.

The earthquake created many political difficulties for the then-ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) or Institutional Revolutionary Party. The crisis was severe enough to have tested the capabilities of wealthier countries, but the government from local PRI bosses to President de la Madrid himself exacerbated the problem aside from the lack of money. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared it would not request aid.

It was also widely reported in the days after the earthquake that the military assisted factory owners in retrieving their machinery rather than in removing the bodies of dead factory workers.

President de la Madrid was also criticized for refusing to cut foreign debt payments to use the money to help with the recovery effort (at the time, his administration destined around 30% of the federal budget towards the payments of the foreign debt). The government&#x27;s response to the earthquake was widely criticized at various levels of Mexican society, being seen as both authoritarian and incompetent. As most of the collapsed buildings were of recent construction and public works projects, the government was seen at fault due to mismanagement and corruption in these constructions. The government itself realized that it could not handle the crisis alone through already-established institutions and decided to open the process up to &quot;opposition groups&quot;.

===1986 FIFA World Cup===

During his administration, Mexico hosted the 1986 FIFA World Cup. There were some protests against the tournament, as Mexico was going through an economic crisis at the time and the country was still recovering from the 1985 earthquake, therefore the World Cup was considered by many as a lavish and unnecessary expense. During the World Cup&#x27;s inauguration at the Estadio Azteca on 31 May, just before the opening match Italy vs Bulgaria, De la Madrid was jeered by a crowd of 100,000 while trying to give a speech, apparently in protest over his administration&#x27;s poor reaction to the 1985 earthquake. An official who was present at the event recalled that &quot;[The President&#x27;s] words were completely drowned out by boos and whistles [...] I was dying with embarrassment, but it seemed to be the right metaphor for the mood of the country.&quot;

===Split in the PRI===
In October 1986, a group of politicians from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) led by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, Porfirio Muñoz Ledo and Ifigenia Martínez, announced the creation of the Democratic Current (&quot;Corriente Democrática&quot;) within the PRI. The Democratic Current demanded the establishment of clear rules for the selection of the party&#x27;s presidential candidate. When they failed, Cárdenas, Muñoz Ledo and Martínez left the PRI the following year and created the National Democratic Front (&quot;Frente Democrático Nacional&quot;), a loose alliance of left-wing parties.

===Drug trafficking===
As the U.S. consumption of illegal substances grew in the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. became interested in strengthening enforcement of drug trafficking in Mexico. In the 1980s U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush expanded the so-called &quot;war on drugs&quot; to stop drugs at ports of entry from Mexico. More importantly, the U.S. began asserting extraterritorial jurisdiction over drug trafficking in Mexican national territory. The crackdown on drug trafficking resulted in higher prices for drugs, since there was more risk involved, but trafficking in this era boomed. Drug trafficking organizations in Mexico grew in size and strength. As the U.S. asserted jurisdiction over trafficking in Mexico, Mexico could no longer pursue an autonomous drug policy. Agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began operating in Mexico without the consent of Mexican authorities. &quot;In 1987, De la Madrid declared drug trafficking a national security problem and completely reorganized Mexican antidrug policy&quot; and more government financial and personnel resources were devoted to the policy. Arrests in 1987 for drug trafficking reached 17,000. Front-line enforcement agents of the Mexican police were often corrupted by bribes from drug traffickers. Violence between traffickers and the police increased in this period. A major incident in the drug war and in U.S.-Mexican relations was the kidnap, torture, and murder of DEA agent Enrique &quot;Kiki&quot; Camarena in 1985. In 1984, the Mexican government had staged a raid on a suspected site of drug trafficking in Chihuahua state. Traffickers suspected Camarena of providing information to the Mexican government and he was abducted in February 1985, tortured and killed; his body was found a month later. The U.S. responded by sending a special unit of the DEA to coordinate the investigation in Mexico. In the investigation, Mexican government officials were implicated, including Manuel Ibarra Herrera, past director of Mexican Federal Judicial Police, and Miguel Aldana Ibarra, the former director of Interpol in Mexico. Drug trafficking as an issue has continued in Mexico in succeeding presidential administrations.

===Foreign policy===

In 1983, the Contadora Group was launched by Colombia, Panama, Venezuela and Mexico to promote peace in Latin America and to deal with the armed conflicts in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala.

On 31 March 1986, the Mexicana Flight 940 crashed in the state of Michoacán, killing everyone on board. Initially, two Middle Eastern terrorist groups claimed responsibility for this crash, along with the bombing of TWA Flight 840, which occurred just two days later. An anonymous letter signed by those groups claimed that a suicide mission had sabotaged the plane in retaliation against the United States. However, sabotage was later dismissed as a cause of the crash, and the investigations carried out by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Mexican aeronautical authorities concluded that the cause of the accident was that the center landing gear tire was filled with compressed air, instead of nitrogen.

==1988 election==

Galloping inflation, the controversial privatization program and austerity measures imposed by his administration caused the ruling party to lose ground, leading up to the controversial elections of 1988. In the assessment of political scientist Roderic Ai Camp, &quot;It would be fair to say that the election of Carlos Salinas de Gortari in 1988 marked the low point of that office as well as the declining legitimacy of the state.&quot; In 1987, an internal conflict led to a division in the PRI, as President De la Madrid, like previous PRIísta Presidents had traditionally done, handpicked his successor for the Presidency and appointed the Secretary of Budget and Programming, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, as the PRI candidate for the 1988 elections. A group of left-wing PRI politicians, led by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas (the son of former President Lázaro Cárdenas) and Porfirio Muñoz Ledo, protested Salinas&#x27; appointment as they demanded that the PRI should put an end to the practice of the President choosing his own successor, and proposed that the PRI Presidential candidate should be democratically chosen by all of the PRI members through a convention. They also claimed that President De la Madrid had gone too far with his austerity and free-market reforms, and that his protégée Salinas represented a continuation of such policies. After many public discussions and proposals, the leadership of the PRI stood by President De la Madrid and confirmed Salinas as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate, while expelling Cárdenas and Muñoz Ledo from the PRI, along with their followers.

For the first time since the PRI took power in 1929, the elections featured two strong opposition candidates with enough popularity to beat the PRI candidate. On one hand, after he and Muñoz Ledo were expelled from the PRI, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas was nominated presidential candidate by the Frente Democrático Nacional, a coalition of leftist parties. Cárdenas attained massive popularity as result of his efforts at democratizing the PRI, his successful tenure as Governor of Michoacán, his opposition to the austerity reforms and his association with his father&#x27;s nationalist policies. On the other hand, the right-wing opposition party PAN nominated Manuel Clouthier as their presidential candidate. A businessman-turned-politician, Clouthier became popular, specially in Northern Mexico, for his populist rhetoric and his dennouncement of the political establishment and the media.

On Election Day 1988, the computer system used to count the votes shut down, as Cárdenas held an initial lead. That event is remembered by the phrase &quot;se cayó el sistema&quot; (&quot;the system crashed&quot;). When the system was restored, Carlos Salinas was declared the winner. The expression &quot;se cayó el sistema&quot; became a euphemism for electoral fraud. All the opposition candidates refused to recognize the official results and claimed that a massive electoral fraud had been orchestrated by the government. Nevertheless, Salinas was confirmed by the Chamber of Deputies, controlled by the PRI, as the winner.

==Post-presidency==
===Director of Fondo de Cultura Económica===
After completing his term, he became the director of the Fondo de Cultura Económica (FCE) in 1990. He implanted modernization programs in production and administration. It incorporated the most advanced techniques in book publishing and graphic arts and maintained the openness and plurality features in the publication policy of the company.

On 4 September 1992, he inaugurated the new facilities, on 227 Picacho-Ajusco Road. Surrounded by garden and offices, it hosts cultural unity Jesús Silva Herzog, the Gonzalo Robles Library, which houses the growing publishing history of the Fund, and the seller Alfonso Reyes.

On the international scene in 1990, the existing facilities were remodeled subsidiaries. The presence of the Economic Culture Fund acquired a larger projection in the Americas: on 7 September 1990, the subsidiary in San Diego, California, was founded. On 21 June 1991 Seller Azteca opened its doors in São Paulo, Brazil. In 1994 FCE facilities were inaugurated in Venezuela, and in 1998, another subsidiary was established in Guatemala. This Thus, the FCE reached a significant presence in Latin America with nine subsidiaries: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Spain, United States, Guatemala, Peru and Venezuela.

In publishing field, under his direction, 21 new collections were launched: in 1990, Keys (Argentina) in 1991, A la Orilla del Viento, Mexican Codices, University Science and Special Editions of At the Edge of the wind; in 1992, Breviary of Contemporary Science (Argentina) and New Economic Culture, in 1993 Library Prospective, Mexican Library, Library Cervantes Prize (Spain), and History of the Americas Trust and Cruises, in 1994, Word of Life and Indians A Vision of America and the Modernization of Mexico; Files, Sunstone (Peru), Entre Voces, Reading and Designated Fund 2000; Encounters (Peru) History of Mexico, and five periodicals: Galeras Fund, Periolibros, Images, Spaces for Reading and the Fund page.

During his administration, the FCE received several awards, among them: in 1992, FILIJ Book Award (CNCA) to children&#x27;s books, in 1993 Golden Laurel Award (Department of Culture of the City of Madrid) in 1993, honorable mention Juan García Bacca (Peruvian Cultural Association) Award, and Gold Aztec Calendar (Mexican Association of Radio and Television). In 1994 and 1995 Award Book Bank of Venezuela for children&#x27;s books.

The Spanish Council for Latin American Studies, distinguished him for his contributions to the development of reading in the Spanish language, received in 1997 the IUS Award by the Faculty of Law of the UNAM, and in 1998 the government of France awarded him the Academic Palms in rank of Commander for his contribution to cultural development. In 1999, Mr. De la Madrid received the medal Picasso Gold (UNESCO), for their work on the diffusion of Latin American culture.

===Controversial statements===
De la Madrid made headlines in May 2009 after a controversial interview with journalist Carmen Aristegui. During the interview, he said that his choice of Carlos Salinas de Gortari to succeed him in the Presidency had been a mistake and that he felt &quot;very disappointed&quot; in his successor, lamenting the widespread corruption of the Salinas administration. De la Madrid then directly accused Salinas of having stolen the money of the Presidential slush fund, and also accused his brother Raúl Salinas de Gortari of having ties to drug lords.

Only two hours after the interview had been broadcast, a group of PRI leaders, including Emilio Gamboa Patrón, Ramón Aguirre, Francisco Rojas, and De la Madrid&#x27;s sons Enrique and Federico, arrived at De la Madrid&#x27;s home and reportedly asked him to retract his statements, arguing that they could damage the party. As a result, on the same day De la Madrid issued a statement retracting the comments he had made during the interview with Aristegui, claiming that due to his advanced age and his poor health, he was not able to &quot;correctly process&quot; the questions.

==Death==
De la Madrid died on 1 April 2012, at 7:30 am in a Mexican hospital, following a lengthy hospitalization due to complications from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which led to acute kidney injury and cardiac arrest.

==Public image and legacy==

Unlike his predecessors (specially Luis Echeverría and José López Portillo), President De la Madrid was noted for making relatively few speeches and keeping a more reserved and moderate public image. Although that has been attributed to a strategy to break with his predecessors&#x27; populist legacies, President De la Madrid&#x27;s public image was considered &quot;gray&quot; by critics. This perception worsened with his government&#x27;s slow response to the 1985 Earthquake, when President De la Madrid also rejected International aid in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy.

President De la Madrid&#x27;s biggest legacy may have been his implementation of economic neoliberal reforms in Mexico, breaking with decades of economic nationalism, and beginning mass privatization of state-run companies, a process which would be further deepened during the administration of his successor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. De la Madrid was also the first of the so-called Technocrats to become president. On the other hand, those reforms and his unwillingness to allow a primary election to choose the PRI candidate for the 1988 Presidential elections are credited as the factors which led to the split of the party in 1987, with Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas and Porfirio Muñoz Ledo founding the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD by its initials in Spanish) in 1989, taking a great number of former priístas with them.

Under his &quot;Moral Renovation&quot; campaign, his administration attempted to fight corruption at all Government levels, fulfilling Mexico&#x27;s foreign debt compromises, and creating the Secretaría de la Contraloría General de la Federación (Secretariat of the General Inspectorate of the Federation) to guarantee fiscal discipline and to keep an eye on possible corrupt officials. Nevertheless, his administration still had some corruption scandals of its own, the most notorious being the murder of journalist Manuel Buendía in 1984 by agents of the Federal Security Directorate (Buendía had been investigating possible ties between Drug cartels, the CIA and the FSD itself). De la Madrid shut down the FSD in 1985, although in its place similar Intelligence agencies would be created in subsequent years.

Finally, his administration&#x27;s handling of the 1986 elections in Chihuahua and, specially, the 1988 Presidential elections, remains highly controversial.

In a 1998 interview for a documentary produced by Clío TV about his administration, De la Madrid himself concluded:

&quot;What hurts me the most, is that those years of economic adjustment and structural change, were also characterized by a deterioration of the income distribution, a depression of the real wages, and an insufficient creation of jobs. In summary, by a deterioration of the social conditions.&quot;

In a national survey conducted in 2012, 36% of the respondents considered that the De la Madrid administration was &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, 26% responded that it was an &quot;average&quot; administration, and 30% responded that it was a &quot;very bad&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; administration.

<text>The common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus), also known as simply wood pigeon, is a large species in the dove and pigeon family (Columbidae), native to the western Palearctic. It belongs to the genus &quot;Columba,&quot; which includes closely related species such as the rock dove (&quot;Columba livia&quot;). It has a flexible diet, predominantly feeding on vegetable matter, including cereal crops, leading to them being regarded as an agricultural pest. Wood pigeons are extensively hunted over large parts of their range, but this does not seem to have a great impact on their population.

==Taxonomy==
The common wood pigeon was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other pigeons in the genus &quot;Columba&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Columba palumbus&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;palumbus&quot; is an alternate form of the Latin &quot;palumbes&quot; for a wood pigeon.

Five subspecies are recognised, one of which is now extinct:

* &quot;C. p. palumbus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – Europe to western Siberia and Iraq; Northwest Africa
* † &quot;C. p. maderensis&quot; Tschusi, 1904 – Madeira (extinct)
* &quot;C. p. azorica&quot; Hartert, 1905 – the eastern and central Azores
* &quot;C. p. iranica&quot; (Zarudny, 1910) – southwestern and northern Iran to southwestern Turkmenistan
* &quot;C. p. casiotis&quot; (Bonaparte, 1854) – southeastern Iran and Kazakhstan to western China, northwestern India and Nepal
† = extinct

Fossil records of the species are known from the early Middle Pleistocene of Sicily.

== Description ==

The three Western European &quot;Columba&quot; pigeons, common wood pigeon, stock dove and rock dove, though superficially alike, have very distinctive characteristics; the common wood pigeon may be identified at once by its larger size at and weight , and the white on its neck and wing. It is otherwise a basically grey bird, with a pinkish breast. The wingspan can range from and the wing chord measures . The tail measures , the bill is and the tarsus is . Adult birds bear a series of green and white patches on their necks, and a pink patch on their chest. The eye colour is a pale yellow, in contrast to that of rock doves, which is orange-red, and the stock dove, which is black.

Juvenile birds do not have the white patches on either side of the neck. When they are about 6 months old (about three months out of the nest) they gain small white patches on both sides of the neck, which gradually enlarge until they are fully formed when the bird is about 6–8 months old. Juvenile birds also have a greyer beak and an overall lighter grey appearance than adult birds.

== Distribution and habitat ==
In the colder northern and eastern parts of Europe and western Asia the common wood pigeon is a migrant, but in southern and western Europe it is a well distributed and often abundant resident. In Great Britain wood pigeons are commonly seen in parks and gardens and are seen with increasing numbers in towns and cities.

== Behaviour ==


Its flight is quick, performed by regular beats, with an occasional sharp flick of the wings, characteristic of pigeons in general. It takes off with a loud clattering. It perches well, and in its nuptial display walks along a horizontal branch with swelled neck, lowered wings, and fanned tail. During the display flight the bird climbs, the wings are smartly cracked like a whiplash, and the bird glides down on stiff wings. The common wood pigeon is gregarious, often forming very large flocks outside the breeding season. Like many species of pigeon, wood pigeons take advantage of trees and buildings to gain a vantage point over the surrounding area, and their distinctive call means that they are usually heard before they are seen.

Wood pigeons are known to fiercely defend their territory, and will fight each other to gain access to nesting and roosting locations. Male wood pigeons will typically attempt to drive competitors off by threat displays and pursuit, but will also directly fight, jumping and striking their rival with both wings.

This species can be an agricultural pest, and it is often shot, being a legal quarry species in most European countries. It is wary in rural areas, but often quite tame where it is not persecuted.

=== Breeding ===
 It breeds in trees in woods, parks and gardens, laying two white eggs in a simple stick nest which hatch after 17 to 19 days. Wood pigeons seem to have a preference for trees near roadways and rivers. Males exhibit aggressive behaviour towards each other during the breeding season by jumping and flapping wings at each other. Their plumage becomes much darker, especially the head, during hot summer periods. Breeding can happen year round if there is food abundant however breeding season most commonly occurs between April and October.

The nests are vulnerable to attack, particularly by crows. The young usually fly at 33 to 34 days; however, if the nest is disturbed, some young may be able to survive having left the nest as early as 20 days from hatching.

In a study carried out using ring-recovery data, the survival rate for juveniles in their first year was 52 per cent, and the adult annual survival rate was 61 per cent. For birds that survive the first year the typical lifespan is thus only three years, but the maximum recorded age is 17 years and 8 months for a bird ringed and recovered on the Orkney Islands.

=== Diet ===
Most of its diet is vegetable, round and fleshy leaves from Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae, and cruciferous vegetables taken from open fields or gardens and lawns; young shoots and seedlings are favoured, and it will take grain, pine nuts, and certain fruits and berries. In the autumn they also eat figs and acorns, and in winter buds of trees and bushes. They will also eat larvae, ants, and small worms. They need open water to drink and bathe in. Young common wood pigeons swiftly become fat, as a result of the crop milk they are fed by their parents. This is an extremely rich fluid that is produced in the adult birds&#x27; crops during the breeding season.

=== Calls ===
The call of the wood pigeon is a loud and sustained characteristic cooing phrase, &quot;coo-COO-COO-coo-coo&quot;. In Ireland and the UK, the traditional mnemonic for the distinctive call of the bird has been interpreted as &quot;Take two cows, Teddy&quot;, or &quot;Take two cows, Taffy&quot;. Other interpretations for the birdsong include &quot;I am a pigeon&quot;, &quot;My toe bleeds, Betty&quot;, and &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go&quot;.
== Predators ==
Predators of the wood pigeon typically consist of the Eurasian sparrowhawk, Eurasian goshawk and domestic cat. The eggs and babies of wood pigeons are also often predated by magpies and crows.

== Hunting ==
The wood pigeon is widely hunted over large parts of its range, with millions of birds being shot annually, in part because it has been regarded as an agricultural pest, especially of cereal crops. In 1953, the British Government introduced a subsidy for the cost of cartridges to sport-hunters of wood pigeons, which was later abolished in 1969.

==In culture==
The wood pigeon is mentioned several times in the &quot;Eclogues&quot; written by the ancient Roman poet Virgil. Referring to its distinctive husky call, Virgil writes in &quot;Eclogue&quot; 1;

Here beneath high rocks
The gatherers of leaves, with cheerful songs
Fill the high winds. Meanwhile thy turtle doves
And hoarse wood pigeons from the lofty elms
Make endless moan.

<text>Bienvenidos &quot;(Spanish for &quot;Welcome&quot;)&quot; is a Venezuelan sketch comedy television show. Produced and hosted by Miguel Ángel Landa, the show was produced by Venevisión from 1982 until 2001, when the show moved to Televen for its final season. It has been taped both at Venevisión&#x27;s studios and on location across Venezuela.

==Premise==
Aired weekly, Bienvenidos consists of 20 to 25 comic sketches that usually take on couples, homosexuals, doctors and other members of society as the target of their jokes. During its latest years, most of the sketches had a sexual edge to them.

Some of the most popular characters on the show include:

* &quot;El Loco Hugo&quot; (Koke Corona), a lunatic who likes to flash women
* &quot;Manolo,&quot; (Gustavo Gonzalez) the Spaniard from Galicia
* &quot;Rigoberto&quot; (Kike Corona), who has the mentality of a 10-year-old-boy and whose &quot;wives&quot; always cheat on him, to which he invariably screams, &quot;¡Tú no me quieres!&quot; (&quot;You don&#x27;t love me!&quot;)
* &quot;Enrico&quot; (Ernesto Cortéz), a gay character that occasionally starts out masculine, but then behaves effeminately and his voice is altered in pitch
* &quot;Briagoberto,&quot; (Gustavo Gonzalez) a perpetually drunk man
* &quot;Nino Frescobaldi&quot; (Julio Gassette), a naughty man who wears a bow tie
* &quot;Boberto&quot; (Julio Gassette), literally &quot;Dumbert&quot;, a dim-witted man

Some of the show&#x27;s more well-known sketches are:

*&quot;Ay, Mama&quot;: The general idea of the sketch is somebody will make some kind of embarrassing gaffe, to which they will utter, &quot;Ay, Mama!&quot; (Oh, Mother!&quot;, similar to the English language saying, Oh, Brother!&quot;)
*&quot;El Chiste Incomprensible (The incomprehensible Joke)&quot;: a joke with a double entendre, usually in a sexual connotation.
*&quot;Viejo, viejo, viejo, pero bueno, bueno, bueno (Old old old but good good good)&quot;: a classic joke that still is funny.

Among the many comedians in this show are Landa&#x27;s daughter Dayana, Ernesto Cortés and María Antonieta Duque. She and Cortez ended up marrying in real life, but they later separated.

&quot;Bienvenidos&quot; is shown on networks throughout the Spanish-speaking world. One of those networks was Univision in the United States, which carried the program during the 1990s, its Galavision channel also carried re-runs of the program.

==DVD releases==

Venevision International And Image Entertainment has released several themed collections of sketches from the show on DVD. The titles are:
*&quot;Bienvenidos en la playa&quot; (Bienvenidos on the Beach)
*&quot;Bienvenidos en la alcoba&quot; (Bienvenidos in the Bedroom)
*&quot;Bienvenidos en el restaurante&quot; (Bienvenidos in the Restaurant)
*&quot;Lo mejor de Bienvenidos: Sus Personajes&quot; (The Best of Bienvenidos: The Characters)
*&quot;Bienvenidos en la oficina&quot; (Bienvenidos at the Office)

Each title is hosted by Maria Antonieta Duque.

&quot;Bienvenidos&quot; is similar in format to a Canadian sketch comedy, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot;, but it is intended to an adult audience.

<doc id="323592" wikidata="Q619" url="?curid=323592" title="Nicolaus Copernicus">
<text>Nicolaus Copernicus (19 February 1473 – 24 May 1543) was a Renaissance polymath, active as a mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic canon, who formulated a model of the universe that placed the Sun rather than Earth at its center. Copernicus likely developed his model independently of Aristarchus of Samos, an ancient Greek astronomer who had formulated such a model some eighteen centuries earlier.

The publication of Copernicus&#x27;s model in his book &quot;&quot; (&quot;On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres&quot;), just before his death in 1543, was a major event in the history of science, triggering the Copernican Revolution and making a pioneering contribution to the Scientific Revolution.

Copernicus was born and died in Royal Prussia, a semiautonomous and multilingual region created within the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland from part of the lands regained from the Teutonic Order after the Thirteen Years&#x27; War. A polyglot and polymath, he obtained a doctorate in canon law and was a mathematician, astronomer, physician, classics scholar, translator, governor, diplomat, and economist. From 1497 he was a Warmian Cathedral chapter canon. In 1517 he derived a quantity theory of money—a key concept in economics—and in 1519 he formulated an economic principle that later came to be called Gresham&#x27;s law.

== Life ==
Nicolaus Copernicus was born on 19 February 1473 in the city of Toruń (Thorn), in the province of Royal Prussia, in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, to German-speaking parents.

His father was a merchant from Kraków and his mother was the daughter of a wealthy Toruń merchant. Nicolaus was the youngest of four children. His brother Andreas (Andrew) became an Augustinian canon at Frombork (Frauenburg). His sister Barbara, named after her mother, became a Benedictine nun and, in her final years, prioress of a convent in Chełmno (Kulm); she died after 1517. His sister Katharina married the businessman and Toruń city councilor Barthel Gertner and left five children, whom Copernicus looked after to the end of his life. Copernicus never married and is not known to have had children, but from at least 1531 until 1539 his relations with Anna Schilling, a live-in housekeeper, were seen as scandalous by two bishops of Warmia who urged him over the years to break off relations with his &quot;mistress&quot;.

=== Father&#x27;s family ===
Copernicus&#x27;s father&#x27;s family can be traced to a village in Silesia between Nysa (Neiße) and Prudnik (Neustadt). The village&#x27;s name has been variously spelled Kopernik, Copernik, Copernic, Kopernic, Coprirnik, and modern Koperniki.

In the 14th century, members of the family began moving to various other Silesian cities, to the Polish capital, Kraków (1367), and to Toruń (1400). The father, Mikołaj the Elder (or ), likely the son of Jan (or Johann), came from the Kraków line.

Nicolaus was named after his father, who appears in records for the first time as a well-to-do merchant who dealt in copper, selling it mostly in Danzig (Gdańsk). He moved from Kraków to Toruń around 1458. Toruń, situated on the Vistula River, was at that time embroiled in the Thirteen Years&#x27; War, in which the Kingdom of Poland and the Prussian Confederation, an alliance of Prussian cities, gentry and clergy, fought the Teutonic Order over control of the region. In this war, Hanseatic cities like Danzig and Toruń, Nicolaus Copernicus&#x27;s hometown, chose to support the Polish King, Casimir IV Jagiellon, who promised to respect the cities&#x27; traditional vast independence, which the Teutonic Order had challenged. Nicolaus&#x27;s father was actively engaged in the politics of the day and supported Poland and the cities against the Teutonic Order. In 1454 he mediated negotiations between Poland&#x27;s Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki and the Prussian cities for repayment of war loans. In the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), the Teutonic Order formally renounced all claims to the conquered lands, which returned to Poland as Royal Prussia and remained part of it until the First (1772) and Second (1793) Partitions of Poland.

Copernicus&#x27;s father married Barbara Watzenrode, the astronomer&#x27;s mother, between 1461 and 1464. He died about 1483.

=== Mother&#x27;s family ===
Nicolaus&#x27;s mother, Barbara Watzenrode, was the daughter of a wealthy Toruń patrician and city councillor, Lucas Watzenrode the Elder (deceased 1462), and Katarzyna (widow of Jan Peckau), mentioned in other sources as &quot;Katarzyna Rüdiger gente Modlibóg&quot; (deceased 1476). The Modlibógs were a prominent Polish family who had been well known in Poland&#x27;s history since 1271. The Watzenrode family, like the Kopernik family, had come from Silesia from near Schweidnitz (Świdnica), and after 1360 had settled in Toruń. They soon became one of the wealthiest and most influential patrician families. Through the Watzenrodes&#x27; extensive family relationships by marriage, Copernicus was related to wealthy families of Toruń (Thorn), Danzig (Gdansk) and Elbing (Elbląg), and to prominent Polish noble families of Prussia: the Czapskis, Działyńskis, Konopackis and Kościeleckis. Lucas and Katherine had three children: Lucas Watzenrode the Younger (1447–1512), who would become Bishop of Warmia and Copernicus&#x27;s patron; Barbara, the astronomer&#x27;s mother (deceased after 1495); and Christina (deceased before 1502), who in 1459 married the Toruń merchant and mayor, Tiedeman von Allen.

Lucas Watzenrode the Elder, a wealthy merchant and in 1439–62 president of the judicial bench, was a decided opponent of the Teutonic Knights. In 1453 he was the delegate from Toruń at the Grudziądz (Graudenz) conference that planned the uprising against them. During the ensuing Thirteen Years&#x27; War, he actively supported the Prussian cities&#x27; war effort with substantial monetary subsidies (only part of which he later re-claimed), with political activity in Toruń and Danzig, and by personally fighting in battles at Łasin (Lessen) and Malbork (Marienburg). He died in 1462.

Lucas Watzenrode the Younger, the astronomer&#x27;s maternal uncle and patron, was educated at the University of Kraków and at the universities of Cologne and Bologna. He was a bitter opponent of the Teutonic Order, and its Grand Master once referred to him as &quot;the devil incarnate&quot;. In 1489 Watzenrode was elected Bishop of Warmia (Ermeland, Ermland) against the preference of King Casimir IV, who had hoped to install his own son in that seat. As a result, Watzenrode quarreled with the king until Casimir IV&#x27;s death three years later. Watzenrode was then able to form close relations with three successive Polish monarchs: John I Albert, Alexander Jagiellon, and Sigismund I the Old. He was a friend and key advisor to each ruler, and his influence greatly strengthened the ties between Warmia and Poland proper. Watzenrode came to be considered the most powerful man in Warmia, and his wealth, connections and influence allowed him to secure Copernicus&#x27;s education and career as a canon at Frombork Cathedral.

=== Education ===
==== Early education ====
Copernicus&#x27;s father died around 1483, when the boy was 10. His maternal uncle, Lucas Watzenrode the Younger (1447–1512), took Copernicus under his wing and saw to his education and career. Six years later, Watzenrode was elected Bishop of Warmia. Watzenrode maintained contacts with leading intellectual figures in Poland and was a friend of the influential Italian-born humanist and Kraków courtier Filippo Buonaccorsi. There are no surviving primary documents on the early years of Copernicus&#x27;s childhood and education. Copernicus biographers assume that Watzenrode first sent young Copernicus to St. John&#x27;s School, at Toruń, where he himself had been a master. Later, according to Armitage, the boy attended the Cathedral School at Włocławek, up the Vistula River from Toruń, which prepared pupils for entrance to the University of Kraków.

===== University of Kraków 1491–1495 =====
In the winter semester of 1491–92 Copernicus, as &quot;Nicolaus Nicolai de Thuronia&quot;, matriculated together with his brother Andrew at the University of Kraków. Copernicus began his studies in the Department of Arts (from the fall of 1491, presumably until the summer or fall of 1495) in the heyday of the Kraków astronomical-mathematical school, acquiring the foundations for his subsequent mathematical achievements. According to a later but credible tradition (Jan Brożek), Copernicus was a pupil of Albert Brudzewski, who by then (from 1491) was a professor of Aristotelian philosophy but taught astronomy privately outside the university; Copernicus became familiar with Brudzewski&#x27;s widely read commentary to Georg von Peuerbach&#x27;s &quot;Theoricæ novæ planetarum&quot; and almost certainly attended the lectures of Bernard of Biskupie and Wojciech Krypa of Szamotuły, and probably other astronomical lectures by Jan of Głogów, Michał of Wrocław (Breslau), Wojciech of Pniewy, and Marcin Bylica of Olkusz.

====== Mathematical astronomy ======
Copernicus&#x27;s Kraków studies gave him a thorough grounding in the mathematical astronomy taught at the university (arithmetic, geometry, geometric optics, cosmography, theoretical and computational astronomy) and a good knowledge of the philosophical and natural-science writings of Aristotle (&quot;De coelo&quot;, &quot;Metaphysics&quot;) and Averroes, stimulating his interest in learning and making him conversant with humanistic culture. Copernicus broadened the knowledge that he took from the university lecture halls with independent reading of books that he acquired during his Kraków years (Euclid, Haly Abenragel, the &quot;Alfonsine Tables&quot;, Johannes Regiomontanus&#x27; &quot;Tabulae directionum&quot;); to this period, probably, also date his earliest scientific notes, preserved partly at Uppsala University. At Kraków Copernicus began collecting a large library on astronomy; it would later be carried off as war booty by the Swedes during the Deluge in the 1650s and has been preserved at the Uppsala University Library.

====== Contradictions in the systems of Aristotle and Ptolemy ======
Copernicus&#x27;s four years at Kraków played an important role in the development of his critical faculties and initiated his analysis of logical contradictions in the two &quot;official&quot; systems of astronomy—Aristotle&#x27;s theory of homocentric spheres, and Ptolemy&#x27;s mechanism of eccentrics and epicycles—the surmounting and discarding of which would be the first step toward the creation of Copernicus&#x27;s own doctrine of the structure of the universe.

===== Warmia 1495–96 =====
Without taking a degree, probably in the fall of 1495, Copernicus left Kraków for the court of his uncle Watzenrode, who in 1489 had been elevated to Prince-Bishop of Warmia and soon (before November 1495) sought to place his nephew in the Warmia canonry vacated by the 26 August 1495 death of its previous tenant, Jan Czanow. For unclear reasons—probably due to opposition from part of the chapter, who appealed to Rome—Copernicus&#x27;s installation was delayed, inclining Watzenrode to send both his nephews to study canon law in Italy, seemingly with a view to furthering their ecclesiastic careers and thereby also strengthening his own influence in the Warmia chapter.

On 20 October 1497, Copernicus, by proxy, formally succeeded to the Warmia canonry which had been granted to him two years earlier. To this, by a document dated 10 January 1503 at Padua, he would add a sinecure at the Collegiate Church of the Holy Cross and St. Bartholomew in Wrocław (at the time in the Crown of Bohemia). Despite having been granted a papal indult on 29 November 1508 to receive further benefices, through his ecclesiastic career Copernicus not only did not acquire further prebends and higher stations (prelacies) at the chapter, but in 1538 he relinquished the Wrocław sinecure. It is unclear whether he was ever ordained a priest. Edward Rosen asserts that he was not. Copernicus did take minor orders, which sufficed for assuming a chapter canonry. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; proposes that his ordination was probable, as in 1537 he was one of four candidates for the episcopal seat of Warmia, a position that required ordination.

==== Italy ====
===== University of Bologna 1496–1501 =====
Meanwhile, leaving Warmia in mid-1496—possibly with the retinue of the chapter&#x27;s chancellor, Jerzy Pranghe, who was going to Italy—in the fall, possibly in October, Copernicus arrived in Bologna and a few months later (after 6 January 1497) signed himself into the register of the Bologna University of Jurists&#x27; &quot;German nation&quot;, which included young Poles from Silesia, Prussia and Pomerania as well as students of other nationalities.

During his three-year stay at Bologna, which occurred between fall 1496 and spring 1501, Copernicus seems to have devoted himself less keenly to studying canon law (he received his doctorate in canon law only after seven years, following a second return to Italy in 1503) than to studying the humanities—probably attending lectures by Filippo Beroaldo, Antonio Urceo, called Codro, Giovanni Garzoni, and Alessandro Achillini—and to studying astronomy. He met the famous astronomer Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara and became his disciple and assistant. Copernicus was developing new ideas inspired by reading the &quot;Epitome of the Almagest&quot; (&quot;Epitome in Almagestum Ptolemei&quot;) by George von Peuerbach and Johannes Regiomontanus (Venice, 1496). He verified its observations about certain peculiarities in Ptolemy&#x27;s theory of the Moon&#x27;s motion, by conducting on 9 March 1497 at Bologna a memorable observation of the occultation of Aldebaran, the brightest star in the Taurus constellation, by the Moon. Copernicus the humanist sought confirmation for his growing doubts through close reading of Greek and Latin authors (Pythagoras, Aristarchos of Samos, Cleomedes, Cicero, Pliny the Elder, Plutarch, Philolaus, Heraclides, Ecphantos, Plato), gathering, especially while at Padua, fragmentary historic information about ancient astronomical, cosmological and calendar systems.

===== Rome 1500 =====
Copernicus spent the jubilee year 1500 in Rome, where he arrived with his brother Andrew that spring, doubtless to perform an apprenticeship at the Papal Curia. Here, too, however, he continued his astronomical work begun at Bologna, observing, for example, a lunar eclipse on the night of 5–6 November 1500. According to a later account by Rheticus, Copernicus also—probably privately, rather than at the Roman &quot;Sapienza&quot;—as a &quot;Professor Mathematum&quot; (professor of astronomy) delivered, &quot;to numerous ... students and ... leading masters of the science&quot;, public lectures devoted probably to a critique of the mathematical solutions of contemporary astronomy.

===== University of Padua 1501–1503 =====
On his return journey doubtless stopping briefly at Bologna, in mid-1501 Copernicus arrived back in Warmia. After on 28 July receiving from the chapter a two-year extension of leave in order to study medicine (since &quot;he may in future be a useful medical advisor to our Reverend Superior [Bishop Lucas Watzenrode] and the gentlemen of the chapter&quot;), in late summer or in the fall he returned again to Italy, probably accompanied by his brother Andrew and by Canon Bernhard Sculteti. This time he studied at the University of Padua, famous as a seat of medical learning, and—except for a brief visit to Ferrara in May–June 1503 to pass examinations for, and receive, his doctorate in canon law—he remained at Padua from fall 1501 to summer 1503.

Copernicus studied medicine probably under the direction of leading Padua professors—Bartolomeo da Montagnana, Girolamo Fracastoro, Gabriele Zerbi, Alessandro Benedetti—and read medical treatises that he acquired at this time, by Valescus de Taranta, Jan Mesue, Hugo Senensis, Jan Ketham, Arnold de Villa Nova, and Michele Savonarola, which would form the embryo of his later medical library.

====== Astrology ======
One of the subjects that Copernicus must have studied was astrology, since it was considered an important part of a medical education. However, unlike most other prominent Renaissance astronomers, he appears never to have practiced or expressed any interest in astrology.

====== Greek studies ======
As at Bologna, Copernicus did not limit himself to his official studies. It was probably the Padua years that saw the beginning of his Hellenistic interests. He familiarized himself with Greek language and culture with the aid of Theodorus Gaza&#x27;s grammar (1495) and Johannes Baptista Chrestonius&#x27;s dictionary (1499), expanding his studies of antiquity, begun at Bologna, to the writings of Bessarion, Lorenzo Valla, and others. There also seems to be evidence that it was during his Padua stay that the idea finally crystallized, of basing a new system of the world on the movement of the Earth.
As the time approached for Copernicus to return home, in spring 1503 he journeyed to Ferrara where, on 31 May 1503, having passed the obligatory examinations, he was granted the degree of Doctor of Canon Law (&quot;Nicolaus Copernich de Prusia, Jure Canonico ... et doctoratus&quot;). No doubt it was soon after (at latest, in fall 1503) that he left Italy for good to return to Warmia.

=== Planetary observations ===
Copernicus made three observations of Mercury, with errors of −3, −15 and −1 minutes of arc. He made one of Venus, with an error of −24 minutes. Four were made of Mars, with errors of 2, 20, 77, and 137 minutes. Four observations were made of Jupiter, with errors of 32, 51, −11 and 25 minutes. He made four of Saturn, with errors of 31, 20, 23 and −4 minutes.

=== Other observations ===
With Novara, Copernicus observed an occultation of Aldebaran by the Moon on 9 March 1497. Copernicus also observed a conjunction of Saturn and the Moon on 4 March 1500. He saw an eclipse of the Moon on 6 November 1500.

=== Work ===


Having completed all his studies in Italy, 30-year-old Copernicus returned to Warmia, where he would live out the remaining 40 years of his life, apart from brief journeys to Kraków and to nearby Prussian cities: Toruń (Thorn), Gdańsk (Danzig), Elbląg (Elbing), Grudziądz (Graudenz), Malbork (Marienburg), Königsberg (Królewiec).

The Prince-Bishopric of Warmia enjoyed substantial autonomy, with its own diet (parliament) and monetary unit (the same as in the other parts of Royal Prussia) and treasury.

Copernicus was his uncle&#x27;s secretary and physician from 1503 to 1510 (or perhaps until his uncle&#x27;s death on 29 March 1512) and resided in the Bishop&#x27;s castle at Lidzbark (Heilsberg), where he began work on his heliocentric theory. In his official capacity, he took part in nearly all his uncle&#x27;s political, ecclesiastic and administrative-economic duties. From the beginning of 1504, Copernicus accompanied Watzenrode to sessions of the Royal Prussian diet held at Malbork and Elbląg and, write Dobrzycki and Hajdukiewicz, &quot;participated ... in all the more important events in the complex diplomatic game that ambitious politician and statesman played in defense of the particular interests of Prussia and Warmia, between hostility to the [Teutonic] Order and loyalty to the Polish Crown.&quot;

In 1504–1512 Copernicus made numerous journeys as part of his uncle&#x27;s retinue—in 1504, to Toruń and Gdańsk, to a session of the Royal Prussian Council in the presence of Poland&#x27;s King Alexander Jagiellon; to sessions of the Prussian diet at Malbork (1506), Elbląg (1507) and Sztum (Stuhm) (1512); and he may have attended a Poznań (Posen) session (1510) and the coronation of Poland&#x27;s King Sigismund I the Old in Kraków (1507). Watzenrode&#x27;s itinerary suggests that in spring 1509 Copernicus may have attended the Kraków sejm.

It was probably on the latter occasion, in Kraków, that Copernicus submitted for printing at Jan Haller&#x27;s press his translation, from Greek to Latin, of a collection, by the 7th-century Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta, of 85 brief poems called Epistles, or letters, supposed to have passed between various characters in a Greek story. They are of three kinds—&quot;moral&quot;, offering advice on how people should live; &quot;pastoral&quot;, giving little pictures of shepherd life; and &quot;amorous&quot;, comprising love poems. They are arranged to follow one another in a regular rotation of subjects. Copernicus had translated the Greek verses into Latin prose, and he published his version as &quot;Theophilacti scolastici Simocati epistolae morales, rurales et amatoriae interpretatione latina&quot;, which he dedicated to his uncle in gratitude for all the benefits he had received from him. With this translation, Copernicus declared himself on the side of the humanists in the struggle over the question of whether Greek literature should be revived. Copernicus&#x27;s first poetic work was a Greek epigram, composed probably during a visit to Kraków, for Johannes Dantiscus&#x27;s epithalamium for Barbara Zapolya&#x27;s 1512 wedding to King Zygmunt I the Old.

==== &quot;Commentariolus –&quot; an initial outline of a heliocentric theory ====
Some time before 1514, Copernicus wrote an initial outline of his heliocentric theory known only from later transcripts, by the title (perhaps given to it by a copyist), &quot;Nicolai Copernici de hypothesibus motuum coelestium a se constitutis commentariolus&quot;—commonly referred to as the &quot;Commentariolus&quot;. It was a succinct theoretical description of the world&#x27;s heliocentric mechanism, without mathematical apparatus, and differed in some important details of geometric construction from &quot;De revolutionibus&quot;; but it was already based on the same assumptions regarding Earth&#x27;s triple motions. The &quot;Commentariolus&quot;, which Copernicus consciously saw as merely a first sketch for his planned book, was not intended for printed distribution. He made only a very few manuscript copies available to his closest acquaintances, including, it seems, several Kraków astronomers with whom he collaborated in 1515–1530 in observing eclipses. Tycho Brahe would include a fragment from the &quot;Commentariolus&quot; in his own treatise, &quot;Astronomiae instauratae progymnasmata&quot;, published in Prague in 1602, based on a manuscript that he had received from the Bohemian physician and astronomer Tadeáš Hájek, a friend of Rheticus. The &quot;Commentariolus&quot; would appear complete in print for the first time only in 1878.

==== Astronomical observations 1513–1516 ====
In 1510 or 1512 Copernicus moved to Frombork, a town to the northwest at the Vistula Lagoon on the Baltic Sea coast. There, in April 1512, he participated in the election of Fabian of Lossainen as Prince-Bishop of Warmia. It was only in early June 1512 that the chapter gave Copernicus an &quot;external curia&quot;—a house outside the defensive walls of the cathedral mount. In 1514 he purchased the northwestern tower within the walls of the Frombork stronghold. He would maintain both these residences to the end of his life, despite the devastation of the chapter&#x27;s buildings by a raid against Frauenburg carried out by the Teutonic Order in January 1520, during which Copernicus&#x27;s astronomical instruments were probably destroyed. Copernicus conducted astronomical observations in 1513–1516 presumably from his external curia; and in 1522–1543, from an unidentified &quot;small tower&quot; (&quot;turricula&quot;), using primitive instruments modeled on ancient ones—the quadrant, triquetrum, armillary sphere. At Frombork Copernicus conducted over half of his more than 60 registered astronomical observations.

==== Administrative duties in Warmia ====
Having settled permanently at Frombork, where he would reside to the end of his life, with interruptions in 1516–1519 and 1520–21, Copernicus found himself at the Warmia chapter&#x27;s economic and administrative center, which was also one of Warmia&#x27;s two chief centers of political life. In the difficult, politically complex situation of Warmia, threatened externally by the Teutonic Order&#x27;s aggressions (attacks by Teutonic bands; the Polish–Teutonic War of 1519–1521; Albert&#x27;s plans to annex Warmia), internally subject to strong separatist pressures (the selection of the prince-bishops of Warmia; currency reform), he, together with part of the chapter, represented a program of strict cooperation with the Polish Crown and demonstrated in all his public activities (the defense of his country against the Order&#x27;s plans of conquest; proposals to unify its monetary system with the Polish Crown&#x27;s; support for Poland&#x27;s interests in the Warmia dominion&#x27;s ecclesiastic administration) that he was consciously a citizen of the Polish–Lithuanian Republic. Soon after the death of uncle Bishop Watzenrode, he participated in the signing of the Second Treaty of Piotrków Trybunalski (7 December 1512), governing the appointment of the Bishop of Warmia, declaring, despite opposition from part of the chapter, for loyal cooperation with the Polish Crown.

That same year (before 8 November 1512) Copernicus assumed responsibility, as &quot;magister pistoriae&quot;, for administering the chapter&#x27;s economic enterprises (he would hold this office again in 1530), having already since 1511 fulfilled the duties of chancellor and visitor of the chapter&#x27;s estates.

His administrative and economic duties did not distract Copernicus, in 1512–1515, from intensive observational activity. The results of his observations of Mars and Saturn in this period, and especially a series of four observations of the Sun made in 1515, led to the discovery of the variability of Earth&#x27;s eccentricity and of the movement of the solar apogee in relation to the fixed stars, which in 1515–1519 prompted his first revisions of certain assumptions of his system. Some of the observations that he made in this period may have had a connection with a proposed reform of the Julian calendar made in the first half of 1513 at the request of the Bishop of Fossombrone, Paul of Middelburg. Their contacts in this matter in the period of the Fifth Lateran Council were later memorialized in a complimentary mention in Copernicus&#x27;s dedicatory epistle in &quot;Dē revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; and in a treatise by Paul of Middelburg, &quot;Secundum compendium correctionis Calendarii&quot; (1516), which mentions Copernicus among the learned men who had sent the Council proposals for the calendar&#x27;s emendation.

During 1516–1521, Copernicus resided at Olsztyn (Allenstein) Castle as economic administrator of Warmia, including Olsztyn (Allenstein) and Pieniężno (Mehlsack). While there, he wrote a manuscript, &quot;Locationes mansorum desertorum&quot; (&quot;Locations of Deserted Fiefs&quot;), with a view to populating those fiefs with industrious farmers and so bolstering the economy of Warmia. When Olsztyn was besieged by the Teutonic Knights during the Polish–Teutonic War, Copernicus directed the defense of Olsztyn and Warmia by Royal Polish forces. He also represented the Polish side in the ensuing peace negotiations.

===== Advisor on monetary reform =====
Copernicus for years advised the Royal Prussian sejmik on monetary reform, particularly in the 1520s when that was a major question in regional Prussian politics. In 1526 he wrote a study on the value of money, &quot;Monetae cudendae ratio&quot;. In it he formulated an early iteration of the theory called Gresham&#x27;s law, that &quot;bad&quot; (debased) coinage drives &quot;good&quot; (un-debased) coinage out of circulation—several decades before Thomas Gresham. He also, in 1517, set down a quantity theory of money, a principal concept in modern economics. Copernicus&#x27;s recommendations on monetary reform were widely read by leaders of both Prussia and Poland in their attempts to stabilize currency.

==== Copernican system presented to the Pope ====
In 1533, Johann Widmanstetter, secretary to Pope Clement VII, explained Copernicus&#x27;s heliocentric system to the Pope and two cardinals. The Pope was so pleased that he gave Widmanstetter a valuable gift. In 1535 Bernard Wapowski wrote a letter to a gentleman in Vienna, urging him to publish an enclosed almanac, which he claimed had been written by Copernicus. This is the only mention of a Copernicus almanac in the historical records. The &quot;almanac&quot; was likely Copernicus&#x27;s tables of planetary positions. Wapowski&#x27;s letter mentions Copernicus&#x27;s theory about the motions of the Earth. Nothing came of Wapowski&#x27;s request, because he died a couple of weeks later.

Following the death of Prince-Bishop of Warmia Mauritius Ferber (1 July 1537), Copernicus participated in the election of his successor, Johannes Dantiscus (20 September 1537). Copernicus was one of four candidates for the post, written in at the initiative of Tiedemann Giese; but his candidacy was actually &quot;pro forma&quot;, since Dantiscus had earlier been named coadjutor bishop to Ferber and since Dantiscus had the backing of Poland&#x27;s King Sigismund I. At first Copernicus maintained friendly relations with the new Prince-Bishop, assisting him medically in spring 1538 and accompanying him that summer on an inspection tour of Chapter holdings. But that autumn, their friendship was strained by suspicions over Copernicus&#x27;s housekeeper, Anna Schilling, whom Dantiscus banished from Frombork in spring 1539.

==== Medical work ====
In his younger days, Copernicus the physician had treated his uncle, brother and other chapter members. In later years he was called upon to attend the elderly bishops who in turn occupied the see of Warmia—Mauritius Ferber and Johannes Dantiscus—and, in 1539, his old friend Tiedemann Giese, Bishop of Chełmno (Kulm). In treating such important patients, he sometimes sought consultations from other physicians, including the physician to Duke Albert and, by letter, the Polish Royal Physician.

In the spring of 1541, Duke Albert—former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order who had converted the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights into a Lutheran and hereditary realm, the Duchy of Prussia, upon doing homage to his uncle, the King of Poland, Sigismund I—summoned Copernicus to Königsberg to attend the Duke&#x27;s counselor, George von Kunheim, who had fallen seriously ill, and for whom the Prussian doctors seemed unable to do anything. Copernicus went willingly; he had met von Kunheim during negotiations over reform of the coinage. And Copernicus had come to feel that Albert himself was not such a bad person; the two had many intellectual interests in common. The Chapter readily gave Copernicus permission to go, as it wished to remain on good terms with the Duke, despite his Lutheran faith. In about a month the patient recovered, and Copernicus returned to Frombork. For a time, he continued to receive reports on von Kunheim&#x27;s condition, and to send him medical advice by letter.

==== Protestant attacks on the Copernican system ====
Some of Copernicus&#x27;s close friends turned Protestant, but Copernicus never showed a tendency in that direction. The first attacks on him came from Protestants. Wilhelm Gnapheus, a Dutch refugee settled in Elbląg, wrote a comedy in Latin, &quot;Morosophus&quot; (The Foolish Sage), and staged it at the Latin school that he had established there. In the play, Copernicus was caricatured as the eponymous Morosophus, a haughty, cold, aloof man who dabbled in astrology, considered himself inspired by God, and was rumored to have written a large work that was moldering in a chest.

Elsewhere Protestants were the first to react to news of Copernicus&#x27;s theory. Melanchthon wrote:

Nevertheless, in 1551, eight years after Copernicus&#x27;s death, astronomer Erasmus Reinhold published, under the sponsorship of Copernicus&#x27;s former military adversary, the Protestant Duke Albert, the &quot;Prussian Tables&quot;, a set of astronomical tables based on Copernicus&#x27;s work. Astronomers and astrologers quickly adopted it in place of its predecessors.

=== Heliocentrism ===

Some time before 1514 Copernicus made available to friends his &quot;Commentariolus&quot; (&quot;Little Commentary&quot;), a manuscript describing his ideas about the heliocentric hypothesis. It contained seven basic assumptions (detailed below). Thereafter he continued gathering data for a more detailed work.

At about 1532, Copernicus had basically completed his work on the manuscript of &quot;Dē revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;; but despite urging by his closest friends, he resisted openly publishing his views, not wishing—as he confessed—to risk the scorn &quot;to which he would expose himself on account of the novelty and incomprehensibility of his theses.&quot;

==== Reception of the Copernican system in Rome ====
In 1533, Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter delivered a series of lectures in Rome outlining Copernicus&#x27;s theory. Pope Clement VII and several Catholic cardinals heard the lectures and were interested in the theory. On 1 November 1536, Cardinal Nikolaus von Schönberg, Archbishop of Capua, wrote to Copernicus from Rome:

By then, Copernicus&#x27;s work was nearing its definitive form, and rumors about his theory had reached educated people all over Europe. Despite urgings from many quarters, Copernicus delayed publication of his book, perhaps from fear of criticism—a fear delicately expressed in the subsequent dedication of his masterpiece to Pope Paul III. Scholars disagree on whether Copernicus&#x27;s concern was limited to possible astronomical and philosophical objections, or whether he was also concerned about religious objections.

=== &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; ===

Copernicus was still working on &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (even if not certain that he wanted to publish it) when in 1539 Georg Joachim Rheticus, a Wittenberg mathematician, arrived in Frombork. Philipp Melanchthon, a close theological ally of Martin Luther, had arranged for Rheticus to visit several astronomers and study with them. Rheticus became Copernicus&#x27;s pupil, staying with him for two years and writing a book, &quot;Narratio prima&quot; (First Account), outlining the essence of Copernicus&#x27;s theory. In 1542 Rheticus published a treatise on trigonometry by Copernicus (later included as chapters 13 and 14 of Book I of &quot;De revolutionibus&quot;).
Under strong pressure from Rheticus, and having seen the favorable first general reception of his work, Copernicus finally agreed to give &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; to his close friend, Tiedemann Giese, bishop of Chełmno (Kulm), to be delivered to Rheticus for printing by the German printer Johannes Petreius at Nuremberg (&quot;Nürnberg&quot;), Germany. While Rheticus initially supervised the printing, he had to leave Nuremberg before it was completed, and he handed over the task of supervising the rest of the printing to a Lutheran theologian, Andreas Osiander.

Osiander added an unauthorised and unsigned preface, defending Copernicus&#x27;s work against those who might be offended by its novel hypotheses. He argued that &quot;different hypotheses are sometimes offered for one and the same motion [and therefore] the astronomer will take as his first choice that hypothesis which is the easiest to grasp.&quot; According to Osiander, &quot;these hypotheses need not be true nor even probable. [I]f they provide a calculus consistent with the observations, that alone is enough.&quot;

=== Death ===

Toward the close of 1542, Copernicus was seized with apoplexy and paralysis, and he died at age 70 on 24 May 1543. Legend has it that he was presented with the final printed pages of his &quot;Dē revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; on the very day that he died, allowing him to take farewell of his life&#x27;s work. He is reputed to have awoken from a stroke-induced coma, looked at his book, and then died peacefully.

Copernicus was reportedly buried in Frombork Cathedral, where a 1580 epitaph stood until being defaced; it was replaced in 1735. For over two centuries, archaeologists searched the cathedral in vain for Copernicus&#x27;s remains. Efforts to locate them in 1802, 1909, 1939 had come to nought. In 2004 a team led by Jerzy Gąssowski, head of an archaeology and anthropology institute in Pułtusk, began a new search, guided by the research of historian Jerzy Sikorski. In August 2005, after scanning beneath the cathedral floor, they discovered what they believed to be Copernicus&#x27;s remains.

The discovery was announced only after further research, on 3 November 2008. Gąssowski said he was &quot;almost 100 percent sure it is Copernicus&quot;. Forensic expert Capt. Dariusz Zajdel of the Polish Police Central Forensic Laboratory used the skull to reconstruct a face that closely resembled the features—including a broken nose and a scar above the left eye—on a Copernicus self-portrait. The expert also determined that the skull belonged to a man who had died around age 70—Copernicus&#x27;s age at the time of his death.

The grave was in poor condition, and not all the remains of the skeleton were found; missing, among other things, was the lower jaw. The DNA from the bones found in the grave matched hair samples taken from a book owned by Copernicus which was kept at the library of the University of Uppsala in Sweden.

On 22 May 2010, Copernicus was given a second funeral in a Mass led by Józef Kowalczyk, the former papal nuncio to Poland and newly named Primate of Poland. Copernicus&#x27;s remains were reburied in the same spot in Frombork Cathedral where part of his skull and other bones had been found. A black granite tombstone identifies him as the founder of the heliocentric theory and also a church canon. The tombstone bears a representation of Copernicus&#x27;s model of the Solar System—a golden Sun encircled by six of the planets.

== Copernican system ==
=== Predecessors ===
Philolaus (c. 470 – c. 385 BCE) described an astronomical system in which a Central Fire (different from the Sun) occupied the centre of the universe, and a counter-Earth, the Earth, Moon, the Sun itself, planets, and stars all revolved around it, in that order outward from the centre. Heraclides Ponticus (387–312 BCE) proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis.
Aristarchus of Samos (c. 310 BCE – c. 230 BCE) was the first to advance a theory that the Earth orbited the Sun. Further mathematical details of Aristarchus&#x27;s heliocentric system were worked out around 150 BCE by the Hellenistic astronomer Seleucus of Seleucia. Though Aristarchus&#x27;s original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes&#x27; book &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot; (&quot;Archimedis Syracusani Arenarius &amp; Dimensio Circuli&quot;) describes a work by Aristarchus in which he advanced the heliocentric model. Thomas Heath gives the following English translation of Archimedes&#x27;s text:


In an early unpublished manuscript of &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; (which still survives), Copernicus mentioned the (non-heliocentric) &#x27;moving Earth&#x27; theory of Philolaus and the possibility that Aristarchus also had a &#x27;moving Earth&#x27; theory (though it is unlikely that he was aware that it was a heliocentric theory). He removed both references from his final published manuscript.

Copernicus was probably aware that Pythagoras&#x27;s system involved a moving Earth. The Pythagorean system was mentioned by Aristotle.

Copernicus owned a copy of Giorgio Valla&#x27;s &quot;De expetendis et fugiendis rebus&quot;, which included a translation of Plutarch&#x27;s reference to Aristarchus&#x27;s heliostaticism.

In Copernicus&#x27;s dedication of &quot;On the Revolutions&quot; to Pope Paul III—which Copernicus hoped would dampen criticism of his heliocentric theory by &quot;babblers ... completely ignorant of [astronomy]&quot;—the book&#x27;s author wrote that, in rereading all of philosophy, in the pages of Cicero and Plutarch he had found references to those few thinkers who dared to move the Earth &quot;against the traditional opinion of astronomers and almost against common sense.&quot;

The prevailing theory during Copernicus&#x27;s lifetime was the one that Ptolemy published in his &quot;Almagest&quot; ; the Earth was the stationary center of the universe. Stars were embedded in a large outer sphere that rotated rapidly, approximately daily, while each of the planets, the Sun, and the Moon were embedded in their own, smaller spheres. Ptolemy&#x27;s system employed devices, including epicycles, deferents and equants, to account for observations that the paths of these bodies differed from simple, circular orbits centered on the Earth.

Beginning in the 10th century, a tradition criticizing Ptolemy developed within Islamic astronomy, which climaxed with Ibn al-Haytham of Basra&#x27;s &quot;Al-Shukūk &#x27;alā Baṭalamiyūs&quot; (&quot;Doubts Concerning Ptolemy&quot;). Several Islamic astronomers questioned the Earth&#x27;s apparent immobility, and centrality within the universe. Some accepted that the earth rotates around its axis, such as Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Sijzi (d. ). According to al-Biruni, al-Sijzi invented an astrolabe based on a belief held by some of his contemporaries &quot;that the motion we see is due to the Earth&#x27;s movement and not to that of the sky.&quot; That others besides al-Sijzi held this view is further confirmed by a reference from an Arabic work in the 13th century which states: According to the geometers [or engineers] (&quot;muhandisīn&quot;), the earth is in constant circular motion, and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the earth and not the stars. In the 12th century, Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji proposed a complete alternative to the Ptolemaic system (although not heliocentric). He declared the Ptolemaic system as an imaginary model, successful at predicting planetary positions, but not real or physical. Al-Bitruji&#x27;s alternative system spread through most of Europe during the 13th century, with debates and refutations of his ideas continued up to the 16th century.

Mathematical techniques developed in the 13th to 14th centuries by Mo&#x27;ayyeduddin al-Urdi, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and Ibn al-Shatir for geocentric models of planetary motions closely resemble some of those used later by Copernicus in his heliocentric models. Copernicus used what is now known as the Urdi lemma and the Tusi couple in the same planetary models as found in Arabic sources. Furthermore, the exact replacement of the equant by two epicycles used by Copernicus in the &quot;Commentariolus&quot; was found in an earlier work by Ibn al-Shatir (d. c. 1375) of Damascus. Ibn al-Shatir&#x27;s lunar and Mercury models are also identical to those of Copernicus. This has led some scholars to argue that Copernicus must have had access to some yet to be identified work on the ideas of those earlier astronomers. However, no likely candidate for this conjectured work has yet come to light, and other scholars have argued that Copernicus could well have developed these ideas independently of the late Islamic tradition. Nevertheless, Copernicus cited some of the Islamic astronomers whose theories and observations he used in &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot;, namely al-Battani, Thabit ibn Qurra, al-Zarqali, Averroes, and al-Bitruji. It has been suggested that the idea of the Tusi couple may have arrived in Europe leaving few manuscript traces, since it could have occurred without the translation of any Arabic text into Latin. One possible route of transmission may have been through Byzantine science; Gregory Chioniades translated some of al-Tusi&#x27;s works from Arabic into Byzantine Greek. Several Byzantine Greek manuscripts containing the Tusi-couple are still extant in Italy.

=== Copernicus ===

Copernicus&#x27;s major work on his heliocentric theory was &quot;Dē revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (&quot;On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres&quot;), published in the year of his death, 1543. He had formulated his theory by 1510. &quot;He wrote out a short overview of his new heavenly arrangement [known as the &quot;Commentariolus&quot;, or &quot;Brief Sketch&quot;], also probably in 1510 [but no later than May 1514], and sent it off to at least one correspondent beyond Varmia [the Latin for &quot;Warmia&quot;]. That person in turn copied the document for further circulation, and presumably the new recipients did, too ...&quot;.

Copernicus&#x27;s &quot;Commentariolus&quot; summarized his heliocentric theory. It listed the &quot;assumptions&quot; upon which the theory was based, as follows:
# There is no one center of all the celestial circles or spheres.
# The center of the earth is not the center of the universe, but only the center towards which heavy bodies move and the center of the lunar sphere.
# All the spheres surround the sun as if it were in the middle of them all, and therefore the center of the universe is near the sun.
# The ratio of the earth&#x27;s distance from the sun to the height of the firmament (outermost celestial sphere containing the stars) is so much smaller than the ratio of the earth&#x27;s radius to its distance from the sun that the distance from the earth to the sun is imperceptible in comparison with the height of the firmament.
# Whatever motion appears in the firmament arises not from any motion of the firmament, but from the earth&#x27;s motion. The earth together with its circumjacent elements performs a complete rotation on its fixed poles in a daily motion, while the firmament and highest heaven abide unchanged.
# What appear to us as motions of the sun arise not from its motion but from the motion of the earth and our sphere, with which we revolve about the sun like any other planet. The earth has, then, more than one motion.
# The apparent retrograde and direct motion of the planets arises not from their motion but from the earth&#x27;s. The motion of the earth alone, therefore, suffices to explain so many apparent inequalities in the heavens.

&quot;De revolutionibus&quot; itself was divided into six sections or parts, called &quot;books&quot;:
# General vision of the heliocentric theory, and a summarized exposition of his idea of the World
# Mainly theoretical, presents the principles of spherical astronomy and a list of stars (as a basis for the arguments developed in the subsequent books)
# Mainly dedicated to the apparent motions of the Sun and to related phenomena
# Description of the Moon and its orbital motions
# Exposition of the motions in longitude of the non-terrestrial planets
# Exposition of the motions in latitude of the non-terrestrial planets

=== Successors ===

Georg Joachim Rheticus could have been Copernicus&#x27;s successor, but did not rise to the occasion. Erasmus Reinhold could have been his successor, but died prematurely. The first of the great successors was Tycho Brahe (though he did not think the Earth orbited the Sun), followed by Johannes Kepler, who had collaborated with Tycho in Prague and benefited from Tycho&#x27;s decades&#x27; worth of detailed observational data.

Despite the near universal acceptance later of the heliocentric idea (though not the epicycles or the circular orbits), Copernicus&#x27;s theory was originally slow to catch on. Scholars hold that sixty years after the publication of &quot;The Revolutions&quot; there were only around 15 astronomers espousing Copernicanism in all of Europe: &quot;Thomas Digges and Thomas Harriot in England; Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei in Italy; Diego Zuniga in Spain; Simon Stevin in the Low Countries; and in Germany, the largest group—Georg Joachim Rheticus, Michael Maestlin, Christoph Rothmann (who may have later recanted), and Johannes Kepler.&quot; Additional possibilities are Englishman William Gilbert, along with Achilles Gasser, Georg Vogelin, Valentin Otto, and Tiedemann Giese. The Barnabite priest Redento Baranzano supported Copernicus&#x27;s view in his &quot;Uranoscopia&quot; (1617) but was forced to retract it.

Arthur Koestler, in his popular book &quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot;, asserted that Copernicus&#x27;s book had not been widely read on its first publication. This claim was trenchantly criticised by Edward Rosen, and has been decisively disproved by Owen Gingerich, who examined nearly every surviving copy of the first two editions and found copious marginal notes by their owners throughout many of them. Gingerich published his conclusions in 2004 in &quot;The Book Nobody Read&quot;.

The intellectual climate of the time &quot;remained dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and the corresponding Ptolemaic astronomy. At that time there was no reason to accept the Copernican theory, except for its mathematical simplicity [by avoiding using the equant in determining planetary positions].&quot; Tycho Brahe&#x27;s system (&quot;that the earth is stationary, the sun revolves about the earth, and the other planets revolve about the sun&quot;) also directly competed with Copernicus&#x27;s. It was only a half-century later with the work of Kepler and Galileo that any substantial evidence defending Copernicanism appeared, starting &quot;from the time when Galileo formulated the principle of inertia ... [which] helped to explain why everything would not fall off the earth if it were in motion.&quot; &quot;[Not until] after Isaac Newton formulated the universal law of gravitation and the laws of mechanics [in his 1687 &quot;Principia&quot;], which unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics, was the heliocentric view generally accepted.&quot;
== Controversy ==
The immediate result of the 1543 publication of Copernicus&#x27;s book was only mild controversy. At the Council of Trent (1545–1563) neither Copernicus&#x27;s theory nor calendar reform (which would later use tables deduced from Copernicus&#x27;s calculations) were discussed. It has been much debated why it was not until six decades after the publication of &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; that the Catholic Church took any official action against it, even the efforts of Tolosani going unheeded. Catholic side opposition only commenced seventy-three years later, when it was occasioned by Galileo.

=== Tolosani ===
The first notable to move against Copernicanism was the Magister of the Holy Palace (i.e., the Catholic Church&#x27;s chief censor), Dominican Bartolomeo Spina, who &quot;expressed a desire to stamp out the Copernican doctrine&quot;. But with Spina&#x27;s death in 1546, his cause fell to his friend, the well-known theologian-astronomer, the Dominican Giovanni Maria Tolosani of the Convent of St. Mark in Florence. Tolosani had written a treatise on reforming the calendar (in which astronomy would play a large role) and had attended the Fifth Lateran Council (1512–1517) to discuss the matter. He had obtained a copy of &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; in 1544. His denunciation of Copernicanism was written a year later, in 1545, in an appendix to his unpublished work, &quot;On the Truth of Sacred Scripture&quot;.

Emulating the rationalistic style of Thomas Aquinas, Tolosani sought to refute Copernicanism by philosophical argument. Copernicanism was absurd, according to Tolosani, because it was scientifically unproven and unfounded. First, Copernicus had assumed the motion of the Earth but offered no physical theory whereby one would deduce this motion. (No one realized that the investigation into Copernicanism would result in a rethinking of the entire field of physics.) Second, Tolosani charged that Copernicus&#x27;s thought process was backwards. He held that Copernicus had come up with his idea and then sought phenomena that would support it, rather than observing phenomena and deducing from them the idea of what caused them. In this, Tolosani was linking Copernicus&#x27;s mathematical equations with the practices of the Pythagoreans (whom Aristotle had made arguments against, which were later picked up by Thomas Aquinas). It was argued that mathematical numbers were a mere product of the intellect without any physical reality, and as such could not provide physical causes in the investigation of nature.

Some astronomical hypotheses at the time (such as epicycles and eccentrics) were seen as mere mathematical devices to adjust calculations of where the heavenly bodies would appear, rather than an explanation of the cause of those motions. (As Copernicus still maintained the idea of perfectly spherical orbits, he relied on epicycles.) This &quot;saving the phenomena&quot; was seen as proof that astronomy and mathematics could not be taken as serious means to determine physical causes. Tolosani invoked this view in his final critique of Copernicus, saying that his biggest error was that he had started with &quot;inferior&quot; fields of science to make pronouncements about &quot;superior&quot; fields. Copernicus had used mathematics and astronomy to postulate about physics and cosmology, rather than beginning with the accepted principles of physics and cosmology to determine things about astronomy and mathematics. Thus Copernicus seemed to be undermining the whole system of the philosophy of science at the time. Tolosani held that Copernicus had fallen into philosophical error because he had not been versed in physics and logic; anyone without such knowledge would make a poor astronomer and be unable to distinguish truth from falsehood. Because Copernicanism had not met the criteria for scientific truth set out by Thomas Aquinas, Tolosani held that it could only be viewed as a wild unproven theory.

Tolosani recognized that the &quot;Ad Lectorem&quot; preface to Copernicus&#x27;s book was not actually by him. Its thesis that astronomy as a whole would never be able to make truth claims was rejected by Tolosani (though he still held that Copernicus&#x27;s attempt to describe physical reality had been faulty); he found it ridiculous that &quot;Ad Lectorem&quot; had been included in the book (unaware that Copernicus had not authorized its inclusion). Tolosani wrote: &quot;By means of these words [of the &quot;Ad Lectorem&quot;], the foolishness of this book&#x27;s author is rebuked. For by a foolish effort he [Copernicus] tried to revive the weak Pythagorean opinion [that the element of fire was at the center of the Universe], long ago deservedly destroyed, since it is expressly contrary to human reason and also opposes holy writ. From this situation, there could easily arise disagreements between Catholic expositors of holy scripture and those who might wish to adhere obstinately to this false opinion.&quot; Tolosani declared: &quot;Nicolaus Copernicus neither read nor understood the arguments of Aristotle the philosopher and Ptolemy the astronomer.&quot; Tolosani wrote that Copernicus &quot;is expert indeed in the sciences of mathematics and astronomy, but he is very deficient in the sciences of physics and logic. Moreover, it appears that he is unskilled with regard to [the interpretation of] holy scripture, since he contradicts several of its principles, not without danger of infidelity to himself and the readers of his book. ... his arguments have no force and can very easily be taken apart. For it is stupid to contradict an opinion accepted by everyone over a very long time for the strongest reasons, unless the impugner uses more powerful and insoluble demonstrations and completely dissolves the opposed reasons. But he does not do this in the least.&quot;

Tolosani declared that he had written against Copernicus &quot;for the purpose of preserving the truth to the common advantage of the Holy Church.&quot; Despite this, his work remained unpublished and there is no evidence that it received serious consideration. Robert Westman describes it as becoming a &quot;dormant&quot; viewpoint with &quot;no audience in the Catholic world&quot; of the late sixteenth century, but also notes that there is some evidence that it did become known to Tommaso Caccini, who would criticize Galileo in a sermon in December 1613.

=== Theology ===
Tolosani may have criticized the Copernican theory as scientifically unproven and unfounded, but the theory also conflicted with the theology of the time, as can be seen in a sample of the works of John Calvin. In his &quot;Commentary on Genesis&quot; he said that &quot;We indeed are not ignorant that the circuit of the heavens is finite, and that the earth, like a little globe, is placed in the centre.&quot; In his commentary on Psalms 93:1 he states that &quot;The heavens revolve daily, and, immense as is their fabric and inconceivable the rapidity of their revolutions, we experience no concussion ... How could the earth hang suspended in the air were it not upheld by God&#x27;s hand? By what means could it maintain itself unmoved, while the heavens above are in constant rapid motion, did not its Divine Maker fix and establish it.&quot; One sharp point of conflict between Copernicus&#x27;s theory and the Bible concerned the story of the Battle of Gibeon in the Book of Joshua where the Hebrew forces were winning but whose opponents were likely to escape once night fell. This is averted by Joshua&#x27;s prayers causing the Sun and the Moon to stand still. Martin Luther once made a remark about Copernicus, although without mentioning his name. According to Anthony Lauterbach, while eating with Martin Luther the topic of Copernicus arose during dinner on 4 June 1539 (in the same year as professor George Joachim Rheticus of the local University had been granted leave to visit him). Luther is said to have remarked &quot;So it goes now. Whoever wants to be clever must agree with nothing others esteem. He must do something of his own. This is what &quot;that fellow&quot; does who wishes to turn the whole of astronomy upside down. Even in these things that are thrown into disorder I believe the Holy Scriptures, for Joshua commanded the sun to stand still and not the earth.&quot; These remarks were made four years before the publication of &quot;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres&quot; and a year before Rheticus&#x27;s &quot;Narratio Prima&quot;. In John Aurifaber&#x27;s account of the conversation Luther calls Copernicus &quot;that fool&quot; rather than &quot;that fellow&quot;, this version is viewed by historians as less reliably sourced.

Luther&#x27;s collaborator Philipp Melanchthon also took issue with Copernicanism. After receiving the first pages of &quot;Narratio Prima&quot; from Rheticus himself, Melanchthon wrote to Mithobius (physician and mathematician Burkard Mithob of Feldkirch) on 16 October 1541 condemning the theory and calling for it to be repressed by governmental force, writing &quot;certain people believe it is a marvelous achievement to extol so crazy a thing, like that Polish astronomer who makes the earth move and the sun stand still. Really, wise governments ought to repress impudence of mind.&quot; It had appeared to Rheticus that Melanchton would understand the theory and would be open to it. This was because Melanchton had taught Ptolemaic astronomy and had even recommended his friend Rheticus to an appointment to the Deanship of the Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences at the University of Wittenberg after he had returned from studying with Copernicus.

Rheticus&#x27;s hopes were dashed when six years after the publication of &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; Melanchthon published his &quot;Initia Doctrinae Physicae&quot; presenting three grounds to reject Copernicanism. These were &quot;the evidence of the senses, the thousand-year consensus of men of science, and the authority of the Bible&quot;. Blasting the new theory Melanchthon wrote, &quot;Out of love for novelty or in order to make a show of their cleverness, some people have argued that the earth moves. They maintain that neither the eighth sphere nor the sun moves, whereas they attribute motion to the other celestial spheres, and also place the earth among the heavenly bodies. Nor were these jokes invented recently. There is still extant Archimedes&#x27;s book on &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot;; in which he reports that Aristarchus of Samos propounded the paradox that the sun stands still and the earth revolves around the sun. Even though subtle experts institute many investigations for the sake of exercising their ingenuity, nevertheless public proclamation of absurd opinions is indecent and sets a harmful example.&quot; Melanchthon went on to cite Bible passages and then declare &quot;Encouraged by this divine evidence, let us cherish the truth and let us not permit ourselves to be alienated from it by the tricks of those who deem it an intellectual honor to introduce confusion into the arts.&quot; In the first edition of &quot;Initia Doctrinae Physicae&quot;, Melanchthon even questioned Copernicus&#x27;s character claiming his motivation was &quot;either from love of novelty or from desire to appear clever&quot;, these more personal attacks were largely removed by the second edition in 1550.
Another Protestant theologian who disparaged heliocentrism on scriptural grounds was John Owen. In a passing remark in an essay on the origin of the sabbath, he characterised &quot;the late hypothesis, fixing the sun as in the centre of the world&quot; as being &quot;built on fallible phenomena, and advanced by many arbitrary presumptions against evident testimonies of Scripture.&quot;

In Roman Catholic circles, Copernicus&#x27;s book was incorporated into scholarly curricula throughout the 16th century. For example, at the University of Salamanca in 1561 it became one of four text books that students of astronomy could choose from, and in 1594 it was made mandatory. German Jesuit Nicolaus Serarius was one of the first Catholics to write against Copernicus&#x27;s theory as heretical, citing the Joshua passage, in a work published in 1609–1610, and again in a book in 1612. In his 12 April 1615 letter to a Catholic defender of Copernicus, Paolo Antonio Foscarini, Catholic Cardinal Robert Bellarmine condemned Copernican theory, writing, &quot;not only the Holy Fathers, but also the modern commentaries on Genesis, the Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and Joshua, you will find all agreeing in the literal interpretation that the sun is in heaven and turns around the earth with great speed, and that the earth is very far from heaven and sits motionless at the center of the world ... Nor can one answer that this is not a matter of faith, since if it is not a matter of faith &#x27;as regards the topic,&#x27; it is a matter of faith &#x27;as regards the speaker&#x27;: and so it would be heretical to say that Abraham did not have two children and Jacob twelve, as well as to say that Christ was not born of a virgin, because both are said by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of prophets and apostles.&quot; One year later, the Roman Inquisition prohibited Copernicus&#x27;s work. Nevertheless, the Spanish Inquisition never banned the &quot;De revolutionibus&quot;, which continued to be taught at Salamanca.

=== Ingoli ===
Perhaps the most influential opponent of the Copernican theory was Francesco Ingoli, a Catholic priest. Ingoli wrote a January 1616 essay to Galileo presenting more than twenty arguments against the Copernican theory. Though &quot;it is not certain, it is probable that he [Ingoli] was commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy&quot;, (after the Congregation of the Index&#x27;s decree against Copernicanism on 5 March 1616, Ingoli was officially appointed its consultant). Galileo himself was of the opinion that the essay played an important role in the rejection of the theory by church authorities, writing in a later letter to Ingoli that he was concerned that people thought the theory was rejected because Ingoli was right. Ingoli presented five physical arguments against the theory, thirteen mathematical arguments (plus a separate discussion of the sizes of stars), and four theological arguments. The physical and mathematical arguments were of uneven quality, but many of them came directly from the writings of Tycho Brahe, and Ingoli repeatedly cited Brahe, the leading astronomer of the era. These included arguments about the effect of a moving Earth on the trajectory of projectiles, and about parallax and Brahe&#x27;s argument that the Copernican theory required that stars be absurdly large.

Two of Ingoli&#x27;s theological issues with the Copernican theory were &quot;common Catholic beliefs not directly traceable to Scripture: the doctrine that hell is located at the center of Earth and is most distant from heaven; and the explicit assertion that Earth is motionless in a hymn sung on Tuesdays as part of the Liturgy of the Hours of the Divine Office prayers regularly recited by priests.&quot; Ingoli cited Robert Bellarmine in regards to both of these arguments, and may have been trying to convey to Galileo a sense of Bellarmine&#x27;s opinion. Ingoli also cited Genesis 1:14 where God places &quot;lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night.&quot; Ingoli did not think the central location of the Sun in the Copernican theory was compatible with it being described as one of the lights placed in the firmament. Like previous commentators Ingoli also pointed to the passages about the Battle of Gibeon. He dismissed arguments that they should be taken metaphorically, saying &quot;Replies which assert that Scripture speaks according to our mode of understanding are not satisfactory: both because in explaining the Sacred Writings the rule is always to preserve the literal sense, when it is possible, as it is in this case; and also because all the [Church] Fathers unanimously take this passage to mean that the Sun which was truly moving stopped at Joshua&#x27;s request. An interpretation that is contrary to the unanimous consent of the Fathers is condemned by the Council of Trent, Session IV, in the decree on the edition and use of the Sacred Books. Furthermore, although the Council speaks about matters of faith and morals, nevertheless it cannot be denied that the Holy Fathers would be displeased with an interpretation of Sacred Scriptures which is contrary to their common agreement.&quot; However, Ingoli closed the essay by suggesting Galileo respond primarily to the better of his physical and mathematical arguments rather than to his theological arguments, writing &quot;Let it be your choice to respond to this either entirely of in part—clearly at least to the mathematical and physical arguments, and not to all even of these, but to the more weighty ones.&quot; When Galileo wrote a letter in reply to Ingoli years later, he in fact only addressed the mathematical and physical arguments.

In March 1616, in connection with the Galileo affair, the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s Congregation of the Index issued a decree suspending &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; until it could be &quot;corrected&quot;, on the grounds of ensuring that Copernicanism, which it described as a &quot;false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to the Holy Scripture,&quot; would not &quot;creep any further to the prejudice of Catholic truth.&quot; The corrections consisted largely of removing or altering wording that spoke of heliocentrism as a fact, rather than a hypothesis. The corrections were made based largely on work by Ingoli.

=== Galileo ===
On the orders of Pope Paul V, Cardinal Robert Bellarmine gave Galileo prior notice that the decree was about to be issued, and warned him that he could not &quot;hold or defend&quot; the Copernican doctrine. The corrections to &quot;De revolutionibus&quot;, which omitted or altered nine sentences, were issued four years later, in 1620.

In 1633, Galileo Galilei was convicted of grave suspicion of heresy for &quot;following the position of Copernicus, which is contrary to the true sense and authority of Holy Scripture&quot;, and was placed under house arrest for the rest of his life.

At the instance of Roger Boscovich, the Catholic Church&#x27;s 1758 &quot;Index of Prohibited Books&quot; omitted the general prohibition of works defending heliocentrism, but retained the specific prohibitions of the original uncensored versions of &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; and Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot;. Those prohibitions were finally dropped from the 1835 &quot;Index&quot;.

== Languages, name, nationality ==

=== Languages ===
Copernicus is postulated to have spoken Latin, German, and Polish with equal fluency; he also spoke Greek and Italian. The vast majority of Copernicus&#x27;s extant writings are in Latin, the language of European academia in his lifetime.

Arguments for German being Copernicus&#x27;s native tongue are that he was born into a predominantly German-speaking urban patrician class using German, next to Latin, as language of trade and commerce in written documents, and that, while studying canon law at the University of Bologna in 1496, he signed into the German &quot;natio&quot; (&quot;Natio Germanorum&quot;)—a student organization which, according to its 1497 by-laws, was open to students of all kingdoms and states whose mother-tongue was German. However, according to French philosopher Alexandre Koyré, Copernicus&#x27;s registration with the &quot;Natio Germanorum&quot; does not in itself imply that Copernicus considered himself German, since students from Prussia and Silesia were routinely so categorized, which carried certain privileges that made it a natural choice for German-speaking students, regardless of their ethnicity or self-identification.

=== Name ===
The surname &quot;Kopernik&quot;, &quot;Copernik&quot;, &quot;Koppernigk&quot;, in various spellings, is recorded in Kraków from c. 1350, apparently given to people from the village of Koperniki (prior to 1845 rendered &quot;Kopernik&quot;, &quot;Copernik&quot;, &quot;Copirnik&quot;, and &quot;Koppirnik&quot;) in the Duchy of Nysa, 10 km south of Nysa, and now 10 km north of the Polish-Czech border. Nicolaus Copernicus&#x27;s great-grandfather is recorded as having received citizenship in Kraków in 1386. The toponym &quot;Kopernik&quot; (modern &quot;Koperniki&quot;) has been variously tied to the Polish word for &quot;dill&quot; (&quot;koper&quot;) and the German word for &quot;copper&quot; (&quot;Kupfer&quot;). The suffix &quot;-nik&quot; (or plural, &quot;-niki&quot;) denotes a Slavic and Polish agent noun.

As was common in the period, the spellings of both the toponym and the surname vary greatly. Copernicus &quot;was rather indifferent about orthography&quot;. During his childhood, about 1480, the name of his father (and thus of the future astronomer) was recorded in Thorn as &quot;Niclas Koppernigk&quot;.
At Kraków he signed himself, in Latin, &quot;Nicolaus Nicolai de Torunia&quot; (Nicolaus, son of Nicolaus, of Toruń). At Bologna, in 1496, he registered in the &quot;Matricula Nobilissimi Germanorum Collegii, resp. Annales Clarissimae Nacionis Germanorum&quot;, of the &quot;Natio Germanica Bononiae&quot;, as &quot;Dominus Nicolaus Kopperlingk de Thorn – IX grosseti&quot;. At Padua he signed himself &quot;Nicolaus Copernik&quot;, later &quot;Coppernicus&quot;. The astronomer thus Latinized his name to &quot;Coppernicus&quot;, generally with two &quot;p&quot;s (in 23 of 31 documents studied), but later in life he used a single &quot;p&quot;. On the title page of &quot;De revolutionibus&quot;, Rheticus published the name (in the genitive, or possessive, case) as &quot;Nicolai Copernici&quot;.

=== Nationality ===
There has been discussion of Copernicus&#x27;s nationality and of whether it is meaningful to ascribe to him a nationality in the modern sense.

Nicolaus Copernicus was born and raised in Royal Prussia, a semiautonomous and multilingual region of the Kingdom of Poland. He was the child of German-speaking parents and grew up with German as his mother tongue. His first &quot;alma mater&quot; was the University of Kraków in Poland. When he later studied in Italy, at the University of Bologna, he joined the &quot;German Nation&quot;, a student organization for German-speakers of all allegiances (Germany would not become a nation-state until 1871). His family stood against the Teutonic Order and actively supported the city of Toruń during the Thirteen Years&#x27; War. Copernicus&#x27;s father lent money to Poland&#x27;s King Casimir IV Jagiellon to finance the war against the Teutonic Knights, but the inhabitants of Royal Prussia also resisted the Polish crown&#x27;s efforts for greater control over the region.

&quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot;, &quot;The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;The Oxford World Encyclopedia&quot;, and &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot; refer to Copernicus as a &quot;Polish astronomer&quot;. Sheila Rabin, writing in the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, describes Copernicus as a &quot;child of a German family [who] was a subject of the Polish crown&quot;, while Manfred Weissenbacher writes that Copernicus&#x27;s father was a Germanized Pole. noted that most of the 19th and 20th century encyclopedias, particularly the English-language sources, described Copernicus as a &quot;German scientist&quot;. Kasparek and Kasparek stated that it is incorrect to ascribe him German or Polish nationality, as &quot;a 16th century figure cannot be described with the use of 19th and 20th century concepts&quot;.

No Polish texts by Copernicus survive due to the rarity of Polish language in literature before the writings of the Polish Renaissance poets Mikołaj Rej and Jan Kochanowski (educated Poles had generally written in Latin); but it is known that Copernicus knew Polish on a par with German and Latin.

Historian Michael Burleigh describes the nationality debate as a &quot;totally insignificant battle&quot; between German and Polish scholars during the interwar period. Polish astronomer Konrad Rudnicki calls the discussion a &quot;fierce scholarly quarrel in ... times of nationalism&quot; and describes Copernicus as an inhabitant of a German-speaking territory that belonged to Poland, himself being of mixed Polish-German extraction.

Czesław Miłosz describes the debate as an &quot;absurd&quot; projection of a modern understanding of nationality onto Renaissance people, who identified with their home territories rather than with a nation. Similarly, historian Norman Davies writes that Copernicus, as was common in his era, was &quot;largely indifferent&quot; to nationality, being a local patriot who considered himself &quot;Prussian&quot;. Miłosz and Davies both write that Copernicus had a German-language cultural background, while his working language was Latin in accord with the usage of the time. Additionally, according to Davies, &quot;there is ample evidence that he knew the Polish language&quot;. Davies concludes that, &quot;Taking everything into consideration, there is good reason to regard him both as a German and as a Pole: and yet, in the sense that modern nationalists understand it, he was neither.&quot;

== Commemoration ==

=== Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 3 ===
The third in NASA&#x27;s Orbiting Astronomical Observatory series of missions, launched on 21 August 1972, was named &quot;Copernicus&quot; after its successful launch. The satellite carried an X-ray detector and an ultraviolet telescope, and operated until February 1981.

=== Copernicia ===
Copernicia, a genus of palm trees native to South America and the Greater Antilles, was named after Copernicus in 1837. In some of the species, the leaves are coated with a thin layer of wax, known as carnauba wax.

=== Copernicium ===
On 14 July 2009, the discoverers, from the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany, of chemical element 112 (temporarily named ununbium) proposed to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) that its permanent name be &quot;copernicium&quot; (symbol Cn). &quot;After we had named elements after our city and our state, we wanted to make a statement with a name that was known to everyone,&quot; said Hofmann. &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to select someone who was a German. We were looking world-wide.&quot; On the 537th anniversary of his birthday the name became official.

=== 55 Cancri A ===
In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name for 55 Cancri A was Copernicus.

=== Poland ===
Copernicus is commemorated by the Nicolaus Copernicus Monument in Warsaw, designed by Bertel Thorvaldsen (1822), completed in 1830; and by Jan Matejko&#x27;s 1873 painting, &quot;Astronomer Copernicus, or Conversations with God&quot;.

Named for Copernicus are Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń; Warsaw&#x27;s Copernicus Science Centre, the Centrum Astronomiczne im. Mikołaja Kopernika (a principal Polish research institution in astrophysics) and Copernicus Hospital in Poland&#x27;s fourth largest city, Łódź. 

=== In arts and literature ===
Contemporary literary and artistic works inspired by Copernicus include:

* Symphony No. 2 (Górecki), a choral symphony, by composer Henryk Górecki, commissioned by the Kosciuszko Foundation. The piece was composed in honor of the 500th anniversary of the birthday of Nicolaus Copernicus.
* &quot;Mover of the Earth, Stopper of the Sun&quot;, overture for symphony orchestra, by composer Svitlana Azarova, commissioned by ONDIF.
* &quot;Doctor Copernicus&quot;, 1975 novel by John Banville, sketching the life of Copernicus and the 16th-century world in which he lived.
* &quot;&quot;, a Japanese manga series from 2020, later adapted into anime.

<text>The American Convention on Human Rights (ACHR), also known as the Pact of San José or by its Spanish name used in most of the signatory nations, &quot;Convención Americana sobre Derechos Humanos&quot;, is an international human rights instrument. It was adopted by many countries in the Western Hemisphere in San José, Costa Rica, on 22 November 1969. It came into force after the eleventh instrument of ratification (that of Grenada) was deposited on 18 July 1978.

The bodies responsible for overseeing compliance with the Convention are the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, both of which are organs of the Organization of American States (OAS).

==Content and purpose==
According to its preamble, the purpose of the Convention is &quot;to consolidate in this hemisphere, within the framework of democratic institutions, a system of personal liberty and social justice based on respect for the essential rights of man.&quot;

Chapter I establishes the general obligation of the states parties to uphold the rights set forth in the Convention to all persons under their jurisdiction, and to adapt their domestic laws to bring them into line with the Convention. The 23 articles of Chapter II give a list of individual civil and political rights due to all persons, including the right to life &quot;in general, from the moment of conception&quot;, to humane treatment, to a fair trial, to privacy, to freedom of conscience, freedom of assembly, freedom of movement, etc. Article 13 prohibits &quot;any propaganda for war and any advocacy of national, racial, or religious hatred that constitute incitement to lawless violence or to any other similar action against any person on any grounds including those of race, color, religion, language, or national origin&quot; to be considered as offence punishable by law. This provision is established under influence of Article 20 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights. The single article in Chapter III deals with economic, social, and cultural rights.
The somewhat cursory treatment given to this issue here was expanded some ten years later with the Protocol of San Salvador (see below).

Chapter IV describes those circumstances in which certain rights can be temporarily suspended, such as during states of emergency, and the formalities to be followed for such suspension to be valid. However, it does not authorize any suspension of Article 3 (right to juridical personality), Article 4 (right to life), Article 5 (right to humane treatment), Article 6 (freedom from slavery), Article 9 (freedom from ex post facto laws), Article 12 (freedom of conscience and religion), Article 17 (right to family), Article 18 (right to the name), Article 19 (rights of the child), Article 20 (right to nationality), Article 22 (right of asylum and non-refoulement) or Article 23 (right to participate in government).

Chapter V, with a nod to the balance between rights and duties enshrined in the earlier American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, points out that individuals have responsibilities as well as rights.

Chapters VI, VII, VIII, and IX contain provisions for the creation and operation of the two bodies responsible for overseeing compliance with the Convention: the Inter-American Commission, based in Washington, D.C., United States, and the Inter-American Court, headquartered in San José, Costa Rica.

Chapter X deals with mechanisms for ratifying the Convention, amending it or placing reservations in it, or denouncing it. Various transitory provisions are set forth in Chapter XI.

In the ensuing years, the states parties to the American Convention have supplemented its provisions with two additional protocols.

The first, the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (more commonly known as the &quot;Protocol of San Salvador&quot;), was opened for signature in the city of San Salvador, El Salvador, on 17 November 1988. It represented an attempt to take the inter-American human rights system to a higher level by enshrining its protection of so-called second-generation rights in the economic, social, and cultural spheres. The protocol&#x27;s provisions cover such areas as the right to work, the right to health, the right to food, and the right to education. It came into effect on 16 November 1999 and has been ratified by 16 nations (see below).

The second, the Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty, was adopted at Asunción, Paraguay, on 8 June 1990. While Article 4 of the American Convention had already placed severe restrictions on the states&#x27; ability to impose the death penalty – only applicable for the most serious crimes; no reinstatement once abolished; not to be used for political offenses or common crimes; not to be used against those aged under 18 or over 70, or against pregnant women – signing this protocol formalizes a state&#x27;s solemn commitment to refrain from using capital punishment in any peacetime circumstance. To date it has been ratified by 13 nations (see below).

=== Inter-American Court&#x27;s Interpretation ===
The Inter-American Court makes a broad interpretation of the American Convention. It interprets it according to the pro homine principle, in an evolutive fashion and making use of other treaties and soft law. The result is that, in practice, the Inter-American Court modifies the content of the American Convention.

==Ratifications==

, 25 of the 35 OAS&#x27;s member states have ratified the Convention, while two have denounced it subsequently, and one of the two ratified it repeatedly, leaving 24 active parties:
=== Canada ===
The treaty is open to all OAS member states, although to date it has not been ratified by Canada or several of the English-speaking Caribbean nations; the United States signed it in 1977 but has not proceeded with ratification, with the last hearing held in the U.S. Senate on November 19, 1979.

Canada did at one point seriously consider ratification, but has decided against it, despite being in principle in favour of such a treaty. The ACHR, having been largely drafted by the predominantly Roman Catholic nations of Latin America, contains anti-abortion provisions, specifically, Article 4.1:

This conflicts with the current legality of abortions in Canada. Although Canada could ratify the convention with a reservation with respect to abortion (as did Mexico), that would contradict Canada&#x27;s stated opposition to the making of reservations to human rights treaties. Another solution would be for the other states to remove the anti-abortion provisions, but that is unlikely to occur due to strong opposition to abortion in those countries.

== Denunciation framework ==
Section 78 of the treaty signifies that parliaments have agreed to a five-year prohibition of denunciation/withdrawal; within the first five years following entry-of-force of the treaty should they seek to denunciate from the treaty. 

&quot;Pursuant to article 78 of the American Convention on Human Rights: The States Parties may denounce this Convention at the expiration of the five-year period from the date of its entry into force and by means of notice given one year in advance.&quot; The legal entrustment of the treaty also stipulates under the previous section that any attempts at denunciation must be addressed to the S.G. of the OAS who shall notify other OAS member states, at which time the member state&#x27;s Parliament must then await a one-year mandatory sunset period of legal obligation still under the treaty.

&quot;Notice of the denunciation shall be addressed to the Secretary General of the Organization, who shall inform the other States Parties.&quot; Further, that article prohibits under the section 78 any ability to relinquish claims of human rights violations for any period prior to that one year sunset time-frame. 
&quot;Such a denunciation shall not have the effect of releasing the State Party concerned from the obligations contained in this Convention with respect to any act that may constitute violation of those obligations and that has been taken by that state prior to the effective date of denunciation.&quot;

=== Denunciation movements ===
Trinidad and Tobago denounced the Convention on 26 May 1998 (effective 26 May 1999) over the death penalty issue. Venezuela denounced the Convention on 10 September 2012 accusing the Inter-American Court and Commission to undermine its Government&#x27;s stability by interfering with its domestic affairs. Necessary reforms of the institution were blocked. Therefore, it would henceforth increase its cooperation with the United Nations Human Rights Council.
Denunciations, according to Article 78 of the ACHR, become effective one year after having been declared. They do not release the state party from its obligations resulting from acts that have occurred before the effective date of denunciation. In 2019, Venezuela (Juan Guaidó) re-ratified the convention.

<text>Global alert is used as the global radio-communications network during times of international crises or threats to international security. Global Alerts are also issued by agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), when there is a perceived threat of an international pandemic, (global epidemic), such as the threat of a SARS, (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), pandemic during March 2003, due to its high contagion level which was rapidly spread by travelers sharing international flights. The global alert released by the World Health Organization regarding the SARS outbreak and its rapid contagion saved many lives: The alert about the disease, precautionary measures, and preventive measures to be taken by individuals, including specific hygiene information needed to arrest the spread of SARS was communicated instantly throughout the world.

<text>Mangal is a Middle Eastern barbecue— it is the grilling apparatus on which meat, vegetables etc. are cooked.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;mangal&quot; is derived from the Arabic word &quot;manqal&quot; () meaning &quot;portable&quot; and originally referred to portable heaters, or braziers, used by Bedouin to warm tents during the cold desert evenings. The Arabic word is thought to be a Greek loanword, , meaning, &quot;brazier&quot;. The portability of heating equipment – as well as all other belongings – is vital for the Bedouin&#x27;s nomadic lifestyle. Heating mangal is widely used in light climates where the ambient temperature does not drop too much. It is used as a light indoor or outdoor heater similar to the stove. Today, mangal type heaters are still available either as a camping tool, functional furniture or decorative furniture.

==Description==
A mangal is typically used to grill various cuts of meat, such as steak, hamburgers, kebab, shashlik, chicken wings and chicken breasts. Roasted vegetables, salads and other cold foods accompany the meal.

<doc id="323610" wikidata="Q1034646" url="?curid=323610" title="HLN (TV network)">
<text>HLN is an American basic cable network. Owned by CNN Worldwide, the network primarily carries true-crime programming, recently drifting away from limited live news programming.

The channel was originally launched on January 1, 1982, by Turner Broadcasting as CNN2 (later renamed Headline News or CNN Headline News), a sister network to CNN that broadcast a looping, half-hour cycle of segments covering various news topics. In 2005, HLN began to diverge from this format and air more personality-based programs, including a primetime block featuring pundits such as Glenn Beck and legal commentator Nancy Grace. In the mid-2010s, HLN repositioned itself as a social media-centric network, highlighting headlines popular on social networks, and introducing social media-themed shows. Under CNN president Jeff Zucker, the channel began to backpedal on this programming in 2016, gradually shifting to a focus on crime, &quot;regional&quot; headlines, and entertainment stories (in contrast to CNN&#x27;s current focus on politics) during its daytime programming, with true crime programs airing at all other times.

With the 2022 merger of CNN parent WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery, HLN became a sister to Discovery&#x27;s true-crime channel Investigation Discovery (ID). In December 2022, then-new CNN president Chris Licht announced that HLN would abandon original live news programming entirely as part of a reorganization, with the network now being overseen by ID&#x27;s staff. For contractual reasons, HLN continues to air news content daily through a simulcast of CNN&#x27;s early morning programming. The network&#x27;s schedule outside of that has primarily featured true crime programs as before, in addition to occasional marathons of crime and legal dramas from the Warner Bros. Television library.

, HLN is available to approximately 68,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2011 peak of 100,000,000 households. Since the mid-2000s, HLN has been available internationally on pay television providers in parts of Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa, and Canada.

==History==
===Launch and early years===
The channel was launched at midnight Eastern Time on January 1, 1982, as CNN2. The channel&#x27;s launch was simulcast nationwide on sister networks CNN and Superstation WTBS (now simply TBS), starting at 11:45 p.m. on December 31, 1981, as a preview for cable providers that had not yet reached agreements to carry CNN2. Following a preview reel by original CNN anchor Lou Waters and an introduction by founder and then-Turner Broadcasting CEO Ted Turner, Chuck Roberts (who would become the channel&#x27;s longest-serving news anchor, with a 28-year career with CNN2/Headline News that lasted until his retirement on July 30, 2010) and Denise LeClair anchored the channel&#x27;s first newscast.

Originally, the channel&#x27;s programming was formatted around the idea that a viewer could tune in at any time of day or night (instead of having to wait for the once- or twice-daily national news segments in local newscasts, or morning or evening network news programs), and receive up-to-date information on the top national and international stories in just 30 minutes. This &quot;Headline News Wheel&quot; format—which was derived from the &quot;wheel&quot; segment schedules used by all-news radio stations and repeated each half-hour—featured national and world news at the top of the hour (:00/:30), business and personal finance reports (&quot;Dollars and Sense&quot;) at :15/:45 after the hour; sports scores and headlines (&quot;Headline Sports&quot;) at :20/50 after; and lifestyle reports at :25/:55 after. The :25/:55 lifestyle segment was designed to allow local cable systems the option of pre-empting it with a local headline &quot;capsule&quot; from an associated regional cable news channel or a local television station. Another regular feature, the &quot;Hollywood Minute&quot;, was often fitted-in after the &quot;Headline Sports&quot; segment. In the channel&#x27;s early years, a two-minute recap of the hour&#x27;s top stories, the &quot;CNN Headlines,&quot; would run after the sports segment.

On August 9, 1982, what had been called &quot;CNN2&quot; for its first eight months on the air was renamed Headline News, though the network would be referred to on-air as &quot;CNN Headline News&quot; for much of the mid-1980s. (Beginning around 1988, some newspapers began referring to the channel as &quot;HLN Headline News.&quot;) By 1992, the channel was often abbreviated as &quot;HN&quot; (the channel would later incorporate a die-cut &quot;HN&quot; block design within the original variant of its third logo when it was introduced in 1989, before it was fully supplanted by the wordmark that accompanied it in 1992, which was later italicized). During its first year, Headline News had a competitor in the form of ABC/Group W&#x27;s Satellite News Channel, which operated from June 21, 1982, to October 27, 1983. After its shutdown, SNC&#x27;s satellite slot was then purchased by Ted Turner to expand Headline News&#x27; reach further into additional homes. Shortly after, sister station WTBS handed over production duties for their &quot;NewsWatch&quot; news capsules to Headline News (resulting in these interstitials switching from an in-studio anchor format to being presented in voiceover only), and at various times, other specialized news capsules produced by Headline News aired as well; the &quot;NewsWatch&quot; segments as well as daily Headline News simulcasts were phased out on TBS&#x27;s local and national feeds in 1996 after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) relaxed regulatory requirements on public affairs programming.

Jon Petrovich was hired in the mid-1980s by Turner to lead Headline News. In 1990, Headline News developed &quot;Local Edition&quot;, a six-minute-long local newscast, whose content was produced by a local broadcast station in the participating market, airing at the end of each half-hour of Headline News&#x27; rolling news block. The channel included the &quot;CNN&quot; branding in its name intermittently for most of its history, before being incorporated on a regular basis from 1997 to 2007 (though an alternate logo without the CNN logo was used for news broadcasts through 2001).

In 1989, Headline News introduced a ticker that appeared at the lower one-third of the screen – except during commercial breaks, which initially showed specific financial data with indexes of the major stock exchanges (including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500) and quotes for major companies during trading hours, which were updated on a 15-minute delay. In 1992, the channel added the &quot;Headline News SportsTicker&quot;, which showed sports scores and schedules for the day&#x27;s upcoming games, creating the first continuous news ticker on television. The redesign resulted in video of the rolling newscasts becoming pillarboxed with blue bars on the left and right wings of the screen (matching the ticker&#x27;s original coloring), before it returned to a full-screen format, with the ticker becoming a translucent black background overlaid on the lower third of the video, as part of a 1994 update to the channel&#x27;s graphics package that also added weather forecasts for select major U.S. cities to the ticker. At the same time, the network&#x27;s bug was integrated into the ticker, and thus, the logo was no longer used in the copyright at the end of each broadcast.

Like CNN, the parent company Turner Broadcasting System was acquired by Time Warner in 1996.

===George H. W. Bush death hoax===
On January 8, 1992, Headline News almost became the victim of a hoax. When President George H. W. Bush fainted at a state dinner in Tokyo, Japan, a person claiming to be the president&#x27;s physician called into the channel&#x27;s Atlanta headquarters and claimed that Bush had died. At 9:45 a.m., anchor Don Harrison prepared to break the story, stating &quot;This just in to CNN Headline News, and we say right off the bat, we have not confirmed this through any other sources...&quot; Executive producer Roger Bahre, who was off-camera, immediately yelled &quot;No! Stop!&quot; After glancing away momentarily, Harrison continued, &quot;We are now getting a correction. We will not give you that story. It was regarding some rather tragic news involving President Bush, but updating that story, President Bush is reported to be resting comfortably.&quot; It turned out that an Idaho man, James Edward Smith, called CNN posing as the president&#x27;s physician. A CNN employee entered the information into a centralized computer used by both CNN and Headline News, and it nearly got out on the air before it could be verified. Smith was subsequently questioned by the Secret Service and hospitalized at a private medical facility for evaluation.

===Jukebox effect===

In 1992, Headline News pioneered the use of a digital video &quot;jukebox&quot; to recycle segments of one newscast seamlessly into another. The new technology reduced the number of staffers needed by enabling news segments to be re-used throughout an entire day (previously, anchors read the same stories repeatedly, hour after hour, with the second 15 minutes of each half-hour in the &quot;wheel&quot; being broadcast on videotape every third and fourth hour). This resulted in the layoffs of part of its staff, including such anchors as Lyn Vaughn, David Goodnow and Bob Losure, all of whom had been with Headline News for over 10 years.

=== 1999 reformatting ===
On June 15, 1999, the network underwent a complete visual revamp, including an updated ticker (now dubbed the &quot;Superticker&quot;), a brand-new newsroom and studio, and a sectioning of the channel&#x27;s schedule into four distinct dayparts, to convey the idea that, unlike CNN, which aired long-form programming such as discussion shows and documentaries, Headline News never stopped offering straight news coverage. The daypart blocks each ran for six hours and utilized their own special branding and color-coding (which extended to the graphics and segment introductions): &quot;First Watch&quot; (from 6:00 a.m.-12 midday Eastern Time, colored yellow), &quot;Second Watch&quot; (12 midday - 6:00 p.m. ET, colored red), &quot;Third Watch&quot; (6:00 p.m.-12 midnight ET, colored green), and &quot;Late Watch&quot; (12 midnight - 6:00 a.m. ET, colored blue). Additional segments were also added prior to commercial breaks: &quot;Best Bets On...&quot;, which provided top picks in categories such as films (with information supplied by publications owned by then-sister company Time Inc.), and &quot;Week-At-A-Glance&quot;, which provided summaries of important events occurring that week. To promote the change, two new slogans were introduced: &quot;Get To The Point News&quot; and &quot;24 Hour Nonstop Headlines&quot; (the latter frequently used in ident bumpers).

=== 2001 re-launch ===
On August 6, 2001, CNN Headline News unveiled a revamp of the network&#x27;s on-air format, promoted with a new slogan, &quot;Real news, real fast&quot;. The centerpiece of the new format was the replacement of the network&#x27;s ticker with a large pane across the bottom of the screen, which displayed headlines and other information (such as weather updates and sports news). The network also introduced another new studio and multi-anchor format, and announced plans to add more live rolling news coverage. CNN described the new design as being inspired by the internet, in an attempt to appeal to younger viewers; the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; noted that the channel&#x27;s viewership had been dropping, and skewing towards viewers over 50, which are not desirable to most advertisers.

Upon its launch, the new format received mixed reviews, with critics arguing that the new screen format conveyed too much information at once, distracting viewers from its main video programming. Critics also drew comparisons to financial news channels, as well as a similar increase in on-screen information announced by sports news service ESPNews. Steve Johnson of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; explained that &quot;the video portion of Headline News&#x27; subdivided screen occupies only about a third of the total real estate. My 27-inch set shrinks, in effect, to a 14-incher when tuned to Headline News. Never mind the old-school problem of trying to spot the hockey puck; people with smaller sets watching sports highlights here will have trouble finding a basketball.&quot;

===2005–2013: &quot;Headline Prime&quot;, &quot;News and Views&quot;===

In February 2005, the network launched a new primetime block known as &quot;Headline Prime&quot;; the block was designed to feature opinion-driven and personality-based programs (in contrast to the &quot;hard news&quot; programming of CNN), which network executive Ken Jautz described as a shift to &quot;news to views&quot;. Its launch lineup featured &quot;Prime News Tonight&quot;, the entertainment news program &quot;Showbiz Tonight&quot; with A. J. Hammer, and an eponymous current affairs program hosted by legal commentator Nancy Grace, which featured news and analysis related to crime and court cases. Noam Cohen of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the new lineup as being reminiscent of Fox News Channel.

In May 2006, &quot;Headline Prime&quot; added an eponymous program hosted by conservative talk radio host Glenn Beck. Both &quot;Nancy Grace&quot; and &quot;Glenn Beck&quot; brought major ratings gains to Headline News, especially within the key demographics, although its daytime programming only saw modest increases. &quot;Exposed: The Extremist Agenda&quot;, a Glenn Beck special aired in November 2006, broke a million viewers and was the network&#x27;s most-watched program of the year. That year, Headline News also launched a morning show hosted by Robin Meade, &quot;Robin &amp; Company&quot;—which was later re-branded as &quot;Morning Express&quot; in 2007.

On December 15, 2008, alongside an associated revamp of CNN&#x27;s on-air presentation, Headline News underwent a rebranding with a new speech bubble-themed logo, and officially adopted the initialism &quot;HLN&quot; as its on-air name. &quot;News and Views&quot; was also adopted as the network&#x27;s new slogan. In September 2010, Scott Safon was named as president of HLN, succeeding Jautz (who was promoted to president of the main CNN channel).

On November 4, 2011, HLN launched its own website at HLNtv.com, which featured content related to HLN television programs, and other &quot;must see and must share&quot; stories.

In May 2012, HLN acquired the rights to broadcast the Daytime Emmy Awards, beginning with the 39th annual event on June 23, 2012; this marked the first time that the awards ceremony was aired on pay television, instead of terrestrial television. With 912,000 viewers (not counting four repeat broadcasts, which brought the total to two million), the broadcast was &quot;the most watched regularly scheduled, non-news telecast&quot; ever on HLN.

&quot;Nancy Grace&quot; would achieve notoriety for its extensive coverage of the disappearance and death of two year-old Caylee Anthony; HLN was credited with having &quot;almost single-handedly inflated the Anthony case from a routine local murder into a national obsession&quot;. HLN subsequently devoted a significant amount of coverage to the murder trial against Caylee&#x27;s mother Casey Anthony—whom Grace referred to as the &quot;tot mom&quot; on-air—including live gavel-to-gavel coverage, followed by continued coverage and commentary during primetime programs such as &quot;Nancy Grace&quot;. HLN reached an average audience of 982,000 viewers in June 2011, and &quot;Nancy Grace&quot; experienced an 80% increase in viewership—second only to &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; on Fox News in its time slot.

During the reading of the verdict on July 5, 2011, HLN achieved a record-high peak audience of 5.2 million viewers, while &quot;Nancy Grace&quot; achieved a record-high 2.9 million viewers, beating other basic cable news channels (including Fox News) in the 8 p.m. hour. HLN executive vice president Scot Safon called the trial &quot;a gigantic deal&quot; for the network.

Later that year, HLN provided similar coverage for the trial of Conrad Murray, who was accused of prescribing the drugs that caused the death of Michael Jackson. Although the Conrad Murray trial did not initially have as strong of an impact on ratings as the Casey Anthony trial, viewership began to increase during the testimony phase, and HLN reported that 2.1 million viewers were watching the network during the reading of the guilty verdict. The network reported a 98% year-over-year gain in viewership for the month of October 2011.

===2013–2015: Focus on social media===

Albie Hecht joined HLN as Executive Vice President and GM in September 2013. In November 2013, consumer advocate Clark Howard ended his five-year relationship with HLN, including his appearances on &quot;Morning Express with Robin Meade&quot; and &quot;Evening Express&quot; as well as his own eponymous weekend afternoon program. The move came in response to planned changes occurring at HLN, which sought to re-position the network as the &quot;first TV home for the social media generation.&quot;

Throughout 2014, HLN&#x27;s news content began to skew towards millennials, with an increasing focus on content popular on social networks alongside major headlines. For a period, HLN also aired &quot;RightThisMinute&quot;, a syndicated program focusing on viral videos. In June 2014, Time Warner made a bid to acquire a stake in Vice Media, with an intent for the company to take over and relaunch HLN. Time Warner abandoned the deal in August, and Vice subsequently partnered with A&amp;E Networks to launch Viceland in 2016.

These plans culminated on January 13, 2015, when HLN underwent a major revamp in its programming and on-air presentation; the network introduced several new social media-themed programs, including the new afternoon block &quot;The Daily Share&quot;, &quot;Jack Vale: Offline&quot; – a docusoap following YouTuber Jack Vale, Ali Nejad&#x27;s &quot;The Social Life&quot;, and &quot;Keywords&quot;, a social media-themed game show hosted by Summer Sanders. HLN also adopted an updated logo, and introduced a new set at Studio 7 of the CNN Center, used by &quot;Morning Express&quot; and &quot;The Daily Share&quot;. The new studio had a &quot;coffee house&quot;-styled design with no traditional anchor desk, and a &quot;Social Circle&quot; designed to encourage interaction between hosts and guests. T-Mobile US also signed on to serve as a sponsor for &quot;The Daily Share&quot;, allowing on-set branding and sponsored segments during the program.

In late-May 2015, &quot;The Daily Share&quot; was cut from five hours to two, with the remainder of its timeslot filled by CNN original series and specials, followed by next-day encores of &quot;Nancy Grace&quot; and &quot;Dr. Drew On Call&quot;.

=== 2016–2022: Change in strategy, integration of true crime programming ===

On November 24, 2015, CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker announced, in a memo to network staff, that Hecht would depart HLN; Ken Jautz, who oversaw the network as its president prior to Hecht&#x27;s appointment in 2013, would head the network in the interim. The memo outlined plans to restructure its daytime and overnight programming to more closely resemble CNN, including a focus on documentary films.

In June 2016, HLN announced that Erica Hill would re-join the network to host a new, afternoon program from New York later in the year. Later that month, HLN also announced that Michaela Pereira, a former anchor of CNN&#x27;s &quot;New Day&quot;, would host the new Los Angeles-based morning show &quot;MichaeLA&quot; beginning on July 11, 2016. The new program was positioned as a companion to &quot;Morning Express&quot;, airing from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. ET (7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. PT), and promoted as an alternative to network morning shows tape-delayed from airings for the East Coast.

On June 30, 2016, Nancy Grace announced that she would end her show and leave HLN in October 2016, after nearly a decade with the network. It was replaced by a new program, &quot;Primetime Justice with Ashleigh Banfield&quot;. Erica Hill&#x27;s new program, &quot;On the Story&quot;, premiered on October 10, 2016.

In January 2017, HLN announced the January 27 premiere of &quot;How It Really Happened&quot;, a new documentary series hosted by Hill Harper reporting on the &quot;most notorious crimes, mysteries, trials, and celebrity tragedies of our time&quot;. The series was the first production of CNN&#x27;s Original Series Development staff that was developed specifically for HLN. On January 30, 2017, it was announced that CNN anchor Carol Costello would return to HLN to host a new program from Los Angeles. In March 2017, HLN announced that S.E. Cupp would host a new early-evening program on HLN, &quot;S. E. Cupp Unfiltered&quot;, beginning in June 2017.

On May 8, 2017, HLN underwent a rebranding, adopting a new logo and slogan, &quot;News that hits home&quot;. The network began to position its news content towards regional headlines, crime, and entertainment stories — leaving CNN to focus upon &quot;in-depth&quot; political coverage and world affairs. In January 2018, HLN began to reintroduce the Headline News brand during its news programming (although HLN remains the network&#x27;s primary name), and also introduced &quot;Headlines Now&quot;—a recap of top stories airing every half-hour during its daytime lineup.

In August 2018, &quot;S.E. Cupp Unfiltered&quot; was quietly moved to CNN as a weekly program on Saturday evenings. On October 16, 2018, HLN cancelled &quot;Across America with Carol Costello&quot;, &quot;MichaeLA&quot;, and &quot;Crime &amp; Justice with Ashleigh Banfield&quot;. With the cancellation of the three shows, &quot;Morning Express with Robin Meade&quot; brought back its original five-hour timeslot from 6:00 a.m. to noon, and &quot;On the Story&quot; was expanded to three hours and will air from noon until 3:00 p.m.

By 2022, &quot;On the Story&quot; and other live programming such as &quot;True Crime Live&quot; had been cancelled, leaving only one news program each day – &quot;Morning Express&quot; on weekdays, and &quot;Weekend Express&quot; on Saturday and Sunday mornings – which were followed by true crime documentaries such as &quot;Forensic Files&quot; for the remainder of the broadcast day.

=== 2022–present: End of original live programming and decline ===

On December 1, 2022, as part of cost-cutting measures imposed by new owner Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)—formed earlier that year with the merger of previous owner WarnerMedia with Discovery, Inc.—new CNN president Chris Licht announced that HLN would no longer produce original live news programming effective December 6, and that HLN would merge its operations with sister channel Investigation Discovery under Warner Bros. Discovery U.S. Networks head Kathleen Finch. Licht stated that the company was aiming to direct its resources towards CNN&#x27;s &quot;core news programming and products&quot; going forward.

On December 6, the channel began simulcasting &quot;CNN This Morning&quot; daily during part of the previous &quot;Morning Express&quot; and &quot;Weekend Express&quot; timeslots, transitioning to the morning edition of &quot;CNN News Central&quot; as of February 26, 2024; one observer has indicated that HLN is still required to carry some news programming in order to fulfill contracts with cable providers. True crime documentary programs—primarily &quot;Forensic Files&quot;, though initially including original episodes of series commissioned prior to the restructuring such as &quot;Real Life Nightmare&quot;—air throughout the rest of the day, along with marathons of Warner Bros. Television drama series on weekends to promote their availability on the Max streaming service. Some analysts have suggested that this may be just a transitional move towards WBD using the channel space for a different format entirely.

==Programming==
Prior to its reformulation as a true crime channel, HLN&#x27;s weekday lineup consisted primarily of rolling news programming during the morning and early-afternoon hours. The final original news programs that aired under this format were &quot;Morning Express&quot;, a morning news program hosted by Robin Meade with co-anchors Bob Van Dillen, Jennifer Westhoven and Hines Ward, and Saturday and Sunday equivalent &quot;Weekend Express&quot;, hosted by Susan Hendricks, both of which were canceled in December 2022. As of this time, the only remaining live news program on the channel is a simulcast of the morning edition of &quot;CNN News Central&quot;, intended primarily to satisfy carriage agreements requiring a quota of live news programming on the channel.

HLN&#x27;s remaining dayparts primarily feature a focus on true crime programming. The network has extensively aired reruns of the former Court TV series &quot;Forensic Files&quot;; as of April 2016, the program took up about 58% of the channel&#x27;s weekly schedule. In March 2017, HLN executive Ken Jautz stated that the network was making an effort to produce more original series; some of the new series that were slated to premiere in 2017, including &quot;Beyond Reasonable Doubt&quot;, &quot;Something&#x27;s Killing Me&quot;, &quot;Inside with Chris Cuomo&quot; (which premiered October 20), and the second season of &quot;How It Really Happened&quot; (whose first season premiered January 27, 2017), were designed to complement the popularity of &quot;Forensic Files&quot; and other true crime programs, as well as HLN&#x27;s renewed focus on crime coverage as part of its news programming. After airing new episodes in simulcast with CNN in 2016, &quot;The Hunt with John Walsh&quot; moved to HLN for its fourth season. In February 2020, HLN premiered &quot;Forensic Files II,&quot; a revival of &quot;Forensic Files&quot;. In April 2024, &quot;How It Really Happened&quot; moved its first-run episodes to CNN.

HLN has occasionally experimented with entertainment programming carrying news and political themes; on February 12, 2015, HLN aired the film &quot;Glory&quot; under the banner &quot;News and a Movie&quot;, which was accompanied by panel discussions on the film&#x27;s cultural relevance in the present day. Alongside TruTV, HLN also aired encores of special episodes of TBS&#x27;s late night talk show &quot;Conan&quot; set in Cuba and Armenia. In November 2022, HLN aired a marathon of the first four seasons of Warner Bros.-produced political drama &quot;The West Wing&quot; over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, marking the first time HLN had aired a scripted television series.

The network has also, in recent years, served as an additional outlet for TNT Sports broadcasts, including joining its sister channels in simulcasting Turner&#x27;s golf event franchise &quot;The Match&quot;, and serving as an overflow channel in the event of conflicts with TBS, TNT, and TruTV.

At 4:00 a.m. ET on weekdays, HLN used to broadcast &quot;CNN Student News&quot; (formerly known as &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot; from its 1989 debut, not to be confused with the current CNN program of the same name), a 10-minute news program designed for broadcast in schools that is produced as part of the Cable in the Classroom initiative; the program is anchored by Carl Azuz, with reports on the day&#x27;s news presented in a simplified format (and with stories featuring graphic imagery or adult themes usually left out from the program). It no longer airs on HLN as of 2014, but is still available as a free podcast on CNN&#x27;s website and iTunes. On December 16, 2016, the program was renamed &quot;CNN 10&quot;.

==Distribution==
Due to the channel&#x27;s tradition of airing rolling news coverage, HLN had become popular with people who may not have time to watch lengthy news reports, and as a fast source of news for public locations like airports, bars, and many other places. Supermarkets that carried the discontinued CNN Checkout Channel service were offered a feed of Headline News to broadcast on its televisions.

The channel&#x27;s program audio was also simulcast on AM radio stations across the country via Westwood One, including a station in Atlanta which was not owned by Turner, WCNN (today a sports talk station with the same call letters), which broadcast from CNN Center with local contributions; all of CNN&#x27;s U.S. radio operations (including the HLN simulcast) were discontinued on April 1, 2012, as part of Westwood One&#x27;s dissolution into Dial Global. HLN&#x27;s audio feed was carried on XM Satellite Radio channel 123 and Sirius Satellite Radio channel 116. Since the merger of both entities as Sirius XM, it is now carried on channel 117. As of February 2019, the audio simulcast is also distributed on Entercom&#x27;s Radio.com (now Audacy) website and app.

On July 18, 2011, HLN launched TV Everywhere streaming through the CNN mobile app for subscribers on participating television providers.

===Broadcast syndication===
From its inception, Turner Broadcasting had syndicated portions of CNN2/Headline News&#x27;s schedule to local television stations throughout the country—typically in half-hour or hour-long blocks—for broadcast in various timeslots of their choice (usually in morning, daytime or late access slots during the network&#x27;s early years). Most of them were commercial outlets, including both major network affiliates and independent stations (some like WSVN in Miami, following its January 1989 affiliation switch from NBC to Fox, even carried it as a stand-in evening network newscast), though a few public television stations (such as PBS member WTTW in Chicago) carried blocks of its newscasts into the late 1980s.

WTBS, initially to encourage its national viewers to ask their local cable provider to carry the network full-time, aired a half-hour simulcast of Headline News each morning at 5:30 a.m. ET from the latter&#x27;s inception until 1996 (a separate simulcast aired locally at 6:00 a.m. in the Atlanta market). Abbreviated Headline News broadcasts would also occasionally serve as filler (bookended by the &quot;NewsWatch&quot; intro and outro) before the start of movie presentations or live sporting events. (WPCH-TV, which fully separated its Atlanta signal from the national TBS feed in October 2007, aired a simulcast of the first hour of &quot;Morning Express&quot; daily at 6:00 a.m. until Meredith Corporation—which had been managing the station alongside CBS-affiliated sister WGCL-TV (now WANF) since 2011—completed its purchase of WPCH from Turner/Time Warner in 2017, replacing it with a simulcast of WGCL&#x27;s local morning newscast.)

The early 1990s saw the culmination of Headline News&#x27; supplemental syndication model as many commercial stations (particularly affiliates of ABC, NBC and CBS) that were transitioning over to instituting 24-hour broadcasts began taking feeds of the channel&#x27;s overnight programming, in lieu of scheduling syndicated entertainment programs, movies or infomercials to fill their previous nightly sign-off periods. Headline News had gained competition in that market during that approximate timeframe through the November 1989 launch of All News Channel, a hybrid syndicated news service and satellite television network (operated by the Hubbard Broadcasting–Viacom joint venture CONUS Communications) that also began syndicating its programming feed to stations seeking to fill local airtime in overnight time periods as well as other dayparts. In later years, even after the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks launched their own overnight news programs—&quot;Nightside&quot; on NBC, &quot;World News Now&quot; on ABC, and &quot;Up to the Minute&quot; on CBS—over the course of the 1991–92 season in the wake of the Gulf War (which they developed coincidentally to compete with CNN, which was lauded for its round-the-clock war coverage in early 1991), Headline News programming continued to air on many of their affiliates as a complement to the network broadcasts; besides this, it also provided them with an overnight news option during the weekend, when no such option was offered (outside of &quot;Nightside&quot; during its 1991–98 run).

The supplemental broadcast distribution ended following the 2005 introduction of the &quot;Headline Prime&quot; block, forcing many affiliates (including NBC stations that lost a network news option following the September 1998 cancellation of &quot;Nightside&quot;) to fill airtime previously reserved for Headline News broadcasts with syndicated and paid programming.

===International===
Until 1995, much of Headline News&#x27; programming was simulcast on sister channel CNN International; the channel&#x27;s news ticker was not displayed on CNN International during its simulcasts of Headline News programming.

London&#x27;s Thames Television, as part of their &quot;Thames Into The Night&quot; overnight service, briefly aired a half-hour of Headline News at 5:30 AM in 1988, before ITN launched their own early morning bulletin later that year.

Beginning in the mid-2000s, the channel has been available in certain countries outside the United States, particularly in Asia, Latin America, Middle East and North Africa. Although the international feed&#x27;s programming lineup is identical to the U.S. feed, program teasers, stock market figures, and weather forecasts for Asian and Latin American, Middle East and North African cities are used as break fillers in lieu of US-oriented commercials.

In Canada, the American feed of HLN is available on most cable and satellite providers, as it is authorized for carriage as a foreign cable television service by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission; save for a few differences it features the same programming schedule as that seen in the United States, although some programs are blacked out to protect other rightsholders.

An hour of &quot;Morning Express&quot; aired on tape-delay during the overnight hours on the cable/satellite feed of CNN Philippines.

==High definition==
HLN broadcasts in high definition 1080i resolution format. It is available nationally on nearly all pay-TV providers within the United States, and in Canada on satellite provider Bell Satellite TV, which downconverts the HD feed&#x27;s picture resolution to 720p.

<text>The American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, also known as the Bogota Declaration, was the world&#x27;s first international human rights instrument of a general nature, predating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by less than a year.

The Declaration was adopted by the nations of the Americas at the Ninth International Conference of American States in Bogotá, Colombia, on 2 May 1948. The conference and declaration was led and designed chiefly by United States public servants. The same conference adopted the Charter of the Organization of American States and thereby created the OAS.

Chapter One of the Declaration sets forth a catalogue of civil and political rights to be enjoyed by the citizens of the signatory nations, together with additional economic, social, and cultural rights due to them. As a corollary, its second chapter contains a list of corresponding duties. As explained in the preamble:
:&quot;The fulfillment of duty by each individual is a prerequisite to the rights of all. Rights and duties are interrelated in every social and political activity of man. While rights exalt individual liberty, duties express the dignity of that liberty.&quot;

Although strictly speaking a declaration is not a legally binding treaty, the jurisprudence of both the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights holds it to be a source of binding international obligations for the OAS&#x27;s member states. While largely superseded in the current practice of the inter-American human rights system by the more elaborate provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights (in force since 18 July 1978), the terms of the Declaration are still enforced with respect to those states that have not ratified the convention, such as Cuba, the United States, and Canada.

<doc id="323616" wikidata="Q1313396" url="?curid=323616" title="Headline">
<text>The headline is the text indicating the content or nature of the article below it, typically by providing a form of brief summary of its contents.

The large type &quot;front page headline&quot; did not come into use until the late 19th century when increased competition between newspapers led to the use of attention-getting headlines.

It is sometimes termed a news &quot;hed&quot;, a deliberate misspelling that dates from production flow during hot type days, to notify the composing room that a written note from an editor concerned a headline and should not be set in type.

Headlines in English often use a set of grammatical rules known as &quot; headlinese&quot;, designed to meet stringent space requirements by, for example, leaving out forms of the verb &quot;to be&quot; and choosing short verbs like &quot;eye&quot; over longer synonyms like &quot;consider&quot;.

==Production==

A headline&#x27;s purpose is to quickly and briefly draw attention to the story. It is generally written by a copy editor, but may also be written by the writer, the page layout designer, or other editors. The most important story on the front page above the fold may have a larger headline if the story is unusually important. &quot;The New York Times&quot; 21 July 1969 front page stated, for example, that &quot;MEN WALK ON MOON&quot;, with the four words in gigantic size spread from the left to right edges of the page.

In the United States, headline contests are sponsored by the American Copy Editors Society, the National Federation of Press Women, and many state press associations; some contests consider created content already published, others are for works written with winning in mind.

== Typology ==
Research in 1980 classified newspaper headlines into four broad categories: questions, commands, statements, and explanations. Advertisers and marketers classify advertising headlines slightly differently into questions, commands, benefits, news/information, and provocation.

==Research==
A study indicates there has been a substantial increase of sentiment negativity and decrease of emotional neutrality in headlines across written popular U.S.-based news media since 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1371/journal.pone.0276367&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study concluded that those who have gained the most experience with reading newspapers &quot;spend most of their reading time scanning the headlines—rather than reading [all or most of] the stories&quot;.

Headlines can bias readers toward a specific interpretation and readers struggle to update their memory in order to correct initial misconceptions in the cases of misleading or inappropriate headlines.

One approach investigated as a potential countermeasure to online misinformation is &quot;attaching warnings to headlines of news stories that have been disputed by third-party fact-checkers&quot;, albeit its potential problems include e.g. that false headlines that fail to get tagged are considered validated by readers.

==Criticism==

===Sensationalism, inaccuracy and misleading headlines===
====&quot;Slam&quot;====

The use of &quot;slam&quot; in headlines has attracted criticism on the grounds that the word is overused and contributes to media sensationalism. The violent imagery of words like &quot;slam&quot;, &quot;blast&quot;, &quot;rip&quot;, and &quot;bash&quot; has drawn comparison to professional wrestling, where the primary aim is to titillate audiences with a conflict-laden and largely predetermined narrative, rather than provide authentic coverage of spontaneous events.

===Crash blossoms===
&quot;Crash blossoms&quot; is a term used to describe headlines that have unintended ambiguous meanings, such as &quot;The Times&quot; headline &quot;Hospitals named after sandwiches kill five&quot;. The word &#x27;named&#x27; is typically used in headlines to mean &quot;blamed/held accountable/named [in a lawsuit]&quot;, but in this example it seems to say that the hospitals&#x27; names were related to sandwiches. The headline was subsequently changed in the electronic version of the article. The term was coined in August 2009 on the Testy Copy Editors web forum after the &quot;Japan Times&quot; published an article entitled &quot;Violinist Linked to JAL Crash Blossoms&quot; (since retitled to &quot;Violinist shirks off her tragic image&quot;).

==Headlinese==
Headlinese is an abbreviated form of news writing style used in newspaper headlines. Because space is limited, headlines are written in a compressed telegraphic style, using special syntactic conventions, including:
* Forms of the verb &quot;to be&quot; and articles (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;the&quot;) are usually omitted.
* Most verbs are in the simple present tense, e.g. &quot;Governor signs bill&quot;, while the future is expressed by an infinitive, with &quot;to&quot; followed by a verb, as in &quot;Governor to sign bill&quot;
* The conjunction &quot;and&quot; is often replaced by a comma, as in &quot;Bush, Blair laugh off microphone mishap&quot;.
* Individuals are usually specified by surname only, with no honorifics.
* Organizations and institutions are often indicated by metonymy: &quot;Wall Street&quot; for the US financial sector, &quot;Whitehall&quot; for the UK government administration, &quot;Madrid&quot; for the government of Spain, &quot;Davos&quot; for World Economic Forum, and so on.
* Many abbreviations, including contractions and acronyms, are used: in the UK, some examples are &quot;Lib Dems&quot; (for the Liberal Democrats), &quot;Tories&quot; (for the Conservative Party); in the US, &quot;Dems&quot; (for &quot;Democrats&quot;) and &quot;GOP&quot; (for the Republican Party, from the nickname &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;). The period (full point) is usually omitted from these abbreviations, though &quot;U.S.&quot; may retain them, especially in all-caps headlines to avoid confusion with the word &quot;us&quot;.
* Lack of a terminating full stop (period) even if the headline forms a complete sentence.
* Use of single quotation marks to indicate a claim or allegation that cannot be presented as a fact. For example, an article titled &quot;Ultra-processed foods &#x27;linked to cancer covered a study which suggested a link but acknowledged that its findings were not definitive. Linguist Geoffrey K. Pullum characterizes this practice as deceptive, noting that the single-quoted expressions in newspaper headlines are often not actual quotations, and sometimes convey a claim that is not supported by the text of the article. Another technique is to present the claim as a question, hence Betteridge&#x27;s law of headlines.

Some periodicals have their own distinctive headline styles, such as &quot;Variety&quot; and its entertainment-jargon headlines, most famously &quot;Sticks Nix Hick Pix&quot;.

===Commonly used short words===
To save space and attract attention, headlines often use extremely short words, many of which are not otherwise in common use, in unusual or idiosyncratic ways:

* &quot;ace&quot; (a professional, especially a member of an elite sports team, e.g. &quot;England ace&quot;)
* &quot;axe&quot; (to eliminate)

* &quot;row&quot; (an argument or disagreement)
* &quot;rue&quot; (to lament)
* &quot;see&quot; (to forecast)
* &quot;slay&quot; (to murder)
* &quot;slam&quot; (to heavily criticize)
* &quot;slump&quot; (to decrease)
* &quot;snub&quot; (to reject)
* &quot;solon&quot; (to judge)
* &quot;spat&quot; (an argument or disagreement)
* &quot;star&quot; (a celebrity, often modified by another noun, e.g. &quot;soap star&quot;)
* &quot;tap&quot; (to select, choose)
* &quot;tot&quot; (a child)
* &quot;tout&quot; (to put forward)
* &quot;woe&quot; (disappointment or misfortune)

== Famous examples ==

Some famous headlines in periodicals include:
* WALL ST. LAYS AN EGG&quot;Variety&quot; on Black Monday (1929)
* STICKS NIX HICK PIX&quot;Variety&quot; writing that rural moviegoers preferred urban films (1935)
* DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporting the wrong election winner (1948)
* FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD&quot;New York Daily News&quot; reporting the denial of a federal bailout for bankrupt New York City (1975)
* MUSH FROM THE WIMP&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in-house joke headline for an editorial, which was not changed before 161,000 copies had been printed. Theo Lippman Jr. of the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; declared &quot;Mush from the Wimp&quot; the second most famous newspaper headline of the 20th century, behind &quot;Wall St. Lays an Egg&quot; and ahead of &quot;Ford to City: Drop Dead&quot;.
* HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR&quot;New York Post&quot; on a local murder (1983)
* SICK TRANSIT&#x27;S GLORIOUS MONDAY&quot;New York Daily News&quot; front-page caption on a photo (1979) reporting an agreement to avoid fare increases on city transit services, making a multi-word pun on the Latin phrase Sic transit gloria mundi
* GOTCHAThe UK &quot;Sun&quot; on the torpedoing of the Argentine ship &quot;Belgrano&quot; and sinking of a gunboat during the Falklands War (1982)
* FREDDIE STARR ATE MY HAMSTERThe UK &quot;Sun&quot; (1986), claiming that the comedian had eaten a fan&#x27;s pet hamster in a sandwich. The story was later proven false, but is seen as one of the classic tabloid newspaper headlines.
* GREAT SATAN SITS DOWN WITH THE AXIS OF EVIL&quot;The Times&quot; (UK) on US–Iran talks (2007)
* SUPER CALEY GO BALLISTIC CELTIC ARE ATROCIOUS&quot;Sun&quot; on Inverness Caledonian Thistle beating Celtic F.C. in the Scottish Cup; a pun on &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot;
* WE ARE POPE (in German: Wir sind Papst); &quot;Bild&quot; after a German was voted to become Pope Benedict XVI in 2005.

&quot;The New Republic&quot; editor Michael Kinsley began a contest to find the most boring newspaper headline. According to him, no entry surpassed the one that had inspired him to create the contest: &quot;WORTHWHILE CANADIAN INITIATIVE&quot;, over a column by &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Flora Lewis. In 2003, &quot;New York Magazine&quot; published a list of eleven &quot;greatest tabloid headlines&quot;.

<text>Edward II (known also as EII, and previously as Edward the Second and the Red Hot Polkas and e2K) are an English band which play a fusion of world music, English folk and reggae. Active from 1980, the band broke up after losing several key members in 1999, relaunching as &quot;e2K&quot; in 2000. In 2003, the band dissolved once more, but have since reformed for a one-year reunion tour in 2009 under the &quot;Edward II&quot; name, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the breakup of the original band. They reformed in 2015 specifically to produce the Manchester&#x27;s Improving Daily project, which includes the release of new recorded material and a book. The project is designed to celebrate a collection of tunes written in Manchester during the Industrial Revolution, published as Broadsides and currently held in Manchester Central Library.
In 2021 Edward II released the album &quot;Dancing Tunes&quot;, bringing their own unique style to a collection of traditional and historic Jamaican calypso and mento songs that pre-date reggae as we know it today.

==History==
===Edward the Second and the Red Hot Polkas===
The band formed in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire in 1980, in order to play for monthly dances at The Victory Club. Founder members Lizzy Howe-Pellant (melodeon) and Dion Cochrane (tenor banjo) were joined by Paul Burgess, Floss Headford and John Gill (fiddles), Martin Brinsford (sax) and Dave Haines (melodeon and concertina), and bringing in Richard Valentine on piano and as caller. It ran for a year or so in that form.

The Band personnel gradually changed over the years, and in around 1983, Rod Stradling (2-row melodeon) and Danny Stradling (percussion) - newly parted from the Old Swan Band - were asked to join, and John Gill changed from fiddle to bass. With this lineup, in 1985, they recorded a cassette called &quot;Demos&quot;, and a second one, &quot;Promos&quot;, in 1986, by which time Dion had left, replaced by Jon Moore (lead guitar) and they had added two rhythm guitar players, Tom Greenhalgh (from the Mekons) and Barn Stradling. At the end of 1986 they recorded a further 6 tracks which, together with the 5 Promos ones were published as &quot;Ethos&quot;. By 1987 the band had added Steve Goulding (drums), and with this lineup recorded the LP Let&#x27;s Polkasteady: Edward the Second, Cooking Vinyl COOK 007, in 1987.

At a time when the emerging folk rock movement was flourishing as part of the broader folk revival, the band decided that a more natural connection would be with the reggae music of Jamaica, rather than the punk rock they were more familiar with. This came from the rationale that the two music forms were harmonically very similar, were both clearly folk music, the two nations sea-faring heritage, but most importantly to make the politically motivated argument that Britain was and always had been an island of immigrants and that this was reflected in the UK&#x27;s musical heritage. There was also no doubt at the time of the slow and steady impact the West Indian communities, brought to the UK as part of the Windrush migration, was starting to have on British urban culture, and the early Edward II collective were heavily involved in the emerging anti-fascist Rock Against Racism movement.

The band made their LP debut in 1987 with &quot;Let&#x27;s Polka Steady!&quot;, with British dub producer Mad Professor, which contained several reggae inspired instrumentals and is usually considered the highpoint for the original line up. However, it was as a live act that they made their name with a series of gigs at festivals throughout the UK and Europe. Further additions to the fluid line-up during the late 80s included Neil Yates (trumpet), Lorna Bailey (vocals), John Hart (trombone), Gavin Sharp (tenor saxophone), and Alton Zebby (drums), all of whom made their début on the second album &quot;Two Step To Heaven&quot; (1989).

The collective&#x27;s centre of gravity moved with John Gill (bass player, producer and assistant engineer on Never Mind the Bollocks) to Manchester, where he soon developed connections with the reggae musicians surrounding Moss Side and specifically the Rastafarian organisation, The Twelve Tribes of Israel. From this fertile ground (and after John Gill&#x27;s departure) the long-standing line-up, familiar to those that followed the band throughout the nineties, was formed.

===Edward II===
At the start of the 90s the band shortened their name to Edward II and then EII, with Moore, Yates, Sharp, Hart and Zebby joined by new members Tee Carthy (bass), Glen Latouche (vocals), Rees Wesson (melodeon/accordion), and rapper McKilla on 1991&#x27;s &quot;Wicked Men&quot;. Ex-Albion Band member Simon Care (melodeon) joined Edward II in the mid-90s, featuring on the studio albums &quot;Zest&quot; and &quot;This Way Up&quot;. The last of these featured some pure reggae tunes, including ‘Don&#x27;t Let the Fire Go Out’, but the album still retrained more-culturally blended songs. The band performed twice at the Cropredy Folk Festival, held every year by Fairport Convention and one of these performances was released on CD entitled &quot;Live at Cropredy (2000)&quot;. After a ‘sell out’ gig at De Montfort Hall, Leicester on 19 November 1999, Zebby, Latouche, and Carthy elected to leave the band, and this line-up dissolved.

===e2K===
Moore, Yates, and Care re-launched the band in the new millennium as e2K, bringing in Ghanaian instrumentalist Kwame Yeboah, and Albion Band lead singer and guitarist Kellie While. The new infusion of African and traditional British folk influences re-energized the band for two more albums: &quot;Shift&quot; ( 2001) and &quot;If Not Now&quot; (2003). Devotees may feel that this line up could not recapture the originality and vitality of the EII days, but they won some appreciation of their music, being described as ‘a multicultural group for the 21st century&#x27;, whilst popular folk reviewers Living Tradition said of their last album &quot;If Not Now&quot; that &quot;this is an album that crosses a lot of barriers and the folk world should be proud to count them as one of their own.&quot; The lineup dissolved after a tour in 2003.

===Reunion===
To celebrate the ten-year anniversary of their final gig, the last line-up of EII undertook a series of reunion gigs in 2009.

A double-disc &#x27;best-of&#x27; album was also released in 2009, &quot;Edward II: The Definitive Collection&quot;. It uses the &#x27;Edward II&#x27; name but covers the band&#x27;s entire career under all of their names except for e2K. Disc 1 includes songs from their time as Edward the Second and the Red Hot Polkas, whilst Disc 2 includes songs from their time as Edward II.

=== Manchester&#x27;s Improving Daily ===
Taking place throughout 2015 and 2016 the band have come back together, inspired by the discovery of the repertoire known as the Manchester Broadsides and the history and stories which lie behind the songs. Produced in Manchester throughout the industrial revolution, this material tells of hardship, politics, social justice and good times as experienced in the nineteenth century. Often a way of spreading news, promoting events, places or businesses or spreading a political or social message, these songs were designed to have a short shelf life and as such were printed on cheap paper and distributed at the markets around what is now the northern quarter of the city.

The Manchester-born Palestinian singer, Reem Kelani, was commissioned by the Manchester International Festival in 2007 to write a 30-minute composition and to orchestrate and lead its performance by the Beating Wing Orchestra, an assembly of local migrant musicians. Her &quot;Paradise in Strangers&quot; encompassed melodic modes and rhythmic patterns from the wide diversity of origins of the orchestra members. In the concluding movement, Kelani opened with the &quot;Soldier’s Farewell to Manchester&quot; (1859), and the composition closed with a resounding chorus from the whole cast of &quot;Manchester’s Improving Daily&quot;(1830).

The music critic, Mike Butler, wrote thus in the Manchester Metro: &quot;Kelani mischievously sprang the biggest surprise with the final section - an adaption in 6/8 time of a Manchester broadside ballad. It was the first full outing for her own incomparable voice, and surely represented a reconciliation with her birthplace: Reem Kelani is the world’s most prominent Manchester-born Palestinian singer. This impression was confirmed when the singers began chanting in unison, ‘sing hey, sing ho, sing hey down gai-ly, Manchester’s improving dai-ly.’ Exile has its bright moments too.&quot;

<text>2300 AD, originally titled Traveller: 2300, is a tabletop science fiction role-playing game created by Game Designers&#x27; Workshop (GDW) and first published in 1986.

==Publication history==
GDW created the popular science fiction role-playing game &quot;Traveller&quot; in 1977 with themes taken from Space Opera short stories and novels of the Golden Age of SF. 

In 1984, GDW published the unrelated and much grittier post-apocalyptic role-playing game &quot;Twilight 2000&quot;, set in the year 2000 following a nuclear war. Two years later, wanting to follow up with a similar-themed &quot;hard science&quot; space-based role-playing game, GDW took the &quot;Twilight 2000&quot; storyline, moved it forward three centuries, and created a new game where humanity has recovered enough from the war that they are able to travel to nearby star systems. Although this new game, published in 1986, had no ties to &quot;Traveller&quot;, and used a completely different game system, GDW titled it &quot;Traveller: 2300&quot;. The game was published as a boxed set that contained: 
*48-page Player Manual
*48-page Referee&#x27;s Manual
*8-page Forms Book
*8-page Near Star List
*8-page introductory adventure, &quot;The Tricolour&#x27;s Shadow&quot;
*paper map with 3D representation of nearby star systems within 50 light years of Earth 
*a 10-sided die

The similar titles caused confusion between &quot;Traveller&quot; and the new game, and in 1988, GDW released a second edition retitled &quot;2300 AD&quot;. Perhaps because of the initial confusion, &quot;Traveller: 2300&quot; / &quot;2300 AD&quot; sold poorly compared to &quot;Traveller&quot;.

About the same time, several competitors released cyberpunk-themed role-playing games which proved to be popular, including R. Talsorian Games&#x27;s &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; (1988) and FASA&#x27;s &quot;Shadowrun&quot; (1989). In an attempt to ride this wave, GDW published &quot;Earth/Cybertech Sourcebook&quot; in 1989 to give &quot;2300 AD&quot; a cyberpunk theme and also return the focus of the game to Earth rather than space.

GDW also quickly published several other cyberpunk supplements for &quot;2300 AD&quot;, but sales remained poor. As games historian Shannon Appelcline noted in the 2014 book &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;The last few &quot;2300&quot; books supported this darker cyberpunk future, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to sustain the line, which came to an end in 1990.&quot; 

The game was revived twice, first in 2007 by QuikLink Interactive as a supplement titled &quot;2320 AD&quot; for the &quot;Traveller20&quot; game (based on the d20 System), and then in 2012 by Mongoose Publishing as a &quot;2300 AD&quot; setting sourcebook for their version of &quot;Traveller&quot;. The Mongoose version is still in publication.

==Setting==
The game setting follows on from that of GDW&#x27;s military role-playing game &quot;&quot;, in which a worldwide conventional war with limited nuclear exchanges at the end of the 20th century nearly brought about the end of civilization. In the intervening three centuries, mankind has rebuilt and returned to space. A Space Elevator orbital interface has been constructed, connecting the city of Libreville, Gabon to a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. Also, practical means of faster-than-light (FTL) travel have been discovered, leading to the exploration and colonization of planets orbiting nearby stars. The post-Westphalian nation-state remains dominant, and most space colonies are considered the territories of various nations back on Earth, resembling the European colonial era of the 18th and 19th centuries.

The dominant power, both on Earth and in space, is France, recently reorganized (in 2298) as the Third French Empire, and incorporating much of Africa. France was able to survive the nuclear war relatively unscathed by abandoning its NATO allies and officially withdrawing from hostilities at the start of the Third World War, retaining enough assets and skilled people to develop a significant head-start in the race for postwar rebuilding, political leverage, and technological development. Competing powers include the United Kingdom, Manchuria, Germany, and an alliance between the weakened United States and Australia. All of these control certain extrasolar planets themselves. There are three major lanes of explored space, called Arms, named after the nations which dominate them (the French Arm, the American Arm, and the Chinese Arm (Mongoose 2300AD renames the Chinese Arm to the Manchurian Arm, as the nation of Manchuria, separate from then-backwater China, is the leading nation in that part of space)). Lesser routes leading off the arms are called &quot;Fingers&quot;.

It is still early in mankind&#x27;s expansion into space, and exploration has reached little beyond 40 light years from Earth. As of the time period of the game, each of the three Arms is saddled with a particular difficulty. The French Arm is the route along which the alien Kafer are pushing an aggressive invasion into human space. The Chinese Arm is beset by an insurgent terrorist faction. The American Arm has reached a dead end, further expansion along it impossible under available technology.

Mankind has met with several intelligent alien civilizations, all of which are decidedly strange and non-human, from the genetically-engineered Pentapods to the reflexively bellicose Kafers.

==Technology==
A faster-than-light device called the Stutterwarp Drive allows mankind to achieve practical travel between planetary systems. Ships can usually reach a speed of 3.5 light years per day. The primary limitation of the Stutterwarp Drive is that it can only propel a ship up to a maximum of 7.7 light years before it must enter a gravity well to discharge accumulated lethal radiation that would otherwise kill the crew. Because ships need to reach a world within this distance, the effect of this limitation is the creation of lanes along which travel, commerce, and wars are conducted.

Overall, the technological level of 2300 AD is not significantly more advanced than that of late 20th-century industrial society. The depicted technology refines or updates established technologies, boosted by a few scientifically reasonable breakthroughs anticipated at the time of the game&#x27;s publication. The &quot;wonder-tech&quot; of Space opera is deliberately absent, with the notable exception of faster-than-light travel. For example, most personal combat is still conducted with guns that fire chemically propelled rounds, even though energy weapons do exist. Also, no form of gravity manipulation exists, so spaceships must be designed to account for Micro-gravity conditions, and transferring from orbital space to a planetary surface (or vice versa) remains expensive. The properties and limitations of the Stutterwarp Drive and all other technologies are defined in considerable detail to prevent the use of technological Deus ex machina to resolve intractable situations.

DNA Modifications (DNAMs) are what colonists undergo to adapt to life on their respective planets. GDW 2300AD originally had DNAMs for one colony, the high-gravity world of King. Mongoose 2300AD has expanded this so that a DNAM would be configured for each colony. These would involve both internal and external physical changes, such as Dry World Adaptation, where a character would retain all their water and urinate crystals. Another more extreme DNAM is Merman, which enables a person to live underwater.

== Sentient species ==
The following sentient species are known to humans in &quot;2300 AD&quot;:

* The awesome and enigmatic &quot;AGRA Intelligence&quot;
* &quot;Ebers&quot;: confined to one planet in 2300, they once had an interstellar civilization with a presence on at least three other planets, although all that is left of them on those planets are ruins from a destructive war.
* &quot;Kafers (Kaefers)&quot;: the primary adversary species in &quot;2300 AD&quot; are humanoids with mandibles and integument similar to some Terran insects and a hard dorsal shell (thus the name derived from German &quot;Käfer&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;). Their technological advancement is equivalent to humanity&#x27;s, including interstellar travel capability. Kafer individuals normally have a low intelligence, approximate to a human IQ of 40. However, in stressful situations, their equivalent to an adrenaline reaction functions as a neural accelerant, pleasurably increasing situational awareness, speed of reasoning, and creativity. The Kafers feel most alive when in danger, and are, in effect, addicted to it. The more often an individual Kafer experiences stress-induced intelligence, the more intelligent they remain in a non-stressed state. While the Kafers are carrion-eating scavengers, and not intrinsically violent, their neurobiology creates a quandary for their civilization: civilization acts to reduce violence and stress and leads to a steady loss of a Kafer culture&#x27;s intelligence and, finally, inevitable conquest by smarter, less-civilized cultures. The present Kafer civilization has resolved this quandary with systems of ritualized violence and a glorification of war. Ruled over by a small minority of &quot;permanently bright&quot; individuals, the Kafers are paradoxically both terrified and excited by humanity, since humans resemble the &quot;smart barbarians&quot; that periodically destroyed earlier civilizations on their home planet, and therefore represent the real competition needed to inspire their civilization to advance. In the year 2301, the Kafer start an invasion of human space that will be costly to both attackers and defenders and serves as one of the major dramatic events of the game line. Mongoose &quot;2300AD&quot; altered their name to &quot;Kaefers.&quot;
* The primitive &quot;Klaxun&quot; (&quot;Arbors&quot;): A species of sentient tree-like creatures native to a nearly-frozen world at the edge of the French Arm (Mongoose &quot;2300AD&quot; altered their name to &quot;Arbors&quot;)
* The nuclear war-devastated &quot;Little Guys&quot;
* The long-dead &quot;Medusae&quot;
* &quot;Pentapods&quot;: an amphibious species with a preference for aquatic environments, with a biotechnological technical infrastructure (including starships that are massive living beings). The fact that some Pentapods show signs of genetic engineering and are treated as tools by other Pentapods masks a deeper secret regarding their origins.
* &quot;Sung&quot;: a species of winged humanoids of smaller stature than humans, whose technological development is close to but not as great as humanity&#x27;s in most areas; they are currently only capable of interplanetary travel. In some areas, like medical technology, interface spacecraft, lasers, and solar energy technology, they are superior to humanity.
* &quot;Xiang&quot;: a species inhabiting a gas giant&#x27;s moon in the Sung home star system, formerly enslaved by the Sung but now free after a brief military action by a number of human nations. Relations among the Sung are governed by a principle that the strong dominate the weak but provide the weak with requested assistance to bring them up to their masters&#x27; level, and they took advantage of the fact that the Xiang never made such requests. The Sung now consider humanity to be their superiors in this system and are chafing at humanity&#x27;s refusal to improve them by showing them how to perform FTL travel.
* The &quot;Ylii&quot;, a multi-species culture enslaved by the Kafers.

==Sentient species mysteries==
Every sentient species has certain mysteries that are unknown to humans in &quot;2300 AD&quot; and which can be unlocked through adventure and research. One of the main parts of the drama in &quot;2300 AD&quot; campaigns is the unfolding of these mysteries.

Some of these mysteries can help humanity in its &quot;battle for the stars&quot;, while others are simply curiosities, and a few are dangerous and even potentially disastrous for humankind.

In many cases, human nation states would be willing to go to war with each other to get some of these secrets and some are a necessity for humankind to survive the future war with the Kafers.

==Influences==
The background history of &quot;2300 AD&quot; is a continuation of the nuclear war depicted in the &quot;Twilight 2000&quot; role-playing game by the same company. A custom strategy game called &quot;The Great Game&quot; was used by the authors to develop the background history for &quot;2300 AD&quot;.

A Cyberpunk element was added to the game with the publication of the &quot;Earth/Cybertech Sourcebook&quot; and two adventures for the same, &quot;Deathwatch&quot; and &quot;Rotten to the Core&quot;. GDW catalogs began to present the game as &quot;2300 AD - the Cyberpunk game of a Dark Gritty Future&quot; although this genre was never expressed in the core materials. The &quot;Earth/Cybertech Sourcebook&quot; states that Cyberpunk can be a fringe element in any society, its members being cyberpunks by self-definition.

==Reception==
In Issue 36 of &quot;Casus Belli&quot;, Pierre Lejoyeux reviewed the 1st edition &quot;Traveller: 2300&quot; game, and was completely mystified as to why GDW would publish two unrelated games with similar titles, fearing that GDW was trying to replace the old game with the new game. &quot;Will they consign &quot;Traveller&quot; to oblivion by releasing a new game of the same inspiration?&quot; he asked. &quot;Why make the two games incompatible, condemning the many &quot;Traveller&quot; supplements published to date to dust?&quot;

In the March 1987 edition of &quot;Adventurer&quot;, James Chapple called &quot;Traveller 2300&quot; a better introduction to science fiction role-playing than its predecessor &quot;Traveller&quot; because the setting was closer to modern-day Earth. He thought the equipment and weapons included in the rules were &quot;well thought out and reflect the beginnings of a high-tech civilisation.&quot; However, he found that the &quot;Referee&#x27;s Book&quot; &quot;is where the complications set in.&quot; He called the overarching Task Resolution system &quot;probably the most generic rule I have ever seen&quot; and said the simplicity of the rules suggested this game was aimed at a younger audience who found the rules to &quot;Traveller&quot; too complicated. He also found three major errors in the rules that he felt should have been caught through better playtesting and editing. He concluded &quot;Overall the game is well-produced and set out [...] Apart from the apparent errors I have found, the game seems well-balanced.&quot; 

In Issue 4 of &quot;Third Imperium&quot;, Mike Jackson thought that the game had potential, &quot;but that may be all it has.&quot; He found the rules &quot;confusing and difficult to understand on the first read&quot;, and found the game overall &quot;poorly balanced and very incomplete.&quot; He pointed out that a quarter of the book is taken up by historical background, &quot;while so much is left out.&quot; He also questioned the priorities of the authors, who only included 30 pieces of equipment but spent a lot of that space on four types of satellites and organic contact lenses. He also noted that although several alien species are mentioned, they are not described. He concluded, &quot;if you like detailed background and don&#x27;t mind filling in major gaps in rules, &quot;Traveller: 2300&quot; is the game for you.&quot;

In Issue 7 of &quot;The Games Machine&quot; John Woods briefly reviewed the original &quot;Traveller 2300&quot; game and was impressed by the &quot;strikingly simple rules system&quot;, concluding &quot;My first impressions are favourable.&quot; Four issues later, in a full-length review, Woods was still impressed by the setting and detail, but felt that after an in-depth examination, the game was badly let down by the rules system. He was especially disappointed in the Task resolution system, which he felt was overly simplistic, pointing out that if the players decide to try something that falls outside of the few examples given, &quot;it is up to the referee to determine an appropriate Task, or set of Tasks, and to choose the difficulty numbers and so on for them [...] which makes life difficult until the referee has had a fair amount of practice with the system.&quot; He concluded with ambivalence, saying, &quot;GDW have produced an excellent and entertaining universe for near-future star-hopping adventure. With the various supplements available, the &quot;Traveller 2300&quot; world is as well-detailed and as much fun as any you can play. But its rules system is something of a let-down.&quot; 

In the May 1987 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (Issue #89), Jim Bambra reviewed the original &quot;Traveller 2300&quot; game, and found the rules &quot;somewhat tedious reading&quot;. Having slogged through the rules, he found much to recommend the game, including the character generation system, the skill system, and combat — although he found combat slow compared to the skill system. Bambra felt the starship combat system was &quot;not as good as it could have been... Space combat does not flow very well and is potentially very fiddly once the missiles are flying.&quot; Bambra also noted the lack of scenarios, saying, &quot;There is very little information about adventures&quot;, pointing out that even in the provided adventure, &quot;vast chunks are left for the GM to develop — a daunting task for most.&quot; Bambra concluded, &quot;I would prefer simpler mechanics and a more exciting background.&quot;

Bambra also reviewed &quot;Traveller 2300&quot; in the March 1988 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 131), and to the points he had made in &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, Bambra also criticized the lack of an experience point system — unlike &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, where characters advance in skills and powers through their experiences, &quot;A character can survive for years in this game, but he does not improve with age or experience; he stays the same forever. Sure, the PC can get more hardware, more influence, and so on, but he never gets any better at solving tasks.&quot; Bambra again emphasized the lack of scenarios, and also the lack of examples in the rules to provide clarity, concluding, &quot;Experienced GMs will have few problems with the game&#x27;s less-than-satisfactory handling of adventure staging and description, but novices should look elsewhere for their first science-fiction RPG.&quot;

A year later, in the May 1989 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 145), Jim Bambra had a chance to revisit the game with the publication of the updated &quot;2300 AD&quot;, successor to &quot;Traveller 2300&quot;. Bambra found much to like in the new version of the game, including the upgrade from 96 pages of rules and background in the original setting to 208 pages in the revised setting. Bambra found the new rules for &quot;2300 AD&quot; were better organized and had a much more professional layout than the previous version. He also found the sections demonstrating the game to new gamemasters to be very helpful. Bambra concluded with a positive recommendation: &quot;The 2300 AD game is a greatly welcomed development. With its new and improved presentation, revised and expanded rules and background, more dynamic feel, and extensive range of support products, the 2300 AD game can truly be called a state-of-the-art science-fiction role-playing game. I recommend it highly to anyone looking for a game of hard science-fiction that pulls no punches and delivers the goods in a highly satisfying manner. In bringing out the 2300 AD game, GDW has come up trumps and made a good game into a great one.&quot;

Rick Swan reviewed the original &quot;Traveller: 2300&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 79. Swan commented that &quot;&quot;Traveller: 2300&quot; is not as good as &quot;Twilight: 2000&quot; and is a distant third behind the original &quot;Traveller&quot;, although admittedly those games are tough acts to follow.&quot;

Steve Wieck reviewed &quot;2300 AD&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #13 (December 1988), rating it a 3 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Overall, 2300AD is game for true sci-fi fans who are looking for role-playing in a realistic human civilization of the future.&quot;

Three years later, in his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, Swan found that &quot;Traveller:2300&quot; came a distant third behind other notable post-apocalyptic role-playing games published by GDW, &quot;&quot; and &quot;MegaTraveller&quot;. Although Swan found the character creation rules &quot;elegant&quot;, he found the task-resolution system &quot;both awkward and ambiguous&quot; and combat &quot;likewise complicated.&quot; Swan concluded by giving this game a rating of 2.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;&quot;Traveller: 2300&quot; isn&#x27;t a bad game, it&#x27;s just an unnecessary one.&quot; 

In the same book, Swan reviewed the revised game &quot;2300 AD&quot; and pegged its rating at a solid 3 out of 4, saying, &quot;Helpful sections on running and designing adventures ... and the improved organization makes &quot;2300 AD&quot; a lot easier to learn than &quot;Traveller: 2300&quot;. [The designers] turned a fair game into a great one, an impressive accomplishment.&quot;

In a retrospective review in &quot;Shadis&quot; #28 (October 1996), Matt Staroscik remembered &quot;2300 AD&quot; favorably because of its cultural ties to present-day Earth. He also recalled that &quot;All of the weapons and starships have a realistic feel, and the uses they project for biotechnology especially are fantastic.&quot; Overall, he thought the game provided an &quot;atmosphere of gritty realism, and that&#x27;s what I, at least, am after in SF.&quot; 

In a 1996 reader pool conducted by the British games magazine &quot;Arcane&quot; to determine the top 50 role-playing games, &quot;2300 AD&quot; was ranked 50th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;The realistic science and technology leads to a gritty, realistic feel. Perhaps one of the best alien species ever created for an RPG, the Kafers are truly alien, with a unique physiology, psychology and society.&quot;

James Davis Nicoll in 2020 for &quot;Black Gate&quot; said &quot;&quot;T2300&quot; had many interesting features: alien aliens, an attempt to provide a hard SF RPG, and most notably the Near Star map, which did its best to provide a three dimensional map of the stars within 50 light years of the Solar System. It also had... issues, from the confusing product name to playtest/proofreading issues that meant that as &quot;written&quot;, nine in ten characters were permanently comatose. Thus the 1988 second edition, renamed, polished, and expanded. As I recall, GDW even allowed people with the first edition to swap the original box set for the second edition rather than making them pay for the same game twice.&quot;

<text>Copenhagen Free University (CFU, ) is an artist-run communist collective established in May 2001 in Copenhagen, Denmark, although it is not an accredited institution of higher learning. It considers itself as part of the international Situationist movement in collaboration with other like-minded organizations.

The CFU committee comprises artists Henrietta Heise and Jakob Jakobsen, its founders.

The CFU has a guide called &quot;The ABZ of the Copenhagen Free University&quot; with entries ranging from &quot;self-institution&quot; through &quot;uneconomical behaviour&quot; to &quot;mass intellectuality&quot;. It publishes small books and brochures, as well as hosting discussions, conferences, and screenings. One of its publications is a research paper called &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Situationists&quot;, documenting the influence of the Situationist International in Denmark.

The CFU also helps to run an artist-run television service named TV-TV, broadcast from a squat in Copenhagen (named &quot;Folkets Hus&quot; — People&#x27;s House) three nights per week in airtime slots that used to be occupied by TV STop, using TV Stop&#x27;s equipment. TV-TV&#x27;s content is usually experimental, and its stated aim is to not be like mainstream television.

<text>In number theory, a Wieferich prime is a prime number &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;p&quot;2 divides , therefore connecting these primes with Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, which states that every odd prime &quot;p&quot; divides . Wieferich primes were first described by Arthur Wieferich in 1909 in works pertaining to Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, at which time both of Fermat&#x27;s theorems were already well known to mathematicians.

Since then, connections between Wieferich primes and various other topics in mathematics have been discovered, including other types of numbers and primes, such as Mersenne and Fermat numbers, specific types of pseudoprimes and some types of numbers generalized from the original definition of a Wieferich prime. Over time, those connections discovered have extended to cover more properties of certain prime numbers as well as more general subjects such as number fields and the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture.

, the only known Wieferich primes are 1093 and 3511 .

== Equivalent definitions ==
The stronger version of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, which a Wieferich prime satisfies, is usually expressed as a congruence relation . From the definition of the congruence relation on integers, it follows that this property is equivalent to the definition given at the beginning. Thus if a prime &quot;p&quot; satisfies this congruence, this prime divides the Fermat quotient formula_1. The following are two illustrative examples using the primes 11 and 1093:
: For &quot;p&quot; = 11, we get formula_2 which is 93 and leaves a remainder of 5 after division by 11, hence 11 is not a Wieferich prime. For &quot;p&quot; = 1093, we get formula_3 or 485439490310...852893958515 (302 intermediate digits omitted for clarity), which leaves a remainder of 0 after division by 1093 and thus 1093 is a Wieferich prime.

Wieferich primes can be defined by other equivalent congruences. If &quot;p&quot; is a Wieferich prime, one can multiply both sides of the congruence by 2 to get . Raising both sides of the congruence to the power &quot;p&quot; shows that a Wieferich prime also satisfies , and hence for all . The converse is also true: for some implies that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo &quot;p&quot;2 divides gcd, φ, that is, and thus &quot;p&quot; is a Wieferich prime. This also implies that Wieferich primes can be defined as primes &quot;p&quot; such that the multiplicative orders of 2 modulo &quot;p&quot; and modulo &quot;p&quot;2 coincide: , (By the way, ord10932 = 364, and ord35112 = 1755).

H. S. Vandiver proved that if and only if formula_4.

== History and search status ==
In 1902, Meyer proved a theorem about solutions of the congruence &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; − 1 ≡ 1 (mod &quot;p&quot;&quot;r&quot;). Later in that decade Arthur Wieferich showed specifically that if the first case of Fermat&#x27;s last theorem has solutions for an odd prime exponent, then that prime must satisfy that congruence for &quot;a&quot; = 2 and &quot;r&quot; = 2. In other words, if there exist solutions to &quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot; + &quot;y&quot;&quot;p&quot; + &quot;z&quot;&quot;p&quot; = 0 in integers &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; and &quot;p&quot; an odd prime with &quot;p&quot; ∤ &quot;xyz&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; satisfies 2&quot;p&quot; − 1 ≡ 1 (mod &quot;p&quot;2). In 1913, Bachmann examined the residues of formula_5. He asked the question when this residue vanishes and tried to find expressions for answering this question.

The prime 1093 was found to be a Wieferich prime by in 1913 and confirmed to be the only such prime below 2000. He calculated the smallest residue of formula_6 for all primes &quot;p&quot; &lt; 2000 and found this residue to be zero for &quot;t&quot; = 364 and &quot;p&quot; = 1093, thereby providing a counterexample to a conjecture by Grave about the impossibility of the Wieferich congruence. later ordered verification of the correctness of Meissner&#x27;s congruence via only elementary calculations. Inspired by an earlier work of Euler, he simplified Meissner&#x27;s proof by showing that 10932 | (2182 + 1) and remarked that (2182 + 1) is a factor of (2364 − 1). It was also shown that it is possible to prove that 1093 is a Wieferich prime without using complex numbers contrary to the method used by Meissner, although Meissner himself hinted at that he was aware of a proof without complex values.

The prime 3511 was first found to be a Wieferich prime by N. G. W. H. Beeger in 1922 and another proof of it being a Wieferich prime was published in 1965 by Guy. In 1960, Kravitz doubled a previous record set by and in 1961 Riesel extended the search to 500000 with the aid of BESK. Around 1980, Lehmer was able to reach the search limit of 6. This limit was extended to over 2.5 in 2006, finally reaching 3. Eventually, it was shown that if any other Wieferich primes exist, they must be greater than 6.7.

In 2007–2016, a search for Wieferich primes was performed by the distributed computing project Wieferich@Home. In 2011–2017, another search was performed by the PrimeGrid project, although later the work done in this project was claimed wasted. While these projects reached search bounds above 1, neither of them reported any sustainable results.

In 2020, PrimeGrid started another project that searched for Wieferich and Wall–Sun–Sun primes simultaneously. The new project used checksums to enable independent double-checking of each subinterval, thus minimizing the risk of missing an instance because of faulty hardware. The project ended in December 2022, definitely proving that a third Wieferich prime must exceed 264 (about 18).

It has been conjectured (as for Wilson primes) that infinitely many Wieferich primes exist, and that the number of Wieferich primes below &quot;x&quot; is approximately log(log(&quot;x&quot;)), which is a heuristic result that follows from the plausible assumption that for a prime &quot;p&quot;, the degree roots of unity modulo &quot;p&quot;2 are uniformly distributed in the multiplicative group of integers modulo &quot;p&quot;2.

== Properties ==

=== Connection with Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem ===

The following theorem connecting Wieferich primes and Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem was proven by Wieferich in 1909:

:Let &quot;p&quot; be prime, and let &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; be integers such that . Furthermore, assume that &quot;p&quot; does not divide the product &quot;xyz&quot;. Then &quot;p&quot; is a Wieferich prime.

The above case (where &quot;p&quot; does not divide any of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; or &quot;z&quot;) is commonly known as the first case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem (FLTI) and FLTI is said to fail for a prime &quot;p&quot;, if solutions to the Fermat equation exist for that &quot;p&quot;, otherwise FLTI holds for &quot;p&quot;.
In 1910, Mirimanoff expanded the theorem by showing that, if the preconditions of the theorem hold true for some prime &quot;p&quot;, then &quot;p&quot;2 must also divide . Granville and Monagan further proved that &quot;p&quot;2 must actually divide for every prime &quot;m&quot; ≤ 89. Suzuki extended the proof to all primes &quot;m&quot; ≤ 113.

Let &quot;Hp&quot; be a set of pairs of integers with 1 as their greatest common divisor, &quot;p&quot; being prime to &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;, (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;)&quot;p&quot;−1 ≡ 1 (mod p2), (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;ξy&quot;) being the &quot;p&quot;th power of an ideal of &quot;K&quot; with &quot;ξ&quot; defined as cos 2&quot;π&quot;/&quot;p&quot; + &quot;i&quot; sin 2&quot;π&quot;/&quot;p&quot;. &quot;K&quot; = Q(&quot;ξ&quot;) is the field extension obtained by adjoining all polynomials in the algebraic number &quot;ξ&quot; to the field of rational numbers (such an extension is known as a number field or in this particular case, where &quot;ξ&quot; is a root of unity, a cyclotomic number field).
From uniqueness of factorization of ideals in Q(ξ) it follows that if the first case of Fermat&#x27;s last theorem has solutions &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; then &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot;+&quot;z&quot; and (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), (&quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) and (&quot;z&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) are elements of &quot;Hp&quot;.
Granville and Monagan showed that (1, 1) ∈ &quot;Hp&quot; if and only if &quot;p&quot; is a Wieferich prime.

=== Connection with the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture and non-Wieferich primes ===

A non-Wieferich prime is a prime &quot;p&quot; satisfying . J. H. Silverman showed in 1988 that if the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture holds, then there exist infinitely many non-Wieferich primes. More precisely he showed that the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture implies the existence of a constant only depending on &quot;α&quot; such that the number of non-Wieferich primes to base &quot;α&quot; with &quot;p&quot; less than or equal to a variable &quot;X&quot; is greater than log(&quot;X&quot;) as &quot;X&quot; goes to infinity. Numerical evidence suggests that very few of the prime numbers in a given interval are Wieferich primes. The set of Wieferich primes and the set of non-Wieferich primes, sometimes denoted by &quot;W2&quot; and &quot;W2c&quot; respectively, are complementary sets, so if one of them is shown to be finite, the other one would necessarily have to be infinite. It was later shown that the existence of infinitely many non-Wieferich primes already follows from a weaker version of the &quot;abc&quot; conjecture, called the &quot;ABC&quot;-(&quot;k&quot;, &quot;ε&quot;) &quot;conjecture&quot;. Additionally, the existence of infinitely many non-Wieferich primes would also follow if there exist infinitely many square-free Mersenne numbers as well as if there exists a real number &quot;ξ&quot; such that the set {&quot;n&quot; ∈ N : λ(2&quot;n&quot; − 1) &lt; 2 − &quot;ξ&quot;} is of density one, where the &quot;index of composition&quot; &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) of an integer &quot;n&quot; is defined as formula_7 and formula_8, meaning formula_9 gives the product of all prime factors of &quot;n&quot;.

=== Connection with Mersenne and Fermat primes ===

It is known that the &quot;n&quot;th Mersenne number is prime only if &quot;n&quot; is prime. Fermat&#x27;s little theorem implies that if is prime, then &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot;−1 is always divisible by &quot;p&quot;. Since Mersenne numbers of prime indices &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; and &quot;M&quot;&quot;q&quot; are co-prime,
::A prime divisor &quot;p&quot; of &quot;M&quot;&quot;q&quot;, where &quot;q&quot; is prime, is a Wieferich prime if and only if &quot;p&quot;2 divides &quot;M&quot;&quot;q&quot;.
Thus, a Mersenne prime cannot also be a Wieferich prime. A notable open problem is to determine whether or not all Mersenne numbers of prime index are square-free. If &quot;q&quot; is prime and the Mersenne number &quot;M&quot;&quot;q&quot; is &quot;not&quot; square-free, that is, there exists a prime &quot;p&quot; for which &quot;p&quot;2 divides &quot;M&quot;&quot;q&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; is a Wieferich prime. Therefore, if there are only finitely many Wieferich primes, then there will be at most finitely many Mersenne numbers with prime index that are not square-free. Rotkiewicz showed a related result: if there are infinitely many square-free Mersenne numbers, then there are infinitely many non-Wieferich primes.

Similarly, if &quot;p&quot; is prime and &quot;p&quot;2 divides some Fermat number &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; , then &quot;p&quot; must be a Wieferich prime.

In fact, there exists a natural number &quot;n&quot; and a prime &quot;p&quot; that &quot;p&quot;2 divides formula_10 (where formula_11 is the &quot;n&quot;-th cyclotomic polynomial) if and only if &quot;p&quot; is a Wieferich prime. For example, 10932 divides formula_12, 35112 divides formula_13. Mersenne and Fermat numbers are just special situations of formula_10. Thus, if 1093 and 3511 are only two Wieferich primes, then all formula_10 are square-free except formula_12 and formula_13 (In fact, when there exists a prime &quot;p&quot; which &quot;p&quot;2 divides some formula_10, then it is a Wieferich prime); and clearly, if formula_10 is a prime, then it cannot be Wieferich prime. (Any odd prime &quot;p&quot; divides only one formula_10 and &quot;n&quot; divides , and if and only if the period length of 1/p in binary is &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; divides formula_10. Besides, if and only if &quot;p&quot; is a Wieferich prime, then the period length of 1/p and 1/p2 are the same (in binary). Otherwise, this is &quot;p&quot; times than that.)

For the primes 1093 and 3511, it was shown that neither of them is a divisor of any Mersenne number with prime index nor a divisor of any Fermat number, because 364 and 1755 are neither prime nor powers of 2.

=== Connection with other equations ===

Scott and Styer showed that the equation &quot;p&quot;x – 2y = &quot;d&quot; has at most one solution in positive integers (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), unless when &quot;p&quot;4 | 2ord&quot;p&quot; 2 – 1 if &quot;p&quot; ≢ 65 (mod 192) or unconditionally when &quot;p&quot;2 | 2ord&quot;p&quot; 2 – 1, where ord&quot;p&quot; 2 denotes the multiplicative order of 2 modulo &quot;p&quot;. They also showed that a solution to the equation ±&quot;a&quot;&quot;x&quot;1 ± 2&quot;y&quot;1 = ±&quot;a&quot;&quot;x&quot;2 ± 2&quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;c&quot; must be from a specific set of equations but that this does not hold, if &quot;a&quot; is a Wieferich prime greater than 1.25 x 1015.

=== Binary periodicity of &quot;p&quot; − 1 ===

Johnson observed that the two known Wieferich primes are one greater than numbers with periodic binary expansions (1092 = 0100010001002=44416; 3510 = 1101101101102=66668). The Wieferich@Home project searched for Wieferich primes by testing numbers that are one greater than a number with a periodic binary expansion, but up to a &quot;bit pseudo-length&quot; of 3500 of the tested binary numbers generated by combination of bit strings with a bit length of up to 24 it has not found a new Wieferich prime.

=== Abundancy of &quot;p&quot; − 1 ===

It has been noted that the known Wieferich primes are one greater than mutually friendly numbers (the shared abundancy index being 112/39).

=== Connection with pseudoprimes ===

It was observed that the two known Wieferich primes are the square factors of all non-square free base-2 Fermat pseudoprimes up to 25. Later computations showed that the only repeated factors of the pseudoprimes up to 1012 are 1093 and 3511. In addition, the following connection exists:
:Let &quot;n&quot; be a base 2 pseudoprime and &quot;p&quot; be a prime divisor of &quot;n&quot;. If formula_22, then also formula_23. Furthermore, if &quot;p&quot; is a Wieferich prime, then &quot;p&quot;2 is a Catalan pseudoprime.

=== Connection with directed graphs ===

For all primes up to , only in two cases: and , where is the number of vertices in the cycle of 1 in the &quot;doubling diagram&quot; modulo . Here the doubling diagram represents the directed graph with the non-negative integers less than &quot;m&quot; as vertices and with directed edges going from each vertex &quot;x&quot; to vertex 2&quot;x&quot; reduced modulo &quot;m&quot;. It was shown, that for all odd prime numbers either or .

=== Properties related to number fields ===

It was shown that formula_24 and formula_25 if and only if where &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime and formula_26 is the fundamental discriminant of the imaginary quadratic field formula_27. Furthermore, the following was shown: Let &quot;p&quot; be a Wieferich prime. If , let formula_26 be the fundamental discriminant of the imaginary quadratic field formula_29 and if , let formula_26 be the fundamental discriminant of the imaginary quadratic field formula_31. Then formula_24 and formula_25 (&quot;χ&quot; and &quot;λ&quot; in this context denote Iwasawa invariants).

Furthermore, the following result was obtained: Let &quot;q&quot; be an odd prime number, &quot;k&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are primes such that and the order of &quot;q&quot; modulo &quot;k&quot; is formula_34. Assume that &quot;q&quot; divides &quot;h&quot;+, the class number of the real cyclotomic field formula_35, the cyclotomic field obtained by adjoining the sum of a &quot;p&quot;-th root of unity and its reciprocal to the field of rational numbers. Then &quot;q&quot; is a Wieferich prime. This also holds if the conditions and are replaced by and as well as when the condition is replaced by (in which case &quot;q&quot; is a Wall–Sun–Sun prime) and the incongruence condition replaced by .

== Generalizations ==

=== Near-Wieferich primes ===
A prime &quot;p&quot; satisfying the congruence 2(&quot;p&quot;−1)/2 (mod &quot;p&quot;2) with small |&quot;A&quot;| is commonly called a &quot;near-Wieferich prime&quot; . Near-Wieferich primes with &quot;A&quot; = 0 represent Wieferich primes. Recent searches, in addition to their primary search for Wieferich primes, also tried to find near-Wieferich primes. The following table lists all near-Wieferich primes with |&quot;A&quot;| ≤ 10 in the interval [1, 3]. This search bound was reached in 2006 in a search effort by P. Carlisle, R. Crandall and M. Rodenkirch. Bigger entries are by PrimeGrid.
The sign +1 or -1 above can be easily predicted by Euler&#x27;s criterion (and the second supplement to the law of quadratic reciprocity).

Dorais and Klyve used a different definition of a near-Wieferich prime, defining it as a prime &quot;p&quot; with small value of formula_36 where formula_37 is the Fermat quotient of 2 with respect to &quot;p&quot; modulo &quot;p&quot; (the modulo operation here gives the residue with the smallest absolute value). The following table lists all primes &quot;p&quot; ≤ with formula_38.

The two notions of nearness are related as follows. If formula_39, then by squaring, clearly formula_40. So if had been chosen with formula_41 small, then clearly formula_42 is also (quite) small, and an even number. However, when formula_43 is odd above, the related from before the last squaring was not &quot;small&quot;. For example, with formula_44, we have formula_45 which reads extremely non-near, but after squaring this is formula_46 which is a near-Wieferich by the second definition.

=== Base-&quot;a&quot; Wieferich primes ===

A &quot;Wieferich prime base a&quot; is a prime &quot;p&quot; that satisfies
: , with &quot;a&quot; less than &quot;p&quot; but greater than 1.
Such a prime cannot divide &quot;a&quot;, since then it would also divide 1.

It&#x27;s a conjecture that for every natural number &quot;a&quot;, there are infinitely many Wieferich primes in base &quot;a&quot;.

Bolyai showed that if &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are primes, &quot;a&quot; is a positive integer not divisible by &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; such that , , then . Setting &quot;p&quot; = &quot;q&quot; leads to . It was shown that if and only if .

Known solutions of for small values of &quot;a&quot; are: (checked up to 5 × 1013)

For more information, see and. (Note that the solutions to &quot;a&quot; = &quot;bk&quot; is the union of the prime divisors of &quot;k&quot; which does not divide &quot;b&quot; and the solutions to &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;)

The smallest solutions of are

:2, 1093, 11, 1093, 2, 66161, 5, 3, 2, 3, 71, 2693, 2, 29, 29131, 1093, 2, 5, 3, 281, 2, 13, 13, 5, 2, 3, 11, 3, 2, 7, 7, 5, 2, 46145917691, 3, 66161, 2, 17, 8039, 11, 2, 23, 5, 3, 2, 3, ... (The next term &gt; 4.9×1013) 

There are no known solutions of for &quot;n&quot; = 47, 72, 186, 187, 200, 203, 222, 231, 304, 311, 335, 355, 435, 454, 546, 554, 610, 639, 662, 760, 772, 798, 808, 812, 858, 860, 871, 983, 986, 1002, 1023, 1130, 1136, 1138, ...

It is a conjecture that there are infinitely many solutions of for every natural number &quot;a&quot;.

The bases &quot;b&quot; &lt; &quot;p&quot;2 which &quot;p&quot; is a Wieferich prime are (for &quot;b&quot; &gt; &quot;p&quot;2, the solutions are just shifted by &quot;k&quot;·&quot;p&quot;2 for &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0), and there are solutions &lt; &quot;p&quot;2 of &quot;p&quot; and the set of the solutions congruent to &quot;p&quot; are {1, 2, 3, ..., 

The least base &quot;b&quot; &gt; 1 which prime(&quot;n&quot;) is a Wieferich prime are
:5, 8, 7, 18, 3, 19, 38, 28, 28, 14, 115, 18, 51, 19, 53, 338, 53, 264, 143, 11, 306, 31, 99, 184, 53, 181, 43, 164, 96, 68, 38, 58, 19, 328, 313, 78, 226, 65, 253, 259, 532, 78, 176, 276, 143, 174, 165, 69, 330, 44, 33, 332, 94, 263, 48, 79, 171, 747, 731, 20, ... 

We can also consider the formula formula_47, (because of the generalized Fermat little theorem, formula_47 is true for all prime &quot;p&quot; and all natural number &quot;a&quot; such that both &quot;a&quot; and are not divisible by &quot;p&quot;). It&#x27;s a conjecture that for every natural number &quot;a&quot;, there are infinitely many primes such that formula_47.

Known solutions for small &quot;a&quot; are: (checked up to 4 × 1011) 

=== Wieferich pairs ===

A Wieferich pair is a pair of primes &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; that satisfy
: &quot;p&quot;&quot;q&quot; − 1 ≡ 1 (mod &quot;q&quot;2) and &quot;q&quot;&quot;p&quot; − 1 ≡ 1 (mod &quot;p&quot;2)
so that a Wieferich prime &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 4) will form such a pair (&quot;p&quot;, 2): the only known instance in this case is . There are only 7 known Wieferich pairs.

: (2, 1093), (3, 1006003), (5, 1645333507), (5, 188748146801), (83, 4871), (911, 318917), and (2903, 18787) (sequence in OEIS)

=== Wieferich sequence ===

Start with a(1) any natural number (&gt;1), a(&quot;n&quot;) = the smallest prime &quot;p&quot; such that (a(&quot;n&quot; − 1))&quot;p&quot; − 1 = 1 (mod &quot;p&quot;2) but &quot;p&quot;2 does not divide a(&quot;n&quot; − 1) − 1 or a(&quot;n&quot; − 1) + 1. (If &quot;p&quot;2 divides a(&quot;n&quot; − 1) − 1 or a(&quot;n&quot; − 1) + 1, then the solution is a trivial solution) It is a conjecture that every natural number &quot;k&quot; = a(1) &gt; 1 makes this sequence become periodic, for example, let a(1) = 2: 

:2, 1093, 5, 20771, 18043, 5, 20771, 18043, 5, ..., it gets a cycle: {5, 20771, 18043}.

Let a(1) = 83: 

:83, 4871, 83, 4871, 83, 4871, 83, ..., it gets a cycle: {83, 4871}.

Let a(1) = 59 (a longer sequence):

:59, 2777, 133287067, 13, 863, 7, 5, 20771, 18043, 5, ..., it also gets 5.

However, there are many values of a(1) with unknown status, for example, let a(1) = 3:

:3, 11, 71, 47, ? (There are no known Wieferich primes in base 47).

Let a(1) = 14:

:14, 29, ? (There are no known Wieferich prime in base 29 except 2, but 22 = 4 divides 29 − 1 = 28)

Let a(1) = 39 (a longer sequence):
:39, 8039, 617, 101, 1050139, 29, ? (It also gets 29)

It is unknown that values for a(1) &gt; 1 exist such that the resulting sequence does not eventually become periodic.

When a(&quot;n&quot; − 1)=&quot;k&quot;, a(&quot;n&quot;) will be (start with &quot;k&quot; = 2): 1093, 11, 1093, 20771, 66161, 5, 1093, 11, 487, 71, 2693, 863, 29, 29131, 1093, 46021, 5, 7, 281, ?, 13, 13, 25633, 20771, 71, 11, 19, ?, 7, 7, 5, 233, 46145917691, 1613, 66161, 77867, 17, 8039, 11, 29, 23, 5, 229, 1283, 829, ?, 257, 491531, ?, ... (For &quot;k&quot; = 21, 29, 47, 50, even the next value is unknown)

=== Wieferich numbers ===
A Wieferich number is an odd natural number &quot;n&quot; satisfying the congruence 2(&quot;n&quot;) ≡ 1 (mod &quot;n&quot;2), where denotes the Euler&#x27;s totient function (according to Euler&#x27;s theorem, 2(&quot;n&quot;) ≡ 1 (mod &quot;n&quot;) for every odd natural number &quot;n&quot;). If Wieferich number &quot;n&quot; is prime, then it is a Wieferich prime. The first few Wieferich numbers are:
:1, 1093, 3279, 3511, 7651, 10533, 14209, 17555, 22953, 31599, 42627, 45643, 52665, 68859, 94797, 99463, ... 
It can be shown that if there are only finitely many Wieferich primes, then there are only finitely many Wieferich numbers. In particular, if the only Wieferich primes are 1093 and 3511, then there exist exactly 104 Wieferich numbers, which matches the number of Wieferich numbers currently known.

More generally, a natural number &quot;n&quot; is a Wieferich number to base &quot;a&quot;, if &quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) ≡ 1 (mod &quot;n&quot;2).

Another definition specifies a Wieferich number as odd natural number &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;n&quot; and formula_50 are not coprime, where &quot;m&quot; is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo &quot;n&quot;. The first of these numbers are:
:21, 39, 55, 57, 105, 111, 147, 155, 165, 171, 183, 195, 201, 203, 205, 219, 231, 237, 253, 273, 285, 291, 301, 305, 309, 327, 333, 355, 357, 385, 399, ... 
As above, if Wieferich number &quot;q&quot; is prime, then it is a Wieferich prime.

=== Weak Wieferich prime ===
A weak Wieferich prime to base &quot;a&quot; is a prime &quot;p&quot; satisfies the condition
:&quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; ≡ &quot;a&quot; (mod &quot;p&quot;2)

Every Wieferich prime to base &quot;a&quot; is also a weak Wieferich prime to base &quot;a&quot;. If the base &quot;a&quot; is squarefree, then a prime &quot;p&quot; is a weak Wieferich prime to base &quot;a&quot; if and only if &quot;p&quot; is a Wieferich prime to base &quot;a&quot;.

Smallest weak Wieferich prime to base &quot;n&quot; are (start with &quot;n&quot; = 0)
:2, 2, 1093, 11, 2, 2, 66161, 5, 2, 2, 3, 71, 2, 2, 29, 29131, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 13, 13, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 7, 7, 2, 2, 46145917691, 3, 2, 2, 17, 8039, 2, 2, 23, 5, 2, 2, 3, ...

=== Wieferich prime with order &quot;n&quot; ===
For integer &quot;n&quot; ≥2, a Wieferich prime to base &quot;a&quot; with order &quot;n&quot; is a prime &quot;p&quot; satisfies the condition
:&quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot;−1 ≡ 1 (mod &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;)

Clearly, a Wieferich prime to base &quot;a&quot; with order &quot;n&quot; is also a Wieferich prime to base &quot;a&quot; with order &quot;m&quot; for all 2 ≤ &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, and Wieferich prime to base &quot;a&quot; with order 2 is equivalent to Wieferich prime to base &quot;a&quot;, so we can only consider the &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3 case. However, there are no known Wieferich prime to base 2 with order 3. The first base with known Wieferich prime with order 3 is 9, where 2 is a Wieferich prime to base 9 with order 3. Besides, both 5 and 113 are Wieferich prime to base 68 with order 3.

=== Lucas–Wieferich primes ===
Let &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; be integers. The Lucas sequence of the first kind associated with the pair (&quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;) is defined by
:formula_51
for all formula_52. A Lucas–Wieferich prime associated with (&quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;) is a prime &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;U&quot;&quot;p&quot;−&quot;ε&quot;(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;) ≡ 0 (mod &quot;p&quot;2), where &quot;ε&quot; equals the Legendre symbol formula_53. All Wieferich primes are Lucas–Wieferich primes associated with the pair (3, 2).

=== Wieferich places ===
Let &quot;K&quot; be a global field, i.e. a number field or a function field in one variable over a finite field and let &quot;E&quot; be an elliptic curve. If &quot;v&quot; is a non-archimedean place of norm &quot;qv&quot; of &quot;K&quot; and a ∈ K, with &quot;v&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = 0 then ≥ 1. &quot;v&quot; is called a &quot;Wieferich place&quot; for base &quot;a&quot;, if &gt; 1, an &quot;elliptic Wieferich place&quot; for base &quot;P&quot; ∈ &quot;E&quot;, if &quot;NvP&quot; ∈ &quot;E&quot;2 and a &quot;strong elliptic Wieferich place&quot; for base &quot;P&quot; ∈ &quot;E&quot; if &quot;nvP&quot; ∈ &quot;E&quot;2, where &quot;nv&quot; is the order of &quot;P&quot; modulo &quot;v&quot; and &quot;Nv&quot; gives the number of rational points (over the residue field of &quot;v&quot;) of the reduction of &quot;E&quot; at &quot;v&quot;.

<text>The Wollaston Medal is a scientific award for geology and the highest award granted by the Geological Society of London, the oldest geological society in the world. The medal is named after William Hyde Wollaston, and was first awarded in 1831. It was originally made of gold (1831–1845), then palladium, a metal discovered by Wollaston (1846–1860). It was switched to gold again from 1861 to 1929, and then back to palladium from 1930 to present.

<text>In number theory, a Wilson prime is a prime number formula_1 such that formula_2 divides formula_3, where &quot;formula_4&quot; denotes the factorial function; compare this with Wilson&#x27;s theorem, which states that every prime formula_1 divides formula_3. Both are named for 18th-century English mathematician John Wilson; in 1770, Edward Waring credited the theorem to Wilson, although it had been stated centuries earlier by Ibn al-Haytham.

The only known Wilson primes are 5, 13, and 563 . Costa et al. write that &quot;the case formula_7 is trivial&quot;, and credit the observation that 13 is a Wilson prime to . Early work on these numbers included searches by N. G. W. H. Beeger and Emma Lehmer, but 563 was not discovered until the early 1950s, when computer searches could be applied to the problem. If any others exist, they must be greater than 2 × 1013. It has been conjectured that infinitely many Wilson primes exist, and that the number of Wilson primes in an interval formula_8 is about formula_9.

Several computer searches have been done in the hope of finding new Wilson primes.
The Ibercivis distributed computing project includes a search for Wilson primes. Another search was coordinated at the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search forum.

==Generalizations==

===Wilson primes of order ===
Wilson&#x27;s theorem can be expressed in general as formula_10 for every integer formula_11 and prime formula_12. Generalized Wilson primes of order are the primes such that formula_2 divides formula_14.

It was conjectured that for every natural number , there are infinitely many Wilson primes of order .

The smallest generalized Wilson primes of order formula_15 are:
===Near-Wilson primes===

A prime formula_1 satisfying the congruence formula_17 with small formula_18 can be called a near-Wilson prime. Near-Wilson primes with formula_19 are bona fide Wilson primes. The table on the right lists all such primes with formula_20 from up to 4.

===Wilson numbers===
A Wilson number is a natural number formula_15 such that formula_22, where formula_23and where the formula_24 term is positive if and only if formula_15 has a primitive root and negative otherwise. For every natural number formula_15, formula_27 is divisible by formula_15, and the quotients (called generalized Wilson quotients) are listed in . The Wilson numbers are
If a Wilson number formula_15 is prime, then formula_15 is a Wilson prime. There are 13 Wilson numbers up to 5.

<doc id="323649" wikidata="Q467477" url="?curid=323649" title="Nikola IV Zrinski">
<text>Nikola IV Zrinski or Miklós IV Zrínyi (, ; 1507/1508 – 7 September 1566), also commonly known as Nikola Šubić Zrinski (), was a Croatian-Hungarian nobleman and general, Ban of Croatia from 1542 until 1556, royal master of the treasury from 1557 until 1566, and a descendant of the Croatian noble families Zrinski and Kurjaković. During his lifetime the Zrinski family became the most powerful noble family in the Kingdom of Croatia.

Zrinski became well known across Europe for his involvement in the Siege of Szigetvár (1566), where he heroically died stopping Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent&#x27;s advance towards Vienna. The importance of the battle was considered so great that the French clergyman and statesman Cardinal Richelieu described it as &quot;the battle that saved civilization&quot;. Zrinski came to be considered a role model of a faithful and sacrificial warrior, Christian hero as well as a national hero in both Croatia and Hungary, and is often portrayed in artworks.

==Early life==
Nikola was a Croat. He was born as one of the six children of Nikola III of the Zrinski family from the noble tribe of Šubić, and of Jelena Karlović, sister of future Croatian Ban Ivan Karlović of the Kurjaković family from the noble tribe of Gusić. His birthplace is unknown, but it is generally considered to have been Zrin Castle. The same is about his birth date, for which different primary sources give dates ranging between 1507, 1508 and 1518, but according to them and other evidence it is considered to have been in 1507 or 1508, with 1508 most often cited in scholarship.

==Activities==
Zrinski already distinguished himself in the early twenties during the Siege of Vienna in 1529, for which was awarded with a horse and golden chain. After the death of his father Nikola III in 1534, Nikola IV with older brother Ivan I inherited estates in Pounje, and they simultaneously started to fortify them as well as make contacts with the Ottomans, to whom they paid a yearly tribute like their father. However, between 1537 and 1540 they started fighting against Gazi Husrev-beg&#x27;s forces for the control of fort Dubica.
In January 1539, Zrinski murdered the Imperial Army commander Johann Katzianer at Fortress Kostajnica because Katzianer had deserted the King Ferdinand I Habsburg, had started to conspire in favor of throne contestant John Zápolya, and had cooperated with the Ottomans. During the following year, the estates of the Zrinski brothers were again attacked by the Ottomans. By June 1540, they fought the combined forces of Husrev-beg, Murat-beg Tardić and Mehmed-beg Jahjapašić, and because of a lack of sufficient help from the Austrian military, the fortress Kostajnica was temporarily lost to the Turks. Zrin Castle and Gvozdansko Castle managed to hold up, but the mining sites and others were devastated. They successfully repelled the attack however, and from that moment on the Zrinski family continuously fought against the Ottomans.

In 1541, together with his older brother Ivan I, Nikola received large possessions of the Vrana Priory in Croatia and Hungary by Ferdinand I, but with the death of his brother in the same year, he also became the only successor to the estates of the Zrinski family. In 1542, according to Antun Vramec, he saved the Imperial Army forces from defeat at the Siege of Pest by intervening with 400 Croats, for which service he was appointed Ban of Croatia, a position which held until his death in 1556. During this period he frequently went to Gvozdansko Castle in order to inspect the silver mines and the mint, like in other forts in the Pounje and Pokuplje basins. As compensation for him fighting against the Ottomans, he was granted the whole area of Međimurje (Muraköz) on 12 March 1546 by King Ferdinand I, hence the center of the Zrinski family has moved from Zrin Castle to the city of Čakovec, where he significantly rearranged the existing Čakovec Castle. In 1549 he was given the right to collect tax from the subjects by himself, and in 1561 the right to freely settle serfs on his estates.

In 1556, Zrinski won a series of victories over the Ottomans, culminating in the battle of Babócsa, and thus preventing the fall of Szigetvár. However, since he was unsatisfied with the amount of resources for defense, he voluntary withdrew from his position as Ban of Croatia. In the next year, 1557, he was titled Master of the treasury, a royal office position which he held until death, becoming once again one of the fifteen most influential persons in the Kingdom of Hungary. Additionally, he served as a captain of Croatian light cavalry (1550–1560), captain of Szigetvár and commander of the Transdanubian border from 1561 and 1563 respectively and until his death.

In 1563, on the coronation of Emperor Maximilian as king of Hungary, Zrinski attended the ceremony at the head of 3000 Croatian and Magyar mounted noblemen, in the hope of obtaining the highest dignity of Palatine, vacant by the death of Tamás Nádasdy. Some historians like Géza Pálffy consider he did manage to obtain it. In the next year, he hastened southwards to defend the frontier, and defeated the Ottomans at Szeged. In 1565, Zrinski brought a copy of the Holy Crown of Hungary to Vienna for the funeral ceremony of Ferdinand I.

==Death==
In the spring of 1566, Zrinski was located in Szigetvár, a strategic fortress for the defense of the shortest route to Vienna, when the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent went with a large army for a second attempt to conquer Vienna, but first decided to capture Szigetvár. Zrinski was informed by the new king, Maximilian II, that he could either remain or leave it to another captain, but in an April, 23rd letter, Zrinski wrote that it was his will to remain because many thousands of people depend on the fortress&#x27; survival, and he started to strategically prepare to confront the Sultan. Suleiman&#x27;s forces reached Belgrade on 27 June after a forty-nine-day march. Learning of Zrinski&#x27;s success in an attack upon a Turkish forces at Siklós in July, destroying several detachments, Suleiman decided to postpone his attack on Eger and instead attack Zrinski&#x27;s fortress at Szigetvár to eliminate him as a threat.
For over a month from 5 August to 7 September, with a small force of roughly 2,300–2,500 soldiers, mostly Croats, Zrinski heroically defended the small fortress of Szigetvár against the whole Ottoman army of over 100,000 soldiers and 300 cannons, led by Suleiman in person. They did so without reinforcements which were promised by the Hungarian–Croatian King, and against Suleiman&#x27;s offer of Croatian land to Zrinski. The siege of Szigetvár ended with every remaining member of the garrison in a desperate and suicidal charge from the fortress led by Zrinski on 7 September 1566. Suleiman also died, but from natural causes, one day before the Ottomans won the siege. As Ottoman forces had suffered heavy casualties during the siege of Szigetvár, the army only managed to additionally capture the nearby fort Babócsa before Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha withdrew the army and ended the Ottoman conquest.

According to historical sources, Zrinski decided to be dressed in a hat and nice suit rather than a helmet and armour during his final charge, and chose to have his father&#x27;s sabre in hand, so that he it could be said that he had &quot;bared all that I was judged by God&#x27;s judgment&quot;, and offered one hundred gold coins as a reward for the Ottoman soldier who cut off his head. He was shot by a Janissary with a musket in the head and chest, while by other accounts it was first by a musket in the chest and then an arrow to the head. It is considered that his head was sent by Mehmed Pasha to Budin Pasha Sokullu Mustafa, or to new Sultan Selim II, but eventually, the head was buried by son Juraj IV Zrinski, Boldizsár Batthyány and Ferenc Tahy in September 1566 at the Pauline monastery in Sveta Jelena, Šenkovec, Croatia. It is uncertain what happened to his body, it could have been burned or buried near the battlefield, but according to most sources it is considered to have been buried by former Muslim captive Mustafa Vilić from Banja Luka because he had been well treated by Zrinski.
In Međimurje County Museum in Čakovec are preserved remains of the tombstone of a member of the Zrinski family, which most probably belonged to Nikola IV, and under which his head was likely buried. Preserved in Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna are the sabre, helmet, and possibly the silk robe with decorative gold thread which were created and worn by Zrinski during the 1563 coronation of Maximilian II. They were initially collected by Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria at Ambras Castle in the 16th century.

==Marriage==
Zrinski married twice, first in 1543 with Katarina Frankopan (d. 1561) and then Eva Rosenberg (1537–1591) in 1564. Due to his marriage to Katarina Frankopan, a sister of Count Stjepan Frankopan of Ozalj (d. 1577), her vast estates, including Ozalj and part of littoral cities like Bakar, became at his disposal in 1550 due to the inheritance contract. With his marriage to Eva Rosenberg, a sister of William of Rosenberg the Burgrave of Bohemia, he managed to connect with one of the most notable Czech noble families and, according to Géza Pálffy, to the highest elite of the Kingdom of Hungary. His marriages and his service during his lifetime managed to elevate the Zrinski family to become the most powerful noble family in the Kingdom of Croatia.

===Children===
With Katarina and Eva, Zrinski had thirteen children, Ivan I, Jelena, Katarina, Juraj IV, Doroteja, Uršula, Barbara, Margareta, Magdalena, Ana, Kristofor, Nikola V, and Ivan II, of whom most notably was his successor Juraj IV Zrinski. One of the younger sons married a lady from the noble Czech Kolowrat family. According to Dóra Bobory &quot;it is possible to detect an increasingly conscious marriage policy within the Zrinski family, where all the daughters of Miklos married well, and where father himself chose his spouses wisely&quot;. Most notably, Doroteja became the wife of Boldizsár Batthyány in 1566, Katarina wife of Imre Forgách in 1576, while some other two daughters married into Thurzó family, specifically Katarina was previously (1562) married to Ferenc Thurzó being the mother of future Palatine of Hungary, György Thurzó. For some of them, Uršula, Katarina, and Doroteja is known that were educated at Güssing.

==Legacy==

Zrinski&#x27;s heroic act at the siege of Szigetvár made him a well known European Christian hero, a defender and savior of Christendom, and &quot;a model of a faithful and sacrificial warrior in the service of his ruler&quot;. He was also compared to Leonidas I. His cult of heroism was especially preserved among the Croats, Hungarians, and Slovaks. In Croatia, it also represented a symbol of Croatian identity, directed against Ottoman, Austrian and Hungarian political influence. Similarly, he gained some popularity during the Polish struggle for independence in second half of the 19th century and early 20th century. According to historians like Ágnes R. Várkonyi and Alojzije Jembrih, Zrinski had an &quot;exceptional military talent, was a successful businessman, politician with a concept, and an endlessly passionate person&quot;.

He was remembered in a first-hand report &quot;Podsjedanje i osvojenje Sigeta&quot; (1568) by Zrinski&#x27;s scribe and chamberlain Franjo Črnko, which was immediately translated in Latin by Samuel Budina and published in the same year titled &quot;Historia Sigethi, totius Sclavoniae fortissimi propugnaculi...&quot;, with the second edition (1587) edited by Petrus Albinus. It was also translated into German, Italian, Spanish and other languages. Other works include a historical epic &quot;Vazetje Sigeta grada&quot; (1584) by Brne Karnarutić, and most prominently Hungarian epic poem &quot;The Siege of Sziget&quot; (1651) by his great-grandson Nikola VII Zrinski and its partial Croatian variation &quot;Adrianskoga mora Sirena&quot; (1660) by great-grandson Petar Zrinski. In the epic poem, the elder Zrinski is the main hero and has assured Zrinski&#x27;s place in Hungarian culture as it remains in print today and is considered one of the landmarks of Hungarian literature. Compared to the Hungarian poem, which is an exception in Hungarian literature, the Croatian variation fits the Croatian literature tradition. Vladislav Menčetić&#x27;s &quot;Trublja slovinska&quot; (1665) is the first Ragusan literature work that introduces the idea of &quot;antemurale Christianitatis&quot; for Croatian territories and celebrates Zrinski as a hero. Pavao Ritter Vitezović also wrote a related epic poem &quot;Odiljenje sigetsko&quot; (1684).

In the 18th century, his heroic act inspired school dramas in Jesuit Gymnasiums, including Andreas Friz&#x27;s &quot;Nicolai Zriny ad Szigethum victoria&quot; (1738). The German author Theodor Körner wrote a tragedy, &quot;Zriny: Ein Trauerspiel&quot; (1812), after which August von Adelburg Abramović wrote the libretto for his opera &quot;Zrinyi&quot; (1868). The Croatian composer Ivan Zajc created an opera titled Nikola Šubić Zrinski (1876), as a patriotic work which is still performed regularly today. It includes an aria &quot;U boj, u boj&quot;, which is regularly performed at the Japanese Kwansei Gakuin University since the World War I.

Since the 16th century, Zrinski featured in many engravings and paintings, of him as a portrait or during the siege mostly as leading the charge, like by Matthias Zündt, Miklós Barabás, Viktor Madarász, Mikoláš Aleš, Bela Čikoš Sesija and Oton Iveković among others. In 1914, the Czech painter Alphonse Mucha dedicated to Zrinski the painting titled &quot;Defense of Sziget against the Turks by Nicholas Zrinsky: The Shield of Christendom&quot; from his &quot;The Slav Epic&quot; cycle.
By the imperial resolution of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria on 28 February 1863, Zrinski was included in the list of &quot;Austria&#x27;s most famous warlords and field commanders worthy of eternal emulation&quot;, in whose honor and memory was built a life-size statue of Carrara marble at the Museum of Military History, Vienna, in 1865 by sculptor Nikolaus Vay (1828-1886). There also exist several sculptures and busts of Zrinski in Zagreb, Čakovec and Šenkovec in Croatia, Budapest and Szigetvár in Hungary, and Heldenberg in Austria among others. Parks in Zagreb (see Nikola Šubić Zrinski Square), Koprivnica and Križevci among others are named after him.

In 1866 was held a solemn commemoration of the 300th anniversary of Zrinski&#x27;s death in Croatia. In commemoration of the 450th anniversary of the siege of Szigetvár (1566), the year 2016 was declared a memorial year of Nikola Zrinski and the siege of Szigetvár in Croatia and Hungary. On that occasion were held various cultural and artistic events, published many papers and books as well as organized scientific conferences in Zagreb, Čakovec, Vienna, and Pécs.

The Order of Nikola Šubić Zrinski is the ninth-ranked honour order given by the Republic of Croatia, awarded since 1995 to Croatian or foreign citizens for acts of heroism.

<text>In number theory, a Wall–Sun–Sun prime or Fibonacci–Wieferich prime is a certain kind of prime number which is conjectured to exist, although none are known.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be a prime number. When each term in the sequence of Fibonacci numbers formula_2 is reduced modulo formula_1, the result is a periodic sequence.
The (minimal) period length of this sequence is called the Pisano period and denoted formula_4. 
Since formula_5, it follows that &quot;p&quot; divides formula_6. A prime &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;p&quot;2 divides formula_6 is called a Wall–Sun–Sun prime.

=== Equivalent definitions ===

If formula_8 denotes the rank of apparition modulo formula_9 (i.e., formula_8 is the smallest positive index such that formula_9 divides formula_12), then a Wall–Sun–Sun prime can be equivalently defined as a prime formula_1 such that formula_14 divides formula_15.

For a prime &quot;p&quot; ≠ 2, 5, the rank of apparition formula_16 is known to divide formula_17, where the Legendre symbol formula_18 has the values
:formula_19
This observation gives rise to an equivalent characterization of Wall–Sun–Sun primes as primes formula_1 such that formula_14 divides the Fibonacci number formula_22.

A prime formula_1 is a Wall–Sun–Sun prime if and only if formula_24.

A prime formula_1 is a Wall–Sun–Sun prime if and only if formula_26, where formula_27 is the formula_1-th Lucas number.

McIntosh and Roettger establish several equivalent characterizations of Lucas–Wieferich primes. In particular, let formula_29; then the following are equivalent:
* formula_30
* formula_31
* formula_32
* formula_33
* formula_26

== Existence ==
In a study of the Pisano period formula_35, Donald Dines Wall determined that there are no Wall–Sun–Sun primes less than formula_36. In 1960, he wrote:

It has since been conjectured that there are infinitely many Wall–Sun–Sun primes.

In 2007, Richard J. McIntosh and Eric L. Roettger showed that if any exist, they must be &gt; 2.
Dorais and Klyve extended this range to 9.7 without finding such a prime.

In December 2011, another search was started by the PrimeGrid project; however, it was suspended in May 2017. In November 2020, PrimeGrid started another project that searches for Wieferich and Wall–Sun–Sun primes simultaneously. The project ended in December 2022, definitely proving that any Wall–Sun–Sun prime must exceed formula_37 (about formula_38).

== History ==
Wall–Sun–Sun primes are named after Donald Dines Wall, Zhi Hong Sun and Zhi Wei Sun; Z. H. Sun and Z. W. Sun showed in 1992 that if the first case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem was false for a certain prime &quot;p&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; would have to be a Wall–Sun–Sun prime. As a result, prior to Andrew Wiles&#x27; proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, the search for Wall–Sun–Sun primes was also the search for a potential counterexample to this centuries-old conjecture.

== Generalizations ==

A tribonacci–Wieferich prime is a prime &quot;p&quot; satisfying , where &quot;h&quot; is the least positive integer satisfying [&quot;T&quot;&quot;h&quot;,&quot;T&quot;&quot;h&quot;+1,&quot;T&quot;&quot;h&quot;+2] ≡ [&quot;T&quot;0, &quot;T&quot;1, &quot;T&quot;2] (mod &quot;m&quot;) and &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot; denotes the &quot;n&quot;-th tribonacci number. No tribonacci–Wieferich prime exists below 1011.

A Pell–Wieferich prime is a prime &quot;p&quot; satisfying &quot;p&quot;2 divides &quot;P&quot;&quot;p&quot;−1, when &quot;p&quot; congruent to 1 or 7 (mod 8), or &quot;p&quot;2 divides &quot;P&quot;&quot;p&quot;+1, when &quot;p&quot; congruent to 3 or 5 (mod 8), where &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; denotes the &quot;n&quot;-th Pell number. For example, 13, 31, and 1546463 are Pell–Wieferich primes, and no others below 109 . In fact, Pell–Wieferich primes are 2-Wall–Sun–Sun primes.

=== Near-Wall–Sun–Sun primes ===
A prime &quot;p&quot; such that formula_39 with small |&quot;A&quot;| is called near-Wall–Sun–Sun prime. Near-Wall–Sun–Sun primes with &quot;A&quot; = 0 would be Wall–Sun–Sun primes. PrimeGrid recorded cases with |&quot;A&quot;| ≤ 1000. A dozen cases are known where &quot;A&quot; = ±1 .

=== Wall–Sun–Sun primes with discriminant &quot;D&quot; ===
Wall–Sun–Sun primes can be considered for the field formula_40 with discriminant &quot;D&quot;.
For the conventional Wall–Sun–Sun primes, &quot;D&quot; = 5. In the general case, a Lucas–Wieferich prime &quot;p&quot; associated with (&quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;) is a Wieferich prime to base &quot;Q&quot; and a Wall–Sun–Sun prime with discriminant &quot;D&quot; = &quot;P&quot;2 – 4&quot;Q&quot;. In this definition, the prime &quot;p&quot; should be odd and not divide &quot;D&quot;.

It is conjectured that for every natural number &quot;D&quot;, there are infinitely many Wall–Sun–Sun primes with discriminant &quot;D&quot;.

The case of formula_41 corresponds to the &quot;k&quot;-Wall–Sun–Sun primes, for which Wall–Sun–Sun primes represent the special case &quot;k&quot; = 1. The &quot;k&quot;-Wall–Sun–Sun primes can be explicitly defined as primes &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;p&quot;2 divides the &quot;k&quot;-Fibonacci number formula_42, where &quot;Fk&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;Un&quot;(&quot;k&quot;, −1) is a Lucas sequence of the first kind with discriminant &quot;D&quot; = &quot;k&quot;2 + 4 and formula_43 is the Pisano period of &quot;k&quot;-Fibonacci numbers modulo &quot;p&quot;. For a prime &quot;p&quot; ≠ 2 and not dividing &quot;D&quot;, this condition is equivalent to either of the following.
* &quot;p&quot;2 divides formula_44, where formula_45 is the Kronecker symbol;
* &quot;Vp&quot;(&quot;k&quot;, −1) ≡ &quot;k&quot; (mod &quot;p&quot;2), where &quot;Vn&quot;(&quot;k&quot;, −1) is a Lucas sequence of the second kind.

The smallest &quot;k&quot;-Wall–Sun–Sun primes for &quot;k&quot; = 2, 3, ... are
:13, 241, 2, 3, 191, 5, 2, 3, 2683, ...

<text>Coleonyx is a genus of terrestrial geckos commonly referred to as banded geckos. Species of &quot;Coleonyx&quot; are found in the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central America. Most banded Geckos enjoy dry, warm weather which is why they are typically found in the Peninsular Desert. Some, however, prefer humid forests. They are relatively small lizards, measuring about inches in total length (including tail). They are nocturnal and are found primarily in dry, rocky habitats. Banded Geckos have preyed by snakes, their main predators being rattlesnakes and glossy snakes. Banded Geckos can decipher how they should react when they obtain a chemical cue based on their knowledge of the predator. A main resource they use to distract the predator is losing their tail or escaping quickly. Banded Geckos possess heteromorphic euchromatic sex chromosomes which play a large role in their historical contingency.

<text>Eublepharis is a genus of terrestrial geckos native to eastern and southwestern Asia. The genus was first described by the British zoologist John Edward Gray in 1827. The etymology of their name is &#x27;eu&#x27; = good (=true) |&#x27;blephar&#x27; = eyelid, and all have fully functional eyelids. Members of this genus are found in eastern and southwestern Asia. These geckos are sturdily built. Their tail is shorter than their snout–vent length, and their body is covered with numerous wart-like bumps. The toes do not have adhesive lamellae or membranes (&quot;Eublepharis&quot; cannot climb like their other gecko cousins). Like all members of Eublepharidae, they are primarily nocturnal. Included in this group is the popular pet leopard gecko &quot;Eublepharis macularius&quot;.

==Species of the genus &quot;Eublepharis&quot;==
The members of the &quot;Goniurosaurus kuroiwae&quot; superspecies were formerly considered members of the genus &quot;Eublepharis&quot;.

<doc id="323656" wikidata="Q1032405" url="?curid=323656" title="Canadian Security Intelligence Service">
<text>The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS, ; , &quot;SCRS&quot;) is a foreign intelligence service and security agency of the federal government of Canada. It is responsible for gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world and conducting covert action within Canada and abroad. CSIS reports to the Minister of Public Safety, and is subject to review by the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency.

The CSIS has no law enforcement function and mainly focuses on intelligence gathering overseas. The agency is led by a director, the current being interim appointee Vanessa Lloyd, who assumed the role on July 20, 2024.

==History==
Prior to 1984, security intelligence in Canada was the purview of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). However, during the 1970s, there were allegations that the RCMP Security Service – the predecessor to CSIS – had been involved in numerous illegal activities. As a result of these allegations, Justice David McDonald was appointed in 1977 to investigate the activities of the RCMP Security Service. The resulting investigation, known as the McDonald Commission, published its final report in 1981, with its main recommendation being that security intelligence work should be separated from policing, and that a civilian intelligence agency be created to take over from the RCMP Security Service.

On June 21, 1984, CSIS was created by an Act of Parliament. At the time, it was also decided that the activities of this new agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, should be subject to both judicial approval for warrants and to general review by a new body, the Security Intelligence Review Committee, as well as the office of the Inspector General (which was disbanded in 2012). Its &quot;de facto&quot; existence began on July 16 under the direction of Thomas D&#x27;Arcy Finn. In its early years, its primary focus was on investigating terrorist groups in response to a number of violent crimes with political undertones, such as the bombing of an Air India jet departing from Montréal and the armed takeover of the Turkish embassy in Ottawa.

At first, the main emphasis of CSIS was combating the activities of various foreign intelligence agencies operating in Canada. For example, it has been engaged in investigating economic espionage involving Chinese operations throughout Canada. While the threat posed by foreign intelligence agencies still remains, CSIS over the years since 9/11 has focused more and more on the threat to Canadian security and its citizens posed by terrorist activity, and this has led to the memorable cases of Maher Arar and Omar Khadr.

The institutional focus of CSIS returned to state actors (such as Russia and China) after a February 2021 speech by the CSIS director, David Vigneault, who warned that the Chinese &quot;strategy for geopolitical advantage on all fronts — economic, technological, political and military&quot; uses &quot;all elements of state power to carry out activities that are a direct threat to our national security and sovereignty.&quot; Meanwhile, in May 2023, according to a CSIS intelligence assessment which provided an overview of Chinese government foreign interference in Canada, it was claimed that China sees Canada as a “high-priority target” and employs “incentives and punishment” as part of a vast influence network directed at legislators, business executives and diaspora communities.

In 2024, the Parliament of Canada passed the &quot;Countering Foreign Interference Act&quot;, which amended the &quot;Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act&quot; to give CSIS powers to investigate potential foreign interference in the Canadian political system.

===Leadership===
The leadership position is mostly a political appointment.

Coulombe and Yaworski were promoted from the ranks within CSIS. Vigneault had held a management posting with CSIS. Neufeld had joined CSIS in 1984 after being in the RCMP.

Finn was previously assistant secretary to the federal cabinet for security and intelligence matters in the 1970s.

Neufeld (RCMP) and Vigneault (CBSA, CSE) have law enforcement backgrounds.

# Ted Finn 1984–1987
# Reid Morden 1988–1992
# Ray Protti 1992–1994
# Ward Elcock 1994–2004
# Dale Neufeld - Acting Director from May to November 2004
# Jim Judd 2004–2009
# Richard Fadden 2009–2013
# Michel Coulombe 2013–2017
# David Vigneault* 2017–2024
# Vanessa Lloyd - Current interim Director, appointed after Vigneault&#x27;s resignation, beginning 20 July 2024 &quot;for a term of six months or until such time as a new director of CSIS is appointed&quot;.
*Deputy director Jeffrey Yaworski briefly served as interim director for a few weeks following Coulombe&#x27;s departure, but the agency considers Vigneault to be its ninth director.

==Insignia==
CSIS is one of several federal agencies (primarily those involved with law enforcement, security, or having a regulatory function) that have been granted a heraldic badge. The badge was created in July 1984 (pre-dating the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority). The badge received royal approval in June 1985.

On December 21, 2016, a CSIS flag was raised for the first time by the director at the national headquarters. The flag displays the CSIS badge on a white field.

In the book, &quot;The Mosaic Effect&quot;, co-authors, former Canadian Military Security Intelligence Analyst, Scott McGregor and Journalist Ina Mitchell revealed that employees&#x27; internal nickname for CSIS is &quot;the Sisters.&quot;

==Mission and operations==

CSIS is a federal national security agency which conducts national security investigations and security intelligence collection. CSIS collects and analyzes intelligence, then advises the Government of Canada on issues and activities that may threaten the security of Canada and its citizens. These threats include terrorism, espionage and foreign interference in Canadian affairs, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and information security threats. The agency is also responsible for the security screening program.

There is no restriction in the &quot;Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act&quot; on where CSIS may collect &quot;security intelligence&quot; or information relating to threats to the security of Canada. The Service can collect three sorts of datasets: a publicly available dataset, a dataset which belongs to an approved class which is defined by the Minister, and a dataset that &quot;predominantly relates to non-Canadians who are outside Canada.&quot;

There is a distinction between &quot;security intelligence&quot; and &quot;foreign intelligence&quot;. Security intelligence pertains to national security threats (e.g., terrorism, espionage). Foreign intelligence involves information collection relating to the political or economic activities of foreign states. Previous law stated that CSIS was only allowed to collect this intelligence within Canada but due to an updated law in 2016 they are now allowed to collect that intelligence abroad as well.

CSIS has served in many different countries, especially after 9/11. Examples of some of the countries they have served in are: Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Mali, Libya, Sudan, Pakistan, Somalia, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.

CSIS is neither a police agency nor is it a part of the military. As a civilian intelligence agency, the primary role of CSIS is not law enforcement. Investigation of criminal activity is left to the RCMP and local (provincial, regional or municipal) police agencies. CSIS, like counterparts such as the UK Security Service (MI5) and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), is a civilian agency. CSIS is subject to review by the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency (NSIRA) as well as other legislative checks and balances. The agency carries out its functions in accordance with the &quot;Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act&quot;, which governs and defines its powers and activities.

Canadian police, military agencies (Canadian Forces Intelligence Branch), and numerous other government departments may maintain their own &quot;intelligence&quot; components (i.e. to analyze criminal intelligence or military strategic intelligence). Global Affairs Canada maintains a Security and Intelligence Bureau to review and analyze overtly acquired information. The bureau plays a coordinating and policy role. While not an intelligence agency, it is responsible for the security of Global Affairs Canada personnel around the world. However, these agencies are not to be confused with the more encompassing work of larger, more dedicated &quot;intelligence agencies&quot; such as CSIS, MI5, MI6, or the CIA.

As Canada&#x27;s contributor of human intelligence to the Five Eyes, CSIS works closely with the intelligence agencies of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Under the post-World War II Quadripartite (UKUSA) Agreement, intelligence information is shared between the intelligence agencies of these five countries.

It is widely speculated that CSIS employees similar to Security Intelligence Officers are posted at Canadian Embassies abroad in order to collect foreign intelligence. However, there is no evidence of this, and is only a speculation.

CSIS was named one of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers&quot; by Mediacorp Canada Inc. for the years of 2009–2011, and was featured in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; newsmagazine.

===Air India Flight 182===
On the morning of June 23, 1985, Air India Flight 182 approached Ireland&#x27;s west coast, unaware of the impending tragedy. The journey began in Toronto, where passengers and luggage were transferred from connecting flights before continuing to Montreal&#x27;s Mirabel Airport for the long journey to India. The flight carried 329 people, including 268 Canadians, many of whom were children, young adults, and families traveling to visit relatives and friends during the summer vacation season. Unbeknownst to the passengers, the flight was the target of a sophisticated terrorist plot executed by Sikh extremists seeking revenge for Operation Blue Star, the Indian government&#x27;s military operation against Sikh separatists in Amritsar. Investigators later determined that a suitcase containing a bomb had been checked onto Flight 182 in Vancouver, Canada, destined to detonate mid-flight. The Air India bombing remains one of the deadliest terrorist attack in Canadian history, but it also exposed significant lapses in intelligence and security measures. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), established only a year earlier in 1984, faced criticism for its failure to prevent the attack. CSIS had been surveilling Sikh extremist groups in Canada, including members of the Babbar Khalsa and other organizations. Wiretap evidence and informants had revealed plans for potential attacks, but the intelligence was either misinterpreted or not acted upon with urgency. One of the most controversial issues was CSIS&#x27;s destruction of wiretap recordings of key suspects. The tapes could have provided crucial evidence during investigations and trials but were erased as part of routine policy, a move widely criticized as negligent. The lack of coordination between CSIS and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) also hindered efforts to thwart the bombing. Intelligence gathered by CSIS was not effectively shared or acted upon, highlighting systemic issues in Canada’s counterterrorism framework.
 Although CSIS&#x27;s participation into the investigation of the attack is still limited the presence of CSIS investigation into the bombing remains conscious within the public and government domain and acted as one of the first tasks given to the Canadian Secret Intelligence Service.

==Organization==
===Regional===

CSIS headquarters is located in Ottawa, Ontario and is responsible for the overall operations. Regionally, Canada is broken down into six subordinate regions; the Atlantic, Quebec, Ottawa, Toronto, Prairie, and British Columbia Regions.

These regions are responsible for investigating any threat to Canada and its allies as defined by the &quot;Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act&quot;. They liaise with the various federal, provincial, municipal and private sector entities found within their areas of responsibility. They also conduct various outreach programs with different community and cultural groups, universities, and private sector organizations in an effort to provide a better understanding, and to clear up any misunderstandings of the role of CSIS. All these regions also border the US and they therefore maintain contact with their US federal counterparts.

====Atlantic Region====
The Atlantic Region encompasses the four Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island) and is the smallest of the six CSIS regions. Its main office is located in Halifax, with two district offices in Fredericton and St. John&#x27;s.

====Quebec Region====
This region is responsible solely for the province of Quebec. Its main office is in Montreal, with one district office in Quebec City.

====Ottawa and Toronto Regions====
These two regions are responsible for operations in Ontario (except for NW Ontario). There are four district offices located in Niagara Falls, Windsor, Downtown Toronto and at Toronto Pearson International Airport.

====Prairie Region====
Geographically, this represents the largest of the six regions and encompasses the area of Ontario north and west of Thunder Bay, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the three northern territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. The regional office is located in Edmonton with three district offices located in Winnipeg, Regina and Calgary.

====British Columbia====
This region is responsible for the province of British Columbia. Its main office is located in downtown Burnaby with a district office at the Vancouver International Airport.

===Executive Structure===
CSIS is functionally divided into three Deputy Directorates and five Assistant Directorates:
* Deputy Director Operations
** Assistant Director Collection
** Assistant Director Requirements
* Deputy Director Administration and Chief Financial Officer
* Deputy Director Policy and Strategic Partnerships
* Assistant Director Legal Services
* Assistant Director Technology
* Assistant Director Human Resources

CSIS also houses a Chief Audit and Evaluation Executive and a Senior Officer for Disclosure of Wrongdoing.

==Weapons==
CSIS officers stationed in foreign flashpoints, such as Afghanistan, carry unspecified guns, however they are not authorized to bear arms inside Canada.

== Training ==
CSIS Intelligence Officers (IOs) are required to complete the Intelligence Officer Entry Training (IOET) program at CSIS HQ in Ottawa, Ontario, followed by a three-year professional development program with a mandatory posting in Ottawa. Upon completion of the program, IOs may progress to the investigator role and may be relocated to other offices. Intelligence Officers are put on probation for at least a year upon completion of the IOET. Foreign language training is also available for Intelligence Officers.

== Research, analysis and production ==
The RAP was reorganized in 1996–1997 in order to better coordinate with the Intelligence Assessment Secretariat of the Privy Council Office. It has four sub-divisions: Counter Intelligence, Foreign Intelligence, Counter-terrorism and Distribution.

==Oversight==
As part of an omnibus national security bill passed by the Parliament in 2019, the oversight and reporting regime for CSIS was overhauled. The previous agency that handled all oversight of CSIS, the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC) was replaced by a new agency, the National Security &amp; Intelligence Review Agency (NSIRA), which now includes oversight of all national security and intelligence activities undertaken by any agency of the Government of Canada.

The reforms also included the creation of a new Intelligence Commissioner who reports to Parliament and has quasi-judicial oversight of all national security matters.

National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) is the primary oversight committee in regards to Canadian Intelligence. The committee performs strategic and systematic reviews of the legislative, regulatory, policy, expenditure and administrative frameworks under which national security activities are conducted. The committee is composed of members from the House of Commons and Senate. While members are made up of Members of Parliament, the committee is not a standing committee nor a special committee of Parliament. Rather, it is an agency of the executive branch, itself overseen by the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office.

According to L&#x27;Hebdo Journal, it is reported that some senior officials of the service used a bunker in Ottawa to file and discuss warrant applications with judges of the Federal Court.

==Controversies==

In the first year after its creation, CSIS was embroiled in the Air India bombing incident. There is evidence that CSIS knew of the plot three weeks before it happened, had multiple informants under surveillance, and that one of the suspects in the bombing, Surjan Singh Gill, was a CSIS informant. It was also revealed that of the 210 wiretaps recorded before and after the bombing, 156 were erased by CSIS. The scandal contributed to the resignation of CSIS&#x27; first director, Ted Finn.

Crown prosecutor James Jardine expressed frustration with CSIS to the Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India Flight 182, headed by Justice John C. Major. Two Canadian courts have publicly criticized CSIS for destroying wiretap evidence. One court commented on the importance of wiretap evidence from CSIS in establishing guilt. The second focused on its exculpatory value.

From 1988-1994, CSIS contracted a private investigator to act as an undercover agent. The agent, Grant Bristow, built relationships with far-right activists and white supremacists involved in the Nationalist Party of Canada, before breaking off with them to form the Heritage Front. Bristow would act as one of the Front&#x27;s leading organizers, including helping to organize actions, recruit members, bring speakers to Canada (such as Tom Metzger), and offer training to Front activists. When the story became public knowledge, the press aired concerns that he had not only been one of the founders of the Heritage Front group, but that he had also channelled CSIS funding to the group.

In 1997, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police collaborated with CSIS on Project Sidewinder, a study alleging China had set up a foreign influence network in Canada. The RCMP accused CSIS of &quot;watering down&quot; the report.

In several instances, CSIS has been accused of misrepresenting facts to the courts. In 2013, CSIS was censured by Federal Court Judge Richard Mosley for deliberately misleading the Federal Court to make it possible for them to allow other agencies to spy on Canadians abroad, which is not allowed by Canadian law. Mosley found that &quot;CSIS breached its duty of candour to the Court by not disclosing information that was relevant,&quot; according to a statement by the Federal Court.

CSIS has also been involved in cases where evidence has been mishandled or omitted from the Courts. In 2009, it was alleged that the service did not disclose information that their confidential informants, which CSIS had been relying on to gather information about their targets, were either deceptive, or failed lie-detector tests. This was not an isolated case, and in several other instances, the agency mishandling of evidence has also called for investigation.

On September 18, 2006, the Arar Commission absolved CSIS of any involvement in the extraordinary rendition by the United States of a Canadian citizen, Maher Arar. The commission found that US authorities sent Arar to Jordan and then Syria (his country of birth) based on incorrect information which had been provided by the RCMP to the US government. Arar was held by the Syrians for one year and was tortured. The sole criticism of CSIS leveled by the commission was that the agency should do more to critically examine information provided by regimes which practice torture.

On March 31, 2009, CSIS lawyer and advisor Geoffrey O&#x27;Brian told the Committee on Public Safety and National Security that CSIS would use information obtained by torture if it could prevent another attack such as 9/11 or the Air India bombing. Testifying before the same committee two days later, the director of CSIS, Jim Judd said that O&#x27;Brian &quot;may have been confused&quot; and &quot;venturing into a hypothetical&quot;, and would send the committee a clarifying letter. Two weeks later CSIS announced that Judd would be retiring in June, five months before the end of his five-year term.

Prominent Canadian national security lawyer Barbara Jackman has also been critical, categorizing the research by CSIS as &quot;sloppy&quot; and that its officers are &quot;susceptible to tunnel vision&quot;.

In 2017, several CSIS members accused the organization of having a racist and homophobic workplace culture.

In 2018, CSIS was accused by Canadian lawmakers of purposely giving money to former terrorists-turned-informants for more information, CSIS repeatedly denied this. However several weeks later Director David Vigneault would appear in front of Canada&#x27;s Parliament to testify regarding the act.

In June 2023, a prominent Sikh leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, was murdered outside a temple in British Columbia, Canada by unidentified gunmen. Notably in September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being behind Nijjar&#x27;s death, saying that Canadian intelligence had identified &quot;credible allegations&quot; of a link between his death and agents of the Indian state.

In December 2023, CSIS launched a workplace assessment on CSIS&#x27; BC office due to serious allegations of rape by anonymous female CSIS officers and concerns of a toxic environment. At the same time, an ombudsman position would be created to look into workplace issues for employees to submit reports anonymously without any fear of reprisals while reports on harassment and wrongdoing by CSIS would be released annually.

<text>Agamura is a genus of geckos.

==Species==
Three &quot;Agamura&quot; species are recognized:
*&quot;Agamura cruralis&quot; 
*&quot;Agamura kermanensis&quot; 
*&quot;Agamura persica&quot; – Persian spider gecko

Geckos of the genus &quot;Rhinogekko&quot; have sometimes been classified in genus &quot;Agamura&quot; but the genus is currently considered distinct from the latter. These genera share a number of characteristics: straight to slightly bent toes, weakly tuberculate skin, and long, thin limbs and tail.

<text>Aristelliger is a genus of Caribbean geckos in the family Sphaerodactylidae, commonly known as croaking geckos or Caribbean geckos. The nine named species in the genus are native to various islands in the West Indies, though the species &quot;A. georgeensis&quot; is also found on mainland Belize. &quot;Aristelliger&quot; species are nocturnal and mostly arboreal, occupying palm tree trunks and other vertical surfaces. They are among the largest neotropical geckos, with &quot;A. lar&quot; reaching up to 135 mm (5.3 inches) in snout-vent-length (not including the tail). They are primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of arthropods. Cannibalism of eggs and hatchlings has been reported in &quot;A. cochranae&quot;. &quot;A. lar&quot; is omnivorous, and may be an important seed disperser for fruits of the plant &quot;Marcgravia&quot;. Many species of &quot;Aristelliger&quot; are accustomed to living among human structures, though several are threatened by urban and agricultural development or invasive species.

<doc id="323677" wikidata="Q1332338" url="?curid=323677" title="IP fragmentation">
<text>IP fragmentation is an Internet Protocol (IP) process that breaks packets into smaller pieces (fragments), so that the resulting pieces can pass through a link with a smaller maximum transmission unit (MTU) than the original packet size. The fragments are reassembled by the receiving host.

The details of the fragmentation mechanism, as well as the overall architectural approach to fragmentation, are different between IPv4 and IPv6.

==Process==
 describes the procedure for IP fragmentation, and transmission and reassembly of IP packets. RFC 815 describes a simplified reassembly algorithm. The &quot;Identification&quot; field along with the &quot;foreign&quot; and &quot;local internet address&quot; and the &quot;protocol ID&quot;, and &quot;Fragment&quot; offset field along with &quot;Don&#x27;t Fragment&quot; and &quot;More Fragments&quot; flags in the IP header are used for fragmentation and reassembly of IP packets.

If a receiving host receives a fragmented IP packet, it has to reassemble the packet and pass it to the higher protocol layer. Reassembly is intended to happen in the receiving host but in practice, it may be done by an intermediate router, for example, network address translation (NAT) &quot;may&quot; need to reassemble fragments in order to translate data streams.

==IPv4 and IPv6 differences==

Under IPv4, a router that receives a network packet larger than the next hop&#x27;s MTU has two options: drop the packet if the &quot;Don&#x27;t Fragment&quot; (DF) flag bit is set in the packet&#x27;s header and send an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message which indicates the condition &quot;Fragmentation Needed&quot; (Type 3, Code 4), or fragment the packet and send it over the link with a smaller MTU. Although originators may produce fragmented packets, IPv6 routers do not have the option to fragment further. Instead, network equipment is required to deliver any IPv6 packets or packet fragments smaller than or equal to 1280 bytes and IPv6 hosts are required to determine the optimal MTU through Path MTU Discovery before sending packets.

Though the header formats are different for IPv4 and IPv6, analogous fields are used for fragmentation, so the same algorithm can be reused for IPv4 and IPv6 fragmentation and reassembly.

In IPv4, hosts must make a best-effort attempt to reassemble fragmented IP packets with a total reassembled size of up to 576 bytes. They may also attempt to reassemble fragmented IP packets larger than 576 bytes, but they are also permitted to silently discard such larger packets. Applications are recommended to refrain from sending packets larger than 576 bytes unless they have prior knowledge that the remote host is capable of accepting or reassembling them.

In IPv6, hosts must make a best-effort attempt to reassemble fragmented packets with a total reassembled size of up to 1500 bytes, larger than IPv6&#x27;s minimum MTU of 1280 bytes. Fragmented packets with a total reassembled size larger than 1500 bytes may optionally be silently discarded. Applications relying upon IPv6 fragmentation to overcome a path MTU limitation must explicitly fragment the packet at the point of origin; however, they should not attempt to send fragmented packets with a total size larger than 1500 bytes unless they know in advance that the remote host is capable of reassembly.

== Impact on network forwarding ==
When a network has multiple parallel paths, technologies like LAG and CEF split traffic across the paths according to a hash algorithm. One goal of the algorithm is to ensure all packets of the same flow are sent out the same path to minimize unnecessary packet reordering.

IP fragmentation can cause excessive retransmissions when fragments encounter packet loss and reliable protocols such as TCP must retransmit all of the fragments in order to recover from the loss of a single fragment. Thus, senders typically use two approaches to decide the size of IP packets to send over the network. The first is for the sending host to send an IP packet of size equal to the MTU of the first hop of the source-destination pair. The second is to run the Path MTU Discovery algorithm to determine the path MTU between two IP hosts so that IP fragmentation can be avoided.

, IP fragmentation is considered fragile and often undesired due to its security impact.

<text>A grave is a location where a dead body (typically that of a human, although sometimes that of an animal) is buried or interred after a funeral. Graves are usually located in special areas set aside for the purpose of burial, such as graveyards or cemeteries.

In some religions, it is believed that the body must be burned or cremated for the soul to survive; in others, the complete decomposition of the body is considered to be important for the rest of the soul (see bereavement).

== Description ==

The formal use of a grave involves several steps with associated terminology.
;Grave cut
The excavation that forms the grave. Excavations vary from a shallow scraping to removal of topsoil to a depth of or more where a vault or burial chamber is to be constructed. However, most modern graves in the United States are only deep as the casket is placed into a concrete box (see burial vault) to prevent a sinkhole, to ensure the grave is strong enough to be driven over, and to prevent floating in the instance of a flood.

;Excavated soil
The material dug up when the grave is excavated. It is often piled up close to the grave for backfilling and then returned to the grave to cover it. As soil decompresses when excavated and space is occupied by the burial not all the volume of soil fits back in the hole, so often evidence is found of remaining soil. In cemeteries, this may end up as a thick layer of soil overlying the original ground surface.

;Burial or interment
The body may be placed in a coffin or other container, in a wide range of positions, by itself or in a multiple burial, with or without personal possessions of the deceased.

;Burial vault
A vault is a structure built within the grave to receive the body. It may be used to prevent crushing of the remains, allow for multiple burials such as a family vault, retrieval of remains for transfer to an ossuary, or because it forms a monument.

;Grave backfill
The soil returned to the grave cut following burial. This material may contain artifacts derived from the original excavation and prior site use, deliberately placed goods or artifacts, or later material. The fill may be left level with the ground or mounded.

;Monument or marker
Headstones are best known, but they can be supplemented by decorative edging, footstones, posts to support items, a solid covering or other options.

== Graveyards and cemeteries ==


Graveyards were usually established at the same time as the building of the relevant place of worship (which can date back to the 8th to 14th centuries) and were often used by those families who could not afford to be buried inside or beneath the place of worship itself. In most cultures those who were vastly rich, had important professions, were part of the nobility or were of any other high social status were usually buried in individual crypts inside or beneath the relevant place of worship with an indication of the name of the deceased, date of death and other biographical data. In Europe, this was often accompanied by a depiction of their family coat of arms.

Later, graveyards have been replaced by cemeteries.

== In language ==

* Turn in one&#x27;s grave is an idiom to describe an extreme level of shock or an intense level of surprise and is expressed as the vicarious sentiment of a deceased person.

<text>In number theory, a regular prime is a special kind of prime number, defined by Ernst Kummer in 1850 to prove certain cases of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. Regular primes may be defined via the divisibility of either class numbers or of Bernoulli numbers.

The first few regular odd primes are:
: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 107, 109, 113, 127, 137, 139, 151, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, ... .

== History and motivation ==
In 1850, Kummer proved that Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem is true for a prime exponent &quot;p&quot; if &quot;p&quot; is regular. This focused attention on the irregular primes. In 1852, Genocchi was able to prove that the first case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem is true for an exponent &quot;p&quot;, if is not an irregular pair. Kummer improved this further in 1857 by showing that for the &quot;first case&quot; of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem (see Sophie Germain&#x27;s theorem) it is sufficient to establish that either or fails to be an irregular pair.

( is an irregular pair when &quot;p&quot; is irregular due to a certain condition described below being realized at 2&quot;k&quot;.)

Kummer found the irregular primes less than 165. In 1963, Lehmer reported results up to 10000 and Selfridge and Pollack announced in 1964 to have completed the table of irregular primes up to 25000. Although the two latter tables did not appear in print, Johnson found that is in fact an irregular pair for and that this is the first and only time this occurs for . It was found in 1993 that the next time this happens is for ; see Wolstenholme prime.

== Definition ==

=== Class number criterion ===
An odd prime number &quot;p&quot; is defined to be regular if it does not divide the class number of the &quot;p&quot;th cyclotomic field Q(&quot;ζ&quot;&quot;p&quot;), where &quot;ζ&quot;&quot;p&quot; is a primitive &quot;p&quot;th root of unity.

The prime number 2 is often considered regular as well.

The class number of the cyclotomic
field is the number of ideals of the ring of integers
Z(&quot;ζ&quot;&quot;p&quot;) up to equivalence. Two ideals &quot;I&quot;, &quot;J&quot; are considered equivalent if there is a nonzero &quot;u&quot; in Q(&quot;ζ&quot;&quot;p&quot;) so that . The first few of these class numbers are listed in .

=== Kummer&#x27;s criterion ===
Ernst Kummer showed that an equivalent criterion for regularity is that &quot;p&quot; does not divide the numerator of any of the Bernoulli numbers &quot;B&quot;&quot;k&quot; for .

Kummer&#x27;s proof that this is equivalent to the class number definition is strengthened by the Herbrand–Ribet theorem, which states certain consequences of &quot;p&quot; dividing the numerator of one of these Bernoulli numbers.

== Siegel&#x27;s conjecture ==
It has been conjectured that there are infinitely many regular primes. More precisely conjectured that &quot;e&quot;−1/2, or about 60.65%, of all prime numbers are regular, in the asymptotic sense of natural density. 

Taking Kummer&#x27;s criterion, the chance that one numerator of the Bernoulli numbers formula_1, formula_2, is not divisible by the prime formula_3 is

:formula_4

so that the chance that none of the numerators of these Bernoulli numbers are divisible by the prime formula_3 is

:formula_6.

By E_(mathematical_constant), we have

:formula_7

so that we obtain the probability

:formula_8.

It follows that about formula_9 of the primes are regular by chance. Hart et al. indicate that formula_10 of the primes less than formula_11 are regular.

== Irregular primes ==
An odd prime that is not regular is an irregular prime (or Bernoulli irregular or B-irregular to distinguish from other types of irregularity discussed below). The first few irregular primes are:
: 37, 59, 67, 101, 103, 131, 149, 157, 233, 257, 263, 271, 283, 293, 307, 311, 347, 353, 379, 389, 401, 409, 421, 433, 461, 463, 467, 491, 523, 541, 547, 557, 577, 587, 593, ... 

=== Infinitude ===
K. L. Jensen (a student of Nielsen) proved in 1915 that there are infinitely many irregular primes of the form .
In 1954 Carlitz gave a simple proof of the weaker result that there are in general infinitely many irregular primes.

Metsänkylä proved in 1971 that for any integer , there are infinitely many irregular primes not of the form or , and later generalized this.

=== Irregular pairs ===
If &quot;p&quot; is an irregular prime and &quot;p&quot; divides the numerator of the Bernoulli number &quot;B&quot;2&quot;k&quot; for , then is called an irregular pair. In other words, an irregular pair is a bookkeeping device to record, for an irregular prime &quot;p&quot;, the particular indices of the Bernoulli numbers at which regularity fails. The first few irregular pairs (when ordered by &quot;k&quot;) are:
: (691, 12), (3617, 16), (43867, 18), (283, 20), (617, 20), (131, 22), (593, 22), (103, 24), (2294797, 24), (657931, 26), (9349, 28), (362903, 28), ... .

The smallest even &quot;k&quot; such that &quot;n&quot;th irregular prime divides &quot;Bk are
: 32, 44, 58, 68, 24, 22, 130, 62, 84, 164, 100, 84, 20, 156, 88, 292, 280, 186, 100, 200, 382, 126, 240, 366, 196, 130, 94, 292, 400, 86, 270, 222, 52, 90, 22, ... 

For a given prime &quot;p&quot;, the number of such pairs is called the index of irregularity of &quot;p&quot;. Hence, a prime is regular if and only if its index of irregularity is zero. Similarly, a prime is irregular if and only if its index of irregularity is positive.

It was discovered that is in fact an irregular pair for , as well as for . There are no more occurrences for .

=== Irregular index ===
An odd prime &quot;p&quot; has irregular index &quot;n&quot; if and only if there are &quot;n&quot; values of &quot;k&quot; for which &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;B&quot;2&quot;k&quot; and these &quot;k&quot;s are less than . The first irregular prime with irregular index greater than 1 is 157, which divides &quot;B&quot;62 and &quot;B&quot;110, so it has an irregular index 2. Clearly, the irregular index of a regular prime is 0.

The irregular index of the &quot;n&quot;th prime is
:0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, ... (Start with &quot;n&quot; = 2, or the prime = 3) 

The irregular index of the &quot;n&quot;th irregular prime is
:1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, ... 

The primes having irregular index 1 are
: 37, 59, 67, 101, 103, 131, 149, 233, 257, 263, 271, 283, 293, 307, 311, 347, 389, 401, 409, 421, 433, 461, 463, 523, 541, 557, 577, 593, 607, 613, 619, 653, 659, 677, 683, 727, 751, 757, 761, 773, 797, 811, 821, 827, 839, 877, 881, 887, 953, 971, ... 

The primes having irregular index 2 are
: 157, 353, 379, 467, 547, 587, 631, 673, 691, 809, 929, 1291, 1297, 1307, 1663, 1669, 1733, 1789, 1933, 1997, 2003, 2087, 2273, 2309, 2371, 2383, 2423, 2441, 2591, 2671, 2789, 2909, 2957, ... 

The primes having irregular index 3 are
: 491, 617, 647, 1151, 1217, 1811, 1847, 2939, 3833, 4003, 4657, 4951, 6763, 7687, 8831, 9011, 10463, 10589, 12073, 13217, 14533, 14737, 14957, 15287, 15787, 15823, 16007, 17681, 17863, 18713, 18869, ... 

The least primes having irregular index &quot;n&quot; are
: 2, 3, 37, 157, 491, 12613, 78233, 527377, 3238481, ... (This sequence defines &quot;the irregular index of 2&quot; as −1, and also starts at .)

== Generalizations==

=== Euler irregular primes ===
Similarly, we can define an Euler irregular prime (or E-irregular) as a prime &quot;p&quot; that divides at least one Euler number &quot;E&quot;2&quot;n&quot; with . The first few Euler irregular primes are
:19, 31, 43, 47, 61, 67, 71, 79, 101, 137, 139, 149, 193, 223, 241, 251, 263, 277, 307, 311, 349, 353, 359, 373, 379, 419, 433, 461, 463, 491, 509, 541, 563, 571, 577, 587, ... 

The Euler irregular pairs are
: (61, 6), (277, 8), (19, 10), (2659, 10), (43, 12), (967, 12), (47, 14), (4241723, 14), (228135437, 16), (79, 18), (349, 18), (84224971, 18), (41737, 20), (354957173, 20), (31, 22), (1567103, 22), (1427513357, 22), (2137, 24), (111691689741601, 24), (67, 26), (61001082228255580483, 26), (71, 28), (30211, 28), (2717447, 28), (77980901, 28), ...

Vandiver proved in 1940 that Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem () has no solution for integers &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; with if &quot;p&quot; is Euler-regular. Gut proved that has no solution if &quot;p&quot; has an E-irregularity index less than 5.

It was proven that there is an infinity of E-irregular primes. A stronger result was obtained: there is an infinity of E-irregular primes congruent to 1 modulo 8. As in the case of Kummer&#x27;s B-regular primes, there is as yet no proof that there are infinitely many E-regular primes, though this seems likely to be true.

=== Strong irregular primes ===
A prime &quot;p&quot; is called strong irregular if it is both B-irregular and E-irregular (the indexes of Bernoulli and Euler numbers that are divisible by &quot;p&quot; can be either the same or different). The first few strong irregular primes are
: 67, 101, 149, 263, 307, 311, 353, 379, 433, 461, 463, 491, 541, 577, 587, 619, 677, 691, 751, 761, 773, 811, 821, 877, 887, 929, 971, 1151, 1229, 1279, 1283, 1291, 1307, 1319, 1381, 1409, 1429, 1439, ... 

To prove the Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for a strong irregular prime &quot;p&quot; is more difficult (since Kummer proved the first case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for B-regular primes, Vandiver proved the first case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for E-regular primes), the most difficult is that &quot;p&quot; is not only a strong irregular prime, but , , , , , and are also all composite (Legendre proved the first case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for primes &quot;p&quot; such that at least one of , , , , , and is prime), the first few such &quot;p&quot; are
: 263, 311, 379, 461, 463, 541, 751, 773, 887, 971, 1283, ...

=== Weak irregular primes ===
A prime &quot;p&quot; is weak irregular if it is either B-irregular or E-irregular (or both). The first few weak irregular primes are
: 19, 31, 37, 43, 47, 59, 61, 67, 71, 79, 101, 103, 131, 137, 139, 149, 157, 193, 223, 233, 241, 251, 257, 263, 271, 277, 283, 293, 307, 311, 347, 349, 353, 373, 379, 389, 401, 409, 419, 421, 433, 461, 463, 491, 509, 523, 541, 547, 557, 563, 571, 577, 587, 593, ... 

Like the Bernoulli irregularity, the weak regularity relates to the divisibility of class numbers of cyclotomic fields. In fact, a prime &quot;p&quot; is weak irregular if and only if &quot;p&quot; divides the class number of the 4&quot;p&quot;th cyclotomic field Q(&quot;ζ&quot;4&quot;p&quot;).

==== Weak irregular pairs ====
In this section, &quot;&quot;an&quot; means the numerator of the &quot;n&quot;th Bernoulli number if &quot;n&quot; is even, &quot;an&quot; means the th Euler number if &quot;n&quot; is odd .

Since for every odd prime &quot;p&quot;, &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;ap&quot; if and only if &quot;p&quot; is congruent to 1 mod 4, and since &quot;p&quot; divides the denominator of th Bernoulli number for every odd prime &quot;p&quot;, so for any odd prime &quot;p&quot;, &quot;p&quot; cannot divide &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot;−1. Besides, if and only if an odd prime &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;an&quot; (and 2&quot;p&quot; does not divide &quot;n&quot;), then &quot;p&quot; also divides &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;+&quot;k&quot;(&quot;p&quot;−1) (if 2&quot;p&quot; divides &quot;n&quot;, then the sentence should be changed to &quot;p&quot; also divides &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;+2&quot;kp&quot;&quot;. In fact, if 2&quot;p&quot; divides &quot;n&quot; and does not divide &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;.) for every integer &quot;k&quot; (a condition is must be &gt; 1). For example, since 19 divides &quot;a&quot;11 and does not divide 11, so 19 divides &quot;a&quot;18&quot;k&quot;+11 for all &quot;k&quot;. Thus, the definition of irregular pair , &quot;n&quot; should be at most .

The following table shows all irregular pairs with odd prime :

The only primes below 1000 with weak irregular index 3 are 307, 311, 353, 379, 577, 587, 617, 619, 647, 691, 751, and 929. Besides, 491 is the only prime below 1000 with weak irregular index 4, and all other odd primes below 1000 with weak irregular index 0, 1, or 2. (Weak irregular index is defined as &quot;number of integers such that &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;an&quot;.)

The following table shows all irregular pairs with &quot;n&quot; ≤ 63. (To get these irregular pairs, we only need to factorize &quot;an&quot;. For example, , but , so the only irregular pair with is ) (for more information (even &quot;n&quot;s up to 300 and odd &quot;n&quot;s up to 201), see ).

The following table shows irregular pairs (), it is a conjecture that there are infinitely many irregular pairs for every natural number , but only few were found for fixed &quot;n&quot;. For some values of &quot;n&quot;, even there is no known such prime &quot;p&quot;.

<doc id="323691" wikidata="Q467694" url="?curid=323691" title="Lachlan Macquarie">
<text>Major General Lachlan Macquarie, CB (; ; 31 January 1762 – 1 July 1824) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator from Scotland. Macquarie served as the fifth Governor of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821, and had a leading role in the social, economic, and architectural development of the colony. He is considered by historians to have had a crucial influence on the transition of New South Wales from a penal colony to a free settlement and therefore to have played a major role in the shaping of Australian society in the early nineteenth century.

Macquarie played a central role in urban planning in the colony. He had a significant impact on the development of modern Sydney, establishing the layout upon which the modern city centre is based, establishing Hyde Park as Australia&#x27;s first public park, overseeing the construction of various public buildings along Macquarie Street, and devising the layouts of a number of settlements which today are part of Western Sydney. He also ordered the designing of a street layout for Hobart. A supporter of exploration, Macquarie authorised the 1813 expedition across the Blue Mountains, the first successful British traversal of the region. He ordered the establishment of Bathurst, the first inland British settlement in Australia.

While seeking to promote morality and orderliness, Macquarie favoured the liberal treatment of ex-convicts, known as emancipists, appointing them to prominent government positions and providing generous land grants.

Macquarie expressed a desire for Aboriginal peoples to be treated kindly, and established the first school for Aboriginal children in 1815; at the same time, in 1816 he gave orders that led to the Appin Massacre of Gundungurra and Dharawal people during the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars.

==Early life==
Lachlan Macquarie was born on the island of Ulva off the coast of the Isle of Mull in the Inner Hebrides, a chain of islands off the West Coast of Scotland. His father, Lachlan senior, worked as a carpenter and miller, and was a cousin of a Clan MacQuarrie chieftain. His mother, Margaret, was the sister of the influential Murdoch Maclaine, 19th laird of Lochbuie. Despite this, his parents were relatively poor and probably illiterate, leasing and working a small farm as sub-tenants at Oskamull. In his early teens, Macquarie was sent to Edinburgh to be educated, possibly attending the Royal High School of Edinburgh where he learnt English and arithmetic.

==British Army==
===North America===
Macquarie volunteered to join the British Army in 1776 and was assigned to the 84th Regiment of Foot. Later that year he travelled with it to North America to fight against the revolutionaries in the American War of Independence. On the way to America he participated in the Battle of the Newcastle Jane, the first naval victory for a British merchant ship over an American privateer. Macquarie was initially stationed at Halifax, Nova Scotia and obtained the junior rank of ensign on 9 April 1777. On 18 January 1781, he was promoted to lieutenant and transferred to the 71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot, and served with them in New York City and Charleston. Macquarie safely saw out the end of the rebellion by being posted in Jamaica at the time of the British defeat in the war.

===India===
In June 1784 Macquarie returned to Scotland, where he managed the Lochbuie estates of his uncle, Captain Murdoch Maclaine. Through the influence of Maclaine, he was offered a lieutenancy in the 77th (Hindoostan) Regiment of Foot, a British Army unit, which he took up on Christmas Day 1787. The cost of this regiment was met by the East India company because it was raised specifically for service in India.

Macquarie arrived with his regiment at Bombay in August 1788 where he was stationed for two years. He saw active service from 1790 to 1792 during the Third Anglo-Mysore War, under General Abercromby, participating in the Capture of Cannanore and the 1792 Siege of Seringapatam. He was promoted to Major of Brigade of troops on the Malabar Coast in August 1793 and became a Freemason that same year at Bombay. In September 1793 Macquarie married Jane Jarvis, daughter of the late Chief Justice of Antigua, Thomas Jarvis, who had owned slave plantations there. According to their marriage settlement, Miss Jarvis was worth £6,000 which was paid out to Macquarie three years later when she died of tuberculosis. In 1795, he saw further action leading troops at the successful siege of the Dutch fort at Cochin. A year later Macquarie participated in the taking of Colombo and other Dutch possessions in Ceylon, and was made commander of the occupying garrison at Galle.

In May 1797, Macquarie led troops during the campaign against the rebel forces of Pazhassi Raja in the jungles around Manantheri. Employing guerilla tactics, Pazhassi inflicted sizable casualties on the 77th, killing a number of officers with Macquarie himself being wounded in the foot. The British torched all the villages in the district but conceded defeat with the East India Company forced into a peace treaty with Pazhassi. Macquarie resigned from his commanding role soon after the campaign.
He participated in front-line combat during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War against the forces of Tipu Sultan, helping defeat them first at the Battle of Seedaseer and then at the siege and storming of Tipu&#x27;s palace at Srirangapatna in 1799. He described the &quot;glorious&quot; aftermath where the bodies of Tipu and his people &quot;lay in such immense Heaps on the Ramparts...as well as in different Parts of the Town that no regular account of them could be taken&quot;. Macquarie received £1,300 in prize money after the city was looted.

In 1800, Macquarie was part of the British entourage headed by Governor Duncan that forced Mir Nasiruddin Khan of Surat to sign a treaty with the East India Company dictating the handover of that province to Company rule.

===Egypt===
In 1801, Macquarie was appointed by General David Baird as Deputy Adjutant-General of the large British-Indian expeditionary force assigned to link up with Sir Ralph Abercromby&#x27;s army to expel the French Army from Egypt. Macquarie sailed with his regiment to Egypt from India with the French already in retreat toward Alexandria. He arrived there two days after the capitulation of Alexandria to the British. Macquarie remained in Egypt for about a year during which time he met up with his brother. Macquarie contracted syphilis while in Egypt.

===Return to Britain, further duty in India===
In 1803, Macquarie returned to Britain having amassed a fortune of £20,000. His elevation to the social elite saw him meet several times with Jacob Bosanquet and the directors of the East India Company and he also had a personal introduction to King George III. He served in London as Assistant Adjutant General to Lord Harrington and was able to purchase an estate on his native Isle of Mull, which he named &quot;Jarvisfield&quot;. In 1805, Macquarie was ordered to return to India to take charge of the 86th Regiment of Foot and after arriving also became military secretary to Governor Duncan at Bombay.

In 1807 he travelled overland from India to Britain via Persia and Russia, and was very impressed by the layout and architecture of St Petersburg. Later that year, Macquarie married his third cousin Elizabeth Henrietta Campbell in Devon and took command of the 73rd Regiment in Scotland as a Lieutenant-Colonel. Macquarie&#x27;s wife gave birth to a daughter in 1808 which died in infancy.

==Governor of New South Wales==
===Arrival in Sydney===
On 8 May 1809 Macquarie was appointed to the position of Governor of New South Wales and its dependencies. He left for the colony on 22 May 1809, on HMS &quot;Dromedary&quot;, accompanied by HMS &quot;Hindostan&quot;. The 73rd Regiment of Foot came with him on the two ships. He arrived on 28 December at Sydney Cove and landed officially on 31 December, taking up his duties on the following day. In making this appointment, the British government changed its practice of appointing naval officers as governor and chose an army commander in the hope that he could secure the co-operation of the corrupt and insubordinate New South Wales Corps. Aided by the fact he arrived in New South Wales at the head of his own unit of regular troops, Macquarie was unchallenged by the New South Wales Corps, whose officers led by John Macarthur had mutinied against and imprisoned the previous governor, William Bligh.

When he arrived in Sydney in 1809 he was accompanied by his Indian &quot;slave-boy&quot; named George Jarvis, whom he had purchased in 1795 for 160 rupees at age 6 (along with a 7-year-old named Hector). Jarvis was named after his deceased wife&#x27;s brother while Hector later escaped. He wrote about them in his diaries: &quot;very fine, well-looking healthy Black Boys&quot;.

===Dealings with the NSW Corps===
Macquarie&#x27;s first task was to restore orderly, lawful government and discipline in the colony following the Rum Rebellion of 1808 against Governor William Bligh. Macquarie was ordered by the British government to arrest two of the leaders of the Rum Rebellion, John Macarthur and Major George Johnston. However, by the time that Macquarie arrived in Sydney, both Macarthur and Johnston had already sailed for England to defend themselves. Macquarie immediately set about cancelling the various initiatives taken by the rebel governmentfor example, all &quot;pardons, leases and land grants&quot; made by the rebels were revoked. However, after an avalanche of petitions from leaseholders were sent to Macquarie, he soon back-flipped and ratified them all.

Although the New South Wales Corps and its monopoly were soon ended, the military influence survived, with officers having sway over the justice system. Macquarie himself chose to keep the peace with the remaining NSW Corps officers and maintained an ambivalent attitude to the rebellion against Bligh.

===Civil reforms===
Part of Macquarie&#x27;s undertaking of bringing order to the colony was to refashion the convict settlement into an urban environment of organised towns with streets and parks. The street layout of modern central Sydney is based upon a plan established by Macquarie. The colony&#x27;s most prestigious buildings were built on Macquarie Street which he named after himself. Some of these still stand today including the &#x27;Rum Hospital&#x27; part of which now serves as the Parliament House of New South Wales. The elaborate stables which Macquarie commissioned for Government House are now part of the modern structure housing the Sydney Conservatorium of Music.

Other notable edifices built during Macquarie&#x27;s tenure include the Parramatta Female Orphan School, St James Church, and the Hyde Park Barracks. He also officially named and established Hyde Park as a public recreation area. These buildings were constructed by Macquarie in defiance of the British government&#x27;s ban on expensive public building projects in the colony and reflect the tension between Macquarie&#x27;s vision of Sydney as a Georgian city and that of powerful British colonists who saw it as not much more than a camp for cheap convict labour.

In late 1810, Macquarie toured the regions around Sydney naming and marking out the sites and street plans of future towns such as Liverpool, Windsor and Richmond. On a visit of inspection to the settlement of Hobart Town on the Derwent River in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania) in November 1811, Macquarie was appalled at the ramshackle arrangement of the town and ordered the government surveyor James Meehan to survey a regular street layout. This survey determined the form of the current centre of the city of Hobart. Another town-planning reform initiated by Macquarie was made when he ordered all traffic on New South Wales roads to keep to the left.

Macquarie is credited with producing the first official currency specifically for circulation in Australia. In 1812 he purchased 40,000 Spanish dollar coins and had a convicted forger named William Henshall cut the centres out of the coins and counter stamp them to distinguish them as belonging to the colony of New South Wales. The central plug (known as a &quot;dump&quot;) was valued at 15 pence and the rim (known as a holey dollar) became a five-shilling piece. Any forging of the new currency was proclaimed as being punishable by seven years in the Newcastle coal mines. Macquarie also encouraged the creation of the colony&#x27;s first bank, the Bank of New South Wales, in 1817.

===Social reforms===
Macquarie was given specific instructions to encourage morality and orderliness in the colony. He promoted marriage and church attendance, increased police patrols and made laws against public alcohol consumption. Central to this policy were the emancipists: convicts whose sentences had expired or who had been given conditional or absolute pardons. Macquarie wanted the ex-convicts to live reformed, law-abiding Christian lives. Initially he favoured Anglicanism only but in 1820 cautiously welcomed officially-approved Catholic priests.

Some of these emancipated convicts were either skilled professionals or had become very wealthy by operating commercial enterprises in the colony. Macquarie viewed these types of ex-convicts as ideal models of social transformation, and rewarded them by elevating their social standing and appointing them to important government positions. For example, Francis Greenway became colonial architect, Dr William Redfern became the colonial surgeon, while Andrew Thompson and Simeon Lord were appointed as magistrates.

The gentry in the colony, known as the &quot;exclusives&quot; were outraged at these appointments with some refusing to work alongside the promoted ex-convicts. However, an 1812 inquiry into the convict system in Australia by a Select committee on Transportation, supported Macquarie&#x27;s liberal policies. The committee concluded that the colony should be made as prosperous as possible so as to provide work for the convicts and to encourage them to become settlers after being given their freedom.

Macquarie also looked favourably on issuing land grants to emancipists, and in 1811 when wishing to expand British settlement to the south-west, he issued a large amount of 30 and 40 acre grants in the Appin region to ex-convicts. Later, in 1818, when expanding the colonisation in the Bathurst district, Macquarie personally selected ten settlers, many of whom were emancipists.

Obstacles to these social reforms included a severe drought in 1814, causing widespread loss of crops and livestock. Many farmers were close to insolvency with the ensuing depression. Also, the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 brought a renewed flood of both convicts and settlers to New South Wales, doubling the white population. Macquarie utilised his civic building programme to encourage employment and economic activity.

===Judicial reforms===
Macquarie&#x27;s efforts to allow emancipists to take up official positions also extended to the judicial system where, due to a lack of solicitors, convicted former lawyers such as Edward Eagar were allowed to take on civil cases. In 1814, with the establishment of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the arrival its first judge, Jeffery Hart Bent, Macquarie&#x27;s relationship with the courts became fractious. Bent, a staunch conservative, brought solicitors Frederick Garling and William Moore with him and refused to hear cases brought by ex-convict lawyers. The subsequent personal antipathy between him and Macquarie resulted in making the court unworkable. Bent complained to the British Government that Macquarie was blameworthy of authoritarian excesses, while Macquarie complained that Bent was insubordinate. As a result, Earl Bathurst, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in an effort to keep society in the colony functioning, recalled Bent to England and censured Macquarie. This situation contributed to Commissioner John Thomas Bigge being sent in 1819 to enquire into the affairs of New South Wales.

===Promotion of exploration===
Macquarie was a great sponsor of British exploration in the colony. He himself participated in a number of expeditions around the Sydney Basin and to other regions including Jervis Bay, Port Stephens, the Hunter River, Bathurst and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. He invariably named the landmarks and new settlements he came across after himself, his wife or members of the British aristocracy.

In 1813 he authorised Gregory Blaxland, William Wentworth and William Lawson to conduct their successful crossing of the Blue Mountains and become the first non-Indigenous people to view the great plains of the interior. Later that same year George Evans, directed by Macquarie to further explore this inland region, came upon and named the Macquarie River. In 1815, Macquarie ordered the establishment of Bathurst on this river, which became Australia&#x27;s first inland British settlement. Evans conducted further exploration to the south-west in 1815 at the behest of the Governor and named the Lachlan River after him.

Macquarie appointed John Oxley as surveyor-general and sent him on expeditions in 1817–18 to further explore the Lachlan River, Liverpool Plains and the north coast of New South Wales and to find suitable lands for colonisation. Oxley, following the tradition of labelling the geographic features after the Governor, named a promising coastal inlet Port Macquarie.

===Policies toward Aboriginals===
Macquarie&#x27;s policy toward Aboriginal Australians consisted of co-operation and assimilation, backed by military coercion. On arrival in the colony in 1810 Macquarie gave a speech expressing the wish that &quot;Natives of this Country...may be always treated with kindness and attention&quot;, and for the next four years very little conflict occurred. However, in the winter of 1814 a number of settlers and Aboriginal people were killed in conflict in the Nepean River region. Macquarie initially made proclamations to promote peace but also later sent an armed expedition to patrol the area.

Aiming to advance better relations, Macquarie organised a conference at Parramatta on 28 December 1814 for all Aboriginal people in the region, and in January 1815 he opened the Parramatta Native Institution for the education of Aboriginal children. Around forty Aboriginal children, some of whom were &#x27;decoyed away&#x27; from their parents and others taken during frontier conflict, became students and were taught in the British tradition by William and Elizabeth Shelley. The children seem to have been mostly well-treated and in 1819, Maria Lock topped the colony-wide examinations. However, the institution was also a conscious attempt to reduce the influence and future of Indigenous culture and may have contributed to further disillusion and hostility.

Macquarie also developed a strategy of rewarding Aboriginals who assisted the British by declaring them &#x27;chiefs of their tribe&#x27; and presenting them with a brass breast-plate (known as a gorget) engraved with their name and title even though it often did not reflect their actual clan status. Macquarie also rewarded these &#x27;chiefs&#x27; with small parcels of land set aside for the use of their families. The first receiver of these rewards was Bungaree who in 1815 was issued a gorget, a boat and 15 acres at Georges Head. In 1816, gorgets and land parcels were given to Colebee and Nurragingy by Macquarie for their role in assisting the military operations against hostile Aboriginals along the Nepean River. The practice of colonists giving gorgets to &#x27;loyal&#x27; Aboriginals continued for many decades throughout Australia.

In March 1816, considerable Aboriginal resistance was encountered especially at Silverdale where a large group of Aborigines killed four settlers with a combination of spears and stolen muskets. Macquarie ordered the mobilisation of three detachments of the military in order to go:

into the Interior and remote parts of the Colony, for the purpose of Punishing the Hostile Natives, by clearing the Country of them entirely, and driving them across the mountains; as well as if possible to apprehend the Natives who have committed the late murders and outrages, with the view of their being made dreadful and severe examples of, if taken alive. — I have directed as many Natives as possible to be made Prisoners, with the view of keeping them as Hostages until the real guilty ones have surrendered themselves, or have been given up by their Tribes to summary Justice. — In the event of the Natives making the smallest show of resistance – or refusing to surrender when called upon so to do – the officers Commanding the Military Parties have been authorized to fire on them to compel them to surrender; hanging up on Trees the Bodies of such Natives as may be killed on such occasions, in order to strike the greater terror into the Survivors.

On 17 April, the detachment of 33 grenadiers led by Captain James Wallis managed to corner a large group of Gandangara and Tharawal people near the Cataract River gorge in the upper Nepean catchment. At least 14 men, women and children were killed, some shot while others fell off the cliffs. This became known as the Appin Massacre. The corpses of two men, Cannabaygal and Dunnell, were strung up on trees as per Macquarie&#x27;s instructions, the skull of Cannabaygal later being taken to Scotland. Two surviving women and three children were taken prisoner and Macquarie rewarded Wallis for his efforts by appointing him Commandant of the Newcastle convict settlement.

Hostilities continued for most of the rest of 1816 with Macquarie proclaiming no Aborigines were allowed into the settled areas without a passport and issuing search and destroy orders for a further ten Aboriginal men. By early 1817, these actions by Macquarie forced an end to Aboriginal resistance in what is now known as the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars.

===Bigge inquiry===
Macquarie&#x27;s policies, especially his championing of the emancipated convicts and the lavish expenditure of government money on public works, aroused opposition both in the colony and in London, where the government still saw New South Wales as fundamentally a penal colony, a place to be dreaded by the convicts. Therefore, in 1819 Earl Bathurst appointed an English judge, John Bigge, to visit New South Wales and report on its administration.

Bigge consulted with the &#x27;exclusive&#x27; colonists such as John Macarthur, Samuel Marsden and Archibald Bell who were strongly against the social reforms of Macquarie. They wanted the convicts to be removed from the government building works in the towns and instead labouring on their large sheep-grazing land acquisitions. Bigge concurred with these opinions and saw that government expediture could be significantly decreased and the British wool industry strengthened if large numbers of convicts were assigned to these &#x27;men of capital&#x27; as cheap labour.

Bigge&#x27;s reports subsequently depicted Macquarie as having an error of conduct in making New South Wales a place for the convicts to reform back into society rather than a place of punishment, and stated that his policies of remediation toward the emancipated were not only &#x27;inexpedient and dangerous&#x27; but were &#x27;an act of violence&#x27; to the established colonists.

Macquarie offered his resignation several times, which was accepted in 1820 with Thomas Brisbane replacing him as governor in 1821. Macquarie served longer than any other governor but not long after, in 1824, the overall power within the role was reduced by the introduction of the New South Wales Legislative Council, Australia&#x27;s first legislative body, appointed to advise the governor.

==Return to Scotland, death and legacy==
Macquarie returned to Scotland, and died in London in 1824 while busy defending himself against Bigge&#x27;s charges. However, his reputation continued to grow after his death, especially among the emancipists and their descendants, who were the majority of the Australian population until the Australian gold rushes. Today he is regarded by many as the most enlightened and progressive of the early governors who sought to establish Australia as a country, rather than as a prison camp.

The nationalist school of Australian historians have treated him as a proto-nationalist hero. Macquarie formally adopted the name Australia for the continent, the name earlier proposed by the first circumnavigator of Australia, Matthew Flinders. The origin of the name &quot;Australia&quot; is closely associated with Macquarie who first used it in an official despatch in 1817. As well as the many geographical features named after him, many institutions in Australia such as Macquarie University in Sydney are also named in his honour. Macquarie was promoted to colonel in 1810, Brigadier-General in 1811 and major-general in 1813, while serving as governor.

Macquarie was buried on the Isle of Mull in a mausoleum near Salen with his wife, daughter and son. The grave is maintained by the National Trust of Australia and is inscribed &quot;The Father of Australia&quot;.

==Memorials==

A statue of Macquarie commissioned by the NSW Government and created by Terrance Plowright in 2012, stands at the north entrance to Hyde Park in the centre of Sydney. A nearby inscription reads: &quot;He was a perfect gentleman, a Christian and supreme legislator of the human heart.&quot; The appropriateness of the statue and the inscription have been questioned in view of his punitive expeditions against Indigenous people. On Anzac Day in April 2023, protesters vandalised the statue with graffiti alleging Macquarie had been involved in genocide; the protest drew criticism from some in the local community.

<text>Gehyra is a genus of geckos, lizards in the family &quot;Gekkonidae&quot;. Species within the genus are known as web-toed geckos or dtellas, and most bear close resemblance to geckos from the genus &quot;Hemidactylus&quot;.

==Geographic range==
&quot;Gehyra&quot; species have a wide geographic range, covering most of the Oceania and Melanesian Islands as far north as the Ryukyu Islands and Thailand.

==Description==
Dtellas are moderately sized geckos that resemble house geckos. &quot;Gehyra&quot; species have toepads and powerful claws. Like some other geckos, they have a tendency to drop strips of skin if handled carelessly. Similar to house geckos, dtellas are able to communicate with clicks or chirps, although their chirp is often quieter than that of house geckos.

<text>Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha, PC (; Isaac Leslie Belisha; 7 September 1893 – 16 February 1957) was a British Liberal, then National Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) and Cabinet Minister. He later joined the Conservative Party. He proved highly successful in modernising the British road system in 1934–1937 as Minister of Transport. As War Secretary, 1937–1940, he feuded with the commanding generals and was removed in 1940. Some writers believe anti-semitism played a role in both his dismissal and in blocking his appointment as Minister of Information.
One historian compares his strong and weak points:

His name is still widely associated in the UK with the introduction of flashing amber &quot;Belisha beacons&quot; at pedestrian crossings while he was Minister for Transport.

== Background and education ==
Hore-Belisha was born Isaac Leslie Belisha in Hampstead, London on 7 September 1893. He was the only son of the Jewish family of Jacob Isaac Belisha and his wife, Elizabeth Miriam Miers. 
His father died when he was less than one year old. In 1912 his widowed mother married Adair Hore, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Pensions. Leslie Belisha then adopted the double-barrelled surname.

Hore-Belisha was educated at Clifton College where he was in Polack&#x27;s house. He continued his studies in Paris and Heidelberg, before attending St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he was President of the Oxford Union Society. While in Heidelberg, he became a member of Burschenschaft in 1912. During the First World War he joined the British Army and served in France, Flanders and Salonika and finished the war with the rank of major in the Army Service Corps. After the war, after leaving the army, he returned to Oxford and, in 1923, qualified as a barrister.

== Political career ==

At the 1922 general election, Hore-Belisha was an unsuccessful candidate for the Liberal Party in the Plymouth Devonport constituency. However, thanks to his new political agent, Benjamin Musgrave, he won the seat at the general election the following year, and became known in Parliament as a flamboyant and brilliant speaker. 

He generally allied himself with right-wing Liberals critical of their party&#x27;s support for the Labour minority governments, joining with Sir John Simon in becoming a Liberal National upon the formation of the National Government in 1931. After the 1931 general election, Hore-Belisha was appointed a junior minister at the Board of Trade.

He remained in government when the official Liberals withdrew in September 1932 over the issue of free trade, and was promoted to Financial Secretary to the Treasury. Hore-Belisha showed considerable intelligence and drive in government, although his intense energy tended to alienate traditionalist elements who resented his status as an &quot;outsider&quot;.

=== Transport minister, 1934–1937 ===
Hore-Belisha was appointed Minister of Transport in 1934 coming to public prominence at a time when motoring was becoming available to the masses. All speed limits for motor cars had controversially been removed by the Road Traffic Act 1930 during the previous administration. There was, in 1934, a record number of road casualties in the UK, with 7,343 deaths and 231,603 injuries being recorded, with half of the casualties being pedestrians and three-quarters occurring in built-up areas. 

Shortly after being appointed, he was crossing Camden High Street when a sports car shot along the street without stopping, nearly causing him &quot;serious injury or worse&quot;. He became involved in a public-relations exercise to demonstrate how to use the new &quot;uncontrolled crossings&quot;.

Hore-Belisha&#x27;s Road Traffic Act 1934 introduced a speed limit of 30 mph for motor cars in built-up areas. The new act was vigorously opposed by many, who saw the new regulations as a removal of &quot;an Englishman&#x27;s freedom of the highway&quot;. The earlier 20 mph speed limit had been abolished in 1930 because it was universally flouted. A large backlog of court cases had made the law unenforceable. In addition, The Automobile Association (AA) and the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) had frequently been successful in defending their members against evidence from primitive speed traps.

Hore-Belisha rewrote the Highway Code and was responsible for the introduction of two innovations that led to a dramatic drop in the number of road accidents: the driving test and the Belisha beacon, named after him by the public. On his retirement, he was made vice-president of the Pedestrians&#x27; Association and, the organisation adopted a logo (since replaced) of a walking zebra crossing with Belisha Beacon.

=== Secretary of State for War, 1937–1940 ===
His success at the Ministry of Transport, in 1937, led to an appointment by Neville Chamberlain as Secretary of State for War replacing the popular Alfred Duff Cooper, who later resigned from the government over Chamberlain&#x27;s policy of appeasement. There were voices within the Conservative majority that such a high-profile appointment should not have gone to a Liberal National, and Hore-Belisha&#x27;s Conservative colleagues labelled him a warmonger. Many took to nicknaming him &quot;Horeb-Elisha&quot; or &quot;Horeb&quot; as an antisemitic pun on his race. (Horeb is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the place where the golden calf was made and to which Elijah fled.)

Upon appointing Hore-Belisha as Secretary of State, Chamberlain advised him to read B. H. Liddell Hart&#x27;s book &quot;Europe in Arms&quot;, which advocated that Britain should avoid becoming involved in a continental land war and rely on the Royal Air Force as its offensive arm. 

Impressed by the book&#x27;s arguments and under Cabinet pressure to control expenditure, Hore-Belisha formed a close partnership with Liddell Hart and sought to refocus the British Army away from the aim of raising a second British Expeditionary Force to fight in France.

Unhappy with the Army Council&#x27;s opposition to his policies, Hore-Belisha sacked Field Marshal Cyril Deverell, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, along with the Adjutant General and Master-General of the Ordnance in December 1937. Guided by Liddell Hart, he interviewed John Dill and Archibald Wavell before finally settling on Lord Gort, a relatively junior general, as Deverell&#x27;s replacement. The new team at the head of the British Army was not a success. Gort was no more enthusiastic about Hore-Belisha&#x27;s course of action than Deverell had been and objected to Liddell Hart&#x27;s continued influence. For his part by March 1939, Hore-Belisha would declare that &quot;Gort has no brain at all&quot;.

The Munich Crisis shook Hore-Belisha&#x27;s confidence that Britain would be able to avoid full-scale commitment to a continental war. In December 1938, a group of junior Conservative ministers including the Under-Secretary for War, Lord Strathcona, demanded that Chamberlain remove Hore-Belisha. The Prime Minister refused and Strathcona was sacked, but the event demonstrated Hore-Belisha&#x27;s political isolation. However, in February, he secured a major increase in budget to re-equip the British Army for continental operations. In his speech to Parliament during the March Budget Estimate, Hore-Belisha acknowledged this was a reversal of his previous policy, but still won plaudits for his plans.

Any hope of reconciliation with his military subordinates was ruined when, at a Cabinet meeting on 28 March, Hore-Belisha recommended doubling the size of the Territorial Army to demonstrate Britain&#x27;s resolve. This was announced in Parliament the next day, to the consternation of the Army Council who had not been consulted about the decision. Lord Gort, who was in France, reputedly learned of it from a newspaper. The Army was already badly short of equipment and raising the new Territorial Divisions would require transferring soldiers from the front line units.

In May, Hore-Belisha succeeded in passing the Military Training Act, the first peacetime conscription law in the United Kingdom. The Act provided for six months of full-time military training, after which men would enter the Reserve. The first cohort began their training in June. Following the outbreak of war in September it was replaced by the National Service Act.

=== Dismissal ===

In January 1940, Prime Minister Chamberlain dismissed Hore-Belisha from the War Office. He had been in an increasingly untenable position due to his disputes with the Army high command and the King and hostility from sympathisers within the public of the British Union of Fascists after Oswald Mosley claimed him to be a &quot;Jewish warmonger&quot;. By 1940, his relations with Lord Gort, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France, had deteriorated such that neither man had confidence in the other. Gort and other generals disliked Hore-Belisha&#x27;s showmanship, but their main disagreements had stemmed from the Pillbox affair, concerning the defence of France along the border with Belgium. Hore-Belisha was unpopular amongst his fellow ministers, with meetings of the War Cabinet said to be regularly tense and loud. As a result, Chamberlain agreed to replace him as Secretary of State for War.

Military antisemitism contributed to tensions between Hore-Belisha and Gort, with Henry Pownall, the chief of staff to the BEF in France and Belgium until the fall of France in May 1940, claiming in his diary that &quot;the ultimate fact is that they could never get on – you couldn&#x27;t expect two such utterly different people to do so – a great gentleman and an obscure, shallow-brained, charlatan, political Jewboy&quot;.

Initially, the Prime Minister considered Hore-Belisha for the post of Minister of Information, but decided against this when the Foreign Office raised concerns about the effect of having a Jewish politician in this position given the undercurrent of antisemitism in some sections of the public. Instead, Chamberlain offered him the post of Presidency of the Board of Trade. Hore-Belisha refused this demotion and resigned from the government.

Due to the sensitive nature of the disagreements, many MPs and political commentators were bewildered as to why the dismissal had taken place, and Hore-Belisha&#x27;s formal statement to the Commons left them little wiser. A common belief was that Hore-Belisha&#x27;s bold reforms at the War Office had been opposed by the established military commanders, often caricatured as Colonel Blimps, and that they had forced his resignation. Colin Brown wrote that Hore-Belisha&#x27;s dismissal was &quot;possibly fuelled by a desire to placate Hitler [by removing a Jew from the Cabinet] even once war had been declared&quot;, or even due to pressure by George VI upon Chamberlain because of Hore-Belisha&#x27;s previous support for Edward VIII during the abdication crisis, although the offer of alternative office and Hore-Belisha&#x27;s original appointment argue against this latter motive. Harry Defries argues that antisemitism was the root cause of the dismissal.

=== Subsequent political career ===
Hore-Belisha attempted to rebuild his career under the wartime premiership of Winston Churchill (1940–1945), but his re-appointment was blocked by a combination of his wounded intransigence and continued Conservative prejudice. He resigned from the National Liberals in 1942, sitting as a &quot;National Independent&quot; MP. In the Conservative &quot;caretaker&quot; government of 1945, he was briefly appointed Minister for National Insurance. At the 1945 general election, Hore-Belisha, still standing as a National Independent, was defeated in Devonport by the Labour candidate, Michael Foot. He, thereupon, peremptorily dismissed Musgrave, his faithful political agent, and joined the Conservative Party. In 1947, he was elected to Westminster City Council. He fought unsuccessfully in the Coventry South constituency at the 1950 general election. In 1954, he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Hore-Belisha, of Devonport in the County of Devon.

== Personal life ==
In 1944, at 51, he married Cynthia Elliot, who was a relative of the Earl of Minto. They had no children.

While leading a British parliamentary delegation to France in February 1957, he collapsed while making a speech at Hôtel de Ville de Reims, and died a few minutes later.

The cause of death was given as a cerebral haemorrhage. The barony died with him as he had no children. Lady Hore-Belisha died in July 1991, aged 75.

== Fictional role ==
H. G. Wells in &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot;, published in 1934, predicted a Second World War in which Britain would not participate but would vainly try to effect a peaceful compromise. In this vision, Hore-Belisha was mentioned as one of several prominent Britons delivering &quot;brilliant pacific speeches&quot; which &quot;echo throughout Europe&quot; but fail to end the war. The other would-be peacemakers, in Wells&#x27; vision, included Duff Cooper, Ellen Wilkinson and Randolph Churchill.

<text>Gonatodes is a genus of New World dwarf geckos of the family Sphaerodactylidae.

==Description==
The majority of the species in the genus &quot;Gonatodes&quot; are diurnally active, scansorial, and sexually dichromatic, with adult body size (snout–vent length) ranging from for known species. 
==Diet==
The diets of the various species of &quot;Gonatodes&quot; are composed mainly of very small arthropods.

==Reproduction==
Clutch size is one, with most species producing several clutches per year, and some utilizing communal egg-laying sites.

==Habitat==
Most species are humid tropical forest dwelling (some in warm lowlands, and others in somewhat cooler montane regions), with relatively fewer species utilizing more open, drier habitats at forest edge, tropical dry seasonal forest and scrub forest. Some species (usually those that use drier natural habitats) are able to utilize even more open human modified environments; in some cases including highly urbanized areas. &quot;Gonatodes&quot; usually spend most of their active hours perched anywhere from ground level to about 0.6 metres (2 feet) above ground, sometimes up to 2 or 3 metres (6.6 or 9.8 feet), on vertical or near vertical surfaces of tree trunks, tree stumps, logs and sometimes rocks (as well as on walls and house-posts for those that are able to use human altered environments). They seldom sit exposed to direct strong sunlight (they do not appear to bask), and most seem to prefer shade / filtered light with less exposure to direct sun light.

==Geographic range==
Species of &quot;Gonatodes&quot; are found in Central America including southern Mexico, a few Caribbean Islands (including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica and Union Island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines) and the northern part of South America, including Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname, parts of Brazil, Venezuela, the islands of Trinidad and Tobago, and some of the small islands just off the coast of northern South America.

==Introduced species==
Human mediated introductions have occurred with &quot;Gonatodes caudiscutatus&quot; in the Galapagos Islands and &quot;G. albogularis&quot; in Florida. In addition, some species have been transplanted by human activity to various regions within the general range of the genus where the particular species did not previously exist.

<doc id="323696" wikidata="Q244103" url="?curid=323696" title="Dwarf-tossing">
<text>Dwarf-tossing, also called midget-tossing, is a pub/bar attraction or activity in which people with dwarfism, wearing special padded clothing or Velcro costumes, are thrown onto mattresses or at Velcro-coated walls. Participants compete to throw the person with dwarfism the farthest. Dwarf-tossing was started in Australia as a form of pub entertainment in the early 1980s. A related, formerly practiced activity was dwarf-bowling, in which a person with dwarfism was placed on a skateboard and used as a bowling ball.

Since its inception in the 1980s, the activity, due to its problematic name and nature, has been highly controversial; it remains controversial in the early 21st century.

== Medical risks ==
Individuals with skeletal dysplasia, such as dwarfism, often have specific medical conditions and vulnerabilities that increase the risk of complications. Throwing or tossing individuals with a growth disorder can have serious consequences, especially in cases involving kyphosis and scoliosis.

Kyphosis is a condition where the spine bends forward, leading to a curvature of the back. Scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine. Both conditions can cause pain, limited mobility, and respiratory problems. Dwarf tossing can increase the risk of injury and exacerbate these conditions, as it applies forces to the spine and other vulnerable parts of the body.

Various medical sources and organizations have warned about the dangers of dwarf tossing for individuals with growth disorders. There are known cases where individuals with growth disorders have suffered severe injuries and even died as a result of dwarf tossing.

==Controversy==
Due to its nature and name, dwarf tossing has been controversial. The criticism centers on concerns about human dignity and the exploitation of little persons, raising questions about the appropriateness of the practice. In the 1980s, opposition to the practice of dwarf tossing began to take shape. Advocates for banning this activity argued that it objectifies the individuals involved, reducing them to mere objects used for entertainment.

Critics of dwarf tossing assert that the practice dehumanizes the participants, treating them as if they were objects or toys. This dehumanization is perceived as detrimental because it undermines the concept of inherent human dignity, suggesting that individuals can be used in a way that disregards their autonomy and respect. This perspective is supported by research highlighting the fundamental role of human dignity in moral and legal frameworks.

The moral objections to dwarf tossing are rooted in the idea that reducing individuals to throwing objects for amusement denies their humanity and respect. This concept has been explored in various contexts, where objectification for entertainment raises broader ethical concerns. The practice can be viewed as a form of exploitation, disregarding the feelings, integrity, and self-respect of the participants.

Further examination of this issue reveals a broader societal challenge, where dehumanization in various forms is concerning. The treatment of individuals as objects, even for entertainment, can have significant implications for human rights and the understanding of human dignity.

==Legality==

===Australia===
Australia is commonly thought of as the place where dwarf-tossing originated as a form of pub entertainment in the early 1980s.
Laws may prohibit dwarf-tossing implicitly, but there are not explicit laws preventing a consenting dwarf from being &quot;tossed&quot;.

===Canada===
In Ontario, Canada, the Dwarf Tossing Ban Act was introduced in 2003 by Windsor West MPP Sandra Pupatello in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. This private member&#x27;s public bill did not proceed beyond its introduction to second or third readings, nor did it receive royal assent, and therefore died at the close of the 37th Legislature. The bill proposed a fine of not more than $5,000 and/or imprisonment of not more than six months. The bill was hastily advanced in response to a dwarf-tossing contest that was held at Leopard&#x27;s Lounge in Windsor, Ontario with a dwarf nicknamed &quot;Tripod&quot;.

===France===
The mayor of the small French town of Morsang-sur-Orge prohibited dwarf-tossing. The case went through the appeal chain of administrative courts to the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot;, which found that an administrative authority could legally prohibit dwarf-tossing on grounds that the activity did not respect human dignity and was thus contrary to public order. It raised legal questions as to what was admissible as a motive for an administrative authority to ban an activity for motives of public order, especially as the &quot;conseil&quot; did not want to include &quot;public morality&quot; in public order. The ruling was taken by the full assembly and not a smaller panel—proof of the difficulty of the question. The &quot;conseil&quot; ruled similarly in another case between an entertainment company and the city of Aix-en-Provence.

The United Nations Human Rights Committee decided on 26 July 2002 that the ban was not discriminatory with respect to dwarfs. It ruled that the ban could be considered as &quot;necessary to protect public order, which brings into play considerations of human dignity&quot;.

Nevertheless, dwarf-tossing is not prohibited outright in France. The &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot; decided that a public authority could use gross infringement on human dignity as a motive of public order to cancel a spectacle, and that dwarf-tossing constituted such a gross infringement. However, it is up to individual authorities to make specific decisions regarding prohibition.

===United States===
Robert and Angela Van Etten, Florida members of the Little People of America, convinced the Florida Legislature in 1989 to make dwarf-tossing illegal. A measure banning dwarf-tossing was passed by a wide margin. The New York State Legislature later followed suit.

In 2001, Dave Flood, who appeared on the MJ Morning Show as &quot;Dave the Dwarf&quot;, filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the 1989 law allowing the state to fine or revoke the liquor license of a bar that allows dwarf-tossing. The pastime was popular in some Florida bars in the late 1980s.

In October 2011, Ritch Workman, a Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives, introduced legislation that would overturn the ban on dwarf-tossing, claiming such a ban to be an &quot;unnecessary burden on the freedom and liberties of people&quot; and &quot;an example of Big Brother government&quot;. Although not a personal advocate of the activity, Workman stated &quot;if a little person wants to make a fool out of themselves for money, they should have the same right to do so as any average sized person&quot;.

== Origin ==
The origin of dwarf tossing appears to stem from historical human fascination with throwing living beings, be it roosters, foxes, or people, as a form of entertainment. Throwing at roosters and fox tossing, also known as blood sport, illustrates the human tendency to use living beings as objects in unusual forms of amusement. Although initially considered folk sports, these customs were eventually criticized and suppressed due to ethical concerns and the well-being of the involved animals. This evolution emphasizes the relationship between human entertainment, ethics, and the treatment of living beings as objects for amusement, with contemporary societies becoming more aware of the need to respect the dignity and well-being of individuals and animals. 

==In popular culture==
The American television drama &quot;L. A. Law&quot; (season 4, episode 4, 11/23/89 &quot;The Mouse That Soared&quot;) featured a lawsuit to stop dwarf tossing at a local pub.

A scene in the 2002 film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; shows the dwarf Gimli reluctantly requesting the character Aragorn to &quot;toss&quot; him across a dangerous gap that he cannot jump. Gimli asks Aragorn not to tell &quot;the elf&quot;, their comrade Legolas, and Aragorn promises. A stunt double, Brett Beattie, was the person actually thrown in the scene. In the preceding 2001 film, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Gimli refused similar assistance, declaring, &quot;No one tosses a dwarf!&quot;, and then almost fell to his death.

In the 2013 film &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, a room full of boisterous stockbrokers can be seen taking turns hurling two dwarfs wearing helmets at a large dartboard, with the main character, Jordan Belfort, offering a $25,000 reward to the first &quot;cock-sucker to nail a bullseye&quot;. Before the film&#x27;s release, protests were made to distributor Paramount to remove the scene. The non-profit organization Little People of America released a statement stating they were &quot;angry, disappointed and concerned&quot; that the film &quot;includes dwarf tossing scenes. [...] No matter the intent of &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, any portrayal of dwarf tossing carries
the risk of condoning the objectification of and abuse against people with dwarfism. As &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; continues to play in theaters, Little People of America hopes that movie audiences, Martin Scorsese, and Leonardo DiCaprio join us in condemning dwarf tossing and the threatening behavior it promotes.&quot; In the book &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; that the film is based on, the tossing of little people is only discussed as a possibility and Belfort said (through a representative) that he merely heard from several people that they were thrown sometime after he left the firm.

<text>Lygodactylus is a genus of diurnal geckos with 82 species. They are commonly referred to as dwarf geckos. They are mainly found in Africa and Madagascar although two species are found in South America. &quot;Lygodactylus picturatus&quot;, the best known species, is found in Kenya and commonly known as the white-headed dwarf gecko. Recently, illegal importation from Tanzania of brightly colored (and critically-endangered), &quot;Lygodactylus williamsi,&quot; known as electric blue geckos, has been gaining attention for &quot;Lygodactylus&quot; geckos in the reptile trade.

Since all trade in wild-caught &quot;Lygodactylus williamsi&quot; is illegal, shipments of these geckos are often intentionally mislabelled as &quot;Lygodactylus&quot; spp. or as &quot;Lygodactylus capensis&quot;. As some customs officials have difficulty identifying members of this genus, a &quot;Lygodactylus&quot; spp. identification guide has been published online by CITES.

<doc id="323702" wikidata="Q747278" url="?curid=323702" title="Hemidactylus">
<text>Hemidactylus is a genus of the common gecko family, Gekkonidae. It has 194 described species, newfound ones being described every few years. These geckos are found in all the tropical regions of the world, extending into the subtropical parts of Africa and Europe. They excel in colonizing oceanic islands by rafting on flotsam, and are for example found across most of Polynesia. In some archipelagoes, cryptic species complexes are found. Geckos like to live in and out of houses. They have been introduced to many areas around the world.

This species is closely related to the genus &quot;Gehyra&quot;, which belongs to the same family in Gekkonidae.

The species are typically known as house geckos, due to their readiness to adapt to and coexist with humans, and can be easily encountered in human habitations.

== Taxonomy ==
This genus was originally established by Lorenz Oken in 1817 for the species at that time known as &quot;Hemidactylus tuberculosus&quot;, and now described as the tropical house gecko (&quot;Hemidactylus mabouia&quot;). The species name in turn comes from the Greek words &quot;hemi&quot; &quot;half&quot; and &quot;dáktylos&quot; &quot;fingers&quot; because its toes has split or &quot;half&quot; lamella underneath them.

==Evolution==
The origin of the genus &quot;Hemidactylus&quot; is still unclear as the higher level phylogeny is not well resolved. Moreover, much of the diversity in this group still remains to be discovered.

==Feces==
A house gecko will usually confine its excretions to one area of a house. This is sometimes considered a nuisance by home owners, and may stain certain surfaces. The feces are approximately five (5) millimeters in length, two (2) millimeters wide, and dark brown (almost black) in color.

==Description==

The dorsal lepidosis is either uniform or heterogeneous. The pupil of the eye is vertical. Males have pre-anal or femoral pores. Each finger or toe has a slender distal clawed joint, angularly bent and rising from within the extremity of the dilated portion.

The fingers and toes are free, or more or less webbed, and dilated; underneath they bear a straight line running down their lamellae, which is in a pattern resembling a paripinnate compound leaf. This leads to their other and more ambiguous common name, &quot;leaf-toed geckos&quot;, used mainly for species from South Asia and its surroundings to prevent confusion with the many &quot;leaf-toed&quot; Gekkota not in &quot;Hemidactylus&quot;.

Some members of the genus, such as &quot;H. platyurus&quot;, are able to run quadrupedally across water by a partially surface tension-dependent mechanism distinct from the bipedal gait of basilisks.

==Communication==
Like many other gecko species, species in the genus &quot;Hemidactylus&quot; are able to communicate with distinct vocalizations. Depending on the species, their vocalizations range from quiet clicks to short squeaks and chirps. For example, the Asian common house gecko (&quot;Hemidactylus frenatus&quot;) is notable for its distinctive chirping.

<text>Duggleby Howe (also known as Howe Hill, Duggleby) is one of the largest round barrows in Britain, located on the
southern side of the Great Wold Valley in the district of Ryedale, and is one of four such monuments in this area, known collectively as the Great barrows of East Yorkshire. Duggleby Howe is believed on the basis of artefacts recovered to be of Late Neolithic date, but no
radiocarbon dates are available. Howe as a place name is believed to have originated from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot;.

The monument consists of a mound, the base of which was 120 feet (37 m) in diameter. The top of the barrow was apparently truncated at some point in the past, leaving an almost-level platform some 47 feet (14 m) in diameter. On this was constructed a post mill of medieval type.
The mound was 22 feet (7 m) high at the eastern end and 18 or (5 or 6 metres) high at the western end.

The barrow lies within a roughly circular enclosure, approximately 370 metres in diameter, formed from interrupted ditches, and open to the south.
To the east of the barrow, one within the enclosure and one outside, are two ring ditches, believed to be of Bronze Age date. Although the barrow itself was long known, it was not until 1979 that the existence of the enclosure was confirmed using aerial photographs taken by D. N. Riley.

The barrow was first excavated in either 1798 or 1799 by the Reverend Christopher Sykes, but of his excavation no records remain. Beginning on
21 July 1890 J. R. Mortimer, under the sponsorship of Sir Tatton Sykes, excavated &quot;an area of 40 feet square over the centre of the barrow, and a portion of the east side&quot; over a period of more than six weeks. This excavation was re-assessed by Ian Kinnes, Timothy Schadla-Hall, Paul Chadwick and Philip Dean in 1983 to produce the interpretation presented below.

==Phases==
===Phase I===

In the first phase of activity at Duggleby Howe a shaft grave was
excavated and at the base of it was interred an adult male in a crouched
position accompanied by a Towthorpe bowl, flint cores and flint flakes.

Higher up in the fill of the shaft grave were interred an adult and an
infant, both in a crouched position. At the feet of the adult was placed
another adult&#x27;s skull. The latter skull is referred to as &#x27;cranium J&#x27; and evidence of blunt force trauma as a cause of death on both sides of the skull has led to the suggestion that it represents a very rare case of human sacrifice for British Neolithic funerary monuments.

===Phase II===

Once the shaft grave had been back-filled, the bodies of two adults, accompanied by
flint and antler tools, were laid in the hollow created by the settling of
the fill of the shaft grave.

===Phase III===

To the east of the shaft grave was then cut a shallow grave in
which was deposited another adult in a crouched position, accompanied by
flint arrowheads, flint flakes, a bone pin, and various implements formed
from boar tusk and beaver tooth.

The primary round barrow, composed of &quot;clayey or earthy matter&quot;, was
erected next. In it were included the remains of four infants, three children, an adolescent, and an adult. The mound was completed 
with a layer of &quot;small chalk grit&quot; and a thinner layer of &quot;Blue 
Kimmeridge clay&quot;.

===Phase IV===

Subsequent to the construction of the primary mound, 53 cremations were
inserted into the crest of it. None of the cremated remains were enclosed
in vessels, but instead occurred in heaps 6-18 inches (15-45 centimetres)
in diameter and 1-6 inches (2-15 centimetres) high. Because not all of
the barrow was excavated, Mortimer considered it possible that there were
equally as many cremations preserved in the untouched part of the mound.
The cremations were unaccompanied by artefacts except for three fragments
of burnt bone pin.

===Phase V===

The barrow was subsequently enlarged by the addition of &quot;roughly
quarried chalk&quot; to create the massive final mound.

Later the mound was used as the emplacement for a post-mill.

Kinnes and his colleagues see Duggleby Howe as a cemetery used
over a long period of time, representing a stratified funerary sequence for the Late Neolithic. Roy Loveday has suggested, as did J. R. Mortimer, that in fact the many burials may represent instead a sacrifice to mark the death of a powerful figure, perhaps the individual found at the base of the original shaft grave.

Mortimer&#x27;s excavation technique, although good for the time, did not
record the archaeological stratigraphy sufficiently well to allow this question to be settled.

<text>In mathematics, a Newman–Shanks–Williams prime (NSW prime) is a prime number &quot;p&quot; which can be written in the form

:formula_1

NSW primes were first described by Morris Newman, Daniel Shanks and Hugh C. Williams in 1981 during the study of finite simple groups with square order.

The first few NSW primes are 7, 41, 239, 9369319, 63018038201, … , corresponding to the indices 3, 5, 7, 19, 29, … .

The sequence &quot;S&quot; alluded to in the formula can be described by the following recurrence relation:
:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4
The first few terms of the sequence are 1, 1, 3, 7, 17, 41, 99, … . Each term in this sequence is half the corresponding term in the sequence of companion Pell numbers. These numbers also appear in the continued fraction convergents to .

<text>In abstract algebra, a finite group is a group whose underlying set is finite. Finite groups often arise when considering symmetry of mathematical or physical objects, when those objects admit just a finite number of structure-preserving transformations. Important examples of finite groups include cyclic groups and permutation groups.

The study of finite groups has been an integral part of group theory since it arose in the 19th century. One major area of study has been classification: the classification of finite simple groups (those with no nontrivial normal subgroup) was completed in 2004.

==History==

During the twentieth century, mathematicians investigated some aspects of the theory of finite groups in great depth, especially the local theory of finite groups and the theory of solvable and nilpotent groups. As a consequence, the complete classification of finite simple groups was achieved, meaning that all those simple groups from which all finite groups can be built are now known.

During the second half of the twentieth century, mathematicians such as Chevalley and Steinberg also increased our understanding of finite analogs of classical groups, and other related groups. One such family of groups is the family of general linear groups over finite fields.

Finite groups often occur when considering symmetry of mathematical or physical objects, when those objects admit just a finite number of structure-preserving transformations. The theory of Lie groups, which may be viewed as dealing with &quot;continuous symmetry&quot;, is strongly influenced by the associated Weyl groups. These are finite groups generated by reflections which act on a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The properties of finite groups can thus play a role in subjects such as theoretical physics and chemistry.

==Examples==

===Permutation groups===
The symmetric group S&quot;n&quot; on a finite set of &quot;n&quot; symbols is the group whose elements are all the permutations of the &quot;n&quot; symbols, and whose group operation is the composition of such permutations, which are treated as bijective functions from the set of symbols to itself. Since there are &quot;n&quot;! (&quot;n&quot; factorial) possible permutations of a set of &quot;n&quot; symbols, it follows that the order (the number of elements) of the symmetric group S&quot;n&quot; is &quot;n&quot;!.

===Cyclic groups===
A cyclic group Z&quot;n&quot; is a group all of whose elements are powers of a particular element &quot;a&quot; where , the identity. A typical realization of this group is as the complex roots of unity. Sending &quot;a&quot; to a primitive root of unity gives an isomorphism between the two. This can be done with any finite cyclic group.

===Finite abelian groups===

An abelian group, also called a commutative group, is a group in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements does not depend on their order (the axiom of commutativity). They are named after Niels Henrik Abel.

An arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The automorphism group of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of Georg Frobenius and Ludwig Stickelberger and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of linear algebra.

===Groups of Lie type===

A group of Lie type is a group closely related to the group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) of rational points of a reductive linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; with values in the field &quot;k&quot;. Finite groups of Lie type give the bulk of nonabelian finite simple groups. Special cases include the classical groups, the Chevalley groups, the Steinberg groups, and the Suzuki–Ree groups.

Finite groups of Lie type were among the first groups to be considered in mathematics, after cyclic, symmetric and alternating groups, with the projective special linear groups over prime finite fields, PSL(2, &quot;p&quot;) being constructed by Évariste Galois in the 1830s. The systematic exploration of finite groups of Lie type started with Camille Jordan&#x27;s theorem that the projective special linear group PSL(2, &quot;q&quot;) is simple for &quot;q&quot; ≠ 2, 3. This theorem generalizes to projective groups of higher dimensions and gives an important infinite family PSL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) of finite simple groups. Other classical groups were studied by Leonard Dickson in the beginning of 20th century. In the 1950s Claude Chevalley realized that after an appropriate reformulation, many theorems about semisimple Lie groups admit analogues for algebraic groups over an arbitrary field &quot;k&quot;, leading to construction of what are now called &quot;Chevalley groups&quot;. Moreover, as in the case of compact simple Lie groups, the corresponding groups turned out to be almost simple as abstract groups (&quot;Tits simplicity theorem&quot;). Although it was known since 19th century that other finite simple groups exist (for example, Mathieu groups), gradually a belief formed that nearly all finite simple groups can be accounted for by appropriate extensions of Chevalley&#x27;s construction, together with cyclic and alternating groups. Moreover, the exceptions, the sporadic groups, share many properties with the finite groups of Lie type, and in particular, can be constructed and characterized based on their &quot;geometry&quot; in the sense of Tits.

The belief has now become a theorem – the classification of finite simple groups. Inspection of the list of finite simple groups shows that groups of Lie type over a finite field include all the finite simple groups other than the cyclic groups, the alternating groups, the Tits group, and the 26 sporadic simple groups.

==Main theorems==

===Lagrange&#x27;s theorem===
For any finite group &quot;G&quot;, the order (number of elements) of every subgroup &quot;H&quot; of &quot;G&quot; divides the order of &quot;G&quot;. The theorem is named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange.

===Sylow theorems===
This provides a partial converse to Lagrange&#x27;s theorem giving information about how many subgroups of a given order are contained in &quot;G&quot;.

===Cayley&#x27;s theorem===

Cayley&#x27;s theorem, named in honour of Arthur Cayley, states that every group &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on &quot;G&quot;. This can be understood as an example of the group action of &quot;G&quot; on the elements of &quot;G&quot;.

===Burnside&#x27;s theorem===

Burnside&#x27;s theorem in group theory states that if &quot;G&quot; is a finite group of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;q&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are prime numbers, and &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are non-negative integers, then &quot;G&quot; is solvable. Hence each
non-Abelian finite simple group has order divisible by at least three distinct primes.

===Feit–Thompson theorem===
The Feit–Thompson theorem, or odd order theorem, states that every finite group of odd order is solvable. It was proved by 

===Classification of finite simple groups===
The classification of finite simple groups is a theorem stating that every finite simple group belongs to one of the following families:
* A cyclic group with prime order;
* An alternating group of degree at least 5;
* A simple group of Lie type;
* One of the 26 sporadic simple groups;
* The Tits group (sometimes considered as a 27th sporadic group).

The finite simple groups can be seen as the basic building blocks of all finite groups, in a way reminiscent of the way the prime numbers are the basic building blocks of the natural numbers. The Jordan–Hölder theorem is a more precise way of stating this fact about finite groups. However, a significant difference with respect to the case of integer factorization is that such &quot;building blocks&quot; do not necessarily determine uniquely a group, since there might be many non-isomorphic groups with the same composition series or, put in another way, the extension problem does not have a unique solution.

The proof of the theorem consists of tens of thousands of pages in several hundred journal articles written by about 100 authors, published mostly between 1955 and 2004. Gorenstein (d.1992), Lyons, and Solomon are gradually publishing a simplified and revised version of the proof.

==Number of groups of a given order==
Given a positive integer &quot;n&quot;, it is not at all a routine matter to determine how many isomorphism types of groups of order &quot;n&quot; there are. Every group of prime order is cyclic, because Lagrange&#x27;s theorem implies that the cyclic subgroup generated by any of its non-identity elements is the whole group.
If &quot;n&quot; is the square of a prime, then there are exactly two possible isomorphism types of group of order &quot;n&quot;, both of which are abelian. If &quot;n&quot; is a higher power of a prime, then results of Graham Higman and Charles Sims give asymptotically correct estimates for the number of isomorphism types of groups of order &quot;n&quot;, and the number grows very rapidly as the power increases.

Depending on the prime factorization of &quot;n&quot;, some restrictions may be placed on the structure of groups of order &quot;n&quot;, as a consequence, for example, of results such as the Sylow theorems. For example, every group of order &quot;pq&quot; is cyclic when are primes with not divisible by &quot;q&quot;. For a necessary and sufficient condition, see cyclic number.

If &quot;n&quot; is squarefree, then any group of order &quot;n&quot; is solvable. Burnside&#x27;s theorem, proved using group characters, states that every group of order &quot;n&quot; is solvable when &quot;n&quot; is divisible by fewer than three distinct primes, i.e. if , where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are prime numbers, and &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are non-negative integers. By the Feit–Thompson theorem, which has a long and complicated proof, every group of order &quot;n&quot; is solvable when &quot;n&quot; is odd.

For every positive integer &quot;n&quot;, most groups of order &quot;n&quot; are solvable. To see this for any particular order is usually not difficult (for example, there is, up to isomorphism, one non-solvable group and 12 solvable groups of order 60) but the proof of this for all orders uses the classification of finite simple groups. For any positive integer &quot;n&quot; there are at most two simple groups of order &quot;n&quot;, and there are infinitely many positive integers &quot;n&quot; for which there are two non-isomorphic simple groups of order &quot;n&quot;.

<text>Nu jazz (also spelt nü jazz or known as jazztronica, or future jazz) is a genre of jazz and electronic music. The music blends jazz elements with other musical styles, such as funk, electronic music, and free improvisation.

Nu jazz typically ventures further into the electronic territory than does its close cousin, acid jazz. Nu jazz can be very experimental in nature and can vary widely in sound and concept. The sound departs further from its blues roots than acid jazz does, and instead explores electronic sounds and ethereal jazz sensualities. &quot;The star of Nu jazz is the music itself and not the individual dexterity of the musicians,&quot; writes Sunday People.

== History ==
Nu jazz began with the use of electronic instruments in the 1970s, with contributions from artists like Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, and Ornette Coleman. Herbie Hancock&#x27;s work in the early 1980s, particularly his collaboration with Bill Laswell on the album &quot;Future Shock,&quot; played a pivotal role in defining the genre by incorporating electro and hip-hop rhythms. By the late 1980s, many hip-hop musicians were exploring jazz-rap, including groups like Gang Starr, The Roots, A Tribe Called Quest, and Nas. Concurrently, in the 1980s, numerous house musicians drew inspiration from jazz, especially post-bop and jazz-funk.

In the mid-1990s and early 2000s, downtempo artists such as Jazztronik, St Germain, Trüby Trio, DJ Takemura, Perry Hemus, and Jazzanova delved deeper into jazz. During the same period, producers of intelligent dance music, including notable names like Squarepusher and Spring Heel Jack, and later London Elektricity and Landslide, also showed interest in nu jazz. Techno musicians like Carl Craig and his Innerzone Orchestra project demonstrated interest in the genre. Figures from hardcore and breakcore scenes, such as Alec Empire, Nic Endo, and Venetian Snares, experimented with a harsher and more noisy variant of nu jazz. A decade later, some dubstep producers, like Boxcutter, also explored electronic jazz.

While maintaining traditional jazz forms, pianist Bugge Wesseltoft and trumpeter Nils Petter Molvær are known for their improvisations in the nu jazz style. The Cinematic Orchestra is recognized for incorporating traditional jazz elements into their musical productions alongside electronic elements. St Germain, a prominent figure in nu jazz, even sold 1.5 million copies of his album &quot;Tourist.&quot;
