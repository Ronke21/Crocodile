<text>SS &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;, named after Cape Arkona on the island of Rügen, was a large German ocean liner, later a requisitioned auxiliary ship of the Kriegsmarine (Nazi German War Navy), and finally a prison ship in the later months of World War II (1939–1945). A flagship of the Hamburg Südamerikanische Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft (&quot;Hamburg-South America Line&quot;), she made her maiden voyage on 29 October 1927, carrying passengers and cargo between Germany and the east coast of South America, and for a brief period of time she was the largest and fastest ship on the route, until one month later she was surpassed on the same Europe-South America route by the Italian liner .

In 1940, the Kriegsmarine (Nazi German War Navy) requisitioned the &quot;S.S. Cap Arcona&quot; as an accommodation ship. In 1942 she served as the set for the German propaganda feature film &quot;Titanic&quot;. In 1945 she evacuated almost 26,000 German civilian refugees from East Prussia before the advance of the Red Army.

&quot;Cap Arcona&quot;″s final use was as a prison ship. In May 1945 she was heavily laden with prisoners from Nazi concentration camps when the Royal Air Force bombed her in the western Baltic Sea, killing about 5,000 people; with more than 2,000 further casualties in the sinkings of the accompanying vessels of the prison fleet, and . This was one of the largest single-incident maritime losses of life in the Second World War.
==Building and equipment==
Blohm+Voss in Hamburg built &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;, launching and completing her in 1927. She was , overall and a beam of .

She was driven by eight steam turbines, single-reduction geared to two propeller shafts. She had three funnels, and her passenger comforts included a full-size tennis court abaft her third funnel. The ship had at least 26 lifeboats, most of which were mounted in two tiers (see image).

&quot;Cap Arcona&quot; had modern navigation and communication equipment. She was equipped for submarine signalling which allowed a ship to hear acoustic signals from aids to navigation. She also had wireless direction finding equipment, and from 1934 she had an echo sounding device and a gyrocompass.

==Peacetime service==
&quot;Cap Arcona&quot; entered service in 1927, commencing her maiden voyage on Hamburg Süd&#x27;s route to Buenos Aires 29 October. She joined the older liner on the route, which had been Hamburg Süd&#x27;s flagship until &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;″s completion. &quot;Cap Polonio&quot; was laid up in 1931 and scrapped in 1935, leaving &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; as Hamburg Süd&#x27;s sole prestige ship on its South American route.

On 6 October 1932 &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; collided with the French cargo ship in the North Sea off the Elbe 4 Lightship. &quot;Agen&quot; was beached, but later was refloated and escorted into Hamburg, Germany.

==Accommodation ship==
In 1940 the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) requisitioned &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;, had her painted overall grey and used her in the Baltic Sea as an accommodation ship in Gotenhafen (now Gdynia).

In 1942 &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; was used as a stand-in for , supplying exterior locations for the filming of the Nazi film version of the disaster in the harbour of Gotenhafen. The production partially repainted the ship&#x27;s funnels and hull in White Star Line colors for filming. The film was completed, but the original director, Herbert Selpin, was arrested for disparaging remarks he made about Kriegsmarine sailors. His later self-destructive interrogation at the hands of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels all but sealed his fate. He was found the next day hanged in his cell by his suspenders.

==Evacuation of East Prussia==
On 31 January 1945, the Kriegsmarine reactivated her for Operation Hannibal, where she was used to transport 25,795 German soldiers and civilians from East Prussia to safer areas in western Germany. By then these trips were made very dangerous by mines and Soviet Navy submarines. On 30 January , carrying around 10,000 passengers and crew, was torpedoed by the and sank in 40 minutes. An estimated 9,400 people died. Early on the morning of 11 February, the same submarine torpedoed the on its way to Copenhagen with wounded and bed-ridden soldiers and civilian passengers, killing over 4,000 people. On 20 February, &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;″s captain, Johannes Gertz, shot himself in his cabin while berthed in Copenhagen rather than face another trip back to Gotenhafen.

On 30 March 1945, &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; finished her third and last trip between Gdynia and Copenhagen, carrying 9,000 soldiers and refugees. However, her turbines were completely worn out. They could only be partially repaired and her days of long-distance travel were over. She was decommissioned, returned to her owners Hamburg-Süd and ordered out of Copenhagen Harbour to Neustadt Bay.

== Prison ship and sinking==
During March and April 1945, concentration camp prisoners from Scandinavian countries had been transported from all over the German Reich to the Neuengamme concentration camp near Hamburg, in the White Bus programme coordinated through the Swedish Red Crosswith prisoners of other nationalities displaced to make room for them. Eventually Heinrich Himmler agreed that these Scandinavians, and selected others regarded as less harmful to Germany, could be transported through German-occupied Denmark, north to freedom in neutral Sweden. Then between 16 and 28 April 1945, the Neuengamme camp was systematically emptied of all its remaining prisoners, together with other groups of concentration camp inmates and Soviet P.O.W.s; with the intention that they would be relocated to a secret new camp, either on the Baltic Sea island of Fehmarn; or at Mysen in German-occupied Norway where preparations were put in hand to house them under the control of concentration camp guards evacuated from Sachsenhausen. In the interim, they were to be concealed from the advancing British and Canadian military forces from liberated Netherlands, along the North Sea coast, across northern Germany towards Denmark and the Baltic; and for this purpose the &quot;SS&quot; assembled a prison flotilla of decommissioned ships in the Bay of Lübeck, consisting of the requisitioned former civilian passenger ocean liners &quot;S.S. Cap Arcona&quot; and , the freighter , and the motor launch . Since the steering motors were out of use in the &quot;S.S. Thielbek&quot; and the turbines were out of use on the &quot;S.S. Cap Arcona&quot;, so then the smaller &quot;S.S. Athen&quot; was used to transfer prisoners from Lübeck to the larger vessels and in between ships; they were locked below decks and in the holds, and denied food and medical attention.

On 30 April 1945 the two Swedish ships &quot;Magdalena&quot; and &quot;Lillie Matthiessen&quot;, previously employed as support vessels for the White Bus evacuations, made a final rescue trip to the Bay of Lübeck and back. Amongst the prisoners rescued were some transferred from the prison flotilla. On the evening of 2 May 1945 more prisoners, mainly women and children from the Stutthof and Mittelbau-Dora camps were loaded onto barges and brought out to the anchored vessels; although, as the &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; refused to accept any more prisoners, over eight hundred were returned to the beach at Neustadt in the morning of 3 May, where around five hundred were killed in their barges by machine-gunning, or beaten to death on the beach, their German SS guards then seeking to make their escape unencumbered by &quot;excess baggage&quot;.

The order to transfer the prisoners to the prison ships had come from Gauleiter Karl Kaufmann in Hamburg. Marc Buggeln has challenged Kaufmann&#x27;s subsequent claim that he had been acting on orders from SS Headquarters in Berlin, arguing that the decision in fact resulted from political and business pressures from leading industrialists in Hamburg, who were already at this stage plotting with Kaufmann to hand the city over to approaching British forces undefended and unharmed, and who consequently wished to whitewash away (literally so in the case of the Neuengamme concentration camp) all evidence for the prisoners&#x27; former presence within the city and its industries.

By early May however, any relocation plans had been scotched by the rapid British military advance to the Baltic; so the SS leadership, which had moved to Flensburg on 28 April, discussed scuttling the ships with the prisoners still captive aboard. Later, at a war crimes tribunal, Gauleiter Kaufmann claimed that the prisoners were intended to be sent to Sweden, although, as none of the ships carried any exterior Red Cross hospital ship markings, nor were they even seaworthy, this was scarcely credible. Georg-Henning Graf von Bassewitz-Behr, Hamburg&#x27;s last Higher SS and Police Leader (HSSPF), testified at the same trial that the prisoners were in fact to be killed &quot;in compliance with Himmler&#x27;s orders&quot;. Kurt Rickert, who had worked for Bassewitz-Behr, testified at the Hamburg War Crimes Trial that he believed the ships were to be sunk by Kriegsmarine submarine U-boats or Luftwaffe aircraft. Eva Neurath, who was present in Neustadt, and whose husband survived the disaster, said she was told by a police officer that the ships held convicts and were going to be blown up.

On 2 May 1945, the British Second Army discovered the empty camp at Neuengamme, and reached the coastal towns of Lübeck and Wismar. No. 6 Commando, 1st Special Service Brigade commanded by Brigadier Derek Mills-Roberts, and the 11th Armoured Division, commanded by Major-General Philip Roberts, entered Lübeck without resistance. Lübeck contained a permanent International Red Cross and Red Crescent offices in its function as a Red Cross port, and Mr. De Blonay of the International Committee of the Red Cross informed Major-General Roberts that 7,000 to 8,000 prisoners were aboard ships off-shore in the Bay of Lübeck.
In the afternoon of 3 May 1945, the British 5th reconnaissance regiment advanced northwards to Neustadt, witnessing the ships burning off-shore in the bay and rescuing some severely emaciated prisoners on the beach at Neustadt, but otherwise finding mostly the bodies of women and children who had died that morning.

==Sinking==
On 3 May 1945, three days after Nazi German dictator Hitler&#x27;s suicide in Berlin, and only one day before the unconditional surrender of the German troops in northwestern Germany at Lüneburg Heath to British Army commander Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery (1887–1976), &quot;S.S. Cap Arcona&quot;, &quot;S.S. Thielbek&quot;, and the passenger liner &quot;S.S. Deutschland&quot; were attacked as part of general strikes on shipping in the Baltic Sea by Royal Air Force (R.A.F.) Hawker Typhoon fighter warplanes of No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group of the 2nd Tactical Air Force. Through secret code-breaking of Ultra Intelligence, the Western Allies had become aware that most of the Nazi German SS leadership and former concentration camp commandants had gathered with Heinrich Himmler in Flensburg, hoping to contrive an escape northward to remaining German-occupied Norway. The western allies had intercepted orders from Hitler&#x27;s designated successor with the rump Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz government, also at Flensburg, that the SS leadership were to be facilitated in escaping Allied captureor otherwise issued with false Kriegsmarine naval uniforms to conceal their identitiesas Admiral Dönitz sought, while surrendering, to maintain the fiction that his administration had been free from involvement in the concentration camps, or in Hitler&#x27;s policies of genocide and the revealing Holocaust.

The British R.A.F. military aircraft were from the units of No. 184 Squadron, No. 193 Squadron, No. 263 Squadron, No. 197 Squadron RAF, and No. 198 Squadron. Besides four 20 mm cannon, these Hawker Typhoon Mark 1B fighter-bombers carried either eight HE &quot;60-lb&quot; RP-3 unguided rockets or two bombs.

None of the prison flotilla were painted / marked with Red Cross symbols (although the &quot;Deutschland&quot; had previously been intended as a hospital ship, and retained one white painted funnel with a red cross), and all prisoners were concealed below deck, so the pilots in the attacking force were unaware that they were laden with concentration camp survivors. Although Swedish and Swiss Red Cross officials had informed British intelligence on 2 May 1945 of the presence of large numbers of prisoners on ships at anchor in Lübeck Bay, this vital information was not passed on. The R.A.F. commanders ordering the strike believed that a flotilla of ships was being prepared in Lübeck Bay, to accommodate leading SS personnel fleeing to German-controlled Norway in accordance with Admiral Dönitz&#x27;s orders. &quot;The ships are gathering in the area of Lübeck and Kiel. At S.H.A.E.F. (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, commanded by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower), it is believed that important Nazis who have escaped from Berlin to Flensburg are onboard, and are fleeing to Norway or neutral countries&quot;.

Equipped with lifejackets from locked storage compartments, most of the SS guards managed to jump overboard from &quot;S.S. Cap Arcona&quot;. German trawlers sent to rescue &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;″s crew members and guards managed to save 16 sailors, 400 German SS men, and 20 SS women. Only 350 of the 5,000 former concentration camp inmates aboard &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; survived. From 2,800 prisoners on board the &quot;S.S. Thielbek&quot; only 50 were saved; whereas all 2,000 prisoners on the &quot;S.S. Deutschland&quot; were safely taken off onto the &quot;S.S. Athen&quot;, before the &quot;Deutschland&quot; capsized.

R.A.F. Pilot Allan Wyse of No. 193 Squadron recalled, &quot;We used our cannon fire at the chaps in the water... we shot them up with 20 mm cannons in the water. Horrible thing, but we were told to do it and we did it. That&#x27;s war.&quot;

Severely damaged and set on fire, the &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; eventually capsized. Photos of the burning ships, listed as &quot;Deutschland&quot;, &quot;Thielbek&quot;, and &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;, and of the emaciated prisoner survivors swimming in the very cold Baltic Sea waters, around , were taken on a reconnaissance mission over the Bay of Lübeck by F-6 Mustang (the photo-reconnaissance version of the P-51) of the Allied United States Army Air Forces (USAAF)&#x27;s 18th / 161st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron around 1700 hrs, shortly after the attack.

On 4 May 1945, a British reconnaissance plane also took photos of the two wrecks, &quot;Thielbek&quot; and &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;, With the Bay of Neustadt being shallow. The capsized hulk of &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; later drifted ashore, and the remains of the beached wreck was finally broken up and scrapped four years later in 1949. For weeks after the attack, bodies of victims washed ashore, where they were collected and buried in mass graves at Neustadt in Holstein, Scharbeutz and Timmendorfer Strand. Parts of skeletons washed ashore occasionally over the next 30 years, with the last casualty find occurring in 1971.

The prisoners aboard the ships were of at least 30 different nationalities: American, Belarrussian, Belgian, Canadian, Czechoslovakian, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxembourger, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Swiss, Ukrainian, and possibly others.

<text>The Deipnosophistae (, &quot;Deipnosophistaí&quot;,  , where &quot;sophists&quot; may be translated more loosely as ) is a work written in Ancient Greek by Athenaeus of Naucratis. It is a long work of literary, historical, and antiquarian references set in Rome at a series of banquets held by the protagonist for an assembly of grammarians, lexicographers, jurists, musicians, and hangers-on.

==Title==
The Greek title &quot;Deipnosophistaí&quot; () is a compound of &#x27; ( ) and &quot;sophistḗs&quot; ( ). It and its English derivative &quot;s&quot; thus describe people who are skilled at dining, particularly the refined conversation expected to accompany Greek symposia. However, the term is shaded by the harsh treatment accorded to professional teachers in Plato&#x27;s Socratic dialogues, which made the English term &#x27; into a pejorative.

In English, Athenaeus&#x27;s work usually known by its Latin form &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; but is also variously translated as The Deipnosophists, Sophists at Dinner, The Learned Banqueters, The Banquet of the Learned, Philosophers at Dinner, or The Gastronomers.

==Contents==
The &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; professes to be an account, given by Athenaeus to his friend Timocrates, of a series of banquets held at the house of Larensius, a scholar and wealthy patron of the arts. It is thus a dialogue within a dialogue, after the manner of Plato, although each conversation is so long that, realistically, it would occupy several days. Among the numerous guests, Masurius, Zoilus, Democritus, Galen, Ulpian and Plutarch are named, but most are probably to be taken as fictitious personages, and the majority take little or no part in the conversation. If Ulpian is identical with the famous jurist, the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; must have been written after his death in 223; but the jurist was murdered by the Praetorian Guard, whereas Ulpian in Athenaeus dies a natural death.
Prosopographical investigation, however, has shown the possibility of identifying several guests with real persons from other sources;
the Ulpian in the dialog has also been linked to the renowned jurist&#x27;s father.

The work is invaluable for providing fictionalized information about the Hellenistic literary world of the leisured class during the Roman Empire. To the majority of modern readers, even more useful is the wealth of information provided in the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; about earlier Greek literature. In the course of discussing classic authors, the participants make quotations, long and short, from the works of about 700 earlier Greek authors and 2,500 separate writings, many of them otherwise unrecorded (such as the swallow song of Rhodes). Food and wine, luxury, music, sexual mores, literary gossip and philology are among the major topics of discussion, and the stories behind many artworks such as the Venus Kallipygos are also transmitted in its pages.

=== Characters ===
In addition to the narrator Athenaeus, the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; includes several characters. This includes Aemilian of Mauretania, Alcides of Alexandria, Amoebeus, Arrian, Cynulcus, Daphnus of Ephesus, Democritus of Nicomedia, Dionysocles, Galen of Pergamum, Larensius, Leonides of Elis, Magnus, Masurius, Myrtilus of Thessaly, Palamedes the Eleatic, Philadelphus of Ptolemais, Plutarch of Alexandria, Pontian of Nicomedia, Rufinus of Nicaea, Ulpian of Tyre, Varus, and Zoilus.

===Food and cookery===

The &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; is an important source of recipes in classical Greek. It quotes the original text of one recipe from the lost cookbook by Mithaecus, the oldest in Greek and the oldest recipe by a named author in any language. Other authors quoted for their recipes include Glaucus of Locri, Dionysius, Epaenetus, Hegesippus of Tarentum, Erasistratus, Diocles of Carystus, Timachidas of Rhodes, Philistion of Locri, Euthydemus of Athens, Chrysippus of Tyana, Paxamus and Harpocration of Mende. It also describes in detail the meal and festivities at the wedding feast of Caranos. 

===Drink===
In expounding on earlier works, Athenaeus wrote that Aeschylus &quot;very improperly&quot; introduces the Greeks to be &quot;so drunk as to break their vessels about one another&#x27;s heads&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;This is the man who threw so well
The vessel with an evil smell
And miss&#x27;d me not, but dash&#x27;d to shivers
The pot too full of steaming rivers
Against my head, which now, alas! sir,
Gives other smells besides macassar.&lt;/poem&gt;

=== First patents ===
Athenaeus described what may be considered the first patents (i.e. exclusive right granted by a government to an inventor to practice his/her invention in exchange for disclosure of the invention). He mentions that several centuries BC, in the Greek city of Sybaris (located in what is now southern Italy), there were annual culinary competitions. The victor was given the exclusive right to prepare his dish for one year. Such a thing would have been unusual at the time because Greek society at large did not recognize exclusivity in inventions or ideas.

==Survival and reception==
The &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; was originally in fifteen books. The work survives in one manuscript from which the whole of books 1 and 2, and some other pages too, disappeared long ago. An &quot;Epitome&quot; or abridgment (to about 60%) was made in medieval times, and survives complete: from this it is possible to read the missing sections, though in a disjointed form.

The English polymath Sir Thomas Browne noted in his encyclopaedia &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot;:

:Athenæus, a delectable Author, very various, and justly stiled by Casaubon, &quot;Græcorum Plinius&quot;. There is extant of his, a famous Piece, under the name of &quot;Deipnosophista&quot;, or &quot;Coena Sapientum&quot;, containing the Discourse of many learned men, at a Feast provided by Laurentius. It is a laborious Collection out of many Authors, and some whereof are mentioned no where else. It containeth strange and singular relations, not without some spice or sprinkling of all Learning. The Author was probably a better Grammarian then Philosopher, dealing but hardly with Aristotle and Plato, and betrayeth himself much in his Chapter &quot;De Curiositate Aristotelis&quot;. In brief, he is an Author of excellent use, and may with discretion be read unto great advantage: and hath therefore well deserved the Comments of Casaubon and Dalecampius.

Browne&#x27;s interest in Athenaeus reflects a revived interest in the &quot;Banquet of the Learned&quot; amongst scholars following the publication of the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; in 1612 by the Classical scholar Isaac Casaubon. Browne was also the author of . By the nineteenth century however, the poet James Russell Lowell in 1867 characterized the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; and its author thus:
:the somewhat greasy heap of a literary rag-and-bone-picker like Athenaeus is turned to gold by time.

Modern readers question whether the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; genuinely evokes a literary symposium of learned disquisitions on a range of subjects suitable for such an occasion, or whether it has a satirical edge, rehashing the cultural clichés of the urbane literati of its day.

=== Modern editions ===
The first critical edition in accordance to the principles of classical philology was published by German scholar Georg Kaibel in 1887–1890 in the &quot;Bibliotheca Teubneriana&quot;; this three-volume set remained the authoritative text for about 120 years and the only complete critical text. Charles Burton Gulick translated the entire text into English for the &quot;Loeb Classical Library&quot;.

In 2001, a team of Italian classical scholars led by Luciano Canfora (then Professor of Classical Philology, now Emeritus, University of Bari) published the first complete Italian translation of the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot;, in a luxury edition with extensive introduction and commentary. A digital edition of Kaibel&#x27;s text, with search tools and cross-references between Kaibel&#x27;s and Casaubon&#x27;s texts and digitalized indexes and &quot;Dialogi Personae&quot;, was put online by Italian philologist Monica Berti and her team, currently working at the Alexander von Humboldt University. In 2001, Eleonora Cavallini (Professor of Greek, University of Bologna) published a translation and commentary on Book 13. In 2010, Gabriele Burzacchini (Professor of Greek, University of Parma) published a translation and commentary of Book 1 found among the unpublished studies of the late Enzo Degani (formerly Professor of Greek in the University of Bologna); Burzacchini himself translated and commented Book 5 in more recent years.

In 2006, American classical philologist S. D. Olson renewed Loeb text thanks to a new collation of the manuscripts and the progression of critical studies on Athenaeus and newly translated and commented the whole work; in 2019, the same started a new critical edition for the &quot;Bibliotheca Teubneriana&quot; inclusive of the &quot;Epitome&quot;, also edited in parallel volumes.

<text>Gina Riley (born 6 May 1961) is a retired Australian actress, writer, singer and comedian, known for portraying Kim Craig in the television series &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;, and for her work in musical theatre.
==Career==

===Television and film===
Riley became a popular television performer in the sketch shows &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, its successor &quot;Full Frontal&quot;, &quot;Big Girl&#x27;s Blouse&quot; and &quot;Something Stupid&quot;. In the latter she was also a producer and writer. On &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, Gina Riley sent-up such singers as Tina Arena, Paula Abdul, Bette Midler, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and Dannii Minogue as well as Australian personalities Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Jacki MacDonald. She later appeared in &quot;The Games&quot;, a spoof behind-the-scenes look at the organising committee of the Sydney Olympics.

She has enjoyed great success as Kim Craig in &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;, written and created by Riley and her long-time writing partner and friend Jane Turner. Riley also works frequently with Magda Szubanski.

Riley starred as Kim in the &quot;Kath and Kim&quot; feature film &quot;Kath &amp; Kimderella&quot;. The film opened in Australia on 6 September 2012 and despite negative reviews from critics it was a box office success having grossed $6,150,771.

In 2015, Riley appeared in an episode of &quot;Please Like Me&quot;.

In 2022, Riley appeared alongside members of the cast in a &quot;Kath and Kim&quot; special that screened on Channel 7, which included new skits and unseen footage from the series.

===Stage===
In 1987, Riley played the part of &#x27;Chrissie&#x27; (loosely based on rock singer Chrissy Amphlett) in Phil Motherwell&#x27;s musical play &quot;Fitzroy Crossing&quot; which enjoyed successful seasons and rave reviews at LaMama Theatre, in Carlton, Victoria. The music for the play was composed by Joe Dolce.

Riley also had roles in musical theatre. In 1992 and 1993, she appeared on stage as Janet in &quot;The New Rocky Horror Show&quot;; she is included on the cast album. In 1994, she played Trina in Sydney Theatre Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Falsettos&quot;, winning a Green Room Award for its Melbourne season. In 1998, she played The Baker&#x27;s Wife in a Melbourne Theatre Company production of &quot;Into the Woods&quot;. In 2009, she played Matron &#x27;Mama&#x27; Morton in a production of &quot;Chicago&quot;.

In 2019, Riley starred as Mrs. Lovett in &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; opposite Anthony Warlow.

==Personal life==
Riley is married to Rick McKenna. They are parents to Max McKenna (born 1996) a singer and actor who portrayed Muriel in the original Sydney production of &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; in 2017 and starred as Zoe Murphy in the &quot;Dear Evan Hansen&quot; US National Tour in 2018. Max identifies as trans non-binary.

In March 2013 Riley revealed she was being treated for breast cancer. It was later reported that she has since made a full recovery.

Riley makes relatively few public appearances as herself. One notable exception was on &quot;Enough Rope&quot; with Andrew Denton, where she and Turner both appeared as themselves.

<doc id="332538" wikidata="Q200577" url="?curid=332538" title="Sean Paul">
<text>Sean Paul Ryan Francis Henriques (born 9 January 1973) is a Jamaican dancehall musician. Paul&#x27;s first album, &quot;Stage One&quot;, was released in 2000. He gained international fame with his second album, &quot;Dutty Rock&quot;, in 2002. Its single &quot;Get Busy&quot; topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the United States, as did &quot;Temperature&quot;, off his third album, &quot;The Trinity&quot; (2005).

Paul frequently invokes the nickname &quot;Chanderpaul&quot;, originating from the similarity between his first two names and cricketer Shivnarine Chanderpaul. In the Vice documentary &quot;The Story of &#x27;Get Busy&#x27; by Sean Paul&quot;, when asked &quot;How did you become &#x27;Sean Da Paul&#x27;&quot;, Paul recalls how others would call him Chan-der-paul, and the name stuck. He then started saying it in shows and recordings.

Most of his albums have been nominated for Grammy Awards for Best Reggae Album, with &quot;Dutty Rock&quot; winning the award. Paul has been featured in many other singles, including chart-toppers &quot;Baby Boy&quot; by Beyoncé, &quot;Breathe&quot; by Blu Cantrell, &quot;What About Us&quot; by The Saturdays, &quot;Rockabye&quot; by Clean Bandit, &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; by Sia, and &quot;Fuego&quot; by DJ Snake. &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; and &quot;Rockabye&quot;, along with Paul&#x27;s own &quot;No Lie&quot; (2016), each have over 1 billion views on YouTube, with &quot;Rockabye&quot; having reached over 2.7 billion views.

==Early life==
Sean Paul Ryan Francis Henriques was born in Kingston on 9 January 1973. His mother Frances, a painter, is of English and Chinese Jamaican descent. His Portuguese paternal great-grandfather&#x27;s Sephardic Jewish family emigrated from Portugal to Jamaica in the 17th century. Paul’s father also has Afro-European ancestry. Paul&#x27;s father, Garth Henriques, was believed to be descended from Portuguese horse thieves who were fleeing from bounty hunters in a ship that sank in Jamaica.

Paul was raised as a Catholic, although he also attended the Jewish private school Hillel Academy in Jamaica. Several members of his family are swimmers. His grandfather was on the first Jamaican men&#x27;s national water polo team. His father also played water polo for the team in the 1960s, and competed in long-distance swimming, while Paul&#x27;s mother was a butterfly swimmer. When Paul was 15, his father was arrested on charges of manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison; he was released for good behavior when Paul was 19.

Paul played for the national water polo team from the age of 13 to 21, when he gave up the sport in order to launch his musical career. He attended Wolmer&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School and the College of Arts, Science, and Technology, now known as the University of Technology, where he was trained in commerce with an aim of pursuing an occupation in swimming. In 1992, Paul worked as a bank teller and enrolled in a hotel-management program, learning the basics of French cuisine.

==Career==
===1994–2000: Early beginnings and rise to fame===
In 1994, Paul appeared in Carrot Jetter&#x27;s music video &quot;Nice Time&quot;.

Zachary Harding told his brother, Jeremy, about a singer that he had heard perform live at a small open mic event in Kingston, who sounded a lot like dancehall deejay and toaster Super Cat. Jeremy eventually met the singer when Paul came by his studio to ask for some advice. During the meeting, Paul recorded a vocal over Harding&#x27;s rhythm track and in the process created the song &quot;Baby Girl&quot;. Jeremy subsequently became Paul&#x27;s manager and producer.

Paul began hanging out at the studio every day, and the pair collaborated on several more tracks. When they recorded &quot;Infiltrate&quot; they decided they had something good enough to get on the radio. As Paul started to attract local attention, Harding began looking after his affairs. He later told HitQuarters that his support of Paul&#x27;s fledgling career initially led him assuming the roles of &quot;DJ, manager, road manager, and security-guard&quot;.

In 1997, Paul collaborated with singer Spanner Banner on the song &quot;Ladies Man&quot;.

Paul made a cameo appearance in the 1998 film &quot;Belly&quot; on stage performing. He made a successful collaboration with DMX and Mr. Vegas, &quot;Top Shotter&quot;, to the soundtrack of the film.

In 2000, Paul released his debut album, &quot;Stage One&quot; with VP Records. In the same year, Paul collaborated with Canadian rapper Kardinal Offishall and singer July Black on the song &quot;Money Jane&quot; from Offishall&#x27;s album &quot;Quest for Fire: Firestater, Vol. 1&quot;.

===2001–2015: Atlantic Records deal and international success===

In 2001, Paul continued his work with manager and producer Jeremy Harding, Paul released a single &quot;Gimme the Light&quot; after writing and recording his lyrics to the &quot;Buzz&quot; riddim, the single turned out to be a nationwide success in Jamaica and eventually became a worldwide smash hit in 2002, ultimately reaching number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the early crossover momentum of the single would help Paul secure a record deal with Atlantic Records in a joint venture deal with his label VP Records, the single would then appear on his second studio album, &quot;Dutty Rock&quot; which was released in November 2002. All of its latter hit singles would also receive heavy airplay and rotation on MTV and BET.

In early 2003, the second single &quot;Get Busy&quot; was released and would end up topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 months later, making it Paul&#x27;s first number-one hit, it was also the first ever dancehall song to top the chart. &quot;Dutty Rock&quot; became a worldwide commercial success, peaking in the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and eventually selling over six million copies worldwide. &quot;Dutty Rock&quot; won the Best Reggae Album at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in 2004. &quot;Get Busy&quot; was also nominated for Best Male Rap Solo Performance in that year. Simultaneously, Paul was featured on Beyoncé&#x27;s U.S. number-one hit song &quot;Baby Boy&quot; and Blu Cantrell&#x27;s &quot;Breathe&quot;, although didn&#x27;t perform well in the United States but was a massive hit in Europe. Both helped to push his reputation further still in the United States. This album not only further popularized dancehall music in the 2000s, but also helped developed and popularized the genre of dancehall pop, a musical fusion between the rhythmic styles and melodies of dancehall and pop music.

Paul&#x27;s third album &quot;The Trinity&quot; was released on 27 September 2005. The album debuted at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, breaking records with its first-week sales for a reggae/dancehall artist, eventually going Platinum in the United States and selling 4 million copies worldwide. The album produced five big hits, &quot;We Be Burnin&#x27;&quot;, Ever Blazin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;(When You Gonna) Give It Up to Me&quot; (featuring Keyshia Cole), &quot;Never Gonna Be the Same&quot;, and the U.S. chart-topping smash hit &quot;Temperature&quot;, making it his third number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with &quot;Temperature&quot; becoming one of his signature hits. The video of &quot;(When You Gonna) Give It Up to Me&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Step Up&quot; in 2006. He was nominated for four awards at the 2006 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, including Male Artist of the Year, Rap Artist of the Year, Hot 100 Single of the Year, and Pop 100 Single of the Year for &quot;Temperature&quot;.

Also in 2014, Paul was featured on the official English-language version of long-running Latin American chart-topper &quot;Bailando&quot; by Enrique Iglesias featuring Gente de Zona and Descemer Bueno. The video for the English version was shot concurrently with the video for the Spanish version in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. The English version reached top 10 status in the United States and topping the charts of several other countries.

Paul appeared on the EP &quot;Apocalypse Soon&quot; by electronic music group Major Lazer, on the track &quot;Come On to Me&quot;, which was released as the second single from the album, after &quot;Aerosol Can&quot;, a collaboration with Pharrell Williams. He also collaborated with Nigerian singer Timaya on a remix of his song &quot;Bum Bum&quot;. An accompanying video, directed by Shutah Films, was released online on 11 April. On 6 July 2015, Paul released the music video for his song &quot;Take It Low&quot; on the album &quot;Full Frequency&quot;.

=== 2016–2018: New label and commercial resurgence ===
Paul had already become an independent artist after parting ways with Atlantic Records in September 2014. Under new management of Jules Dougall of Dougall Group and Steve &quot;Urchin&quot; Wilson, Paul enjoyed a commercial resurgence in his career throughout 2016 after being featured on Australian singer Sia&#x27;s remix version of her song &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot;, it topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making it Paul&#x27;s first number-one hit on the chart since 2006. The song was also a global success, reaching number one in more than 15 other countries. It reportedly ended up becoming the most Shazamed song of 2016.

Following this resurgence, Paul signed a new record deal with Island Records in July 2016.

In October 2016, Clean Bandit released the song &quot;Rockabye&quot;, which features Paul and English singer Anne-Marie. It peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and spent nine consecutive weeks at number one of the UK Singles Chart, and gained the coveted Christmas number one. The song would go on to become a massive global hit in 2017, reaching number one in 18 other countries.

In November 2016, Paul cited Toots and the Maytals as inspiration when it comes to his own personal career longevity by saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen some great people in my industry, you know, people like Toots... Toots and the Maytals. Toots he&#x27;s a great reggae artist and he&#x27;s still doing it... He&#x27;s up there in years and he&#x27;s doing it. Those kind of artists inspire me. I know I&#x27;m just going to keep on doing music as long as I can.&quot;

On 18 November 2016, he released a new single &quot;No Lie&quot; (featuring Dua Lipa), which served as the lead single from his EP &quot;Mad Love the Prequel&quot;, which would be released in 2018, making it his first project release with Island Records. The song would eventually become a global phenomenon over the following six years after its release, it became a top-ten hit in 10 different countries and would end up becoming his most streamed song across streaming platforms, the music video, directed by Tim Nackashi, also surpassed 1 billion views on YouTube in April 2022, making it his most popular music video.

One of the few other singles off the EP, &quot;Mad Love&quot;, a collaboration with David Guetta, which features singer Becky G, would also make a global impact on the charts, peaking within the top 50 in multiple continents.

In 2018, Paul featured in a bilingual remix of CNCO&#x27;s song &quot;Hey DJ&quot;, alongside American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor, which was released on November 9, 2018, by Sony Music Latin.

In March 2019, Paul collaborated with Colombian singer J Balvin on a bilingual song called &quot;Contra La Pared&quot;, the song peaked within the top 15 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart, making it his seventh entry on the chart. It was also a major hit in Spain, peaking in the top 10 on the nation&#x27;s chart and was a top 30 hit in both Colombia and Argentina.

Paul had suggested that Jamaican musicians making use of &quot;hardcore patois&quot;, a mixture of English with several languages spoken in Jamaica, create a language barrier that prevents them from becoming successful in the United States and the United Kingdom.

It was announced that he would receive the Order of Distinction (OD) from the Jamaican government on 21 October 2019, &quot;for contribution to the global popularity and promotion of reggae music&quot;.

In August 2019, Paul was nominated alongside Drake, DJ Snake, and Snow for the Favorite Crossover Artist category at the 2019 Latin American Music Awards.

In March 2021, Paul released his seventh studio album called &quot;Live n Livin&quot; under his own label Dutty Rock Productions.

They performed the song live on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, and &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot;. The song was massively well-received worldwide on the internet and was named the &quot;dancehall track of the year&quot; for 2021 by NPR.

In May 2022, Paul released his eighth studio album &quot;Scorcha&quot; through Island Records.

In September 2022, Paul appeared in season 22 of &quot;The Voice&quot; as Gwen Stefani&#x27;s coach advisor.

In 2016, Paul donated $1 million JMD toward Bustamante Hospital for Children. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Paul founded the &quot;Sean Paul Foundation&quot; in 2020, aiding less-fortunate communities in Jamaica with donations of groceries to poor families and distribution of tablet computers to primary schools for students.

Paul has spoken out about climate change. In 2015, he attended the United Nations Climate Change conference, expressing concerns over pollution, the coastal erosions of beaches in Jamaica and has said that athletes in the country are having to &quot;run in smog&quot;. He has advocated for waste reduction, solar power and the use of electric cars. He collaborated with Paul McCartney, Natasha Bedingfield, Bon Jovi, Colbie Caillat, and various other artists on a single called &quot;Love Song to the Earth&quot; to spread awareness about climate change. In 2018, Paul was named an ambassador for climate change in the Caribbean. In 2022, Paul stated in his efforts to help combat climate change; &quot;I have made the move to make my whole house solar powered. From the water to all the lights, and it runs my studio as well&quot;.

==Personal life==
As a teenager he dated Nicole Wynter, who passed away from a brain tumor at age 17. She is mentioned in the singer&#x27;s song &quot;Never Gonna Be The Same Again&quot; and a photo of her was shown in the music video.

<text>Pierre-Simon Girard (4 November 1765 – 30 November 1836) was a French mathematician and engineer, who worked on fluid mechanics.

Girard was born in Caen. A prodigy who invented a water turbine at the age of ten, he worked as an engineer at the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées. He was in charge of planning and construction of the Amiens canal and the Ourcq canal. He collaborated with Gaspard de Prony on the &quot;Dictionnaire des Ponts et Chaussées&quot; (Dictionary of Bridges and Highways, 1787). He wrote on fluids, and in 1798 he published a monograph, &quot;Traité analytique de la résistance des solides&quot; on beam theory, including possibly its first history, within the topic of strength of materials. The complicated beam equations were not of practical much use, since he applied Euler&#x27;s non-linear theory. In 1799, he and other engineers and scientists accompanied Napoleon on his expedition to Egypt. He died in Paris, aged 71.

== Important works ==
The 1798 monograph &quot;Traite Analytique de la Resistance des solides, et des solides d&#x27;e&#x27;gale Resistance, Auquel on a joint une suite de nouvelles Experiences sur la force, et Velasticite specifique des Bois de Chine et de Sapin&quot; was reviewed by Isaac Todhunter, and his editor, Karl Pearson as follows.This work very fitly closes the labours of the 18th century. It is the first practical treatise on Elasticity; and one of the first attempts to make searching experiments on the elastic properties of beams. It is not only valuable as containing the total knowledge of that day on the subject, but also by reason of an admirable historical introduction... The work appears to have been begun in 1787 and portions of it presented to the Academie in 1792. Its final publication was delayed till the experiments on elastic bodies, the results of which are here tabulated, were concluded at Havre.

<text>Du Mu (; 803–852) was a Chinese calligrapher, poet, and politician who lived during the late Tang dynasty. His courtesy name was Muzhi (), and art name Fanchuan (). He is best known for his lyrical and romantic quatrains.

Regarded as a major poet during a golden age of Chinese poetry, his name is often mentioned together with that of another renowned Late Tang poet, Li Shangyin, as the &quot;Little Li-Du&quot; (), in contrast to the &quot;Great Li-Du&quot;: Li Bai and Du Fu. Among his influences were Du Fu, Li Bai, Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan.

==Biography==
Du Mu was born in the Tang capital Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an) into an elite family, the Jingzhao Du clan, whose fortunes were declining. His grandfather was Du You, a minister at the Tang court and the compiler of the Tang Dynasty encyclopedia &quot;Tongdian&quot;. He passed the &quot;jinshi&quot; (&quot;Presented Scholar&quot;) level of the imperial civil service examination in 828 at the age of 25, and began his career as a bureaucrat holding a series of minor posts, first as an editor of at the Institute for the Advancement of Literature. A few months later, he joined the entourage of Shen Chuanshi (), a surveillance commissioner, first to Hongzhou, then a year later to Xuanzhou. In 833 he was sent to join Niu Sengru in Yangzhou. In Yangzhou he began to mature as a poet. In 835 he was appointed investigating censor and returned to the capital where, possibly concerned about being drawn into a factional dispute involving his friend Li Gan who had opposed Zheng Zhu, he asked to be transferred to Luoyang. This was granted, and he avoided the purge that followed the Sweet Dew Incident which happened later in the year.

Du Mu held many official positions in various locales through the years, but he never achieved a high rank, perhaps due to enemies made in the factional dispute at the imperial court in 835. In 837 he returned to Yangzhou to care for his younger brother Du Yi who was sick and had become blind, then went to work in Xuanzhou, taking his brother with him. In 838 he was appointed Rectifier of Omission of the Left and Senior Compiler of the History Office, and he returned to Chang&#x27;an. In 840 he was promoted to Vice Director of the Catering Bureau, then transferred to the position of Vice Director of the Board of Review in 841. Starting in 842 he was made governor of a succession of small poor rural prefectures, first Huangzhou, then Chizhou and Muzhou. Du was dissatisfied with the appointment and he appeared to blame it on Li Deyu. He began to feel his career was a failure and he expressed his dissatisfaction in his poems.

In 848 Du Mu returned to Chang&#x27;an after being appointed Vice Director of Merit Titles and was awarded his old post in the History Office. He was transferred to the post of the Vice Director of the Ministry of Personnel in 849, then was appointed governor of Huzhou in 850 at his own request. He was recalled to Chang&#x27;an in 851 to the post of Director of the Bureau of Evaluation and Drafter, and was appointed to the office of Secretariat and Drafter in 852. He fell ill that winter and died before the next lunar year.

==Works==
Du Mu was skilled in &quot;shi&quot;, &quot;fu&quot; and ancient Chinese prose. He is best known as the writer of sensual, lyrical quatrains featuring historical sites or romantic situations, and often on themes of separation, decadence, or impermanence. His style blends classical imagery and diction with striking juxtapositions, colloquialisms, or other wordplay. He also wrote long narrative poems.

=== Poetry ===
One of his best-known poems is &quot;Qingming Festival&quot; (Qingming Festival is a day of remembrance for the dead when people visit the graves of their ancestors to pay respect.)

Another well-known one is Autumn Evening. It tells of a lonely concubine at the palace whose fan has lost its purpose now that summer has ended. This is taken to be an allusion by the poet of his frustrations at his family&#x27;s decline in influence. The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl in the poem refers to the story of two separated lovers who can only meet once a year and who were used to name the Altair and Vega stars:

Du Mu enjoyed traveling in the misty mountains of southeast China, especially Xuanzhou, and remembering the fallen Southern dynasties, as exemplified by his poem &quot;Written on the Kaiyuan Temple at Xuanzhou&quot; ( ):

=== Prose ===
He wrote a commentary on &quot;The Art of War&quot; and many letters of advice to high officials.

A twenty-book collection of his prose works, &quot;Fan Chuan Wen Ji&quot; (), survives.

==Modern references==
In 1968, Roger Waters of the rock band Pink Floyd borrowed lines from his poetry including &quot;Lotuses lean on each other in yearning&quot; () to create the lyrics for the song &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; from the band&#x27;s second album A Saucerful of Secrets.

<text>Mahmoud Al-Zoubi (; 1935 – 21 May 2000) was Prime Minister of Syria from 1 November 1987 to 7 March 2000.

==Early life==
Al-Zoubi was born into the Al-Zoubi clan which is a Sunni family in 1935 in Khirbet Ghazaleh, a village 75 miles south of Damascus in the Hauran region.

==Prime Minister of Syria==
Al-Zoubi was a member of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. Under the rule of then President Hafez Assad, Al-Zoubi was appointed prime minister in 1987. 

On 7 March 2000, Al-Zoubi was replaced as prime minister by Mohammed Mustafa Mero.

===Currency crisis===
During 1985-2000, Al-Zoubi&#x27;s administration failed to arrest the 90 per cent fall in the worth of the Syrian Pound from 3 to 47 to the US Dollar.

==Downfall and the Airbus deal controversy==
On 10 May 2000, Hafez Assad expelled Al-Zoubi from the Ba&#x27;ath Party and decided that Al-Zoubi should be prosecuted over a scandal involving the French aircraft manufacturer Airbus. Al-Zoubi&#x27;s assets were frozen by the Syrian government. Al-Zoubi and several senior ministers were officially accused of receiving illegal commissions of the order of US$124 million in relation to the purchase of six Airbus 320-200 passenger jets for Syrian Arab Airlines in 1996. The indictment alleged that the normal cost of the planes was US$250 million, but the Government paid $374 million and Airbus sent on US$124 million to the senior ministers. Three others involved in the transaction, including the former minister for economic affairs and the former minister for transport were sentenced to prison for ten years.

The French company Airbus denied paying off the Syrian officials. The Syrian government in September 2003 announced its intention of purchasing six more Airbus planes for the government airline. The official finding within Syrian courts that Airbus paid over a hundred million dollars in bribes to their officials is apparently not a factor in deciding whether to continue to do business with them, especially with Boeing aircraft and spare parts being difficult to attain due to unilateral US sanctions.

==Personal life==
Al-Zoubi was married and had three sons and a daughter. His sons were Miflih, Hammam and Karim.

==Death and burial==
Al-Zoubi died on 21 May 2000. Conflicting reports say he died at age 62 or 65. According to a statement from the Interior Ministry, carried by the official Syrian Arab News Agency, Al-Zoubi shot himself in the head at his home in Dumer outside Damascus. The statement said Al-Zoubi died by suicide after learning that the Damascus police chief had come to his house to serve a judicial notice to appear before an investigating judge to answer allegations of corruption and other violations &quot;that caused great harm to the national economy.&quot; An Interior Ministry spokesman said &quot;a shot was heard upstairs and that was a shot fired by Zohbi at himself by his own pistol on the second floor of his house where his wife and children were present.&quot; The spokesman said Al-Zoubi was rushed to the Mowasat hospital in Damascus, where he later died. Hospital officials said none of his family accompanied him to the hospital. In June 2000, according to Lara Marlowe, there were persistent rumours that Al-Zoubi was actually murdered.

Al-Zoubi was buried at his birthplace in southern Syria. His funeral service took place in Deraa province on 22 May 2000. There were no officials at the ceremony. Sources said the funeral at Kirbit Ghazali, about 100 km south of Damascus, was a simple ceremony limited to his close family members and some of his hometown people.

<text>The Saab 93 (pronounced &quot;ninety-three&quot;) is the second production automobile that was manufactured by Swedish automaker Saab. Styled by Sixten Sason, it was first presented on December 1, 1955. The 93 was powered by a longitudinally-mounted three-cylinder 748 cc Saab two-stroke engine giving 33 hp (25 kW). The gearbox had three gears, the first unsynchronised. In order to overcome the problems of oil starvation on overrun (engine braking) for the two-stroke engine, a freewheel device was fitted. In 1957, two-point seatbelts were introduced as an option. The 93 was the first Saab to be exported from Sweden, with most exports going to the United States. A Saxomat clutch and a cabrio coach (large cloth sunroof) were available as options.

On September 2, 1957, the 93B was introduced. The original two-piece windshield was also replaced with a one-piece windshield.

In 1957, Erik Carlsson finished 1st in the Finland Rally in a Saab 93; in 1959, he was 1st in the Swedish Rally, also in a Saab 93. However, Saab was not the first Swedish manufacturer to win the Swedish Rally. Saab&#x27;s long-standing Swedish rival, Volvo, had beaten them consecutively in 1957 and 1958 with the PV544.

In late 1959, the 93F was introduced, featuring front-hinged doors from the Saab GT750. 1960 was the last year of production for the 93. The 93 was replaced by the Saab 96, although the two models were sold side by side for the earlier part of the year. A total of 52,731 Saab 93s were made.

The Saab Sonett I roadster shared many of its components with the 93.

<text>The Ten-Year AFL Patch is a shoulder patch adapted for use on American Football League (AFL) team uniforms.

==History==
During the entire 1969 professional football season, all NFL players wore a shoulder patch on their uniforms, reading &quot;50 NFL&quot;, marking the 50 years which had passed since the league&#x27;s initial organization. American Football League fan Ange Coniglio petitioned the AFL owners to have their players wear a patch commemorating the league&#x27;s 10 years, especially since it was the AFL&#x27;s final year. The AFL owners declined, in Lamar Hunt&#x27;s words, because they felt that a patch would make the uniforms &quot;too busy&quot;.

Coniglio enlisted the support of AFL President Milt Woodard and of AFL players. At his urging, the idea was also advanced by Jack Kemp in a request to Pete Rozelle. As reported in the &quot;Kansas City Chiefs&#x27; 2006 Press Guide&quot;, Woodard had a patch made to be used by whichever team won the final AFL Championship. It turned out that AFL founder Lamar Hunt&#x27;s Chiefs would be in the final AFL-NFL World Championship Game, and Hunt agreed to have the Chiefs wear a ten-year AFL patch in Super Bowl IV. The outline of the patch resembles that of the United States highway shield, itself based on the Great Seal of the United States.

==Support==
AFL Hall of Fame coach Hank Stram supported the idea and used the patch as a motivating factor for his team. Stram was later quoted as saying &quot;You could not believe it when you saw the faces of the players. These were great men, and great pros, but they were like kids in a candy shop when they saw that patch.&quot; Years later, Chiefs linebacker Willie Lanier remarked &quot;It lit us up. We knew what it meant.&quot; Wearing the AFL patch, the Chiefs went out and defeated the Vikings 23–7. The AFL-NFL Championship Game&#x27;s final record was NFL 2, AFL 2, showing that the upstart American Football League could capably compete with the established NFL.

==Legacy==

After Hunt&#x27;s death in 2007, a modified version of the AFL patch, this time rendered as a disc instead of a federal shield, and with his &quot;LH&quot; initials replacing the &quot;AFL&quot; letters on the football, became a permanent part of the Chiefs uniform on its left side as a memorial to the league and the team&#x27;s founding owner, along with being an icon within the end zones of Arrowhead Stadium to identify the team&#x27;s conference, replacing the post-merger AFC logo used by the league until 2009.

<text>The 1994 Winter Paralympics (; ), the sixth Paralympic Winter Games, were held in Lillehammer, Norway, from 10 to 19 March 1994.The Lillehammer Paralympics were the second time that the Games were held in Norway, after the 1980 Winter Paralympics in Geilo. 471 athletes from 31 countries participated, with Norway claiming the most gold medals ahead of Germany. This was the first Paralympics which the International Paralympic Committee had 100% involvement and responsibility and the first Games with their own logo.

These Games marked the second time the Paralympic Winter Games were held in the same city and venues as the Winter Olympics but despite this, they did not have the same Organizing Committee.However, the two Committees operated jointly in several sectors, something that served as a basis for the collaboration that was carried out for the 1998 Winter Paralympics and 2000 Summer Paralympic Games.Events were held in Alpine skiing, ice sledge speed racing, biathlon and cross-country skiing; the games also introduced ice sledge hockey.The Paralympic Games also shared 5 venues that were used during the Winter Olympics.The only differences were the addition of Kristins Hall as ice sledge hockey venue.This hall which was used as a training site for ice hockey teams during the Olympic Games and the use of the Håkons Hall to the ceremonial venue.

== Olympic Bidding Process==

The idea for an Olympic bid for Norway was born in 1981, when Falun, in neighbouring Sweden was defeated by Calgary in Canada to host the 1988 Winter Olympics. Along with the Norwegian government, the bid was also publicly encouraged and supported by the Swedish government, largely to help stimulate the economy of their inland counties. Lillehammer originally bid for the 1992 Games but came fourth in the voting, with the Games ultimately awarded to Albertville, France. In 1986, at the 91st IOC Session in Lausanne, they announced to separate the Summer and Winter editions (which had been held in the same year since the inception of the Winter Olympics in 1924) after the 1992 Games and have alternated between the 2 editions of the Olympics every two years during the four-year cycle. Lillehammer subsequently launched another bid, now for the 1994 Games, with some drastic modifications of the project, such as a new indoor speed skating venue and an additional ice hall in Lillehammer. Supplementary government guarantees and funds were secured for the new bid.

Three other locations put in bids for the 1994 Games: Anchorage (United States), Östersund (Sweden), and Sofia (Bulgaria). Lillehammer was elected to host the 1994 Winter Games at the 94th IOC Session, held in Seoul on 15 September 1988, two days before the start of the 1988 Summer Olympics. Until 2018, the Lillehammer Games were the last Winter Olympics to be held in a town, rather than centered in a city.

==Paralympic Bid Process==

More than a year after the success of the Olympic Bid, the Board of the Norwegian Sports Organisation for the Disabled (NIF) realized in October 1989 that there was a possibility that Lillehammer could also host the 6th Paralympic Winter Games, respecting the idea implemented by the IOC in 1984, when Seoul was invited to host the 1988 Summer Paralympics, right after that year&#x27;s Summer Olympics. Thus, the first movement took place in June 1990 and on 15 July of that same year, the IPC announced that the Norwegian proposal had been accepted without financial support. But, approximately one year after negotiations with the Norwegian Parliament for funding and up to 90 million Norwegian Krone was allocated under the condition that the Lillehammer 1994 Paralympic Winter Games Organizing Committee (LPOC) had to be organized in mirrored way as their Olympic counterpart to obtain the public funding, This forced the entity to be founded as a limited company, with the same status with the Olympic Organising Committee, with 51% owned by the Norwegian Government and 49% owned by the Norwegian Sports Organisation for the Disabled. This allowed those sectors where interests were in common to work in a unified way providing the basis for this form of work to also be used in 1998 Winter Olympics and the 2000 Summer Paralympics. The first meeting of the seven members, four appointed by the Government and three by the Norwegian Sports Organisation for the Disabled, was held on the 21st August 1991.

==Visual identity==
The Games were represented by an emblem depicting the sun people. This image portrayed the ideas of power, vitality, strength and energy, all of which are characteristics of the athletes who took part.

===Mascot===

The characteristics of the emblem were also to be found in the mascot Sondre, the troll. Sondre, who was also an amputee, was the result of a nationwide school competition won by Janne Solem. The mascot was then designed to its final appearance by Tor Lindrupsen. The name for the mascot was chosen in a separate competition and derives from the great skiing pioneer Sondre Nordheim.

== Sports ==
The 1994 Paralympics consisted 133 events in five disciplines in four sports. Ice sledge hockey made its Paralympic debut as the first winter team sport at these games.

* Alpine skiing
* Sledge hockey
* Ice sledge racing
* Nordic skiing
** Biathlon
** Cross-country skiing

<doc id="332556" wikidata="Q451608" url="?curid=332556" title="Gaspard de Prony">
<text>Baron Gaspard Clair François Marie Riche de Prony (22 July 1755 – 29 July 1839) was a French mathematician and engineer, who worked on hydraulics. He was born at Chamelet, Beaujolais, France and died in Asnières-sur-Seine, France.

==Education and early works==

He was Engineer-in-Chief of the [National school of bridges and roads], a technical school in Paris.

==The trigonometric and logarithmic tables of the cadastre==

In 1791, Prony embarked on the task of producing logarithmic and trigonometric tables for the French Cadastre (geographic survey). The effort was sanctioned by the French National Assembly, which, after the French Revolution wanted to bring uniformity to the multiple measurements and standards used throughout the nation. In particular, his tables were intended for precise land surveys, as part of a greater cadastre effort. The tables were vast, calculating logarithms from 1 to 200,000, with values calculated to between fourteen and twenty-nine decimal places, (which Prony recognized was excessively precise).

Inspired by Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, Prony divided up the labor into three levels, bragging that he &quot;could manufacture logarithms as easily as one manufactures pins.&quot;

The first level consisted of five or six high-ranking mathematicians with sophisticated analytical skills, including Adrien-Marie Legendre and Lazare Carnot. This group chose the analytical formulas most suited to evaluation by numerical methods, and specified the number of decimals and the numerical range the tables were to cover.

The second group of lesser mathematicians, seven or eight in number, were known as the &quot;planners&quot; and had previous experience as computers in the cadastre, mainly with experience having to do with practical mathematics. The planners combined analytical and computational skills, with this group calculating the pivotal values using the formulas provided and the sets of starting differences. They also prepared
templates for the human computers, and the first worked row of calculations, as well as the instructions for the computers to carry the sequence to completion. Finally, this group was tasked with verifying all the calculations made by the human computers. Since recalculating every value would have nullified the use of the lowest level computers since their tasks would have been completely repeated, the planners used a method knows as &quot;differencing,&quot; where they compared adjacent values in the tables, checking for any discrepancies.

The third group consisted of sixty to ninety human computers. These had no more than a rudimentary knowledge of arithmetic and carried out the most laborious and repetitive part of the process. Many were out-of-work hairdressers, because, with the guillotining of the aristocracy, the hairdressing trade, which had tended the elaborate hairstyles of the elite, was in recession.Due to their lack of experience, they only had to calculate simple problems of addition and subtraction. In addition, this group did not operate under a factory-like model, instead opting to work from home, sending their results and receiving their new tasks from the planners in a non-centralized manner. These calculators could produce an average of around 700 calculations a day.

The tables developed by Prony&#x27;s team were doubly important for French metric cartography. Firstly, at the time, sailors needed logarithms for math pertaining to spherical geometry, because this was needed to quickly and accurately position themselves to guarantee safe and efficient travel across the seas. However, the implementation of the new French Revolutionary metric system would make the old logarithmic tables would be obsolete, and French sailors would be unwilling to switch measurement systems since it would have rendered positional calculations significantly more difficult and less precise. Thus, Prony, by making new logarithmic tables for the new metric system, would have facilitated the transition, enabling sailors to adopt the system. The second key element was that trigonometric values were needed for cadastral measures. Thus, for accurate mapping of the French territory and its subdivisions all the way down to the lowest levels of property ownership, Prony needed to complete the trigonometric tables. These were both seen as crucial for Revolutionary pride considering the importance of naval prowess at the time and the need for administrative efficiency.

===Enlightenment calculations===

According to Prony, the project was to leave &quot;nothing to desire with respect to exactitude&quot; and to be &quot;the most vast... monument to calculation ever executed or even conceived.&quot; The tables were not used for their original purpose of bringing consistent standards for measurement, as the entire cadastre project saw delays in establishing both new measurement units as well as budget cuts. In particular, these tables, which were designed for the decimal division of circles and time, turned out to be obsolete after the French had changed their measurement system. Moreover, there was no practical use for the full extent of Prony&#x27;s calculation&#x27;s accuracy. Hence, these tables became more of artifacts and monuments to Enlightenment rather than objects of practical use.

===Influence on the meaning of calculation===

By the turn of the 19th century, there was a shift in the meaning of calculation. The talented mathematicians and other intellectuals who produced creative and abstract ideas were regarded separately from those who were able to perform tedious and repetitive computations. Before the 19th century, calculation was regarded as a task for the academics, while afterwards, calculations were associated with unskilled laborers. This was accompanied by a shift in gender roles as well, as women, who were usually underrepresented in mathematics at the time, were hired to perform extensive computations for the tables as well as other computational government projects until the end of World War II. This shift in the interpretation of calculation was largely due to Prony&#x27;s calculation project during the French Revolution. This project was able to unite people from many different walks of life as well as mathematical abilities (in the traditional sense) and hence changed the meaning of calculation from intelligence into unskilled labor.

===Mechanizing calculation===

Prony was able to have artisans (workers who excelled in mechanical arts that require intelligence) work along with mathematicians to perform the calculations. Prony noted a few interesting observations about this new dynamic. First, it was fascinating to see so many different people work on the same problem. Second, he realized that even the ones with the least intellectual ability were able to perform these computations with astonishingly few errors. Prony saw this entire system as a collection of human computers working together as a whole - a machine governed by hierarchical principles of the division of labor. In fact, Prony may have begun to amend his notion of intelligence, which he began to use to evaluate the system as a whole, rather than evaluating the intelligence of its constituents.

===Influence on Charles Babbage===

Charles Babbage, credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, was inspired by Prony&#x27;s take on Smith&#x27;s division of labor. He agreed with the three tiered system, but Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery. This would keep only the two highest groups human, and also would transform the role of the planners into a maintenance group for the machine.

=== Failure of the tables to be popularly implemented ===
The French Revolutionary government passed the law that made the metric system the official measurement system in 1795, but they did not include the decimal angle measurement, making much of Prony&#x27;s work worthless. This also meant that the funding needed for Prony to finish and publish his tables dried up. Prony continued his work until 1800, but because his publisher went bankrupt, the work was not seen by the public eye until the first excerpt of the table was published a century later. The Napoleonic government abandoned the project, before abandoning the metric system entirely in 1812 dooming Prony&#x27;s work.

==Prony&#x27;s brake==
One of Prony&#x27;s important scientific inventions was the &quot;brake&quot; which he invented in 1821 to measure the torque produced by an engine.

He also was first to propose using a reversible pendulum to measure gravity, which was independently invented in 1817 by Henry Kater and became known as the Kater&#x27;s pendulum.

==Prony&#x27;s estimation method==

Prony created a method of converting sinusoidal and exponential curves into a systems of linear equations. Prony estimation is used extensively in signal processing and finite element modelling of non linear materials.

==Engineering projects==
Prony was employed by Napoleon to superintend the engineering operations for protecting the province of Ferrara against the inundations of the Po and for draining and improving the Pontine Marshes. After the Restoration he was likewise engaged in regulating the course of the Rhône, and in several other important works.

==Distinctions==

Prony was a member, and eventually president, of the French Academy of Science. He was also elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1810. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. A street, Rue de Prony, in the 17th arrondissement of Paris is named after him.

<text>Ian Stewart MBE (born 15 January 1949) is a Scottish former long-distance running athlete. Ian Stewart was one of the world&#x27;s leading distance runners between the late 1960s and mid-1970s. Stewart won the bronze medal in the Men&#x27;s 5000 metres at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich (a race won by Lasse Virén). Stewart also won the following championships: European 5,000 metres (1969), Commonwealth 5,000 metres (1970), European Indoor (1969 and 1975) and World Cross Country (1975).

In 1965, at 16 years of age, he ran a British age best of 9.12.8 for 2 miles and two years later set a European junior 3 miles record of 13.39.8. In 1968, he broke European junior records at four distances: 3000m, 2 miles, 3 miles and 5000m. Moving up to the senior ranks in 1969, Stewart took the European Indoor 3000m title in a UK record (7.55.4), claiming the AAA 5000m title (13.39.66) and then winning 5000m gold at the 1969 European Athletics Championships in Athens in a time of 13.44.8.

In 1970, Stewart set a European record and world&#x27;s season best time when he recorded 13:22:8 to win the Commonwealth Games 5,000 metres title. This was one of the greatest races of all time and he defeated current world record holder Ron Clarke, Olympic 1,500 metres champion Kip Keino and fellow Scot, Ian McCafferty. Stewart produced a last lap of 54.4, Keino and Clarke could only finish 3rd and 5th, respectively.

The 1971 campaign proved an anti-climax as illness and injuries halted his progress, he was back to full fitness in the Olympic year of 1972. In the Olympic 5000 metres final, he suffered from a collision with American Steve Prefontaine with 700 metres to go but produced an amazing burst in the home straight to gain the bronze medal (13.27.6), the Finn, Lasse Viren, took gold in 13.26.4. Stewart ran the home straight faster than even Virén. Stewart later blamed the clash with Prefontaine for costing him the gold.

After a disappointing 1973 season and a mediocre effort in the Commonwealth Games 5000m final (5th in 13.40.4) in early 1974, he decided to take up cycle racing to recharge his batteries. Suitably refreshed, he returned to athletics in fine style the following year, completing an excellent double in March 1975 by winning the European indoor 3000m crown (7.58.6) and the IAAF World Cross Country Championships gold medal. He remains Britain&#x27;s last male winner of the cross country title and it proved to be his last major international honour. Stewart still produced some quality performances in later years, such as his 7th place in the 5000m final at the 1976 Olympics (losing to Virén by 2.89 seconds after dropping from second to seventh place in the last 300 metres. He ran a 10-mile world road best (45.13) in 1977. He retired in summer 1978, bringing down the curtain on a long and illustrious career.

Stewart was ranked No 1 in the world over 5000m by the American magazine Track and Field News in 1970. They ranked him third in 1969 and 1972, fifth in 1975, and tenth in 1976. He sometimes won races by using the unorthodox strategy of &quot;kicking&quot; or breaking far away from the field at the midpoint of the race (instead of on the last lap), leaving his rivals confused as to what to do.

Stewart set other British records: 1,500 metres 3:39.12 (1969), 2,000 metres 5:02.98 (1975),2 miles 8:22.0 (1972). Other personal bests: Mile 3:57.3 (1969) and 10,000 metres 27:43.03 (1977).

Stewart was one of six children, three of whom won European Indoor titles: elder brother Peter (born 1947) was the 3000m champion in Sofia in 1971 and British record holder at the mile 3:55.3 (1972); younger sister Mary (born 1956) won the 1500m in San Sebastian in 1977 and then became the Commonwealth Games champion (for England) in 1978 in Edmonton.

Stewart was awarded the MBE in 1979, and after coaching and working to promote distance running, he succeeded Andy Norman as promotions officer for British Athletics in 1994. Stewart was the Head of Endurance of UK Athletics (UKA) until February 2013.

<text>A madrigal is a form of secular vocal music most typical of the Renaissance (15th–16th centuries) and early Baroque (1600–1750) periods, although revisited by some later European composers. The polyphonic madrigal is unaccompanied, and the number of voices varies from two to eight, but the form usually features three to six voices, whilst the metre of the madrigal varies between two or three tercets, followed by one or two couplets. Unlike verse-repeating strophic forms sung to the same music, most madrigals are through-composed, featuring different music for each stanza of lyrics, whereby the composer expresses the emotions contained in each line and in single words of the poem being sung.

Madrigals written by Italianized Franco–Flemish composers in the 1520s partly originated from the three-to-four voice frottola (1470–1530); partly from composers&#x27; renewed interest in poetry written in vernacular Italian; partly from the stylistic influence of the French chanson; and from the polyphony of the motet (13th–16th centuries). The technical contrast between the musical forms is in the frottola consisting of music set to stanzas of text, whilst the madrigal is through-composed, a work with different music for different stanzas. As a composition, the madrigal of the Renaissance is unlike the two-to-three voice Italian Trecento madrigal (1300–1370) of the 14th century, having in common only the name &quot;madrigal&quot;, which derives from the Latin (maternal) denoting musical work in service to the mother church or from the post-classical Latin &quot;matricalis&quot; (maternal, simple, primitive).

Artistically, the madrigal was the most important form of secular music in Renaissance Italy, and reached its formal and historical zenith in the later-16th century, when the form also was taken up by German and English composers, such as John Wilbye (1574–1638), Thomas Weelkes (1576–1623), and Thomas Morley (1557–1602) of the English Madrigal School (1588–1627). Although of British temper, most English madrigals were &quot;a cappella&quot; compositions for three to six voices, which either copied or translated the musical styles of the original madrigals from Italy. By the mid-16th century, Italian composers began merging the madrigal into the composition of the cantata and the dialogue; and by the early 17th century, the aria replaced the madrigal in opera.

== History ==
=== Origins and early madrigals ===

The madrigal is a musical composition that emerged from the convergence of humanist trends in 16th-century Italy. First, renewed interest in the use of Italian as the vernacular language for daily life and communication, instead of Latin. In 1501, the literary theorist Pietro Bembo (1470–1547) published an edition of the poet Petrarch (1304–1374); and published the &quot;Oratio pro litteris graecis&quot; (1453) about achieving graceful writing by applying Latin prosody, careful attention to the sounding of words, and syntax, the positioning of a word within a line of text. As a form of poetry, the madrigal consisted of an irregular number of lines (usually 7–11 syllables) without repetition.

Second, Italy was the usual destination for the &quot;oltremontani&quot; (&quot;those from beyond the Alps&quot;) composers of the Franco-Flemish school, who were attracted by Italian culture and by employment in the court of an aristocrat or with the Roman Catholic Church. The composers of the Franco-Flemish school had mastered the style of polyphonic composition for religious music, and knew the secular compositions of their homelands, such as the chanson, which much differed from the secular, lighter styles of composition in late-15th- and early-16th-century Italy.

Third, the printing press facilitated the availability of sheet music in Italy. The musical forms then in common use — the frottola and the ballata, the canzonetta and the mascherata — were light compositions with verses of low literary quality. Those musical forms used repetition and soprano-dominated homophony, chordal textures and styles, which were simpler than the composition styles of the Franco-Flemish school. Moreover, the Italian popular taste in literature was changing from frivolous verse to the type of serious verse used by Bembo and his school, who required more compositional flexibility than that of the frottola, and related musical forms.

The madrigal slowly replaced the frottola in the transitional decade of the 1520s. The early madrigals were published in &quot;Musica di messer Bernardo Pisano sopra le canzone del Petrarcha&quot; (1520), by Bernardo Pisano (1490–1548), while no one composition is named &quot;madrigal&quot;, some of the settings are Petrarchan in versification and word-painting, which became compositional characteristics of the later madrigal. The &quot;Madrigali de diversi musici: libro primo de la Serena&quot; (1530), by Philippe Verdelot (1480–1540), included music by Sebastiano Festa (1490–1524) and Costanzo Festa (1485–1545), Maistre Jhan (1485–1538) and Verdelot, himself.

In the 1533–34 period, at Venice, Verdelot published two popular books of four-voice madrigals that were reprinted in 1540. In 1536, that publishing success prompted the founder of the Franco-Flemish school, Adrian Willaert (1490–1562), to rearrange some four-voice madrigals for single-voice and lute. In 1541, Verdelot also published five-voice madrigals and six-voice madrigals. The success of the first book of madrigals, &quot;Il primo libro di madrigali&quot; (1539), by Jacques Arcadelt (1507–1568), made it the most reprinted madrigal book of its time. Stylistically, the music in the books of Arcadelt and Verdelot was closer to the French chanson than the Italian frottola and the motet, given that French was their native tongue. As composers, they were attentive to the setting of the text, per Bembo&#x27;s ideas, and through-composed the music, rather than use the refrain-and-verse constructions common to French secular music.

=== Mid-16th century ===
Although the madrigal originated in the cities of Florence and Rome, by the mid 16th-century Venice had become the centre of musical activity. The political turmoils of the Sack of Rome (1527) and the Siege of Florence (1529–1530) diminished that city&#x27;s significance as a musical centre. In addition, Venice was the music publishing centre of Europe; the Basilica of San Marco di Venezia (St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica) was beginning to attract musicians from Europe; and Pietro Bembo had returned to Venice in 1529. Adrian Willaert (1490–1562) and his associates at St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica, Girolamo Parabosco (1524–1557), Jacques Buus (1524–1557), and Baldassare Donato (1525–1603), Perissone Cambio (1520–1562) and Cipriano de Rore (1515–1565), were the principal composers of the madrigal at mid-century.

Unlike Arcadelt and Verdelot, Willaert preferred the complex textures of polyphonic language, thus his madrigals were like motets, although he varied the compositional textures, between homophonic and polyphonic passages, to highlight the text of the stanzas; for verse, Willaert preferred the sonnets of Petrarch. Second to Willaert, Cipriano de Rore was the most influential composer of madrigals; whereas Willaert was restrained and subtle in his settings for the text, striving for homogeneity, rather than sharp contrast, Rore used extravagant rhetorical gestures, including word-painting and unusual chromatic relationships, a compositional trend encouraged by the music theorist Nicola Vicentino (1511–1576). From Rore&#x27;s musical language came the &quot;madrigalisms&quot; that made the genre distinctive, and the five-voice texture which became the standard for composition.

=== 1550s–1570s ===

The latter history of the madrigal begins with Cipriano de Rore, whose works were the elementary musical forms of madrigal composition that existed by the early 17th century. The relevant composers include Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (1525–1594), who wrote secular music in his early career; Orlande de Lassus (1530–1594), who wrote the twelve-motet &quot;Prophetiae Sibyllarum&quot; (Sibylline Prophecies, 1600), and later, when he moved to Munich in 1556, began the history of madrigal composition beyond Italy; and Philippe de Monte (1521–1603), the most prolific madrigalist, first published in 1554.

In Venice, Andrea Gabrieli (1532–1585) composed madrigals with bright, open, polyphonic textures, as in his motet compositions. At the court of Alfonso II d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara (r. 1559–1597), there was the &quot;Concerto delle donne&quot; (1580–1597), the concert of the ladies, three women singers for whom Luzzasco Luzzaschi (1545–1607), Giaches de Wert (1535–1596), and Lodovico Agostini (1534–1590) composed ornamented madrigals, often with instrumental accompaniment. The great artistic quality of the &quot;Concerto delle donne&quot; of Ferrara encouraged composers to visit the court at Ferrara, to listen to women sing and to offer compositions for them to sing. In turn, other cities established their own &quot;concerto delle donne&quot;, as at Firenze, where the Medici family commissioned Alessandro Striggio (1536–1592) to compose madrigals in the style of Luzzaschi. In Rome, the compositions of Luca Marenzio (1553–1599) were the madrigals that came closest to unifying the different styles of the time.

In the 1560s, Marc&#x27;Antonio Ingegneri (1535–1592) — Monteverdi&#x27;s instructor — Andrea Gabrieli (1532–1585), and Giovanni Ferretti (1540–1609) re-incorporated lighter elements of composition to the madrigal; serious Petrarchan verse about Love, Longing, and Death was replaced with the villanella and the canzonetta, compositions with dance rhythms and verses about a care-free life. In the late 16th century, composers used word-painting to apply &quot;madrigalisms&quot;, passages in which the music matches the meaning of a word in the lyrics; thus, a composer sets &quot;riso&quot; (smile) to a passage of quick, running notes that mimic laughter, and sets &quot;sospiro&quot; (sigh) to a note that falls to the note below. In the 17th century, acceptance of word-painting as a musical form had changed, in the &quot;First Book of Ayres&quot; (1601), the poet and composer Thomas Campion (1567–1620) criticised word-painting as a negative mannerism in the madrigal: &quot;where the nature of everie word is precisely expresst in the Note ... such childish observing of words is altogether ridiculous.&quot;

=== Turn of the century ===
At the end of the 16th century, the changed social function of the madrigal contributed to its development into new forms of music. Since its invention, the madrigal had two roles: (i) a private entertainment for small groups of skilled, amateur singers and musicians; and (ii) a supplement to ceremonial performances of music for the public. The amateur entertainment function made the madrigal famous, yet professional singers replaced amateur singers when madrigalists composed music of greater range and dramatic force that was more difficult to sing, because the expressed sentiments required soloist singers of great range, rather than an ensemble of singers with mid-range voices.

There emerged the division between the active performers and the passive audience, especially in the culturally progressive cities of Ferrara and Mantua. The emotions communicated in a madrigal in 1590, an aria expressed in opera at the beginning of the 17th century, yet composers continued using the madrigal into the new century, such as the old-style madrigal for many voices; the solo madrigal with instrumental accompaniment; and the concertato madrigal, of which Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643) was the most famous composer.

In Naples, the compositional style of the pupil Carlo Gesualdo followed from the style of his mentor, Luzzasco Luzzaschi (1545–1607), who had published six books of madrigals and the religious music &quot;Responsoria pro hebdomada sancta&quot; (&quot;Responsories for Holy Week&quot;, 1611). In the early 1590s, Gesualdo had learnt the chromaticism and textural contrasts of Ferrarese composers, such as Alfonso Fontanelli (1557–1622) and Luzzaschi, but few madrigalists followed his stylistic mannerism and extreme chromaticism, which were compositional techniques selectively used by Antonio Cifra (1584–1629), Sigismondo d&#x27;India (1582–1629), and Domenico Mazzocchi (1592–1665) in their musical works. In the 1620s, Gesualdo&#x27;s successor madrigalist was Michelangelo Rossi (1601–1656), whose two books of unaccompanied madrigals display sustained, extreme chromaticism.

=== Transition to the concertato madrigal ===
In the transition from Renaissance music (1400–1600) to Baroque music (1580–1750), Claudio Monteverdi usually is credited as the principal madrigalist whose nine books of madrigals showed the stylistic, technical transitions from the polyphony of the late 16th century to the styles of monody and of the concertato accompanied by basso continuo, of the early Baroque period. As an expressive composer, Monteverdi avoided the stylistic extremes of Gesualdo&#x27;s chromaticism, and concentrated upon the drama inherent to the madrigal musical form. His fifth and sixth books include polyphonic madrigals for equal voices (in late-16th-century style) and madrigals with solo-voice parts accompanied by basso continuo, which feature unprepared dissonances and recitative passages — foreshadowing the compositional integration of the solo madrigal to the aria. In the fifth book of madrigals, using the term &quot;seconda pratica&quot; (second practice) Monteverdi said that the lyrics must be &quot;the mistress of the harmony&quot; of a madrigal, which was his progressive response to Giovanni Artusi (1540–1613) who negatively defended the limitations of dissonance and equal voice parts of the old-style polyphonic madrigal against the concertato madrigal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold/Wakelin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transition from the concertato madrigal ===
In the first decade of the 17th century, the Italian compositional techniques for the madrigal progressed from the old ideal of an &quot;a cappella&quot; vocal composition for balanced voices, to a vocal composition for one or more voices with instrumental accompaniment. The inner voices became secondary to the soprano and the bass line; functional tonality developed, and treated dissonance freely for composers to emphasise the dramatic contrast among vocal groups and instruments. The 17th-century madrigal emerged from two trends of musical composition: (i) the solo madrigal with basso continuo; and (ii) the madrigal for two or more voices with basso continuo. In England, composers continued to write ensemble madrigals in the older, 16th-century style. In 1600, the harmonic and dramatic changes in the composition of the madrigal expanded to include instrumental accompaniment, because the madrigal originally was composed for group performance by talented, amateur artists, without a passive audience; thus instruments filled the missing parts. The composer usually did not specify the instrumentation; in &quot;The Fifth Book of Madrigals&quot; and in the &quot;Sixth Book of Madrigals&quot;, Claudio Monteverdi indicated that the &quot;basso seguente&quot;, the instrumental bass part, was optional in the ensemble madrigal. The usual instruments for playing the bass line and filling inner voice parts, were the lute, the theorbo (chitarrone), and the harpsichord.
The madrigalist Giulio Caccini (1551–1618) produced madrigals in the &quot;solo continuo&quot; style, compositions technically related to monody and descended from the experimental music of the Florentine Camerata (1573–1587). In the collection of solo madrigals, &quot;Le nuove musiche&quot; (&quot;The New Music&quot;, 1601), Caccini said that the point of the composition was anti-contrapuntal, because the lyrics and words of the song were primary, and balanced-voice polyphony interfered with hearing the lyrics of the song. After Caccini&#x27;s developments, the composers Marco da Gagliano (1582–1643), Sigismondo d&#x27;India (1582–1629), and Claudio Saracini (1586–1630) also published collections of madrigals in the solo continuo style. Whereas Caccini&#x27;s music mostly was diatonic, later composers, especially d&#x27;India, composed solo continuo madrigals using an experimental idiom of chromaticism. In the &quot;Seventh Book of Madrigals&quot; (1619), Monteverdi published his only madrigal in the solo continuo style, which uses one singing voice, and three groups of instruments — a great technical advance from Caccini&#x27;s simple voice-and-basso-continuo compositions from the 1600 period.

Beginning around 1620, the aria supplanted the monodic-style madrigal. In 1618, the last, published book of solo madrigals contained no arias, likewise in that year, books of arias contained no madrigals, thus published arias outnumbered madrigals, and the prolific madrigalists Saracini and d&#x27;India ceased publishing in the mid-1620s.

In the late 1630s, two madrigal collections summarised the compositional and technical practises of the late-style madrigal. In &quot;Madrigali a 5 voci in partitura&quot; (1638), Domenico Mazzocchi collected and organised madrigals into continuo and ensemble works specifically composed for &quot;a cappella&quot; performance. For the first time in a collection of madrigal music, Mazzocchi published precise instructions, including the symbols for crescendo and decrescendo; however, those madrigals were for musicologic study, not for performance, indicating composer Mazzochi&#x27;s retrospective review of the madrigal as an old form of musical composition. In the &quot;Eighth Book of Madrigals&quot; (1638), Monteverdi published his most famous madrigal, the &quot;Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda&quot;, a dramatic composition much like a secular oratorio, featuring musical innovations such as the &quot;stile concitato&quot; (agitated style) that employs the string tremolo. In the event, the evolution of musical composition eliminated the madrigal as a discrete musical form; the solo cantata and the aria supplanted the solo continuo madrigal, and the ensemble madrigal was supplanted by the cantata and the dialogue, and, by 1640, the opera was the predominant dramatic musical form of the 17th century.

=== English madrigal school ===

In 16th-century England, the madrigal became greatly popular upon publication of &quot;Musica Transalpina&quot; in (&quot;Transalpine Music&quot;, 1588), by Nicholas Yonge (1560–1619) a collection of Italian madrigals with corresponding English translations of the lyrics, which later initiated madrigal composition in England. The unaccompanied madrigal survived longer in England than in Continental Europe, where the madrigal musical form had fallen from popular favour, but English madrigalists continued composing and producing music in the Italian style of the late-16th century.

In early 18th-century England, the singing of madrigals was revived by catch clubs and glee clubs, leading to an upsurge of interest in the form and creation of musical institutions such as the Madrigal Society, which was established in London by attorney and amateur musician John Immyns in 1741. In the 19th century, the madrigal was the best-known music from the Renaissance (15th–16th c.) consequent to the prolific publishing of sheet music in the 16th and 17th centuries, even before the rediscovery of the madrigals of the composer Palestrina (Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina).

=== Continental Europe ===
In the 16th century, the musical form of the Italian madrigal greatly influenced secular music throughout Europe, which composers wrote either in Italian or in their native tongues. The extent of madrigalist musical influence depended upon the cultural strength of the local tradition of secular music. In France, the native composition of the &quot;chanson&quot; disallowed the development of a French-style madrigal; nonetheless, French composers such as Orlande de Lassus (1532–1594) and Claude Le Jeune (1528–1600) applied madrigalian techniques in their musics. In the Netherlands, Cornelis Verdonck (1563–1625), Hubert Waelrant (1517–1595), and Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck (1562–1621) composed madrigals in Italian.

In German-speaking Europe, the prolific composers of madrigals included Lassus in Munich and Philippe de Monte (1521–1603) in Vienna. The German-speaking composers who studied the Italian techniques for composing madrigals, especially in Venice, included Hans Leo Hassler (1564–1612) who studied with Andrea Gabrieli, and Heinrich Schütz (1585–1672) who studied with Giovanni Gabrieli. From northern Europe, Danish and Polish court composers went to Italy to learn the Italian style of madrigal; while Luca Marenzio (1553–1599) went to the Polish court to work as the &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; (Master of the chapel) for King Sigismund III Vasa (r. 1587–1632) in Warsaw. Moreover, the &quot;rektor&quot; of the University of Wittenberg, Caspar Ziegler (1621–1690) and Heinrich Schütz wrote the treatise &quot;Von den Madrigalen&quot; (1653).

<doc id="332563" wikidata="Q2121613" url="?curid=332563" title="Tribe of Dan">
<text>The Tribe of Dan (, &quot;Judge&quot;) was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, according to the Torah. According to the Hebrew Bible, the tribe initially settled in the hill lands bordering Ephraim and Benjamin on the east and Judah and the Philistines on the south but migrated north due to pressure of their enemies, settling at Laish (later known as Dan), near Mount Hermon.

Biblical judge Samson was a hero of the Dan tribe.

==Biblical narrative==

In the Biblical census of the Book of Numbers, the tribe of Dan is portrayed as the second largest Israelite tribe (after Judah). Some textual scholars regard the census as being from the Priestly Source, dating it to around the 7th century BC, and more likely to reflect the biases of its authors. In the &quot;Blessing of Moses&quot;, which some textual scholars regard as dating from only slightly earlier than the deuteronomist, Dan is prophesied to &quot;leap from Bashan&quot;; scholars are uncertain why this should be since the tribe did not live in the Bashan plain, east of the Jordan River.

===Conquest and territory===
According to the biblical narrative, following the completion of the conquest of Canaan by the Israelite tribes after about 1200 BC, Joshua allocated the land among the twelve tribes. Dan was the last tribe to receive its territorial inheritance. The land originally allocated to Dan was a small enclave in the central coastal area of Canaan, between Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim and the Philistines.

To the north the territory of Dan abutted Joppa, the modern Jaffa. This territory, not very extensive originally, was soon diminished by its dangerous neighbors, the Philistines. The tribe was only able to camp in the hill country overlooking the Sorek Valley, the camp location becoming known as &quot;Mahaneh Dan&quot; (&quot;Camp of Dan&quot;). () The region they were trying to settle extended south into the Shephelah in the area of Timnah; as a result, the modern state of Israel refers to the region as Gush Dan (&quot;the Dan area&quot;).

From after the conquest of the land by Joshua until the formation of the first united Kingdom of Israel in c. 1050 BC, the Tribe of Dan was a part of a loose confederation of Israelite tribes. No central government existed, and in times of crisis the people were led by ad hoc leaders known as Judges.

The most celebrated Danite was Samson, a Danite judge from the period of settlement in the lands allotted by Joshua. Pnina Galpaz-Feller sees similarities between the story of Samson and Denyen tribal legends. Excavations conducted at Tel Dan by David Ilan of the Hebrew Union College show support for the Danites&#x27; potential Aegean connections.

As a consequence of the pressure from the Philistines, a portion of the tribe abandoned hopes of settling near the central coast, instead migrating to the north of Philistine territory, and after conquering Laish, refounded it as the city of &quot;Dan&quot; (). Thus their territory in the end lay northeast of that of Naphtali, east of the upper Jordan River, near its eastern sources, and defining the northern extent of the land of the Israelites. A number of biblical texts thus refer to &quot;All Israel, from Dan to Beersheba&quot;.

===United Monarchy===
With the growth of the threat from Philistine incursions, the Israelite tribes decided to form a strong centralised monarchy to meet the challenge, and the Tribe of Dan joined the new kingdom with Saul as the first king. After the death of Saul, all the tribes other than Judah remained loyal to the House of Saul. But after the death of Ish-bosheth, Saul&#x27;s son and successor to the throne of Israel, the Tribe of Dan joined the other northern Israelite tribes in making David, who was then the king of Judah, king of a re-united Kingdom of Israel. The tribe provided substantial military support for the kingdom in the form of 28,600 soldiers, being considered &quot;experts in war&quot;.

===Northern Kingdom of Israel===
However, on the accession of Rehoboam, David&#x27;s grandson, in c. 930 BC the northern tribes split from the House of David to re-form a Kingdom of Israel as the Northern Kingdom.

===Assyrian conquest and demise===
As part of the Kingdom of Israel, the territory of Dan was conquered by the Assyrians and many in the tribe were exiled; the manner of their exile led to their further history being lost. Some of the territory&#x27;s inhabitants fled south into the Kingdom of Judah, gradually assimilating into the kingdom&#x27;s Israelite population.

==Claims of descent from Dan==
A 15th-century Latin chronicle, &quot;Chronicon Holsatiae vetus&quot;, found in Gottfried Leibniz&#x27;s &quot;Accessiones historicae&quot; (1698),  states the Danes were of the Tribe of Dan. The antiquarian Henry Spelman in 1620 had made a similar claim that the Danes were the Israelite Tribe of Dan, based on the apparent similarity in name. Additionally, proponents of Nordic and British Israelism have made similar claims about descent from the tribe of Dan. British Israelite authors such as John Cox Gawler and J. H. Allen identified the Tribe of Dan with Denmark. While another prominent British Israelite author, Edward Hine, took the view that the tribe of Dan had colonized Denmark and Ulster in Ireland.

Some of the Ethiopian Jews, also known as Beta Israel, claim descent from the Tribe of Dan, whose members migrated south along with members of the tribes of Gad, Asher, and Naphtali, into the Kingdom of Kush, now Ethiopia and Sudan, during the destruction of the First Temple. This position is supported by former Sephardic Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. They are said to have fought with the natives.

==Characteristics==
The primary characteristic of the tribe of Dan was seafaring. In the Song of Deborah the tribe is said to have stayed on their ships with their belongings.

==Iconography==

Modern artists use the &quot;scales of justice&quot; to represent the Tribe of Dan due to referencing Dan &quot;shall achieve justice for his kindred&quot;. More traditional artists use a snake to represent Dan, based upon Genesis 49:17, &quot;Let Dan be a serpent by the roadside, a horned viper by the path, That bites the horse&#x27;s heel, so that the rider tumbles backward.&quot;

==Book of Revelation==
Revelation 7:4–8 mentions that people from the twelve tribes of Israel will be sealed. The selection of the twelve tribes does not include the name of Dan, although their names were used for the twelve tribes that settled in the Promised Land. It has been suggested by some biblical scholars that this could be because of their pagan practices. This led Irenaeus, Hippolytus of Rome and some Millennialists to propose that the Antichrist will come from the tribe of Dan.

<text>The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU), literally translated as National Confederation of Democratic Trade Unions, also known as Minju-nochong (; an acronym for &quot;KCTU&quot; in Korean), is a national trade union centre in South Korea officially established in 1995. Its predecessor was the National Council of Trade Unions (NCTU), established in 1990 as an independent, democratically operated alternative to the Federation of Korean Trade Unions.

Following the 2016–17 South Korean protests (Candlelight Demonstrations), the KCTU has seen accelerated growth in union enrollment, reaching 1,134,056 members in 2020 and making it the second largest industrial union confederation in Korea.

== History ==
After the liberation from Japanese rule in 1945, and Park Chung Hee&#x27;s subsequent coup d&#x27;état in 1961, there existed only one legal trade union federation in Korea, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU). Park&#x27;s regime was truly authoritarian, and suppressed the activities of all political and business leaders it deemed corrupt. Park restructured the unions, permitting only those he and his regime regarded as &quot;loyal&quot; to their cause.

As a result, for almost two decades under the military regime of President Park, the FKTU was substantially weakened and subordinated to the repressive state, as well as the family-owned conglomerates or Chaebol, which dominated and monopolized the industries in South Korea and expanded incessantly with government help. As a result, the labor movement became very fragmented. It continued to operate through localized unions, such as the miners, textile workers, anti-government activists, and various Catholic groups.

By the 1990s, with the demise of the military regimes, the Chaebol groups began to reassert themselves with the introduction of automation production processes, decentralized factory location of production sites, and began to relocate production to overseas, which worsened the situation for organised labour.

===Gaining strength and support===
To sever the relationship from the FKTU, whom many regarded as a government proxy for their subordination to the military regimes, various national federations of the chaebol-based unions emerged, including the Kia and Hyundai Group, as well as regional unions, such as the Masan and Changwon Unions Association. In the public sector, the National Teachers Union was formed in 1989, to counter the perceived authoritarian nature of education in Korea.

However, many trade unions felt the need to consolidate and overcome the fractured nature of the trade unions at the national level. As a result, they formed a national organization, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) in 1995. Subsequently, their membership increased from 861 unions and 391 000 members in December 1995 to 896 unions and 490,000 members in December 1996. The KCTU had become a formidable force, regarding themselves as an indispensable &quot;check&quot; to the power of the state, employers, and the FKTU.

===Rise of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions===
Despite the internal struggles and factionalism of KCTU, their methods were nonetheless highly effective. In the early 1990s, there was a shift from domestic growth to national competitiveness: one of the major economic policies of Korea became &quot;growth first, and distribution later.&quot; The KCTU regarded this as detrimental to the interests of the workers, and adopted the counter-policy of &quot;strike first, bargain later.&quot; Korean workers used strikes as a weapon to seek political change, better working conditions, and for higher wages.

In 1996, a significant event occurred that catapulted the KCTU to both the national and world stage. The New Korea Party, led by President Kim Young Sam, unilaterally passed and amended labor laws without the presence of the opposition party in the middle of the night, in a six-minute session. In essence, the amended laws made it significantly easier for the employers to lay off the workers at will. The amended laws did not allow federal unions at either the local or the national level. This made the 500,000 member KCTU illegal. It was not legally recognized until 2002. These provisions prompted the KCTU to successfully mobilize 150,000 Korean workers and FKTU leaders, who previously displayed a pro-government propensity, to strike together.

As a result of the government&#x27;s decision to amend labor laws, President Kim Young Sam and his administration were censured by the OECD for their failure to honor the reforms which were promised to the people of South Korea, and for displaying &quot;backwardness&quot; with respect to labor-law reform. International organisations, including the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and International Metal Workers Unions both criticized and condemned the actions of the Korean government.

The foreign union representatives held joint news conferences with Korean unions, closely observed the strikes, and held various demonstrations outside Korean diplomatic missions abroad. Despite the overwhelming rebuke from the international community, the South Korean government chose to adhere to their initial decision and even threatened to arrest the strikers. It has been estimated that the three weeks&#x27; strikes cost $3.4 billion in lost production.

President Kim Young Sam, recognizing the growing popular support for the KCTU, decided to revise the laws and to meet with opposition leaders. In March 1997, parliament passed a more diluted version of the labor laws and the President&#x27;s chief economic adviser, who was the proponent of the earlier laws, was fired along with other advisers. Finally, during a meeting with the opposition leaders, President Kim stated that the KCTU would be legalized.

===Conflicting results of the January 1997 strike===
The results of the January strike varied. Ostensibly, the strike was of historic significance - it was extremely well managed and organized on a national level, and achieved lasting legal reform. It was successful in both political and economic terms. But more importantly, for the first time, labor had emerged as a leading social force in South Korea. The KCTU obtained their long-sought recognition by the government. Furthermore, they were granted the right to form multiple unions at the industry level (although they were prevented from forming unions amongst the teachers and public servants).

Conversely, many people believed that the revised law was very deficient in its substance. For example, the employers still retained their right to lay off workers at their discretion, after only a two-year deferment. The &quot;no work, no pay&quot; rule and no payment to full-time union leaders was still applicable in the revised laws, including the flexible workday policy in an effort to reduce wages. Hence, the employers were able to strengthen their power while the workers lost protection from lay-offs and the job security they sought so desperately.

===Limitations of the KCTU===
1997 was a devastating year for both the people of South Korea and the country when an economic crisis happened. By November 1997, many conglomerates including Hanbo, as well as several chaebol groups, were bankrupt. In addition, numerous banks became insolvent. In spite of both the Bank of Korea and the government&#x27;s effort to curtail the economic turmoil, the exchange rate and the stock market went into a free-fall. Korea was in danger of defaulting on its foreign debt obligations. On December 3, 1997, the International Monetary Fund decided to give its largest ever bailout package to South Korea, consisting of $57 billion. Included in the package, various harsh conditions were attached.

The IMF demanded stringent requirements. In addition to restructuring its financial and corporate sectors, Korea was to &quot;liberalize&quot; its markets - it needed to open up its markets in such a way that would benefit the foreign investors. In an effort to secure the jobs of the workers, KCTU implemented a nationwide signature campaign for the guarantee of jobs for workers and sought to punish the people responsible for the devastating economic crisis. Moreover, they organized approximately 30,000 people at a rally and demanded political reforms and sought protection from the impending arbitrary layoffs, hence the General Strike of 1997. The General Strike was supported by the blue collar and white collar workers, including the financial sector and clerical workers.

The strike was also supported by the general population, and despite the state control of the media, the Internet acted as a conduit in providing real time information to the outside world, for the first time. Despite the efforts of the KCTU in organizing the General Strike, the results were very disappointing. Whether it was imposed by the IMF or by the government, the bailout requirements gave significant discretion to the chaebol with respect to laying off the workers. Moreover, those upper and mid-level workers who had failed to unionise in fear of losing their jobs, were caught completely off guard. The economic crisis also compelled the government to enact laws without seeking the input from the unions, exacerbating the ongoing conflicts. As a result of the mandated restructure by the IMF, labor disputes inevitably escalated from 78 in 1997, to 129 in 1998.

===2013 police raid===
On 22 December 2013, hundreds of riot police raided the KCTU&#x27;s headquarters in Seoul injuring hundreds. Six senior KCTU leaders were arrested for supporting a national railway strike which the government declared &quot;illegal&quot;. According to the International Trade Union Confederation and the International Transport Workers’ Federation: &quot;The government of South Korea and its anti-union behaviour is again in the spotlight of the international community. Its actions run contrary to its obligations to the ILO and also the labour standards in trade agreements with the US and the EU. Further, the government is failing to fulfill its original commitment to the OECD, upon accession, to respect international labour standards.&quot;

===2024 martial law===
When president Yoon Suk Yeol attempted to declare martial law the KCTU called for a general strike to reverse the declaration of martial law and impeach the president. Following shortly after this call to action the KCTU further called for an indefinite general strike until Yoon stepped down. The union further stated that &quot;The KCTU’s general strike will mark the beginning of ending inequality and polarization, paving the way for a new era of labor respect. Through this resignation strike, let us move toward a new society where labor rights and public welfare are guaranteed.&quot;
==Factions==
There are three main factions of KCTU: the Nationalists(국민파), the Centralists(중앙파), and the Activists(현장파). The Nationalist faction inherited the student group tendency &quot;National Liberation (NL)&quot; in the 1980s that advocated leftist nationalism. The Nationalists is generally favorable to Democratic Party of Korea and Progressive Party, and is strong among construction workers.

The Centralists inherited the student group tendency &quot;People&#x27;s Democracy (PD)&quot; in the 1980s that advocated marxism-leninism. However, it now has a social democratic tendency, and mostly centre-left positioning. It is favorable to Justice Party. The Centralist faction&#x27;s main support base is chemical workers.

The Activists is an ultra-left faction that advocates revolutionary socialism and Trotskyism. Although it has a small number of members internally, it has strong influence on KCTU general. It mainly supports the Labor Party, and its support base is transportation workers.

The exact number of members of the three major factions cannot be estimated, but Korean media outlets analyze that the Nationalist is the largest faction with a 60% share of the total. Next are the centralists with 30% and the activists with 10%.

After the 2020 KCTU leadership election, the Nationalists was divided into the Social Agreement faction(사회적 합의주의) and the National Conference faction(전국회의). The Social Agreement faction, lead by former KCTU leader Kim Myeong-hwan, is a right-wing faction that is favorable to the Democratic Party and values class compromise. By contrast, the National Conference faction is a socialist left-wing faction that supports the Progressive Party and emphasizes traditional class struggle. The National Conference faction has been leading the KCTU since winning decisive victories in leadership elections, which held in 2020 and 2023. The current KCTU leader, Yang Kyung-soo, is also from the National Conference faction.

==Other activities==
The KCTU is a labor union with a prominent leftist tendency and has traditionally supported the labor movement of foreign workers living in South Korea. In 2001, a labor union of only foreign workers under the KCTU was formed, which is said to be the first in South Korean history. As of 2022, the KCTU has spoken on the issue of human rights violations against foreign workers.

On 29 May 2024, the National Democratic General Labor Union, a member of the Confederation of Trade Unions, the approved the creation of the Native Teachers&#x27; Union, a union for foreign teachers teaching their native language in public and private schools around the country, as well as in universities. The Teachers&#x27; Union claimed 200 members and three regional branches (Seoul, Busan, and Chungcheong) at the time of launch.

During the 2024 South Korean martial law declaration, the KCTU called for a general strike to reverse the declaration of martial law and impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol.

==Criticism==
Within three years of its existence, KCTU managed significant achievements, including legally recognized by the government and gained substantial national prominence. With more than half a million members and its ability to mobilize tens of thousands of workers at any given time, KCTU was now a legitimate force that could not be ignored. Nevertheless, voices of discontent within the union were growing.

On January 14, 1998, the Labor Management Government Tripartite Council was formed, as mandated by the IMF. It was a concerted effort on all three parties to equally &quot;share&quot; the pain and suffering associated with the economic crisis. As a part of the &quot;share&quot; of the union, KCTU leadership conceded the redundancy layoffs in the case of emergency affecting the companies, something that the union members had consistently rejected. And consequently, the union members of the KCTU voted out the leadership who they deemed were responsible for the grave mistake and elected a hard liner, Lee Kap-Yong as their new president.

In response to the economic crisis, KCTU membership levels had also declined. It fell by 9 per cent or 40,783 members, between January and October 1998. To mitigate further layoffs by the employers, KCTU affiliates have engaged in strike action at the Hyundai Motor Company in August and September 1998. Although the company had intended to layoff 1500 employees, as the result of more than a month of stoppage during which some union members went on hunger strikes and national support was given by other trade unions, Hyundai was compelled to reduce the numbers being laid off to 277. But nevertheless, they could not prevent the membership of KCTU from declining.

One of the more important dynamics of labor has been left in obscurity thus far, the treatment of the female workforce in Korea. In this respect, all trade unions including, KCTU were criticized in unison for their lack of interest of the female workers. Their failure to address the concerns of harsh working conditions and numerous labor rights violations are extremely unfortunate and incomprehensible. KCTU was also criticized for being indifferent to the issue of employment of the disabled and for not showing efforts to improve the equal working rights of the disabled.

The trade unions in South Korea had been historically repressed by their governments for almost five decades. From the creation of the First Republic of Korea, from President Syngman Rhee and subsequent military generals who ruled for the next thirty years, all suppressed the unions and deliberately dishonored the constitution of the country, for the sake of the &quot;progress&quot; of the nation. However, with the inception of KCTU in 1995, South Korea and its people began to see a glimpse of hope. They in essence, profoundly changed the dynamics of the relationship between the capitalists, state, and the workers. KCTU, from its meager start successfully solidified themselves as an indispensable partner with respect to the workers’ rights of Korea.

From an illegal entity, they were invited by their government to be a &quot;partner&quot; in the national decision-making process. Stated differently, they were recognized as a formidable force that could no longer be ignored. The culmination of their status came during the presidential election of 1997, when KCTU now the second largest union, nominated Kwon Young-Gil, as the fifth presidential candidate of South Korea.

Despite their achievements, they had their share of deficiencies that included internal fragmentation, decline in their memberships, and the neglect of female workforce in Korea. Therefore, although KCTU had elevated the political and social status of organized labor, ironically, they were impelled to accept various labor changes that would ultimately harm and hinder the worker&#x27;s positions in Korea.

<text>The Tribe of Joseph is one of the Tribes of Israel in biblical tradition. Since the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh (often called the &quot;two half-tribes of Joseph&quot;) together traditionally constituted the &quot;tribe of Joseph&quot;, it was often not listed as one of the tribes, in favour of Ephraim and Manasseh being listed in its place; consequently it was often termed the House of Joseph, to avoid the use of the term &quot;tribe&quot;. Even though Ephraim and Manasseh were Joseph’s sons, they were considered heads of two of the twelve tribes of Israel because Joseph’s father, Jacob (renamed in later life by God as “Israel”), adopted Ephraim and Manasseh as his own sons (Genesis 48:1-16).

According to the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, the ensign of both the House of Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) and the Tribe of Benjamin was of silk of three colours, corresponding with the precious stones in the priestly breastplate, leshem, shəvo, and aḥlamah (amber, agate, and amethyst); and upon it expressed and set forth the names of the three tribes, Ephraim, Manasseh and Benjamin; having the figure of a young man upon it, with the inscription: &quot;And the Cloud of the LORD was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.&quot; (Numbers 10:34).

There were obvious linguistic differences between at least one portion of Joseph and the other Israelite tribes. At the time when Ephraim were at war with the Israelites of Gilead, under the leadership of Jephthah, the pronunciation of &quot;shibboleth&quot; as &quot;sibboleth&quot; was considered sufficient evidence to single out individuals from Ephraim, so that they could be subjected to immediate death by the Israelites of Gilead.

At its height, the territory of Joseph spanned the Jordan River, the eastern portion being almost entirely from the western portion, only slightly touching at one corner—northeast of the western portion and southwest of the eastern portion. The western portion was at the centre of Canaan, west of the Jordan, between the Tribe of Issachar on the north, and the Tribe of Benjamin on the south; the region which was later named Samaria (as distinguished from Judea or Galilee) mostly consisted of the western portion of Joseph. The eastern portion of Joseph was the northernmost Israelite group on the east of the Jordan, occupying the land north of the tribe of Gad, extending from the Mahanaim in the south to Mount Hermon in the north, and including within it the whole of Bashan. These territories abounded in water, a precious commodity in Canaan, and the mountainous portions not only afforded protection, but happened to be highly fertile; early centres of Israelite religion—Shechem and Shiloh—were additionally situated in the region. The territory of Joseph was thus one of the most valuable parts of the country, and the House of Joseph became the most dominant group in the united Kingdom of Israel.

==Origin==

According to the Old Testament, the tribe consisted of descendants of Joseph, a son of Jacob and Rachel, from whom it took its name; however, some Biblical scholars view this also as postdiction, an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the tribe to others in the Israelite confederation. In the Biblical account, Joseph was the brother to Benjamin, the other son of Rachel and Jacob, and the eponym of the Tribe of Benjamin, which was located to the immediate south of the tribe of Joseph. 

Though the biblical descriptions of the geographic boundary of the House of Joseph are fairly consistent, the descriptions of the boundaries between Manasseh and Ephraim are not, and each is portrayed as having exclaves within the territory of the other. In the Blessing of Jacob, and elsewhere ascribed by textual scholars to a similar or earlier time period, a single &quot;tribe of Joseph&quot; appears where passages written later place separate tribes of &quot;Ephraim&quot; and of &quot;Manasseh&quot;. From this scholars believe that &quot;Joseph&quot; was originally considered a single tribe, and only split into Ephraim and Manasseh later.

A number of biblical scholars and archaeologists (most notably William G. Dever) theorize that the &quot;Joseph tribes&quot; represent a second migration of Israelites to Israel, later than the main tribes; and that it was only the &quot;Joseph tribes&quot; who were enslaved into Egypt and returned, while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in Canaan throughout. In the narrative in the Book of Joshua, which concerns the arrival in (and conquest of) Canaan by the Israelites from Egypt, the leader is Joshua, who was a member of the Ephraim tribe.

According to this view, the story of Jacob&#x27;s visit to Laban to obtain a wife began as a metaphor for the second migration, with Jacob&#x27;s new family, possessions, and livestock, obtained from Laban, being representations of the new wave of migrants. According to textual scholars, the Jahwist version of the story is notable as having only the Joseph tribes among these migrants, since it recounts only Jacob as having met Rachel, and the matriarchs of the other Israelite tribes—Leah, Bilhah, and Zilpah—do not appear.

==Fate==
As part of the northern Kingdom of Israel, the territories of Manasseh and Ephraim were conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and the tribe was exiled; the manner of their exile led to their further history being lost. 

Despite the loss of the additional history of Manasseh and Ephraim, several modern-day groups claim descent from them, with varying levels of academic and rabbinical support. The Yusufzai tribe (literal translation The Sons of Joseph) of the Pashtuns of Afghanistan, India and Pakistan, who collectively refer to themselves as the &quot;Bani Israel&quot;, have a long tradition connecting them to the exiled Kingdom of Israel. The Samaritans claim that some of their adherents are descended from these tribes, and many Persian Jews claim to be descendants of Ephraim. Many Samaritans claim descent from the grandchildren of Joseph under four main septs, his grandsons Danfi, Tsedakah, Mafraj and Sarawi.

In Northeast India, the Mizo Jews claim descent from Manasseh and call themselves &quot;Bnei Menashe&quot;; in 2005 Shlomo Amar, Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, announced that he regarded this claim to be true, which under the Law of Return allows them to migrate to Israel as long as they formally convert to Israel&#x27;s Orthodox form of Judaism. Similar traditions are held by the Telugu Jews in South India, who claim descent from Ephraim and call themselves Bene Ephraim.

Considered less plausible by academic and Jewish authorities are the claims of several western Christian and related group. Some adherents of Messianic Judaism also identify as part of Joseph on the basis that, regardless of any genetic connection which may or may not exist, they observe the Torah and interpret parts of the Bible in certain ways.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that a significant portion of its members are descended from or adopted into the tribe of Ephraim, believing that they are charged with restoring the lost tribes in the latter days, as prophesied by Isaiah. Along with members of the tribe of Judah, members of the tribe of Ephraim are believed to be playing an important leadership roles for covenant Israel in the last days. Members&#x27; lineage is declared through patriarchal blessings.

Latter-day Saints also believe that the main groups of the Book of Mormon (Nephites and Lamanites) were part of the tribe of Manasseh. They believe that this would be the fulfilment of part of the blessing of Jacob, where it states that &quot;Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall&quot; (Genesis 49:22, interpreting the &quot;wall&quot; as the ocean). The idea being that they were a branch of Israel that was carefully led to another land for their inheritance.

<text>The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, often shortened to the Catholic League, is an American Catholic organization whose stated purpose is to &quot;defend the right of Catholics – lay and clergy alike – to participate in American public life without defamation or discrimination.&quot; The Catholic League states that it is &quot;motivated by the letter and the spirit of the First Amendment ... to safeguard both the religious freedom rights and the free speech rights of Catholics whenever and wherever they are threatened.&quot; According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics&quot;, the league &quot;is regarded by many as the preeminent organization representing the views of American lay Catholics.&quot;

Founded in 1973 by the Jesuit priest Virgil Blum, the Catholic League was formed to counter discrimination against Catholics in American government and popular culture. The low-profile group initiated public education campaigns and some lawsuits. In 1993 the group became much more aggressive with a new president, the former sociology professor Bill Donohue, who also increased its size to become the largest Catholic advocacy organization in the US. The Catholic League is known for press releases about what it views as anti-Catholic and anti-Christian themes in mass media.

The Catholic League has taken a stand against anything they perceive as anti-Catholic, including the entertainment industry, certain art exhibits, school programs for sex education, government-funded contraception and abortion, media bias, restrictions against anti-abortion activism, and restrictions on religious schools. It publishes a journal, &quot;Catalyst&quot;, and operates a website.

The league under Donohue&#x27;s leadership is criticized for its conservatism and for its combative responses to high-profile media stories. Besides education campaigns, the group issues condemnations, initiates boycotts and protests, defends priests against accusations of child sexual abuse, fights proposed legislation and threatens legal action against what it sees as bigotry against Catholics, irreverence against religious figures, and attacks on Catholic dogma. However, the Catholic League stresses that &quot;it does not speak authoritatively for the Church as a whole.&quot;

==Organizational overview==

===History===

The league was founded in Milwaukee on May 12, 1973, by Virgil Blum. Blum served as president of the Catholic League until 1988. John Tierney served as president from October 1990 to 1993.

===Bill Donohue===

Since 1993, the league has been led by its board of directors president, Bill Donohue, who works with a small number of organizational staffers. In a 1999 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, a reporter said Donohue is pragmatic in regards to religion, &quot;media savvy&quot; and &quot;steers clear of divisive debates on theological doctrines and secular politics&quot;. The article said Donohue &quot;fans simmering anger with inflammatory news releases, a Web site and newsletter&quot; with &quot;scathing attacks on the blasphemous and the irreverent&quot;. In a 2007 interview, Salon Life staff writer Rebecca Traister discussed Donohue with Frances Kissling, former head of the organization Catholics for Choice, which opposes Catholic teaching on abortion, who characterized Donohue as &quot;abusive&quot;, and stated she avoided doing media interviews with him for this reason.

===Operations and organization===
The league is organized under a board of directors chaired by Walter Knysz. The league also has board of advisors, consisting of prominent lay Catholics like Brent Bozell, Linda Chavez, Mary Ann Glendon, Alan Keyes, Tom Monaghan, and George Weigel. The league issues a journal, &quot;Catalyst&quot;, as well as reports, such as &quot;Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust,&quot; books, brochures and an annual &quot;Report on Anti-Catholicism&quot;.

===Association with the Catholic Church===
The Catholic League is a lay Catholic organization that is independent of the Catholic Church. However, it is listed in &quot;The Official Catholic Directory&quot; (see the Miscellaneous section under the Archdiocese of New York). According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; interviewer, the organization &quot;maintains close ties to the New York Archdiocese leadership. Several bishops make personal donations. John Cardinal O&#x27;Connor spoke at the group&#x27;s 25th anniversary reception in 1998 and vacated part of his suite for its expanding operations, said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York.&quot; Timothy Cardinal Dolan spoke at the Catholic League&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration on April 27, 2023. The league includes on its website endorsements from many prominent clerics.

===Membership===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Catholic League had 11,000 members when Donohue took over the group in 1993. By 1999, membership had grown to 350,000, two-thirds of whom were paying members. This is the last estimate of overall membership that the league made. The league&#x27;s 2003 statement showed 15,000 members in Nassau and Suffolk counties of New York alone. Annual donations entitle members to home delivery of the print version of &quot;Catalyst&quot;, the group&#x27;s monthly journal, which is also available for free on the Catholic League&#x27;s website.

===Political alignment===
The Catholic League says it is politically neutral, which is mostly required of non-profits. The website states, &quot;The League wishes to be neither left nor right, liberal or conservative, revolutionary or reactionary.&quot; Although often characterized as conservative the league has at times been at odds with conservative figures and organizations. For example, they criticized the anti-illegal immigration group, the Minutemen, for opposing a San Diego priest&#x27;s facilitation of employment for Latino immigrants and for condemning the church as a whole in public statements about the matter. The Catholic League also condemned pastor and televangelist John Hagee for what they called &quot;anti-Catholic hate speech&quot; and called upon John McCain&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign to renounce this alleged bigotry.

Christian Leftist John Swomley criticized the Catholic League as the &quot;most dangerous of the far-right organizations.&quot; Donohue has been called &quot;right-wing&quot; and &quot;a conservative reactionary who wants to undo the work of Vatican II and suppress varying opinions within the Church.&quot;

==Activities==

===Joan Osborne===
In 1996, Donohue took issue with Joan Osborne over her song &quot;One of Us&quot;, which explores the question of what it would be like if God were a human being. Donohue questioned the point of the song and brought up her activism calling for support of &quot;Rock for Choice&quot; and other pro-choice groups stating, &quot;It is no wonder that Joan Osborne instructs her fans to donate their time and money to Planned Parenthood. It is of a piece with her politics and her prejudices. Her songs and videos offer a curious mix of both, the effect of which is to dance awfully close to the line of Catholic baiting.&quot; Religious educator Paul Moses stated that Donohue&#x27;s was a &quot;tortured reading&quot; and he saw Osborne as having &quot;the Catholic imagination&quot; with the song &quot;awakening ... spiritual hunger&quot;. Osborne said, in a letter to fans, that &quot;the church&#x27;s attitudes toward women and gays make the pope look far more ridiculous than any pop song could&quot; and that she did not write the song, which &quot;speaks of the pope only with respect.&quot; Donohue also admitted that he was treating the issue in a &quot;kind of a prophylactic approach&quot; because &quot;cultures are changed as a result of patterns.&quot;

===&quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;===
In 1997, Donohue declared the ABC show &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; as deeply offensive to Catholicism, although not anti-Catholic in the traditional sense. Calling for a boycott, he stated that the show portrayed Catholics with a traditional view as cold or cruel while glorifying more the maverick, irreverent voices in the community. However, the show was defended by some Catholics and had been written with the consultation of Jesuits, from which it later won the Humanitas Prize. Many Catholics agreed with him that the show was hostile to the beliefs and values of the Catholic Church, and ABC canceled &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; after less than a season, reportedly for poor ratings. Observers think Donohue may have played a significant role in the show&#x27;s rapid demise as advertisers often become leery of shows deemed &quot;controversial&quot;. With regard to the controversy, Henry Herx, director of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops&#x27; Office of Film and Broadcast (successor to the National Legion of Decency), emphasized that the Catholic League is not an official agency of the church.

===&quot;Dogma&quot;===
The year 1999 saw the release of Kevin Smith&#x27;s controversial film &quot;Dogma&quot;. Smith was a practicing Catholic, as Kevin Smith confirmed in an interview on the film&#x27;s DVD. Several religious groups, especially the Catholic League, said the film was anti-Catholic and blasphemous, and organized protests, including one that took place at the October 4 premiere of the film at Lincoln Center in New York City.

Smith said that several of the protests occurred before the film was even finished, suggesting that the protests were more about media attention for the groups than for whatever was controversial about the film. The Catholic League&#x27;s main complaints were that the film&#x27;s main character is supposedly a descendant of Mary, who happens to work in an abortion clinic, which were seen as ironic conventions for a Catholic. The film&#x27;s distributor, Miramax, removed its name from the production, and hired attorney Dan Petrocelli to defend it publicly. Petrocelli accused Donohue of trying to stir a violent reaction to the film. Donohue responded by taking out an op-ed ad in the &quot;New York Times&quot; on September 12, 1999, quoting attempts by Petrocelli and Smith to stifle his free speech.

According to Smith, &quot;[Donohue] actually invited me out to have a beer after making my life hell for six months.&quot;

===&quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;===
Donohue is a staunch defender of Mel Gibson&#x27;s film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. On the December 8, 2004, broadcast of &quot;Scarborough Country&quot;, he stated: &quot;Hollywood is controlled by secular Jews who hate Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular. It&#x27;s not a secret, OK? And I&#x27;m not afraid to say it. That&#x27;s why they hate this movie. It&#x27;s about Jesus Christ, and it&#x27;s about truth. It&#x27;s about the Messiah.&quot;

In Donohue&#x27;s book, &quot;Secular Sabotage: How Liberals Are Destroying Religion and Culture in America&quot;, he responded to what he believed was a misrepresentation of his comments via taking them out of context. For example, in that same interview, he said the following: &quot;You have got secular Jews. You have got a lot of ex-Catholic priests who hate the Catholic Church, wacko Protestants in the same group.&quot; Later in the debate, in that same segment of the interview, he said, &quot;There are secularists from every ethnic and religious stock,&quot; emphasizing that when people talk about Hollywood, they are &quot;talking mostly about secular Jews.&quot;

In his book, Donohue also wrote the following: &quot;The &quot;Forward&quot;, a Jewish weekly, published an editorial in 2004 saying it was merely a &#x27;sociological observation&#x27; to note that &#x27;Jews run Hollywood.&#x27; The newspaper quite rightly said that to say &#x27;the Jews run Hollywood&#x27; is an entirely different matter, one that smacks of anti-Semitism. So it concluded that &#x27;No, &#x27;the Jews&#x27; don&#x27;t run Hollywood. But Jews do, just as Koreans predominate in New York dry-cleaning and blacks rule in basketball.&#x27;&quot;

===Bush holiday cards===
After US President George W. Bush used the term &quot;Holidays&quot; instead of &quot;Christmas&quot; on the White House 2005 Christmas cards, Donohue stated &quot;The Bush administration has suffered a loss of will and ... they have capitulated to the worst elements in our culture.&quot;

===John Edwards campaign staffers===
Donohue demanded that John Edwards fire two of his presidential campaign staffers in February 2007, charging that they were &quot;anti-Catholic, vulgar, trash-talking bigots.&quot; He cited a blog written by Amanda Marcotte regarding the church&#x27;s opposition to birth control, saying it forces women &quot;to bear more tithing Catholics&quot;. He also cited another posting called &quot;Pope and Fascists&quot;. Donohue also objected to one of the staffers describing President Bush&#x27;s &quot;wingnut Christofacist base&quot;.

Donohue called the statements &quot;incendiary&quot; and &quot;inflammatory&quot;, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s scurrilous and has no place being part of someone&#x27;s resume who&#x27;s going to work for a potential presidential contender.&quot; On February 8, John Edwards addressed the writings of the staffers, Amanda Marcotte and Melissa McEwan, saying &quot;that kind of intolerant language will not be permitted from anyone on my campaign, whether it&#x27;s intended as satire, humor or anything else.&quot; Donohue insisted that Edwards fire the pair immediately.

After the complaints, Marcotte wrote, &quot;The Christian version of the virgin birth is generally interpreted as super-patriarchal where God is viewed as so powerful he can impregnate without befouling himself by touching a woman, and women are nothing but vessels.&quot; After Marcotte parted with the campaign, Donohue stated, &quot;It is not enough that one foul-mouthed anti-Christian bigot, Amanda Marcotte, has quit. Melissa McEwan must go as well. Either Edwards shows her the door or she bolts on her own. There is no third choice – the Catholic League will see to it that this issue won&#x27;t go away.&quot; He continued, &quot;The Edwards campaign is in total disarray and the meltdown will continue unless McEwan is removed from his staff. The fact that Marcotte had to quit suggests that Edwards doesn&#x27;t have the guts to do what is morally right.&quot; McEwan resigned on February 13, 2007, citing the hostility of the Catholic League and emails threatening rape and murder.

===Kathy Griffin===
On September 8, 2007, Kathy Griffin won her first Emmy for season two of reality show &quot;Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List&quot;. Griffin stirred up controversy with her acceptance speech, saying that &quot;a lot of people come up here and thank Jesus for this award. I want you to know that no one had less to do with this award than Jesus. He didn&#x27;t help me a bit.&quot; She went on to hold up her Emmy and say, &quot;Suck it, Jesus, this award is my god now!&quot;

Her remarks were quickly condemned by Donohue, who urged the TV academy to &quot;denounce Griffin&#x27;s obscene and blasphemous comment.&quot; After the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences decided to censor Griffin&#x27;s remark, Donohue said, &quot;The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences reacted responsibly to our criticism of Kathy Griffin&#x27;s verbal assault on 85 percent of the US population. The ball is now in Griffin&#x27;s court. The self-described &#x27;complete militant atheist&#x27; needs to make a swift and unequivocal apology to Christians. If she does, she will get this issue behind her. If she does not, she will be remembered as a foul-mouthed bigot for the rest of her life.&quot;

In a statement issued by her publicist, Griffin responded to the denouncement by the Catholic League with a question: &quot;Am I the only Catholic left with a sense of humor?&quot;

===&quot;The Golden Compass&quot;===
As part of a two-month protest campaign, Donohue called for a boycott of the film &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, believing that while the religious elements of the film would be &quot;watered down&quot; from the source novels, the film would still encourage children to read the series, which Donohue says &quot;denigrates Christianity&quot; and promotes &quot;atheism for kids&quot;, citing author Philip Pullman as saying that he is &quot;trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief.&quot; Donohue hopes that &quot;the film [will fail] to meet box office expectations and that [Pullman&#x27;s] books attract few buyers.&quot; The call for a boycott resulted in action by some Catholic groups in the US and Canada, and a Catholic school board in Ontario has ordered the source novel removed from its library shelves. Pullman has since said that the books do not have a religious agenda, saying of Donohue&#x27;s call for a boycott, &quot;Why don&#x27;t we trust readers? Why don&#x27;t we trust filmgoers? Oh, it causes me to shake my head with sorrow that such nitwits could be loose in the world.&quot; Pullman described the Catholic League as &quot;a tiny, unrepresentative organisation,&quot; suggesting that &quot;the only person Bill Donohue represents is himself.&quot;

A lay person who reviews movies for the bishops&#x27; conference gave the movie high marks, but after the protest by the Catholic League, the bishops ordered this review to be withdrawn.

Other evangelical groups, such as The Christian Film and Television Commission, adopted a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; approach to the film before deciding upon any action, as did the Roman Catholic Church in Britain.

Some commentators indicated that they believed the criticism would prove ultimately impotent and that the negative publicity would prove a boon for the film&#x27;s box office.

According to Donohue, this prediction proved to be false. The movie did so poorly at the box office, Donohue says, that Pullman decided not to go forward with the sequels and blamed Donohue for his decision.

Donohue&#x27;s position on this controversy was spelled out in a 31-page booklet, &quot;&quot;The Golden Compass&quot;: Agenda Unmasked&quot;. It details his objections to what he said were Pullman&#x27;s anti-Catholic comments, his books, and the movie.

=== Eucharist incident ===
In July 2008, a controversy arose surrounding a Communion rite altercation involving Webster Cook, a student and member of the University of Central Florida (UCF) student senate. Cook attended a Catholic Mass on campus and was given the Eucharist but walked out without consuming it. This action was allegedly related to his protest of the use of public funds for organized worship in the student union hall. According to Donohue, Cook&#x27;s actions were a form of desecration of the sacrament. Cook was proposed for censure by the student senate and was criticized by local media. He also received numerous death threats.

On his blog &quot;Pharyngula&quot;, biologist and University of Minnesota Morris (UMM) professor PZ Myers publicly expressed support for Cook as well as outrage that Fox News appeared to be inciting readers to cause further problems for the student. Myers invited readers to acquire some consecrated Eucharistic Hosts, which he described as &quot;crackers&quot;, for him to treat &quot;with profound disrespect.&quot;

The Catholic League accused Myers of anti-Catholic bigotry and asked UMM and the Minnesota State Legislature to take action against Myers. Myers then also received threats and hate mail. The Catholic League also called for Cook to be expelled from the university, with Donohue describing his confiscation of the Eucharist as a hate crime as well as a form of kidnapping. Donohue also accused those who supported Cook of anti-Catholic bigotry, and sent a letter to the UCF asking them to take legal action against Cook. A week after the initial communion Cook apologized and returned the Host. The Catholic League, however, continued to lobby the university for his expulsion.

=== Boycott of Roger Smith Hotel ===
In March 2007, a sculpture created by the Italian-Canadian artist Cosimo Cavallaro was to be displayed at Manhattan&#x27;s Roger Smith Hotel. The sculpture, entitled &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, was of a crucified Christ, nude, in molded chocolate. Although the artist is a practicing Catholic, Bill Donohue decried the work as &quot;hate speech&quot;, &quot;garbage&quot;, and &quot;one of the worst assaults on Christian sensibilities ever,&quot; describing Cavallaro as a &quot;loser artist&quot; and telling him in a television interview on &quot;Anderson Cooper 360&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re lucky I&#x27;m not like the Taliban, because you would lose more than your head.&quot;

Under the leadership of Donohue, the Catholic League organized a boycott of the hotel aimed at forcing it to remove the statue. The hotel&#x27;s management stating that the protests &quot;brought to our attention the unintended reaction of you and other conscientious friends&quot;, eventually agreed to the league&#x27;s calls, prompting the curator of the gallery, Matt Semler, to resign in protest. Semler said the six-foot sculpture was the victim of &quot;a strong-arming from people who haven&#x27;t seen the show, seen what we&#x27;re doing. They jumped to conclusions completely contrary to our intentions.&quot;

===Church child sex abuse issue===

Donohue said, in October 2009, that the Catholic Church has a &quot;homosexual&quot;, not a &quot;pedophilia&quot;, problem, citing the John Jay Report. The Catholic League has blamed the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), for having &quot;hired, hidden, defended, enabled, ignored and concealed the crimes of child molesters.&quot; The Catholic League defended attacking SNAP on the grounds that they were &quot;a menace to the Catholic Church.&quot;

In a November 18, 2009, &quot;Politics Daily&quot; column about Smith&#x27;s research, David Gibson reported that sexual identity should be &quot;separated from the problem of sexual abuse,&quot; according to criminologist Margaret Smith. Smith said, &quot;we do not find a connection between homosexual identity and an increased likelihood of sexual abuse.&quot; Nevertheless, Donohue says that this is a homosexual problem in the Catholic Church and not a pedophile one.

Donohue has been asked to respond to Smith&#x27;s position many times. He argues that &quot;if the acts were of a homosexual nature, and we know they were, it does not matter what the self-perception of the victimizers were.&quot;

====Irish Child Abuse Commission====

On May 20, 2009, Reuters reported the results of a nine-year investigation by the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, which looked into decades of endemic sexual abuse against children in Catholic-run reform schools in Ireland. In reaction to this report, popularly known as the Ryan Report, Donohue issued a statement downplaying the seriousness of the cases, questioning the inclusion of voyeurism and &quot;inappropriate sexual talk&quot; as instances of sexual abuse along with the more serious charge of rape. Donohue said that rape constituted only 12 percent of the listed sexual abuse cases in the Ryan report, and that priests committed only 12 percent of the listed rapes – the other 88 percent were committed by laypersons and religious brothers.

Since the Ryan Report was released, Donohue has been defending the church and saying that much of the outrage is &quot;moral hysteria&quot;. While stating that he agrees that rape and physical abuse are wrong and that he would not defend those actions, he says the report has conflated these abuses with &quot;lesser&quot; forms of punishment and is therefore not as serious. He also says many of the purported forms of abuse found by the commission were present and acceptable in the time period.

The Irish politician and child rape victim Colm O&#x27;Gorman was highly critical of such statements made by Donohue on the Irish radio show &quot;The Last Word&quot;. O&#x27;Gorman later wrote that Donohue&#x27;s analysis was shockingly &quot;simplistic&quot;.

=== Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home ===

In 2014, in the face of a public pressure campaign calling for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters in Ireland, Bill Donohue began his own campaign to challenge the prevailing narrative, going so far as to author a special report on the subject. Donohue largely dismissed the critics as being motivated by politics or liking &quot;to bash the Church.&quot; Donohue took exception with the findings presented by Catherine Corless, who he described as &quot;an amateur historian.&quot; Donohue and Corless debated on Irish radio, and he wrote extensively challenging her work and her credentials. Additionally, Donohue found flaws with how the media portrayed the mass graves found at the Mother and Baby Home, claiming that &quot;the statement issued by the Mother and Baby Commission was disturbing, but it never mentioned anything about a mass grave.&quot; From 2014 to 2017, Donohue issued two special reports and numerous pieces exploring why he believed this story was evidence of anti-Catholicism.

===Harry Knox and the White House faith-based office===
When President Barack Obama named gay activist Harry Knox to the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in 2009, Donohue termed Knox &quot;an anti-Catholic bigot who has called the pope a liar.&quot;

===David Wojnarowicz and National Portrait Gallery===
In November 2010, a portion of a video by the late artist David Wojnarowicz, which was included in an exhibit focused on gay-themed art, &quot;Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture&quot;
at the National Portrait Gallery, was removed after complaints from the
Catholic League. Columnist Frank Rich said of the intervention and removal that the Smithsonian had been &quot;bullied by bigots&quot; and quoted the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; art critic, Christopher Knight, to the same effect. Tracing the evolution of the issue, Rich cited a piece by Kriston Capps which in turn said &quot;the role of Penny Starr remains hazy. [However, a]...reporter and conservative advocate, [Starr] deserves much credit for both instigating&quot; the negative attention to the piece of art amongst a number in the show.

Donohue&#x27;s central complaint was the content of the &quot;vile video&quot;, as he called it. He objected to the video because it showed &quot;large ants eating away at Jesus on a crucifix,&quot; and was hosted in a museum funded by taxpayers.

===Mortara case===
Responding to David Kertzer&#x27;s book and Alfred Uhry&#x27;s play about the Mortara case, in which a Jewish boy was kidnapped on the order of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition, the Catholic League charged: &quot;Whether it&#x27;s based on fact or fiction, or whether it’s portrayed on the stage or on the screen, the Catholic bashers are a busy lot these days. They are as good at twisting the facts as they are at developing fictional accounts. Truth doesn’t matter. What matters is results.&quot;

What Donohue said was as follows.Why was Mortara baptized in the first place? Because the servant girl thought he was dying and was in need of salvation. Why was he taken from his family? Because it was the considered judgment of the Church at the time that a baptized Christian could not be raised in a Jewish home. He had to be removed lest the Church be party to apostasy. The validity of Baptism was also being tested. And so what happened to this poor kid? As he grew up he developed a father-son relationship with Pope Pius IX. He even became a priest.

=== &quot;Walt&#x27;s Disenchanted Kingdom&quot; ===
In January 2023, the Catholic League released &quot;Walt&#x27;s Disenchanted Kingdom&quot;. This documentary recounts the cultural shift at Disney. The film was written and directed by Jason Killian Meath. Bill Donohue served as the executive producer. It is hosted by Mercedes Schlapp and features interviews with Donohue, Tony Perkins, Ben Carson, Vivek Ramaswamy, Miranda Devine, Brent Bozell, David Horowitz, and Christian Toto. The film was initially released to SalemNow, YouTube, Rumble, and Amazon Prime Video.

&quot;Walt&#x27;s Disenchanted Kingdom&quot; has been aired at several film festivals, including the Indie Short Fest where it won technical awards for &quot;best editing&quot; and &quot;best sound editing&quot; along with an Outstanding Achievement Award.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
When the Los Angeles Dodgers planned their annual Pride Night in 2023, they invited the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a charity group of gay men who dress up as nuns to bring attention to sexual intolerance and gender. The team received backlash from the Catholic League, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Catholic Vote. Catholic League president Bill Donohue sent a letter to commissioner Rob Manfred comparing the group&#x27;s performances to blackface. The Dodgers subsequently disinvited the group, likely owing to the large Catholic population of the city. KNBC reported that &quot;the Dodgers pulled the Sisters from their Pride Night the day after Bill Donohue, president and CEO of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, had emailed Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred to urge the team to yank the group.&quot;

In response, the Los Angeles LGBT Center, the ACLU, County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, City Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, State Senator Scott Wiener, and the Sisters called for the group to be reinvited, and the LGBT Center and LA Pride backed out of Pride Night. The nearby Los Angeles Angels even promised to invite the group to their Pride Night instead. However, the Dodgers reversed their decision on May 22, 2023, and announced the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence were once again welcome at the event. The group accepted the team&#x27;s apology.

Following the decision to reinvite the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, the Catholic League called for a boycott of the Dodgers&#x27; Pride Night. The Catholic League took out 50 radio ads on KABC and contacted many prominent stakeholders in Los Angeles. These efforts purportedly helped contribute to a dip in attendance for the game against the San Francisco Giants.

==Criticism==
In 1997, David Carlin of &quot;Commonweal&quot; criticized Donohue and the Catholic League for being overly sensitive in the identification of anti-Catholicism. In 1999, the Jesuit priest James Martin, the associate editor of the Catholic magazine &quot;America&quot; wrote &quot;Often their criticism is right on target, but frequently they speak without seeing or experiencing what they are critiquing, and that undercuts their credibility. Unfortunately, that type of response gives people the idea that the Catholic Church is unreflective.&quot; Andrew Ferguson argued that Donohue was doing the cause of anti-Catholicism a service by his overly aggressive tactics, arguing, &quot;The Catholic League president is doing more to discredit the Catholic church than perhaps anyone else.&quot;.

Donohue responded to Ferguson in his book, &quot;The Truth about Clergy Sexual Abuse: Clarifying the Facts and the Causes.&quot; He criticized Ferguson for citing the Pennsylvania grand jury report of 2018 as though it was authoritative. In fact, none of what is in a grand-jury report should be assumed to be factual.

Former Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz knows better:

“The grand jury has a specific function. It’s supposed to only indict or not indict. Indeed, prosecutors generally don’t issue reports for that reason because they only hear one side of the case. They don’t hear the other side. There’s no cross examination of witnesses. That’s why it is regarded as wrong for prosecutors to issue reports.”

It is precisely because grand-jury reports are not factual that the Catholic League filed an amicus brief challenging the right of the Pennsylvania grand-jury report to make public the names of eleven priests who claimed that doing so would violate their reputational rights as guaranteed by the state constitution. On December 3, 2018, our case, handled by Pittsburgh lawyers from Jones Day, won: the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled 6-1 in our favor. In November 2019, a Pennsylvania Supreme Court task force, which had been empaneled two years earlier, vindicated our effort: it recommended abolishing grand-jury reports.

<doc id="332582" wikidata="Q1361883" url="?curid=332582" title="Madrigal (Trecento)">
<text>The Trecento Madrigal is an Italian musical form of the 14th century. It is quite distinct from the madrigal of the Renaissance and early Baroque, with which it shares only the name. The madrigal of the Trecento flourished ca. 1340–1370 with a short revival near 1400. It was a composition for two (or rarely three) voices, sometimes on a pastoral subject. In its earliest development it was simple construction: Francesco da Barberino in 1300 called it a &quot;raw and chaotic singalong&quot;.

The text of the madrigal is divided into three sections: two strophes called terzetti set to the same music and a concluding section called the ritornello usually in a different meter, creating an aaB form.

==History==
The origins of the madrigal are obscure, and debated, with one school of thought seeing it as a secular mutation of the conductus of the &quot;ars antiqua&quot;, and another seeing it as deriving from 13th-century secular monophonic song with an improvised accompaniment. Little Italian music from the 13th century has survived, so links between medieval forms such as the conductus and troubadour song and the music of the trecento are largely inferential. The origin of the name (which appears in early sources as &quot;madriale&quot;, &quot;matricale&quot;, &quot;madregal&quot;, and &quot;marigalis&quot;) is also unclear; two possibilities are derivation from &quot;materialis&quot; (in contrast to &quot;formalis&quot;), designating a poem without a definite form, or from &quot;matrix&quot;, meaning mother, either as in a song in the mother tongue or music used for Mother Church.

The earliest stage in the development of the madrigal is seen in the Rossi Codex, a collection of music from ca. 1350 or earlier, compiled around 1370. It has been suggested that the ornamentation of the upper voices may be improvised above a skeletal structure.

In the madrigal&#x27;s later stages of development its uppermost voice was often highly elaborate, with the lower voice, the tenor, much less so. The form at this time was probably a development of connoisseurs, and sung by small groups of cognoscenti; there is no evidence of its widespread popularity, unlike the madrigal of the 16th century. By the end of the 14th century it had fallen out of favor, with other forms (in particular, the ballata and imported French music) taking precedence, some of which were even more highly refined and ornamented.

By the beginning of 15th century the term was no longer used musically. The later, 16th-century madrigal is unrelated, although it often used texts written in the 14th century (for instance by Petrarch).

<text>Ian Andrew Robert Stewart (18 July 1938 – 12 December 1985) was a British keyboardist and co-founder of the Rolling Stones. He was removed from the lineup in May 1963 at the request of manager Andrew Loog Oldham who felt he did not fit the band&#x27;s image. He remained as road manager and pianist for over two decades until his death, and was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with the rest of the band in 1989.

==Early life==
Stewart was born at his mother&#x27;s family farm, Kirklatch, at Pittenweem, in the East Neuk of Fife, Scotland, and raised in Sutton, son of architect John Stewart and Annie, née Black. He attended Tiffin School, Kingston upon Thames, Greater London. Stewart (often called Stu) started playing piano when he was six. He took up the banjo and played with amateur groups on both instruments.

==Career==
===Role in The Rolling Stones===
Stewart, who loved rhythm &amp; blues, boogie-woogie, blues and big-band jazz, was working as a shipping clerk at a London chemical company when he was the first to respond to Brian Jones&#x27;s advertisement in &quot;Jazz News&quot; of 2 May 1962 seeking musicians to form a rhythm &amp; blues group. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards joined in June, and the group, with Dick Taylor (later of the Pretty Things) on bass and Mick Avory (later of the Kinks) on drums, played their first gig under the name the Rollin&#x27; Stones at the Marquee Club on 12 July 1962. Richards described meeting Stewart thus: &quot;He used to play boogie-woogie piano in jazz clubs, apart from his regular job. He blew my head off too, when he started to play. I never heard a white piano player play like that before.&quot; By December 1962 and January 1963, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts had joined, replacing a series of bassists and drummers.

During this period, Stewart had a job at Imperial Chemical Industries. None of the other band members had a telephone; Stewart said, &quot;[My] desk at ICI was the headquarters of the Stones organisation. My number was advertised in &quot;Jazz News&quot; and I handled the Stones&#x27; bookings at work.&quot; He also bought a van to transport the group and their equipment to their gigs.

In early May 1963, the band&#x27;s manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, said Stewart should no longer be onstage, that six members were too many for a popular group and that the older, burly, and square-jawed Stewart did not fit the image. He said Stewart could stay as road manager and play piano on recordings. Stewart accepted this demotion. Richards said: &quot;[Stu] might have realised that in the way it was going to have to be marketed, he would be out of sync, but that he could still be a vital part. I&#x27;d probably have said, &#x27;Well, fuck you&#x27;, but he said &#x27;OK, I&#x27;ll just drive you around.&#x27; That takes a big heart, but Stu had one of the largest hearts around.&quot;

Stewart loaded gear into his van, drove the group to gigs, replaced guitar strings and set up Watts&#x27;s drums the way he himself would play them. &quot;I never ever swore at him,&quot; Watts said of their relationship. He also played piano and occasionally organ on most of the band&#x27;s albums in the first decades, as well as providing criticism. Shortly after Stewart&#x27;s death Mick Jagger said: &quot;He really helped this band swing, on numbers like &#x27;Honky Tonk Women&#x27; and loads of others. Stu was the one guy we tried to please. We wanted his approval when we were writing or rehearsing a song. We&#x27;d want him to like it.&quot;

Stewart contributed piano, organ, electric piano and/or percussion to all Rolling Stones albums released between 1964 and 1986, except for &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, and &quot;Some Girls&quot;. Stewart was not the only keyboard player who worked extensively with the band: Jack Nitzsche, Nicky Hopkins, Billy Preston, and Ian McLagan all supplemented his work. Stewart played piano on numbers of his choosing throughout tours in 1969, 1972, 1975–76, 1978 and 1981–82. Stewart favoured blues and country rockers, and remained dedicated to boogie-woogie and early rhythm &amp; blues. He refused to play in minor keys, saying: &quot;When I&#x27;m on stage with the Stones and a minor chord comes along, I lift me hands in protest.&quot; In 1976, Stewart stated, &quot;You can squawk about money, but the money the Stones have made hasn&#x27;t done them much good. It&#x27;s really gotten them into some trouble. They can&#x27;t even live in their own country now,&quot; referring to band members&#x27; tax exile status to minimize tax obligations on their high incomes and royalty payments.

Stewart remained aloof from the band&#x27;s drug abuse and partying lifestyle. &quot;I think he looked upon it as a load of silliness,&quot; said guitarist Mick Taylor. &quot;I also think it was because he saw what had happened to Brian. I could tell from the expression on his face when things started to get a bit crazy during the making of &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot;. I think he found it very hard. We all did.&quot; Stewart played golf, and as road manager showed a preference for hotels with courses. Richards recalls: &quot;We&#x27;d be playing in some town where there&#x27;s all these chicks, and they want to get laid and we want to lay them. But Stu would have booked us into some hotel about ten miles out of town. You&#x27;d wake up in the morning and there&#x27;s the links. We&#x27;re bored to death looking for some action and Stu&#x27;s playing Gleneagles.&quot;

===Other work===
Stewart contributed to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; from &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; and &quot;Boogie with Stu&quot; (which was also named after his nickname) from &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;, two numbers in traditional rock and roll vein, both featuring his boogie-woogie style. Another was Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s 1971 &quot;The London Howlin&#x27; Wolf Sessions&quot; album, featuring Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Klaus Voormann, Steve Winwood, and Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts. He also played piano and organ on the 1982 &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; album of George Thorogood and the Destroyers. He also performed with Ronnie Lane in a televised concert.

On 5 January 1966 Bill Wyman produced &quot;Stu-Ball&quot; for Ian Stewart and the Railroaders at IBC Studios, London with Stewart on piano, Wyman on bass, Keith Richards (guitar) and Tony Meehan (drums).

In 1981 Stewart and Charlie Watts contributed to the song &quot;Bad Penny Blues&quot;, which appeared on the album, &quot;These Kind of Blues&quot; by The Blues Band, and was a founding member, with Watts, of Rocket 88.

==Personal life==
Stewart married Cynthia Dillane on 2 January 1967, together they had a son named Giles. Through his son Stewart has four grandchildren.

==Death and posthumous recognition==
Stewart contributed to The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1983 &quot;Undercover&quot;, and was present during the 1985 recording for &quot;Dirty Work&quot; (released in 1986). In early December 1985, Stewart began having respiratory problems. On 12 December, he went to a clinic to have the problem examined, but suffered a massive heart attack and died in the waiting room. Stewart was 47 years old.

The Rolling Stones played a tribute gig with Rocket 88 in February 1986 at London&#x27;s 100 Club, and included a 30-second clip of Stewart playing the blues standard &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; at the end of &quot;Dirty Work&quot;. When the Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, they requested that Stewart&#x27;s name be included.

In his 2010 autobiography &quot;Life&quot;, Keith Richards says: &quot;Ian Stewart. I&#x27;m still working for him. To me The Rolling Stones is his band. Without his knowledge and organisation ... we&#x27;d be nowhere.&quot;

On 19 April 2011, pianist Ben Waters released an Ian Stewart tribute album, entitled &quot;Boogie 4 Stu&quot;. One of the songs recorded for this album was Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Watching the River Flow&quot;, played by The Rolling Stones featuring Bill Wyman on bass. This was the first time since 1992 that Wyman joined his former band.

Stewart was honored by the Scottish Music Awards in 2017. Jagger, Richards, Wood and Watts all sent video messages for the ceremony and the award was accepted by Stewart&#x27;s widow and son.

===Works inspired by Stewart===
According to a &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; article in March 2006, Stewart was the basis for a fictional detective:

The lyrics to Aidan Moffat &amp; the Best-Of&#x27;s song &quot;The Sixth Stone&quot; were written by Ian Rankin about Stewart. The song is included on Chemikal Underground&#x27;s compilation &quot;Ballads of the Book&quot;, which featured Scottish authors and poets writing lyrics for contemporary Scottish bands.

It is a concept album dealing with how American culture might have been different had the Vikings managed to colonise the continent. The album is a tour through various styles of American music (&quot;The Lay of the Surfers&quot; is a Beach Boys parody), filled with references to modern American culture and ancient Norse myths and legends. The album was re-released in the late 1990s by BGO Records.

<doc id="332590" wikidata="Q1451726" url="?curid=332590" title="Aelius Festus Aphthonius">
<text>Aelius Festus Aphthonius is believed to be the author (otherwise unknown) of a Latin work called &quot;De metris omnibus&quot; (&quot;About all the metres&quot;) incorporated as part of the &quot;Ars Grammatica&quot; of the fourth-century AD Christian writer Gaius Marius Victorinus.

The manuscripts of Victorinus&#x27;s &quot;Ars Grammatica&quot; end with the words: &quot;Aelii Festi Aphthonii V.P. de metris omnibus explicit liber iiii&quot; (&quot;here ends the 4th book of Aelius Festus Aphthonius&#x27;s &quot;de metris omnibus&quot;&quot;). Scholars have taken different views of this. Some, such as Heinrich Keil, the 19th century editor of Marius Victorinus, believed that Victorinus published the work of an earlier writer Aphthonius, to which he added an introduction and an appendix on the metres of Horace. The philologist P. Monceaux, however, writing in 1905, suggested that Aphthonius was later than Victorinus, and replaced part of Victorinus&#x27;s work with his own. A third view is expressed by Bruce (1949), who writes: &quot;In the present state of uncertainty, the uniformity of style and language seems to justify us in treating the whole of the &quot;Ars Grammatica&quot; as the work of Victorinus.&quot; In the 2012 assessment of Rita Copeland and Ineke Sluiter, &#x27;most of the &quot;Ars grammatica&quot;, as edited by Keil ... has now been recognized as the &quot;De metris&quot; of Aphthonius ... Only the opening section of the treatise ... is the work of Victorinus&#x27;.

<doc id="332593" wikidata="Q128847" url="?curid=332593" title="Leah">
<text>Leah () appears in the Hebrew Bible as one of the two wives of the Biblical patriarch Jacob. Leah was Jacob&#x27;s first wife, and the older sister of his second (and favored) wife Rachel. She is the mother of Jacob&#x27;s first son Reuben. She has three more sons, namely Simeon, Levi and Judah, but does not bear another son until Rachel offers her a night with Jacob in exchange for some mandrake root (, &quot;dûdâ&#x27;îm&quot;). Leah gives birth to two more sons after this, Issachar and Zebulun, and to Jacob&#x27;s only daughter, Dinah.

==Name==
Leah means &quot;wild cow”, a common title with ancient goddesses like Inana, Urash, and Nanshe. Rachel means &quot;ewe lamb.&quot; Noegel says there&#x27;s an irony involving Laban&#x27;s flocks within this detail, one is on generative acts, - &quot;Give me my wife for my days are fulfilled, that I may go into her&quot; (אליה) (29:21). Herein also lies a subtle pun on Leah&#x27;s name, which occurs again in 29:23.

== Biblical narrative ==
===Overview===
Leah first appears in the Book of Genesis, in Genesis 29, which describes her as the daughter of Laban and the older sister of Rachel, and is said to not compare to Rachel&#x27;s physical beauty and that she has tender eyes. Earlier passages in the Book of Genesis give some background on her father&#x27;s family, noting that through him, she is the niece of Rebecca, who is the wife of Isaac and the mother of Jacob and Esau, and the granddaughter of Bethuel, and rabbinic literature goes even further, with the Book of Jasher claiming Leah and Rachel were twins and recording her mother&#x27;s name as Adinah and her brothers&#x27; names as Beor, Alub, and Murash. Rabbinical literature contradicts itself on whether Leah and Rachel were half-siblings to Zilpah and Bilhah, two sisters who would serve as mistresses to Leah&#x27;s future husband, Jacob, and whose children she and Rachel would raise as their own, as one source lists them as being daughters of Laban, but not his wife Adinah, and another lists them as being the daughters of Rotheus, a man who was close to Laban but not related to him. If Zilpah and Bilhah were indeed half-sisters of Leah, this would make Leah&#x27;s adoptive sons, Gad and Asher, and Rachel&#x27;s adoptive sons, Dan and Naphtali, her nephews. According to Genesis 28:2, the family resided in Paddan Aram, an area believed to correspond with the historical Upper Mesopotamia.

Prior to her and Rachel&#x27;s mentioning, the book of Genesis details how their first cousin and future husband, Jacob, with the help of his mother, Rebecca, willfully deceives his dying father, Isaac, into giving him his twin brother Esau&#x27;s birthright. Fearful of his brother&#x27;s wrath, Jacob flees his homeland for Haran, where he meets his maternal family, including Laban and his daughters. Biblical passages are dismissive of Leah and favorable of Rachel, with Rachel said to be beautiful and of Leah, only that she had &quot;weary&quot;, &quot;tired&quot; or &quot;tender&quot; eyes. Jacob is eager to marry Rachel and agrees to provide seven years&#x27; labor to her father if he can marry her. Laban initially agrees but, on the night of what would&#x27;ve been Jacob and Rachel&#x27;s wedding, Laban reneges; he insists Jacob marry Leah instead, as she is older. Jacob is ultimately allowed to marry Rachel, which he does immediately after the festivities related to his wedding to Leah end, in exchange for another seven years&#x27; labor.

Leah&#x27;s life as Jacob&#x27;s wife was distressful. So lonely was she that even the Lord took notice of it and blessed her with many children as consolation. Due to the extreme emotional distress suffered by both Leah (and Rachel) during the marriage, Yahweh later strictly clarified his opposition to uncovering the nakedness of a woman and her sister while both were still living (Genesis 30:1, Leviticus 18:18).

Despite Rachel&#x27;s infertility, Jacob still favored Rachel over her. He also favored Rachel&#x27;s sons, Joseph and Benjamin, over Leah&#x27;s, and made no attempts to hide that from her or his other children. According to 1 Chronicles 5:1, Jacob took the firstborn&#x27;s birthright, which entitles a firstborn to a larger inheritance in Jewish law, from Reuben, his oldest son, to Joseph, who was his second-youngest son, and, in Genesis 33:2, when he is confronted by Esau, puts Leah, along with Zilpah and Bilhah and all of their sons, in front of himself, Rachel, and Joseph, to be used as something of a buffer or a shield to protect himself in the event the confrontation turned violent.

===Appearance===
The Torah introduces Leah by describing her with the phrase, &quot;Leah had tender eyes&quot; () (Genesis 29:17). It is argued as to whether the adjective &quot;tender&quot; () should be taken to mean &quot;delicate and soft&quot; or rather &quot;weary&quot; or &quot;weak&quot;.

The commentary of Rashi cites a Rabbinic interpretation of how Leah&#x27;s eyes became weak. According to this story, Leah was destined to marry Jacob&#x27;s older twin brother, Esau. In the Rabbinic mind, the two brothers are polar opposites; Jacob being a God-fearing scholar and Esau being a hunter who also indulges in idolatry and adultery. But people were saying, &quot;Laban has two daughters and his sister, Rebekah, has two sons. The older daughter (Leah) will marry the older son (Esau), and the younger daughter (Rachel) will marry the younger son (Jacob).&quot; Hearing this, Leah spent most of her time weeping and praying to God to change her destined mate. Thus the Torah describes her eyes as &quot;soft&quot; from weeping. God hearkens to Leah&#x27;s tears and prayers and allows her to marry Jacob even before Rachel does.

===Marriage to Jacob===
Leah becomes Jacob&#x27;s wife through a deception on the part of her father, Laban. In the Biblical account, Jacob is dispatched to the hometown of Labanthe brother of his mother Rebekahto avoid being killed by his brother Esau, and to find a wife. Out by the well, he encounters Laban&#x27;s younger daughter Rachel tending her father&#x27;s sheep, and decides to marry her. Laban is willing to give Rachel&#x27;s hand to Jacob as long as he works seven years for her.

On the wedding night, however, Laban switches Leah for Rachel. Later Laban claims that it is uncustomary to give the younger daughter away in marriage before the older one (Genesis 29:16–30). Laban offers to give Rachel to Jacob in marriage in return for another seven years of work (Genesis 29:27). Jacob accepts the offer and marries Rachel after the week-long celebration of his marriage to Leah.


===Motherhood===
Leah was the mother of six of Jacob&#x27;s sons, including his first four (Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah), and later two more (Issachar and Zebulun), and a daughter (Dinah). According to the scriptures, God saw that Leah was &quot;unloved&quot; and opened her womb as consolation. Through her sons Levi and Judah, she is thus the matriarch of both the priestly (Levite) and royal (Judahite) tribes in Israel.

Seeing that she was unable to conceive, Rachel offered her handmaid Bilhah to Jacob, and named and raised the two sons (Dan and Naphtali) that Bilhah gave birth to. Leah responded by offering her handmaid Zilpah to Jacob, and named and raised the two sons (Gad and Asher) that Zilpah gave birth to. According to some commentaries, Bilhah and Zilpah are actually half-sisters of Leah and Rachel.

One day, Leah&#x27;s firstborn son Reuben returned from the field with mandrakes for his mother. Leah had not conceived for a while, and the plant, whose roots resemble the human body, was thought to be an aid to fertility. Frustrated that she was not able to conceive at all, Rachel offered to trade her night with their husband with Leah in return for the mandrakes. Leah agreed, and that night she slept with Jacob and conceived Issachar. Afterwards she gave birth to Zebulun and to a daughter, Dinah. After that, God remembered Rachel and gave her two sons, Joseph and Benjamin.

=== Rivalry with Rachel ===
On a homiletical level, the classic Chassidic texts explain the sisters&#x27; rivalry as more than marital jealousy. Each woman desired to grow spiritually in her (service of God), and therefore sought closeness to the (Jacob) who is God&#x27;s personal emissary in this world. By marrying Jacob and bearing his sons, who would be raised in the &#x27;s home and continue his mission into the next generation (indeed, all 12 sons became in their own right and formed the foundation of the Nation of Israel), they would develop an even closer relationship to God. Therefore, Leah and Rachel each wanted to have as many of those sons as possible, going so far as to offer their handmaids as proxies to Jacob so they could have a share in the upbringing of their handmaids&#x27; sons, too.

Each woman also continually questioned whether she was doing enough in her personal efforts toward increased spirituality, and would use the other&#x27;s example to spur herself on. Rachel envied Leah&#x27;s tearful prayers, by which she merited to marry the and bear six of his twelve sons. The Talmud (&quot;Megillah&quot; 13b) says that Rachel revealed to Leah the secret signs which she and Jacob had devised to identify the veiled bride, because they both suspected Laban would pull such a trick.

===Death and burial===
Leah died some time before Jacob (according to Genesis 49:31). She is thought to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron alongside Jacob. This cave also houses the graves of Abraham and Sarah, and Isaac and Rebekah.
==Medieval Christian symbolism==
In medieval Christian symbolism, Rachel was taken as a symbol of the contemplative (monastic) Christian life, and Leah as a symbol of the active (non-monastic) life. Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot; includes a dream of Rachel and Leah, which inspired illustrations by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and others:
&quot;... in my dream, I seemed to see a woman
both young and fair; along a plain she gathered
flowers, and even as she sang, she said:
Whoever asks my name, know that I&#x27;m Leah,
and I apply my lovely hands to fashion
a garland of the flowers I have gathered.&quot;

<text>Kitzingen is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Schweinfurt, Bamberg, Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim and Würzburg.

==History==
The district in its present form was established in the administrative reform of 1973. The former district of Gerolzhofen was dissolved, and half of its territory was merged with the Kitzingen district (which had been much smaller before). The city of Kitzingen lost its status as a district-free city and was incorporated into the district.

==Geography==
The river Main runs through the district from north to south.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the bridge from the arms of the town of Kitzingen
* the grapes are symbolising the viticulture
* the shield in the left is from the Bishopric of Würzburg, which once ruled over the region
* the shield in the right is from the arms of the principality of Castell

<doc id="332621" wikidata="Q5737811" url="?curid=332621" title="Hereditarily finite set">
<text>In mathematics and set theory, hereditarily finite sets are defined as finite sets whose elements are all hereditarily finite sets. In other words, the set itself is finite, and all of its elements are finite sets, recursively all the way down to the empty set.

==Formal definition==
A recursive definition of well-founded hereditarily finite sets is as follows:
: &quot;Base case&quot;: The empty set is a hereditarily finite set.
: &quot;Recursion rule&quot;: If formula_1 are hereditarily finite, then so is formula_2.
Only sets that can be built by a finite number of applications of these two rules are hereditarily finite.

===Representation===
This class of sets is naturally ranked by the number of bracket pairs necessary to represent the sets:

* formula_3 (i.e. formula_4, the Neumann ordinal &quot;0&quot;)
* formula_5 (i.e. formula_6 or formula_7, the Neumann ordinal &quot;1&quot;)
* formula_8
* formula_9 and then also formula_10 (i.e. formula_11, the Neumann ordinal &quot;2&quot;),
* formula_12, formula_13 as well as formula_14,
* ... sets represented with formula_15 bracket pairs, e.g. formula_16. There are six such sets
* ... sets represented with formula_17 bracket pairs, e.g. formula_18. There are twelve such sets
* ... sets represented with formula_19 bracket pairs, e.g. formula_20 or formula_21 (i.e. formula_22, the Neumann ordinal &quot;3&quot;)
* ... etc.
In this way, the number of sets with formula_23 bracket pairs is
==Discussion==
The set formula_14 is an example for such a hereditarily finite set and so is the empty set formula_3, as noted. 
On the other hand, the sets formula_26 or formula_27 are examples of finite sets that are not &quot;hereditarily&quot; finite. For example, the first cannot be hereditarily finite since it contains at least one infinite set as an element, when formula_28.

The class of all hereditarily finite sets is denoted by formula_29, meaning that the cardinality of each member is smaller than formula_30. (Analogously, the class of hereditarily &quot;countable&quot; sets is denoted by formula_31.)
formula_29 is in bijective correspondence with formula_30.
It can also be denoted by formula_34, which denotes the formula_35th stage of the von Neumann universe.
So here it is a countable set.

==Models==
===Ackermann coding===
In 1937, Wilhelm Ackermann introduced an encoding of hereditarily finite sets as natural numbers.
It is defined by a function formula_36 that maps each hereditarily finite set to a natural number, given by the following recursive definition:
{{bi|left=1.6|formula_37}}
For example, the empty set formula_3 contains no members, and is therefore mapped to an empty sum, that is, the number zero. On the other hand, a set with distinct members formula_39 is mapped to formula_40.

The inverse is given by
{{bi|left=1.6|formula_41}}
{{bi|left=1.6|formula_42}}
where BIT denotes the BIT predicate.

The Ackermann coding can be used to construct a model of finitary set theory in the natural numbers. More precisely, formula_43 (where formula_44 is the converse relation of formula_45, swapping its two arguments) models Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory ZF without the axiom of infinity. Here, each natural number models a set, and the formula_45 relation models the membership relation between sets.

===Graph models===
The class formula_29 can be seen to be in exact correspondence with a class of rooted trees, namely those without non-trivial symmetries (i.e. the only automorphism is the identity): 
The root vertex corresponds to the top level bracket formula_48 and each edge leads to an element (another such set) that can act as a root vertex in its own right. No automorphism of this graph exist, corresponding to the fact that equal branches are identified (e.g. formula_49, trivializing the permutation of the two subgraphs of shape formula_50).
This graph model enables an implementation of ZF without infinity as data types and thus an interpretation of set theory in expressive type theories.

Graph models exist for ZF and also set theories different from Zermelo set theory, such as non-well founded theories. Such models have more intricate edge structure.

In graph theory, the graph whose vertices correspond to hereditarily finite sets and edges correspond to set membership is the Rado graph or random graph.

==Axiomatizations==
===Theories of finite sets===
In the common axiomatic set theory approaches, the empty set formula_3 also represents the first von Neumann ordinal number, denoted formula_52. All finite von Neumann ordinals are indeed hereditarily finite and, thus, so is the class of sets representing the natural numbers. In other words, formula_29 includes each element in the standard model of natural numbers and so a set theory expressing formula_29 must necessarily contain them as well.

Now note that Robinson arithmetic can already be interpreted in ST, the very small sub-theory of Zermelo set theory Z− with its axioms given by Extensionality, Empty Set and Adjunction. All of formula_29 has a constructive axiomatization involving these axioms and e.g. Set induction and Replacement.

Axiomatically characterizing the theory of hereditarily finite sets, the negation of the axiom of infinity may be added. As the theory validates the other axioms of formula_56, this establishes that the axiom of infinity is not a consequence of these other formula_56 axioms.

===ZF===
The hereditarily finite sets are a subclass of the Von Neumann universe. Here, the class of all well-founded hereditarily finite sets is denoted formula_58. Note that this is also a set in this context.

If we denote by formula_59 the power set of formula_60, and by formula_61 the empty set, then formula_58 can be obtained by setting formula_63 for each integer formula_64. Thus, formula_58 can be expressed as
{{bi|left=1.6|formula_66}}
and all its elements are finite.

This formulation shows, again, that there are only countably many hereditarily finite sets: formula_67 is finite for any finite formula_23, its cardinality is formula_69 in Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation (a tower of formula_70 powers of two), and the union of countably many finite sets is countable.

Equivalently, a set is hereditarily finite if and only if its transitive closure is finite.

<doc id="332625" wikidata="Q420942" url="?curid=332625" title="Saab 92">
<text>The Saab 92 was the first production car from Saab. The design was very aerodynamic for its time, with a drag coefficient (&quot;cx&quot; or &quot;cw&quot;) of 0.30. The entire body was stamped out of one piece of sheet metal and then cut to accommodate doors and windows. Full-scale production started December 12, 1949, based on the prototype Ursaab. All of them were of the Deluxe version. A standard version was advertised, but nobody was interested in buying it so no standard versions were produced.

The engine was a transversely-mounted, water-cooled two-cylinder, two-stroke 764 cc displacement, 25 hp (19 kW) engine based on a DKW design, giving a top speed of . The transmission had three gears, the first unsynchronised. In order to overcome the problems of oil starvation during overrun (engine braking) for the two-stroke engine, a freewheel device was fitted. The suspension was by torsion bars.

All early Saab 92s were painted in a dark green colour similar to British racing green. According to some sources, Saab had a surplus of green paint from wartime production of airplanes; &quot;All the cars were painted bottle green, a colour that became something of a trade mark for Saab cars. The underlying reason was that the armed forces had bought large quantities of a green cellulose paint for camouflage painting. However, the paint did not suit the terrain and the entire consignment of paint was sold off. Saab bought it and that was why both the aircraft and cars ended up green.&quot;

Saab&#x27;s rally history already started two weeks after the 92 was released, when Saab&#x27;s head engineer Rolf Mellde entered the Swedish Rally and came second in his class.

Only 700 1950 models were made. In 1951, German VDO instruments replaced the originally-fitted American Stewart-Warner components.

In 1952 Greta Molander won the &#x27;Coupe des Dames&#x27; of the Monte Carlo Rally in a 92, tuned to 35 hp (26 kW). In 1953, the 92B arrived with a much larger rear window and larger luggage space (with an opening lid). It was now available in grey, blue-grey, black and green. In 1954 the Saab 92 got the new Solex 32BI carburetor and a new ignition coil giving 28 hp (21 kW). The US headlights were replaced with Hella units. Another novelty was that a textile roof (semi-cab or cabrio coach) was offered as an option. The colour maroon was also introduced this year. In 1955, it acquired an electric fuel pump and square tail lights installed in the rear fenders. The colours were grey, maroon and a new color, moss green.

The English aviation test pilot Bob Moore, who had helped to develop the Saab Tunnan (&quot;J29&quot;) jet aircraft, brought a 1955 Saab 92B back to England, when he returned, later to become the first managing director of Saab GB Ltd. This was reputedly the first-ever Saab car imported to the UK.

The Saab 93 was introduced in December 1955, but both the 92B and 93 were produced at the same time, for a while. The last 92 was assembled in late 1956–early 1957. Two new colours, grey-green and beige, were available. A total of 20,128 Saab 92s were made.

The Saab 92 appears on a Swedish postage stamp.

<text>Hailes Abbey is a former Cistercian abbey, in the small village of Hailes, two miles northeast of Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, England. It was founded in 1246 as a daughter establishment of Beaulieu Abbey. The abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1539. Little remains of the abbey. It is a Grade I listed building and a scheduled monument.

The site is owned by the National Trust but managed by English Heritage. There is a museum on the site holding many artefacts from the Abbey.

==History==

The abbey was founded in 1246 by Richard of Cornwall, the younger brother of Henry III. Richard was elected by the German Princes as Holy Roman Emperor but Pope Alexander IV refused him use of the title, henceforth he was styled King of the Romans. Richard founded the abbey to thank God after surviving a shipwreck. Richard had been granted the manor of Hailes by King Henry, and settled it with a group of twenty Cistercian monks and ten lay brothers, led by Prior Jordan, from Beaulieu Abbey in Hampshire. The great Cistercian abbey was entirely built in a single campaign in 1277, and was consecrated in a royal ceremony that included the King and Queen and 15 bishops. It was one of the last Cistercian houses to be founded in England.

Hailes Abbey became a site of pilgrimage after Richard&#x27;s son Edmund donated to the Cistercian community a phial of the Holy Blood, purchased in Germany, in 1270. Such a relic of the Crucifixion was a considerable magnet for pilgrimage. From the proceeds, the monks of Hailes were able to rebuild the Abbey on a magnificent scale. One Abbot of Hailes was executed as a rebel after the Battle of Bramham Moor, in 1408.

Though King Henry VIII&#x27;s commissioners declared the famous relic to be nothing but the blood of a duck, regularly renewed, and though the Abbot, Stephen Sagar, admitted that the Holy Blood was a fake in hope of saving the Abbey, Hailes Abbey was one of the last religious institutions to acquiesce following the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535. The Abbot and his monks finally surrendered their abbey to Henry&#x27;s commissioners on Christmas Eve 1539.

Following the Dissolution, the west range consisting of the Abbot&#x27;s own apartments was converted into a house and was home to the Tracy family in the seventeenth century, but these buildings were later demolished and now all that remains are a few low arches in a meadow with outlines in the grass. Surviving remains include the small church for the disappeared parish, with unrestored medieval wall-paintings.

In 1937 the site was donated to the National Trust and in 1948 the Ministry of Works, a predecessor of English Heritage, assumed responsibility for the abbey.

==Burials==
Among those buried at the Abbey were the founder, Richard of Cornwall, his second wife, Sanchia of Provence, and his sons, Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall and Henry of Almain.

==Hailes Church==
Outside the remains of the Abbey is Hailes Church. The church is older than the abbey, and was consecrated in 1175. It later served as the &quot;capella ante portas&quot; (Latin for &#x27;chapel outside the gates&#x27;) to the Abbey until the Abbey&#x27;s dissolution in 1539. Inside the church are fine 14th-century wall paintings depicting St Catherine and St Christopher, on the north wall, and St Margaret and coursing scenes, on the south. The church is also a Grade I listed building. The church is part of the Eastern Parishes benefice, north of Winchcombe, and occasional services are held.

<text>Greenwich station is about 400 m south-west of the district centre, in London, England. It is an interchange between National Rail between central London and Dartford (north Kent), and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) between Lewisham to the south and Docklands and the City of London. It is in Travelcard Zones 2 and 3.

It is the nearest National Rail station to the centre of Greenwich, but Cutty Sark for Maritime Greenwich DLR station is closer to the town centre and its tourist attractions.

East of the station the Dartford line goes through a tunnel underneath the grounds of the National Maritime Museum, towards Maze Hill. Northwards, the DLR goes into a tunnel through Cutty Sark station and under the River Thames to the Isle of Dogs; in the opposite direction, it rises on a concrete viaduct to follow the River Ravensbourne upstream to Deptford Bridge and Lewisham.

On the National Rail network, Greenwich is measured from .

==History==
The National Rail line is one of London&#x27;s oldest – the London and Greenwich Railway is reputed to be the world&#x27;s first suburban railway. It was designed by former army engineer George Landmann, and promoted by entrepreneur George Walter. A massive brick viaduct with 878 arches was built to a station in Spa Road (Bermondsey), and later to London Bridge. The line opened on 8 February 1836 from Deptford, and on 24 December 1838 from a temporary station in Greenwich. Greenwich&#x27;s handsome station building was designed by George Smith and opened in 1840, making it one of the oldest station buildings in the world.

The South Eastern Railway (SER) leased the Greenwich branch from 1 January 1845.

The South Eastern and Chatham Railway was formed on 1 January 1899 and as such took over operation of the station. The SER and London Chatham and Dover Railway formed a &quot;management committee&quot; comprising the directors of both companies and merged the two companies&#x27; operations both of which were on the brink of bankruptcy forced by years of bitter competition.

Up to this point the four tracks through the station (two of which had platforms, two of which did not) terminated at a sector plate which is a traverser that rotates around a pivot that is not at the centre and therefore cannot rotate through 360˚. This saves space and means locomotives can be transferred from one track to another. The original railway company&#x27;s board room was located at that end of the station behind the sector plate. Both of these features were removed when the line was extended towards Maze Hill.

Difficulties in extending the railway over land owned by the Greenwich Hospital led to the station remaining a terminus until the line was extended eastwards via a cut-and-cover tunnel towards Maze Hill, opening on 1 February 1878.

The Southern Railway took over operation of the station following the grouping of 1923.

Up until 1924 there had been two platform tracks and two tracks between them allowing overtaking moves. This facility was removed (&quot;possibly&quot; in preparation from the forthcoming electrification) and the empty space between the two platforms remained until the arrival of the Docklands Light Railway at the station in 1999.

Two years later following electrification works, a limited service worked by Electric Multiple Units commenced on 10 May 1926 with the full service commencing 19 July. The lines were electrified to the 750v DC system.

Following nationalisation, operation of the station passed to the Southern Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948.

The Docklands Light Railway (DLR) was extended to Lewisham via Greenwich on 20 November 1999, the new platforms lying immediately to the south of the main-line station, occupying the space originally used by the up main line platform, which was itself relocated into the space left 75 years earlier by the removal of the through lines. At the eastern end, the DLR heads underground through a tunnel through Cutty Sark and under the River Thames.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 129, 177, 199, 386, and night route N199 serve the station. The Quietway 1 cycle route terminates at the station.

<text>A satin weave is a type of fabric weave that produces a characteristically glossy, smooth or lustrous material, typically with a glossy top surface and a dull back; it is not durable, as it tends to snag. It is one of three fundamental types of textile weaves alongside plain weave and twill weave.

The satin weave is characterised by four or more fill or weft yarns floating over a warp yarn, and four warp yarns floating over a single weft yarn. Floats are missed interfacings, for example where the warp yarn lies on top of the weft in a warp-faced satin. These floats explain the high lustre and even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, light is not scattered as much when hitting the fibres, resulting in a stronger reflection. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are &quot;floated&quot; over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, polyester or nylon, the corresponding fabric is termed a &#x27;satin&#x27;, although some definitions insist that a satin fabric is only made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen.

Many variations can be made of the basic satin weave, including a granite weave and a check weave. 

Satin is commonly used in clothing, for items such as lingerie, nightgowns, blouses, and evening gowns, but is also used for boxer shorts, shirts and neckties. It is also used in the production of pointe shoes for ballet. Other uses include interior furnishing fabrics, upholstery, and bed sheets.

== History ==
=== China ===

Satin was originally made solely of silk, which, for much of history, was produced and found mainly in China. In China, various forms of satin fabrics existed, which came under several names, such as (), (), (), (), () and (). Chinese satin, in its original form, was supposed to be a five- or six-end warp satin. The six-end warp satin weave was mostly likely a derivative of the six-end warp twill weave during the Tang and Northern Song dynasty periods.

=== Europe ===
Silk satin was introduced to Europe during the 12th century. As an imported fabric, it was considerably expensive, and was worn only by the upper classes.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;satin&quot; derives its origin from the Chinese port city of Quanzhou (), which was known as &quot;Zayton&quot; in Europe and Arab countries during the Yuan dynasty (13th–14th century). During that period, Quanzhou was visited by Arab merchants and by Europeans. The Arabs referred to silk satin imported from Quanzhou as . During the latter part of the Middle Ages, Quanzhou was a major shipping port of silk, using the Maritime Silk Road to reach Europe. It was mostly used in the Arab world.

==Types of satin weave==
Satin-weave fabrics are more flexible, with better draping characteristics than plain weaves. In a satin weave, the fill yarn passes over multiple warp yarns before interlacing under one warp yarn. Common satin weaves are:
* 4-harness satin weave (4HS), also called crowfoot satin, in which the fill yarn passes over three warp yarns and under one warp yarn. It is more pliable than a plain weave.
* 5-harness satin weave (5HS); the fill yarn passes over four warp yarns and then under one warp yarn.
* 8-harness satin weave (8HS), in which the fill yarn passes over seven warp yarns and then under one warp yarn, is the most pliable satin weave.

==Types of satin==
* Antique satin – is a type of satin-back shantung, woven with slubbed or unevenly spun weft yarns.
* Baronet or baronette – has a cotton back and a rayon or silk front, similar to georgette.
* Charmeuse – is a lightweight, draping satin-weave fabric with a dull reverse.
* Cuttanee – fine heavy and stout silk and cotton satin
* Double face(d) – satin is woven with a glossy surface on both sides. It is possible for both sides to have a different pattern, albeit using the same colours.
* Duchesse satin – is a particularly luxurious, heavy, stiff satin.
* Faconne – is jacquard woven satin.
* Farmer&#x27;s satin or Venetian cloth – is made from mercerised cotton.
* Gattar – is satin made with a silk warp and a cotton weft.
* Messaline – is lightweight and loosely woven.
* Polysatin or poly-satin – is an abbreviated term for polyester satin.
* Slipper satin – is stiff and medium- to heavy-weight fabric.
* Sultan – is a worsted fabric with a satin face.
* Surf satin – was a 1910s American trademark for a taffeta fabric used for swimsuits.

==Uses for satin==
Because of the different ways the weave is employed, satin has a range of functions from interior décor to fashion.

* Dresses: Satin&#x27;s drape and shiny texture make it a favorite for evening gowns and bridal gowns. Nowadays, many vendors are using it to make Satin Shirts.
* Upholstery: Satin was first used for ornamental furniture in Europe at the Palace of Versailles, and it is still used for pillow covers, chairs, and other forms of cushioned furniture today.
* Bed sheets: Satin is frequently used for bed linens because of its flexible and silky texture.
* Footwear: Satin is a popular fabric for shoe makers, from ballerina slippers to high heels.
* Fashion accessories: Satin is commonly used for evening bags and clutches in the fashion industry.
* Crafting: Satin in the form of ribbons is very common for crafting various products such as rosette leis, corsage, and even decorative flowers.

<text>Antenna, better known as ANT1, is a free-to-air television network airing in Greece. The alternate spelling is wordplay in Greek; &quot;ena&quot; (ένα) is the Greek number &quot;1&quot; (one), thus &quot;ANT1&quot; is pronounced the same as &quot;Antenna&quot; (Αντέννα). It launched on 31 December 1989, and is owned by Antenna Group. ANT1 had been a popular network in Greece for years with its line up of soap series including dramas &quot;Lampsi&quot; and &quot;Kalimera Zoi&quot;. Antenna TV studios are located in the Athens suburb of Marousi.

==History==
The first broadcast of the channel was on 31 December 1989. Programs that were once shown on ANT1 include &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; from the U.S. ANT1 Satellite News was also shown until the late 1990s.

Antenna was founded by Minos Kyriakou and today is led by Theodore Kyriakou. He served as Executive Vice President of the ANT1 Group S.A. (from 1995) and as Chief Operating Officer (from September 1998) until his appointment in March 1999 as Chief Executive Officer, a position which he held until his appointment in January 2002 as Group Vice Chairman. Mr. Kyriakou has been a Director since September 1998.

==ANT1 International channels==
Since 1993, Antenna has broadcast its programming internationally for Greek-speaking audiences abroad. Initially, the broadcast was for a few hours each day but since 2000 has evolved into a full channel that operates twenty-four hours a day. ANT1 currently operates three television channels, via satellite, which vary according to the different geographical targets:

*Antenna Europe for audiences in Europe (outside Greece and Cyprus) which has been operating since 2006.
*Antenna Pacific for audiences in Australia which has been operating since 1997.
*Antenna Satellite for audiences in America which has been operating since 1993.

==ANT1 HD==
ANT1 began broadcasting in high definition (HD) by the evening of March 1, 2016. The program is transmitted as the normal broadcast and at the frequency of simple definition, but the parent (native HD) broadcast only emits what has been shot with this resolution.

==Netwix==
In 2010, Antenna Group had launched on-demand Internet media service Netwix, available to viewers in Greece. It mainly included short YouTube-style comedy videos created by famous Greek comedians. Netwix closed in 2023 due to the high costs of production and the low audience appeal.

==ANT1+==
Since April 2022, Antenna Group has launched its own subscription-based streaming media, which includes some original shows such as &quot;Serres&quot; and &quot;I Gefyra (The Bridge)&quot;, along with many movies and foreign television series.

In July 2022, following the assassination of Shinzo Abe, a news segment on ANT1 TV Greece shared the same images of Hideo Kojima, identifying him as the alleged killer. ANT1 TV Greece took down the video on Friday, but the story caused major controversy as it became viral globally. The mistake first started going viral after French far-right politician Damien Rieu tweeted pictures of Kojima in response to another politician&#x27;s tweet about the assassination. The 4chan post used a photo of Kojima and falsely labelled him as a &quot;left-wing extremist&quot; with a criminal record. In response, Hideo Kojima threatened to sue over false posts, stating that he &quot;strongly condemns the spread of fake news and rumours that convey false information&quot;.

==Slogans==
ANT1 has had various slogans over the years including:

*from 1989 until 1998: &quot;ΑΝΤ1-Νούμερο Ένα&quot; (&quot;ANT1-The Number One&quot;)

<text>In arithmetic, a quotient (from &#x27;how many times&#x27;, pronounced ) is a quantity produced by the division of two numbers. The quotient has widespread use throughout mathematics. It has two definitions: either the integer part of a division (in the case of Euclidean division) or a fraction or ratio (in the case of a general division). For example, when dividing 20 (the &quot;dividend&quot;) by 3 (the &quot;divisor&quot;), the &quot;quotient&quot; is 6 (with a remainder of 2) in the first sense and formula_1 (a repeating decimal) in the second sense.

In metrology (International System of Quantities and the International System of Units), &quot;quotient&quot; refers to the general case with respect to the units of measurement of physical quantities.
&quot;Ratios&quot; is the special case for dimensionless quotients of two quantities of the same kind.
Quotients with a non-trivial dimension and compound units, especially when the divisor is a duration (e.g., &quot;per second&quot;), are known as &quot;rates&quot;.
For example, density (mass divided by volume, in units of kg/m3) is said to be a &quot;quotient&quot;, whereas mass fraction (mass divided by mass, in kg/kg or in percent) is a &quot;ratio&quot;. 
&quot;Specific quantities&quot; are intensive quantities resulting from the quotient of a physical quantity by mass, volume, or other measures of the system &quot;size&quot;.

==Notation==
The quotient is most frequently encountered as two numbers, or two variables, divided by a horizontal line. The words &quot;dividend&quot; and &quot;divisor&quot; refer to each individual part, while the word &quot;quotient&quot; refers to the whole.

formula_2

==Integer part definition==
The quotient is also less commonly defined as the greatest whole number of times a divisor may be subtracted from a dividend—before making the remainder negative. For example, the divisor 3 may be subtracted up to 6 times from the dividend 20, before the remainder becomes negative:
: 20 − 3 − 3 − 3 − 3 − 3 − 3 ≥ 0,
while
: 20 − 3 − 3 − 3 − 3 − 3 − 3 − 3 &lt; 0.
In this sense, a quotient is the integer part of the ratio of two numbers.

==Quotient of two integers==
A rational number can be defined as the quotient of two integers (as long as the denominator is non-zero).

A more detailed definition goes as follows:

: A real number &quot;r&quot; is rational, if and only if it can be expressed as a quotient of two integers with a nonzero denominator. A real number that is not rational is irrational.

Or more formally: 
: Given a real number &quot;r&quot;, &quot;r&quot; is rational if and only if there exists integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; such that formula_3 and formula_4.

The existence of irrational numbers—numbers that are not a quotient of two integers—was first discovered in geometry, in such things as the ratio of the diagonal to the side in a square.

== More general quotients ==
Outside of arithmetic, many branches of mathematics have borrowed the word &quot;quotient&quot; to describe structures built by breaking larger structures into pieces. Given a set with an equivalence relation defined on it, a &quot;quotient set&quot; may be created which contains those equivalence classes as elements. A quotient group may be formed by breaking a group into a number of similar cosets, while a quotient space may be formed in a similar process by breaking a vector space into a number of similar linear subspaces.

<doc id="332647" wikidata="Q41761342" url="?curid=332647" title="White Huns">
<text>The &quot;White Huns&quot;, also known as the White Hunas, in Iranian as the Spet Xyon, and in Sanskrit as the Sveta-huna, were a subgroup of the Huna and/or Xionites. The White Huns are sometimes regarded as synonymous with the Hephthalites but may have included other tribes as well. They are known for their historical conquest and occupation of North India, particularly the Punjab region.

==History==
The &quot;White Huns&quot;, or Hephthalites, were reported by Byzantine, Indian, Chinese, Arab-Persian, Armenian, and other written sources. Despite the abundance of information, a number of questions on the history of the states they formed are considered by scientists from different and often opposite points of view. Well-informed authors of Chinese chronicles call the regions of East Turkestan (Turfan) the homeland of the Hephthalites. According to this information, the Hephthalites were driven out of there as a result of clashes with the neighboring tribes of the Rouran. Hephthalites were divided into two groups: white huns and red huns. The latter owe their name to red headdresses, red armor, and a red banner. It is still unclear whether these groups were different tribes that were part of a confederation, or whether they were ethnic varieties that were part of a single tribal union. The Hephthalites were an Iranian-speaking people. Their language belonged to the East Iranian group but was somewhat different from that of other Iranian-speaking peoples. In the Tocharistan possessions, the official state language of the Hephthalites was Bactrian. Bactrian titles are read in the legends of the Hephthalite coins. Hephthalite writing developed on the basis of the Kushan, though few examples have survived. These include an inscription on a shard from Zangtepe, graffiti from Karzdepe, and inscriptions from Afrasiab.

Latin and Syrian sources called the Chionites, Kidarites (Kushans), and Hephthalites as White Huns. They also included the Cadusii living in Nusaybin. Considering the identity of the Caspians with the Cadusii, the Nusaybin Cadusii, as well as the Chionites and Hephthalites, can be considered the successors of the Hyrcanian Cadusii or Caspians, corresponding to Alans and Sarir or Alans and Rus in Munajim-bashy. Thus, the &quot;Caucasian Huns&quot;, who are not confused with the Huns and are identified with &quot;Maskut&quot;, or &quot;Massa-Huns&quot;, can be correlated with the Hyrcanians, who were related to the military–trade colonies in the Caucasus.

The Hephthalite tribes are noted in Central Asia, mainly in the Trans-Caspian and in the upper reaches of the Amu Darya, by Arab and Persian-speaking authors under the name Haital (Tabari, Masudi, Ferdowsi, etc.) Armenian historians repeatedly mentioned Hephtalites, transcribing their name as Idalyan, Idal, or Haital. Ghazar Parpetsi (end of the 5th century) uses the term Heptal for their designation; Michael of Syria (IX century) uses Tedal and Tedaltzi. Markwart also noted the Armenian term &quot;katisk – Cadusii&quot;, as one of the names of the Hephthalites.

It is necessary to point out that Markwart also associates with the White Huns the many times-remembered Cadiseni—&quot;Katisk&quot; of Armenian sources. These Cadusii, or Cadiseni, occupied the Persian province of Herat. Initially, Markwart doubted whether to consider them Chionites or Hephthalites, but in his work, he classified them as the latter. The Syrian writer Isaac of Antioch, writing about 400 AD, mentioned that the qudishaye is near Nusaybin. Nöldeke considered them to be relatives of the Kurds, with whom, in his opinion, they had many similarities. In the surviving fragments of John of Antioch, there is an indication that the Cadusii were counted among the Huns.

<text>Retro is a 2002 box set of music by the English band New Order. It comprises four themed CDs. In the UK, initial quantities came with a fifth disc which featured tracks with limited release numbers.

==History==
The box set was released as a compromise. The band&#x27;s manager, Rob Gretton, had originally envisioned a box set called &quot;Recycle&quot;, which would feature all the singles New Order had released, one single per CD, in a grand 20 CD box. However, London Records deemed this excessive, and the idea was shelved. New Order released &quot;Get Ready&quot; in 2001 and a year later &quot;Retro&quot; surfaced.

The CDs each have a particular theme: &quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Fan&quot;, &quot;Club&quot; and &quot;Live&quot;. Each one was selected by a friend of the band.
The idea of the limited edition fifth bonus disc was hatched as a direct result of online protestation that the &quot;Recycle&quot; project had been abandoned. Fans of the band saw the &quot;Retro&quot; track listing as a disappointing cash-in exercise as it offered nothing rare or noteworthy, and no tracks that weren&#x27;t already widely available on CD. Dissent voiced on the NewOrderOnline message board caught the eye of the band&#x27;s management who negotiated with HMV to fund the limited run of 3000 discs that were included in initial copies of the box set sold exclusively by their UK stores.

==Track listing==
All songs written by New Order, except where noted.

<doc id="332652" wikidata="Q5533156" url="?curid=332652" title="Geniac">
<text>Geniac was an educational toy sold as a mechanical computer designed and marketed by Edmund Berkeley, with Oliver Garfield from 1955 to 1958, but with Garfield continuing without Berkeley through the 1960s. The name stood for &quot;Genius Almost-automatic Computer&quot; but suggests a portmanteau of genius and ENIAC (the first fully electronic general-purpose computer).

==Construction==

The Geniac kit consisted of a wedge-shaped case, a console panel, and nearly 400 other parts available for assembly. It was powered by a flashlight battery. 

Basically a rotary switch construction set, the Geniac contained six perforated masonite disks, into the back of which brass jumpers could be inserted. The jumpers made electrical connections between slotted brass bolt heads sitting out from the similarly perforated masonite back panel. To the bolts were attached wires behind the panel. The circuit comprised a battery, such wires from it to, and between, switch positions, wires from the switches to indicator flashlight bulbs set along the panel&#x27;s middle, and return wires to the battery to complete the circuit.

Setting up Geniac to solve a new problem or perform a new operation involved rewiring the jumpers on the back panel, a task advertised as taking only a few minutes.

==Operation==

With this basic setup Geniac could use combinational logic only, its outputs depending entirely on inputs manually set. It had no active elements at all – no relays, tubes, or transistors – to allow a machine state to automatically influence subsequent states. Thus, Geniac didn&#x27;t have memory and couldn&#x27;t solve problems using sequential logic. All sequencing was performed manually by the operator, sometimes following fairly complicated printed directions (turn this wheel in this direction if this light lights, etc.)

The main instruction book, as well as a supplementary book of wiring diagrams, gave jumper positions and wiring diagrams for building a number of &quot;machines,&quot; which could realize fairly complicated Boolean equations. A copy of Claude Shannon&#x27;s groundbreaking thesis in the subject, &quot;A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits&quot;, was also included.

==A typical project==

A typical project was a primitive &quot;Masculine–Feminine Testing Machine&quot;. The user was instructed to answer five questions related to gender, such as &quot;Which makes a better toy for a child: (a) electric train? (b) a doll with a complete wardrobe?&quot; Having wired five of the six rotary switches and set them to &quot;off&quot; positions, questions could be asked. For each &quot;a&quot; answer, a switch was turned to one of two &quot;on&quot; positions, setting a circuit segment; for each &quot;b&quot; answer, the other &quot;on&quot; position. The circuitry sensed the cumulative effect of the switch positions, the circuit being completed, and a &quot;more masculine&quot; or &quot;more feminine&quot; bulb lit, once three masculine or three feminine answers were recorded.

==Popularity==

Widely advertised in magazines such as &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, the Geniac provided many youths with their first hands-on introduction to computer concepts and Boolean logic.

==Brainiac==

A nearly identical product, called Brainiac, was introduced in 1958 by Edmund Berkeley, after he had a falling out with Oliver Garfield. The device would influence the portrayal of the Superman villain Brainiac introduced the same year, whose creation was attributed by the editor to a &quot;remarkable coincidence.&quot;

==Helical slide rule==

Oliver Garfield also sold the Otis King&#x27;s Patent Calculator, a helical slide rule, under the Geniac brand. Initially he resold the ones manufactured by Carbic, Ltd., but his later products had no serial numbers so were probably his own version.

<text>Ian Gibson (20 February 1946 – 11 December 2023) was a British comic book artist, best known for his 1980s black-and-white work for &quot;2000 AD&quot;, especially as the main artist on &quot;Robo-Hunter&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Halo Jones&quot;, as well as his long run on &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;.

==Biography==
Gibson&#x27;s imaginative cartoonish, and intricately detailed style (especially in black and white strips) lent itself well to humorous strips, such as &quot;Robo-Hunter&quot;, although his work on the Alan Moore-penned &quot;The Ballad of Halo Jones&quot; showed that he was capable of telling a serious story.

In the United States, Gibson made a good name for himself drawing Mister Miracle for DC Comics in the 1980s. Subsequently he started work on &quot;Meta 4&quot;, a science fiction/superhero comic written by Stefan Petrucha. This series was cut short when publisher First Comics went out of business. He also worked on several Star Wars titles for Dark Horse Comics, and &quot;Green Lantern Corps&quot; for DC Comics.

Gibson&#x27;s later work in the comic &quot;2000AD&quot; consisted of drawing &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, &quot;Anderson, Psi-Division&quot;, &quot;I Was a Teenage Tax Consultant&quot;, and the revived &quot;Robo-Hunter&quot; series starring Sam Slade&#x27;s granddaughter, Samantha. His last published original material for that comic appeared in prog 1576 (March 2008).

In 2023, he finally published the first issue of &quot;Lifeboat&quot;, which he wrote and illustrated himself, through a crowd-funded project.

In the past, he contributed articles and rants to the Den of Geek website about the state of the comics industry.

Gibson died from cancer on 11 December 2023, at the age of 77.

== Controversy ==
In 2013, Gibson offered a selection of his artwork to Bristol Comic Expo. They were to choose a single piece to be made into a limited edition print of only 50 copies, which were intended to raise money for charity. In the collection was a topless illustration of a character that bore a resemblance to feminist character Halo Jones, one of Gibson&#x27;s more notable characters. Gibson says it was drawn &quot;as a joke for a friend&quot; and that he only named the piece after Halo Jones to give it some appeal to potential buyers, saying &quot;it doesn&#x27;t even really look very much like Halo&quot; and &quot;I just called it &#x27;topless Halo&#x27; as otherwise it was just a nameless pinup&quot;. The print in question shows the character that is meant to be Halo Jones topless with the moonlight shining down on her posing next to a single tree in the background. It was reported by &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the Expo website described the piece as &quot;a special, very limited run of Halo in all her &#x27;glory&#x27;!&quot;, for &quot;the discerning adult. This is an opportunity not to be missed!&quot;

It was reported by &quot;The Guardian&quot; to have &quot;provoked a wave of protests&quot;, with complaints from comic fans and industry professionals. Rebellion Developments Ltd. The publisher of the &quot;2000AD&quot; comic series, was said to have expressed concerns about the portrayal of their intellectual property, Halo Jones. The image was taken down from the Expo&#x27;s website soon after.

Gibson said he found it &quot;ironic that Halo would be known as a &#x27;feminist&#x27; character&quot;, and that he had been &quot;attacked in the past for &#x27;using&#x27; her and thus all women for my own nefarious ends&quot;, and how the bare-breasted image of the female heroine was keeping in line with &quot;the ideas I had for any continuation of the saga&quot;. He went on to say &quot;I had plans for her being pregnant – hence the bigger boobs. Also as a slave, hence the token chains and nakedness.&quot; Gibson described the controversy as &quot;a storm in a D-cup&quot;, a pun based on the idiom &quot;storm in a teacup&quot; and referring to a woman&#x27;s bra size.

<text>Daniel James Heatley (born January 21, 1981) is a German-born Canadian former professional ice hockey winger. Originally drafted by the Atlanta Thrashers second overall in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, he won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the National Hockey League (NHL) rookie of the year in 2002. However, Heatley&#x27;s time with the Thrashers was derailed when he was at the wheel in a car crash in September 2003 that killed teammate Dan Snyder. Heatley, who was also seriously injured but eventually made a full recovery, pled guilty to second-degree vehicular homicide and received probation.

Traded to the Ottawa Senators, Heatley became one of the team&#x27;s leading scorers, setting franchise records for single-season goals (50) in 2005–06, and points (105) in 2006–07. He played on the left wing with linemates Jason Spezza and Daniel Alfredsson. The line was consistently among the highest scoring in the NHL after its formation in 2005–06, with the trio combining for 296 points that season.

Heatley represented Team Canada in six World Championships, two Olympics, and one World Cup of Hockey, as well as two World Junior Championships. In 2008, he surpassed Marcel Dionne as Canada&#x27;s all-time leader in goals and Steve Yzerman as the all-time leader in points for the World Championships.

Heatley later played for the San Jose Sharks, Minnesota Wild and the Anaheim Ducks of the NHL, and last played with the Thomas Sabo Ice Tigers of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in 2015–16.

==Early life==
Heatley was born in Freiburg to Karin and Murray Heatley, where his father played professional hockey. When Murray retired from hockey, the family settled in Calgary, Alberta.

==Playing career==
===Amateur===
Playing minor hockey in the Alberta Midget Hockey League (AMHL) for the Calgary Buffaloes, Heatley tallied 91 points in 36 games in 1997–98 to earn the Harry Allen Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s top scorer. He went on to lead the Buffaloes to the bronze medal at the 1998 Air Canada Cup, where he finished as both Top Scorer and Tournament MVP.

As Heatley intended to play college hockey in the United States, he joined the Junior A ranks in 1998–99 with the Calgary Canucks of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) to maintain his NCAA eligibility (as opposed to playing major junior). Recording 70 goals and 126 points in 60 games, he was named AJHL and Canadian Junior A Player of the Year.

The following season, he began his two-year tenure with the University of Wisconsin Badgers of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). As a freshman, he was named to the WCHA first All-Star team and NCAA West Second All-American Team, in addition to earning WCHA Rookie of the Year honours. In the off-season, he was drafted second overall by the Atlanta Thrashers in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, behind goaltender Rick DiPietro. After his sophomore year, in which he was named to the 2001 WCHA Second All-Star and NCAA West First All-American Teams, Heatley chose to forgo his final two years of college eligibility to turn pro with the Thrashers.

===Professional===
====Atlanta Thrashers (2001–2005)====
Heatley made his NHL debut with the Thrashers in 2001–02, leading all rookies in points (67) and assists (41) and was second in team goal-scoring (26) behind Ilya Kovalchuk. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s Rookie of the Year, for which Kovalchuk was also nominated.

In the 2002–03 season Heatley emerged as an NHL star, recording 41 goals and 89 points in 77 games and finishing ninth overall in league scoring.

As a result of a car crash in September 2003 that seriously injured Heatley and claimed the life of Thrashers&#x27; teammate Dan Snyder, Heatley&#x27;s season did not start until January 2004 and he ultimately appeared in only 31 games. A difficult season ended with Heatley recording only 25 points as the Thrashers failed to earn a playoff spot.

During the 2004–05 NHL lock-out, Heatley initially played for the Swiss team SC Bern. He scored 24 points in only 16 games before an errant puck struck his left eye and broke his orbital bone. As a result of this injury, the pupil of his left eye became permanently dilated. He finished the year with Thrashers&#x27; teammate Kovalchuk on the Ak Bars Kazan of the Russian Superleague (RSL), recording 4 points in eleven games.

====Ottawa Senators (2005–2009)====
Prior to the end of the lock-out, Heatley asked to be traded from Atlanta in hopes of leaving reminders of the tragic crash behind. This was unpopular with Atlanta fans, particularly as Snyder&#x27;s father Graham noted that Heatley owed much to the Thrashers&#x27; organization that had particularly been extremely supportive of him during his trial and ordeal. On August 23, 2005, the Thrashers sent him to the Ottawa Senators for Slovak star Marián Hossa and veteran defenceman Greg de Vries. Hossa had just re-signed with the Senators after protracted and often contentious negotiations. A restricted free agent at the time of the trade, Heatley immediately signed a three-year, $13.5 million contract with the Senators.

In his first game for the Senators, against the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 5, 2005, Heatley played with Jason Spezza and Brandon Bochenski, but when the Senators were down with five minutes to go, Daniel Alfredsson, who replaced Bochenski, scored the tying goal. As 2005–06 was the first year that the NHL implemented the shootout, Heatley became the second player to score in an NHL shootout, scoring against Leafs goalie Ed Belfour, after Alfredsson. Their sticks are now in the Hockey Hall of Fame. Later that month, on October 29, Heatley scored four consecutive goals in an 8–0 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs, marking a career high for goals in a game.

Heatley made a spectacular start with his new team, registering points in the first 22 games of the 2005–06 season, breaking Marián Hossa&#x27;s previous franchise record of 13 consecutive games. Among players with new teams, this was behind only Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 23-game streak upon joining the Los Angeles Kings during the 1988–89 season.
In his first game back in Atlanta as a Senator, he was frequently booed, indicating that Thrashers fans felt snubbed by Heatley&#x27;s previous trade request. Despite scoring, Heatley and the Senators suffered an 8–3 defeat to his former Thrashers teammates.

Heatley finished the 2005–06 season with 50 goals and 103 points, fourth in the league. Incidentally, Heatley&#x27;s first 50-goal season also marked the first time any Senators player had achieved that mark, setting a franchise record for goals in a season (previously held by Marián Hossa, who scored 45 goals in 2002–03). Heatley&#x27;s 103 points also tied Daniel Alfredsson for the team lead, together surpassing Alexei Yashin&#x27;s franchise record of 94 points in a season (achieved in 1998–99).

Catalyzed by a rejuvenated offence, Ottawa finished the season with the best record in the Eastern Conference and the second-best in the league. With lofty expectations for the playoffs, they were eliminated in the second round by the Buffalo Sabres. Heatley recorded 12 points in 10 games. At the end of the season, Heatley was selected, along with Alfredsson, to the second All-Star team.

After a slow start to the 2006–07 season, Heatley recorded 50 in ‘07, once more (second in the league to Vincent Lecavalier&#x27;s 52 goals) and 105 points (fourth in the league). By reaching the 50-goal plateau for the second straight season, he became the first NHL player to do so since Pavel Bure in 1999–2000. Heatley&#x27;s 105 points broke the previous franchise record he shared with Alfredsson. His performance earned him a spot on the first All-Star team.

Heatley and the Senators followed up another strong regular season going all the way to the Stanley Cup finals, but finished short in five games against the Anaheim Ducks. The Alfredsson, Spezza and Heatley line was dominant, leading the NHL in playoffs points, all tied at 22.

Fresh off the heels of a Stanley Cup finals appearance, Heatley began the 2007–08 season with a new six-year contract extension with the Senators worth $45 million, signed prior to the season opener against the Maple Leafs. Since arriving in Ottawa from the Marián Hossa trade, Heatley had appeared in 208 consecutive Senators games, until suffering a separated shoulder on January 12, 2008, in a collision with Detroit Red Wings forward Dallas Drake, sidelining him for 11 games. He completed the 2007–08 season with 41 goals and 41 assists for 82 points in 71 games. Ottawa was plagued with injuries to its superstars all season. Seeding seventh overall in the East, Ottawa met the Pittsburgh Penguins in the playoffs, coincidentally the same first-round match-up of the previous year. However, Heatley and the Senators would not make a second run for the Cup and were swept in four games. Heatley managed just one point.

On October 3, 2008, Heatley was named alternate captain to Daniel Alfredsson, along with defenceman Chris Phillips. The 2008–09 season, however, was met with decreased production for Heatley and the top line as well as an 11th-place finish for the Senators in the Eastern Conference, well out of playoff contention.

=====Trade request=====
Coming off his lowest points total since his rookie season (excluding his shortened 31-game season in 2003–04), TSN reported that Heatley had filed a request for a trade on June 9, 2009, despite being only one year into a six-year contract extension signed in 2007. Heatley had reportedly become unhappy with his role with the Senators under new head coach Cory Clouston. Despite his declining offensive numbers, Heatley felt that his decreased ice time and his move from the first power-play line to the second power-play line were unfair to him. Prior to the trade request, these concerns had been brought to the attention of management during the Senators&#x27; year-end meetings.

In an interview with reporters after the request had been made public, Senators&#x27; then-General Manager Bryan Murray stated that he was &quot;shocked and disappointed&quot; at Heatley&#x27;s request. In addition, Murray said that head coach Clouston was hurt by Heatley&#x27;s remarks. &quot;The frustrating part for us is we have gone through several coaches here that we couldn&#x27;t win enough games with,&quot; Murray stated. &quot;We brought in a guy the results we were very happy with. The team started to look like a real team again. And then to be kind of blindsided, in his way of thinking anyway, by one of your players – not wanting to fit in. That&#x27;s hard for a coach to accept.&quot;

Senators&#x27; fans were blindsided by the request, and across the league observers were both puzzled and angry. Sports writers across Canada criticized Heatley&#x27;s behaviour, calling him a &quot;brat&quot;, &quot;pathetic&quot;, and &quot;reprehensible&quot;. &quot;I was surprised at it, but I understood it&quot;, Atlanta Thrashers&#x27; GM Don Waddell said of Heatley&#x27;s desire to leave Atlanta in the aftermath of Dan Snyder&#x27;s death. &quot;This one, I really don&#x27;t understand. He asked to get out (of Atlanta) and he went to a team that he obviously approved of and had some success. They went to the (2007 Stanley Cup) finals. What I can see is that he got a lot of support in Ottawa. I don&#x27;t think (the trade request) says a lot of positive things on the surface... It sure doesn&#x27;t show a good team attitude.&quot; An Atlanta Thrashers&#x27; employee cryptically told the Vancouver Sun &quot;We know Dany very well. There is always a reason why these things happen.&quot; Graham Snyder, the father of Dan Snyder who played a significant role in helping Heatley avoid prison time after the crash that killed his son, was confused by Heatley&#x27;s decision to force a trade from Ottawa, saying &quot;I&#x27;m surprised because he signed a long-term deal (with Ottawa) and was playing in a market that seemed to embrace him.&quot; Snyder said there were &quot;a lot of ways&quot; Heatley could have dealt with the decision by Clouston to reduce his playing time and bump him down to the second power-play unit, rather than demanding a trade. &quot;Certainly, (talking with Clouston) behind the scenes would be a lot more effective, and trying to work through it.&quot;

Tom Molloy, a close friend of the Heatley family, stoked the fires in Ottawa with a letter published in the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; criticizing the widespread negative reaction to the trade request. &quot;(Heatley&#x27;s) mother is very upset. And the attacks are all personal stuff, about his character&quot;, Molloy lamented, adding that &quot;Nobody mentions that this is a guy who gives up a month of his summer every year to play for Team Canada.&quot; Molloy went as far as to blame the Senators&#x27; organization for Heatley&#x27;s decision, claiming &quot;This is an organizational thing. If I was the owner of the Senators, I&#x27;d be calling my manager in and saying &#x27;why don&#x27;t guys want to play here anymore?&#x27;&quot;

Trading Heatley was a challenge due to his large contract, a contract that was to pay him approximately $7.6 million for the upcoming 2009–10 season, and few other NHL teams possessed the available salary cap space to accommodate it. Further complicating matters was the partial no-trade clause in Heatley&#x27;s contract which limited the number of teams Ottawa could negotiate a potential deal with. A trade was worked out to send Heatley to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Andrew Cogliano, Dustin Penner and Ladislav Šmíd on June 30, 2009, but Heatley again surprised the hockey world when he refused to waive the no-trade clause which would have finalized the deal, further angering fans in both Ottawa and Edmonton. NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly suggested that the Senators may have grounds to file a grievance, as Heatley&#x27;s contract stipulated the team pay a bonus (due July 1, 2009) of US$4 million, as the Edmonton trade if completed would have spared the Senators that expense. Melnyk later filed a lawsuit against Heatley as the team &quot;shouldn’t have paid a hefty roster bonus to a player who was seeking a trade&quot;, which was settled out of court in the fall of 2013 without the terms being publicized.

As Ottawa GM Murray began again to try to accommodate the trade demand, Heatley was still a member of the Senators as the team opened training camp on September 12, 2009. Heatley had little choice but to report for training camp, and the atmosphere between him and his Senators&#x27; teammates was described as &quot;awkward&quot;, &quot;tense&quot;, and &quot;untenable&quot;. Team captain Alfredsson admitted days earlier that a scenario in which Heatley showed up in Ottawa as an unhappy camper would create a massive media headache for the rest of the team. &quot;If he comes back there&#x27;s going to be a lot of focus and attention,&quot; Alfredsson said at the time, adding &quot;If somebody hits him in practice or something occurs, everything is going to get blown out proportion.&quot; Heatley himself sneaked back into Scotiabank Place, avoiding the cameras and throng of media awaiting some clarification regarding his desire to leave Ottawa. &quot;When I looked (Heatley) in the eye, I knew the minute he walked out the door that I had to trade him,&quot; GM Bryan Murray said a short time later. &quot;I didn’t think there was any chance. I just felt that we had to move him.&quot;

====San Jose Sharks (2009–2011)====
On September 12, 2009, Heatley was traded to the San Jose Sharks, along with a fifth-round pick in 2010, for Milan Michálek, Jonathan Cheechoo and a second-round pick in 2010. Heatley made $8 million that year. In the Sharks&#x27; fourth game of the season, their home opener against the Columbus Blue Jackets and Heatley&#x27;s first game in front of the San Jose fans, Heatley capped a hat-trick with a penalty shot goal in the third period, bringing his season totals to four goals and five assists (nine points) in the first four games of the season. On November 20, Heatley recorded his second hat-trick in as many months, as he scored three times from passes from teammate Joe Thornton in a 6–3 win against the Philadelphia Flyers. The Sharks were eliminated in the 2010 Conference Finals as, with Dany Heatley in the penalty box, the Chicago Blackhawks scored the game-winning goal, sweeping the series. However, Head Coach Todd McLellan revealed that Heatley had been playing the entire playoffs with a torn groin muscle.

On December 2, 2010, in his first return to Ottawa, Heatley was frequently booed. Though he had said that the city of Ottawa and the fans there had nothing to do with his desire to be moved, Senators fans were in no mood to forgive. Several fans who attended the game held up their #15 Heatley jerseys with certain letters covered up, so the name plate would spell out the word &quot;H-A-T-E&quot;. Late in the game, a group of 10 fans came down to ice level and simultaneously threw their Heatley jerseys onto the ice in a coordinated protest. Another fan held up a sign reading &quot;Even Yashin Thinks You’re A Jerk&quot;, a reference to former Senators&#x27; player Alexei Yashin who left the team amid controversy in 2001. The Sharks won the game 4–0, and Heatley had an assist. In the following season, Heatley put up the worst full-season point totals of his career, registering only 26 goals and 64 points in 80 games. After the season had concluded, it was revealed that Heatley had been battling multiple injuries during the season, and especially during the playoffs.

====Minnesota Wild (2011–2014)====
On July 3, 2011, Heatley was traded to the Minnesota Wild for Martin Havlát, his former teammate with Ottawa. There he joined former teammate Devin Setoguchi who had also been traded by the Sharks to the Wild on June 24, ten days before him. While producing a solid season, scoring 53 points, the Wild ultimately failed to reach the playoffs despite a hot start to the year. On February 9, 2012, Heatley recorded the fastest goal in Wild history, scoring 13 seconds into a game against the Vancouver Canucks.

In the lock-out-shortened 2012–13 season, Heatley recorded 11 goals and 10 assists in 36 games with Minnesota. However, during a game against the San Jose Sharks in April, an altercation with former teammate Marc-Édouard Vlasic dislocated Heatley&#x27;s left shoulder, requiring surgery that ended his season.

The 2013–14 season saw Heatley&#x27;s production decline dramatically, as he recorded only nine goals and 19 points in his first 55 games. Approaching unrestricted free agency, speculation began that his NHL career might be over and that he might move to Europe to continue his hockey career. Though he showed glimpses of his former abilities (registering seven points in one ten-game stretch) by the 74-game mark of the season, he had recorded only 27 points. On March 29, 2014, Heatley was a healthy scratch for the first time in his career after being demoted to the fourth line for several games.

====Anaheim Ducks and Florida Panthers (2014–2015)====
On July 9, 2014, Heatley signed a one-year deal as a free agent with Anaheim Ducks worth $1 million. He was a healthy scratch after four games with no points. On December 11, 2014, Heatley was assigned to the Ducks&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals. On December 29, 2014, he was placed on waivers. On February 28, 2015, Heatley was traded to the Florida Panthers along with a 2016 third-round draft choice for Tomáš Fleischmann. He finished his tenure with the Ducks with no points in 6 games, but recorded 7 in 25 games with Norfolk. Heatley did not play a single game with the Panthers, as he reported to the team&#x27;s farm affiliate, 
the San Antonio Rampage.

====Europe====
Heatley signed with German club, the Thomas Sabo Ice Tigers of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) on September 17, 2015. He reached the DEL playoff-semifinals with the Ice Tigers, where they fell short to the Grizzlys Wolfsburg. Heatley played a total of 59 games in the 2015–16 season, tallying 19 goals (including the Ice Tigers&#x27; final goal of the season) and 18 assists.

====All-Star Games====
Heatley has been voted into the NHL All-Star Game five times, and played in four of them, most recently in 2009. His first appearance in the All-Star Game was in 2003, where he scored four goals, tying a single-game All-Star record (held by four other players, including Wayne Gretzky). The game went to a shootout where Heatley scored the only goal for the Eastern Conference in a 6–5 loss. The shootout goal did not, however, count towards his regulation total of four, leaving him tied for the record. Heatley also added an assist for a game-high five points and was named the All-Star Game MVP. In response to Heatley&#x27;s impressive performance in just his second NHL season, Eastern Conference teammate Jeremy Roenick commented, &quot;Twenty-two years old? You&#x27;re not supposed to be able to pull moves like that at 22. My goodness.&quot;

Heatley&#x27;s next appearance came in 2007, where he played on a line with former SC Bern teammates Daniel Brière and Marián Hossa and got a goal and two assists in a 12–9 loss to the Western Conference. Heatley was selected for the 2008 game, but had to withdraw due to a shoulder injury he suffered in an earlier game against the Detroit Red Wings. Heatley was selected to his fourth All-Star Game in 2009 and scored a goal in a 12–11 Eastern Conference win in a shootout.

==International play==






Heatley competed in two World Junior Championships during his two-year career at the University of Wisconsin. His first, in 2000, ended with a bronze medal win against the US in a shootout; Heatley scored a goal in the 4–3 victory. The next year, in 2001, Heatley scored three goals and five points as Canada won a second-straight bronze.

Heatley made his senior international debut with Team Canada at the 2002 World Championships, after his rookie season with Atlanta Thrashers. He scored four points as Canada was defeated in the quarter-finals by Slovakia. The following year, Heatley led Team Canada in scoring (seven goals and ten points) at the 2003 World Championships in Finland, en route to his first gold medal.

Having missed the playoffs once more with the Thrashers, Heatley participated in the 2004 World Championships in the Czech Republic. Heatley dominated with 11 points to lead all tournament scorers, earning his second-straight MVP award. Canada captured a second-straight gold medal, defeating Sweden 5–3 in the final. Heatley scored his eighth goal of the tournament in the third period, starting a rally from a 3–1 deficit. Several months later, Heatley competed in the 2004 World Cup and contributed two assists as Canada defeated Finland in the final to capture the second-ever World Cup championship.

At the 2005 World Championships in Austria, his fourth-straight World Championships, Heatley did not achieve the same success, with seven points in nine games, as Canada was shut-out by the Czech Republic in the gold medal game.

On December 21, 2005, Heatley was chosen by Team Canada to participate in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin – his first Olympic games. Heatley managed three points in six games as Canada, defending its 2002 gold medal, was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Russia.

As Heatley returned to the World Championships after a three-year absence in 2008 – he was added to the roster with teammate Jason Spezza after the Ottawa Senators were eliminated from the playoffs – he became Team Canada&#x27;s all-time goal-scorer and then all-time point leader for the World Championships, passing Marcel Dionne and Steve Yzerman, accordingly. Heatley finished the tournament with a staggering 12 goals and eight assists in nine games, however, Canada was defeated by Russia in overtime of the gold medal game. Heatley was given MVP, Best Forward and All-Star team honours.

In the summer of 2009, Heatley was invited to Team Canada&#x27;s Olympic tryout camp in Calgary, where he was booed on the ice by fans. On December 30, 2009, Heatley was selected to play for Team Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics.
 Heatley helped lead Team Canada to an 8–0 win in the first game of the 2010 Olympic tournament by scoring two goals. On February 28, 2010, the team defeated the United States to win Canada&#x27;s eighth gold medal in Olympic men&#x27;s hockey.

== Post-playing career ==
Heatley was hired by the Philadelphia Flyers as a pro scout prior to the 2023-24 season.

==Personal life==
===Citizenship===
Heatley holds dual Canadian-German citizenship because his mother is German.

===Car crash===
On September 29, 2003, Heatley was seriously injured in a car crash after he lost control of the Ferrari 360 Modena he was driving on a curved road in a residential area of Atlanta. The car struck a wall, splitting in half and ejecting Heatley and his passenger, Atlanta Thrashers&#x27; teammate Dan Snyder. Heatley suffered a broken jaw, a concussion, a bruised lung and a bruised kidney, and he tore three ligaments in his right knee. Snyder was critically injured with a skull fracture and died in the hospital of sepsis on October 5, 2003. Heatley pleaded guilty to second-degree vehicular homicide, driving too fast for conditions, failure to maintain a lane and speeding. He admitted to consuming alcohol prior to the crash, but his blood-alcohol content tested below the legal limit. He was sentenced to three years probation and the judge ruled that any vehicle driven by Heatley could not have more than six cylinders nor surpass 70 mph (112 km/h). Heatley avoided having to go to trial as part of a plea deal that dropped the first-degree charge of vehicular homicide. The Thrashers and the Atlanta community were largely supportive of Heatley, and Snyder&#x27;s family told the judge and prosecutors that nothing would be gained by imprisoning him.

===Lawsuit against agent===
In August 2012, it was revealed that Heatley had filed an $11 million lawsuit against his longtime agent and business adviser Stacey McAlpine, McAlpine&#x27;s parents Gerald and Eugenia, and several companies. The suit, filed in the Calgary Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Alberta, alleges that the defendants lured Heatley into several real estate ventures across Canada and the United States with promises of huge returns that never materialized. It is also alleged that Stacey McAlpine made unauthorized withdrawals of more than $4 million from Heatley&#x27;s bank accounts. The defendant companies named in court documents are Presidential Suites Inc., Waterfront Development Inc., McAlpine Sports Management Inc., and NSEM Management Inc.

One month later, it was revealed that Heatley&#x27;s former Senators teammate Chris Phillips was also initiating a $7.5 million suit against Stacey McAlpine to recover lost money as a result of bad real estate deals. The suit, launched at the Ontario court in Ottawa, alleges Phillips felt he was misled by McAlpine and has not been able to recover monies invested.

After a lengthy court process, Heatley was awarded $6.5 million from a judge in Calgary, Alberta on July 21, 2017. McAlpine was later arrested and charged with fraud, money laundering and theft by authorities in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on October 18, 2017. McAlpine died on March 5, 2018, at the age of 54, and the charges of fraud, theft and laundering the proceeds of crime were stayed two days later.

===Endorsements===
Heatley was selected as the cover player for the 2004 installment of the EA Sports NHL video game franchise in 2003 (NHL 2004). However, due to the fallout from Heatley&#x27;s crash shortly afterwards, EA switched the cover photo to Joe Sakic, although many copies of the game were shipped with his photo on them.

<text>A shopping center in American English, shopping centre in Commonwealth English (see spelling differences), shopping complex, shopping arcade, shopping plaza, or galleria, is a group of shops built together, sometimes under one roof.

The first known collections of retailers under one roof are public markets, dating back to ancient times, and Middle Eastern covered markets, bazaars and souqs. In Paris, about 150 covered passages were built between the late 18th century and 1850, and a wealth of shopping arcades were built across Europe in the 19th century. In the United States, the widespread use of the automobile in the 1920s led to the first shopping centers of a few dozen shops that included parking for cars. Starting in 1946, larger, open air centers anchored by department stores were built (sometimes as a collection of adjacent retail properties with different owners), then enclosed shopping malls starting with Victor Gruen&#x27;s Southdale Center near Minneapolis in 1956.

A shopping mall is a type of shopping center, a North American term originally meaning a pedestrian promenade with shops along it, but in the late 1960s began to be used as a generic term for large shopping centers anchored by department stores, especially enclosed centers. Many malls in the United States are currently in severe decline (&quot;dead malls&quot;) or have closed. Successful exceptions have added entertainment and experiential features, added big-box stores as anchor tenants, or are specialized formats: power centers, lifestyle centers, factory outlet centers, and festival marketplaces. Smaller types of shopping centers in North America include neighborhood shopping centers, and even smaller, strip malls. Pedestrian malls (shopping streets) in the United States have been less common and less successful than in Europe. In Canada, underground passages in Montreal and Toronto link large adjacent downtown retail spaces.

In Europe shopping malls/centers continue to grow and thrive. In the region distinction is made between shopping centers (shops under one roof), shopping precincts (pedestrianized zones of a town or city where many retail stores are located), the High Street (street – pedestrianized or not – with a high concentration of retail shops), and retail parks (usually out of the city centre, 5000 sq.m. or larger and anchored by big-box stores or supermarkets, rather than department stores).

==Types==
Most English-speakers follow a mix of the United Kingdom&#x27;s and United States&#x27;s naming conventions.

In the U.K. a &quot;centre for shopping&quot; is commonly the centre for a settlement. More recent shopping dedicated areas outside the main centre are known as &quot;shopping centres&quot; (with understanding of the synonym shopping mall) &quot;shopping villages&quot; or &quot;retail parks&quot;.

According to author Richard Longstreth, before the 1920s–1930s, the term &quot;shopping center&quot; in the U.S. was loosely applied to any group of adjacent retail businesses. A city&#x27;s downtown might be called a &quot;shopping center&quot;. By the 1940s, the term &quot;shopping center&quot; implied — if not always a single owner — at least, a place sharing comprehensive design planning, including layout, signs, exterior lighting, and parking; and shared business planning that covered the target market, types of stores and store mix.

The International Council of Shopping Centers classifies Asia-Pacific, European, U.S., and Canadian shopping centers into the following types:


===General-purpose===
====Multiregional====
A superregional-scale center is commonly called a city centre. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers it is over of gross leasable area. These have three or more anchors, mass and varied merchant trade and serves as the dominant venue for the region () in which it is located.

Note that ICSC defines indoor centers above net leasable area in Asia-Pacific as mega-malls.

====Regional====

A regional-scale shopping centre (commonly known as a town centre) is typically larger with to gross leasable area with at least two anchor stores and offers a wider selection of stores. Given their wider service area, these tend to have higher-end stores (department stores) that need a larger area in order for their services to be profitable. Regional centres have tourist attractions, education and hospitality areas.

Indoor centres are commonly called Shopping Malls in the U.S. or Shopping Centres in Commonwealth English.

====Community====

Community-scale shopping centres are commonly called Main Streets, High Streets or town squares in wider centres or in English-speaking Europe as retail parks for certain centres. These offer a wider range of goods and has two anchor supermarkets or discount department stores. They may also follow a parallel configuration, or may be L- or U-shaped. Community centers usually feature a retail area of and serve a primary area of .

====Local====
Local-scale shopping centres usually have a retail area of , and serve a primary area in a radius. They typically have a supermarket as an anchor or a large convenience shop and commonly serve large villages or as secondary centres to towns.

Car-dependent centres in the U.K. and Europe, if larger than can be termed a small retail park, while in the U.S. and some other countries it is known as a neighborhood shopping center.

====Convenience====
Convenience-scale centers, independent of other centers are known as strip malls or as shopping parades. These centers are less than of gross leasable space and commonly serve villages or as parts of larger centers commonly called small squares, plazas or indoor markets. They are also called strip centers or convenience centers. Strip Malls, despite the name, are not considered &quot;malls&quot; in North America.

===Sector-focused===
====Power centers and retail parks====

Power centers, in North America, are open-air single-level shopping centers that almost exclusively feature several big-box retailers as their anchors (although newer urban power centers have adopted enclosed and/or vertical formats while retaining the strong big-box emphasis). They usually have a retail area of and a primary trade area of .

A retail park, in the United Kingdom and Europe, is a type of shopping centre found on the fringes of most large towns and cities in the United Kingdom, and some (but not all) other European countries. In Europe, any shopping center with mostly &quot;retail warehouse units&quot; (UK terminology; in the US the term is &quot;big-box stores&quot;/superstores), or larger is a retail park, according to the leading real estate company Cushman &amp; Wakefield. This would be considered in North America either a power center or a neighborhood shopping center, depending on the size.

====Lifestyle center====
A lifestyle center (American English), or lifestyle centre (Commonwealth English), is a shopping center or mixed-used commercial development that combines the traditional retail functions of a shopping mall with leisure amenities oriented towards upscale consumers.

====Theme/festival center====
Theme or festival centers have distinct unifying themes that are followed by their individual shops as well as their architecture. They are usually located in urban areas and cater to tourists. They typically feature a retail area of .

====Outlet centre====

An outlet centre (or outlet mall in North America) is a type of shopping centre in which manufacturers sell their products directly to the public through their own stores. Other stores in outlet centres are operated by retailers selling returned goods and discontinued products, often at heavily reduced prices. Outlet stores were found as early as 1936, but the first multi-store outlet centre, Vanity Fair, located in Reading, Pennsylvania, did not open until 1974. Belz Enterprises opened the first enclosed factory outlet center in 1979, in Lakeland, Tennessee, a suburb of Memphis.

====Shopping precinct / Pedestrian mall====
A shopping precinct (U.K. term) or pedestrian mall (U.S. term) is an area of city centre streets which have been pedestrianized, where there is a concentration of &quot;high street shops&quot; such as department stores, clothing and home furnishings stores, and so forth. They may be part of a larger city-centre pedestrian zone, as is Strøget in Copenhagen, Denmark. In the U.S. chiefly in the 1960s, some cities converted a main shopping street (usually several blocks of one street only) to pedestrian zones known at the time as shopping malls (i.e. the original meaning of &quot;mall&quot;: a &quot;promenade&quot;), but now referred to as pedestrian malls.

====Shopping arcade====

A shopping arcade is a type of shopping precinct that developed earlier and in which the connecting walkways are not owned by a single proprietor and may be in the open air or covered by a ground-floor loggia. Many early shopping arcades such as the Burlington Arcade in London, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, and numerous arcades in Paris are famous and still functioning as shopping centres, while many others have been demolished.

In Russia, centuries-old shopping centres the size of regional malls still operate, consisting of multiple arcades. They developed from previous so-called &quot;trading rows&quot;, which were essentially markets where traders could obtain space to sell their goods. Great Gostiny Dvor in Saint Petersburg in its present buildings dates back to the 1760s. With a total area of , GUM in Moscow, opened in its present buildings in the 1890s.

====In historical buildings====

Historic and/or monumental buildings are sometimes converted into shopping centers, often forming part of a larger city center shopping district that otherwise consists mostly of on-street stores. Examples are the former main post office of Amsterdam, now Magna Plaza; the in Antwerp, Belgium, a former exhibition &quot;palace&quot;; the former Sears warehouse, now Ponce City Market in Atlanta; the former Emporium-Capwell department store in San Francisco, now San Francisco Centre; Georgetown Park in Washington, D.C., and the Abasto de Buenos Aires, formerly the city&#x27;s wholesale produce market.

==History==

Shopping centers are not a recent innovation. One of the earliest examples of public shopping areas comes from ancient Rome, in forums where shopping markets were located. One of the earliest public shopping centers is Trajan&#x27;s Market in Rome located in Trajan&#x27;s Forum. Trajan&#x27;s Market was probably built around 100–110 AD by Apollodorus of Damascus, and it is thought to be the world&#x27;s oldest shopping center. The Grand Bazaar of Istanbul was built in the 15th century and is still one of the largest covered shopping centers in the world, with more than 58 streets and 4,000 shops. Numerous other covered shopping arcades, such as the 19th-century Al-Hamidiyah Souq in Damascus, Syria, might also be considered as precursors to the present-day large shopping centers. Isfahan&#x27;s Grand Bazaar, which is largely covered, dates from the 10th century. The 10-kilometer-long, covered Tehran&#x27;s Grand Bazaar also has a lengthy history. The oldest continuously occupied shopping mall in the world is likely to be the Chester Rows. Dating back at least to the 13th century, these covered walkways housed shops, with storage and accommodation for traders on various levels. Different rows specialized in different goods, such as &#x27;Bakers Row&#x27; or &#x27;Fleshmongers Row&#x27;.

Gostiny Dvor in St. Petersburg, which opened in 1785, may be regarded as one of the first purposely-built mall-type shopping complexes, as it consisted of more than 100 shops covering an area of over .

The Marché des Enfants Rouges in Paris opened in 1628 and still runs today. The Oxford Covered Market in Oxford, England opened in 1774 and still runs today.

The Passage du Caire was opened in Paris in 1798. The Burlington Arcade in London was opened in 1819.
The Arcade in Providence, Rhode Island introduced the retail arcade concept to the United States in 1828 and is arguably the oldest &quot;shopping center&quot; in the country. The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, Italy followed in the 1870s and is closer to large modern malls in spaciousness. Other large cities created arcades and shopping centers in the late 19th century and early 20th century, including the Cleveland Arcade, and Moscow&#x27;s GUM, which opened in 1890. When the Cleveland Arcade opened in 1890, it was among the first indoor shopping arcades in the US, and like its European counterparts, was an architectural triumph. Two sides of the arcade had 1,600 panes of glass set in iron framing and is a prime example of Victorian architecture. Sydney&#x27;s Queen Victoria Markets Building, opened in 1898, was also an ambitious architectural project.

===United States===
====Early 20th century centers in the U.S.====

Early examples of &quot;stores under one roof&quot; include the nine-building shopping arcade Dayton Arcade in Dayton, Ohio (1902–1904), primarily built to rehouse the public food markets in more sanitary conditions, but which added retail clothing and household goods stores. The Lake View Store, opened July 1916, was a collection of stores under one roof aimed at the workers in the company town of Morgan Park, in Duluth, Minnesota.

Before the 1920s–1930s, the term &quot;shopping center&quot; in the U.S. was loosely applied to a collection of retail businesses. A city&#x27;s downtown might be called a &quot;shopping center&quot;. By the 1940s, &quot;shopping center&quot; implied — if not always a single owner — at least, comprehensive planning in the design and business plan, a place built according to an overall program that covered the target market, types of stores and store mix, signs, exterior lighting, and parking.

In the mid-20th century, with the rise of the suburb and automobile culture in the United States, a new style of shopping center was created away from downtown. Early shopping centers designed for the automobile include Market Square, Lake Forest, Illinois (1916), and Country Club Plaza, Kansas City, Missouri, , opened 1923.

The Bank Block in Grandview Heights, Ohio (1928) was an early strip mall or neighborhood center of 30 shops built along Grandview Avenue, with parking in the back for 400 cars. Uniquely for the time, it had multiple national grocery store tenants Kroger, Piggly Wiggly, and the A&amp;P Tea Company. The Park and Shop (1930) in Cleveland Park, Washington, D.C. was an early strip mall or neighborhood center with parking in the front. It was anchored by Piggly Wiggly and built in an L shape.

Other notable, large early centers with strips of independent stores, adjacent parking lots, but no department store anchors, include Highland Park Village (1931) in Dallas; and River Oaks Shopping Center (1937) in Houston.
====Downtown pedestrian malls and use of term &quot;mall&quot;====

In the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the term &quot;shopping mall&quot; was first used, but in the original sense of the word &quot;mall&quot;, that is, a pedestrian promenade (in U.K. usage a &quot;shopping precinct&quot;). Early downtown pedestrianized malls included the Kalamazoo Mall (the first, in 1959), &quot;Shoppers&#x27; See-Way&quot; in Toledo, Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach, Santa Monica Mall (1965), and malls in Fort Worth and in Canada&#x27;s capital, Ottawa. The downtown Urbana, Illinois mall, converted from a city street, was enclosed, designed by Victor Gruen.

===== Mall as synonym for some types of shopping centers =====
Although Bergen Mall (opened 1957) led other suburban shopping centers in using &quot;mall&quot; in their names, these types of properties were still referred to as &quot;shopping centers&quot; until the late 1960s, when the term &quot;shopping mall&quot; started to be used generically for large suburban shopping centers.

The term &quot;mall&quot; for regional enclosed shopping centers is not used in the U.K.

The term &quot;mall&quot; is used for those types of centers in some markets beyond North America such as India and the United Arab Emirates. In other developing countries such as Namibia and Zambia, &quot;Mall&quot; is found in the names of many small centers that qualify as neighborhood shopping centers or strip malls according to the ICSC.

====Open-air centers in the U.S.====

The suburban shopping center concept evolved further with larger open-air shopping centers anchored by major department stores. The first was a center in Ardmore, Pennsylvania later named Suburban Square, when the Philadelphia department store Strawbridge &amp; Clothier opened a four-story, branch there on May 12, 1930. A much larger example would be the Broadway-Crenshaw Center in Los Angeles built in 1947, anchored by a five-story Broadway and a May Company California.

Two of the largest shopping centers at the time were both in the San Fernando Valley, a suburban area of Los Angeles. They each consisted of one core open-air center and surrounding retail properties with various other owners, which would later hasten their decline as there wasn&#x27;t a single owner, but rather a merchants&#x27; association, which was unable to react quickly to competition in later decades. Valley Plaza opened August 12, 1951. In the mid-1950s, it claimed to be the largest shopping center on the West Coast of the United States and the third-largest in the country. The first part of the Panorama City Shopping Center opened as on October 10, 1955, and would grow until the mid-1960s, it claimed to be the first shopping center with four major department store anchors, even though the &quot;center&quot; was in fact a marketing association for multiple adjacent properties.

Northland Center near Detroit, built 1954, was the first of 4 centers that Victor Gruen built for Hudson&#x27;s (Eastland Center, Southland Center, and Westland Center were the others) At launch, Northland Center was the world&#x27;s largest shopping center.

====Enclosed &quot;malls&quot; in the U.S.====
The enclosed shopping mall did not appear until the mid-1950s. One of the earliest examples was the Valley Fair Shopping Center in Appleton, Wisconsin, which opened in March 1955. Valley Fair featured a number of modern features including central heating and cooling, a large outdoor parking area, semi-detached anchor stores, and restaurants. Later that year the world&#x27;s first fully enclosed shopping mall was opened in Luleå, in northern Sweden (architect: Ralph Erskine) and was named &quot;Shopping&quot;; the region now claims the highest shopping center density in Europe.

The idea of a regionally-sized, fully enclosed shopping complex was pioneered in 1956 by the Austrian-born architect and American immigrant Victor Gruen. This new generation of regional-size shopping centers began with the Gruen-designed Southdale Center, which opened in the Twin Cities suburb of Edina, Minnesota, United States in October 1956. For pioneering the soon-to-be enormously popular mall concept in this form, Gruen has been called the &quot;most influential architect of the twentieth century&quot; by Malcolm Gladwell.

The first retail complex to be promoted as a &quot;mall&quot; was Paramus, New Jersey&#x27;s Bergen Mall. The center, which opened with an open-air format in 1957, was enclosed in 1973. Aside from Southdale Center, significant early enclosed shopping malls were Harundale Mall (1958) in Glen Burnie, Maryland, Big Town Mall (1959) in Mesquite, Texas, Chris-Town Mall (1961) in Phoenix, Arizona, and Randhurst Center (1962) in Mount Prospect, Illinois.

Other early malls moved retailing away from the dense, commercial downtowns into the largely residential suburbs. This formula (enclosed space with stores attached, away from downtown, and accessible only by automobile) became a popular way to build retail across the world. Gruen himself came to abhor this effect of his new design; he decried the creation of enormous &quot;land wasting seas of parking&quot; and the spread of suburban sprawl.

Over the next five decades, the United States embarked on a wild shopping center construction spree. American commercial real estate developers built far more shopping centers and malls than could be justified by the country&#x27;s population, retail sales, or &quot;any&quot; other economic indicator. The number of American shopping centers exploded from 4,500 in 1960 to 70,000 by 1986 to just under 108,000 by 2010. By the time shopping mall operator Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield decided to get out of the United States in 2022, the United States had an average of 24.5 square feet of retail space per capita (in contrast to 4.5 square feet per capita in Europe).

====Decline of the mall in the U.S.====

Since the 1990s, the shopping mall has been in decline because of competition from discount stores and other shopping center formats, from e-commerce and most recently from closures and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===History of shopping centres outside the U.S.===
====Canada====
Don Mills Convenience Centre (now Shops at Don Mills) opened in 1955, in Toronto, Ontario. The first fully enclosed shopping mall in Canada was Wellington Square. It was designed for Eaton&#x27;s by John Graham, Jr. as an enclosed mall with a department store anchor and subterranean parking which opened in downtown London, Ontario, on August 11, 1960. After several renovations, it remains open today as Citi Plaza.

In the 1970s in Canada, the Ontario government created the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme, which helped finance the building of several downtown malls across Ontario such as Eaton Centre. The program was created to reverse the tide of small business leaving downtowns for larger sites surrounding the city. In the first quarter of 2012 shopping mall private investment hit an all-time low under 0.1 percent.

====United Kingdom====
In the UK, Chrisp Street Market was the first pedestrian shopping area built with a road at the shop fronts. The first mall-type shopping precinct in Great Britain was built in Birmingham&#x27;s city centre. Known as Bull Ring Centre (now Bull Ring, Birmingham), it was officially dedicated in May 1964. A notable example is the Halton Lea Shopping Centre (originally known as Shopping City) in Runcorn, which opened in 1972 and was conceived as the centre point for the new town&#x27;s development. Another early example is the Brent Cross Centre, Britain&#x27;s first out-of-town shopping centre and located on the northern outskirts of London, which was opened in March 1976. In the current era, shopping centres are found commonly all across the country.

====Australia====
Chermside Drive-In Shopping Centre started trading to the public in 1957, in Brisbane, Australia.

<text>Alter Channel, better known as Alter, was a private TV channel in Greece. It was launched in 1990 and owned by Eleftheri Tileorasi S.A. and was headed by Andreas Kouris. Alter&#x27;s programming mainly consisted of news, current affairs shows and entertaining programs.

Alter featured news anchor Nikos Hadjinikolaou, morning show host Giorgos Aftias, and investigative reporter Makis Triantafyllopoulos. Additionally, Alter also aired the award-winning program &quot;Fos Sto Tounel&quot;, which tracked down missing individuals and solved various crimes. The show also featured a lineup of children&#x27;s programming that aired daily. In early December 2011, Alter stopped broadcasting due to financial difficulties.

==History==
*1994 (March) – The station was launched as Channel 5.
*In a transitional period when it was co-owned by Altec and Kouris Media Group it was named &quot;Alter 5&quot;.
*2000 – On 29 October of this year it rebranded its name as Alter Channel.
*2002 (September) – Alter moves the news programming from 6 pm Balkan-Nile (UTC+02:00) to an hour and twenty minutes later to compete with other channels such as ANT1 news.
*2005 – On April 20, Alter overhauled its lineup and organised its schedule into blocks: morning, noon, afternoon and night. The morning block featured news and current affairs, as well as programming for children. The noon block had current affairs and entertainment shows. During the evening Alter broadcast serials and the main nightly newscast. At night, programming consisted mainly of entertainment and talk shows.
*2005 – Alter launches Alter Globe, serving North America (24 Aug.) on Dish Network, and Australia, Asia and Africa (December) on UBI World TV.
*2007 – Alter Globe was removed from the Dish Network platform in the US on August 31, 2007, and debuted on the rival platform DirecTV on September 26, 2007.
*2008 – Alter Globe launches in New Zealand via UBI World TV.
*2010 – Alter Globe is added to Cablevision in the US then removed a short while later due to insufficient growth.
*2011 (November) – Alter headquarters was occupied by its workers, who were striking in response to not having been paid in over a year.
*2011 (December) – The channel stopped broadcasting.
*2012 (April) – Plans to reopen the channel began, with finance believed to be by Israeli, French and Turkish investors.

==Alter Channel workers&#x27; occupation (30 November 2011 – 10 February 2012)==
On November 11, 2011, unpaid Alter employees occupied the station, broadcasting their demands over the transmission. Alter employees produced and transmitted their own program from January 1 until February 10, 2012, at which point all transmissions ceased.

The programme featured interviews with unemployed Greeks, unpaid workers, striking workers of the Greek steel industry, unpaid employees of newspaper Eleftherotypia, economist Dimitris Kazakis (who referred to the imposition of new measures by the government Papademos), the chairman of power company union GENOP, Nikos Fotopoulos, and former broadcast journalist John Kanelakis. Presenters of the show were George Filippakis and Akrivi Kirikos.

Also broadcast at this time were the documentaries Debtocracy, and W4 Crisis (Women of the crisis), which referred to the economic crisis and the Greek debt. The solidarity concert at the indoor basketball court of Peristeri was also broadcast on Monday, January 30, 2012. In April 2012, the major shareholder of ALTER George Kouris started negotiations with Israeli investors, who wanted to financially support the channel.

==Logo==
The original logo used by Alter Channel, which lasted for just one year, featured a swirl type symbol in red at the top and the words &#x27;Alter Channel&#x27; below in blue. The channel simply used the word &#x27;Alter&#x27; as its logo.

==Programming==
Alter shows include:

<doc id="332662" wikidata="Q2000593" url="?curid=332662" title="North Downs Way">
<text>The North Downs Way National Trail is a long-distance path in southern England, opened in 1978. It runs from Farnham to Dover, past Guildford, Dorking, Merstham, Otford and Rochester, along the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and Kent Downs AONB.

==History==
Planning for a new Long Distance Path, as they were classified in 1949, began in Kent in 1950. After an extensive survey, it was agreed that a route on &quot;a line which offers the best scenic qualities for the walker&quot; along the ridge of the North Downs, rather than the Pilgrim&#x27;s Way (which even in the 1960s was predominantly metalled road), was preferred. Working alongside Surrey County Council, plans were eventually submitted in 1966.
The North Downs Way was officially designated by the then Minister of Housing and Local Government, Anthony Greenwood, on 14 July 1969, and opened in parts shortly afterwards. The formal opening ceremony, led by Donald Coggan, Archbishop of Canterbury, took place on 30 September 1978. At that time, it was long, of which were newly created public rights of way.

==Route==


East of Boughton Lees, the path splits in two, the northern section running via Canterbury and the southern via Wye; at this stage the path crosses the Stour Valley Walk and passes the Wye Crown. The two sections of the path reunite at Dover. The northern route is long, and the southern route , the current length of the North Downs Way being . The official guide to the trail divides the North Downs Way into fifteen sections.

The pathway is mixed-category in that it varies throughout length from footpath (around 48%) status to bridleway, byway and road. Some 19% of the Way follows roads, though 75% of those are minor lanes.

The path (east of Boughton Lees, the southern section) runs along the ridge of the North Downs hills, and follows parts of the Pilgrims&#x27; Way.

==Geology==

As the pathway runs through the higher parts of the downland, the trail and surrounding countryside are characterised by chalk-based soil and calcareous grassland with broadleaf woodland on the upper slopes. It reflects the underlying sedimentary chalk deposits on the highest parts of the trail. There is livestock grazing on the lower slopes with clay soil and crop agriculture predominant in the valleys.

<doc id="332666" wikidata="Q183061" url="?curid=332666" title="Façade">
<text>A façade or facade (; ) is generally the front part or exterior of a building. It is a loanword from the French (), which means &quot;frontage&quot; or &quot;face&quot;.

In architecture, the façade of a building is often the most important aspect from a design standpoint, as it sets the tone for the rest of the building. From the engineering perspective, the façade is also of great importance due to its impact on energy efficiency. For historical façades, many local zoning regulations or other laws greatly restrict or even forbid their alteration.

==Etymology==
The word is a loanword from the French , which in turn comes from the Italian , from meaning &#x27;face&#x27;, ultimately from post-classical Latin . The earliest usage recorded by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is 1656.

==Façades added to earlier buildings==
It was quite common in the Georgian period for existing houses in English towns to be given a fashionable new façade. For example, in the city of Bath, The Bunch of Grapes in Westgate Street appears to be a Georgian building, but the appearance is only skin deep and some of the interior rooms still have Jacobean plasterwork ceilings.

This new construction has happened also in other places: in Santiago de Compostela the three-metre-deep Casa do Cabido was built to match the architectural order of the square, and the main Churrigueresque façade of the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, facing the Plaza del Obradoiro, is actually encasing and concealing the older Portico of Glory.

==High rise façades==
In modern high-rise building, the exterior walls are often suspended from the concrete floor slabs. Examples include curtain walls and precast concrete walls. The façade can at times be required to have a fire-resistance rating, for instance, if two buildings are very close together, to lower the likelihood of fire spreading from one building to another.

In general, the façade systems that are suspended or attached to the precast concrete slabs will be made from aluminum (powder coated or anodized) or stainless steel. In recent years more lavish materials such as titanium have sometimes been used, but due to their cost and susceptibility to panel edge staining these have not been popular.

Whether rated or not, fire protection is always a design consideration. The melting point of aluminum, , is typically reached within minutes of the start of a fire. Fire stops for such building joints can be qualified, too. Putting fire sprinkler systems on each floor has a profoundly positive effect on the fire safety of buildings with curtain walls.

The extended use of new materials, like polymers, resulted in an increase of high-rise building façade fires over the past few years, since they are more flammable than traditional materials.

Some building codes also limit the percentage of window area in exterior walls. When the exterior wall is not rated, the perimeter slab edge becomes a junction where rated slabs are abutting an unrated wall. For rated walls, one may also choose rated windows and fire doors, to maintain that wall&#x27;s rating.

==Film sets and theme parks==
On a film set and within most themed attractions, many of the buildings are only façade, which are far cheaper than actual buildings, and not subject to building codes (within film sets). In film sets, they are simply held up with supports from behind, and sometimes have boxes for actors to step in and out of from the front if necessary for a scene. Within theme parks, they are usually decoration for the interior ride or attraction, which is based on a simple building design.

<text>The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (, &#x27;), also referred to as theFirst Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, was a totalitarian Islamic state led by the Taliban that ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. At its peak, the Taliban government controlled approximately 90% of the country, while remaining regions in the northeast were held by the Northern Alliance, which maintained broad international recognition as a continuation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. The Taliban referred to the government as interim throughout the entire period of its existence, despite the strong and permanent role of Mullah Omar in the government.

After the September 11 attacks and subsequent declaration of a &quot;War on Terror&quot; by the United States, international opposition to the regime drastically increased, with diplomatic recognition from the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan being rescinded. The Islamic Emirate ceased to exist on 7 December 2001 after being overthrown by the Northern Alliance, which had been bolstered by the ISAF coalition established after a U.S.-led invasion of the country two months prior. The Taliban continued to refer to itself as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in official communications when it was out of power from 2001 to 2021.

==History==
===Early history and ethnic conflict===
The Taliban and its rule arose from the chaos after the Soviet–Afghan War. It began as an Islamic and Pashtun politico-religious movement composed of madrasa students in southern Afghanistan. Overwhelmingly ethnic Pashtuns, the Taliban blended Pashtunwali tribal code with elements of Salafist teaching to form an anti-Western and anti-modern Islamist ideology with which it ruled. It began to receive support from neighboring Pakistan as well as from Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. A small Taliban militia first emerged near Kandahar in the spring and summer of 1994, committing vigilante acts against minor warlords, with a fund of 250,000 USD from local businessmen. They soon began to receive backing from local Durrani Pashtun leaders.

The first major military activity of the Taliban was in October–November 1994 when they marched from Maiwand in southern Afghanistan to capture Kandahar City and the surrounding provinces, losing only a few dozen men. Starting with the capture of a border crossing and a huge ammunition dump from warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a few weeks later they freed &quot;a convoy trying to open a trade route from Pakistan to Central Asia&quot; from another group of warlords attempting to extort money. In the next three months this hitherto &quot;unknown force&quot; took control of twelve of Afghanistan&#x27;s 34 provinces, with Mujahideen warlords often surrendering to them without a fight and the &quot;heavily armed population&quot; giving up their weapons. The Taliban initially enjoyed enormous good will from Afghans weary of the corruption, brutality, and the incessant fighting of Mujahideen warlords. However, reactions and resistance would vary and increase among non-Pashtun people.

The Taliban considered many of Afghanistan&#x27;s other ethnic communities as foreign. Pashtun people are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan and comprised the vast majority of the Taliban movement. As the Taliban expanded from their southern and south-eastern strongholds, they encountered more resistance; their brand of Deobandism, incorporated with the Pashtunwali tribal code, was viewed as foreign by the other ethnic groups of Afghanistan. The Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif illustrated this ethnic tension.

===Rise to power and rule===
Spreading from Kandahar, the Taliban eventually captured Kabul in 1996. By the end of 2000, the Taliban controlled 90% of the country, aside from the opposition (Northern Alliance) strongholds found primarily in the northeast corner of Badakhshan Province. Areas under the Taliban&#x27;s direct control were mainly Afghanistan&#x27;s major cities and highways. Tribal khans and warlords had &quot;de facto&quot; direct control over various small towns, villages, and rural areas. The Taliban sought to establish law and order and to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic &quot;Sharia law&quot;, along with the religious edicts of Mullah Mohammed Omar, upon the entire country of Afghanistan.

During the five-year history of the Islamic Emirate, the Taliban regime interpreted the &quot;Sharia&quot; in accordance with the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence and the religious edicts of Mullah Omar. The Taliban forbade pork and alcohol, many types of consumer technology such as most music, television, and film, as well as most forms of art such as paintings or photography, male and female participation in sport, including football and chess; recreational activities such as kite-flying and keeping pigeons or other pets were also forbidden, and the birds were killed according to the Taliban&#x27;s ruling. Movie theaters were closed and repurposed as mosques. Celebration of the Western and Iranian New Year was forbidden. Taking photographs and displaying pictures or portraits was forbidden, as it was considered by the Taliban as a form of idolatry. Women were banned from working, girls were forbidden to attend schools or universities, were requested to observe &quot;purdah&quot; (physical separation of the sexes) and &quot;awrah&quot; (concealing the body with clothing), and to be accompanied outside their households by male relatives; those who violated these restrictions were punished. Men were forbidden to shave their beards and required to let them grow and keep them long according to the Taliban&#x27;s liking, and to wear turbans outside their households. Communists were systematically executed. Prayer was made compulsory and those who did not respect the religious obligation after the &quot;azaan&quot; were arrested. Gambling was banned, and thieves were punished by amputating their hands or feet. In 2000, the Taliban leader Mullah Omar officially banned opium cultivation and drug trafficking in Afghanistan; the Taliban succeeded in nearly eradicating the majority of the opium production (99%) by 2001. Under the Taliban governance of Afghanistan, both drug users and dealers were severely prosecuted. The Afghan custom of &quot;bacha bazi&quot;, a form of pederastic sexual slavery and pedophilia traditionally practiced in various provinces of Afghanistan, was also forbidden under the six-year reign of the Taliban regime.

Cabinet ministers and deputies were mullahs with a &quot;madrasah education&quot;. Several of them, such as the Minister of Health and Governor of the State bank, were primarily military commanders who were ready to leave their administrative posts to fight when needed. Military reverses that trapped them behind lines or led to their deaths increased the chaos in the national administration. At the national level, &quot;all senior Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara bureaucrats&quot; were replaced &quot;with Pashtuns, whether qualified or not&quot;. Consequently, the ministries &quot;by and large ceased to function&quot;.

Rashid described the Taliban government as &quot;a secret society run by Kandaharis ... mysterious, secretive, and dictatorial&quot;. They did not hold elections, as their spokesman explained:
They modeled their decision-making process on the Pashtun tribal council (&quot;jirga&quot;), together with what they believed to be the early Islamic model. Discussion was followed by a building of a consensus by the &quot;believers&quot;. Before capturing Kabul, there was talk of stepping aside once a government of &quot;good Muslims&quot; took power, and law and order were restored.

As the Taliban&#x27;s power grew, decisions were made by Mullah Omar without consulting the &quot;jirga&quot; and without consulting other parts of the country. One such instance is the rejection of Loya Jirga decision about expulsion of Osama bin Laden. Mullah Omar visited the capital, Kabul, only twice while in power. Instead of an election, their leader&#x27;s legitimacy came from an oath of allegiance (&quot;Bay&#x27;ah&quot;), in imitation of the Prophet and the first four Caliphs. On 4 April 1996, Mullah Omar had &quot;the Cloak of Muhammad&quot; taken from its shrine, Kirka Sharif, for the first time in 60 years. Wrapping himself in the relic, he appeared on the roof of a building in the center of Kandahar while hundreds of Pashtun mullahs below shouted &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin!&quot; (Commander of the Faithful), in a pledge of support. Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil explained:

The Taliban were very reluctant to share power, and since their ranks were overwhelmingly Pashtun they ruled as overlords over the 60% of Afghans from other ethnic groups. In local government, such as Kabul city council or Herat, Taliban loyalists, not locals, dominated, even when the Pashto-speaking Taliban could not communicate with the roughly half of the population who spoke Dari or other non-Pashtun tongues. Critics complained that this &quot;lack of local representation in urban administration made the Taliban appear as an occupying force&quot;.

=== Fall and legacy ===
The rule of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan came to an end in 2001 following the United States invasion. In May and June 2003, senior Taliban officials proclaimed the Taliban regrouped and ready for guerrilla war to expel US forces from Afghanistan. In late 2004, the then hidden Taliban leader Mohammed Omar announced an insurgency against &quot;America and its puppets&quot; (i.e. transitional Afghan government forces) to &quot;regain the sovereignty of our country&quot;. Following a long insurgency, the Taliban once again took control of Afghanistan in 2021.

==Government==

The goal of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan during the period 1996 to 2001 was to return the order of Abdur Rahman (&quot;the Iron Emir&quot;) by the re-establishment of a state with Pashtun dominance within the northern areas. The Taliban sought to establish an Islamic government through law and order alongside a strict interpretation of Islamic law, in accordance with the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence and the religious guidance of Mullah Omar, upon the entire land of Afghanistan. By 1998, the Taliban controlled 90% of Afghanistan under their interpretation of &quot;Sharia&quot;.

The Taliban modelled their decision-making process on the Pashtun tribal council (&quot;jirga&quot;), together with what they believed to be the early Islamic model. Discussion was followed by a building of a consensus by the &quot;believers&quot;. As the group&#x27;s power grew, decisions were made by Mullah Omar without consulting the &quot;jirga&quot; and without consulting other parts of the country. He visited the capital, Kabul, only twice while in power. Instead of an election, their leader&#x27;s legitimacy came from an oath of allegiance (&quot;Bay&#x27;ah&quot;), in imitation of the Prophet and the first four Caliphs. On 4 April 1996, Mullah Omar had &quot;the Cloak of the Prophet Mohammed&quot; taken from its shrine for the first time in 60 years. Wrapping himself in the relic, he appeared on the roof of a building in the center of Kandahar while hundreds of Pashtun mullahs below shouted &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin!&quot; (Commander of the Faithful), in a pledge of support.

==Human rights in the Emirate==
===Role of women in the Emirate===


During the Taliban&#x27;s period of rule, brutal repression of women was widespread in the Emirate. Abuses were frequently and violently enforced by the religious police. For example, the Taliban issued edicts forbidding women from being educated, forcing girls to leave schools and colleges. Women leaving their houses were required to be accompanied by a male relative and were obligated to wear the burqa, a traditional dress covering the entire body except for a small slit out of which to see. Those accused of disobeying were publicly beaten. In one instance, a young woman named Sohaila was charged with adultery after walking with a man who was not a relative; she was publicly flogged in Ghazi Stadium, receiving 100 lashes. Female employment was restricted to the medical sector, where male medical personnel were prohibited from treating women and girls. This extensive ban on the employment of women further resulted in the widespread closure of primary schools, as almost all teachers prior to the Taliban&#x27;s rise had been women, further restricting access to education not only to girls but also to boys. Restrictions became especially severe after the Taliban took control of the capital. In February 1998, for instance, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul and issued new regulations ordering people to blacken their windows so that women would not be visible from outside.

===Ban on entertainment and recreational activities===
During the Taliban rule of 1996–2001, they banned many recreational activities and games, such as football, kite flying, and chess. General entertainment such as televisions, cinemas, music with instrumental accompaniments, VCRs and satellite dishes were also banned. Also included in the list of banned items were &quot;musical instruments and accessories&quot; and all visual representation of living creatures.

It was reported that when Afghan children were caught kiting, a highly popular activity, they were beaten. When Khaled Hosseini learned through a 1999 news report that the Taliban had banned kite flying, a restriction he found particularly cruel, the news &quot;struck a personal chord&quot; for him, as he had grown up with the sport while living in Afghanistan. Hosseini was motivated to write a 25-page short story about two boys who fly kites in Kabul that he later developed into his first novel, The Kite Runner.

==International relations==

Regarding its relations with the rest of the world, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan held a policy of isolationism: &quot;The Taliban believe in non-interference in the affairs of other countries and similarly desire no outside interference in their country&#x27;s internal affairs&quot;. Despite these isolationist policies, the Taliban entered in a deal for oil, electricity, and gas with Turkmenistan as part of the Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India Pipeline.

While initially maintaining a friendly relationship, relations between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and Iran deteriorated in 1998 after Taliban forces seized the Iranian consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif and executed Iranian diplomats. Following this incident, Iran threatened to invade Afghanistan by massing up military forces near the Afghan border but intervention by the United Nations Security Council and the United States prevented the war.

Turkmenistan adopted a position of &quot;positive neutrality&quot; and limited cooperation with the Taliban.

China first initiated contact with the Taliban in 1998. In November 2000, China&#x27;s then-ambassador to Pakistan, Lu Shulin, became the first senior representative of a non-Muslim country to meet with Mullah Omar.

===Diplomatic recognition===
Between 1996 and 2001, only three widely recognized countries; Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) declared the Islamic Emirate to be the rightful government of Afghanistan. The Islamic Emirate would also receive recognition from the partially recognized Chechen Republic of Ichkeria; though Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov would later describe the Islamic Emirate as an &quot;illegitimate&quot; government. The Taliban government additionally received support from Turkmenistan, though the country did not provide the Emirate with formal recognition.

The Taliban government was not recognized by the United Nations, which instead continued to recognize the Islamic State of Afghanistan as being the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

Following the declaration of a &quot;War on Terror&quot; by the United States after the September 11 attacks by al-Qaeda in 2001, international opposition to the Taliban regime running the Islamic Emirate drastically increased, and the only remaining diplomatic recognition by Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates was rescinded under growing pressure.

===Sanctions===
On 15 October 1999, the UN Security Council established a sanctions regime to cover individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and/or the Taliban. Since the US Invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the sanctions were applied to individuals and organizations in all parts of the world; also targeting former members of the Taliban government.

On 27 January 2010, a United Nations sanctions committee removed five former senior Taliban officials from this list, in a move favored by Afghan president Karzai. The decision means the five will no longer be subject to an international travel ban, assets freeze and arms embargo. The five men, all high-ranking members of the Taliban government:

*Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil, former foreign minister.
*Fazal Mohammad, former deputy minister of commerce.
*Shams-us-Safa Aminzai, former Taliban foreign affairs press officer.
*Mohammad Musa Hottak, former deputy minister of planning.
*Abdul Hakim Munib, former deputy minister of frontier affairs.

All had been added to the list in January or February 2001.

===Bamiyan Buddhas controversy===

The &quot;Buddhas of Bamiyan&quot; were two 6th-century monumental statues carved into the side of a cliff in the Bamyan valley of central Afghanistan that were destroyed in March 2001, after the &quot;Taliban government&quot; declared that they were idols. International and local opinion strongly condemned the destruction of the Buddhas.

After Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997-98), the Bamyan valley came into Taliban control, and Abdul Wahed, a local Taliban commander announced his intentions to destroy the Buddhas. Initially in July 1999, Mohammed Omar decreed in Favour of preserving the statues, with plans to establish a tourism circuit.

But in March 2001, the statues were destroyed by the Taliban following a decree issued by Mullah Omar. In a subsequent interview, Mullah Omar said: &quot;I did not want to destroy the Bamiyan Buddha. In fact, some foreigners came to me and said they would like to conduct the repair work of the Bamiyan Buddha that had been slightly damaged due to rains. This shocked me. I thought, these callous people have no regard for thousands of living human beings – the Afghans who are dying of hunger, but they are so concerned about non-living objects like the Buddha. This was extremely deplorable. That is why I ordered its destruction. Had they come for humanitarian work, I would have never ordered the Buddha&#x27;s destruction.&quot;

However, during another interview on 13 March 2001, the then Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakel stated that the destruction was not a retaliation against the economic sanctions by the international community: &quot;We are destroying the statues in accordance with Islamic law, and it is purely a religious issue.&quot; A statement issued by the Ministry of religious affairs of the Taliban regime justified the destruction as being in accordance with Islamic law&quot;.

This prompted an international outcry from nations such as Japan, India, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Nepal, Iran, Qatar, and Russia. Even Saudi Arabia and the UAE, both of which were among only three nations to recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, voiced their opposition. The Arab branch of UNESCO, a cultural and educational agency of the United Nations, labelled the destruction as &quot;savage&quot;.

==Military==

The Taliban maintained 400 Soviet-built T-54/T-55 and T-62 tanks and more than 200 armored personnel carriers. The Taliban began training its own army and commanders; some were even trained by Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence.
Islamabad continued to support the Taliban, as Pakistani allies, in their push to conquer Afghanistan in the 1990s. The Islamic Army used child soldiers, many of them under 14 years old.

The air force under the Taliban maintained 5 MIG-21 MFs and 10 Sukhoi-22 fighter bombers. They held six Mil-Mi 8 helicopters, five Mi-35s, five Aero L-39C Albatrossess, six An-12s transport aircraft, among others. Their civil air service contained Boeing 727A/Bs, a Tu-154, five An-24s, and a DHC-6. All of these aircraft were destroyed by US forces during the war in Afghanistan in 2001. Most of the MIG-21 fleets ended up in an Afghan junkyard.

=== Conscription ===

According to the testimony of Guantanamo captives before their Combatant Status Review Tribunals, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its civil service – both done at gunpoint.

According to a report from Oxford University, the Taliban made widespread use of the conscription of children in 1997, 1998 and 1999.

==Economy==

The Kabul money markets responded positively during the first weeks of the Taliban occupation. But the Afghani soon fell in value. The Taliban imposed a 50% tax on any company operating in the country, and those who failed to pay were attacked. They also imposed a 6% import tax on anything brought into the country, and by 1998 had control of the major airports and border crossings which allowed them to establish a monopoly on all trade. By 2001, the per-capita income of the 25 million population was under $200, and the country was close to total economic collapse. As of 2007, the economy had begun to recover, with estimated foreign reserves of three billion dollars and a 13% increase in economic growth.

Under the Transit treaty between Afghanistan and Pakistan a massive network for smuggling developed. It had an estimated turnover of 2.5 billion dollars with the Taliban receiving between $100 and $130 million per year. These operations along with the trade from the Golden Crescent financed the war in Afghanistan and also had the side effect of destroying start up industries in Pakistan. Ahmed Rashid also explained that the Afghan Transit Trade agreed on by Pakistan was &quot;the largest official source of revenue for the Taliban.&quot;

Between 1996 and 1999 Mullah Omar reversed his opinions on the drug trade, apparently as it only harmed kafirs. The Taliban controlled 96% of Afghanistan&#x27;s poppy fields and made opium its largest source of taxation. Taxes on opium exports became one of the mainstays of Taliban income and their war economy. According to Rashid, &quot;drug money funded the weapons, ammunition and fuel for the war.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Finance Minister of the United Front, Wahidullah Sabawoon, declared the Taliban had no annual budget but that they &quot;appeared to spend US$300 million a year, nearly all of it on war.&quot; He added that the Taliban had come to increasingly rely on three sources of money: &quot;poppy, the Pakistanis and bin Laden.&quot;

In an economic sense, it seems, however, he had little choice, as due to the war of attrition continuing with the Northern Alliance, the income from continued opium production was all that prevented the country from starvation.
By 2000 Afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75% of the world&#x27;s supply and in 2000 grew an estimated 3,276 tonnes of opium from poppy cultivation on 82,171 hectares. At this juncture Omar passed a decree banning the cultivation of opium, and production dropped to an estimated 74 metric tonnes from poppy cultivation on 1,685 hectares. Many observers say the ban – which came in a bid for international recognition at the United Nations – was only issued in order to raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles. The year 1999 had yielded a record crop and had been followed by a lower but still large 2000 harvest. The trafficking of accumulated stocks by the Taliban continued in 2000 and 2001. In 2002, the UN mentioned the &quot;existence of significant stocks of opiates accumulated during previous years of bumper harvests.&quot; In September 2001 – before the 11 September attacks against the United States – the Taliban allegedly authorized Afghan peasants to sow opium again.

There was also an environmental toll to the country, heavy deforestation from the illegal trade in timber with hundreds of acres of pine and cedar forests in Kunar Province and Paktya being cleared. Throughout the country millions of acres were denuded to supply timber to the Pakistani markets, with no attempt made at reforestation, which has led to significant environmental damage. By 2001, when the Afghan Interim Administration took power the country&#x27;s infrastructure was in ruins, Telecommunications had failed, the road network was destroyed and Ministry of Finance buildings were in such a state of disrepair some were on the verge of collapse. On 6 July 1999 president Bill Clinton signed into effect executive order 13129. This order implemented a complete ban on any trade between the US and the Taliban regime and on 10 August they froze £5,000,000 in Ariana assets. On 19 December 2000, UN resolution 1333 was passed. It called for all assets to be frozen and for all states to close any offices belonging to the Taliban. This included the offices of Ariana Afghan Airlines. In 1999 the UN had passed resolution 1267 which had banned all international flights by Ariana apart from pre-approved humanitarian missions.

<text>Thomas Alexander Crerar (17 June 1876 – 11 April 1975) was a western Canadian politician and a leader of the short-lived Progressive Party of Canada. He was born in Molesworth, Ontario, and moved to Manitoba at a young age.

==Early career==
Crerar rose to prominence as leader of the Manitoba Grain Growers&#x27; Association in the 1910s. Although he had no experience as an elected official, he was appointed as Minister of Agriculture in Robert Laird Borden&#x27;s Union government on October 12, 1917, to provide a show of national unity during the First World War. He was easily elected to the House of Commons of Canada for Marquette in the election of 1917.

On June 6, 1919, Crerar resigned from his position in protest against the high tariff policies of the Conservative-dominated government. He was strongly in favor of free trade with the United States, which would have benefited the western farmers.

==Progressive Party of Canada==
In 1920, he was selected as leader of the Progressive Party. In the 1921 election, he led the party to a landslide victory in western Canada, giving them 65 seats in the House of Commons. Crerar failed to hold the party together, however. He resigned as leader in 1922, and the party collapsed shortly thereafter.

==Private sector work==
Crerar spent some time in the private sector before returning to politics in 1929, as a member of William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberal Party. Although once again not holding a seat in parliament, he was appointed Minister of Railways and Canals (Canada) on December 30, 1929, and won a by-election in Brandon on February 5, 1930. King&#x27;s government was defeated in the general election that followed, however, and Crerar was personally defeated in his riding.

==Return to politics==
He returned to parliament in the 1935 election, as the member for the northern Manitoba riding of Churchill. He was once again appointed to King&#x27;s cabinet, serving as Minister of Immigration and Colonization, Minister of Mines, Minister of the Interior and Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs from October 23, 1935, to November 30, 1936. On December 1, 1936, he was removed from most of his responsibilities and became simply Minister of Mines and Resources, holding the position until April 17, 1945.

Crerar was appointed to the Senate of Canada on April 18, 1945, and remained a Senator until his retirement on May 31, 1966. In 1962, Crerar considered it an &quot;error&quot; to give voting rights to Inuit and advocated revoking this right for Inuit in the eastern Arctic to vote. In 1973, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He died in 1975.

<doc id="332679" wikidata="Q1871373" url="?curid=332679" title="Lough Derg, County Donegal">
<text>Lough Derg or Loch Derg () is a lake in County Donegal, Republic of Ireland. It is near the border with Northern Ireland and lies about north of the border village of Pettigo. It is best known for St Patrick&#x27;s Purgatory, a site of pilgrimage on Station Island in the lake.

The lake is about in size, but is quite shallow, making it dangerous during bad weather. It has stocks of pike, perch and brown trout for angling.

==Annual pilgrimage==

The traditional three-day pilgrimage follows a one-thousand-year-old pattern. It begins on any day between 1 June and 13 August and lasts three days during which participants may only have one Lough Derg meal each day (black tea/coffee, dry toast, oat cakes, water). On arrival on the island, participants remove footwear and socks before commencing vocal prayers, walking around the island. A 24-hour night vigil then takes place on the first night. Generally, pilgrims depart on the morning of the third day having slept on their second night. They complete their pilgrimage fast at midnight the day of departure. The pilgrimage is suitable for persons over 15 years. Pilgrims must be able to walk and kneel unaided and be physically able to undertake the fast.

==Islands==

Including Station Island, there are about 30 islands and islets in Lough Derg, including:
*Allingham&#x27;s Island
*Ash Island
*Boat Island
*Bull&#x27;s Island
*Derg Beg Island
*Derg More Island
*Friar&#x27;s Island
*Goose Lodge
*Gravelands Islands
*Illan Philipboy
*Inishgoosk
*Kelly&#x27;s Isles
*Long Island
*Saints Island (on which there is a graveyard and the buried ruins of a monastery)
*Trough Island

== Folklore ==
According to folklore a man named Conan once threw a worm into the lake. The worm then grew into a large monster called Caoránach that devoured the local cattle. Once a majority of the cattle in Ulster died the locals blamed Conan who then enraged attacked the beast, killing it. Its blood dyed the rocks red and this is where the name Lough Derg comes from.

<doc id="332681" wikidata="Q77118" url="?curid=332681" title="Don Valley Stadium">
<text>Don Valley Stadium, England, was a stadium in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, completed in 1990, and hosted the 1991 World Student Games. It was named after the nearby River Don. The stadium was demolished in 2013.

The stadium and facilities were also used for a variety of other events and sports. It served as a training base for the City of Sheffield Athletic Club and was the home of the Sheffield Half Marathon. It was the home ground of the Sheffield Eagles from 1991 to 2013. Rotherham United F.C. played their home matches at Don Valley between 2008 and 2012 when they were without a ground in Rotherham. American football was staged there and the Channel 4 celebrity sports show &quot;The Games&quot; also used the stadium.

To save money, Sheffield City Council closed the stadium in 2013. The site has since been sold and redeveloped to include a research centre, sports centre and educational facilities for local universities. At the time of its closure, Don Valley Stadium was the second largest athletics stadium in the UK, with a seated capacity of 25,000.

==Design==

The whole of the running track and its infield was illuminated by the strongest floodlighting system in the country. Each of the five lighting towers used was above track level and carried a lighting head as tall as a typical three storey house ( high). All amenities for competitors and officials were at track level with all spectator facilities at natural ground level. This meant, for example, that disabled spectators had level access from the main car park straight through to the mid-level of spectator seating.

The track was sunk below ground level and was sheltered by banks of spectator seating, creating a &#x27;bowl effect&#x27;. This not only gave ideal viewing conditions but also offered athletes every opportunity of producing peak performances.

This record-breaking philosophy has even had a bearing on the angle at which the track was set and its positioning was relative to the prevailing winds and the rise and fall of the sun. The finishing line was positioned at the east end of the stadium which meant that in the afternoon and evening when most meetings are held the sun would always be at the athletes&#x27; backs in the finishing straight, as is the prevailing westerly wind.

VIP facilities were on a third level while the top-most of the four levels was set aside for hospitality boxes and press areas.

The stadium&#x27;s major focal point was its grandstand which held 10,000 spectators. The main canopy roof had an area of 6,000 square metres and was made of Teflon coated glass fibre. It was supported by ladder masts reaching above the top of the grandstand, the latter were painted yellow and gave the stadium its unmistakable appearance. They also gave completely uninterrupted sight lines around the bowl although coverage from rain in the bottom half of the stand could be problematic. Underneath the main stand was located an indoor running/warm-up track.

Up to 15,000 spectators could also be accommodated on the open terracing giving a seated capacity 25,000 for sports events. For musical performances the stadium could accommodate 15,000 seated guests, but had a maximum capacity of 50,000 if the field was used to accommodate standing fans.

The stadium was operated by Sheffield International Venues and owned by the Sheffield City Trust.

==History==

===Athletics===
The Don Valley Stadium, which cost £29 million, was the first entirely new outdoor national sporting venue built in Great Britain since Wembley in the early 1920s when it was completed in September 1990. It was built as the centre-piece of a £147 million construction programme needed to provide the necessary sports and cultural facilities to enable the city to host the 1991 Summer Universiade.

Jan Železný threw in the javelin on 29 August 1993 (which was a world record at the time) and infamously nearly hit the TV commentators who were interviewing close to the start/finish line.

There were plans to use the stadium in a Sheffield bid for the 2002 Commonwealth Games (which eventually went to Manchester) and also to use it as a potential joint ground for the city&#x27;s two football teams. In both of these eventualities the seated capacity would have been raised to 45,000. In addition when the British government cancelled the proposed Picketts Lock stadium in Edmonton, London which was to hold the 2005 World Championships in Athletics, UK Athletics suggested moving the host city to Sheffield using the Don Valley Stadium, but the IAAF stated that having London as the host city was central to Great Britain winning the bid to host the tournament. The championships bidding process was reopened as a result with the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in Helsinki, Finland hosting the 2005 World Athletics Championships.

===Other sports===
;Football

Although Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday never played any first-team games there (although United sometimes used it for reserve team games), it was announced in June 2008 that Don Valley would host League football for the first time in the 2008–09 season. Rotherham United played their &quot;home&quot; league games at the stadium until the completion of the New York Stadium in 2012. There were questions raised about the agreement, and the Football League stipulated that the club was obligated to move back to Rotherham within four years.

Rotherham United fans were allocated the 10,000 seat main stand which includes concourse, bar and executive facilities including lounges and boxes. Away fans were allocated around 2,000 seats on the wing to the right of the home fans.

The first match Rotherham United played at the Don Valley was a pre-season friendly game against Derby County on 19 July 2008. The game finished 0–0. There were several friendlies held at the stadium before the start of the season.

The first official league match was a 1–0 win over Lincoln City on the opening day of the 2008–09 season.

Exeter City won promotion from Football League 2 there with a 1–0 victory over Rotherham United in May 2009.

Two Sheffield based football clubs played football at the stadium during its existence: the world&#x27;s oldest football club, Sheffield, played at the Don Valley Stadium before their move to Dronfield and Sheffield Wednesday Ladies, who contested a Women&#x27;s FA Cup game against Bristol Academy on 13 March 2016.

;American Football
The stadium hosted BritBowl, the championship game of the British American Football Association Community Leagues in the United Kingdom between 1999 and 2007. The game is the most prestigious of the league&#x27;s three annual bowl games. The London Olympians won five of the eight bowls held at Don Valley.

;Rugby league
In 1991, the newly built Don Valley Stadium became home for Sheffield Eagles.

Sheffield was included on the schedule for a game against Australia during their 1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France and were beaten 80–2 in the first game following the first test match at Wembley. The Eagles had also played Australia in their mini 1992 Rugby League World Cup final tour at Don Valley, going down 52–22 to the eventual World Cup champions.

Sheffield Eagles became the first English team to beat an Australian team on English soil in the World Club Challenge in 1997 when they defeated the Perth Reds 26–22 on 15 June (it would be one of only 8 wins by Super League clubs in the 65 games played in the tournament). The club&#x27;s record attendance was set in August 1997 when 10,603 spectators saw Sheffield play Bradford Bulls.

On 16 October 2009, the Eagles announced the club would be moving their home games from the start of the 2010 season to Bramall Lane, home of Sheffield United, in a bid to increase attendances and atmosphere.

The stadium also hosted the annual varsity rugby league game between Sheffield&#x27;s two universities, the University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University.

===Music ===

The first concert to be held at the stadium was a Jason Donovan gig held in September 1990. Since then, a number of famous artists have performed at the venue;

Def Leppard played at the stadium on 6 June 1993, as part of their Adrenalize World Tour.

Bon Jovi played at the venue in June 1995 on their &quot;These Days&quot; tour. They were supported by Van Halen, Thunder and Crown of Thorns.

U2 played at this venue on 21 August 2009 with their 360° Tour in front of 49,955. The gig was broadcast live via Internet radio around the world.

The Rolling Stones performed at the stadium thrice. On 9 July 1995 as part of the Voodoo Lounge Tour, 6 June 1999 for the Bridges to Babylon Tour, and again on 27 August 2006 during the A Bigger Bang tour. The memorable part of the latter gig being a heavy rainstorm during the Stones&#x27; performance.

Tina Turner performed two sold-out concerts at the stadium during her Wildest Dreams Tour on 18 July 1996 (audience 51,500) and Twenty Four Seven Tour on 13 July 2000.

Red Hot Chili Peppers played at the stadium on 6 July 2006 as part of the Stadium Arcadium tour.

Michael Jackson performed a sell-out concert at the stadium on 9 July 1997, during his &quot;HIStory World Tour&quot; for an audience of 45,000 people. It was Jackson&#x27;s first and only solo-performance in Sheffield.

Celine Dion performed for one night in front of 43,469 fans on 6 July 1999, during her Let&#x27;s Talk About Love World Tour.

The Spice Girls performed two sell-out shows during their Spiceworld Tour on 11 and 12 September 1998. It was the group&#x27;s first concert in Britain following Geri Halliwell leaving the group.

In 2011, the Arctic Monkeys hosted a two-day comeback festival at the adjacent Don Valley grass bowl to celebrate the release of &quot;Suck It and See&quot;. The band headlined and were supported on both days, by Miles Kane, The Vaccines, Dead Sons and Anna Calvi as well as local artists.

==Closure==
Reports emerged in January 2013 that Labour Sheffield City Council were considering demolishing the stadium as part of a money-saving exercise. It was suggested that regional athletics competitions would move to the city&#x27;s smaller Woodbourn Road Athletics Stadium, which closed in 2011. The nearest major athletics stadium would then be the South Leeds Stadium in Leeds. The council confirmed the closure of Don Valley Stadium on 11 January 2013. A final closure date of 30 September 2013 was set by Sheffield City Council in April of the same year and despite a petition signed by 5,922 people campaigning against the closure, plans were announced by Labour Party Councillor Isobel Bowler to start the demolition of the stadium on 21 November 2013. Demolition contractor Demex began the demolition on this date, estimating that the process would take approximately six months.

The Liberal Democrat Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg opposed the stadium&#x27;s closure, claiming the city council aimed to prevent the Save Don Valley Stadium group from obtaining central government grants in order to develop a business plan that would keep the venue open. The UK Independence Party also expressed opposition to the stadium&#x27;s closure and stated their intention to put together a campaign to save the stadium. UKIP general secretary and Sheffield Branch chairman Jonathan Arnott commented that &quot;there are so many examples of Council waste where cuts could and should be made without affecting local residents.&quot;

==Demolition and redevelopment==
On 11 January 2013, Sheffield City Council announced that the stadium was to be closed and demolished as part of a £50 million budget-cutting measure. An eleventh hour meeting was held at Sheffield Town Hall on 1 March 2013. Local and national politicians met to discuss the proposed closure and any possibility of preventing it. A final decision was made that the stadium was to close in September 2013 and would be demolished from 21 November 2013. In October 2014, it was announced that the Olympic Legacy Park would be constructed on the site of the old Don Valley Stadium. It will contain an Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre, an indoor sports arena, a sports pitch and stadium to be home of the Sheffield Eagles, Oasis Academy and a University Technical College (UTC) backed by Sheffield College and Sheffield Hallam University.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News 6/8/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="332685" wikidata="Q4119414" url="?curid=332685" title="The Tale of the Eagle">
<text>The Tale of the Eagle is an Albanian folk tale that explains how Albania and Albanians received their indigenous name.

==Tale==
A youth was hunting in the mountains. An eagle flying above him alighted on top of a crag. The eagle was especially large and had a snake in its beak. After a while, the eagle flew away from the crag where it had its nest. The youth then climbed to the top of the crag where he saw, in the nest, an eaglet playing with the dead snake. However, the snake was not dead. Suddenly it stirred, revealed its fangs and was ready to pierce the eaglet with its deadly venom. The youth quickly took out his bow and arrow and killed the snake. Then he took the eaglet and started for his home. Suddenly the youth heard above him the loud whir of the great eagle&#x27;s wings.

&quot;Why do you kidnap my child?&quot; cried the eagle.

&quot;The child is mine because I saved it from the snake which you didn&#x27;t kill,&quot; answered the youth.

&quot;Give me back my child, and I will give you as a reward the sharpness of my eyes and the powerful strength of my wings. You will become invincible, and you will be called by my name!&quot;

Thus the youth handed over the eaglet. After the eaglet grew, it would always fly above the head of the youth, now a grown man, who with his bow and arrows killed many wild beasts of the forest, and with his sword slew many enemies of the land. During all of these feats, the eagle faithfully watched over and guided him.

Amazed by the valiant hunter&#x27;s deeds, the people of the land elected him king and called him &quot;Shqipëtar&quot;, which is to say &quot;Son of the Eagle&quot; (&quot;shqipe&quot; or &quot;shqiponjë&quot; is Albanian for eagle) and his kingdom became known as &quot;Shqipëria&quot; or &quot;Land of the Eagles&quot;.The two heads on the eagle represent the north and the south.

<doc id="332686" wikidata="Q3048712" url="?curid=332686" title="The Annex">
<text>The Annex is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The traditional boundaries of the neighbourhood are north to Dupont Street, south to Bloor Street, west to Bathurst Street and east to Avenue Road. The City of Toronto recognizes a broader neighbourhood definition that includes the adjacent Seaton Village and Yorkville areas.

Bordering the University of Toronto, the Annex has long been a student quarter, and it is also home to many fraternity houses and members of the university&#x27;s faculty. According to the 2011 Canadian census, the neighbourhood has an average income of $66,742.67, significantly above the average income in the Toronto census metropolitan area.

The Annex is not known for its big population of immigrants – in 2011, Statistics Canada declared that there were about 4,665 immigrants (predominantly from the United Kingdom and the United States) living in the area. As of the 2021 census, the three census tracts that compose the Annex have a total population of 14,149 and an average population density of 9,685 people/km2.

==Character==

The Annex is mainly residential, and streets are lined with tall trees dwarfing the large Victorian and Edwardian houses, most of them built between 1880 and the early 1900s. The 1950s and 1960s saw the replacement of some houses with mid-rise (and a handful of high-rise) apartment buildings in the International style. These were surrounded with landscaped green spaces in an attempt to better fit into the neighbourhood. Due to a government freeze on development in 1975 for buildings higher than 45 feet, most of the original houses still exist.

There are now over 500 buildings in the Annex that are protected by the Toronto Historical Board, so developers have less chance of maximizing their ventures by tearing down old mansions and developing low rises and townhouse complexes. Some of architect Uno Prii&#x27;s most expressive, sculptural apartment buildings are located in the Annex. Because of its proximity to the university, the Annex has a high rate of seasonal tenant turnover, and its residents range from university students to older long-time residents.

The stretch of Bloor Street between Avenue Road and Bathurst Street is a vibrant social and mixed-use area offering a wide range of services from moderate-priced dining to independent discount retailers, in buildings which often include residential space in upper floors.

Just west of the Annex proper, along Bloor Street (between Bathurst Street and Christie Street), there are street signs that post Koreatown due to the high percentage of Korean-owned businesses (although that neighbourhood is officially called Seaton Village), but many locals refer to the area as &quot;West Annex&quot; (even though the official West Annex area is bounded by Bloor, Bathurst, the CP Railway, and Spadina). During the 1950s and 1960s, an influx of Hungarian immigrants moved into the neighbourhood after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution was suppressed, and some of the businesses and properties along Bloor may still be owned by Hungarian-Canadian families.

===Annex style house===

The Annex is home to many examples of a uniquely Torontonian style of house that was popular among the city&#x27;s elite in the late nineteenth century. Examples of this style survive in the former upper class areas along Jarvis and Sherbourne Street, and also around the University of Toronto campus. Most of these buildings are found in the Annex, and the style is thus known by some as the &#x27;Annex style house.&#x27;

The original conception is attributed to E. J. Lennox, the most prominent architect in late nineteenth century Toronto. His design for the residence of contractor Lewis Lukes at 37 Madison Avenue (completed in 1887) introduced a design that would be imitated and modified over the next two decades.

The Annex style house borrows elements from both the American Richardsonian Romanesque and the British Queen Anne Revival. Annex style houses typically feature large rounded Romanesque arches, along with Queen Anne style decorative items such as turrets. Attics are emphasized in the exterior architecture. The houses are most often made of brick, though some also incorporate Credit Valley sandstone.

Originally built for some of the city&#x27;s wealthiest citizens, the houses are generally large. As the wealthy moved away from the neighbourhood, many of the houses were subdivided into apartments.

===Seaton Village===

Seaton Village, or the &#x27;West Annex&#x27; as it is sometimes incorrectly known, is west of Bathurst Street and includes the Koreatown shopping district at its southern border. While Seaton Village shares several characteristics with The Annex (notably its architecture and its popularity with University of Toronto students), it is generally quieter, more family-oriented, and has smaller, less expensive homes.

Vermont Square Park is near the centre of Seaton Village. The park has a playground, including a wading pool. St. Albans Boys and Girls club and the Bill Bolton hockey arena are also located in the park.

Clinton Street features a house almost totally covered with circular &quot;woodcakes&quot; cut from billiards cues.

==History==
European settlement of this area began in the 1790s when surveyors laid out York Township. The area east of Brunswick Avenue became part of the village of Yorkville, while the region west of Brunswick was part of Seaton Village. In 1883, Yorkville agreed to annexation with the City of Toronto. In 1886, Simeon Janes, a developer, created a subdivision which he called the Toronto Annex. The Annex area became part of Toronto in 1887 and Seaton Village joined Toronto in 1888.

First residents of the area included Timothy Eaton, patriarch of the Eatons Department Store, and George Gooderham Sr. (1830–1905), president of Gooderham &amp; Worts Distillery. The Annex&#x27;s first Golden Era lasted until the early 1900s, when the upper classes began to migrate northward above the Davenport escarpment to newer more fashionable suburbs in Forest Hill and Lawrence Park.

In the 1960s, the proposed Spadina Expressway would have divided the Annex in half. Annex area residents, along with other resident grassroots groups, successfully opposed its construction.

===Notable people===

The northern Annex (north of Bloor Street) was home to many members of Toronto&#x27;s Eaton family and members of the Baldwin, Ross, and Simpson families until the mid-twentieth century. Timothy Eaton had his residence at the corner of Lowther Avenue and Walmer Road, and the Baldwin family built three houses on the northern side of Lowther near Bedford Road. Beatrice Worsley, who received the first PhD in what would now be called computer science and was the first female computer scientist in Canada, lived on Lowther on land which is now part of Bedford Park. Frederick Banting, the co-discoverer of insulin and recipient of the Nobel Prize for Medicine, lived on the south east corner of Lowther and Bedford Road.

Admiral Road in the Annex is home to the writer Margaret Atwood, as well as John Ralston Saul and his wife, the former Governor General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson. Her ex-husband Stephen Clarkson lived on nearby Lowther Avenue, across from former MP Belinda Stronach. Former Prime Minister and Nobel Laureate Lester B. Pearson lived at 12 Admiral Road from 1925 to 1928. bpnichol lived at 59 Admiral with Lea Hindley-Smith, founder of Therafields, and her family, from 1966.

David Suzuki lived for years on Bernard Avenue, and Catherine O&#x27;Hara lived in the Annex for several years. Explorer Norman Elder owned &#x27;The Norman Elder Museum&#x27; at 140 Bedford Road. The noted urban theorist and activist Jane Jacobs lived at 69 Albany Avenue from 1971 until her death in 2006. CBC writer, producer and actor Ken Finkleman and members of the rock band Sloan also reside in the neighbourhood.

Brunswick Avenue in particular has served as a home for many writers, including Matt Cohen, Austin Clarke, Morley Callaghan, Howard Engel, Marian Engel, and bpNichol. Katherine Govier, who wrote a collection of short stories entitled &quot;Fables of Brunswick Avenue&quot; (published in 1985), also lived on this street.

Seaton Village is the former home of Canadian poet and children&#x27;s author Dennis Lee, Oscar-winning (for &quot;Chicago&quot;) sound engineer David Lee (no relation, now deceased), sociologist Barry Wellman, and Meghan Markle. It is the current home of novelist and playwright Ann-Marie MacDonald.

Major League Baseball All Star outfielder Goody Rosen also lived in the Annex.

==Transportation==
The Annex is well served by public transit, including four Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway stations: Bathurst, Dupont, St. George, and Spadina. Spadina and St. George stations act as interchange stations, allowing passengers both north-west subway travel as well as east–west. Streetcar services run south from Bathurst and Spadina stations. Bus service operates on Avenue Road, Spadina Road, Dupont Street, Davenport Street, and northward on Bathurst Street.

<text>Theria ( or ; ) is a subclass of mammals amongst the Theriiformes. Theria includes the eutherians (including the placental mammals) and the metatherians (including the marsupials) but excludes the egg-laying monotremes and various extinct mammals evolving prior to the common ancestor of placentals and marsupials.

== Characteristics ==
Therians give birth to live young without a shelled egg. This is possible thanks to key proteins called syncytins which allow exchanges between the mother and its offspring through a placenta, even rudimental ones such as in marsupials. Genetic studies have suggested a viral origin of syncytins through the endogenization process.

The marsupials and the placentals evolved from a common therian ancestor that gave live birth by suppressing the mother&#x27;s immune system. While the marsupials continued to give birth to an underdeveloped fetus after a short pregnancy, the ancestors of placentals gradually evolved a prolonged pregnancy.

An approximately 21-28 day estrous cycle/menstrual cycle occurs in therian females. 

The exit openings of the urogenital system and the rectal opening (anus) are separated.

The mammary glands lead to the teats.

Therians no longer have the coracoid bone, unlike their cousins, monotremes.

Pinnae (external ears) are also a distinctive trait that is a therian exclusivity, though some therians, such as the earless seals, have lost them secondarily.

The flexible and protruding nose in therians is not found in any other vertebrates, and is the product of modified cells involved in the development of the upper jaw in other tetrapods.

Almost all therians have whiskers.

The SRY gene is a protein in therians that helps initiate male sex determination.

== Evolution ==
The earliest known therian mammal fossil is &quot;Juramaia&quot;, from China&#x27;s Late Jurassic (Oxfordian stage). However, the age estimates of the site are disputed based on the geological complexity and the geographically widespread nature of the Tiaojishan Formations. Further, King and Beck in 2020 argue for an Early Cretaceous age for &quot;Juramaia sinensis&quot;, in line with similar early mammaliaformes.

A recent review of the Southern Hemisphere Mesozoic mammal fossil record has argued that tribosphenic mammals arose in the Southern Hemisphere during the Early Jurassic, around 50 million years prior to the clade&#x27;s earliest undisputed appearance in the Northern Hemisphere.

Molecular data suggests that therians may have originated even earlier, during the Early Jurassic. Therian mammals began to diversify 10-20 million years before the dinosaur extinction.

==Taxonomy==
The rank of &quot;Theria&quot; may vary depending on the classification system used. The textbook classification system by Vaughan et al. (2000) gives the following:

In the above system, Theria is a subclass. Alternatively, in the system proposed by
McKenna and Bell (1997) it is ranked as a supercohort under the subclass Theriiformes:

Another classification proposed by Luo et al. (2002) does not assign any rank to the taxonomic levels, but uses a purely cladistic system instead.

<doc id="332693" wikidata="Q3359776" url="?curid=332693" title="Burroughs Large Systems">
<text>The Burroughs Large Systems Group produced a family of large 48-bit mainframes using stack machine instruction sets with dense syllables. The first machine in the family was the B5000 in 1961, which was optimized for compiling ALGOL 60 programs extremely well, using single-pass compilers. The B5000 evolved into the B5500 (disk rather than drum) and the B5700 (up to four systems running as a cluster). Subsequent major redesigns include the B6500/B6700 line and its successors, as well as the separate B8500 line.

In the 1970s, the Burroughs Corporation was organized into three divisions with very different product line architectures for high-end, mid-range, and entry-level business computer systems. Each division&#x27;s product line grew from a different concept for how to optimize a computer&#x27;s instruction set for particular programming languages. &quot;Burroughs Large Systems&quot; referred to all of these large-system product lines together, in contrast to the COBOL-optimized Medium Systems (B2000, B3000, and B4000) or the flexible-architecture Small Systems (B1000).

==Background==
Founded in the 1880s, Burroughs was the oldest continuously operating company in computing (Elliott Brothers was founded before Burroughs, but did not make computing devices in the 19th century). By the late 1950s its computing equipment was still limited to electromechanical accounting machines such as the Sensimatic. It had nothing to compete with its traditional rivals IBM and NCR, who had started to produce larger-scale computers, or with recently founded Univac. In 1956, they purchased ElectroData Corporation and rebranded its design as the B205.

Burroughs&#x27; first internally developed machine, the B5000, was designed in 1961 and Burroughs sought to address its late entry in the market with the strategy of a completely different design based on the most advanced computing ideas available at the time. While the B5000 architecture is dead, it inspired the B6500 (and subsequent B6700 and B7700). Computers using that architecture were still in production as the Unisys ClearPath Libra servers which run an evolved but compatible version of the MCP operating system first introduced with the B6700. The third and largest line, the B8500, had no commercial success. In addition to a proprietary CMOS processor design, Unisys also uses Intel Xeon processors and runs MCP, Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems on their Libra servers; the use of custom chips was gradually eliminated, and by 2018 the Libra servers had been strictly commodity Intel for some years.

==B5000, B5500, and B5700==
The first member of the first series, the B5000, was designed beginning in 1961 by a team under the leadership of Robert (Bob) Barton. It had an unusual architecture. It has been listed by the computing scientist John Mashey as one of the architectures that he admires the most. &quot;I always thought it was one of the most innovative examples of combined hardware/software design I&#x27;ve seen, and far ahead of its time.&quot; The B5000 was succeeded by the B5500, which used disks rather than drum storage, and the B5700, which allowed multiple CPUs to be clustered around shared disk. While there was no successor to the B5700, the B5000 line heavily influenced the design of the B6500, and Burroughs ported the Master Control Program (MCP) to that machine.

===Features===
* Hardware was designed to support software requirements
* Hardware designed to exclusively support high-level programming languages
* Simplified instruction set
* No Assembly language or assembler; all system software written in an extended variety of ALGOL 60 named ESPOL. However, ESPOL had statements for each of the syllables in the architecture.
* Partially data-driven tagged and descriptor-based design
* Few programmer accessible registers
* Stack machine where all operations use the stack rather than explicit operands. This approach has by now fallen out of favor.
* All interrupts and procedure calls use the stack
* Support for other languages such as COBOL
* Powerful string manipulation
* All code automatically reentrant: programmers don&#x27;t have to do anything more to have any code in any language spread across processors than to use just the two shown simple primitives.
* Support for an operating system (MCP, Master Control Program)
* Support for asymmetric (master/slave) multiprocessing
* An attempt at a secure architecture prohibiting unauthorized access of data or disruptions to operations
* Early error-detection supporting development and testing of software
* A commercial implementation virtual memory, preceded only by the Ferranti Atlas.
* First segmented memory model

====System design====
The B5000 was unusual at the time in that the architecture and instruction set were designed with the needs of software taken into consideration. This was a large departure from the computer system design of the time, where a processor and its instruction set would be designed and then handed over to the software people.

The B5000, B5500 and B5700 in Word Mode has two different addressing modes, depending on whether it is executing a main program (SALF off) or a subroutine (SALF on). For a main program, the T field of an Operand Call or Descriptor Call syllable is relative to the Program Reference Table (PRT). For subroutines, the type of addressing is dependent on the high three bits of T and on the Mark Stack FlipFlop (MSFF), as shown in B5x00 Relative Addressing.

====Language support====
The B5000 was designed to exclusively support high-level languages. This was at a time when such languages were just coming to prominence with FORTRAN and then COBOL. FORTRAN and COBOL were considered weaker languages by some, when it comes to modern software techniques, so a newer, mostly untried language was adopted, ALGOL-60. The ALGOL dialect chosen for the B5000 was Elliott ALGOL, first designed and implemented by C. A. R. Hoare on an Elliott 503. This was a practical extension of ALGOL with I/O instructions (which ALGOL had ignored) and powerful string processing instructions.
Hoare&#x27;s famous Turing Award lecture was on this subject.

Thus the B5000 was based on a very powerful language. Donald Knuth had previously implemented ALGOL 58 on an earlier Burroughs machine during the three months of his summer break, and he was peripherally involved in the B5000 design as a consultant. Many wrote ALGOL off, mistakenly believing that high-level languages could not have the same power as assembler, and thus not realizing ALGOL&#x27;s potential as a systems programming language.

The Burroughs ALGOL compiler was very fast — this impressed the Dutch scientist Edsger Dijkstra when he submitted a program to be compiled at the B5000 Pasadena plant. His deck of cards was compiled almost immediately and he immediately wanted several machines for his university, Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. The compiler was fast for several reasons, but the primary reason was that it was a one-pass compiler. Early computers did not have enough memory to store the source code, so compilers (and even assemblers) usually needed to read the source code more than once. The Burroughs ALGOL syntax, unlike the official language, requires that each variable (or other object) be declared before it is used, so it is feasible to write an ALGOL compiler that reads the data only once. This concept has profound theoretical implications, but it also permits very fast compiling. Burroughs large systems could compile as fast as they could read the source code from the punched cards, and they had the fastest card readers in the industry.

The powerful Burroughs COBOL compiler was also a one-pass compiler and equally fast. A 4000-card COBOL program compiled as fast as the 1000-card/minute readers could read the code. The program was ready to use as soon as the cards went through the reader.

==B6500, B6700/B7700, and successors==


The B6500 (delivery in 1969) and B7500 were the first computers in the only line of Burroughs systems to survive to the present day. While they were inspired by the B5000, they had a totally new architecture. Among the most important differences were
*The B6500 had variable length instructions with an 8-bit syllable instead of fixed length instructions with a 12-bit syllable.
*The B6500 had a 51-bit instead of a 48-bit word, and used 3 bits as a tag
*The B6500 had Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)
*The B6500 had a Saguaro stack
*The B6500 had paged arrays
*The B6500 had &quot;Display Registers, D1 thru D32&quot; to allow nested subroutines to access variables in outer blocks.
*The B6500 used monolithic integrated circuits with magnetic thin-film memory.
Among other customers of the B6700 and B7700 were all five New Zealand universities in 1971.

==B8500==
The B8500 line derives from the D825, a military computer that was inspired by the B5000.

The B8500 was designed in the 1960s as an attempt to merge the B5500 and the D825 designs. The system used monolithic integrated circuits with magnetic thin-film memory. The architecture employed a 48-bit word, stack, and descriptors like the B5500, but was not advertised as being upward-compatible. The B8500 could never be gotten to work reliably, and the project was canceled after 1970, never having delivered a completed system.

==History==


The central concept of virtual memory appeared in the designs of the Ferranti Atlas and the Rice Institute Computer, and the central concepts of descriptors and tagged architecture appeared in the design of the Rice Institute Computer in the late 1950s. However, even if those designs had a direct influence on Burroughs, the architectures of the B5000, B6500 and B8500 were very different from those of the Atlas and the Rice machine; they are also very different from each other.

The first of the Burroughs large systems was the B5000. Designed in 1961, it was a second-generation computer using discrete transistor logic and magnetic-core memory, followed by the B5500 and B5700. The first machines to replace the B5000 architecture were the B6500 and B7500. The successor machines to the B6500 and B7500 followed the hardware development trends to re-implement the architectures in new logic over the next 25 years, with the B6500, B7500, B6700, B7700, B6800, B7800, B5900, B7900 and finally the Burroughs A series. After a merger in which Burroughs acquired Sperry Corporation and changed its name to Unisys, the company continued to develop new machines based on the MCP CMOS ASIC. These machines were the Libra 100 through the Libra 500, with the Libra 590 being announced in 2005. Later Libras, including the 590, also incorporate Intel Xeon processors and can run the Burroughs large systems architecture in emulation as well as on the MCP CMOS processors. It is unclear if Unisys will continue development of new MCP CMOS ASICs.

Hardware and software design, development, and manufacturing were split between two primary locations, in Orange County, California, and the outskirts of Philadelphia. The initial Large Systems Plant, which developed the B5000 and B5500, was located in Pasadena, California but moved to City of Industry, California, where it developed the B6500. The Orange County location, which was based in a plant in Mission Viejo, California but at times included facilities in nearby Irvine and Lake Forest, was responsible for the smaller B6x00 line, while the East Coast operations, based in Tredyffrin, Pennsylvania, handled the larger B7x00 line. All machines from both lines were fully object-compatible, meaning a program compiled on one could be executed on another. Newer and larger models had instructions which were not supported on older and slower models, but the hardware, when encountering an unrecognized instruction, invoked an operating system function which interpreted it. Other differences include how process switching and I/O were handled, and maintenance and cold-starting functionality. Larger systems included hardware process scheduling and more capable input/output modules, and more highly functional maintenance processors. When the Bxx00 models were replaced by the A Series models, the differences were retained but no longer readily identifiable by model number.

==ALGOL==

The Burroughs large systems implement ALGOL-derived stack architectures. The B5000 was the first stack-based system.

While B5000 was specifically designed to support ALGOL, this was only a starting point. Other business-oriented languages such as COBOL were also well supported, most notably by the powerful string operators which were included for the development of fast compilers.

The ALGOL used on the B5000 is an extended ALGOL subset. It includes powerful string manipulation instructions but excludes certain ALGOL constructs, notably unspecified formal parameters. A DEFINE mechanism serves a similar purpose to the #defines found in C, but is fully integrated into the language rather than being a preprocessor. The EVENT data type facilitates coordination between processes, and ON FAULT blocks enable handling program faults.

The user level of ALGOL does not include many of the insecure constructs needed by the operating system and other system software. Two levels of language extensions provide the additional constructs: ESPOL and NEWP for writing the MCP and closely related software, and DCALGOL and DMALGOL to provide more specific extensions for specific kinds of system software.

===ESPOL and NEWP===
Originally, the B5000 MCP operating system was written in an extension of extended ALGOL called ESPOL (Executive Systems Programming Oriented Language). This was replaced in the mid-to-late 70s by a language called NEWP. Though NEWP probably just meant &quot;New Programming language&quot;, legends surround the name. A common (perhaps apocryphal) story within Burroughs at the time suggested it came from &quot;&quot;No Executive Washroom Privileges&quot;.&quot; Another story is that circa 1976, John McClintock of Burroughs (the software engineer developing NEWP) named the language &quot;NEWP&quot; after being asked, yet again, &quot;does it have a name yet&quot;: answering &quot;nyoooop&quot;, he adopted that as a name. NEWP, too, was a subset ALGOL extension, but it was more secure than ESPOL, and dropped some little-used complexities of ALGOL. In fact, all unsafe constructs are rejected by the NEWP compiler unless a block is specifically marked to allow those instructions. Such marking of blocks provide a multi-level protection mechanism.

NEWP programs that contain unsafe constructs are initially non-executable. The security administrator of a system is able to &quot;bless&quot; such programs and make them executable, but normal users are not able to do this. (Even &quot;privileged users&quot;, who normally have essentially root privilege, may be unable to do this depending on the configuration chosen by the site.) While NEWP can be used to write general programs and has a number of features designed for large software projects, it does not support everything ALGOL does.

NEWP has a number of facilities to enable large-scale software projects, such as the operating system, including named interfaces (functions and data), groups of interfaces, modules, and super-modules. Modules group data and functions together, allowing easy access to the data as global within the module. Interfaces allow a module to import and export functions and data. Super-modules allow modules to be grouped.

===DCALGOL and Message Control Systems (MCS)===
In the original implementation, the system used an attached specialized data communications processor (DCP) to handle the input and output of messages from/to remote devices. This was a 24-bit minicomputer with a conventional register architecture and hardware I/O capability to handle thousands of remote terminals. The DCP and the B6500 communicated by messages in memory, essentially packets in today&#x27;s terms, and the MCS did the B6500-side processing of those messages. In the early years the DCP did have an assembler (Dacoma), an application program called DCPProgen written in B6500 ALGOL. Later the NDL (Network Definition Language) compiler generated the DCP code and NDF (network definition file). Ultimately, a further update resulted in the development of the NDLII language and compiler which were used in conjunction with the model 4 and 5 DCPs. There was one ALGOL function for each kind of DCP instruction, and if you called that function, then the corresponding DCP instruction bits would be emitted to the output. A DCP program was an ALGOL program comprising nothing but a long list of calls on these functions, one for each assembly language statement. Essentially ALGOL acted like the macro pass of a macro assembler. The first pass was the ALGOL compiler; the second pass was running the resulting program (on the B6500) which would then emit the binary for the DCP.

Starting in the early 1980&#x27;s, the DCP technology was replaced by the ICP (Integrated Communications Processor) which provided LAN based connectivity for the mainframe system. Remote devices, and remote servers/mainframes, were connected to the network via freestanding devices called CP2000s. The CP2000s were designed to provide network node support in a distributed network wherein the nodes were connected using the BNAV2 (Burroughs Network Architecture Version 2) networking technology. BNAV2 was a Burroughs functional equivalent of the IBM SNA product and did support interoperation with IBM environments in both PUT2 and PUT5 transport modes. The change in external datacommunications hardware did not require any change to existing MCS (Message Control System (discussed below)) software.

On input, messages were passed from the DCP via an internal bus to the relevant MCP Datacom Control (DCC) DCP process stack. One DCC process was initiated for each DCP configured on the system. The DCP Process stack would then ensure that the inbound message was queued for delivery to the MCS identified to handle traffic from the particular source device and return any response to the DCP for delivery to the destination device. From a processing perspective no changes were required to the MCS software to handle different types of gateway hardware, be it any of the 5 styles of DCP or the ICP or ICP/CP2000 combinations.

Apart from being a message delivery service, an MCS is an intermediate level of security between operating system code (in NEWP) and user programs (in ALGOL, or other application languages including COBOL, FORTRAN, and, in later days, JAVA). An MCS may be considered to be a middleware program and is written in DCALGOL (Data Communications ALGOL). As stated above, the MCS received messages from queues maintained by the Datacom Control Stack (DCC) and forwarded these messages to the appropriate application/function for processing. One of the original MCS&#x27;s was CANDE (Command AND Edit) which was developed as the online program development environment. The University of Otago in New Zealand developed a skinny program development environment equivalent to CANDE which they called SCREAM/6700 in the same time that IBM was offering a remote time-sharing/program development service known as CALL/360 which ran on IBM 360 series systems. Another MCS named COMS was introduced around 1984 and developed as a high performance transaction processing control system. There were predecessor transaction processing environments which included GEMCOS (GEneralized Message COntrol System), and an Australian Burroughs subsidiary developed MCS called TPMCS (Transaction Processing MCS). The transaction processing MCS&#x27;s supported the delivery of application data to online production environments and the return of responses to remote users/devices/systems. 

MCSs are items of software worth noting – they control user sessions and provide keeping track of user state without having to run per-user processes since a single MCS stack can be shared by many users. Load balancing can also be achieved at the MCS level. For example, saying that you want to handle 30 users per stack, in which case if you have 31 to 60 users, you have two stacks, 61 to 90 users, three stacks, etc. This gives B5000 machines a great performance advantage in a server since you don&#x27;t need to start up another user process and thus create a new stack each time a user attaches to the system. Thus you can efficiently service users (whether they require state or not) with MCSs. MCSs also provide the backbone of large-scale transaction processing.

Around 1988 an implementation of TCP/IP was developed principally for a U.S. government customer utilizing the CP2000 distributed communications processor as the protocol host. Two to three years later, the TCP/IP implementation was rewritten to be host/server based with significant performance and functionality improvements. In the same general time frame an implementation of the OSI protocol stacks was made, principally on the CP2000, but a large supporting infrastructure was implemented on the main system. All of the OSI standard defined applications were implemented including X.400 mail hosting and X.500 directory services.

===DMALGOL and databases===
Another variant of ALGOL is DMALGOL (Data Management ALGOL). DMALGOL is ALGOL extended for compiling the DMSII database software from database description files created by the DASDL (Data Access and Structure Definition Language) compiler. Database designers and administrators compile database descriptions to generate DMALGOL code tailored for the tables and indexes specified. Administrators never need to write DMALGOL themselves. Normal user-level programs obtain database access by using code written in application languages, mainly ALGOL and COBOL, extended with database instructions and transaction processing directives. The most notable feature of DMALGOL is its preprocessing mechanisms to generate code for handling tables and indices.

DMALGOL preprocessing includes variables and loops, and can generate names based on compile-time variables. This enables tailoring far beyond what can be done by preprocessing facilities which lack loops.

DMALGOL is used to provide tailored access routines for DMSII databases. After a database is defined using the Data Access and Structure Definition Language (DASDL), the schema is translated by the preprocessor into tailored DMALGOL access routines and then compiled.
This means that, unlike in other DBMS implementations, there is often no need for database-specific if/then/else code at run-time. In the 1970s, this &quot;tailoring&quot; was used very extensively to reduce the code footprint and execution time. It became much less used in later years, partly because low-level fine tuning for memory and speed became less critical, and partly because eliminating the preprocessing made coding simpler and thus enabled more important optimizations. 

An applications version of ALGOL to support the accessing of databases from application programs is called BDMSALGOL and included verbs like &quot;FIND&quot;, &quot;LOCK&quot;, &quot;STORE&quot;, &quot;GET&quot;, and &quot;PUT&quot; for database access and record manipulation. Additionally, the verbs &quot;BEGINTRANSACTION&quot; and &quot;ENDTRANSACTION&quot; were also implemented to solve the deadlock situation when multiple processes accessed and updated the same structures.

Roy Guck of Burroughs was one of the main developers of DMSII.

In later years, with compiler code size being less of a concern, most of the preprocessing constructs were made available in the user level of ALGOL. Only the unsafe constructs and the direct processing of the database description file remain restricted to DMALGOL.

==Stack architecture==
In many early systems and languages, programmers were often told not to make their routines too small. Procedure calls and returns were expensive, because a number of operations had to be performed to maintain the stack. The B5000 was designed as a stack machine – all program data except for arrays (which include strings and objects) was kept on the stack. This meant that stack operations were optimized for efficiency. As a stack-oriented machine, there are no programmer addressable registers.

Multitasking is also very efficient on the B5000 and B6500 lines. There are specific instruction to perform process switches: 
;B5000, B5500, B5700
:Initiate P1 (IP1) and Initiate P2 (IP2)
;B6500, B7500 and successors
:MVST (move stack). 
Each stack and associated Program Reference Table (PRT) represents a process (task or thread) and tasks can become blocked waiting on resource requests (which includes waiting for a processor to run on if the task has been interrupted because of preemptive multitasking). User programs cannot issue an IP1, IP2 or MVST, and there is only one place in the operating system where this is done.

So a process switch proceeds something like this – a process requests a resource that is not immediately available, maybe a read of a record of a file from a block which is not currently in memory, or the system timer has triggered an interrupt. The operating system code is entered and run on top of the user stack. It turns off user process timers. The current process is placed in the appropriate queue for the resource being requested, or the ready queue waiting for the processor if this is a preemptive context switch. The operating system determines the first process in the ready queue and invokes the instruction move_stack, which makes the process at the head of the ready queue active.

===Stack speed and performance===
Stack performance was considered to be slow compared to register-based architectures, for example, such an architecture had been considered and rejected for the System/360. One way to increase system speed is to keep data as close to the processor as possible. In the B5000 stack, this was done by assigning the top two positions of the stack to two registers A and B. Most operations are performed on those two top of stack positions. On faster machines past the B5000, more of the stack may be kept in registers or cache near the processor.

Thus the designers of the current successors to the B5000 systems can optimize in whatever is the latest technique, and programmers do not have to adjust their code for it to run faster – they do not even need to recompile, thus protecting software investment. Some programs have been known to run for years over many processor upgrades. Such speed up is limited on register-based machines.

Another point for speed as promoted by the RISC designers was that processor speed is considerably faster if everything is on a single chip. It was a valid point in the 1970s when more complex architectures such as the B5000 required too many transistors to fit on a single chip. However, this is not the case today and every B5000 successor machine now fits on a single chip as well as the performance support techniques such as caches and instruction pipelines.

In fact, the A Series line of B5000 successors included the first single chip mainframe, the Micro-A of the late 1980s. This &quot;mainframe&quot; chip (named SCAMP for Single-Chip A-series Mainframe Processor) sat on an Intel-based plug-in PC board.

=== How programs map to the stack ===

Here is an example of how programs map to the stack structure

 begin
 — This is lexical level 2 (level zero is reserved for the operating system and level 1 for code segments).
 
 — At level 2 we place global variables for our program.
 integer &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot;;
 real &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;;
 array &quot;a&quot; [0:9];
 procedure &quot;p&quot; (real &quot;p1&quot;, &quot;p2&quot;);
 value &quot;p1&quot;; — p1 passed by value, p2 implicitly passed by reference.
 begin
 — This block is at lexical level 3
 real &quot;r1&quot;, &quot;r2&quot;;
 &quot;r2&quot; := &quot;p1&quot; * &quot;5&quot;;
 &quot;p2&quot; := &quot;r2&quot;; — This sets &quot;g&quot; to the value of &quot;r2&quot;
 &quot;p1&quot; := &quot;r2&quot;; — This sets &quot;p1&quot; to &quot;r2&quot;, but not &quot;f&quot;
 — Since this overwrites the original value of &quot;f&quot; in &quot;p1&quot; it &quot;might&quot; be a
 — coding mistake. Some few of ALGOL&#x27;s successors therefore insist that
 — value parameters be read only – but most do not.
 if &quot;r2&quot; &gt; &quot;10&quot; then
 begin
 — A variable declared here makes this lexical level 4
 integer &quot;n&quot;;
 — The declaration of a variable makes this a block, which will invoke some
 — stack building code. Normally you won&#x27;t declare variables here, in which
 — case this would be a compound statement, not a block.
 ... &lt;== sample stack is executing somewhere here.
 end;
 end;
 ...
 &quot;p&quot; (&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;);
 end.

Each stack frame corresponds to a lexical level in the current execution environment. As you can see, lexical level is the static textual nesting of a program, not the dynamic call nesting. The visibility rules of ALGOL, a language designed for single pass compilers, mean that only variables declared before the current position are visible at that part of the code, thus the requirement for forward declarations. All variables declared in enclosing blocks are visible. Another case is that variables of the same name may be declared in inner blocks and these effectively hide the outer variables which become inaccessible.

Lexical nesting is static, unrelated to execution nesting with recursion, etc. so it is very rare to find a procedure nested more than five levels deep, and it could be argued that such programs would be poorly structured. B5000 machines allow nesting of up to 32 levels. This could cause difficulty for some systems that generated Algol source as output (tailored to solve some special problem) if the generation method frequently nested procedure within procedure.

=== Procedures ===
Procedures can be invoked in four ways – normal, call, process, and run.

The normal invocation invokes a procedure in the normal way any language invokes a routine, by suspending the calling routine until the invoked procedure returns.

The call mechanism invokes a procedure as a coroutine. Coroutines are partner tasks established as synchronous entities operating in their own stack at the same lexical level as the initiating process. Control is explicitly passed between the initiating process and the coroutine by means of a CONTINUE instruction. 

The process mechanism invokes a procedure as an asynchronous task with a separate stack set up starting at the lexical level of the processed procedure. As an asynchronous task, there is no control over exactly when control will be passed between the tasks, unlike coroutines. The processed procedure still has access to the enclosing environment and this is a very efficient IPC (Inter Process Communication) mechanism. Since two or more tasks now have access to common variables, the tasks must be synchronized to prevent race conditions, which is handled by the EVENT data type, where processes can WAIT on one, or more, events until it is caused by another cooperating process. EVENTs also allow for mutual exclusion synchronization through the PROCURE and LIBERATE functions. If for any reason the child task dies, the calling task can continue – however, if the parent process dies, then all child processes are automatically terminated. On a machine with more than one processor, the processes may run simultaneously. This EVENT mechanism is a basic enabler for multiprocessing in addition to multitasking.

==== Run invocation type ====

The last invocation type is run. This runs a procedure as an independent task which can continue on after the originating process terminates. For this reason, the child process cannot access variables in the parent&#x27;s environment, and all parameters passed to the invoked procedure must be call-by-value.

Thus, Burroughs Extended ALGOL had some of the multi-processing and synchronization features of later languages like Ada. It made use of the support for asynchronous processes that was built into the hardware.

==== Inline procedures ====

One last possibility is that in NEWP a procedure may be declared INLINE, that is when the compiler sees a reference to it the code for the procedure is generated inline to save the overhead of a procedure call; this is best done for small pieces of code. Inline functions are similar to parameterized macros such as C #defines, except you don&#x27;t get the problems with parameters that you can with macros. 

==== Asynchronous calls ====

In the example program only normal calls are used, so all the information will be on a single stack. For asynchronous calls, a separate stack is initiated for each asynchronous process so that the processes share data but run asynchronously.

==== Display registers ====

A stack hardware optimization is the provision of D (or &quot;display&quot;) registers. The D registers correspond to scope in source programs, that is nesting in the source. These are registers that point to the start of each called stack frame. These registers are updated automatically as procedures are entered and exited and are not accessible by any software other than the MCP. There are 32 D registers, which is what limits operations to 32 levels of lexical nesting.

Consider how we would access a lexical level 2 (D[2]) global variable from lexical level 5 (D[5]). Suppose the variable is 6 words away from the base of lexical level 2. It is thus represented by the address couple (2, 6). If we don&#x27;t have D registers, we have to look at the control word at the base of the D[5] frame, which points to the frame containing the D[4] environment. We then look at the control word at the base of this environment to find the D[3] environment, and continue in this fashion until we have followed all the links back to the required lexical level. This is not the same path as the return path back through the procedures which have been called in order to get to this point. (The architecture keeps both the data stack and the call stack in the same structure, but uses control words to tell them apart.)

As you can see, this is quite inefficient just to access a variable. With D registers, the D[2] register points at the base of the lexical level 2 environment, and all we need to do to generate the address of the variable is to add its offset from the stack frame base to the frame base address in the D register. (There is an efficient linked list search operator LLLU, which could search the stack in the above fashion, but the D register approach is still going to be faster.) With D registers, access to entities in outer and global environments is just as efficient as local variable access.

 |=======================| — Stack bottom

If we had invoked the procedure p as a coroutine, or a process instruction, the D[3] environment would have become a separate D[3]-based stack. This means that asynchronous processes still have access to the D[2] environment as implied in ALGOL program code. Taking this one step further, a totally different program could call another program&#x27;s code, creating a D[3] stack frame pointing to another process&#x27; D[2] environment on top of its own process stack. At an instant the whole address space from the code&#x27;s execution environment changes, making the D[2] environment on the own process stack not directly addressable and instead make the D[2] environment in another process stack directly addressable. This is how library calls are implemented. At such a cross-stack call, the calling code and called code could even originate from programs written in different source languages and be compiled by different compilers.

The D[1] and D[0] environments do not occur in the current process&#x27;s stack. The D[1] environment is the code segment dictionary, which is shared by all processes running the same code. The D[0] environment represents entities exported by the operating system.

Stack frames actually don&#x27;t even have to exist in a process stack. This feature was used early on for file I/O optimization, the FIB (file information block) was linked into the display registers at D[1] during I/O operations. In the early nineties, this ability was implemented as a language feature as STRUCTURE BLOCKs and – combined with library technology - as CONNECTION BLOCKs. The ability to link a data structure into the display register address scope implemented object orientation. Thus, the B6500 actually used a form of object orientation long before the term was ever used.

On other systems, the compiler might build its symbol table in a similar manner, but eventually the storage requirements would be collated and the machine code would be written to use flat memory addresses of 16-bits or 32-bits or even 64-bits. These addresses might contain anything so that a write to the wrong address could damage anything. Instead, the two-part address scheme was implemented by the hardware. At each lexical level, variables were placed at displacements up from the base of the level&#x27;s stack, typically occupying one word - double precision or complex variables would occupy two. Arrays were &quot;not&quot; stored in this area, only a one word descriptor for the array was. Thus, at each lexical level the total storage requirement was not great: dozens, hundreds or a few thousand in extreme cases, certainly not a count requiring 32-bits or more. And indeed, this was reflected in the form of the VALC instruction (value call) that loaded an operand onto the stack. This op-code was two bits long and the rest of the byte&#x27;s bits were concatenated with the following byte to give a fourteen-bit addressing field. The code being executed would be at some lexical level, say six: this meant that only lexical levels zero to six were valid, and so just three bits were needed to specify the lexical level desired. The address part of the VALC operation thus reserved just three bits for that purpose, with the remainder being available for referring to entities at that and lower levels. A deeply nested procedure (thus at a high lexical level) would have fewer bits available to identify entities: for level sixteen upwards five bits would be needed to specify the choice of levels 0–31 thus leaving nine bits to identify no more than the first 512 entities of any lexical level. This is much more compact than addressing entities by their literal memory address in a 32-bit addressing space. Further, only the VALC opcode loaded data: opcodes for ADD, MULT and so forth did no addressing, working entirely on the top elements of the stack.

Much more important is that this method meant that many errors possible on systems employing flat addressing could not occur because they were simply unspeakable even at the machine code level. A task had no way to corrupt memory in use by another task, because it had no way to develop its address. Offsets from a specified D-register would be checked by the hardware against the stack frame bound: rogue values would be trapped. Similarly, within a task, an array descriptor contained information on the array&#x27;s bounds, and so any indexing operation was checked by the hardware: put another way, each array formed its own address space. In any case, the tagging of all memory words provided a second level of protection: a misdirected assignment of a value could only go to a data-holding location, not to one holding a pointer or an array descriptor, etc. and certainly not to a location holding machine code.

====Array storage====
Arrays were not stored contiguous in memory with other variables, they were each granted their own address space, which was located via the descriptor. The access mechanism was to calculate on the stack the index variable (which therefore had the full integer range potential, not just fourteen bits) and use it as the offset into the array&#x27;s address space, with bound checking provided by the hardware. By default, should an array&#x27;s length exceed 1,024 words, the array would be segmented, and the index be converted into a segment index and an offset into the indexed segment. There was, however, the option to prevent segmentation by specifying the array as LONG in the declaration. In ALGOL&#x27;s case, a multidimensional array would employ multiple levels of such addressing. For a reference to A[i,j], the first index would be into an array of descriptors, one descriptor for each of the rows of A, which row would then be indexed with j as for a single-dimensional array, and so on for higher dimensions. Hardware checking against the known bounds of all the array&#x27;s indices would prevent erroneous indexing.

FORTRAN however regards all multidimensional arrays as being equivalent to a single-dimensional array of the same size, and for a multidimensional array simple integer arithmetic is used to calculate the offset where element A[i,j,k] would be found in that single sequence. The single-dimensional equivalent array, possibly segmented if large enough, would then be accessed in the same manner as a single-dimensional array in ALGOL. Although accessing outside this array would be prevented, a wrong value for one index combined with a suitably wrong value for another index might not result in a bounds violation of the single sequence array; in other words, the indices were not checked individually.

Because an array&#x27;s storage was not bounded on each side by storage for other items, it was easy for the system to &quot;resize&quot; an array - though changing the number of dimensions was precluded because compilers required all references to have the same number of dimensions. In ALGOL&#x27;s case, this enabled the development of &quot;ragged&quot; arrays, rather than the usual fixed rectangular (or higher dimension) arrays. Thus in two dimensions, a ragged array would have rows that were of different sizes. For instance, given a large array A[100,100] of mostly-zero values, a sparse array representation that was declared as SA[100,0] could have each row resized to have exactly enough elements to hold only the non-zero values of A along that row.

Because arrays larger than 1024 words were generally segmented but smaller arrays were not, on a system that was short of real memory, increasing the declared size of a collection of scratchpad arrays from 1,000 to say 1,050 could mean that the program would run with far less &quot;thrashing&quot; as only the smaller individual segments in use were needed in memory. Actual storage for an array segment would be allocated at run time only if an element in that segment were accessed, and all elements of a created segment would be initialised to zero. Not initialising an array to zero at the start therefore was encouraged by this, normally an unwise omission.

Array equivalencing is also supported. The ARRAY declaration requested allocation of 48-bit data words which could be used to store any bit pattern but the general operational practice was that each allocated word was considered to be a REAL operand. The declaration of:

 ARRAY A [0:99]

requested the allocation of 100 words of type REAL data space in memory. The programmer could also specify that the memory might be referred to as character oriented data by the following equivalence declaration:

 EBCDIC ARRAY EA [0] = A [*];

or as hexadecimal data via the equivalence declaration:

 HEX ARRAY HA [0] = A [*];

or as ASCII data via the equivalence declaration:

 ASCII ARRAY AA [0] = A[*];

The capability to request data type specific arrays without equivalencing is also supported, e.g.

 EBCDIC ARRAY MY_EA [0:99]

requested that the system allocated a 100 character array. Given that the architecture is word based, the actual space allocated is the requested number of characters rounded up to the next whole word boundary.

The Data Descriptor generated at compilation time indicated the data type usage for which the array was intended. If an array equivalence declaration was made a copy descriptor indicating that particular usage type was generated but pointed back to the original, or MOM, descriptor. Thus, indexing the correct location in memory was always guaranteed.

BOOLEAN arrays are also supported and may be used as a bit vector. INTEGER arrays may also be requested.

The immediately preceding discussion uses the ALGOL syntax implementation to describe ARRAY declarations, but the same functionality is supported in COBOL and FORTRAN.

=== Stack structure advantages ===

One nice thing about the stack structure is that if a program does happen to fail, a stack dump is taken and it is very easy for a programmer to find out exactly what the state of a running program was. Compare that to core dumps and exchange packages of other systems.

Another thing about the stack structure is that programs are implicitly recursive. FORTRAN was not expected to support recursion and perhaps one stumbling block to people&#x27;s understanding of how ALGOL was to be implemented was how to implement recursion. On the B5000, this was not a problem – in fact, they had the reverse problem, how to stop programs from being recursive. In the end they didn&#x27;t bother. The Burroughs FORTRAN compiler allowed recursive calls (just as every other FORTRAN compiler does), but unlike many other computers, on a stack-based system the returns from such calls succeeded as well. This could have odd effects, as with a system for the formal manipulation of mathematical expressions whose central subroutines repeatedly invoked each other without ever returning: large jobs were ended by stack overflow!

Thus Burroughs FORTRAN had better error checking than other contemporary implementation of FORTRAN. For instance, for subroutines and functions it checked that they were invoked with the correct number of parameters, as is normal for ALGOL-style compilers. On other computers, such mismatches were common causes of crashes. Similarly with the array-bound checking: programs that had been used for years on other systems embarrassingly often would fail when run on a Burroughs system. In fact, Burroughs became known for its superior compilers and implementation of languages, including the object-oriented Simula (a superset of ALGOL), and Iverson, the designer of APL declared that the Burroughs implementation of APL was the best he&#x27;d seen. John McCarthy, the language designer of LISP disagreed, since LISP was based on modifiable code, he did not like the unmodifiable code of the B5000, but most LISP implementations would run in an interpretive environment anyway.

The storage required for the multiple processes came from the system&#x27;s memory pool as needed. There was no need to do SYSGENs on Burroughs systems as with competing systems in order to preconfigure memory partitions in which to run tasks.

==Tagged architecture==
The most defining aspect of the B5000 is that it is a stack machine as treated above. However, two other very important features of the architecture is that it is tag-based and descriptor-based.

In the original B5000, a flag bit in each control or numeric word was set aside to identify the word as a control word or numeric word. This was partially a security mechanism to stop programs from being able to corrupt control words on the stack.

Later, when the B6500 was designed, it was realized that the 1-bit control word/numeric distinction was a powerful idea and this was extended to three bits outside of the 48 bit word into a tag. The data bits are bits 0–47 and the tag is in bits 48–50. Bit 48 was the read-only bit, thus odd tags indicated control words that could not be written by a user-level program. Code words were given tag 3. Here is a list of the tags and their function:

Internally, some of the machines had 60 bit words, with the extra bits being used for engineering purposes such as a Hamming code error-correction field, but these were never seen by programmers.

The current incarnation of these machines, the Unisys ClearPath has extended tags further into a four bit tag. The microcode level that specified four bit tags was referred to as level Gamma.

Even-tagged words are user data which can be modified by a user program as user state. Odd-tagged words are created and used directly by the hardware and represent a program&#x27;s execution state. Since these words are created and consumed by specific instructions or the hardware, the exact format of these words can change between hardware implementation and user programs do not need to be recompiled, since the same code stream will produce the same results, even though system word format may have changed.

Tag 1 words represent on-stack data addresses. The normal IRW simply stores an address couple to data on the current stack. The SIRW references data on any stack by including a stack number in the address. Amongst other things, SIRW&#x27;s are used to provide addressing between discrete process stacks such as those generated in response to the CALL and PROCESS statements.

Tag 5 words are descriptors, which are more fully described in the next section. Tag 5 words represent off-stack data addresses.

Tag 7 is the program control word which describes a procedure entry point. When hardware operators hit a PCW, the procedure is entered. The ENTR operator explicitly enters a procedure (non-value-returning routine). Functions (value-returning routines) are implicitly entered by operators such as value call (VALC). Global routines are stored in the D[2] environment as SIRWs that point to a PCW stored in the code segment dictionary in the D[1] environment. The D[1] environment is not stored on the current stack because it can be referenced by all processes sharing this code. Thus code is reentrant and shared.

Tag 3 represents code words themselves, which won&#x27;t occur on the stack. Tag 3 is also used for the stack control words MSCW, RCW, TOSCW.

==Descriptor-based architecture==

The figure to the left shows how the Burroughs Large System architecture was fundamentally a hardware architecture for object-oriented programming, something that still doesn&#x27;t exist in conventional architectures.

==Instruction sets==

There are three distinct instruction sets for the Burroughs large systems. All three are based on short syllables that fit evenly into words.

===B5000, B5500 and B5700===

Programs on a B5000, B5500 and B5700 are made up of 12-bit syllables, four to a word. 
The architecture has two modes, Word Mode and Character Mode, and each has a separate repertoire of syllables. A processor may be either Control State or Normal State, and certain syllables are only permissible in Control State. The architecture does not provide for addressing registers or storage directly; all references are through the 1024 word Program Reference Table, current code segment, marked locations within the stack or to the A and B registers holding the top two locations on the stack. Burroughs numbers bits in a syllable from 0 (high bit) to 11 (low bit)

===B6500 and successors===

Programs are made up of 8-bit syllables, which may be Name Call, Value Call, or form an operator, which may be from one to twelve syllables in length. There are less than 200 operators, all of which fit into 8-bit syllables. Many of these operators are polymorphic depending on the kind of data being acted on as given by the tag. If we ignore the powerful string scanning, transfer, and edit operators, the basic set is only about 120 operators. If we remove the operators reserved for the operating system such as MVST and HALT, the set of operators commonly used by user-level programs is less than 100. The Name Call and Value Call syllables contain address couples; the Operator syllables either use no addresses or use control words and descriptors on the stack.

==Multiple processors==
The B5000 line also were pioneers in having two processors connected together on a high-speed bus as master and slave. In the B6000, B7000 and B8000 lines the processors were symmetric. The B7000 line could have up to eight processors, as long as at least one was an I/O module. RDLK (ReaD with LocK) is a very low-level way of synchronizing between processors. RDLK operates in a single cycle. The higher level mechanism generally employed by user programs is the EVENT data type. The EVENT data type did have some system overhead. To avoid this overhead, a special locking technique called Dahm locks (named after a Burroughs software guru, Dave Dahm) can be used. Dahm locks used the READLOCK ALGOL language statement which generated a RDLK operator at the code level.

Notable operators are:

HEYU — send an interrupt to another processor
RDLK — Low-level semaphore operator: Load the A register with the memory location given by the A register and place the value in the B register at that memory location in a single uninterruptible cycle. The Algol compiler produced code to invoke this operator via a special function that enabled a &quot;swap&quot; operation on single-word data without an explicit temporary value. codice_1
WHOI — Processor identification
IDLE — Idle until an interrupt is received

Two processors could infrequently simultaneously send each other a &#x27;HEYU&#x27; command resulting in a lockup known as &#x27;a deadly embrace&#x27;.

==Influence of the B5000==
The direct influence of the B5000 can be seen in the current Unisys ClearPath range of mainframes which are the direct descendants of the B6500, which was influenced by the B5000, and still have the MCP operating system after 40 years of consistent development. This architecture is now called emode (for emulation mode) since the B6500 architecture has been implemented on machines built from Intel Xeon processors running the x86 instruction set as the native instruction set, with code running on those processors emulating the B5000 instruction set. In those machines, there was also going to be an nmode (native mode), but this was dropped, so you may often hear the B6500 successor machines being referred to as &quot;emode machines&quot;.

B5000 machines were programmed exclusively in high-level languages; there is no assembler.

The B5000 stack architecture inspired Chuck Moore, the designer of the programming language Forth, who encountered the B5500 while at MIT. In &quot;Forth - The Early Years&quot;, Moore described the influence, noting that Forth&#x27;s DUP, DROP and SWAP came from the corresponding B5500 instructions (DUPL, DLET, EXCH).

B5000 machines with their stack-based architecture and tagged memory also heavily influenced the Soviet Elbrus series of mainframes and supercomputers. The first two generations of the series featured tagged memory and stack-based CPUs that were programmed only in high-level languages. There existed a kind of an assembly language for them, called El-76, but it was more or less a modification of ALGOL 68 and supported structured programming and first-class procedures. Later generations of the series, though, switched away from this architecture to the EPIC-like VLIW CPUs.

The Hewlett-Packard designers of the HP 3000 business system had used a B5500 and were greatly impressed by its hardware and software; they aimed to build a 16-bit minicomputer with similar software. Several other HP divisions created similar minicomputer or microprocessor stack machines. Bob Barton&#x27;s work on reverse Polish notation (RPN) also found its way into HP calculators beginning with the 9100A, and notably the HP-35 and subsequent calculators.

The NonStop systems designed by Tandem Computers in the late 1970s and early 1980s were also 16-bit stack machines, influenced by the B5000 indirectly through the HP 3000 connection, as several of the early Tandem engineers were formerly with HP. Around 1990, these systems migrated to MIPS RISC architecture but continued to support execution of stack machine binaries by object code translation or direct emulation. Sometime after 2000, these systems migrated to Itanium architecture and continued to run the legacy stack machine binaries.

Bob Barton was also very influential on Alan Kay. Kay was also impressed by the data-driven tagged architecture of the B5000 and this influenced his thinking in his developments in object-oriented programming and Smalltalk.

Another facet of the B5000 architecture was that it was a secure architecture that runs directly on hardware. This technique has descendants in the virtual machines of today in their attempts to provide secure environments. One notable such product is the Java JVM which provides a secure sandbox in which applications run.

The value of the hardware-architecture binding that existed before emode would be substantially preserved in the x86-based machines to the extent that MCP was the one and only control program, but the support provided by those machines is still inferior to that provided on the machines where the B6500 instruction set is the native instruction set. A little-known Intel processor architecture that actually preceded 32-bit implementations of the x86 instruction set, the Intel iAPX 432, &quot;would&quot; have provided an equivalent physical basis, as it too was essentially an object-oriented architecture.

<text>Walla Walla (), Walawalałáma (&quot;People of Walula region along Walla Walla River&quot;), sometimes Walúulapam, are a Sahaptin Indigenous people of the Northwest Plateau. The duplication in their name expresses the diminutive form. The name &quot;Walla Walla&quot; is translated several ways but most often as &quot;many waters&quot;.

Many of the Walla Walla live on the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. They share land and a governmental structure with the Cayuse and the Umatilla tribes as part of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla. The reservation is located in the area of Pendleton, Oregon, United States, near the Blue Mountains. Some Walla Walla are also enrolled in the federally recognized Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation.

==History==
The people are a Sahaptin-speaking tribe that traditionally inhabited the interior Columbia River region of the present-day northwestern United States. For centuries before the coming of European settlers, the Walla Walla, consisting of three principal bands, occupied the territory along the Walla Walla River (named for them) and along the confluence of the Snake and Columbia River rivers in a territory that is now part of northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington states. From this zone, the Walla Walla followed a pattern of seasonal subsistence practices similar to that of the Yakama, Palouse, Umatilla, and Wanapum tribes.

===Contact with Europeans===
The first encounter with Euro-Americans for the Walla Walla was the Lewis and Clark Expedition. At the first meeting in 1805, the Americans promised Walla Walla chief Yellepit that they would visit with the people after seeing the Pacific Ocean. The party returned in April 1806 and stayed at Yellepit&#x27;s village, located on the Columbia River near the mouth of the Walla Walla River. During a transaction Yellepit presented Clark with a white horse in return for a copper kettle. The Americans had none in supply, however, so Clark gave Yellepit his own sword, along with a quantity of gunpowder and musket balls. Lewis and Clark also gave Yellepit a peace medal engraved with a portrait of President Thomas Jefferson, to be worn around the neck, and a small United States flag. Yellepit, Washington was later named after the chief.

David Thompson of the Canadian-British North West Company (NWC) was the next European in the Walla Walla lands, arriving in 1811. About five miles upriver from Yellepit&#x27;s village on the confluence of the Snake River and the Columbia, Thompson ordered a pole be placed. An attached letter to the pole claimed the territory for the British Crown and stated the NWC intended to build a trading post at the site. Thompson&#x27;s pole and letter were intended for the traders of the Pacific Fur Company, an American rival of the NWC. Continuing downriver, Thompson stopped at Yellepit&#x27;s village and discovered the flag and medal left by the Americans. Thompson found Yellepit very friendly and intelligent, and the chief encouraged the plan to set up a nearby trading post. 

For various reasons the post was not built until 1818, when the NWC established Fort Nez Perces at the mouth of the Walla Walla River. During the summer of 1811, Thompson had met also with the Walla Walla head chief, Tumatapum, and his equal-ranking Quillquills Tuckapesten, Nimipu head chief; Ollicott, Cayuse head chief; and, probably, Kepowhan, Palus head chief; and Illim-Spokanee, Spokane head chief.

The Walla Walla eventually adopted the practice of maintaining cattle herds. They were known to go to New Helvetia in California during 1844 to secure additional livestock. An estimated 40 Walla Walla, Nez Perce and Cayuse under Walla Walla chief Piupiumaksmaks went on the expedition south. En route the party gathered stray horses, not aware the strays were stolen. 

Negotiations at New Helvetia were held between one of Piupiumaksmaks&#x27; sons, Toayahnu, and an employee of Sutter. The two men entered a dispute, and Toayahnu was killed. Despite fears of retribution among Sutter&#x27;s staff by the Walla Walla, Piupiumaksmaks returned with a small band of warriors and families in 1846 and declared peaceable intentions. When that party returned to the northern territory, they found that some members had been infected with measles, to which the Native Americans had no immunity. An epidemic began to spread across the Columbia Plateau, decimating indigenous populations. Smallpox and other diseases were also introduced into the area, adding to the Walla Walla population decline. Despite this, the Walla Walla still held extensive herds of horses, which constituted the &quot;principal wealth&quot; of the tribe.

The Walla Walla were one of the tribal nations at the 1855 Walla Walla Council (along with the Cayuse, Nez Perce, Umatilla, and Yakama), which signed the Treaty of Walla Walla.

==Notable Walla Walla ==
* Piupiumaksmaks (Yellow Hawk) (d. 1855), head chieftain of Walla Wallas
* James Lavadour (b. 1951), painter and printmaker 
* Dan Henderson (b. 1970), Olympic wrestler and mixed martial artist
* Charles Sams (b. circa 1970), director of the U. S. National Park Service (2021 to present)

<text>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. was an American television and media conglomerate founded by Ted Turner in 1965. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, it merged with Time Warner (later WarnerMedia) on October 10, 1996. As of April 2022, all of its assets are now owned by Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). The headquarters of Turner&#x27;s properties were largely located at the CNN Center in Downtown Atlanta, and the Turner Broadcasting campus off Techwood Drive in Midtown Atlanta, which also houses Techwood Studios. Some of their operations were housed within WBD&#x27;s corporate and global headquarters inside 30 Hudson Yards in Manhattan&#x27;s West Side district, and at 230 Park Avenue South in Midtown Manhattan, both in New York City, respectively.

Turner was known for several pioneering innovations in U.S. multichannel television, including its satellite uplink of local Atlanta independent station WTCG channel 17 as TBS—one of the first national &quot;superstations&quot;, and its establishment of the Cable News Network (CNN)—the first 24-hour news channel. It later launched a sister cable network, TNT; the professional wrestling promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the animation-centered Cartoon Network (which later spawned an adult-oriented night-time sister network in the form of Adult Swim, as well as the classic-cartoon channel Boomerang), and the classic-movie channel Turner Classic Movies (TCM). Turner South—a network devoted to regional sports and southern lifestyle programming—was launched by Turner in 1999, but was later sold to Fox Sports Networks in 2006 to form SportSouth. The same year, it acquired Liberty Media&#x27;s stake in their joint venture Court TV. WCW assets were later sold to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 2001.

On June 14, 2018, Time Warner, including Turner Broadcasting System, was acquired by telecom firm AT&amp;T and re-branded WarnerMedia. After the purchase, &quot;Turner&quot; was phased out as a corporate brand, and its properties were dispersed into either WarnerMedia Entertainment (TBS, TNT, and TruTV), WarnerMedia News &amp; Sports (CNN, Turner Sports, and AT&amp;T SportsNet), or brought directly under Warner Bros. (Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and Turner Classic Movies). On August 10, 2020, the WarnerMedia Entertainment and Warner Bros. Entertainment assets were merged to form WarnerMedia Studios &amp; Networks Group.

As of 2020, AT&amp;T reported the financial results for WarnerMedia&#x27;s ad-supported cable networks under the Turner business unit, while also using the term &quot;the TNets&quot; to refer to the group of TBS, TNT, and TruTV in press releases. On April 8, 2022, WarnerMedia merged with Discovery, Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery, and almost all of both companies&#x27; ad-supported cable networks were brought under the unit Warner Bros. Discovery U.S. Networks.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Turner Broadcasting System traces its roots to a billboard company in Savannah, Georgia, purchased by Robert Edward Turner II in the late 1940s. Turner grew the business, which later became known as Turner Advertising Company. Robert Edward Turner&#x27;s son, Ted Turner, inherited the company when the elder Turner died in 1963. After taking over the company, Ted Turner expanded the business into radio and television.

Turner Broadcasting System was incorporated in Georgia on May 12, 1965.

=== 1970s ===
In 1970, Ted Turner purchased WJRJ-Atlanta, Channel 17, a small, Ultra High Frequency (UHF) station, and renamed it WTCG, for parent company Turner Communications Group. During December 1976, WTCG originated the superstation concept, transmitting via satellite to cable systems.

HBO had gone to satellite transmissions to distribute its signal nationally in 1975, but that was a service that cable subscribers were made to pay extra to receive. Turner&#x27;s innovation signaled the start of the basic cable revolution.

On December 17, 1976, at 1:00 pm, WTCG Channel 17&#x27;s signal was beamed via satellite to its four cable systems in Grand Island, Nebraska; Newport News, Virginia; Troy, Alabama; and Newton, Kansas. All four cable systems started receiving the 1948 Dana Andrews – Cesar Romero film &quot;Deep Waters&quot; already in progress. The movie had started 30 minutes earlier. WTCG went from being a little television station to a major TV network that every one of the 24,000 households outside of the 675,000 in Atlanta was receiving coast-to-coast. WTCG became what Turner labeled a superstation, the forerunner of today&#x27;s basic cable television.

In 1979, the company changed its name from Turner Communications Group to Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (TBS, Inc.) and the call letters of its main entertainment channel to WTBS.

=== 1980s ===
On June 1, 1980, Cable News Network (CNN) was launched at 5:00 p.m. EDT becoming the first 24-hour news cable channel. The husband and wife team of Dave Walker and Lois Hart news anchored the first newscast. Burt Reinhardt, then executive vice president of CNN, hired most of the channel&#x27;s first 200 employees and 25-member staff including Bernard Shaw, the network&#x27;s first news anchor.

In 1981, Turner Broadcasting System acquired Brut Productions from Faberge Inc.

Also in 1981, WTBS began its usage of &quot;Turner Time&quot; in June 1981, in which programming began at five minutes after the top and bottom of each hour, instead of the broadcasting norm of beginning at the top and bottom of the hour.

In 1984, Turner initiated Cable Music Channel, his competition for WASEC&#x27;s MTV. The channel was short-lived, but helped influence the original format of VH1.

In 1986, after a failed attempt to acquire CBS, Turner purchased the film studio MGM/UA Entertainment Co. from Kirk Kerkorian for $1.5 billion. Following the acquisition, Turner had an enormous debt and sold parts of the acquisition. MGM/UA Entertainment was sold back to Kirk Kerkorian. The MGM/UA Studio lot in Culver City was sold to Lorimar-Telepictures. Turner kept MGM&#x27;s pre-May 1986 film and television library as well as the Associated Artists Productions library (the pre-1950 Warner Bros. film library and the Fleischer Studios/Famous Studios &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons originally released by Paramount Pictures), and the U.S./Canadian distribution rights to the RKO Pictures library. Turner Entertainment Co. was founded on August 2, 1986.

Turner Program Services (&quot;TPS&quot;), a subsidiary under the Turner umbrella, began domestic syndication of all of the properties acquired under the final disposition of the MGM deal with Kerkorian. TPS inherited over 5,000 program orders (executed, letters of intent) to have domestic syndication agreements prepared and sent in order to &quot;formally&quot; contractually license films for airing on domestic, free-over-the-air television stations throughout the United States. The contractual &quot;back-log&quot; was caught up by the end of 1989, while still administering to all of a domestic television station&#x27;s syndication needs. In 1987, top-rated television network NBC was considered bidding for a piece of the company in an effort to enter the cable business, but the deal was never materialized.

In 1989, TBS Management Company, under the leadership of Charles Shultz (Ted&#x27;s first company controller at the original, small TV station), advanced the focus on the two music performing rights subsidiaries: one with Broadcast Music, Inc (&quot;BMI&quot;) and ASCAP. In the space of 1989 to 1994, Turner went from 2 subsidiary music publishing companies to no less than sixteen.

On October 3, 1988, the company launched Turner Network Television (TNT).

=== 1990s ===
Turner Broadcasting System expanded its presence in movie production and distribution, first with the 1991 purchase of the Hanna-Barbera and Ruby-Spears animation studios during a competitive bid with MCA/Universal, Hallmark Cards, and several other corporations. On December 22, 1993, Turner Broadcasting System acquired Castle Rock Entertainment. Turner Broadcasting System purchased New Line Cinema a month later.

Turner Broadcasting System launched Cartoon Network on October 1, 1992, followed by Turner Classic Movies (TCM) on April 14, 1994.

In September 1995, Turner Broadcasting System began airing World Championship Wrestling (WCW)&#x27;s &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; on TNT, beginning the Monday Night War against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF)&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. Three years later, TBS Superstation began airing &quot;WCW Thunder&quot;.

On October 10, 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner Entertainment, a company formed in 1990 by the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications, and which had held 20% of Turner Broadcasting System in the past. Through this merger, Warner Bros. had regained the rights to its pre-1950 library, while Turner Broadcasting System gained access to the company&#x27;s post-1950 library and other properties.

=== 2000s ===
On April 1, 2000, Turner Broadcasting System launched Boomerang as a sister channel to Cartoon Network featuring the classic cartoons that originally aired on Cartoon Network as the channel was gradually shifting its focus to original cartoons.

Time Warner Entertainment merged with America Online (AOL) in 2001 to form AOL Time Warner, which was renamed back to the Time Warner name in 2004.

In March 2001, Jamie Kellner would officially succeed Ted Turner as head of Turner Broadcasting System. One of Kellner&#x27;s most notable actions after succeeding Turner was his decision to cancel WCW&#x27;s television programs.

In September 2001, Cartoon Network launched Adult Swim as an adult-oriented programming block that would air at midnight when Cartoon Network&#x27;s target demographic would be asleep. It would go on to be very successful. Since 2005, Adult Swim is considered its own network according to Nielsen due to Adult Swim and Cartoon Network&#x27;s differing demographics.

In 2002, Turner started a joint venture with Zee Entertainment Enterprises known as Zee Turner for distribution of their channels in India.

In 2003, Philip I. Kent succeeded Jamie Kellner as chairman. Operational duties for The WB were transferred by Time Warner from Warner Bros. to Turner Broadcasting during 2001, while Kellner was chairman, but were returned to Warner Bros. in 2003 with the departure of Kellner.

On January 1, 2004, Turner launched Pogo in India as a sister channel to Cartoon Network India. The channel is exclusive to South Asia.

On February 23, 2006, Turner agreed to sell the regional entertainment channel Turner South to Fox Entertainment Group. Fox assumed control of the channel on May 1, and on October 13 relaunched it as SportSouth – coincidentally, the former name of Fox Sports South when Turner owned this channel in partnership with Liberty Media between 1990 and 1996.

In May 2006, Time Warner, which had owned 50% of Court TV since 1998, purchased the remaining 50% from Liberty Media and began running the channel as part of Turner Broadcasting. The channel was relaunched as TruTV on January 1, 2008.

Also in May 2006, Ted Turner attended his last meeting as a board member of Time Warner and officially parted with the company.

On October 5, 2007, Turner Broadcasting System completed the acquisition of Claxson Interactive Pay Television Networks in Latin America.

On March 2, 2009, Turner launched Real, the company&#x27;s first Hindi GEC, in India as a joint venture between it and Alva Brothers Entertainment, which it had partnered with before for content on Cartoon Network India and Pogo TV. The joint venture was known as Real Global Broadcasting. The channel shut down in March 2010, lasting for a year due to low viewership.

On December 8, 2009, it was announced that Turner had bought a majority stake in NDTV Imagine Ltd. from NDTV, for $117 million, as the company&#x27;s own channel, Real had failed. NDTV Imagine Ltd. was previously a joint venture between NDTV and NBCUniversal. Turner then went on to acquire 92% of NDTV Imagine Ltd. which included NDTV Imagine, NDTV Lumiere, Imagine Showbiz and NDTV Imagine Pictures. Turner dropped the NDTV branding from the channels. Turner sold Imagine Showbiz to Reliance Broadcast Network in 2011.

=== 2010s ===
On August 26, 2010, Turner Broadcasting took full control of Chilevisión, a television channel owned by the President of Chile Sebastián Piñera.

On September 8, 2011, Turner Broadcasting System acquired LazyTown Entertainment, the producer of the TV series &quot;LazyTown&quot;.

On April 12, 2012, it was announced that Turner would shut down Imagine TV, formerly NDTV Imagine, as the channel struggled for ratings amidst competition from rival Hindi entertainment channels. By 12 May 2012, Imagine TV was shut down in India. Lumiere Movies, formerly NDTV Lumiere, was shut down in July along with TCM India.

On January 1, 2014, John K. Martin succeeded Phil Kent as chairman and CEO of Turner Broadcasting.

In August 2014, &quot;The Wrap&quot; reported that Turner was preparing to offer buy-outs to 550 employees as part of plans to restructure the company heading into 2015. The ratings performance of CNN and HLN were cited as a factor, while &quot;CBSSports.com&quot; reported that the rising rights fees Turner pays for its NBA broadcasts on TNT may have also been a factor. It was further reported in October 2014 that the company planned to reduce its workforce by 10% (1,475 people) through layoffs across a wide set of units including corporate positions.

On August 14, 2015, it was announced that Turner Broadcasting had acquired a majority stake in iStreamPlanet, a Las Vegas-based video streaming services company, in an effort to bolster its over-the-top programming and shift its core technology infrastructure to the cloud. iStreamPlanet is a direct competitor of Major League Baseball Advanced Media. The deal was reported to be in the neighborhood of $200 million. In October 2015, Turner launched a streaming-video network named Great Big Story.

In April 2017, in order to expedite the sale of Time Warner to AT&amp;T by shedding FCC-licensed properties, WPCH-TV was sold to Meredith Corporation, which had already been operating WPCH under a local marketing agreement since 2011 as a sister to its local CBS affiliate WGCL-TV. Turner Podcast Network was formed within Turner&#x27;s content distribution division in June 2017, with Tyler Moody being named general manager and vice president of the unit.

On March 22, 2018, Six Flags and Riverside Group announced a partnership with Turner Asia Pacific to bring attractions based on Tuzki and other Turner-owned IPs to its theme parks in China.

On June 15, 2018, it was announced that John Martin would be leaving as CEO following AT&amp;T&#x27;s completed acquisition of Time Warner. By September, AT&amp;T had transferred its Audience channel, a group of regional sports networks plus stakes in Game Show Network and MLB Network to Turner from AT&amp;T Communications.

In December 2018, Turner Broadcasting sold the rights to the brand and its pre-2008 original programming library of defunct cable network Court TV (which relaunched as truTV in 2008) to Katz Broadcasting, with plans to re-launch it as an over-the-air digital network in May 2019.

On March 4, 2019, AT&amp;T announced a major reorganization of its broadcasting assets to effectively dissolve Turner Broadcasting System. Its assets are to be dispersed across multiple units of WarnerMedia, including the newly created WarnerMedia Entertainment and WarnerMedia News &amp; Sports. WarnerMedia Entertainment would consist of HBO, TBS, TNT, TruTV, and an upcoming direct-to-consumer video service (led by former NBC entertainment chief Robert Greenblatt), while WarnerMedia News &amp; Sports would consist of CNN, Turner Sports, and the AT&amp;T SportsNet regional networks (which would be led by CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker). Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Boomerang, and Turner Classic Movies would be moved under Warner Bros. Entertainment via the new &quot;Global Kids &amp; Young Adults&quot; business unit. Although AT&amp;T did not specify any timetable for the changes, WarnerMedia had already begun to remove references to Turner Broadcasting in corporate communications, with press releases referring to its networks as being &quot;divisions of WarnerMedia&quot;. However, the Turner logo was still used at its building in Atlanta, Georgia even after the company&#x27;s dissolution in March 2019 until it was removed in October 2019.

=== 2020s ===
On August 10, 2020, WarnerMedia restructured several of its units in a major corporate revamp that resulted in TBS, TNT and TruTV being brought back under the same umbrella as Cartoon Network/Adult Swim, Boomerang and TCM, under a consolidation of WarnerMedia Entertainment and Warner Bros. Entertainment&#x27;s respective assets that formed the combined WarnerMedia Studios &amp; Networks Group unit. Casey Bloys—who has been with WarnerMedia since 2004 (as director of development at HBO Independent Productions), and was eventually elevated to President of Programming at HBO and Cinemax in May 2016—added oversight of WarnerMedia&#x27;s basic cable networks and HBO Max to his purview. Turner was subsequently reincorporated in Delaware on December 30.

On April 8, 2022, WarnerMedia was divested by AT&amp;T and merged with Discovery, Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). All linear networks owned by the company, besides CNN, Turner Sports, HBO, and Magnolia Network, are overseen by Kathleen Finch as head of Warner Bros. Discovery U.S. Networks, which resulted in Brett Weitz being removed as general manager of TBS, TNT, and TruTV after 14 years with the networks. The News and Sports division was also split up into separate CNN Worldwide and Warner Bros. Discovery Sports divisions, with the latter being renamed to TNT Sports in 2023 but also including Discovery&#x27;s sports properties such as Eurosport.

<doc id="332702" wikidata="Q918397" url="?curid=332702" title="1945 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The 1945 United Kingdom general election took place on Thursday 5 July 1945. With the war still fresh in voters’ minds, the opposition Labour Party under the leadership of Clement Attlee won a landslide victory with a majority of 146 seats, defeating the incumbent Conservative-led government under Prime Minister Winston Churchill amidst growing concerns by the public over the future of the United Kingdom in the post-war period.

The election&#x27;s campaigning was focused on leadership of the country and its postwar future. Churchill sought to use his wartime popularity as part of his campaign to keep the Conservatives in power after a wartime coalition had been in place since 1940 with the other political parties, but he faced questions from public opinion surrounding the Conservatives&#x27; actions in the 1930s and his ability to handle domestic issues unrelated to warfare. Clement Attlee, leader of the Labour Party, had been Deputy Prime Minister in the wartime coalition in 1940–1945 and was seen as a more competent leader by voters, particularly those who feared a return to the levels of unemployment in the 1930s and who sought a strong figurehead in British politics to lead the postwar rebuilding of the country. Opinion polls when the election was called showed strong approval ratings for Churchill, but Labour had gradually gained support for months before the war&#x27;s conclusion.

The final result of the election showed that Labour won a landslide victory, making a net gain of 239 seats, winning 49.7% of the popular vote and achieving a majority of 146 seats, thus allowing Attlee to be appointed prime minister. This election marked the first time that the Labour Party had won an outright majority in Parliament, and allowed Attlee to begin implementing the party&#x27;s post-war reforms for the country. For the Conservatives, the Labour victory was a shock, as they suffered a net loss of 189 seats although they won 36.2% of the vote and had campaigned on the mistaken belief that Churchill would win as people praised his leadership during the war. Of the other two major parties, the Liberal Party faced a serious blow after taking a net loss of nine seats with a vote share of 9.0%, many within urban areas and including the seat held by its leader, Archibald Sinclair. The Liberal National Party fared significantly worse, enduring a net loss of 22 seats with a vote share of 2.9%, with its leader Ernest Brown losing his seat. 324 MPs were elected for the first time, which would remain the record turnover of MPs until 2024.

The 10.7% swing from the Conservatives to an opposition party is the largest since the Acts of Union 1800; the Conservative loss of the vote exceeded that of the 1906 Liberal landslide ousting of a Conservative administration. It was also the first election since 1906 in which the Conservatives did not win a plurality of the popular vote. Churchill remained actively involved in politics and returned as prime minister after leading his party into the 1951 general election. For the Liberal National Party the election was their last as a distinct party, as they merged with the Conservatives in 1947 while Ernest Brown resigned from politics in the aftermath of the election.

==Dissolution of Parliament and campaign==

Held less than two months following VE Day, this was the first general election since 1935, as general elections had been suspended by Parliament during the Second World War. Clement Attlee, the leader of the Labour Party, refused Winston Churchill&#x27;s offer of continuing the wartime coalition until the Allied defeat of Japan. On 15 June, King George VI dissolved Parliament, which had been sitting for nearly ten years without an election.

The Labour manifesto, &quot;Let Us Face the Future&quot;, included promises of nationalisation, economic planning, full employment, a National Health Service, and a system of social security. The manifesto proved popular with the electorate, selling one and a half million copies. The Conservative manifesto, &quot;Mr. Churchill&#x27;s Declaration to the Voters&quot;, on the other hand, included progressive ideas on key social issues but was relatively vague on the idea of postwar economic control, and the party was associated with high levels of unemployment in the 1930s. It failed to convince voters that it could effectively deal with unemployment in a postwar Britain. In May 1945, when the war in Europe ended, Churchill&#x27;s approval ratings stood at 83%, but the Labour Party had held an 18% poll lead as of February 1945.

The polls for some seats were delayed until 12 July and in Nelson and Colne until 19 July because of local wakes weeks. The results were counted and declared on 26 July to allow time to transport the votes of those serving overseas. Victory over Japan Day ensued on 15 August.

==Outcome==
The caretaker government, led by Churchill, was heavily defeated. The Labour Party led by Attlee won a landslide victory and gained a majority of 146 seats. It was the first election in which Labour gained a majority of seats and the first in which it won a plurality of votes.

The election was a disaster for the Liberal Party, which lost all of its urban seats, and marked its transition from being a party of government to a party of the political fringe. Its leader, Archibald Sinclair, lost his rural seat of Caithness and Sutherland. That was the last general election until 2019 in which a major party leader lost their seat, but Sinclair lost only by a handful of votes in a very tight three-way contest.

The Liberal National Party fared even worse by losing two-thirds of its seats and falling behind the Liberals in seat count for the first time since the parties split in 1931. It was the final election that the Liberal Nationals fought as an autonomous party, as they merged with the Conservative Party two years later although they continued to exist as a subsidiary party of the Conservatives until 1968.

Future prominent figures who entered Parliament included Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Barbara Castle, Michael Foot and Hugh Gaitskell. Future Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan lost his seat, but he returned to Parliament at a by-election later that year.

===Reasons for Labour victory===

Ralph Ingersoll reported in late 1940:
The historian Henry Pelling, noting that polls showed a steady Labour lead after 1942, pointed to long-term forces that caused the Labour landslide: the usual swing against the party in power, the Conservative loss of initiative, wide fears of a return to the high unemployment of the 1930s, the theme that socialist planning would be more efficient in operating the economy, and the mistaken belief that Churchill would continue as prime minister regardless of the result.

====Labour strengths====

The greatest factor in Labour&#x27;s dramatic win appeared to be its policy of social reform. In one opinion poll, 41% of respondents considered housing to be the most important issue that faced the country, 15% stated the Labour policy of full employment, 7% mentioned social security, 6% nationalisation, and just 5% international security, which was emphasised by the Conservatives.

The Beveridge Report, published in 1942, proposed the creation of a welfare state. It called for a dramatic turn in British social policy, with provision for nationalised healthcare, expansion of state-funded education, National Insurance and a new housing policy. The report was extremely popular, and copies of its findings were widely purchased, turning it into a best-seller. The Labour Party adopted the report eagerly, and the Conservatives (including Churchill, who did not regard the reforms as socialist) accepted many of the principles of the report, but claimed that they were not affordable. Labour offered a new comprehensive welfare policy, reflecting a consensus that social changes were needed. The Conservatives were not willing to make the same changes that Labour proposed, and appeared out of step with public opinion.

Labour played to the concept of &quot;winning the peace&quot; that would follow the war. Possibly for that reason, there was especially strong support for Labour in the armed services, which feared the unemployment and homelessness to which the soldiers of the First World War had returned. It has been claimed that the left-wing bias of teachers in the armed services was a contributing factor, but that argument has generally not carried much weight, and the failure of the Conservative governments in the 1920s to deliver a &quot;land fit for heroes&quot; was likely more important.

Labour had also been given during the war the opportunity to display to the electorate its domestic competence in government, under men such as Attlee as Deputy Prime Minister, Herbert Morrison at the Home Office and Ernest Bevin at the Ministry of Labour. The differing wartime strategies of the two parties likewise gave Labour an advantage. Labour continued to attack prewar Conservative governments for their inactivity in tackling Hitler, reviving the economy and rearming Britain, but Churchill was less interested in furthering his party, much to the chagrin of many of its members and MPs.

====Conservative weaknesses====
Though voters respected and liked Churchill&#x27;s wartime record, they were more distrustful of the Conservative Party&#x27;s domestic and foreign policy record in the late 1930s. Churchill and the Conservatives are also generally considered to have run a poor campaign in comparison to Labour. Churchill&#x27;s personal popularity remained high; hence, the Conservatives were confident of victory and based much of their election campaign on that, rather than proposing new programmes. However, people distinguished between Churchill and his party, a contrast that Labour repeatedly emphasised throughout the campaign. Voters also harboured doubts over Churchill&#x27;s ability to lead the country on the domestic front. The writer and soldier Anthony Burgess remarked that Churchill, who then often wore a colonel&#x27;s uniform, was not nearly as popular with soldiers at the front as with officers and civilians. Burgess noted that Churchill often smoked cigars in front of soldiers who had not had a decent cigarette in days.

In addition to the poor Conservative general election strategy, Churchill went so far as to accuse Attlee of seeking to behave as a dictator, despite Attlee&#x27;s service as part of Churchill&#x27;s war cabinet. In the most famous incident of the campaign, Churchill&#x27;s first election broadcast on 4 June backfired dramatically and memorably. Denouncing his former coalition partners, he declared that Labour &quot;would have to fall back on some form of a Gestapo&quot; to impose socialism on Britain. Attlee responded the next night by ironically thanking the prime minister for demonstrating to the people the difference between &quot;Churchill the great wartime leader&quot; and &quot;Churchill the peacetime politician&quot; and argued the case for public control of industry.

Another blow to the Conservative campaign was the memory of the 1930s policy of appeasement, conducted by Churchill&#x27;s Conservative predecessors, Neville Chamberlain and Stanley Baldwin, that had been widely discredited for allowing Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Germany to become too powerful. Labour had strongly advocated appeasement until 1938, but the interwar period had been dominated by Conservatives. With the exception of two brief minority Labour governments in 1924 and 1929–1931, the Conservatives had been in power for all of the interwar period. As a result, the Conservatives were generally blamed for the era&#x27;s mistakes: appeasement, inflation and the unemployment of the Great Depression. Many voters felt that although the First World War had been won, the peace that followed had been lost.

All comparisons are with the winning party in the 1935 election; the aim is to provide a comparison with the previous general election. This list includes seats where the incumbent was standing down and therefore there was no possibility of a particular person being defeated. 
*In some cases the sitting MP had changed to the gaining party. Such circumstances are marked with a *.
*In other circumstances the gaining party had won a by-election in the intervening years, and then retained the seat in 1945. Such circumstances are marked with a †.

== MPs who lost their seats ==
=== Conservative ===
* Nigel Colman (Brixton)
* Harold Macmillan (Stockton-on-Tees)

=== Liberal ===
* Percy Harris (Bethnal Green South West)

==Opinion polls==

Polls showed a lead for Labour since 1943, except for one poll in June 1945 when both Labour and the Conservatives tied on 45%.

<text>Mohawk College of Applied Arts and Technology is a public college of applied arts and technology located in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Established in 1966, the college currently has five main campuses: the Fennell Campus on the Hamilton Mountain, the Marshall School of Skilled Trades and Apprenticeship Campus in Stoney Creek, the Mohawk-McMaster Institute for Applied Health Sciences at McMaster University., the Centre for Aviation Technology Campus and a Mississauga campus at Square One in partnership with triOS a private career college.

, more than 1,000 faculty instructors, 12,500 full-time students, 4,000 apprentices, 46,000 continuing education registrants, and 1,800 international students have studied in more than 130 post-secondary and apprenticeship programs. Since its founding, over 115,000 students have graduated from Mohawk College.

In 2024 Mohawk introduced a layoff plan to cut a significant number of staff due to decreased international student enrollment.

== History ==
Mohawk College was established during the formation of Ontario&#x27;s college system in 1966. The school was founded in 1967 as part of a provincial initiative to create many such institutions to provide career-oriented advanced diploma, diploma, and certificate courses, as well as continuing education programs to Ontario communities.

=== Awards and recognition ===
Mohawk has received three national Yves Landry Foundation awards. The Mohawk and McMaster University Bachelor of Technology Partnership was recognized with the Yves Landry 2006 Innovative Manufacturing Technology Program Award: University Level. Yves Landry Awards were also presented to Mohawk&#x27;s Modern Foundry Technologies Institute in 2001 and its Integrated Technician Apprenticeship Program in 2004.

Mohawk Advertising students have won more than 30 national Canadian Marketing Association awards and have won gold in the student creative category for seven consecutive years.

Every year, Mohawk celebrates the career achievements and community contributions of outstanding alumni. Mohawk Alumni of Distinction recipients are nominated by the college for Premier&#x27;s Awards.

In 2007, Mohawk Vice President Academic (retired) Rosemary Knechtel received the Association of Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology of Ontario (now Colleges Ontario) Distinguished Service Award.

In 2008, Mohawk early childhood education graduate Debbie Crickmore and ECE professor Karyn Callaghan received YWCA Hamilton Women of Distinction Awards.

The award was accepted by Owen Thomas, representing the journalism program, and Thomas Raike representing the television program.
== Programs ==
Mohawk offers two-year Ontario college diplomas, three-year Ontario college advanced diplomas, one-year Ontario college graduate certificates and four-year collaborative degree programs, the latter in association with McMaster University.

Mohawk offers more than 130 full-time programs, apprenticeship programs and more than 1,000 continuing education courses.

Mohawk specialise in health science and engineering technology education and is the largest trainer of apprentices in Ontario.

To serve Hamilton&#x27;s growing immigrant population, Mohawk offers English language training and innovative bridging programs for foreign-trained professionals in health sciences and engineering technology.

In 2021, Mohawk opened a centre for aviation technology, consisting of a 75,000 square foot classroom and laboratory space located at the Hamilton International Airport. That same year, Mohawk introduced an accelerated training program for Personal Support Workers, which allows students to become fully credentialed graduates within a six month time period.

== Scholarships ==
In November 2009, the College joined Project Hero, a scholarship program cofounded by General (Ret&#x27;d) Rick Hillier for the families of fallen Canadian Forces members.

== Media ==
The college operates a campus radio station, &quot;101.5 The Hawk&quot;, and an online student newspaper &quot;Ignite News&quot;.

== Library ==
Mohawk College has five library locations, one of which is an e-Library. The Fennell Campus library is named the Harold Cummings Library after a $4 million donation by the late Harold Cummings and father of a Mohawk library employee. At the time of the donation in 2009, it was the largest private donation in Mohawk&#x27;s history.

== Faculties ==
The faculties include the McKeil School of Business, Faculty of Media and Entertainment, Faculty of Engineering Technology, Faculty of Health Sciences, and the Faculty of Community and Urban Studies.

== Campuses ==
=== Fennell Campus ===

The Fennell Campus in Hamilton is Mohawk&#x27;s main campus and is home to programs from Mohawk&#x27;s McKeil School of Business, Communication Arts, Technology and Community Services programs.

Opened in 2018, the Joyce Centre for Partnership &amp; Innovation (Fennel Campus EA Wing) is the cornerstone of a renewal of technology labs and classrooms. Once construction and renovations are complete, enrolment in technology programs will grow from 3,500 to 4,500 students and applied research activity will increase by 50 per cent.

The Fennell Campus is home to the College&#x27;s McKeil School of Business (i Wing), which is named in honour of Blair and Kathy McKeil. The McKeil family and their company, Mckeil Marine, are proud supporters of Mohawk. The McKeil School of Business is home to students in advertising, business, marketing, public relations and office administration programs.

Mohawk is a member of the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association. In September 2013, Mohawk officially opened the 64,000 square foot David Braley Athletic and Recreation Centre. The $35 million centre is open to all students for varsity and intramural sports and personal fitness.

The McIntyre Performing Arts Centre accommodates up to 1039 people and is only second to Hamilton Place in size in the area.

=== Stoney Creek Campus ===
Mohawk claims to be the largest trainer of apprentices in Ontario, with more than 4,000 apprentices at the Stoney Creek Campus.
The newest addition to the campus is a 12,000 square foot building now under construction across from the Gerald Marshall Centre for Transportation. Half of the $3 million building is dedicated to a shop where apprentices from across the campus will work together on large scale community projects. The centre will also include classrooms and programmable control labs.

=== Centre for Aviation Technology at Hamilton International Airport ===
Opened in 2021, the Centre for Aviation Technology, located at the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport provides specialized facilities and learning spaces designed for students in the 4 aviation technology programs offered by Mohawk College. The campus is equipped with a variety of aircraft located in the hangar and tarmac, practical learning labs, classrooms, common areas, and a cafeteria. The Centre for Aviation Technology is part of a 3 hangar complex owned by aviation maintenance overhaul firm KF Aerospace. The campus takes up the first of the 3 hangars, and provides a strategic partnership between the college and KF Aerospace.

=== IAHS at McMaster University in Hamilton ===
More than 1,700 full-time students attend the Mohawk-McMaster Institute for Applied Health Sciences (IAHS), the first facility in Canada to combine college and university health sciences education and research under one roof. The IAHS is home to collaborative nursing and medical radiation sciences programs that have achieved the highest level of accreditation possible. The IAHS includes a clinical simulation lab modelled after a hospital ward and a fully operational medical radiation lab where students gain hands-on experience prior to clinical placements. Starting in 2016, more than $3 million in renovations will transform the campus into a one-of-a-kind simulated hospital and long-term care centre. Students from Mohawk&#x27;s Nursing, Practical Nursing, Medical Radiation Sciences, Personal Support Worker and Pharmacy Technician programs will learn together in cross disciplinary teams, mirroring how they&#x27;ll work during their clinical placements and throughout their careers.

=== City School by Mohawk ===
City School by Mohawk was launched in the fall of 2015 with the opening of the City School location at the Eva Rothwell Centre in North Hamilton.

<text>DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, Inc. (also known as Mirisch-Geoffrey-DePatie-Freleng Productions when involved with the Mirisch brothers and Geoffrey Productions, and DFE Films) was an American animation studio founded by former Warner Bros. Cartoons employees in May 1963, before being acquired by Marvel in 1981 and renamed Marvel Productions. Based in Burbank, California, DFE produced animation for film and television.

Notable among the productions that the studio produced are the opening titles for &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963), its first two and fifth sequels and an associated series of animated theatrical shorts featuring the Pink Panther character, entries in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series from 1964 to 1967, the Dr. Seuss television specials from 1971 to 1982, the lightsaber effects in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), and the &quot;Bod Squad&quot; and &quot;Time for Timer&quot; series of public service announcements for ABC in the mid 1970s.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
DFE was originally formed by two former employees at Warner Bros. Cartoons, director/composer/producer Friz Freleng and executive David H. DePatie, after Warner Bros. closed its animation studio in May 1963. Although Freleng and DePatie were no longer working for Warner Bros., a generous gesture from a Warner executive allowed Freleng and DePatie to lease the former Warner cartoons studio on California Street in Burbank, complete with equipment and supplies for a low rent each year. Although DFE&#x27;s initial business was commercials and industrial films, several lucky breaks put the new studio into the theatrical cartoon business.

Director Blake Edwards contacted DFE and asked them to design a panther character for Edwards&#x27;s new film, &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;. Pleased with the design by Hawley Pratt for the character, Edwards contracted with DFE to produce the animated titles for the film. Upon the film&#x27;s release, the titles garnered a tremendous amount of attention, so much that a large amount of the picture&#x27;s gross is believed to have been generated by the success of DFE&#x27;s title sequence.

DFE then signed with United Artists to produce a series of animated short subjects featuring the Pink Panther, which included over 100 shorts for both theatrical and television audiences through 1980. Also in 1964, DePatie and Freleng&#x27;s longtime employer, Warner Bros., contracted with DFE to produce additional new &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon shorts for theatrical release.

DePatie and Freleng soon found themselves overflowing with work; as many of the animators who had worked at Warner Bros. during the 1950s and 1960s returned to the old Warner cartoon studio to work for DFE. The first entry in the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; series, &quot;The Pink Phink&quot;, was directed by Freleng and won the studio its only Academy Award in 1964. In 1966, DFE would receive another Academy Award nomination for &quot;The Pink Blueprint&quot;, before losing the award.

=== &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot; and others===
&quot;The Pink Panther&quot; theatrical animated shorts became the basis of a Saturday-morning cartoon, &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;, on September 6, 1969; the show also included theatrical animated shorts of &quot;The Inspector&quot; (introduced in 1966) and eventually &quot;The Ant and the Aardvark&quot;, &quot;Roland and Rattfink&quot; (introduced in 1968), and &quot;The Texas Toads&quot; (&quot;Tijuana Toads&quot;). Like most animated television cartoons at the time, &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot; contained a laugh track with narration. The cartoons were edited and in some cases re-dubbed to meet television standards and practices for content.

&quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot; had several incarnations during the 1970s. The show was popular on NBC&#x27;s Saturday morning line-up, starting as a half-hour program and expanding a few years later to 90 minutes each week. The studio provided the animated sequences for the 1969–1970 television series &quot;My World and Welcome to It&quot;, based on the drawings of James Thurber. DFE was one of the subcontractors for the 1964–1967 Warner Bros. cartoons, along with Format Productions.

The &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts made by the studio can be easily identified by their modernized &quot;Abstract WB&quot; opening and closing sequences (although the &quot;Abstract WB&quot; opening and closing sequences were first used in three cartoons made by Warner Bros. Cartoons). However, select 1964–1967 DePatie–Freleng Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies were panned by fans and critics alike, with some of the harshest judgements made against cartoons directed by Rudy Larriva. After early 1967, DFE did not continue doing Warner cartoon work until the late 1970s/early 1980s, with the television specials &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Easter Special&quot; (1977), &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s Looney Christmas Tales&quot; (1979), and &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Easter Egg-Citement&quot; (1980).

DFE also produced &quot;Return to the Planet of the Apes&quot;, which ran on NBC from September 6 to November 29, 1975, and &quot;The Oddball Couple&quot;, which ran on Saturday mornings on ABC from September 6 to December 20, 1975. One of the studio&#x27;s television specials was &quot;The Bear Who Slept Through Christmas&quot; (1973), with Tommy Smothers voicing the little bear who goes out to find Christmas (in the human world) while his fellow bears head for hibernation. DFE was also responsible for a number of Dr. Seuss specials, including &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; and different incarnations of the Grinch.

=== Sale to Marvel and post-history ===
In 1981, Freleng and DePatie sold DFE Films to Marvel Comics, and Freleng returned to Warner Bros. Animation, which Warner Bros. had re-opened the previous year, to produce a series of feature films featuring vintage Warner cartoons with new connecting footage. DePatie made the transition to become the head of Marvel Productions, as DFE was renamed. In March 1982, David DePatie announced that they started producing animated programs. The DePatie-Freleng name was later revived in-name-only in 1984 for &quot;Pink Panther and Sons&quot;, which was otherwise entirely produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions.

Although Marvel produced mainly superhero cartoons and animated series based on licensed toy lines (including Hasbro properties), it continued to produce new productions starring the Pink Panther (a special for television &quot;Pink at First Sight&quot; and motion picture titles for &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; and &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot;). Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation would later make a 1993 revival show of &quot;the Pink Panther&quot; as a joint venture between MGM, Mirisch-Geoffrey-DePatie-Freleng and United Artists, a decade after DFE&#x27;s merger with Marvel and Mirisch/UA&#x27;s merger into MGM.

In 1993, Marvel Productions was renamed to New World Animation; after News Corporation purchased New World Entertainment in 1996, New World Animation was absorbed into Saban Entertainment, ending the life of the studio that once was DFE. Marvel would continue to produce animated shows through a partnership with Saban, which had recently acquired a 50% stake in Fox Kids. In 2001, The Walt Disney Company acquired Saban as part of its purchase of Fox Family Worldwide.

== Subsequent ownership ==
In 2009, The Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment, bringing DFE&#x27;s all-original and Marvel Comics-based programs full circle under one roof; all of these properties are now distributed by Disney–ABC Domestic Television. The Dr. Seuss specials animated by DFE are currently distributed by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment through the Dr. Seuss estate and CBS Media Ventures.

While the television catalog has often changed hands over the years, the theatrical cartoons continue to be owned by their original distributors: United Artists (via its current corporate parent, Amazon MGM Studios) for The Mirisch Company cartoon library and Warner Bros. for the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons.

== Former Warner Bros. Cartoons employees at DePatie–Freleng ==
In the beginning, DePatie–Freleng had virtually the same facilities, personnel and producer as Warner Bros. Cartoons. Although Chuck Jones would later work with DePate–Freleng on &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;, Jones and most of his group of artists ended up at Sib Tower 12 Productions. Jones independently produced new &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons for MGM.

Although many DePatie–Freleng employees contributed greatly to the success of its product, story artist and Disney and Warner alumnus John W. Dunn created most of the studios&#x27; new cartoon series, both for theatrical release and for television. These series included &quot;The Ant and the Aardvark&quot;, &quot;Tijuana Toads&quot;, &quot;Here Comes the Grump&quot;, and &quot;Roland and Rattfink&quot;, among others.

Many of the DFE cartoons were written and storyboarded by Dunn, including the first Pink Panther cartoon, &quot;The Pink Phink&quot;. Dunn&#x27;s drawing style also found its way into the DFE cartoons.

<doc id="332711" wikidata="Q2671249" url="?curid=332711" title="Churchill White Paper">
<text>The Churchill White Paper of 3 June 1922 (sometimes referred to as &quot;British Policy in Palestine&quot;) was drafted at the request of Winston Churchill, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, partly in response to the 1921 Jaffa Riots. The official name of the document was Palestine: Correspondence with the Palestine Arab Delegation and the Zionist Organisation. The white paper was made up of nine documents and &quot;Churchill&#x27;s memorandum&quot; was an enclosure to document number 5. While maintaining Britain&#x27;s commitment to the Balfour Declaration and its promise of a Jewish national home in Mandatory Palestine, the paper emphasized that the establishment of a national home would not impose a Jewish nationality on the Arab inhabitants of Palestine. To reduce tensions between the Arabs and Jews in Palestine the paper called for a limitation of Jewish immigration to the economic capacity of the country to absorb new arrivals. This limitation was considered a great setback to many in the Zionist movement, though it acknowledged that the Jews should be able to increase their numbers through immigration rather than sufferance.

==Antecedents==

===Emergent resistance===
On 23 October 1918 following the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I, the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration was established over Levantine provinces of the former Ottoman Empire. Earlier, on 1 October 1918, General Allenby had been authorized to permit the hoisting of the Arab flag at Damascus. An Arab government was announced on 5 October 1918 and gained &quot;de facto&quot; independence after the withdrawal of the British forces on 26 November 1919.
During 1918, Muslim-Christian Associations were set up across Palestine with a view to opposing Zionism and later established the Palestine Arab Congress to further that objective. On the first anniversary of the Balfour Declaration in November 1918 there were non-violent protests. Petitions against Zionist policy were delivered to Ronald Storrs as well as the Governor of Jaffa.
In early 1919, the first Palestinian Arab Congress rejected political Zionism. Palestine was seen as part of an independent Syria under Faisal bin Hussein.
It was decided to send a delegation to Damascus and representatives attended the Syrian National Congress in Damascus on 8 June 1919 &quot;to inform Arab patriots there of the decision to call Palestine Southern Syria and unite it with Northern Syria&quot;.

The Arab Kingdom of Syria was an unrecognized state proclaimed as a Kingdom on 8 March 1920 and existed until 25 July 1920. During its brief existence, the kingdom was led by Faisal, the son of Sharif Hussein bin Ali. Despite its claims to the region of Syria, Faisal&#x27;s government controlled a limited area and was dependent on Britain which, along with France, generally opposed the idea of a Greater Syria and refused to recognize the kingdom.

Shortly after the Jerusalem riots of early April, the San Remo conference at the end of April 1920, awarded the Palestine mandate to Britain and the authorities decided to refuse permission for the convening of a second Palestinian Arab Congress intended to address the new situation.

In a lecture given at the UN, Rashid Khalidi noted that the Palestine reaction to the declaration was delayed by the continuing closure of newspapers for two years and the dismal post-war circumstances of the country. The military administration had decided not to publish the Balfour Declaration for fear of the consequences. After the appointment of Herbert Samuel was known, on 28 April 1920 in Acre, General Bols informed the &quot;representatives of all communities&quot; that the mandate and declaration would be included in the peace treaty with Turkey. The Palin Commission speculated that, in view of all the later &quot;misunderstandings&quot;, it might have been wiser to have published the declaration in the first instance and avoid the confusion. It was not until May 1920 that the text of the Balfour Declaration was read out in Nablus by Sir Louis Bols.

===At Cairo and Jerusalem===
The Executive Committee of the third Palestine Arab Congress, headed by Musa Kazim al-Husseini, met the new High Commissioner, Herbert Samuel, who refused to give them any official recognition unless they accepted British policy for a Jewish national home. Having been rebuffed in their attempt to have discussions with Churchill in Cairo, on 28 March 1921, the committee instead met Churchill in Jerusalem for that part of the Cairo conference and presented a memorandum detailing their complaints; while he assured the committee that in respect of the second part of the Balfour Declaration,&quot;if one promise stands so does the other&quot;, he said that it was a matter of policy and the Arabs could do nothing other than accept it and the consequences, including Jewish immigration.

In Cairo, Palestine had been discussed with Emir Abdullah who argued that he should be given control of the entire area of Mandate Palestine responsible to the High Commissioner. Alternatively he advocated a union with Iraq. Churchill rejected both demands. Responding to Abdullah&#x27;s fear for a Jewish kingdom west of the Jordan, Churchill decreed it was not only not contemplated &quot;that hundreds and thousands of Jews were going to pour into the country in a very short time and dominate the existing population&quot;, but even was quite impossible. &quot;Jewish immigration would be a very slow process and the rights of the existing non-Jewish population would be strictly preserved.&quot; About British policy in Palestine, Herbert Samuel added that &quot;There was no question of setting up a Jewish Government there ... No land would be taken from any Arab, nor would the Moslem religion be touched in any way.&quot;

===In London===

The fourth congress, on 25 June 1921, voted to send a six-man delegation to London which left Palestine on 19 July 1921. After a short visit to Cairo, the delegation went to Rome where they were received in audience by Pope Benedict XV who expressed sympathy with their cause. The delegation (usually referred to as the Palestinian Arab or Muslim-Christian Delegation) arrived in London on August 8. Three members of the delegation went to Geneva and joined the Syrian–Palestinian Congress to put their case to the League of Nations and to protest the draft mandate. 
The president of the delegation was Musa Kazim al-Husseini. Its secretary was Shibli al-Jamal (Dr. Fu&#x27;ad Samad, assistant secretary) and the other 4 delegates were Tawfiq Hammad, Amin al-Tamimi, Ibrahim Shammas, Mu&#x27;in al-Madi.
Three meetings with Churchill were had in August and other discussions and correspondence with Colonial Office officials along with meeting Weizmann in November all of which were fruitless since the delegation effectively wanted the policy abandoned altogether and the British were not prepared to countenance anything other than minor adjustments. Finally, the draft of the proposed Palestine constitution was sent to the delegation in February and their response marks the first document published in the white paper.

===Jaffa riots===

The May 1921 riots in and around Jaffa were the subject of a report published on 1 October 1921, determining the main cause as being due to Arab discontent about Jewish immigration and perceived pro-Jewish bias by Mandatory authorities. Its remit was expanded to include looking into any recent disturbances in Palestine so also considered the unpublished Palin report into the April 1920 Jerusalem riots. The White paper was intended to address the issues that had been identified.

==Statement of policy in Palestine==
On 3 June 1921, Samuel made a speech (quoted from in paragraph 6 of the 1 March 1922 document #2 of the white paper) which McTague describes as a necessary effort, after more than three years, to define the Balfour Declaration. As one author put it, quoting a 6 June 1920 report to the Foreign Office, &quot;..what struck me most of all was that nobody seemed to know what the Zionist policy of His Majesty’s Government meant.&quot; Churchill quoted Samuel in the first full parliamentary debate of 14 June 1921 on Palestine and wherein he defended the policy and the mandates arguing that it had all been agreed prior, it was important for Britain to keep its word and that provided immigration were properly regulated then that would benefit the economy.

It was Herbert Samuel who insisted, on returning to London in May, on a &quot;definitive&quot; interpretation of the Declaration. Although supporting the principle, the policy restricted the interpretation of a &quot;national home,&quot; geographically excluding the territory east of the Jordan River; politically, by defining it in terms of &quot;development of the existing community&quot;; and numerically, limiting future immigration to &quot;the economic capacity of the country&quot;.

The &quot;British Policy in Palestine&quot; (enclosure in document #5 of the white paper) was accepted by the Zionist Organization (document #7 of the white paper) and rejected by the Palestinians (document #6 of the white paper) Shortly thereafter, the House of Lords rejected a Palestine Mandate that incorporated the Balfour Declaration by 60 votes to 25. The vote was subsequently overruled by a vote of 292 to 35 in the House of Commons.

The white paper, formalized as a Palestine Order in Council in August, reaffirmed the British commitment to a national home, promised that Palestine would not become a Jewish State and that Arabs would not be subordinated to Jews. Fieldhouse further says that the white paper &quot;interpreted and subtly modified the harshness of the mandate.&quot; It pointed out that the Balfour Declaration did &quot;not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a Jewish national home, but that such a home should be founded in Palestine&quot; and affirming the right to Jewish immigration but subject to the concept of &quot;economic absorptive capacity&quot;.

Evyatar Friesel says that the terms of the Churchill Memorandum and the Mandate were &quot;clearly contradictory&quot;. There was a &quot;double obligation&quot; to Jew and non-Jew. The idea of a national home in Palestine as a whole was refuted while accepting that Jews were in Palestine &quot;as of right and not on sufferance&quot;.

Renton, while noting that Zionist commitments in the Mandate went beyond the Declaration in recognizing the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine, along with the &quot;grounds for reconstituting their national home in that country&quot; and that Britain had to secure the establishment of a &quot;Jewish national home&quot; also says that the Mandatory had the responsibility for developing self-governing institutions for the whole population of Palestine, not just Jews, and for &quot;safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine&quot;. The problem was that neither the declaration nor the Mandate defined the national home; the rights of the &quot;non-Jewish&quot; population and how they might be affected by the creation of the national home, and how they were to be &quot;safeguarded&quot;, were not specified. These loose terms did not provide any clarity as to how the country should be governed, or its essential purpose, a fundamental deficiency inherited from the Declaration.

In the matter of the claim put forward by the Palestinian Arab delegation with respect to the McMahon-Hussein correspondence, Kedourie notes that McMahon was asked about the matter and that his letter of 12 March 1922 only &quot;added to the confusion&quot;. Although Samuel pressed for publication John Evelyn Shuckburgh, head of Colonial Office Middle East policy, considered nothing would be gained not least because the Palestinian Arab delegation had already been given a different argument for the exclusion of Palestine from McMahon&#x27;s pledge. Kedourie also opines that it is doubtful that publication would have put an end to the argument and that the reply given in the white paper correspondence was &quot;by no means&quot; an answer to the claim.

==Subsequent developments==

In February 1923, following a change in government, Cavendish, in a lengthy memorandum for the Cabinet, laid the foundation for a secret review of Palestine policy:

His covering note asked for a statement of policy to be made as soon as possible and that the cabinet ought to focus on three questions: (1) whether or not pledges to the Arabs conflict with the Balfour declaration; (2) if not, whether the new government should continue the policy set down by the old government in the 1922 White Paper; and (3) if not, what alternative policy should be adopted.

Stanley Baldwin, replacing Bonar Law, in June 1923 set up a cabinet subcommittee whose terms of reference were:

The Cabinet approved the report of this committee on 31 July 1923. Describing it as &quot;nothing short of remarkable&quot;, Quigley noted that the government was admitting to itself that its support for Zionism had been prompted by considerations having nothing to do with the merits of Zionism or its consequences for Palestine. As Huneidi noted, &quot;wise or unwise, it is well nigh impossible for any government to extricate itself without a substantial sacrifice of consistency and self-respect, if not honour.&quot;

The wording of the declaration was thus incorporated into the British Mandate for Palestine, a legal instrument that created Mandatory Palestine with an explicit purpose of putting the declaration into effect and was finally formalized in September 1923. Unlike the declaration itself, the Mandate was legally binding on the British government. In June, 1924, Britain made its report to the Permanent Mandates Commission for the period July 1920 to the end of 1923 containing nothing of the candor reflected in the internal documents; the documents relating to the 1923 reappraisal stayed secret until the early 1970s.

<text>Daraa (, is a city in southwestern Syria, north of the border with Jordan. It is the capital of Daraa Governorate in the Hauran region. Located south of Damascus on the Damascus–Amman highway, it serves as a way station for travelers. Nearby localities include Umm al-Mayazen and Nasib to the southeast, al-Naimah to the east, Ataman to the north, al-Yaduda to the northwest and Ramtha, Jordan, to the southwest.

According to the Syrian Central Bureau of Statistics, Daraa had a population of 97,969 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of a &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) which contained eight localities with a collective population of 146,481 in 2004. Its inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslims.

Daraa became known as the &quot;cradle of the revolution&quot; after the arrest of 15 boys from prominent families for painting graffiti with anti-government slogans which sparked the beginning of the 2011 Syrian Revolution.

==History==

===Ancient history===
Daraa is an ancient city dating back to the Canaanites. It was mentioned in Egyptian hieroglyphic tablets at the time of the Pharaoh Thutmose III between 1490 and 1436 BC as the city of Atharaa. It is referred to in the Hebrew Bible as Edrei or Edre&#x27;i (אֶדְרֶעִי), the capital of Bashan, site of a battle where the Israelites defeated Og. According to Jewish tradition, Eldad and Medad were buried in Edrei.

===Classical era===
In the Greek Seleucid Empire, and later the Roman Empire into which it was incorporated by Emperor Trajan in 106, the city was known as Adraa (Ἀδράα), the name used on its coinage. It was incorporated into the province of Arabia Petraea. 

By the 3rd century, it gained the status of a &quot;polis&quot; (self-governed city). Roman historian Eusebius referred to it as Adraa, a famous &quot;polis&quot; of Arabia. The area east of Adraa was a centre of the Ebionites. Adraa itself was a Christian bishopric. Arabio, the first bishop of Adraa whose name is known, participated in the Council of Seleucia of 359. Uranius was at the First Council of Constantinople in 381; Proclus at the anti-Eutyches synod of Constantinople in 448 and the Council of Chalcedon in 451; and Dorimenius at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553. No longer a residential bishopric, Adraa is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see. It was also a centre of monastic and missionary activity in the Syrian Desert. 

In 614, the Sasanian Persians sacked Adraa during the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, but spared the inhabitants.

===Islamic era===
According to Ibn Hisham and al-Waqidi, 9th-century biographers of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, the Jewish Banu Nadir and Banu Qaynuqa tribes immigrated to Adhri&#x27;at, as it was known in the early Islamic period, following their expulsion from Medina. However, historian Moshe Sharon says this does not appear in Jewish or earlier Muslim sources. Situated between the major Jewish centres of Palestine and Babylonia, Adhri&#x27;at had a large Jewish population in the early 7th century and served as a place of Jewish learning. Its residents lit an annual bonfire before Rosh Hashannah to alert Babylonia&#x27;s Jewish communities to the start of the new year.

Early Muslim historian al-Baladuri lists Adhri&#x27;at as one of the towns conquered by the Muslim army following the Battle of Mu&#x27;ta in 629 and forced to pay the jizya tax. However, contemporary sources maintain that Adhri&#x27;at was conquered by the Muslim army during the caliphate of Abu Bakr in 634. Adhri&#x27;at&#x27;s residents reportedly celebrated the arrival of the second caliph Umar when he visited the city, &quot;dancing with swords and sweet basil.&quot; Throughout Rashidun and Umayyad rule, the city served as the capital of the al-Bathaniyya subdistrict, part of the larger Jund Dimashq (&quot;military district of Damascus.&quot;)

In 906, the population was massacred in a raid by the rebellious Qarmatians. The late 10th-century geographer al-Muqaddasi noted that during the Abbasid period, Adhri&#x27;at was a major administrative center on the edge of the desert. He claimed the city was part of the Jund al-Urdunn district and that its territory was &quot;full of villages&quot; and included the region of Jerash to the south of the Yarmouk River.

Throughout the early Islamic period, it served as a strategic station on the Hajj caravan route between Damascus and Medina and as the gate to central Syria. The Crusaders temporarily conquered Adhri&#x27;at, then known as &quot;Adratum&quot;, during the reign of Baldwin II of Jerusalem in 1118.

According to Yaqut al-Hamawi, in the early 13th-century during Ayyubid rule, Adhri&#x27;at was &quot;celebrated for the many learned men who were natives of the place.&quot; Under the Mamluks and the Ottomans, the city maintained its importance. In 1596 Daraa appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as &#x27;
Madinat Idra&#x27;a&#x27; and was part of the &quot;nahiya&quot; of Butayna (Bathaniyya) in the Hauran Sanjak. It had a Muslim population of 120 households and 45 bachelors. A 40% tax−rate was levied on wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and/or beehives; a total of 26,500 akçe.

In 1838, Eli Smith listed Daraa as a Muslim, Catholic and Greek Orthodox village in the Nuqrah (southern Hauran plain), south of Eshmiskin.

===Modern era===
Following the construction of the Hejaz Railway, Daraa became a chief junction of the railroad. In his book &quot;Seven Pillars&quot; and a letter to a military colleague, T. E. Lawrence says he was captured by the Ottoman military in Daraa, where he was beaten and sexually abused by the local Bey and his guardsmen. During the Battle of Megiddo, Lawrence led the Arab Revolt in cutting the southern rail line at Mafraq, the northern at Tell Arar, and the western by Mezerib. On 27 September 1918, the Arab Northern Army captured Daraa from the retreating Ottoman forces.

Daraa is the southernmost city of Syria near the border with Jordan and a major midpoint between Damascus and Amman.

After the Syrian Ba&#x27;ath Party gained power following the 1963 coup, the new interior minister Amin al-Hafiz appointed Abd al-Rahman al-Khlayfawi as governor of Daraa until 1965.
Daraa had recently, before the Syrian Civil War, suffered from reduced water supply in the region and had been straining under the influx of internal refugees who were forced to leave their northeastern lands due to a drought exacerbated by the government&#x27;s lack of provision.

====Syrian Civil War====

Daraa played an important role by the start of the 2011 uprising against the government led by President Bashar al-Assad as part of the Arab Spring protests with hundreds of thousands of people protesting in the city. The uprising was sparked on 6 March 2011, when at least 15 youths were arrested and tortured for scrawling graffiti on their school wall denouncing the Assad government. The family and friends of the detained youths and tens of thousands of locals marched on the streets on 15 March, demanding their release. According to activists, this protest was faced with Syrian security forces opening fire on the protesters killing four people. Protests continued daily. 

During this time the local courthouse, the Ba&#x27;ath party headquarters in the city, and the Syriatel building owned by Rami Makhlouf, a cousin of President Assad, were set on fire. What followed was a government assault on the city as violence continued and intensified all across Syria. On 25 April 2011, the Syrian military launched a large operation in Daraa in a crackdown on protesters. The operation lasted until 5 May 2011, killing and arresting tens of thousands of locals in the process.

On 16 February 2012, the Syrian Army reportedly attacked Daraa, shelling the city heavily. This was apparently because, &quot;Daraa has been regaining its role in the uprising. Demonstrations resumed and the FSA provided security for protests in some parts of the city.&quot; The attack was part of a security force push &quot;to regain control of areas they lost in recent weeks&quot;, indicating that the FSA in Daraa had taken control of parts of the city. Security forces attacked at least three districts, but FSA fighters fought back, firing at Syrian Army roadblocks and buildings housing security police and militiamen. On 14 March 2012, the FSA controlled at least one main district in the city of Daraa (al-Balad district) prompting the Syrian army to attack it with anti-aircraft guns.

In early June 2017, much of Daraa was reported to have been destroyed by protracted fighting. On 12 July 2018, the battle for Daraa ended after several days of intense clashes between the Syrian Army and rebel forces, some of which agreed to terms of reconciliation. The Syrian Army retook the city fully.

The March 2020 Daraa clashes and 2021 Daraa offensive ended with Syrian Army victory. After that, the Syrian government fully recaptured the city, reestablished state institutions there, and restarted the reconciliation process.

On 6 December 2024, the Southern Front began an offensive to take the city. 90% of the governorate, including the city itself, fell under their control.

==Geography==
The city also contains a Palestinian refugee camp, known as Daraa camp.

===Climate===
Daraa has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;).
