<text>The Arizona Rattlers are a professional indoor football team based in the Phoenix metropolitan area that competes in the Indoor Football League (IFL). The Rattlers were founded in 1992 as an expansion team in the Arena Football League and were the third oldest active franchise in the AFL until their departure in 2016. They play their home games at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale. They previously played at Footprint Center in downtown Phoenix. 

The Rattlers are led by head coach Kevin Guy. Since the team&#x27;s establishment in 1992, the Rattlers have won ten division titles and have played in nine ArenaBowl Championship games, winning championships in 1994, 1997, 2012, 2013, 2014. The Rattlers also won the 2017 United Bowl in their first season in the IFL.

It is believed that the Rattlers are the longest-tenured, continuously-active indoor/arena team in the game&#x27;s history being active for over 30 years (not counting the COVID-19 pandemic season cancelation in 2020).

==History==
===Founding (1991)===
In 1987, it was speculated that the Phoenix, Arizona, area would be a target for the newly formed Arena Football League (AFL).

On September 11, 1991, it was announced that Jerry Colangelo had been awarded an expansion franchise in the AFL in Phoenix. Colangelo, owner of the NBA&#x27;s Phoenix Suns, first approached Frank Kush to coach his team, but Kush declined the invitation. In October 1991, the team announced that former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Danny White would be the franchise&#x27;s first head coach. In December 1991, the team announced that they would be named the Arizona Rattlers after more than 250 people suggested that the team&#x27;s nickname should be the Rattlers, while 55% of their responders picked &quot;Arizona&quot; over &quot;Phoenix&quot;.

===Danny White era (1992–2004)===
In 1992, the Rattlers began with their first two games on the road, and won their home debut in front of a sell-out crowd of 15,505 at America West Arena by a score of 56–31 over the Sacramento Attack.

In 1994, the Rattlers captured their first ArenaBowl championship, with a 36–31 victory over the Orlando Predators.

In 1997, the Rattlers won their second championship defeating the Iowa Barnstormers, led by future Super Bowl champion QB Kurt Warner, 55-33.

In December 1999, Gene Nudo, White and Will Meris pursued the purchase of the Rattlers from Colangelo.

===Kevin Guy era (2008–present)===
====AFL (2008–2016)====
In 2008, it was announced that Brett Bouchy would become the new owner of the Arizona Rattlers. After the Rattlers had a 4–12 record in 2007, Brett Bouchy hired Kevin Guy as the new Arizona Rattlers head coach in the 2008 season and the Rattlers improved to an 8–8 record and clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2006, but lost in the first round. 

In August 2009, numerous media outlets began reporting that the AFL was folding permanently and would file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The league released a statement on August 4 to the effect that while the league was not folding, it was suspending league operations indefinitely. Despite this, several of the league&#x27;s creditors filed papers to force a Chapter 7 liquidation if the league did not do so voluntarily. This request was granted on August 7, though converted to a Chapter 11 reorganization on August 26. However, Brett Bouchy and a group of investors planned to launch a new league called Arena Football 1 and helped the Arizona Rattlers and the Orlando Predators to become two of the four teams to survive and return in 2010 with Arena Football 1. 

In early 2010, it was announced that Arena Football 1 was granted the trademarks to the AFL brand and was renamed the Arena Football League. In 2011, after Brett Bouchy was able to keep both the Arizona Rattlers and the Orlando Predators alive, he was forced to let go of ownership to one of the teams that became the Arizona Rattlers.

On May 12, 2011, Ron Shurts became the new majority owner of the Rattlers franchise. In , the Rattlers won 16 games in the regular season, a league record for wins in a single regular season. In the playoffs, by winning the National Conference championship, they clinched a berth in ArenaBowl XXIV. They lost the game to the Jacksonville Sharks when Jacksonville quarterback Aaron Garcia threw a game-winning touchdown pass on the game&#x27;s final play. The Rattlers redeemed themselves the following season, winning ArenaBowl XXV over the Philadelphia Soul to win their first title in 15 years.

In 2013, the Rattlers and Soul met again in ArenaBowl XXVI, with the Rattlers winning yet again, 48–39. This made them the first team since 1995 to win back-to-back championships, and the first team in history to beat the same team for both titles.

In 2014, the Rattlers went 15–3 in the regular season after a 14-game winning streak to start the season, and defeated the Cleveland Gladiators in ArenaBowl XXVII by a score of 72–32, becoming the first team in AFL history to win three consecutive AFL championships since the Detroit Drive of 1988–1990, as well as establishing the largest margin of victory (40 points) in an ArenaBowl.

In 2015, the Rattlers went 14–4 in the regular season and made it to the Conference Championships but lost to the San Jose Sabercats 70–67, a team which had twice beaten them in the regular season. This ended their streak of consecutive ArenaBowl appearances at four.

In 2016, the Rattlers went 13–3 in the regular season, then blew out the Portland Steel and the Cleveland Gladiators en route to their fifth ArenaBowl appearance in six years, only to lose to the Philadelphia Soul.

====IFL (2017–present)====
On October 17, 2016, the Rattlers announced they had left the AFL and joined the Indoor Football League (IFL) for the 2017 season. Owner Ron Shurts said that it was possible that the AFL would have to go on hiatus in 2017, and wasn&#x27;t sure the fans would return in 2018 if that happened. The move made Phoenix by far the largest market in the IFL. They made their IFL debut on February 17, 2017, at the defending six-time IFL Champions Sioux Falls Storm, but lost 40–29. On June 24, 2017, the Rattlers faced the Nebraska Danger in the Intense Conference Championship and won 62–36. They defeated the reigning champion Sioux Falls Storm 50–41 in the 2017 United Bowl on July 8, 2017.

On April 29, 2018, the Rattlers defeated the Cedar Rapids Titans 84–83 and earned their 300th win in franchise history. The Rattlers would go on to qualify for the 2018 playoffs, but lost to the Sioux Falls Storm in the Semifinals.

In 2019, the Rattlers went undefeated throughout the regular season, finishing with a 14–0 record. At the end of the season, their playoff games were moved to Gila River Arena (now Desert Diamond Arena) after the Talking Stick Resort Arena closed for renovations. The Rattlers lost (56-53) to the Sioux Falls Storm in the 2019 United Bowl, with coach Guy heavily blaming officiating. With Talking Stick Resort Arena planned to be closed through the 2020 season and possibly into the 2021 season, the Rattlers agreed to a lease at Gila River Arena in the interim. 

After their 2020 season was canceled during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 season was pushed back, the Rattlers announced they would be returning to downtown Phoenix for their 2021 season home games at Footprint Center, formerly known as Talking Stick Resort Arena.

In 2021, the Rattlers finished the regular season with a league best (12-2) record and entered the post season as the IFL&#x27;s highest seed. They qualified for the 2021 United Bowl, advancing past their rivals, the  Sioux Falls Storm &amp; Duke City Gladiators. However, they would end up losing in overtime to the Massachusetts Pirates. 

After suffering their 2nd straight championship defeat, The Rattlers were determined to finish the 2022 season with much better results. They qualified for the post season once again, finishing the regular season as the top ranked seed in the Western Conference at (13-3). They advanced to the semifinals, but fell short yet again. They wound up losing to their in state rivals, and the eventual league champion  Northern Arizona Wranglers.

The Rattlers entered their 2023 season, still chasing that elusive 7th franchise championship. They finished atop the Western Conference standings for the 2nd consecutive season with an (11-4) record. They lost in the playoffs again to the Northern Arizona Wranglers, this time in the opening round.

On November 6, 2023, it was announced that the Rattlers would be moving to Desert Diamond Arena, after originally planning to play there in 2020. 

The Rattlers entered their 2024 offseason with much uncertainty. Five consecutive seasons without winning a championship resulted in heavy scrutiny of both Head coach Kevin Guy &amp; his quarterback Drew Powell. Fans began questioning the duo&#x27;s ability to finish in the playoffs. As a result, a major change was made. Coach Guy traded away his star quarterback to their in state rivals, the  Tucson Sugar Skulls. In doing so, he filled the void at QB by acquiring local valley talent &amp; current IFL Championship MVP Dalton Sneed from the defending 2023 champion Bay Area Panthers. The Rattlers took a gamble and began their 2024 season with a new leader under center. However, injuries plagued the team through the first four weeks, as they started the year with a disappointing 1-3 record. Fortunately, as the team grew healthier, so did their confidence. The Rattlers battled back throughout the year and finished the regular season with an (11-5) record. 

They entered the playoffs as the number three seed in the Western Conference. A tightly contested first round matchup against the two seeded  Vegas Knight Hawks resulted in a come from behind (39-38) road victory on the very last play of the game. Following the win, Coach Kevin Guy became the winningest coach in arena/indoor football history with 262 victories on July 27, 2024. The Rattlers advanced &amp; hosted the 2024 Western Conference Championship, thanks to the  San Diego Strike Force upsetting the top seeded Bay Area Panthers the week before. Arizona took full advantage, blowing out the visiting Strike Force (58-23) and securing the Western Conference crown. With the win, the Rattlers qualified for the 2024 IFL National Championship Game (known formerly as the United Bowl) at Lee&#x27;s Family Forum in Henderson, Nevada. They faced off against the Eastern Conference Champion Massachusetts Pirates once again. This time, they would not be denied their quest for a seventh franchise championship. The Rattlers blew out the Pirates, shutting them out 29-0 in the first half, and winning the game (53-16). Following their historic win, the Rattlers avenged their previous United Bowl defeat to Massachusetts and secured their 7th team championship as the 2024 IFL Champions. Davonte Merriweather was named the game&#x27;s MVP with 3 key interceptions.

<doc id="328038" wikidata="Q1881437" url="?curid=328038" title="MGM Records">
<text>MGM Records was a record label founded by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio in 1946 for the purpose of releasing soundtrack recordings (later LP albums) of their musical films. It transitioned into a pop music label that continued into the 1970s. The company also released soundtrack albums of the music for some of their non-musical films as well, and on rare occasions, cast albums of off-Broadway musicals such as &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; and the 1954 revival of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. In one instance, MGM Records released the highly successful soundtrack album of a film made by another studio, Columbia Pictures&#x27;s &quot;Born Free&quot; (1966).

== Background ==
There was also a short-lived Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Records of 1928, which produced recordings of music featured in MGM movies, not sold to the general public but made to be played in movie theater lobbies. These Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer records were manufactured under contract with the studio by Columbia Records.

== History ==
=== Soundtrack albums ===
Their first soundtrack was of &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot;, a 1946 film based on the life of composer Jerome Kern. It was the first soundtrack album of a live-action film originally issued as a set of four 10-inch 78-rpm records. As in many early MGM soundtrack albums, only eight selections from the film were included on the original version of the album. In order to fit the songs onto the record sides the musical material needed editing and manipulation. This was before tape existed, so the record producer needed to copy segments from the playback discs used on set, then copy and re-copy them from one disc to another, adding transitions and cross-fades until the final master was created. Needless to say, it was several generations removed from the original and the sound quality suffered. Also, the playback recordings were purposely recorded very &quot;dry&quot; (without reverberation) otherwise it would come across as too hollow sounding in large movie theaters. This made these albums sound flat and boxy.

MGM Records called these &quot;original cast albums&quot; in the style of Decca&#x27;s Broadway show cast albums. They also coined the phrase &quot;recorded directly from the soundtrack&quot;. Over the years the term &quot;soundtrack&quot; began to be commonly applied to any recording from a film, whether taken from the actual film soundtrack or re-recorded. The phrase is also sometimes incorrectly used for Broadway cast recordings.

Among MGM&#x27;s most successful soundtrack albums were those of the films &quot;Good News&quot; (the 1947 version), &quot;Easter Parade&quot;, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Show Boat&quot; (the 1951 version), &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;, and &quot;Gigi&quot;. When the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was first shown on television in 1956 (by CBS), the label issued a soundtrack album of songs and dialog excerpts recorded directly from the film, as they had done with their LP of music and dialog from &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; in 1951. &quot;Aba Daba Honeymoon&quot;, performed by Debbie Reynolds and Carleton Carpenter in the film &quot;Two Weeks With Love&quot;, became the first soundtrack single to become a national hit, selling a million copies and charting at No. 3.

By 1950, magnetic tape had been perfected for recording use. This markedly improved the sound quality on long play (LP) albums from 1951 forward.

MGM Records also issued albums of film scores, including &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;King of Kings&quot;, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, the 1967 simulated-stereo 70mm re-release of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. The &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and &quot;King of Kings&quot; albums were studio recreations of the scores, but done with the original orchestrations, while &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; albums were the genuine soundtracks. MGM Records also released a second soundtrack album of &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, this one containing only music from the film.

Beginning in the 1990s, authentic soundtrack albums of the musical scores to &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and &quot;King of Kings&quot; became available. The Rhino Records editions of these albums featured literally the entire scores, including outtakes. Rhino also released a full-length two-disc album of the score of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, recorded from the soundtrack in the original mono.

As in the case of the non-musical films, Rhino Records, which obtained the rights to the MGM soundtracks (owned by Turner Entertainment Co.) in the 1990s, issued longer versions of their movie musical albums, containing virtually all of the songs and music. Rhino&#x27;s license expired at the end of 2011 and the albums Rhino issued were deleted. Warner Bros. now owns the MGM soundtracks first issued by MGM Records and Warner Bros.&#x27; WaterTower Music unit now has the rights to release the MGM soundtracks.

=== Record manufacturing ===
MGM operated their own record manufacturing plant at Bloomfield, New Jersey, from 1947 until 1972; pressing not only their own records but a great deal of sub-contract work for other record companies, including Atlantic Records. For several years in the late 1940s-early 1950s, MGM operated a radio syndication business, producing &quot;The MGM Theater of the Air&quot; and a variety of other series based on inactive movie properties such as &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, Andy Hardy, Maisie, and &quot;Crime Does Not Pay&quot;. The MGM record pressing plant also manufactured the electrical transcriptions used to distribute the shows to local stations. The record manufacturing division was closed when MGM Records was sold to PolyGram; after which MGM&#x27;s former competitors began manufacturing records issued by MGM.

=== As a pop label ===
In the early 1950s, MGM Records was considered one of the &quot;major&quot; record companies (besides Columbia, RCA Victor, Decca/Coral, Capitol and Mercury) due to owning its own manufacturing facilities. Subsidiary Cub Records was launched in the late 1950s and Verve Records (predominately a Jazz label) was acquired from Norman Granz in December 1960. Other MGM subsidiaries and distributed labels included: Kama Sutra (from 1965 until Kama Sutra&#x27;s sister label Buddah Records took over distribution in 1969), Ava, Heritage, Lion and Metro (for budget albums), Leo (children&#x27;s records), Hickory, MGM South, Pride, CoBurt, L&amp;R, and Lionel.

MGM moved successfully into the rock and roll era with many hit records by Connie Francis, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, the Animals, the Cowsills, Lou Christie, the Osmonds, and Cub-subsidiary singer Jimmy Jones, whose hits were on MGM in the UK. Pre-rock pop singer Joni James and country singer Conway Twitty also scored hits on the rock and roll charts. James&#x27; &quot;There Goes My Heart&quot; in 1958 was promoted as the first 45 rpm record to be released in stereophonic sound. Although it was the first stereo single to come out of the major record companies, edging out the RCA Victor release of Perry Como&#x27;s &quot;Love Makes the World Go &#x27;Round&quot; by mere days, the single was issued in September 1958, while the first overall 45 rpm records to be released in stereophonic sound were issued by Bel Canto Records in June 1958.

MGM also distributed Cameo-Parkway Records briefly in 1967. Four albums and two singles were released under this arrangement before Allen Klein bought the Cameo-Parkway catalog and renamed the label ABKCO.

Another label distributed by MGM was American International Records, the record label division of American International Pictures, whose film library is now owned by MGM.

=== Country music ===
MGM Records&#x27; first president Frank Walker discovered and signed Hank Williams who became the linchpin of MGM Records&#x27; country music operations. Other notable MGM artists of this genre include Hank Williams Jr., Sheb Wooley, Conway Twitty, Sandy Posey, Marvin Rainwater, Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith, Roy Acuff, Carolina Cotton, Jimmy Newman, Mel Tillis, Marie Osmond, Jim Stafford and C.W. McCall.

=== Classical music ===
MGM Records issued music of a variety of musical genres, but used the same set of catalog numbers. The label also offered a modest catalog of classical recordings beginning in 1951; among them was catalog number E3711, an account of two sonatas by Franz Schubert, billed as the first in a complete cycle, recorded by pianist Beveridge Webster. In 1962, MGM Records picked up American distribution of the prestigious German classical music label Deutsche Grammophon Records. The arrangement lasted until 1969 when Polydor Records established its American office.

=== Sale to PolyGram and phase out ===
MGM Records was sold to PolyGram in 1972. As part of the deal, PolyGram received perpetual rights to the &quot;MGM Records&quot; name and a ten-year license to use the MGM trademark and logo. In 1976, MGM Records, including its artists, was absorbed into PolyGram&#x27;s Polydor Records. However, PolyGram continued releasing MGM soundtrack albums and reissues using the MGM Records imprint until 1982.

With PolyGram&#x27;s abandonment of the MGM Records trademark, MGM was able to reclaim its rights to that trademark in 1997.

The MGM Records catalog is now split. Although the first three entities remain under the aegis of Universal Music Group, the pop music catalog is managed by Universal Music Enterprises and bears the Polydor imprint, with distribution in North America by Republic Records, the musical theater catalog is now released by Decca Broadway, and the country music catalog is managed by Universal Music Group Nashville with reissues bearing the Mercury Records Nashville imprint.

MGM&#x27;s film soundtracks are owned by Warner Bros. Entertainment via its WaterTower Music unit and the catalogs of a few other artists also have new owners. Frank Zappa regained control of his MGM/Verve recordings (including those with his group the Mothers of Invention) in mid 1977 after two years of negotiations. Zappa later licensed the recordings to Rykodisc, starting in 1987. In 2012, Gail Zappa licensed her deceased husband&#x27;s catalogue to Universal Music Enterprises.

=== MGM Music ===
In 1986, MGM formed MGM Music for the licensing of music of which MGM owns the rights. It focuses on licensing soundtracks. It manages the music and music publishing rights of MGM films from 1986 and beyond. (Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s Turner Entertainment unit owns the pre-1986 MGM soundtracks.) It also manages the music and music publishing rights of United Artists and Orion films.

<doc id="328051" wikidata="Q2603547" url="?curid=328051" title="New York Dragons">
<text>The New York Dragons were a professional arena football team based in the New York metropolitan area. The Dragons participated in the Arena Football League&#x27;s (AFL) National Conference as a member of the Eastern Division. The team was founded in as the original iteration of the Iowa Barnstormers, and relocated to New York in . They played in New York until 2008, when the league folded. They played in the Eastern Division of the National Conference, and played their home games at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York. Their last coach was Weylan Harding.

==History==
The team was based in suburban Uniondale, New York at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, former home to the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League. The team&#x27;s mascot was Sparky the Dragon, who is also mascot for the New York Islanders.

===Iowa Barnstormers (1995–2000)===

The franchise played in Des Moines, Iowa from 1995 to , as the Iowa Barnstormers. The team had been successful in Iowa, having reached the ArenaBowl in and . From 1995 to 1997, the team&#x27;s starting quarterback was Kurt Warner, who moved up to the National Football League in and became an NFL MVP and Super Bowl winning quarterback.

The need for a more modern venue as well as the league&#x27;s desire for a larger market led to the move to the New York City area, despite two failed past attempts in the region: the New York Knights () and the New York CityHawks (–), both of which played at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. The team was purchased by Charles Wang, who was also the Islanders&#x27; majority owner.

The Arena Football organization did award an af2 franchise to Iowa for the season also called the Barnstormers, but that team folded after that season (only to be brought back in 2008). The Barnstormers were noted for their unique uniforms, which in keeping with the aviation theme included the depiction of goggles on the helmets, wings on the shoulders of the jerseys, and propellers on the pants legs. The primary figures in the original Iowa organization were Jim Foster, the inventor of Arena Football, and Kurt Warner, the quarterback who went on to play for the St. Louis Rams and win both the NFL MVP and Super Bowl XXXIV MVP.

Aside from the league&#x27;s desire to re-enter the New York market, another major reason cited for the team&#x27;s relocation was the inadequacy of their Des Moines venue, the Iowa Veterans Memorial Auditorium, also known as &quot;The Barn&quot;. Most of the seats in this venue were located directly along the sidelines as is typical of high school sports venues. The Barnstormers organization constantly lobbied for the construction of a better facility during their time in Des Moines, to no avail.

In 2005, the Wells Fargo Arena opened in Des Moines, directly across from what the locals call &quot;Vets&quot;, as part of the newly expanded Iowa Events Center. A new Barnstormers af2 franchise began play there in the season.

===New York Dragons (2001–2008)===
On November 1, 2000, it was announced that the Iowa Barnstormers had relocated to New York as the Dragons. The Dragons&#x27; logo and uniforms were designed by Chris Trevas who is a full-time Star Wars artist. Nassau Coliseum, where the franchise relocated, is generally regarded as one of the most marginal venues currently used in major American professional sports, and is often proposed for replacement, so the improvement of the situation with regards to a venue has been fairly minimal to this point. In late September 2004, Islanders&#x27; ownership announced an ambitious project to renovate the Coliseum, surrounding it with housing units and construction of an adjacent tower, resembling a lighthouse, at a total cost of over $200 million (US). Since then, the lighthouse has been taken out of the design plan.

The New York Dragons had competed in the Eastern Division of the National Conference. They were coached by former Barnstormer defensive back Weylan Harding. In the 2006 season Weylan Harding became the winningest Arena Football league coach in his first two seasons as a coach, winning twenty games throughout the 2005 and seasons.

The Dragons had one of the biggest stars in the Arena Football League, in quarterback Aaron Garcia. Garcia has the honor of most touchdown passes in a game (11), and second most touchdown passes in a season (104 in 2001). Through his 10-year career, he has thrown over 800 touchdown passes.

The Dragons set the league record for most points in a game, scoring 99 against the Carolina Cobras on July 7, 2001, surpassing the previous record of 91, which had been set by the New Jersey Red Dogs in 1997 against the Texas Terror. It also set a record for the most points scored in one game (167).

On Saturday, February 11, 2006, the Dragons won against the expansion team Utah Blaze 84–81 on the road and they made AFL history for the second-most points scored in one game with 165.

On July 8, 2008 a group of investors, led by Steve Silva, announced they are buying the team from Charles Wang. With the purchase the team would change its uniforms, logo, and colors. The team also announced that the Dragons will continue to play in the Nassau Coliseum despite rumors that the Dragons would move to Manhattan and play their games at Madison Square Garden.

On September 23, 2008, the Dragons announced their new logo and color scheme. The old colors of red and yellow were replaced by green and grey.

The Dragons official mascot was a dragon named Sparky, who is also the mascot of the NHL&#x27;s New York Islanders.

On December 14, 2008, the Arena Football League announced it would cancel the 2009 season, but hoped to return in 2010.

On July 20, 2009, Sports Business Journal reported that the AFL owed approximately $14 million to its creditors and were considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Owners were also exploring the expansion franchise in Pittsburgh in order to use the expansion fees to help pay off the debts and infuse enough cash into the league to hold the 2010 season. In early August 2009, numerous media outlets began reporting that the AFL was folding permanently and would file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The league released a statement on August 4 announcing that while the league is not folding, it is suspending league operations indefinitely. Several teams commented that they were still pursuing arena football in 2010 with the possibility of using the financially independent arenafootball2. Despite this, several of the league&#x27;s creditors have filed papers to force a Chapter 7 liquidation if the league does not do so voluntarily. This request was granted on August 7, though converted to a Chapter 11 reorganization on August 26.

Less than two months after the announcement, and a few weeks after the suspension forced the dissolution of af2, the Arizona Rattlers and Orlando Predators defected to Arena Football 1, a startup league consisting mostly of former af2 teams. The 16-team league expects to expand to &quot;24 to 30&quot; teams prior to the start of their inaugural 2010 season, and is in negotiations with at least seven other teams from the AFL to join, including the Tampa Bay Storm and the San Jose SaberCats. The New York Dragons are not to be part of AF1.

===New version, new league (2025)===
A new version of the New York Dragons was launched as members of the newly-created Entertainment Football Association, based on the east coast, on February 21, 2025. This Dragons team is &quot;not&quot; linked to the former AFL team.

==Historic moments==
* On Saturday, July 7, 2001, in a Week 13 home game against the Carolina Cobras, QB Aaron Garcia has a prolific performance. He would throw a league-best 11 touchdown passes in the highest scoring game in league history. The Dragons would win the game 99–68. This is at #11 on the AFL&#x27;s 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown.
* On June 2, 2007, Aaron Garcia became only the fourth man to ever record 800 touchdown passes. He joins the list with Clint Dolezel, Sherdrick Bonner, and Andy Kelly.
* On June 28, 2008, the Dragons, making the postseason even after finishing the season 8–8 (fourth in the National Eastern Division), went on to defeat the favored Dallas Desperados in the wild card round of the playoffs. Dallas finished second in the National Eastern Division with the record of 12–4, yet fell to an underdog New York team 77–63. They would go on to lose to the Philadelphia Soul in the following round, 49–48 on a last second touchdown pass that replays showed to be a questionable call.

<doc id="328065" wikidata="Q496681" url="?curid=328065" title="Ebetsu">
<text>is a city in Ishikari Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan.

== History ==
Ebetsu was settled originally by Japanese people in 1871, who came from the Miyagi Prefecture on Honshu. In 1878, tondenhei began moving into the area. When the Meiji Government, in 1878, designated Hokkaido as part of Japan, settlers began to flood the area. Ebetsu earned township status in 1916 and city status in 1954. During the 1960s and 1970s, a burgeoning population in Sapporo caused the population in Ebetsu to concurrently boom. In 1991, the city reached 100,000 people.

The name Ebetsu is derived from the Ainu name of the Chitose River which flows into the Ishikari River in the city. According to John Batchelor in his &quot;An Ainu-English Dictionary&quot; (chapter 1, section V: Place Names Considered) the Ainu language name was E-pet or &quot;humour river&quot; based on its murky colour. 

== Demographics ==
As of July 31, 2023, the city had an estimated population of 118,764, with 56,325 households, and a population density of 634 persons per km². The total area is 187.38 km².

== Geography and transportation ==
The majority of commercial Ebetsu is on or immediately surrounding Route 12 (runs north-south through town). The northern limits of town are delineated by the Ishikari River, the southern sub-city of Oasa by Ebetsu&#x27;s boundary with Sapporo. It bounds the city limits of Kitahiroshima, Iwamizawa, Nanporo, Tōbetsu, and Shinshinotsu.

Ebetsu is about 16 km from downtown Sapporo. It is accessed by the Hokkaido Expressway, by Chūō or JR Hokkaidō bus lines, or by the Asahikawa-Hakodate train line that approximately follows Route 12 through town (at Oasa, Nopporo, Takasago, and Ebetsu stations), joining with the northwest-southeast running main line that extends from Chitose Airport to Sapporo Station in Shinsapporo (New Sapporo, a district of larger metropolitan Sapporo).

The extensive Nopporo Forest State Park (the world&#x27;s largest park of virgin forest on level ground) is behind Ebetsu&#x27;s Rakunō Gakuen University (the first university in Ebetsu, founded in 1949), encompassing 2015 hectares of preserved forest. Because of Ebetsu&#x27;s location approximately in the middle of the Ishikari Plain (Sapporo city is the southwestern extent), it is known for having wind year-round.

== Climate ==
The 10-year average temperature for Ebetsu is 7.1 degrees Celsius. The hottest and coldest temperatures, respectively, ever recorded are and .

He may looked sad because of his tears (which is his charm point), he is actually happy. Whenever something wonderful happens (e.g. farmers working hard, witnessing children, falling leaves, etc.), he will shed tears for joy. He is known for carrying a grain ear. He likes locally grown wheat. When he was first revealed back in 2011, he was genderless. He is originally an unofficial mascot until it is chosen by the local tourism association to represent the city.

<doc id="328066" wikidata="Q1656420" url="?curid=328066" title="Robert Browne Hall">
<text>Robert Browne Hall (30 June 1858 Bowdoinham, Maine – 8 June 1907), usually known as R. B. Hall, was a leading composer of marches and other music for wind bands. A principal American composer of marching music, he was born in Bowdoinham, Maine and seldom left his native state during his lifetime, dying in Portland. His music though has traveled around the world. He is particularly popular in the United Kingdom, so much so that many lovers of brass band music there mistakenly imagine that Hall is an English composer. His celebrated &quot;Tenth Regiment March&quot;, written in 1895 and dedicated to the Tenth Regiment Band in Albany, New York, is a well-known staple of brass band concerts and competitions all over the UK, under the title &quot;Death or Glory&quot;.

Hall was famous during his lifetime as a particularly fine player on the cornet and served for a time as conductor of the Bangor Band. As soloist, conductor, composer and teacher, Hall is still remembered in Maine. The last Saturday in June every year is officially Robert Browne Hall Day in the State of Maine.

Hall suffered a stroke in 1902 from which he never recovered. He died in poverty in Portland as a result of nephritis five years later, and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Richmond, Maine. His widow sold the manuscripts of many compositions. Unscrupulous publishers assembled and realized from fragments works they passed off as genuine Hall compositions.

== List of compositions ==
He left over a hundred marches and other compositions, including such classics as:

*&quot;Officer of the Day March&quot;
*&quot;Canton Halifax March&quot;
*&quot;Independentia March&quot;
*&quot;New Colonial March&quot;
*&quot;Tenth Regiment March (Death or Glory)&quot;
*&quot;Gardes du Corps March&quot;
*&quot;Albanian March&quot;
*&quot;American Cadet March&quot;
*&quot;Charge of the Battalion&quot;
*&quot;Colonel Fitch March&quot;
*&quot;Colonel Philbrook March&quot;
*&quot;The Commander March&quot;
*&quot;Commonwealth March&quot;
*&quot;Dunlap Commandery March&quot;
*&quot;Fort Popham March&quot;
*&quot;Greeting to Bangor March&quot;
*&quot;Hamlin Rifles March&quot;
*&quot;Marche Funebre&quot;
*&quot;Norembega March&quot;
*&quot;S.I.B.A. March&quot;
*&quot;Second Regiment P.M. March&quot;
*&quot;Veni, Vidi, Vici March&quot;
*&quot;W.M.B. March&quot;

==In popular culture==
The trio from Hall&#x27;s &quot;New Colonial March&quot; provides the music for Stanford University&#x27;s official fight song, &quot;Come Join the Band&quot;.

The trio from Hall&#x27;s &quot;Officer of the Day March&quot; provides the melody for the Alma Mater of Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota.

His March &quot;Death or Glory&quot;, 1895 is the music in the opening scene of the 1996 comedy-drama film about a Yorkshire coal-miner&#x27;s band, &quot;Brassed Off&quot;.

<doc id="328079" wikidata="Q733979" url="?curid=328079" title="Eniwa, Hokkaido">
<text>is a city in Ishikari Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan. It is on the Ishikari plain, 8 km north of Chitose, and 26 km south of the prefectural capital Sapporo. It is reached through route 36 and the Chitose Railway Line. The town is separated into three major areas: Eniwa in the south, Megumino in the center, and Shimamatsu in the north.

Many farms are located around Eniwa, and the town has many manufacturing businesses, including the Sapporo Brewery Hokkaido factory. There are three Japan Ground Self-Defense Force camps in the city.

Eniwa&#x27;s 2023 population of 70,278 makes it the fourth largest city in the Ishikari Subprefecture, and the 13th largest in Hokkaido.

== Etymology ==
The town&#x27;s name is taken from the nearby Mount Eniwa, in the Shikotsu-Tōya National Park. The name in Ainu, &quot;e-en-iwa&quot; (), means &quot;sharp mountain.&quot; The name was transliterated into Japanese ateji to mean &quot;blessed garden&quot;. The Japanese transliteration was chosen because of the homonyms and , the later referring to the two rivers that pass through the city, the Shimamatsu River and the Izari River, as well as the between the two rivers.

== History ==
The first known settlement of Eniwa was in the Initial Jōmon period in 7000 BC, at the . The settlement received a surge of people in 2000 B, and continued being settled for many years. Many artifacts have been found, including lacquered combs, beads, earthenware and stone accessories. Historical Satsumon culture (700–1200 CE) graves dating have been found around Eniwa, at the . The style is similar to those at the Ebetsu Kofun Site and northern Tōhoku historic graves. During the Ainu settlement period (1200 CE until the Meiji era), there is historical evidence for settlements in the villages and further away on the plains.

After the Matsumae clan settled on the southern tip of Hokkaido in 1590, they traded goods with the Ainu who lived in the area. In the Edo period, one of the 13 trading locations across the Ishikari plain was (Ainu: Shuma-o-mappu ()), which corresponds to the modern-day Shimamatsu River basin. The trading area was active until the end of the Edo era. Early Japanese contact with the area included in 1755, when jezo spruce trees were harvested along the Izari river, and in 1805, when the river was farmed for salmon and trout.

In 1857, the Hakodate magistrate decreed that a road between Otaru and Chitose be developed, leading to the development of the Ishikari Plain. When Hokkaido became a part of Japan in the early Meiji period, the area around Eniwa was incorporated into Iburi Province in 1869.

Settlers from Kōchi Prefecture initially settled in Eniwa in 1870 in two villages: in the south and in the north. In 1873, the , the a road linking Hakodate with Sapporo was completed, and it was built through both villages. In 1873, rice farming started in Shimamatsu, as well as the first postal service.

In 1880, the Chitose town hall began administering five surrounding villages to Chitose, including Izari and Shimamatsu. In 1886, 65 families from Waki, Yamaguchi and Iwakuni, Yamaguchi moved to the shores of the Izari river, which greatly increased the size of Izari. A year later, the Izari town hall was built, meaning Chitose no longer administered Izari or Shimamatsu. At this point, Eniwa had grown to 572 residents, and the first elementary school was opened. Shinto shrines were constructed in 1901: Toyosaka Shrine in Izari and Shimamatsu Shrine. The Buddhist temple Ten&#x27;yū-ji&#x27;s main building was constructed in 1904.

In 1906, Izari and Shimamatsu were merged to form , a second class municipality. The village also administered Hiroshima Village; in 1943 the village seceded. In 1922, the village received electricity, after the Izari River was used for hydroelectric power. By 1923, the town had grown enough to become a first class municipality. Eniwa was first connected to by rail in 1926, after the Sapporo Line (now known as the Chitose Line) was completed, and Eniwa Station and Shimamatsu Station were opened.

In the 1930s, Eniwa became a site for mining gold and silver. In 1935, a small-scale private mine called the was opened in 1935 and run by the Fujita company. In 1939, the nationally run opened. A mining town to the north-northwest of Mount Eniwa was constructed, and Kōryū Mine was expanded. The town featured around 40 five-family apartments and additional buildings for administration and amenities, however, no restaurants or entertainment areas were constructed. Two elementary schools were operated for the area. Both mines were closed in 1943, due to the Order for Gold Mine Consolidation. By the end of the Eniwa Mine&#x27;s operations, a total of 700 kg of gold and 3,500 kg of silver had been mined. The mines and buildings were dismantled, though the Kōryū Mine was reopened in 1949 by Yutani Mining.

After the Occupation of Japan beginning in 1945, many agricultural reforms were undertaken that made the farms around Eniwa more prosperous. In September 1950, a military camp for training police personnel was built in Kashiwagi. In 1951, Company C, 52d Infantry Regiment (Anti-Tank) of the United States Army held military practices at the camp. When the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force&#x27;s Northern Army was established in 1952, they took over running the camp and established the South Eniwa Camp in 1952.

By 1951, the village&#x27;s population was significant enough to be upgraded to a town. In 1970 after the town had 34,500 residents, it was upgraded to Eniwa City, after a piece of regional legislation allowed Eniwa, Noboribetsu and later Date to become cities. In 1979, part of the farmland between Eniwa and Shimamatsu was developed into Megumino, a new suburb of the city. By 1982, the Megumino Station was built, along with the Ito-Yokado shopping center and the Megumino Elementary School.

In 1987, residents exceeded 50,000. The Sapporo Brewery Hokkaido factory was built in the south of Eniwa in 1989, and a dedicated train station, the Sapporo Beer Teien Station was built in 1990. In 1993, residents in Eniwa exceeded 60,000.

In 2006, Eniwa&#x27;s first community radio station began broadcast. It was originally called , but the name was changed to &quot;E-Niwa&quot; in 2010.

In April 2013, construction began on , a housing development in east Megumino. The first houses were completed in May 2013, with the entire area expected to be completed in 2015. The development of 25 hectares west of Megumino Station is being planned. Development consent was given in July 2011.

== Demographics ==
As of July 31, 2023 the city had an estimated population of 70,278 residents, with 31,005 households and the density of 239 persons per km2. 51% of the population is female. Eniwa&#x27;s population is 99.7% Japanese, with the remaining 0.3% being foreign residents. 13.8% of residents are under 15 years of age, and the workforce comprises 64.4% of residents. 21.8% of people are over age 65. In the 2012 population records, 22 residents are listed as centenarians.

The bulk of the population, 68%, lives in central Eniwa, while 17.5% live in Megumino and 13.2% live in Shimamatsu. The remainder 1.3% of Eniwa residents live in the surrounding farmland.

== Geography and climate ==
Eniwa is on the Ishikari Plain, amongst farmland. The town is 8 km from Chitose (and the New Chitose Airport), and to the north is Kitahiroshima City. 26 km north of Eniwa is Sapporo, the largest city and prefectural capital of Hokkaido. All of these cities are connected by the Chitose Line railway and by the Japan National Route 36. The town is on the Izari River and the Shimamatsu River.

The area administered to by Eniwa extends north to the Shimamatsu river and stops at the border to Naganuma township in Sorachi Subprefecture. Eniwa borders Chitose city along its south border, with the cities being separated by as little as 750 m in some places. To the west of Eniwa is the Shikotsu-Tōya National Park. Eight mountains in the park are considered a part of Eniwa, including Mount Izari and Mount Soranuma. In the area is the hydroelectric Izarigawa Dam that dams the Izari river.

The city of Eniwa is separated into three major areas: Eniwa in the south, in the center and Shimamatsu in the north. Shimamatsu is separated from Eniwa and Megumino by approximately 300 meters.

Winters in Eniwa are colder than the surrounding areas, due to the town being inland. The average daily low temperature is between 5-6 degrees lower than Sapporo, 26 km to the north near the Sea of Japan, and 4-5 degrees lower than in Tomakomai, 28 km to the south on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Summers are slightly milder than in Sapporo.

== Economy ==
Traditionally, Eniwa&#x27;s economy was based around farming, with the first major rice farms created in 1873. Eniwa has two main crops: flowers and rice. 3,800ha of land are dedicated to flowers, most of which are cut flowers. 2,700 ha of land are dedicated to rice farming, mostly ley farming, though paddy field rice exists. Rice in Eniwa is generally made up of the &quot;Yume Pirika&quot;, &quot;Nanatsu Boshi&quot;, &quot;Oborozuki&quot; and &quot;Fukkurinko&quot;.

Eniwa also grows many vegetables. Vegetables with 100 ha or more dedicated space include wheat, soybeans, sugar beet, potatoes and daikon (Japanese radish). Other farmed vegetables include ebisu kabocha pumpkins, carrots, adzuki beans and cabbages. The ebisu kabocha is the city vegetable. Pumpkin-flavored soft serve, manjū and soup can be bought at the Flower Road Eniwa roadside station.

In the Heisei era, manufacturing has increasingly become an important industry. In 1989, an area in southern Eniwa became dedicated to manufacture, called the . In the same year, the Sapporo Brewery Hokkaido factory was built. It deals with 120 million liters of beer per year. There are many food production factories are in Eniwa, including ones for Sanmaruko, the restaurant chain Tonden, oden producer Horikawa, Hoshio Milk, Yamazaki Baking, Kibun Foods and Robapan. Morinaga Milk Industry built its Sapporo Factory in Eniwa in 1961; in April 2013 it halted all manufacturing there, leaving the site as a delivery depot.

There are mechanical factories for Sanwa Holdings, MSK Farm Machinery, Mitsubishi&#x27;s customized machinery division and Oji Paper.

Three camps for the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force&#x27;s Northern Army are in Eniwa — Camp Shimamatsu, Camp Kita Eniwa, and Camp Minami Eniwa — where the Northern Army performs military exercises, including the 1st Tank Group&#x27;s tank practice.

== Religion ==
There are a variety of Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines and Christian churches in Eniwa. Most of the institutions were established in the Meiji period. The most recent Shinto shrine was built in 1908.

There are seven Buddhist temples in Eniwa. The largest is Ten&#x27;yū-ji, an Otani-ha temple established in 1886. Daian-ji was initially established as a terakoya school for the children of Eniwa in 1887, but grew to be a temple in 1911. The Eniwa Buddhist temples follow a variety of schools. Two of the temples are Otani-ha, two are Hongan-ji, Kōryū-ji is a Kompira worshiping Kōyasan Shingon-shū temple, Daian-ji is Sōtō and Myōshō-ji is Nichiren Shū.

There are four Shinto shrines around Eniwa. Toyosaka Shrine was first established in 1874 as an area dedicated to Inari Ōkami, with a small shrine for Ōkuninushi built at the site in 1891. A second shrine, built to accommodate settlers from Toyama and Ishikawa. Shimamatsu Shrine was established in 1901 from donations from the people who lived in Shimamatsu. The fourth, Kashiwagi Shrine, was established in 1908. Much of the shrine was demolished in 1982 due to dilapidation. In Eniwa, there are six Shinto gods who have been enshrined: Toyouke-Ōmikami (at Toyosaka and Shimamatsu), Ōkuninushi (at Toyosaka), Amenominakanushi (at Kashiwagi) and Amaterasu, Inari Ōkami and Kasuga Ōkami at Eniwa Shrine.

There are three Christian churches in Eniwa, the Catholic Eniwa Parish, Eniwa Evangelical Christian Church and the Eniwa Evangelical Lutheran church. In addition, there is a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness church, as well as a church for the Chitose and Eniwa ward of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

== Parks and recreation ==
Eniwa has five public parks: Eniwa Park, Nakajima Park, Furusato Park, Megumino Central Park and Technopark Central Park. The parks are mostly around central and southern Eniwa. The largest, Eniwa Park, is 411,000 m2. In addition, the land around the banks of the Izari River is considered urban open space. Parks in Eniwa mostly consist of open spaces and woodland, though several feature sporting facilities, such as Nakajima Park&#x27;s jogging track.

In 2006, an agricultural theme park called Ecorin Village was built in Eniwa. At the gardening center of the theme park is a greenhouse housing , which in November 2013 was awarded the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; award for the largest tomato plant in the world, measuring 85.46m2 at the time.

Within the urban borders of Eniwa are several park golf grounds, a sport created in Hokkaido. Outside of the city, the Eniwa Country Club features three nine-hole golf courses.

In the Shikotsu-Tōya National Park to the west, many of the mountains such as Mount Izari and Mount Soranuma feature walking trails to their summits. The man-made lake is behind the Izari Dam in the national park.

== Education ==
Eniwa has two public high schools, five junior high schools, and eight elementary schools. In 2012, the city had 3,935 students enrolled at elementary schools and 2,079 at junior high schools. In 2008, 300 students were enrolled at Eniwa North High School and 200 at Eniwa South High School.

Eniwa&#x27;s first school was opened in 1887, when Buddhist priest Kyūzō Nakayama established a terakoya for the children of Eniwa. In 1897, the temple school was moved and became a public school, Eniwa Elementary School. Three more elementary schools were opened in the Meiji period. By the early 1940s, Eniwa had eight elementary schools. In 1947, four new junior high schools were created, later amalgamating into two by 1964. The two high schools were opened in 1951. In the 1960s and 1970s, five elementary schools and one junior high school were closed or merged. With the building of Megumino in the late 1970s and increasing growth in the city, three new junior high schools and six new elementary schools were built between 1970 and 1991.

Eniwa has one university and three vocational schools. Hokkaido Bunkyo University&#x27;s main campus is in Eniwa. The university has two departments, foreign languages and health sciences. The three vocational schools are in Megumino. The largest, the Hokkaido High-Technology College, is a multi-discipline school, with four faculties: technology, medicine, education and recovery/sports science. The Hokkaido Eco Communication College is a veterinary school, and the Nihon Fukushi Rehabilitation Gakuin is a physical medicine and rehabilitation school. In addition to these, Kinki University has its Hokkaido seminar house for natural resource research in Eniwa.

== Transportation ==

Eniwa is connected to the Hokkaido Railway network on the Chitose Line. There are four train stations (from north to south): Shimamatsu Station, Megumino Station and Eniwa Station, as well as the electronically manned Sapporo Beer Teien Station. The Eniwa Station is a designated stop for Rapid Airport trains, though not a stop for limited express trains such as the Super Ōzora or the Super Tokachi.

Japan National Route 36 and Japan National Route 453 run through Eniwa. There are two toll express roads through Eniwa, the Hokkaidō Expressway and the Dōtō Expressway which begins at the Chitose-Eniwa junction. There are two bus services in Eniwa. The Hokkaido Chuo Bus transports passengers around Hokkaido and passes through Eniwa. The Eniwa Community Bus was established in 2004 and circuits around Eniwa.

Eniwa is serviced by the New Chitose Airport for air travel, 15 km away. It is an international airport, with destinations mainly in Asia such as Seoul, Shanghai and Taipei. However, the bulk of its traffic is Japanese domestic travelers.

== Community work ==
In the spring and summer, community organisations plant flowers around the city&#x27;s public gardens, leading to the moniker .

==Mascots==

Eniwa&#x27;s mascots are , and .
*Ebisu-kun is an oni that is born from a Kabocha pumpkin. He promotes and protects products from the city. He works as a mascot for the Eniwa Chamber of Commerce and lives in a room of the local conference hall.
*Karin-chan is a yōsei born from a lily of the valley. She protects nature.
*Eniwan is a dog who is a flower enthusiast (as such, she wears a flower as a hat). She helps people who migrate to the city like (who moved from the Southern Hemisphere in September 2013), , and (the latter three are a family who moved from the Western world). Her name not only comes from &quot;anyone&quot; but is also a play on the city&#x27;s name. Her name fits because she welcomes every being around the world to Eniwa.

<text>The Indiana Firebirds were a team in the Arena Football League. The team was based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Home games were played at the Conseco Fieldhouse, also the home of the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association and Indiana Fever of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association.

==History==

===Albany Firebirds (1990–2000)===
The team was founded in Albany, New York as the Albany Firebirds, and played in Albany from 1990 to 2000. At that time, home games were played at the Knickerbocker Arena (now known as the MVP Arena). The team&#x27;s original ownership group was headed by Joe O&#x27;Hara, owner of the Continental Basketball Association&#x27;s Albany Patroons, who would later become the AFL&#x27;s second commissioner. In 2020, he revealed that he originally wanted to call the team the Nighthawks, but league founder Jim Foster wanted that nickname for a future team he planned to own after his tenure as commissioner. After getting off the phone with Foster while in Boston, he happened to see a Pontiac Firebird driving down the highway and decided to go with that name.

The Firebirds were very successful during their tenure in Albany. They won six division titles, made nine playoff appearances, and won the 1999 ArenaBowl championship.

===Indiana Firebirds (2001–2004)===
On October 19, 2000, the Firebirds announced they would be relocating to Indianapolis. After the move, the Firebirds competed in the Central Division of the AFL&#x27;s American Conference. The Firebirds were not as successful in Indianapolis as they were in Albany, missing the playoffs twice in four seasons after having made the playoffs in all but two of their first 11 seasons. 

The 2004 Firebirds just missed the playoffs after a disappointing 0–5 start. However, they finished the season winning eight of their last eleven games and were considered by some a potential contender for the 2005 Arena Bowl championship led by 2004 Rookie of the Year quarterback Zachary Paget.

However, in early September 2004, Firebirds owner Dave Lageschulte announced that his company, Lags Football LLC, would cease all business operations for the Firebirds. Lageschulte had been actively, but unsuccessfully, pursuing local investors to purchase the Firebirds since he had assumed ownership in 2002.

On September 20, 2004, the date of the announced sales deadline, the Arena Football League announced the termination of the Firebirds franchise and that the players would be made available to continuing AFL teams in a dispersal draft. However, within the week the team was purchased by Scott and Todd Hines, who run H3 Sportsgear, a sportsgear company based in Indianapolis. With AFL approval, it was hoped that the Firebirds could remain operational in Indianapolis. However, this bid floundered due to concerns that the low sale price would devalue the worth of the other 18 franchises. The former Firebirds players were made available in the dispersal draft conducted on October 14, 2004, marking the end of one of the AFL&#x27;s longest-running franchises.

===Resurrection of the Albany Firebirds name===

After the move of the Albany Firebirds AFL franchise to Indiana, an AF2 team called the Albany Conquest took to the field to replace the arena football void left by the departure of the Firebirds. After eight seasons and troubles with fielding a winning team in recent seasons, Conquest owner Walter Robb contemplated shutting down the Conquest franchise. Then, on Friday, October 3, 2008, Robb announced the return of the team for the 2009 season but renamed as the Albany Firebirds in the hopes of &quot;re-branding&quot; the team.

Multiple reports in late September 2023 indicated that a team bearing the Albany Firebirds brand would play in the 2024 season. Ownership would not confirm nor deny the reports but stated that there would be an arena football team in Albany in 2024, either in the revived AFL or the Indoor Football League. On October 2, 2023, the Albany Firebirds were officially announced to be joining the AFL.

<doc id="328081" wikidata="Q5283606" url="?curid=328081" title="Disumbrationism">
<text>Disumbrationism was a hoax masquerading as an art movement that was launched in 1924 by Paul Jordan-Smith, a novelist, Latin scholar, and authority on Robert Burton from Los Angeles, California.

Annoyed at the cold reception his wife Sarah Bixby Smith&#x27;s realistic still lifes had received from an art exhibition jury, Jordan-Smith sought revenge by styling himself as &quot;Pavel Jerdanowitch&quot; (Cyrillic: Па́вел Жердaнович), a variation on his own name. Never having picked up a paint brush in his life, he then painted &quot;Yes, we have no bananas&quot;, a blurry, badly painted picture of a Pacific islander woman holding a banana over her head, having just killed a man and putting his skull on a stick. In 1925, Smith entered the banana picture under a new title of &quot;Exaltation&quot; in New York&#x27;s &quot;Exhibition&quot; of the Independents at the Waldorf-Astoria. He made a suitably dark and brooding photograph of himself as Jerdanowitch, and submitted the work to the same group of critics as representative of the new school &quot;Disumbrationism&quot;. He explained &quot;Exaltation&quot; as a symbol of &quot;breaking the shackles of womanhood&quot;. To his amusement, if not to his surprise, the Disumbrationist won praise from the critics who had belittled his wife&#x27;s realistic painting.

More Disumbrationist paintings followed: a composition of zig-zag lines and eyeballs he called &quot;Illumination&quot;; a garish picture of a black woman doing laundry that he called &quot;Aspiration&quot;, and which a critic praised as &quot;a delightful jumble of Gauguin, Pop Hart and Negro minstrelsy, with a lot of Jerdanowitch individuality&quot;; &quot;Gination&quot;, an ugly, lopsided portrait; and a painting named &quot;Adoration&quot;, of a woman worshipping an immense phallic idol, which was exhibited in 1927.

The same year, Jordan-Smith confessed to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that the Disumbrationist paintings were meant as a spoof.

The Fighters had previously played in the Sapporo Dome in Sapporo, but moved to Kita-Hiroshima after disagreements with Sapporo City Consul about Sapporo Dome rental fees and needed upgrades.

The Sapporo-Eniwa Cycle Road follows the route of the decommissioned Chitose Railway Line from Sapporo City to Kitahiroshima, making it suitable for recreational and professional cyclists alike.

Near the Kitahiroshima Classe Hotel, tennis and golf are popular summer activities, while skiing and tobogganing is available in the winter months.

== Mascot ==

Kitahiroshima&#x27;s mascot is is a 10-year-old energetic rice. She is from Shimamatsu, Kitahiroshima (it is the same place where rice farmer Kuzo Nakayama studied the science of cold rice). As a result, she can communicate with not just the ghost of Kuzo Nakayama&#x27;s but also the ghosts of other people. She is the mascot of the Kitahiroshima City Society of Commerce and Industry. However, as a result of her getting a resident card, she became the mascot of the whole city as a whole. She likes running on Elfin Road while researching nature. Though sporty, she does not have fast reflexes. Her hair is her charm point. As red is her favourite colour, she collects red ribbons. She has a sweet tooth, and her favourite sweet is strawberry cream puff.

<text>Mark Eugene Grace (born June 28, 1964) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman who spent 13 seasons with the Chicago Cubs and three seasons with the Arizona Diamondbacks of the National League (NL). He was a member of the 2001 World Series champion Diamondbacks that beat the New York Yankees. Grace batted and threw left-handed; he wore jersey number 28 and 17 during his rookie season of 1988, and he kept number 17 for the remainder of his career.

==Career==
===Amateur career===
Grace played high school baseball and basketball at Tustin High School in Tustin, California. After graduating from high school in 1982, he attended Saddleback College before transferring to San Diego State University to play for the San Diego State Aztecs. At the age of 19, he was drafted in the 15th round by the Minnesota Twins but did not sign.

===Chicago Cubs===
The Chicago Cubs selected Grace in the 1985 Major League Baseball draft. He spent three years playing in the Cubs farm system before making his major league debut May 2, 1988.

Grace starred on Cubs teams that included Ryne Sandberg, Andre Dawson, Shawon Dunston and Sammy Sosa and was a consistent, steady hitter, compiling 2,445 hits and more than 500 doubles during his 16-year career and for a few years batted clean-up for the Cubs. He had a career on-base percentage of .383 and collected four Gold Glove Awards and was a three-time All-Star (1993, 1995, 1997). Grace collected the most hits (1,754) and doubles (364) of any player in the 1990s. Grace and Pete Rose are the only Major League Baseball players to lead a decade in hits and not be in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Grace also had the most sacrifice flies in the 1990s with 73.

Grace helped lead the Cubs to the NL East division title in 1989 and the NL wild card in 1998. In the 1989 NLCS, Grace batted .647 in the five-game contest with a home run and three doubles, while driving in 8 of the total 16 runs scored by the Cubs in the series.

Grace led the team in average (.325), OBP (.393), hits (193), walks (71), doubles (39), and RBI (98 – a career high) in 1993 and was selected as an alternate to the NL All-Star team for the first time in his career. He also hit for the cycle on May 9 that year, and (as of the end of the 2018 season) is the most recent Cub to have done so. In 1995, Grace hit .326/.395/.516 and hit 51 doubles (which led the NL). He was once again named to the NL All-Star team.

The song that played most frequently on the Wrigley Field organ prior to a Grace at bat was &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot;, which Grace explained was due to his bit part in a Jim Belushi film of the same name.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
Grace signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks on December 8, 2000, with a $6 million, two-year contract after the Cubs declined to offer salary arbitration. The deal included a mutual $3 million option year in 2003. He received $5.3 million in his last season with the Cubs but accepted less money for the opportunity to live year-round at his home in suburban Scottsdale, Arizona with his family. &quot;For me to remain a Cub, the Cubs would have wanted to want me back and the Cubs would have had to win,&quot; Grace said at the time. &quot;Neither of those happened and I&#x27;m one proud Diamondback now.&quot;

Grace wore his familiar number 17 in Arizona where he played for three more seasons, including helping the Diamondbacks win the 2001 World Series. Having never even visited Yankee Stadium, he belted a home run there in Game 4 of the series. In Game 7, Grace led off the bottom of the 9th inning with a single — his third of the game — off Yankee pitcher Mariano Rivera, which rallied the Arizona Diamondbacks to a come-from-behind victory for the franchise&#x27;s first championship. His .515 career batting average in League Championship Series play is a record for players in at least ten games.

During a 19–1 defeat by the Los Angeles Dodgers in September 2002, Grace pitched one inning of relief. He surrendered one run on catcher David Ross&#x27;s first career home run. Grace also impersonated teammate Mike Fetters, who from the stretch would take a deep breath and then quickly turned his head towards the catcher.

On September 26, 2003, Grace announced his retirement from baseball.

===Coaching===
Grace has stated a desire to manage a major league team at some point. He was considered for the Diamondbacks&#x27; managerial position following the 2004 season, but the Diamondbacks hired Bob Melvin instead.

Grace spent 2014 as hitting coach for the Diamondbacks&#x27; Class A Short Season affiliate Hillsboro Hops of the Northwest League. In 2015, he was promoted to the Diamondbacks to be their hitting coach. He was fired after the 2016 season.

==Broadcasting career==
After his retirement as a player, Grace continued his involvement in the game as a television color commentator for the Diamondbacks and for Fox Saturday Baseball. Grace used off-the-wall terms—such as &quot;slumpbuster&quot;, &quot;never-say-die-mondbacks&quot;, and &quot;Gas!&quot;—during broadcasts. He was paired with Thom Brennaman on television from 2004 to 2006, and was paired with Daron Sutton from 2007 to 2012.

Grace also agreed to a deal with Fox Sports in 2007. He originally rotated between the studio and the number three booth. He was then promoted to the number two booth with Thom Brennaman for the 2008 and 2009 season, and Dick Stockton for the 2010 season. He reunited with Brennaman in 2011 before leaving the network at the end of the regular season. He was replaced by Eric Karros who had worked on the number three team with Kenny Albert.

On August 24, 2012, Grace requested an indefinite leave of absence from the booth, and at the end of the 2012 season, the team announced that he would not be returning for the 2013 season.

In February 2017, Grace was named as a baseball analyst for Diamondbacks games by Fox Sports Arizona.

In February 2020, Grace was hired as an analyst for select Chicago Cubs games on Marquee Sports Network. Grace will continue his role with the Diamondbacks as the lead color commentator on Fox Sports Arizona.

==Personal life==
Grace was known to smoke cigarettes before and after Cub games, and reportedly at times, during games in the clubhouse.

On August 3, 2006, Grace led the Wrigley Field crowd in singing &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch of the second game of a doubleheader between the Cubs and Diamondbacks; his appearance helped to improve his relationship with the Cubs, which had been strained since he left the team after the 2000 season.

Grace became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009; 75% of the vote was necessary for induction, and 5% was necessary to stay on future ballots. Grace received 4.1% of the vote and was dropped from further ballots.

Grace&#x27;s ex-wife, Michelle, was married to Ray Liotta from 1997 to 2004; they had met at a Cubs game. As of 2006, Grace is divorced from his second wife, Tanya, who starred on the VH1 show &quot;Baseball Wives.&quot;

Grace lived in Antioch, Tennessee, during a period of his childhood years. He currently resides in Paradise Valley, Arizona, with his sons Jackson Gene and Preston Torre.

===Legal history===
Grace has been arrested twice for driving under the influence; once in May 2011 and once in August 2012.

On October 3, 2012, a grand jury in Arizona indicted Grace on four felony counts stemming from his August 23, 2012, arrest in Scottsdale on suspicion of driving under the influence, driving with a suspended license and without an interlock device. The Diamondbacks announced the following day that Grace would not return to his television broadcasting duties with the club. He subsequently pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four months in jail on January 31, 2013. The sentence included work-release jail time as well as two years of supervised probation. An interlock device was required to be installed in his vehicle for six months.

<doc id="328088" wikidata="Q3911009" url="?curid=328088" title="President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)">
<text>President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is a priesthood calling in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Normally, the president of the Quorum of the Twelve is the most senior apostle in the church, aside from the president of the church. When the church president dies, the president of the Quorum of the Twelve succeeds him. There have been 27 men who have served as President of the Twelve (one of whom served two non-consecutive terms). Of these, 16 subsequently become the church president. Since January 2018, Dallin H. Oaks has been the President of the Quorum of the Twelve. Since Oaks is also first counselor in the First Presidency, M. Russell Ballard served as acting president until his death on November 12, 2023. Jeffrey R. Holland became the new acting president on November 15, 2023.

==History of the Presidency of the Quorum of the Twelve==
Upon the death of the president of the church, the First Presidency automatically dissolves. The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles becomes the highest leadership body and their president becomes the most senior leader of the church. On the death of church president Joseph Smith in 1844, Brigham Young was the Quorum President, and he persuaded the majority of church members that Smith&#x27;s death left him and not Sidney Rigdon, who had been Smith&#x27;s first counselor in the First Presidency, as the senior leader of the church. Smith had reportedly taught the apostles, &quot;Where I am not, there is no First Presidency over the Twelve.&quot;

In 1847, the Quorum of the Twelve reconstituted the First Presidency, with Young as church president. During Young&#x27;s presidency, seniority within the Quorum of the Twelve was formalized to mean &quot;continuous service as an Apostle since being ordained as one of the Twelve&quot;. The original apostles of 1835 had been ranked by age, and two of them had been excommunicated and later restored to fellowship. With this rule in place, upon the death of Young, John Taylor led the church, first as Quorum President and, after 1880, as President of the Church. Wilford Woodruff became President of the Twelve.

After Taylor died in 1887, Woodruff did not reorganize the First Presidency until 1889. But before his own death in 1898, he advised the Quorum of the Twelve that &quot;in all future time, when the president of the church should die and thereby the First Presidency become disorganized, it would be the duty of the proper authorities of the church to proceed at once without any unnecessary delay, to reorganize the First Presidency.&quot; Snow followed this advice and since then every interval between the death of the president of the church and the ordination of a new president has been less than two weeks, long enough to complete the funeral services and allow for the Quorum of the Twelve to nominate and sustain the president of the twelve as the new church president. When the president of the twelve becomes the president of the church, the next apostle in seniority becomes the new president of the twelve.

==Duties==
The president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is the priesthood leader of the members of the quorum. As such, all members of the quorum report directly to him. The president&#x27;s other duties consist of presiding at and conducting weekly meetings of the quorum in the Salt Lake Temple; making decisions about the particular assignments to be made to the members of the quorum; speaking on behalf of the quorum to members of the church and the media; scheduling twice-annual conferences for each stake and district in the church; and acting as a liaison in coordinating the work of the quorum with the First Presidency, the Quorums of the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric.

When adherents refer to the president of the Quorum of the Twelve, his name is usually prefaced by the honorific title &quot;President&quot;.

==Acting President==
If the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is serving as a counselor in the First Presidency, he retains that title but is not numbered among the twelve. The most senior apostle who is not in the First Presidency is then named as Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The acting president assumes all of the duties that would normally rest upon the president of the quorum. The title of Acting President was first used in 1918 for Rudger Clawson. The position has also been used during times of infirmity of a president of the twelve: for example, Howard W. Hunter was Acting President for the infirm Marion G. Romney from 1985 to 1988.

Boyd K. Packer was the acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from 1994 to 2008 when Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson were presidents of the quorum but were serving in the First Presidency.

On January 16, 2018, the church announced that due to the call of Dallin H. Oaks as a counselor in the First Presidency, M. Russell Ballard would serve as Acting President. After Ballard&#x27;s death on November 12, 2023, Jeffrey R. Holland was set apart as the new acting president on November 15.

<doc id="328092" wikidata="Q953000" url="?curid=328092" title="Colorado Crush">
<text>The Colorado Crush were an arena football team based in Denver, Colorado. They began play as a 2003 Arena Football League expansion team. The Crush played in the Central Division of the American Conference until the Arena Football League suspended operations in 2009. They were last coached by Mike Dailey and owned by a coalition of Denver sports figures led by John Elway.

Negotiations with a Denver ownership group were underway for a future AFL expansion franchise in Denver, but it was unclear whether or not it will use the Crush branding or that of the Denver Dynamite, an earlier AFL team. Like the Dallas Desperados, the Crush&#x27;s branding is partially based on NFL teams (the Denver Broncos and St. Louis Rams, though to a much lesser degree), which would have given the late Pat Bowlen or Stan Kroenke a potential veto over any usage of the Colorado Crush branding. On July 15, 2015, the Crush name was acquired by the Indoor Football League franchise formerly known as the Colorado Ice as the trademark for the name expired in 2014 according to their ownership.

==History==
On August 8, 2001, the team entered an application for expansion into the Arena Football League. In June 2002, it was announced that John Elway (Co-Owner and Chief Executive Officer), with Stan Kroenke, owner of the Avalanche, the Nuggets, the Rapids, Pepsi Center, &amp; the Altitude Sports network and the majority Broncos owner Pat Bowlen would be bringing an arena football team to Denver. The Crush competed in the Central Division of the American Conference. After a bad inaugural season in 2003, in which they finished 2-14, the Crush rebounded to go 11–5 and make the playoffs in their second year. On June 12, 2005 they won ArenaBowl XIX (19) in Las Vegas&#x27; Thomas &amp; Mack Center over the Georgia Force 51–48, in only their third year of existence.

In their fourth year the Crush ended up 11–5, with the American Conference Central title for the second year in a row. In the divisional round, however, the Crush lost in an upset to the fifth-seeded (and eventual ArenaBowl champion) Chicago Rush 63–46.

The team&#x27;s mascot was an anthropomorphic bull named &quot;Crusher.&quot;

On July 15, 2015, the Indoor Football League franchise previously known as the Colorado Ice announced that they would change their name to the Colorado Crush, but would have no ties to the former AFL franchise. According to team owner Tom Wigley, the trademark of the Crush name expired the year before meaning that the original Crush ownership no longer had a say in the use of the name.

==Highlights==
* On Sunday, June 12, 2005, the Crush hosted the American Conference Championship game against their division rival, the Chicago Rush. Colorado had the lead late in the game 43–40 and defensive back Rashad Floyd managed to intercept a touchdown pass from quarterback Matt D&#x27;Orazio, but it turns out that he was called for holding. Chicago would tie the game with kicker Keith Gispert&#x27;s 17-yard field goal. In overtime, the Crush would get the win with Quarterback John Dutton completing a 22-yard touchdown pass to WR/LB Antowone &#x27;Andy&#x27; McCullough, sending them to ArenaBowl XIX (where they would eventually win).And won 2 before and 2 after On the AFL&#x27;s 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this game is at #20.
* On Friday, February 6, 2004, in a Week 1 contest against the Las Vegas Gladiators, the Crush were still looking for their first home win in franchise history. In the final 12 seconds of the game, the Crush would have quarterback John Dutton complete a seven-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Damian Harrell (with a failed two-point conversion), recover an onside kick, and have Dutton complete a 33-yard pass to Harrell. With 12 points in 12 seconds, Colorado would win 43–42 and get their first-ever win at home. On the AFL&#x27;s 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is at #15.
* On Saturday, February 5, 2005, in a Week 2 home game against their division rival, the Grand Rapids Rampage, quarterback John Dutton would throw a franchise-best eight touchdowns in a 72–56 win, yet this was overshadowed by Rampage quarterback Michael Bishop becoming the first player in AFL history to run for 100 yards in a single game. On the AFL&#x27;s 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is at #12.
* In 2019, Crush co-owner Pat Bowlen became the second contributor with significant impact on arena football to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Bowlen died a month before the ceremony.

<text>Ball Arena (formerly known as Pepsi Center) is a multi-purpose indoor arena located in Denver, Colorado. It is situated at Speer Boulevard, a main thoroughfare in downtown Denver, and is served by two nearby exits off Interstate 25. A light rail station is on the western side of the complex. Opened in 1999, it is the home arena of the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL), and the Colorado Mammoth of the National Lacrosse League (NLL).

==History==

The arena replaced McNichols Sports Arena as the home of the Avalanche and Nuggets. Groundbreaking for the arena on the site was held on November 20, 1997, before reaching completion and opening in October 1999. Also included in the complex are a basketball practice facility used by the Nuggets, and the Breckenridge Brewery Mountain House&quot;&quot;, a restaurant accessible from within and outside the Center itself. The atrium of the building houses a suspended sculpture depicting various hockey and basketball athletes in action poses.

Prior to the 2013–14 season, the octagonal scoreboard that was in use since the arena&#x27;s opening was replaced with a new four-sided rectangular scoreboard. The two center faces measure long, while the two end faces measure wide.

From its opening through 2020, the naming rights to the arena were held by PepsiCo, under which it was known as Pepsi Center. On October 22, 2020, the naming rights were sold to Broomfield-based Ball Corporation as part of a global multi-year agreement with Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment (KSE), which also makes it the exclusive &quot;sustainability partner&quot; of the arena. As part of the agreement, all KSE-owned sports teams and venues will employ recyclable aluminum products provided by Ball to reduce plastic waste, with Ball Arena to transition to serving concessions in aluminum packaging by 2022.

==Events==
=== Hockey ===
The arena hosted the 2001 NHL All-Star Game, plus two Stanley Cup Finals series in 2001 and 2022. The Avalanche won both times, the first at home.
In 2007, the west regionals of the NCAA Division I hockey tournament were held at the arena, hosted by the University of Denver. The following year, it hosted the Frozen Four round of the 2008 tournament. On January 12, 2025, the first Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League (PWHL) game in Denver was played at the arena between the Montreal Victoire and the Minnesota Frost; 14,018 fans attended, setting a new record for attendance of women&#x27;s hockey in the United States.

=== Basketball ===
Ball Arena hosted the 2005 NBA All-Star Game, and hosted three games of the 2023 NBA Finals. The Nuggets won the 2023 NBA championship at home in Game 5 on June 12 of that year, the first title in franchise history, ending a 47–year drought. The arena has hosted games of the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 2004, 2008, 2011, 2016, and 2023. In 2012, the NCAA Women&#x27;s Final Four was played at the arena, hosted by the Mountain West Conference.

From 2004 to 2006, the arena hosted the Mountain West&#x27;s men&#x27;s conference tournament.

=== Mixed martial arts ===
UFC held its first event at the arena, &quot;UFC 135: Jones vs. Rampage&quot;, on September 24, 2011. It also hosted &quot;UFC 150: Henderson vs. Edgar II&quot; the following August. The UFC returned to the arena in 2017 for &quot;UFC on Fox: Shevchenko vs. Peña&quot;. The promotion returned to the arena the following year in November for &quot;UFC Fight Night: The Korean Zombie vs. Rodríguez&quot;. The arena most recently held &quot;UFC on ESPN: Namajunas vs. Cortez&quot; and &quot;ONE Championship&#x27;s&quot; &quot;ONE 168&quot; in July &amp; September 2024 respectively.

=== Professional wrestling ===
The arena has hosted various WWE (and in the past, WCW) television broadcasts.

==== The &quot;Denver Debacle&quot; ====
On May 18, 2009, WWE cancelled and moved three events it had scheduled in Colorado, including a &quot;WWE Raw&quot; taping on May 25, 2009, at Pepsi Center, after the Denver Nuggets were scheduled to play Game 4 of the NBA Western Conference finals against the Los Angeles Lakers on the same date. The affected events were all moved to the Lakers&#x27; home arena of Staples Center, while WWE rescheduled an August 7 taping of &quot;Raw&quot; for Pepsi Center.

In an appearance on KUSA, WWE chairman Vince McMahon accused the &quot;inept management&quot; of team and arena owner Stan Kroenke as having led to the conflict. A KSE spokesperson stated that &quot;despite the propaganda campaign launched by WWE and Chairman Vince McMahon, the KSE team maintained a professional manner throughout this process. We had hoped for, and worked hard toward an amicable resolution - which we verbally had on Tuesday.&quot;

The conflict would be referenced during the ensuing May 25 &quot;Raw&quot;, which opened with a skit between impersonators of Kroenke and Lakers owner Jerry Buss. &quot;Kroenke&quot; boasted about the Nuggets and his indifference to WWE and its fans. Mr. McMahon subsequently entered the ring, jokingly proposed the formation of his own basketball league, the XBA (a reference to his ill-fated XFL), and shoved &quot;Kroenke&quot; down — threatening that people who &quot;push&quot; WWE&#x27;s fans would get &quot;pushed back&quot;. In the main event, a 5-on-5 tag team match was held, where a face team wearing Lakers jerseys (John Cena, Batista, Jerry Lawler, MVP, and Mr. Kennedy) defeated a heel team wearing Nuggets jerseys (Randy Orton, The Miz, Cody Rhodes, Ted DiBiase, and Big Show).

===Other events===
Ball Arena has hosted a wide array of music concerts and other events since opening in 1999. Celine Dion performed a sold-out show at the venue - the first event of any kind at the location, on October 1, 1999. Dion dedicated the show to the Columbine community following the school shooting that occurred less than six months prior. Since then, artists such as Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Coldplay, Demi Lovato, Nick Jonas, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Imagine Dragons, Pink, NSYNC, Shania Twain, Cher, KISS, Justin Timberlake, Elton John, Twenty One Pilots, Madonna and Kylie Minogue have held concerts at the arena.

During the week of July 2–8, 2007, the arena hosted the International Convention and Contests of the Barbershop Harmony Society, a men&#x27;s singing organization.

After a short-lived race at the Denver Civic Center in the early 1990s, the Champ Car World Series ran an annual street circuit race around Pepsi Center, the Grand Prix of Denver. The race was discontinued after the 2006 event.

The majority of the 2008 Democratic National Convention was held at the arena, culminating with the official nomination of then-Senator Barack Obama as the Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate for the 2008 presidential election. However, the closing night of the convention, including Obama&#x27;s acceptance speech, was instead held at Invesco Field at Mile High.

Madonna&#x27;s concert on October 18, 2012, as part of her MDNA Tour (2012) drew controversy and complaints from critics and fans alike. Not only was the show reported to have started three hours late, but it also used fake guns during a violence-inspired performance of her tracks &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;Gang Bang&quot;. The performance took place less than three months after a mass shooting at a movie theatre in nearby Aurora, Colorado, driving feelings that its inclusion was insensitive and in poor taste.

<doc id="328100" wikidata="Q242108" url="?curid=328100" title="Otaru">
<text>is a city and port in Shiribeshi Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan, northwest of Sapporo. The city faces Ishikari Bay and the Sea of Japan, and has long served as the main port of the bay. With its many historical buildings, Otaru is a popular tourist destination. Because it is a 25-minute drive from Sapporo, it has grown as a commuter town. As of July 31, 2023, the city had an estimated population of 107,432 and a population density of 441 persons per km² (1,100 persons per mi²). The total area is . Although it is the largest city in Shiribeshi Subprefecture, the subprefecture&#x27;s capital is the more centrally located Kutchan.

== History ==
The name &quot;Otaru&quot; is recognized as being of Ainu origin, possibly meaning &quot;River running through the sandy beach&quot;. The very small remaining part of the Temiya Cave contains carvings from the Zoku-Jōmon period of Ainu history, around A.D. 400. Mount Akaiwa (Northwest part of Otaru) is memorialized in the Ainu tradition in the story of Sitonai, village chief&#x27;s teenage daughter who had slain a white snake from the mountain&#x27;s cave that demanded sacrifices of girls every year. The legend explains the name of a big cave on Mount Akaiwa, Hakuryu Gongen Cave (白竜権現洞窟, lit. &quot;White Dragon Gongen Cave&quot;) and the reason why a shrine was built on the mountain (to protect the village from being haunted by the snake).

Otaru was recognised as a village by the &quot;bakufu&quot; in 1865, and in 1880 the first railway line in Hokkaido was opened with daily service between Otaru and Sapporo.

An Imperial decree in July 1899 established Otaru as an open port for trading with the United States and the United Kingdom.

The city flourished well as the financial and business center in Hokkaido as well as the trade port with Japanese ruled southern Sakhalin until the 1920s. Otaru was redesignated as a city on August 1, 1922.

On December 27, 1924, a freight train loaded with 600 cases of dynamite, unloaded from the freighter &quot;Shoho Maru&quot;, exploded in Temiya Station, killing 94 people and injuring 200 more, in addition to damaging the warehouse, the harbour facilities, and the surrounding area.

During World War II, Otaru housed a prison camp for Aleuts taken there following the Japanese occupation of Attu. During the closing stages of the war, Otaru was bombed by American naval aircraft in July 1945.

Since the 1950s, as the coal industry around the city went into a decline, the status of the economic hub shifted from Otaru to Sapporo.

== Geography ==

Otaru is a port town on the coast of the Sea of Japan in northern Shiribeshi Subprefecture. The southern portion of the city is characterized by the steep slopes of various mountains (notably Tenguyama), where the altitude of the land sharply drops from the mountains to the sea. The land available between the coast and mountains has been almost completely developed, and the developed part of the city on the mountain slopes is called &quot;Saka-no-machi&quot;, or &quot;Hill town&quot;, including hills named &quot;Funamizaka&quot; (Boat-view Hill) and &quot;Jigokuzaka&quot; (Hell Hill).

== Notable attractions ==

A canal adorned with Victorian-style street lamps runs through Otaru. The city attracts a large number of Japanese as well as foreign tourists.

A popular attraction on the west side of the city is Nishin Goten (herring mansion). This large wooden building was built in 1897 and was once the house of Fukumatsu Tanaka, a fishing magnate. It was originally built in nearby Tomari village and moved in 1958. Visitors can clearly see the difference between the squalid conditions of the first-floor sleeping quarters of 120 workers and the ground-floor luxury of the magnate&#x27;s rooms.

Another notable building is the Sakaushi residence, constructed by Yoshiya Tanoue, a pupil of Frank Lloyd Wright.

The city is home to Otaru Aquarium, which is recognized by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology as a facility equivalent to a museum under the Museum Law and is the oldest existing aquarium in Hokkaido, having opened in 1958.

The city also hosts the Tomioka Catholic church, many of whose buildings have been designated as landmark architecture.

Otaru is known for its beer, and Otaru Beer, next to the canal, is a restaurant with a medieval theme. The city is also known for its fresh sushi. Another food attraction unique to Otaru is rainbow tower ice cream. The town also has substantial shopping arcades and bazaars, but fewer than nearby Sapporo.

Otaru&#x27;s prominent industries are arts and crafts, such as studio glass and musical boxes. Of the latter, it maintains the Otaru Music Box Museum. Otaru Art Base is another cluster of museums that showcases local art.

== Tenguyama ==
Otaru is an important port for Sapporo, and part of this hilly city is on the lower slopes of Tenguyama, a good place for skiing and other winter sports and one that is accessible via Otaru Tenguyama Ropeway.

== Regional dishes ==

<text>A fire ship or fireship is a large wooden vessel set on fire to be used against enemy ships during a ramming attack or similar maneuver. Fireships were used to great effect against wooden ships throughout naval military history up until the advent of metal-hulled ships; they could also serve a considerable function in shock and awe strategies to harm the morale of enemy crews. Ships used for fireship tactics were typically purpose-built or retrofitted from surplus or obsolete vessels, either of which could be filled with gunpowder or other combustibles before a battle, but could also be improvised from warships in active combat purposefully set on fire during engagements, such as if a vessel expended its munitions or had some other reason to be abandoned in battle.

Specialized fire ships included the massive Dutch hellburners, also called &quot;explosion ships&quot;, which were fitted with large explosive stores designed to detonate upon contact with the enemy.

Fireships were used to great effect by the outgunned English fleet against the Spanish Armada during the Battle of Gravelines, the Dutch in the raid on the Medway, Chinese warlord Sun Quan in the Battle of Red Cliffs, and the Greeks in their war of independence.

==History==
===Ancient era, first uses===

The Tyrians launched a fire ship that destroyed two Macedonian siege towers and other siege engines at the Siege of Tyre (332 BC).

During the Third Punic War, Carthaginian fire ships destroyed many Roman vessels and came close to burning the entire Roman fleet at the Battle of Lake Tunis in 149 BC.

During the end of the Han dynasty, at the Battle of Red Cliffs (208 CE) on the Yangtze River, Huang Gai assaulted Cao Cao&#x27;s naval forces with a fire ship filled with bundles of kindling, dry reeds, and fatty oil.

Fire ships were employed to decisive effect by the Vandals against the armada sent by the Eastern Roman Empire, in the Battle of Cape Bon (468).

The invention of Greek fire in 673 increased the use of fire ships, at first by the Greeks and afterward by other nations as they came into possession of the secret of manufacturing this substance. In 951 and again in 953 Russian fleets narrowly escaped destruction by fire ships.

===Age of fighting sail, refinement===

While fire ships were used in the Medieval period, notably during the Crusades, these were typically ships that were set up with combustibles on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis. The career of the modern fire ship, as a naval vessel type designed for this particular function and made a permanent addition to a fleet, roughly parallels the era of cannon-armed sailing ships, beginning with the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 and lasting until the Allied victory over the Turks at the Battle of Navarino in 1827. The first modern fireships were put to use in early 17th century Dutch and Spanish fleet actions during the Thirty Years War. Their use increased throughout that century, with purpose-built fireships a permanent part of many naval fleets, ready to be deployed whenever necessary. Initially small and often obsolete smaller warships were chosen as fireships but by 1700 fireships were being purpose-built with specific features for their role. Most were adaptations of the usual small warships of the day – brigs or ship-rigged sloops-of-war with between 10 and 16 guns. The practical design features of purpose-built fireships included a lattice-work false deck below the planks of the main deck – the planks would be removed and the combustibles and explosives stacked on the lattice, which gave good draught and ensured the fire would hold and spread. A number of square-section chimneys would be let into the forecastle and quarterdeck to also help ensure a good draught for the fire. The gunports would be hinged at the bottom (rather than the top as on other warships) so that they would be kept open by gravity rather than ropes (which would otherwise burn thorough), further ensuring a good air supply. On the other hand, the lower parts of the masts would be surrounded by &#x27;coffer dams&#x27; to ensure that the fire would not bring down the masts prematurely and thus deprive the fireship of motive power. Grappling hooks would be fitted to the ends of the yardarms so that the fireship would become entangled in its target&#x27;s rigging. A large sally-port door was let into the rear quarter of the ship (usually the starboard side) to allow easy exit for the crew once the fire had been set and lit. There was often a chain fixed here for mooring the escape boat rather than a rope that may have been damaged by the fire. Because fireships were used relatively rarely and only in specific tactical conditions even in their heyday, and there was always demand for small cruisers and warships, most purpose-built &#x27;fireships&#x27; served long careers as ordinary warships without ever being used for their actual purpose. Of the five fireships used in Holmes&#x27;s Bonfire of 1666 three had been in service with the Royal Navy for over a decade before being deployed on their final mission.

While only used sparingly during the Napoleonic Wars, fire ships as a distinct class were part of the British Royal Navy until 1808, at which point the use of permanently designated fire ships attached to British squadrons disappeared. Fire ships continued to be used, sometimes to great effect, such as by the US Navy at the Battle of Tripoli Harbor in 1804 and by the British Navy&#x27;s Thomas Cochrane at the Battle of the Basque Roads in 1809, but for the most part they were considered an obsolete weapon by the early 19th century.

Warships of the age of sail were highly vulnerable to fire. Made of wood, with seams caulked with tar, ropes greased with fat, and stores of gunpowder, there was little that would not burn. Accidental fires destroyed many ships, so fire ships presented a terrifying threat. With the wind in exactly the right direction a fire ship could be cast loose and allowed to drift onto its target, but in most battles fire ships were equipped with skeleton crews to steer the ship to the target (the crew were expected to abandon ship at the last moment and escape in the ship&#x27;s boat). Fire ships were most devastating against fleets which were at anchor or otherwise restricted in movement. At sea, a well-handled ship could evade a fire ship and disable it with cannon fire. Other tactics were to fire at the ship&#x27;s boats and other vessels in the vicinity, so that the crew could not escape and therefore might decide not to ignite the ship, or to wait until the fire ship had been abandoned and then tow it aside with small maneuverable vessels such as galleys.

The role of incendiary vessels changed throughout the age of the modern fire ship. The systematic use of fire ships as part of naval actions peaked around the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Whereas just twenty years before a naval fleet might have six to seven fire ships, by the Battle of Solebay in 1672 both the Dutch and English fleets employed typically between 20 and 30 fire ships, and sometimes more. By this time, however, admirals and captains had become very experienced with the limitations of fire ship attacks and had learned how to avoid them during battle. Great numbers of fire ships were expended during the Third Dutch War without destroying enemy men-of-war, and fire ships had become a way to harass and annoy the enemy, rather than destroy him. The successful use of fire ships at the Battle of La Hogue and Cherbourg in 1692 marked both the greatest achievement of a fire ship attack since the Spanish Armada, and also the last significant success for fire ships. Though fire ships as a specified class sailed with the British Royal Navy for another century, they would never have a significant impact on a naval victory. Once the most feared weapons in naval arsenals, fire ships had declined in both importance and numbers, so that by the mid-18th century only five to six British fire ships would be at sea at a time, and the Royal Navy attempted only four attacks using modern fire ships between 1697 and 1800. Hastily outfitted ad hoc fire ships continued to be used in naval warfare; for example, a large number of fire rafts were used in mostly ineffective attacks on the British fleet by American forces during the American Revolution at Philadelphia, on the Hudson River, and elsewhere. The end of the modern fire ship came in the early 19th century, when the British began to use hastily outfitted fire ships at engagements such as Boulogne and Dunkirk despite the presence of purpose-built fire ships in the fleet. The last modern fire ship in the British Royal Navy was &quot;Thais&quot;, the only designated fire ship out of the entire navy of 638 warships when she was converted to a ship sloop in 1808.

===Use in the Greek War of Independence===

In the Greek War of Independence, 1821–1832, the extensive use of fire ships by the Greeks allowed them to counterbalance the Turkish naval superiority in terms of ship size and artillery power. As the small fire ships were much more maneuverable than enemy ships of the line, especially in the coasts of the Aegean Sea where the islands, islets, reefs, gulfs and straits restrained big ships from being easily moved, they were a serious danger for the ships of the Turkish fleet. Many naval battles of the Greek war of independence were won by the use of fire ships, notably the burning of the Ottoman flagship off Chios in June 1822. The successful use of fireships required the use of the element of surprise (a visible similarity with modern-day naval special operations). It is considered an important landmark in Greek naval tradition.

===19th and 20th centuries, obsolescence===
From the beginning of the 19th century, steam propulsion and the use of iron, rather than wood, in shipbuilding gradually came into use, making fire ships less of a threat.

During the American Civil War, the Confederate States Navy occasionally used fire rafts on the Mississippi River. These were flatboats loaded with flammable materials such as pine knots and rosin. The fire rafts were set alight and either loosed to drift on the river&#x27;s current towards the enemy (for example at the Battle of the Head of Passes) or else pushed against Union ships by tugboats (as at the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip).

During World War II in September 1940, there was a British sortie codenamed Operation Lucid to send old oil tankers into French ports to destroy barges intended for the planned invasion of Britain; it was abandoned when both tankers broke down. Ships or boats packed with explosives could still be effective. Such a case was Operation Chariot of 1942, in which the old destroyer was packed with explosives and rammed into the dry dock at Saint-Nazaire, France, to deny its use to the battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, which could not drydock anywhere else on the French west coast. In the Mediterranean, the Italian Navy made good use of high-speed boats filled with explosives, mostly against moored targets. Each boat, called by the Italians MTM (&quot;Motoscafo da Turismo Modificato&quot;), carried of explosive charge inside its bow. Their best-known action was the 1941 assault on Souda Bay, which resulted in the destruction of cruiser and the Norwegian tanker &quot;Pericles&quot;, of 8,300 tons.

The successful attack by Yemeni insurgents in a speedboat packed with explosives on the guided missile destroyer in 2000 could be described as an extension of the idea of a fireship. Another explosive ship attack took place in April 2004, during the Iraq War, when three motor craft laden with explosives attempted the bombing of Khawr Al Amaya Oil Terminal in the Persian Gulf. In an apparent suicide bombing, one blew up and sank a rigid inflatable boat from as it pulled up alongside, killing two US Navy personnel and one member of the US Coast Guard.

===21st century, revival with kamikaze USVs===
In October 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, several kamikaze unmanned surface vehicles were used against Russian naval vessels at the Sevastopol Naval Base, with support of UAVs.

During Operation Prosperity Guardian, Houthis used several kamikaze unmanned surface vehicles to attack ships in the Red Sea.
==Notable uses==
Notable fire ship attacks include:
* Huang Gai&#x27;s attack on Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs.
* Alexander the Great&#x27;s Siege of Tyre in 332 BC. The Tyrians used the fire ship in attempt to destroy Alexander&#x27;s mole.
* Syracuse in their battle with the Athenian fleet.
* Geiseric&#x27;s use of fire ships in great effect during the Battle of Cap Bon in 468.
* Battle of San Juan de Ulúa in 1568. John Hawkins&#x27; flagship &quot;Jesus of Lübeck&quot; was attacked by a fire ship before being stormed by Spanish seamen.
* Siege of Antwerp in 1585. Both fire ships and exploding vessels were employed together for the first time.
* Francis Drake&#x27;s attack on the Spanish Armada moored at Gravelines in 1588. The fire ships did no damage, but the Spanish scattered in panic and were easy prey for English ships.

<doc id="328108" wikidata="Q637145" url="?curid=328108" title="Yūbari, Hokkaido">
<text>is a city located in Sorachi Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan.

As of January 31, 2024, the city has an estimated population of 6,374, with 3,863 households. The total area is 763.20 km2. Hemmed in by mountains, Yūbari stretches for 25 kilometers along a mountain valley.

The city is famous for the Yubari Melon and the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival, which skipped a show in 2007 due to the city&#x27;s financial crisis. It is also birthplace of Mitsuharu Misawa.

==History==
The city was founded on April 1, 1943, as a coal mining town. When the mines were operating Yūbari had as many as 120,000 people. With the closing of the colliery in the 1980s, an attempt was made to convert the economic base to tourism. Subsidies were obtained from the central government and huge debts incurred for the building of tourist attractions, but few visitors came. In 2007 the city was in the news due to bankruptcy and the refusal of the national government to bail it out. City services had been severely cut and its white elephant amusement park and museums were up for sale. The amusement park has begun to be demolished as of June 2008.

Roughly half of Yūbari&#x27;s government officials resigned in March 2007 as part of an attempt to streamline the local fiscal situation. The majority of officials stepping down who responded to a survey conducted by &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; say they &quot;feel no sense of responsibility&quot; for the city&#x27;s financial problems.

<doc id="328115" wikidata="Q2995523" url="?curid=328115" title="First Presidency">
<text>Among many churches in the Latter Day Saint movement, the First Presidency (also known as the Quorum of the Presidency of the Church) is the highest presiding or governing body. Present-day denominations of the movement led by a First Presidency include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Community of Christ, Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and the Righteous Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

When the Church of Christ was organized on April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery led the church in their capacity as elders. Smith established the inaugural First Presidency on March 8, 1832, with the ordinations of Jesse Gause and Sidney Rigdon as his counselors. The term &quot;first presidency,&quot; though used at least as early as 1834, did not become standard until 1838. The presidency was to exercise authority over the entire church, whereas the jurisdictions of the Twelve Apostles and the Seventy were the outlying areas outside of the gathering places where the church had been organized on a more permanent basis.

After the death of Smith in 1844, First Presidencies were reorganized by Brigham Young for the LDS Church, by Rigdon for the Rigdonites (now defunct), by Joseph Smith III for the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now Community of Christ), by James J. Strang for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), and by William Bickerton for The Church of Jesus Christ, although the latter two organizations have not had a First Presidency for much of their history.

==LDS Church==


In the LDS Church, the First Presidency is the presiding, or governing authority of the church. It usually consists of the President of the Church and two counselors, although up to eight counselors have on occasion been included in the presidency at the same time. The counselors assist the church president and work closely with him in guiding the entire church.

Like the church president and President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, counselors in the First Presidency are referred to by the title &quot;President&quot;; he and his counselors are referred to as President Russell M. Nelson, President Dallin H. Oaks, and President Henry B. Eyring. All members of the First Presidency are &quot;sustained&quot; by the membership of the church as prophets, seers, and revelators.

Any worthy high priest within the church may serve as a counselor in the First Presidency, though most of its members have been chosen from among the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Charles W. Nibley, for example, was a counselor to Heber J. Grant without ever being ordained to the priesthood office of apostle.

In the case of an infirm president, his counselors may be called upon to perform more of his duties. If needed, any number of additional counselors may be called to assist them, though the president of the church still remains the only person on the earth authorized to use &quot;all&quot; priesthood keys.

Counselors serve in the First Presidency until their own deaths, until the death of the church president who called them, or until they are released by the church president. The death of a church president dissolves the First Presidency, and leaves the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as the senior leader of the church.

The death or release of a counselor does not dissolve the First Presidency.

Often, the surviving counselors of the late president will be called as counselors in the new First Presidency, but a notably infirm counselor may revert to his place among the Twelve Apostles with a healthier man called as counselor in his place. On the death or release of a first counselor, the second counselor usually succeeds and a new second counselor is named. Although this is a fairly common occurrence, there are no hard and fast rules about such practices and each president is free to choose the counselors he prefers.

==Community of Christ==
The First Presidency is the highest leadership or priesthood quorum of the Community of Christ. Normally the First Presidency consists of the Prophet-President of the church and two counselors.

In 1860 with the reorganization of the First Presidency, Joseph Smith III became the second Prophet-President of this church and also President of a new First Presidency. William Marks became Smith&#x27;s First Counselor.

The First Presidency of Community of Christ differs from the First Presidency of the LDS Church, where the church president is always the senior-most member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In the Community of Christ, each new church president has generally been &quot;designated&quot; as the successor by God through revelation received by the preceding church president (while still in that role). The Counselors in the First Presidency are then chosen by the church president and are occasionally, but not required, to be former or current members of the Council of Twelve Apostles. In addition, the death of the Prophet-President does not dissolve the First Presidency, which continues on as the church&#x27;s executive council in the persons of the remaining two presidents until a Prophet-President is called. The two members who were counselors to the Prophet-President, cease to be counselors during this time. Upon ordination of the Prophet-President, the former First Presidency is dissolved, and upon ordination of the two he calls to be his counselors, to the office of president, the First Presidency is then deemed reorganized. Members of the First Presidency are not generally considered to be members of the Council of Twelve Apostles or holding the priesthood office of apostle, regardless of previous calling.

Prior to 1996, all prophet-presidents were descendants of the movement&#x27;s founder, Joseph Smith. This pattern was broken by Wallace B. Smith, who designated W. Grant McMurray church president. McMurray, in turn, resigned the church presidency in 2004 without designating a successor. A joint council of church leaders led by the Council of Twelve Apostles announced in March 2005 the name of Stephen M. Veazey as Prophet-President. Veazey had been serving as president of the Council of Twelve. Delegates elected to a special World Conference of the church approved Veazey and he was ordained as the 8th president of the High Priesthood, Prophet, and President of the Church on June 3, 2005.

On June 4, 2005 with the ordinations of Kenneth N. Robinson and David D. Schaal as presidents of the church and counselors to the president, the First Presidency was reorganized.

On March 27, 2007, Robinson retired from his position in the First Presidency and Becky Savage was ordained into the First Presidency. She is the first female to sit on the First Presidency.

Unlike most Latter Day Saint denominations with a First Presidency, the counselors in the First Presidency of the Community of Christ are no longer designated &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second&quot; counselors.

Current members of the First Presidency:

*President Stephen M. Veazey (President of the High Priesthood &amp; of the Church)
*President Becky L. Savage (Counselor to the president)

==Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints==

A First Presidency also leads the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which was formed primarily out of discontent with changes in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and seeks to be a &quot;renewal&quot; of that church prior to those changes. The First Presidency consists of three High Priests chosen by the voice of the Church; a president and two counselors. The president is selected by revelation, Jewish Laws of Inheritance, and vote of the General Conference of the Church. The president has the right to choose his own counselors but they must also be sustained by vote of the general conference. The first president following the schism with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was Frederick Niels Larsen, a direct descendant (maternal 2nd great-grandson) of Joseph Smith. His successor is Terry W. Patience, whose first and second counselors are Michael Hogan and David Van Fleet.

==The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)==


Within The Church of Jesus Christ, the president of the church and his two counselors are elected by the general priesthood in conference and selected from amongst the Quorum of Twelve Apostles. The president of the church, while being an ordained apostle, functions as the chief operating officer, overseeing the general operations of the church.

=== Name ===
There are two theories about the origin of &quot;Ashibetsu&quot;. In both theories the name means Ashibetsu River, which flows through the city.
* &quot;as pet&quot;, the river that flows in a shrub
* &quot;hasi pet&quot;, the standing river

=== Locations of interest ===
*The Hokkaido Kannon is the third-tallest statue in Japan and is the tenth-tallest in the world. It was considered the tallest statue in the world when it opened in 1989 at , holding the world record until 1991.
*Canadian World is a scale model of the Canadian seaside village of Avonlea, the setting of &quot;Anne of Green Gables.&quot; It was built in 1990, which is said to be the origin of the sister city relationship between Ashibetsu and Charlottetown, the real city in Canada that Avonlea was based on. The park went bankrupt in 1997 and closed 1998, reopening in 1998 as a city-run park. It closed in October of 2019 and reopened in April 2020, and is now run by the Canadian World Promotion Association which operates the park independently after receiving the buildings and other facilities free of charge from the city.

<text>Arirang ( ) is a Korean folk song. There are about 3,600 variations of 60 different versions of the song, all of which include a refrain similar to &quot;Arirang, arirang, arariyo&quot; (&quot;&quot;). It is estimated the song is more than 600 years old.

&quot;Arirang&quot; is included twice on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list, having been submitted for inclusion first by South Korea in 2012 and then by North Korea in 2014. In 2015, the South Korean Cultural Heritage Administration added the song to its list of important intangible cultural assets.

The song is sung today in both North and South Korea, and represents the symbol of unity in the region that is divided by the Korean War.

==History==
===Origin and ethnomusicology===
It is believed that &quot;Arirang&quot; originated from Jeongseon, Gangwon Province. &quot;Arirang&quot; as a term today is ambiguous in meaning, but some linguists have hypothesized that &quot;Ari&quot; () meant &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;rang&quot; () referred to a &quot;beloved one&quot; or &quot;bridegroom&quot; in the ancient native Korean language. With the two words together, the term Arirang meant &quot;My beloved one&quot;. This theory, supported by the scholars such as , bears the song&#x27;s legend. According to the legend, the name is derived from the story of a bachelor and a maiden who fell in love while picking Camellia blossoms near the wharf at Auraji () — a body of water which derives its name from the Korean word &quot;eoureojida&quot; () that is closely translated to &quot;be in harmony&quot; or &quot;to meet&quot;. For example, the body of water that connects the waters of Pyeongchang and Samcheok to the Han River is called Auraji. Two versions of this story exist:

* In the first one, the bachelor cannot cross the Auraji to meet the maiden because the water is too high, so they sing a song to express their sorrow. 
* In the second version, the bachelor attempts to cross the Auraji and drowns, singing the sorrowful song after he dies.

According to , Arirang originated in the mountainous regions of Jeongseon, Gangwon, and the first mention of the song was found in a 1756 manuscript. The Academy of Korean Studies also shares the same view that Arirang was originally the folk song of Jeongseon. Some locals of Jeongseon trace their folk song further back to the era of Goryeo.

Some believe that such song from Jeongseon spread to Seoul and other regions of Korea when the workers from Gangwon were sent to Seoul to rebuild the Gyeongbok Palace under the order of the Prince Regent Heungseon of the Joseon period. Others especially theorize that the words &quot;Arirang&quot; and &quot;Arari&quot; in the song&#x27;s lyrics originated from the families of the workers during this period who said &quot;Arirang ()&quot; or &quot;Ananri ()&quot; to the officials taking the workers from their Gangwon homes to the palace construction in Seoul, the phrases which meant they cannot be separated from their lovers or families respectively. According to &quot;Maecheonyarok&quot; () recorded by the Joseon scholar , it seemed the song was widespread in the country by this time.

The South Korean literary scholar Yang Ju-dong theorized that the term &quot;Arirang&quot; came from the combination of &quot;Ari&quot; (), the old Korean indigenous word that also meant &quot;long&quot;, and &quot;ryeong&quot; ().

Some trace the term &quot;Arirang&quot; to the name of Lady Aryeong, the wife of the first king of Silla, as the song could have evolved from the poem praising her virtues. Others even speculate that the term is linked to the Jurchen word &quot;Arin&quot; meaning &quot;hometown&quot;, or the name of the Indian god with similar name.

===First recording===
The first known recording of &quot;Arirang&quot; was made in 1896 by American ethnologist Alice C. Fletcher. At her home in Washington, D.C., Fletcher recorded three Korean students singing a song she called &quot;Love Song: Ar-ra-rang&quot;. One source suggests that the students belonged to noble Korean families and were studying abroad at Howard University during the period in which the recording was made. Another source suggests that the singers were Korean workers who happened to be living in America during that time. The recordings are currently housed in the U.S. Library of Congress.

===Resistance anthem===
During the Japanese occupation of Korea it became a criminal offense for anyone to sing patriotic songs, including Korea&#x27;s national anthem, so Arirang became an unofficial resistance anthem against Imperial Japanese rule. Korean protesters sang &quot;Arirang&quot; during the March 1 Movement, a Korean demonstration against the Japanese Empire in 1919. Many of the variations of &quot;Arirang&quot; that were written during the occupation contain themes of injustice, the plight of labourers, and guerrilla warfare. It was also sung by the mountain guerrillas who were fighting against the fascists.

The most well-known lyrics to &quot;Arirang&quot; first appeared in the 1926 silent film &quot;Arirang,&quot; directed by Na Woon-gyu. &quot;Arirang&quot; is now considered a lost film but various accounts say the film was about a Korean student who became mentally ill after being imprisoned and tortured by the Japanese. The film was a hit upon its release and is considered the first Korean nationalist film.

===Popularity in Japan===
During the Japanese occupation of Korea, Japan experienced a craze for Korean culture and for &quot;Arirang&quot;, in particular. Over 50 Japanese versions of &quot;Arirang&quot; were released between 1931 and 1943, in genres including pop, jazz, and mambo. Some Japanese soldiers were familiar with &quot;Arirang&quot; from their service in Japanese Korea, or from their interactions with forcibly conscripted Korean comfort women, labourers and soldiers.

==Lyrics==
All versions of &quot;Arirang&quot; include a refrain similar to, &quot;Arirang, arirang, arariyo ().&quot; The word &quot;arirang&quot; itself is nonsensical and does not have a precise meaning in Korean. While the other lyrics vary from version to version, the themes of sorrow, separation, reunion, and love appear in most versions.

The table below includes the lyrics of &quot;Standard Arirang&quot; from Seoul. The first two lines are the refrain. The refrain is followed by three verses.

===Original text in Korean===
===English translation===
:Arirang, arirang, arariyo…
:You are going over Arirang hill.

:My love, if you abandon me
:Your feet will be sore before you go ten &quot;ri&quot;.

:Just as there are many stars in the clear sky,
:There are also many dreams in our heart.

:There, over there, that mountain is Baekdu Mountain,
:Where, even in the middle of winter days, flowers bloom.

==Variations==


There are an estimated 3,600 variations of 60 different versions of &quot;Arirang&quot;. Titles of different versions of &quot;Arirang&quot; are usually prefixed by their place of origin.

While &quot;Jeongseon Arirang&quot; is generally considered to be the original version of the song, &quot;Bonjo Arirang&quot; (literally: Standard Arirang) from Seoul is one of the most famous versions. This version was first made popular when it was used as the theme song of the influential 1926 film &quot;Arirang&quot;.

Other famous variations include &quot;Jindo Arirang&quot; from South Jeolla Province, a region known for being the birthplace of Korean folk music genres pansori and sinawi; and &quot;Miryang Arirang&quot; from South Gyeongsang Province.

==Official status==
===China===
In 2011, Arirang was added to the 3rd batch of &quot;List of Representative Items of National Intangible Cultural Heritage of China&quot;.

In 2023, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, ethnic Korean singer Cui Liling published the first Arirang variation about the Heaven Lake on Jangbaeksan.

===UNESCO===
Both South Korea and North Korea submitted &quot;Arirang&quot; to be included on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list. South Korea successfully submitted the song for inclusion in 2012. North Korea successfully submitted the song for inclusion in 2014.

===South Korea===
In 2015, the South Korean Cultural Heritage Administration added the &quot;Arirang&quot; to its list of important intangible cultural assets.

===U.S. Army===

The U.S. Army&#x27;s 7th Infantry Division adopted &quot;Arirang&quot; as its official march song in May 1956, after receiving permission from Syngman Rhee, the first president of South Korea. The division had been stationed in South Korea from 1950 to 1971, including the Korean War period.

<doc id="328125" wikidata="Q842279" url="?curid=328125" title="Utashinai">
<text>is a city located in Sorachi Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan. It is Japan&#x27;s smallest city by population.

== History ==
Utashinai was formerly a prosperous coal mining city, but its fortunes has declined greatly since the closing of the coal mines. The population peaked at 46,000 in 1948, and has been decreasing every year since.

Efforts to transform Utashinai from a gritty coal mining town to an alpine tourist destination have met with mixed success. The town has adopted a Swiss theme as part of its tourist-oriented strategy and many new buildings are built in the Swiss chalet style. A medium-sized ski hill, Kamoidake, attracts a decent crowd of locals and hosts frequent ski meets, while a hot spring resort called Tyrol, after the Austrian region, is known throughout Hokkaido for the quality of its water. However, despite these new projects, Utashinai continues to experience population decline and economic stagnation. The local high school closed in 2007, with students now traveling to Sunagawa, Akabira or Takikawa for their secondary education.

<doc id="328134" wikidata="Q654738" url="?curid=328134" title="Furano, Hokkaido">
<text>is a city in the prefecture of Hokkaido, Japan, located in the southern reaches of Kamikawa Subprefecture, under whose jurisdiction it resides. Well known throughout Japan as a tourism destination, it is famous for its lavender fields, the television drama Kita no Kuni kara and the Furano Ski Resort, which held the Snowboarding World Cup in recent years. As of September 2016, the city has an estimated population of 22,715 and a density of 38 persons per km2 (98 persons per sq. mi.). The total area is .

== History ==
The city takes its name from the Ainu word &quot;Fura-nui,&quot; which means &quot;Stinky Flame&quot; or &quot;Foul-Smelling Place,&quot; in the language of the indigenous people of Hokkaido. This is most likely because the valley was associated with sulfuric fumaroles near Tokachi Peak. In 1897 the first homesteaders arrived from Mie Prefecture and settled in what is now the Ogiyama area of the city. The Village of Furano was established as a satellite settlement of the then-preeminent Utashinai Village. In 1899 the settlement was transferred from under the jurisdiction of Sorachi County to Kamikawa County, an official town hall was raised, and Furano Village, Sorachi County was officially established.

Mass transportation soon followed when a railway link to Asahikawa, what is now the second largest city in Hokkaido, was opened in 1900. Three years later, Furano was divided into the upper Kamifurano Village (the present-day town of Kamifurano) and the lower Shitafurano Village (present-day Furano and Minamifurano.) In 1908, Minamifurano Village (now a town) established itself as an autonomous municipality. On April 1, 1915, Yamabe Village was created as a separate municipality, and Shimofurano, Sorachi County gained Second Class Village Status in the Hokkaido Village System. Following rapid development, on April 1, 1919, Shitafurano Village achieved town status and was renamed Furano Town. It gained First Class Town Status exactly two years later. During the closing stages of World War II, Furano was bombed by American naval aircraft in July 1945. On September 30, 1956, Furano annexed the village of Higashiyama. Ten years later, Furano annexed the town of Yamabe and the population boost was enough for it to become a full-fledged city. Furano officially changed its name to Furano City on May 1, 1966.

The Furano Valley is nestled between the Tokachi Volcanic Mountain Range (part of the Daisetsuzan National Park) and the Yuubari cluster of summits, including Ashibetsu Peak. The Sorachi and Furano Rivers, both tributaries of the Ishikari River, meet within the city limits. Furano is located at the exact geographic center of Hokkaido, earning it the nickname &quot;Heso no Machi&quot; or &quot;Navel Town.&quot; A monument positioned at the center is located on the grounds of Furano Nishi Junior High School at .

Roughly 70% of the city is mountain and forest. In 1899, the Tokyo University Forest in Hokkaido was established for research purposes in the southeast sector of the city. Nearby lies Rokugo Forest, the setting for the well-known Japanese television drama &quot;Kita no Kuni Kara&quot;.

==Climate==
Furano has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm and occasionally hot and humid summers with high rainfall coupled with cold and extremely snowy winters. For its latitude and being on an island, Furano&#x27;s winters are extremely cold.

== Accent ==
There is a difference in the way that those living in Hokkaido (citizens of Furano included) and those that live in other parts of Japan pronounce the city&#x27;s name. Inside Hokkaido, the first syllable in &quot;Furano&quot; is stressed; however in the rest of Japan the typical pattern of equally and weakly stressed syllables is predominant. The latter pronunciation was used in the drama that made Furano famous, even though it was in contradiction to the local accent.

He updates his blog, CD Furano, almost every day.

<text>William David Mensch, Jr. (born February 9, 1945) is an American electrical engineer born in Quakertown, Pennsylvania. He was a major contributor to the design of the Motorola 6800 8-bit microprocessor and was part of the team led by Chuck Peddle that created the MOS Technology 6502. He also designed the 16-bit successor to the 6502, the 65816.

Mensch is the founder, chairman, and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Western Design Center (WDC) located in Mesa, Arizona. Before founding WDC in 1978, Mensch held design engineering and management positions at Philco-Ford, Motorola, MOS Technology, and Integrated Circuit Engineering. At WDC, Mensch worked mainly on extending and expanding the 6502 architecture. His designs are used widely in embedded systems and implantable, electronic, life-support devices.

==Education, teaching and honors==
Mensch graduated with an associate degree (A.S.) from Temple University in 1966 where he was a member of Sigma Pi fraternity. He received his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in electrical engineering from the University of Arizona in Tucson in 1971. He has taught classes at Arizona State University, including courses on system on chip (SoC) integrated circuit (IC) design. Mensch is a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). In 2004, he was inducted in the Computer Hall of Fame (hosted by the San Diego Computer Museum, part of the San Diego State University Library), and in 2005 was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the University of Arizona&#x27;s College of Engineering.

==Engineering achievements==
Based on his participation in the basic circuit design, definition, and system design of the Motorola 6800 microprocessor and supporting computer chips, Mensch is a co-holder of several 6800 family patents, including the 6800 central processing unit (CPU), 6820/21 Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA), 6850 Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter (ACIA), and 6860 modem chip. He was the sole IC design engineer of the 6820/21 PIA, which was the first peripheral IC to have bit-programmable input/output (I/O).

Before the 6800 family, Mensch had worked on the Mostek 5065 processor.

=== MOS 6502 ===
Along with three other engineers at MOS Technology, Mensch holds the patent on the decimal correct circuitry in the 6502 CPU. He was responsible for the design of basic circuits, oscillator, and buffer, transistor sizing, and instruction decode logic, wishing to minimize the number of levels of logic to achieve faster operation. During this time, when it was common to make errors during design, Chuck Peddle had praised Mensch as a skillful designer and engineer:&quot;«He built seven different chips without ever having an error, almost all done by hand. When I tell people that, they don&#x27;t believe me, but it&#x27;s true. This guy is a unique person. He is the best layout guy in the world.»&quot;Before leaving MOS Technology in 1977, Mensch became their microprocessor design manager.

==Western Design Center==
Shortly after Mensch founded the Western Design Center (WDC) in 1978, Commodore International contracted the company to develop what they called a &quot;macro-micro&quot;, a macro-programmed complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) processor that could be used in a small and powerful calculator. However, WDC was unable to complete the project, and Commodore ended their relationship with the new company. Mensch claimed that Commodore never intended to use his design, and were instead seeking leverage to get a better deal for competing chips from Japanese producer Toshiba.

The first major effort of Mensch and his team was developing the WDC 65C02, an enhanced version of the NMOS 6502 microprocessor. The 65C02, in addition to being implemented in CMOS circuit technology that reduced power use and improved noise immunity, added some new instructions, and corrected several defects in the NMOS 6502. The 65C02 was subsequently adopted for use in the Apple IIc computer and, later, in an enhanced version of the Apple IIe.

Mensch&#x27;s next design, which was to become an important product at WDC, was a 65C02-compatible 16-bit microprocessor, the 65C816, later designated W65C816S. The 65C816&#x27;s design came about following consultation with Apple and was adopted by them for use in the Apple IIGS computer. The 65C816 was later chosen as the core of the Ricoh 5A22 processor that powered the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

Mensch developed the Mensch Computer as a means to promote the W65C816S microprocessor. It was a system designed around the WDC W65C265S microcontroller, which contains a W65C816S core. The computer, which includes the Mensch Works software suite, was produced for a time by WDC and was made for hobby and education uses.

Chuck Peddle and Bill Mensch are regarded as personal computer pioneers, because both the 6502 technology and business model were instrumental in helping launch the personal computer revolution.

==Personal life==
Mensch has five children and resides with his wife, Dianne, in Superstition Mountain, Arizona.

<doc id="328144" wikidata="Q1024739" url="?curid=328144" title="Cabaret (musical)">
<text>Cabaret is an American musical with music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb, and a book by Joe Masteroff. It is based on the 1951 play &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; by John Van Druten, which in turn was based on the 1939 novel &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot; by Christopher Isherwood.

Set in 1929–1930 Berlin during the twilight of the Jazz Age as the Nazis rise to power, the musical focuses on the hedonistic nightlife at the seedy Kit Kat Klub and revolves around American writer Clifford Bradshaw&#x27;s relations with English cabaret performer Sally Bowles. A subplot involves the doomed romance between German boarding house owner Fräulein Schneider and her elderly suitor Herr Schultz, a Jewish fruit vendor. Overseeing the action is the Master of Ceremonies at the Kit Kat Klub, and the club itself serves as a metaphor for ominous political developments in late Weimar Germany.

The original Broadway production opened on November 20, 1966, at the Broadhurst Theatre in New York City and became a box office hit that ran for 1,166 performances. The production won eight Tony Awards and inspired numerous subsequent productions around the world as well as the 1972 film of the same name.

== Background ==
=== Historical basis ===
The events depicted in the 1966 musical are derived from Anglo-American writer Christopher Isherwood&#x27;s autobiographical tales of his colorful escapades in the Weimar Republic. In 1929, Isherwood visited Weimar-era Berlin during the final months of the Golden Twenties. He relocated to Berlin to avail himself of boy prostitutes and to enjoy the city&#x27;s orgiastic Jazz Age cabarets. He socialized with a coterie of gay writers that included Stephen Spender, Paul Bowles, and W.H. Auden. At the time, Isherwood viewed the rise of Nazism in Germany with political indifference and instead focused on writing his first novel.

In Berlin, Isherwood shared modest lodgings with 19-year-old British flapper Jean Ross, an aspiring film actress who earned her living as a chanteuse in lesbian bars and second-rate cabarets. While room-mates at Nollendorfstrasse 17 in Schöneberg, a 27-year-old Isherwood settled into a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old German boy, and Ross became pregnant after engaging in a series of sexual liaisons. She believed the father of the child to be jazz pianist and later film actor Peter van Eyck. As a favor to Ross, Isherwood pretended to be her heterosexual impregnator in order to facilitate an abortion of which Ross nearly died due to the doctor&#x27;s incompetence. Visiting the ailing Ross in a Berlin hospital, Isherwood felt resentment by the hospital staff for, as they assumed, forcing Ross to undergo the abortion. This event inspired Isherwood to write his 1937 novella &quot;Sally Bowles&quot; and is dramatized as its narrative climax.

While Ross recovered from the botched abortion, the political situation rapidly deteriorated in Weimar Germany as the incipient Nazi Party grew stronger day by day. &quot;There was a sensation of doom to be felt in the Berlin streets&quot;, Spender recalled. As Berlin&#x27;s daily scenes increasingly featured &quot;poverty, unemployment, political demonstrations and street fighting between the forces of the extreme left and the extreme right&quot;, Isherwood, Ross, Spender, and other British nationals realized that they must leave the politically volatile country as soon as possible.

Two weeks after the Enabling Act cemented Adolf Hitler&#x27;s dictatorship, Isherwood fled Germany and returned to England on April 5, 1933. Afterwards, the Nazis shuttered most of Berlin&#x27;s seedy cabarets, and many of Isherwood&#x27;s cabaret acquaintances fled abroad or perished in concentration camps. These events served as the genesis for Isherwood&#x27;s Berlin stories. In 1951, playwright John Van Druten adapted Isherwood&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot; into the Broadway play &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; which in turn became a 1955 film starring Laurence Harvey and Julie Harris.

=== Musical development ===
In early 1963, producer David Black commissioned English composer and lyricist Sandy Wilson to undertake a musical adaptation of Van Druten&#x27;s 1951 play &quot;I Am a Camera&quot;. Black hoped that singer Julie Andrews would agree to star in the adaptation, but Andrews&#x27; manager refused to allow her to accept the role of Sally Bowles due to the character&#x27;s immorality. By the time Wilson completed his work, however, Black&#x27;s option on both the 1951 Van Druten play and its source material by Isherwood had lapsed and been acquired by rival Broadway producer Harold Prince. Prince wished to create a gritty adaptation of Isherwood&#x27;s stories that drew parallels between the spiritual bankruptcy of Germany in the 1920s and contemporary social problems in the United States at a time &quot;when the struggle for civil rights for black Americans was heating up as a result of nonviolent but bold demonstrations being held in the Deep South.&quot;

Prince hired playwright Joe Masteroff to work on the adaptation. Both men believed that Wilson&#x27;s score failed to capture the carefree hedonism of the Jazz Age in late 1920s Berlin. They wanted a score that &quot;evoked the Berlin of Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya.&quot; Consequently, Prince invited the songwriting team of John Kander and Fred Ebb to join the project. Kander and Ebb envisioned the work as a dramatic play preceded by a prologue of songs describing the Berlin atmosphere from various points of view. As the composers distributed the songs between scenes, they realized the story could be told in the structure of a more traditional book musical, and they replaced several songs with tunes more relevant to the plot.

For the musical adaptation, playwright Joe Masteroff significantly altered Isherwood&#x27;s original characters. He transformed the English protagonist into an American writer named Clifford Bradshaw; the antisemitic landlady became a tolerant woman with a Jewish beau who owned a fruit store; they cut various supporting characters and added new characters such as the Nazi smuggler Ernst Ludwig for dramatic purposes. The musical ultimately expressed two stories in one: the first, a revue centered on the decadence of the Kit Kat Klub, for which Hal Prince created the Master of Ceremonies (Emcee) character played by Joel Grey; the second, a story set in the society outside the club, thus juxtaposing the lives of the characters based on Isherwood&#x27;s real-life associates and acquaintances with the seedy club.

In fall 1966, the musical entered rehearsals. After viewing one of the last rehearsals before the company headed to Boston for the pre-Broadway run, Prince&#x27;s friend Jerome Robbins suggested cutting the songs outside the cabaret, but Prince ignored his advice. In Boston, lead actress Jill Haworth struggled with her characterization of Sally Bowles. Critics thought Sally&#x27;s blonde hair and white dress suggested a debutante at a senior prom instead of a cabaret singer, so Sally became a brunette before the show opened on Broadway.

Prince staged the show in an unusual way for the time. As the audience entered the theater, they saw the curtain raised, exposing a stage with only a large mirror that reflected the auditorium. Instead of an overture, a drum roll and cymbal crash introduced the opening number. The show mixed dialogue scenes with expository songs and standalone cabaret numbers that provided social commentary. This innovative concept initially surprised audiences. Over time, they discerned the distinction between the two and appreciated the rationale behind them.

== Synopsis ==
=== Act I ===

At the twilight of the Jazz Age in Berlin, the incipient Nazi Party is growing stronger. The Kit Kat Klub is a seedy cabaret – a place of decadent celebration. The club&#x27;s Master of Ceremonies (Emcee) together with the cabaret girls and waiters, warm up the audience (&quot;Willkommen&quot;). Meanwhile, a young American writer named Clifford Bradshaw arrives via a railway train in Berlin. He has journeyed to the city to work on a new novel. Cliff encounters Ernst Ludwig, a German smuggler who offers him black market work and recommends a boarding house. At the boarding house, the proprietress Fräulein Schneider offers Cliff a room for one hundred reichsmarks, but he can only pay fifty. After a brief debate, she relents and allows Cliff to live there for fifty marks. Fräulein Schneider observes that she has learned to take whatever life offers (&quot;So What?&quot;).

When Cliff visits the Kit Kat Klub, the Emcee introduces an English chanteuse, Sally Bowles, who performs a flirtatious number (&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mama&quot;). Afterward, she asks Cliff to recite poetry for her, and he recites Ernest Thayer&#x27;s mock-heroic poem &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot;. Cliff offers to escort Sally home, but she says that her boyfriend Max, the club&#x27;s owner, is too jealous. Sally performs her final number at the Kit Kat Klub aided by a female ensemble of jazz babies (&quot;Mein Herr&quot;). The cabaret ensemble performs a song and dance, calling each other on inter-table phones and inviting each other for dances and drinks (&quot;The Telephone Song&quot;).

The next day at the boarding house, Cliff has just finished giving an English lesson to Ernst when Sally arrives. Max has fired her and thrown her out, and now she has no place to live. Sally asks Cliff if she can live in his room. At first he resists, but she convinces him to take her in (&quot;Perfectly Marvelous&quot;). The Emcee and two female companions sing a song (&quot;Two Ladies&quot;) that comments on Cliff and Sally&#x27;s new living arrangement. Herr Schultz, an elderly Jewish fruit-shop owner who lives in the boarding house, gives a pineapple to Fräulein Schneider as a romantic gesture (&quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Please Me More&quot;). In the Kit Kat Klub, a young waiter starts to sing a song – a patriotic anthem to the Fatherland that slowly descends into a darker, Nazi-inspired marching song (&quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot;). He initially sings &quot;a cappella&quot;, before the customers and the band join in.

Months later, Cliff and Sally are still living together and have grown intimate. Cliff knows that he is in a &quot;dream&quot;, but he enjoys living with Sally too much to come to his senses (&quot;Why Should I Wake Up?&quot;). Sally reveals that she is pregnant, but she does not know who is the father and decides to obtain an abortion. Cliff reminds her that it could be his child and tries to convince her to have the baby (&quot;Maybe This Time&quot;). Ernst enters and offers Cliff a chance to earn easy money – picking up a suitcase in Paris and delivering it to a client in Berlin. The Emcee comments on this with the song &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot; (or, in later versions, &quot;Money&quot;).

Meanwhile, Fräulein Schneider has caught one of her boarders, the prostitute Fräulein Kost, bringing sailors into her room. Fräulein Schneider forbids her from doing so again, but Kost threatens to leave. Kost reveals that she has seen Fräulein Schneider with Herr Schultz in her room. Herr Schultz saves Fräulein Schneider&#x27;s reputation by telling Fräulein Kost that he and Fräulein Schneider are to be married in three weeks. After Fräulein Kost departs, Fräulein Schneider thanks Herr Schultz for lying to Fräulein Kost. Herr Schultz says that he still wishes to marry Fräulein Schneider (&quot;Married&quot;).

At Fräulein Schneider and Herr Schultz&#x27;s engagement party, Cliff arrives and delivers the suitcase of contraband to Ernst. Sally and Cliff gift the couple a crystal fruit bowl. A tipsy Schultz sings &quot;Meeskite&quot; (&quot;meeskite&quot;, he explains, is Yiddish for ugly or funny-looking), a song with a moral (&quot;Anyone responsible for loveliness, large or small/Is not a at all&quot;). Afterward, seeking revenge on Fräulein Schneider, Kost tells Ernst, who now sports a Nazi armband, that Schultz is a Jew. Ernst warns Schneider that marrying a Jew is unwise. Kost and company reprise &quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot;, with more overtly Nazi overtones, as Cliff, Sally, Schneider, Schultz, and the Emcee look on.

=== Act II ===

The cabaret girls – along with the Emcee in drag – perform a kickline routine which eventually becomes a goose-step. Fräulein Schneider expresses her concerns about her impending nuptials to Herr Schultz, who assures her that everything will be all right (&quot;Married&quot; (reprise)). They are interrupted by the crash of a brick being thrown through the glass window of Herr Schultz&#x27;s fruit shop. Schultz tries to reassure her that it is merely rowdy children making trouble, but Fräulein Schneider is now afraid.

Back at the Kit Kat Klub, the Emcee performs a song-and-dance routine with a woman in a gorilla suit, singing that their love has been met with universal disapproval (&quot;If You Could See Her&quot;). Encouraging the audience to be more open-minded, he defends his ape-woman, concluding with, &quot;if you could see her through my eyes... she wouldn&#x27;t look Jewish at all.&quot; Fräulein Schneider goes to Cliff and Sally&#x27;s room and returns their engagement present, explaining that her marriage has been called off. When Cliff protests and states that she can&#x27;t just give up this way, she asks him what other choice she has (&quot;What Would You Do?&quot;).

Cliff begs Sally to leave Germany with him so that they can raise their child together in America. Sally protests and claims that their life in Berlin is wonderful. Cliff urges her to &quot;wake up&quot; and to notice the growing social upheaval around them. Sally retorts that politics have nothing to do with them and returns to the Kit Kat Klub (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Care Much&quot;). At the club, after another heated argument with Sally, Cliff is accosted by Ernst, who has another delivery job for him. Cliff tries to brush him off. When Ernst inquires if Cliff&#x27;s attitude towards him is because of &quot;that Jew at the party&quot;, Cliff attacks him – only to be beaten by Ernst&#x27;s bodyguards and ejected from the club. On stage, the Emcee introduces Sally, who enters to perform again, singing that &quot;life is a cabaret, old chum,&quot; cementing her decision to live in carefree ignorance (&quot;Cabaret&quot;).

The next morning, a bruised Cliff is packing his clothes in his room when Herr Schultz visits. He informs Cliff that he is moving to another boarding house, but he is confident that these difficult times will soon pass. He understands the German people, he declares, because he is a German too. When Sally returns, she announces that she has had an abortion, and Cliff slaps her. She chides him for his previous insistence on keeping the baby, pointing out it would be a &quot;terrible burden&quot; for a child knowing it was the only reason the parents were together. Cliff still hopes that she will join him in France, but Sally retorts that she has &quot;always hated Paris.&quot; She hopes that, when Cliff finally writes his novel, he will dedicate the work to her. Cliff leaves, heartbroken.
On the railway train to Paris, Cliff begins to compose his novel, reflecting on his experiences: &quot;There was a cabaret, and there was a master of ceremonies ... and there was a city called Berlin, in a country called Germany – and it was the end of the world and I was dancing with Sally Bowles – and we were both fast asleep&quot; (&quot;Willkommen&quot; (reprise)). In the Kit Kat Klub, the Emcee welcomes the audience once again as the ensemble reprises &quot;Willkommen&quot; but the song is now harsh and discordant. The Emcee sings, &quot;Auf Wiedersehen... à bientôt...&quot; followed by a drum roll crescendo and a cymbal crash.

=== Song modifications ===
Many songs planned for the 1966 production were cut. Three excised songs – &quot;Good Time Charlie&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;ll All Blow Over&quot;, and &quot;Roommates&quot; – were recorded by Kander and Ebb, and the sheet music published in a collector&#x27;s book. Sally sang &quot;Good Time Charlie&quot; to Cliff as they walked to Fräulein Schneider and Herr Schultz&#x27;s engagement party, mocking Cliff for his gloominess. At the end of the first act, Fräulein Schneider sang &quot;It&#x27;ll All Blow Over,&quot; expressing her concerns about marrying a Jew, while Cliff voiced his worries about Germany&#x27;s emerging Nazism. In the song, Sally declares that all will turn out well in the end. &quot;Perfectly Marvelous&quot; replaced &quot;Roommates&quot; and serves the same plot function of Sally convincing Cliff to let her move in with him.

The 1972 film added several songs, notably &quot;&quot; and &quot;Maybe This Time&quot; which were included in later productions. The latter song had been written by Kander and Ebb for the unproduced musical &quot;Golden Gate&quot;. The later 1987 and 1998 Broadway revivals also added new songs such as &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care Much&quot;. In the 1987 revival, Kander and Ebb wrote a new song for Cliff titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;. In the 1998 revival, &quot;Mein Herr&quot; replaced &quot;The Telephone Song&quot;, and &quot;Maybe This Time&quot; replaced &quot;Why Should I Wake Up?&quot;.

Originally, the Emcee sang &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot; accompanied by the cabaret girls in international costumes with their units of currency representing Russian rubles, Japanese yen, French francs, American dollars, and German reichsmarks. In the 1972 film, the Emcee and Sally Bowles sang &quot;Money, Money&quot; instead of &quot;Sitting Pretty.&quot; The film soundtrack briefly played &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot; as orchestral background music. In the 1987 revival, they presented a special version that combined a medley of both money songs, and they incorporated motifs from the later song into the &quot;international&quot; dance that featured &quot;Sitting Pretty.&quot; In the 1998 revival, they used only the later song written for the film. This version included the cabaret girls and carried a darker undertone.

== Productions ==
=== Original Broadway production ===
The musical opened on Broadway on November 20, 1966, at the Broadhurst Theatre, transferred to the Imperial Theatre and then the Broadway Theatre before closing on September 6, 1969, after 1,166 performances and 21 previews. Directed by Harold Prince and choreographed by Ron Field, the cast featured Jill Haworth as Sally, Bert Convy as Cliff, Lotte Lenya as Fräulein Schneider, Jack Gilford as Herr Schultz, Joel Grey as the Emcee, Edward Winter as Ernst, and Peg Murray as Fräulein Kost. Replacements later in the run included Anita Gillette and Melissa Hart as Sally, Ken Kercheval and Larry Kert as Cliff, and Martin Ross as the Emcee. In addition, John Serry Sr. performed as the orchestral accordionist.

The original Broadway production was not an instant success according to playwright Joe Masteroff due to its perceived immoral content. &quot;When the show opened in Boston,&quot; Masteroff recalled, &quot;there were a lot of walkouts. Once the reviews came out, the public came back.&quot; At the time, actor Joel Grey was merely fifth-billed in the show. Nevertheless, audiences were hypnotized by Grey&#x27;s sinister performance as the Emcee.

In contrast, Jill Haworth&#x27;s performance as Sally was less well-received and was criticized for its blandness. Emory Lewis, the reviewer for &quot;The Morning Call&quot;, wrote that &quot;Jill Haworth, the lovely English actress who played Sally Bowles on opening night, was personable, but she was not sufficiently trained for so pivotal a role. And her voice was small and undramatic. Her performance threw &#x27;Cabaret&#x27; out of kilter.&quot;

The 1967–68 US national tour featured Melissa Hart as Sally, Signe Hasso as Fräulein Schneider, and Leo Fuchs as Herr Schultz. The tour included the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut in December 1967, the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles in May 1968, the Curran Theatre in San Francisco in September 1968, and many others.

=== Original West End production ===
The musical premiered in the West End on February 28, 1968, at the Palace Theatre with Judi Dench as Sally, Kevin Colson as Cliff, Barry Dennen as the Emcee, Lila Kedrova as Fräulein Schneider and Peter Sallis as Herr Schultz. It ran for 336 performances. Critics such as Ken Mandelbaum have asserted that &quot;Judi Dench was the finest of all the Sallys that appeared in Hal Prince&#x27;s original staging, and if she&#x27;s obviously not much of a singer, her Sally is a perfect example of how one can give a thrilling musical theatre performance without a great singing voice.&quot;

=== 1986 West End revival ===

In 1986, the show was revived in London at the Strand Theatre starring Kelly Hunter as Sally, Peter Land as Cliff and Wayne Sleep as the Emcee, directed and choreographed by Gillian Lynne.

=== 1987 Broadway revival ===
The first Broadway revival opened on October 22, 1987, with direction and choreography by Prince and Field. The revival opened at the Imperial Theatre, and then transferred to the Minskoff Theatre to complete its 261-performance run. Joel Grey received star billing as the Emcee, with Alyson Reed as Sally, Gregg Edelman as Cliff, Regina Resnik as Fräulein Schneider, Werner Klemperer as Herr Schultz, and David Staller as Ernst Ludwig. The song &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot; was added for Cliff&#x27;s character.

=== 1993 London revival ===

In 1993, Sam Mendes directed a new production for the Donmar Warehouse in London. The revival starred Jane Horrocks as Sally, Adam Godley as Cliff, Alan Cumming as the Emcee and Sara Kestelman as Fräulein Schneider. Kestelman won the Olivier for Best Supporting Performance in a Musical, and Cumming was nominated for an Olivier Award. Mendes&#x27; concept was different from either the original production or the conventional first revival, particularly with respect to the character of the Emcee. The role, as played by Joel Grey in both prior productions, was a sexually aloof, edgy character with rouged cheeks dressed in a tuxedo. Alan Cumming&#x27;s portrayal was highly sexualized, as he wore suspenders around his crotch and red paint on his nipples. Staging details differed as well. Instead of &quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot; being performed by a male choir of waiting staff, the Emcee plays a recording of a boy soprano singing it. In the final scene, the Emcee removes his outer clothes to reveal a striped uniform of the type worn by the internees in concentration camps; on it are pinned a yellow badge (identifying Jews), a red star (marking Communists and socialists), and a pink triangle (denoting homosexuals). Other changes included added references to Cliff&#x27;s bisexuality, including a brief scene where he kisses one of the Cabaret boys. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care Much,&quot; which was added for the 1987 Broadway revival, was maintained for this production, and &quot;Mein Herr&quot; was added from the film.

This production was filmed by Channel Four Film for airing on UK television.

=== 1998 Broadway revival ===

The second Broadway revival, by the Roundabout Theatre Company, was based on the 1993 Mendes-Donmar Warehouse production. For the Broadway transfer, Rob Marshall was co-director and choreographer. The production opened after 37 previews on March 19, 1998, at the Kit Kat Klub, housed in what previously had been known as Henry Miller&#x27;s Theatre. Later that year it transferred to Studio 54, where it remained for the rest of its 2,377-performance run, becoming the third longest-running revival in Broadway musical history, third only to &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;. Cumming reprised his role as the Emcee, opposite newcomers Natasha Richardson as Sally, John Benjamin Hickey as Cliff, Ron Rifkin as Herr Schultz, Denis O&#x27;Hare as Ernst Ludwig, Michele Pawk as Fräulein Kost, and Mary Louise Wilson as Fräulein Schneider.

The Broadway production was nominated for ten Tony Awards, winning four for Cumming, Richardson and Rifkin, as well as the Tony for Best Revival of a Musical. This production featured a number of notable replacements later in the run: Susan Egan, Joely Fisher, Gina Gershon, Debbie Gibson, Milena Govich, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Melina Kanakaredes, Jane Leeves, Molly Ringwald, Brooke Shields, and Lea Thompson as Sally; Michael C. Hall, Raúl Esparza, Neil Patrick Harris, Adam Pascal, Jon Secada, and John Stamos as the Emcee; Boyd Gaines, Michael Hayden, and Rick Holmes as Cliff; Tom Bosley, Dick Latessa, Hal Linden, Laurence Luckinbill, and Tony Roberts as Herr Schultz; and Blair Brown, Carole Shelley, Polly Bergen, Alma Cuervo, and Mariette Hartley as Fräulein Schneider.

There were a number of changes made between the 1993 and 1998 revivals, despite the similarities in creative team. The cabaret number &quot;Two Ladies&quot; was staged with the Emcee, a cabaret girl, and a cabaret boy in drag and included a shadow play simulating various sexual positions. The score was re-orchestrated using synthesizer effects and expanding the stage band, with all the instruments now being played by the cabaret girls and boys. The satiric &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;, with its mocking references to deprivation, despair and hunger, was eliminated, as it had been in the film version, and where in the 1993 revival it had been combined with &quot;Money&quot; (as it had been in 1987 London production), &quot;Money&quot; was now performed on its own. &quot;Maybe This Time&quot;, from the film adaptation, was added to the score.

=== 2006 West End revival ===
In September 2006, a new production presented by Bill Kenwright opened at the Lyric Theatre, directed by Rufus Norris, and starring Anna Maxwell Martin as Sally, James Dreyfus as the Emcee, Harriet Thorpe as Fräulein Kost, Michael Hayden as Cliff, and Sheila Hancock as Fräulein Schneider. Hancock won the Olivier Award for Best Supporting Performance in a Musical. Replacements later in the run included Kim Medcalf and Amy Nuttall as Sally, Honor Blackman and Angela Richards as Fräulein Schneider, and Julian Clary and Alistair McGowan as the Emcee. This production closed in June 2008 and toured the UK for two years opening at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre with a cast that included Wayne Sleep as the Emcee and Samantha Barks as Sally, before Siobhan Dillon took over the role.

=== 2012 West End revival ===
A revival opened in the West End at the Savoy Theatre on October 3, 2012, following a four-week tour of the UK, including Bromley, Southampton, Nottingham, Norwich and Salford. Will Young played the Emcee and Michelle Ryan portrayed Sally Bowles. Siân Phillips, Harriet Thorpe and Matt Rawle also joined the cast. The production was made by the creative team behind the 2006 London revival, but with new sets, lighting, costumes, choreography and direction.

In August 2013 the show went on tour in the UK, again with Young as the Emcee, Siobhan Dillon reprising her role of Sally and Lyn Paul joining the cast as Fräulein Schneider. The same production toured the UK again in autumn 2017 with Young as the Emcee and Louise Redknapp as Sally. Another UK tour began in autumn 2019 starring John Partridge as the Emcee, Kara Lily Hayworth as Sally Bowles and Anita Harris as Fräulein Schneider.

=== 2014 Broadway revival ===

In September 2013 Roundabout Theatre Company announced plans to return the company&#x27;s acclaimed 1998 production to Studio 54 in New York. For this, the show&#x27;s third Broadway revival, Sam Mendes and Rob Marshall reprised their respective roles as director and co-director/choreographer to recreate their work from the earlier production. Alan Cumming starred again as the Emcee while Academy Award-nominee Michelle Williams made her Broadway debut as Sally Bowles. On October 7, 2013, Tony Award nominees Danny Burstein and Linda Emond joined the cast as Herr Schultz and Fräulein Schneider. The production began a 24-week limited engagement with previews from March 21, 2014, with opening night on April 24, 2014, but the engagement was extended. Emma Stone replaced Michelle Williams as Sally from November 2014 to February 2015. Critics praised Stone&#x27;s performance for her interpretation of the hard-drinking Sally Bowles &quot;as a flaming flapper, the kind hymned by F. Scott Fitzgerald and embodied by the young Joan Crawford in silent movies.&quot; Sienna Miller took over the role on March 29, 2015, remaining through to the show&#x27;s closing. Alan Cumming continued in the role of the Emcee until the show&#x27;s final curtain. 

The production toured the US from January 2016 with Randy Harrison as the Emcee and Andrea Goss (who played Frenchie in the Broadway production). They were later replaced by Jon Peterson and Leigh Ann Larkin.

=== 2021 West End revival ===

Eddie Redmayne and Jessie Buckley starred as the Emcee and Sally Bowles in a West End production directed by Rebecca Frecknall, designed by Tom Scutt, choreographed by Julia Cheng, with lighting design by Isabella Byrd and sound design by Nick Lidster. The production also featured Omari Douglas as Cliff, Liza Sadovy as Fraulein Schneider, Elliot Levey as Herr Schultz, Stewart Clarke as Ernst and Anna-Jane Casey as Fraulein Kost. Produced by Underbelly and Ambassador Theatre Group, and billed as &quot;Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club&quot;, the production began previews November 15, 2021 at Playhouse Theatre, which was reduced to a 550-seat capacity with an intimate in-the-round stage and table seating for some audience members, in effect transforming the theater into a Weimar-era nightclub. The run was extended to October 2022. The production led the 2022 Olivier Award nominations with 11 nods, including Best Musical Revival, Best Actor in a Musical for Redmayne and Best Actress in a Musical for Buckley. The production won seven awards and set a record as the most award-winning revival in Olivier history and the first production to receive awards in all four eligible acting categories.

Following the departure of Redmayne and Buckley, notable players as the Emcee and Sally Bowles have been Fra Fee and Amy Lennox; Callum Scott Howells and Madeline Brewer; Aimee Lou Wood and John McCrea; Maude Apatow and Mason Alexander Park; Jake Shears and Rebecca Lucy Taylor (aka Self Esteem); Luke Treadaway and Cara Delevingne; Layton Williams and Rhea Norwood; Adam Gillen and Katherine Langford; and Billy Porter and Marisha Wallace. 
=== 2024 Broadway revival ===
The 2021 West End production transferred to the August Wilson Theatre on Broadway, with previews from April 1, 2024, ahead of a gala night on April 20 and press night on April 21. As in the West End production, the August Wilson Theatre was refurbished as the &quot;Kit Kat Club&quot; with an intimate in-the-round staging. Redmayne reprised his role as the Emcee with Gayle Rankin and Ato Blankson-Wood co-starring as Sally and Cliff. Bebe Neuwirth, Steven Skybell, Natascia Diaz, and Henry Gottfried play Fraulein Schneider, Herr Schultz, Fraulein Kost, and Ernst Ludwig, respectively. The production was nominated for 9 Tony Awards, winning one for Best Scenic Design. Since September 16, 2024, Adam Lambert and Auli&#x27;i Cravalho have played the Emcee and Sally.

=== Other productions ===
A BBC Radio 2 radio broadcast in 1996 from the Golders Green Hippodrome starred Clare Burt as Sally Bowles, Steven Berkoff as the Emcee, Alexander Hanson as Clifford Bradshaw, Keith Michell as Herr Schultz, and Rosemary Leach as Fräulein Schneider.

Since 2003, international stagings of the show, many influenced by Mendes&#x27; concept, have included productions in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, France, Portugal, Greece, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Serbia, South Africa, Spain and Venezuela. A 2008 production at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival&#x27;s Avon Theatre in Canada, designed by Douglas Paraschuk and directed by Amanda Dehnert, featured Bruce Dow as the Emcee, Trish Lindström as Sally, Sean Arbuckle as Cliff, Nora McClellan as Fräulein Schneider and Frank Moore as Herr Schultz. The Shaw Festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, included &quot;Cabaret&quot; in its 2014 season. The production, which ran from April 10 – October 26, 2014 at the Festival Theatre, was directed by Peter Hinton with choreography by Denise Clarke. It featured Juan Chioran as the Emcee, Deborah Hay as Sally, Gray Powell as Cliff, Benedict Campbell as Herr Schultz, and Corrine Koslo as Fräulein Schneider; it was influenced by Mendes&#x27; 1993 revival.

A 2017 revival played in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, starred Paul Capsis as the Emcee and Chelsea Gibb as Sally. The production mixed elements of the Mendes production, such as its version of &quot;Two Ladies&quot; and its portrayal of a gay Cliff, with the colorful art design of the original (the Emcee is in full makeup and clothed) and most of the additional songs from the 1972 film (with the exception of &quot;Mein Herr&quot;).

== Cast and characters ==

== Recordings ==

The first recording of &quot;Cabaret&quot; was the original Broadway cast album with a number of the songs either truncated (e.g., &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;/&quot;The Money Song&quot;) or outright cut to conserve disk space. When this album was released on compact disc, Kander and Ebb&#x27;s voice-and-piano recordings of songs cut from the musical were added as bonus material. According to Mandelbaum, the 1968 London cast recording features &quot;a more accurate rendering of the score&quot; and includes the Act One finale &quot;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&quot; reprise, the second-act finale as performed in the theatre, and a number of other previously unrecorded bits and pieces.&quot; It was released in the UK and reissued on the CBS Embassy label in 1973.

The 1972 movie soundtrack with Liza Minnelli is much re-written and eliminates all but six of the original songs from the stage production.

Both the 1986 London and 1998 Broadway revival casts were recorded. A 1993 two-CD studio recording contains nearly the entire score, including songs written for the movie and for later productions and much of the incidental music. This recording features Jonathan Pryce as the Emcee, Maria Friedman as Sally, Gregg Edelman as Cliff, Judi Dench as Fräulein Schneider, and Fred Ebb as Herr Schultz. The cast recording of the 2006 London revival at the Lyric Theatre includes James Dreyfus as the Emcee and Anna Maxwell Martin as Sally.

The 2021 London cast recording featuring Eddie Redmayne and Jessie Buckley was recorded live at the Playhouse Theatre, London) and released in January 2023. &quot;Cabaret: The Maida Vale Session&quot; is an EP that was released in March 2024 with four songs from the revival at the Playhouse Theatre, including &quot;Willkommen&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mama&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care Much&quot; and the title song. It was recorded for a BBC Radio 2 show with Jo Whiley at the BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios with Jake Shears as Emcee, Rebecca Lucy Taylor as Sally and the 2023 London cast and orchestra.

In addition to these recordings, cast albums for French, Spanish, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Austrian, Dutch, Mexican, and German productions have been released.

<text>David Paden Marchand (born David Paden Passaro, November 20, 1975), known professionally as Davey Havok, is an American singer and musician who is the lead vocalist of the rock band AFI, the synth-pop band Blaqk Audio, the hardcore punk band XTRMST, and the new wave band Dreamcar. Among various other ventures, he performed lead vocals for Son of Sam&#x27;s debut album and for fictional band My Purple Agony in the animated series &quot;Harvey Girls Forever!&quot;.

Havok is an outspoken advocate of the straight edge lifestyle and veganism.

==Early life==
Havok was born David Paden Passaro, in Rochester, New York on November 20, 1975. He is of Italian ancestry.

When Havok was age 5, his father died, and he and his mother moved from Rochester to Sacramento, California to be closer to family. His mother remarried and Havok took on the surname of his stepfather (Marchand), and was enrolled in Catholic school through eighth grade. The family moved to Ukiah, California in the late 1980s, where he graduated from Ukiah High School in 1993.

Following high school, Havok attended University of California, Berkeley. Following his sophomore year, his career with AFI started, and Havok did not return to the university.

==Musical career==
===AFI===

Havok and his friends, Mark Stopholese and Vic Chalker, decided to start a band in high school, but they did not own or play any instruments. Stopholese suggested that Adam Carson might be able to fill the role of drummer because he owned a drum set. That band became AFI.

After high school, the band broke up when its members left for college. Havok attended UC Berkeley. There, he began writing lyrics that later appeared on AFI&#x27;s first two albums.

After gaining some popularity in their absence, AFI played a show at the Phoenix Theater for several hundred fans. Following the positive reception, they decided to reunite and record an album. In 1995, &quot;Answer That and Stay Fashionable&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album, was released on Wingnut Records and in 1996, &quot;Very Proud of Ya&quot; was released on Nitro Records. In 1997, the band released &quot;Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes&quot;.

The next release was the &quot;A Fire Inside EP&quot;, which features covers of &quot;The Hanging Garden&quot; by the Cure and &quot;Demonomania&quot; by the Misfits. In 1999, the band released &quot;Black Sails in the Sunset&quot;, which was the first album to include the current line-up: Havok, Carson, Hunter Burgan and Jade Puget. In the fall of 1999, they released the &quot;All Hallows EP&quot;.

In 2000, they released &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot; to fair record sales. The group had toured with another band, Samhain, on their reunion tour; Havok later joined three members of Samhain and recorded an album under the name Son of Sam. In 2000, when Michale Graves had left the Misfits, Havok was approached by Roadrunner Records to be the lead singer of Misfits. However, Havok told an interviewer that he never would leave AFI as it was his own band.

AFI continued to tour for a few years and released a few EPs along the way.
In 2003, &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot;, the band&#x27;s first major label release, was released, achieving platinum status in the U.S. and Canada and Gold in Australia. On June 6, 2006, &quot;Decemberunderground&quot; was released on Interscope Records, again achieving platinum status in the U.S. and Canada and Gold in Australia.

AFI&#x27;s DVD &quot;I Heard a Voice – Live from Long Beach Arena&quot; was released on December 12, 2006, containing a live concert from Long Beach Arena from September 15, 2006. This DVD was released as a CD-version in November 2007. &quot;Decemberunderground&quot; achieved double platinum status in 2013, having sold more than 2 million copies worldwide. AFI&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Crash Love&quot; was released on September 29, 2009, and &quot;Burials&quot; was released on October 22, 2013.

In late 2016, AFI released a series of teaser videos featuring song clips and backwards audio, eventually revealed to be promotion for &quot;AFI&quot; (also known as &quot;The Blood Album&quot;), released on January 20, 2017 via Concord Music Group. In 2022, AFI had the Bodies tour. For the 20 year anniversary of &quot;Sing the Sorrows,&quot; AFI performed the album in its entirety on March 11, 2023 at a sold out concert in Inglewood, CA .

===Son of Sam===
In 2000, Havok formed Son of Sam alongside the 1999 reunion lineup of Samhain. This lineup released one album &quot;Songs from the Earth&quot; in 2001.

===Blaqk Audio===

On August 14, 2007, Havok&#x27;s electronic side project with AFI guitarist Jade Puget, Blaqk Audio, released their first album, titled &quot;CexCells&quot;. Blaqk Audio went on a two-month-long American/Canadian tour following the release. Blaqk Audio&#x27;s &quot;Bright Black Heaven&quot; was released in September 2012, and a brief American tour followed. &quot;Material&quot; was released on April 15, 2016; &quot;Only Things We Love&quot; was released on March 15, 2019; &quot;Beneath the Black Palms&quot; was released August 21, 2020; &quot;Trop d&#x27;amour&quot; was released on September 16, 2022. On September 24, 2022, the Fonda had a one night only record release concert.

===XTRMST===
A number of cassette tapes appeared around some California record stores in early 2014, bearing the band name XTRMST. Listeners soon noted that the band&#x27;s vocalist sounded like Havok, and rumors began spreading that he was the group&#x27;s singer. On March 17, 2014, Jade Puget confirmed via Twitter that XTRMST was his and Havok&#x27;s project. The band, a straight edge metalcore act, released its self-titled album via Dim Mak Records in late 2014.

===Dreamcar===
In 2016, it was revealed that Havok had formed Dreamcar with No Doubt members Tom Dumont, Tony Kanal and Adrian Young. The band performed at Coachella 2017 on April 15 and 22 and performed at Austin City Limits 2017 on October 7 and 14.

==Other ventures==

===Fashion and modeling===
Havok and Jeffree Star modeled for Tarina Tarantino&#x27;s jewelry line, Tokyo Hardcore in 2007. Havok was a presenter at the Mélange Fashion Show on August 6, 2011 in San Francisco. He was featured in the June 2012 issue of &quot;VAR Magazine&quot; and in &quot;Herring &amp; Herring: Framed&quot; in 2014.

===Acting===
Havok played a supporting role in Sarah Jacobson&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Mary Jane&#x27;s Not a Virgin Anymore&quot;. In 2009, Havok joined the cast of the &quot;illustrated film&quot; series &quot;Godkiller&quot;. Havok voices the antagonist role, a fallen god named Dragos. For March 2011, Havok joined the cast of Green Day&#x27;s &quot;American Idiot&quot; on Broadway, playing the role of St. Jimmy. Havok is featured in at least one episode of Tim Armstrong&#x27;s musical web series &quot;Tim Timebomb&#x27;s RockNRoll Theatre&quot;. In addition to Armstrong&#x27;s web show, Havok voiced Hay in John Roecker&#x27;s 2006 stop motion animated film Live Freaky! Die Freaky! which tells the story of the Manson family. He had a small acting role in the 2012 film &quot;Knife Fight&quot;.

===Books===
On February 21, 2013, Havok announced that he had written &quot;Pop Kids&quot; and published it through Black Candy Publishing. The novel was released April 2013.

Havok released &quot;Love Fast Los Angeles&quot; in February 2018.

===Clothing lines===
Glitterboy was a short-lived fashion line created by Havok. It was partly inspired by the 1970s glam music scene, among other things. Clothing line Paden was released in 2007 and was available exclusively through Fred Segal clothing stores in California.

Havok&#x27;s Zu Boutique was launched in August 2008. The line was vegan and featured T-shirts with a limited pressing of 100 shirts per design. A jewelry line was released in March 2009 in collaboration with PNUT Jewelry, the side project of Rusty Pistachio of punk band H2O fame. The jewelry was also limited, with only 10 to 90 pieces of each design made. In August 2009, in collaboration with Macbeth Footwear, Zu released a line of limited-edition shoes. Plagued by legal trouble, Zu Boutique vanished in 2012. Havok continues to collaborate with PNUT Jewelry.

==Personal life==

Havok is a vegan and was voted the winner of peta2&#x27;s annual &quot;World&#x27;s Sexiest Vegetarian&quot; contest in 2007. Havok appeared on the cover of &quot;Vegan Health and Fitness&quot; magazine for their March/April 2015 issue. He has said reading &quot;Diet for a New America&quot; by John Robbins caused him to adopt a vegan diet.

In more recent years, Havok had some of his tattoos &quot;blacked out&quot;, saying &quot;I&#x27;m constantly changing, and it&#x27;s an attempt to cover up bad decisions with worse decisions. That&#x27;s how I live life.&quot;

<doc id="328154" wikidata="Q632866" url="?curid=328154" title="Takuan Sōhō">
<text>was a Japanese Buddhist prelate during the Sengoku and early Edo Periods of Japanese history. He was a major figure in the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism. Noted for his calligraphy, poetry, tea ceremony, he is also popularly credited with the invention of the &quot;takuan&quot; pickled radish.

==Biography==
Takuan Sōhō was born as the second son of Akiba Tsunanori, a samurai and senior retainer of the Yamana clan in the town of Izushi, in Tajima Province (present-day Toyooka, Hyōgo). When he was eight years old, the Yamana clan were defeated by the forces of Oda Nobunaga led by Hashiba Hideyoshi, making his father a &quot;ronin&quot;. In 1582 Takuan entered the temple of Shōen-ji in Izushi as an acolyte, and in 1586 he was sent to the temple of Sōkyō-ji, also in Izushi, to further studies. In 1591, Maeno Nagayasu, the lord of Izushi Castle during this period, invited Kaoru Sotada a disciple of Daitoku-ji&#x27;s Shunoku Sōen to administer Sōkyō-ji and Takuan became his disciple. When Kaoru was transferred back to Daitoku-ji in 1594, Takuan accompanied him to Kyoto. There, he studied also directly under Shunoku Sōen at the temple of Sangen-in. In 1599, when Ishida Mitsunari built a memorial temple for his mother in Sawayama Castle, Shunoku and Takuan relocated to Sawayama and remained into the following year. However, after the fall of the castle subsequent to the Battle of Sekigahara and the death of Ishida Mitsunari, Takuan escaped. He was able to recover the body of the executed Ishida Mitsunari and assisted in his funeral services at Sangen-in in Kyoto. After his mentor, Kaoru Sotada died, Takuan relocated to Sakai in Izumi Province. He took the name of &quot;Takuan&quot; in 1604, having used a number of names up until this point as assigned by various of his teachers.

In 1607, Takuan returned to Daitoku-ji and in 1609 was appointed its 154th head abbot. However, he left after only a few days for a prolonged period of traveling, claiming that he neither sought nor wanted the responsibility. Throughout his journeys, Takuan raised and collected funds for the renovation of Daitoku-ji and other Zen temples. In 1620, he returned to his home town of Izushi where the temple of Sukyo-ji had recently been restored by the new &quot;daimyo&quot; of Izushi Domain, Koide Yoshihide.

Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the government imposed strict regulations on Buddhist temples, and in the case of influential temples such as Daitoku-ji, sought to weaken or break their relationship with the Imperial Court. In the case of Daitoku-ji in particular, it had been tradition that the priesthood was appointed by imperial decree, but now the shogunate declared that such appointments would need to be approved first by the Shogun in Edo. In what later came to be called the , in 1627, Emperor Go-Mizunoo awarded the purple robes of priesthood to senior monks at Daitoku-ji. The shogunate promptly declared this action to be illegal and ordered the Kyoto Shoshidai to confiscate the robes. Takuan, together with the senior priesthood of Daitoku-ji and Myōshin-ji protested this action, and were arrested. They were tried for sedition at Edo Castle in front of Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada and Takuan was banished to Kaminoyama in Dewa Province. In 1632, after the death of Hidetada, a general amnesty was proclaimed. Takuan returned to Daitoku-ji and was received in an audience arranged by Yagyū Munenori and Tenkai in Kyoto by Tokugawa Iemitsu, who was very much impressed by Takuan&#x27;s intelligence and insights. At Iemitsu&#x27;s invitation, he returned to Edo, where he gave many lectures to Iemitsu, who eventually rescinded the &quot;Purple Robes decree&quot; in 1641, restoring Daitoku-ji to its original honors. In the meantime, Iemitsu had the temple of Tōkai-ji constructed in Shinagawa at the outskirts of Edo in 1639 especially for Takuan, so that he could draw on Takuan&#x27;s counsel at any time.

Takuan refused to give Dharma transmission, preferring instead to cut off his line. He felt the Dharma was not something which could be passed on, and thus, did not depend on an unbroken transmission from teacher to disciple. His final instructions were, “I have no disciple who has succeeded to my Dharma [i.e., teaching]. After I am dead, if anyone says he is my heir, that person is a Dharma thief. Report him to the authorities and see that he is punished severely!”

Takuan died in Edo in 1645. In the moments before his death, he wrote the &quot;kanji&quot; for &quot;dream&quot; (&quot;yume&quot; 夢), and laid down his brush. He also left behind a will stating that a &quot;tombstone must not be built&quot; and that he should be buried without any ceremony in an unmarked grave. His disciples promptly erected gravestones at the temple of Tōkai-ji (東海寺) and also at the temple of Sukyō-ji (宗鏡寺) in Izushi. His grave at Tōkai-ji was proclaimed a National Historic Site in 1926.

==Teachings==
Takuan taught that the Right Mind, which he also called the Mind of No-Mind, is not placed anywhere, but rather moves about freely in all directions, and &quot;neither congeals nor fixes itself in one place.&quot; For Takuan, for the mind to have some place of abiding and stopping is the mind of delusion and the affliction of abiding in ignorance. According to Takuan, the mind that fixes itself in one place is not able to function freely. For instance, Takuan points out that if the mind is placed in just one direction, it will be lacking in nine others. But if the mind is not placed in any one direction, it will be in all ten simultaneously, or as Takuan says, &quot;Put nowhere, it will be everywhere.&quot; 

To illustrate this point, Takuan gives the example of gazing upon a tree. He says if, when looking on a tree, the eye is fixed upon a single leaf, then all the other leaves will be as though invisible to it. But if the eye is not detained by any one leaf, the entire tree with all its leaves will be taken in simultaneously. He likens this ability to that of Avalokiteśvara&#x27;s with a thousand arms, for whom all thousand arms are simultaneously useful because Avalokiteśvara&#x27;s mind is not detained by any one of them. 

Takuan appeals to this principle to also critique such practices as placing the mind below the navel in concentration. He says, &quot;...viewed from the highest standpoint of Buddhism, putting the mind just below the navel and not allowing it to wander is a low level of understanding, not a high one. [...] If you consider putting your mind below your navel and not letting it wander, your mind will be taken by the mind that thinks of this plan. You will have no ability to move ahead and will be exceptionally unfree.&quot; 

Takuan taught that one&#x27;s mind should not be detained by thoughts, for in that case, though one listens, one will not hear; and though one looks, one will not see. On the other hand, Takuan pointed out that to try to remove one&#x27;s thoughts is to become preoccupied with the thought of removing them. Instead, he says that if one does not think about it, the mind will remove these thoughts on its own and come to the condition of No-Mind by itself.

==Legacy==

Takuan advised and befriended many people, from all social strata. Some of these included:
* Itō Ittōsai (Kenjutsu master, founder of the Ittō-ryū)
* Mikogami Tenzen (Kenjutsu master, successor of Itō Ittōsai)
* Yagyū Munenori (&quot;daimyō&quot; and kenjutsu master, head of Yagyū Shinkage-ryū style of swordsmanship) Takuan&#x27;s writings to Lord Yagyū Munenori and Mikogami Tenzen are commonly studied by contemporary martial artists.
* Ishida Mitsunari (&quot;daimyō&quot;)
* Kuroda Nagamasa (Christian &quot;daimyō&quot;)
* Go-Mizunoo (abdicated Japanese Emperor)
* Tokugawa Iemitsu (&quot;shōgun&quot;)

Takuan remained largely unaffected by his popularity and famed reputation. Known for his acerbic wit and integrity of character, Takuan exerted himself to bring the spirit of Zen Buddhism to many and diverse aspects of Japanese culture, such as Japanese swordsmanship, gardening, sumi-e, shodo, and sado.

His collected writings total six volumes and over 100 published poems, including his best known treatise, &quot;The Unfettered Mind&quot;. His influence permeates the work of many present-day exponents of Zen Buddhism and martial arts. He has been credited with the invention of the yellow pickled daikon radish that carries the name &quot;takuan&quot;.

Of the three essays included in &quot;The Unfettered Mind&quot;, two were letters
* Fudochishinmyoroku, &quot;The Mysterious Record of Immovable Wisdom&quot;, written to Yagyū Munenori, head of the Yagyū Shinkage school of swordsmanship and teacher to two generations of shoguns.
* Taiaki, &quot;Annals of the Sword Taia&quot;, written perhaps to Munenori or possibly to Ono Tadaaki, head of the Itto school of swordsmanship and an official instructor to the shogun&#x27;s family and close retainers.

Takuan&#x27;s morality has become the object of scathing criticism. Brian D. Victoria in &quot;Zen at War&quot; argues that Takuan is among the chief culprits of Zen Buddhism that created a religion unrecognizable as Buddhist. It is because Takuan repeatedly makes reference to the emptiness of opponents who may be murdered without consequence. Victoria understands Takuan to have transgressed the first grave Buddhist precept of &#x27;Do not kill.&#x27; This revisionist view is controversial.

==Fictional appearances==
He is featured as a character in &quot;Vagabond&quot;, a manga series, which is largely based on Eiji Yoshikawa&#x27;s equally successful book, &quot;Musashi&quot;.

Director/writer Yoshiaki Kawajiri in his popular animated film &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; created one of main characters Dakuan as a homage to Takuan Soho.

In director Hiroshi Inagaki&#x27;s Samurai trilogy (Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto, Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple and Samurai III: Duel at Ganryu Island), Takuan is played by Kuroemon Onoe and is portrayed as the mentor of Miyamoto Musashi.

<text>North Hennepin Community College (NHCC) is a public community college in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. It was founded in 1966 and is a member of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system.

== History ==
The college was founded in 1966 as North Hennepin State Junior College, opening concurrently with two other state junior colleges in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, Anoka-Ramsey Community College and Minnesota Metropolitan State College (now Metropolitan State University). North Hennepin operated during its first three years in the former facilities of Osseo Junior High School in Osseo. Classes were first offered in September 1966, with a first semester enrollment of 425 students. The current site in Brooklyn Park was selected in 1967, and the new campus opened in the fall of 1969. The school&#x27;s name was changed to North Hennepin Community College in 1973.

<text>David Orchard (born June 28, 1950) is a Canadian author and political figure, member of the Liberal Party of Canada, who was the Liberal Party candidate for the Saskatchewan riding of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River in the 2008 federal election.

Previously, Orchard was a member of the now defunct Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (PC Party), and opposed the party&#x27;s merger with the Canadian Alliance to form the Conservative Party of Canada. Orchard has never held political office in Canada, but has been involved in leadership conventions and other political activities. He is perhaps best known for his campaign to oppose the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement. Orchard has become a prominent activist against the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement arguing it would weaken Canada&#x27;s sovereignty and control of its resources. He also campaigned against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas and the proposed Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI).

Orchard is a fourth-generation organic grain farmer, and also the author of the bestselling book &quot;The Fight for Canada: Four Centuries of Resistance to American Expansionism&quot;. He was also a co-founder of CCAFT (Citizens Concerned About Free Trade) in 1985.

==Early life==
Orchard was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Educated in Borden, he went on to study arts and science and then law at the University of Saskatchewan in nearby Saskatoon, although he did not graduate. He later studied French at Quebec City&#x27;s Université Laval. Orchard is the fourth-generation on his family farm on which he has farmed organically for over 30 years.

==Positions==
Orchard sees himself as a &quot;Red&quot; or moderate Tory and claims to be ideologically inspired by his political idols former prime ministers John Diefenbaker, Lord Richard Bennett, Sir Robert Borden and Sir John A. Macdonald. He is passionately opposed to Canadian economic integration with the U.S., including the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he says impedes Canada&#x27;s economic and cultural sovereignty. He has criticized many aspects of the United States foreign policy including wars and invasions of small nations.

Orchard supports government social programs, and is a strong supporter of the environment. Orchard is a devoted monarchist, and opposes a weakening of federal powers in favour of the provinces. He also supported the campaign against the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords, calling them &quot;The mortal weakening of the central government&quot;. He also advocates that 3 to 5% of the Gross Domestic Product go to military spending. He is opposed to gun control. He is a social conservative, and (according to the &quot;National Post&quot;) opposes same-sex marriage, a charge he has denied.

Orchard describes his own views as being conservative in the &quot;historical mainstream&quot; and &quot;centrist&quot; of the PC party, and claimed they would appeal to moderate Canadians. Orchard&#x27;s beliefs are perhaps best likened to that of the traditional, British Tory, which although historically common in Canada, lost much of their relevance since the rise of the so-called neoconservative faction. He has been shunned by many conservatives, who often accuse him of being out of step with modern conservatism and too far to the left. Such claims were common during his bids for PC leader, when he was accused being an opportunist who tried to practise entryism, and take over the Progressive Conservative Party and steer it sharply to the left and away from the conservatism of Brian Mulroney and Margaret Thatcher.

He has never been elected to the House of Commons of Canada or to any public office. As a Progressive Conservative, he sought election in the federal riding of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan in the 2000 federal election. He placed a distant fourth, although with the highest percentage vote received by a Progressive Conservative candidate in Saskatchewan since 1993. He lost in the 2008 Canadian federal election, placing second in the Saskatchewan riding of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, as the Liberal candidate.

==1998 Progressive Conservative leadership campaign==
Orchard ran twice for the PC leadership: in 1998 and in 2003. In his first attempt, he finished a distant second to former prime minister Joe Clark on the final ballot but attracted a very different group of supporters to the Tory party in doing so. Many of Orchard&#x27;s supporters were former members of the other political parties in Canada and two of Orchard&#x27;s most prominent endorsers in the leadership bid were the leaders of the Green parties of British Columbia and Ontario. During the relatively quiet race, Clark referred to Orchard as a &quot;tourist&quot; in the Tory party because of his left-leaning economic platform and opposition to the free trade agreements brokered by the Mulroney government. In one debate, opponent Brian Pallister quipped that &quot;Mr. Orchard is so left-wing, he thinks Svend Robinson is a right-wing maniac.&quot;

However, Orchard did gain respect from PC circles when he chose to stick with the Tories after Clark&#x27;s victory. Orchard and his political advisor, Marjaleena Repo, worked hard after his failed leadership bid to rebuild several Saskatchewan PC constituency associations and improve PC membership sales across Canada. Orchard was one of Clark&#x27;s staunchest defenders during the lead-up to the August 2002 convention that saw Clark resign as Tory leader after the disintegration of the parliamentary PC-Democratic Representative Caucus coalition in May 2002.

==2003 Progressive Conservative leadership campaign==
Respect for Orchard grew in the Red Tory wing of the PC Party: roughly one-quarter of the party membership supported him during the 2003 PC leadership campaign, including Joe Clark&#x27;s wife, Maureen McTeer. Orchard ultimately came in third on the third ballot in the 2003 PC convention, behind Nova Scotia Member of Parliament (MP) Peter MacKay and Calgary lawyer Jim Prentice. Orchard decided to support Peter MacKay over Jim Prentice due to the latter&#x27;s implicit support for a United Alternative (merger of the party with the Canadian Alliance (CA) party). However, Orchard&#x27;s support, which helped Peter MacKay win the leadership, came at price. MacKay signed a written deal, or &quot;gentleman&#x27;s agreement&quot; to seal support from Orchard&#x27;s largely loyal delegates on the final ballot.

===The MacKay-Orchard deal===
The deal promised a review of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, no joint candidates with the Canadian Alliance, and a promise to redouble efforts to rebuild the national status of the Progressive Conservative Party. The agreement also included reexamining the PC Party&#x27;s policies on government subsidies for national railways and preserving the environment. This agreement was controversial, and some time passed before it was released to the public. Many in the PC Party approved of the deal, including leadership candidate Scott Brison.

At first MacKay had seemed to be willing to adhere to the deal. In July, MacKay struck up a &quot;Blue Ribbon PC Policy Review Panel&quot;, chaired by Tory MP Bill Casey, in order to reexamine the party&#x27;s policies on NAFTA.

However, before the Panel could meet, MacKay encouraged talks between high-profile members of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives. In October 2003, the talks culminated in MacKay and Stephen Harper, leader of the Canadian Alliance, signing an agreement in principle to merge the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance to form the new Conservative Party of Canada.

==Anti-merger activist==
Orchard unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the merger. In a high-profile news conference in early November he suggested that the new Conservative Party of Canada was &quot;an abomination, conceived in deception, born in betrayal.&quot; He urged PC Party members to vote &quot;no&quot; on any referendum and also encouraged &quot;loyal members&quot; to express their frustrations with Peter MacKay. Orchard argued that his efforts were not based on self-promotion but rather on preserving Canada&#x27;s founding party and preventing a takeover of the moderate values and membership of the PCs by the neoconservative values of the Alliance membership.

Orchard opposed the right wing, and in his view slavishly pro-U.S. views of the Canadian Alliance. Orchard argued that before the merger was announced, the Canadian Alliance and its leader, Stephen Harper, were highly unpopular and a moment was fast approaching for the PCs to reemerge as the national alternative to the governing Liberals. Orchard suggested that MacKay&#x27;s &quot;traitorous&quot; actions put the above scenario in jeopardy. Some other notable Tories such as Joe Clark, Flora MacDonald, Brian Peckford and Sinclair Stevens also opposed the merger.

In a last-ditch attempt to stop the merger, Orchard went to court, seeking an injunction against the merger vote. The case was thrown out of court on the grounds that a merger through a &quot;national convention&quot; did not violate the PC Party constitution. The merger was ratified with 96% support by members of the Canadian Alliance in a one-member-one-vote process on December 5. The PC Party opted for a &quot;virtual convention&quot; in which delegates were selected in ridings and then attended local provincial urban centres in which they voted for or against the merger.

Orchard described the process as fraudulent and undemocratic, as the convention delegates never actually voted together in any fixed location. The convention produced a result in which 90.5% of the Progressive Conservative Party delegates voted in favour of the merger. However, Orchard and other opponents claimed the result was not representative of the true PC membership, pointing out that new memberships in the party were sold almost up to the day of the vote, many of which were card holders of the larger Canadian Alliance and the PC members were being swamped.

==A lost battle==
Many analysts have suggested that Orchard&#x27;s battle to preserve the PC Party may have been vigorous but ultimately pointless. By the time the agreement in principle was formalized in October, the fate of the PC Party may have been practically sealed. Orchard himself had commented as early as September that the party&#x27;s preparations for a widely expected 2004 federal election were in disarray. Since becoming leader, MacKay and the party&#x27;s ruling council had done little to facilitate election readiness and preparation which may have been an early signal of MacKay&#x27;s intentions to not run a full slate of 308 PC candidates in the expected election.

Orchard also faced speculation from some opponents and journalists in regard to his motivations to preserve the Progressive Conservative political name brand. Some critics suggested that he was really attempting to undermine Peter MacKay&#x27;s merger stance in order to force a resignation and prompt another leadership race, allowing for a &quot;takeover&quot; by Orchard and his supporters.

==Aftermath==
Now Orchard was (by virtue of having membership in the now-defunct PC party) an unhappy member of the Conservative Party. Shortly before the Conservative Party&#x27;s March 2005 policy convention, Orchard had his renewed membership revoked by the party and was denied access to the event. &quot;The council decided that it was in the interests of the party that they didn&#x27;t want him to be a member of the party any longer,&quot; said Ian Brodie, the executive director of the Conservative Party.

In February 2004, he was asked to take over the leadership of the struggling Canadian Action Party after the resignation of its leader, Paul Hellyer, but Orchard declined. There were also rumours that Orchard was in discussions over a future Saskatchewan rural riding candidacy for the Saskatchewan Party, and Orchard&#x27;s name was frequently touted as a possible future leadership contender for the Green Party of Canada.

On January 31, 2006, a Toronto judge ordered the Conservative Party of Canada to pay Orchard $70,000, the funds from his 2003 leadership campaign which he had been owed since then. The CPC had previously insisted on Orchard&#x27;s signing a pledge not to sue Peter MacKay over issues resulting from the agreement signed at the 2003 PC Leadership Convention in order to settle the affair, which Orchard refused to do.

Orchard continues to write for major newspapers, present lectures in Canada&#x27;s universities on foreign policy and environmental issues, and continues working in the organic farming business.

==Joining the Liberals==

On November 19, 2005, CBC Radio News reported that the Liberals were trying to recruit Orchard as a candidate in the 2006 federal election. According to the report, Orchard would be a Liberal candidate in either Saskatchewan or rural Ontario. Orchard did not run as a Liberal in the 2006 federal election but he announced his support for the Liberals and campaigned for Chris Axworthy in Saskatchewan, Yves Picard and Isa Gros-Louis in Quebec City, and Susan Whelan in Ontario. Orchard also officially became a member of the Liberal Party of Canada during the 2006 election.

After the Liberals were defeated, and leader Paul Martin stepped down, there was some media speculation that Orchard would seek the Liberal Party leadership. Instead, on August 17, 2006 Orchard endorsed Stéphane Dion to be the next leader of the federal Liberal Party. At the 2006 leadership convention, Orchard led a group of approximately 150 delegates, including 32 from Saskatchewan, in support of Dion. Those delegates ended up being pivotal in helping Dion pass Gerard Kennedy for third place on the first convention ballot, and eventually win the leadership when Kennedy swung his own support behind Dion after the second ballot.

Subsequently, Orchard declared that he would be seeking the nomination in the Saskatchewan riding of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River as a Liberal candidate in the forthcoming by-election in that riding. Again, however, Orchard&#x27;s ambitions created political controversy. Orchard&#x27;s nomination fight was ultimately terminated on January 3, 2008 when Dion announced via a news release that Joan Beatty would be appointed as the candidate for that riding, a decision that was the subject of some controversy.

Métis leader Jim Durocher, an Orchard supporter, wrote a letter to Dion complaining about his decision to appoint a candidate rather than allow for party members to vote in a nomination meeting. He argued that &quot;the people of this riding resent, and I personally resent mightily, the attitude of certain southerners that they know what&#x27;s best for our riding.&quot;
Durocher, a former Liberal candidate, also told Dion &quot;If you impose Joan Beatty, the Liberals will lose this riding.&quot;

National Liberal campaign co-chair David Smith, however, defended Beatty&#x27;s appointment by saying that Dion had made getting more women into politics a priority, saying that the party is &quot;prepared to bite the bullet to demonstrate that our commitment to increasing our number of women candidates – particularly well-qualified ones – is very real.&quot; The media also reported that Liberal party House Leader and Saskatchewan MP Ralph Goodale, a former finance minister, was opposed to Orchard&#x27;s candidacy in the by-election.

Beatty lost the ensuing byelection to Conservative candidate Rob Clarke. On August 14, it was reported that Orchard would challenge Beatty for the Liberal nomination in Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River for the 2008 federal election. Orchard won the nomination, but placed second in the election, losing to Clarke by 3,148 votes.

<doc id="328159" wikidata="Q328" url="?curid=328159" title="English Wikipedia">
<text>The English Wikipedia is the primary English-language edition of Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. It was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on 15 January 2001, as Wikipedia&#x27;s first edition.

English Wikipedia is hosted alongside other language editions by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization. Its content, written independently of other editions by volunteer editors known as Wikipedians, is in various varieties of English while aiming to stay consistent within articles. Its internal newspaper is &quot;The Signpost&quot;.

English Wikipedia is the most-read version of Wikipedia, accounting for 48% of Wikipedia&#x27;s cumulative traffic, with the remaining percentage split among the other languages. The English Wikipedia has the most articles of any edition, at as of 2025. It contains of articles in all Wikipedias, although it lacks millions of articles found in other editions. The edition&#x27;s was made on 13 January 2021.

English Wikipedia, often as a stand-in for Wikipedia overall, has been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced degree of commercial bias. It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women and ideological bias. While its reliability was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise in the late 2010s and early 2020s, having become an important fact-checking site. English Wikipedia has been characterized as having less cultural bias than other language editions due to its broader editor base.

== Articles ==

The English Wikipedia surpassed six million articles on 23 January 2020. In November 2022, the total volume of the compressed texts of its articles amounted to 20 gigabytes.

The edition&#x27;s one-billionth edit was made on 13 January 2021 by Ser Amantio di Nicolao (Steven Pruitt) who as of that date is the user with the highest number of edits on the English Wikipedia, at over four million. Currently, there are articles created with files. The encyclopedia is home to of articles in all Wikipedias (down from more than 50% in 2003). The English Wikipedia currently has registered accounts of which are administrators.

== Bureaucracy ==
Editors of the English Wikipedia have pioneered some ideas as conventions, policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas include &quot;featured articles&quot;, the neutral-point-of-view policy, navigation templates, the sorting of short &quot;stub&quot; articles into sub-categories, dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration, and weekly collaborations.

== Wikipedians ==


The English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007, over a year since the millionth Wikipedian registered an account in February 2006.

Over 1,100,000 volunteer editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10 times. Over 30,000 editors perform more than 5 edits per month, and over 3,000 perform more than 100 edits per month.

On 1 March 2014, &quot;The Economist&quot;, in an article titled &quot;The Future of Wikipedia&quot;, cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that &quot;[t]he number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.&quot; The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by &quot;The Economist&quot; as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by &quot;sharp&quot; comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.

The trend analysis published in &quot;The Economist&quot; presents Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000.

The English Wikipedia has the Arbitration Committee (also known as ArbCom) that consists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings with regard to disputes between other editors of the online encyclopedia. It was created by Jimmy Wales on 4 December 2003 as an extension of the decision-making power he had formerly held as owner of the site. When it was founded, the committee consisted of 12 arbitrators divided into three groups of four members each.

In 2022, for English Wikipedia, Americans accounted for about 40% of active editors, followed by British and Indian editors accounting for about 10% of each, and Canadian and Australian at about 5%.

== Criticism ==
== Controversies ==
=== English varieties ===
A notable discussion within the English Wikipedia community concerns the preference for national variety of the English language, particularly American English and British English. Various suggestions have been made, ranging from standardizing a single form of English to creating separate versions of the English Wikipedia project. According to a style guideline, &quot;the English Wikipedia has no general preference for a major national variety of the language&quot; and &quot;an article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate variety of English for that nation.&quot;

=== Disputed articles ===
A 2013 study from Oxford University found that the most disputed articles on the English Wikipedia tend to address broader, global issues. In contrast, articles on other language Wikipedias often focus on regional issues. This pattern is attributed to the status of English as a global &quot;lingua franca&quot;, leading to contributions from many editors for whom English is a second language. The study identified the most disputed entries on the English Wikipedia as George W. Bush, anarchism, Muhammad, list of WWE personnel, global warming, circumcision, United States, Jesus, race and intelligence, and Christianity.

2024 research determined that several groups of connected accounts had coordinated to promote Russian propaganda narratives and state-controlled media sources in articles, related to Russian-Ukrainian relations and Russia&#x27;s war with Ukraine.

=== Threats against high schools ===
There have been reports of threats of violence against high schools made on Wikipedia. For instance, in 2008, Glen A. Wilson High School was the subject of such a threat. Additionally, in 2006, a 14-year-old was arrested for making a threat against Niles West High School on Wikipedia.

== WikiProjects and assessment ==
A &quot;WikiProject&quot; is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve Wikipedia. These groups may focus on a specific topic area (for example, women&#x27;s history), a specific location or a specific kind of task (for example, checking newly created pages). As of August 2022, the English Wikipedia had over 2,000 WikiProjects, for which activity varied.

In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English Wikipedia introduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles. Articles are rated by WikiProjects. The range of quality classes begins with &quot;Stub&quot; (very short pages), followed by &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;B&quot; (in increasing order of quality). Community peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the quality classes: either &quot;&quot;, &quot;A&quot; or the highest, &quot;&quot;. Of the about 6.5 million articles and lists assessed as of April 2022, more than 6,000 (0.09%) are featured articles, and fewer than 4,000 (0.06%) are featured lists. One featured article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the main page of Wikipedia.

The has developed a table (shown below) that displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance, on the English Wikipedia. If an article or list receives different ratings by two or more WikiProjects, then the highest rating is used in the table, pie-charts, and bar-chart. The software auto-updates the data.

Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive work of a few editors. A 2010 study found unevenness in quality among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffective in assessing the quality of articles.


== Internal news publications ==

Community-produced news publications include &quot;The Signpost&quot;. Other community news publications include the &quot;WikiWorld&quot; web comic, the podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like from and the monthly newsletter from . There are a number of publications from the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the and &quot;This Month in Education&quot;.

<doc id="328162" wikidata="Q265555" url="?curid=328162" title="Kitami">
<text>is a city in Okhotsk Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan. It is the most populous city and the commercial center in the subprefecture, although the subprefecture capital is Abashiri.

Kitami is physically in the middle of Okhotsk Subprefecture. The Kitami Mountains are nearby and are the main reason behind the city&#x27;s name. The city is the result of the merger of Kitami, Tanno, Tokoro and Rubeshibe towns in 2006 administrative reform. Kitami developed mainly in commerce and industry/service industries, Tanno in agriculture, Tokoro in fishery and agriculture, and Rubeshibe in forestry and tourism on hot springs.

Due to the characteristics of the region, Kitami has the highest onion and white flower bean production in Japan. Scallop fishing also flourishes, which makes it the &quot;birthplace of scallop farming&quot; in the country. In addition, the region is home to historical and tourist places like the Pearson Museum, Wakka Wild Flower Garden, and Tokoro Ruins, which are listed as &quot;Hokkaido Heritage&quot; sites.

As of July 31, 2023, the city had a population of 112,185, citizens in 61,793 households. The population density is . The total area is .

== Etymology ==
The name came as a suggestion of the Japanese explorer and cartographer Matsuura Takeshirō during the Meiji Era, when imperial bureaucrats were registering the place for initiating the region&#x27;s development through the Hokkaidō Development Commission. Before the imperial intervention, there was no Ainu name for the region.

The meaning of the name consists of the kanji&#x27;s combinations of characters 北 (North) 見 (See) and 市 (City), which means &quot;City of the North View&quot;. The reason behind this meaning is due to the region&#x27;s mountains, which allow the view of the sea and the Russian island of Sakhalin.

Originally, the name refers to a vast area between the mountains and the Sea of Okhotsk. Since the merger of Kitami City with the surrounding Tokoro, Rubeshibe and Tanno towns in 2006, it is often referred to as the area around the Kitami Basin, the so-called Kitami Inland Area, excluding the former Tokoro Town area in the coastal area.

==Chronology==
=== The Edo period ===
The Edo period is the period between 1603 and 1867 in the history of Japan, when Japan was under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate and the country&#x27;s 300 regional &quot;daimyo&quot;. During this period, there is no registration of continuous human settlement in this place. The nearest populations were composed of Ainu Tribes. Nowadays, one of their old settlements has become the Tokoro Ruins. The history began to appear in the final years of the Edo period, as a result of the Meiji Restoration and the Boshin War.

* 1856: Japanese explorer Matsuura Takeshirō passed over the region for the first time on the Tokoro River.

=== Meiji Era ===
The Meiji era is an era of Japanese history that extended from October 23, 1868, to July 30, 1912. In this period, the Boshin War was over and the short-lived Ezo Republic was conquered by the Japanese Imperial Army. Due to the risk of having new revolts in the border of the empire and the constant expansion of the Russian Empire at the north, the imperial bureau started the mass colonisation of the region and the &quot;Japanization&quot; of the natives through forced assimilation and segregation.

* 1869 (Meiji 2): The Meiji government renames Ezo as &quot;Hokkaido&quot; and creates the Hokkaidō Development Commission.
* 1872 (Meiji 5): The village of is founded, starting the process of settle in the region.
* 1882 (Meiji 15): Hokkaidō Development Commission is abolished, and the first three prefectures are established in Hokkaido. This area belonged to Nemuro prefecture, one of those firstly created.
* 1897 (Meiji 30): 112 immigrants arrives and settle, which led to the substantial growth of the region.
* 1899 (Meiji 32): Is produced the first mint in the region.
* 1904 (Meiji 37): Rice cultivation begins.
* 1910 (Meiji 43): Train service arrives (then called the Ikeda Railway Line), connecting the village to Sapporo, capital of Hokkaido.

=== Taishō Era ===
Taishō is a period dating from 30 July 1912 to 25 December 1926, coinciding with the reign of the Emperor Taishō. During this Era, the emperor wasn&#x27;t capable of using his power due to cerebral meningitis contracted in his childhood. Because of his personal limitations, the imperial government was led informally by an oligarchy of notables called Genrō (元老). Thanks to this power vacuum, Japan developed a political system that allowed a liberal government, with the creation of political parties and a major role of the National Diet.

* 1914 (Taisho 3): Pearson Museum is opened in the old house of the Pearsons, an American missionary couple.
* 1915 (Taisho 4): Tokoro Village is created.
* 1921 (Taisho 10): Rubeshibe Town is created.

=== Showa Era ===
This chapter of Japanese history corresponds to the reign of Emperor Shōwa (Hirohito) from December 25, 1926, until his death on January 7, 1989. This time represents the most intense changes in Kitami, Hokkaido, and Japan. In the beginning, the city started to specialise in the production of Mint, meanwhile, the Empire of Japan was under a militaristic rule with expansionist actions that led to the participation of the country in the Second World War.

After the end of the conflict, Japan started to concentrate its economic efforts on mass industrialisation, which, in consequence, led Japan to the second most important economy in the world. Kitami had an industrial development during this progress and the city reached its highest population in the middle of the 80s.

* 1928 (Showa 3): Mr. and Mrs. Pearson leave Kitami and come back to the United States.
* 1934 (Showa 9): The Japanese Red Cross hospital is completed.
* 1934 (Showa 9): Kitami&#x27;s Mint Memorial Hall is opened.
* 1939 (Showa 14): Kitami&#x27;s mint production gets 70% of the world market and reaches its peak.
* 1942 (Showa 17): Kitami becomes a city.
* 1947 (Showa 22): 50th anniversary of the creation of Kitami City. Enactment of the Kitami City coat of arms.
* 1954 (Showa 29): &quot;Kitami Commerce and Industry Festival&quot; is held for the first time
* 1960 (Showa 35): Establishment of the Kitami College of Technology.
* 1971 (Showa 46): &quot;Kitami Winter Festival&quot; held for the first time.

== Towns and autonomous regions ==
Kitami is the result of the administrative unification of small towns with the main city, which was made in 2006. Thanks to this merging, Kitami is the biggest city in the Okhotsk Subprefecture. These small towns still exist as &quot;Autonomous Region Districts&quot; (自治区). There are four autonomous regions/towns in total.

=== City of Kitami ===
Translated as &quot;North View&quot; (北見), it is the main urban area of the region. The city flourished during the prewar era through the production of mint, which at the time accounted for 70% of world production. Nowadays Kitami is the commercial, industrial, and service center of the Okhotsk area. The government makes efforts to develop the city through an industry-academia-government collaboration involving universities and other higher education institutions that are also based in the area.

=== Town of Tanno ===
Translated as &quot;Edge Field&quot; (端野) which is based in the native Ainu name &quot;nufu-un-keshi&quot; (&quot;edge of the field&quot;), the district is mainly a farm field with smooth hills and a rural landscape in the Tokoro river basin. The district has an educational zone with elementary and junior high schools, social education facilities, and parks in the main centre of the district. The rural landscape is also shaped by farms with urban convenience. In the last population survey (2005) the town had an estimated population of 5,425 and a density of 33 persons per km2. The total area was 163.50 km2.

=== Town of Tokoro ===
Agriculture and fisheries thrive in this district with abundant nature, including Wakka Wild Flower Park, where flowers stand out on the sandbar between the Sea of Okhotsk and Lake Saroma. It has a year-round curling hall, which is one of the largest of its kind in Japan, as well as historical sites such as the Tokoro Site and the birthplace of scallop cultivation. As of 2004, the town had an estimated population of 4,885 and a density of 17.55 persons per km2. The total area was 278.29 km2.

=== Town of Rubeshibe ===
Translated as &quot;Legacy of the Detained Pistils&quot; (留辺蘂), the district is surrounded by thick forests at the foot of the Taisetsu mountains and along the Muka River. Its key industries are White Flower (shirohana-mame) beans production, for which it boasts the nation&#x27;s largest yield, and the forest products industry, which uses locally produced wood. As a tourist spot, Yama no Aquarium (Kita no Daichi no Aquarium) in the Onneyu Onsen resort is attracting nationwide attention with its unique display tanks. Before the unification with Kitami, the town had an estimated population of 8,704 and a density of 15.41 persons per km2. The total area was 564.69 km2.

==Economy==
=== History and actual situation ===
Kitami&#x27;s first economy was the natural production of &quot;Mentha&quot; (Mint). During at one time (pre-war) the region exported mint (known as &quot;hakka&quot; locally) in a scale that represented the supply of 70% of the world&#x27;s mint consumption at its peak. Nowadays it is the most important city of the Okhotsk region. Due to its size, Kitami is the main industrial and commercial pole of the region. The number of employees by industry is divided by 7.6% for the primary industry, 18.8% for the secondary industry, and 73.6% for the tertiary industry (2010). These economic proportions are comparable to major cities in Hokkaido but, in terms of primary industry, the percentage is higher when compared with other cities alike.

=== Agriculture ===
The extensive farmlands of the city are surrounded by grand nature stretches over 110 km east to west from the foot of the Taisetsu mountains to the Sea of Okhotsk coast. Abundant sunlight and fertile soil support the production of diverse produce, including rice, wheat/barley, potatoes, beet, beans and other upland crops, onions and other vegetables, as well as dairy products, beef, pork and other livestock products.Efforts are being made to produce diverse farm products by making the most of the climate and characteristics of each district. Clean agriculture harmonious with the natural environment is promoted by minimising the use of chemical fertilisers and synthetic pesticides to deliver safe, reliable and high-quality farm products to consumers.

; Onions

The total production of onions in FY 2019 was approximately 221,000 tons, accounting for roughly 25% of the total production of Hokkaido as well as being the largest yield in Japan. The total area of onion fields in the city is approximately 3,500 hectares. Farmers are busy transplanting seedlings in spring, and rows of large, plump onions fill vast fields in autumn.

* White Pea Beans

White Pea Beans are known as the “queen of beans”. These pure white, large-grained beans are used as an ingredient for the white bean paste in high-class Japanese confectionery. Kitami, which has a cool, inland climate, is ideal for cultivating white pea beans and is a major production area in Hokkaido. The large and tasty white pea beans produced in Kitami are distributed as high-grade beans throughout Japan.

=== Fishery ===
In Kitami, which faces the resource-rich Sea of Okhotsk and Lake Saroma, open-sea scallop and fixed-net salmon/trout fisheries are among the city&#x27;s key industries. Hairy crabs, sea urchin and flatfish are also caught, and sustainable fishery is promoted. Scallop and oyster farming and Hokkai shrimp fishing are popular on the lake. The Tokoro Fishing Port is being developed to provide safer and more reliable seafood. With an eye on the conservation of the fishing ground environment, fishing operators are actively engaged in tree planting activities to grow forests.

* Scallops

The lake Saroma is the birthplace of scallop farming. After many hardships, fishermen established propagation and culture technology to build the foundation of the Tokoro area as one of the world&#x27;s leading scallop producing areas. The scallops grown in Lake Saroma and the Sea of Okhotsk are plump and sweet, and have an exceptional texture. They are distributed all over the world as a luxury food item.

* Oysters and Hokkai shrimp

From mid-October to the end of March, oyster fishing is popular on Lake Saroma. The oysters, which are small yet have a rich flavor, are highly valued especially for eating raw. Hokkai shrimp, which is shipped only in July and August, is mainly boiled in salt. With a saltiness that pairs perfectly with sake, moderate elasticity, crispy texture, and sweetness that spreads in the mouth, it is known as a summer specialty of the Okhotsk area.

=== Industry ===
Efforts to revitalise the local economy include the &quot;cultivation&quot; of new sales channels and the development of new products with higher added value to overcome the problem of logistics costs. Product development is promoted via inter-industry collaboration and by attracting enterprises to the Kitami Industrial Complex and Kitami HighTech Park, both of which make the most of local resources. Kitami Institute of Technology&#x27;s Cooperative Research &amp; Community Collaboration Center serves as a contact point for joint research with the private sector. The Okhotsk Collaborative Research Center and the Kitami Office of the Hokkaido Branch of the Organization for Small &amp; Medium Enterprises and Regional Innovation have been established as “one-stop service bases” to support R&amp;D and commercialization in the local community. Measures to promote local industries, such as the enhancement of technological capabilities and the development of new products, are taken while strengthening industry-academia-government collaboration. There is important private enterprises installed in the city like Kyocera Corporation and Hitachi, Ltd.

=== Commerce ===
As the central city of the Okhotsk area, Kitami has expanded its retail trading zone in the last years. The commercial district in the downtown area, where retail, service and restaurant establishments are concentrated, has long been a place for interaction among citizens. Various events are held to make the commercial district more attractive. A new shopping zone formed in the suburbs has further livened up the commercial sector of Kitami. Lively and diverse commercial activities are promoted by making the most of local creativity while facilitating the participation of local residents in the development of a community. In financial matters, the annual sales of both wholesale and retail businesses in Kitami City are declining, and the number of business establishments and employees is also declining. This decline occur mainly due the Japanese economic crisis, faster ageing population and urban exodus. In the tourism industry, there are about 1.5 million tourists a year, mainly in Lake Saroma and Onneyu Onsen. However, the total number of overnight guests has been around 450,000 a year, making it a so-called “passing-type” tourist destination.

==Education==
Kitami is home to the Kitami Institute of Technology, an engineering university that originally opened in 1960, and the Japanese Red Cross Hokkaido College of Nursing, established in 1999 by the Japanese Red Cross through consolidation of several other institutions. The &quot;Kitami Central Library&quot; is the main library of the city. In December 2015, the library was relocated to a new building on the south side, making it easily accessible from the downtown area. The library has a collection of approximately 330,000 books and supports the learning of residents with a network of nine facilities in the city, which have 799,000 books in total. It provides an audiovisual area where DVDs and music can be enjoyed and a literature museum area that exhibits valuable materials of the poet Mokichi Saito. PCs and Wi-Fi can be used freely by residents and non-residents alike. New services such as e-books are also available.

==Sports==
===Curling===
The city has strong associations with the sport of curling, inherited from the former town of Tokoro, which was absorbed into the city in 2006. Interest in the sport grew following a friendship visit in 1980 by a curling team from Alberta in Canada. An outdoor curling rink was built in Tokoro the following year, and it hosted the 1st NHK Cup Curling Championship. In January 1988, the town built a dedicated 5-lane curling hall, the first in Japan. This eventually closed in early 2013, replaced by a new, larger, all-year-round structure.

Curling was introduced in schools in Tokoro as part of the physical education curriculum, and the two produced a number of Olympic curlers. Five members of the Japanese curling team at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano were from Tokoro, three members of the Japanese curling team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino were from Tokoro, and three members of the Japanese curling team at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver were from Tokoro.

As of 2008, the city has an estimated population of 40,333 and a density of 85.6 persons per km2 (222 persons per sq. mi.). The total area is .

== Etymology ==
There are various theories about the origin of the name &#x27;Abashiri&#x27; and, because of that, the origin is unknown. All of those theories are based on the Kanji interpretation of the Ainu language. These are the following theories.

* &quot;Apasiri&quot; (アパシリ) which is translated as &quot;leaking ground&quot;. The reason behind this is that there was a cave, and water drops were falling inside like raindrops.
* &quot;Cipasiri&quot; (チパシリ). The name is based on an Ainu legend of a bird.
* &quot;Chipasiri&quot; (チパシリ). There used to be a white rock in the shape of a person wearing a hat on the south bank of Lake Abashiri, and it is said that the Ainu worshiped it.

The origin of the city&#x27;s name is not known for certain, but it is agreed that it was derived from an Ainu word. A few among several of the candidates include &quot;apa-siri&quot; (leakage/ground) and &quot;ci-pa-sir&quot; (&quot;the land we discovered&quot;).
*March 1872: founded, being given the name of Abashiri District in Kitami Province.
*1875: The village name is rewritten in kanji .
*1902: Abashiri Village, Kitami Town, Isani Village, and Nikuribake Village, all in Abashiri District, merged to form Abashiri Town.
*1915: Notoro Village, Mokoto Village merged.
*1921: Memanbetsu Village (later Memanbetsu Town, merged into Ōzora in 2006) split.
*1931: Boundary with Memanbetsu Town modified.
*February 11, 1947: Higashimokoto Village (merged into Ōzora in 2006) split. Abashiri Town becomes Abashiri City. All of the territories of Ōzora used to be a part of Abashiri.

Following the 1945 Soviet invasion of South Sakhalin, Abashiri saw the resettlement of several Nivkh and Orok families from Karafuto; among them was Chiyo Nakamura (1906–1969), a Nivkh shaman from Poronaisk (). By 2004, the Nivkh-Orok community in Abashiri had apparently vanished.

==Geography==
Abashiri is located in the eastern part of Okhotsk Subprefecture, about 50 kilometers east of Kitami. There are no tall mountains, but there are many hills. The Abashiri River flows through the city and there are three lakes (Lake Abashiri, Lake Notoro and Lake Tōfutsu) in the city as well. These lakes and Mount Tento belong to Abashiri Quasi-National Park.

===Climate===
The climate is humid continental with warm summer (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) as much of Hokkaido, similar to the south coast of New England. Despite its reputation for extreme cold, Abashiri is not actually the coldest major town in Japan, being less cold in the winter than Obihiro and warmer in summer than Nemuro or Kushiro. Abashiri receives less precipitation than any other city in Japan because its location on the drift ice-affected Sea of Okhotsk, which, however, causes Abashiri to receive less sunshine than the northeast coast since winter snowfall is heavier and fog less confined to the summer months when the Oyashio Current is strongest. During the winter, when Lake Abashiri freezes over, fog becomes a common occurrence. Also, the harbor closes when it ices over.
==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Abashiri has declined in recent decades.
==Economy==
Because of its short 130-day growing season, the crops in the region, such as oats, potatoes, and beans, are required to be hardy. Hay is also grown for local cows, horses, and sheep. The sea is an important part of the community as well as the economy, as fishing, oysters, and seaweed are important means of livelihood.

==Sightseeing==
Monbetsu is famous for drift ice, a yearly phenomenon which reaches the city every January or February from the northern Sea of Okhotsk. As such, the city has taken on the drift ice as its symbol and has become a center for research on sea ice generally, with an international conference held in February (usually the time of peak sea ice) each year. There is also a yearly Drift Ice Festival that coincides with the Sapporo Snow Festival. The festival features impressive sculptures built out of drift ice along with a large ice maze. Additionally, the Okhotsk Tower is a facility where one can observe sea ice from both high above, and from below the ocean. It is complete with an information center and aquarium. An icebreaker, the Garinko II, departs from nearby and makes regular sightseeing cruises through the drift ice during the winter. Monbetsu is also home to the Okhotsk Sea Ice Museum of Hokkaido, which covers all aspects of sea ice and features a sub-zero room and &quot;frozen aquarium&quot; of various fish preserved in ice.

During the summertime, when the sea ice melts, sailors from Russia are a common sight in the city. Some local businesses have banned Russian visitors for their supposed &quot;unruly&quot; behavior, which has led some activists to criticize Monbetsu as a hotbed of racial discrimination.

He usually wears a happi coat with an iceberg motif, a belly band (which is his charm point as it helps him give extra warmth during the winter and extra coolness during the summer) and a scallop as a wig. As a seal, he can resist the extreme weather (both cold and hot). He sometimes wear salmon roes, crab claws and salmon as wigs. Despite his old age, he can go scuba diving. He lives in the Hokkaidoritsu Okhotsk Ryuhyo Park (which is also his workplace). He usually goes to festivals and the Port of Monbetsu. His hobbies are fishing, studying the sea and taking naps on drift ice (during the winter) and at the Okhotsk White Beach (during the summer).

<doc id="328165" wikidata="Q496667" url="?curid=328165" title="Muroran">
<text>is a city and port located in Iburi Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan. It is the capital city of Iburi Subprefecture. As of January 31, 2024, the city had an estimated population of 76,385, with 43,494 households and a population density of . The total area is .

== History ==
The origin of Muroran&#x27;s name is derived from the Ainu word &quot;Mo Ruerani&quot;, which means &quot;the bottom of a little slope&quot;. The little slope, in front of the former Senkai Temple in Sakimori-cho, is noted in connection with the name of Muroran.

In the late 16th century, the Muroran region came under the administration of the Matsumae clan. Muroran was developed as a trading post between the Ainu and the Matsumae clan people.

In 1892, the Port of Muroran was opened for the wooden bridge construction at Kaigan (former Tokikaramoi); at the same time, the main road began construction from Hakodate to Sapporo as the first step of Hokkaido Colonization Plan.

An Imperial decree in July 1899 established Muroran as an open port for trading with the United States and the United Kingdom.

With the opening of a ship route from Muroran to Mori and railroad extension to Iwamizawa, Muroran&#x27;s municipality was started on August 1, 1922 as the core of the major land and sea traffic in the pioneer era of Hokkaido. Since then, Muroran has been developing as an important transportation hub and a center of the steel industry. This unfortunately earned the town&#x27;s industrial plants a bombardment by some of the newest American battleships in July 1945, in the closing days of World War II. Muroran was also bombed by American naval aircraft on 14 and 15 July 1945, 525 people were killed.

Today, there are large cement factories, steel mills, oil refineries, and shipyards clustered around the port of Muroran.

==Climate==

Despite it being located on Hokkaido, Muroran typically does not see the very cold winters that the majority of the island is known for, yet it does experience some snowfall in the course of the year, averaging roughly of snow per season. Summers in Muroran are mild by Japanese standards, not nearly as hot as summers in other Japanese cities. Average high temperatures in August, the city&#x27;s warmest month, is around .

<doc id="328167" wikidata="Q2601849" url="?curid=328167" title="Darby Crash">
<text>Jan Paul Beahm (better known by his stage name Darby Crash, formerly Bobby Pyn; September 26, 1958 – December 7, 1980) was an American singer who, along with longtime friend Pat Smear (born Georg Albert Ruthenberg), co-founded the punk rock band the Germs and was best known as their lead vocalist. In 1980, he committed suicide by deliberately overdosing on heroin.

== Early life ==
Beahm had a troubled childhood. While still a baby, he and his family lived in Venice, Los Angeles. He grew up in Culver City, California, and later, West Los Angeles.

Beahm grew up believing that his biological father was a man named Harold &quot;Hal&quot; Beahm, who had left the family early on in his life. 

Beahm lived with his mother Faith Reynolds-Baker for much of his life, but their relationship was tumultuous. The accounts given of her in Brendan Mullen and Don Bolles&#x27; 2002 book &quot;Lexicon Devil: The Fast Times and Short Life of Darby Crash and the Germs&quot; portray her as having a mental illness, which caused her to behave erratically and be verbally abusive toward her son.

Reynolds-Baker&#x27;s third husband, Bob Baker, died suddenly of a heart attack at 39 in 1972; they had married in 1964 when a very young Beahm introduced the idea of them marrying after they began dating. She never married Beahm&#x27;s biological father, and not long after Bob Baker&#x27;s death, Beahm learned that his biological father, whom he never met, was also deceased. Bob Baker was a Korean War veteran.

Beahm attended Innovative Program School, an alternative school within University High School in Los Angeles, which Beahm dubbed &quot;Interplanetary School&quot;. The IPS program combined elements of &quot;est&quot; large group awareness training and Scientology. Beahm did not take the IPS program seriously. As students in the IPS program were given the liberty to form their own classes, Beahm and fellow student Georg Ruthenberg, better known as Pat Smear, created a class for themselves called Fruit Eating, in which they would go to a market, eat fruit for an hour, then return to school.

Frequent users of LSD at the time, Beahm and Ruthenberg developed a following of other IPS students who would also use the drug. The two were accused of brainwashing the other students and causing them to behave subversively, which led to the dismissal of Beahm and Ruthenberg from the school in 1976. 

According to his mother, Beahm later enrolled at Santa Monica College.

== The Germs ==

Not long after their dismissal from IPS, Beahm and Ruthenberg began trying to form a band, inspired by groups like The Runaways and The Stooges. Before they settled on the Germs as a band name, they called themselves &quot;Sophistifuck&quot; and the Revlon Spam Queens, but had to use a shorter name because they didn&#x27;t have enough money to put this on a t-shirt.

After putting out an ad requesting &quot;two untalented girls&quot; who couldn&#x27;t play their instruments, the two friends were joined by the suitably inexperienced bassist Teresa Marie Ryan, soon to be rechristened Lorna Doom, and drummer Belinda Carlisle, dubbed Dottie Danger, who never played a show with the group due to an extended bout of mononucleosis. Carlisle went on to fame and fortune as lead vocalist of The Go-Go&#x27;s and as an even more successful solo artist. She was quickly replaced with Becky Barton (aka Donna Rhia), who played three gigs with the group and recorded with them on their debut single, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Forming.&quot;

When the Germs initially formed, the only member who was proficient with an instrument was Ruthenberg, who now called himself Pat Smear. Beahm initially dubbed himself Bobby Pyn, as he is credited on the group&#x27;s first recording, but soon jettisoned the moniker in favor of the more overtly menacing Darby Crash, a name which he had initially referred to in the lyrics of the song &quot;Circle One.&quot;

The Germs were captured famously in Penelope Spheeris&#x27; 1981 film &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;. The film features a characteristically hectic and sloppy live show in which Crash, heavily intoxicated and under the influence of several drugs, calls to the audience for beer, stumbles and crawls on the stage and slurs lyrics while members of the audience write on him with permanent markers.

During an interview in the film, Crash also discusses taking drugs onstage to avoid feeling injuries from fan violence and &quot;creeps out there with grudges.&quot; The Germs were well known for their violent, chaotic performances, often exacerbated by Crash&#x27;s drug abuse, which increased steadily over the group&#x27;s brief lifespan.

All of this resulted in the band being banned from nearly every rock club in Los Angeles, which they nevertheless managed to avoid by playing under the alias G.I. (standing for &quot;Germs Incognito&quot;). By the point in which they were filmed for &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;, in late 1979, director Spheeris had to rent a soundstage called Cherrywood Studios in California in order for them to play a show outside of the club circuit from which they had been largely blacklisted.

== Final years and suicide ==
Plagued by Crash&#x27;s worsening heroin addiction, and live performances that now often ended prematurely due to violent conflict between audience members and the Los Angeles Police Department, the Germs disintegrated in May 1980, their last show being May 6 at the Fleetwood in Redondo Beach.

Crash traveled to Britain, where he became heavily enamored with the music of Adam and the Ants and adopted an Adam Ant–inspired new look that included a mohawk. Upon his return to the U.S., Crash formed the very short-lived Darby Crash Band; Circle Jerks drummer Lucky Lehrer joined the ill-fated ensemble on the eve of their first live performance after Crash kicked out the drummer they&#x27;d rehearsed with during soundcheck and convinced Pat Smear to act as the group&#x27;s guitarist. Smear described the band as &quot;like the Germs, but with worse players&quot;.

On December 3, 1980, an over-sold Starwood hosted a final live show of the reunited Germs, including drummer Don Bolles. Crash committed suicide from an intentional heroin overdose on December 7, 1980, in a house in the Fairfax District section of Los Angeles.

According to &quot;SPIN magazine&quot;, apocryphal lore has Crash attempting to write &quot;Here Lies Darby Crash&quot; on the wall as he lay dying, but not finishing. In reality, he wrote a short note to Darby Crash Band bassist David &quot;Bosco&quot; Danford that stated &quot;My life, my leather, my love goes to Bosco.&quot;

His death was largely overshadowed by that of John Lennon, who was killed in New York one day after Crash&#x27;s suicide. His female friend Casey Cola Hopkins was with him that night, at her mother&#x27;s main house. Casey was supposed to have died with him in the coach house (which was a converted garage) that night as part of a supposed death pact, but ended up surviving. Crash is interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City.

Since death, his mother received the Germs&#x27; album and merchandise royalties, thanks to Darby&#x27;s deal with Bug Records that was drafted a few months prior to his death.

== In popular culture ==
Crash and the Germs are the subject of the 2007 biopic &quot;What We Do Is Secret&quot;, which starred Shane West as Crash, Bijou Phillips as Lorna Doom, Rick Gonzalez as Pat Smear, and Noah Segan as Bolles.

American professional wrestler Darby Allin&#x27;s ring name is derived from Crash&#x27;s name as well as GG Allin&#x27;s name.

<text>Gaius Popillius Laenas ( 172–158 BC) was a politician and general of the Roman Republic. He was consul two times, once in 172 and once in 158 BC.

He was sent as an envoy to prevent a war between Antiochus IV Epiphanes of the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Egypt. On being confronted with the Roman demands that he abort his attack on Alexandria, Antiochus played for time; Popillius Laenas is supposed to have drawn a circle around the king in the sand with his cane, and ordered him not to move out of it until a firm answer had been given. The Syrians withdrew. According to Livy:

After receiving the submission of the inhabitants of Memphis and of the rest of the Egyptian people, some submitting voluntarily, others under threats, [Antiochus] marched by easy stages towards Alexandria. After crossing the river at Eleusis, about four miles from Alexandria, he was met by the Roman commissioners, to whom he gave a friendly greeting and held out his hand to Popilius. Popilius, however, placed in his hand the tablets on which was written the decree of the senate and told him first of all to read it. After reading it through, he said he would call his friends into council and consider what he ought to do. Popilius, stern and imperious as ever, drew a circle round the king with the stick he was carrying and said, &quot;Before you step out of that circle give me a reply to lay before the senate.&quot; For a few moments he hesitated, astounded at such a peremptory order, and at last replied, &quot;I will do what the senate thinks right.&quot; Not till then did Popilius extend his hand to the king as to a friend and ally. Antiochus evacuated Egypt at the appointed date, and the commissioners exerted their authority to establish a lasting concord between the brothers, as they had as yet hardly made peace with each other. &quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot;, xlv.12.

Polybius, the Greek historian of the Hellenistic Period, added more nuanced detail in his major work, &quot;The Histories&quot;, which covered the period of 264–146 BC in detail:

At the time when Antiochus approached Ptolemy and meant to occupy Pelusium, Caius Popilius Laenas, the Roman commander, on Antiochus greeting him from a distance and then holding out his hand, handed to the king, as he had it by him, the copy of the senatus-consultum, and told him to read it first, not thinking it proper, as it seems to me, to make the conventional sign of friendship before he knew if the intentions of him who was greeting him were friendly or hostile. But when the king, after reading it, said he would like to communicate with his friends about this intelligence, Popilius acted in a manner which was thought to be offensive and exceedingly arrogant. He was carrying a stick cut from a vine, and with this he drew a circle round Antiochus and told him he must remain inside this circle until he gave his decision about the contents of the letter. The king was astonished at this authoritative proceeding, but, after a few moments&#x27; hesitation, said he would do all that the Romans demanded. Upon this Popilius and his suite all grasped him by the hand and greeted him warmly. The letter ordered him to put an end at once to the war with Ptolemy. So, as a fixed number of days were allowed to him, he led his army back to Syria, deeply hurt and complaining indeed, but yielding to circumstances for the present. Popilius after arranging matters in Alexandria and exhorting the two kings there to act in common, ordering them also to send Polyaratus to Rome, sailed for Cyprus, wishing to lose no time in expelling the Syrian troops that were in the island. When they arrived, finding that Ptolemy&#x27;s generals had been defeated and that the affairs of Cyprus were generally in a topsy-turvy state, they soon made the Syrian army retire from the country, and waited until the troops took ship for Syria. In this way the Romans saved the kingdom of Ptolemy, which had almost been crushed out of existence: Fortune having so directed the matter of Perseus and Macedonia that when the position of Alexandria and the whole of Egypt was almost desperate, all was again set right simply because the fate of Perseus had been decided. For had this not been so, and had not Antiochus been certain of it, he would never, I think, have obeyed the Roman behests. Polybius, &quot;The Histories&quot;, Fragments of Book XXIX, published in Vol. VI of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1922-1927. 

Popillius Laenas&#x27; fleet is the one referred to in Daniel 11: &quot;For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be disheartened and will return,&quot; ().(Goldingay, p.301)

<doc id="328170" wikidata="Q693178" url="?curid=328170" title="Date, Hokkaido">
<text>is a city in Iburi Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan. Date was established around 1869, and became a city on April 1, 1972.

==History==
Remains of settlements from the Jōmon period have been found in the Date area. The Ainu, the native inhabitants of Hokkaido, also maintained a settlement at another location nearby until the beginning of the 20th century, when the Ainu were mostly assimilated into Japanese society.

The name of the area comes from the Date clan, who rose to power in the 12th century in Fukushima, on the mainland. Before the Edo period, their home castle was the Yanagawa castle in Date District, Fukushima. Later, it became the Sendai castle. The Date clan ruled the whole of Miyagi Prefecture as well as the southern part of Iwate Prefecture, and was one of the most influential &quot;daimyōs&quot;.

During the Meiji period, many samurai, including the Date clan, lost their territories due to the political changes of the Meiji Restoration. In 1869, a branch family of the Date clan from Watari-Date moved to and settled at the south coast of the then-uncultivated Hokkaido. This was the foundation of Date.

On March 1, 2006, the village of Ōtaki, from Usu District, was merged into Date.

==Geography==

Date is home to Mount Usu () and the Osaru River.

As a result of city and village merges, Date can essentially be divided into two sections: the Otaki Forest area and the Date Historic City area. Otaki Forest is home to Sankaidaki Falls and the Shirakinu River Bed. Date Historic City contains buildings that were built by the samurai, the most famous of which is the Usu-Zenkou temple.

The next most populous municipality in Tokachi is the adjacent town of Otofuke, with less than a third of Obihiro&#x27;s population. The city had approximately 500 foreign residents in 2008. The city contains the headquarters of the Fifth Division of the Northern Army of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force. It also hosts the Rally Japan World Rally Championship-event.

In 2008, Obihiro was designated a &quot;model environmental city&quot; in Japan.

==Industry==

Obihiro, along with most of Tokachi, has a large agricultural sector that revolves around large scale farming operations. Farms within the boundaries of Obihiro have an average of approximately 24 hectares of arable land; exceeding the Hokkaido average (17.41 ha) and the national average (1.57 ha). The main crops produced are wheat, potatoes, beets, and beans, but there has also been progress in the production of &quot;nagaimo&quot; (&quot;Dioscorea polystachya&quot;) and &quot;gobō&quot; (&quot;Arctium lappa&quot;); two of Tokachi&#x27;s specialty products. The headquarters of 3 nationally renowned pastry companies (Rokkatei, Ryugetsu, and Cranberry) are also located in Obihiro.

==Education==
Obihiro has 26 public elementary schools and 14 public middle schools. It also has five prefectural high schools, two private high schools, and one municipal high school. The Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine is the only university in Tokachi.

==Environment==

===Rivers===
Obihiro has one of Japan&#x27;s most pristine rivers flowing through its city limits. Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has chosen Obihiro&#x27;s Satsunai River, which joins the Tokachi River outside of town, as the cleanest Class A river in Japan seven times since 1991. It is designated as a Class A River by the Japanese government due to its importance to environmental conservation and the national economy. In the Ainu language, Satnay means &quot;dry river&quot;, and even today, most of its run is shallow. The city draws most of its drinking water from the Satsunai. The biggest pollutant in the river is nitrates from fertilizer run off from all the farming operations along the river&#x27;s banks. The other major river in the city is the Tokachi, but its water is not used for drinking as it has much higher pollution levels.

===Forests===
In 1974, a plan for the creation of an expansive city recreation space was initiated, and from 1975 to 2004 large groups of Obihiro citizens participated in &quot;Tree Planting Festivals&quot; (). These actions have resulted in the creation of a new forest; the &quot;Obihiro no Mori&quot; (). Recently, tree planting in the forest has been limited to small projects due to a lack of space to plant more trees.

===Climate===
Obihiro has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summers and cold winters, very similar with the coast of New England (although the lower averages are with more extreme records). Precipitation falls throughout the year, but is higher in late summer and early Fall.


==Culture==

===Ban&#x27;ei horse racing===
Obihiro is famous for the unique style of horse racing that takes place at the city&#x27;s horse racetrack. Hokkaido farmers in the 1900s had tug-of-war contests between their work horses to judge their strength and value. This gradually became a more formalized event and eventually became the racing we know today as Ban&#x27;ei horse racing. Rather than an oblong track, which most people think of when talking about horse racing, Obihiro&#x27;s ban&#x27;ei track is a straight 200 m run with two hills. Large and powerful draft horses pull sleds that can weigh more than a ton while their rider whips them hard to make them go faster. The track and facilities were renovated in 2007 due to major efforts by the city government to increase the popularity of the races. One unique aspect of the track is that spectators can walk alongside the track as the horses struggle towards the finish line. Starting in 2006, the City of Obihiro has poured money into reviving this sport and considers it a part of the city&#x27;s traditional culture.

===Major festivals===
Obihiro has three major festivals: the Flat Plain Festival, the Chrysanthemum Festival, and the Ice Festival.
::Passing its 60th year in 2007, this festival spans 3 days in mid August during Obihiro&#x27;s O-bon holiday season. The festival takes place on the downtown streets of Obihiro and includes a taiko drum performance that spans multiple city blocks with teams from all over Hokkaido, an energetic night-time parade called which expresses hopes for a good harvest, and a 2 hour long O-bon dance that includes an open section for anyone to jump in and dance along with all the other groups who are competing for first prize.
::Held every year around the end of October, this 6 day festival celebrates an important flower in the Japanese culture. This festival features thousands of chrysanthemums on display in . In 2007, the festival were held from October 30 to November 4.
::The cold weather and ice-caked roads of Obihiro can make it hard for people to go out and have fun in the winter, but this festival provides the residents of Obihiro and all of Tokachi to get out and enjoy the white snow of the season. There are fireworks and foodstands, and a pathway lined with various snow and ice sculptures. Some of the sculptures are of funny characters such as Anpanman, but other sculptures can depict fantastic mythical figures.

===Kita no Yatai===
The is an alleyway of unique foodstands that is open all year-round, and offers foods from many different countries.

===Food===

Obihiro is famous for pork meat glazed in a special sauce on rice, which is called &quot;butadon&quot; and mutton, which is called &quot;jingisukan&quot;, named after Genghis Khan. It is also famous for potatoes and dairy products, which are common produce in Tokachi. Obihiro also claims to be the origin of a dish called &quot;chuuka chirashi&quot;. It is also known for its high quality turnips. Wild game, including venison and bear meat, is also eaten in Obihiro.

==Sightseeing==
* Kōfuku Station, a closed station which remains a popular sightseeing attraction due its name meaning &quot;happiness&quot;.

==Major city facilities==

===Tokachi International Relations Center===
The was opened in 1996. It was created to facilitate international studies and events, academic study, and general interaction between people of different cultures and backgrounds. The establishment of the TIRC influenced the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in its decision to build the adjacent JICA Obihiro facility. Many events are now coordinated between the various organizations represented in buildings.

The TIRC offers a library room, an all-purpose gymnasium, kitchen facilities, and a large indoor &quot;winter garden&quot; of indoor flora. Two major events held here each year are the &quot;Friends of the World Cookout&quot;, where over 2,000 people gather to cook and eat international food, and the &quot;Mori no Halloween&quot; party where over 1,000 costumed parents and children celebrate a holiday that is not native to Japan.

===JICA Obihiro International Centre===

JICA Obihiro (Japan International Cooperation Agency/Obihiro International Centre) was established in April 1996 as a center for international cooperation activities in eastern Hokkaido. JICA carries out a variety of programmes in connection with technical cooperation with developing countries. In all, there are three organizations housed in the International Centre; Japan International Cooperation Agency, Japan International Cooperation Center, and the Northern Regions Center.

===Obihiro Zoo===
 opened in 1963. Construction of a new monkey facility was completed in June 2008. It cost approximately 266 million yen (US$2.66 million)

===Obihiro Library===
The new Obihiro public library was opened in 2006, and currently has over 300 English language books available.

===Indoor ice-skating rink===

An Olympic sized indoor speed skating rink, Meiji Hokkaido-Tokachi Oval, has been completed on the west side of Obihiro. Its construction was controversial due to its large price tag. The tentative budget for the project was the equivalent of US$30 million.
It was the site for the Essent ISU World Sprint Speed Skating Championships 2010.

==Events==
Parts of the 2017 Asian Winter Games are hosted in Obihiro.

==Mascot==

Obihiro&#x27;s mascot is , who is a wooden horse that resembled a birch tree. However, unlike horses, its gender is unknown. It likes to farm on sunny days. As result, it is skilled at anything related to agriculture. It was unveiled on 25 January 2021.

==Sister cities==
Obihiro has three international sister-cities:
* Seward, Alaska, United States - (1968)

While on a business trip in Alaska, a (former) teacher at Obihiro&#x27;s Agricultural High School, Yasuhiko Ohzono, was asked by the mayor of Seward to create some sort of cultural exchange between the two cities.
On March 21, 1967, the mayor of Obihiro sent a picture album and other materials to introduce the city to the mayor of Seward. The mayor of Seward sent a message, a coat of arms, and a medal; all of which were personally delivered by a member of the entourage of the U.S.-Japan Fishing Industry Negotiation Team in Japan at the time.
Obihiro sends the Mayor of Seward a wooden carving of a bear. On January 31, 1968, the resolution made by the Seward City Council arrives. The City of Obihiro also created a resolution on March 27, 1968, the sister city agreement was signed by both sides, and exchange between the two cities began. Since the Obihiro Economic Observation Group visited Seward in September, 1971, there have been various exchanges between Seward and Obihiro. Both mayors and many citizens of both cities have participated in exchanges, and the high school student exchange program has been put on every year since the summer of 1973.
* Chaoyang, Liaoning, China - (2000)

Interaction between the two cities began with Chaoyang&#x27;s Economic Observation Group Visit to Obihiro on May 30, 1985. In September that same year, Obihiro sent the 15 member Northeast China Friendship and Observation Group to Chaoyang.
Since then various groups have made exchange visits, agricultural trainees have been received, and there has even been exchanges of craft projects between elementary students. Since 1987, administrative and agricultural trainees have made 13 visits. In addition, JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) has been sending agricultural specialists to Chaoyang.
At the end of October in 1999, the mayor of Obihiro at the time, Toshifumi Sunagawa, lead the Official Friendship Visit Group to Chaoyang, and he exchanged memos regarding the signing of a Friendship City Agreement.
On November 17, 2000, the mayor of Chaoyang at the time, Daicao Wang, lead a delegation to Obihiro where a Friendship City Agreement was signed with the purpose of deepening interaction between the two cities across a wide range of fields, and to promote further friendship and peace between the two cities; not to mention China and Japan.
The two cities have run a high school student exchange program since 2002.
* Madison, Wisconsin, United States - (2006)

Obihiro became sister cities with Madison in October 2006. The two cities have almost the same latitude, and have similar climates. The content of the sister-city relationship has been mainly various visits to Madison regarding the field of mental health, but since the official start of the relationship there have been various fact-finding missions to and from Madison. There was even a short visit to Obihiro by two Madison area students, in August 2007. Obihiro hopes to learn more about Madison agriculture, mental health systems and facilities, and about how the University of Wisconsin–Madison runs various programs and organizations that have helped make it the university it is today. For example, the Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine has shown interest in marketing ice cream and other dairy products as the Babcock Dairy does at UW–Madison.

<doc id="328174" wikidata="Q271917" url="?curid=328174" title="Kushiro">
<text>is a city in Kushiro Subprefecture on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. Located along the coast of the North Pacific Ocean, it serves as the subprefecture&#x27;s capital and it is the most populated city in the eastern part of the island.

==History==
An Imperial decree in July 1899 established Kushiro as an open port for trading with the United States and the United Kingdom.

Kushiro had been an important port because it is more reliably ice-free during winter than alternative Russian Far East warm-water ports such as Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky or other ports in Hokkaido such as Hakodate, which occasionally freeze for short periods due to the lower salinity of the Sea of Japan. For this reason, Kushiro was considered a valuable target for the Tsars during the Russo-Japanese Wars. Its importance grew during the 1920s with the growth of commercial fishing, for which its reliable freedom from ice reduced costs.

In addition to its port, Kushiro is serviced by Kushiro Airport with flights from Honshu and by the &quot;Ōzora&quot; limited express train service, which runs six times per day to the main population centres in the west of Hokkaido.

In July 1945 the city of Kushiro was bombed by American naval aircraft; hundreds of people, mostly civilians, were killed. Following the Invasion of the Kuril Islands in August 1945, Kushiro was favoured by the Russians as the eastern cornerstone of a border between an American-occupied south and a Soviet-occupied north-coupled with Rumoi as the western cornerstone. However, these plans were cancelled after pressure by US President Harry S. Truman.

On October 11, 2005, the town of Akan, from Akan District, and the town of Onbetsu, from Shiranuka District, was merged into Kushiro. The town of Shiranuka now lies between the two sections of Kushiro.

In 2008, the city had an estimated population of 189,539 and a total area of , giving a population density of 140 persons per km2 (363 persons per sq. mi.).

Kushiro was one of the many Japanese cities to receive a Peace Pagoda. Built by the monks and nuns of the Buddhist order Nipponzan Myohoji, it was inaugurated in 1959.

Kushiro was accorded city status on August 1, 1922.
It is the sister city of Burnaby, British Columbia; Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia; and Kholmsk, Russia.
*1869: Kusuri becomes Kushiro.
*1900: Kushiro becomes a First Class Municipality as Kushiro Town.
*1920: Kushiro Town becomes Kushiro-&quot;ku&quot;. Kushiro Village (now Town) splits off.
*1922: Kushiro-&quot;ku&quot; becomes Kushiro City.
*1949: Tottori-cho was merged into Kushiro City.
*2005: The old city of Kushiro City, Akan Town, and Onbetsu Town merged was expanded city of Kushiro City.

===Climate===
Kushiro has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) but its winter temperatures are less severe than those of inland East Asia at the same latitude. Its port is the most reliably ice-free throughout winter in all of Hokkaido, due to the lack of indentation in the coastline and absence of large inflows of cold fresh water nearby. It is also markedly sunnier than the extremely gloomy Kuril Islands to its north, being sheltered by Hokkaido&#x27;s mountains from the heavy snowfalls produced on the Sea of Japan side by the Aleutian Low. It receives only a third as much snowfall as Sapporo and almost twice as much sunshine as the Kuril Islands are estimated to. Its daytime summer temperatures are noticeably cooler than in the interior, sheltered coastal areas and the south coast of Hokkaido.

<doc id="328176" wikidata="Q502205" url="?curid=328176" title="Nemuro, Hokkaido">
<text>is a city and port located in Nemuro Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan. It is the capital city of Nemuro Subprefecture. Much of the city lies on the Nemuro Peninsula. As of February 29, 2012, the city has an estimated population of 29,087, with 12,966 households, and a population density of 56.74 persons per km2 (147.0 persons per sq. mi.). The total area is .

==History==
Nemuro was developed by fisheries. In the early Meiji period, it was the largest city in eastern Hokkaido.
*1900 Nemuro town was founded.
*1906 Wada village was founded.
*1945 Bombed by American naval aircraft, 393 people were killed.
*1915 Habomai village was founded.
*1957 Nemuro town and Wada village was merged to form Nemuro city.
*1959 Habomai village was merged into Nemuro city.

==Climate==
Nemuro, like most of Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;), but not far from a marine climate (Koppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) using the isotherm due to its low amplitude for a location close to mainland Asia and average temperatures during the winter. It has mild to warm summers and cold snowy winters. Like the more northerly Kuril Islands, it has an extremely strong seasonal lag, with the highest temperatures in August and September and lowest in February, though it is not so gloomy as extremely foggy North Pacific islands like Simushir or the Aleutian Islands in general. Its peninsular location makes Nemuro very windy, especially during autumn and winter, with mean wind speeds as high as in November.

==Cuisine==
One local specialty of Nemuro is &quot;escalope&quot;. This consists of &quot;tonkatsu&quot; (breaded deep-fried pork cutlets) over butter fried rice with a special demiglace sauce.

Nemuro is well known by the people of Hokkaido as one of the best places to eat sushi because of the seafood caught there. Nemuro is also the origin of two sushi restaurants in Hokkaido: Matsuriya and Hanamaru. Nemuro&#x27;s seafood delicacies include their fresh Pacific saury, salmon, king crab, and shrimp.

Other delicacies in Nemuro include yakitori bento, Holland sanbei (waffle-like snack), soft serve ice cream, and monjayaki.

== Economy ==
Nemuro&#x27;s economy is based on its fishing industry as many types of marine animals are found in the area all year long. Dairy processing is also an important part of the local economy. Local businesses like restaurants and tourism also plays a significant role in the economy. Nemuro boasts the largest catches of saury in all of Japan, which has led to efforts to export saury to Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam.

<text>The Dallas Desperados were a professional arena football team based in Dallas, Texas. They played in the Eastern Division of the Arena Football League from to .

The franchise began as an expansion team and posted a winning record in all but one season. It was owned by Jerry Jones, who also owns the Dallas Cowboys. His son-in-law Shy Anderson was the chief operating officer and oversaw the day-to-day operations.

The team folded effective August 4, 2009, upon the dissolution of the original AFL. Unlike former owners of most defunct AFL teams, Jones maintains the intellectual property rights to the Desperados.

==History==
During a halftime interview at a Cowboys preseason game on August 12, 2000, Jerry Jones revealed to Babe Laufenberg that the AFL had granted him an expansion franchise to begin play in 2001. On November 14, 2001, Dallas officially joined the AFL. The team was originally going to be named the &quot;Dallas Texans&quot;, following in the footsteps of Dallas&#x27; former AFL franchise which existed from 1990 to 1993, when he sold the rights to the name &quot;Texans&quot; for $10 million to the new Houston franchise. After a contest in which fans voted via the team&#x27;s official website, the new Dallas team was eventually named the Desperados. Jones appointed Cowboys special teams coach Joe Avezzano as head coach, and on November 21, 2001, in the AFL expansion draft, they acquired their first player, lineman Aaron Hamilton.
Avezzano, along with starting quarterback Andy Kelly, led the team to a respectable 7–7 record and a playoff appearance in the team&#x27;s first season of play, and a 10–6 record and a second consecutive playoff berth in 2003 under new quarterback Jim Kubiak. He was fired from the Cowboys staff that season, then resigned as Desperados head coach when he accepted a job with the Oakland Raiders.

Before the 2004 season, Jones hired Will McClay to replace Avezzano, and McClay struggled to a 6–10 record his rookie season as coach. The team improved to 8–7–1 the following season and barely missed making the playoffs, and under the helm of quarterback/offensive coordinator Clint Dolezel, posted a 13–3 record in 2006 and made their first appearance in an AFL conference championship game, losing to the Orlando Predators. The following season saw the Desperados post an AFL record fifteen wins and the team appeared destined to make their first ArenaBowl appearance, but they were shocked by the Columbus Destroyers, who had entered the playoffs with a 7–9 record, in the first round. The upset is ranked by many among the greatest of all time. The following season saw no relief to the postseason failure as the Desperados at 12–4 lost to the 8–8 New York Dragons in Dallas. After the New Orleans VooDoo folded, the league placed the Desperados in the South Division after the team had spent five seasons as an Eastern Division powerhouse.

With the exception of one playoff game and the entirety of the 2003 season, the Desperados played all of their home games at American Airlines Center. The team&#x27;s official mascot was Kid Coyote.

===Memorable moments===
On June 9, 2007, the Desperados faced the 4–9 New Orleans VooDoo. The 13–1 Desperados found themselves losing late in the game. But Dallas Quarterback Clint Dolezel threw a touchdown with 30 seconds left on the clock to give the Desperados the lead. On the ensuing kickoff, the VooDoo fielded the ball off the net and found themselves looking at a long way to the endzone from their own one-yard line. They managed to put together a lengthy drive and were able to score with 1.7 seconds left to make the score 80–79. Rather than tie the game with an extra point, they elected to go for the win with a two-point conversion. VooDoo Quarterback Steve Bellisari dropped back and was sacked by 2007 AFL lineman of the year Colston Weatherington on the ten. The game was over along with the VooDoo playoff hopes. In the end, Dallas won 80–79.

The game was voted 2007 &quot;Game of the Year&quot; leaguewide in July 2007.

<text>is a city located in western Aomori Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 163,639 in 71,044 households, and a population density of . The total area of the city is .

Hirosaki developed as a castle town for the 100,000 &quot;koku&quot; Hirosaki Domain ruled by the Tsugaru clan. The city is currently a regional commercial center, and the largest producer of apples in Japan. The city government has been promoting the slogans &quot;Apple Colored Town Hirosaki&quot; and &quot;Castle and Cherry Blossom and Apple Town&quot; to promote the city image. The town is also noted for many western-style buildings dating from the Meiji period.

==Geography==
Hirosaki is located in western Aomori Prefecture, at the southern end of the Tsugaru plains of the Tsugaru Peninsula, southeast of Mount Iwaki and bordering on Akita Prefecture. The eastern and southern flanks of Mount Iwaki and its peak are within the city&#x27;s borders. The Iwaki River flows from the west to the northeast through the city.

The average annual rainfall is 1357 mm with August as the wettest month and April as the driest. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 23.5 °C, and lowest in January, at around -1.5 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hirosaki peaked at around the year 2000 and has declined since then.
==City emblem==
Hirosaki uses a Buddhist &quot;manji&quot; as its official emblem. This came from the flag emblem of Tsugaru clan, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Hirosaki Domain during the Edo period.

==History==
Many human-shaped clay figures have been unearthed around the region which date as far back as 12,000 years. More of these figures date from the Jomon and Yayoi period.

The area around Hirosaki formed part of the domains of the Northern Fujiwara in the Heian period; Minamoto no Yoritomo awarded it to the Nanbu clan in the early Kamakura period after the defeat of the Northern Fujiwara (1189). During the Sengoku period a local retainer of the Nambu, Ōura Tamenobu, declared his independence (1571) and seized local castles. He pledged fealty to Toyotomi Hideyoshi at the Battle of Odawara in 1590, and was confirmed in his holdings with revenues of 45,000 &quot;koku&quot;. He also changed his name to &quot;Tsugaru&quot;. After siding with Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara, he was re-confirmed in his holdings with a nominal &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 47,000 &quot;koku&quot; and he began construction of a castle in Takaoka (present-day Hirosaki). This marked the start of Hirosaki Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. His successor, Tsugaru Nobuhira, completed the castle in 1611, but its massive 5-story &quot;tenshu&quot; was lost to lightning in 1627. The domain&#x27;s &quot;kokudaka&quot; increased to 100,000 &quot;koku&quot; in 1628.

The Tsugaru clan sided with the Satchō Alliance in the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, and was rewarded by the new Meiji government with an additional 10,000 &quot;koku&quot;. However, with the abolition of the han system on August 29, 1871, Hirosaki Domain was abolished, and replaced by Hirosaki Prefecture. The prefecture was renamed Aomori Prefecture in October of the same year, and the prefectural capital was relocated to the more centrally located Aomori.

Chōyō Elementary School was established on October 1, 1873. Apple horticulture was introduced to Hirosaki from 1877 and the 59th National Bank, the predecessor of Aomori Bank opened in March 1878. Hirosaki was proclaimed a city on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system and was thus one of the first 30 cities in Japan. It was also the third largest city in the Tōhoku region after Sendai and Morioka at the time. The Ōu Main Line connected Hirosaki with Aomori on December 1, 1894.

Hirosaki became the home garrison town for the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s IJA 8th Division from October, 1898. The division was prominently active in the Russo-Japanese War.

Hirosaki City Hospital was established in 1901, and Hirosaki City Library in 1906. The first telephone service in the city started in 1909. The first Cherry Blossom Festival was held in 1918. In 1927, the Kōnan Railway connected Hirosaki with Onoe. Hirosaki University was established in 1949.

On March 1, 1955, Hirosaki expanded through annexation of neighboring villages of Shimizu, Wattoku, Toyoda, Horikoshi, Chitose, Fujishiro, Niina, Funazawa, Takasugi, Susono and Higashimeya. Nishimeya became an enclave. The city further expanded on September 1, 1957, through annexation of neighboring Ishikawa Village.

In 1979, the city was connected to the Tōhoku Expressway by a spur road named &quot;Apple Road&quot;.

On February 27, 2006, old Hirosaki city, the town of Iwaki, and the village of Sōma were merged into an expanded city of Hirosaki.

In 2012, the city began partnering with the French commune of Beuvron-en-Auge in the Pays d&#x27;Auge region of Normandy, which has been granted &quot;appellation contrôlée&quot; status for its cider and calvados brandy made from cider. The partnership aims to promote economic and touristic development by creating opportunities related to apples.

==Government==
Hirosaki has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 28 members. The city, together with the neighbouring village of Nishimeya, contributes six members to the Aomori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Aomori 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.7 °C, and lowest in January, at around -1.9 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data:

==History==
The area around Hachinohe has been occupied since prehistoric times, and was a major population center for the Emishi people. Numerous Jōmon period remains have been discovered within the borders of Hachinohe. The area was nominally under control of the Northern Fujiwara in the Heian period, and became part of the holdings granted to the Nanbu clan after the defeat of the North Fujiwara by Minamoto no Yoritomo in the Kamakura period. The Nanbu established numerous horse ranches, accompanied by numbered fortified settlements. During the Edo period, it was initially part of Morioka Domain, but in 1664 the Tokugawa shogunate authorized the creation of a separate 20,000 &quot;koku&quot; Hachinohe Domain for a junior line of the Nanbu clan. The town prospered as a castle town centered on Hachinohe Castle, and served as a small commercial centre and port for the fishing grounds off southeastern Hokkaido. Today, the port still serves the fishing industry and a number of international cargo vessels.

After the Meiji Restoration, Hachinohe Domain was abolished, and replaced by Hachinohe Prefecture, which was subsequently merged into Aomori Prefecture. Initially, there was a debate as to whether the capital of newly formed Aomori Prefecture should be at Hachinohe or Hirosaki; however, due to strong rivalry between the former Nanbu domain and former Tsugaru Domain, the Meiji government decided to build a new town called Aomori in a central location, and to designate it as the capital of the prefecture.

Per the Meiji period establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the town of Hachinohe was created within Sannohe District. In 1901, it merged with neighboring Chōja, and on May 1, 1929, with neighboring Konakano, Minato and Same villages to form the city of Hachinohe. The city further expanded by annexing the village of Shimonaganawashiro in 1942, Korekawa in 1954, Ichikawa, Kaminaganawashiro, Tachi and Toyosaki in 1955 and Odate in 1958.

On March 31, 2005, the village of Nangō (from Sannohe District) was also merged into Hachinohe.

During the American occupation of Japan following World War II, a United States Army base, Camp Haugen, was located in Hachinohe, and was the home of the Seventh Division. An Armed Forces Radio Service radio station was located on the base; it was known as AFRS Hachinohe. In 1950, after the North Korean invasion of South Korea, troops from Camp Haugen left for Korea. AFRS Hachinohe altered its broadcasts to include coverage of South Korea so Americans could benefit from its news and entertainment programs. With the final withdrawal of American forces from Hachinohe in 1956, the base was turned over to the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force and was officially re-designated JGSDF Camp Hachinohe.

In March 2011, the city was one of those hit by the 2011 Japanese tsunami. The tsunami tossed many huge fishing boats ashore and heavily damaged the port area. About 100 homes were destroyed. Divers from the United States Navy ship &quot;Safeguard&quot; joined with Japanese workers to help clear the port to facilitate the delivery of relief supplies via the city.

On January 1, 2017, Hachinohe was given core city status, with increased local autonomy.

==Government==
Hachinohe has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 32 members. Hachinohe contributes eight members to the Aomori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Aomori 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Hachinohe is the largest city in eastern Aomori Prefecture, and serves as the regional industrial and commercial center. Commercial fishing still plays a major role in the local economy, with Hachinohe port having one of the largest volumes of landed fish in Japan. However, since its designation as a new industrial city in 1964, Hachinohe has developed a large coastal industrial belt with a diverse range of chemical, steel, cement and fertilizer products. Major industrial parks include the Hachinohe High Tech Park and Hachinohe North-Interchange Industrial Complex. The Hachinohe Thermal Power Station, an LNG-fired power plant operated by Tohoku Electric is located in the city. Hachinohe Port is a major international port for northern Japan.

==Education==
===Colleges and universities===
*Hachinohe Gakuin Junior College

The art of &quot;Yawata-uma&quot; figurines is a regional art form and popular souvenir.

===Local festivals===
*Emburi is a citywide festival which is also celebrated in nearby towns. The object of the festival is to pray for a bountiful harvest in the coming year. It originated as a dance with an agricultural tool (the &quot;eburi&quot;; &quot;enburi&quot; is a local pronunciation), which was used to teach people how to cultivate the land. Nowadays it is a parade of 15-20 people, with 3-5 dancers and a singer accompanied by wooden flutes, drums and bells. The festival takes place February 17–20, and marks the official end of the long, harsh winter.
*Hachinohe Sansha Taisai is another citywide festival and is considered to be the main festival of the town. It is also billed as &quot;Japan&#x27;s Biggest Float Festival&quot;. &quot;Sansha&quot; means &quot;three shrines&quot; and &quot;Taisai&quot; means &quot;festival&quot;: It is held by three Shinto shrines: Ogami Jinja, Shinra Jinja, and Shinmei-gu. Floats proceed through the main streets of the city, accompanied by people with drums, flutes and loud calls. 27 different floats are used, and they are proudly constructed and flourished by the members of various organizations, such as schools and the city hall. The floats are also accompanied by men in samurai costumes on horseback, and tiger dancers. On the second and third days of the festival, a traditional game of a sport similar to polo is held at the stables of Shinra Shrine. This sport (加賀美流騎馬打毬 &quot;Kaga Biryū Kiba Dakyū&quot;) is officially an &quot;intangible cultural asset&quot; of Aomori Prefecture. Sansha Taisai takes place from July 31 to August 4 every year.

<text>The Detroit Fury were an arena football team based in Auburn Hills, Michigan. They were a member of the original Arena Football League from 2001 to 2004 and played at The Palace of Auburn Hills, also the home of the NBA&#x27;s Detroit Pistons. They were the first team to play in Detroit since the Detroit Drive, four-time ArenaBowl champions, before that franchise relocated to Worcester, Massachusetts, and were rebranded the Massachusetts Marauders. The team was co-owned by William Davidson, who owned the Pistons, along with William Clay Ford, Jr., son of the owner of the National Football League Detroit Lions.

==History==
Eight years after the departure of the Detroit Drive to Massachusetts, Detroit Pistons owner Bill Davidson and William Clay Ford, Jr., son of Detroit Lions owner William Clay Ford, Sr., came together to purchase an expansion franchise in the original Arena Football League. A name the team contest was held in 2000 to generate public interest with over 3000 submissions. The name Detroit Fury, submitted by teenager Todd Nye, was selected as the winner. The Fury played their home games at The Palace of Auburn Hills, home of the Pistons at the time and had three coaches in four years: legendary coach Mouse Davis, former NFL Europe and XFL head coach Al Luginbill and his son Tom Luginbill, who coached the Tennessee Valley Vipers in af2. The Fury made the playoffs in their first season and again in 2003. Unfortunately, the Fury did not have the same success as its predecessors before them.

The owners were unable to find a buyer for their franchise and, on September 20, 2004, the AFL announced the termination of this franchise, and that its players would be made available to the remaining teams in a dispersal draft.

<doc id="328191" wikidata="Q496401" url="?curid=328191" title="Misawa, Aomori">
<text>is a city located in Aomori Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 38,198 in 19493 households, and a population density of 330 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

Misawa is the location of a large military base, Misawa Air Base, which is under joint operation of the United States Air Force&#x27;s 35th Fighter Wing, Naval Air Facility, and Japan Air Self-Defense Force&#x27;s 3rd Fighter Wing. It is also an important US base for signals intelligence and related activities. The city population figures do not include the estimated 10,000 American military personnel and their dependents stationed at Misawa Air Base.

==Geography==
Misawa is located in the flatlands on the southern shore of Lake Ogawara on the east coast of Aomori Prefecture, facing the Pacific Ocean. The nearest large city is Hachinohe which is 30 to 40 minutes away by car. The surrounding area is mostly rural and scenic. There is some limited nightlife, mostly concentrated around the American air base. Tokyo is an hour away by air, about 3 and a half hours by train, and about 10–12 hours by car. Misawa has well-defined seasons. Though short, autumn is beautiful with pleasant temperatures, late-blooming flowers, and the changing colors of the trees. Winter gets serious in early December, peaks in January and February, and starts fading near the end of March. Strong winds often intensify the cold temperatures. Snowfall is frequent, and in January and February, snow does not melt completely. Icy roads are also a concern as the sunshine will often melt the snow and then as afternoon temperatures cool down, the water from the melted snow and ice refreezes. As the ice and snow clear and the ground dries, dust storms become a hazard near farm fields. In early spring, the winds switch and come from the east off the ocean. Thick sea fog is common in the morning or early evening. May is usually quite pleasant with warm temperatures. The onset of summer usually brings the rainy season. This normally begins in mid-June and continues for an unpredictable period of time. However, it normally clears out around mid to late July. The end of July through August can get quite hot and humid.

&lt;/div style&gt;

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Misawa has remained relatively stable in recent decades.

==History==
The area around Misawa has been occupied since the Japanese Paleolithic period, and was a major population center for the Emishi people. Numerous Jōmon period remains have been discovered within the borders of Misawa, including within the borders of Misawa Air Base. The area was nominally under control of the Northern Fujiwara in the Heian period, and became part of the holdings granted to the Nanbu clan after the defeat of the North Fujiwara by Minamoto no Yoritomo in the early Kamakura period. The Nanbu established numerous horse ranches, accompanied by a series of numbered fortified settlements in the region. During the Edo period, the area was part of Morioka Domain and was later transferred to the holdings of the subsidiary Shichinohe Domain during the mid-Edo period.. After the Meiji Restoration, the area was settled by many dispossessed ex-samurai from former Aizu Domain.

Per the post-Meiji restoration establishment of the modern municipalities system on 1 April 1889, the village of Misawa was created within Kamikita District through the merger of Misawa and Tengamori hamlets. The area was devastated by a tsunami in March 1896. In 1931, in the first successful nonstop transpacific flight, Clyde Pangborn and Hugh Herndon, in the airplane &quot;Miss Veedol&quot;, took off from Misawa&#x27;s Sabishiro Beach and landed in present-day East Wenatchee, Washington in the United States. Coastal areas of Misawa were again devastated by a tsunami in March 1933. An Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service base was established in 1941, and nearby Lake Ogawara was reportedly one of the lakes used by the Imperial Japanese Navy to practice for the attack on Pearl Harbor, due to its shallow depth. The base was heavily bombed by the United States Navy in 1945, and subsequently occupied by the United States after the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II.

On 11 February 1948, the town of Omisawa was founded through the merger of Misawa village with portions of Rokunohe, Shimoda and Uranodate villages. Misawa Airport was opened on 11 January 1952, with Japan Airlines providing scheduled services to Haneda Airport in Tokyo and Chitose Airport in Hokkaidō. The town was renamed Misawa, and elevated to city status on 1 September 1958. Misawa Airport was closed on 31 March 1965. On 11 January 1966, a large fire destroyed most of the center of the city. On 19 August 1969, the 51st annual Japanese High School Baseball Championship was held in Misawa. Misawa Airport reopened on 10 May 1975. In the year 2000, Misawa hosted the winter events for the 55th annual National Sports Festival of Japan.

==Government==
Misawa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 18 members. Misawa contributes one member to the Aomori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Aomori 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Misawa serves as a regional industrial and commercial center, with agriculture and commercial fishing playing secondary roles in the local economy. The large foreign presence at Misawa Air Base also makes a large impact on the local economy.

==Education==
Misawa has seven public elementary schools and five public middle schools operated by the city government and two public high schools operated by the Aomori Prefectural Board of Education.

At the Kosuimatsuri , the new Lake Ogawara Queen is crowned; synonymous to &quot;Miss Misawa&quot;, which consists of two women from Misawa between the age of 15–25, and one American citizen from Misawa Air Base, of the same age range. Misawa also hosts &quot;Japan Day&quot; within Misawa Air Base, at the base&#x27;s Collocated Club. There is also &quot;American Day&quot;, occurring generally a week or so after Memorial Day, at which time Japanese and American friendship is strengthened through the festive environment of food vendors and a large parade.

<text>The Chicago Rush were a professional arena football team based in Rosemont, Illinois. The team was founded in 2001 and played in the Arena Football League&#x27;s Central Division. The Rush qualified for the playoffs in 11 of 12 AFL seasons, during which they won ArenaBowl XX in 2006 and captured five division titles. The Rush played home games at Allstate Arena from 2001 to 2012. The team struggled to find a permanent owner and later relocated to Rockford, Illinois in 2013 to play their final season. The AFL itself ceased operations in 2019. In 2023, Chicago-based music producer Ernest Clark acquired the Rush and announced plans to join a revived AFL in 2025. However, the AFL folded again in 2024.

== History ==

===Founding===
The Rush made its AFL debut in 2001. The team played its home games at the Allstate Arena (formerly known as the Rosemont Horizon), the same venue previously used by the Chicago Bruisers, one of the four original Arena Football League teams.

===2001–2005===
Mike Hohensee was the franchise&#x27;s first coach, and he remained the Rush&#x27;s only coach until becoming the head coach of the Philadelphia Soul in 2011. 

In their inaugural year (2001), the Rush finished the regular season with a 7–7 and won their first playoff game, beating the Orlando Predators 41–26. They lost to the eventual ArenaBowl XV champion Grand Rapids Rampage 53–21. The team featured young players that would become Rush fixtures and fan favorites in the years to come, including quarterback Billy Dicken, Joe Douglass, Damien Porter and Jamie McGourty, and Riley Kleinhesselink, Cedric Walker, and Anthony Ladd.

In 2002, the Rush won the Central division with a 9–5 record and received a bye in the playoffs. Dicken returned at quarterback and Chicago added Antonio Chatman who was named to the All-Rookie team as the team&#x27;s main wide receiver and return man. Chicago added defensive linemen John Moyer and James Baron. They defeated the Dallas Desperados 60–47, but fell in the semifinals to the Arizona Rattlers 46–35.

In 2003, the AFL expanded from 14 games to 16. Dicken was the team&#x27;s quarterback, but missed time after breaking his jaw in the middle of the season. Antonio Chatman broke Rush franchise records for All-Purpose and Return Yards. He caught 123 passes for 1,636 yards and 29 touchdowns. On special teams, he netted 2,062 return yards and got into the end zone seven times. Chicago also signed DeJuan Alfonzo early in the season from the Indiana Firebirds. Alfonzo would be with the team until 2010. Chicago also signed FB/LB Bob McMillen, who would play with the team until 2007 and became the Rush&#x27;s head coach in 2011. After starting the season 0–3, the Rush finished 8–5 and got into the playoffs as a Wild Card Team. After the team&#x27;s 0-3 start, Chicago squared off against the 3-0 Los Angeles Avengers, facing off against Tony Graziani and the league&#x27;s top ranked offense. Dameon Porter sealed the win with a key interception at the goal line with one minute left to play. The victory turned around the Rush season. Chicago defeated the Indiana Firebirds on the final day of the regular season, 46–43 in overtime, to clinch a playoff berth. Chicago did not win a playoff game, and fell in the Wild Card Game to the New York Dragons 48–45. Chatman went to the NFL after the season, signing with the Green Bay Packers.

In 2004, the Rush signed Raymond Philyaw as their quarterback. Philyaw was known for his efficiency and record touchdown-interception ratio. In 2004, Philyaw threw just four interceptions. Chicago started the year 4–0, their best start in franchise history. The Rush won the Central division with an 11–5 record. They won their first-round game 59–49 over the Orlando Predators but fell in the semifinals to the eventual ArenaBowl XVIII champion San Jose SaberCats 49–35. Chicago led early in the game, but Philyaw tore his ACL on a scramble, and the Rush could not overcome the injury.

In 2005, they went to the AFL playoffs as the #3 seed in the American Conference. They won the conference semifinal over the Los Angeles Avengers 52–45, but ended up losing the American Conference Championship Game to the eventual ArenaBowl XIX Champion Colorado Crush in overtime, with a final score of 49–43. That game became known as the &quot;Confetti Game&quot;, due to an arena employee firing a confetti cannon prematurely, when the game was extended due to a defensive penalty on the final play. After a ten-minute delay to clean the confetti, the Rush were able to tie the game on the untimed down, forcing the overtime period.

===2006: ArenaBowl XX champions===
In 2006, despite their first losing record of 7–9, the Rush got into the playoffs, receiving the #5 seed in the American Conference.

In the off-season, signed former Heisman Trophy finalist Michael Bishop and Matt D&#x27;Orazio to fight to be the team&#x27;s starting quarterback, and D&#x27;Orazio got the game. During the regular season, Chicago started the year at 0–2, but during the season, the Rush picked up defensive back Jeremy Unertl and offensive specialist Bobby Sippio. Both made huge impacts on their respective sides of the ball.

With a 5–9 record, the Rush won its last two games of the regular season to get a playoff spot. In the playoffs, the Rush managed to pull off key upsets. In the Wild Card Round, the Rush defeated the fourth-seeded Nashville Kats 55–47. In the Divisional Round, Chicago managed to pull off a huge upset by taking down the defending champion Colorado Crush, 63–46. In the Conference Championship they upset the second-seeded San Jose SaberCats 59–56, giving the Rush their first ArenaBowl appearance in franchise history.

In ArenaBowl XX, the Rush defeated the Orlando Predators, 69–61, to give Chicago their first Arena Bowl title. Quarterback Matt D&#x27;Orazio was Offensive Player of the Game, wide receiver/defensive back Dennison Robinson took Defensive Player of the Game honors, and fullback/linebacker Bob McMillen was named the Ironman of the Game. With the win, the Rush became the first team with a losing regular-season record to win a championship in any sport since the 1937–38 Chicago Blackhawks.

===2007–2008===
In 2007, the team won the American Conference Central Division with a record of 12–4. D&#x27;Orazio was the team&#x27;s quarterback and Bobby Sippio, in his first full season with the Rush caught 125 passes for 1,742 yards and 53 passes. After the season, Sippio would sign with the Kansas City Chiefs. They defeated the L.A. Avengers on June 9, 2007 in the divisional finals. They then played the San Jose SaberCats for the conference final, yet they came up short losing 61–49.

In 2008, the Rush made a free agency splash by signing AFL legends Sherdrick Bonner and Damian Harrell. The Rush opened its 2008 campaign against the defending ArenaBowl XXI champion San Jose Sabercats. Chicago convincingly defeated the Sabercats 70–47 in front of 15,409 fans at the Allstate Arena. Injuries allowed Russ Michna to become the team&#x27;s starter over Bonner. Harrell, Donovan Morgan, and Travis LaTendresse would all post 1,000-yard receiving seasons. En route to an 11–5 season, Chicago locked up the conference&#x27;s top seed and home field advantage for the entire playoffs. It was the first time Chicago had home field advantage and the Rush had never lost a home playoff game, going 3–0. The Grand Rapids Rampage drew Chicago in the divisional round. The Rampage finished the regular season 6–10 but stunned the Rush and 14,338 fans 58–41. The Rampage would lose a week later to the Sabercats at the HP Pavilion.

===2009: Arena Football League restructuring===
In 2009, the Arena Football League suspended operations to refinance and restructure its business plan. After a one-year layoff, the AFL and Chicago Rush returned in 2010 with a single entity model.

===2010: rebirth===
On December 10, 2009, it was announced that the Rush would be returning for 2010 under new ownership as a member of Arena Football 1. The ownership obtained the rights to the name after a court auction granted the AF1 control of the AFL&#x27;s assets. Two months later, the AF1 decided to adopt the former Arena Football League name.

The 2010 Rush roster would feature many new faces. However, former Rush players quarterback Russ Michna, jack linebacker/wide receiver DeJuan Alfonzo, and linemen Joe Peters, Robert Boss, and Beau Elliot rejoined the team. Also on the roster was wide receiver Samie Parker, Thaddeus Coleman, and kicker Chris Gould.

Chicago returned to the field on April 2, 2010 on the road against the Iowa Barnstormers. The game was broadcast on the NFL Network and Chicago won 61–43. The Rush began the season 4–0 and were in first place in the division at 10–4. However, the team lost its last two games, first to the 1–13 Dallas Vigilantes and then closed out the year on the road losing to the Spokane Shock. It cost the team a chance at the division title and forced the team to go on the road for the playoffs. The team ended the regular season at 10–6, and lost to the Milwaukee Iron in the playoffs.

===2011: 10-year anniversary===
The Rush celebrated its 10th season in 2011. Bob McMillen replaced Mike Hohensee to become the team&#x27;s second head coach in team history, and Russ Michna returned at quarterback. Chicago finished the regular season with a 13–5 record and finished first in the Central Division. It was the most regular season wins in Rush history, breaking the 2007 team&#x27;s 12-4 mark. Defensive back Vic Hall broke AFL record for interceptions in a season with 15, doing it as a rookie. The Rush defense led the league in points allowed (46.3 per game) and broke league records for the most turnovers (56) and interceptions (42) in a season. Wide receiver Reggie Gray finished the year with the most catches (130) and receiving yards (1,969) in franchise history, and tied the Rush record with 53 total touchdowns. Bobby Sippio held the old records. Chicago defeated the Dallas Vigilantes at Allstate Arena in the first round of the playoffs, but the Rush season ended the following week, falling to the Arizona Rattlers in the National Conference Championship Game. Arizona advanced to ArenaBowl XXIV, but lost to the Jacksonville Sharks in the championship. For the Rush, it marked the sixth time in franchise history the team had advanced to the AFL Conference Championships.

===2012: AFL&#x27;s Silver Anniversary===
The 2012 season marked the AFL&#x27;s 25th season and number 11 for the Rush. The ownership group, Chicago Gridiron LLC, declared bankruptcy before the season started and abandoned the team. The league stepped in and ran the Rush during the 2012 season. Chicago began the year with a 70–48 home victory against the Tampa Bay Storm on March 10 at Allstate Arena. In 2012, the Rush re-signed quarterback Russ Michna, the franchises all-time leading passer, 2011 Second Team All-Arena WR Reggie Gray and 2011 AFL Defensive Player of the Year DB Vic Hall, jack linebacker Kelvin Morris, and offensive lineman T.J. Watkins.

===2013: ownership struggles and relocation to Rockford===

On November 12, 2012, the Chicago Rush were purchased by a group, headed by Julee White of Testarossa Entertainment, but the purchase was terminated by the AFL three months later due to the ownership&#x27;s failure to meet league obligations.

On February 7, 2013, the Rush were purchased by Star Rush Football, LLC, an ownership led by private-equity firm manager David Staral Jr. Weeks later, they finalized a deal with Allstate Arena in Rosemont to play all but two home games. The other two home games (June 8 against the Utah Blaze and June 15 versus the San Antonio Talons) were played at the BMO Harris Bank Center in Rockford, Illinois, which hosted the first &quot;test game&quot; for the AFL in 1986. One week before the season opener, the new ownership group introduced the team&#x27;s new logo and uniforms, which removed the gray from the logo and replaced it with red.

In May 2013, David Staral Jr. bounced a check needed to secure Allstate Arena for two upcoming home games. Upon the news, the AFL took over control of the franchise. Staral later pleaded guilty to Federal bankruptcy and wire fraud charges for concealing that he was undergoing bankruptcy proceedings while in negotiations to buy the team.

On August 1, 2013 the Rush traveled to Spokane, Washington to play the 14-4 Spokane Shock in the first round of the AFL playoffs. They lost to Spokane, 69–47. Three costly turnovers in the fourth quarter sealed the deal. Spokane went on to win another playoff game.

The league has announced that the Rush did not sign a two-year commitment form to play in 2014 or 2015. The team&#x27;s roster was liquidated in a dispersal draft.

===2024: attempted revival ===

In February 2023, the AFL was relaunched. In October, the league announced the return of the Rush for the 2025 season. However, the new AFL ceased operations and the league&#x27;s surviving eight teams transitioned to the newly-formed Arena Football One (AF1) in September 2024. The Rush were not included in the AF1&#x27;s inaugural 2025 season.

==Media coverage==
The Chicago Rush originally had games broadcast on the now defunct Fox Sports Net Chicago during its first two seasons from 2001–02 with mostly Saturday night telecasts. When the AFL signed with NBC from 2003–06, the Rush was one of the most prominently featured teams during the national NBC broadcasts as well as playoff games and the majority of Chicago&#x27;s games moved to Sunday afternoons. A few of the games not picked up by NBC remained on FSN Chicago until 2006. Beginning in the 2007 season, the AFL began a TV partnership with ESPN and FSN Chicago went under and Comcast SportsNet Chicago took its place. Once again the Rush were widely featured during the national ESPN telecasts on Monday nights and Sunday afternoons.

The regional telecasts went to Comcast SportsNet. From 2001 to 2008, the Rush games were broadcast by Tom Dore and former Chicago Bears offensive lineman James &quot;Big Cat&quot; Williams. The radio deals bounced between 670 The Score and ESPN Radio 1000.

When the Rush returned in 2010, the AFL signed its TV deal with NFL Network, but the Rush were not featured as often as they had been with ESPN and NBC, averaging between 2 and 3 telecasts a year on NFL Network in 2010 and 2011, but were shutout from the national spotlight in 2012. Occasionally region games air on CSN and WGN&#x27;s CLTV, and all AFL games are streamed for free online through UStream.
Online Radio and TV Broadcasts were handled by former Chicago Bruisers Broadcaster Les Grobstein in 2010 through 2013 without a color commentator.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Mutsu has declined over the past 40 years.

==History==
Mutsu was founded on September 1, 1959 through the merger of the former towns of Ōminato and Tanabu. Tanabu had been the location of a &quot;daikansho&quot; under the Morioka Domain in the Edo period, and was a resettlement and colonization zone for dispossessed ex-samurai of the defeated Aizu Domain after the Boshin War. The village of Ōminato was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on 1 April 1889, and was raised to town status on November 10, 1928. Ōminato was a port town, and home to the Ōminato Guard District, a major base for the Imperial Japanese Navy until the end of World War II. The town and its military base were bombed repeatedly from the middle of July to middle of August 1945 during World War II. The base facilities were used by the United States Navy during the occupation of Japan, and (on a reduced scale) by the Japan Maritime Self Defence Force to date.

Ōminato merged with the adjacent town of Tanabe to form the city Ōminato-Tanabu (coupling of the names of two antecedent towns) on September 1, 1959; its name was changed to Mutsu in 1960. At the time, it was the only city with a &quot;hiragana&quot; name (むつ), which was adopted to avoid confusion with the original &quot;kanji&quot; word Mutsu (陸奥) which indicates the old province that covered most of the modern Tōhoku region.

On March 14, 2005, the towns of Kawauchi and Ōhata, and the village of Wakinosawa (all from Shimokita District) were merged into Mutsu.

==Government==
Mutsu has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 26 members. Mutsu, together with Shimokita District, contributes three members to the Aomori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Aomori 1st district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The economy of Mutsu is heavily dependent on agriculture, forestry and fishing, especially scallop aquaculture in Mutsu Bay. The city is also the location for various facilities of the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, and was the home port for the nuclear powered research vessel &quot;Mutsu&quot;, until its decommissioning in 1997.

==Education==
Mutsu has 12 public elementary schools and nine middle schools operated by the city government, and four public high schools operated by the Aomori Prefectural Board of Education.

<doc id="328198" wikidata="Q13561228" url="?curid=328198" title="Philadelphia Soul">
<text>The Philadelphia Soul can refer to one of two successive professional arena football teams in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They both have competed in the Arena Football League (AFL). The Soul made six ArenaBowl appearances, winning their first appearance (2008 against the San Jose SaberCats) and losing their next two appearances (2012 and 2013 both to the Arizona Rattlers). The Soul won in their fourth appearance, against the Rattlers in 2016, winning 56–42. They also won in their fifth appearance in 2017 against the Tampa Bay Storm, winning 44–40 before losing in their sixth appearance in 2019 to the Albany Empire 45–27.

The club was established in 2004 when a group, led by Jon Bon Jovi, secured the rights to an AFL franchise in Philadelphia. The AFL folded before the proposed 2009 season was to begin, but was purchased and revived in 2010. After two seasons of inactivity in 2009 and 2010, the Soul returned in 2011 headed by Ron Jaworski. Following the 2019 season, the AFL ceased operations again.

The ownership of the revived AFL announced on July 19, 2023, that they planned to bring back the Soul in 2024 under new ownership. In May of 2024, the Soul again folded for the rest of the season after playing only two games.

==History==

===Jon Bon Jovi era (2004–2008)===
The team was owned by co-majority owners Jon Bon Jovi and Craig Spencer along with minority owners Richie Sambora, Ron &quot;Jaws&quot; Jaworski (former QB of the NFL&#x27;s Philadelphia Eagles) and Leo Carlin, Jr. The Soul began play in February 2004, and played its home games at the Wells Fargo Center (then known as the Wachovia Center), home of the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL and the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA. When there was a scheduling conflict with the NBA or NHL, games were played at the now-demolished Wachovia Spectrum—the former home of the Flyers, 76ers, Philadelphia Phantoms AHL hockey team and the Philadelphia KiXX MISL soccer franchise. The Soul played in the Eastern Division of the National Conference of the AFL. The name &quot;Soul&quot; referred to the Philadelphia soul music genre, a play on Bon Jovi&#x27;s career as a musician (Bon Jovi&#x27;s style of pop rock, however, bore no resemblance to the genre of music known as Philadelphia soul). The official mascot of the Soul was the Blues Brother-like &quot;Soul Man&quot;.

In 2005, the Soul began the season by beating the Austin Wranglers 66–35. However, after five games, the Soul had two wins and three losses, which led to the firing of head coach Michael Trigg.

The Soul made Tony Graziani the highest-paid player in Arena League history. The move left them with little money under the salary cap to improve their defense, and as a result, they were not in competition for the playoffs. The elimination came even after NBC scheduled 14 games of the Soul to be shown on national or regional television.

In 2006, the Soul began 2–0. They went 2–0 against division rival Dallas Desperados (who finished a league best 13–3), and finished the season at 9–7 and earned their first playoff berth through the wild card. In their wild card playoff game, the Soul defeated the Austin Wranglers in Austin, 52–35. The score was 21–21 at halftime, but the #5 seed Soul outscored the #4 Wranglers 21–7 in the third quarter and ran away with the game. The Soul lost their Divisional Round Playoff game 31–27 to the Orlando Predators in the infamous &quot;round of golf&quot;, so-called because viewers missed much of the 1st quarter of that game and another AFL game being broadcast simultaneously due to a PGA Golf tournament that was televised on NBC.

The Soul started 4–0 in 2007 before losing to the Georgia Force, 57–49. Afterwards, they lost on a Monday night contest to their division rival, the Dallas Desperados, 51–41. In the game, Tony Graziani left the game early with a separated left shoulder from a sack by OL/DL Rickie Simpkins. He would miss the next four weeks, all losses, dropping the team to 4–6. Graziani returned in week 12 against the New Orleans VooDoo and led the team to its highest scoring output in its short franchise history, winning 78–34. In a Week 16 &quot;win-and-in&quot; matchup with the Columbus Destroyers, Graziani led the Soul down the field and threw a touchdown pass to Charles Pauley with seven seconds left, giving the Soul a 56–53 win and their second trip to the playoffs in their four-year history. In the playoffs, they defeated the Orlando Predators 41–26, then traveled to Atlanta to take on the Georgia Force in the Divisional Round, but lost 65–39.

In 2008, the Soul signed WR Chris Jackson in the off-season. He was united with a former teammate in Tony Graziani. In the offseason the Soul were picked by many as the favorite to win the championship. However, after another good start, once again Graziani was injured. He was replaced by Matt D&#x27;Orazio. Unlike previous years, in 2008 the Soul backup was able to keep the team going. He played well enough that when Graziani was healthy once more, the coaching staff decided to allow D&#x27;Orazio to keep the starting job. The Soul finished the 2008 season with a 13–3 record and earned a first-round bye. In the divisional round the Soul defeated the New York Dragons. In the conference finals the Soul were able to defeat the Cleveland Gladiators to earn their first berth to the ArenaBowl. They then won their first ArenaBowl on Sunday, July 27, 2008 in a 59–56 win over the San Jose SaberCats in ArenaBowl XXII.

The team suspended operations along with the rest of the Arena Football League in 2009. Bon Jovi would then form another ownership group with members of Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment five years later seeking to purchase the National Football League&#x27;s Buffalo Bills; the Bon Jovi consortium was outbid by Terry and Kim Pegula.

===Ron Jaworski era (2011–2019)===
On February 17, 2010, the AFL extended an offer to the Soul to make a return to arena football. That offer was accepted, as the Soul returned in 2011 playing all their home games at the then-recently renamed Wells Fargo Center. Jaworski and Spencer returned from the prior ownership group, and Pete Ciarrocchi (owner of local sports bar Chickie&#x27;s and Pete&#x27;s) and Cosmo DeNicola (who was the owner of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers from the now-defunct af2 league) joined the new Soul&#x27;s ownership. Notably absent was Jon Bon Jovi, who cited his group&#x27;s tour as a reason for declining ownership, but still maintains his support for the Soul and their new ownership. The team hired future Arena Football Hall of Famer, Mike Hohensee, to lead the revived team. Despite high expectations, the Soul stumbled out of the gate and never recovered, finishing just 6–12, last place in the East.

In , the Soul began the season with new head coach Doug Plank. They finished the regular season with the league&#x27;s best record at 15–3. They would advance to ArenaBowl XXV, but lost to the Arizona Rattlers 72–54. Less than a week later, Plank announced his resignation.

In , the Soul hired offensive coordinator, Clint Dolezel, to succeed Plank. Dolezel&#x27;s familiarity with many of the Soul players made it easy for the team to maintain success through the 2013 season. The Soul finished the regular season 12–6, winning the Eastern Division for a second season in a row. Dolezel would lead the Soul back to ArenaBowl XXVI, but the team once again fell to the Rattlers 48–39.

In September 2014, New Orleans Saints wide receiver Marques Colston bought a share of the team; Jaworski remained the majority owner. In August 2015, additional pieces of the team were sold to Colston&#x27;s Saints teammate, Philadelphia native Jahri Evans, and to former Eagles coach Dick Vermeil.

In , the Soul finished the regular season with a 13–3 record, the best in the American Conference. In the playoffs, they first defeated the Tampa Bay Storm, then the Jacksonville Sharks, to claim the American Conference Championship. In ArenaBowl XXIX, they defeated the National Conference Champion Arizona Rattlers 56–42 to claim their second AFL Championship.

Before , the AFL contracted to five teams and the conferences were abolished. In 2017, the Soul went 13–1. On August 12, 2017, the Soul defeated the Baltimore Brigade 69–54 to advance to their fifth ArenaBowl in ArenaBowl XXX on August 26, 2017, at Wells Fargo Center against the Tampa Bay Storm. In that game, the Soul came back from an ArenaBowl record 13-point deficit to win 44–40 and repeat as AFL Champions.

In March 2017, the Soul signed a deal with &quot;Total Turf Experience&quot; in Mantua Township, New Jersey. The indoor practice facility became home to the Soul for its daily practices, team events, tryouts, combines, and clinics.

===2024 revival===
 On July 20, 2023, new AFL commissioner Lee Hutton stated to &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; that the Soul would be revived with the new league with former co-owner Ron Jaworski expected to return, if not as an owner, then as a consultant. Jaworski stated in November that, for &quot;no particular reason,&quot; he would not be involved with the traveling team bearing the Soul&#x27;s name, and that Hutton&#x27;s previous claim was untrue. After some rumors circulated on social media that the Soul were facing ownership challenges, Commissioner Hutton stated that although the owners had dropped out, the League would ensure operations for the Soul. He also revealed that the team would play their 2024 home schedule at CURE Insurance Arena in Trenton, New Jersey.

Shortly before the team was slated to travel to Louisiana for its first game against the Louisiana VooDoo, head coach Patrick Pimmel and nearly the entire Soul roster resigned or were abruptly fired. The Dallas Falcons of the American Arena League played as replacement players using the Soul uniforms and identity, along with three members of the Soul who had made it to Louisiana. Starting quarterback Joe Mancuso was among those who had left the team, with his agent accusing the league of misrepresenting itself and housing the team in a Super 8 Motel in a decrepit part of the city instead of the promised apartments; Mancuso immediately returned to the Indoor Football League following the fiasco.

In May of 2024, General Manager Kelly Logan announced via the &quot;TAKE THE 8 COUNT&quot; YouTube channel that the team will cease operations for the rest of the 2024 season.

The team later suspended operations for the rest of the 2024 season following week 2 of the season. While the team announced that they had plans to return in 2025, the league ceased operations before it could happen.

===Franchise highlights===

* On Sunday, February 13, 2005, in a week-three home game against the Nashville Kats, quarterback Tony Graziani threw for six touchdowns, one of which came on a third-quarter play from their own five-yard line. Graziani got the snap, tripped over his own fullback&#x27;s foot, and threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to OS Steve Smith off his own knee. The Soul won the game. It appeared on &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot;&#x27;s Top 50 Spectacular Plays.
* On Saturday, April 24, 2004, the Soul were trailing to the New York Dragons by a point with 1.3 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The Soul had the ball at their own two-yard line. Ken Hinsley kicked a field goal from the back of the endzone which just barely made it over the crossbar as the buzzer went off, winning the game for the Soul, 60–58.
* Since its inception, the Philadelphia Soul has been deeply involved in the community. In 2006, The Philadelphia Soul Foundation was formed to further the organization&#x27;s commitment to the Philadelphia area. Former President Bill Clinton joined Soul majority owner Jon Bon Jovi on stage to announce a project that would rehab 15 townhouses in North Philadelphia. Scheduled to open in November 2007, the homes will also be eco-friendly, not only saving money for its new tenants, but improving the environment as well.
* On Saturday, July 12, 2008, the Philadelphia Soul defeated the Cleveland Gladiators 70–35 in the AFL National Conference Title game, earning their first ArenaBowl berth in ArenaBowl XXII.
* On Sunday, July 27, 2008, the Philadelphia Soul defeated the San Jose SaberCats in ArenaBowl XXII, 59–56, capturing their first ArenaBowl championship.
* On August 26, 2016, the Soul defeated the Arizona Rattlers in ArenaBowl XXIX, 56-42, to win their second championship in franchise history after two previous unsuccessful attempts against the Rattlers. Their final regular-season home game and two playoff games were moved to the PPL Center in nearby Allentown, Pennsylvania, as the Wells Fargo Center hosted the Democratic National Convention weeks earlier.
* On Saturday, August 26, 2017, the Soul won their third AFL title by defeating the Tampa Bay Storm in ArenaBowl XXX, 44–40 at Wells Fargo Center, to win back-to back AFL championships.

===Season-by-season records===
==Rivalries==

===Power===
The Soul and Pittsburgh Power were both located in Pennsylvania. The Power began play in 2011, and both the Power and Soul were placed in the now-defunct East Division. As members of the East Division, the Soul and Power met twice a year, with each team hosting one home game. The series was tied 4–4 by the end of the 2014 season. The Power franchise folded in the 2014-15 off season due to poor attendance numbers, and many of the Power&#x27;s key franchise players signed with the Soul when Pittsburgh folded.

===Desperados===
The Dallas Desperados were one of the Soul&#x27;s biggest rivals. This rivalry originally spurred from the rivalry of the NFL&#x27;s Philadelphia Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys, but made its way indoors with the Soul and Desperados battling for Eastern Division titles. The Soul lost the first game in this rivalry 51–47 on February 15, 2004. The all-time series ended tied at 5–5 at the demise of the Desperados franchise.

===Gladiators===
Though originally not as important as the rivalries with the Power and Desperados, the Cleveland Gladiators would soon become the Soul&#x27;s biggest rival. The rivalry started in 2008 when the Gladiators moved from Las Vegas to Cleveland, moving them into the same division as the Soul. In their first meeting, the Gladiators defeated the Soul 63–35. For the 2017 season, the AFL abolished the conferences, and the Soul and Gladiators played four games against one another, with Philadelphia winning all four. The Gladiators announced that they would not play the 2018 or 2019 seasons due to renovations on Quicken Loans Arena that required it to close during the basketball off-season.

===Sharks===
The rivalry between the Soul and the Jacksonville Sharks truly began in 2012, the Sharks&#x27; defending ArenaBowl championship season and just their second year in the league. Philadelphia hosted the defending champions in the American Conference championship, which the Soul ran away with 89–34 to advance to the ArenaBowl. The following season, the Sharks would finish with the highest record in the conference and would host the Soul in the conference championship, which the Soul would win again, this time 75–59.
In the 2015 off season, Soul legends Derrick Ross, Tiger Jones and Jason Holman left the Soul and signed with Jacksonville, and when the Sharks returned to Philadelphia for their third conference championship match up in four seasons, Jacksonville finally overcame the Soul 61–56 to advance to the ArenaBowl. In the 2016 AFL playoffs, the Soul got revenge, defeating the Sharks in the American Conference Championship game, advancing to ArenaBowl XXIX. The Jacksonville Sharks left the AFL for the National Arena League after the 2016 season, ending the Soul-Sharks rivalry.

=== Rattlers ===
Their biggest rival would become the Arizona Rattlers. The two teams faced off in back-to-back ArenaBowls in 2012 and 2013. The Rattlers would win both games. The Soul would finally beat the Rattlers in ArenaBowl XXIX in 2016. Following that season, the Rattlers moved to the Indoor Football League, ending the rivalry.

== Popular culture ==
The Soul logo appeared on a 2008 episode of &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; entitled &quot;Dennis Reynolds: An Erotic Life&quot;. Actress Lisa LoCicero played the role of a &quot;representative&quot; of the team.

Ashton Kutcher&#x27;s character, Colt Bennett, wore a Soul T-shirt in season 1 episode 4 of &quot;The Ranch&quot;.

On a Season 5 punishment of &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot;, Joe Gatto has to shoot his own clothes into the crowd at a Soul game.

==Logo and uniforms==
The Soul logo was a stylized black and light blue &quot;S&quot; with a halo above with wings. Their original home jersey was a dark grey, and the road jersey was white. After experimenting with white and silver helmets during the 2004 Preseason, they adopted a dark grey helmet. In 2008, they introduced a blue alternate jersey, with &quot;PHL&quot; on the chest, and grey pants. The blue jersey was worn throughout the entire 2008 playoffs, including ArenaBowl XXII. However, the blue jerseys were not retained when the Soul returned in 2011. On March 13, 2012, the Soul unveiled a modified version of their blue jerseys to become their new home jerseys and matching white road jerseys, as well as a powder blue helmet for their road uniforms. For 2016 and 2017, they reverted to grey home jerseys. Prior to the start of the 2019 season, the AFL partnered with Phenom Elite to provide uniforms for the league. Their jerseys would be blue with an enlarged black logo across the chest and back. The original logo was a Music note with a white football inside.

== History ==

The area of present-day Morioka has been continuously inhabited since the Japanese Paleolithic period. Numerous Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun period tombs and remains have been found. The Emishi inhabited the area into the Heian period. During the Enryaku era of the Heian period, Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, was ordered north to Shiwa Castle in 803 AD, as a military center to extend the domination of the imperial dynasty over Mutsu Province. The area was later ruled by the Abe clan until their destruction during the Former Nine Years War at the hands of the Minamoto and Kiyohara clans. The Kiyohara were in turn defeated in the Gosannen War and the area came under the control of the Ōshū Fujiwara Clan based in Hiraizumi, to the south of Morioka. After the Ōshū Fujiwara were destroyed by Minamoto no Yoritomo at the start of the Kamakura period, the area was disputed by several samurai clans until the Nanbu clan, based in Sannohe to the north, expanded their territory during the Sengoku period and built Kozukata Castle in 1592.

Following the Battle of Sekigahara and the formal recognition of Morioka Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate, Kozukata Castle was renamed Morioka Castle. Its name was changed from to (both read as &quot;Morioka&quot;) During the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, Morioka Domain was a key member of the pro-Tokugawa &quot;Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei.&quot;

After the start of the Meiji period, the former Morioka Domain became Morioka Prefecture in 1870, and part of Iwate Prefecture from 1872. With the establishment of the modern municipality system on April 1, 1889, the city of Morioka was established as the capital of Iwate Prefecture. The city was connected by train to Tokyo in 1890. The city emerged from World War II with very little damage, having been subject to only two minor air raids during the war.

On January 10, 2006, the village of Tamayama was merged into Morioka. Morioka was proclaimed a core city in 2008, with increased local autonomy.

* Mitsuishi Jinja is a Shinto shrine which has three large rocks on the grounds with shackles around them to represent the story of &#x27;Oni no tegata&#x27;, which is a legend explaining the origin of the name of Iwate prefecture. According to the legend, there was once an &quot;Oni&quot; or demon who often tormented and harassed the local people. When the people prayed to the spirit of Mitsuishi for protection, the demon was immediately shackled to the rocks and made to promise never to trouble the people again. As a sign of this promise, the demon left a handprint on one of the rocks, thus giving rise to the name Iwate, literally meaning &quot;rock hand&quot;.

<text>is a city located in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 51,150, and a population density of 41 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Miyako is located in central Iwate Prefecture, bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east, with the main urban area fronting on Miyako Bay. It is located at the northern end of the rias coastal area of the Sanriku Coast, east of the prefectural capital of Morioka. The city area is the largest in Iwate Prefecture and the second largest in the Tōhoku region (after Tsuruoka, Yamagata). However, around 90% of the city area is covered by mountains and forest, so the habitable area is only about 9% of the total area, and therefore although the population density per total area is low, but the population density per habitable area exceeds the prefecture average. Miyako is connected to Morioka by an east–west train line and highway and the coastal highway also goes through the town. The city has a small port but much of the shipping traffic is taken by larger cities along the coast. Parts of the coastal area of the city are within the borders of the Sanriku Fukkō National Park, and part of the mountainous interior is within Hayachine Quasi-National Park. The easternmost point of Honshu island is at in Miyako.

Miyako straddles between a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) and a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;), characterized by warm summers and cold winters. The average annual temperature in Miyako is 10.9 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1282 mm with September as the wettest month and February as the driest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.1 °C, and lowest in January, at around 0.5 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Miyako peaked in around the year 1960 and has declined steadily over the past 60 years.

==History==
The area of present-day Miyako was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period. The area was inhabited by the Emishi people, and came under the control of the imperial dynasty during the early Heian period with the construction a fortified settlement on the coast. During the Muromachi period, the area came under the control of the Nambu clan, and was the main seaport for Morioka Domain during the Edo period under the Tokugawa shogunate. 

On 27 January 1700, the coast of Miyako was hit by a tsunami that was a product of the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, destroying 20 homes. The record from Miyako helped provide an exact date for the earthquake.

During the Boshin War of the Meiji restoration, the Battle of Miyako Bay was one of the major naval engagements of the war.

Under the Meiji period establishment of the modern municipalities system, the towns of Miyako and Kuwagasaki were established within Higashihei District. The area was devastated by a tsunami in 1896, which killed 1,859 inhabitants. Higashihei District became part of Shimohei District on 1 April 1897. Miyako and Kuwagasaki merged on 1 April 1924. On 3 March 1933, much of the town was destroyed by the 1933 Sanriku earthquake, which killed 911 people and destroyed over 98% of the buildings in the town. Miyako attained city status on 20 June 1940.

On 6 June 2005, Miyako absorbed the town of Tarō, and village of Niisato, more than doubling the old city&#x27;s size. On 1 January 2010, Miyako absorbed the village of Kawai (also from Shimohei District). 

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami ===
On 11 March 2011, Miyako was devastated by a tsunami caused by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. Only about 30–60 boats survived from the town&#x27;s 960 ship fishing fleet. A subsequent field study by the University of Tokyo&#x27;s Earthquake Research Institute revealed that the waters had reached at least above sea level, almost equaling the record of the tsunami created by the 1896 Sanriku earthquake. The final reported death toll from the disaster was 420 confirmed dead, 92 missing, and 4,005 buildings destroyed.

Some of the most iconic footage of the tsunami, repeatedly broadcast worldwide, was shot in Miyako. It shows a dark black wave cresting and overflowing a floodwall and tossing cars, followed by a fishing ship capsizing as it hit the submerged floodwall and then crushed as it was forced beneath a bridge.

==Government==

Miyako has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 28 members. Miyako, together with the town of Iwaizumi and the villages of Fudai, Tanohata, and Yamada, collectively contributes three seats to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the village is part of Iwate 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The local economy of Miyako is based heavily on commercial fishing and food processing.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Ōfunato peaked around the year 1980, and has declined over the past 40 years.

==History==
The area of present-day Ōfunato was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period, and numerous shell middens around Ōfunato Bay have been excavated by archaeologists. During the Sengoku period, the area was dominated by various samurai clans before coming under the control of the Date clan during the Edo period, who ruled Sendai Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate.

The village of Ōfunato was created within Kessen District, Iwate on 1 April 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. The 1896 Sanriku earthquake caused a 25-meter tsunami which killed 27,000 people in the area. Ōfunato was elevated to town status on 1 April 1932. The 1933 Sanriku earthquake had a magnitude of 8.4 and caused a 28-meter tsunami which killed 1522 people.

The neighboring town of Sakari and the villages of Akasaki, Takkon, Massaki, Ikawa and Hikoroichi merged with Ōfunato on 1 April 1952, forming the city of Ōfunato. The city became internationally famous when it was hit by a tsunami caused by the Valdivia earthquake in Chile 22 May 1960. On 15 November 2001, the town of Sanriku (from Kesen District) was merged into Ōfunato.

=== 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami ===

Ōfunato hit the headlines again when it was heavily damaged in the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The wave was estimated to have reached 23.6 meters in height. Funneled in by the narrow bay, the tsunami continued inland for 3 kilometres. Ofunato&#x27;s theatre - which had remarkably sustained no damage - was one of the few buildings still standing, and gave shelter to about 250 survivors. Provisional counts listed 3,498 houses out of 15,138 houses in the town destroyed by the tsunami and 305 lives were confirmed lost. At least six of the town&#x27;s 58 designated evacuation sites were inundated by the tsunami. The impact of the earthquake and tsunami on Ōfunato, as well as the rescue efforts in its aftermath, was featured extensively in the British documentary &quot;Japan&#x27;s Tsunami Caught on Camera&quot; which was broadcast on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom.

==Government==
Ōfunato has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 25 members. Ōfunato contributes one seat to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Iwate 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The local economy is largely based on commercial fishing, with cement production and wood processing as secondary industries.
