<text>Teleostei (; Greek &quot;teleios&quot; &quot;complete&quot; + &quot;osteon&quot; &quot;bone&quot;), members of which are known as teleosts (), is, by far, the largest group of ray-finned fishes (class Actinopterygii), with 96% of all extant species of fish. The Teleostei, which is variously considered a division or an infraclass in different taxonomic systems, include over 26,000 species that are arranged in about 40 orders and 448 families. Teleosts range from giant oarfish measuring or more, and ocean sunfish weighing over , to the minute male anglerfish &quot;Photocorynus spiniceps&quot;, just long. Including not only torpedo-shaped fish built for speed, teleosts can be flattened vertically or horizontally, be elongated cylinders or take specialised shapes as in anglerfish and seahorses.

The difference between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications in the jaw musculature which make it possible for them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.

Teleosts have adopted a range of reproductive strategies. Most use external fertilisation: the female lays a batch of eggs, the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement. A fair proportion of teleosts are sequential hermaphrodites, starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage, with a few species reversing this process. A small percentage of teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental care with typically the male fish guarding a nest and fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated.

Teleosts are economically important to humans, as is shown by their depiction in art over the centuries. The fishing industry harvests them for food, and anglers attempt to capture them for sport. Some species are farmed commercially, and this method of production is likely to be increasingly important in the future. Others are kept in aquariums or used in research, especially in the fields of genetics and developmental biology.

== Anatomy ==

Distinguishing features of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches at the end of the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium (braincase); it plays a role in protruding the mouth and creating a circular opening. This lowers the pressure inside the mouth, sucking the prey inside. The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close the mouth, and the fish is able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the mouth. In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower jaw forward. To open the mouth, an adductor muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the lower jaw forward. In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla.

The pharyngeal jaws of teleosts, a second set of jaws contained within the throat, are composed of five branchial arches, loops of bone which support the gills. The first three arches include a single basibranchial surrounded by two hypobranchials, ceratobranchials, epibranchials and pharyngobranchials. The median basibranchial is covered by a toothplate. The fourth arch is composed of pairs of ceratobranchials and epibranchials, and sometimes additionally, some pharyngobranchials and a basibranchial. The base of the lower pharyngeal jaws is formed by the fifth ceratobranchials while the second, third and fourth pharyngobranchials create the base of the upper. In the more basal teleosts the pharyngeal jaws consist of well-separated thin parts that attach to the neurocranium, pectoral girdle, and hyoid bar. Their function is limited to merely transporting food, and they rely mostly on lower pharyngeal jaw activity. In more derived teleosts the jaws are more powerful, with left and right ceratobranchials fusing to become one lower jaw; the pharyngobranchials fuse to create a large upper jaw that articulates with the neurocranium. They have also developed a muscle that allows the pharyngeal jaws to have a role in grinding food in addition to transporting it.

The caudal fin is homocercal, meaning the upper and lower lobes are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, the base of the caudal fin, distinguishing this group from those in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the caudal fin, such as most fish from the Paleozoic (541 to 252 million years ago). The neural arches are elongated to form uroneurals which provide support for this upper lobe.

Teleosts tend to be quicker and more flexible than more basal bony fishes. Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness. While teleost bones are well calcified, they are constructed from a scaffolding of struts, rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean fish. In addition, the lower jaw of the teleost is reduced to just three bones; the dentary, the angular bone and the articular bone. The genital and urinary tracts end behind the anus in the genital papilla; this is observed to sex teleosts.

== Evolution and phylogeny ==

=== External relationships ===

The teleosts were first recognised as a distinct group by the German ichthyologist Johannes Peter Müller in 1845. The name is from Greek &quot;teleios&quot;, &quot;complete&quot; + &quot;osteon&quot;, &quot;bone&quot;. Müller based this classification on certain soft tissue characteristics, which would prove to be problematic, as it did not take into account the distinguishing features of fossil teleosts. In 1966, Greenwood et al. provided a more solid classification. The oldest fossils of teleosteomorphs (the stem group from which teleosts later evolved) date back to the Triassic period (&quot;Prohalecites&quot;, &quot;Pholidophorus&quot;). However, it has been suggested that teleosts probably first evolved already during the Paleozoic era. During the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras they diversified widely, and as a result, 96% of all living fish species are teleosts.

The cladogram below shows the evolutionary relationships of the teleosts to other extant clades of bony fish, and to the four-limbed vertebrates (tetrapods) that evolved from a related group of bony fish during the Devonian period. Approximate divergence dates (in millions of years, mya) are from Near et al., 2012.

=== Internal relationships ===

The phylogeny of the teleosts has been subject to long debate, without consensus on either their phylogeny or the timing of the emergence of the major groups before the application of modern DNA-based cladistic analysis. Near et al. (2012) explored the phylogeny and divergence times of every major lineage, analysing the DNA sequences of 9 unlinked genes in 232 species. They obtained well-resolved phylogenies with strong support for the nodes (so, the pattern of branching shown is likely to be correct). They calibrated (set actual values for) branching times in this tree from 36 reliable measurements of absolute time from the fossil record. The teleosts are divided into the major clades shown on the cladogram, with dates, following Near et al. More recent research divide the teleosts into two major groups: Eloposteoglossocephala (Elopomorpha + Osteoglossomorpha) and Clupeocephala (the rest of the teleosts).

The most diverse group of teleost fish today are the Percomorpha, which include, among others, the tuna, seahorses, gobies, cichlids, flatfish, wrasse, perches, anglerfish, and pufferfish. Teleosts, and percomorphs in particular, thrived during the Cenozoic era. Fossil evidence shows that there was a major increase in size and abundance of teleosts immediately after the mass extinction event at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary ca. 66 mya.

=== Evolutionary trends ===

The first fossils assignable to this diverse group appear in the Early Triassic, after which teleosts accumulated novel body shapes predominantly gradually for the first 150 million years of their evolution (Early Triassic through early Cretaceous).

The most basal of the living teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, specialised for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in the roof of the mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consists of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, includes species that have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.

The majority of teleost species belong to the clade Euteleostei, which consists of 17,419 species classified in 2,935 genera and 346 families. Shared traits of the euteleosts include similarities in the embryonic development of the bony or cartilaginous structures located between the head and dorsal fin (supraneural bones), an outgrowth on the stegural bone (a bone located near the neural arches of the tail), and caudal median cartilages located between hypurals of the caudal base. The majority of euteleosts are in the clade Neoteleostei. A derived trait of neoteleosts is a muscle that controls the pharyngeal jaws, giving them a role in grinding food. Within neoteleosts, members of the Acanthopterygii have a spiny dorsal fin which is in front of the soft-rayed dorsal fin. This fin helps provide thrust in locomotion and may also play a role in defense. Acanthomorphs have developed spiny ctenoid scales (as opposed to the cycloid scales of other groups), tooth-bearing premaxilla and greater adaptations to high speed swimming.

The adipose fin, which is present in over 6,000 teleost species, is often thought to have evolved once in the lineage and to have been lost multiple times due to its limited function. A 2014 study challenges this idea and suggests that the adipose fin is an example of convergent evolution. In Characiformes, the adipose fin develops from an outgrowth after the reduction of the larval fin fold, while in Salmoniformes, the fin appears to be a remnant of the fold.

=== Diversity ===

There are over 26,000 species of teleosts, in about 40 orders and 448 families, making up 96% of all extant species of fish. Approximately 12,000 of the total 26,000 species are found in freshwater habitats. Teleosts are found in almost every aquatic environment and have developed specializations to feed in a variety of ways as carnivores, herbivores, filter feeders and parasites. The longest teleost is the giant oarfish, reported at and more, but this is dwarfed by the extinct &quot;Leedsichthys&quot;, one individual of which has been estimated to have a length of . The heaviest teleost is believed to be the ocean sunfish, with a specimen landed in 2003 having an estimated weight of , while the smallest fully mature adult is the male anglerfish &quot;Photocorynus spiniceps&quot; which can measure just , though the female at is much larger. The stout infantfish is the smallest and lightest adult fish and is in fact the smallest vertebrate in the world; the females measures and the male just .

Open water fish are usually streamlined like torpedoes to minimize turbulence as they move through the water. Reef fish live in a complex, relatively confined underwater landscape and for them, manoeuvrability is more important than speed, and many of them have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. Many have laterally compressed bodies (flattened from side to side) allowing them to fit into fissures and swim through narrow gaps; some use their pectoral fins for locomotion and others undulate their dorsal and anal fins. Some fish have grown dermal (skin) appendages for camouflage; the prickly leather-jacket is almost invisible among the seaweed it resembles and the tasselled scorpionfish invisibly lurks on the seabed ready to ambush prey. Some like the foureye butterflyfish have eyespots to startle or deceive, while others such as lionfish have aposematic coloration to warn that they are toxic or have venomous spines.

Flatfish are demersal fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show a greater degree of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating to the other side of the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.

Some teleosts are parasites. Remoras have their front dorsal fins modified into large suckers with which they cling onto a host animal such as a whale, sea turtle, shark or ray, but this is probably a commensal rather than parasitic arrangement because both remora and host benefit from the removal of ectoparasites and loose flakes of skin. More harmful are the catfish that enter the gill chambers of fish and feed on their blood and tissues. The snubnosed eel, though usually a scavenger, sometimes bores into the flesh of a fish, and has been found inside the heart of a shortfin mako shark.

Some species, such as electric eels, can produce powerful electric currents, strong enough to stun prey. Other fish, such as knifefish, generate and sense weak electric fields to detect their prey; they swim with straight backs to avoid distorting their electric fields. These currents are produced by modified muscle or nerve cells.

== Distribution ==

Teleosts are found worldwide and in most aquatic environments, including warm and cold seas, flowing and still freshwater, and even, in the case of the desert pupfish, isolated and sometimes hot and saline bodies of water in deserts. Teleost diversity becomes low at extremely high latitudes; at Franz Josef Land, up to 82°N, ice cover and water temperatures below for a large part of the year limit the number of species; 75 percent of the species found there are endemic to the Arctic.

Of the major groups of teleosts, the Elopomorpha, Clupeomorpha and Percomorpha (perches, tunas and many others) all have a worldwide distribution and are mainly marine; the Ostariophysi and Osteoglossomorpha are worldwide but mainly freshwater, the latter mainly in the tropics; the Atherinomorpha (guppies, etc.) have a worldwide distribution, both fresh and salt, but are surface-dwellers. In contrast, the Esociformes (pikes) are limited to freshwater in the Northern Hemisphere, while the Salmoniformes (salmon, trout) are found in both Northern and Southern temperate zones in freshwater, some species migrating to and from the sea. The Paracanthopterygii (cods, etc.) are Northern Hemisphere fish, with both salt and freshwater species.

Some teleosts are migratory; certain freshwater species move within river systems on an annual basis; other species are anadromous, spending their lives at sea and moving inland to spawn, salmon and striped bass being examples. Others, exemplified by the eel, are catadromous, doing the reverse. The fresh water European eel migrates across the Atlantic Ocean as an adult to breed in floating seaweed in the Sargasso Sea. The adults spawn here and then die, but the developing young are swept by the Gulf Stream towards Europe. By the time they arrive, they are small fish and enter estuaries and ascend rivers, overcoming obstacles in their path to reach the streams and ponds where they spend their adult lives.

Teleosts including the brown trout and the scaly osman are found in mountain lakes in Kashmir at altitudes as high as . Teleosts are found at extreme depths in the oceans; the hadal snailfish has been seen at a depth of , and a related (unnamed) species has been seen at .

== Physiology ==

=== Respiration ===

The major means of respiration in teleosts, as in most other fish, is the transfer of gases over the surface of the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the swim bladder, which contains a small amount of air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish&#x27;s life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as stagnant water or wet mud; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats.

Several genera of teleosts have independently developed air-breathing capabilities, and some have become amphibious. Some combtooth blennies emerge to feed on land, and freshwater eels are able to absorb oxygen through damp skin. Mudskippers can remain out of water for considerable periods, exchanging gases through skin and mucous membranes in the mouth and pharynx. Swamp eels have similar well-vascularised mouth-linings, and can remain out of water for days and go into a resting state (aestivation) in mud. The anabantoids have developed an accessory breathing structure known as the labyrinth organ on the first gill arch and this is used for respiration in air, and airbreathing catfish have a similar suprabranchial organ. Certain other catfish, such as the Loricariidae, are able to respire through air held in their digestive tracts.

=== Sensory systems ===

Teleosts possess highly developed sensory organs. Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision at least as good as a normal human&#x27;s. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of taste and smell. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using the lateral line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map.

=== Osmoregulation ===

The skin of a teleost is largely impermeable to water, and the main interface between the fish&#x27;s body and its surroundings is the gills. In freshwater, teleost fish gain water across their gills by osmosis, while in seawater they lose it. Similarly, salts diffuse outwards across the gills in freshwater and inwards in salt water. The European flounder spends most of its life in the sea but often migrates into estuaries and rivers. In the sea in one hour, it can gain Na+ ions equivalent to forty percent of its total free sodium content, with 75 percent of this entering through the gills and the remainder through drinking. By contrast, in rivers there is an exchange of just two percent of the body Na+ content per hour. As well as being able to selectively limit salt and water exchanged by diffusion, there is an active mechanism across the gills for the elimination of salt in sea water and its uptake in fresh water.

=== Thermoregulation ===

Fish are cold-blooded, and in general their body temperature is the same as that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin, and regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.

Teleost species that inhabit colder waters have a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in brain cell membranes compared to fish from warmer waters, which allows them to maintain appropriate membrane fluidity in the environments in which they live. When cold acclimated, teleost fish show physiological changes in skeletal muscle that include increased mitochondrial and capillary density. This reduces diffusion distances and aids in the production of aerobic ATP, which helps to compensate for the drop in metabolic rate associated with colder temperatures.

Tuna and other fast-swimming ocean-going fish maintain their muscles at higher temperatures than their environment for efficient locomotion. Tuna achieve muscle temperatures or even higher above the surroundings by having a counterflow system in which the metabolic heat produced by the muscles and present in the venous blood, pre-warms the arterial blood before it reaches the muscles. Other adaptations of tuna for speed include a streamlined, spindle-shaped body, fins designed to reduce drag, and muscles with a raised myoglobin content, which gives these a reddish colour and makes for a more efficient use of oxygen. In polar regions and in the deep ocean, where the temperature is a few degrees above freezing point, some large fish, such as the swordfish, marlin and tuna, have a heating mechanism which raises the temperature of the brain and eye, allowing them significantly better vision than their cold-blooded prey.

=== Buoyancy ===

The body of a teleost is denser than water, so fish must compensate for the difference, or they will sink. A defining feature of Actinopteri (Chondrostei, Holostei and teleosts) is the swim bladder. Originally present in the last common ancestor of the teleosts, it has since been lost independently at least 30–32 times in at least 79 of 425 families of teleosts where the swim bladder is absent in one or more species. This absence is often the case in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. The swim bladder helps fish adjusting their buoyancy through manipulation of gases, which allows them to stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open (physostomous) to the esophagus. In fish where the swim bladder is closed (physoclistous), the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder and the blood.

=== Locomotion ===

A typical teleost fish has a streamlined body for rapid swimming, and locomotion is generally provided by a lateral undulation of the hindmost part of the trunk and the tail, propelling the fish through the water. There are many exceptions to this method of locomotion, especially where speed is not the main objective; among rocks and on coral reefs, slow swimming with great manoeuvrability may be a desirable attribute. Eels locomote by wiggling their entire bodies. Living among seagrasses and algae, the seahorse adopts an upright posture and moves by fluttering its pectoral fins, and the closely related pipefish moves by rippling its elongated dorsal fin. Gobies &quot;hop&quot; along the substrate, propping themselves up and propelling themselves with their pectoral fins. Mudskippers move in much the same way on terrestrial ground. In some species, a pelvic sucker allows them to climb, and the Hawaiian freshwater goby climbs waterfalls while migrating. Gurnards have three pairs of free rays on their pectoral fins which have a sensory function but on which they can walk along the substrate. Flying fish launch themselves into the air and can glide on their enlarged pectoral fins for hundreds of metres.

=== Sound production ===

The ability to produce sound for communication appears to have evolved independently in several teleost lineages. Sounds are produced either by stridulation or by vibrating the swim bladder. In the Sciaenidae, the muscles that attach to the swim bladder cause it to oscillate rapidly, creating drumming sounds. Marine catfishes, sea horses and grunts stridulate by rubbing together skeletal parts, teeth or spines. In these fish, the swim bladder may act as a resonator. Stridulation sounds are predominantly from 1000–4000 Hz, though sounds modified by the swim bladder have frequencies lower than 1000 Hz.

== Reproduction and lifecycle ==

Most teleost species are oviparous, having external fertilisation with both eggs and sperm being released into the water for fertilisation. Internal fertilisation occurs in 500 to 600 species of teleosts but is more typical for Chondrichthyes and many tetrapods. This involves the male inseminating the female with an intromittent organ. Fewer than one in a million of externally fertilised eggs survives to develop into a mature fish, but there is a much better chance of survival among the offspring of members of about a dozen families which are viviparous. In these, the eggs are fertilised internally and retained in the female during development. Some of these species, like the live-bearing aquarium fish in the family Poeciliidae, are ovoviviparous; each egg has a yolk sac which nourishes the developing embryo, and when this is exhausted, the egg hatches and the larva is expelled into the water column. Other species, like the splitfins in the family Goodeidae, are fully viviparous, with the developing embryo nurtured from the maternal blood supply via a placenta-like structure that develops in the uterus. Oophagy is practised by a few species, such as &quot;Nomorhamphus ebrardtii&quot;; the mother lays unfertilised eggs on which the developing larvae feed in the uterus, and intrauterine cannibalism has been reported in some halfbeaks.

There are two major reproductive strategies of teleosts; semelparity and iteroparity. In the former, an individual breeds once after reaching maturity and then dies. This is because the physiological changes that come with reproduction eventually lead to death. Salmon of the genus &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot; are well known for this feature; they hatch in fresh water and then migrate to the sea for up to four years before travelling back to their place of birth where they spawn and die. Semelparity is also known to occur in some eels and smelts. The majority of teleost species have iteroparity, where mature individuals can breed multiple times during their lives.

=== Sex identity and determination ===

88 percent of teleost species are gonochoristic, having individuals that remain either male or female throughout their adult lives. The sex of an individual can be determined genetically as in birds and mammals, or environmentally as in reptiles. In some teleosts, both genetics and the environment play a role in determining sex. For species whose sex is determined by genetics, it can come in three forms. In monofactorial sex determination, a single-locus determines sex inheritance. Both the XY sex-determination system and ZW sex-determination system exist in teleost species. Some species, such as the southern platyfish, have both systems and a male can be determined by XY or ZZ depending on the population.

Multifactorial sex determination occurs in numerous Neotropical species and involves both XY and ZW systems. Multifactorial systems involve rearrangements of sex chromosomes and autosomes. For example, the darter characine has a ZW multifactorial system where the female is determined by ZW1W2 and the male by ZZ. The wolf fish has a XY multifactorial system where females are determined by X1X1X2X2 and the male by X1X2Y. Some teleosts, such as zebrafish, have a polyfactorial system, where there are several genes which play a role in determining sex. Environment-dependent sex determination has been documented in at least 70 species of teleost. Temperature is the main factor, but pH levels, growth rate, density and social environment may also play a role. For the Atlantic silverside, spawning in colder waters creates more females, while warmer waters create more males.

==== Hermaphroditism ====

Some teleost species are hermaphroditic, which can come in two forms: simultaneous and sequential. In the former, both spermatozoa and eggs are present in the gonads. Simultaneous hermaphroditism typically occurs in species that live in the ocean depths, where potential mates are sparsely dispersed. Self-fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species, &quot;Kryptolebias marmoratus&quot; and &quot;Kryptolebias hermaphroditus&quot;. With sequential hermaphroditism, individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life. Species with this condition include parrotfish, wrasses, sea basses, flatheads, sea breams and lightfishes.

Protandry is when an individual starts out male and becomes female while the reverse condition is known as protogyny, the latter being more common. Changing sex can occur in various contexts. In the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, where males have harems of up to ten females, if the male is removed the largest and most dominant female develops male-like behaviour and eventually testes. If she is removed, the next ranking female takes her place. In the species &quot;Anthias squamipinnis&quot;, where individuals gather into large groups and females greatly outnumber males, if a certain number of males are removed from a group, the same number of females change sex and replace them. In clownfish, individuals live in groups and only the two largest in a group breed: the largest female and the largest male. If the female dies, the male switches sexes and the next largest male takes his place.

In deep-sea anglerfish (sub-order Ceratioidei), the much smaller male becomes permanently attached to the female and degenerates into a sperm-producing attachment. The female and their attached male become a &quot;semi-hermaphroditic unit&quot;.

===Mating tactics===

There are several different mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where both males and females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, Guppies, Nassau groupers, humbug damselfish, cichlids and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms. Polyandry consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish, where some females have more than one male attached to them. Polygyny, where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in Sculpins, sunfish, darters, damselfish and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as damselfishes, wrasses, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and tilefishes.

Lek breeding, where males congregate to display to females, has been recorded in at least one species &quot;Cyrtocara eucinostomus&quot;. Lek-like breeding systems have also been recorded in several other species. In monogamous species, males and females may form pair bonds and breed exclusively with their partners. This occurs in North American freshwater catfishes, many butterflyfishes, sea horses and several other species. Courtship in teleosts plays a role in species recognition, strengthening pair bonds, spawning site position and gamete release synchronisation. This includes colour changes, sound production and visual displays (fin erection, rapid swimming, breaching), which is often done by the male. Courtship may be done by a female to overcome a territorial male that would otherwise drive her away.

Sexual dimorphism exists in some species. Individuals of one sex, usually males develop secondary sexual characteristics that increase their chances of reproductive success. In dolphinfish, males have larger and blunter heads than females. In several minnow species, males develop swollen heads and small bumps known as breeding tubercles during the breeding season. The male green humphead parrotfish has a more well-developed forehead with an &quot;ossified ridge&quot; which plays a role in ritualised headbutting. Dimorphism can also take the form of differences in coloration. Again, it is usually the males that are brightly coloured; in killifishes, rainbowfishes and wrasses the colours are permanent while in species like minnows, sticklebacks, darters and sunfishes, the colour changes with seasons. Such coloration can be very conspicuous to predators, showing that the drive to reproduce can be stronger than that to avoid predation.

Males that have been unable to court a female successfully may try to achieve reproductive success in other ways. In sunfish species, like the bluegill, larger, older males known as parental males, which have successfully courted a female, construct nests for the eggs they fertilise. Smaller satellite males mimic female behaviour and coloration to access a nest and fertilise the eggs. Other males, known as sneaker males, lurk nearby and then quickly dash to the nest, fertilising on the run. These males are smaller than satellite males. Sneaker males also exist in &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot; salmon, where small males that were unable to establish a position near a female dash in while the large dominant male is spawning with the female.

===Spawning sites and parental care===

Teleosts may spawn in the water column or, more commonly, on the substrate. Water column spawners are mostly limited to coral reefs; the fish will rush towards the surface and release their gametes. This appears to protect the eggs from some predators and allow them to disperse widely via currents. They receive no parental care. Water column spawners are more likely than substrate spawners to spawn in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows. Some eggs can stick to various surfaces like rocks, plants, wood or shells.

Of the oviparous teleosts, most (79 percent) do not provide parental care. Male care is far more common than female care. Male territoriality &quot;preadapts&quot; a species to evolve male parental care. One unusual example of female parental care is in discuses, which provide nutrients for their developing young in the form of mucus. Some teleost species have their eggs or young attached to or carried in their bodies. For sea catfishes, cardinalfishes, jawfishes and some others, the egg may be incubated or carried in the mouth, a practice known as mouthbrooding. In some African cichlids, the eggs may be fertilised there. In species like the banded acara, young are brooded after they hatch and this may be done by both parents. The timing of the release of young varies between species; some mouthbrooders release new-hatched young while other may keep then until they are juveniles. In addition to mouthbrooding, some teleost have also developed structures to carry young. Male nurseryfish have a bony hook on their foreheads to carry fertilised eggs; they remain on the hook until they hatch. For seahorses, the male has a brooding pouch where the female deposits the fertilised eggs and they remain there until they become free-swimming juveniles. Female banjo catfishes have structures on their belly to which the eggs attach.

In some parenting species, young from a previous spawning batch may stay with their parents and help care for the new young. This is known to occur in around 19 species of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika. These helpers take part in cleaning and fanning eggs and larvae, cleaning the breeding hole and protecting the territory. They have reduced growth rate but gain protection from predators. Brood parasitism also exists among teleosts; minnows may spawn in sunfish nests as well as nests of other minnow species. The cuckoo catfish is known for laying eggs on the substrate as mouthbrooding cichclids collect theirs and the young catfish will eat the cichlid larvae. Filial cannibalism occurs in some teleost families and may have evolved to combat starvation.

=== Growth and development ===

Teleosts have four major life stages: the egg, the larva, the juvenile and the adult. Species may begin life in a pelagic environment or a demersal environment (near the seabed). Most marine teleosts have pelagic eggs, which are light, transparent and buoyant with thin envelopes. Pelagic eggs rely on the ocean currents to disperse and receive no parental care. When they hatch, the larvae are planktonic and unable to swim. They have a yolk sac attached to them which provides nutrients. Most freshwater species produce demersal eggs which are thick, pigmented, relatively heavy and able to stick to substrates. Parental care is much more common among freshwater fish. Unlike their pelagic counterparts, demersal larvae are able to swim and feed as soon as they hatch. Larval teleosts often look very different from adults, particularly in marine species. Some larvae were even considered different species from the adults. Larvae have high mortality rates, most die from starvation or predation within their first week. As they grow, survival rates increase and there is greater physiological tolerance and sensitivity, ecological and behavioural competence.

At the juvenile stage, a teleost looks more like its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish appear to be the longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.

== Shoaling and schooling ==

Many teleosts form shoals, which serve multiple purposes in different species. Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation, offering improved vigilance against predators. It is often more efficient to gather food by working as a group, and individual fish optimise their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal. When a predator has been noticed, prey fish respond defensively, resulting in collective shoal behaviours such as synchronised movements. Responses do not consist only of attempting to hide or flee; antipredator tactics include for example scattering and reassembling. Fish also aggregate in shoals to spawn.

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Economic importance===

Teleosts are economically important in different ways. They are captured for food around the world. A small number of species such as herring, cod, pollock, anchovy, tuna and mackerel provide people with millions of tons of food per year, while many other species are fished in smaller amounts. They provide a large proportion of the fish caught for sport. Commercial and recreational fishing together provide millions of people with employment.

A small number of productive species including carp, salmon, tilapia and catfish are farmed commercially, producing millions of tons of protein-rich food per year. The UN&#x27;s Food and Agriculture Organization expects production to increase sharply so that by 2030, perhaps sixty-two percent of food fish will be farmed.

Fish are consumed fresh, or may be preserved by traditional methods, which include combinations of drying, smoking, and salting, or fermentation. Modern methods of preservation include freezing, freeze-drying, and heat processing (as in canning). Frozen fish products include breaded or battered fillets, fish fingers and fishcakes. Fish meal is used as a food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.

Some smaller and more colourful species serve as aquarium specimens and pets. Sea wolves are used in the leather industry. Isinglass is made from thread fish and drum fish.

=== Impact on stocks ===

Human activities have affected stocks of many species of teleost, through overfishing, pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada&#x27;s indefinite closure of the fishery. Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river pollution has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual&#x27;s gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes (such as spermatogonia) and cells that can make female gametes (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes in the second half of the twentieth century.

The effects of climate change on teleosts could be powerful but are complex. For example, increased winter precipitation (rain and snow) could harm populations of freshwater fish in Norway, whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult fish. In the oceans, teleosts may be able to cope with warming, as it is simply an extension of natural variation in climate. It is uncertain how ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.

=== Other interactions ===

A few teleosts are dangerous. Some, like eeltail catfish (Plotosidae), scorpionfish (Scorpaenidae) or stonefish (Synanceiidae) have venomous spines that can seriously injure or kill humans. Some, like the electric eel and the electric catfish, can give a severe electric shock. Others, such as the piranha and barracuda, have a powerful bite and have sometimes attacked human bathers. Reports indicate that some of the catfish family can be large enough to prey on human bathers.

Medaka and zebrafish are used as research models for studies in genetics and developmental biology. The zebrafish is the most commonly used laboratory vertebrate, offering the advantages of genetic similarity to mammals, small size, simple environmental needs, transparent larvae permitting non-invasive imaging, plentiful offspring, rapid growth, and the ability to absorb mutagens added to their water.

=== In art ===

Teleost fishes have been frequent subjects in art, reflecting their economic importance, for at least 14,000 years. They were commonly worked into patterns in Ancient Egypt, acquiring mythological significance in Ancient Greece and Rome, and from there into Christianity as a religious symbol; artists in China and Japan similarly use fish images symbolically. Teleosts became common in Renaissance art, with still life paintings reaching a peak of popularity in the Netherlands in the 17th century. In the 20th century, different artists such as Klee, Magritte, Matisse and Picasso used representations of teleosts to express radically different themes, from attractive to violent. The zoologist and artist Ernst Haeckel painted teleosts and other animals in his 1904 &quot;Kunstformen der Natur&quot;. Haeckel had become convinced by Goethe and Alexander von Humboldt that by making accurate depictions of unfamiliar natural forms, such as from the deep oceans, he could not only discover &quot;the laws of their origin and evolution but also to press into the secret parts of their beauty by sketching and painting&quot;.

<text>Chondrostei is a subclass of non-neopterygian ray-finned fish. While the term originally referred to the paraphyletic grouping of all non-neopterygian ray-finned fish, it was redefined by Patterson in 1982 to be a clade comprising the Acipenseriformes (which includes sturgeon and paddlefish) and their extinct relatives.

Taxa commonly suggested to represent relatives of the Acipenseriformes include the Triassic marine fish &quot;Birgeria&quot; and the Saurichthyiformes, but their relationship with the Acipenseriformes has been strongly challenged on cladistic grounds. Coccolepididae, a group of small weakly ossified Jurassic and Cretaceous fish found in both marine and freshwater environments, have also been suggested to be close relatives of the Acipenseriformes. However, this has never been subject to cladistic analysis. Near &amp; Thacker (2024) also recovered the ptycholepiform &quot;Boreosomus&quot; as a stem-acipenseriform.

The following taxa are known:

* Subclass Chondrostei
** Genus †&quot;Eochondrosteus&quot;
** Order †Chondrosteiformes
*** Family †Chondrosteidae
** Order Acipenseriformes
*** Family †Peipiaosteidae
*** Suborder Acipenseroidei
**** Family Acipenseridae
**** Family Polyodontidae
* Disputed taxa include:
** Genus †&quot;Birgeria&quot;
** Family †Coccolepididae
** Order †Saurichthyiformes
** Order †Ptycholepiformes

<text>A folding kayak is a direct descendant of the original Inuit kayak made of animal skins stretched over frames made from wood and bones. A modern folder has a collapsible frame made of some combination of wood, aluminium and plastic, and a skin made of a tough fabric with a waterproof coating. Many have integral air chambers inside the hull, making them virtually unsinkable.

==History==

===First models===

The first workable folding kayak was built by Alfred Heurich in 1905, a German architectural student. Heurich paddled his creation on the Isar River near Munich and took out a patent on the design, called the &quot;Delphin&quot; (German: dolphin), the following year. The Delphin had a bamboo frame with a sailcloth hull stretched over it. It could be folded up and carried in three bags, each weighing less than .

The folding kayak was made commercially successful by Johannes Klepper, whose factory was at Rosenheim, Germany. Klepper kayaks were very popular for their compact size and ease of transport. Klepper&#x27;s &quot;Faltboot&quot; was introduced in 1906, many years before hardshell boats were commercially produced. Oskar Speck undertook his seven-year journey from Germany to Australia in the 1930s using folding kayaks made and sponsored by another manufacturer, &quot;Pionier-Faltboot-Werft&quot;.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War the British and Commonwealth special forces employed kayaks in the Mediterranean, European, and South-east Asian theatres. The special forces of the day (COPPS, Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment, etc.) had developed for them about a dozen state of the art kayaks which were given the codename &quot;Cockle&quot;. These Cockles ranged from the Mk 1 early frame-and fabric &#x27;folbot&#x27; type to the four man boats made of aluminum alloy; most were &#x27;collapsible&#x27; rather than being boats that could be completely disassembled, as with modern-day folding boats. The Mk 2 could be collapsed along its 15 ft length to just approximately 7 inches. This Mk 2 and its three-man Mk 2** were all of the same design and were designed by the same man—a Mr Fred Goatley. The Cockle Mk II was used by the RMBPD in Operation Frankton, the attack on Bordeaux in late 1942.
There is plenty of documentation showing delivery of British canoes Mk 3&#x27;s and Mk 6&#x27;s for British Military in Australia and beyond. For the British led Operation Jaywick the British Mark 1 type kayaks were used.

Walter Höhn (English; Hoehn) developed and built the first Swiss folding kayaks, which were tested in white water conditions, in 1924. Hoehn emigrated to Australia in 1928, bringing two examples of his boat designs with him: A 1-man and a 2-man design. His boats were patented (Aust. Patent 117,779) and initially produced for sport use. During the Pacific war, Hoehn and Hedley&#x27;s P.L. built a total of 1024 folding kayaks, called &#x27;folboats&#x27;, for the Australian military from the Hoehn design. Hoehn supplied the first 2 folboats for the highly secret &#x27;Operation Jaywick&#x27; training at Camp-X near Sydney in 1942. Then Hoehn supplied his folboats for Cairns, Fraser Island and Mount Martha training camps. Hoehn&#x27;s first military model designated &#x27;Folboat Kayak Type&#x27; was succeeded by the 3-seater MKIII. The MKIII was successfully used in many raids during the Pacific War.

Hoehn&#x27;s first army folboats were tested at the ZES commando base in Cairns, Queensland by commandos under the direction of Major Ivan Lyon for preparation of the Operation Jaywick raid. They included Capt. Sam Carey, Robert Page and Albert Sargent. They were also used for training and actual use in Operation Rimau. At least 34 raids, reconnaissance patrols and rescue missions in the Pacific Islands, notably RIMAU, COPPER, PYTHON, PLATYPUS and SUNCHARLIE used these folboats.
===Cold War and modern use===
The Klepper &quot;Aerius II&quot; model was introduced in 1951 and is still in production. In 1956, Dr. Hannes Lindemann crossed the Atlantic Ocean in an &quot;Aerius II&quot;, proof of the folding kayak&#x27;s integrity and seaworthiness. Their light weight and non-metallic construction has made them the choice of many military special forces. Nautiraid of France produces a special model for military use, as do Klepper and Long Haul, who supply German and US Special Forces, respectively. The newest design innovation has come from Canada&#x27;s TRAK Kayaks, who in 2007 have come out with a polyurethane skin over aluminum frame design with hydraulics in the cockpit to make the skin extremely taut and also to change the shape of the hull for varying paddling conditions. Armed Forces of Poland use Hermes Sport Company custom equipment.

There are about five major folding kayak manufacturers today, and a handful of small, one-off makers. In addition to Klepper the best-known modern brands have been Feathercraft and Folbot (both of which closed and ended production in 2016 due to slipping sales), also Triton Advanced, Long Haul Folding Kayaks, Nautiraid, Hermes Sport Company (successor to Wayland), Pakboats (who also produce folding canoes that are popular with fly-in wilderness fishing guides and researchers who use them for remote expeditions), Pouch and TRAK. Long Haul double kayak hulls are identical in form to Kleppers (as well as a good many older boats), so a Klepper Aerius II frame can be used with a Long Haul MK-II skin, and vice versa. Several Asian and Eastern European makers have been producing designs similar to those of the Folbot and Feathercraft. .

==Design==

Most folding kayaks have very similar construction, even though the materials may differ. Some boats use frames made of mountain ash, spruce and marine plywood, while others use aluminium tubing and various plastics, and a few newer boats such as Fujita and Firstlight use carbon fiber or glass-reinforced plastic tubing. Typically there are solid bow and stern pieces, and anywhere from three to seven ribs connected via some sort of flexible attachment to a number of longerons. Many boats follow the basic design pioneered by Klepper in having a folding set of floorboards and gunwales as well as additional longerons to add stiffness and shape. Many folding kayaks also use air sponsons (up to four in the Klepper Quattro) to tighten the skin on the frame and to adjust the shape of the hull.

Most folding boats have two-part skins, with different materials used for the deck and the hull. Decks can be made of a breathable cotton/hemp blend, as Klepper has done since their early days, or of coated synthetics, as Feathercraft, Folbot, Long Haul Folding Kayaks, Nautiraid, Hermes Sport Company, Pouch and TRAK do. Each approach has its own particular benefits and drawbacks; all work well in practice, and some companies, such as Long Haul Folding Kayaks, offer both materials. Hulls are generally made of a heavily coated synthetic fiber. In the early days, rubber coated cotton canvas was used, while the modern boats use a synthetic elastomer —Hypalon, polyurethane or PVC—over a synthetic (typically Dacron) cloth. The tension on the hull is what gives certain folding kayaks performance advantages over others. One manufacturer (TRAK) incorporates several hydraulic jacks into the frame that allow the user to change the hull&#x27;s shape.

Assembly time and mechanisms or designs vary by manufacturer and model. Assembly times can be as little as 8–10 minutes or can reach upwards of 40–45 minutes, depending on the design of the kayak and the skill of the assembler. Commando teams can assemble a large Klepper or Long Haul double kayak in around 8 minutes or less. Disassembly is typically half the assembly time.

The Oru Kayak company uses the principles of origami to construct kayaks ranging in length from to using a single sheet of corrugated plastic as both the ribs and skin. The Oru kayak folds into itself to form a carrying case when not in use.

The stability and design robustness of several folding kayak models makes them ideal for upwind and downwind sailing. Dr. Hannes Lindemann&#x27;s Atlantic crossing was in most part achieved by sailing.

==Performance==
Folders are known for their durability, stability, and longevity: The Klepper Aerius I (a single-seater) was used successfully in the early days of white-water kayaking before the era of modern polyethylene boats, owing to its durability and excellent manoeuvrability. Some well-maintained Kleppers have been in use for more than 50 years.

Although a few hardshell kayakers are critical of folding boats, and do not regard them as in the same category as hardshell boats, folding kayaks exhibit many of the same paddling characteristics as the original skin-and-frame vessels of the circumpolar north. Other than contemporary versions of Inuit, Aleut, and Yup&#x27;ik kayaks and baidarkas, they are the closest relatives to the skin-and-frame boats of the past. The performance of these folding kayaks depend largely on the design of the kayak. The speed may be comparable to sea kayaks made from composite materials such as fibreglass or carbon/kevlar. In general, most folding kayaks trade off some performance in speed for the ease of travelling with a kayak. This is because the sponsons found in most modern folding kayaks make the kayaks wider; this increases drag and slows the kayak down.

Though they do tend to be somewhat less efficient in flat water than hardshell kayaks of similar dimensions, folding kayaks and other skin-on-frame boats have characteristics that can aid paddling efficiency in rough water conditions. In a hardshell kayak, waves and chop on the water can slow down the momentum of the craft and push the kayak back. The flexibility of the frame and the &quot;give&quot; of the skin in a folding kayak help the boat absorb the energy of waves and current, allowing the boat to move more easily through confused waves that buffet hardshells and to ride up over waves rather than smashing into their face. Folding kayaks (and canoes) provide a closer feeling of contact with the water and waves than hardshell boats.


Two substantial advantages of folding kayaks are lightness and portability. Most models typically weigh 1/3 to 1/2 less than composite (fiberglass or rotomold) or polyurethane kayaks of similar dimensions. Most models can be packed down small enough when dismantled to be stored in a closet or carried in the boot of a car and can be checked as baggage on most airlines. Even having to pay excess baggage charges for some flights is still more economical than the cost of renting boats at a paddler&#x27;s destination. For example, the 12&#x27; Pakboat Puffin solo folding kayak weighs only 24 pounds with the optional deck. It can be packed in a bag that meets airline dimensions and weight for &quot;standard&quot; baggage with enough room to spare for all the safety gear and clothing needed for paddling.

==Notable owners==

Roger Courtney founder of the Special Boat Service had his own folding kayak called &#x27;Buttercup&#x27;. &quot;It was a two seater sports model he had purchased from Selfridges department store in London for £22&quot;. It was 17 feet long and included a mast and sails. Over six months he navigated it from the Lake Victoria along the River Nile to the Mediterranean Sea. For their honeymoon in 1938 Courtney and his wife paddled Buttercup down the River Danube. His experience and his demonstration of his skills in Buttercup were instrumental in the development of modern canoe warfare and the British military units that would go on to form the SBS. 

The folding kayak that used to belong to pope John Paul II has been on display at the Archdiocesan Museum in Kraków, Poland since 2003. When already a cardinal, the future pope shared the ownership of &quot;The Pebble&quot; with a student friend of his, who later donated it to the museum.

In 1956 the German doctor Hannes Lindemann crossed the Atlantic using a Klepper Aerius II folding kayak, today the kayak is exhibited in the Deutsches Museum.

<text>Scanlation (also scanslation) is the fan-made scanning, translation, and editing of comics from a language into another language. Scanlation is done as an amateur work performed by groups and is nearly always done without express permission from the copyright holder. The word &quot;scanlation&quot; is a portmanteau of the words scan and translation. The term is mainly used for Japanese manga, although it also exists for other languages, such as Korean manhwa and Chinese manhua. Scanlations may be viewed at websites or as sets of image files downloaded via the Internet.

==History==

Frederik Schodt describes having &quot;dreamed of [manga translation] as far back as 1970 or 1971&quot;. Subsequently, Schodt, Jared Cook, Shinji Sakamoto, and Midori Ueda formed a group named Dadakai. Schodt referred to Dadakai as &quot;really the beginning of manga translation&quot;, however described these efforts as &quot;way too early&quot; because they could not get anything published. One of the manga Dadakai licensed was Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s manga titled &quot;Phoenix&quot;, and the translation was later published by Viz Media from 2002 to 2008. The Amateur Press Association (APA) was the first formally organized form of manga scanlation. Their major period of activity occurred during the late 1970s through the early 1990s. Scanlation groups began forming in Europe before the United States, translating into their respective languages, the largest of which was the French.

Parallel to the increasing growth of the Internet in the late 1990s, people increasingly began to translate manga scripts, soon after which groups began editing those translated scripts onto manga scans. Initially scanlations were distributed using mail, CDs, and emails within anime clubs. By 1998, many free hosting services such as Geocities and Angelfire hosted scanlations, and eventually scanlators congregated to form an IRC channel named &quot;#mangascans&quot;. In 2000, organized scanlation groups began to emerge. The majority of scanlation groups seemed to uphold an unspoken agreement between them and manga publishers; that when a series is officially licensed, scanlators are expected to police themselves. For instance, when Viz licensed three of the most popular series that Toriyama&#x27;s World was scanlating, the website took their scanlations offline. To help kickstart the initial publication of &quot;Shounen Jump&quot;, Viz Media partnered with several scanlation groups including Toriyama&#x27;s World to promote the magazine and subsequently received a cut of the revenue through Viz&#x27;s affiliate program.

==Process==
Scanlation is usually done by a group of fans who collaborate through the internet. Many scanlators actively communicate with each other, even with those of other groups, some even belonging to several groups at once; others choose to avoid communication completely. One former scanlator, by the pseudonym Stephen, noted that scanlators often fall into three types of cliques: those who belong to prestigious &#x27;old guard&#x27; groups that have been active for several years, to newer groups that established themselves through hard work, or to fringe groups that attempt to undercut other groups attempting to best them via larger download count. Much stigma exists between the old and new. Stephen stated that Old Guard consider newer groups as &quot;trend- or fame-whores&quot; and thus choose to work on series that have more cultural or artistic significance whereas newer groups consider the Old Guard bitter losers who are no longer popular and tend to work on the more popular titles. Many groups have their own webpage as well as an IRC channel or a Discord server. These platforms are an important part of the community aspect, as they allow for real-time interaction between the group staff and the target audience as well as allowing the groups to recruit new staff.
Much like their earlier predecessors, the anime fansub community, scanlators tend to organize into groups and divide the labor amongst themselves. The first step in scanlation is to obtain the &quot;raws&quot; or the original content in print form, then to scan and send the images to the translator and the cleaner. The translator reads original text from the raws and translates into the desired language of release, then sends the translated text to a proof-reader to check for accuracy. The cleaner removes the original text, corrects blemishes that arose from scanning, adjusts brightness and contrast levels so that the finished product looks like officially published volumes, etc. The process of cleaning may also include the removal of text directly over artwork and results in blank spots interrupting the artwork. Depending on the scanlation group, these spots may be left as is or the artwork will be redrawn (usually performed by the cleaner as well). The typesetter then takes the translated text and places it into the &#x27;cleaned&#x27; raw, making the translated texts fit in the dialogue boxes and selecting appropriate fonts for effect such as emphasis. Finally the translated, typeset manga is sent to the scanlation group&#x27;s quality controller who copyedits the final product before releasing it to the websites that it will be viewed or downloaded from.

Scanlators often use digital photo and illustration editing software such as Adobe Photoshop (or less commonly, Clip Studio Paint) to clean, redraw, and typeset the scanlations. 

Scanlation groups primarily make their releases available through their own sites or shared sites like MangaDex. The vast amount of manga released and multitude of scanlation groups – each with their own individual sites and methods of distribution, sometimes even competing scanlations of the same manga – gave rise to sites such as MangaUpdates that specialize in tracking and linking these releases. Jake T. Forbes, a manga editor and columnist, stated at a Comic-Con 2010 panel that scanlation aggregator sites that offer many different titles all in one place have recently become part of the distribution process.

==Motivations and ethics==
While early official translations of manga focused on localizing the manga to an Anglophone culture, scanlations retained the cultural differences, for example, leaving in forms of address, romanizing sound effects and onomatopoeia instead of translating them, and providing the manga unflipped. This minimalist approach to translation has been referred to as &quot;enculturation&quot;. Sound effects can also be left untranslated in scanlations, creating an evocative Japanese atmosphere. The reader can often infer the meaning of the sound effects from the context or lettering choices.

Fans are often quite unhappy with the translation industry for various reasons. Patrick Macias, a columnist for &quot;The Japan Times Weekly&quot; described fans &quot;addicted to page-turning narratives&quot; as impatient with the &quot;agonizingly&quot; slow pace at which official translations are released. Douglass, Huber and Manovich say that enthusiasm by fans about a particular series, coupled with delays in official translations led to the formation of scanlation groups. Scanlators say that they scanlate to promote the series or the author in their own language, but Hope Donovan suggests that the scanlator&#x27;s goal is more along the lines of &quot;self-promotion&quot;, and argues that it is prestigious for a scanlator to have many fans.

As many titles do not get licensed in most countries, or licensed in any foreign country, scanlation groups allow a much wider audience access to the content. The owner of the now defunct manga-hosting site Ignition-One, Johnathan, stated that &quot;The entire reason I joined the scanlations community is to promote manga that I was interested in and, coincidentally, that no one else would translate.&quot; Also this practice is common for some manga discontinued due to lack of popularity or sales in the target region.

In other cases, scanlation groups are formed to get around perceived or actual censorship in the official translation or in the decision to obtain the series license. &quot;Caterpillar&quot; of former Caterpillar&#x27;s Nest scanlation group, in reference to erotic content that his group released, stated that &quot;I started doing scanlations because I wanted to read certain manga and I knew they didn&#x27;t stand a snowflake&#x27;s chance in hell of ever getting an official English translation.&quot; In the yaoi fandom, commercially published explicit titles are often restricted to readers aged 18 or above, and there is a tendency for booksellers to stock BL, but also insist that more of it is shrink-wrapped and labeled for adult readers. Andrea Wood has suggested that teenage yaoi fans seek out more explicit titles using scanlations.

The quality of commercial offerings is a common complaint. Localization is also a common complaint among supporters of scanlations. Commercial releases often have titles, names, puns, and cultural references changed to make more sense to their target audience. The act of horizontally &#x27;flipping&#x27; the pages of commercial releases has also received criticism from fans of manga. The reason for this change is that manga panels are arranged from right to left, while the panels in Western comics are arranged from left to right. However, due to large-scale fan complaints that this &#x27;flipping&#x27; has changed the finished product from the original (e.g. A flipped manga image will keep the speech translations legible, while any graphics such as the wording on clothes or buildings will be reversed and confusing), this practice has largely diminished.

The cost and speed of commercial releases remains an issue with some fans. Imported comics from the original countries&#x27; markets sometimes cost less than the commercially released version, despite the high cost of shipping. Despite weekly or monthly serialized releases in the country of origin, translated editions often take longer to release due to the necessity of translating and repackaging the product before release.

A more recent phenomenon amongst scanlation readers is the emergence of ereaders. Users may read scanlations on devices such as the Amazon Kindle. Since most scanlations are distributed as a series of images, many e-book readers already have the capability to read scanlations without additional software. Many manga have not been released in a digital format that is compatible with e-book readers, making piracy the only avenue for readers who wish to read on these devices.

==Legal action==

Scanlations are often viewed by fans as the only way to read comics that have not been licensed for release in their area. However, according to international copyright law, such as the Berne Convention, scanlations are illegal.

According to a 2009 study conducted by Lee Hye-Kyung of the University of London with Japanese manga publishers, those publishers generally stated that they considered scanlation &quot;an overseas phenomenon&quot;, and no &quot;coordinated action&quot; had taken place against scanlation. Lee stated that a possible explanation for some of the lack of legal action is that scanlation groups always make sure to buy an original copy of the work and generally stop scanlating should the work become licensed.

Historically, copyright holders have not requested scanlators to stop distribution before a work is licensed in the translated language. Thus, scanlators usually feel it is relatively &#x27;safe&#x27; to scanlate series which have not been commercially released in their country. Steve Kleckner, a former VP of sales for Tokyopop, stated that &quot;Frankly, I find it kind of flattering, not threatening... To be honest, I believe that if the music industry had used downloading and file sharing properly, it would have increased their business, not eaten into it.&quot; However, this view is not necessarily shared among the industry, as some Japanese publishers have threatened scanlation groups with legal action. Since the 1990s, publishers have sent cease and desist letters to various scanlation groups and websites.

Due to manga&#x27;s popularity steadily increasing in the overseas market, copyright holders felt that scanlators were intruding on their sales and in 2010, a group of 36 Japanese publishers and a number of US publishers banded together to form the Manga Multi-national Anti-Piracy Coalition to &quot;combat&quot; illegal scanlations, especially mentioning scanlation aggregator websites. They have threatened to take legal action against at least thirty, unnamed websites. The coalition has achieved some degree of success. The scanlation aggregator site OneManga, ranked 935 in the entire internet in May 2010 according to a Google listing and top 300 in the United States, announced its closure in July 2010 due to their respect towards the displeasure expressed by the publishers, while OneManga officially shut down its online reader in August 2010.

Some scanlations leak before the manga is even published in the Japanese weekly magazines. As of April 2014, the Japanese government was looking into amending copyright law to more effectively target translated scans. A 2014 estimate was that lost revenue from scanlations amounted to &quot;560 billion yen per year in only four major cities in China&quot;.

In 2020, a Haesin Young, a manhwa artist, threatened legal action against a piracy website asking users to stop illegally uploading the manhwa. In 2021, Lezhin said that they are working with law firms to bring legal charges against manga piracy sites, after accusations from several manhwa authors, including manhwa artist YD, that scanlation causes authors to lose money and motivation. Moreover, the Korean government and Interpol initiated a three-year-long cooperative investigation in April, aiming to arrest individuals engaging in illegal distribution of pirated and illegally translated comics, cartoons and novels.

==Reception==
Patrick Macias wrote for &quot;The Japan Times&quot; that there seems to be an unspoken agreement between scanlators and publishers; once a series obtains an English-language license, English-language scanlators are expected to police themselves. Most groups view the act of scanlation as treading upon a &#x27;gray area&#x27; of legality. Johnathan, owner of the now defunct scanlation sharing site Ignition-One, acknowledged that scanlations are illegal no matter what scanlation groups might say; however, unlike the manner in which the advent of the MP3 format marked the age of sharing music that harmed the music industry, he believed that scanlating manga in contrast encouraged domestic publishers to license manga.

Jake T. Forbes, an editor and columnist, criticized the work of scanlation groups in that they in no way are in &quot;legal grey area&quot; and are blatant copyright infringement. He further criticized the community for lacking the right and qualifications to know whether or not scanlation is positive or negative for the industry and the harm it caused, emphasizing the simple truth that the scanlation community is &quot;not&quot; the industry. He describes the current fandom as taking &quot;unfettered&quot; access to copyrighted works &quot;for granted&quot; due to advent of torrents and scanlations.

Jason Thompson, a freelance editor with deep involvement in the manga industry, stated that although manga companies never mention them, they have placed paying increasing amounts of attention towards scanlations as a means of gauging a title&#x27;s popularity and the presence of a fanbase. Some licensing companies, such as Del Rey Manga, Tokyopop, and Viz Media, have used the response to various scanlations as a factor in deciding which manga to license for translation and commercial release. Steve Kleckner, former VP of sales for Tokyopop, stated that &quot;hey, if you get 2,000 fans saying they want a book you&#x27;ve never heard of, well, you gotta go out and get it.&quot; Toren Smith, a translator, feels differently stating that, &quot;I know from talking to many folks in the industry that scanlations DO have a negative effect. Many books that are on the tipping point will never be legally published because of scanlations.&quot;

Johanna Draper Carlson says that some readers of scanlations do not wish to spend money, or that they have limited mobility or funds, or that they are choosy about which series they wish to follow. Carlson feels that the readers of scanlations &quot;do not care&quot; that scanlations are illegal. Forbes describes the cost of keeping up with new manga as &quot;astronomical&quot;, stating that &quot;fans expecting to read any manga they want for free isn&#x27;t reasonable, but neither is it reasonable to expect your audience to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars a year to stay up to date with content that their Japanese kindred spirits can get for a quarter the cost.&quot;

Forbes urged the scanlation community to instead direct their energies toward providing original, creative content as opposed to infringing on copyright laws. He addressed the fandom&#x27;s criticism of the lack of quality in official translations stating that it should manifest as discussion. In regards to bridging the gap between cultures, he mentioned translating what Japanese bloggers have to say. Finally, he addressed the fame-seeking side of the scanlation community by stating that they should try their hand at creating fan art instead of placing their name on an unofficial translation of copyrighted material.

During a panel on digital piracy in Comic-Con 2010, the comic and music critic and writer for Techland, Douglas Wolk, expressed concern in response to the actions of Manga Multi-national Anti-Piracy Coalition stating that he had seen the music industry &quot;destroy&quot; itself by &quot;alienating its most enthusiastic customer base&quot; in attempts to fight piracy. Forbes, also a panelist, agreed, criticizing publishers for this direct retaliation; Forbes stated that publishers were not realizing that consumers wanted a large amount of content so they could browse rather than picking and choosing individual items. Deb Aoki, panelist and manga editor for About.com, stated that this was exactly what scanlation aggregator sites provided consumers. Forbes highlighted that until recently scanlations were not problematic; however, aggregator sites were appearing which made scanlations much more readily accessible and which run like businesses, functioning off of ad revenue while the artist and scanlation groups received nothing.

<text>King Cheng of Zhou (; 1055–1021 BC), personal name Ji Song, was the second king of the Chinese Zhou dynasty. The dates of his reign are 1042–1021 BCE or 1042/35–1006 BCE. Ji Dan, Duke of Zhou served as regent during his minority. His parents were King Wu of Zhou and Queen Yi Jiang.

==Life==
King Cheng was young when he ascended the throne. His uncle the Duke of Zhou, fearing that Shang forces might rise again under the possible weak rule of a young ruler, became the regent and supervised government affairs for several years. Duke of Zhou established the eastern capital at Luoyang and later defeated a rebellion by Cheng&#x27;s uncles the Three Guards Cai Shu, Guan Shu and Huo Shu.

King Cheng later stabilized the Zhou dynasty&#x27;s border by defeating several barbarian tribes along with the Duke of Zhou.

<doc id="326803" wikidata="Q462074" url="?curid=326803" title="Amen break">
<text>The Amen break is a drum break that has been widely sampled in popular music. It comes from the 1969 track &quot;Amen, Brother&quot; by the American soul group the Winstons, released as the B-side of the 1969 single &quot;Color Him Father&quot;. The drum break lasts seven seconds and was performed by Gregory Coleman. 

With the rise of hip-hop in the 1980s, the Amen break was used in hits including &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; by N.W.A and &quot;Keep It Going Now&quot; by Rob Base &amp; DJ E-Z Rock. In the 1990s, it became a staple of drum and bass and jungle music. It has been used in thousands of tracks of various genres, making it one of the most sampled recordings in music history.

The Winstons received no royalties for the sample. The bandleader, Richard Lewis Spencer, was not aware of its use until 1996, after the statute of limitations for copyright infringement had passed. He condemned its use as plagiarism, but later said it was flattering. He said it was unlikely that Coleman, who died homeless and destitute in 2006, realized the impact he had made on music.

== Recording ==

The Winstons were a soul band from Washington, D.C., who played throughout the southern United States. They were led by Richard Lewis Spencer. In early 1969, the Winstons recorded the single &quot;Color Him Father&quot; in Atlanta. For the B-side, they recorded an instrumental based on the gospel song &quot;Amen&quot; and a guitar riff Curtis Mayfield had played for Spencer. The result was &quot;Amen, Brother&quot;, which Spencer said they composed in about 20 minutes. Though &quot;Color Him Father&quot; became a top-10 R&amp;B hit and won a Grammy Award, &quot;Amen, Brother&quot; received little notice. As a mixed-race group, the Winstons struggled to secure bookings and disbanded in 1970.

== Drum break ==

At about 1 minute and 26 seconds into &quot;Amen, Brother&quot;, the other musicians stop playing and the drummer, Gregory Coleman, performs a four-bar drum break that lasts for seven seconds. For two bars, Coleman plays the previous beat. In the third bar, he delays a snare hit. In the fourth bar, he leaves the first beat empty, then plays a syncopated pattern and an early crash cymbal.

The drum break was added to lengthen the track, which had been too short with just the riff. Spencer said he directed the break, but Phil Tolotta, the only other surviving member of the band in 2015, credited it solely to Coleman.

== Sampling ==
In the 1980s, with the rise of hip-hop, DJs began using turntables to loop drum breaks from records, which MCs would rap over. In 1986, &quot;Amen, Brother&quot; was included on &quot;Ultimate Breaks and Beats&quot;, a compilation of old funk and soul tracks with clean drum breaks intended for DJs. Salt-N-Pepa&#x27;s 1986 single &quot;I Desire&quot; has one of the earliest uses of the Amen break. A number of releases in 1988 took it into the mainstream, including &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; by N.W.A and &quot;Keep It Going Now&quot; by Rob Base &amp; DJ E-Z Rock. 

The Amen break has been in used in thousands of tracks, making it one of the most widely sampled tracks in history. It was widely sampled in British dance music in the early 1990s, especially in drum and bass and jungle. It has been used in multiple genres, including rock music by acts such as Oasis, in commercials, and television themes such as &quot;Futurama&quot;.

The Amen break became popular as it was easy to manipulate and offered a simple way to create jungle music. The English drummer Tom Skinner cited the appealing &quot;crunch&quot; of the recording quality. Producers have manipulated it by altering its pitch or speed, or re-ordering its components to mimic ghost notes or other effects.

==Royalties==
The copyright owner of &quot;Amen, Brother&quot;, including the Amen break, was the Winstons bandleader, Richard Lewis Spencer. Neither he nor Coleman received royalties for the break. Spencer was not aware of its use until an executive contacted him asking for the master tape in 1996, when he was working for the Washington Metro. The journalist Simon Reynolds likened the situation to &quot;the man who goes to the sperm bank and unknowingly sires hundreds of children&quot;. Spencer was unable to take legal action, as the statute of limitations for copyright infringement is three years in the US.

Spencer condemned the sampling as plagiarism and said he &quot;felt ripped off and raped&quot;. He said in 2011: &quot;[Coleman&#x27;s] heart and soul went into that drum break. Now these guys copy and paste it and make millions.&quot; However, in 2015, he said: &quot;It&#x27;s not the worst thing that can happen to you. I&#x27;m a black man in America and the fact that someone wants to use something I created – that&#x27;s flattering.&quot;

Coleman died homeless and destitute in 2006. Spencer said it was unlikely he was aware of the impact he had made on music. In 2015, a GoFundMe campaign set up for Spencer by the British DJs Martyn Webster and Steve Theobald raised more than £18,000 ($26,000). Spencer died in 2020.

<doc id="326810" wikidata="Q3288535" url="?curid=326810" title="Funky Drummer">
<text>&quot;Funky Drummer&quot; is a song by James Brown recorded in 1969 and released as a single in 1970. Its drum break, improvised by Clyde Stubblefield, is one of the most frequently sampled music recordings.

== Recording and composition ==
&quot;Funky Drummer&quot; was recorded on November 20, 1969, in Cincinnati, Ohio. It is an extended vamp, with individual instruments (mostly the guitar, tenor saxophones and organ) improvising brief licks on top. Brown&#x27;s ad-libbed vocals are sporadic and declamatory, mostly concerned with encouraging the other band members. The song is played in the key of D minor, though the first verse is in C major.

As in the full-length version of &quot;Cold Sweat&quot;, Brown announces the upcoming drum break, which comes late in the recording, requesting to &quot;give the drummer some.&quot; He tells Stubblefield &quot;You don&#x27;t have to do no soloing, brother, just keep what you got... Don&#x27;t turn it loose, &#x27;cause it&#x27;s a mother.&quot; Stubblefield&#x27;s eight-bar unaccompanied &quot;solo&quot;, a version of the riff he plays through most of the piece, is the result of Brown&#x27;s directions; this break beat is one of the most sampled recordings in music.

After the drum break, the band returns to the original vamp. Brown, apparently impressed with what Stubblefield has produced, seems to name the song on the spot as it continues, and repeats it: &quot;The name of this tune is &#x27;The Funky Drummer&#x27;, &#x27;The Funky Drummer&#x27;, &#x27;The Funky Drummer&#x27;.&quot; The recording ends with a reprise of Stubblefield&#x27;s solo and a fade-out.

==Release==
&quot;Funky Drummer&quot; was originally released by King Records as a two-part 45 rpm single in March 1970. The difference between the album version and the single version is that the single version contains Brown&#x27;s vocal percussion (&#x27;kooncha&#x27;). Despite rising to No. 20 on the R&amp;B chart and No. 51 on the pop chart, it did not receive an album release until the 1986 compilation &quot;In the Jungle Groove&quot;.

More than one mix of &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; was made around the time it was recorded, including one with tambourine and another with vocal percussion by Brown and trombonist Fred Wesley. The most commonly heard version of the track lacks these elements, which were apparently overdubbed. In addition to the original version of &quot;Funky Drummer&quot;, the album &quot;In the Jungle Groove&quot; includes a &quot;bonus beat reprise&quot; of the piece. This track, edited by Danny Krivit, consists of a 3-minute loop of the drum break, punctuated only by Brown&#x27;s sampled vocal interjections and an occasional guitar chord and tambourine hit.

==Sampling==

&quot;Funky Drummer&quot; is one of the most widely sampled pieces of music. In 1986, the tracks &quot;South Bronx&quot;, &quot;Eric B. is President&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Demo&quot; sampled Stubblefield&#x27;s drum break, helping popularize sampling. The drum break was sampled by hip hop acts including Public Enemy, N.W.A, LL Cool J, Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, and the theme music to &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; on Cartoon Network, as well as later pop musicians such as Ed Sheeran and George Michael, notably done in Freedom! &#x27;90.

As Stubblefield did not receive a songwriter credit for &quot;Funky Drummer&quot;, he received no royalties for the sampling. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2011: &quot;It didn&#x27;t bug me or disturb me, but I think it&#x27;s disrespectful not to pay people for what they use.&quot; Stubblefield capitalized on the name with his 1997 album &quot;Revenge of the Funky Drummer&quot;.

<text>The Coquille ( , sometimes spelled Ko-Kwel or Ko&#x27;Kwel) are a Native American people who historically lived in the Coquille River watershed and nearby coast south of Coos Bay. They were signatories of the Oregon Coast Tribes Treaty of 1855 and were subsequently removed to the Siletz Reservation in northwestern Oregon in 1856. Most Coquille people today live there as members of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, but some whose ancestors remained in the traditional homeland or fled the reservation now make up the Coquille Indian Tribe, centered in southwest Oregon where the Coos River flows into Coos Bay.

==Name==
According to the Coquille Indian Tribe&#x27;s website, the name comes from a native word for lamprey, a staple food for the tribe. European settlers approximated the word as but it came to be spelled Coquille (the French word for shell). Eventually the pronunciation of the town and river shifted to , but the tribe&#x27;s name retained the older pronunciation.

==Groups==
The Coquille are part Lower Coquille Miluk and part Lower Rogue River Athabascan “tribes,” Tututni which included the Coquille (Upper Coquille, Mishikwutinetunne) tribe, Shastacosta tribe and Tututni tribe (including Euchre Creek (Yukichetunne) band). Bands of Tututni tribe include the &quot;Kwatami&quot;, &quot;Tututunne&quot;, &quot;Mikonotunne&quot;, &quot;Chemetunne&quot;, &quot;Chetleshin&quot;, &quot;Kwaishtunnetunne&quot;, and &quot;Yukichetunne&quot;, 

==Languages==
The Coquille people historically spoke two languages, Miluk, a Coosan language, and the Upper Coquille dialect of Lower Rogue River, a Pacific Coast Athabaskan language classified as part of the Oregon Athabaskan subgroup. After relocation to the Siletz Reservation, Coquille people had to resort to communicating in Chinuk Wawa, the lingua franca on the reservation, which was composed of many languages foreign to each other in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The Coquille Indian Tribe is involved in language revitalization efforts for both Miluk and Upper Coquille Athabaskan, and the Confederated Tribe of Siletz has a language program focused on Siletz Dee-ni, a loosely standardized variety of the Oregon Athabaskan language, which is a heritage language for many of the communities that make up Siletz.

==History==
Human occupation of the coastal areas of the Coquille watershed dates back as far as 8,000 years, and 11,000 years in inland areas. Fish traps used on the lower Coquille River have been dated back at least 1,000 years. Extensive oral histories of the Coquille have been collected and preserved at the Coquille Indian Tribe Library in Coos Bay, Oregon.

The Coquille fished in the tidewaters and estuaries along the Oregon coastline using fishing weirs and basket traps, and collected shellfish. Some lived in lean-tos made of cedar planks, others constructed homes on wood-frame poles out of willow frames covered with sod or grass reeds.

Modern scholars have documented an extensive network of trails, footpaths, and canoe routes that the Coquille people had developed by the time of contact by the North West Company&#x27;s Alexander McLeod in 1826.

===Mid-19th century to the present===
After the treaty of 1855, the Coquille people were forced to move to the Coastal Indian Reservation (now the Siletz Reservation). Today Coquille people may be part of one of two tribal entities: the Coquille Indian Tribe or the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz.

The Rogue River Athabascan tribes (including Coquille), Takelma, Latgawa and Shasta peoples were in 19th century collectively known as Rogue River Indians.

<text>Hanover Zoo is located in the Mitte borough of Hanover, Germany. The zoo was established on 4 May 1865, and comprises an area of . It contains about 3,414 animals in 237 species, which are cared for by more than 400 employees in the summer season.

== History ==
Hanover Zoo is the fifth-oldest German zoo. It was established in 1865 with private money. To cover expenses, a stock company was founded. Without any experience in the keeping of wild animals, the company faced significant difficulties and, as a result, losses. It was often visited by local residents.

Due to the consequences of World War I, ever increasing subsidies by the government were needed to keep the zoo open. In 1920, the city took over, but in 1922, when the zoo was no longer financially viable, it was closed. Two years later, in 1924, due to public pressure and private commitment by the animal trading company Firma Ruhe, it was re-opened with a lions&#x27; canyon and monkey rock. In 1932, Ruhe completely took over the zoo and used it as a showcase for their pet shop. Often, the animals were only exhibited for a few weeks before they were sold. 
During World War II, the zoo was badly damaged. In 1946, Ruhe restored parts of the zoo provisionally and few animals could be seen until the reopening in 1950. As time passed and with funding from the municipal budget, new enclosures were built for rhinos, elephants, giraffes, antelopes, seals, and penguins. At this time, Hanover Zoo was renowned for its elephant breeding program: 10 Asian and 3 African elephants were born. In 1972, the zoo was again taken over by the city of Hanover.

===Concept Zoo 2000===
In the early 1990s, the zoo had continuously falling visitor numbers. In 1994, it was converted into a limited company and sold to Hanover Region and work on a new concept started the next year. has since been invested in the zoo&#x27;s development.

Since 2000, more than a million people have visited the zoo annually. In 2005, the Winter-Zoo was introduced, in 2007, the children&#x27;s paradise Mollywoop was opened, in spring 2010, the Australian Outback and in May 2010, the seventh theme world followed. A Canadian theme world &quot;Yukon Bay&quot; was opened, a world record of five Asian baby elephants were born in one calendar year at the zoo, and it received the 2009/10 ‘Best Zoo’ award. More than 1.6 million people visit every year. 

== Theme worlds ==
The different zoo worlds show animals in scenic settings, without visible barriers. A explorer path leads through the different exhibits:
* &quot;Zambezi&quot;: Zambezi recreates the African savannah. An artificial river runs alongside the giraffes, rhinoceros, flamingos and other animals living in this part of the zoo. Starting at the trading post with on-foot views of the aforementioned animals, visitors travel in small boats for about ten minutes down the river before continuing on foot to the lion, hippo, flamingo, and pelican, meerkat and Sahara desert hoofstock exhibit. At the &quot;Sahara Conservation Visitor Center&quot;, there is information on the zoo&#x27;s addax reintroduction project.
* &quot;Gorilla Mountain&quot;: On the highest point of the zoo, at the end of the evolution trail featuring dioramas of early humans and an abandoned research camp, gorillas inhabit a forest landscape including a stream and a waterfall. At the foot of the mountain exhibit the gibbons, smallest of the apes, live on an island. The exhibit also includes chimpanzees, other apes, and a sloth.
* &quot;Yukon Bay&quot;: An old mine shaft leads to the Canadian theme world Yukon Bay, where wolves, caribous, prairie dogs, and bisons are visible. In the harbour, Henry&#x27;s Underwater World in the hull of the sunken &quot;Yukon Queen&quot; allows views of diving polar bears, seals, and penguins. Yukon Bay was built in collaboration with the Yukon Territory (Canada).
* &quot;Jungle Palace&quot;: An Indian rainforest exhibit themed as an abandoned Hindu temple with Asian elephants, tigers, leopards, hanuman langurs, and snakes.
* &quot;Outback&quot;: There is an exhibit themed as an Outback farm featuring kangaroos, wombats, emus, wallabies, and a flock of Australian birds in an aviary themed as a pub.
* &quot;Mullewapp (Mollywoop)&quot;: Mullewapp is an exhibit aimed at children with a petting meadow, secret biology room, and toboggans. It is the location of meet and greets with the &quot;Three Friends&quot; by author Helme Heine.
* &quot;Meyer&#x27;s Farm&quot;: Seven old Lower Saxony half-timbered buildings dating back to the 19th century and earlier, re-erected in the zoo, create the setting for Meyer&#x27;s Farm and are used to house rare old domestic breeds like red and white Husum protest pigs, Pomeranian rough-wool sheep, and Exmoor ponies. 
* &quot;Winter-Zoo (seasonal):&quot; During the Christmas season, the theme worlds Meyer&#x27;s Farm, Mollywoop, and Yukon Bay are decorated. Activities available in this season include ice-skating, ice curling, roundabouts, and tobogganing. 

== Conservation ==
Hanover Zoo is also involved in conservation efforts through multiple programs:

* Projects in collaboration with the Sahara Conservation Fund: the Hanover Zoo is involved in a European breeding project for the North African Ostrish and the Addax, also participating in the reinsertion of both species of animal in their natural habitat in North Africa. The project is done in partnership with the Sahara Conservation Fund and many other zoological parks and centers in the world.
* Polar Bear International: the Hanover Zoo is funding the tracking of a polar bear near the Hudson Bay in Canada since 2008 to better study the comportment and migration route of the animals and better help in their conservation through the Polar Bear International organisation.
* Rettet den Drill eV or Save the Drills: Hanover Zoo is working with Rettet den Drill to save drills populations of Nigeria and Cameroun. The American organisation Pandrillus also provides support in their endeavor to both protect the species and breed animals populations in zoos.
* Protection of the Asian Elephant with the Biodiversity and Elephant Conservation Trust: the Hanover Zoo is working with BECT, an NGO from Sri Lanka, in order to protect the Asian Elephant and educate the populations about the situation of the animal. The zoo also has a successful breeding program for the Asian elephant.
* Conservation of old and endangered breeds: the Hanover Zoo also participate in the conservation of European endangered breeds of domestic and farm animals in partnership with the Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen e.V. or GEH. In their efforts of participation, the zoo raises many of these breeds in their petting zoo, helping to conserve the genetic diversity of European livestock. Amongst other, the zoo has Harzer Rotvieh cattles, Thuringian goats, German Black Pied cattles, Pomeranian Coarsewool sheep, German faverolle chicken, and many others.

<text>Hannover-Zoo (also called &quot;Zooviertel&quot;, rarely called &quot;Hindenburgviertel&quot;) is a quarter of the city of Hanover. Located within the quarter is the eponymous Hanover Zoo, also known as the Hanover Zoological Gardens. Part of the borough Hanover-Mitte, it has 4,952 inhabitants (2020).

The quarter is home to the Hanover Congress Center, whose complex contains the historic Stadthalle Hannover, as well as the Stadtpark Hannover, the city park of Hanover built on the grounds of the first Bundesgartenschau of 1951. The entire northern part of the Eilenriede belongs to the district. As such, the Lister Tower is also located in the Zoo district and not in the List district. The Hochschule für Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover is headquartered at the Neues Haus plaza in the quarter.

There are two high schools in the district, the Sophienschule and the Kaiser Wilhelm and Ratsgymnasium. On Gellertstraße street is the Neo-Romanesque church of St. Elisabeth. The former Jewish Hospital Hannover was also located in the district.

The later Reich President Paul von Hindenburg lived in the Zoo district from 1919 to 1925, from which the name &quot;Hindenburgviertel&quot; was derived. The city of Hanover had appointed Hindenburg as honorary citizen and gave him a villa. The Hindenburgvilla is now the seat of the Fritz Behrens Foundation.

The zoo district is considered a desirable residential area containing upscale historic buildings with significantly above-average rents and real estate prices.

<text>An appliance plug is a three-conductor power connector originally developed for kettles, toasters and similar small appliances. It was common in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.

It has largely been made obsolete and replaced by IEC 60320 C15 and C16 connectors, or proprietary connectors to base plates for cordless kettles. It still occurs on some traditional ceramic electric jugs. It is also used for some laboratory water stills.

On some models of the classical ceramic electric jug, the appliance plug prevents the lid from being raised while the connector is inserted. This is important as during operation of these jugs, the water it contains is connected to the electric mains and is an electric shock risk.

Appliance plugs were also used to supply power to electric toasters, electric coffee percolators, electric frypans, and many other appliances. An appliance plug is to some degree heat resistant, but the maximum working temperature varied from manufacturer to manufacturer and even from batch to batch.
The mains connectors of the appliance plug are two rounded sockets that accept two rounded pins from the appliance. They are unpolarised. The third connection, earth, is a large metal contact on each side of the plug body which makes contact with the sides of the plug receptacle, grounding the appliance body. Some appliances using these connectors incorporate a spring and plunger mechanism with a temperature-sensitive release system; if the temperature rises significantly above a preset limit - for example, if a kettle boils dry - the spring is released and (if all goes well) the plunger pushes the plug and socket apart. It must then be allowed to cool and then reset manually by forcing the connector back into the appliance.

A plug of same design but probably different dimensions was in use in former USSR for powering electric kettles and electric samovars.

Famous for his disastrous war against the Chu confederation, his death in battle ended the Western Zhou&#x27;s early expansion and marked the beginning of his dynasty&#x27;s decline.

== Biography ==
By the time of King Zhao&#x27;s coronation, his father King Kang and grandfather King Cheng had conquered and colonized the Central Plains of China, forcing most of the northern and eastern tribal peoples into vassalage. Only the Dongyi of eastern Shandong continued their resistance, but they were no longer a threat to Zhou rule. As result, King Zhao inherited a prospering kingdom, and could afford to build a new ancestral temple for his father. This temple, known as “Kang gong”, was built in line with ritual reforms of the time and would grow into “one of the two central temples of dynastic worship”, the other being the much older “jinggong” temple.

With the north and east pacified and a large military force under his control, King Zhao turned his attention to the Yangtze basin. This region of great mineral wealth was under the control of the confederation of Chu, with whom the Zhou kingdom had been on good terms for almost two centuries. Under King Zhao, the relationship between Zhou and Chu deteriorated, however, as Chu continued its aggressive expansion and Zhou&#x27;s demand for gold, copper and tin grew. As hostilities grew, border clashes ensued that eventually escalated into open war. No longer tolerating Chu&#x27;s perceived defiance, Zhao invaded the Chu confederation in 961 BC. He initially conquered the region to the north of the Yangtze, and then defeated and subdued the 26 states of the Han River valley, including Chu. Most likely unable to permanently occupy the latter region, Zhao eventually retreated with much loot.

In 957 BC, Zhao launched another major military campaign into the middle Yangtze region. Employing half of the royal forces, organized into the &quot;Six Armies of the West&quot;, he probably aimed to permanently bring the Yangtze basin under his control. This campaign, however, ended in disaster as the Zhou forces were defeated and almost entirely wiped out. King Zhao and his remaining troops allegedly drowned while retreating across the Han River.

== Legacy ==
Zhao&#x27;s death and defeat greatly damaged the Zhou dynasty&#x27;s reputation and ended its early expansion, resulting in several foreign invasions of the kingdom. His successor and son King Mu of Zhou was able to restabilise the kingdom, but the Yangtze basin became the permanent southern limit of Western Zhou&#x27;s direct control. Despite his “humiliating end”, however, King Zhao was still commemorated for his southern campaigns during the Western Zhou dynasty, as he had at least established political dominance over the region to the north of the Yangtze and east of the Han River. After his death, he was also given a sacrificial site at the “Kang gong” temple he had himself built. As the first Zhou ruler to be enshrined this way, he eventually became a key figure for ancestor veneration of the middle Zhou dynasty. One major reason for the initially positive appraisal of his reign was possibly that later Zhou rulers did not want their ancestor being remembered for a defeat that cast shame upon the dynasty.

Later moralistic renditions of King Zhao&#x27;s life were much more unfavorable, as they portrayed him as a ruler who loved pleasure and disregarded politics, dying on a hunting trip to the south. Later Chu poets also wrote about King Zhao in the Classical Chinese poetry collection &quot;Heavenly Questions&quot;, mocking him for his perceived arrogance. An especially bizarre incident relating to King Zhao happened in the seventh century BC: When a coalition of Zhou states attacked the state of Chu, the latter sent a delegation to ask what reasons they could have for invading. The northern lords gave the feeble pretext that “King Zhao had failed to return from his southward expedition (which took place some three centuries earlier) and they had &#x27;come to investigate&#x27;.&quot;

<text>The Order of Merit () is an order of merit for the Commonwealth realms, recognising distinguished service in the armed forces, science, art, literature, or the promotion of culture. Established in 1902 by Edward VII, admission into the order remains the personal gift of its Sovereign—currently Edward VII&#x27;s great-great-grandson Charles III—and is restricted to a maximum of 24 living recipients from the Commonwealth realms, plus honorary members. While all members are awarded the right to use the post-nominal letters &quot;OM&quot; and wear the badge of the order, the Order of Merit&#x27;s precedence among other honours differs between countries.

==History==
In around 1773, George III considered establishing an order of knighthood to be called the &quot;Order of Minerva&quot; with membership restricted to 24 distinguished artists and authors. Knights would be entitled to the post-nominal letters &quot;KM&quot;, and would wear a silver nine-pointed breast star with the image of Minerva at its centre, along with a &quot;straw-coloured&quot; sash worn across the chest from the right shoulder. The motto of the Order would be &quot;Omnia posthabita scientiae&quot; (in Latin, &#x27;Everything comes after science&#x27;). Once the King&#x27;s proposal was made public, however, arguments within intellectual circles over who would be most deserving of the new order grew so heated that George ultimately dropped the idea, though he briefly reconsidered it in 1789; on 6 February of that year, he revised the design of the order, with the breast star to have sixteen points, the motto to be the Latin for &quot;Learning improves character&quot; and with membership to include distinguished scientists. Following the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, First Lord of the Admiralty Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham and William Pitt exchanged correspondence concerning the possible creation of an order of merit, though nothing came of the idea.

Later, Queen Victoria, her courtiers, and politicians alike, thought that a new order, based on the Prussian order &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, would make up for the insufficient recognition offered by the established honours system to achievement outside public service, in fields such as art, music, literature, industry and science. Victoria&#x27;s husband, Albert, Prince Consort, took an interest in the matter; it was recorded in his diary that he met Sir Robert Peel on 16 January 1844 to discuss the &quot;idea of institution of a civil Order of Merit&quot; and, three days later, he conferred with the Queen on the subject.

Though nothing came of the idea at the time, the concept did not wither and, more than 40 years later, on 5 January 1888, Prime Minister Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury submitted to the by then long-widowed Queen a draft constitution for an Order of Merit in Science and Art, consisting of one grade split into two branches of knighthood: the Order of Scientific Merit, for Knights of Merit in Science, with the post-nominal letters &quot;KMS&quot;, and the Order of Artistic Merit, for Knights of Merit in Art, with the post-nominal letters &quot;KMA&quot;. However, Frederic Leighton, President of the Royal Academy of Arts, advised against the new order, primarily because of its selection process. 
It was Victoria&#x27;s son Edward VII who eventually founded the Order of Merit on 26 June 1902 (the date for which his coronation had been originally scheduled) as a means to acknowledge &quot;exceptionally meritorious service in Our Navy and Our Army, or who may have rendered exceptionally meritorious service towards the advancement of Art, Literature and Science&quot;. All modern aspects of the order were established under his direction, including the division for military figures.

From the outset, prime ministers attempted to propose candidates or lobbied to influence the monarch&#x27;s decision on appointments. But, the Royal Household adamantly guarded information about potential names. After 1931, when the Statute of Westminster came into effect and the Dominions of the British Empire became independent countries within the empire, equal in status to the UK, the Order of Merit continued as an honour open to all these realms and, in many, became a part of their newly developing national honours systems. The order&#x27;s statutes were amended in 1935 to include members of the Royal Air Force and, in 1969, the definition of honorary recipients was expanded to include members of the Commonwealth of Nations that are not realms.

The order has always been open to women, Florence Nightingale being the first woman to receive the honour, in 1907. Several individuals have refused admission into the Order of Merit, including Rudyard Kipling, A. E. Housman, and George Bernard Shaw. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, remains the youngest person ever inducted into the Order, having been admitted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1968, when he was 47 years old.

Robin Eames, Baron Eames represented the order at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla on 6 May 2023.

==Eligibility and appointment==
All citizens of the Commonwealth realms are eligible for appointment to the Order of Merit. There may be, however, only 24 living individuals in the order at any given time, not including honorary appointees, and new members are personally selected by the reigning monarch of the realms, currently Charles III, with the assistance of his private secretaries; the order has thus been described as &quot;quite possibly, the most prestigious honour one can receive on planet Earth.&quot; Within the limited membership is a designated military division, with its own unique insignia; though it has not been abolished, it is currently unpopulated, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma having been the last person so honoured. 

Honorary members form another group, to which there is no numerical limit, though such appointments are rare; individuals from countries in the Commonwealth of Nations that are not headed by King Charles are therefore considered foreigners, and thus are granted only honorary admissions, such as Nelson Mandela (South Africa) and Mother Teresa (India).

Upon admission into the Order of Merit, members are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;OM&quot; and are entrusted with the badge of the order.

==Insignia==

The insignia consists of a badge, which consists of a golden crown from which is suspended a red enamelled cross pattée, itself centred by a disk of blue enamel, surrounded by a laurel wreath. The obverse of the badge&#x27;s central disk bears the words &quot;FOR MERIT&quot; in gold lettering, while the reverse bears the royal cypher of the reigning monarch in gold. The insignia for the military grouping is distinguished by a pair of crossed swords behind the central disk.

The ribbon of the Order of Merit is divided into two stripes of red and blue. The neck ribbon is 50mm in width, while the ribbon bar width is the standard British 32mm size for military or civilian wear. Men wear their badges on a neck ribbon (as a necklet), while women wear theirs on a ribbon bow pinned to the left shoulder, and aides-de-camp may wear the insignia on their aiguillettes. 

Since 1991, the insignia must be returned upon the recipient&#x27;s death.

==Order of wear==
As the Order of Merit is open to the citizens of 15 countries, each with their own system of orders, decorations, and medals, the order&#x27;s place of precedence varies from country to country. While, in the United Kingdom, the order&#x27;s postnominal letters follow those of Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, membership in the Order of Merit itself gives members no place in any of the orders of precedence in the United Kingdom. However, Stanley Martin says in his book &quot;The Order of Merit 1902–2002: One Hundred Years of Matchless Honour&quot;, that the Order of Merit is the pinnacle of the British honours system. Similarly, though it was not listed in the Canadian order of precedence for honours, decorations, and medals until December 2010, Christopher McCreery, an expert on Canadian honours and secretary to the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, stated that the Order of Merit was the highest civilian award for merit a Canadian could receive.

Some orders of precedence are as follows:

<text>Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett, Baron Blackett (18 November 1897 – 13 July 1974) was an English physicist who received the 1948 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1925, he was the first person to prove that radioactivity could cause the nuclear transmutation of one chemical element to another. He also made major contributions to the Allied war effort in World War II, advising on military strategy and developing operational research.

In the war&#x27;s aftermath, Blackett continued his scientific work, but also became outspoken on political matters. He advocated for restraints on the military use of atomic energy. He was a proponent for Third World development and for reducing the gap between rich and poor. In the 1950s and &#x27;60s, he was a key advisor to the Labour Party on science and technology policy. By the time of his death in 1974, Blackett had become controversial to the point that the &quot;Times&quot; obituary referred to him as the &quot;Radical Nobel-Prize Winning Physicist&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Blackett was born in Kensington, London, the son of Arthur Stuart Blackett, a stockbroker, and his wife Caroline Maynard. His younger sister was the psychoanalyst Marion Milner. His paternal grandfather Rev. Henry Blackett, brother of Edmund Blacket the Australian architect, was for many years vicar of Croydon. His maternal grandfather Charles Maynard was an officer in the Royal Artillery at the time of the Indian Mutiny. The Blackett family lived successively at Kensington, Kenley, Woking and Guildford, Surrey, where Blackett went to preparatory school. His main hobbies were model aeroplanes and crystal radio. When he interviewed for entrance to the Royal Naval College, Osborne, Isle of Wight, Charles Rolls had just completed his cross-channel flight the previous day and Blackett, who had tracked the flight on his crystal set, was able to expound lengthily on the subject. He was accepted and spent two years there before moving on to Dartmouth where he was &quot;usually head of his class&quot;.

In August 1914 at the outbreak of World War I, Blackett was assigned to active service as a midshipman. He was transferred to the Cape Verde Islands on HMS &quot;Carnarvon&quot; and was present at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. He was then transferred to HMS &quot;Barham&quot; and saw much action at the Battle of Jutland. While on the &quot;Barham&quot;, Blackett was co-inventor of a gunnery device on which the Admiralty took out a patent. In 1916, he applied to join the RNAS but his application was refused. In October of that year, he became a sub-lieutenant on HMS &quot;P17&quot; on Dover patrol, and in July 1917 he was posted to HMS &quot;Sturgeon&quot; in the Harwich Force under Admiral Tyrwhitt. Blackett was concerned by the poor quality of British gunnery in the Harwich Force when compared with that of the enemy. In May 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant, but by then had decided to leave the Navy. He started to read science textbooks as he planned his post-war career.

In January 1919, the Admiralty sent the officers whose training had been interrupted by the war to the University of Cambridge for a course of general duties. On his first night at Magdalene College, Cambridge, he met Kingsley Martin and Geoffrey Webb, later recalling that he had never before, in his naval training, heard intellectual conversation. Blackett was impressed by the prestigious Cavendish Laboratory, and left the Navy to study mathematics and physics at Cambridge.

==Career and research==
After graduating from Magdalene College in 1921, Blackett spent ten years working at the Cavendish Laboratory as an experimental physicist with Ernest Rutherford and in 1923 became a fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, a position he held until 1933.

Rutherford had discovered that the nucleus of the nitrogen atom could be disintegrated by firing fast alpha particles into nitrogen. He asked Blackett to use a cloud chamber to find visible tracks of this disintegration, and by 1925, Blackett had taken 23,000 photographs showing 415,000 tracks of ionized particles. Eight of these were forked, and this showed that the nitrogen atom-alpha particle combination had formed an atom of fluorine, which then disintegrated into an isotope of oxygen 17 and a proton. Blackett published the results of his experiments in 1925. He thus became the first person to deliberately transmute one element into another.

During his time at Cambridge, Blackett was the head tutor of the young American graduate student, J. Robert Oppenheimer. The latter&#x27;s desire to study theoretical physics rather than focus on lab work brought him into conflict with Blackett. While seeking help for a psychiatric breakdown induced by the demanding Blackett, Oppenheimer admitted to trying to poison his tutor with an apple laced with toxins. Blackett did not eat the apple and no punitive action was taken against Oppenheimer for the attempted poisoning.

Blackett spent time in 1924–25 in Göttingen, Germany, working with James Franck on atomic spectra. In 1932, Blackett partnered with Giuseppe Occhialini to devise a system of Geiger counters which took photographs only when a cosmic ray particle traversed the chamber. They found 500 tracks of high energy cosmic ray particles in 700 automatic exposures. In 1933, Blackett discovered fourteen tracks which confirmed the existence of the positron and revealed the now instantly recognisable opposing spiral traces of positron/electron pair production. He and Occhialini published their findings in a landmark 1933 paper in &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society A&quot;. This work, combined with his research on annihilation radiation, made Blackett a leading expert in the new theory of antimatter.

That same year, he moved to Birkbeck, University of London, as professor of Physics, and stayed for four years. In 1937, he went to the Victoria University of Manchester where he was elected to the Langworthy Professorship and created a major international research laboratory. The Blackett Memorial Hall and Blackett Lecture Theatre at the University of Manchester were subsequently named after him.

In 1947, Blackett introduced a theory to account for the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field as a function of its rotation, with the hope that it would unify both the electromagnetic force and the force of gravity. He spent a number of years developing high-quality magnetometers to test his theory, but eventually found it to be without merit. However, his work on the subject led him into geophysics, where he later helped process data relating to paleomagnetism, and also provided strong evidence for continental drift.
He was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize in Physics for his investigation of cosmic rays using his invention of the counter-controlled cloud chamber.

In 1953, he was appointed head of the Physics Department at Imperial College London, and retired from there in July 1963. The Physics department building of Imperial College, the Blackett Laboratory, is named in his honour.

In 1957, Blackett gave the presidential address (&quot;Technology and World Advancement&quot;) to the British Association meeting in Dublin In 1965, he delivered the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject &quot;Continental Drift&quot;.

===World War II and operational research===
In 1935, Blackett was invited to join the Aeronautical Research Committee chaired by Sir Henry Tizard. The committee was effective in advocating for the early installation of Radar for air defence. At the beginning of World War II, Blackett served on various committees and spent time at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) Farnborough, where he made a major contribution to the design of the Mark XIV bomb sight, which allowed bombs to be released without a level bombing run beforehand. In 1940–41, he served on the MAUD Committee which concluded that an atomic bomb was feasible. He disagreed with the committee&#x27;s conclusion that Britain could produce an atomic bomb by 1943, and he recommended that the project should be discussed with the Americans. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1933 and awarded its Royal Medal in 1940.

In August 1940, Blackett became scientific adviser to Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Pile, Commander in Chief of Anti-Aircraft Command and thus began the work that resulted in the field of study known as operational research (OR). He was director of Operational Research with the Admiralty from 1942 to 1945, and his work with E. J. Williams improved the survival odds of convoys, presented counter-intuitive but correct recommendations for the armour-plating of aircraft, and achieved many other successes. His aim, he said, was to base military strategy on numbers, not &quot;gusts of emotions&quot;. During the war he criticised the assumptions in Lord Cherwell&#x27;s dehousing paper and sided with Tizard who argued that fewer resources should go to RAF Bomber Command for the area bombing offensive and more to the other armed forces. Blackett&#x27;s studies had shown the ineffectiveness of the area bombing strategies, as opposed to the importance of fighting off the German U-boats, which were heavily affecting the war effort with their sinkings of merchant ships. In this opinion, he chafed against the existing military authority and was cut out of various circles of communications. However, after the war, the Allied Strategic Bombing Survey proved Blackett correct.

===Politics===
While an undergraduate, Blackett befriended Kingsley Martin, the future editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;; their talks on politics contributed to Blackett&#x27;s move to the left. He later identified himself as a socialist, and often campaigned on behalf of the Labour Party. In the aftermath of World War II, Blackett became known for his radical political opinions, which included a belief that Britain ought not to develop atomic weapons. His biographer Mary Jo Nye noted: As a result of these controversies, Blackett was considered too far to the left for the post-war Labour Government to employ, and he returned to academic life.

Blackett&#x27;s internationalism found expression in his strong support for India. In 1947 he met Jawaharlal Nehru, who sought the scientist&#x27;s advice on the research and development needs of the Indian armed forces. For the next 20 years, Blackett was a frequent visitor and advisor to India on military and civil science. These visits deepened his concern for the underprivileged and the poor. He was convinced that their problems could be overcome by applying science and technology. He used his prestige in the scientific community to try to persuade fellow scientists that one of their first duties should be to help ensure a decent life for all mankind. Before underdevelopment became a popular issue, Blackett proposed in a 1957 presidential address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science that his country should devote 1% of its national income to the economic improvement of the Third World, and he was later one of the prime movers in the founding of the Overseas Development Institute.

During the 13 years when the Labour Party was out of office, Blackett was the senior member of a group of scientists who met regularly to discuss scientific and technological policy. This group grew in influence when Harold Wilson assumed leadership of the Party. Blackett&#x27;s suggestions directly led to the creation of the Ministry of Technology as soon as the Wilson government was formed, and he insisted that a top priority should be revival of Britain&#x27;s computer industry. Blackett did not enter open politics, but worked for a year as a civil servant. He remained deputy chairman of the Minister&#x27;s Advisory Council throughout the administration&#x27;s life, and was also personal scientific adviser to the Minister.

===Publications===
* Published the following year in the U.S. under the title &quot;Fear, War, and the Bomb&quot;.
* 

===Influence in fiction===
* Blackett&#x27;s theories of planetary magnetism and gravity were taken up by the science fiction author James Blish, who cited the Blackett effect as the theoretical &quot;basis&quot; behind his &quot;spindizzy&quot; antigravity drive.
* In his close friend C. P. Snow&#x27;s novel sequence &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot; (1940–1974), aspects of Blackett&#x27;s personality are drawn upon for the left-wing physicist Francis Getliffe.
* Blackett and his dictum, &quot;You can&#x27;t run a war on gusts of emotion&quot;, appear in the &#x27;alternative&#x27; WWII novel, &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;.

==Personal life==
Blackett was an agnostic or atheist. He had refused many honours, in the manner of a radical of the twenties, but accepted appointment as Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1965 Birthday Honours, and was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1967. He was created a life peer on 27 January 1969 as Baron Blackett, &quot;of Chelsea in Greater London&quot;. He was made President of the Royal Society in 1965. The crater Blackett on the Moon is named after him.

Blackett married Costanza Bayon (1899–1986) in March 1924. They had a son and a daughter. 

The Blackett Laboratory is part of Imperial College Faculty of Natural Sciences and has housed the Physics Department since its completion in 1961.

Blackett died on 13 July 1974 at age 76. His ashes are buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

Bernard Lovell wrote of Blackett: &quot;Those who worked with Blackett in the laboratory were dominated by his immensely powerful personality, and those who knew him elsewhere soon discovered that the public image thinly veiled a sensitive and humane spirit&quot;.

Edward Bullard said that he was the most versatile and best loved physicist of his generation and that his achievement was also without rival: &quot;he was wonderfully intelligent, charming, fun to be with, dignified and handsome&quot;.

In 2016, the house that Blackett lived in from 1953 to 1969 (48 Paultons Square, Chelsea, London) received an English Heritage blue plaque.

In July 2022, the Royal Navy named an experimental ship after Blackett in honour of his service to the Royal Navy and to the country; &quot;XV &quot;Patrick Blackett&quot;&quot; will be used by the Royal Navy to experiment with autonomous technologies.

==In popular culture==
Blackett was portrayed by James D&#x27;Arcy in the 2023 film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;.

<text>The toothed whales (also called odontocetes, systematic name Odontoceti) are a clade of cetaceans that includes dolphins, porpoises, and all other whales with teeth, such as beaked whales and the sperm whales. 73 species of toothed whales are described. They are one of two living groups of cetaceans, the other being the baleen whales (Mysticeti), which have baleen instead of teeth. The two groups are thought to have diverged around 34 million years ago (mya).

Toothed whales range in size from the and vaquita to the and sperm whale. Several species of odontocetes exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that there are size or other morphological differences between females and males. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Some can travel at up to 30 knots. Odontocetes have conical teeth designed for catching fish or squid. They have well-developed hearing that is well adapted for both air and water, so much so that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. Almost all have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water, with the exception of river dolphins.

Toothed whales consist of some of the most widespread mammals, but some, as with the vaquita, are restricted to certain areas. Odontocetes feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the orca, feed on mammals, such as pinnipeds. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, making them polygynous. Females mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer, and females bear the responsibility for raising them, but more sociable species rely on the family group to care for calves. Many species, mainly dolphins, are highly sociable, with some pods reaching over a thousand individuals.

Once hunted for their products, cetaceans are now protected by international law. Some species are very intelligent. At the 2012 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, support was reiterated for a cetacean bill of rights, listing cetaceans as nonhuman persons. Besides whaling and drive hunting, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The baiji, for example, is considered functionally extinct by IUCN, with the last sighting in 2004, due to heavy pollution to the Yangtze River. Whales sometimes feature in literature and film, as in the great white sperm whale of Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. Small odontocetes, mainly dolphins, are kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks. Whale watching has become a form of tourism around the world.

==Taxonomy==

===Research history===



In Aristotle&#x27;s time, the fourth century BC, whales were regarded as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could already see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus, and fin anatomy. His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural history&quot;. In the art of this and subsequent periods, dolphins are portrayed with a high-arched head (typical of porpoises) and a long snout. The harbor porpoise is one of the most accessible species for early cetologists, because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Many of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were therefore first discovered in the porpoises. One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish.

===Evolution===


Toothed whales, as well as baleen whales, are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). They are closely related to the hippopotamus, sharing a common ancestor that lived around 54 million years ago (mya).
The primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 mya and became fully aquatic by 5–10 million years later. The ancestors of toothed whales and baleen whales diverged in the early Oligocene. This was due to a change in the climate of the southern oceans that affected where the environment of the plankton that these whales ate.

The adaptation of echolocation and enhanced fat synthesis in blubber occurred when toothed whales split apart from baleen whales, and distinguishes modern toothed whales from fully aquatic archaeocetes. This happened around 34 mya. Unlike toothed whales, baleen whales do not have wax ester deposits nor branched fatty chain acids in their blubber. Thus, more recent evolution of these complex blubber traits occurred after baleen whales and toothed whales split, and only in the toothed whale lineage. 

Modern toothed whales do not rely on their sense of sight, but rather on their sonar to hunt prey. Echolocation also allowed toothed whales to dive deeper in search of food, with light no longer necessary for navigation, which opened up new food sources. Toothed whales (Odontocetes) echolocate by creating a series of clicks emitted at various frequencies. Sound pulses are emitted through the melon-shaped forehead, reflected off objects, and retrieved through the lower jaw. Skulls of &quot;Squalodon&quot; show evidence for the first hypothesized appearance of echolocation. &quot;Squalodon&quot; lived from the early to middle Oligocene to the middle Miocene, around 33-14 mya. &quot;Squalodon&quot; featured several commonalities with modern Odontocetes. The cranium was well compressed, the rostrum telescoped outward (a characteristic of the modern parvorder Odontoceti), giving &quot;Squalodon&quot; an appearance similar to that of modern toothed whales. However, it is thought unlikely that squalodontids are direct ancestors of living dolphins.

==Biology==

===Anatomy===
Toothed whales have torpedo-shaped bodies with usually inflexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, no outer ears, a large tail fin, and bulbous heads (with the exception of the sperm whale family). Their skulls have small eye orbits, long beaks (with the exception sperm whales), and eyes placed on the sides of their heads. Toothed whales range in size from the and vaquita to the and sperm whale. Overall, they tend to be dwarfed by their relatives, the baleen whales (Mysticeti). Several species have sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males. One exception is with the sperm whale, which has males larger than the females.

Odontocetes possess teeth with cementum cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on the portion of the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show. There is only a single set of functional teeth (monophyodont dentition). Except for the sperm whale, most toothed whales are smaller than the baleen whales. The teeth differ considerably among the species. They may be numerous, with some dolphins bearing over 100 teeth in their jaws. At the other extreme are the narwhals with their single long tusks and the almost toothless beaked whales with tusk-like teeth only in males. In most beaked whales the teeth are seen to erupt in the lower jaw, and primarily occurs at the males sexual maturity. Not all species are believed to use their teeth for feeding. For instance, the sperm whale likely uses its teeth for aggression and showmanship.

Breathing involves expelling stale air from their one blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. Spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification. The spout only forms when warm air from the lungs meets cold air, so it does not form in warmer climates, as with river dolphins.

Almost all cetaceans have a thick layer of blubber, except for river dolphins. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as . This blubber can help with buoyancy, protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, energy for fasting during leaner times, and insulation from the harsh climate. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.

Toothed whales have also evolved the ability to store large amounts of wax esters in their adipose tissue as an addition to or in complete replacement of other fats in their blubber. They can produce isovaleric acid from branched chain fatty acids (BCFA). These adaptations are unique, are only in more recent, derived lineages and were likely part of the transition for species to become deeper divers as the families of toothed whales (Physeteridae, Kogiidae, and Ziphiidae) that have the highest quantities of wax esters and BCFAs in their blubber are also the species that dive the deepest and for the longest amount of time.

Toothed whales have a two-chambered stomach similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers.

===Locomotion===

Cetaceans have two flippers on the front, and a tail fin. These flippers contain four digits. Although toothed whales do not possess fully developed hind limbs, some, such as the sperm whale, possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Toothed whales are fast swimmers in comparison to seals, which typically cruise at 5–15 knots, or ; the sperm whale, in comparison, can travel at speeds of up to . The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, rendering them incapable of turning their heads; river dolphins, however, have unfused neck vertebrae and can turn their heads. When swimming, toothed whales rely on their tail fins to propel them through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. They swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Some species log out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin.

Most toothed whales are adapted for diving to great depths, porpoises are one exception. In addition to their streamlined bodies, they can slow their heart rate to conserve oxygen; blood is rerouted from tissue tolerant of water pressure to the heart and brain among other organs; haemoglobin and myoglobin store oxygen in body tissue; and they have twice the concentration of myoglobin than haemoglobin. Before going on long dives, many toothed whales exhibit a behaviour known as sounding; they stay close to the surface for a series of short, shallow dives while building their oxygen reserves, and then make a sounding dive.

===Senses===
Toothed whale eyes are relatively small for their size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. Also, the eyes are on the sides of the head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view as humans have. When a beluga surfaces, its lenses and corneas correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. They do, however, lack short wavelength-sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells, indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most toothed whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas, and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye, and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. In water, a whale can see around ahead of itself, but they have a smaller range above water. They also have glands on the eyelids and outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea.

The olfactory lobes are absent in toothed whales, and unlike baleen whales, they lack the vomeronasal organ, suggesting they have no sense of smell.

Toothed whales are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. However, some dolphins have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.

=== Echolocation ===

Toothed whales are capable of making a broad range of sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. Clicks are directional and are used for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. Toothed whale biosonar clicks are amongst the loudest sounds made by marine animals.

The cetacean ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air&#x27;s low impedance and the cochlear fluid&#x27;s high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, no great difference exists between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance, fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. 

Odontocetes generate sounds independently of respiration using recycled air that passes through air sacs and phonic (alternatively monkey) lips. Integral to the lips are oil-filled organs called dorsal bursae that have been suggested to be homologous in the dolphin to the sperm whale&#x27;s spermaceti organ. These send out high-frequency clicks through the sound-modifying organs of the extramandibular fat body, intramandibular fat body and the melon. 

The melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger it is, the more dependent they are on it. A beaked whale, for example, has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale&#x27;s head is filled mainly with the melon. Directional asymmetry in the skull has been seen amongst many generations, used for echolocation. This asymmetry is useful in focusing the use of bio sonar effectively when deep diving for prey. Odontocetes are well adapted to hear sounds at ultrasonic frequencies, as opposed to mysticetes who generally hear sounds within the range of infrasonic frequencies.

=== Communication calls ===

Bottlenose dolphins have been found to have signature whistles unique to each individual. Dolphins use these whistles to communicate with one another by identifying an individual. It can be seen as the dolphin equivalent of a name for humans.
Because dolphins generally live in groups, communication is necessary. Signal masking is when other similar sounds (conspecific sounds) interfere with the original sound. In larger groups, individual whistle sounds are less prominent. Dolphins tend to travel in pods, sometimes of up to 600 members. 

==Life history and behaviour==

===Intelligence===

Cetaceans are known to communicate and therefore are able to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and grieve. The neocortex of many species of dolphins is home to elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids. In humans, these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions, judgement, and theory of mind. Dolphin spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting they perform a similar function.

Brain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales around the two-thirds or three-quarters exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal&#x27;s brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalization quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. Sperm whales have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth, averaging and in mature males, in comparison to the average human brain which averages in mature males. The brain to body mass ratio in some odontocetes, such as belugas and narwhals, is second only to humans.

Dolphins are known to engage in complex play behaviour, which includes such things as producing stable underwater toroidal air-core vortex rings or &quot;bubble rings&quot;. Two main methods of bubble ring production are: rapid puffing of a burst of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the helical vortex currents thus formed. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Dolphins are known to use this method during hunting. Dolphins are also known to use tools. In Shark Bay, a population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins put sponges on their beak to protect them from abrasions and sting ray barbs while foraging in the seafloor. This behaviour is passed on from mother to daughter, and it is only observed in 54 female individuals.

Self-awareness is seen, by some, to be a sign of highly developed, abstract thinking. Self-awareness, though not well-defined scientifically, is believed to be the precursor to more advanced processes like metacognitive reasoning (thinking about thinking) that are typical of humans. Research in this field has suggested that cetaceans, among others, possess self-awareness. The most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the mirror test, in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal&#x27;s body, and the animal is then presented with a mirror; then whether the animal shows signs of self-recognition is determined. In 1995, Marten and Psarakos used television to test dolphin self-awareness. They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage, and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. While this particular study has not been repeated since then, dolphins have since &quot;passed&quot; the mirror test.
===Vocalisations===


Dolphins make a broad range of sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. Roughly three categories of sounds can be identified: frequency modulated whistles, burst-pulsed sounds and clicks. Dolphins communicate with whistle-like sounds produced by vibrating connective tissue, similar to the way human vocal cords function, and through burst-pulsed sounds, though the nature and extent of that ability is not known. The clicks are directional and are for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. Dolphin echolocation clicks are amongst the loudest sounds made by marine animals.

Bottlenose dolphins have been found to have signature whistles, a whistle that is unique to a specific individual. These whistles are used in order for dolphins to communicate with one another by identifying an individual. It can be seen as the dolphin equivalent of a name for humans. These signature whistles are developed during a dolphin&#x27;s first year; it continues to maintain the same sound throughout its lifetime. An auditory experience influences the whistle development of each dolphin. Dolphins are able to communicate to one another by addressing another dolphin through mimicking their whistle. The signature whistle of a male bottlenose dolphin tends to be similar to that of his mother, while the signature whistle of a female bottlenose dolphin tends to be more identifying. Bottlenose dolphins have a strong memory when it comes to these signature whistles, as they are able to relate to a signature whistle of an individual they have not encountered for over twenty years. Research done on signature whistle usage by other dolphin species is relatively limited. The research on other species done so far has yielded varied outcomes and inconclusive results.

Sperm whales can produce three specific vocalisations: creaks, codas, and slow clicks. A creak is a rapid series of high-frequency clicks that sounds somewhat like a creaky door hinge. It is typically used when homing in on prey. A coda is a short pattern of 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations to identify one another (like a signature whistle), but it is still unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates. Slow clicks are heard only in the presence of males (it is not certain whether females occasionally make them). Males make a lot of slow clicks in breeding grounds (74% of the time), both near the surface and at depth, which suggests they are primarily mating signals. Outside breeding grounds, slow clicks are rarely heard, and usually near the surface.

===Foraging and predation===

All whales are carnivorous and predatory. Odontocetes, as a whole, mostly feed on fish and cephalopods, and then followed by crustaceans and bivalves. All species are generalist and opportunistic feeders. Some may forage with other kinds of animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Orcas and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it, a behaviour known as beach or strand feeding. The shape of the snout may correlate with tooth number and thus feeding mechanisms. The narwhal, with its blunt snout and reduced dentition, relies on suction feeding.

Sperm whales usually dive between , and sometimes , in search of food. Such dives can last more than an hour. They feed on several species, notably the giant squid, but also the colossal squid, octopuses, and fish like demersal rays, but their diet is mainly medium-sized squid. Some prey may be taken accidentally while eating other items. A study in the Galápagos found that squid from the genera &quot;Histioteuthis&quot; (62%), &quot;Ancistrocheirus&quot; (16%), and &quot;Octopoteuthis&quot; (7%) weighing between were the most commonly taken. Battles between sperm whales and giant squid or colossal squid have never been observed by humans; however, white scars are believed to be caused by the large squid. A 2010 study suggests that female sperm whales may collaborate when hunting Humboldt squid.
The orca is known to prey on numerous other toothed whale species. One example is the false killer whale. To subdue and kill whales, orcas continually ram them with their heads; this can sometimes kill bowhead whales, or severely injure them. Other times, they corral their prey before striking. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer orca, but they are seldom attacked by an individual. Calves are more commonly taken by orca, but adults can be targeted, as well. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such as minke whales, gray whales, and rarely sperm whales or blue whales. Other marine mammal prey species include nearly 20 species of seal, sea lion and fur seal.

These cetaceans are targeted by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well-adapted for hunting Arctic whales and calves. Bears are known to use sit-and-wait tactics, as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Whales lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. This, however, means less room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly closes the gap. When out at sea, whales dive out of the reach of surface-hunting orca. Polar bear attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter, but rarely inflict any damage in summer.

For most of the smaller species of dolphins, only a few of the larger sharks, such as the bull shark, dusky shark, tiger shark, and great white shark, are a potential risk, especially for calves. Dolphins can tolerate and recover from extreme injuries (including shark bites) although the exact methods used to achieve this are not known. The healing process is rapid and even very deep wounds do not cause dolphins to hemorrhage to death. Even gaping wounds restore in such a way that the animal&#x27;s body shape is restored, and infection of such large wounds are rare.

===Life cycle===
Toothed whales are fully aquatic creatures, which means their birth and courtship behaviours are very different from terrestrial and semiaquatic creatures. Since they are unable to go onto land to calve, they deliver their young with the fetus positioned for tail-first delivery. This prevents the calf from drowning either upon or during delivery. To feed the newborn, toothed whales, being aquatic, must squirt the milk into the mouth of the calf. Being mammals, they have mammary glands used for nursing calves; they are weaned around 11 months of age. This milk contains high amounts of fat which is meant to hasten the development of blubber; it contains so much fat, it has the consistency of toothpaste. Females deliver a single calf, with gestation lasting about a year, dependency until one to two years, and maturity around seven to 10 years, all varying between the species. This mode of reproduction produces few offspring, but increases the survival probability of each one. Females, referred to as &quot;cows&quot;, carry the responsibility of childcare, as males, referred to as &quot;bulls&quot;, play no part in raising calves.

In orcas, false killer whales, short-finned pilot whales, narwhals, and belugas, there is an unusually long post-reproductive lifespan (menopause) in females. Older females, though unable to have their own children, play a key role in the rearing of other calves in the pod, and in this sense, given the costs of pregnancy especially at an advanced age, extended menopause is advantageous.

==Interaction with humans==

===Threats===

====Sperm whaling====
The head of the sperm whale is filled with a waxy liquid called spermaceti. This liquid can be refined into spermaceti wax and sperm oil. These were much sought after by 18th-, 19th-, and 20th-century whalers. These substances found a variety of commercial applications, such as candles, soap, cosmetics, machine oil, other specialized lubricants, lamp oil, pencils, crayons, leather waterproofing, rustproofing materials, and many pharmaceutical compounds.
 Ambergris, a solid, waxy, flammable substance produced in the digestive system of sperm whales, was also sought as a fixative in perfumery.

Sperm whaling in the 18th century began with small sloops carrying only a pair of whaleboats (sometimes only one). As the scope and size of the fleet increased, so did the rig of the vessels change, as brigs, schooners, and finally ships and barks were introduced. In the 19th-century stubby, square-rigged ships (and later barks) dominated the fleet, being sent to the Pacific (the first being the British whaleship &quot;Emilia&quot;, in 1788), the Indian Ocean (1780s), and as far away as the Japan grounds (1820) and the coast of Arabia (1820s), as well as Australia (1790s) and New Zealand (1790s).
Hunting for sperm whales during this period was notoriously dangerous for the crews of the 19th-century whaleboats. Though a properly harpooned sperm whale generally exhibited a fairly consistent pattern of trying to flee underwater to the point of exhaustion (at which point it would surface and offer no further resistance), it was not uncommon for bull whales to become enraged and turn to attack pursuing whaleboats on the surface, particularly if it had already been wounded by repeated harpooning attempts. A commonly reported tactic was for the whale to invert itself and violently thrash the surface of the water with its fluke, flipping and crushing nearby boats.

The estimated historic worldwide sperm whale population numbered 1,100,000 before commercial sperm whaling began in the early 18th century. By 1880, it had declined an estimated 29%. From that date until 1946, the population appears to have recovered somewhat as whaling pressure lessened, but after the Second World War, with the industry&#x27;s focus again on sperm whales, the population declined even further to only 33%. In the 19th century, between 184,000 and 236,000 sperm whales were estimated to have been killed by the various whaling nations, while in the modern era, at least 770,000 were taken, most between 1946 and 1980. Remaining sperm whale populations are large enough so that the species&#x27; conservation status is vulnerable, rather than endangered. However, the recovery from the whaling years is a slow process, particularly in the South Pacific, where the toll on males of breeding age was severe.

====Drive hunting====
Dolphins and porpoises are hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. This is done by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the often polluted meat causes, thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.

In Japan, the hunting is done by a select group of fishermen. When a pod of dolphins has been spotted, they are driven into a bay by the fishermen while banging on metal rods in the water to scare and confuse the dolphins. When the dolphins are in the bay, it is quickly closed off with nets so the dolphins cannot escape. The dolphins are usually not caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, the dolphins are caught one by one and killed. The killing of the animals used to be done by slitting their throats, but the Japanese government banned this method, and now dolphins may officially only be killed by driving a metal pin into the neck of the dolphin, which causes them to die within seconds according to a memo from Senzo Uchida, the executive secretary of the Japan Cetacean Conference on Zoological Gardens and Aquariums. A veterinary team&#x27;s analysis of a 2011 video footage of Japanese hunters killing striped dolphins using this method suggested that, in one case, death took over four minutes.

Since much of the criticism is the result of photos and videos taken during the hunt and slaughter, it is now common for the final capture and slaughter to take place on site inside a tent or under a plastic cover, out of sight from the public. The most circulated footage is probably that of the drive and subsequent capture and slaughter process taken in Futo, Japan, in October 1999, shot by the Japanese animal welfare organization Elsa Nature Conservancy. Part of this footage was, amongst others, shown on CNN. In recent years, the video has also become widespread on the internet and was featured in the animal welfare documentary &quot;Earthlings&quot;, though the method of killing dolphins as shown in this video is now officially banned. In 2009, a critical documentary on the hunts in Japan titled &quot;The Cove&quot; was released and shown amongst others at the Sundance Film Festival.

====Other threats====
Toothed whales can also be threatened by humans more indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries as bycatch and accidentally swallow fishhooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting are significant causes of mortality in cetaceans and other marine mammals. Porpoises are commonly entangled in fishing nets. Whales are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are high in the food chain. They have large reserves of blubber, more so for toothed whales, as they are higher up the food chain than baleen whales. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancer and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. They may also swallow litter, such as plastic bags. Pollution of the Yangtze river has led to the extinction of the baiji. Environmentalists speculate that advanced naval sonar endangers some whales. Some scientists suggest that sonar may trigger whale beachings, and they point to signs that such whales have experienced decompression sickness.

===Conservation===
Currently, no international convention gives universal coverage to all small whales, although the International Whaling Commission has attempted to extend its jurisdiction over them. ASCOBANS was negotiated to protect all small whales in the North and Baltic Seas and in the northeast Atlantic. ACCOBAMS protects all whales in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The global UNEP Convention on Migratory Species currently covers seven toothed whale species or populations on its Appendix I, and 37 species or populations on Appendix II. All oceanic cetaceans are listed in CITES appendices, meaning international trade in them and products derived from them is very limited.

Many organizations are dedicated to protecting certain species that do not fall under any international treaty, such as CIRVA (Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita), and the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology (for the Yangtze finless porpoise).

===In captivity===
====Species====

Various species of toothed whales, mainly dolphins, are kept in captivity, as well as several other species of porpoise such as harbour porpoises and finless porpoises. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks, such as SeaWorld, commonly known as a dolphinarium. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species kept in dolphinariums, as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity, and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Orca are well known for their performances in shows, but the number kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with only 44 captives being held in aquaria as of 2012. Other species kept in captivity are spotted dolphins, false killer whales, and common dolphins, Commerson&#x27;s dolphins, as well as rough-toothed dolphins, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. Also, fewer than ten pilot whales, Amazon river dolphins, Risso&#x27;s dolphins, spinner dolphins, or tucuxi are in captivity. Two unusual and very rare hybrid dolphins, known as wolphins, are kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii, which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a false killer whale. Also, two common/bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity: one at Discovery Cove and the other at SeaWorld San Diego.

====Controversy====

Organizations such as the Animal Welfare Institute and Whale and Dolphin Conservation campaign against the captivity of dolphins and orcas. SeaWorld faced a lot of criticism after the documentary &quot;Blackfish&quot; was released in 2013.

Aggression among captive orca is common. In August 1989, a dominant female orca, Kandu V, tried to rake a newcomer whale, Corky II, with her mouth during a live show, and smashed her head into a wall. Kandu V broke her jaw, which severed an artery, and then bled to death. In November 2006, a dominant female killer whale, Kasatka, repeatedly dragged experienced trainer Ken Peters to the bottom of the stadium pool during a show after hearing her calf crying for her in the back pools. In February 2010, an experienced female trainer at SeaWorld Orlando, Dawn Brancheau, was killed by orca Tilikum shortly after a show in Shamu Stadium. Tilikum had been associated with the deaths of two people previously. In May 2012, Occupational Safety and Health Administration administrative law judge Ken Welsch cited SeaWorld for two violations in the death of Dawn Brancheau and fined the company a total of US$12,000. Trainers were banned from making close contact with the orca. In April 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied an appeal by SeaWorld.

In 2013, SeaWorld&#x27;s treatment of orca in captivity was the basis of the movie &quot;Blackfish&quot;, which documents the history of Tilikum, an orca captured by SeaLand of the Pacific, later transported to SeaWorld Orlando, which has been involved in the deaths of three people. In the aftermath of the release of the film, Martina McBride, 38 Special, REO Speedwagon, Cheap Trick, Heart, Trisha Yearwood, and Willie Nelson cancelled scheduled concerts at SeaWorld parks. SeaWorld disputes the accuracy of the film, and in December 2013 released an ad countering the allegations and emphasizing its contributions to the study of cetaceans and their conservation.

<doc id="326839" wikidata="Q1193439" url="?curid=326839" title="King Mu of Zhou">
<text>King Mu of Zhou (), personal name Ji Man, was the fifth king of the Zhou dynasty of China. The dates of his reign are 976–922 BC or 956–918 BC.

==Life==
King Mu came to the throne after his father King Zhao’s death during his tour to the South. King Mu was perhaps the most pivotal king of the Zhou dynasty, reigning nearly 55 years, from ca. 976 BC to ca. 922 BC. Mu was more ambitious than wise, yet he was able to introduce reforms that changed the nature of the Zhou government, transforming it from a hereditary system to one that was based on merit and knowledge of administrative skills.

During Mu’s reign, the Zhou dynasty was at its peak, and Mu tried to stamp out invaders in the western part of China and ultimately expand Zhou’s influence to the east. In the height of his passion for conquests, he led an immense army against the Quanrong, who inhabited the western part of China. His travels allowed him to contact many tribes and swayed them to either join under the Zhou banner or be conquered in war with his army. This expedition may have been more of a failure than a success, judging by the fact that he brought back only four white wolves and four white deer. Unintentionally and inadvertently, he thus sowed the seeds of hatred which culminated in an invasion of China by the same tribes in 771 BC. In his thirteenth year the Xu Rong, probably the state of Xu in the southeast, raided near the eastern capital of Fenghao. The war seems to have ended in a truce in which the state of Xu gained land and power in return for nominal submission.

However, despite his success, traditional historiography viewed him with controversy. While some praise his victories against the Quanrong, others criticized him for from his time, the fourth border state no longer entered into a relationship with the Zhou dynasty. Even still, the Shang Shu credited him with establishing the first systematic legal code in China.

Mu was reputed in narratives to have lived until the age of 105 and to have traveled to the mythical mountain known as Kunlun - a popular later work is the &quot;Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven&quot;.

His successor was his son King Gong of Zhou.

==In mythology==

One Chinese myth tells a story about Mu, who dreamed of becoming an immortal. He was determined to visit the divine paradise of Kunlun and taste the Peaches of Immortality. A brave charioteer named Zaofu used his chariot to carry the king to his destination. The &quot;Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven&quot;, a fourth-century BC romance, describes Mu’s visit to the Queen Mother of the West. Late Tang dynasty poet Li Shangyin retold the story in a poem of four lines.

==Automaton==
In the 3rd century BC text of the &quot;Liezi&quot;, there is a curious account on automata involving a much earlier encounter between Mu of Zhou and a mechanical engineer known as Yan Shi, an &#x27;artificer&#x27;. The latter proudly presented the king with a life-size, human-shaped figure of his mechanical &#x27;handiwork&#x27;:
The king stared at the figure in astonishment. It walked with rapid strides, moving its head up and down, so that anyone would have taken it for a live human being. The artificer touched its chin, and it began singing, perfectly in tune. He touched its hand, and it began posturing, keeping perfect time... As the performance was drawing to an end, the robot winked its eye and made advances to the ladies in attendance, whereupon the king became incensed and would have had Yen Shih (Yan Shi) executed on the spot had not the latter, in mortal fear, instantly taken the robot to pieces to let him see what it really was. And, indeed, it turned out to be only a construction of leather, wood, adhesive and lacquer, variously coloured white, black, red and blue. Examining it closely, the king found all the internal organs complete—liver, gall, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, stomach and intestines; and over these again, muscles, bones and limbs with their joints, skin, teeth and hair, all of them artificial... The king tried the effect of taking away the heart, and found that the mouth could no longer speak; he took away the liver and the eyes could no longer see; he took away the kidneys and the legs lost their power of locomotion. The king was delighted.

<doc id="326842" wikidata="Q3853380" url="?curid=326842" title="McGruff the Crime Dog">
<text>McGruff the Crime Dog is an anthropomorphic animated bloodhound created by Dancer Fitzgerald Sample advertising executive Jack Keil (who also voiced the character) through the Ad Council and later the National Crime Prevention Council to increase crime awareness and personal safety in the United States. McGruff costumes are used by police outreach efforts, often with children. McGruff was created in 1979 and debuted in 1980 with a series of public service announcements educating citizens on personal security measures, such as locking doors and putting lights on timers, in order to reduce crime. His name was selected as part of a nationwide contest in July 1980.

McGruff proved to be a successful campaign with over $100 million in free air time donated in the first year reaching over 50% of adults. McGruff campaigns continued over the years to cover topics such as child abduction, robbery, anti-drug messages, and anti-bullying campaigns. From 1982 to 2012, a number of municipalities participated in the McGruff house program which offered temporary haven to children fearing immediate harm. McGruff has continued to be well-recognized, with nine out of ten people recognizing him in a 2021 survey. This is thanks partly to recent campaigns against cyber-bullying, stopping online fakes, and elder-crime.

==History==
===Crime as a public concern===
The decades prior to McGruff&#x27;s creation saw an increase in U.S. public concern over crime. In the 1960s, a number of riots broke out across the U.S. and numerous public figures were assassinated, including President Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X. Accepting the Republican nomination for president, Barry Goldwater positioned crime as one of the biggest issues facing the nation. While Goldwater lost to Lyndon B. Johnson, the issue of crime did not stop there. In July 1965, President Johnson formed the President&#x27;s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice to &quot;probe ... fully and deeply into the problems of crime in our nation.&quot;

After two years and $2.5 million, the Commission delivered its report, &quot;The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society&quot;, in February 1967 which influenced the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The act gave $300 million to local police forces for more personnel and equipment. With the election of Richard Nixon in 1968, the attempts to control rising crime rates shifted from a social approach—the &quot;War on Poverty&quot;—to a tough on crime approach—the &quot;War on Crime&quot;. Despite Nixon&#x27;s attempts (until his resignation in 1974), crime continued to rise from 363.5 crimes per 100,000 people in 1970 to 549.5 in 1979. The Carter administration took the focus away from crime and onto nuclear arms control and human rights. During Carter&#x27;s presidency, crime continued to be a concern with the &quot;kill for thrill murders&quot; of 1979, when two men killed four people over eight days in Western Pennsylvania.

===Creation===
The Ad Council was first approached by the Department of Justice in 1977 to create a public campaign to engage the public in reducing crime. The FBI director recommended a campaign playing on fears to convince citizens to take personal safety steps, but the Ad Council rejected their proposal believing it would largely be ignored by an already frightened public. However, the Ad Council was still interested in a crime prevention campaign. Leo Perlis, a member of the Ad Council&#x27;s Public Policy Committee, heard the proposal and liked the idea. He met with FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley, the head of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, and a board member of the National Sheriffs&#x27; Association to form a coalition to direct the ad campaign.

The Ad Council gave the creative responsibilities to Dancer Fitzgerald Sample who they had previously worked with on the Keep America Beautiful campaign. On February 8, 1979, the Ad Council&#x27;s board of directors held a meeting where they and public officials met to listen to data Dancer Fitzgerald Sample had compiled. Dancer Fitzgerald Sample had conducted focus groups in a number of cities to determine public perceptions on crime. The focus groups found that the public believed police should be the ones to prevent crime, but that they were unwilling to pay more in taxes to support more officers. They recommended a campaign which would &quot;emphasize that individual actions can reduce crime&quot; and &quot;offer easily accessible opportunities for people to participate.&quot;

The task was given to Jack Keil, executive vice president and creative director of Dancer Fitzgerald Sample. Keil, thinking of Smokey Bear, came up with the idea of an animal mascot. After coming up with the slogan—&quot;Take a bite out of crime&quot;—he settled upon the idea of a dog. His first version was &quot;a Snoopy look-alike wearing a Keystone Cop hat.&quot; His creative team however did not believe the dog would be taken seriously. In response, he gave the team a day to come up with a new version.

Five teams of two—a copywriter and an art director—produced proposals. They rejected proposals included a bulldog version of J. Edgar Hoover, a golden retriever, an &quot;aggressive-looking deputy dog&quot;, and a &quot;mongrel who became a wonder dog&quot;. The proposal Keil selected, which would go on to become McGruff, was a talking dog in a trench coat produced by Sherry Nemmers and Ray Krivascy who &quot;was tired...he had seen the world, and he had epitomized all the detectives we had seen from Raymond Chandler to Dashiell Hammett and even Columbo.&quot;

While lauded by Keil, the U.S. Department of Justice was less enthused by the idea of a talking dog as the spokesman for crime prevention. By 1979, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA), created by President Johnson, was being criticized for its wastefulness prompting President Carter to shut down the program. The public safety outreach, part of the LEAA, was one of the few programs saved by Robert Diegelman who was tasked with dismantling the LEAA. Diegelman saw value in the public outreach effort and so sent monthly reports to his superiors in order to assuage their concerns. Despite this, Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti criticised the effort saying: &quot;Why has the LEAA gotten into a campaign that is spending good money on a talking dog?&quot; Civiletti ordered the campaign be shut down, but the advertisements had already been distributed to the media and were set to run.

In November 1979, the dog was introduced at a press conference in New York City with his slogan &quot;Take a bite out of crime.&quot; Eight months later, in July 1980, a nationwide contest to name the dog was concluded. &quot;McGruff the Crime Dog&quot; was selected as the winner with &quot;Shurlocked Homes&quot; as the runner-up. The winning name was submitted by Officer John Isbell of the New Orleans Police Department.

===Initial impact===
McGruff was the first Ad Council campaign to be independently evaluated. Garrett O&#x27;Keefe of the University of Denver was given a grant of $900,000 by the Justice Department&#x27;s National Institute of Justice in order to evaluate the campaign. O&#x27;Keefe found that &quot;media response to the campaign was excellent. More than $100 million of [ad] time and space had been donated by mid-1981, making McGruff one of the most popular Ad Council campaigns.&quot; As a result of the advertisements, over 1 million free booklets had been distributed, and another 250,000 were purchased from the Government Printing Office. The Army printed 300,000 booklets for their own programs as well.

By the end of 1981, over 50% of Americans had seen at least one McGruff advertisement with one third reporting they had seen the advertisements more than ten times. The dominant medium of exposure was television advertisements, comprising 78% of views, followed by posters and billboards at 14%, and newspapers at 8%. While the demographics of exposure were notably diverse, there were some trends in who saw the ads more often than others. The ads were found to reach demographics prone to crime—men, youth, people with less stable residences, and those living in lower-working-class neighborhoods—slightly more often than those populations less prone to crime. Of those who had seen the advertisements, 88% were able to articulate what they were &quot;trying to get across&quot; with 28% pointing out the advertisements&#x27; goals of getting citizens to participate in crime prevention programs and reporting crime to the police.

O&#x27;Keefe also asked some questions related to public perception of McGruff. He found that only 3% disliked McGruff, most calling him &quot;too cutesy&quot;, while 57% liked him for being &quot;attention-getting, clever, different, or appealing to all ages.&quot; 36% of respondents were neutral to McGruff. 8% said that they were annoyed by the commercials while 59% said that they were &quot;pleased&quot; by them.

In order to assess the impact of the McGruff advertisements, O&#x27;Keefe surveyed adults in 1979 and in 1981, a year before and a year after the premiere of the first McGruff advertisement. Of the forty personal security measures that McGruff advertisements recommended, only seven were explicitly mentioned in TV advertisements: locking doors, leaving outdoor lights on, putting indoor lights on timers, asking neighbors to watch your house, watching the neighborhood, reporting suspicious activity, and forming community groups to prevent crime. Of those seven, six saw a significant increase in usage by the public after seeing McGruff advertisements. The only activity not to see an increase was locking doors, despite the first McGruff spot specifically advocating this. O&#x27;Keefe hypothesizes that this is due to a plateau effect, as 75% of respondents in 1979 already reported locking their doors; the only personal security measure not mentioned in a television advertisement to see a significant increase was getting a dog.

==Campaigns==

McGruff debuted in 1980 with television, newspaper, billboard, and radio advertisements. The Ad Council and the National Crime Prevention Council still use McGruff in national campaigns to raise awareness about crime and crime prevention strategies. About 1500 law enforcement agencies use McGruff costumes as part of their outreach efforts in communities. McGruff advertisements feature a &quot;fulfillment strategy&quot;, a means of contact for more information. Early advertisements contained PO boxes that could be written to for more information, but now contain phone numbers and websites.

McGruff was well received in the 1980s, and current campaigns are similarly recognizable. In a survey done by Harris Interactive for the National Crime Prevention Council, McGruff was known by 9 in 10 adults, teens, and children once being prompted; about 3 in 4 adults, 8 in 10 teens, and 8 in 10 children recognized McGruff without being prompted. Respondents were asked how likely they were to take McGruff&#x27;s advice. Children were found to be very receptive, with 8 in 10 responding they were likely to take his advice. 7 in 10 teens and 6 in 10 adults gave similar responses.

===Initial campaign===
The first McGruff campaign featured three television and radio advertisements as well as billboards and posters. The campaign focused on raising awareness of the ability for citizens to help prevent crime through personal security steps, community awareness, and reporting crimes in progress.

The first television advertisement, &quot;Stop a Crime&quot;, debuted in February 1980. The full 60-second advertisement features McGruff (voiced by Jack Keil) entering an unlocked house and telling the viewer, &quot;All crime needs is a chance. Don&#x27;t give it a chance&quot; before giving tips on preventive measures. These measures included locking doors, turning on exterior lights, securing windows, asking neighbors to watch the house during long absences, and putting lights on timers.

The advertisement was followed by two more which focused on community crime prevention tactics: &quot;The Gilstraps&quot; and &quot;Mimi Marth&quot;. In &quot;The Gilstraps&quot;, McGruff is backgrounded by men loading furniture into a moving truck. McGruff points out that these are actually thieves stealing from the home of the titular Gilstraps. The camera cuts to the Gilstraps&#x27; neighbors who, knowing the Gilstraps are out of town, call the police.

In order to show the effectiveness of community watch, McGruff creator Sherry Nemmers selected actual Hartford resident Mimi Marth for the advertisement which now bears her name. &quot;Mimi Marth&quot; shows Marth and another watch member, Albert Bell, responding to crimes in progress by reporting them to police on their radios. McGruff tells the viewer that &quot;There&#x27;s 126 of them, regular people like you and me, working against crime.&quot;

In addition to advertising and media campaigns, a costume was created for in-person appearances. Approximately 1,500 state and local law enforcement agencies use officers wearing a McGruff costume to educate children and others about crime prevention.

===Addressing kidnapping, drugs, gun violence, and online fakes===
The National Crime Prevention Council hired their first president and CEO, Jack Calhoun. Calhoun wanted to address the roots of crime saying, &quot;At some point, I have to step out from my locked house and barred windows.&quot; Current plans are to introduce McGruff to a new generation and to have the Crime Dog become a watchdog to combat new criminal and 21st Century online crime. &quot;A greater investment in community interventions will help take a bite out of violent crime,&quot; said Paul DelPonte, current head of the National Crime Prevention Council. &quot;Strategies that increase public engagement in public safety are proven crime stoppers.&quot; DelPonte also has urged public health officials to use McGruff and crime prevention in health prevention programs.

NCPC and McGruff are currently working with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to combat the sale of fake products online. The campaign, &quot;You&#x27;re Smart. Buy Smart.&quot;, premiered the first television ads featuring McGruff in 3D animation in August 2022. The ads, filmed on the lot of Jim Henson Studios in Hollywood, are also in Spanish. Among the largest campaigns in the Crime Dog&#x27;s lengthy career, it includes a partnership with NASCAR and featured a new car with driver Joey Gase.

In December 2021, the animated television show &quot;Family Guy&quot; featured McGruff and the National Crime Prevention Council on preventing kidnapping. The re-emergence of McGruff generated an outpouring of fan support.

In April 2022, the National Crime Prevention Council announced a partnership with McGruff the Crime Dog in creating Fentanyl Prevention Awareness Day scheduled for August 21, 2022. In October of the same year, the organization launched livesproject.org, a digital remembrance quilt to honor victims and to raise awareness of the problem.

===McGruff Houses and trucks===
The McGruff House program was a program that designated temporary safe havens for children in emergency situations. The program was first created in Utah in 1982 in response to the abduction and murder of five children by Arthur Gary Bishop. Owners of houses and apartments, after clearing a background check, would display a sign in their window with the image of McGruff. Children would be educated at school and community events to go to these houses when they felt threatened or in need of help.

The program operated under the motto &quot;we&#x27;ll call for help&quot; and emphasized its use as a temporary haven. Volunteers were trained to call the appropriate authorities in emergency situations and would provide emotional support to children in danger. The program made clear that volunteers were for emergency situations, and even in such situations, volunteers would not act as escorts or provide first aid &quot;except in extreme emergency situations and then only if qualified.&quot;

The first McGruff truck was established in Utah in 1986. A utility company asked that its trucks be designated as &quot;rolling McGruff Houses&quot; and were approved. The program was extended to other companies and municipalities, and in 2006 there were over 170 participants. In February 2012, the McGruff House program was ended after nearly 30 years. The program was ended because, with the advent and growing prominence of cell phones, the need for McGruff Houses declined combined with tightening budgets.

In 2018, the Martin Agency brought back McGruff as part of GEICO Insurance&#x27;s &#x27;count on GEICO&#x27; campaign. The TV spot has an animated McGruff attempting to share his investigation evidence with several human colleagues. They respond by not taking him seriously and treating him like an actual dog with &#x27;baby talk&#x27;, leading to McGruff&#x27;s throwing his paperwork in the air and storming out of the scene.

<doc id="326849" wikidata="Q2609672" url="?curid=326849" title="Army Reserve (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Army Reserve is the active-duty volunteer reserve force of the British Army. It is separate from the Regular Reserve whose members are ex-Regular personnel who retain a statutory liability for service. Descended from the Territorial Force (1908 to 1921), the Army Reserve was known as the Territorial Army (TA) from 1921 to 1967 and again from 1979 to 2014, and the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) from 1967 to 1979.

The force was created in 1908 by the Secretary of State for War, Richard Haldane, when the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 combined the previously civilian-administered Volunteer Force, with the mounted Yeomanry (at the same time the Militia was renamed the Special Reserve).

Haldane planned a volunteer &quot;Territorial Force&quot;, to provide a second line for the six divisions of the Expeditionary Force which he was establishing as the centerpiece of the Regular Army. The Territorial Force was to be composed of fourteen divisions of infantry and fourteen brigades of cavalry, together with all the supporting arms and services needed for overseas war, including artillery, engineers commissariat and medical support. The new Special Reserve was to take over the depots of the militia, as an expanded reserve for the Regular Army. Under multiple political pressures, Haldane altered the public purpose of the Territorial Force in his Territorial and Reserve Forces Act to home defence, at the last moment but did not alter the planned structure. During the First World War, by the end of April 1915, six full Territorial divisions had been deployed into the fight.

Between the wars the Territorial Army (as it was now called) was re-established to be the sole means of expansion in future wars, but it was smaller than before and poorly resourced. Yet eight TA divisions were deployed before the fall of France. After the Second World War, the TA was reconstituted with ten divisions, but then successively cut until rebuilding began in 1970, with numbers peaking at nearly 73,000. It was then run down again despite a major role in the Iraq and Afghanistan operations, bottoming at an estimated 14,000. From 2011 that trend was reversed and a new target of 30,000 trained manpower set with resourcing for training, equipment and the emphasis restored to roles for formed units and sub-units.

During periods of total war, the Army Reserve is incorporated by the royal prerogative into Regular Service under one code of Military Law for the duration of hostilities or until de-activation is decided upon. After the Second World War, for example, the Territorial Army, as it was known then, was not demobilised until 1947. Army Reservists normally have a full-time civilian job or career, which in some cases provides skills and expertise that are directly transferable to a specialist military role, such as NHS employees serving in Reservist Army Medical Services units. All Army Reserve personnel have their civilian jobs protected to a limited extent by law should they be compulsorily mobilised. There is, however, no legal protection against discrimination in employment for membership of the Army Reserve in the normal course of events (i.e. when not mobilised).

==History==
===Origins===

Before the creation of the Territorial force, there were three &quot;auxiliary forces&quot;—the Militia, the Yeomanry, and the Volunteers. All militiamen over 19 could join the Militia Reserve, accepting the liability to serve overseas with the Regular Army in case of war if called on to do so. The second element of the auxiliary forces was the Yeomanry, 38 regiments of volunteer cavalry which had historically been used as a form of internal security police. The third arm was the Volunteers, There were 213 rifle corps and 66 corps of artillery, though the latter were mostly coastal artillery or static &quot;position batteries&quot; and they did not constitute an organised field force. There were some engineer and medical units, but no service corps.

The Yeomen of the 18th century were cavalry-based units, which were often used to suppress riots (see the Peterloo Massacre). Several units that are now part of the Army Reserve bear the title &quot;militia&quot;.

===South African War, the need for reform and formation of the Territorial Force===
In 1899, with the outbreak of the South African War, the British Army was committed to its first large-scale overseas deployment since the 1850s. The Cardwell Reforms of 1868–1872 had reformed the system of enlistment for the Regular Army so that recruits now served for six years with the colours and then a further six years liable for reserve service, with the Regular Reserve. The administrative structure of the Army had been further reinforced by the creation of regimental districts, where regular infantry regiments were paired together to share a depot and linked to the local militia and volunteer units.

The reforms had ensured that a sizable force of regular troops was based in the United Kingdom for service as an expeditionary force, over and above the troops already stationed overseas. However, once the decision was taken to send a corps-size field force to fight in the South African War, the system began to show a strain. By the end of January 1900, seven regular divisions, roughly half of their manpower from the Regular and Militia Reserves, had been dispatched leaving the country virtually empty of regular troops.

This was the end of the planned mobilisation; no thought had been given pre-war to mobilising the Militia, Yeomanry or Volunteers as formed units for foreign service.
On 16 December, the first request was sent from South Africa for auxiliary troops, and a commitment was made to send a &quot;considerable force of militia and picked yeomanry and volunteers&quot;.
The first Volunteer unit to be sent out was a 1,300 man composite battalion group, composed of infantry recruited from across London units and a field battery from the Honourable Artillery Company, the City Imperial Volunteers, which was raised in early January 1900; it was sent into combat after six weeks of training in South Africa, where Lord Roberts described it as &quot;quite excellent&quot;, and was returned home in October.

At the same time, a number of service companies were raised from volunteer units, employed as integral companies of their sister regular battalions, and were well regarded in the field. The decision was taken in late December to form a new force, the Imperial Yeomanry, to consist of mounted infantry. Whilst the Yeomanry provided many of the officers and NCOs, only a small number of the junior ranks came from existing Yeomanry regiments, with some more from Volunteer corps. The units performed well, but recruiting proceeded in fits and starts—recruitment stopped in May, and was only resumed in early 1901—and so an adequate supply of manpower was not always available. Sixty militia battalions, around 46,000 men, also volunteered and were eventually sent to South Africa. They were employed mainly on lines of communication, and regarded as second-line troops of low quality; this was unsurprising, as they were strongly deficient in officers, heavily composed of men of 18 and 19, who were regarded as too young by the Regular Army, with many of their best and most experienced men already deployed with regular units as members of the Militia Reserve.

The dominions and colonies provided 57 contingents, overwhelmingly of volunteer forces as none had a substantial full-time force; those from Canada alone numbered some 7,400 Altogether, Britain and her empire deployed some half a million soldiers.

After the South African War, the Conservative government embarked on a series of reorganisations which had a negative impact on all the auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action was taken.

The Territorial Force was created by the Secretary of State for War, Richard Burdon Haldane, following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force with the Yeomanry. As part of the same process, the remaining units of militia were converted to the Special Reserve. Most Volunteer infantry units had unique identities, but lost these in the reorganisation, becoming Territorial battalions of Regular Army infantry regiments. Only one infantry unit, the London Regiment, has maintained a separate identity.

The TF was formed on 1 April 1908 and contained fourteen infantry divisions, and fourteen mounted yeomanry brigades. It had an overall strength of approximately 269,000. Haldane designed it to provide a much larger second line for the six divisions of the Expeditionary Force which he was establishing as the centerpiece of the Regular Army. Under multiple political pressures, Haldane altered the public purpose of the Territorial Force in his Territorial and Reserve Forces Act to home defence, at the last moment.

===First World War===
Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914. The next day, General - later Field Marshal - Haig, who had been central to Haldane&#x27;s reforms and was then commanding First Corps, recorded in his diary that Field Marshal Kitchener did &#x27;not appreciate the progress made by the Territorial Force towards efficiency&#x27;, The subsequent day, the 6th, Kitchener took up his post as Secretary of State for War announcing that morning &#x27;He could take no account of anything but regular soldiers&#x27;. He went on to denounce the Territorial Force as &#x27;a few hundred thousand young men, officered by middle-aged professional men who were allowed to put on uniform and play at soldiers.&#x27;

Nevertheless, by 9 August, the Army Council, under Kitchener&#x27;s direction, agreed that TF units volunteering en bloc for overseas service should be sent to France, while Kitchener set in hand the machinery for the recruiting of an entirely separate &#x27;New Army&#x27; of what came to be known as Kitchener units, in parallel with the expansion of the Territorial Force. These New Army units were given priority for equipment, recruits and training over the Territorials for the bulk of the war. Kitchener justified this, during the first few months of the war, on the grounds that the Territorial Force should focus mostly on home defence.

In the first few days after the call for overseas service on 9 August, the result in many TF units was hesitant, with some units only recording around 50% volunteering, partly because men with families were reluctant to leave well-paid jobs especially while there was talk of a German invasion of the homeland, but the pace rapidly accelerated and, within a fortnight, 70 infantry battalions and many other units had collectively volunteered for France. initially TF units were either fed into regular brigades or used for secondary tasks, such as guarding lines of communication but, by the end of April 1915, six full Territorial divisions had been deployed into the fight.

The (Regular) Expeditionary Force of six divisions had been rapidly sent to the Continent, where, facing overwhelming odds, they secured the left flank of the French Army. Of the 90,000 members of the original BEF deployed in August, four-fifths were dead or wounded by Christmas. So the arrival of the Territorials, first as reinforcements and then in whole divisions came at a critical juncture, while the New Army was still forming and training. Many of the Territorial units suffered immediate heavy casualties and on the night of 20 April 1915 Second Lieutenant Geoffrey Woolley of the Queen Victoria Rifles, secured the first of the 71 Victoria Crosses won by Territorials in the First World War.

General Sir John French, General Officer Commanding the BEF, later wrote &#x27;Without the assistance which the Territorials afforded between October 1914 and June 1915, it would have been impossible to hold the line in France and Belgium.

Other Territorial formations were dispatched to Egypt and British India and other imperial garrisons, such as Gibraltar, thereby releasing regular units for service in France and enabling the formation of an additional five regular army divisions by early 1915. Territorial divisions went on to fight in all the major battles of the war in France and Belgium and several campaigns further afield including Gallipoli. (See main article Territorial Force).

From 1916, as the war progressed, and casualties mounted, the distinctive character of territorial units was diluted by the inclusion of conscript and New Army drafts. Following the Armistice all units of the Territorial Force were gradually disbanded.

===Interwar re-establishment and mobilisation in 1939===
The Territorial Force (TF) was officially reconstituted in 1921 by the Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921 and renamed in October as the Territorial Army (TA). The First-Line divisions (that were created in 1907 or 1908) were reconstituted in that year. The TA&#x27;s intended role was to be the sole method of expanding the size of the British Armed Forces, when compared to the varied methods used during the First World War including the creation of Kitchener&#x27;s Army. All TA recruits were required to take the general service obligation: if the British Government decided, territorial soldiers could be deployed overseas for combat that avoided the complications of the TF, whose members were not required to leave Britain unless they volunteered for overseas service.

The composition of the divisions was altered, with a reduction in the number of infantry battalions required. There was also a reduced need for cavalry, and of the 55 yeomanry regiments, only the 14 most senior retained their horses. The remaining yeomanry was converted to artillery or armored car units or disbanded. The amalgamation of 40 pairs of infantry battalions was announced in October 1921. As part of the post-war &quot;Geddes Axe&quot; financial cuts, the TA was further reduced in size in 1922: artillery batteries lost two of their six guns, the established size of infantry battalions was cut and ancillary medical, veterinary, signals and Royal Army Service Corps units were either reduced in size or abolished. The bounty was also reduced to £3 for trained men and £2.10s 0d for recruits, which resulted in finding £1,175,000 of the total savings required from the army as a whole. An innovation in 1922 was the creation of two Air Defence Brigades to provide anti-aircraft defence for London. It appears that these two brigades relatively quickly became 26th and 27th Air Defence Brigades.

During the 1930s, tensions increased between Germany and the United Kingdom and its allies. In late 1937 and throughout 1938, German demands for the annexation of Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia led to an international crisis. To avoid war, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler in September and brokered the Munich Agreement. The agreement averted a war and allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland. Although Chamberlain had intended the agreement to lead to a further peaceful resolution of issues, relations between both countries soon deteriorated. On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying the remnants of the Czech state.

On 29 March, Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha announced plans to increase the TA from 130,000 to 340,000 men and double the number of TA divisions. The plan was for existing TA units to recruit over their establishments (aided by an increase in pay for Territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion which had hindered recruiting, construction of better-quality barracks and an increase in supper rations) and then form second-line divisions from cadres that could be increased. The total strength of the TA was to be 440,000: the field force of the Territorial Army was to rise from 130,000 to 340,000, organized in 26 divisions, while an additional 100,000 all ranks would form the anti-aircraft section. The forming Second Line formations were given liberty to be numbered and named as they saw fit, with some using related names and numbers from the First World War e.g. 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division formed in 1939.

The immediate response to this announcement was a vast surge in recruiting with 88,000 men enlisted by the end of April. The London Rifle Brigade raised a second battalion in 24 hours. On 26 April, limited conscription was introduced. This resulted in 34,500 twenty-year-old militiamen being conscripted into the regular army, initially to be trained for six months before deployment to the forming second-line units. In parallel, recruits continued to surge into the Territorial Army but there were grave shortages of instructors and equipment. It was envisioned that the duplicating process and recruiting the required numbers of men would take no more than six months. In practice, existing TA units found themselves stripped of regular training staffs and often many of their own officers and NCOs to form and train the new units, long before their own units were fully trained. As a result, some TA divisions had made little progress by the time the Second World War began; others, who had started from a stronger position, were able to complete this work within a matter of weeks.

===Second World War===
The TA&#x27;s war deployment plan envisioned the divisions being deployed, as equipment became available, in waves to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) that had already been dispatched to Europe. The TA would join regular army divisions when they had completed their training. In 1938, it was envisaged that this would take at least eight months from mobilisation. In fact, with mobilisation in September 1939, the first three TA divisions arrived to take their places in the front line by February 1940: the 48th (South Midland) Division, 50th (Northumbrian) Division and 51st (Highland) Division. In April, they were joined by five more, 12th (Eastern) Division, 23rd (2nd Northumbrian) Division, 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, 44th (Home Counties) Division and 46th (North Midland) Division, making eight of the thirteen British divisions deployed, although three, 12th, 23rd, and 46th, were deployed, minus much of their equipment, as so-called &#x27;digging divisions&#x27; to be used for infrastructure work.

In practice, all of the divisions were heavily engaged in the fighting. The 42nd, 44th, and 48th took part in the stand on the River Escaut, The 50th, 42nd, and 46th were chosen for the final stand at the perimeter of Dunkirk, despite the 46th being one of the digging&quot; divisions with few anti-tank guns and artillery pieces. A London TA battalion, the Queen Victoria&#x27;s Rifles deployed at Calais and fought off German reconnaissance forces before the arrival of the two regular sister battalions with whom they held the town for two crucial days shielding the Dunkirk evacuation.

Further south, The 51st fought in a rearguard action with the largely French forces along the Somme. At the same time, a small TA unit, the Kent Fortress Royal Engineers, carried out the first major commando-style operations of the war the XD Operations, destroying 2 million tons of crude and refined oil, along the coastline of France and the low countries.

Meanwhile, units with little training and cohesion were also sent abroad, despite their lack of preparation; the TA units which formed a majority of those which took part in the Narvik operation were untrained and had been subject to such turbulence, through expansion and reorganisation that many lacked cohesion. The failures of command, coordination and execution in that campaign led to a debate on its conduct with a no-confidence vote in the government. Partially as a result of lessons from Narvik, the Territorial Army was ordered to form 10 elite Independent Companies, forerunners of the Commandos. under the command of (then) Lt Colonel Colin Gubbins.

As the war developed Territorial units fought in every major theatre. The first reinforcing unit into Kohima, where the Japanese suffered their first major defeat in mainland Asia, was a TA unit, 4th Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment who went on to hold the Tennis Court in some of the hardest fighting of the battle. Later the commander of the 14th Army, of which they were part, Field Marshal Slim, himself a pre-First World War Territorial became Chief of the Imperial General Staff and a strong promoter of the TA, coining the expression still in use today that Territorials are &#x27;twice a citizen&#x27;. One pre-war Guards reservist, (then) Major David Stirling set up the Special Air Service, in North Africa, which fathered several other special forces units, including the Special Boat Service.

After VJ Day in August 1945, the Territorial Army was reduced and re-structured.

====List of Territorial Army Divisions, Second World War====


===Postwar and Cold War===
In 1947, the TA was restructured and expanded through the reactivation of some of the 1st Line divisions that were initially disbanded after the war, keeping its former role of supplying complete divisions to the regular Army until 1967. For the first time, TA units were formed in Northern Ireland. The maneuver divisions established or re-established in 1947 were:

* 16th Airborne Division, under the command of Major-General Robert E. &quot;Roy&quot; Urquhart
* 42nd (Lancashire) Infantry Division
* 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division
* 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division
* 49th (West Riding &amp; North Midland) Armoured Division (49th (West Riding and North Midland) Division/District in 1961)
* 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division (50th Northumbrian District by 1966)
* 51st/52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division
* 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division
* 56th (London) Armoured Division

52nd (Lowland) Division was re-established as a tenth, &#x27;mixed&#x27; division in March 1950.

The territorials also provided much of the anti-aircraft cover for the United Kingdom until 1956. In that year, Anti-Aircraft Command and 15 anti-aircraft regiments of the Royal Artillery were disbanded, with nine others passing into &quot;suspended animation&quot; as new English Electric Thunderbird Surface to Air Missile units replaced them. On 20 December 1955, the Secretary of State for War informed the House of Commons that the armoured divisions and the &#x27;mixed&#x27; division were to be converted to infantry, and the 16th Airborne Division reduced to a parachute brigade group. Only two divisions (43rd and 53rd), two armoured brigades, and a parachute brigade were to remain allocated for NATO and the defence of Western Europe; the other eight divisions were placed on a lower establishment for home defence only. The territorial units of the Royal Armoured Corps were also reduced in number to nine armoured regiments and eleven reconnaissance regiments. This was effected by the amalgamation of pairs of regiments, and the conversion of four RAC units to an infantry role. The new parachute brigade group become the 44th Independent Parachute Brigade Group.

British forces contracted dramatically as the end of conscription in 1960 came in sight as announced in the 1957 Defence White Paper. On 20 July 1960, a reorganisation of the TA was announced in the House of Commons. The territorials were to be reduced from 266 fighting units to 195. There was to be a reduction of 46 regiments of the Royal Artillery, 18 battalions of infantry, 12 regiments of the Royal Engineers and two regiments of the Royal Corps of Signals. The reductions were carried out in 1961, mainly by amalgamating units. Thus, on 1 May 1961, the TA divisional headquarters were merged with regular army districts, which were matched with Civil Defence Regions to aid mobilisation for war.

The Army Reserve Act of April 1962 made provision for a new TA Emergency Reserve (TAER), within existing TA units, who could be called out without Royal Proclamation as individuals to reinforce regular units around the world, for up to six months in every twelve. With opposition from employers and individuals to such a large peacetime liability, the target of 15,000 volunteers proved over-ambitious and the force peaked at 4,262 in October 1963, then dropping to around 2,400 by 1968. Nevertheless, the first batch of these so-called &#x27;Ever Readies&#x27; was sent to Libya in 1963, followed by 200 to the Far East later that year. In 1965, 175 were called out, the majority deploying to Aden, where one of their officers, Lieutenant Mike Smith, won an MC.

====1966 White Paper: major cuts and a new name====
This was followed by a large reduction and complete reorganisation, announced in the 1966 Defence White Paper and implemented from 1 April 1967, when the title Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) was adopted. This abolished the former divisional structure of the TA. The size of the TAVR was to be reduced from 107,000 to under 50,000, with the infantry reduced from 86 to 13 battalions and the yeomanry (armoured units) from 20 to one. Units in the new TAVR were divided into various categories:

* TAVR I - Special Army Volunteer Reserve or &#x27;Ever Readies&#x27;, echoing the earlier nickname for the TAER, bringing the Regular Army to war establishment and replacing casualties. These were to be given extra training and equipment and could now be called out by Queen&#x27;s Order rather than Royal Proclamation in anticipation of war and

* TAVR II - forces called &#x27;The Volunteers&#x27;, for whom the old call-out arrangements continued. This category was split further split into TAVR IIA (Independent), e.g.: 51st Highland Volunteers and TAVR IIB (Sponsored), e.g.: Central Volunteer Headquarters, Royal Artillery.

In addition were various miscellaneous units, such as OTCs and bands e.g. Northumbria Band of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

In the face of a considerable Parliamentary battle, and a public outcry led by the County Associations, the government agreed to retain an additional 28,000 men in 87 &#x27;lightly armed&#x27; infantry units and a few signals units in a category called TAVR III, designed for home defence, but, months later in January 1968, these were all earmarked to be disbanded, with 90 becoming eight-man &quot;cadres&quot;. In November that year, the call-out arrangements for TAVR II units were brought in line with TAVR I.

====Rebuilding capability and exercising roles====
In 1971, the new government decided to expand the TAVR which led to the formation of twenty infantry battalions based on some of these cadres. In 1979, again, a new government planned further expansion. In the Reserve Forces Act of 1982, the Territorial Army title was restored, and, in the following years, its size was again increased, together with new equipment and extra training, the target being 86,000 by 1990. Some brigades were re-formed which consisted mostly of TA units, including two out of three brigades for a new reserve division for the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). In addition, a new organisation was established, the Home Service Force, with a separate target of 4,500, composed of older ex-regulars and territorials to guard key points.

As the Cold War intensified, the scale and pace of exercises involving the TA in its war roles increased. Two large-scale exercises were mounted testing the Army&#x27;s ability to reinforce BAOR, Crusader in 1980 and Lionheart in 1984. The latter involved 131,000 British service personnel, including 35,000 Territorials, together with US, Dutch and German personnel. This was the largest British troop movement exercise by sea and air since 1945, involving 290 flights and 150 ferry sailings. Most UK-based units reached their wartime stations within 48 hours.

In 1985, Exercise Brave Defender tested Britain&#x27;s home defences, with 65,000 regulars and territorials involved.

===1988 to 2011: Reduced again but back on operations===
At the end of the Cold War, the TA had a strength of 72,823, including 3,297 in the Home Service Force (HSF). in the 1991 Gulf War 205 Scottish General Hospital was mobilised as a unit based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and a number of TA staff officers and others volunteered and served during the conflict, either in supporting roles in Germany or within 1 (UK) Armoured Division in the Middle East.

In December 1991, as part of the reductions in Options for Change, it was announced that the TA&#x27;s establishment was to be reduced to 63,000, while the HSF element was to be disbanded. In July 1994, this was further reduced to 59,000.

The Reserve Forces Act of May 1996 was a landmark reform, making it much easier to call out any element of the Reserves at the behest of the Secretary of State for a range of purposes including &#x27;protection of life or property&#x27; well short of the criteria for Queen&#x27;s Order (e.g. &#x27;great emergency&#x27;, &#x27;imminent national danger&#x27;). It also provides protection in employment law for members&#x27; civilian jobs should they be mobilised. This has led to the Army Reserve increasingly providing routine support for the Regular Army overseas including the delivery of composite units to release regular units from standing liabilities; including Bosnia, Kosovo, Cyprus and the Falkland Islands. Some 2,800 TA personnel volunteered for and deployed on Operation Resolute from 1995 to 1998, the UK&#x27;s contribution to the NATO mission to enforce peace in the Former Yugoslavia. These were a mixture of formed units and individuals.

In Tony Blair&#x27;s Strategic Defence Review of 1998, the TA&#x27;s size was reduced to 41,200.

In 2003, 9,500 reservists were mobilised to take part in Operation TELIC, the invasion of Iraq. Reservists were deployed in a mixture of formed bodies and as individuals. For example, a formed sub-unit from 131 Commando Squadron Royal Engineers opened up a beach landing point on the Al Faw Peninsula and then two further crossing points on sequential watercourses for tanks in the attack on Basra. The Royal Yeomanry mobilised Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) and two sub-units
to deliver the UK&#x27;s Chemical, Radiological, Biological, and Nuclear counter-measures for Operation TELIC. At the peak in 2004, reservists made up 20% of Britain&#x27;s strength in Iraq.

In Afghanistan too, large numbers of reservists deployed in a mixture of formed units and as individuals, until 2009 when the decision was taken to allow only individuals to deploy as reinforcements for regular units. One example of a formed body was Somme Company of The London regiment of whom Brigadier (later Lieutenant-General Sir) John Lorimer remarked: &quot;Somme Company was an outstanding body of men: well trained, highly motivated and exceptionally well led.&quot; Approximately 1,200 members of the Army Reserve deployed annually on tours of duty in Iraq, Operation HERRICK in Afghanistan and elsewhere, normally on six-month-long roulements. Medical personnel were routinely deployed as formed units and individual augmentees since the start of operations in Iraq and, since 2003, Reserves provided over 40% of the hospital-based personnel for operations in Afghanistan and provided the &#x27;lead unit&#x27; for 50% of the operational tours.

By 2011, across Iraq and Afghanistan, a number of reservists had been decorated and 27 had given their lives.

===2011: Rebuilding and named the Army Reserve===
In 2010, the government set up a commission, chaired by General Sir Nicholas Houghton, to review the state of the reserves and to design their future. The commission reported in July 2011. It found that, despite their operational commitments, the reserves had been neglected: some estimates put its trained and active strength as low as 14,000. There had been &#x27;a failure to resource recruiting and good training, especially collective training; to offer career progression; to update operational roles; to permit deployment in formed sub-units and therefore offer command opportunities&#x27; Its recommendations included that a new target of 30,000 trained strength by 2020 be set.

The government published the report on 18 July with an immediate promise of £1.5 billion funding over ten years. In October 2012 MoD announced a new name for the Territorial Army, its current name, the Army Reserve. Most of the recommendations of the commission were adopted in the White Paper July 2013 including the critical importance of providing operational and training opportunities for formed units and sub-units.

Some aspects required legislation and were introduced in the Defence Reform Act (2014). These included the name change, reforms in mobilisation arrangements and in employer compensation. They also included giving the Reserve Forces and Cadets Associations the power to produce an annual report to Parliament on the state of the volunteer reserves (the Royal Naval Reserve, The Royal Marines Reserve, the Army Reserve and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force). In January 2021, the Army Reserve trained strength stood at 26,820. (This figure excludes recruits undergoing phase 1 training and various non-deployable categories such as University Officers&#x27; Training Corps). During 2020, two reserve infantry battalions, 6 and 7 Rifles, provided the framework battalion for peacekeeping in Cyprus and over the winter 20/21 the Royal Yeomanry provided a composite squadron for a six-month tour on armoured reconnaissance as part of Britain&#x27;s forward presence in Estonia.

Army Reservists have a minimum commitment to serve 27 training days per year or 19 days for some national units. This period normally includes a two-week period of continuous training either as an Army Reserve unit, on courses or attached to a Regular unit. Army Reserve soldiers are paid at a similar rate as their regular equivalents while engaged on military activities.

==Basic training==
===Soldiers===

For Army Reserve soldiers, recruit training is structured into two phases: Phase 1, also known as the Common Military Syllabus (Recruit) (CMS(R)), and Phase 2, specialist training.

Phase 1

In Phase 1, recruits cover the Common Military Syllabus (Reserve)14 (CMS(R)14). Phase 1 A is a series of 4 training weekends at regional Army Training Units (ATUs), or the recruit could attend a consolidated Phase 1 A week long course. Phase 1 training concludes with a 16-day long Phase 1 B training course normally held at the Army Training Centre Pirbright or the Army Training Regiment, Winchester, or Grantham. Recruits to the 4th Battalion, The Parachute Regiment and the Honourable Artillery Company complete their equivalent of CMS(R) within their own units.

Phase 2

Phase 1 is followed by Phase 2, a further period of specialist training specific to the type of unit the recruit is joining. This is normally conducted by the Arm or Service that the recruit is joining; for example, for infantry units, Phase 2 consists of the two-week Combat Infantryman&#x27;s Course (TA) (CIC (TA)) held at the Infantry Training Centre, Catterick.

===Officers===

To gain a commission, Potential Officers have to pass the two stages of the Army Officer Selection Board (AOSB) and then successfully complete four modules of training, which together form the Army Reserve Commissioning Course. For professionally qualified officers (doctors, vets, lawyers etc.), there is only one stage at the AOSB.

Module A consists of basic field training and elementary military skills. This can be completed at either a UOTC over a number of weekends or over 2 weeks at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (RMAS).

Module B covers training in Tactics, Leadership, Doctrine and Navigation, both in theory and in practice, with a focus on the section battle drills and the platoon combat estimate. This training can either be spread over 10 weekends at a UOTC, or 2 weeks at the RMAS.

Module C builds on the Tactics, Leadership, Doctrine, and Navigation taught in Module B, with a greater focus on the theory behind these constructs. CBRN training is also added at this point, and Officer Cadets undergo a number of field exercises to test their military and leadership skills. Module C can only be undertaken at the RMAS.

Module D Once the Officer Cadet has completed their Army Officer Selection Board, they can complete this final module, after which they will become commissioned officers in the British Army. Based at the RMAS, this module consists primarily of a prolonged field exercise, followed by drill training in preparation for the passing out parade.

On successful completion of Module D, the Officer Cadets receive their Commission and become Second Lieutenants. Further training that is required prior to them being considered for operational deployment and promotion to Lieutenant includes:

Post Commissioning Training (formerly known as Module 5), again run at an OTC, over 3 weekends.

Special To Arm training is specific to the type of unit the Subaltern is joining and covers a 2-week period. This is increasingly integrated with the tactics phase of a Regular training course. For example, the Platoon Commander&#x27;s Battle Course held at the Infantry Battle School in Brecon which is integrated within a Regular training course, or the Light Cavalry Commander&#x27;s Course held at the Reconnaissance &amp; Armoured Tactics Division in Warminster which is run separately to Regular training courses.

<text>Situated learning is a theory that explains an individual&#x27;s acquisition of professional skills and includes research on apprenticeship into how legitimate peripheral participation leads to membership in a community of practice. Situated learning &quot;takes as its focus the relationship between learning and the social situation in which it occurs&quot;.

The theory is distinguished from alternative views of learning which define learning as the acquisition of propositional knowledge. Lave and Wenger situated learning in certain forms of social co-participation and instead of asking what kinds of cognitive processes and conceptual structures are involved, they focused on the kinds of social engagements that provide the proper context and facilitate learning.

== Overview ==
Situated learning was first proposed by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger as a model of learning in a community of practice. At its simplest, situated learning is learning that takes place in the same context in which it is applied. For example, the workplace is considered as a discernible community of practice operating as a context wherein newcomers assimilate norms, behavior, values, relationships, and beliefs.

Lave and Wenger (1991) argues that learning is a social process whereby knowledge is co-constructed; they suggest that such learning is situated in a specific context and embedded within a particular social and physical environment.

Against the prevalent view of learning that involves the cognitive process in which individuals are respectively engaged in as learners, Lave and Wenger viewed learning as participation in the social world, suggesting learning as an integral and inseparable aspect of social practice. In their view, learning is the process by which newcomers become part of a community of practice and move toward full participation in it. Learners&#x27; participation in the community of practice always entails situated negotiation and renegotiation of meaning in the world. They understand and experience the world through the constant interactions by which they reconstruct their identity (i.e., becoming a different person) and evolve the form of their membership in the community as the relations between newcomers and old-timers who share the social practice change. In their view, motivation is situated because learners are naturally motivated by their growing value of participation and their desires to become full practitioners.

Lave and Wenger assert that situated learning &quot;is not an educational form, much less a pedagogical strategy&quot;. However, since their writing, others have advocated different pedagogies that include experiential and situated activity:
* Workshops, kitchens, greenhouses and gardens used as classrooms
* Stand-up role playing in the real-world setting, including most military training (much of which, though, takes a behaviorist approach)
* Field trips including archaeological digs and participant-observer studies in an alien culture
* On the job training including apprenticeship and cooperative education
* Sports practice, music practice, and art are situated learning by definition, as the exact actions in the real setting are those of practice – with the same equipment or instruments

Many of the original examples from Lave and Wenger concerned adult learners, and situated learning still has a particular resonance for adult education. For example, Hansman shows how adult learners discover, shape, and make explicit their own knowledge through situated learning within a community of practice.

== History ==
In the 2003 article &quot;The Nature of Situated Learning&quot;, Paula Vincini argued that &quot;the theory behind situated learning or situated cognition arises from the fields of psychology, anthropology, sociology, and cognitive science.&quot; She summarized:

In 1996 John R. Anderson et al. had traced back the origin of the concept to the &quot;cognitive revolution&quot; in the 1960s, They argued:
Vincini (2003) continued to explain, that &quot;the social interaction that occurs in communities of practice between experts and novices is crucial to the theory of situated cognition or learning. In &quot;Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation,&quot; Lave and Wenger emphasize that novices begin learning by observing members of the community and then slowly move from the periphery of the community to fully participating members.&quot;

== Elements ==
Put in terms developed by William Rankin, the major elements in situated learning are content (facts and processes of a task), context (situations, values, environmental cues), and community (the group where the learner will create and negotiate). Situated learning also involves participation (where a learner works together with others in order to solve a problem).

Situated learning deals with how one&#x27;s knowledge develops over the course of an activity and how they create and interpret.

Content:
In situated learning, no importance is given to the retention of the content. Rather, situated learning stresses reflective and higher-order thinking where the results are used in solving problems faced in daily life. Situated learning is thus more application-based.

Context:
Context provides a framework for the usage of the product or the result at the right time, place, and situation in the social, psychological and material environment. Context creates a platform to examine the learning experiences.

Community:
Community helps the learner to create, interpret, reflect and form meanings. It provides opportunities to share experiences among learners and also to interact.

Participation:
It is where the interchange of ideas, problem-solving and engagement of the learners take place. This takes place in a social setting which includes reflecting, interpreting, and negotiating among the participants of the community.
== Claims ==
Situated learning means to have a thought and action which is used at the right time and place. In this approach, the content is learned through doing activities. It is dilemma-driven, it challenges the intellectual and psychomotor skills of a learner. Situated learning contributes to bringing about the relationship between classroom situations and real-life situations outside the classroom. 
In adult classroom, the conditions are so created that it is complex and unclear, from which they gain experiences and they learn.
There are four claims by Brown, Collins, and Dugid:
* Action is grounded in the concrete situations in which it occurs.
* Knowledge does not transfer between tasks.
* Training by abstraction is of little use.
* Learning is a social phenomenon.

== Implications of these claims for instruction ==

* To provide authenticated tasks in the learning environment: It is said that authenticated task involves two stages that are an objective and data in the setting also to the level of which students are performing the tasks which are authenticated.
* Simulated apprenticeship: Students can become apprentices in a given discipline by gaining knowledge and skills.
* Anchored instructions: It emphasizes the conditions laid by situated learning. It gives a situated context to solve the problem.
* Learning communities: Change of the classroom culture from more of knowledge supplying to a learning community where students focus on knowledge building and solve problems that they are interested in.
* Assessment in appropriate place: It shows an individual&#x27;s performance in different situations and also focuses on the process and product.

== Topics ==
Situated learning was first projected by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger as a model of learning in a community of practice. This type of learning allows an individual (students/learner) to learn by socialization, visualization, and imitation.

=== Situated cognition and problem-based learning ===
Learning begins with people trying to solve problems. When learning is problem-based, people explore real-life situations to find answers, or to solve the problems. Hung&#x27;s study focuses on how important being social is to learning.

In believing that learning is social, Hung adds that learners who gravitate to communities with shared interests tend to benefit from the knowledge of those who are more knowledgeable than they are. He also says that these social experiences provide people with authentic experiences. When students are in these real-life situations they are compelled to learn. Hung concludes that taking a problem-based learning approach to designing a curriculum carries students to a higher level of thinking.

=== Rethinking education in the age of technology ===
In the 2009 article &quot;Rethinking education in the age of technology&quot;, Collins &amp; Halverson argued:

Situated learning is becoming more involved with technology in ways to help individuals learn information differently than they have in the past. The model of learning a skill through technology mimics how individuals learned in the past from a professional in that skill. In the past when individuals learned about a particular topic it was done in person, in a hands-on environment. Technology makes it possible to do these same things using a computer or any other similar device. Interaction through the computer between individuals is one more way to make situated learning more successful as well as give students an opportunity to have another venue through which to learn. In fact,

=== Training teachers to integrate technology into the classroom curriculum ===
Allowing students to have the opportunity to participate, interact and inject their own ideas is a way to obviously grow and make informed decisions. Gee has proven this with the use of video games. It enables the learner to build their social and communication skills as well as develop their cognition abilities. Computer-based learning software such as SimCity has permitted users to utilize situated learning by allowing them to run their own city and become dictators whereby they have to make informed decisions that will either deteriorate their people or help them thrive. As stated, more effective learning environments are built this way.

Students process information by visualizing, hearing, reasoning and reflecting so they tend to learn more easily by having models to go by or imitate. In some study cases, teachers have gone as far as to make the classroom environment as homey as possible, whether it is a computerized setup or a physical setup. It gives the students the look and feel of being at home in a comfortable setting which allows them to feel and learn freely. It has been proven to have a great impact on the students learning abilities. This is another innovative way of utilizing situated learning.

When students complete their education, they will be expected to use the skills they have learned throughout their educational career in their professional career. It is imperative that they are able to sufficiently utilize these skills to complete work goals. Through situated learning, students will be able to learn the skills and also be able to accurately use the skills they have learned. Situated learning allows students to gain experience through doing in some way and from this experience they are able to be productive in their lives after they have graduated.

=== After graduation ===
Situated learning continues after graduation. According to Halverson (2009):

In situations where situated learning is not possible, simulations can offer an alternative way to provide employees with an authentic learning experience. Situated learning allows employees to immediately apply what they&#x27;ve learned in the context of performing job-related tasks. Learning occurs among peers who perform the same function. Problem-solving and the generation of new ideas can be better supported in a social learning environment where all of the stakeholders experience the positive effects of ongoing learning. Often, the benefits of situated learning extend well beyond the immediate group of practitioners throughout the organization and the broader community. Richardson notes that, in an educational setting, teachers can use collaborative technologies in their own practice in order to gain a better understanding of how to integrate these technologies in the classroom.

=== New tradition of online instruction ===
Many online learning courses still use the traditional teacher-directed, textbook-oriented curriculum that is compartmentalized by discipline. Many universities have begun to recognize that authentic situation learning must occur in online courses. A key aspect is to recognize that the unit itself must be an authentic activity and not just made up of disjointed activities.

Utley presents Hung&#x27;s argument that:

While it may be possible for adult learners to gain knowledge and apply theories presented in other learning environments to what they experience in a real-world setting, situated learning offers an opportunity to work with others in considering how to best apply new concepts related to the specific context of their practice. While theoretical knowledge provides a foundation, the insights and skills developed through authentic practice can lead to more meaningful learning.

The increase in learning centers across the country is evidence of how the U.S., and the world really, has morphed into a society of continuing learners. Much of this learning is happening in centers described by Halverson and Collins. Examples of these learning centers, which are perfect examples of situated learning, include local libraries and job training centers. These learning centers are providing adults in particular with the kind of social interaction they need to extend their learning. This supports Hung&#x27;s findings that people learn by simply being in certain situations with others.
As organizations re-evaluate how they accomplish necessary workplace training with limited funds, they depend on informal learning that occurs within specific areas of practice to ensure that employees develop the skills they need to be effective.

=== The new world of work ===
Reliance on structured, theoretical training programs, especially offered by third-party providers, is decreasing, and companies are finding ways to facilitate authentic learning opportunities within their communities of practice. Wagner notes that financial considerations have led to fewer managers, so organizations are looking to those who actually do the work for ideas about improving their products and services.

When determining whether abstract or specific instruction is going to be more productive it is important to look at which method will be most useful to the individuals that are learning the skill. If students receive specific instruction they are going to be capable of performing those set tasks only. When students are taught abstract instruction they are exposed to more skills that will be useful in helping them obtain a variety of jobs but at the same time, they may have training that is not necessarily needed. When money is &quot;wasted&quot; by educating individuals on things that are not needed for their future it is possible to look at the situation and realize that the monies could have been of more use in giving another individual more specific instruction.

Our students are coming out of school unprepared and it seems that if they were in an educational setting where situated learning was implemented as much as possible, they would be better prepared for their futures. Based on Wagner&#x27;s research we are less prepared than other countries as far as education goes, which is not necessarily something new, but it is definitely something that seems too far from changing. When our students are put into situations where they learn by doing they most likely will be more successful than if they were just told how something needed to be done.

=== Web tools for classrooms ===
In the 2010 article &quot;Blogs, wikis, podcasts and other powerful web tools for classrooms&quot;, W. Richardson stipulated:

Teachers/instructors have come to realize just how important it is to utilize the web as a teaching tool for the new generation of students (digital natives). One digital tool that can be used is a weblog. It gives the students an opportunity to think, research, and realize that they can write and have a voice that can be viewed and read by many who may or may not share the same idea. When students blog, they are creating journals/text entries which are considered to be English (writing) and reading; they also have the opportunity to utilize other learning tools such as videos, photos, and other digital media.

Social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Ning allow learners, once they move beyond the personal connections, to embrace a community where they can learn from each other. Social interaction is an important part of the learning process. As technology has grown and become an integral part of the lives of children, teens, and young adults, older adults have been forced to adapt. For example, as more adults have been forced to move through the job market recently, they&#x27;ve turned to technology to develop new skills and to find work. Even fast-food restaurants require job seekers to complete employment applications online.

Students learn in different manners and visualization or situated learning seems to be the most used of all learning styles. Students are able to mimic what they see and hear which enables them to retain information for the long term. Through visualizations of different types of computer applications; the student&#x27;s knowledge is defined by the social process of interacting and doing. It allows the students to learn naturally as a result of social behavior. The computer application acts as a guide while the students learn naturally from their own experience. As always, situated learning accelerates a student&#x27;s learning process and ability.

Web-based learning tools provide integrated environments of various technologies to support diverse educators&#x27; and learners&#x27; needs via the internet. The goals of these tools are to enhance face-to-face instruction and make distance learning are courses available. Each of these tools offers similar components, such as course note-posting, assignments submission, quizzes, and communication features. The primary motivation for developing these tools is to make it easier for instructors who have very little knowledge of HTML and web navigation to put course materials on the web. There are significant drawbacks as well of using these tools. For example, these systems course instructors and course administrators to use predetermined navigation models and course formats. These constraints may have a negative impact on their flexibility and usability for administrators, teachers, and students. A tool should be as such suitable for diverse courses campus-wide. Accordingly, a web-based learning tool should be able to provide facilities for courses, news, and announcements, and area to store course notes and related information synchronous and asynchronous tools such as e-mail, bulletin board, and chat facilities as well as features for creating and administering online quizzes and online submissions. Web tools also support inquiry-based learning suitable for teachers and students both involving the essence of inquiry-based learning.
Inquiry-based learning describes approaches to learning that are based on the investigation of questions, scenarios, or problems-often assisted by a facilitator. Inquiries will understand and study issues and questions to improve their knowledge or solutions. It includes problem-based learning and is used in small-scale investigation and projects as well as research. It will be much more beneficial for students because involvement in learning results in the improvement of possessing skills and attitudes that permit you to seek solutions and issues while you build your new knowledge. There are numerous web tools that support inquiry-based learning which teachers can use effectively to make all students interact in the class.

Web-based learning tools are also referred to as learning objects, interactive web-based tools that support learning by enhancing, amplifying, and guiding the cognitive processes of learners. It offers two noteworthy features that can reduce the impact of potential obstacles teachers face when using technology. Firstly it is designed to focus on specific concepts, making them easy to learn and use and more attractive to busy educators who have little time to learn more complex, advanced software packages. Ease of use also makes it more palatable to teachers who are apprehensive about using technology. Secondly, a wide range of web-based learning tools exists including drill and practice assessment tools or tutorials, video case studies or supports, general web-based multimedia resources, and self-contained interactive tools in a specific content area. In contrast with other learning technologies burdened with implementation challenges and costs, web-based learning tools are readily accessible over the net and teachers need not worry about extra cost or not having the latest version. It is speculated that the broad selection of readily accessible web-based learning tools will make it easier for teachers to integrate WBLT&#x27;s into a classroom environment. Some of the best interactive web tools for educators.

=== Project-based learning ===
Project-based learning simulates the experiences that learners would have while performing the functions required in a job, which allows the opportunity to immediately apply what they&#x27;ve learned and benefit from an organization&#x27;s existing knowledge base. With recent advances in technology, it is possible to facilitate the social aspects of learning by virtually connecting individuals within a distributed community of practice in the online environment.

While these are skills that teachers are trying to develop in young learners, adults have already developed and used these skills. They have sharpened these skills through work, higher education, raising children or through marriage. As lifelong learners dealing with real-life problems, a project-based approach is what develops when they come together with other adults at brick-and-mortar learning centers or in social networking communities on the web.

== Evaluation ==
Situated learning activities are collaborative and complex therefore traditional methods of assessment are not sufficient. A few of the trends followed in evaluating the situated learning could be:
* Focus on the process rather than the products:
The process includes the content so this can be assessed by a few methods such as concept map and videotape coding.
* Non linear measures:
It means that the answers by the learner should be able to accept and defend multiple perspectives. They should measure the attitude, efficacy, perceptual skills and higher-order thinking.
* Using technology:
Collaboration with technology will allow to track the students activities like time spent on planning, collecting information with respect to solve a problem etc.

<text>Ctenophorus is a genus of lizards, commonly known as comb-bearing dragons, found in Australia. They are in the dragon lizard family, known as Agamidae.

==Description==
The genus contains the most diverse group of dragon lizards in Australia. It is the largest group of Australian lizards and it has an extensive radiation in the arid zones. Many of the species of &quot;Ctenophorus&quot; have been grouped by a similar morphology. The informal names and groupings within this genus — rock dragon, sand dragon, crevice-dragon, ground dragon, and bicycle-dragon — are named after the mythological creature, the dragon.

Lizards in the genus &quot;Ctenophorus&quot; may be confused with lizards in the genera &quot;Tympanocryptis&quot; and &quot;Diporiphora&quot;.

==Species==
There were 34 recognised species in the genus until a new study published in June 2023 discovered four more in South Australia adding up to a total of 38 species. The new species are included in the list below.

* &quot;Ctenophorus infans&quot; – Laverton ring-tailed dragon
* &quot;Ctenophorus isolepis&quot; – central military dragon
* &quot;Ctenophorus kartiwarrui&quot; 
* &quot;Ctenophorus maculatus&quot; – spotted military dragon, spotted dragon, spotted sand dragon
* &quot;Ctenophorus maculosus&quot; – Lake Eyre dragon, salt-lake ground-dragon
* &quot;Ctenophorus mckenziei&quot; – dwarf bicycle-dragon, McKenzie&#x27;s dragon

* &quot;Ctenophorus slateri&quot; – Slater&#x27;s dragon
* &quot;Ctenophorus spinodomus&quot; – Eastern Mallee dragon
* &quot;Ctenophorus tjakalpa&quot; 
* &quot;Ctenophorus tjantjalka&quot; – ochre dragon
* &quot;Ctenophorus tuniluki&quot; 
* &quot;Ctenophorus vadnappa&quot; – red-barred crevice-dragon, red-barred dragon
* &quot;Ctenophorus yinnietharra&quot; – Yinnietharra crevice-dragon, Yinnietharra rock dragon

===2023 identification of new species===
Danielle Edwards, curator of terrestrial vertebrates at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, and Mark Hutchinson, of the South Australian Museum, both started studying sand dragons in 2008, when only three species (&quot;C. fordi&quot;, &quot;C. femoralis&quot;, and &quot;C. maculatus&quot;) had been identified. Their June 2023 study published in the &quot;Journal of Herpetology&quot; provided additional morphological data from all of candidate species, which led to the recognition of 11 species. Of these, four taxa were found to be species rather than subspecies, with another four species newly described.

The four new species, all endemic to the state of South Australia, have been assigned names relating to their respective Aboriginal language of their habitat:
* &quot;C. ibiri&quot; – meaning &quot;small lizard&quot; in the Barngarla language; found in parts of the Eyre Peninsula
* &quot;C. kartiwarrui&quot; – a derivation of the Dieri language term &quot;kartiwarru&quot;, meaning &quot;red-backed lizard&#x27;; found in the Strzelecki Desert
* &quot;C. tjakalpa&quot; – named after the traditional name for the Great Victoria Desert, where it lives
* &quot;C. tuniluki&quot; – meaning &quot;sand lizard&quot; in the Ngarrindjeri language, which is found in the Mallee region along the River Murray

==Polymorphism==
Lizards of the genus &quot;Ctenophorus&quot; are known to display colour polymorphism, more than one colour type being found within a population. It is believed that colour polymorphism in this group has evolved as a result of a combination of sexual selection and natural selection.

<text>Draco is a genus of agamid lizards that are also known as flying lizards, flying dragons or gliding lizards. These lizards are capable of gliding flight via membranes that may be extended to create wings (patagia), formed by an enlarged set of ribs. They are arboreal insectivores.

While not capable of powered flight they often obtain lift in the course of their gliding flights. Glides as long as have been recorded, over which the animal loses only in height which makes for a glide ratio of 6:1. This is done by a lizard of only around in total length, tail included. They are found across Southeast Asia and Southern India and are fairly common in forests, areca gardens, teak plantations and shrub jungle.

==History of discovery==
Carl Linnaeus described the genus in 1758, with the type species being &quot;Draco volans.&quot; The name of the genus is from the Latin term for dragons of mythology. In the early and mid 20th century, there was controversy about their gliding capabilities, with some authors suggesting that the patagia were solely for display, but research in the late 1950s firmly established the gliding function of the patagia.

==Distribution==
Species of &quot;Draco&quot; are widely distributed in the forests of Southeast Asia, with one species, &quot;Draco dussumieri,&quot; inhabiting Southern India.

==Habitat and ecology==
Members of &quot;Draco&quot; are primarily arboreal, inhabiting tropical rainforests, and are almost never found on the forest floor. They are insectivorous, primarily feeding on eusocial insects such as ants and termites. The colour of the patagium is strongly correlated to the colour of falling leaves in their range, which complements their cryptic camouflage resembling tree bark; both are likely to be camouflage against predatory birds.

===Gliding===
The lizards are well known for their &quot;display structures&quot; and ability to glide long distances using their wing-like, patagial membranes supported by elongated thoracic ribs to generate lift forces. The hindlimbs in cross section form a streamlined and contoured airfoil, and are also probably involved in generating lift. Gliding is both used to escape predators, and as the primary means of moving through their forest habitat. The folding and unfolding of the membrane is controlled by the iliocostalis and intercostal muscles, which in other lizards are used to control breathing. At takeoff, the lizard jumps and descends headfirst, orientating itself so that the underside of the body is parallel to the ground. During flight, the back arches, forming the patagium into a cambered surface, and the forelimbs grab the front of the patagium, forming a straight front edge to the aerofoil. The forelimbs are used to manipulate the patagium in order to adjust the trajectory during flight. Maximum gliding speeds have been found to be between 5.2 and 7.6 metres per second, depending on the species. During the landing process, the glide is mostly horizontal. Immediately before landing, the forelimbs release the patagium. The landing is forefeet-first, followed by hindfeet. The shape of the gliding membrane does not correlate with body size, meaning the larger species have proportionately less lift-generating surface area and consequently higher wing loading.

===Life history===
&quot;Draco&quot; lizards are highly territorial, with the home range consisting of one or a few trees. The trees are actively guarded by males, with territory-less males searching the forest landscape in search of vacant areas. Experimental studies have determined that suitable unoccupied territories were claimed within a few hours of the removal of a dominant male. Females move freely through the territories. The patagium is used as a display structure during courtship and territorial disputes between rival males, alongside the opening of a brightly-colored dewlap that contrasts with their camouflaged body scalation. The dewlap is translucent, and deliberately orientated to the orientation of the sun during display in order to enhance visibility. &quot;Draco&quot; is sexually dimorphic, with females being larger than males. The only time a female flying lizard ventures to the ground is when she is ready to lay her eggs. She descends the tree she is on and makes a nest hole by forcing her head into the soil. She then lays a clutch of 2–5 eggs before filling the hole and guards the eggs for approximately 24 hours, but then leaves and has nothing more to do with her offspring.

==Phylogenetics==
Within Agamidae, &quot;Draco&quot; is a member of the subfamily Draconinae. Within Draconinae, &quot;Draco&quot; is most closely related to the genera &quot;Japalura&quot; and &quot;Ptyctolaemus.&quot;

==Similar prehistoric reptiles==
Several other lineages of reptile known from the fossil record have convergently evolved similar gliding mechanisms consisting of a patagium or plate flanking the torso; the weigeltisaurids are the oldest of these, living in the Late Permian from around 258 to 252 million years ago. Other lineages include the Triassic kuehneosaurids and &quot;Mecistotrachelos,&quot; and the Cretaceous lizard &quot;Xianglong&quot;.

<text>Hydrosaurus, commonly known as the sailfin dragons or sailfin lizards, is a genus in the family Agamidae. These relatively large lizards are named after the sail-like structure on their tails. They are native to Indonesia (four species) and the Philippines (one species), where they are generally found near water, such as rivers and mangrove swamps. Sailfin lizards are semiaquatic and able to run short distances across water using both their feet and tail for support, similar to the basilisks. They are threatened by both habitat loss and overcollection for the wild animal trade.

In the 19th century, the genus was called &quot;Lophura&quot;, but in 1903, Poche pointed out that the name was preoccupied by a genus of pheasants. Since Günther in 1873, the Sulawesi populations were considered to belong to &quot;H. amboinensis&quot;; Denzer et al. in 2020 resurrected &quot;H. celebensis&quot; and &quot;H. microlophus&quot;, increasing the number of species from three to five.

They are the only members of the subfamily Hydrosaurinae.

==Species==
Currently, five species are valid according to the Reptile Database,

<text>Lophognathus is a genus of large-bodied agamid lizards, consisting of two species — &quot;L. gilberti&quot; and &quot;L. horneri&quot; — both of which are endemic to northern Australia. Along with several other closely related genera (e.g., &quot;Amphibolurus&quot;, &quot;Gowidon&quot;, and &quot;Tropicagama&quot;), these lizards are commonly referred to as &quot;dragons&quot;. In Australia, these lizards are also colloquially known as &quot;Ta Ta&quot; lizards, due to their habit of &quot;waving&quot; after running across hot surfaces.

&quot;Lophognathus&quot; are slender, slightly compressed, semi-arboreal lizards. They occur in a variety of habitats, including sand dunes and arid regions, but frequently near watercourses.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Lophognathus&quot; was originally named and described by John Edward Gray in 1842.

==Species==
Two species are currently recognized in this genus:
*&quot;Lophognathus gilberti&quot; – Gilbert&#x27;s lashtail, Gilbert&#x27;s dragon
*&quot;Lophognathus horneri&quot; 

Two species formerly included in genus &quot;Lophognathus&quot; have been reclassified, as follows:
*&quot;Lophognathus temporalis&quot; (also known as &quot;Amphibolurus temporalis&quot;, &quot;Gemmatophora temporalis&quot;, &quot;Gowidon temporalis&quot;, &quot;Grammatophora temporalis&quot;, &quot;Physignathus temporalis&quot;, &quot;Lophognathus labialis&quot;, &quot;Lophognathus lateralis&quot;, and &quot;Lophognathus maculilabris&quot;) has been reclassified as &quot;Tropicagama temporalis&quot;
*&quot;Lophognathus burnsi&quot; has been reclassified as &quot;Amphibolurus burnsi&quot;

<text>Lyriocephalus is a genus of lizard within the agamid family, with the sole species Lyriocephalus scutatus. It is the largest agamid endemic to Sri Lanka and lives in dense wet zone forests. It is also called the hump-nosed lizard, hump snout lizard or the lyreshead lizard. In Sinhalese language, it is known as &quot;Kandukara Bodilima – කදුකර බෝදිලිමා.&quot;

==Habitat and distribution==
A large agamid lizard, widespread in the wet lowlands and the midhills of Sri Lanka, from 25m up to elevation of 1650m.
==Description==
Body is laterally compressed. Pair of small spines present at back of the head. Dorso-nuchal crest developed. Forehead scales keeled. A distinct bony arch or hump appears on the head of adults, giving it its name. Tympanum absent. A V-shaped gular sac present. Large, keeled gular scales can be seen. Tail is short and compressed with a blunt tip. Dorsum is light green, throat yellow. The rest of the venter is cream colored.

The males are bright green with a yellow throat pouch and neck sail. Although the females can also exhibit this colouration, normally they are brown, especially when a male is present. Juveniles are brown.

==Ecology and diet==
Inhabits forests with high canopy and dense undergrowth, but it occasionally also enters home gardens. Active during the day, when it dwells low on trees as well as on the ground. It goes higher up on trees to sleep at night. 
The typical threat posture is open-mouth gape, revealing the bright red lining of the oral cavity. This species is also known to feign death when picked up. 
Its diet comprises essentially of earthworms and also arthropods, including termites, butterflies, and moths. It is also known to feed on young shoots and buds.

==Reproduction==
About 1–11 eggs with measuring 12–13 * 20–22mm per clutch are produced in the months of January, March, May, June, September, October, and December. Eggs are buried after laid in the soil, sometimes under bushes. Incubation period lasts 35 days.

<text>Pelturagonia is a genus of lizards within the family Agamidae. The species are distributed in Sumatra and Borneo. All species were previously listed under the genus &quot;Phoxophrys&quot;.

==Description==
The genus &quot;Pelturagonia&quot; closely resembles the genus &quot;Japalura&quot; but differs in a number of characters, for example by the absence of a dorsal crest, and by having a relatively shorter and deeper head. Male &quot;Pelturagonia&quot; have a tail that is swollen basally and is flattened above, whereas females have a cylindrical tail.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Pelturagonia&quot; contains the following five species which are recognized as being valid.

*&quot;Pelturagonia anolophium&quot; 
*&quot;Pelturagonia borneensis&quot; - Sabah eyebrow lizard 
*&quot;Pelturagonia cephalum&quot; - Mocquard&#x27;s eyebrow lizard
*&quot;Pelturagonia nigrilabris&quot; - Blacklipped eyebrow lizard
*&quot;Pelturagonia spiniceps&quot; - Sarawak eyebrow lizard

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Pelturagonia&quot;.

<text>Phrynocephalus is a genus which includes 36 species of small and medium-sized agamid lizards, commonly called toadhead agamas or toad-headed agamas, that inhabit open arid and semiarid environments of Asia and Eastern Europe. The systematics of this genus are very complicated with many controversial points of view about the unclear phylogeny of this group. All representatives of this genus have adopted the so-called &quot;sit and wait&quot; hunting strategy and they actively use visual orientation when watching for food. In general, the ecological niche and role of &quot;Phrynocephalus&quot; species in lizard communities of arid environments of Asia are poorly studied, but seem to be similar to that of &quot;Phrynosoma, Cophosaurus, Holbrookia, Uta&quot;, and &quot;Sceloporus&quot; in the New World, as well as &quot;Moloch&quot; in Australia.

<text>Pogona is a genus of reptiles containing eight lizard species, which are often known by the common name bearded dragons or informally (especially in Australia) beardies. The name &quot;bearded dragon&quot; refers to the underside of the throat (or &quot;beard&quot;) of the lizard, which can turn black and become inflated for a number of reasons, most often as a result of stress, if they feel threatened, or are trying to entice a mate. They are a semiarboreal species, spending significant amounts of time on branches, in bushes, and near human habitation. &quot;Pogona&quot; species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons and sleep at night, making them a diurnal species. Their diet consists primarily of vegetation and some insects. They are found throughout much of Australia and inhabit environments such as deserts, and shrublands.

The genus &quot;Pogona&quot; is in the subfamily Amphibolurinae of the lizard group Agamidae. Bearded dragons are characterized by their broad, triangular heads, flattened bodies, and rows and clusters of spiny scales covering their entire bodies. When threatened, bearded dragons puff up their bodies and beards to ward off predators and make their somewhat dull spikes seem more dangerous. Bearded dragons display a hand-waving gesture to show submission (most often when acknowledging another bearded dragon&#x27;s territory), and a head-bobbing display to show dominance between dragons. Some have the ability to slightly change color in response to certain stimuli including rivalry challenges between males and ambient temperature changes (e.g., turning black to absorb heat). Bearded dragons occur in a variety of colors and morphs and can range from being all dark to completely white under controlled breeding conditions. Males grow up to long, and females up to .

Bearded dragons live in the woodlands, heaths, deserts and coastal dunes, with their range extending throughout the interior of the eastern states to the eastern half of South Australia and southeastern Northern Territory. They are considered to be semiarboreal and quite readily climb and bask at height. This is also linked to dominance behavior and competition for territory/basking areas. They can be found on fallen/broken trees, rocky outcrops, and bushes when basking. Many of the Australian locals have spotted bearded dragons on fence posts and elevated rocky areas. At night, they prefer to dig holes to sleep in, climb in trees, or submerge themselves in rocks and like to climb into the cracks and crevices of stones and caves.

Bearded dragons go through a type of hibernation called brumation, in which like hibernation, reptiles go months without eating, but sporadically drink water. Reptiles go dormant in the hottest temperatures, but it differs from brumation during cooler temperatures. When temperatures are extreme, a very small range of temperatures exists through which the reptile&#x27;s bodies can stay active and where their bodies cannot tolerate the extreme heat and they die. Bearded dragons go through brumation when the temperature goes below 15.5–21.0 °C (60–70 °F) during the night and 24.0–26.5 °C (75–80 °F) during the day for 8–10 hours. When the climate is too hot they will often burrow underground. They will also form more permanent burrows or covered hiding places to use as protection from the climate changes at night and predation.

== Behavior ==
Adult bearded dragons are very territorial. As they grow, they establish territories in which displays of aggression and appeasement form a normal part of their social interactions. A dominant male adopts a dominant stance and sometimes readies himself for a fight to attack a male aggressor to defend territory or food sources, or in competition for a female. Any male approaching without displaying submissive behavior is seen as a challenge for territory. Aggressive males have even been known to attack females that do not display submissive gestures in return.

Correspondingly, adult male bearded dragons can bite more forcefully than adult females, which is associated with greater head dimensions.
The bearded dragon occurs in many different colors. The beard itself is used for mating and aggression displays, as well as heat management. It forms part of a range of gestures and signals through which the dragons have basic levels of communication. Both sexes have a beard, but males display more frequently, especially in courtship rituals. Females also display their beards as a sign of aggression. The beard darkens, sometimes turning jet black, and inflates during the display. The bearded dragon may also open its mouth and gape in addition to inflating its beard to appear more intimidating. Extreme behavior such as hissing can be observed when threatened with a predator, inflating the body and tilting towards the threat in defense. Bearded dragons have relatively strong jaws, but often only attack as a last resort when threatened outside of competition with their own species.

Head bobbing is another behavior seen in both females and males; they quickly move their heads up and down, often darkening and flaring their beards. Changes in the pace of head bobbing are thought to be a form of communication. Males head bob to impress females, and a male often has to demonstrate his dominance when attempting to mate before the female will concede. Smaller males often respond to a larger male&#x27;s head bobbing by arm waving, which is a submissive sign. Females also arm wave to avoid aggression, often in response to a male&#x27;s head bobbing. Female bearded dragons have been seen lowering themselves towards the ground and intermittently arm waving whilst moving away from a dominant male in an attempt to either appease or escape.

The bearded dragon has also been shown to perceive illusion, specifically the &quot;Delboeuf illusion&quot;. In an experiment at the University of Padova, bearded dragons were presented with two different-sized plates with the same amount of food. The bearded dragons chose the smaller plate more often than they chose the larger one, showing that they were able to perceive the illusion and interpret that a larger plate does not always mean more food. This is the first evidence of this behavior being shown in a reptile species.

== Reproduction ==
When brumation comes to an end, the male bearded dragon goes out to find a mate. A courtship ritual occurs where the male starts bobbing his head, waving his arms, and stomping his feet in front of the female. The male chases the female and bites the back of her neck and holds on while he gets in position to copulate.

During the breeding period, female bearded dragons can store sperm in their oviductal crypts. This allows the females to lay a clutch of 11–30 eggs, twice from one mating.

Bearded dragons exhibit temperature sex determination; while the embryo is developing, higher temperatures cause dragons with a male genotype to experience sex reversal and express a female phenotype. This produces a bearded dragon that is a female, but still has a male genotype. Incubation temperatures above can cause sex reversal, and the likelihood of sex reversal has a positive correlation with temperature up to 36 °C. Incubation temperatures below 31 °C cannot trigger sex reversal. Surprisingly, female bearded dragons with a male genotype do not have many differences from genotypic females. According to one study done on bite force, male bearded dragons have a higher bite force than genotypic females, and sex-reversed females, but no difference was seen between genotypic females and sex-reversed females.

Like many other reptile species (and what is most often observed in birds), females are capable of laying eggs even without fertilization. These eggs appear slightly smaller and softer, and contain a yellow yolk when broken open.

=== Congenital defects ===
During the development of an embryo, abnormalities may result in birth defects. These abnormalities might be caused by chromosomal disorders, chemicals, or other genetic or environmental factors.

* Bicephalism is when a bearded dragon is born with two heads and one body.
* Anasarca is when a bearded dragon is swollen within the egg. Observing eggs in the incubator, an anasarca egg appears to be sweating. The cause of this is not known. 
* Shistosomus reflexa is when the organs of a bearded dragon develop outside of the body.
* Spinal and limb defects are abnormalities in the spine, tail, limbs, or toes. This occurs with nutritional deficiencies, trauma, or temperature issues during the development of the affected area. 
* Microphthalmia/anophthalmia is when a bearded dragon is born with small or no eye(s). The cause of this defect is a traumatic event or an environmental event that occurred during the development of the eyes. 
* Hermaphroditism is when the reproductive organs of both male and female are present. Bearded dragons born with both reproductive organs are infertile.
*Tail Necrosis/Tail rot is a serious condition in which the bearded dragon&#x27;s tail starts to rot and blacken. It is caused by tail injury, blood clot, or shedding complications, and can kill the bearded dragon.

== In captivity ==

The central bearded dragon is the most common species in captivity, as well as one of the most popular pet reptiles, with some smaller species such as &quot;Pogona henrylawsoni&quot; being used as substitutes where less housing space is available. Introduced into the U.S. as pets during the 1990s, bearded dragons have gained much popularity as an exotic pet. This popularity has been sustained, even after Australia banned the sale of its wildlife as pets in the 1960s.

Generally, the bearded dragon is a solitary animal. Males are usually housed alone, as they fight with other males and breed with females. Captive adults reach about from head to tail, weigh and live for about 10 to 15 years and longer with good care. They have been known to live up to about 15 years in captivity, and the current world record is 18 years.

Through selective breeding, many different versions of the central bearded dragon have been developed, referred to as &quot;morphs&quot;. They have a few main genetic traits, including &quot;hypomelanism&quot; and &quot;translucent&quot;, which refer to traits physically displayed by the dragon. Bearded dragons with hypomelanism tend to have lighter and more vibrant coloration. Translucents have a less opaque quality to their skin, making their colors seem stronger, and have black eyes. Also, &quot;leatherbacks&quot; have reduced scale texture to give a smoother skin, &quot;silkbacks&quot; have softer outer skin, and &quot;German giants&quot; are larger than average. Silkbacks in particular require special care, as they have far more delicate skin, and as such, require different UV and humidity requirements. They also tend to live shorter lives.

=== Common health issues ===
Although bearded dragons are fairly resilient to illness, improper care can potentially kill a bearded dragon. Some health issues that bearded dragons may have include metabolic bone disease, adenovirus, impaction, polarisation, dystocia, Yellow Fungus Disease and parasites. The majority of health issues bearded dragons face in captivity are due to poor diet and inadequate heat and lighting.

==== Metabolic bone disease ====
Metabolic bone disease (MBD) is a collective term for several common diseases/illnesses that can be fatal and is probably the most common health problem of bearded dragons. A main attribute of MBD is the weakening of the skeletal structure and possible deformation. It occurs in bearded dragons due to malnutrition or the use of improper lighting, meaning they are unable to properly assimilate calcium from their diet or there isn&#x27;t enough in their diet. Most bearded dragons in captivity will be fed supplementation and all will need a UVB light to enable them to properly use calcium in their diet. Typical foods that bearded dragons eat, including kale, mustard greens, and collard greens, are high in calcium and should be eaten daily along with other leafy greens and vegetables to have a well-balanced diet. Bearded dragons require UVB lights to process calcium in their diet. Without processing this calcium, their bodies will use calcium from their bones, therefore weakening them. Symptoms seen in bearded dragons with MBD include bumps in the legs, twitches or tremors, bumps along the spine or tail, a swollen bottom jaw, and jerky movements.

==== Hypocalcemia ====
Hypocalcemia occurs when there are low levels of calcium in the bearded dragon&#x27;s blood. Hypocalcemia is most often tied to metabolic bone disease. Low levels of calcium can result in twitching muscles, or seizures. Hypocalcemia is most often seen in young bearded dragons, as they are slightly more fragile than adults. Maintaining a diet that consists of enough calcium is crucial to avoiding hypocalcemia as well as metabolic bone disease.

==== Impaction ====
Impaction occurs often in bearded dragons when they are fed food that is too big for them. Bearded dragons will try to eat worms or crickets that are too big for them, but this can be extremely harmful. Food should not be bigger than the space between their eyes for a young dragon. Older dragons can generally cope with larger insects but not oversized prey. If a dragon eats food that is too big for it, pressure will be put on its spinal cord during digestion. This pressure can lead to impaction which can lead to death. Another cause of impaction in captivity is ingestion of the substrate, commonly sand or other loose substrates.

==== Upper respiratory infection (URI) ====
In bearded dragons, respiratory infection (RI) is caused by a bacterial infection in the lungs. Bearded dragons develop a respiratory infection due to a number of reasons such as incorrect lighting and temperature, high humidity, prolonged psychological stress, and poor captive conditions.

==== Atadenovirus ====
Atadenovirus (ADV), also referred to as adenovirus, can be deadly. ADV can be spread between reptiles through contact alone. Most juvenile ADV-positive bearded dragons do not live past 90 days. While ADV-positive adults will live longer, they eventually contract liver diseases. Common symptoms of ADV-positive bearded dragons include stunted growth and slow weight gain. Because of their compromised immune systems, ADV-positive bearded dragons may be infected with intestinal parasites.

=== Lighting ===
Bearded dragons require UVB to enable vitamin D3 synthesis and to prevent illnesses like metabolic bone disease. Vitamin D3 is essential to calcium absorption, with calcium playing a major role in various critical biological functions. Bearded dragons also require UVA, which stimulates feeding, breeding, basking and overall health. They also require a basking heat source, most commonly a light-emitting source, to provide a basking area. Heat and UV are both vital to the bearded dragons&#x27; biological function.

== Species ==
The following six species are recognised as being valid.
*&quot;Pogona barbata&quot; – Eastern bearded dragon
*&quot;Pogona henrylawsoni&quot; – Rankin&#x27;s dragon, Lawson&#x27;s dragon, black-soil bearded dragon, dumpy dragon, dwarf bearded dragon

<text>The Sinai agama (Pseudotrapelus sinaitus) is an agamid lizard found in arid areas of southeastern Libya, UAE, eastern Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Oman, eastern Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Djibouti.

The length of the lizard including its long slender tail is , the tail accounting for up to two-thirds of its total length. The limbs and tail are long and thin and allow for good climbing and running capability.

&quot;Pseudotrapelus sinaitus&quot; is active during daytime and feeds on insects and other arthropods and plants. During the breeding season, males become a striking blue colour to attract females. The female has brownish-red spots on her sides.

==Description==
The Sinai agama is a small lizard with long legs, giving it an upright stance. It grows to a length of and has a long, slender tail, one and a half times as long as the body. The long head has the eyes fairly near the front with a distinctive pair of ear openings some way behind in line with the animal&#x27;s mouth. The legs are long and slender and the tail is often held off the ground. This lizard is generally a dull brown colour, but during the breeding season, the male turns bright blue, or sometimes just the head and throat turn blue with the other parts remaining brown. Females and juveniles are greyish-brown all year round, but females often have a crescent-shaped red patch on each side just behind the forelimbs. The scales on the dorsal surface are relatively small, uniformly overlapping, and slightly keeled. The mid-back scales are slightly larger than elsewhere, and the scales on the tail are larger than those on the back. Unlike members of the closely related genus &quot;Agama&quot;, the third (middle) toe is the longest instead of the fourth.

==Distribution==
The Sinai agama is found in arid parts of northeastern Africa and parts of the Middle East. The countries where it occurs include Libya, Egypt, South West Yemen, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Palestine, Israel, Jordan, and Syria.

==Behaviour==
The Sinai agama hunts for insects and a large part of its diet consists of ants. Breeding takes place in spring and early summer when both the male and female become territorial. To maintain their territory, they adopt a threatening pose by raising their heads and gaping. The male finds a prominent spot where he can communicate with a prospective mate by bobbing his head, using eye movements, and doing push-ups with his front limbs. After mating has taken place, the female lays a clutch of five to nine eggs about long.

Like other lizards, the Sinai agama is ectothermic. In the daytime, they bask in the sun and are seen on boulders, cliffs, or piles of stone. Under these circumstances, any alarm or attempt at predation causes them to dash off at great speed. When the external temperature is lower, their body metabolism is lowered and they are incapable of sudden bursts of speed. Their instinct is to stand their ground and attack their aggressors.

==Subspecies==
Two subspecies are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.
*&quot;Pseudotrapelus sinaitus sinaitus&quot; 
*&quot;Pseudotrapelus sinaitus werneri&quot; 

==Etymology==
The subspecific name, &quot;werneri&quot;, is in honour of Israeli Herpetologist Yehudah L. Werner.

The junior synonym, &quot;Agama neumanni&quot;, is in honor of German ornithologist Oscar Neumann.

<text>Rankinia is a genus of small agamid reptiles. As currently delineated, it is monotypic, containing only Rankinia diemensis (Gray, 1841), also known as the mountain heath dragon or mountain dragon. It is endemic to Australia.

==Distribution and habitat==
It occurs in the uplands of New South Wales and Victoria, as well as in Tasmania, where it is the only native agamid. Mountain dragons are found in dry woodlands and heaths with access to open areas for sunning themselves. They are oviparous and feed on ants and other small invertebrates.

They do not climb very high, relying instead on camouflage to evade predators.

==Description==
Their overall colour is grey to reddish brown, with two rows of lighter-coloured paravertebral stripes or blotches running down their backs. These stripes are deeply scalloped, so they appear like two series of blotches. They can have cream-coloured bellies. Individuals can grow up to 20 cm in length, although the average length is somewhat smaller, with females typically growing larger than males. The average snout to base of tail length is 7.5 centimeters, but can be up to 9. They have a row of enlarged spinose (spikey) scales on each side of the tail bases.

The mountain dragon appears similar to the jacky dragon, but can be much redder, and the inside of its mouth is pink (compared to the yellow of the jacky dragon).

They breed in summer, laying 2–9 eggs in a burrow.

<text>Salea is a genus of arboreal, slow-moving, diurnal, insectivorous, egg-laying agamid lizards endemic to the Western Ghats of South India. It has two species, each inhabiting very high mountainous tracts of the Western Ghats in the Shola forest ecosystems.

==Description==
Albert Günther, in his treatise &quot;The Reptiles of British India&quot;, described &quot;Salea&quot; as follows:

The tympanum naked. Back and sides covered with strongly keeled scales of moderate size; several larger scales are intermixed with the others on the side; the scales form longitudinal series, and their tips arc directed backwards; bead without any spines. A crest on the back; gular sac: none. Tail slightly compressed at the base, with keeled scales below, which arc almost as broad as long. The head is tetrahedral, covered with small irregular shields above, which are nearly as large as the labials. Nostrils lateral, in the hinder part of a small shield. &quot;Canthus rostralis&quot; is very distinct; superciliary edge not prominent; eye of moderate size; tympanum as large as the eye. The trunk is slightly compressed, and covered with scales of moderate size which are sharply keeled and acutely pointed, the keels forming continuous longitudinal lines; the ventral and gular scales are similar in shape and size to those on the sides. There arc three larger scales, separate from one another, and placed in the same longitudinal line somewhat below the middle of the sides. Throat without pouch or fold; dorsal crest more or less developed. Tail long, tapering, slightly compressed at the base, uniformly covered with rhombic keeled scales, those at its lower side having very strong keels. The limbs are well developed; the fourth hind toe is not much longer than the third.

==Species==
There are only two confirmed species of &quot;Salea&quot;. 
The Palakkad Gap is believed to have played a significant role in causing speciation of these lizards on these mountain tops.

A doubtful &#x27;third&#x27; taxon &quot;Salea gularis&quot; is often associated with this genus.

<text>Sitana is a genus of lizards, collectively known as the fan-throated lizards, from the family Agamidae. They are found in Nepal, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The genus comprises fourteen species, including several recently discovered species, such as two new species from Sri Lanka. In 2016, a new genus named &quot;Sarada&quot; was erected, consisting of one former &quot;Sitana&quot; species and two newly described ones. &quot;Sarada&quot; is the sister genus of &quot;Sitana&quot;. Together they form a clade which sister group is &quot;Otocryptis&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Sitana&quot; are small to medium-sized lizards. They are ground dwellers, primarily eating insects but also mollusks and plant seeds.

Males measure and females in snout–vent length. In an example of convergent evolution, males have prominent dewlaps, similar to anoles, which are used in communication during the breeding season. The dewlap may be small to large, depending on the species. Females lack the dewlap.

==Species==
There are fifteen species that are listed here alphabetically:

<text>Tympanocryptis is a genus of Australian lizards in the family Agamidae, commonly known as earless dragons.

==Description==
The genus &quot;Tympanocryptis&quot; has the following characters. The tympanum is hidden (hence the common name earless dragon). The body is depressed, and it is covered dorsally with heterogeneous scales. There is no dorsal crest. There is no gular sac, but a strong transverse gular fold is present. The tail is round in cross section. There is a preanal pore on each side, which sometimes is absent in females. In most species there are no femoral pores, &quot;Tympanocryptis tetraporophora&quot; being an exception.

==Species==
The following 23 species are recognized as being valid.

*&quot;Tympanocryptis argillosa&quot; – claypan earless dragon

*&quot;Tympanocryptis pentalineata&quot; – five-lined earless dragon
*&quot;Tympanocryptis petersi&quot; – lined earless dragon
*&quot;Tympanocryptis pinguicolla&quot; – Victorian grassland earless dragon

*&quot;Tympanocryptis uniformis&quot; – even-scaled earless dragon
*&quot;Tympanocryptis wilsoni&quot; – Roma earless dragon (previously part of &quot;T. pinguicolla&quot;)

==The &quot;grassland earless dragons&quot;==
Several members of the &quot;T. lineata&quot; species complex (namely the Canberra population of &quot;T. lineata, T. mccartneyi&quot;, &quot;T. osbornei&quot;, and &quot;T. pinguicolla&quot;) are referred to as the &quot;grassland earless dragons&quot;, being the only members of the family Agamidae to be restricted to natural temperate grasslands. These species are found at higher altitudes and in regions that have cooler temperatures than any other earless dragon, where they prefer sites with both taller tussock and shorter grasses. The species were formerly considered different isolated populations of &quot;T. pinguicolla&quot;, until a 2019 study found the Canberra population to actually be an isolated eastern population of &quot;T. lineata&quot; and the Cooma and Bathurst populations to represent distinct species, and thus restricted the definition of &quot;T. pinguicolla&quot; to refer to only the possibly-extinct Victorian population.

The grassland earless dragons lay 3-6 eggs in late spring or early summer. Their young hatch in late summer (possibly disperse soon after hatching), grow to adult size rapidly (by late autumn-early winter), mate the following spring, and often die within one year of birth. They can reach the age of 5 within captivity.

All of the grassland earless dragons are highly endangered due to the heavy destruction and conversion of the temperate grasslands, of which less than 1% are said to remain. Overgrazing poses one of the most significant threats to them, especially when rocks are disturbed. These species are rarely found outside native temperate grasslands, and does not adapt well to changed environments, primarily due to the lack of food diversity found outside their native habitat. &quot;T. pinguicolla&quot; may already be extinct due to the heavy degradation that grasslands have received in Victoria, with the last known confirmed sighting being made in 1969.

According to herpetologist Lyn S. Nelson, &quot;Observations indicate that arthropod burrows, surface rocks, or other similar refuge sites may be necessary for the continued persistence of populations of dragons, by providing thermal refugia.&quot; They are known to hide within abandoned arthropod burrows and underneath rocky outcrops in order to lay eggs and protect themselves from predators. Soil disturbance, such as ploughing or compaction, might also result in destruction of the essential arthropod burrows and possibly a reduction in the abundance, at least in the short-term, of burrow forming arthropods. A radio-tracking study found that &quot;burrows excavated by arthropods are an important resource for grassland earless dragons, with individuals having one or two home burrows around which they maintained home ranges of between 925 m2 and 4768 m2.&quot; According to Nelson, they &quot;[m]ay survive short-term disturbance from fire.&quot;

In early January 2014, media reported that researchers Professor Stephen Sarre and Dr Lisa Doucette from the University of Canberra&#x27;s Institute for Applied Ecology had succeeded in breeding the Canberran &quot;T. lineata&quot; in captivity, and had also hatched eggs gathered from field studies, with around 60 hatchlings being born. In June 2011, Professor Sarre&#x27;s team won a four-year funding grant from the Australian Research Council to research and potentially save the species from extinction, and find a cause for the species recent collapse in numbers, thought to be associated with 10 years of drought in the species&#x27; range. In 2019, ecologist Brett Howard from the ACT Parks and Conservation Service said that &quot;grassland earless dragons are at risk of extinction in the near future even though much has been done to improve their survival chances in the past five years.&quot; He then listed the threats posed to this species, saying &quot;this species has suffered declines in recent decades likely due to a combination of drought, overgrazing and climate change.”

<doc id="326912" wikidata="Q575093" url="?curid=326912" title="Leiolepis">
<text>Leiolepis, commonly known as butterfly lizards or butterfly agamas (), are group of agamid lizards. They are native to Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, Ryukyu Islands (Japan), Vietnam, and Hainan (China). The genus includes both sexual and asexual species. &quot;Leiolepis&quot; is the sole genus of subfamily Leiolepidinae.

==Description and ecology==
&quot;Leiolepis&quot; are moderately sized lizards with the largest snout-to-vent length of . Sexual species show sexual dimorphism. They are diurnal and live in flat, open areas with loose soil, which allows them to construct long, interconnected burrows used for refuge. They are omnivorous.

==Species==
Ten species are recognized as being valid.

*Sexual species:
**&quot;L. belliana&quot; – common butterfly lizard 
**&quot;L. guttata&quot; – giant butterfly lizard, spotted butterfly lizard 
**&quot;L. ocellata&quot; – ocellated butterfly lizard
**&quot;L. peguensis&quot; – Burmese butterfly lizard 
**&quot;L. reevesii&quot; – Chinese butterfly lizard, Reeves&#x27;s butterfly lizard 
**&quot;L. rubritaeniata&quot; – Reeves&#x27;s butterfly lizard 
**&quot;L. glaurung&quot; - Khorat Plateau Butterfly Lizard
*Asexual species:
**&quot;L. boehmei&quot; – Böhme&#x27;s butterfly lizard
**&quot;L. guentherpetersi&quot; – Peters&#x27;s butterfly lizard 
**&quot;L. ngovantrii&quot; – Ngo Van Tri&#x27;s lady butterfly lizard
**&quot;L. triploida&quot; – Thai butterfly lizard, Malayan butterfly lizard

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Leiolepis&quot;.

Asexual species have arisen through hybridization of sexually-reproducing species.

===Consumption===
In the northeast region of Thailand it is popular to catch butterfly lizards and eat them. In the South Central Coast region of Vietnam, especially in Ninh Thuan Province, &quot;Leiolepis&quot; is considered a delicacy for its nutritional value and can fetch high prices on the market.

===Diet===
Butterfly Agamas commonly feast on insects (Worms, roaches, crickets, grasshoppers, larvae, beetles, moths) but can also eat fruits 
(Watermelon, apple, mango, papaya, dates, peaches, apricot) and vegetables (Collard greens, beet greens, mustard greens, broccoli, bell pepper, carrot, green bean). In captivity their meals should be dusted with a vitamin D3 calcium.

==Relationship to humans==
===Captivity===
Butterfly lizards can commonly be found in the pet trade. Not much is known about their breeding or raising their babies so most of the ones found in the pet trade are wild caught. 

===Traditional game===
In Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, Thailand, there is a traditional game called &quot;yæ̂ lng rū&quot; (แย้ลงรู; literally: &quot;butterfly lizards hole down&quot;).

<text>Maria Owings Shriver ( ; born November 6, 1955)
is an American journalist, author, a member of the prominent Shriver and Kennedy families, former First Lady of California, and the founder of the nonprofit organization The Women&#x27;s Alzheimer&#x27;s Movement. She was married to former governor of California and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, from whom she filed for divorce in 2011; it was finalized in 2021.

Shriver began her journalism career at CBS station KYW-TV and briefly anchored the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; before joining NBC News in 1986. After anchoring weekend editions of the &quot;Today&quot; show and the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, she became a correspondent for &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, also covering politics. After leaving NBC News in 2004 to focus on her role as First Lady of California, she returned in 2013 as a special anchor. For her reporting at NBC, Shriver received a Peabody Award in 1998 and was co-anchor for NBC&#x27;s Emmy-winning coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics.

As executive producer of &quot;The Alzheimer&#x27;s Project&quot;, Shriver earned two Emmy Awards and an Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences award for developing a &quot;television show with a conscience.&quot;

==Early life==
Shriver was born in Chicago, Illinois, on November 6, 1955, the second child of politician Sargent Shriver and activist Eunice Kennedy. She is a niece of the late U.S. president John F. Kennedy, U.S. attorney general and U.S. senator Robert F. Kennedy, U.S. senator Ted Kennedy, and six other siblings. A Roman Catholic, she is of mostly Irish and German descent.

Shriver spent her middle school years living in Paris save for a brief period when Shriver&#x27;s family moved temporarily to Chicago in the summer of 1968 following Eunice Kennedy Shriver&#x27;s work with the Special Olympics.

Shriver returned permanently from France to Bethesda, Maryland, in 1970, where she attended Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart high school and graduated in 1973, later attending Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York, for two years, then transferring into a Bachelor of Arts degree in American studies at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., graduating in June 1977.

Shriver is a fourth cousin of tennis player Pam Shriver. Shriver is also a cousin of Caroline Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

==Career==

===Media career and advocacy===
In her book &quot;Ten Things I Wish I&#x27;d Known Before I Went Out Into The Real World&quot; (2000), Shriver says that she became passionate about broadcast journalism after being sent to the back of the campaign plane with the press corps while volunteering for her father&#x27;s 1972 U.S. vice presidential race, calling these orders &quot;the best thing that ever happened to me&quot;. After her journalism career began with KYW-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she co-anchored &quot;The CBS Morning News&quot; with Forrest Sawyer from August 1985 until August 1986, co-anchored NBC News&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Today&quot; from 1987 until 1990. Shriver also served as Saturday anchor 1989 &amp; Sunday 1990 of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. She was a contributing anchor on &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; from 1992 until 2004. In August 2003, Shriver took an unpaid leave of absence from NBC News when her husband became a candidate in the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election.

Following her husband&#x27;s November 17, 2003, inauguration as the 38th Governor of California, she became the First Lady of California. She then returned to reporting, making two more appearances for &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;.

On February 3, 2004, Shriver asked to be &quot;relieved of [her] duties at NBC News,&quot; citing concerns the network had over the conflict of interest between her role as a journalist and her status as the First Lady of California and her increasing role as an advocate of her husband&#x27;s administration.

She appeared as herself in the film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; (1993). She also played a minor role as herself in &quot;Be Prepared&quot;, a 2006 episode of the television series &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; promoting a &quot;Preparedness Plan&quot;. On March 23, 2007, Shriver returned to television news as substitute host of panel-discussion talk show &quot;Larry King Live&quot; on CNN with musician Sheryl Crow and other guests.

Shriver announced that she would not return to the news media after the excessive media coverage of the death of Anna Nicole Smith. Shriver subsequently returned to the news media.

In 2003, Shriver&#x27;s father Sargent Shriver was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and she became an advocate and fundraiser for Alzheimer&#x27;s patient care and biomedical research. Shriver was the executive producer of &quot;The Alzheimer&#x27;s Project&quot;, a four-part documentary series that premiered on HBO in May 2009 and later earned two Emmy Awards. It was described by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;ambitious, disturbing, emotionally fraught and carefully optimistic&quot;. The series took a close look at cutting-edge research being done in the country&#x27;s leading Alzheimer&#x27;s laboratories. The documentary also examined the effects of this disease on patients and families. One of the Emmy Award-winning films, &quot;Grandpa, Do you Know Who I Am?&quot; is based on Shriver&#x27;s best-selling children&#x27;s book dealing with Alzheimer&#x27;s.

In 2016, Shriver published the coloring book &quot;Color Your Mind&quot;, a coloring book for people with Alzheimer&#x27;s.

Shriver has been a lifelong advocate for people with intellectual disabilities. She is a member of the International Board of Special Olympics, the organization her mother founded in 1968. She is also on the advisory board of Best Buddies, a one-to-one friendship and jobs program for people with intellectual disabilities. In addition, Shriver serves as Chair of the Audi Best Buddies Challenge: Hearst Castle, a bike ride that raises millions of dollars for programs supporting people with intellectual disabilities. As First Lady, Shriver has been instrumental in the hiring of individuals with intellectual disabilities in the capitol and in various state offices through her WE Include program. In February 2008, Shriver launched an ice cream company called Lovin&#x27; Scoopful with her brother, Tim Shriver. Twenty-five percent of the proceeds from Lovin&#x27; Scoopful benefits the Special Olympics.

In 2008, Shriver executive-produced &quot;American Idealist: The Story of Sargent Shriver&quot;. The documentary originally aired on PBS on January 21, 2008. The film chronicled the life, accomplishments and vision of her father, Sargent Shriver. Shriver also serves on the advisory board of the Sargent Shriver Peace Institute, which raises public awareness of her father&#x27;s legacy as a peacebuilder and offers educational and training programs grounded in the principles of public service that motivate the many programs he created, including the Peace Corps, Job Corps, Head Start, and Legal Services for the Poor.

In 2018, she published &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Thinking...: Reflections Prayers and Meditations for a Meaningful Life&quot;, which became an instant No. 1 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. Shriver released a companion journal, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Thinking...The Journal: Reflections, Prayers and Inspirations for Your Meaningful Life&quot;, in January 2019.

Shriver and her daughter, Christina Schwarzenegger, were co-executive producers of &quot;Take Your Pills&quot; (2018), an hour-long documentary on psychostimulant medications.

==== The Shriver Report ====
In October 2009, Shriver launched &quot;The Shriver Report: A Woman&#x27;s Nation Changes Everything&quot;, a national study and comprehensive report conducted in partnership with the Center for American Progress, USC&#x27;s Annenberg Center on Communication, Leadership and Policy, and the Rockefeller Foundation. The Shriver Report revealed that American women, for the first time, make up half of the United States workforce and studied how that fact is impacting major institutions like family, business, government and faith organizations. The report was released in 2013 in partnership with &quot;TIME&quot; and NBC News. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the report &quot;was modeled on a study undertaken almost 50 years ago during the administration of John F. Kennedy, Shriver&#x27;s uncle, and led by Eleanor Roosevelt.&quot; The report features, among other things, writings by public figures including Suze Orman, Beyoncé, Tammy Duckworth, Billie Jean King, Heidi Hartmann, Susan J. Douglas, Stephanie Coontz, Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, John Podesta, and Oprah Winfrey.

In 2010 &quot;The Shriver Report: A Woman&#x27;s Nation Takes on Alzheimer&#x27;s&quot; was published. It is a study by Maria Shriver and the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association. It features, among other things, writings by public figures including Barbra Streisand, Laura Bush, Patti Davis, Soleil Moon Frye, Rosalynn Carter, Susan Collins, Kathleen Sebelius, Barbara Mikulski, and Joe Biden.

In 2014, &quot;The Shriver Report: A Woman&#x27;s Nation Pushes Back from the Brink&quot; was published; it is about women and their children in poverty. It is by Maria Shriver, with editors Olivia Morgan, and Karen Skelton, and features, among other things, writings by public figures including Carol Gilligan, Beyoncé, Joan Chittister, Ai-Jen Poo, Eva Longoria, Stephanie Coontz, Jennifer Garner, Kathleen Sebelius, Jada Pinkett Smith, Anne-Marie Slaughter, Tory Burch, Sheryl Sandberg, Kirsten Gillibrand, Barbara Ehrenreich, LeBron James, and Hillary Clinton.

===First Lady of California===
After Arnold took office, Shriver took on several key initiatives as First Lady, which included raising awareness of the contributions of women to the state, working on practical solutions to end cycles of poverty, and encouraging all Californians to engage in acts of service to their communities. Once Schwarzenegger was elected, Shriver had to cut back on her news reporting to avoid conflicts of interest.

Shriver began leading the California Governor &amp; First Lady&#x27;s Conference on Women when Schwarzenegger took office in 2003. Under her leadership, The Women&#x27;s Conference event grew into the nation&#x27;s premier forum for women and, in 2010, attracted more than 30,000 attendees and 150 world opinion leaders over three full days. Each year, the event is held at the Long Beach Convention Center in October. Luminaries have spoken at the conference including Oprah Winfrey, Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, U.S. Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine Albright, Barbara Walters, Warren Buffett, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Richard Branson, Bono, Billie Jean King, Gloria Steinem, and the Dalai Lama.

In 2004, Shriver created The Minerva Awards to honor and reward &quot;remarkable California women&quot; who have changed their communities, their state, their country and the world with their courage, wisdom and strength. The Minerva Awards are named after Minerva, the Roman goddess who adorns the California State Seal and &quot;who symbolizes the dual nature of women as warriors and peacemakers&quot;. The Minerva Awards are presented annually at The Women&#x27;s Conference in Long Beach during a special ceremony. Recipients of the award also receive a grant to continue their work. Past Minerva Awards recipients include former first lady Betty Ford, Nancy Pelosi, Gloria Steinem, Billie Jean King, astronaut Sally Ride and the late Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Shriver&#x27;s mother. The achievements of The Minerva Award winners are chronicled in a permanent exhibit at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento and have become part of California&#x27;s official state archive.

In 2004, Shriver was in attendance at both the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention, attending the first to watch her uncle Ted Kennedy speak, and the latter to watch her husband speak.

In 2005, Shriver launched her WE Connect Program, which connects working families in need with money-saving programs and support services. WE Connect brings together community organizations and businesses, government agencies and state leaders, congregations and schools as partners in responding to the needs of the millions of individuals and families who are struggling to make ends meet. Through a partnership with &quot;La Opinión&quot;, the nation&#x27;s largest Spanish-language newspaper, WE Connect has developed three editions of a 24-page, full-color, bilingual supplement that has been circulated to over 20 million Californians in need. In December 2009, Shriver, in partnership with The Women&#x27;s Conference, created the WE Connect–Million Meals Initiative. Through this initiative, The Women&#x27;s Conference made a donation to The California Association of Food Banks to provide more than one million meals to California families in need. The donation was allocated to the food bank&#x27;s 44 member organizations who then distributed the food to California families through its more than 5,000 community-based organizations. In March 2010, Shriver held a three-day Community Resources Fair in Fresno and Los Angeles through WE Connect. The fairs provided vital programs and free support services such as tax preparation, housing and home foreclosure assistance, job assistance, flu shots, healthy food distribution and more. Event organizers estimated that over 40,000 individuals took advantage of free services during the course of the two weekends, and hundreds of thousands pounds of food were distributed.

As First Lady, Shriver worked to promote service and volunteerism. As Honorary Chair of CaliforniaVolunteers, Shriver conceived of and launched the largest statewide volunteer matching network at CaliforniaVolunteers.org. Shriver was instrumental in inspiring Governor Schwarzenegger to establish the nation&#x27;s first state cabinet-level Department of Service and Volunteering. She also pioneered and promoted a statewide disaster preparedness program called WE Prepare that encourages and educates Californians to be ready for an emergency or natural disaster. In addition, Shriver established WE Build and WE Garden, a children&#x27;s playground and community garden-building initiative. &quot;Try growing Tomatoes, I&#x27; beans don&#x27;t grow,&quot; she exclaimed. Through CaliforniaVolunteers, Shriver has built 31 playgrounds with gardens in lower-income communities around the state in partnership with KaBOOM!.

In 2008, Shriver launched her WE Invest Program, which provides training, mentoring, support networks, microloans and other resources to help women launch or grow their businesses. In June 2009, she expanded WE Invest nationally through a partnership with Kiva, creating the first-ever online peer-to-peer microlending program in the U.S. Shriver is credited with coming up with the idea to bring Kiva&#x27;s international micro-lending model to the United States.

Shriver is co-chair of The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts and she has been credited with revitalizing the state museum during her tenure. Shriver created the California Hall of Fame in 2006 at the Museum to honor legendary Californians such as Cesar Chavez, Clint Eastwood, Walt Disney, Amelia Earhart, Ronald Reagan, John Steinbeck, Rita Moreno, Earl Warren, Julia Morgan, Leland Stanford, Dorothea Lange and others. In November 2008, Shriver launched the California Legacy Trails, a first-of-its-kind web-based multimedia learning tool designed to help students learn California history.

On February 3, 2008, Shriver endorsed Senator Barack Obama for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. The endorsement was given at a UCLA rally featuring Caroline Kennedy (Shriver&#x27;s cousin), Oprah Winfrey, Stevie Wonder, and Obama&#x27;s wife Michelle Obama. Governor Schwarzenegger had endorsed Senator John McCain for the Republican presidential nomination a few days earlier on January 31, 2008. Later that year, as in 2004, Shriver was in attendance at the Democratic National Convention when her uncle Ted Kennedy spoke.

In May 2009, Shriver planted the first edible garden at a state capitol in what once was a flower bed. She teamed up with Alice Waters on the project. The food grown in the organic garden is distributed to local food banks. Shriver has been an advocate for edible gardens and chairs the California School Garden Network that has doubled the number of gardens in state schools from 3,000 to 6,000 since 2004.

===Return to NBC News===
On April 30, 2013, NBC announced that Shriver would join the network again as a special anchor working on issues surrounding the shifting roles of women in American life.

On October 18, 2013, Shriver returned to the anchor desk on &quot;Today&quot;, filling-in for Savannah Guthrie for the first time since 1998 as co-anchor with Matt Lauer.

==Personal life==
In 1977, Tom Brokaw introduced Maria to Austrian bodybuilder and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger at a charity tennis tournament being held at her mother&#x27;s home. She married Schwarzenegger on April 26, 1986, in Hyannis, Massachusetts, at St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church. They have four children; two boys and two girls, including Katherine and Patrick.

On May 9, 2011, Schwarzenegger and Shriver announced their separation after 25 years of marriage, and Shriver moved out of the couple&#x27;s Brentwood mansion. In a message for her Twitter followers posted on May 13, 2011, Shriver said: &quot;Thank you all for the kindness, support and compassion. I am humbled by the love. Thank you.&quot;

On May 17, 2011, Schwarzenegger publicly admitted to fathering Joseph Baena with longtime household staff member Mildred &quot;Patty&quot; Baena. Baena became pregnant in 1997, before his election as Governor of California. He confessed to Shriver only after she confronted him with the information, and after Shriver had confirmed her long-held suspicions in a conversation with Patty Baena. Shriver described Schwarzenegger&#x27;s admission as &quot;painful and heartbreaking&quot;. She declined to speak further on the issue, saying: &quot;As a mother, my concern is for the children. I ask for compassion, respect and privacy as my children and I try to rebuild our lives and heal.&quot; Shriver filed for divorce on July 1, 2011, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. Due to various legal disputes, the divorce was not finalized until December 2021.

In an interview with the Commonwealth Club of California in 2018, Shriver revealed that she had changed her registration from Democrat to independent, stating that there are good people and bad people in both parties.

==Honors==
As executive producer of &quot;The Alzheimer&#x27;s Project&quot;, Shriver earned two Emmy Awards and an Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences award for developing a &quot;television show with a conscience&quot;. She has additionally won Peabody Awards for her television journalism.

In 2009, Shriver was honored with the Shinnyo-en Foundation&#x27;s 2009 Pathfinders to Peace Award, which is bestowed annually to a person who exemplifies the ideals of compassion, harmony, and peace. At the presentation ceremony honoring Shriver, the foundation&#x27;s chief executive said, &quot;Maria Shriver sees the best in other people – their innate goodness – and inspires them to become their own &#x27;Architects of Change&#x27;. In a world that glorifies ambition at any cost, Maria instead teaches character. She is a woman of quiet strength who role-models kindness and charity, and has used her celebrity to help create peace in the world.&quot;

The Saint John&#x27;s Health Center has a nursery named after Shriver.

A hybrid rose was named after Shriver in October 2004. The Maria Shriver rose contains starchy-white blooms and a powerful citrus fragrance.

In 2017, the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association awarded Shriver with its first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award.

<text>Uromastyx is a genus of lizards in the family Agamidae. The genus is native to Africa and the Middle East (West Asia). Member species are commonly called spiny-tailed lizards, uromastyces, mastigures, or dabb lizards. 

Lizards in the genus &quot;Uromastyx&quot; are primarily herbivorous, but occasionally eat insects and other small animals, especially young lizards. They spend most of their waking hours basking in the sun, hiding in underground chambers at night time or when danger appears. They tend to establish themselves in hilly, rocky areas with good shelter and accessible vegetation.

==Taxonomy==
The generic name &quot;Uromastyx&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;ourá&quot; (οὐρά) meaning &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;-mastix&quot; (μάστιξ) meaning &quot;whip&quot; or &quot;scourge&quot;, after the thick-spiked tail characteristic of all &quot;Uromastyx&quot; species.

===Species===
The following species are in the genus &quot;Uromastyx&quot;. Three additional species were formerly placed in this genus, but have been moved to their own genus, &quot;Saara&quot;.

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Uromastyx&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Uromastyx&quot; species range in size from for &quot;U. macfadyeni&quot; to or more for &quot;U. aegyptia&quot;. Hatchlings or neonates are usually no more than in length. Like many reptiles, these lizards&#x27; colors change according to the temperature and season. During cool weather they appear dull and dark, but the colors become lighter in warm weather, especially when basking. The darker pigmentation allows their skin to absorb sunlight more effectively.

Their spiked tail is muscular and heavy, and is able to be swung at an attacker with great velocity, usually accompanied by hissing and an open-mouthed display of (small) teeth. &quot;Uromastyx&quot; generally sleep in their burrows with their tails closest to the opening, in order to thwart intruders.

==Distribution==
&quot;Uromastyx&quot; inhabit a range stretching through most of North and Northeast Africa, the Middle East, ranging as far east as Iran. Species found further east are now placed in the genus &quot;Saara&quot;. &quot;Uromastyx&quot; occur at elevations from sea level to well over . They are regularly eaten, and sold in produce markets, by local peoples.

==Diet==
&quot;Uromastyx&quot; lizards acquire most of the water they need from the vegetation they ingest. In the wild they generally eat any surrounding vegetation. When hatching, baby &quot;Uromastyx&quot; eat their own mother&#x27;s feces as their first meal before heading off to find a more sustainable food source. They do this to establish a proper gut flora, essential for digesting the plants that they eat.

In the wild, adult &quot;U. dispar maliensis&quot; have been reported to eat insects at certain times of the year, when it is hot and their only food source available would be insects.

==Reproduction==
A female &quot;Uromastyx&quot; can lay anywhere from 5 to 40 eggs, depending on age and species. Eggs are laid approximately 30 days following copulation with an incubation time of 70–80 days. The neonates weigh and are about snout to vent length. They rapidly gain weight during the first few weeks following hatching.

A field study in Algeria concluded that Moroccan spiny-tailed lizards add approximately of total growth each year until around the age of 8–9 years.

Wild female &quot;Uromastyx&quot; are smaller and less colorful than males. For example, &quot;U. dispar maliensis&quot; females are often light tan with black dorsal spots, while males are mostly bright yellow with mottled black markings. Females also tend to have shorter claws. In captivity female &quot;U. dispar maliensis&quot; tend to mimic males in color. &quot;U. dispar maliensis&quot; are, therefore, reputably difficult to breed in captivity.

==Relationship with humans==
===Captivity===
&quot;Uromastyx&quot; are removed from the wild in an unregulated manner for the pet and medicinal trade in Morocco, despite their protected status in the country; conditions of the animals while being sold is often extremely poor and overcrowding is common. Historically, captive &quot;Uromastyx&quot; had a poor survival rate, due to a lack of understanding of their dietary and environmental needs. In recent years, knowledge has significantly increased, and appropriate diet and care has led to survival rates and longevity approaching and perhaps surpassing those in the wild. With good care, they are capable of living for over 25 years, and possibly as old as 60.

===Consumption by humans===
&quot;U. dispar maliensis&quot;, known as &quot;ḍabb&quot; () by peninsular Arabs, is historically consumed as food by some of the Bedouin population of the Arabian peninsula, mainly those residing in the interior and eastern regions of Arabia. This lizard used to be considered an &quot;Arabian delicacy&quot;. It is recorded that when an &quot;Uromastyx&quot; was brought to the Islamic prophet Muhammad by Bedouins, Muhammad did not eat the lizard, but Muslims were not prohibited by him from consuming it; thus Muhammad&#x27;s companion Khalid bin Walid consumed the lizard.

In Judaism, this lizard is traditionally identified as the biblical tzav, one of the eight &quot;creeping&quot; animals forbidden for consumption that impart ritual impurity. The Torah states: “The following shall be impure for you among the creeping animals that swarm upon the earth: The weasel, and the mouse, and the dab lizard (tzav) of every variety; and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the skink, and the chameleon” (Leviticus 11:29-30).

<text>The manticore or mantichore (Latin: &quot;mantichorās&quot;; reconstructed Old Persian: ; Modern ) is a legendary creature from ancient Persian mythology, similar to the Egyptian sphinx that proliferated in Western European medieval art as well. It has the face of a human, the body of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion or a tail covered in venomous spines similar to porcupine quills. There are some accounts that the spines can be launched like arrows. It eats its victims whole, using its three rows of teeth, and leaves no bones behind. Other accounts also have it sporting the wings of a dragon.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;manticore&quot; descends via Latin &quot;mantichorās&quot; from Ancient Greek (martikhórās). This in turn is a transliteration of an Old Persian compound word consisting of &quot;martīya&quot; &#x27;man&#x27; and &quot;xuar-&quot; stem, &#x27;to eat&#x27; (Mod. ; &quot;mard&quot; + ; &quot;khordan&quot;); i.e., man-eater.

The ultimate source of &quot;manticore&quot; was Ctesias, Greek physician of the Persian court during the Achaemenid dynasty, and is based on the testimonies of his Persian-speaking informants who had travelled to India. Ctesias himself wrote that the &quot;martichora&quot; () was its name in Persian, which translated into Greek as &quot;androphagon&quot; or &quot;anthropophagon&quot; (), i.e., &quot;man-eater&quot;. But the name was mistranscribed as &#x27;mantichoras&#x27; in a faulty copy of Aristotle, through whose works the notion of the manticore was perpetuated across Europe.

Ctesias was also later cited by Pausanias regarding the &quot;martichoras&quot; or of India.

== Classical literature ==
An account of the manticore was given in Ctesias&#x27;s lost book &quot;Indica&quot; (&quot;India&quot;), and circulated among Greek writers on natural history, but has survived only in fragments and epitomes preserved by later writers.

Photius&#x27;s &quot;Myriobiblon&quot; (or &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, 9th century) serves as base text, but Aelian (&quot;De Natura Animalium&quot;, 3rd century) preserves the same information and more:

 Aelian, citing Ctesias, adds that the Mantichora prefers to hunt humans, lying in wait and even taking down even two or three men at a time. The Indians, he continues, take the young captive and disable the tail by crushing it with a stone before the sting begins growing.

=== Pliny&#x27;s Aethiopian beasts ===
Pliny described the &quot;mantichora&quot; in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; (c. 77 AD) having relied on a faulty copy of Aristotle&#x27;s natural history that contained the misspelling (&quot;martikhoras&quot;).

Pliny also introduced the confused notion that the manticore might occur in Africa, because he had discussed this and other creatures (such as the yale) within a passage on Aethiopia. But he also described the crocotta and the mantichora of Aethiopia together, and while the crocotta imitated the voices of men the mantichora of Aethiopia too also mimicked human speech, on authority of Juba II, with a voice like the pipe (panpipe, &quot;fistula&quot;) mixed with trumpet.

=== Legacy ===
Ctesias purportedly saw a martichora presented to the Persian king by the Indians. The Romanised Greek Pausanias was skeptical and considered it an unreliable exaggerated account of a tiger. Apollonius of Tyana also dismissed the mantichore as a tall tale, according to the biography by Philostratus (c. 170–247).

Pliny did not share Pausanias&#x27; skepticism. And for 1500 years afterwards, it was Pliny&#x27;s account, also copied by Solinus (2nd century), which was held to be authoritative on matters of natural history whether real or mythological. In the advent of Christianity, writings in the Holy Scripture combined with Plinian-Aristotelian learning gave rise to the &quot;Physiologus&quot; (also c. 2nd century), which later evolved into the medieval bestiaries some of which contained entries on the manticore.

== Medieval sources ==

=== Bestiaries ===

The manticore has been included in some medieval bestiaries, with accompanying illustrations, though not all.

The thick-maned (and long-bearded) manticore wearing a Phrygian cap is a commonplace design (fig., top left).

In most instances, the manticora is &quot;coloured red or brown and has clawed feet&quot;. Artists took the liberty of coloring the manticore blue at times. One example is depicted &quot;as a long-haired blond&quot; (fig., top right). Another has the face of a woman and the body of a blue manticore (fig., bottom right) .

Most manuscripts do not bother detailing the scorpion tail and simply draw a long cat&#x27;s tail,
but in Harley MS 3244 the manticore has an &quot;oddly pointed tail&quot; or an &quot;extraordinary spike on the end&quot; of it, and a tail covered in spikes from end to end is shown on the manticore in several other second family manuscripts.

The three-rows of teeth are not faithfully represented except in some third family examples.

==== Manuscripts and text ====

;Second Family
The manticore () occurs in about half of the Second Family Latin bestiaries. The specific source used in this case was probably Solinus (2nd century),

The text here describing the beast differs little from Pliny&#x27;s Latin version in language, or the Greek version in content (paraphrased above). This is naturally the case, since much of Solinus was recopied out of Pliny. The manticora is here described as &quot;bloody-colored&quot; rather than &quot;red like cinnabar&quot;.

The text concludes by stating that the manticore &quot;seeks human flesh, is active, and leaps so that neither large spaces nor broad obstacles can delay it (neither the broadest space nor the widest barrier can hinder it)&quot;.

;H text
Actually there are two candidate sources given for the passage, &quot;Solinus 52.37&quot; and &quot;H iii.8&quot;; this &quot;H&quot; being the pseudo-Hugh of Saint Victor &quot;De bestiis et aliis rebus&quot;, edited by Migne, but this source has been regarded circumspectly as the &quot;problematic &quot;De bestiis et aliis rebus&quot;&quot; by Clark.

;Transitional
The manticore also occurs in the earliest &quot;Transitional&quot; First Family bestiary (c. 1185), and some Third Family codices as well, whose illustrations attempted to reproduce some of the finer details given in its text.

==== Confounding with other hybrid beasts ====
As aforementioned, the manticore is one of three hybrids from Aithiopia described together by Solinus, appearing in (nearly) successive chapters of the bestiary. This created the groundwork for the beasts in adjacent chapters being confounded or amalgamated through scribal errors, as described below in the cases of bestiaries produced in France.

==== French mistransmission ====
The manticore is basically absent from the French bestiary of Pierre de Beauvais, which exist in the short versions of 38 or 39 chapters, and the long version of 71 chapters. Instead, there is a Chapter 44 on the &quot;centicore&quot; (or santicora, var. ceucrocata), which suggests manticore in name, but which is nothing like the standard manticore. The name is thought to have arisen from misspellings of leucrocotta, compounded by the suffix replaced by -cora by scribal error. Due to further mistransmission, &quot;centicore&quot; became the French misnomer for the yale (&quot;eale&quot;), a mythic antelope which should be a separate entry in the bestiaries.

Neither manticore nor leucrotta () appears in Philippe de Thaun&#x27;s bestiary in Anglo-Norman verse.

== Post-medieval natural history ==

Edward Topsell, in 1607, described the manticore as: 
Topsell thought the manticore was described by other names elsewhere. He thought that it was the &quot;same Beast which Avicen calleth &quot;Marion&quot;, and &quot;Maricomorion&quot; and also, the same as the &quot;Leucrocuta&quot;, about the bigness of a wilde Ass, being in legs and Hoofs like a Hart, having his mouth reaching on both sides to his ears, and the head and face of a female like unto a Badgers&quot;.

And Topsell wrote that in India they would &quot;bruise the buttockes and taile&quot; of the whelp or cub they captured, causing it to be incapable of using its quills, thus removing the danger. This differs somewhat from the original sources which stated that they would crush the tail with stone to make them useless.

== Heraldry ==

The likeness of manticore or similar creatures by another name (i.e. mantyger) have been used in heraldry, spanning from the late High Middle Ages into the modern period.

The mantyger is glossed as merely a variant reading of manticore in the OED, though the 17th century heraldry collector Randle Holme made a fine distinction between manticore and mantyger. Holme&#x27;s description of the manticore seems to derive directly from naturalist Edward Topsell (cf. above), while he describes the mantyger as having etc., and also noting that they may be horned or unhorned.

The manticore first appeared in English heraldry in c. 1470, as a badge of William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings; and in the 16th century.

The mantyger device was later used as a badge by Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex, and by Sir Anthony Babyngton. The Radford[e]&#x27;s device was described as &quot;3 mantygers argent&quot; by one source, c. 1600. Thus in heraldic discourse the term &quot;manticore&quot; became usurped by &quot;mantyger&quot; during the 17–18th centuries, and &quot;mantiger&quot; in the 19th.

It is noted that the manticore/mantiger of heraldic devices has a beast of prey body as standard, but sometimes chosen to be given dragon feet. The Radcliffe family manticore appears to have human feet, and (not so surprisingly), a chronicler described as a &quot;Babyon&quot; (baboon) the device by John Radcliffe (Lord Fitzwater) accompanying Henry VIII into war in France. It has also been speculated the Babyngton device is intended to represent the &quot;Babyon, or baboon, as a play upon his name&quot;, and it too also has characteristically &quot;monkey-like feet&quot;.

The typical heraldic manticore is supposed to have not only the face of an old man, but spiraling horns as well, although this is not really ascertainable in the Radcliffe family badge, where the purple manticore is wearing a yellow cap (cap of dignity ).

== Parallels ==
Gerald Brenan linked the manticore to the &quot;mantequero&quot;, a monster feeding on human fat in Andalusian folklore.

The Hindu god Narasimha is often referred to as a Manticore. Narasimha, the man lion, is the fourth avatar of Vishnu and is described as having a man’s torso and the head and claws of a lion.

== In fiction ==
Dante Alighieri, in his &quot;Inferno&quot;, depicted the mythical Geryon as having a similar appearance to a manticore, following Pliny&#x27;s description where it has the face of an honest man, the body of a wyvern, the paws of a lion, and the stinger of a scorpion at the end of its tail.

== Fine art ==

The heraldic manticore influenced some Mannerist representations of the sin of Fraud, conceived as a monstrous chimera with a beautiful woman&#x27;s face – for example, in Bronzino&#x27;s allegory &quot;Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time&quot; (National Gallery, London), and more commonly in the decorative schemes called (grotesque). From here it passed by way of Cesare Ripa&#x27;s &quot;Iconologia&quot; into the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French conception of a sphinx.

== Popular culture ==
In some modern depictions, such as in the tabletop role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) and the card game &quot;&quot;, manticores are depicted as having wings. They are more specifically given &quot;wings of a dragon&quot; in the implementation of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;′s 5th edition, according to the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2014), though an earlier version of the manual described them as &quot;batlike wings&quot;.

In the animated sitcom television series &quot;Krapopolis&quot;, the character of Shlub is depicted as a &quot;mantitaur&quot; which is a half-centaur, half-manticore creature where he was the result of a union between a female centaur and a male manticore. In this show besides the fact that the manticores are depicted with dragon-like wings like other depictions of them, the manticores are shown to have dragon-like horns on their head.

<doc id="326922" wikidata="Q7541428" url="?curid=326922" title="Sloth (deadly sin)">
<text>Sloth is one of the seven deadly sins in Catholic teachings. It is the most difficult sin to define and credit as sin, since it refers to an assortment of ideas, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and conditional states. One definition is a habitual disinclination to exertion, or laziness.
Views concerning the virtue of work to support society and further God&#x27;s plan suggest that through inactivity, one invites sin: &quot;For Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.&quot; (&quot;&quot; by Isaac Watts).

== Definition ==
The word &quot;sloth&quot; is a translation of the Latin term &quot;acedia&quot; (Middle English, &quot;acciditties&quot;) and means &quot;without care&quot;. Spiritually, &quot;acedia&quot; first referred to an affliction to women, religious persons, wherein they became indifferent to their duties and obligations to God. Mentally, &quot;acedia&quot; has a number of distinctive components of which the most important is affectlessness, a lack of any feeling about self or others, a mind-state that gives rise to boredom, rancor, apathy, and a passive, inert, or sluggish mentation. Physically, &quot;acedia&quot; is fundamentally a cessation of motion and an indifference to work; it finds expression in laziness, idleness, and indolence. Two commentators consider the most accurate translation of &quot;acedia&quot; to be &quot;self-pity&quot;, for it &quot;conveys both the melancholy of the condition and self-centeredness upon which it is founded.&quot;

=== Catholicism ===
In his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, Saint Thomas Aquinas defined sloth as &quot;sorrow about spiritual good&quot; and as &quot;facetiousness of the mind which neglects to being good... [it] is evil in its effect, if it so oppresses men as to draw him away entirely from good deeds.&quot; According to the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, &quot;acedia or sloth goes so far as to refuse joy from God and is repelled by goodness&quot;.

Sloth ignores the seven gifts of grace given by the Holy Ghost (wisdom, understanding, counsel, knowledge, piety, fortitude, and fear of the Lord); such disregard slows spiritual progress towards life—to neglect manifold duties of charity towards the neighbour, and animosity towards God.

Unlike the other capital sins, sloth is a sin of omission, being a lack of desire and/or performance. It may arise from any of the other capital vices; for example, a son may omit his duty to his father through anger. Henry Edward Manning argued that while the state and habit of sloth is a mortal sin, the habit of the soul tending towards the last mortal state of sloth is not mortal in and of itself except under certain circumstances.

Italian poet Dante Alighieri contemplates the nature of sloth as a capital vice in Canto 18 of &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, the second canticle of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Dante encounters the slothful on the fourth terrace of Mount Purgatory, where his guide, the Roman poet Virgil, explains that sloth can be seen as the effect of an insufficient amount of love. Following the logics of contrapasso, the slothful work to purge themselves of their vice through continuous running.

=== Orthodoxy ===
In the Philokalia, the word &quot;dejection&quot; is used instead of &quot;sloth,&quot; for the person who falls into dejection will lose interest in life.

=== Others ===
Sloth has also been defined as a failure to do things that one should do, though the understanding of the sin in antiquity was that this laziness or lack of work was simply a symptom of the vice of apathy or indifference, particularly an apathy or boredom with God. Concurrently, this apathy can be seen as an inadequate amount of love.

Emotionally and cognitively, the evil of &quot;acedia&quot; finds expression in a lack of any feeling for the world, for the people in it, or for the self. &quot;Acedia&quot; takes form as an alienation of the sentient self first from the world and then from itself. Although the most profound versions of this condition are found in a withdrawal from all forms of participation in or care for others or oneself, a lesser but more noisome element was also noted by theologians. From &quot;tristitia&quot;, asserted Gregory the Great, &quot;there arise malice, rancour, cowardice, [and] despair...&quot; Geoffrey Chaucer, too, dealt with this attribute of &quot;acedia&quot;, counting the characteristics of the sin to include despair, somnolence, idleness, tardiness, negligence, indolence, and &quot;wrawnesse&quot;, the last variously translated as &quot;anger&quot; or better as &quot;peevishness&quot;. For Chaucer, human&#x27;s sin consists of languishing and holding back, refusing to undertake works of goodness because, he/she tells him/her self, the circumstances surrounding the establishment of good are too grievous and too difficult to suffer. &quot;Acedia&quot; in Chaucer&#x27;s view is thus the enemy of every source and motive for work.

Sloth not only subverts the livelihood of the body, taking no care for its day-to-day provisions but also slows down the mind, halting its attention to matters of great importance. Sloth hinders man in his righteous undertakings and becomes a path to ruin.

According to Peter Binsfeld&#x27;s &quot;Binsfeld&#x27;s Classification of Demons&quot;, Belphegor is the chief demon of the sin Sloth.

Christian author and Clinical Psychologist Dr. William Backus has pointed out the similarities between sloth and depression. &quot;Depression involves aversion to effort, and the moral danger of sloth lies in this characteristic. The work involved in exercising one&#x27;s will to make moral and spiritual decisions seems particularly undesirable and demanding. Thus the slothful person drifts along in habits of sin, convinced that he has no willpower and aided in this claim by those who persist in seeking only biological and environmental causes and medical remedies for sloth.&quot;

<doc id="326923" wikidata="Q1327567" url="?curid=326923" title="Hugh Gregg">
<text>Hugh Gregg (November 22, 1917September 24, 2003) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 68th governor of New Hampshire from 1953 to 1955, and was the youngest person ever elected to that office. He is the father of former U.S. Senator and Governor Judd Gregg of New Hampshire.

==Life and career==
A native of Nashua, New Hampshire, Gregg was the son of Margaret Prentiss (Richardson) and Harry Alan Gregg. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy. He graduated from Yale University in 1939 and Harvard Law School in 1942, after which he returned to Nashua and started a law practice. During World War II and the Korean War, he served as in the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps.

A Republican, he was elected in 1947 as a city alderman, and was subsequently elected mayor in 1950, a term cut short because of military duty. He served again in Army Counterintelligence (1950–1952) during the Korean War. In 1952, he was elected as governor of New Hampshire.

Gregg was also a local businessman involved with the family mill-working business. He was instrumental in setting up the Nashua Foundation, which helped the city recover from the loss of textile mills in the 1950s, by recruiting new industry, including defense electronics firms and, later, Digital Equipment Corp.

In later years, Gregg was best known for his defense of New Hampshire&#x27;s first-in-the-nation presidential primary, as well as his contention that the Republican Party started in this state.

Gregg was known for a sense of humor, reflected in a small hardback book he published, titled &quot;All I learned about politics, by Hugh Gregg&quot;. All of its pages are blank.

<doc id="326925" wikidata="Q2103060" url="?curid=326925" title="Castleton, Derbyshire">
<text>Castleton is a village and civil parish in the High Peak district of Derbyshire, England, at the western end of the Hope Valley on the Peakshole Water, a tributary of the River Noe, between the Dark Peak to the north and the White Peak to the south. The population was 642 at the 2011 Census.

== History ==

Castleton village was mentioned as &quot;Pechesers&quot; in Domesday Book in 1086 where &quot;Arnbiorn and Hundingr held the land of William Peverel&#x27;s castle in Castleton&quot;. This land and Peverel&#x27;s castle were amongst the manors belonging to William Peverel that also included Bolsover and Glapwell.

St Edmund&#x27;s Norman church was restored about 1837. It has late 13th-century tracery and an ashlar-faced Perpendicular tower. Its box pews are dated 1661, 1662, 1663 and 1676.

A medieval leper hospital (the Hospital of Saint Mary in the Peak) is thought to have been on the eastern boundary of Castleton, though some locals believe it to have been just south of the Speedwell Cavern footpath from the village. University of Sheffield archaeologists are investigating &#x27;Castle of the Peak&#x27;, which was reputedly founded by the wife of one of the William Peverels before 1153, and continued until about the 1543 Dissolution. They say the earliest documents referring to Spital Field are a grant and a Charter from the early 14th century. They are also investigating the 12th-century planned town at the foot of the castle hill. Castleton&#x27;s medieval town defences are still evident in the village and are a Scheduled monument.

Castleton had a long history of lead mining; the Odin Mine, one of the oldest lead mines in the country, is situated west of the village (&quot;see also Derbyshire lead mining history&quot;). Researchers studying an ice core from a Swiss glacier have found that levels of lead air pollution across Europe during the period 1170–1216 were as high as those of the Industrial Revolution, and the principal source was Peak District mines such as Castleton and Wirksworth. The mining created and enlarged local caverns, four of which are now open to the public as Peak Cavern, Blue John Cavern, Speedwell Cavern and Treak Cliff Cavern. A small amount of Blue John is mined locally, and sold in a number of local gift shops, one of which is located in the 17th-century tollhouse.

Since the 1920s the main mineral industry in the area has been cement. Hope Cement Works is closer to Hope, but its quarry is closer to Castleton. A war memorial stands in the Market Place, in memory of local residents that died during both World Wars.

== Geography ==
Castleton is situated between the gritstone plateau of the Dark Peak to the north and the gentler limestone scenery of the White Peak to the south. It lies at the western end of the Hope Valley and consequently is surrounded on three sides by hills. Most prominent is the ridge to the north. This is called Great Ridge; it runs east from Mam Tor to Back Tor and Lose Hill, via the pass (hause) of Hollins Cross, where paths from many directions converge and cross over to Edale. Alexander von Humboldt visited caves near Castleton and Buxton in June 1790 to investigate the region&#x27;s geological structures.

Castleton was formerly on the A625 road from Sheffield to Chapel-en-le-Frith, on the way to Manchester. Leaving Castleton, the western road once went over Mam Tor, but after continual landslides and repairs (Mam Tor is called the &quot;Shivering Mountain&quot; because of its very loose shales), it was eventually abandoned. The only westbound exit from Castleton is now the unclassified road over the narrow Winnats Pass. This road is very narrow and steep and unsuitable for heavy vehicles or high volumes. Road signage has been designed to discourage through traffic by showing only local destinations. Thus, most traffic enters and leaves the village on the eastern (Hope-Hathersage-Sheffield) road (A6187); for traffic going west, that involves a long diversion via the villages of Bradwell and Peak Forest.

Castleton has a small bus station from where buses depart hourly to Sheffield (services 272/273) and 2-hourly to Tideswell and Bakewell (service 173). Sunday services on route 173 and less frequent services, including services 68 to Buxton, 174 Baslow, Ladybower (273 &amp; 274), 200 Chapel-en-le-frith and Edale 276, were cut in 2017 after cuts in government funding. At summer weekends buses link to Chesterfield, Glossop and Ladybower.

There is no railway station, but Hope station is about away, and train tickets to Hope and Edale are valid on connecting buses to Castleton.

===Education===
Castleton Church of England Primary School is located within the village. It was rated as &#x27;good&#x27; in its 2017 Ofsted inspection. From October 2017, the school and surrounding area was featured in the ident used by Channel 4.

The nearest secondary school is Hope Valley College.

===Tourism===
Castleton attracts many tourists, and there are multiple pubs (some with accommodation), tea shops and guest houses to supply their needs. There is also a large car park, a Visitor Centre housing a dedicated space for Castleton Historical Society’s museum, several outdoors shops and a youth hostel. Many schools visit the area for educational studies such as GCSE fieldwork. It is also a major walking centre, where routes up Cave Dale, Winnats Pass, Mam Tor and Hollins Cross meet. There are four &quot;show caves&quot; to visit, Blue John Cavern, Peak Cavern, Treak Cliff Cavern and Speedwell Cavern which includes an underground boat ride and at least one of them is open all year. Castleton has a combined post office and general shop.

On Castleton Garland Day (Oak Apple Day – 29 May), a &quot;Garland King&quot; is paraded around the streets wearing an extremely large garland of flowers, followed by local girls dressed in white with flowers.

Castleton is a favourite area for walkers: there is plenty of accommodation, and there are many public footpaths leading from the village. There are easy walks along the river to Hope, Brough, Bamford and (rather further) Hathersage, and there is a short strenuous walk up onto the Great Ridge, where views can be enjoyed before descending to Edale or returning to Castleton. Hayfield is a short day&#x27;s walk away beyond Rushup Edge. A two- or three-day trail, the Limestone Way, starts in Castleton and runs south down Cave Dale (past the rear of the castle) before climbing out of the village and heading for Monyash, Youlgreave, and Matlock.

Film of Castleton in 1945 is held by the Cinema Museum in London. Ref HM0365.

==In fiction==
The village was featured in episode 3 of &quot;Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders&quot; where the team &quot;investigates&quot; the 18th-century murder of an engaged couple. Much of the &quot;investigation&quot; takes place in Speedwell Cavern. One of the conspirators, James Ashton, is said to have confessed to the murders on his deathbed after being haunted by the dead couple. He also implicated others involved. Castleton also featured in national news reports in the early 1980s following the murder of Susan Renhard near the battlements of Peveril Castle.

The local caves were used as the filming location for the underworld, ruled by the evil Lady of the Green Kirtle, in the 1990 BBC adaptation of &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; (one of the Narnia books written by C.S. Lewis). Cave Dale features in the films &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; (2008).

The town is also featured briefly in the play &quot;The Devil is an Ass&quot; by Ben Jonson, first performed in 1616.

<text>Hope is a village and civil parish in the Derbyshire Peak District, in England. The population at the 2011 Census was 864. It lies in the Hope Valley, at the point where Peakshole Water flows into the River Noe. To the north, Win Hill and Lose Hill stand either side of the Noe.

== History ==
=== Pre-history ===
There is evidence of ancient human occupation of the area around Hope. Mesolithic implements were found by a footpath at Win Hill. A sandstone or ironstone Neolithic axe was found near Hope before 1877 and is now held in the collection at Bolton Museum. The village is close to the Mam Tor hillfort in the adjacent parish of Castleton and human remains and Bronze Age urns were found along with a possible barrow close to the summit of Lose Hill. A Bronze Age barrow called &quot;The Folly&quot;, with a diameter of , is located within the parish, close to Pindale Road.

=== Roman period ===
Traces of a Roman road, Batham Gate, and a Roman fort, &quot;Navio&quot; can be found near the hamlet of Brough-on-Noe, just east of the village. There are many remains from the site in Buxton Museum.

=== Saxon period ===

The Anglo-Saxon name of the village, &quot;hop&quot;, means a small enclosed valley. The name is recorded from 926 AD and in the 1086 AD Domesday Book.

The Roman name of the fort Navio was later changed to the Old English word for fort, &quot;brough&quot;. Edward the Elder granted lands at Hope to Uhtred, son of Eadulf of Bamburgh. These grants were confirmed by Æthelstan. The Old English gives its name to the adjacent parish of Brough and Shatton, although the fort lies within Hope parish.

=== Medieval period ===
Hope Motte, an earthwork on the bank of the Peakshole Water, is thought to have been constructed during the Norman period and is mentioned in a deed dating from the reign of Edward I.

The Domesday Book records that Hope had a church although the present parish church, the Church of St Peter, dates from the 14th and 15th century with modifications to the chancel dating from 1882. The church has two ancient crosses in its grounds. The shaft of a sandstone cross dating from the Anglo-Saxon period stands seven feet high and is carved on all faces. The cross may well have originated in the church grounds and a possible base now supports a sundial, but from the English Civil War until 1858 it was hidden in the village school. The stump of the Eccles Cross, originally near Eccles House, south of Hope, is also in the graveyard. Between 2 and 28 July 2011, the church was broken into and about 15 items dating as far back as 1662, including two silver chalices and a pewter plate, were found to have been stolen.

=== 18th century ===
From 1715 a weekly market was held along with four annual fairs, one being a hiring fair.

=== Industrial Revolution ===
Lead mining took place in Pindale in the 19th century. The Pindale mine was producing more lead than the Odin Mine between 1800 and 1802. The mine&#x27;s pumping engine house is still intact.

=== Tin Town ===
Between 1902 and 1916 a &quot;Tin Town&quot; was built at Birchinlee for the workers (and their families) who constructed the Derwent and Howden Dams. In 2014 it was reported that one of these buildings had been salvaged and was now located at Hope where it housed a beauty parlour.

=== World War II ===
On 5 October 1943, a RAF Handley Page Halifax Mark II bomber, HR727 returning to Snaith airfield after a raid over Frankfurt crashed in the Blackden Edge/Ashop Moor area to the east of the Kinder plateau. One of its engines was disabled by an enemy night fighter&#x27;s guns. Five of the seven crewmen lost their lives.

== Economy ==
Hope is the site of Hope Cement Works, supplied with raw materials by the adjacent quarry in the parish of Bradwell. This cement works is the location of the local volunteer mountain rescue team, Edale Mountain Rescue.

== Culture ==
The village is known for its well dressing.

== Transport ==
Hope railway station lies on the Hope Valley line between Sheffield and Manchester Piccadilly. Services are generally hourly each way, operated by Northern Trains.

A main road, the old A625, followed the route of the Sheffield &amp; Chapel-en-le-Frith Turnpike Company&#x27;s road of 1802 through the village and then over Little Mam Tor. The old truncated section of the A625 to Castleton has been re-designated as the A6187, after the Mam Tor section of the road was closed to all traffic in 1979 following one of many landslips.

== Sport ==
In 1944, Hope Sports Club was founded to provide facilities for the village and nearby Aston and Brough.

The village is also home to Hope Valley RUFC, who play their home games at Hope Sports Club. Formed in 1979, after rugby enthusiasts from the local villages organised a match with a barrel of beer for the winners, the club saw success in the 1990s in both the Notts, Lincs &amp; Derbyshire league and cup competitions. Several players went on to represent national league clubs, whilst 2009 to 2011 saw two successive league titles. The club currently competes in the NOWIRUL Division 3 South.

== Education ==
Hope Primary School, built in 1912 to a design by George H. Widdows, serves the village. The building has been recommended for Listing at Grade II (1). Hope has a small secondary school Hope Valley College.

<doc id="326930" wikidata="Q1047050" url="?curid=326930" title="Usage (language)">
<text>The usage of a language is the ways in which its written and spoken variations are routinely employed by its speakers; that is, it refers to &quot;the collective habits of a language&#x27;s native speakers&quot;, as opposed to idealized models of how a language works (or should work) in the abstract. For instance, Fowler characterized usage as &quot;the way in which a word or phrase is normally and correctly used&quot; and as the &quot;points of grammar, syntax, style, and the choice of words.&quot; In everyday usage, language is used differently, depending on the situation and individual. Individual language users can shape language structures and language usage based on their community.

In the descriptive tradition of language analysis, by way of contrast, &quot;correct&quot; tends to mean functionally adequate for the purposes of the speaker or writer using it, and adequately idiomatic to be accepted by the listener or reader; usage is also, however, a concern for the prescriptive tradition, for which &quot;correctness&quot; is a matter of arbitrating style.

Common usage may be used as one of the criteria of laying out prescriptive norms for codified standard language usage. 

Everyday language users, including editors and writers, look at dictionaries, style guides, usage guides, and other published authoritative works to help inform their language decisions. This takes place because of the perception that Standard English is determined by language authorities. For many language users, the dictionary is the source of correct language use, as far as accurate vocabulary and spelling go. Modern dictionaries are not generally prescriptive, but they often include &quot;usage notes&quot; which may describe words as &quot;formal&quot;, &quot;informal&quot;, &quot;slang&quot;, and so on. &quot;Despite occasional usage notes, lexicographers generally disclaim any intent to guide writers and editors on the thorny points of English usage.&quot;

==History==
According to Jeremy Butterfield, &quot;The first person we know of who made &quot;usage&quot; refer to language was Daniel Defoe, at the end of the seventeenth century&quot;. Defoe proposed the creation of a language society of 36 individuals who would set prescriptive language rules for the approximately six million English speakers.

The Latin equivalent &quot;usus&quot; was a crucial term in the research of Danish linguists Otto Jespersen and Louis Hjelmslev. They used the term to designate usage that has widespread or significant acceptance among speakers of a language, regardless of its conformity to the sanctioned standard language norms.

<text>Hathersage ( ) is a village and civil parish in the Peak District in Derbyshire, England. It lies slightly to the north of the River Derwent, approximately south-west of Sheffield.

==Toponymy==
The origin of its name is disputed, although it is generally accepted that the second half derives from the Old English word &quot;ecg&quot; meaning &quot;edge&quot;. In 1086, it was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Hereseige&quot; and, around 1220, as &quot;Hauersegg&quot;.

==History==
=== Pre-history ===
Mesolithic microliths have been found below Stanage Edge, indicating ancient occupation of the area.

In the Outseats area, there is evidence of Bronze Age field system, settlement and burial cairn at Dennis Knoll. Close to a now recumbent 2.3m high boundary marker on Bamford Moor is an embanked stone circle or possibly a ring cairn between 11m and 10m diameter.

=== Roman period ===
There are remains of a Romano-British settlement, possibly a farmstead at a location known as the Warren in the Outseats area. Finds from this site include Roman period pottery and a gritstone quern. An early lead smelting site, variously interpreted as Roman or early Medieval, has been found at Bole Hill.

=== Medieval period ===

The Domesday Book records that, in 1066, Hathersage was held by Leofric and his brother Leofnoth. By 1086, Ralph son of Hubert is listed as both Lord and Tenant-in-chief. The population in 1086 was 8 villagers and 2 smallholders.

The earliest recorded church was built by Richard Bassett, son of Ralph Bassett, Chancellor of England in the reign of Henry I. The present Grade-I-listed structure dates mainly from the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The church, St Michael and All Angels&#x27;, has a stained-glass window by Charles Kempe, which was removed from Derwent Chapel before it was submerged under the Ladybower Reservoir. Near the church is an earthwork called Camp Green, thought to have been constructed during the Danish occupation. It is also scheduled as a Norman ringwork castle of the 11th/12th century. In the graveyard lies the base and lower shaft of a plain early Saxon cross.

In 1566, Christopher Schutz, a German immigrant, who invented a process for drawing wire, set up a works in Hathersage. This became important in sieves used by miners and later developed into pin and needle production. This led to one of the first Factory Acts, because inhalation of grinding dust resulted in a life expectancy of only thirty years. In the mid-18th century, Hathersage became famous for its brass buttons. Some of the mill buildings from this era have been converted into flats.

In 1728, Daniel Defoe recorded how the moors around Hathersage were the source of building stones and millstones. Millstones were used in wood-pulping industries in the area and were also exported to North America, Russia and Scandinavia for the same purpose. Locally, the millstones were also used for crushing lead ore and the ingredients for paint. In Dorset, Peak stones were used for farm meal and barley crushing. The local gritstone tended to discolour bread, so were not generally used to grind wheat.

=== Industrial Revolution ===
There is evidence of a post-medieval lime kiln, possibly constructed 1830s in the Outseats area. In the 18th century, the village was connected to Sheffield by the Sheffield to Hathersage Turnpike.

== Economy ==
Hathersage is a tourist destination because of the scenery of the Hope and Derwent valleys, its literary connections and easy access by train or road from Sheffield and Manchester. Its visitors come to swim (open-air heated swimming pool, with cafe open all year), climb (Stanage Edge, which with other nearby edges have been the nursery for many famous British rock and mountain climbers) or ramble in its river valleys or hillwalk on its open moors. Hathersage Moor is the site of the Carl Wark hillfort and Higger Tor; both are now within the Sheffield boundary.

In 1990, the cutler David Mellor opened the Round Building built on the site of a former gasometer as a cutlery factory in the village. The building was designed by architect Sir Michael Hopkins. In 2007, an extension to the old retort house on the site was opened as a design museum. Mellor&#x27;s wife, Fiona MacCarthy, continued to live in Hathersage.

Hathersage has two business parks: Hathersage Business Park and Hathersage Hall Business Centre.

Hathersage has three churches, one school and numerous community organisations. There is an annual gala, scarecrow building competition and well dressing in July. On 1 April 2015, Hathersage and Outseats, the two parishes that comprised the village, were replaced by a single new parish council, called Hathersage Parish Council. The population recorded at the 2011 Census was 1,433, although the parish council website says the village has a population of 2,000.

==Transport==
The village is served by Hathersage railway station on the trans-Pennine Hope Valley Line. Services run generally hourly in both directions between Sheffield and Manchester Piccadilly, operated mainly by Northern Trains.

Hathersage is served by the 271 and 272 bus services on the Sheffield to Castleton route, which are operated by Hulley’s and First South Yorkshire, and by service 257 run by Hulleys of Baslow.

== Education ==
The village is served by Hathersage St Michael&#x27;s C of E (A) Primary School which offers education from Nursery up to Year 6. The school was rated as &#x27;good&#x27; in its November 2016 Ofsted report.

The nearest secondary school is Hope Valley College.

==Cultural references==

Stones in the churchyard mark what is known as the grave of Little John, where in 1780 James Shuttleworth claims to have unearthed a thigh bone measuring . This would have made Little John in height. One claimant to Robin Hood &quot;of Locksley&quot; is the village of Loxley, only eight miles over the moors on the edge of Sheffield. A number of local landmarks are associated with Robin Hood, such as Robin Hood&#x27;s Cross on Abney Moor, Robin Hood&#x27;s Stoop on Offerton Moor, Hood Brook and Robin Hood’s Cave on Stanage Edge.

In 1845, Charlotte Brontë stayed at the Hathersage vicarage, visiting her friend Ellen Nussey, whose brother was the vicar, while she was writing &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Many of the locations mentioned in her novel match locations in Hathersage, the name Eyre being that of a family of the local gentry. Her &quot;Thornfield Hall&quot; is accepted as being based on North Lees Hall, on the outskirts of Hathersage.

Some of the scenes of the horror film &quot;Let Sleeping Corpses Lie&quot; (1974, directed by Jorge Grau, also known as &quot;The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue&quot;) were shot at St. Michael&#x27;s Church in Hathersage.

==Sport==
Hathersage is home to Hathersage F.C. who currently compete in the Hope Valley Amateur League.

Hathersage Cricket Club and ground is based on Baulk Lane, Hathersage. The club have three senior teams: a 1st and 2nd XI that compete in the Yorkshire and Derbyshire Cricket League and a Friendly Sunday XI. The club also have an active junior training section that play league cricket in the North Derbyshire Youth Cricket League.

The Fat Boys Stanage Struggle is a popular local fell race that starts in Hathersage, altitude , and routes up to and along Stanage Edge to High Neb, , before returning to the village below.

<text>The United States Army Command and General Staff College (CGSC or, obsolete, USACGSC) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, is a graduate school for United States Army and sister service officers, interagency representatives, and international military officers. The college was established in 1881 by William Tecumseh Sherman as the School of Application for Infantry and Cavalry (later simply the Infantry and Cavalry School), a training school for infantry and cavalry officers. In 1907 it changed its title to the School of the Line. The curriculum expanded throughout World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War and continues to adapt to include lessons learned from current conflicts.

In addition to the main campus at Fort Leavenworth, the college has satellite campuses at Fort Belvoir, Virginia; Fort Gregg-Adams, Virginia; Fort Eisenhower, Georgia; and Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. The college also maintains a distance-learning modality for some of its instruction.

==Mission statement==
The United States Army Command and General Staff College (CGSC) educates, trains and develops leaders for Unified Land Operations in a joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational operational environment; and to advance the art and science of the Profession of Arms in support of Army operational requirements. 

==Schools==
The college consists of four schools: the Command and General Staff School, the School of Advanced Military Studies, the School for Command Preparation, and the Sergeants Major Academy.
* Command and General Staff School (CGSS) delivers a ten-month Command and General Staff Officers Course (CGSOC) in residence at Fort Leavenworth, KS, to just over 1,200 U.S. military officers, international military officers, and interagency partners each academic year. Additionally, the School teaches CGSOC Common Core to 960 students at four satellite campuses, and the CGSOC Common Core and Advanced Operations Course (AOC) via distance learning (DL) to approximately 5,300 active and reserve component officers around the world. Resident CGSOC students are eligible to pursue the Masters of Operational Studies (MOS) or the Master of Military Art and Science (MMAS). Chapter 7 details CGSS delivery of CGSOC.
– The School of Professional Military Education at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC) on Fort Benning, GA, offers the ten-month resident Command and General Staff Officer Course in Spanish to approximately 64 US and international officers each year. Since 2012, CGSOC students at SPME have been eligible to pursue the MMAS.
* School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) provides the Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) to 144 officers – most of whom just graduated from CGSOC – and the Advanced Strategic Leadership Studies Program (ASLSP) for 16 Senior Service College-select U.S. officers, international officers, and U.S. agency partners. All graduates of AMSP receive the Master of Arts in Military Operations, while graduates of ASLSP receive a Master of Arts in Strategic Studies. SAMS also manages the Army’s Advanced Strategic Planning and Policy Program (ASP3) within which Army officers pursue PhDs in international relations, public policy, economics, and history from leading universities in the U.S. and United Kingdom. There are currently 103 carefully selected senior Army strategic planners and future leaders in this program.
* School for Command Preparation (SCP) provides continuing education for future Army battalion and brigade commanders, command sergeants major, and spouses in ten 1-4 week courses offered multiple times during each academic year. SCP’s important mission and ten courses are characterized in Chapter 10.
* The Sergeants Major Academy (SGM-A) on Fort Bliss, TX, became CGSC&#x27;s fourth school and a branch campus in March 2018. Each year, SGM-A offers the ten-month Sergeants Major Course-Resident (SMC-R) to 720 senior U.S. and international noncommissioned officers, and the SMC via distributed learning to another 1,320 mainly Army Reserve and National Guard NCOs around the world.

==Master of Military Art and Science degree==

The Command and General Staff College confers a Master of Military Art and Science (MMAS) professional degree to graduates of the School of Advanced Military Studies as well as graduates of the Command and General Staff School who complete a thesis-level research paper. The degree is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission for collegiate institutions in the midwestern United States.

<doc id="326939" wikidata="Q1919251" url="?curid=326939" title="Meldrim Thomson Jr.">
<text>Meldrim Thomson Jr. (March 8, 1912 – April 19, 2001) was an American politician who served three terms as the 73rd governor of New Hampshire from 1973 to 1979. A Republican, he was known as a strong supporter of conservative political values.

==Early life==

Thomson was born in 1912 in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, the son of Meldrim and Marion (Booth) Thomson, and was raised in Georgia and Florida. He was an Eagle Scout. Thomson attended Mercer University, Washington and Jefferson College, and the University of Georgia School of Law and was admitted to the practice of law in Florida in 1936.

In 1938, he married his secretary, Anne Gale Kelly, and together they had six children.

Thomson made his fortune publishing law books. In 1952, he founded Equity Publishing Corp., which published the laws of New Hampshire, Vermont, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico in English and Spanish. In 1955, he moved his family to New Hampshire, where he became involved in local and state educational and tax issues.

==Political career==
In 1966, as chairman of the Orford School Board, Thomson refused to accept federal education aid because he said there were too many strings attached. He lost races for governor in Republican primaries in 1968 and 1970, running again in the 1970 general election on the third-party American Independent party. Receiving 10% of the vote 

==Governor of New Hampshire==

===Elections===
In 1972, Thomson ran for governor again as a Republican. He defeated governor Walter R. Peterson Jr. In the Republican primary and faced Democrat Robert J. Crowley. In the general election he pledged to veto any new sales or income tax that was put on his desk, and he further promised not to raise existing taxes. Thomson was elected governor defeating Crowley 41% to 39%.

In 1974, Thomson ran for a second term against Democrat Richard W. Leonard. Thomson was narrowly reelected, defeating Leonard 51% to 49%. In 1976, Thomson ran for a third term against Democrat Harry V. Spanos. He was re-elected in a landslide 58% to 42%. In 1978, Thomson ran for a fourth term, defeating former governor Wesley Powell in the Republican primary and faced Democrat Hugh Gallen. In the general election, Powell ran as an independent, splitting the Republican vote. Thomson lost re-election to Gallen 49% to 45%. In 1980, Thomson initially ran for president as a third party candidate but dropped out and ran for governor again as a Republican, defeating Lou D&#x27;Allesandro for Republican nomination. Facing Gallen in a rematch, Thomson was defeated in a landslide 59% to 41%. In 1982, he ran for governor as an independent, getting just 2% of the vote.

===Tenure===

Thomson coined the slogans &quot;Low taxes are the result of low spending&quot; and &quot;Ax the Tax&quot; to represent his fiscal philosophy. He was also a strong proponent of state sovereignty. When Thomson learned that Massachusetts tax agents were at New Hampshire liquor stores taking down the numbers on cars with Massachusetts license plates, he had them arrested. When he learned that Maine had arrested a Portsmouth, New Hampshire lobsterman, in Maine waters, he began what was known as the &quot;Lobster war.&quot; The conflict ended in the U.S. Supreme Court with the drawing of an ocean boundary between the two states at the mouth of the Piscataqua River.

In 1978, Thomson appointed David Souter to the Superior Court bench. Souter would later become a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Thomson also appointed Ivorey Cobb, the first African-American judge in New Hampshire state history, to the New Hampshire Commission for Civil Rights.

==Controversies==
During his governorship, and thereafter, Thomson took the following actions:

*in 1976 and 1977 he ordered the flag at the statehouse to be flown at half-staff including on Good Friday to &quot;memorialise the death of Christ on the Cross.&quot;
*during the 1977 anti-nuclear demonstrations at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station, he was brought in by helicopter to order the arrest of 1,400 protesters.
*personally arresting speeders from his official car.
*visiting South Africa in 1978 and then praising the government.
*sending out a press release in 1977 saying that he wanted journalists to keep the &quot;Christ&quot; in Christmas and not call it Xmas, which, he asserted, was a pagan spelling of Christmas

==1980 presidential election bid==
Thomson was one of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s staunchest supporters in 1976, as the former California governor challenged President Gerald Ford for the Republican presidential nomination. Thomson was dismayed by Reagan&#x27;s announcement that he would select moderate Republican Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania as his running mate should he win the nomination.

After he was defeated in 1978, Thomson left the Republican party to form his own Constitution Party. However, after getting on the presidential general-election ballot in Alabama, Kansas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Maine, his campaign contributions dried up when it was evident that Ronald Reagan was going to win the Republican nomination for president. Thomson then ended his campaign for president and returned to the Republican Party.

==Death and honors==
Thomson died in 2001 aged 89 from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and heart problems in Orford, New Hampshire.

In 2002, the state named both a state building and state road in honor of Thomson. The state office complex on Hazen Drive in Concord was named &quot;Meldrim Thomson Jr. State Office Complex.&quot; A 16-mile stretch of Route 25A, where his Mt. Cube Farm lined both sides of the road, was named the &quot;Governor Meldrim Thomson Scenic Highway.&quot;

<text>Electronic cash was, until 2007, the debit card system of the German Banking Industry Committee, the association that represents the top German financial interest groups. Usually paired with a transaction account or current account, cards with an Electronic Cash logo were only handed out by proper credit institutions. An electronic card payment was generally made by the card owner entering their PIN (Personal Identification Number) at a so-called EFT-POS-terminal (Electronic-Funds-Transfer-Terminal). The name &quot;EC&quot; originally comes from the unified European checking system Eurocheque. Comparable debit card systems are Maestro and Visa Electron. Banks and credit institutions who issued these cards often paired EC debit cards with Maestro functionality. These combined cards, recognizable by an additional Maestro logo, were referred to as &quot;EC/Maestro cards&quot;.

== Providers ==
All of Germany&#x27;s providers registered with the Central Credit Committee are connected in the working group &quot;Arbeitskreis der electronic cash-Netzbetreiber&quot;. According to the Federal Cartel Office of Germany, the following providers have considerable market shares:

* Ingenico Payment Services GmbH (before 2014 – easycash), Ratingen, with a market share of 40% (as recorded in 2007)
* TeleCash GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Stuttgart, with a market share of more than 20%
* B+S – B+S Card Service GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, with a market share of 10 to 15%
* WEAT – WEAT Electronic Datenservice GmbH, Düsseldorf, with a market share of less than 10%
* montrada – montrada GmbH, Bad Vilbel, with a market share of less than 10% (as recorded in 2006); in 2010 they claimed they were now Germany&#x27;s third most important provider
* InterCard – InterCard AG, Taufkirchen b. München, with a market share of less than 10%

In 2006, the following companies had market shares of less than 3% each:
DVB Processing, CardProcess, Tyco/ADT, Bank-Verlag, CardTech, CCV Allcash, EKS, Alphyra, Experian, Paycom, Lavego, Telekurs.

In 2010, only CardTech and Lavego remain from the 2006 list (as well as the six top companies), with AGES, BCB Processing, CardProcess, Deutsche Bahn, Deutsche BP, Douglas Informatik &amp; Service, Elavon, ESSO Deutschland, ICP International Cash Processing GmbH, Postbank, and Shell also offering services now.

== Acceptance marks ==

Currently there are two valid acceptance marks for electronic cash: the electronic cash PIN-Pad and girocard pictograms. The &quot;Technical attachment to the eligibility requirements for participation in the electronic cash system of the German credit services sector (retailing requirements)&quot; includes the retailer&#x27;s obligation to accept both of these acceptance marks at newly set up points of sale for the time being. Furthermore, the acceptance marks are printed on the debit cards of German financial institutions.

The trademarks on these two acceptance marks are held for the Central Credit Committee by the &quot;EURO Kartensysteme GmbH.&quot;

For a transitional period another pictogram, the ec electronic cash pictogram, is still to be found as an acceptance mark on debit cards issued by the German credit services sector and on POS terminals. This mark was used during the transition from Eurocheque (payment via certified cheque) to payment via ec-card (card based payment with PIN). After the abolition of the Eurocheque, the allocation of ec-cards by the German credit services sector was suspended and the trademarks for Eurocheque were sold to MasterCard.

The German banking sector no longer uses the ec electronic cash sign as an official acceptance mark for electronic cash. Instead, newly issued debit cards show the two current acceptance marks described above. However, the old ec electronic cash sign can still be found on some debit cards in circulation. These cards, which were issued before the new pictograms were introduced, remain valid, but will gradually be replaced by the new cards as they expire. Newly installed electronic cash POS terminals also bear the new pictograms.

== Hardware and software ==

A card terminal, also called EFT-POS terminal, consists of hardware and software components. The main hardware components are the security module, the PIN pad, the printer, the display, the magnetic card reader, the chip-card reader, the communication module and the power supply.

The software mainly consists of the operating system, the communication software, the software of the security module and various software modules for OPT (Online-Personalization of Terminals), EMV as well as additional applications such as prepayment, customer loyalty systems and remote administration. The most important element is the so-called security module, without which the terminal can only be used for electronic direct debit (EDD) transactions.

All card terminals working with the electronic cash system have to be certified by the ZKA (the German Central Credit Committee) in order to take part in cashless payment transactions. Terminals working exclusively with EDD do not require a ZKA certificate. Operating a card terminal requires a &quot;provider contract&quot; with the network operator. The data collected by the terminal is processed by the provider. For the time the terminal is in use the user (for example, the retailer) can contact the service provider. He can call a hotline and is guaranteed on-site technical support by a technician. He has a contact person who helps with questions about the account, transaction control, managing the contract, etc.

== Chip card vs magnetic stripe card ==

Most ec-cards are equipped with a magnetic stripe. This magnetic stripe is read-only and thus only contains static information. In addition, since the year 2000, more and more banks have started to add the EMV chip to newly issued cards. By 2008, 70% of the cards issued had that chip. The new chip is capable of processing data like a small computer and can respond to requests without the entire contents being read. In contrast to magnetic stripes, the chips cannot be copied easily. To maintain downward compatibility, especially with the Maestro card, which is most often integrated, most cards are still equipped with magnetic stripes. However, usually the chip as the more secure option is chosen wherever both means of communication are technically possible.

The magnetic stripe on a card has three paths. Until 30 September 2009, path 3 of the magnetic stripe was read for payments in Germany. Since then, the international standard path 2 is being read.

== Payment authorization ==

=== Electronic cash with a magnetic stripe card ===

Paying at a POS terminal (point of sale) works as follows: Online authorization validates the card against the list of blocked account numbers and checks the given PIN. Next, it verifies whether the amount due is covered by the account balance (balance plus overdraft facility minus pending debits). Payment is rejected if any of the criteria listed above are not met. The authorization as well as the validation regarding sufficient funds and the daily limit is carried out by the headquarters of the institute from which the card is issued. 
General procedure for electronic cash payment using the magnetic stripe:
=== Electronic cash with chip, chip offline ===

The general procedure for electronic cash payment using a chip is as follows:

# The amount is entered.
# The card is requested, and is read with the help of the chip reader.
# The security module is activated, and requests the PIN.
# The accuracy of the PIN is checked in the chip. If the PIN is entered correctly, the wrong entry counter is set to zero. If the PIN given is incorrect, the wrong entry count increases to one, and if it is entered incorrectly three times, the bank can block the card. The bank can unlock the card with the help of special bank terminals (BSFT).
# The request for payment is sent to the card chip. If there is enough money and/or credit on the card, the amount will be deducted and the credit limit updated on the chip. Go to step 11.
# The communications module establishes the connection to the provider and logs the data exchange.
# Data exchanges are carried out via the communications link and plausibility checks.
# Via the online connection the bank verifies that the card is not on the blacklist, and that the amount requested is not more than the available amount.
# If one of these criteria is not met, payment will be rejected.
# A payment approval (authorization) is transmitted to the chip and stored there.
# The following information may, for example, be saved: &quot;Further payments to the total of 500 euros before the end of the month are allowed.&quot;
# The communication module logs off at the provider and terminates the connection.
# The printer creates a record of payment or rejection, which is shown on the screen. The confirmation of payment guarantees the retailer payment (if submitted on time).

Steps 3 to 6 are not applicable if the credit limit has not been reached, thus resulting in no transaction costs. Additionally, the payment process is often accelerated because no online connection needs to be established. The bank thereby grants the customer additional credit.

==== Example ====
* You make a first withdrawal of 30 euros. The terminal sends a request to the bank and subsequently saves the payment authorisation. Further withdrawals up to a total amount of 500 euros are possible until the end of the month.
* In a nearby shop, you pay another 70 euros using electronic cash. Another request to the bank is unnecessary as the payment permission is already stored on the chip. A credit line of 430 euros is now left on the chip.
* The next day of the same month you want to pay 419 euros using electronic cash. Again, a request to the bank is unnecessary since the payment permission is already on the chip. A credit line of 11 euros is now left on the card.
* The last day of this month you want to make a payment of another 12 euros in another shop. The available credit on the chip is now too low. A connection to the bank is established. The bank states that 12 euros are immediately available and that the credit line is being raised by another 500 euros until the end of the next month.

=== Costs ===

The charge made for an electronic cash transaction depends on the amount of the payment. It is 0.3% of the amount with a minimum of 8 cents. In the oil industry the basic charge is 0.2% of the amount but with a minimum of 4 cents.

Depending on the provider, further charges, e.g. for technical deployment, may be incurred.

According to retailers&#x27; terms and conditions, shops have to accept electronic cash payments on the same conditions and at the same prices as with cash. Thus, they have to pay the charges and are not allowed to set a minimum sales amount.

== Modes of payment with electronic cash debit cards ==

Many retailers provide the option of paying by card or electronic cash, as both payment systems include a guarantee of payment. The electronic direct debit (EDD) system offers no such guarantee and thus exposes the retailer to a default risk.

* In 2005, 13.1% of all payments in Germany were made using electronic cash (payments included the entering of the PIN). In 2009, the percentage of payments using electronic cash went up to 19.4%; payments amounted to 71 billion euros.
* The electronic purse card or &quot;Geldkarte&quot; can also be used for payments. With an annual turnover of 0.1 billion euros its market share amounts to less than 0.04%.
* ELV (&quot;Elektronisches Lastschriftverfahren&quot;, electronic debit advice procedure) online or offline. 12% of 2005 turnover in commerce was processed using this method. The market share in 2009 was 12.2%, or 45 billion euros. The technology was introduced in 1984. When using &quot;ELV online&quot; (also called OLV) every online payment is checked against a credit rating score and a nationwide blacklist. When ELV takes place offline, there is no telephone line and no checking. It is the most inexpensive method for retailers. All procedures read only the account number, the bank code and the card number from the magnetic stripe or the chip. In contrast to the electronic cash method the customer authorises a direct withdrawal with his signature.
*POZ (&quot;Point of Sale ohne Zahlungsgarantie&quot;, point of sale without payment guarantee). Unlike OLV and ELV, which are procedures used in retail, POZ was a procedure used by the ZKA (&quot;Zentraler Kreditausschuss&quot;, the German Central Credit Committee) from its introduction in 1994 up to its abolition on December 31, 2006.

<text>The siege of Leningrad was a military blockade undertaken by the Axis powers against the city of Leningrad (present-day Saint Petersburg) in the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front of World War II from 1941 to 1944. Leningrad, the country&#x27;s second largest city, was besieged by Germany and Finland for 872 days, but never captured. The siege was the most destructive in history and possibly the most deadly, causing an estimated 1.5 million deaths. It was not classified as a war crime at the time, but some historians have since classified it as a genocide due to the intentional destruction of the city and the systematic starvation of its civilian population.

In August 1941, Germany&#x27;s Army Group North reached the suburbs of Leningrad as Finnish forces moved to encircle the city from the north. Land routes from Leningrad to the rest of the Soviet Union were cut on 8 September 1941, beginning the siege. The Germans decided to bomb the city and starve its inhabitants rather than attempt to capture it; many residents starved during the winter of 1941–1942. Supplies were delivered to city by air, by ship over Lake Ladoga, or over the Road of Life, a highway built on the lake when it was frozen. A Red Army offensive opened a narrow land corridor to Leningrad on 18 January 1943, but the siege was not fully broken until 27 January 1944.
==Background==

The capture of Leningrad was one of three strategic goals of the German Operation Barbarossa and as a result, Leningrad was the main target of Army Group North. The strategy was motivated by Leningrad&#x27;s political status as the former capital of Russia as well as by Leningrad&#x27;s political status as the symbolic capital of the Russian Revolution and its symbolic status as the ideological center of Bolshevism, hated by the Nazi Party, the city&#x27;s military importance as a main base of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, and its industrial strength, including its numerous arms factories. In 1939, the city was responsible for 11% of all Soviet industrial output.

It has been said that Adolf Hitler was so confident that he would capture Leningrad that he had invitations printed to the victory celebrations to be held in the city&#x27;s Hotel Astoria.

Although various theories have been put forward about Germany&#x27;s plans for Leningrad, including making it the capital of the new Ingermanland province of the Reich in Generalplan Ost, it is clear Hitler intended to utterly destroy the city and its population. According to a directive sent to Army Group North on 29 September 1941:
Hitler&#x27;s ultimate plan was to raze Leningrad and give areas north of the Neva to the Finns.

==Preparations==

===German plans===

Army Group North under Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb advanced to Leningrad, its primary objective. By early August, Army Group North was seriously over-extended, having advanced on a widening front and dispersed its forces on several axes of advance. Leeb estimated he needed 35 divisions for all of his tasks, while he only had 26. The attack resumed on 10 August but immediately encountered strong opposition around Luga. Elsewhere, Leeb&#x27;s forces were able to take Kingisepp and Narva on 17 August. The army group reached Chudovo on 20 August, severing the rail link between Leningrad and Moscow. Tallinn was captured on 28 August.

Finnish military forces were north of Leningrad, while German forces occupied territories to the south. Both German and Finnish forces had the goal of encircling Leningrad and maintaining the siege perimeter, thus cutting off all communication with the city and preventing the defenders from receiving any suppliesalthough Finnish participation in the siege mainly consisted of a recapture of lands lost in the Winter War. The Germans planned on lack of food being their chief weapon against the citizens; German scientists had calculated the city would reach starvation after only a few weeks.

===Leningrad fortified region===

On Friday, 27 June 1941, the Council of Deputies of the Leningrad organised &quot;First response groups&quot; of civilians. In the next days, Leningrad&#x27;s civilian population was informed of the danger and over a million citizens were mobilised for the construction of fortifications. Several lines of defences were built along the city&#x27;s perimeter to repel hostile forces approaching from north and south by means of civilian resistance.

In the south, the fortified line ran from the mouth of the Luga River to Chudovo, Gatchina, Uritsk, Pulkovo and then through the Neva River. Another line of defence passed through Peterhof to Gatchina, Pulkovo, Kolpino and Koltushy. In the north the defensive line against the Finns, the Karelian Fortified Region, had been maintained in Leningrad&#x27;s northern suburbs since the 1930s, and was now returned to service. A total of of timber barricades, of wire entanglements, of anti-tank ditches, 5,000 earth-and-timber emplacements and reinforced concrete weapon emplacements and of open trenches were constructed or excavated by civilians. Even the guns from the cruiser were removed from the ship to be used to defend Leningrad.

==Establishment==

The 4th Panzer Group from East Prussia took Pskov following a swift advance and reached Novgorod by 16 August. After the capture of Novgorod, General Hoepner&#x27;s 4th Panzer Group continued its progress towards Leningrad. However, the 18th Armydespite some 350,000 men lagging behindforced its way to Ostrov and Pskov after the Soviet troops of the Northwestern Front retreated towards Leningrad. On 10 July, both Ostrov and Pskov were captured and the 18th Army reached Narva and Kingisepp, from where advance toward Leningrad continued from the Luga River line. This had the effect of creating siege positions from the Gulf of Finland to Lake Ladoga, with the eventual aim of isolating Leningrad from all directions. The Finnish Army was then expected to advance along the eastern shore of Lake Ladoga.

The last rail connection to Leningrad was cut on 30 August, when the German forces reached the River Neva. In early September, Leeb was confident Leningrad was about to fall. Having received reports on the evacuation of civilians and industrial goods, Leeb and the OKH believed the Red Army was preparing to abandon the city. Consequently, on 5 September, he received new orders, including the destruction of the Red Army forces around the city. By 15 September, Panzer Group 4 was to be transferred to Army Group Centre so it could participate in a renewed offensive towards Moscow. The expected surrender did not materialise although the renewed German offensive cut off the city by 8 September. Lacking sufficient strength for major operations, Leeb had to accept the army group might not be able to take the city, although hard fighting continued along his front throughout October and November.

The 14th Army of the Soviet Red Army defended Murmansk and the 7th Army defended Ladoga Karelia; thus they did not participate in the initial stages of the siege. The 8th Army was initially part of the Northwestern Front and retreated through the Baltics. It was transferred to the Northern Front on 14 July when the Soviets evacuated Tallinn.

On 23 August, the Northern Front was divided into the Leningrad Front and the Karelian Front, as it became impossible for front headquarters to control everything between Murmansk and Leningrad.

Marshal Georgy Zhukov states, &quot;Ten volunteer &quot;opolcheniye&quot; divisions were formed in Leningrad in the first three months of the war, as well as 16 separate artillery and machine-gun &quot;opolcheniye&quot; battalions.&quot;

===Severing the lines of communication===
On 6 August, Hitler repeated his order: &quot;Leningrad first, Donetsk Basin second, Moscow third.&quot; Arctic convoys using the Northern Sea Route delivered American Lend-Lease and British food and war materiel supplies to the Murmansk railhead (although the rail link to Leningrad was cut off by Finnish armies just north of the city), as well as several other locations in Lapland.

===Encirclement of Leningrad===
Finnish intelligence had broken some of the Soviet military codes and read their low-level communications. This was particularly helpful for Hitler, who constantly requested intelligence information about Leningrad. Finland&#x27;s role in Operation Barbarossa was laid out in Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Directive 21&quot;, &quot;The mass of the Finnish army will have the task, in accordance with the advance made by the northern wing of the German armies, of tying up maximum Russian (&quot;sic&quot;Soviet) strength by attacking to the west, or on both sides, of Lake Ladoga.&quot; The last rail connection to Leningrad was severed on 30 August 1941, when the Germans reached the Neva River. On 8 September, the road to the besieged city was severed when the Germans reached Lake Ladoga at Shlisselburg, leaving just a corridor of land between Lake Ladoga and Leningrad which remained unoccupied by Axis forces. Bombing on 8 September caused 178 fires.

On 21 September 1941, German High Command considered how to destroy Leningrad. Occupying the city was ruled out &quot;because it would make us responsible for food supply&quot;. The resolution was to lay the city under siege and bombardment, starving its population. &quot;Early next year, we [will] enter the city (if the Finns do it first we do not object), lead those still alive into inner Russia or into captivity, wipe Leningrad from the face of the earth through demolitions, and hand the area north of the Neva to the Finns.&quot; On 7 October, Hitler sent a further directive signed by Alfred Jodl reminding Army Group North not to accept capitulation.

===Finnish participation===

By August 1941, the Finns advanced to within of the northern suburbs of Leningrad at the 1939 Finnish-Soviet border, threatening the city from the north; they were also advancing through East Karelia, east of Lake Ladoga, and threatening the city from the east. The Finnish forces crossed the pre-Winter War border on the Karelian Isthmus by eliminating Soviet salients at Beloostrov and Kirjasalo, thus straightening the frontline so that it ran along the old border near the shores of Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga, and those positions closest to Leningrad still lying on the pre-Winter War border.

According to Soviet claims, the Finnish advance was stopped in September through resistance by the Karelian Fortified Region; however, Finnish troops had already earlier in August 1941 received orders to halt the advance after reaching their goals, some of which lay beyond the pre-Winter War border. After reaching their respective goals, the Finns halted their advance and started moving troops to East Karelia.

For the next three years, the Finns did little to contribute to the battle for Leningrad, maintaining their lines. Their headquarters rejected German pleas for aerial attacks against Leningrad and did not advance farther south from the Svir River in occupied East Karelia (160 kilometres northeast of Leningrad), which they had reached on 7 September. In the southeast, the Germans captured Tikhvin on 8 November, but failed to complete their encirclement of Leningrad by advancing further north to join with the Finns at the Svir River. On 9 December, a counter-attack of the Volkhov Front forced the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; to retreat from their Tikhvin positions in the Volkhov River line.

On 6 September 1941, Germany&#x27;s chief of staff, Alfred Jodl, visited Helsinki. His main goal was to persuade Mannerheim to continue the offensive. In 1941, President Ryti declared to the Finnish Parliament that the aim of the war was to restore the territories lost during the Winter War and gain more territories in the east to create a &quot;Greater Finland&quot;. After the war, Ryti stated: &quot;On 24 August 1941 I visited the headquarters of Marshal Mannerheim. The Germans aimed us at crossing the old border and continuing the offensive to Leningrad. I said that the capture of Leningrad was not our goal and that we should not take part in it. Mannerheim and Minister of Defense Walden agreed with me and refused the offers of the Germans. The result was a paradoxical situation: the Germans could not approach Leningrad from the north...&quot; There was little or no systematic shelling or bombing from the Finnish positions.

The proximity of the Finnish border from downtown Leningradand the threat of a Finnish attack complicated the defence of the city. At one point, the defending front commander, Popov, could not release reserves opposing the Finnish forces to be deployed against the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; because they were needed to bolster the 23rd Army&#x27;s defences on the Karelian Isthmus. Mannerheim terminated the offensive on 31 August 1941, when the army had reached the 1939 border. Popov felt relieved, and redeployed two divisions to the German sector on 5 September.

Subsequently, the Finnish forces reduced the salients of Beloostrov and Kirjasalo, which had threatened their positions at the sea coast and south of the River Vuoksi. Lieutenant General Paavo Talvela and Colonel Järvinen, the commander of the Finnish Coastal Brigade responsible for Ladoga, proposed to the German headquarters the blocking of Soviet convoys on Lake Ladoga. The idea was proposed to the Germans on their own behalf going past both Finnish Navy HQ and General HQ. Germans responded positively to the proposition and informed the slightly surprised Finnswho apart from Talvela and Järvinen had very little knowledge of the propositionthat transport of the equipment for the Ladoga operation was already arranged. The German command formed the international naval detachment (which also included the Italian &quot;XII Squadriglia MAS&quot;) under Finnish command and the &quot;Einsatzstab Fähre Ost&quot; under German command. These naval units operated against the supply route in the summer and autumn of 1942, the only period the units were able to operate as freezing waters then forced the lightly equipped units to be moved away, and changes in front lines made it impractical to reestablish these units later in the war.

===Defensive operations===

The Leningrad Front (initially the Leningrad Military District) was commanded by Marshal Kliment Voroshilov. It included the 23rd Army in the northern sector between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga, and the 48th Army in the western sector between the Gulf of Finland and the Slutsk–Mga position. The Leningrad Fortified Region, the Leningrad garrison, the Baltic Fleet forces, and Koporye, Pulkovo, and Slutsk–Kolpino operational groups were also present.

==Defence of civilian evacuees==
According to Zhukov, &quot;Before the war Leningrad had a population of 3,103,000 and 3,385,000 counting the suburbs. As many as 1,743,129, including 414,148 children were evacuated&quot; between 29 June 1941 and 31 March 1943. They were moved to the Volga area, the Urals, Siberia and Kazakhstan.

By September 1941, the link with the Volkhov Front (commanded by Kirill Meretskov) was severed and the defensive sectors were held by four armies: 23rd Army in the northern sector, 42nd Army in the western sector, 55th Army in the southern sector, and the 67th Army in the eastern sector. The 8th Army of the Volkhov Front had the responsibility of maintaining the logistic route to the city in coordination with the Ladoga Flotilla. Air cover for the city was provided by the Leningrad military district PVO Corps and Baltic Fleet naval aviation units.

The defensive operation to protect the 1,400,000 civilian evacuees was part of the Leningrad counter-siege operations under the command of Andrei Zhdanov, Kliment Voroshilov, and Aleksei Kuznetsov. Additional military operations were carried out in coordination with Baltic Fleet naval forces under the general command of Admiral Vladimir Tributs. The Ladoga Flotilla under the command of V. Baranovsky, S.V. Zemlyanichenko, P.A. Traynin, and B.V. Khoroshikhin also played a major military role in helping with evacuation of the civilians.

===Bombardment===

The first success of the Leningrad air defence took place on the night of 23 June. The Ju 88A bomber from the 1st Air Corps KGr.806 was damaged by the AA fire of the 15th Battery of the 192nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, and made an emergency landing. All crew members, including the commander, Lieutenant Hans Turmeyer, were captured on the ground. The commander of the 15th Battery, Lieutenant Alexey Pimchenkov, was awarded the Order of the Red Banner.

By Monday, 8 September, German forces had largely surrounded the city, cutting off all supply routes to Leningrad and its suburbs. Unable to press home their offensive, and facing defences of the city organised by Marshal Zhukov, the Axis armies laid siege to the city for &quot;900 days and nights&quot;.

The air attack of Friday, 19 September, was particularly brutal. It was the heaviest air raid Leningrad suffered during the war, as 276 German bombers hit the city killing 1,000 civilians. Many of those killed were recuperating from battle wounds in hospitals that were hit by German bombs. Six air raids occurred that day. Five hospitals were damaged in the bombings, as well as the city&#x27;s largest shopping bazaar. Hundreds of people had run from the street into the store to take shelter from the air raid.

Artillery bombardment of Leningrad began in August, increasing in intensity during 1942 with the arrival of new equipment. It was stepped up further in 1943, when several times as many shells and bombs were used as in the year before. Against this, the Soviet Baltic Fleet navy aviation made over 100,000 air missions to support their military operations during the siege. German shelling and bombing killed 5,723 and wounded 20,507 civilians in Leningrad during the siege.

===Supplying the defenders===
To sustain the defence of the city, it was vitally important for the Red Army to establish a route for bringing a constant flow of supplies into Leningrad. This route, which became known as the Road of Life (), was effected over the southern part of Lake Ladoga and the corridor of land which remained unoccupied by Axis forces between Lake Ladoga and Leningrad. Transport across Lake Ladoga was achieved by means of watercraft during the warmer months and land vehicles driven over thick ice in winter (hence the route becoming known as the &quot;Ice Road&quot;). The security of the supply route was ensured by the Ladoga Flotilla, the Leningrad PVO Corps, and route security troops. Vital food supplies were thus transported to the village of Osinovets, from where they were transferred and transported over via a small suburban railway to Leningrad. The route had to be used also to evacuate civilians, since no evacuation plans had been executed in the chaos of the first winter of the war, and the city was completely isolated until 20 November, when the ice road over Lake Ladoga became operational. Vehicles risked becoming stuck in the snow or sinking through broken ice caused by constant German bombardments, but the road brought necessary military and food supplies in and took civilians and wounded soldiers out, allowing the city to continue resisting the enemy.

==Effect on the city==

The two-and-a-half-year siege caused the greatest destruction and the largest loss of life ever known in a modern city. On Hitler&#x27;s direct orders the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; looted and then destroyed most of the imperial palaces, such as the Catherine Palace, Peterhof Palace, Ropsha, Strelna, Gatchina, and other historic landmarks located outside the city&#x27;s defensive perimeter, with many art collections transported to Germany. A number of factories, schools, hospitals and other civil infrastructure were destroyed by air raids and long range artillery bombardment.

The 872 days of the siege caused extreme famine in the Leningrad region through disruption of utilities, water, energy and food supplies. This resulted in the deaths of up to 1,500,000 soldiers and civilians and the evacuation of 1,400,000 more (mainly women and children), many of whom died during evacuation due to starvation and bombardment. According to journalist Harrison E. Salisbury on the death toll of the siege, &quot;A total for Leningrad and vicinity of something over 1,000,000 deaths attributable to hunger, and an over-all total of deaths, civilian and military, on the order of 1,300,000 to 1,500,000 seems reasonable.&quot; According to military historian David M. Glantz, &quot;the number of soldiers and civilians who perished during the Battle for Leningrad amounted to the awesome total of between 1.6 and two million souls. These figures associated with the defence of a single city are six times greater than the United States&#x27; total death toll during the entirety of World War II&quot; and that &quot;In terms of drama, symbolism and sheer human suffering, however, the Battle for Leningrad has no peer either in the Great Patriotic War or in any other modern war&quot;. Military historian Victor Davis Hanson further affirmed that &quot;Leningrad was civilization&#x27;s most lethal siege&quot; and that &quot;More than one million died at Leningrad amid mass starvation, epidemic, cannibalism and daily barragesa greater death toll than any siege in history&quot;. The crippling starvation and famine extended beyond Leningrad itself, affecting the surrounding satellite cities as well and de facto including them into the blockade dynamics. The city of Pushkin, with half under formal German occupation and the other half serving as a de facto frontline, experienced similar conditions to those within Leningrad. Pushkinites were dying of mass hunger, the city was regularly shelled by Soviet forces, and the Germans did not introduce ration cards for bread until the summer of 1942.

Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery in Leningrad holds half a million civilian victims of the siege alone. Economic destruction and human losses in Leningrad on both sides exceeded those of the Battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Moscow, or the bombing of Tokyo. The siege of Leningrad ranks as the most lethal siege in world history, and some historians speak of the siege operations in terms of genocide, as a &quot;racially motivated starvation policy&quot; that became an integral part of the unprecedented German war of extermination against populations of the Soviet Union generally.
Civilians in the city suffered from extreme starvation, especially in the winter of 1941–42. From November 1941 to February 1942 the only food available to the citizen was 125 grams of bread per day, of which 50–60% consisted of sawdust and other inedible admixtures. In conditions of extreme temperatures (down to ), and with city transport out of service, even a distance of a few kilometres to a food distribution kiosk created an insurmountable obstacle for many citizens. Deaths peaked in January–February 1942 at 100,000 per month, mostly from starvation. People often died on the streets, and citizens soon became accustomed to the sight of death.

===Cannibalism===
While reports of cannibalism appeared in the winter of 1941–42, NKVD records on the subject were not published until 2004. Most evidence for cannibalism that surfaced before this time was anecdotal. Anna Reid points out that &quot;for most people at the time, cannibalism was a matter of second-hand horror stories rather than direct personal experience&quot;. Indicative of Leningraders&#x27; fears at the time, police would often threaten uncooperative suspects with imprisonment in a cell with cannibals. Dimitri Lazarev, a diarist during the worst moments in the Leningrad siege, recalls his daughter and niece reciting a terrifying nursery rhyme adapted from a pre-war song:

&quot;Sung to the tune of Mary Had A Little Lamb&quot;

NKVD files report the first use of human meat as food on 13 December 1941, with nine cases. A report ten days later outlines thirteen cases, which range from a mother smothering her eighteen-month-old to feed her three older children to a plumber killing his wife to feed his sons and nieces.

By December 1942, the NKVD had arrested 2,105 cannibalsdividing them into two legal categories: corpse-eating (трупоедства, &quot;trupoyedstvo&quot;) and person-eating (людоедства, &quot;lyudoyedstvo&quot;). The latter were usually shot while the former were sent to prison. The Soviet Criminal Code had no provision for cannibalism, so all convictions were carried out under Code Article 59–3, &quot;special category banditry&quot;. Instances of person-eating were significantly lower than that of corpse-eating; of the 300 people arrested in April 1942 for cannibalism, only 44 were murderers. 64% of cannibals were female, 44% were unemployed, 90% were illiterate or with only basic education, 15% were rooted inhabitants, and only 2% had any criminal records. More cases occurred in the outlying districts than in the city itself. Cannibals were often unsupported women with dependent children and no previous convictions, which allowed for a certain level of clemency in legal proceedings.

Given the scope of mass starvation, cannibalism was relatively rare. Far more common was murder for ration cards. In the first six months of 1942, Leningrad witnessed 1,216 such murders. At the same time, Leningrad was experiencing its highest mortality rate, as high as 100,000 people per month. Lisa Kirschenbaum notes that &quot;[rates] of cannibalism provided an opportunity for emphasizing that the majority of Leningraders managed to maintain their cultural norms in the most unimaginable circumstances.&quot;

==Soviet relief of the siege==
On 9 August 1942, the Symphony No. 7 &quot;Leningrad&quot; by Dmitri Shostakovich was performed by the Leningrad Radio Orchestra. The concert was broadcast on loudspeakers placed throughout the city and also aimed towards the enemy lines. The same day had been previously designated by Hitler to celebrate the fall of the city with a lavish banquet at Leningrad&#x27;s Astoria Hotel, and was a few days before the Sinyavino Offensive.

===Sinyavino Offensive===

The Sinyavino Offensive was a Soviet attempt to break the siege of the city in early autumn 1942. The 2nd Shock and the 8th armies were to link up with the forces of the Leningrad Front. At the same time the German side was preparing an offensive to capture the city, Operation Nordlicht (Northern Light), using the troops made available by the capture of Sevastopol. Neither side was aware of the other&#x27;s intentions until the battle started.

The offensive began on 27 August 1942 with some small-scale attacks by the Leningrad front, pre-empting &quot;&quot;Nordlicht&quot; by a few weeks. The successful start of the operation forced the Germans to redirect troops from the planned &quot;Nordlicht&quot;&quot; to counterattack the Soviet armies. The counteroffensive saw the first deployment of the Tiger tank, though with limited success. After parts of the 2nd Shock Army were encircled and destroyed, the Soviet offensive was halted. However, the German forces also had to abandon their offensive.

===Operation Iskra===

The encirclement was broken in the wake of Operation Iskra (Spark), a full-scale offensive conducted by the Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts. This offensive started in the morning of 12 January 1943. After fierce battles the Red Army units overcame the powerful German fortifications to the south of Lake Ladoga, and on 18 January 1943, the Volkhov Front&#x27;s 372nd Rifle Division met troops of the 123rd Rifle Brigade of the Leningrad Front, opening a wide land corridor, which could provide some relief to the besieged population of Leningrad.

The Spanish Blue Division faced a major Soviet attempt to break the siege of Leningrad in February 1943, when the 55th Army of the Soviet forces, reinvigorated after the victory at Stalingrad, attacked the Spanish positions at the Battle of Krasny Bor, near the main Moscow-Leningrad road. Despite very heavy casualties, the Spaniards were able to hold their ground against a Soviet force seven times larger and supported by tanks. The Soviet assault was contained by the Blue Division.

===Lifting the siege===
The siege continued until 27 January 1944, when the Soviet Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive expelled German forces from the southern outskirts of the city. This was a combined effort by the Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts, along with the 1st and 2nd Baltic Fronts. The Baltic Fleet provided 30% of aviation power for the final strike against the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. In the summer of 1944, the Finnish Defence Forces were pushed back to the other side of the Bay of Vyborg and the Vuoksi River.

The siege was also known as the Leningrad Blockade and the 900-Day Siege.

==Aftermath==

In his analysis of the siege of Leningrad, author Robert Forczyk highlights both the strategic and operational outcomes of the German offensive against the city. Forczyk asserts that although Hitler intended to destroy Leningrad as a symbol and center of Soviet power, this objective was not achieved:

During the siege some 3,200 residential buildings, 9,000 wooden houses were burned, and 840 factories and plants were destroyed in Leningrad and suburbs.

==Later evaluation==

===Legality===
The judges at the High Command triala United States military court convened to judge German war crimesruled that the siege of Leningrad was not criminal: &quot;the cutting off every source of sustenance from without is deemed legitimate. ... We might wish the law were otherwise, but we must administer it as we find it&quot;. Even such actions as killing civilians fleeing the siege was ruled to be legal during the trial. The Soviet Union was not successful at banning the use of starvation in the 1949 Geneva Convention; though imposing some limits, it &quot;accepted the legality of starvation as a weapon of war in principle&quot;. Starvation was criminalized later in the twentieth century.

===Genocide===
Some 21st century historians, including Timo Vihavainen and Nikita Lomagin, have classified the siege of Leningrad as genocide due to the systematic starvation and intentional destruction of the city&#x27;s civilian population. On 18 March 2024, the Russian foreign ministry issued a statement via TASS to the German foreign ministry saying that the siege of Leningrad was a genocide.

===Controversial issues===

====Controversy over Finnish participation====
Almost all Finnish historians regard the siege as a German operation and do not consider that the Finns effectively participated in the siege. Russian historian Nikolai Baryshnikov argues that active Finnish participation did occur, but other historians have been mostly silent about it, most likely due to the friendly nature of post-war Soviet–Finnish relations.

The main issues which count in favour of the former view are: (a) the Finns mostly stayed at the pre-Winter War border at the Karelian Isthmus (with small exceptions to straighten the frontline), despite German wishes and requests, and (b) they did not bombard the city from planes or with artillery and did not allow the Germans to bring their own land forces to Finnish lines. Baryshnikov explains that the Finnish military in the region was strategically dependent on the Germans, and lacked the required means and will to press the attack against Leningrad any further.

====Soviet deportation of civilians with ethnic origins in enemy nations – Germans and Finns====
Deportations of Finns and Germans from the Leningrad area to inhospitable areas of the Soviet Union began in March 1942 using the Road of Life; many of their descendants still remain in those areas today. The situation in besieged Leningrad was worse than that in the eastern areas to which most Leningrad residents were evacuated. These inhospitable areas of the Soviet Union hosted millions of evacuees, and many factories, universities, and theatres were also relocated there.

==Commemoration==
===Leningrad Siege and Defence Museum===
Even during the siege itself, war artifacts were collected and shown to the public by city authorities, such as the German aeroplane that was shot down and fell to the ground in Tauricheskiy Garden (). Such objects were displayed as a sign of the people&#x27;s courage, and gathered in a specially allocated building of the former 19th century . The exhibition was soon turned into a full-scale ().

Several years after World War II, from the late 1940s to the early 1950s, Stalin&#x27;s supposed jealousy of Leningrad city leaders caused their destruction in the course of politically motivated show trials forming the post-WWII Leningrad Affair (the pre-war purge followed the 1934 assassination of the popular city ruler Sergey Kirov). Another generation of state and Communist Party functionaries of the city was wiped out, supposedly for publicly overestimating the importance of the city as an independent fighting unit and their own roles in defeating the enemy. Their brainchild, the Leningrad Defence Museum, was also destroyed, as were many valuable exhibits.

With the museum&#x27;s revival during the wave of glasnost of the late 1980s new shocking facts were published, showing heroism of the wartime city along with hardships and even cruelties of the period. The exhibition opened in its originally allocated building, but has not yet regained its original size and area, most of its former premises having been occupied by military and other governmental offices. Plans for a new modern building of the museum have been suspended due to the financial crisis, although under the present Defence Secretary, Sergey Shoigu, promises have been made to expand the museum at its original location.

===Monuments: The Green Belt of Glory and memorial cemeteries===
Commemoration of the siege got a second wind during the 1960s. Local artists dedicated their achievements to the Victory and memory of the war they saw. A leading local poet and war participant Mikhail Dudin suggested erecting a ring of monuments on the places of heaviest siege-time fighting and linking them into a belt of gardens around the city showing where the advancing enemy armies were stopped forever. That was the beginning of the Green Belt of Glory ().

On 29 October 1966, a monument entitled &quot; (of the Siege, ) was erected at the 40th kilometre of the Road of Life, on the shore of Lake Ladoga near the village of Kokkorevo. Designed and created by Konstantin Simun, the monument pays tribute not only to the lives saved via the frozen Ladoga, but also the many lives broken by the siege.
The &quot; () was erected on 9 May 1975 in Victory Square, Saint Petersburg.

The monument is a huge bronze ring with a gap in it, pointing towards the site that the Soviets eventually broke through the encircling German forces. In the centre a Russian mother cradles her dying soldier son. The monument has an inscription saying &quot;900 days 900 nights&quot;. An exhibit underneath the monument contains artifacts from this period, such as journals.

====Memorial cemeteries====
During the siege, numerous deaths of civilians and soldiers led to considerable expansion of burial places later memorialised, of which the best known is Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery.

===Military parade on Palace Square===
Every year, on 27 January, as part of the celebrations of the lifting of the siege, a military parade of the troops of the Western Military District and the Saint Petersburg Garrison on Palace Square takes place. Close to 3,000 soldiers and cadets take part in the parade, which includes historical reenactors in Red Army uniforms, wartime tanks such as the T-34 and color guards carrying wartime flags such as the Banner of Victory and the standards of the different military fronts. Musical support is provided by the Massed Military Bands of the St. Petersburg Garrison under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the Military Band of the Western Military District.

<text>Silambam is an old Indian martial art originating in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. This style is mentioned in Tamil Sangam literature. The World Silambam Association is the official international body of Silambam.

==Origin==
References in the &quot;Silappadikaram&quot; and other works of the Sangam literature show that Silambam has been practiced since at least the 4th century BC. It derives from the Tamil word silam, meaning hill. The term silambambu referred to a particular type of bamboo from the Kurinjimala (kurinji hills) in present-day Kerala. Thus silambam was named after its primary weapon, the bamboo staff. It may have earlier used for self-defense and to ward off animals in the Kurinji hills and later evolved into the present-day martial art. Bamboo staffs – as well as swords, pearls and armor – were in great demand from foreign traders. 

The ancient city of Madurai formed as the point of focus of Silambam spreading. The Silambam staff was acquired by the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans and was spread back to the Middle East, Europe and North Africa. The Tamil Kingdom which encompassed Southern India and Sri Lanka spread it throughout the Southeast Asia.

The Kings Puli Thevar and Dheeran Chinnamalai had armies of Silambam soldiers named &quot;Thadii Pattalam.&quot; Veerapandiya Kattabomman, Chinna Maruthu and Periya Maruthu (1760–1799) relied mainly on their Silambam prowess in warfare against the British East India Company. Indian martial arts and other related martial arts practices suffered a decline after the British banned Silambam and promoted modern military training, which favored firearms over traditional weaponry.

==Training==
The first stages of Silambam practice are meant to provide a foundation for fighting, and also preparatory body conditioning. This includes improving flexibility, agility, and hand-eye coordination, kinesthetic awareness, balance, strength, speed, muscular and cardiovascular stamina.

===Weapons===

Silambam&#x27;s main focus is on the bamboo staff. The length of the staff depends on the height of the practitioner. Ideally, it should just touch the forehead about three fingers from the head, typically measuring around 1.68 meters (five and a half feet). Different lengths may be used depending on the situation. For instance, the &quot;sedikuchi&quot; or 3-foot stick can be easily concealed. Separate practice is needed for staffs of different lengths. Listed below are some of the weapons used in Silambam.

*Silambam: staff, preferably made from bamboo, but sometimes also from teak or Indian rose chestnut wood. The staff is immersed in water and strengthened by beating it on the surface of still or running water. It is often tipped with metal rings to prevent the ends from being damaged.
*Maru: a thrusting weapon made from deer (more accurately, Blackbuck) horns.
*Aruval: sickle, often paired.
*Panthukol: staff with balls of fire, or weighted chains on each end.
*Savuku: whip.
*Vaal: sword, generally curved.
*Kuttu katai: spiked knuckleduster.
*Katti: knife.
*Kattari: native push-dagger with a H-shaped handle. Some are capable of piercing armor. The blade may be straight or wavy.
*Surul kaththi: flexible sword.
*Sedikuchi: cudgel or short stick, often wielded as a pair.

===Kuttu Varisai===
Kuttu Varisai is the unarmed combat component of Silambam and also a stand-alone martial art. It contains animal forms.

==World initiatives==
Silambam made its first historical appearance in the eyes of the world through the auspices of the committee of the United Nations Assembly, which recommended Silambam Asia for United Nations status. The inauguration was held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, United States on 21 January 2019. However, the China-Taipei government representatives raised questions concerning border conflicts in ancient records pertaining to Silambam. A request was lodged for the organization of Silambam Asia to resolve with ratification of the raised problems by member states. On 30 January 2019, substantive work was completed and concluded for Silambam Asia with Special Status in the United Nations.

==In popular culture==

In many M.G.Ramachandran (MGR) films from the 1950s and 1960s, MGR had incorporated silambam fighting scenes to popularize these ancient martial arts in the 20th century. MGR himself was a practitioner of silambam fighting, learning this martial art from Master Madurai Maadakulam Ravi. Some of these movies include &quot;Thaikkupin Tharam&quot;, &quot;Periya Idathu Penn&quot;, &quot;Mugaraasi&quot; and &quot;Thanipiravi&quot;.

<doc id="326952" wikidata="Q345571" url="?curid=326952" title="Belisario Betancur">
<text>Belisario Betancur Cuartas (4 February 1923 – 7 December 2018) was a Colombian politician who served as the 26th President of Colombia from 1982 to 1986. He was a member of the Colombian Conservative Party. His presidency was noted for its attempted peace talks with several Colombian guerrilla groups. He was also one of the few presidents to abstain from participating in politics after leaving office.

== Early life ==
Betancur was born in the Morro de la Paila district of the town of Amagá, Antioquia, in 1923. His parents were Rosendo Betancur, a blue-collar worker, and Ana Otilia Cuartas, a businesswoman. Betancur&#x27;s mother died in 1950. He is of French descent.

Betancur traveled to the city of Medellín, where he enrolled in the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana. In 1955, Betancur graduated in jurisprudence and obtained a degree in law and economics.

== Political career ==
Betancur began his political career as a deputy in the Antioquia Departmental Assembly, where he served from 1945 to 1947. He served as a Representative to the National Chamber for the departments of Cundinamarca and Antioquia, and was a member of the National Constituent Assembly from 1953 to 1957.

Betancur was the Minister of Labor in 1963 and Ambassador to Spain from 1975 to 1977.

He ran for president as an independent Conservative candidate in the election of 1970, coming in third. He again ran as the official Conservative candidate in the election of 1978, but was defeated by Julio César Turbay Ayala.

===Presidency===
Betancur was finally elected President in 1982 and served until 1986. As President, he helped found the Contadora Group to bring about peace in Central America, began democratic reforms by incorporating the principal armed movements into civil life, promoted low-cost housing and open universities, began a literacy campaign and endorsed tax amnesty.

During his term, the government approved the mayoral election law, municipal and departmental reforms, judicial and congressional reforms, the television statute, the national holiday law, and the new Código Contencioso Administrativo. His administration began the exploration and export of coal in the Cerrejón North region and the broadcast of the regional television channels Teleantioquia and Telecaribe.

Betancur was also noted for his attempts to bring peace to his country. During his administration he initiated peace talks with several Colombian guerrilla groups. The controversial Palace of Justice siege occurred in late 1985, less than a year before the end of his presidential term.

He was president during the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz, which killed over 20,000 people.

===Post-presidency===
Betancur retired from politics after he left office in 1986.

Betancur was an Honorary Member of the Club of Rome for Latin America, Chairman of the Truth Commission for El Salvador, and President of the Santillana for Latin America Foundation in Bogotá. He also was a founding member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.

==Personal life==
In 1946, Betancur married Rosa Helena Álvarez Yepes. Together, they had three children including diplomat Diego Betancur Álvarez. Álvarez Yepes died in 1998. In October 2000, Betancur married Dalia Rafaela Navarro Palmar.

==Death==
On 6 December 2018, Betancur was hospitalized in Bogotá in a critical condition, suffering from a kidney infection. Vice President Marta Lucía Ramírez prematurely announced his death on Twitter, but later retracted her statement. Betancur died the following day from the illness, aged 95.

Before his death, Betancur said he did not wish to have a state funeral and expressed interest in being buried at Jardines del Recuerdo Cemetery in Bogotá. On 8 December, his funeral was held with President Iván Duque Márquez and former presidents Juan Manuel Santos and César Gaviria in attendance. He was buried at Jardines del Recuerdo Cemetery later that day following a mass at Gimnasio Moderno in Bogotá.

==Honours==
Betancur was the recipient of honorary doctorates from the University of Colorado and Georgetown University. He received the Prince of Asturias Peace Award of Spain in 1983.

<text>John William Warner III (February 18, 1927 – May 25, 2021) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the United States Secretary of the Navy from 1972 to 1974 and as a five-term Republican U.S. Senator from Virginia from 1979 to 2009, and is both the longest serving Republican Senator from Virginia, and the second longest serving Senator from Virginia behind Democrat Harry F. Byrd. He served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1999 to 2001, and from 2003 to 2007. Warner also served as the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee from 1995 to 1999.

Warner was a veteran of the Second World War and Korean War, and was one of five World War II veterans serving in the Senate at the time of his retirement. He did not seek reelection in 2008. After leaving the Senate, he worked for the law firm of Hogan Lovells, where he had previously been employed before joining the United States Department of Defense as the Under Secretary of the Navy during the presidency of Richard Nixon in 1969.

As of 2025, Warner is the last Republican to represent Virginia in the Senate, as well the only Republican Senator from Virginia to serve more than one term.

==Early life and education==

John William Warner III was born on February 18, 1927, in Washington, D.C., to Martha Budd and Dr. John Warner Jr., an obstetrician-gynecologist in Washington. He grew up in the District, where he attended the elite St. Albans School before graduating from Woodrow Wilson High School in February 1945.

Warner enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II in January 1945, shortly before his 18th birthday. He served until the following year, leaving as a petty officer third class. He went to college at Washington and Lee University, where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi, graduating in 1949; he then entered the University of Virginia Law School.

Warner joined the U.S. Marine Corps in October 1950, after the outbreak of the Korean War, and served in Korea as a ground aircraft maintenance officer with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. His service number was 050488. He continued in the Marine Corps Reserves after the war, eventually reaching the rank of captain. He then resumed his studies, taking courses at the George Washington University before receiving his law degree from UVA in 1953. That year, he became a law clerk to Chief Judge E. Barrett Prettyman of the D.C. Circuit. In 1956, he became an assistant prosecutor in the office of the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia.

In 1960, he entered private law practice and joined Hogan &amp; Hartson (now Hogan Lovells). In the 1960 United States presidential election, he served as an aide to Vice President Richard Nixon&#x27;s campaign team.

==Secretary of the Navy==
After giving substantial funds and time to Nixon&#x27;s successful presidential campaign in 1968, Warner was appointed Under Secretary of the Navy in the Nixon Administration in February 1969. On May 4, 1972, he succeeded John H. Chafee as Secretary of the Navy. Thereafter Warner was appointed by President Gerald Ford as delegate to the Law of the Sea talks, and he negotiated the U.S.-Soviet Incidents at Sea agreement which became a cause célèbre of pro-Détente doves in U.S.-Soviet relations. He was subsequently appointed by Gerald Ford to the post of Director of the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration.

==U.S. Senator==

Following Ford&#x27;s defeat, Warner began to consider political office for himself. He entered politics in the 1978 Virginia election for U.S. Senate. Despite the publicity of being Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s husband and the large amounts of money Warner used in his campaign for the nomination, he finished second at the state Republican Party (GOP) convention to the far more conservative politician Richard D. Obenshain. Much of this loss was due to his perceived liberal political stances, especially his soft approach to U.S.-Soviet relations. In contrast, Obenshain was a noted anti-Soviet, a hardline anti-communist, and an opponent of other liberal policies including the Great Society and much of the Civil Rights Movement. However, when Obenshain died two months later in a plane crash, Warner was chosen to replace him and narrowly won the general election over Democrat Andrew P. Miller, a former Attorney General of Virginia. He was in the Senate until January 3, 2009. Despite his less conservative policy stances, Warner managed to be the second longest-serving senator in Virginia&#x27;s history, behind only Harry F. Byrd Sr. and by far the longest-serving Republican Senator from the state. On August 31, 2007, Warner announced that he would not seek re-election in 2008.

His committee memberships included the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. As the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he protected and increased the flow of billions of dollars into the Virginia economy each year via the state&#x27;s military installations and shipbuilding firms which served his reelection efforts in every cycle.
Warner was quite moderate, especially in comparison to most Republican Senators from the South. He was among the minority of Republicans to support some gun control laws. He voted for the Brady Bill and, in 1999, was one of only five Republicans to vote to close the so-called gun show loophole. While Warner voted against the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, he co-sponsored efforts by Sen. Dianne Feinstein to reauthorize the ban in 2004 and 2005.

Warner supported the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision establishing abortion rights and supported embryonic stem cell research, although he received high ratings from anti-abortion groups because he voted in favor of many abortion restrictions. On June 15, 2004, Warner was among the minority of his party to vote to expand hate crime laws to include sexual orientation as a protected category. He supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, but he raised concerns about the most recent Federal Marriage Amendment as being too restrictive, as it would have potentially banned civil unions as well.

In 1987, Warner was one of the six Republicans who voted to reject the nomination of Robert Bork by President Ronald Reagan and the only Southern Republican to do so. Warner was re-elected easily in 1984 and 1990, and faced his first real challenge for re-election in 1996 from political newcomer Democrat Mark Warner (no relation), a millionaire who vastly outspent the incumbent and produced an unusually close election. John Warner prevailed with 52% of the vote.

According to George Stephanopoulos, a former close aide to President Bill Clinton, Warner was among top choices to replace Les Aspin as the Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration; Clinton ultimately selected William Perry.

In the 1996 United States Presidential election, Warner served as a Senate teller (along with Democrat Wendell H. Ford) of electoral votes. Warner was among ten GOP Senators who voted against the charge of perjury during Clinton&#x27;s impeachment (the others were Richard Shelby of Alabama, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Olympia Snowe of Maine, John Chafee of Rhode Island, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Jim Jeffords of Vermont, Slade Gorton of Washington, and Fred Thompson of Tennessee). Warner and others who voted against the article angered many Republicans by their position. However, unlike Snowe, Collins, Specter, Jeffords, and Chafee, the rest of the Republicans voted guilty on the second article.

As was the case in 1990, Warner faced no Democratic opposition in 2002, winning re-election to a fifth term in the Senate by a landslide over Independent candidate Jacob Hornberger.
On May 23, 2005, Warner was one of 14 centrist senators, dubbed the &quot;Gang of 14,&quot; to forge a compromise on the Democrats&#x27; proposed use of the judicial filibuster, thus blocking the Republican leadership&#x27;s attempt to implement the so-called nuclear option. Under the agreement, the Democrats would retain the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an &quot;extraordinary circumstance&quot;, and three Bush appellate court nominees, Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen, and William H. Pryor, Jr., would receive a vote by the full Senate.

On September 17, 2006, Warner said that U.S. military and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the U.S. in the name of fighting terrorism. He feared that the administration&#x27;s civilian lawyers and a president who never saw combat were putting U.S. service personnel at risk of torture, summary executions and other atrocities by chipping away at Geneva Conventions’ standards that have protected them since 1949. Following the Supreme Court ruling on &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot;, which was adverse to the Bush Administration, Warner (with Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain) negotiated with the White House the language of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, suspending habeas corpus provisions for anyone deemed by the Executive Branch an &quot;unlawful combatant&quot; and barring them from challenging their detentions in court. Warner&#x27;s vote gave a retroactive, nine-year immunity to U.S. officials who authorized, ordered, or committed acts of torture and abuse, permitting the use of statements obtained through torture to be used in military tribunals so long as the abuse took place by December 30, 2005.
Warner&#x27;s &quot;compromise&quot; (approved by a Republican majority) authorized the President to establish permissible interrogation methods and to &quot;interpret the meaning and application&quot; of international Geneva Convention standards, so long as the coercion falls short of &quot;serious&quot; bodily or psychological injury. Warner maintained that the new law holds true to &quot;core principles&quot; that the U.S. provide fair trials and not be seen as undermining Geneva Conventions. The bill was signed into law on October 17, 2006, in Warner&#x27;s presence.

In March 2007, after Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Peter Pace spoke publicly about his views on homosexuality and the military, Warner said, &quot;I respectfully, but strongly, disagree with the chairman&#x27;s view that homosexuality is immoral.&quot;

On August 23, 2007, he called on President Bush to begin bringing U.S. troops home from Iraq by Christmas in order to make it clear to the Iraqi leadership that the U.S. commitment is not indefinite.

On August 31, 2007, he announced that he would not seek a sixth term in the Senate in 2008.

Warner was a cosponsor of America&#x27;s Climate Security Act of 2007, also more commonly referred to as the Cap and Trade Bill, that proposed to ration (cap) carbon emissions in the U.S., and tax or purchase (trade) Carbon credits on the global market for greater U.S. alignment with the Kyoto protocol standards and goals.

In September 2008, Warner joined the Gang of 20, a bipartisan coalition seeking comprehensive energy reform. The group pushed for a bill that would encourage state-by-state decisions on offshore drilling and authorize billions of dollars for conservation and alternative energy.

In October 2008, Warner voted in favor of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

==Post-Senate life==
Warner was listed as a senior advisor at the website for the D.C. law firm, Hogan Lovells. He was in the firm&#x27;s Global Regulatory practice group, and his specialties were Aerospace, Defense, and Government Services. In 2014, Warner endorsed Mark Warner&#x27;s Senate reelection bid. On September 28, 2016, Warner endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, praising Clinton&#x27;s record of bipartisan cooperation. In 2018, he endorsed Democrats Tim Kaine for Senate and Abigail Spanberger and Leslie Cockburn for Congress. He did endorse Republican candidates Ed Gillespie for Governor in 2017 and Barbara Comstock for Virginia&#x27;s 10th congressional district in 2018. In 2020, Warner endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for President of the United States and Mark Warner for his reelection bid to the Senate.

In 2020, Warner, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot;

Warner also served as an Honorary Director on the Board of Directors at the Atlantic Council.

===Honors===
On December 12, 2008, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence awarded Warner the first ever National Intelligence Distinguished Public Service Medal. In 2008, Warner delivered the Waldo Family Lecture on International Relations at Old Dominion University.

On January 8, 2009, the Secretary of the Navy announced the Navy would name the next after John Warner. is the twelfth &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarine and was commissioned on August 1, 2015, at a ceremony at Naval Station Norfolk.

On February 19, 2009, the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., announced that Queen Elizabeth II would name John Warner an honorary Knight Commander for his work strengthening the American-British military alliance. As a person who is not a British citizen (or a citizen of a country which acknowledges the British monarch as their own monarch), the title of Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire only allowed Warner to put the Post-nominal letters KBE after his name.

The annual Senator John W. Warner Award is given to a third year undergraduate student at the University of Virginia who exhibits a serious, convincing ambition to seek future election to public office. This award honors an individual who strives for service in an elected office, whether it is a part-time city council position or a full-time legislative or executive office. Successful candidates demonstrate the required courage to stand up and ask fellow citizens for their valued vote. The award of up to $3,000 funds a research project in an area that will inform the recipient&#x27;s future career as an elected official. Award recipients include: John Jacob Nay, Casey Enders, James Linville, and Sarah Buckley.

On May 2, 2013, Warner and United States Marine Corps representatives broke ground for the Senator John W. Warner Center for Advanced Military Studies at Marine Corps University in Quantico, Virginia. The Warner Center is home to the Marine Corps Command and Staff College, School of Advanced Warfighting and College of Distance Education and Training, and the Brigadier General Simmons Center for Marine Corps History, including the archives of the Marine Corps and the history division.

==Personal life==
In August 1957, Warner married banking heiress Catherine Conover Mellon, the daughter of art collector Paul Mellon and his first wife, Mary Conover, and the granddaughter of Andrew Mellon. By his marriage, Warner accrued substantial capital for investing and expanding his political contacts. The Warners, who divorced in 1973, had three children: Virginia, John IV, and Mary. His former wife now uses the name Catherine Conover.

Warner was the sixth husband of actress Elizabeth Taylor, whom he married in December 1976, at the Second Presbyterian Church in Richmond, Virginia, before he was elected to the Senate. They divorced in November 1982. Warner was the last surviving, as well as the longest-lived, of Taylor&#x27;s seven husbands.

Warner was linked romantically to broadcast journalist Barbara Walters in the 1990s. In December 2003, he married Jeanne Vander Myde, a real estate agent and the widow of Reagan administration defense department official Paul Vander Myde.

===Death and funeral===
Warner died from heart failure at his home in Alexandria, Virginia, on May 25, 2021, at age 94. Warner&#x27;s funeral was held June 23, 2021, at Washington National Cathedral.

<doc id="326960" wikidata="Q17048042" url="?curid=326960" title="Snare drum technique">
<text>Snare technique is the technique used to play a snare drum.

It is studied as an end to itself by snare drummers, and as a way of developing stick control skill by kit drummers and players of other auxiliary percussion instruments. Snare drum is the first instrument that most percussionists learn to play. 
== Grips ==

There are two categories of grips used in snare technique: matched grip, in which both hands hold the sticks in an overhand grip, and traditional grip, in which one hand uses an overhand grip and the other an underhand grip. Traditional grip is almost exclusively used on snare drum, and concert bass drum, while matched grip is used on all percussion instruments. Traditional grip is also primarily used in drum corps style marching environments, such as Drum Corps International.

== Rudiments ==

Snare drum technique is learned mainly by learning specific sequences of drumstick strokes, each of them known as a drum rudiment and most of them short. Examples of rudiments are the paradiddle and the drum roll. Rudiments are often practiced in the Open, closed, open method where the player increases and decreases the tempo of the pattern in a steady methodical way. Rudiments can be built up into larger phrases, as in the purely rudimental playing of military and marching bands, or used for technical mastery by drum kit players or orchestral percussionists.

== Strokes ==

Snare drumming is accomplished with a series of individual strokes, a more basic level of organization than rudiments, which fall into a small number of major categories, such as Up, Down, Full, or Tap.

== Rolls ==

A distinctive feature of snare drumming is the use of rolls, or sustained sounds made from a series of repetitive notes placed close together. Rolls can be played open, as in single or double stroke rolls, or closed as in the orchestral or concert roll.

== Techniques and styles ==
Many variations of snare drum technique exist based on the context or music being performed. Snare drum can be played with sweeping and stirring motions if played with brushes. It can also be played in a snappy and light manner, as in the Pipe band tradition of Scotland. A much heavier approach is used in American Drum corps playing. Ancient fife and drum corps used a flowing whip-like method now known as the Moeller method after its 20th century champion Sanford A. Moeller, which is also sometimes employed by drum kit players. A contrasting style of playing, using a lot of rebound from the head, is often called the Gladstone method after Billy Gladstone.

<text>Corrado Bafile (4 July 1903 – 3 February 2005) was an Italian cardinal of the Catholic Church who served as Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints from 1975 to 1980, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1976. At the time of his death, he was the oldest member of the College of Cardinals.

==Early life==
The youngest of the twelve children, Bafile was born in L&#x27;Aquila, Abruzzo, to physician Vincenzo Bafile and his wife Maddalena Tedeschini D&#x27;Annibale. His brother was a military hero who died in World War I, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valour. He attended the liceo classico in L&#x27;Aquila before studying chemistry at the University of Munich in Germany. Following his father&#x27;s death, Bafile entered Sapienza University in Rome, from where he obtained a doctorate in law in 1926. Once he passed the examination for a legal procurator, he was registered with the Court of Appeals of L&#x27;Aquila in June 1927.

==Priesthood==
Bafile later decided to pursue Holy Orders in 1932, and then studied philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University for a year before attending the Pontifical Roman Seminary and Pontifical Lateran University, earning a doctorate in canon law. He was ordained to the priesthood on 11 April 1936, and then furthered his studies at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy until 1939.

Bafile was an attaché of the Secretariat of State of the Holy See and did pastoral work in Rome from 1939 to 1960. During this time, he also served as chaplain to the Abruzzi community in Rome and to the Legion of Mary. He was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on 24 June 1954.

== Episcopal career ==
On 13 February 1960, Bafile was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Germany and Titular Archbishop of Antiochia in Pisidia on 13 February 1960 by Pope John XXIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 19 March from John XXIII himself, with Archbishop Diego Venini and Bishop Petrus Canisius Van Lierde, OSA, serving as co-consecrators, at the Sistine Chapel. He attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965, and was later named Pro-Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints on 18 July 1975.

Pope Paul VI created him Cardinal-Deacon of S. Maria in Portico in the consistory of 24 May 1976, which allowed him to assume the title &quot;Prefect&quot;. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the conclaves of August and October 1978, which selected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II, respectively. He retired as prefect on 27 June 1980.

He died from complications with influenza at the Pius XI Clinic in Rome, at age 101. Cardinal Ratzinger presided over his funeral Mass before he was buried at his family&#x27;s tomb in his native L&#x27;Aquila. His remains were later transferred to the church where he was baptized.

<text>The term &quot;British subject&quot; has several different meanings depending on the time period. Before 1949, it referred to almost all subjects of the British Empire (including the United Kingdom, Dominions, and colonies, but excluding protectorates and protected states). Between 1949 and 1983, the term was synonymous with Commonwealth citizen. Currently, it refers to people possessing a class of British nationality largely granted under limited circumstances to those connected with Ireland or British India born before 1949. Individuals with this nationality are British nationals and Commonwealth citizens, but not British citizens.

The status under the current definition does not automatically grant the holder right of abode in the United Kingdom but almost all British subjects do have this entitlement. As of 2025, about 20,400 British subjects hold valid British passports with this status and enjoy consular protection when travelling abroad; about 800 do not have right of abode in the UK.

Nationals of this class without right of abode are subject to immigration controls when entering the UK. If they hold no other citizenship, British subjects without right of abode in the UK are effectively stateless, as they are not guaranteed the right to enter the country in which they are nationals.

== Background ==

=== Development from feudal allegiance ===
Before the concept of nationality was codified in legislation, inhabitants of English communities owed allegiance to their feudal lords, who were themselves vassals of the monarch. This system of loyalty, indirectly owed to the monarch personally, developed into a general establishment of subjecthood to the Crown. &quot;Calvin&#x27;s Case&quot; in 1608 established the principle of &quot;jus soli&quot;, that all those who were born within Crown dominions were natural-born subjects. After the Acts of Union 1707, English and Scottish subjects became British subjects. Natural-born subjects were considered to owe perpetual allegiance to the Crown, and could not voluntarily renounce British subject status until 1870, when it was first permitted.

Prior to 1708, foreigners could only be naturalised through Acts of Parliament. Although procedures were created after this point for aliens to become subjects, personalised naturalising legislation continued to be enacted until 1975. Additionally, the monarch could personally make any individual a subject by royal prerogative. By this method, a foreigner became a denizen – although they were no longer considered an alien, they could not pass subject status to their children by descent and were barred from Crown service and public office. This mechanism was no longer used after 1873.

Until the mid-19th century, it was unclear whether nationality regulations in Great Britain (the United Kingdom from 1801) were applicable elsewhere in the Empire. Individual colonies had each developed their own procedures and requirements for naturalisation, granting subject status at the discretion of those local governments. In 1847, Parliament formalised a clear distinction between subjects who were naturalised in the UK and those who became British subjects in other territories. Individuals naturalised in the UK were deemed to have received the status by &quot;imperial naturalisation&quot;, which was valid throughout the Empire. Those naturalised in a colony were said to have gone through &quot;local naturalisation&quot; and were given subject status valid only within the relevant territory. However, when travelling outside of the Empire, British subjects who were locally naturalised in a colony were still entitled to imperial protection.

British subject status was codified in statute law for the first time by the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914, which formalised the status as a common nationality among the United Kingdom, its colonies, and the self-governing Dominions. Dominions that adopted this Act as part of their own nationality laws (Australia, Canada, Ireland, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa) were authorised to grant subject status to aliens by &quot;imperial naturalisation&quot;.

During this time, British subject status was the principal form of British nationality. There were certain territories that came under British jurisdiction but were not formally incorporated as Crown territory proper. These included protectorates, protected states, League of Nations mandates, and United Nations trust territories. Because they were foreign lands, birth in one of these areas did not automatically confer British subject status. Instead, most people associated with these territories were designated as British protected persons.

=== Transition to Commonwealth citizenship ===
Following the First World War, the Dominions developed distinct national identities. Britain formally recognised this at the 1926 Imperial Conference, jointly issuing the Balfour Declaration with all the Dominion heads of government, which stated that the United Kingdom and Dominions were autonomous and equal to each other within the British Commonwealth of Nations. Legislative independence of the Dominions was given legal effect after passage and ratification of the Statute of Westminster 1931. Diverging developments in Dominion nationality laws, as well as growing assertions of local national identity separate from that of Britain and the Empire, culminated with the creation of Canadian citizenship in 1946. Combined with the approaching independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, nationality law reform was necessary at this point to address ideas that were incompatible with the previous system.

The British Nationality Act 1948 redefined &quot;British subject&quot; as any citizen of the United Kingdom, its colonies, or other Commonwealth countries. &quot;Commonwealth citizen&quot; was first defined in this Act to have the same meaning. This alternative term was necessary to retain a number of newly independent countries in the Commonwealth that wished to become republics rather than preserve the monarch as head of state. The change in naming also indicated a shift in the base theory to this aspect of British nationality; allegiance to the Crown was no longer a requirement to possess British subject status and the common status would be maintained by voluntary agreement among the various members of the Commonwealth.

British subject/Commonwealth citizen status co-existed with the citizenships of each Commonwealth country. A person born in Australia would be both an Australian citizen and a British subject. British subjects under the previous meaning who held that status on 1 January 1949 because of a connection with the United Kingdom or a remaining colony became &quot;Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC)&quot;. CUKC status was the principal form of British nationality during this period of time.

There was also a category of people called &quot;British subjects without citizenship (BSWC)&quot;. Irish citizens who fulfilled certain requirements could file formal claims with the Home Secretary to remain British subjects under this definition. Additionally, those who did not qualify for CUKC status or citizenship in other Commonwealth countries, or were connected with a country that had not yet defined citizenship laws, would transitionally remain British subjects in this group.

All British subjects initially held an automatic right to settle in the United Kingdom, though non-white immigration into the United Kingdom was systemically discouraged. This entitlement was part of a wider initiative to preserve close relationships with certain Dominions and colonies (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and Southern Rhodesia) and to moderate nationalist attitudes within the Commonwealth. It was thought that only a limited number of non-white colonial migrants would ever seek to settle in the UK. However, strong economic conditions in Britain after the Second World War attracted an unprecedented wave of colonial migration. In response to growing anti-immigration sentiment, Parliament imposed immigration controls on subjects originating from outside the British Islands with the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962. The Immigration Act 1971 relaxed controls on patrials, subjects whose parents or grandparents were born in the United Kingdom, and gave effective preferential treatment to Commonwealth citizens from white-majority countries.

Outside of the United Kingdom, British subjects already did not have an automatic right to settle. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa had immigration restrictions in place for British subjects from outside their jurisdictions targeted at non-white migrants since the late 19th century. After 1949, non-local British subjects under the new definition who were resident in these independent Commonwealth countries continued to retain certain privileges. This included eligibility to vote in elections, for preferred paths to citizenship, and for welfare benefits. British subjects were eligible to vote in New Zealand until 1975 and Australia until 1984 (though subjects on the electoral roll in that year are still eligible). In Canada, voting eligibility was revoked at the federal level in 1975, but not fully phased out in provinces until 2006.

Because each country now defined &quot;British subject&quot; in separate pieces of legislation and these definitions were not always updated or kept at parity, individuals could have been British subjects in one country at a given time but not another. For example, a South African citizen in 1967 would have been considered a British subject in Canada, but not the United Kingdom or South Africa. The country was included in the list of Commonwealth nations in Canadian law, despite South Africa having left the Commonwealth in 1961 and not rejoining it until 1994.

=== Redefinition as residual nationality class ===
By the 1980s, most colonies of the British Empire had become independent. Parliament updated nationality law to reflect the more modest geographical boundaries of the United Kingdom. The British Nationality Act 1981 recategorised CUKCs into different nationality groups based on patriality and birthplace. CUKCs with the right of abode in the United Kingdom or those closely connected with the UK, Channel Islands, or Isle of Man became British citizens while those connected with a remaining colony became British Dependent Territories citizens (later renamed British Overseas Territories citizens). Those who could not be reclassified into either of these statuses and who were no longer associated with a British territory became British Overseas citizens.

While all nationals under those categories continue to be Commonwealth citizens, the definition of &quot;British subject&quot; was limited to its present meaning. It currently only includes the category of people previously called &quot;British subjects without citizenship&quot; as well as women who married such persons and registered for the status. The term is no longer synonymous with &quot;Commonwealth citizen&quot;. British citizens are not British subjects as defined by the 1981 Act.

In other Commonwealth countries that still retained it, British subject status under the previous definition was progressively abolished. The status remained in law in South Africa until 1961, Canada until 1977, New Zealand until 1977, and Australia until 1987.

Though the British government has never conceded to suggestions that its policies and legislation concerning nationality were discriminatory or racist, Parliament has since revised nationality law to correct remaining cases of statelessness caused by deprivation of the right to settle in the UK after 1962. The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 granted British subjects who do not hold and have not lost an alternative nationality the right to register as British citizens.

== Acquisition and loss ==
Naturalisation as a British subject is not possible. It is expected that British subjects will obtain citizenship in the country they reside in and that the number of active status holders will eventually dwindle until there are none. It is currently only possible to transfer British subject status by descent if an individual born to a British subject parent would otherwise be stateless. The status was granted in 1949 to British subjects who did not become CUKCs or citizens of any other Commonwealth country or the Republic of Ireland. Irish citizens born before 1949 may make formal claims at any time to retain status as British subjects based on: Crown service in the UK, passports or certificates of entitlement describing holders as British subjects, or proof of other associations with the UK or any former British territory. Women married to British subjects were also able to register for the status before 1983. Virtually all other individuals with this status hold it by virtue of their own, or their father&#x27;s, birth in former British India.

British subjects automatically lose the status if they acquire any other nationality, including other British nationality classes, unless they possess the status through a connection with Ireland. It can also be voluntarily relinquished by a declaration made to the Home Secretary, provided that an individual already possesses or intends to acquire another nationality. British subjects may be stripped of the status if it was fraudulently acquired. There is no path to restore British subject status once lost.

== Rights and privileges ==
British subjects who do not have right of abode in the United Kingdom are exempted from obtaining a visa or entry certificate when visiting the UK for less than six months. When travelling in other countries, they may seek British consular protection. British subjects are not considered foreign nationals when residing in the UK and are entitled to certain rights as Commonwealth citizens. These include exemption from registration with local police, voting eligibility in UK elections, and the ability to enlist in the British Armed Forces. British subjects are also eligible to serve in all Civil Service posts, be granted British honours, receive peerages, and sit in the House of Lords. If given indefinite leave to remain (ILR), they are eligible to stand for election to the House of Commons and local government. British subjects only have right of abode in the UK if they were born to at least one British subject parent who themself was born in the UK or, if they are female, were married to a person with right of abode before 1983. Almost every person who still retains British subject status has UK right of abode. As of 2025, about 20,400 people hold valid British passports with the status, and about 800 do not have right of abode.

All British subjects may become British citizens by registration, rather than naturalisation, after residing in the United Kingdom for more than five years and possessing either right of abode or ILR for more than one year. Registration in this way confers citizenship &quot;otherwise than by descent&quot;, meaning that children born outside of the UK to those successfully registered will be British citizens &quot;by descent&quot;. British subjects with right of abode may also register for citizenship without residence requirements by virtue of their birth to a parent born in the UK. Applicants who successfully register in this way become British citizens &quot;by descent&quot; and cannot pass citizenship to their children born outside of the UK. Individuals who become British citizens would automatically lose British subject status if they are not connected with Ireland. Otherwise, British subjects may also be British citizens simultaneously. British subjects who do not hold and have not lost any other nationality on or after 4 July 2002 are entitled to register as British citizens.

In Australia, &quot;British subjects&quot; who were enrolled to vote before 26 January 1984 retain that right in elections and referendums despite the introduction of Australian citizenship requirements since then. Additionally, voting remains compulsory even if their enrollment had lapsed. there were over 100,000 enrolled to vote with the status of “British subject”.

== Restrictions ==
In a case before Court of Justice of the European Union, it was argued by one of the parties that British subjects who hold no other nationality are &quot;de facto&quot; stateless because they do not have a right to enter the country that claims them as nationals. The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 allowed these individuals to register as British citizens, after which statelessness was generally resolved for people who were solely British subjects.

=== United Kingdom ===
British subjects without right of abode are subject to immigration controls when entering the United Kingdom. They are required to pay an immigration health surcharge to access National Health Service benefits when residing in the UK for longer than six months and do not qualify for most welfare programmes.

=== European Union ===
Before the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020, full British citizens and British subjects with right of abode in the UK were European Union citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU2019/592&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; British subjects without right of abode in the UK were not EU citizens and did not enjoy freedom of movement in other EU countries. They were, and continue to be, exempted from obtaining visas when visiting the Schengen Area.

<text>SPAM Jam (formerly known as Cedar River days) is a yearly festival of the popular meat product Spam. It was held in Austin, Minnesota, where Hormel Foods produces the meat.

The festival spanned from July 1 to 7 and includes fireworks, parades, games, a carnival, and of course, the mysterious meat itself. Each year, those who entered the city during the festivities were likely to see copious amounts of blue and yellow (the colors of the packaging), and myriad dancing men and women in large SPAM can costumes.

The 2005 event hosted such guests as Bill Nye the Science Guy, Kurtwood Smith, Jerry Turner the auditor and Jim Belushi. Highlighting the 2007 event is the second annual SPAM Fritters eating competition, with 2006 Champion David &quot;Processed Meat Paws&quot; Stauber returning to defend his title mark of 856 fritters ().

== Hawaii==

Spam Jam is currently celebrated annually in Honolulu, Hawaii during the last week of April where it is quickly becoming one of the state&#x27;s most popular festivals because of its great food and entertainment in a family-friendly atmosphere. Local residents and visitors alike have made this an annual tradition. In 2009, an estimated 20,000 people attended the event.

Kalakaua Avenue, the main street in Waikiki, is closed to car traffic during the event, and various entertainment stages are set up on the street. Between the stages, several of Honolulu&#x27;s finest restaurants will be serving up Spam in many different ways. Several merchandise tents sell Spam-themed items including T-shirts, shorts, sport balls, and slippers. A variety of Hawaiian craft booths will also be set up on the street.

Introduced in 1937 by Hormel Foods, more Spam is consumed per person in Hawaii than in any other state in the United States. Almost seven million cans of Spam are eaten every year in Hawaii.

<doc id="326970" wikidata="Q50186" url="?curid=326970" title="François Couperin">
<text>François Couperin (; 10 November 1668 – 11 September 1733) was a French Baroque composer, organist and harpsichordist. He was known as &quot;Couperin le Grand&quot; (&quot;Couperin the Great&quot;) to distinguish him from other members of the musically talented Couperin family.

==Life==

Couperin was born in Paris, into a prominent musical family. His father Charles was organist at the Church of Saint-Gervais in the city, a position previously held by Charles&#x27;s brother Louis Couperin, the esteemed keyboard virtuoso and composer whose career was cut short by an early death. As a boy François must have received his first music lessons from his father, but Charles died in 1679 leaving the position at Saint-Gervais to his son, a common practice known as &quot;survivance&quot; that few churches ignored. With their hands tied, the churchwardens at Saint-Gervais hired Michel Richard Delalande to serve as new organist on the understanding that François would replace him at age 18. However, it is likely Couperin began these duties much earlier: a stipend of 100 &quot;livres&quot; per year, which had been provided the Couperin on Charles&#x27;s death slowly increased to 400 &quot;livres&quot;, suggesting that Couperin had gradually begun to take on the mantle as his studies progressed.

The 11-year-old was taken care of and taught, meanwhile, by organist Jacques-Denis Thomelin, who served both at court and at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie. Biographer Évrard Titon du Tillet wrote that Thomelin treated the boy extremely well, becoming a second father to him. François&#x27; talent must have shown itself early on because by 1685 the church council began providing him a salary, although he had no contract.

At twenty-one Couperin also lost his mother, Marie (née Guérin), but otherwise his life and career were accompanied by good fortune. In 1689 he married Marie-Anne Ansault, daughter of a prosperous family. The next year saw the publication of his &quot;Pièces d&#x27;orgue&quot;, a collection of organ masses praised by Delalande, who may have assisted with the project. In three more years Couperin succeeded Thomelin at Louis XIV&#x27;s court. The appointment brought him in touch with some of the finest composers of the day as well as the aristocracy. His earliest chamber music dates from this time. Couperin met his court duties in tandem with those he now had as organist at Saint-Gervais, while also composing.

=== Royal assent to publish ===
He applied for a blanket &quot;privilège du Roy&quot; in 1713 to allow him to publish &#x27;plusiers pieces de musique de sa composition, tant pour la vocale que l&#x27;instrumental, conjointement ou séparément&#x27; and used it immediately to issue the first volume (out of four) of his harpsichord works, &quot;Pieces de clavecin&quot;. A harpsichord playing manual &quot;l&#x27;Art de toucher le clavecin&quot; followed in 1716 (though this was immediately recalled and republished the following year), as well as other collections of keyboard and chamber music. In 1717 Couperin became &quot;ordinaire de la musique de la chambre du roi pour le clavecin––&quot;one of the highest possible appointments for a court musician, and a position once held by Jean-Henri d&#x27;Anglebert. However, his involvement in the musical activities at the court may have lessened after Louis XIV&#x27;s death in 1715.

Couperin&#x27;s health declined steadily throughout the 1720s. The services of a cousin were required by 1723 at Saint Gervais, and in 1730 Couperin&#x27;s position as court harpsichordist was taken up by his daughter Marguerite-Antoinette. Couperin&#x27;s final publications were &quot;Pièces de violes&quot; (1728) and the fourth volume of harpsichord pieces (1730). The composer died in 1733. The building where Couperin and his family lived since 1724 still stands and is located at the corner of the rue Radziwill and the rue des Petits Champs. The composer was survived by at least three of his children: Marguerite-Antoinette, who continued working as court harpsichordist until 1741, Marie-Madeleine (Marie-Cécile), who became a nun and may have worked as organist at the Maubuisson Abbey, and François-Laurent, who according to contemporary sources left the family after François died.
==Works==
Couperin acknowledged his debt to the Italian composer Corelli. He introduced Corelli&#x27;s trio sonata form to France. Couperin wrote two grand trio sonatas. The first, &quot;Le Parnasse, ou L&#x27;Apothéose de Corelli&quot; (&quot;Parnassus, or the Apotheosis of Corelli&quot;), was written to show his great debt to Corelli and published in 1724. The other, &quot;L&#x27;Apothéose de Lully&quot;, was published a year later and composed in honor of Jean-Baptiste Lully. It used both French and Italian styles of Baroque music, to reconcile the very different styles in what Couperin called a &quot;réunion des goûts&quot; (a reunion of tastes). The same year as &quot;L&#x27;Apothéose de Corelli&quot; was published, Couperin published a set of ten pieces, &quot;Nouveaux concerts, ou Les goûts réunis&quot;, that also combined these two different styles of Baroque music.

His most famous book, &quot;L&#x27;art de toucher le clavecin&quot; (&quot;The Art of Harpsichord Playing&quot;, published in 1716), contains suggestions for fingerings, touch, ornamentation and other features of keyboard technique, as well as eight preludes in the keys of the pieces in his first two books of harpsichord music and an Allemande to illustrate the Italianate style.

Couperin&#x27;s four volumes of harpsichord music, published in Paris in 1713, 1717, 1722, and 1730, contain over 230 individual pieces, and he also published a book of &quot;Concerts Royaux&quot; which can be played as solo harpsichord pieces or as small chamber works. The four collections for harpsichord alone are grouped into &quot;ordres&quot;, a synonym of suites, containing traditional dances as well as pieces with descriptive titles. They are notable for Couperin&#x27;s detailed indication of ornaments, which in most harpsichord music of the period was left to the discretion of the player. The first and last pieces in an &quot;ordre&quot; were of the same tonality, but the middle pieces could be in other closely related tonalities. These volumes were admired by Johann Sebastian Bach, who exchanged letters with Couperin, and later by Brahms and by Ravel, the latter of whom memorialized the composer in &quot;Le Tombeau de Couperin&quot; (&quot;Couperin&#x27;s Memorial&quot;).

Many of Couperin&#x27;s keyboard pieces have evocative, picturesque titles (such as &quot;&quot;The little windmills&quot; and &quot;The mysterious barricades&quot;&quot;) and express a mood through key choices, adventurous harmonies and (resolved) discords. They have been likened to miniature tone poems. These features attracted Richard Strauss, who orchestrated some of them.

Johannes Brahms&#x27;s piano music was influenced by the keyboard music of Couperin. Brahms performed Couperin&#x27;s music in public and contributed to an edition of Couperin&#x27;s &quot;Pièces de clavecin&quot; by Friedrich Chrysander in the 1880s.

Modern English composer Thomas Adès took three pieces from different sets of Couperin suites and orchestrated them in his work &quot;Three Studies from Couperin&quot;.

The early-music expert Jordi Savall has written that Couperin was the &quot;poet musician par excellence&quot;, who believed in &quot;the ability of Music [with a capital M] to express itself in prose and poetry&quot;, and that &quot;if we enter into the poetry of music we discover that it carries grace that is more beautiful than beauty itself&quot;.

===Organ===
Only one collection of organ music by Couperin survives, the &quot;Pièces d&#x27;orgue consistantes en deux messes&quot; (&quot;Pieces for Organ Consisting of Two Masses&quot;), which were published in November 1690. At the age of 21, Couperin probably had neither the funds nor the reputation to obtain widespread publication and the masses were released as manuscripts, with a printed title page and approbation by his teacher, Michel Richard Delalande, who wrote that the music was &quot;very beautiful and worthy of being given to the public.&quot; The two masses were intended for different audiences: the first for parishes or secular churches (&quot;paroisses pour les fêtes solemnelles&quot;), and the second for convents or abbey churches (&quot;couvents de religieux et religieuses&quot;). These masses are divided into many movements in accordance with the traditional structure of the Latin Mass: Kyrie (5 movements), Gloria (9), Sanctus (3), Agnus (2), and an additional &quot;Offertoire&quot; and &quot;Deo gratias&quot; to conclude each mass.

Couperin followed techniques used in masses by Nivers, Lebègue, and Boyvin, as well as other predecessors of the French Baroque era. In the &quot;paroisses&quot; Mass, he uses plainchant from the &quot;Missa cunctipotens genitor Deus&quot; as a cantus firmus in two Kyrie movements and in the first Sanctus movement; the Kyrie &quot;Fugue&quot; subject is also derived from a chant incipit. The Mass for &quot;couvents&quot; contains no plainchant, as each convent and monastery maintained its own, non-standard body of chant. Couperin departs from his predecessors in many ways. For example, the melodies of the &quot;Récits&quot; are strictly rhythmic and more directional than previous examples of the genre. Willi Apel wrote, &quot;this music shows a sense of natural order, a vitality, and an immediacy of feeling that breaks into French organ music like a fresh wind.&quot;

The longest piece in the collection is the &quot;Offertoire sur les grands jeux&quot; of the first Mass, which is akin to an expanded French overture in three large sections: a prelude, a chromatic fugue in minor, and a gigue-like fugue. Bruce Gustafson has called the movement a &quot;stunning masterpiece of the French classic repertory.&quot; The second Mass also contains an &quot;Offertoire&quot; with a similar form, but this Mass is not considered as masterly as the first: Apel wrote, &quot;In general, [Couperin] did not expend the same care for this Mass, which was written for modest abbey churches, as for the other one, which he himself certainly presented on important holidays on the organ of Saint-Gervais.&quot;

<doc id="326971" wikidata="Q420266" url="?curid=326971" title="Fluid ounce">
<text>A fluid ounce (abbreviated fl oz, fl. oz. or oz. fl., old forms ℥, fl ℥, f℥, ƒ ℥) is a unit of volume (also called &quot;capacity&quot;) typically used for measuring liquids. The British Imperial, the United States customary, and the United States food labeling fluid ounce are the three that are still in common use, although various definitions have been used throughout history.

An imperial fluid ounce is of an imperial pint, of an imperial gallon, or exactly 28.4130625 mL.

A US customary fluid ounce is of a US liquid pint, of a US gallon, or exactly 29.5735295625 mL, making it about 4.084% larger than the imperial fluid ounce.

A US food labeling fluid ounce is exactly 30 mL.

== Comparison to the ounce ==
The &quot;fluid&quot; ounce is distinct from the (international avoirdupois) ounce as a unit of weight or mass, although it is sometimes referred to simply as an &quot;ounce&quot; where context makes the meaning clear (e.g., &quot;ounces in a bottle&quot;). A volume of pure water measuring one imperial fluid ounce has a mass of almost exactly one ounce.

==Definitions and equivalences==
;Imperial fluid ounce

;US customary fluid ounce

;US food labeling fluid ounce
For serving sizes on nutrition labels in the US, regulation 21 CFR §101.9(b) requires the use of &quot;common household measures&quot;, and 21 CFR §101.9(b)(5)(viii) defines a &quot;common household&quot; fluid ounce as exactly 30 milliliters. This applies to the serving size but not the package size; package sizes use the US customary fluid ounce.

==History==
The fluid ounce was originally the volume occupied by one ounce of some substance, for example wine (in England) or water (in Scotland). The ounce in question also varied depending on the system of fluid measure, such as that used for wine versus ale.

Various ounces were used over the centuries, including the Tower ounce, troy ounce, avoirdupois ounce, and ounces used in international trade, such as Paris troy, a situation further complicated by the medieval practice of &quot;allowances&quot;, whereby a unit of measure was not necessarily equal to the sum of its parts. For example, the had a for the weight of the sack and other packaging materials.

In 1824, the British Parliament defined the imperial gallon as the volume of ten pounds of water at standard temperature. The gallon was divided into four quarts, the quart into two pints, the pint into four gills, and the gill into five ounces; thus, there were 160 imperial fluid ounces to the gallon.

This made the mass of a fluid ounce of water one avoirdupois ounce (), a relationship which remains approximately valid today despite the imperial gallon&#x27;s definition being slightly revised to be (thus making the imperial fluid ounce exactly ).

The US fluid ounce is based on the US gallon, which in turn is based on the wine gallon of 231 cubic inches that was used in the United Kingdom prior to 1824. With the adoption of the international inch, the US fluid ounce became × × = exactly, or about 4.084% larger than the imperial unit.

In the U.K., the use of the fluid ounce as a measurement in trade, public health, and public administration was circumscribed to a few specific uses (the labelling of beer, cider, water, lemonade and fruit juice in returnable containers) in 1995, and abolished entirely in 2000, by &quot;The Units of Measurement Regulations 1994&quot;.

<text>Ragnvald Anderson Nestos (April 12, 1877July 15, 1942) was a Norwegian-American politician who served as the 13th governor of North Dakota from 1921 to 1925.

==Early life==
Ragnvold Anderson Nestos was a native of Voss, Norway. He was the son of Andres R. Nestos and Herborg Saue. One of ten children, he was sixteen and spoke no English when he came to the United States to live with his aunt and uncle at Buxton, North Dakota. He entered the first grade at Buxton and attended school in between working odd jobs and working at lumber camps out of state. Four years later, in 1897, he passed the teachers&#x27; examinations and taught in a country school. He completed his studies at Mayville State University, a teachers&#x27; college, while homesteading in Pierce County. In 1904, he graduated from the University of North Dakota and moved to Minot, where he began practicing law with a partner, attorney C. A. Johnson.

==Political career==
Nestos was a member of the Independent Voters Association, running on the Republican ticket. He was a member of North Dakota State House of Representatives, 1911–12; Ward County State&#x27;s Attorney, 1913–16; and a primary candidate for U.S. Senator from North Dakota, 1916. He gained office when Governor Lynn Frazier was defeated in the first successful attempt to recall a state governor in U.S. history.

Frazier&#x27;s term was plagued with controversy and a grassroots movement was started to press for his recall. The recall election that removed Governor Frazier had also removed two other members of the state&#x27;s Industrial Commission from office. It was a time of bitter political discontent between the NPL (Nonpartisan League, which supported state-owned industry) and the IVA (Independent Voters Association, which opposed state ownership of industries). Nestos worked hard to make the new state-owned businesses (State Mill and Elevator and the Bank of North Dakota) a success. He also campaigned against illiteracy. During his administration, North Dakota came into national compliance for registering births and deaths, and the state had a full-time health officer for the first time. He ran for, and completed, a second term of office.

==Legacy and death==
Nestos never married.

He received national recognition for his work on behalf of the Boy Scouts of America. He was a &quot;Silver Buffalo Award&quot; winner (1942). He was active within the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America.

Nestos died of a stroke on July 15, 1942. He is buried in Rosehill Cemetery in Minot, North Dakota.

<text>Richard Payne Knight (11 February 1751 – 23 April 1824) of Downton Castle in Herefordshire, and of 5 Soho Square, London, England, was a classical scholar, connoisseur, archaeologist and numismatist best known for his theories of picturesque beauty and for his interest in ancient phallic imagery. He served as a Member of Parliament for Leominster (1780–84) and for Ludlow (1784–1806).

==Origins==
He was born at Wormsley Grange in Wormsley, north-west of Hereford in Herefordshire, the eldest son of Rev. Thomas Knight (1697–1764) of Wormsley Grange, Rector of Bewdley, Worcestershire, by his wife Ursula Nash, a daughter of Frederick Nash of Dinham, Shropshire. He was the heir not only of his father but also of his uncle Richard Knight (1693–1765) of Croft Castle. But of even more value, he was the heir of his grandfather, who founded the family&#x27;s fortune, Richard Knight (1659–1745) of Downton Hall, a wealthy Ironmaster of Bringewood Ironworks. His younger brother was the horticulturist Thomas Andrew Knight.

==Career==
He was educated privately at home. Due to ill health, his years of education were few, but his inherited wealth allowed him to supplement it with travel.
For several years from 1767 he made the Grand Tour to Italy and the European continent. He was a collector of ancient bronzes and coins, and an author of numerous books and articles on ancient sculpture, coins and other artefacts. As a member of the Society of Dilettanti, Knight was widely considered to be an arbiter of taste. He expended much careful study on an edition of Homer.

He was a member of parliament from 1780 to 1806, more as a spectator than an active participant in the debates. Beginning in 1814, he occupied the Towneley family trustee seat at the British Museum, to which he bequeathed his collection of bronzes, coins, engraved gems, marbles, and drawings.

==Death and succession==
Knight died unmarried on 23 April 1824, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Wormsley, where survives his chest tomb, now a grade II listed structure. His heir was his brother the botanist Thomas Andrew Knight, whose daughter the horticulturalist Charlotte Knight (c.1801-1843) eventually inherited Downton Castle, which passed to her descendants by her husband Sir William Edward Rouse-Boughton, 2nd and 10th Baronet (1788–1856), MP.

He bequeathed all his coins and medals to the British Museum, on condition that within one year after his decease, the next descendant in the direct male line, then living, of his grandfather, be made an hereditary trustee, &quot;with all the privileges of the other family trustees, to be continued in perpetual succession to his next descendant, in the direct male line, so long as any shall exist; and in case of their failure, to the next in the female line&quot;.

==Will &amp; Knight v. Knight (1840)==
He made his will on 3 June 1814, leaving the property to his brother, Thomas Andrew Knight and in tail male to his male descendants. But if there were none, the property was to pass to the &quot;next descendant in the direct male line of my late grandfather, Richard Knight of Downton&quot;. However, he also stated:
:&quot;I trust to the liberality of my successors to reward any others of my old servants and tenants according to their deserts, and to their justice in continuing the estates in the male succession, according to the will of the founder of the family, my above-named grandfather&quot;.
Were it not for these last words, his will appeared to have created a trust, which would have precluded Charlotte from inheriting, as her father Thomas Knight died intestate and without male progeny, having been pre-deceased by his only son. One of his male Knight cousins (namely John Knight (1765–1850) of Lea Castle, Wolverley, of 52 Portland Place and of Simonsbath House, Exmoor, Somerset) challenged Charlotte&#x27;s right as a female to inherit under the terms of Payne&#x27;s will, which resulted in the famous 1840 lawsuit Knight v Knight. The judge decided that due to these last words in Payne&#x27;s will, it had not been his intention to create a trust and therefore Thomas had inherited from him an absolute title in his property, which thus passed by law to his daughter.

==Books==

Notoriously, Knight&#x27;s first book, &quot;A Discourse on the Worship of Priapus&quot; (1786), sought to recover the importance of ancient phallic cults. Knight&#x27;s apparent preference for ancient sacred eroticism over Judeo-Christian puritanism led to many attacks on him as an infidel and as a scholarly apologist for libertinism. This ensured the persistent distrust of the religious establishment. The central claim of &quot;The Worship of Priapus&quot; was that an international religious impulse to worship &quot;the generative principle&quot; was articulated through genital imagery, and that this imagery has persisted into the modern age. In some ways the book was the first of many later attempts to argue that Pagan ideas had persisted within Christian culture, a view that would eventually crystallise into the neo-Pagan movement over a century later.

Another book of interest to the neo-Pagan movement was Knight&#x27;s &quot;Symbolical Language of Ancient Art and Mythology&quot;.

&quot;An Analytical Inquiry into the Principles of Taste&quot;, 1805, was, however, Knight&#x27;s most influential work in his lifetime. This book sought to explain the experience of &quot;taste&quot; within the mind and to clarify the theorisation of the concept of the picturesque, following from the writings of William Gilpin and Uvedale Price on the subject. Knight&#x27;s views on the aesthetics of the picturesque are also formed in engagement with Edmund Burke&#x27;s emphasis on the importance of sensation, which Knight partly rejects in favour of a modified associationism. The philosophical basis of Knight&#x27;s theories have implications for his account of the relationship between the &quot;beautiful&quot; and the &quot;picturesque&quot;. For Knight, aesthetic concepts cannot be formed directly from optical sensations, because these must be interpreted within the mind before they can be recognised as beautiful. Thus a Classical architecture Roman temple is beautiful because of the proportions of its parts, but these proportions can never be perceived directly by the senses, which will simply encounter a mass of confused impressions. &quot;Beauty&quot; is thus a product of internal mental acts. It is therefore proper to speak of moral, mathematical and other non-sensuous forms of beauty, contrary to Burke, Hogarth and others who claimed such usages were metaphorical. In all cases &quot;the particular object [e.g. proportion] is an abstract idea.&quot;

==Visual arts==
For Knight, &quot;picturesque&quot; means simply &quot;after the manner of painting&quot;, a point that is important to his further discussion of sensation, which in his view is central to the understanding of painting and music, which are &quot;addressed to the organs of sight and hearing&quot;, while poetry and sculpture appeal &quot;entirely to the imagination and passions.&quot; The latter must be understood in terms of associations of ideas, while the former rely on the &quot;irritation&quot; or friction of sensitive parts of the body. Knight&#x27;s view was that artists should seek to reproduce primal visual sensations, not the mental interpretative processes which give rise to abstract ideas.

For Knight, colour is experienced directly as pleasurable sensation. A pure blue is not pleasurable because it reminds us of clear skies, as Price supposed, but because of the experience itself. Interpretation of impressions follows chains of association following from this primal sensory experience. However, the pleasures of sense may be &quot;modified by habit&quot;, so that the pure stimulus of colour may be experienced as pleasurable when &quot;under the influence of mind&quot; which perceives its meaningful use within a painting. Excess of pure colour is painful, like any other sensory excess. Variety and combination of colours is most pleasurable.

Knight makes much of the need to fragment an image into tonal and colouristic &quot;masses&quot;, a view that has been claimed to anticipate the late work of Turner, or even Impressionism. However, it most directly justifies the practices of contemporary painters of picturesque landscapes, such as Girtin, whose stippling effects are comparable to Knight&#x27;s account of pleasing colour combinations. Knight commissioned landscape artist, Thomas Hearne to produce several drawings of the grounds of his home, Downton Castle in Herefordshire.

On sculpture – typically for him, colourless form – generates in the mind the idea of shape which we must conceptualise, as with &quot;proportion&quot;. The literary arts, like sculpture, deal with thoughts and emotions, though in a more complex form. Knight&#x27;s account of these arts therefore falls under the heading of &quot;association of ideas&quot;. Here Knight shows the influence of the contemporary cult of sensibility, arguing that these arts engage our sympathies, and in so doing demonstrate the inadequacy of 2rules and systems&quot; in both morality and aesthetics. These teach &quot;men to work by rule, instead of by feeling and observation.&quot; Rule-based knowledge of wrong cannot prevent wrongdoing, because it is thought not felt. Therefore, &quot;it is impossible that tragedy should exhibit examples of pure and strict morality, without becoming dull and uninteresting.&quot;

Knight&#x27;s discussion of &quot;the passions&quot; engages with both Classical and recent theorisations of sentiments. His discussion of the sublime is directed against Burke&#x27;s emphasis on feelings of terror and powerlessness. Knight defends Longinus&#x27;s original account of sublimity, which he summarises as the &quot;energetic exertion of great and commanding power&quot;. Again he intertwines social and aesthetic reasoning, asserting that the power of a tyrant cannot be sublime if the tyrant inspires fear by mere arbitrary whim, like Nero. However, it may be sublime if his tyranny, like Napoleon&#x27;s, derives from the exercise of immense personal capacities. A Nero may be feared, but would also be despised. A Napoleon may be hated, but will nevertheless inspire awe. In art, the mind experiences the sublime as it experiences the exercise of its own powers, or sympathises with the exercises of the powers of others. Fear itself can never engender the sublime.

Knight&#x27;s emphasis on the roles of sensation and of emotion were constitutive of later Romantic and Victorian aesthetic thinking, as was his vexed struggle with the relation between moral feeling and sensuous pleasure. Though some contemporaries condemned the basis of his thought as an aestheticised libertinism, or devotion to physical sensation, they influenced John Ruskin&#x27;s attempts to theorise the Romantic aesthetic of Turner, and to integrate political and pictorial values.
