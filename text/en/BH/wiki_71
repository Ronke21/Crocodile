<doc id="333981" wikidata="Q912203" url="?curid=333981" title="Nucleomorph">
<text>Nucleomorphs are small, vestigial eukaryotic nuclei found between the inner and outer pairs of membranes in certain plastids. They are thought to be vestiges of red and green algal nuclei that were engulfed by a larger eukaryote. Because the nucleomorph lies between two sets of membranes, nucleomorphs support the endosymbiotic theory and are evidence that the plastids containing them are complex plastids. Having two sets of membranes indicate that the plastid, a prokaryote, was engulfed by a eukaryote, an alga, which was then engulfed by another eukaryote, the host cell, making the plastid an example of secondary endosymbiosis.

==Organisms with known nucleomorphs==
As of 2007, only two monophyletic groups of organisms are known to contain plastids with a vestigial nucleus or nucleomorph: the cryptomonads of the supergroup Cryptista and the chlorarachniophytes of the supergroup Rhizaria, both of which have examples of sequenced nucleomorph genomes. Studies of the genomic organization and of the molecular phylogeny have shown that the nucleomorph of the cryptomonads used to be the nucleus of a red alga, whereas the nucleomorph of the chlorarchniophytes was the nucleus of a green alga. In both groups of organisms the plastids originate from engulfed photoautotrophic eukaryotes.

Of the two known plastids that contain nucleomorphs, both have four membranes, the nucleomorph residing in the periplastidial compartment, evidence of being engulfed by a eukaryote through phagocytosis.

In 2020, genetic work identified the plastid in &quot;Lepidodinium&quot; and two previously undescribed dinoflagellates (&quot;MGD&quot; and &quot;TGD&quot;) as being most closely related to the green alga &quot;Pedinomonas&quot;. The observation of a nucleomorph in &quot;Lepidodinium&quot; is controversial, but MGD and TGD are proven to have DNA-containing nucleomorphs. The transcriptomes of the nucleomorphs have been sequenced. One slight issue in understanding the sequence of evolution is that although the phylogenetic tree built from Lepidodinium-MGD-TGD&#x27;s plastid is monophyletic, the tree built from their host-nucleus DNA is not, implying that they might have acquired very similar algae independently.

== Structure ==
A cryptomonad nucleomorph is typically much smaller than the host nucleus. A relatively large portion of its size is devoted to the nucleolus, which contains its own ribosomes and rRNA. There seems to be nuclear pores observable by imaging, but genetic work has failed to find any protein appropriate for forming the nuclear pore complex.

There is one nucleomorph per plastid. The nucleomorph divides before the accompanying plastid. The dividing nucleomorph lacks a mitotic spindle, and the nucleomorph envelope persists throughout division.

Between the plastid and the cytoplasm of the host there are four membranes: the inner and outer membranes of the chloroplast, the periplastid membrane, and the epiplastid membrane. The epiplastid membrane is encrusted with ribosomes (in cryptomonads) and is in many ways similar to a endoplasmic reticulum, hence the name &quot;chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum&quot; (cER). Plastid-targeted proteins encoded in the host genome must cross all four membranes to reach the plastid. First they use classic secretory signal peptides to cross the epiplastid membrane. Then the symbiont-specific ERAD-like machinery (SELMA) – encoded in the nucleomorph as a repurposed ERAD – pulls the protein from the epiplastid space (or the lumen of the cER) into the periplastid space (the cytoplasm of the symbiote). The standard chloroplast transit peptide then acts to cross the remaining two layers via TIC/TOC complex.

The chlorarachniophytes, on the other hand, has no such thing as a cER, hence the initial import into the epiplastid space must occur by some other mechanism. It&#x27;s only known that their plastid-targeted proteins are prefixed by both a signal peptide and a chloroplast-targeting peptide much like cryptomonads. Based on research done on apicomplexa, which also has 4 membranes but no cER, it&#x27;s possible that the protein is first sent into the ER, then sent to the epiplastid space by the endomembrane sorting system. Some sort of a pore may then move the peptide into the periplastid space, but there seems to be no SELMA-like pore in this group. It&#x27;s only known that the TIC/TOC complex exists for crossing the last two layers.

==Nucleomorph genome==
Nucleomorphs represent some of the smallest genomes ever sequenced. After the red or green alga was engulfed by a cryptomonad or chlorarachniophyte, respectively, its genome was reduced. The nucleomorph genomes of both cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes converged upon a similar size from larger genomes. They retained only three chromosomes and many genes were transferred to the nucleus of the host cell, while others were lost entirely. Chlorarachniophytes contain a nucleomorph genome that is diploid and cryptomonads contain a nucleomorph genome that is tetraploid. The unique combination of host cell and complex plastid results in cells with four genomes: two prokaryotic genomes (mitochondrion and plastid of the red or green algae) and two eukaryotic genomes (nucleus of host cell and nucleomorph).

The model cryptomonad &quot;Guillardia theta&quot; became an important focus for scientists studying nucleomorphs. Its complete nucleomorph sequence was published in 2001, coming in at 551 Kbp. The &quot;G. theta&quot; sequence gave insight as to what genes were retained in nucleomorphs. Most of the genes that moved to the host cell involved protein synthesis, leaving behind a compact genome with mostly single-copy “housekeeping” genes (affecting transcription, translation, protein folding and degradation and splicing) and no mobile elements. The genome contains 513 genes, 465 of which code for protein. Thirty genes are considered “plastid” genes, coding for plastid proteins. It has three chromosomes with eukaryotic telomeres subtended by rRNA.

The genome sequence of another organism, the chlorarachniophyte &quot;Bigelowiella natans&quot; indicates that its nucleomorph is probably the vestigial nucleus of a green alga, whereas the nucleomorph in &quot;G. theta&quot; probably came from a red alga. The &quot;B. natans&quot; genome is smaller than that of &quot;G. theta&quot;, with about 373 Kbp and contains 293 protein-coding genes as compared to the 465 genes in &quot;G. theta&quot;. &quot;B. natans&quot; also only has 17 genes that code for plastid proteins, again fewer than &quot;G. theta&quot;. Comparisons between the two organisms have shown that &quot;B. natans&quot; contains significantly more introns (852) than &quot;G. theta&quot; (17). &quot;B. natans&quot; also had smaller introns, ranging from 18-21 bp, whereas &quot;G. theta&quot;’s introns ranged from 42-52 bp.

Both the genomes of &quot;B. natans&quot; and &quot;G. theta&quot; display evidence of genome reduction besides elimination of genes and tiny size, including elevated composition of adenine (A) and thymine (T), and high substitution rates.

==Persistence of nucleomorphs==
There are no recorded instances of vestigial nuclei in any other secondary plastid-containing organisms, yet they have been retained independently in the cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes. Plastid gene transfer happens frequently in many organisms, and it is unusual that these nucleomorphs have not disappeared entirely. One theory as to why these nucleomorphs have not disappeared as they have in other groups is that introns present in nucleomorphs are not recognized by host spliceosomes because they are too small and therefore cannot be cut and later incorporated into host DNA.

Nucleomorphs also often code for many of their own critical functions, like transcription and translation. Some say that as long as there exists a gene in the nucleomorph that codes for proteins necessary for the plastid’s functioning that are not produced by the host cell, the nucleomorph will persist. The cryptomonad nucleomorph also codes for genes that function in plastid maintenance.

In cryptophytes and chlorarachniophytes all DNA transfer between the nucleomorph and host genome seems to have ceased, but the process is still going on in a few dinoflagellates (MGD and TGD).

== Tertiary endosymbiosis ==

The standard nucleomorph is the result of secondary endosymbiosis: a cyanobacterium first became the chloroplast of ancestral plants, which diverged into green and red algae among other groups; the algal cell is then captured by another eukaryote. The chloroplast is surrounded by 4 membranes: 2 layers resulting from the primary, and 2 resulting from the secondary. When the nucleus of the algal endosymbiont remains, it&#x27;s called a &quot;nucleomorph&quot;.

Most tertiary endosymbiosis events end up with only the plastid retained. However, in the case of dinotoms (i.e. those having diatom endosymbionts), the symbiont&#x27;s nucleus appears to be of normal size with a large amount of DNA, surrounded by plenty of cytoplasm. The symbiont even has its own DNA-containing mitochondria. As a result, the organism has two eukaryotic genomes and three prokaryotic-derived organelle genomes.

<doc id="333987" wikidata="Q188538" url="?curid=333987" title="The Master and Margarita">
<text>The Master and Margarita () is a novel by Mikhail Bulgakov, written in the Soviet Union between 1928 and 1940. A censored version, with several chapters cut by editors, was published in &quot;Moscow&quot; magazine in 1966–1967, after the writer&#x27;s death on March 10, 1940, by his widow Elena Bulgakova (Russian: Елена Булгакова). The manuscript was not published as a book until 1967, in Paris. A &quot;samizdat&quot; version circulated that included parts cut out by official censors, and these were incorporated in a 1969 version published in Frankfurt. The novel has since been published in several languages and editions. 

The story concerns a visit by the devil and his entourage to the officially atheistic Soviet Union. The devil, manifested as one Professor Woland, challenges the Soviet citizens&#x27; beliefs towards religion and condemns their behavior throughout the book. &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; combines supernatural elements with satirical dark comedy and Christian philosophy, defying categorization within a single genre. Many critics consider it to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, as well as the foremost of Soviet satires.

== History ==
Mikhail Bulgakov was born in Kiev on May 15th, 1891. He moved to Moscow in 1921. It was in Moscow that he would begin work on &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;. Bulgakov was first trained as a doctor, which influenced his subsequent works. This is especially evident in &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; when the body is described or when characters receive certain injuries. Only later did Bulgakov became a playwright and author. He started writing &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; in 1928, but burned the first manuscript in 1930 (just as his character the Master did) as he could not see a future as a writer in the Soviet Union at a time of widespread political repression. He restarted the novel in 1931. In the early 1920s, Bulgakov had visited an editorial meeting of an atheist journal. He is believed to have drawn from this to create the Walpurgis Night ball of the novel. He completed his second draft in 1936, by which point he had devised the major plot lines of the final version. He wrote another four versions. When Bulgakov stopped writing four weeks before his death in 1940, the novel had some unfinished sentences and loose ends. His novel was also written amidst heavy criticism for his other works and plays. During this time, he wrote to Stalin asking to be allowed to leave Russia because he felt that the literature critics at the time were proving that Bulgakov&#x27;s writing did not belong in Russia. This was not approved, which greatly affected the writing of the piece including the descriptions of the Master and his works.

A censored version, with about 12 percent of the text removed and more changed, was first published in &quot;Moskva&quot; magazine (no. 11, 1966 and no. 1, 1967). A manuscript was smuggled out of the Soviet Union to Paris, where the YMCA Press, celebrated for publishing the banned work of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, published the first book edition in 1967. The text, as published in the magazine &quot;Moskva&quot;, was swiftly translated into Estonian and printed in 1967 by the company Eesti Raamat. This version included many scenes and themes that had previously been censoredfor example, Bulgakov&#x27;s commentary on Soviet moral and governmental corruption. The Italian publisher Einaudi published the book in Russian in 1967 as well. For decades this remained the only printed edition of the novel in book form available in the Soviet Union. The original text of all the omitted and changed parts, with indications of the places of modification, was printed and distributed by hand in the Soviet Union (in the dissident practice known as &quot;samizdat&quot;). In 1969, the publisher Posev printed a version produced with the aid of these inserts.

The first complete version, prepared by Anna Sahakyants, was published in Russian by &quot;Khudozhestvennaya Literatura&quot; in 1973. This was based on Bulgakov&#x27;s last 1940 version, as proofread by the publisher. This version remained the canonical edition until 1989. It is unknown how much of this version was influenced by Elena Shilovskaya, Bulgakov&#x27;s third and final wife, as she had been in possession of the remaining manuscript notes. Due to the high quantity of manuscripts and drafts, it is near impossible to state which, if any, version of the novel is truly canonical. The last version, based on all available manuscripts, was prepared by Lidiya Yanovskaya.

== Plot ==
The novel has two settings. The first is Moscow during the 1930s, where Satan appears at Patriarch&#x27;s Ponds as Professor Woland. He is accompanied by Koroviev, a grotesquely dressed valet; Behemoth, a black cat; Azazello, a hitman; and Hella, a female vampire. They target the literary elite and their trade union: Massolit, whose headquarters is Griboyedov House. Massolit consists of corrupt social climbers: bureaucrats, profiteers, and cynics. The second setting is the Jerusalem of Pontius Pilate: Pilate&#x27;s trial of Yeshua Ha-Notsri (Jesus of Nazareth), his recognition of an affinity with (and spiritual need for) Yeshua, and his reluctant acquiescence to Yeshua&#x27;s execution. The Jerusalem plot of the novel is later revealed to be the novel written by the Master.

Part one opens with a confrontation between Berlioz (the head of Massolit) and Woland, who prophesies that Berlioz will die later that evening. This interaction between Woland and Berlioz is mirrored by the trial of Yeshua by Pontius Pilate. Woland entrances Berlioz in the story that leads up to Yeshua&#x27;s execution. In the story, Yeshua is presented as having inhuman characteristics. Woland tells this story to convince his audience of God&#x27;s existence, but the two Soviet authors refuse to believe him. The Professor also predicts the way Berlioz will die, saying that his head will be cut off by a Russian woman, and that it must happen, because &#x27;Annushka has already brought the sunflower oil.&#x27; Although Berlioz dismisses his death prophecy as insane raving, he slips on the spilled oil and has his head decapitated by a tram car driven by a Russian woman, dying in the same way that the professor predicted. In fact, shortly before Berlioz&#x27;s accident, Woland informs the two writers that &quot;there exists a seventh proof&quot; of the devil&#x27;s existence, so in this way the predetermined nature of Berlioz&#x27;s death is framed as proof of both God&#x27;s and the devil&#x27;s existence. The fulfillment of his death prophecy is witnessed by Ivan Nikolaevich Ponyrev, a young, enthusiastic, modern poet who uses the pen name &quot;Bezdomny&quot; (&quot;homeless&quot;). His &quot;nom de plume&quot; alludes to Maxim Gorky (Maxim the Bitter), Demyan Bedny (Demyan the Poor), and Michail Golodny (Michail the Hungry). His futile attempts to capture the &quot;gang&quot; (Woland and his entourage) and his warnings about their evil nature land Ivan in a lunatic psychiatric clinic, where he is treated by Stravinsky, a local doctor. The care he receives in the clinic is very good, especially by the standards of the time. It thus serves as an important place in the novel for many characters whom Woland confronts, and derives special importance from its bringing together of Ivan and the Master, an embittered author whose name connects to the title of the text. The Master explains to Ivan that the rejection of his novel about Pontius Pilate and Christ led the Master to burn his manuscript in despair and turn his back on Margarita, his devoted lover. 

In Moscow, Woland and his retinue put on a show at the Variety theater. During the show master of ceremonies Bengalsky&#x27;s head is ripped off then reattached at the urging of the audience. The audience is amazed when Koroviev makes money rain down and when Woland&#x27;s retinue gives out luxury fashion items to the women of the audience. Later the money and clothes disappear, causing chaos and embarrassment. Here, Bulgakov portrays women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s sins very differently. The women of Moscow are condemned for accepting free clothing, while the men are condemned for adultery, excessive greed, etc., and the two are portrayed as equivalent transgressions. During this performance, Woland notes the lack of moral progress made in Soviet society, remarking that despite their technological advancements such as &quot;buses, telephones, and other [apparatuses],&quot; Muscovites remain &quot;people like any other people... they love money, but that has always been so.&quot; The key difference between the Muscovites Woland observes now and the Muscovites of the past is believed, by Woland, to be due to the housing crisis in Moscow. Woland cites the &quot;housing problem&quot; as what has corrupted these Muscovites to an even further level than what Woland has noted in the past. This scene is a key moment in Bulgakov&#x27;s societal criticism.

The story returns to Jerusalem, where Ivan dreams of the execution of Yeshua as witnessed by Matthew Levi. The dream opens with Yeshua and two other prisoners, who are making their way to Bald Mountain, where they will be executed by being hung on wooden posts. In an attempt to save Yeshua from a torturous death, Levi steals a knife to kill him quickly, but he is too late to reach Yeshua. Yeshua hangs on the cross and suffers in the excruciating heat for hours until an executioner offers him some water and kills him, by stabbing him in the heart with a spear. As he dies, a great storm appears, filling the sky with thunder and lightning and raining heavily down on the people below. Levi cuts down the three bodies of the dead prisoners, before putting the body of Yeshua on his shoulder, and carrying it away.

Back in Moscow, after Woland&#x27;s performance, the city is thrown into confusion. At the Variety Theatre, the highest-ranking employee left is Vassily Stepanovich, the bookkeeper. His attempt to make sense of the show&#x27;s aftermath reveals a trail of chaos left by Woland and his retinue. Rubles are transforming into insects, bureaucrats have been replaced by animate suits, and entire offices have been cursed to break into song against their will. As a result of this chaos, truckloads of Muscovites are shipped off to Stravinsky&#x27;s clinic. Similarly, Berlioz&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s attempt to claim his late nephew&#x27;s apartment is thwarted by Behemoth and Azezello, who send him violently off. Immediately thereafter, Andrei Sokov, barman at the Variety Theatre, visits the apartment. Woland welcomes him in, offering fine food and drink, though Sokov declines these niceties. After some conversation, Woland reveals to Sokov that he will soon die of liver cancer and suggests that he spend his savings to enjoy a short life of hedonism.

Part two introduces Margarita, the Master&#x27;s mistress, who refuses to despair of her lover and his work. Azazello gives her a magical skin ointment, which turns her invisible, and invites her to the Devil&#x27;s midnight Good Friday ball, where Woland gives her the chance to become a witch.

Margarita enters the realm of night and learns to fly and control her unleashed passions. Natasha, her maid, accompanies her, riding on their neighbor Nikolai Ivanovich who has taken the form of a pig, as they fly over the Soviet Union&#x27;s deep forests and rivers. Margarita bathes and returns to Moscow with Azazello as the hostess of Satan&#x27;s spring ball. At Koroviev&#x27;s side, she welcomes dark historical figures as they arrive from Hell.

Margarita survives the ordeal, and Satan offers to grant her deepest wish. She chooses to ask to free a woman she met at the ball from eternal punishment. The woman, who had been raped, murdered her child; her punishment was to wake each morning next to the handkerchief she used to smother it. Satan tells Margarita that she liberated the woman, and still has a wish to claim from him. She asks for the Master to be delivered to her and he appears, dazed and thinking he is still in the lunatic asylum. They are returned to the basement apartment which had been their love nest.

Matthew Levi delivers the verdict to Woland: the reunited couple will be sent to the afterlife. Azazello brings them a gift from Woland: a bottle of Pontius Pilate&#x27;s (poisoned) wine. The Master and Margarita die; Azazello brings their souls to Satan and his retinue (awaiting them on horseback on a Moscow rooftop), and they fly away into the unknown, as cupolas and windows burn in the setting sun, leaving Earth behind and traveling into dark cosmic space. The Master and Margarita will spend eternity together in a shady, pleasant region resembling Dante Alighieri&#x27;s Limbo, in a house under flowering cherry trees.

Woland and his retinue, including the Master and Margarita, become pure spirits. Moscow&#x27;s authorities attribute its strange events to hysteria and mass hypnosis. In the final chapter, Woland tells the Master to finish his novel about Pontius Pilatecondemned by cowardice to limbo for eternity. The Master shouts &quot;You are free! He is waiting for you!&quot;; Pontius Pilate is freed, walking and talking with the Yeshua whose spirit and philosophy he had secretly admired. Moscow is now peaceful, although some experience great disquiet every May full moon. Ivan Ponyrev becomes a professor of philosophy, but he does not write poetry anymore.

== Interpretations ==
There are several interpretations of the novel:

* Response to aggressive atheistic propaganda
Some critics suggest that Bulgakov was responding to poets and writers who he believed were spreading atheist propaganda in the Soviet Union, and denying Jesus Christ as a historical person. He particularly objected to the anti-religious poems of Demyan Bedny. The novel can be seen as a rebuke to aggressively &quot;godless people&quot;. There is justification in both the Moscow and the Judaea sections of the novel for the entire image of the devil. Bulgakov uses characters from Jewish demonology as a retort to the denial of God in the USSR.

Literary critic and assistant professor at the Russian State Institute of Performing Arts Nadezhda Dozhdikova notes that the image of Jesus as a harmless madman presented in ″Master and Margarita″ has its source in the literature of the USSR of the 1920s, which, following the tradition of the demythologization of Jesus in the works of Strauss, Renan, Nietzsche and Binet-Sanglé, put forward two main themes – mental illness and deception. The mythological option, namely the denial of the historical existence of Jesus, only prevailed in the Soviet propaganda at the turn of the 1920s and 1930s.

* Reflection of Bulgakov&#x27;s experiences as a Soviet writer

Commentators often note autobiographical elements in the novel. Beyond parallels between fictional characters and Bulgakov&#x27;s acquaintances, the work has been examined as a reflection of Bulgakov&#x27;s own psychological troubles spurred by the oppression he faced in his creative career. Some also interpret Ivan and the Master as prototypes of the extremities of Soviet attitudes towards writers. Whereas Ivan is a celebrated rising star supported by MASSOLIT, the Master is a literary outsider who is at once denounced and cast away after submitting his novel for publishing. As a Soviet writer, Bulgakov walked a fine line between the two. Professor of religion and peace studies Alexandra Carroll analyzes Woland through the lens of Jungian psychology, suggesting that Woland serves as a &quot;shadow archetype&quot;, which she defines as a &quot;paradoxical figure of evil that appears malevolent, yet works towards an individual&#x27;s psychological renewal&quot;. Other commentators note that Bulgakov&#x27;s life experiences have also likely influenced the Yershalaim narrative of the novel; Haber and Weeks argue that it is Bulgakov&#x27;s father&#x27;s academic work that influenced the narrative, rather than Bulgakov&#x27;s own view of evil. Weeks interprets this as &quot;Bulgakov&#x27;s return to elements of his own childhood.&quot;
* Occlusive interpretation
Bulgakov portrays evil as being as inseparable from our world, as light is from darkness. Both Satan and Jesus Christ dwell mostly inside people. Jesus was unable to see Judas&#x27;s treachery, despite Pilate&#x27;s hints, because he saw only good in people. He couldn&#x27;t protect himself, because he didn&#x27;t know how, nor from whom. This interpretation presumes that Bulgakov had his own vision of Tolstoy&#x27;s idea of resistance to evil through non-violence, by creating this image of Yeshua.

== The Spring Festival Ball at Spaso House ==

On 24 April 1935, Bulgakov was among the invited guests who attended the Spring Festival at Spaso House, the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, hosted by Ambassador William Bullitt. Critics believe Bulgakov drew from this extravagant event for his novel. In the middle of the Great Depression and Stalinist repression, Bullitt had instructed his staff to create an event that would surpass every other embassy party in Moscow&#x27;s history. The decorations included a forest of ten young birch trees in the chandelier room; a dining room table covered with Finnish tulips; a lawn made of chicory grown on wet felt; a fishnet aviary filled with pheasants, parakeets, and one hundred zebra finches, on loan from the Moscow Zoo; and a menagerie including several mountain goats, a dozen white roosters, and a baby bear.

Although Joseph Stalin didn&#x27;t attend, the 400 elite guests at the festival included Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov, Defense Minister Kliment Voroshilov, Communist Party heavyweights Nikolai Bukharin, Lazar Kaganovich, and Karl Radek, Soviet Marshals Aleksandr Yegorov, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, and Semyon Budyonny, and other high-ranking guests.

The festival lasted until the early hours of the morning. The bear became drunk on champagne given to him by Karl Radek. In the early morning hours, the zebra finches escaped from the aviary and perched below the ceilings around the house.

In his novel, Bulgakov featured the &quot;Spring Ball of the Full Moon&quot;, considered to be one of the most memorable episodes. On 29 October 2010, seventy-five years after the original ball, John Beyrle, U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation, hosted an Enchanted Ball at Spaso House, recreating the spirit of the original ball as a tribute to Ambassador Bullitt and Bulgakov.

== Major characters ==
=== Contemporary Russians ===
;The Master: An author who wrote a novel about the meeting of Pontius Pilate and Yeshua Ha-Notsri (Jesus of Nazareth), which was rejected by the Soviet literary bureaucracy, ruining his career. He is &quot;detained for questioning&quot; for three months by the secret police because of a false report by an unscrupulous neighbor. Later, having been driven to the point of insanity by the critics (as the Master describes in Chapter 13), he is committed to a psychiatric clinic, where Bezdomny meets him. Little else is given about this character&#x27;s past other than his belief that his life began to have meaning when he met Margarita. Underscoring this point, the Master wears a hat with an &quot;M&quot; on it, made for and given to him by Margarita. The Master claims that he renounced his own name, further demonstrating his symbolic identity. The Master is an author surrogate for Bulgakov himself, as he represents Bulgakov&#x27;s own struggles with censorship, criticism and stifled creativity in the Soviet Union. Further underscoring the Master&#x27;s role as Bulgakov&#x27;s shadow, The Master&#x27;s title allegedly stems from a nickname that the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union William Bullitt coined for Bulgakov.

;Margarita: The Master&#x27;s lover. Trapped in a passionless marriage, she devotes herself to the Master. She is invited by Azazello to serve as the hostess of Satan&#x27;s Grand Ball on Walpurgis Night. Margarita agrees as she believes this step may save her love. Her character is believed to have been inspired by Bulgakov&#x27;s last wife, Elena Bulgakova, whom he called &quot;my Margarita&quot;. He may also have been influenced by Faust&#x27;s Gretchen, whose full name is Margarita, as well as by Queen Marguerite de Valois. The latter is featured as the main character of the opera &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; by Giacomo Meyerbeer, which Bulgakov particularly enjoyed, and Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s novel, &quot;La Reine Margot&quot;. In these accounts, the queen is portrayed as daring and passionate.

;Mikhail Alexandrovich Berlioz: The Chairman of the literary bureaucracy MASSOLIT. He bears the last name (Берлиоз) of French composer Hector Berlioz, who wrote the opera &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot;. Berlioz is a loyal supporter of the Stalinist regime and the ideology it purports. Following Soviet atheism, he insists to Ivan Nikolayevich Ponyryov that the Gospel Jesus was a mythical figure with no historical basis. Woland intervenes in this conversation, and later predicts that Berlioz will be decapitated by a young Soviet woman, which comes to pass when he slips on oil spilled by &quot;Annushka&quot; and is subsequently run over (and beheaded) by a tram.

;Ivan Nikolayevich Ponyryov (Bezdomny): A young, aspiring poet. His pen name, Bezdomny (Иван Бездомный), means &quot;homeless&quot;. Initially a willing tool of the MASSOLIT apparatus, he is transformed by the events of the novel. After witnessing the unfolding of Woland&#x27;s predictionBerlioz&#x27;s deathhe embarks on a wild chase around Moscow in search of Woland and his entourage. However, Ivan leads himself to a communal apartment and later to the Moscow River, where he engages in a symbolic self-baptism. Unable to rationalize the events he has witnessed, his psychological distress mounts and his behavior becomes increasingly erratic. His seemingly irrational claims about Woland lead him to be taken to Doctor Stravinsky’s psychiatric clinic, where he is diagnosed with schizophrenia and meets the Master. He eventually decides to stop writing poetry and comes to terms with the tragedy. Before settling on Bezdomny, Bulgakov tried many other names in earlier versions of the novel, including Bezrodny (&quot;the lonely&quot;), Besprizorny (&quot;the stray kid&quot;), Bezbrezhny (&quot;the boundless&quot;) and many others. Proletarian writers often used similar pseudonyms; a notable example is Maxim Gorky (&quot;the bitter&quot;).

;Stephan Bogdanovich Likhodeyev: The Director of the Variety Theatre and Berlioz&#x27;s roommate, often called by the diminutive name &quot;Styopa (Stepa)&quot;. His surname is derived from the Russian word for &quot;malfeasant&quot;. For his wicked deeds (denouncing at least five innocent people as spies so that he and Berlioz could grab their multi-bedroom apartment), he is magically teleported to Yalta, thereby freeing up the stolen apartment for Woland and his retinue.

;Grigory Danilovich Rimsky: The Treasurer of the Variety Theatre. Rimsky is the only character to escape from an attack by Woland&#x27;s entourage. Despite trying to find logical explanations for Styopa&#x27;s disappearance and other odd phenomena, he realizes that Varenukha is lying to him when he outlines a seemingly reasonable explanation for where Styopa had gone, and correctly identifies that Varenukha has no shadow, which is impossible under normal circumstances. On the night of Woland&#x27;s performance, Rimsky is ambushed by Varenukha (who has been turned into a vampire by Woland&#x27;s gang) and Hella. He barely escapes the encounter and flees to the train station to get out of the city.

;Ivan Savelyevich Varenukha: The administrator of the Variety Theatre, whose surname refers to a traditional Ukrainian spiced vodka resembling mulled wine. He is turned into a creature of darkness when Hella ambushes him in his attempt to report the odd circumstances surrounding Styopa&#x27;s disappearance to the authorities. He is forgiven by the end of Walpurgis Night, restoring his humanity.

;Alexander Riukhin: A poet who brings Ivan to Dr Stravinsky&#x27;s psychiatric clinic. He is tormented by Ivan&#x27;s insults of the integrity of his poetry and acknowledges that his poetry is bad because he doesn&#x27;t believe in anything he writes. As the night ends, he mourns the loss of the night of fun and feasting he could&#x27;ve had at Griboedov&#x27;s.

;Natasha (Natalia Prokofyevna): Margarita&#x27;s young maid, later turned into a witch after using Azazello&#x27;s magic cream on herself.

;Nikolai Ivanovich: Margarita&#x27;s downstairs neighbor, who rubs Azazello&#x27;s magic cream on himself and turns into a hog. Natasha rides Nikolai (as a hog) to Woland&#x27;s Ball. He receives a certificate from Woland that confirms his activity of attending the ball and turning into a hog on the night of the ball.

;Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy: The Chairman of the House Committee at 302A Sadovaya Street (the former residence of Berlioz). Unlike regular Moscow citizens, who generally live in communal apartments, Bosoy shares an entire apartment with only his wife. After Bosoy accepts a bribe from Koroviev for allowing Woland to stay in the Berliozs&#x27; apartment, Woland swiftly punishes his crookedness. The bribe from Koroviev magically turns into foreign money, and Bosoy is arrested by the secret police. Bosoy&#x27;s character is loosely based on one of Bulgakov&#x27;s own landlords, Nikolay Zotkiovitch Raev, who similarly abused his power.

;Maximilian Andreevich Poplavsky: An uncle of Mikhail Alexandrovich Berlioz. He is a highly educated man who comes to Moscow from Kyiv in an attempt to claim Berlioz&#x27;s Moscow apartment. When he arrives, he is mocked by Koroviev for trying to take advantage of Berlioz&#x27;s death while not feeling any genuine grief for the deceased. Ultimately, he is sent home by Woland&#x27;s retinue.

;Andrei Fokich Sokov: The barman at the Variety Theater; a short, bald, and outwardly-humble character. In an apartment commandeered by Woland and his retinue, Sokov is interrogated and ultimately it is revealed that, behind his humble and well-behaved veil, the barman has amassed an enormous fortune. He is then told by Woland that he will die of liver cancer in nine months&#x27; time, and finds himself in Professor Kuzmin&#x27;s office desperately begging to be cured.

;Doctor Stravinsky: The head of the clinic in which the Master, &quot;Homeless&quot; and other characters reside, Stravinsky plays an important role in the novel. When Ivan arrives in the clinic after witnessing Berlioz&#x27;s decapitation, Stravinsky diagnoses him with schizophrenia and alcoholism, and insists he remains in the clinic because he believes that Ivan&#x27;s story is a sign of mental illness. Ivan insists upon leaving the clinic, but Stravinsky manipulates him in discussion and convinces him that he must remain there.

;George Bengalsky: The master of ceremonies at the Variety Theater. Bengalsky, after commenting on black magic at Woland&#x27;s performance, is beheaded by Woland&#x27;s retinue. His head is returned after the audience forgives him. Later, it is implied that he is in Stravinsky&#x27;s clinic. Bengalsky is meant to represent the Soviet public and their refusal to believe in magic and religion; he makes sure to describe the &quot;rational&quot; explanations behind all of Woland&#x27;s tricks and becomes irritated when Woland refuses to admit that there are explanations for his magic. Woland becomes angry with Bengalsky because Woland sees him as a symbol of Soviet brainwashing; the citizens believe only what they are told and cannot think for themselves, even when the simple truth is right in front of them. 

;Vassily Stepanovich Lastochkin: The bookkeeper at the Variety Theater. Described by Bulgakov as &quot;precise and efficient&quot;, Lastochkin is not present for Woland&#x27;s séance and is left to make sense of the event&#x27;s aftermath for the police as the theater&#x27;s most senior remaining member. After being questioned by the police, Lastochkin heads to the Commission on Spectacles and Entertainment of the Lighter Type to explain the prior day&#x27;s events, but is greeted by pandemonium as the Commission&#x27;s chairman has been turned into a talking suit. Unable to file his report there, Lastochkin continues on his way to the Commission&#x27;s affiliate, where he encounters further havoc as the staff have been forced to sing uncontrollably. His final stop of the day takes him to the bank to deposit the Variety&#x27;s earnings from Woland&#x27;s performance. There, upon discovering that the fees have turned into thousands in various foreign currencies, Lastochkin is promptly and unceremoniously arrested.

=== Woland and his entourage ===
;Woland: Woland (Воланд, also spelled as Voland) is Satan in the disguise of a &quot;foreign professor&quot; who is &quot;in Moscow to present a performance of &#x27;black magic&#x27; and then expose its machinations&quot;. Woland instead exposes the greed and bourgeois behaviour of the spectators themselves. Woland is described as having platinum crowns on the left side of his teeth and gold on the right, with his right eye black and his left eye green. The contrasts in his appearance reflect the complexity of his character and moral positioning within the novel. Woland is also mentioned in Faust when Mephistopheles announces to the witches to beware because &quot;Squire Voland is here&quot;. Along with that, it is highly implied throughout the novel that he is present as the devil in the form of a sparrow (such as in the Pilate narrative). In the previous versions of &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, Woland&#x27;s name changed multiple times. In the second version from 1929, his name was Dr Theodor Voland. The name was written down and given to Ivan Bezdomniy in Greek letters as opposed to the Cyrillic letters. In a subsequent version of the novel, Woland&#x27;s name changed to господин [gospodin] or seigneur Azazello Woland. The demon we now know as Azazello was called Fiello. Only in 1934, the definitive names of Woland and Azazello got their final meaning.

;Behemoth: An enormous demonic black cat (said to be as big as a hog) who speaks, walks on two legs, and can transform into human shape for brief periods of time. He has a penchant for chess, vodka, pistols, and obnoxious sarcasm. He is evidently the least-respected member of Woland&#x27;s teamMargarita boldly takes to slapping Behemoth on the head after one of his many ill-timed jokes, without fear of retaliation. In the last chapters, it appears that Behemoth is a demon pageboy, the best clown in the world. His name (Бегемот) refers to both the Biblical monster and the Russian word for hippopotamus. Behemoth is a well-known character from &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, and he is frequently depicted. However, in the original version of the novel from 1928 to 1929, which was titled &quot;The Black Magician&quot;, there was a sentence mentioning the presence of a second cat on the curtain rod when the theatre&#x27;s buffet master visits Woland. Bulgakov later abandoned the idea of having two cats in the story.

;Korovyev: Also known as Fagotto (Фагот, meaning &quot;bassoon&quot; in Russian and other languages), he is described as an &quot;ex-choirmaster&quot;, perhaps implying that he was once a member of an angelic choir. Korovyev&#x27;s name is also based on the Russian word for &quot;cow&quot; (Корова), a reference to Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, where Mephistopheles praises a &quot;Calf of Gold&quot;. Being the only member of Woland and his entourage with a Russian name, he is Woland&#x27;s assistant and translator, and is capable of creating any illusion. Unlike Behemoth and Azazello, he doesn&#x27;t use violence at any point. Like Behemoth, his true form is revealed at the end: a never-smiling dark knight. In penance for a poorly-made joke he was forced to assume the role of a jester; he paid off his debt by serving Satan on his Moscow journey. Vasily Ivanovich Shverubovich (1875-1948), an actor at the Moscow Art Theatre (MkhAT) who performed under the name Vasily Ivanovich Katshalov, is a possible inspiration for Koroviev. Katshalov hailed from Vilnius, Lithuania, and had a distinctive accent when he sang. He was tall and thin, standing at 1.85 meters, and wore pince-nez glasses due to his nearsightedness. Kachalov possessed an irresistible charm on stage with his eloquently speaking, pleasant voice, and a great sense of humor. Another MkhAT actor and director, Grigory Grigoryevich Konsky (1911-1972), also shared some characteristics with Bulgakov&#x27;s portrayal of Koroviev. He was a close friend of the Bulgakov family and known as a &quot;master of irony and humor&quot;.

;Azazello: Azazello (Азазелло) is a menacing, fanged, and wall-eyed member of Woland&#x27;s retinue who acts as a messenger and assassin. His name may be a reference to Azazel, the fallen angel who taught people to make weapons and jewelry, and taught women the &quot;sinful art&quot; of painting their faces (mentioned in the pseudepigraphal Book of Enoch 8:1–3). He gives a magical cream to Margarita. He transforms into his real shape in the end: a pale-faced demon with black, empty eyes. Bulgakov appends an Italian suffix to the Hebrew name עֲזָאזֵל [Azazel]. The name Azazel is frequently associated with Satan in various religious texts and beliefs. In Bulgakov&#x27;s archives, a book called Azazel and Dionysus was discovered, published in 1924 and authored by Nikolai Evreinov (1879-1953), who was a director, dramatist, historian, philosopher, and psychologist.

;Hella: Hella (Гелла) is a beautiful, redheaded succubus. Her name may be a reference to the &quot;Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary&quot; (the Soviet equivalent of the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;), underneath the section on &quot;witchcraft&quot;, where &quot;Hella&quot; was one of the names of premature girls who became vampires after death on the island of Lesbos. She serves as maid to Woland and his retinue. She is described as being &quot;perfect, were it not for a purple scar on her neck&quot;, suggesting that she has been executed by hanging. In the earlier version of the book, she was named Marta. According to Valery Konstantinovich Mershavka, a Russian psychologist and translator, Hella was inspired by Sophia Perovskaya. Perovskaya was a member of the socialist revolutionary organization named The Will of the People and participated in three attempts to assassinate Tsar Alexander II, the last of which was successful, leading to her execution by hanging.

=== Characters from Judaea subplot ===
; Pontius Pilate: The Roman Procurator of Judaea (a governor of a small province). The historical Pontius Pilate was the Prefect of Judaea, not the procurator. This fact was not widely known until after Bulgakov&#x27;s death. In the novel, Pontius Pilate is a central character in the subplot set in ancient Jerusalem. Pilate suffers terribly from migraines, has suicidal thoughts, and loves only his dog, Banga. He is tasked with determining Yeshua Ha-Notsri&#x27;s guilt and ultimately is responsible for his death sentence. Nevertheless, after this sentencing, Pilate experiences feelings of guilt and doubt: &quot;it seemed vaguely to the procurator that there was something he had not finished saying to the condemned man, and perhaps something he had not finished hearing.&quot; Thus, overall, Bulgakov&#x27;s portrayal of Pontius Pilate offers a nuanced exploration of human nature and the consequences of moral choices.

; Yeshua Ha-Notsri: Jesus the Nazarene (Иешуа га-Ноцри), a wanderer or &quot;mad philosopher&quot;, as Pilate calls him. His name in Hebrew is said to mean either &quot;Jesus who belongs to the Nazarene sect&quot; or &quot;Jesus who is from a place called Nazareth&quot;, though some commentators dispute the latter interpretation. In the Master&#x27;s version, Yeshua describes himself as an orphan (he says &quot;some say that my father was a Syrian&quot;), calls everybody (even a torturer) &quot;kind man&quot;, denies doing miracles, and has one full-time &quot;Apostle&quot;, not twelve, among other departures from the Gospels and mainstream Christian tradition. In the Master&#x27;s novel there is not a hint of the cleansing of the Temple or cursing the fig tree. The atheist regime of the novel still considers this Jesus to be offensive.

; Aphranius: (or Afranius). Head of the Roman Secret Service in Judaea. That character was later an inspiration for the 1995 novel &quot;The Gospel of Afranius&quot; by Kirill Eskov.

; Niza: Aphranius&#x27;s henchwoman, who entices Judas to his death.

; Levi Matvei: Levite, former tax collector, follower of Yeshua. Levi attempts to save Yeshua with a bread knife, and after failing, he is the only spectator, except for the executioners, of Yeshua&#x27;s death and cuts Yeshua&#x27;s body down from the cross. Levi is introduced as a semi-fictionalized character in the Master&#x27;s novel, but toward the end of &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, the &quot;historical&quot; Matthew of the Gospel appears in Moscow to deliver a message from Yeshua to Woland.

; Caiaphas: Politically savvy High Priest of Judaea. Caiaphas supports the execution of Yeshua in order to &quot;protect&quot; the status quo ante religion, and his own status as the Chief of the Sanhedrin, from the influence of Yeshua&#x27;s preachings and followers. He is considerably more aggressive towards Pilate than most accounts, and seems unconcerned by the other man&#x27;s senior status.

; Mark the Ratslayer: The centurion in Yershalaim. Tall, strong, and physically intimidating, the Ratslayer is an agent of the state and a symbol of its brutality. Mark the Ratslayer also illustrates Yeshua&#x27;s argument about humanity&#x27;s inherent goodness. Despite his cruelty, Yeshua claims that the Ratslayer is not a bad person; he has simply &quot;become cruel and hard&quot; after being disfigured by others and subjected to violence himself.
; Banga: Pilate&#x27;s loyal dog. He provides Pilate with comfort and Pilate feels comfortable complaining to him about his headaches. Banga is the only &quot;being&quot; Pilate is attached to, and therefore fosters a humanization of the procurator, characterizing him as profoundly lonely. 

; Judas Iscariot: A spy/informant hired by Caiaphas to assist the authorities in finding and arresting Yeshua. In contrast to the Gospels&#x27; version, in which Judas is a long-time member of Jesus&#x27;s &quot;inner circle&quot; of Apostles, Bulgakov&#x27;s Judas (of Karioth) meets Yeshua for the first time less than 48 hours before betraying him. He is paid off by Caiaphas, but is later assassinated on Pilate&#x27;s orders for his role in Yeshua&#x27;s death.

== Themes and imagery ==
The novel deals with the interplay of good and evil, innocence and guilt, courage and cowardice, exploring such issues as the responsibility towards truth when authority would deny it, and freedom of the spirit in an unfree world. Love and sensuality are also dominant themes in the novel.

=== Love ===
Margarita&#x27;s devotional love for the Master leads her to leave her husband, but she emerges victorious. Her spiritual union with the Master is also a sexual one. The novel is a riot of sensual impressions, but the emptiness of sensual gratification without love is emphasized in the satirical passages. Rejecting sensuality for the sake of empty respectability is pilloried in the figure of Nikolai Ivanovich, who becomes Natasha&#x27;s hog-broomstick. Love is not only relevant in the Master&#x27;s relationship with Margarita, but also his relationship with writing as a whole. After he wins the lottery and leaves his job at the museum, he decides to purchase a flat where he can hide out and write. It is here that he begins his novel on Pilate. This novel takes him through many ups and downs, culminating in his capture and internment in the mental hospital, but only after he destroys his novel.

=== Religion ===
The interplay of fire, water, destruction, and other natural forces provides a constant accompaniment to the events of the novel, as do light and darkness, noise and silence, sun and moon, storms and tranquility, and other powerful polarities. There is a complex relationship between Jerusalem and Moscow throughout the novel, sometimes polyphony, sometimes counterpoint. Though the two parts of the novel are set centuries apart, the action in both unfolds in parallel over the course of five days (Wednesday to Sunday). The chapters consisting of the Jerusalem story (chapters 2, 16, 25, and 26) are woven into the lives of the Moscow characters, and there are several characters that even bridge the two narratives. Woland, who visits Berlioz and Bezdomny in Moscow, claims to have been present during Yeshua&#x27;s trial in Jerusalem. And Levi Matvei, Yeshua&#x27;s disciple, appears in Moscow at the end of the novel. The overlap between the two plot lines is further complicated by the fact that the Jerusalem story is presented as the novel written by the master, raising questions of authorship and muddling the distinction between fiction and reality.

=== Critique of Soviet Regime ===
Bulgakov employs Aesopian language in order to criticize the hypocrisy of Soviet society. He makes a commentary on the flaws of Soviet society by referencing distinct issues such as the housing crisis, corruption and the secret police. His methodology of introducing characters that benefit from the new regime, and then punishing them for their sins through Woland displays his condemnation of the conditions in the 1930s Soviet Union. An issue that is particularly emphasized in the novel is censorship, literary repression and suppression of creativity. Bulgakov&#x27;s portrayal of Massolit writers and their luxurious, extravagant lifestyles is a mockery of their real-life counterparts such as Vladimir Mayakovsky. The novel is a satirical critique of the Soviet regime that condemns the decline of humanity&#x27;s virtues, through its portrayal of secondary characters. Bulgakov implores a tone of satirical dark comedy when describing neighbors’ random “disappearances”, Stepan’s mysterious teleportation to Yalta, and the magical memory erasure that occurs after state-sanctioned interrogations. Bulgakov obscures the tragedy of violence by adding a fantastical element to these overtly dark forms of torture carried out by the Soviet State. This layer of fantasy in turn provided protection for himself, as he was not able to state the atrocities of the government without risking his own safety.

=== Faust ===
The novel is deeply influenced by Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, and its themes of cowardice, trust, intellectual curiosity, and redemption are prominent. It can be read on many different levels, as slapstick, philosophical allegory, and socio-political satire critical of not just the Soviet system but also the superficiality and vanity of modern life in general. Jazz is presented with an ambivalent fascination and revulsion. But the novel is full of modern elements, such as the model asylum, radio, street and shopping lights, cars, lorries, trams, and air travel. There is little evident nostalgia for any &quot;good old days&quot; – the only figures who mention Tsarist Russia are Satan and the Narrator, who directly addresses characters in the novel and the reader multiple times. It also has strong elements of what in the later 20th century was called magic realism.

== Allusions and references to other works ==
The novel is influenced by the Faust legend, particularly the first part of the Goethe interpretation, The Devil&#x27;s Pact, which goes back to the 4th century; Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Dr Faustus&quot; (where in the last act the hero cannot burn his manuscript or receive forgiveness from a loving God); and the libretto of the opera whose music was composed by Charles Gounod. Also of influence is Louis Hector Berlioz who wrote the opera &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot;. In this opera there are four characters: Faust (tenor), the devil Méphistophélès (baritone), Marguerite (mezzo-soprano) and Brander (bass). And also the Symphonie Fantastique where the hero dreams of his own decapitation and attending a witches&#x27; sabbath. In addition, allusions are made to the work of Igor Stravinsky numerous times: prominent character and clinic head Doctor Stravinsky shares the composer&#x27;s name, and references to specific compositions are made in the novel.

Satirical poetics of Nikolai Gogol and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin are seen as an influence, as is the case in other Bulgakov novels. Bulgakov perceived and embodied the principles of Gogol&#x27;s and Saltykov-Shchedrin&#x27;s world perception through the comic mixing of absurd, ghostly and real. Technical progress and the rapid development of mechanized production in the 20th century, combined with the satirical motive of primitivism, characteristic of Russian literature, left an imprint on the nature of Bulgakov&#x27;s grotesque.

The dialogue between Pontius Pilate and Yeshua Ha-Notsri is strongly influenced by Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s parable &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot; from &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;. The &quot;luckless visitors chapter&quot; refers to Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;: &quot;everything became jumbled in the Oblonsky household&quot;. The theme of the Devil exposing society as an apartment block, as it could be seen if the entire façade would be removed, has some precedents in &quot;El diablo cojuelo&quot; (1641, &quot;The Lame Devil&quot; or &quot;The Crippled Devil&quot;) by the Spaniard Luís Vélez de Guevara. (This was adapted to 18th-century France by Alain-René Lesage&#x27;s 1707 &quot;Le Diable boiteux&quot;.)

== English translations ==
The novel has been translated several times into English: 
* Mirra Ginsburg&#x27;s 1967 version for Grove Press
* Michael Glenny&#x27;s November 1967 version for Harper and Row and Harvill Press
* Diana Lewis Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 1993 version for Ardis Publishing
* Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky&#x27;s 1997 version for Penguin Books
* Michael Karpelson&#x27;s 2006 version for Lulu Press and Wordsworth
* Hugh Aplin&#x27;s 2008 version for Oneworld Publications
* John Dougherty&#x27;s 2017 version for Russian Tumble 
* Elena Yushenko&#x27;s 2021 version for OmniScriptum
* Sergei Khramtsov-Templar&#x27;s 2000 version (non-published, catalogued with the Library of Congress)

The early translation by Glenny runs more smoothly than that of the modern translations; some Russian-speaking readers consider it to be the only one creating the desired effect, though it may take liberties with the text. The modern translators pay for their attempted closeness by losing idiomatic flow. Literary writer Kevin Moss considers the early translations by Ginsburg and Glenny to be hurried, and lacking much critical depth. As an example, he claims that the more idiomatic translations miss Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;crucial&quot; reference to the devil in Berlioz&#x27;s thoughts (original: &quot;Пожалуй, пора бросить все к черту и в Кисловодск…&quot;):
* &quot;I ought to drop everything and run down to Kislovodsk.&quot; (Ginsburg)
* &quot;I think it&#x27;s time to chuck everything up and go and take the waters at Kislovodsk.&quot; (Glenny)
* &quot;It&#x27;s time to throw everything to the devil and go off to Kislovodsk.&quot; (Burgin and Tiernan O&#x27;Connor)
* &quot;It&#x27;s time to send it all to the devil and go to Kislovodsk.&quot; (Pevear and Volokhonsky)
* &quot;To hell with everything, it&#x27;s time to take that Kislovodsk vacation.&quot; (Karpelson)
* &quot;It&#x27;s time to let everything go to the devil and be off to Kislovodsk.&quot; (Aplin)
* &quot;It&#x27;s time to throw it all to the devil and go to Kislovodsk.&quot; (John Dougherty)

Several literary critics hailed the Burgin/Tiernan O&#x27;Connor translation as the most accurate and complete English translation, particularly when read in tandem with the matching annotations by Bulgakov&#x27;s biographer, Ellendea Proffer. However, these judgements predate translations by Pevear &amp; Volokhonsky, Karpelson, Aplin, and Dougherty. The Karpelson translation, even when republished in the UK by Wordsworth, has not been Anglicised, and retains North American spellings and idioms.

== Cultural influence ==
The book was listed in &quot;Le Monde&quot;″s 100 Books of the Century. Also, when asked by Tyler Cowen, &quot;What&#x27;s your favorite novel?&quot; the technologist Peter Thiel answered, &quot;If you want something a little more intellectual, it&#x27;s probably the Bulgakov novel &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; where the devil shows up in Stalinist Russia, and succeeds, and gives everybody what they want, and everything goes haywire. It&#x27;s hard, because no one believes he&#x27;s real.&quot;

=== &quot;Manuscripts don&#x27;t burn&quot; ===
A memorable and much-quoted line in &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; is &quot;manuscripts don&#x27;t burn&quot; (). The Master is a writer who is plagued both by his own mental problems and the harsh political criticism faced by most Soviet writers in 1930s Moscow in the Stalinist Soviet Union. He burns his treasured manuscript in an effort to cleanse his mind from the troubles the work has brought him. When they finally meet, Woland asks to see the Master&#x27;s novel; the Master apologizes for not being able to do so, as he had burnt it. Woland replies, &quot;You can&#x27;t have done. Manuscripts don&#x27;t burn.&quot; There is a deeply autobiographical element reflected in this passage. Bulgakov burned an early copy of &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; for much the same reasons as he expresses in the novel. Also this may refer to Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s Dr. Faustus where the hero, deviating from previous tales of &#x27;The Devil&#x27;s Pact&#x27;, is unable to burn his books or repent to a merciful God.

=== Bulgakov museums in Moscow ===
In Moscow, two museums honor the memory of Mikhail Bulgakov and &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;. Both are located in Bulgakov&#x27;s former apartment building on Bolshaya Sadovaya Street, No. 10. Since the late 1980s and the fall of the Soviet Union, the building has become a gathering spot for Bulgakov fans, as well as Moscow-based Satanist groups. Over the years they have filled the walls with graffiti. The best drawings were usually kept as the walls were repainted, so that several layers of different colored paints could be seen around them. In 2003, all of the numerous paintings, quips, and drawings were completely whitewashed.

The two museums are rivals: the official Museum M.A. Bulgakov, although established second, identifies as &quot;the first and only Memorial Museum of Mikhail Bulgakov in Moscow&quot;.

* Bulgakov House
The Bulgakov House () is situated on the ground floor of the building. This museum was established as a private initiative on 15 May 2004. It contains personal belongings, photos, and several exhibitions related to Bulgakov&#x27;s life and his different works. Various poetic and literary events are often held. The museum organises tours of &quot;Bulgakov&#x27;s Moscow&quot;, some of which have re-enactors playing characters of &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;. The Bulgakov House also operates the Theatre M.A. Bulgakov and the Café 302-bis.

* Museum M.A. Bulgakov
In apartment number 50 on the fourth floor is the Museum M.A. Bulgakov ( А. Булгаков). This facility is a government initiative, founded on 26 March 2007. It contains personal belongings, photos, and several exhibitions related to Bulgakov&#x27;s life and his different works. Various poetic and literary events are often held here.

=== Allusions and references ===
Various authors and musicians have credited &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; as inspiration for certain works.
* Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones was inspired by the novel in writing the song &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;. Will Self&#x27;s foreword to the Vintage edition of the Michael Glenny translation of the novel suggests the same, and Jagger&#x27;s then girlfriend Marianne Faithfull confirmed it in an interview with Sylvie Simmons from the magazine &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2005. Jagger says so himself in the Stones documentary &quot;Crossfire Hurricane.&quot;
* SORAYA released a song called &#x27;the master and margarita&#x27; co-written with Adrian Grenier. The song was inspired by the novel, SORAYA&#x27;s favourite book, but imagined the story taking place in contemporary Austin Texas. It was distributed by Empire. 
* The grunge band Pearl Jam were influenced by the novel&#x27;s confrontation between Jesus and Pontius Pilate in their song, &quot;Pilate&quot;, on their 1998 album &quot;Yield&quot;.
* The Canadian band The Tea Party has a song named &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;.
* Surrealist artist H. R. Giger named a 1976 painting after the novel. The band Danzig featured this painting on the cover of their 1992 album &quot;Danzig III: How the Gods Kill&quot;.
* The title song on Patti Smith&#x27;s album &quot;Banga&quot; refers to Pontius Pilate and his dog Banga as portrayed in &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;.
* &quot;Master Margherita&quot; - musical band from Switzerland.
* Several songs written by the Chicago punk band The Lawrence Arms, for example &quot;Chapter 13: The Hero Appears&quot; from the 2003 album &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;.
* Russian writers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky were heavily influenced by this novel when writing several of their books. Аmong them are such works as &quot;Snail on the Slope&quot;, &quot;Limping Fate&quot;, &quot;Overburdened with Evil&quot; and others.
* &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; is cited as inspiration for &quot;Devil on the Cross&quot;, a Gikuyu language novel written by Kenyan novelist and Nobel Prize nominee Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o. Thiong&#x27;o wrote the original manuscript as a political prisoner between 1977 and 1978 in Kamiti Maximum Security Prison, where he was detained for a year without trial due to staging his play &quot;Ngaahika Ndeenda&quot;, a work criticizing corruption and hypocrisy amongst the new political elite of Kenya. One of the clear parallels that emerge in &quot;Devil on the Cross&quot; is a celebration known as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Feast,&quot; remindful of &quot;Satan&#x27;s Great Ball&quot; in Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;Master and Margarita&quot;. The Devil&#x27;s Feast in Thiong&#x27;o&#x27;s novel is a festival organized by the devil and neocolonialist powers celebrating seven of the most wicked and corrupt amongst the Kenyan bourgeoisie and awarding them with powerful positions.
* Poppy Z. Brite&#x27;s short story &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; continues &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; with the Devil (masquerading as William C. Bubb) and his &quot;great black cat&quot; (now shaven, and mistaken for a negro) traveling to New Orleans in 1985.

* 1989: Director Roman Polanski was approached by Warner Bros. to adapt and direct Bulgakov&#x27;s novel. The project was subsequently dropped by Warner Bros. due to budgetary concerns and the studio&#x27;s belief that the subject matter was no longer relevant due to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Polanski has described his script as the best he has ever adapted.
* 1992: In the adaptation called &quot;Incident in Judaea&quot; by Paul Bryers, only the Yeshua story is told. The film includes a prologue which mentions Bulgakov and the other storylines.

The grandson of Bulgakov&#x27;s third wife Elena Sergeevna Shilovskaya claimed, as a self-assigned heir, the rights on Bulgakov&#x27;s literary inheritance and refused the release. Since 2006, copies of the movie have existed on DVD. Some excerpts can be viewed on the &quot;Master and Margarita&quot; website. The movie was finally released in cinemas on April 4, 2011.

German actor August Diehl is Woland, Yevgeny Tsyganov is the Master, and Yuliya Snigir is Margarita. Earlier production attempts started in 2013 but stopped. Eventually in 2019 new right holders started working with Lockshin. In 2020 they wrote a new script, which then was shot in 2021 in Russia and Croatia. Distribution efforts were put on hold in 2022 because of distributor Universal Pictures pulling out of Russia after Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, and the director&#x27;s stance about the war. The release date was pushed back from 2023 to January 25, 2024. The world premiere outside of the Russia was on March 6, 2024, at Yale University.

<text>was an old province of Japan on Tsushima Island which occupied the area corresponding to modern-day Tsushima, Nagasaki. It was sometimes called .

==Political history==
The origin of Tsushima Province is unclear. 

It is often identified as the country mentioned in the Wajinden. 

It is possible that Tsushima was recognized as a province of the Yamato Court in the 5th century. Under the Ritsuryō system, Tsushima formally became a province.

Tsushima Province has been a strategic area that took a major role in the national defense against possible invasions from the continent and in trade with Korea. After Japan was defeated by Tang dynasty at the Battle of Baekgang in 663, Kaneda Castle was constructed on this island.

Tsushima Province had been controlled by the Tsushima no Kuni no miyatsuko until the Heian period. This clan was later replaced by the Abiru clan. The Sō clan rose to power around the middle 13th century and seized control of the entire island in the late 15th century. During the Edo period, Tsushima Province was dominated by the Tsushima-Fuchū Domain (Izuhara domain) of the So clan. It was put in charge of diplomacy and monopolized trade with the Joseon dynasty of Korea.

As a result of the abolition of the han system, the Tsushima Fuchu domain became Izuhara Prefecture in 1871. In the same year, Izuhara Prefecture was merged into Imari Prefecture, which was renamed Saga Prefecture in 1872. Tsushima was transferred to Nagasaki Prefecture in 1872. At the same time, the province continued to exist for some purposes. For example, Tsushima is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.

==Historical districts==
Throughout history, Tsushima Province consisted of two districts:
* Nagasaki Prefecture
** Kamiagata District (上県郡)
** Shimoagata District (下県郡)

The capital of Tsushima Province was located at Izuhara. In the modern local municipality system, they were divided into Kamiagata and Shimoagata Districts respectively, and were subsequently merged into the city of Tsushima today.

<text>Rupert or Ruppert is an English truncation of Latin &quot;Rupertus&quot;, which derives from Old High German &quot;Hruodoperht/Hruodoberht&quot; (&#x27;p&#x27; and &#x27;b&#x27; are the voiceless and voiced cognates of the same consonant); which is also the source of the name Robert. Thus, &quot;Rupert&quot; and &quot;Robert&quot; are different modern forms of the same name. The Old High German form of the name evolved from Germanic Hrothi, &quot;fame, glory, renown, honour, godlike&quot; + Berht, &quot;bright&quot;; thus, Rupert and Robert mean &quot;fame bright&quot;.

<text>Freedom of peaceful assembly, sometimes used interchangeably with the freedom of association, is the individual right or ability of people to come together and collectively express, promote, pursue, and defend their collective or shared ideas. The right to freedom of association is recognized as a human right, a political right and a civil liberty.

The terms &quot;freedom of assembly&quot; and &quot;freedom of association&quot; may be used to distinguish between the freedom to assemble in public places and the freedom to join an association. Freedom of assembly is often used in the context of the right to protest, while freedom of association is used in the context of labor rights. The Constitution of the United States is interpreted to mean both the freedom to assemble and the freedom to join an association.

==Human rights instruments==
Freedom of assembly is included in, among others, the following human rights instruments:
* Universal Declaration of Human Rights – Article 20
* International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – Article 21
* European Convention on Human Rights – Article 11
* American Convention on Human Rights – Article 15

National and regional constitutions that recognize freedom of assembly include:

<doc id="333996" wikidata="Q1897429" url="?curid=333996" title="Ultrametric space">
<text>In mathematics, an ultrametric space is a metric space in which the triangle inequality is strengthened to formula_1 for all formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4. Sometimes the associated metric is also called a non-Archimedean metric or super-metric.

== Formal definition ==

An ultrametric on a set is a real-valued function
:formula_5
(where denote the real numbers), such that for all :
# (&quot;symmetry&quot;);
# if then ;
# } (strong triangle inequality or ultrametric inequality).

An ultrametric space is a pair consisting of a set together with an ultrametric on , which is called the space&#x27;s associated distance function (also called a metric). 

If satisfies all of the conditions except possibly condition 4 then is called an ultrapseudometric on . An ultrapseudometric space is a pair consisting of a set and an ultrapseudometric on . 

In the case when is an Abelian group (written additively) and is generated by a length function formula_6 (so that formula_7), the last property can be made stronger using the Krull sharpening to:
: formula_8 with equality if formula_9.

We want to prove that if formula_10, then the equality occurs if formula_9. Without loss of generality, let us assume that formula_12 This implies that formula_13. But we can also compute formula_14. Now, the value of formula_15 cannot be formula_16, for if that is the case, we have formula_17 contrary to the initial assumption. Thus, formula_18, and formula_19. Using the initial inequality, we have formula_20 and therefore formula_21.

== Properties ==

From the above definition, one can conclude several typical properties of ultrametrics. For example, for all formula_22, at least one of the three equalities formula_23 or formula_24 or formula_25 holds. That is, every triple of points in the space forms an isosceles triangle, so the whole space is an isosceles set.

Defining the (open) ball of radius formula_26 centred at formula_27 as formula_28, we have the following properties:
* Every point inside a ball is its center, i.e. if formula_29 then formula_30.
* Intersecting balls are contained in each other, i.e. if formula_31 is non-empty then either formula_32 or formula_33.
* All balls of strictly positive radius are both open and closed sets in the induced topology. That is, open balls are also closed, and closed balls (replace formula_34 with formula_35) are also open.
* The set of all open balls with radius formula_36 and center in a closed ball of radius formula_37 forms a partition of the latter, and the mutual distance of two distinct open balls is (greater or) equal to formula_36.

Proving these statements is an instructive exercise. All directly derive from the ultrametric triangle inequality. Note that, by the second statement, a ball may have several center points that have non-zero distance. The intuition behind such seemingly strange effects is that, due to the strong triangle inequality, distances in ultrametrics do not add up.

== Examples ==

* The discrete metric is an ultrametric.
* The &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers form a complete ultrametric space.
* Consider the set of words of arbitrary length (finite or infinite), Σ*, over some alphabet Σ. Define the distance between two different words to be 2−&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the first place at which the words differ. The resulting metric is an ultrametric.
* The set of words with glued ends of the length &quot;n&quot; over some alphabet Σ is an ultrametric space with respect to the &quot;p&quot;-close distance. Two words &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are &quot;p&quot;-close if any substring of &quot;p&quot; consecutive letters (&quot;p&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;) appears the same number of times (which could also be zero) both in &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.
* If &quot;r&quot; = (&quot;rn&quot;) is a sequence of real numbers decreasing to zero, then |&quot;x&quot;|&quot;r&quot; := lim sup&quot;n&quot;→∞ |&quot;xn&quot;|&quot;rn&quot; induces an ultrametric on the space of all complex sequences for which it is finite. (Note that this is not a seminorm since it lacks homogeneity — If the &quot;rn&quot; are allowed to be zero, one should use here the rather unusual convention that 00 = 0.)
* If &quot;G&quot; is an edge-weighted undirected graph, all edge weights are positive, and &quot;d&quot;(&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;) is the weight of the minimax path between &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; (that is, the largest weight of an edge, on a path chosen to minimize this largest weight), then the vertices of the graph, with distance measured by &quot;d&quot;, form an ultrametric space, and all finite ultrametric spaces may be represented in this way.

== Applications ==
* A contraction mapping may then be thought of as a way of approximating the final result of a computation (which can be guaranteed to exist by the Banach fixed-point theorem). Similar ideas can be found in domain theory. &quot;p&quot;-adic analysis makes heavy use of the ultrametric nature of the &quot;p&quot;-adic metric.
* In condensed matter physics, the self-averaging overlap between spins in the SK Model of spin glasses exhibits an ultrametric structure, with the solution given by the full replica symmetry breaking procedure first outlined by Giorgio Parisi and coworkers. Ultrametricity also appears in the theory of aperiodic solids.
* In taxonomy and phylogenetic tree construction, ultrametric distances are also utilized by the UPGMA and WPGMA methods. These algorithms require a constant-rate assumption and produce trees in which the distances from the root to every branch tip are equal. When DNA, RNA and protein data are analyzed, the ultrametricity assumption is called the molecular clock.
* Models of intermittency in three dimensional turbulence of fluids make use of so-called cascades, and in discrete models of dyadic cascades, which have an ultrametric structure.
* In geography and landscape ecology, ultrametric distances have been applied to measure landscape complexity and to assess the extent to which one landscape function is more important than another.

<text>Vocalion Records is an American record label, originally founded by the Aeolian Company, a piano and organ manufacturer before being bought out by Brunswick in 1924.

==History==
The label was founded in 1916 by the Aeolian Company, a maker of pianos and organs, as Aeolian-Vocalion; the company also sold phonographs under the Vocalion name. &quot;Aeolian&quot; was later dropped from the label&#x27;s name. In late 1924, the label was acquired by Brunswick Records. During the 1920s, Vocalion also began the 1000 race series, records recorded by and marketed to African Americans. Jim Jackson recorded &quot;Jim Jackson&#x27;s Kansas City Blues&quot; for Vocalion in 1927. It sold exceptionally well, and the song became a blues standard for musicians from Memphis and Mississippi. The label issued Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Cross Road Blues&quot;
Vocalion was one of the most popular labels in the late 1930s. However, Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) bought American Record Corporation (which operated the Vocalion label) in 1938, and in July 1940 they discontinued Vocalion, replacing it with the Okeh label.

The City of London Phonograph &amp; Gramophone Society CLPGS published a comprehensive database of British and Australian Vocalion records, including Broadcast, World Records and other labels used by the company in the 1920s and 1930s.

===Mid-20th century resurrection===
The name Vocalion was resurrected in the late 1950s by American Decca as a budget label for back-catalog reissues. This incarnation of Vocalion ceased operations in 1973; however, its replacement as MCA&#x27;s budget imprint, Coral Records, kept many Vocalion titles in print. In 1975, MCA reissued five albums on the Vocalion label.

<doc id="334010" wikidata="Q655029" url="?curid=334010" title="International Brotherhood of Teamsters">
<text>The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) is a labor union in the United States and Canada. Formed in 1903 by the merger of the Team Drivers International Union and the Teamsters National Union, the union now represents a diverse membership of blue- and white-collar workers in both the public and private sectors, totalling about 1.3 million members in 2015. The union was formerly called the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America.

==History==
===Early history===
The American Federation of Labor (AFL) had helped form local unions of teamsters since 1887. In November 1898, the AFL organized the Team Drivers&#x27; International Union (TDIU). In 1901, a group of teamsters in Chicago, Illinois, broke from the TDIU and formed the Teamsters National Union. Unlike the TDIU, which permitted large employers to be members, the new Teamsters National Union permitted only employees, teamster helpers, and owner-operators owning only a single team to join, and advocated higher wages and shorter hours more aggressively than the TDIU. Claiming more than 28,000 members in 47 locals, its president, Albert Young, applied for membership in the AFL. The AFL asked the TDIU to merge with Young&#x27;s union to form a new, AFL-affiliated union and the two groups did so in 1903, forming the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), and electing Cornelius Shea as the new union&#x27;s first president. The election process proved tumultuous. Shea effectively controlled the convention because the Chicago locals—representing nearly half the IBT&#x27;s membership—supported his candidacy &quot;en bloc&quot;. Shea was opposed by John Sheridan, president of the Ice Drivers&#x27; Union of Chicago. Sheridan and George Innes, president of the TDIU, accused Shea of embezzlement in an attempt to prevent his election. Shea won the election on August 8, 1903, by a vote of 605 to 480. The new grouping elected Edward L. Turley of Chicago as secretary-treasurer and Albert Young as general organizer.

The union, like most unions within the AFL at the time, had a largely decentralized structure, with a number of local unions that governed themselves autonomously and tended to look only after their own interests in the geographical jurisdiction in which they operated.
The teamsters were vitally important to the labor movement, for a strike or sympathy strike by the teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood. It also meant that teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes in order to avoid strikes, and control of a teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues. During Shea&#x27;s presidency, the entire teamsters union was notoriously corrupt.

Several major strikes occupied the union in its first three years. In November 1903, teamsters employed by the Chicago City Railway went out on strike. Shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other teamster locals, but three locals walked out and eventually disaffiliated over the sympathy-strike issue. A sympathy strike in support of 18,000 striking meat cutters in Chicago in July 1904 led to riots before the extensive use of strikebreakers led Shea to force his members back to work (leading to the collapse of the meat cutters&#x27; strike). In the midst of the strife in 1904, the teamsters convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, re-elected Shea by acclamation on August 8, 1904. Under his leadership, the union had expanded to nearly 50,000 members in 821 locals in 300 cities, making the Teamsters one of the largest unions in the United States.

In 1905, 10,000 teamsters struck in support of locked-out tailors at Montgomery Ward, and eventually more than 25,000 teamsters manned the picket lines.
But when local newspapers discovered that Shea was living in a local brothel, kept a 19-year-old waitress as a mistress, and had spent the strike hosting parties, public support for the strike collapsed, and the strike ended on August 1, 1905. Despite the revelations, Shea won re-election on August 12, 1905, by a vote of 129 to 121.

Shea was re-elected again in 1905 and 1906, although significant challenges to his presidency occurred each time. Shea&#x27;s first trial on charges stemming from the 1905 Montgomery Ward strike ended in a mistrial. However, during the 1906 re-election Shea had promised that he would resign the presidency once his trial had ended. But he did not, and most union members withdrew their support for him. Daniel J. Tobin of Boston was elected Shea&#x27;s successor by a vote of 104 to 94 in August 1907.

===Organizing and growth during the Great Depression===
Tobin was president of the Teamsters from 1907 to 1952. Although he faced opposition in his re-election races in 1908, 1909 and 1910, he never faced opposition again until his retirement in 1952.

The Teamsters began to expand dramatically and mature organizationally under Tobin. He pushed for the development of &quot;joint councils&quot; to which all local unions were forced to affiliate. Varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction, the joint councils became important incubators for up-and-coming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry. Tobin also actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts, and founded and edited the union magazine, the &quot;International Teamster.&quot; Under Tobin, the Teamsters also first developed the &quot;regional conference&quot; system (developed by Dave Beck in Seattle), which provided stability, organizing strength, and leadership to the international union.

Tobin undertook long jurisdictional battles with many unions during this period. Fierce disputes occurred between the Teamsters and the Gasoline State Operators&#x27; National Council (an AFL federal union of gas station attendants), the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association, the Retail Clerks International Union, and the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks. The most significant disagreement, however, was with the United Brewery Workers over the right to represent beer wagon drivers. While the Teamsters lost this battle in 1913, when the AFL awarded jurisdiction to the Brewers, they won when the issue came before the AFL Executive Board again in 1933, when the Brewers were still recovering from their near-elimination during Prohibition. The raids and new member organizing in the 1930s led to significant membership increases. Teamster membership stood at just 82,000 in 1932. Tobin took advantage of the wave of pro-union sentiment engendered by the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act, and by 1935 union membership had increased nearly 65 percent to 135,000. By 1941, Tobin had a dues-paying membership of 530,000—making the Teamsters the fastest-growing labor union in the United States.

One of the most significant events in union history occurred in 1934. A group of radicals in Local 574 in Minneapolis—led by Farrell Dobbs, Carl Skoglund, and the Dunne brothers (Ray, Miles and Grant), all members of the Trotskyist Communist League of America—began successfully organizing coal truck drivers in the winter of 1933. Tobin, an ardent anti-communist, opposed their efforts and refused to support their 1933 strike. Local 574 struck again in 1934, leading to several riots over a nine-day period in May. When the employers&#x27; association reneged on the agreement, Local 574 resumed the strike, although it ended again after nine days when martial law was declared by Governor Floyd B. Olson. Although Local 574 won a contract recognizing the union and which broke the back of the anti-union Citizens Alliance in Minneapolis, Tobin expelled Local 574 from the Teamsters. Member outrage was extensive, and in August 1936 he was forced to recharter the local as 544. Within a year the newly formed Local 544 had organized 250,000 truckers in the Midwest and formed the Central Conference of Teamsters.

Extensive organizing also occurred in the West. Harry Bridges, radical leader of the International Longshoremen&#x27;s and Warehousemen&#x27;s Union (ILWU), was leading &quot;the march inland&quot;—an attempt to organize warehouse workers away from shipping ports. Alarmed by Bridges&#x27;s radical politics and worried that the ILWU would encroach on Teamster jurisdictions, Dave Beck formed a large regional organization (the Western Conference of Teamsters) to engage in fierce organizing battles and membership raids against the ILWU which led to the establishment of many new locals and the organization of tens of thousands of new members.

But corruption became even more widespread in the Teamsters during the Tobin administration. By 1941, the union was considered the most corrupt in the United States, and the most abusive towards its own members. Tobin vigorously defended the union against such accusations, but also instituted many constitutional and organizational changes and practices which made it easier for union officials to engage in criminal offenses.

===World War II and the post-war period===
By the beginning of World War II, the Teamsters was one of the most powerful unions in the country, and Teamster leaders were influential in the corridors of power. Union membership had risen more than 390 percent between 1935 and 1941 to 530,000. In June 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Tobin to be the official White House liaison to organized labor, and later that year chair of the Labor Division of the Democratic National Committee. In 1942, President Roosevelt appointed Tobin special representative to the United Kingdom and charged him with investigating the state of the labor movement there. Tobin was considered three times for Secretary of Labor, and twice refused the post—in 1943 and 1947. On September 23, 1944, Roosevelt gave his famous &quot;Fala speech&quot; while campaigning in the 1944 presidential election. Because of Roosevelt&#x27;s strong relationship with Tobin and the union&#x27;s large membership, the President delivered his speech before the Teamster convention.

Nonetheless, Teamsters members were restive. Dissident members of the union accused the leadership of suppressing democracy in the union, a charge Tobin angrily denied. Over the next year, Tobin cracked down on dissidents and several large locals led by his political opponents.

During World War II, The Teamsters strongly endorsed the American labor movement&#x27;s no-strike pledge. The Teamsters agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike for the duration of the national emergency. Tobin even ordered Teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions. Nevertheless, the national leadership sanctioned strikes by Midwestern truckers in August 1942, Southern truckers in October 1943, and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in January 1945. The Teamsters did not, however, participate in the great post-war wave of labor strikes. In the two years following the cessation of hostilities, the Teamsters struck only three times: 10,000 truckers in New Jersey struck for two weeks; workers at UPS struck nationwide for three weeks; and workers at Railway Express Agency struck for almost a month.

Teamsters leaders strongly opposed enactment of the Taft–Hartley Act and repeatedly called for its repeal. Tobin, however, was one of the first labor leaders to sign the non-communist affidavit required by the law.

The great wave of organizing in which the union engaged during the Great Depression and the war years significantly boosted the political power of a number of regional Teamsters leaders, and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the post-war period. By 1949, the union&#x27;s membership had topped one million. Dave Beck (elected an international vice-president in 1940) was increasingly influential in the international union, and Tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed. In 1946, Beck successfully overcame Tobin&#x27;s opposition and won approval of an amendment to the union&#x27;s constitution creating the post of executive vice-president. Beck then won the 1947 election to fill the position. Beck also successfully opposed in 1947 a Tobin-backed dues increase to fund new organizing. The following year, Beck was able to demand the ouster of the editor of &quot;International Teamster&quot; magazine and install his own man in the job.

In 1948, Beck allied with his long-time rival Jimmy Hoffa and effectively seized control of the union. He announced a raid on the International Association of Machinists local at Boeing. Although Tobin publicly repudiated Beck&#x27;s actions, Beck had more than enough support from Hoffa and other members of the executive board to force Tobin to back down. Five months later, Beck won approval of a plan to dissolve the union&#x27;s four divisions and replace them with 16 divisions organized around each of the major job categories in the union&#x27;s membership. In 1951, Tom Hickey, reformist leader of the Teamsters in New York City, won election to the Teamsters executive board. Tobin needed Beck&#x27;s support to prevent Hickey&#x27;s election, and Beck refused to give it.

On September 4, 1952, Tobin announced he would step down as president of the Teamsters at the end of his term. At the union&#x27;s 1952 convention, Beck was elected General President and pushed through a number of changes intended to make it harder for a challenger to build the necessary majority to unseat a president or reject his policies.

===Influence of organized crime===
Beck was elected to the Executive Council of the AFL on August 13, 1953, but his election generated a tremendous political battle between AFL President George Meany, who supported his election, and federation vice presidents who felt Beck was corrupt and should not be elected to the post. Beck was the first Teamster president to negotiate a nationwide master contract and a national grievance arbitration plan, established organizing drives in the Deep South and the East, and built the current Teamsters headquarters (the &quot;Marble Palace&quot;) in Washington, D.C., on Louisiana Avenue NW (across a small plaza from the United States Senate). But his intervention in a construction and a milk strike (both centered in New York City), and refusal to intervene in a Northeastern trucking strike created major political problems for him. Perceiving Beck to be weak, Jimmy Hoffa began challenging Beck on various union decisions and policies in 1956 with an eye to unseating him as General President in the regularly scheduled union elections in 1957.

Infiltration by organized crime dominated the agenda of the Teamsters throughout the 1950s. The Teamsters had suffered from extensive corruption since its formation in 1903. Although the more extreme, public forms of corruption had been eliminated after General President Cornelius Shea was removed from office, the extent of corruption and control by organized crime increased during Tobin&#x27;s time in office (1907 to 1952). In 1929, the Teamsters and unions in Chicago even approached gangster Roger Touhy and asked for his protection from Al Capone and his Chicago Outfit, which were seeking to control the area&#x27;s unions. Evidence of widespread corruption within the Teamsters began emerging shortly after Tobin retired. In Kansas City, corrupt Teamsters locals spent years seeking bribes, embezzling money, and engaging in extensive extortion and labor rackets as well as beatings, vandalism and even bombings in an attempt to control the construction and trucking industries. The problem was so serious that the U.S. House of Representatives held hearings on the issue.

Hoffa&#x27;s attempt to challenge Beck caused a major national scandal which led to two Congressional investigations, several indictments for fraud and other crimes against Beck and Hoffa, strict new federal legislation and regulations regarding labor unions, and even helped launch the political career of Robert F. Kennedy. Believing he needed additional votes to unseat Beck, in October 1956 Hoffa met with mobster Johnny Dio in New York City and the two men conspired to create as many as 15 paper locals to boost Hoffa&#x27;s delegate totals. When the paper locals applied for charters from the international union, Hoffa&#x27;s political foes were outraged. A major battle broke out within the Teamsters over whether to charter the locals, and the media attention led to inquiries by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations. Beck and other Teamster leaders challenged the authority of the U.S. Senate to investigate the union, which caused the Senate to establish the Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management—a new committee with broad subpoena and investigative powers. Senator John L. McClellan, chair of the select committee, hired Robert F. Kennedy as the subcommittee&#x27;s chief counsel and investigator.

The Select Committee (also known as the McClellan Committee, after its chairman), exposed widespread corruption in the Teamsters union. Dave Beck fled the country for a month to avoid its subpoenas before returning. Four of the paper locals were dissolved to avoid committee scrutiny, several Teamster staffers were charged with contempt of Congress, and union records were lost or destroyed (allegedly on purpose), and wiretaps were played in public before a national television audience in which Dio and Hoffa discussed the creation of even more paper locals. Evidence was unearthed of a mob-sponsored plot in which Oregon Teamsters unions would seize control of the state legislature, state police, and state attorney general&#x27;s office through bribery, extortion and blackmail. Initially, members of the union did not believe the charges, and support for Beck was strong, but after three months of continuous allegations of wrongdoing many rank-and-file Teamsters withdrew their support and openly called for Beck to resign. Beck initially refused to address the allegations, but broke his silence and denounced the committee&#x27;s inquiry on March 6. But even as the committee conducted its investigation, the Teamsters chartered even more paper locals. In mid-March 1957, Jimmy Hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe a Senate aide. Hoffa denied the charges, but the arrest triggered additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks. A week later, Beck admitted to receiving an interest-free $300,000 loan from the Teamsters which he had never repaid, and Senate investigators claimed that loans to Beck and other union officials (and their businesses) had cost the union more than $700,000. Beck appeared before the select committee for the first time on March 25, 1957, and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 117 times. The McClellan Committee turned its focus to Hoffa and other Teamsters officials, and presented testimony and evidence alleging widespread corruption in Hoffa-controlled Teamster units.

Several historic legal developments came out of the select committee&#x27;s investigation. The scandals uncovered by the McClellan committee, which affected not only the Teamsters but several other unions, led directly to the passage of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act) in 1959. The right of union officials to exercise their Fifth Amendment rights was upheld, and a significant refinement of constitutional law made, when the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed the right of union officials not to divulge the location of union records in &quot;Curcio v. United States&quot;, 354 U.S. 118 (1957).

Rank-and-file anger over the McClellan Committee&#x27;s revelations eventually led Beck to retire from the Teamsters, which allowed Jimmy Hoffa to take over. Immediately after his testimony in late March 1957, Beck won approval from the union&#x27;s executive board to establish a $1 million fund to defend himself and the union from the committee&#x27;s allegations. But member outrage at the expenditure was significant, and permission to establish the fund was rescinded. Member anger continued to grow throughout the spring, and Beck&#x27;s majority support on the executive board vanished. Beck was called before the McClellan Committee again in early May 1957, and additional interest-free loans and other potentially illegal and unethical financial transactions exposed. Based on these revelations, Beck was indicted for tax evasion on May 2, 1957.

Beck&#x27;s legal troubles led him to retire and Hoffa to win election to the union presidency. Support for Beck among the membership evaporated. Beck announced on May 25 he would not run for re-election in October. The announcement created chaos among the union leadership, and despite additional indictments Hoffa announced he would seek the presidency on July 19. Rank-and-file support for Hoffa was strong, although there were some attempts to organize an opposition candidate. Hoffa&#x27;s opponents asked a federal judge to postpone the election, but the request was granted only temporarily and Hoffa was elected General President of the union on October 4, 1957. Beck offered to retire early to allow Hoffa to take control of the union in December. A federal district court barred Hoffa from taking power unless he was acquitted in his wiretapping trial. The ruling was upheld by a court of appeals, and the trial ended in a hung jury on December 19, 1957. Hoffa assumed the presidency on February 1, 1958.

The worsening corruption scandal led the AFL–CIO to eject the Teamsters. AFL–CIO President George Meany, worried that corruption scandals plaguing a number of unions at the time might lead to harsh regulation of unions or even the withdrawal of federal labor law protection, began an anti-corruption drive in April 1956. New rules were enacted by the labor federation&#x27;s executive council that provided for the removal of vice presidents engaged in corruption as well as the ejection of unions considered corrupt. The McClellan Committee&#x27;s investigation only worsened the dispute between the AFL–CIO and the Teamsters. In January 1957, the AFL–CIO proposed a new rule which would bar officers of the federation from continuing to hold office if they exercised their Fifth Amendment rights in a corruption investigation. Beck opposed the new rule, but the Ethical Practices Committee of AFL–CIO instituted the rule on January 31, 1957. The Teamsters were given 90 days to reform, but Beck retaliated by promising more raids on AFL–CIO member unions if the union was ousted. Beck&#x27;s opposition prompted a successful move by Meany to remove Beck from the AFL–CIO executive council on the grounds of corruption. After extensive hearings and appeals which lasted from July to September 1957, the AFL–CIO voted on September 25, 1957, to eject the Teamsters if the union did not institute reforms within 30 days. Beck refused to institute any reforms, and the election of Jimmy Hoffa (whom the AFL–CIO considered as corrupt as Beck) led the labor federation to suspend the Teamsters union on October 24, 1957. Meany offered to keep the Teamsters within the AFL–CIO if Hoffa resigned as president, but Hoffa refused and the formal expulsion occurred on December 6, 1957.

The Teamsters were not the only corrupt union in the AFL–CIO by any means. Another was the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association (ILA), which represented stevedores in most East Coast ports. The Teamsters had long desired to bring all shipping and transportation workers into the union, so that no product could be moved anywhere in the United States without it being touched by Teamsters hands. As the ILA came under increasing attack for permitting corruption in its locals, Beck sought to bring the ILA into the Teamsters. The AFL ousted the ILA in September 1953, and formed the International Brotherhood of Longshoremen-AFL (IBL-AFL) to represent longshoremen on the Great Lakes and East Coast. The Teamsters planned to raid the expelled union, and may even have hoped to seize control of the IBL-AFL. Beck undertook a campaign to bring the ILA back into the AFL in early 1955, but the election of mob associate Anthony &quot;Tough Tony&quot; Anastasio as an ILA vice president forced Beck to end the effort. But even as Beck backed away from any ILA deal, Jimmy Hoffa secretly negotiated a major package of financial and staff aid to the ILA and then went public with the deal—forcing Beck to accept it as a fait accompli or risk embarrassing Hoffa. The AFL–CIO threatened to expel the Teamsters if it aided the ILA. Beck fought Hoffa over the ILA aid package and won, withdrawing the offer to the ILA in the spring of 1956.

The ILA was not the only union the Teamsters sought to merge with. The union attempted to merge with the Mine, Mill &amp; Smelter Workers in 1955, but the effort failed. The union also sought a merger with the Brewery Workers, but the smaller union rejected the offer. When the overture failed, the Teamsters raided the Brewery Workers, leading to fierce protests by the CIO.

Raiding by the Teamsters was such a serious issue that it prompted the AFL and CIO, which had attempted to sign a no-raid agreement for years, to finally negotiate and implement such a pact in December 1953. Beck initially refused to sign the agreement, and threatened to take the Teamsters out of the AFL if forced to adhere to it. Three months after the pact was signed, the Teamsters agreed to submit to the terms of the no-raid agreement. Shortly thereafter, the AFL adopted Article 20 of its constitution, which prevented its member unions from raiding one another. The union&#x27;s affection for raiding led it to initially oppose the AFL–CIO merger in January 1955, but it quickly reversed itself.

===Rise, fall, and disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa===
Hoffa achieved his goal of unifying all freight drivers under a single collective bargaining agreement, the National Master Freight Agreement, in 1964. Hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement, which authorized selective strikes against particular employers, to police the agreement or, if Hoffa thought that it served the union&#x27;s interest, to drive marginal employers out of the industry. The union won substantial gains for its members, fostering a nostalgic image of the Hoffa era as the golden age for Teamster drivers. Hoffa also succeeded where Tobin had failed, concentrating power at the international level, dominating the conferences which Beck and Dobbs had helped build.

In addition, Hoffa was instrumental in using the assets of the Teamsters&#x27; pension plans, particularly the Central States plan, to support Mafia projects, such as the development of Las Vegas in the 1950s and 1960s. Pension funds were loaned to finance Las Vegas casinos such as the Stardust Resort &amp; Casino, the Fremont Hotel &amp; Casino, the Desert Inn, the Dunes hotel and casino (which was controlled by Hoffa&#x27;s attorney, Morris Shenker), the Four Queens, the Aladdin Hotel &amp; Casino, Circus Circus, and Caesars Palace. The pension fund also made a number of loans to associates and relatives of high-ranking Teamster officials. A close associate of Hoffa during this period was Allen Dorfman. Dorfman owned an insurance agency that provided insurance claims processing to the Teamsters&#x27; union, and which was the subject of an investigation by the McClellan Committee. Dorfman also had increasing influence over loans made by the Teamsters&#x27; pension fund, and after Hoffa went to prison in 1967, Dorfman had primary control over the fund. Dorfman was murdered in January 1983, shortly after his conviction, along with Teamsters&#x27; president Roy Lee Williams, in a bribery case.

Hoffa was moreover defiantly unwilling to reform the union or limit his own power in response to the attacks from Robert F. Kennedy, formerly chief counsel to the McClellan Committee, and later Attorney General. Kennedy&#x27;s Department of Justice tried to convict Hoffa for a variety of offenses during the 1960s, finally succeeding on a witness tampering charge in 1964, with key testimony provided by Teamsters business agent Edward Grady Partin. After exhausting his appeals, Hoffa entered prison in 1967.

Hoffa installed Frank Fitzsimmons, an associate from his days in Local 299 in Detroit, to hold his place for him while he served time. Fitzsimmons, however, began to enjoy the exercise of power in Hoffa&#x27;s absence; in addition, the organized crime figures around him found that he was more pliant than Hoffa had been. While President Nixon&#x27;s pardon barred Hoffa from resuming any role in the Teamsters until 1980, Hoffa challenged the legality of that condition and planned to run again for presidency of the union, but disappeared in 1975 under mysterious circumstances. He is presumed dead, although his body has never been found.

===Decentralization, deregulation and drift===
Under General President Frank Fitzsimmons, authority within the Teamsters was decentralized back into the hands of regional, joint council, and local leaders. While this helped solidify Fitzsimmons&#x27;s own political position in the union, it also made it more difficult for the union to act decisively on policy issues. Fitzsimmons also slowly moved the union&#x27;s political stances to the left, supporting universal health care, an immediate end to the Vietnam War, urban renewal, and community organizing. In 1968, Fitzsimmons and United Auto Workers President Walter Reuther formed the Alliance for Labor Action, a new national trade union center which competed with the AFL–CIO. The Alliance dissolved in 1972 after Reuther&#x27;s death. While the Teamsters won rich national master contracts in trucking and package delivery in the 1970s, it did little to adapt to the changes occurring in the transportation industry.

A major jurisdictional battle with the United Farm Workers (UFW) broke out in 1970, and did not end until 1977. The Teamsters and UFW had both claimed jurisdiction over farm workers for many years, and in 1967 had signed an agreement settling their differences. But decentralization of power within the union led several Teamster leaders in California to repudiate this agreement without Fitzsimmons&#x27;s permission and organize large numbers of field workers. His hand forced, Fitzsimmons ordered Teamsters contract negotiators to re-open the handful of contracts it had signed with California growers. The UFW sued, the AFL–CIO condemned the action, and many employers negotiated contracts with the Teamsters rather than with the UFW. The Teamsters subsequently signed contracts (which many denounced as sweetheart deals) with more than 375 California growers. Although an agreement giving UFW jurisdiction over field workers and the Teamsters jurisdiction over packing and warehouse workers was reached on September 27, 1973, Fitzsimmons reneged on the agreement within a month and moved ahead with forming a farm workers regional union in California. The organizing battles even became violent at times. By 1975, the UFW had won 24 elections and the Teamsters 14; UFW membership had plummeted to just 6,000 from nearly 70,000 while the Teamsters farmworker division counted 55,000 workers. The UFW signed an agreement with Fitzsimmons in March 1977 in which the UFW agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act, while the Teamsters retained jurisdiction over some agricultural workers, who had been covered by Teamsters Local Union contracts prior to the formation of the UFW.

In October 1973, Fitzsimmons ended the long-running jurisdictional dispute with the United Brewery Workers, and the Brewery Workers merged with the Teamsters.

In 1979 Congress passed legislation that deregulated the freight industry, removing the Interstate Commerce Commission&#x27;s power to impose detailed regulatory tariffs on interstate carriers. The union tried to fight deregulation by attempting to bribe Senator Howard Cannon of Nevada. That attempt not only failed, but resulted in the conviction in 1982 of Roy Williams, the General President who had succeeded Fitzsimmons in 1981. Williams subsequently resigned in 1983 as a condition of remaining free on bail while his appeal proceeded.

Deregulation had catastrophic effects on the Teamsters, opening up the industry to competition from non-union companies who sought to cut costs by avoiding unionization and curbing wages. Nearly 200 unionized carriers went out of business in the first few years of deregulation, leaving thirty percent of Teamsters in the freight division unemployed. The remaining unionized carriers demanded concessions in wages, work rules, and hours.

Williams&#x27;s successor, Jackie Presser, was prepared to grant most of these concessions in the form of a special freight &quot;relief rider&quot; that would cut wages by up to 35 percent and establish two-tier wages. Teamsters for a Democratic Union, which had grown out of efforts to reject the 1976 freight agreement, launched a successful national campaign to defeat the relief rider, which was defeated by a vote of 94,086 to 13,082.

The pressure on the freight industry and the national freight agreement continued, however. By the end of the 1990s the National Master Freight Agreement, which had covered 500,000 drivers in the late 1970s, dropped to fewer than 200,000, with numerous local riders weakening it further in some areas.

===Internal and external challenges===
The decline in working conditions in the freight industry, combined with long-simmering unhappiness among members employed by the United Parcel Service, led to the development of two nationwide dissident groups within the union in the 1980s: Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), an assemblage of a number of local efforts, and the Professional Drivers Council, better known as PROD, which began as a public interest group affiliated with Ralph Nader that was concerned with worker safety. The two groups merged in 1979.

TDU was able to win some local offices within the union, although the International Union often attempted to make those victories meaningless by marginalizing the officer or the union. TDU acquired greater prominence, however, with the election reforms forced on the union by the consent decree it had entered into in 1989 on the eve of trial on a suit brought by the federal government under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).

The decree required the direct election of International officers by the membership, as TDU had been demanding for years leading up to the decree, to replace the indirect election by delegates at the union&#x27;s convention. While the delegates at the union&#x27;s 1991 convention balked at amending the Constitution, they ultimately capitulated under pressure from the government.

That consent decree might not have been possible, however, if it had not been for the testimony of Roy Williams, who described, in an affidavit he gave the government in return for a delay of his imprisonment, his own dealings with organized crime as the Secretary-Treasurer of a local union in Kansas City and as an officer of the International Union. The decree also gave the government the power to install an Independent Review Board with the power to expel any member of the union for &quot;conduct unbecoming to the union&quot;, which the IRB proceeded to exercise far more aggressively than the Teamsters officials who had agreed to the decree had expected.

While the government was pursuing a civil case against the union as an entity, it was also indicting Presser, who had succeeded Williams as General President, for embezzling from two different local unions in Cleveland prior to his election as president. Presser resigned in 1988, but died before his trial was scheduled to begin. He was succeeded by William J. McCarthy, who came from the same local that Dan Tobin had led eighty years earlier.

The Independent Review Board (IRB) is a three-member panel established to investigate and take appropriate action with respect to &quot;any allegations of corruption&quot;, &quot;any allegations of domination or control or influence&quot; of any part of the Union by organized crime, and any failure to cooperate fully with the IRB.

===Recent history===
In 1991, Ron Carey won a surprising victory in the first direct election for General President in the union&#x27;s history, defeating two &quot;old guard&quot; candidates, R.V. Durham and Walter Shea. Carey&#x27;s slate, supported by TDU, also won nearly all of the seats on the International Executive Board.

Carey acquired a fair amount of influence within the AFL–CIO, which had readmitted the Teamsters in 1985. Carey was close with the new leadership elected in 1995, particularly Richard Trumka of the United Mine Workers of America, who became Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL–CIO under John Sweeney. Carey had also swung the Teamsters support behind the Democratic Party, a change from past administrations that had supported the Republican Party. The new administration set out to break from the past in other ways, making energetic efforts to head off a vote to oust the union as representative of Northwest Airlines&#x27; flight attendants, negotiating a breakthrough agreement covering carhaulers, and supporting local strikes, such as the one against Diamond Walnut, to restore the union&#x27;s strength.

The Carey administration did not, on the other hand, have much power in the lower reaches of the Teamster hierarchy: all of the large regional conferences were run by &quot;old guard&quot; officers, as were most of the locals. Disagreements between those two camps led the old guard to campaign against the Carey administration&#x27;s proposed dues increase. The Carey administration retaliated by dissolving the regional conferences, calling them expensive redundancies and fiefdoms for old guard union officers, and rearranging the boundaries of some joint councils that had fought against the dues increase.

The opposition responded by uniting around a single candidate, James P. Hoffa, son of James R. Hoffa, to run against Carey in 1996. Hoffa ran a strong campaign, trading on the mystique still attached to his late father&#x27;s name and promising to restore those days of glory. Carey appeared, however, to have won a close election.

Shortly afterward in 1997, the union initiated a large and successful strike against UPS. The parcel services department had by that time become the largest division in the union.

Carey was removed from the union&#x27;s leadership by the IRB shortly thereafter, when evidence that individuals in his office had arranged for transfer of several thousand dollars to an outside contractor, which then arranged for another entity to make an equivalent contribution to the Carey campaign. Carey was indicted for lying to investigators about his campaign funding but was acquitted of all charges in a 2001 trial.

In the 1998 election to succeed Carey, James P. Hoffa was elected handily. He became president of the Teamsters on March 19, 1999, and took the union in a more moderate direction, tempering the union&#x27;s support for Democrats and attempting to come to terms with powerful Republicans in Congress.

The union has merged in recent years with a number of unions from other industries, including the Graphic Communications International Union, a printing industry union, and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, both from the railway industry.

On July 25, 2005, the Teamsters disaffiliated from the AFL–CIO and became a founding member of the new national trade union center, the Change to Win Federation.

In 2009, UPS, many employees of which are members of the Teamsters, lobbied to have language added to the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2009 (H.R. 915) to change how UPS and FedEx compete with one another. In response, FedEx launched a large, online advertising campaign aimed at UPS and the Teamsters, called &#x27;Stop the Brown Bailout&#x27;.

In September 2024, the Teamsters, which has endorsed Democratic presidential candidates since the 2000 election, decided not to endorse a candidate in the upcoming U.S. presidential election. This would mark the first time since 1996 that the union would not make an endorsement in a presidential election. The decision came after a poll of rank-and-file Teamsters members found that almost 60% supported Republican candidate Donald Trump to 34% supporting Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.

==Internal Teamsters politics==
Prior to the 1970s, no long-lived caucuses existed within the Teamsters Union. Challengers for office ran on their personal appeal and individual power base, rather than on caucus or &quot;party&quot; platforms and such challenges were infrequent. The Teamster leadership was well-established and somewhat self-perpetuating, and challengers only rarely achieved victories at the local and even less frequently at the regional levels. This changed in the 1970s. A national wildcat strike challenged President Frank Fitzsimmons&#x27;s control over the union, but failed. After the strike, a reform movement known as &quot;Teamsters United Rank and File&quot; (TURF) formed to continue to challenge against the union&#x27;s national leadership. But TURF collapsed after a few years due to internal dissent. In 1975, two new caucuses formed: Teamsters for a Decent Contract (TDC) and UPSurge. Both groups pushed the national leadership for vastly improved contracts at UPS and the freight lines.

In 1976 a new formal caucus, Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), formed when TDC and UPSurge merged. The new caucus&#x27;s goal was to make internal Teamster governance more transparent and democratic, which included giving rank-and-file more of a say in the terms and approval of contracts.

In the 1980s, TDU occasionally won elections for positions on local councils, but it was not until 1983—when the TDU forced President Jackie Presser to withdraw and make changes to a concession-laden National Master Freight Agreement—that TDU had a national impact. TDU publicized the very centralized and not very transparent national union decision-making process, criticized what it said was lack of member input into these decisions, and published contract, salary, membership, and other data critical of the national union leadership. These criticisms led to another success for TDU, with many TDU proposals finding their way into the 1988 court decree in which the federal government took over of the Teamsters. Although the TDU has never won the presidency of the national union as of mid-2013, it strongly supported Ron Carey for the presidency in 1991. Carey, in turn, adopted many of TDU&#x27;s reform proposals as part of his platform. Carey ran with nearly a full slate (which included a candidate for secretary-treasurer and 13 vice presidencies). R.V. Durham, leader of the Teamsters in North Carolina, was considered the &quot;establishment&quot; candidate and front-runner in the campaign (he had the backing of a majority of the union&#x27;s executive board). A second candidate in the race, Walter Shea, was a veteran union staffer from Washington, D.C. Carey won with 48.5 percent of the vote to Durham&#x27;s 33.2 percent and Shea&#x27;s 18.3 percent. (Turnout was low, only about 32 percent of the union&#x27;s total membership.) Carey&#x27;s election, sociologist Charlotte Ryan says, was another success for TDU (even though Carey was not a TDU candidate).

Carey won re-election in 1996 in a corrupt election, defeating James P. Hoffa (son of the former union president). Prior to entering the race, Hoffa formed a caucus of his own, the &quot;Hoffa Unity Slate&quot;, to counter the grassroots organizing of TDU and Carey. Carey was later ousted as union president by U.S. government officials. A re-run election in 1998 saw Hoffa and the Unity Slate easily defeat TDU candidate Tom Leedham 54.5 percent to 39.3 percent (with 28 percent turnout).

Hoffa was re-elected over Leedham (again running on the TDU platform) in 2001, 64.8 percent to 35.2 percent. Leedham challenged Hoffa and the Hoffa Unity Slate a third time in 2006, losing 65 percent to 35 percent (with 25 percent turnout). Hoffa faced TDU candidate Sandy Pope, a local union president, in 2011. Also running, with a full slate of officer and vice presidential candidates, was former Hoffa supporter and former national vice president Fred Gegare. Hoffa again easily won re-election, earning 60 percent of the vote to Gregare&#x27;s 23 percent and Pope&#x27;s 17 percent. The Hoffa Unity Slate also won all five regional vice presidencies, although the slate&#x27;s support declined across the board. Hoffa won reelection once more in 2016, this time against Teamsters United candidate Fred Zuckerman, but by a much narrower margin of 52 to 48 percent. The 2016 election was also the first time Hoffa-allied candidates lost regional vice presidencies to the Teamsters United reform slate.

In the 2021 election, Hoffa did not run for re-election. The Teamsters United slate, aligned with Teamsters for a Democratic Union, ran against the Teamsters Power Slate, endorsed by Hoffa. The Teamsters United slate, led by Sean O&#x27;Brien, won the election. O&#x27;Brien and his slate were sworn into office on March 22, 2022, at Teamsters headquarters in Washington, D.C. On the day his administration was installed, O&#x27;Brien fired more than 80 employees at the headquarters. He did not offer any severance or extension of benefits to the terminated staff. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters currently faces charges with the National Labor Relations Board in connection to the terminations. As of November 10, 2022, the union was required to pay eligible terminated employees more than $175,000 as part of a settlement with the District of Columbia Attorney General&#x27;s Office for violating D.C. Code 32-1303.

==Political involvement==

The Teamsters Union is one of the largest labor unions in the world, as well as the 11th largest campaign contributor in the United States. While it supported Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush for president in the 1980s, it has leaned largely toward the Democrats since the 1990s; the Teamsters have donated 92% of their $24,418,589 in contributions since 1990 to the Democratic Party. Though the union opposed former President George W. Bush&#x27;s agenda to open U.S. highways to Mexican truckers, it did previously support Bush&#x27;s platform for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

The Teamsters Union also makes an annual contribution to Friends of Sinn Féin — the U.S. fundraising arm of Irish republican party Sinn Féin.

On July 13, 2024, Teamsters president Sean M. O&#x27;Brien was announced as a headline speaker for the 2024 Republican National Convention. The organization requested to speak before the 2024 Democratic National Convention but says it was not invited to do so. On 18 September 2024, the organization announced that it would be endorsing neither of the two major party candidates of the 2024 presidential election: Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump. This marked the first election in nearly three decades in which the organization did not endorse a Democrat for president.

<doc id="334013" wikidata="Q3179558" url="?curid=334013" title="Tropical Storm Allison">
<text>Tropical Storm Allison was a tropical cyclone that devastated southeast Texas in June 2001. An arguable example of the &quot;brown ocean effect&quot;, Allison lasted unusually long for a June storm, remaining tropical and subtropical for 16 days, most of which was when the storm was over land dumping torrential rainfall. The storm developed from a tropical wave in the northern Gulf of Mexico on June 4, 2001, and struck the upper Texas coast shortly thereafter. It drifted northward through the state, turned back to the south, and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico. The storm continued to the east-northeast, made landfall on Louisiana, then moved across the southeast United States and Mid-Atlantic. Allison was the first storm since Tropical Storm Frances in 1998 to strike the northern Texas coastline.

The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at over in Texas. The worst flooding occurred in Houston, where most of Allison&#x27;s damage occurred: 30,000 became homeless after the storm flooded over 70,000 houses and destroyed 2,744 homes. Downtown Houston was inundated with flooding, causing severe damage to hospitals and businesses. Twenty-three people died in Texas. Along its entire path, Allison caused $9 billion (2001 USD, equivalent to $ in ) in damage and 41 deaths. Aside from Texas, the places worst hit were Louisiana and southeastern Pennsylvania.

Following the storm, President George W. Bush designated 75 counties along Allison&#x27;s path as disaster areas, which enabled the citizens affected to apply for aid. Then the fourth-costliest Atlantic tropical cyclone and still the costliest Atlantic tropical cyclone that was never a major hurricane, Allison was the first Atlantic tropical storm to have its name retired without ever having reached hurricane strength, and the only until Tropical Storm Erika in 2015.

== Meteorological history == 

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on May 21, 2001. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, retaining little convection on its way. After moving across South America and the southwestern Caribbean Sea, the wave entered the eastern North Pacific Ocean on June 1. A low-level circulation developed on June 2, while it was about south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. Southerly flow forced the system northward, and the wave moved inland on June 3. The low-level circulation dissipated, though the mid-level circulation persisted. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on June 4, and developed deep convection on its eastern side. Early on June 5, satellite imagery suggested that a tropical depression was forming in the northwest Gulf of Mexico, which was furthered by reports of wind gusts as high as just a few hundred feet above the surface, towards the east side of the system.
At 12:00 UTC on June 5, the disturbance developed a broad, low-level circulation, and was classified as Tropical Storm Allison, the first storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. Some intensification was projected, though it was expected to be hindered by cool offshore sea surface temperatures. Due to the cold-core nature of the center, Allison initially contained subtropical characteristics. Despite this, the storm quickly strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of , with tropical storm-force winds extending up to east of the center, and a minimum central pressure of . The storm initially moved very little, and the presence of several small vortices from within the deep convection caused difficulty in determining the exact center location. Later in the day, several different track forecasts arose. One scenario had the cyclone tracking westward into Mexico. Another projected the storm moving east towards southern Louisiana. At the time, it was noted that little rain or wind persisted near the center, but rather to the north and east. Under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge that extended in an east–west orientation across the southeast United States, Allison weakened while nearing the Texas coastline, and struck near Freeport, Texas with winds. Inland, the storm rapidly weakened, and the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on June 6. Shortly after being downgraded to a tropical depression, surface observations showed an elongated circulation with a poorly defined center, which had reformed closer to the deep convection.

The depression drifted northward until reaching Lufkin, Texas, where it stalled due to a high pressure system to its north. While stalling over Texas, the storm dropped excessive rainfall, peaking at just over in northwestern Jefferson County. On June 7, the subtropical ridge off Florida weakened, while the ridge west of Texas intensified. This steered Tropical Depression Allison to make a clockwise loop, and the storm began drifting to the southwest. As the center reached Huntsville, Texas, a heavy rain band began to back build from Louisiana westward into Liberty County, Texas, which had caused additional flooding. At the time, the system had a minimum central pressure of about and maximum sustained winds of about . Late on June 9 and early on June 10, Allison&#x27;s remnants reentered reached the Gulf of Mexico and emerged over open waters. The low once again became nearly stationary about south of Galveston, Texas, and despite more favorable upper-level winds, it showed no signs of redevelopment. Due to dry air and moderate westerly wind shear, the storm transformed into a subtropical cyclone. While the subtropical depression moved eastward, a new low level circulation redeveloped to the east, and Allison quickly made landfall on Morgan City, Louisiana on June 11. At around the same time, the surface center reformed to the east-northeast of its previous location, aligning with the mid-level circulation. Strong thunderstorms redeveloped over the circulation, and Allison strengthened into a subtropical storm over southeastern Louisiana. The storm intensified further to attain sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of about near Mclain, Mississippi, accompanied by a well-defined eye-like feature.

The storm was officially downgraded to a subtropical depression at 0000 UTC on June 12. Somewhat accelerating, the depression tracked to the east-northeast through Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina before becoming nearly stationary near Wilmington, North Carolina. The depression drifted through North Carolina and sped to the northeast for a time in response to an approaching cold front. Though satellite and radar imagery show the system was well-organized, the system slowed and moved erratically for a period of time, executing what appeared to be a small counterclockwise loop. The storm began tracking in a generally northeasterly direction, and crossed into the southern Delmarva Peninsula on June 16. The subtropical remnants reached the Atlantic on June 17, and while located east of Atlantic City, New Jersey, winds began to restrengthen, and heavy rains formed to the north of the circulation. The low was interacting with a frontal boundary, and started merging with it, as it accelerated to the northeast at . The remnants of Allison briefly reintensified to a subtropical storm through baroclinic processes, though it became extratropical while south of Long Island. By later on June 17, the low was situated off the coast of Rhode Island, spreading a swath of precipitation over New England. The remnants of the tropical storm were then absorbed by the frontal boundary by June 18, and eventually passed south of Cape Race, Newfoundland on June 20, where the extratropical cyclone dissipated.
==Preparations==
Shortly after the storm formed, officials in Galveston County, Texas issued a voluntary evacuation for the western end of Galveston Island, as the area was not protected by the Galveston Seawall. The ferry from the island to the Bolivar Peninsula was closed, while voluntary evacuations were issued in Surfside in Brazoria County. When the National Hurricane Center issued the first advisory on Allison, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings from Sargent, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana. After the storm made landfall, flash flood watches and warnings were issued for numerous areas in eastern Texas. During the flood event, the National Weather Service in Houston issued 99 flash flood warnings with an average lead time of 40 minutes. With an average lead time of 24 minutes, the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, Louisiana issued 47 flash flood warnings. With an average lead time of 39 minutes, the National Weather Service in New Orleans/Baton Rouge issued 87 flash flood warnings, of which 30 were not followed by a flash flood. 

In Tallahassee, Florida, a shelter opened the day before Allison&#x27;s movement northward through the area, seven staff members housing 12 people. Two other shelters were on standby. Teams informed citizens in the Florida Panhandle of flood dangers.

==Impact==

Tropical Storm Allison was a major flood disaster throughout its path from Texas to the Mid-Atlantic. The worst of the flooding occurred in Houston, Texas, where over of rain fell. Allison caused approximately $8.5 billion in damage (2001 USD), making it the costliest tropical cyclone that was never a major hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin. The storm also killed 41 people directly, including 27 who drowned. This ties Allison with a tropical storm in 1917 as the second-deadliest tropical storm to affect the contiguous United States, surpassed only by the 1925 Florida tropical storm which killed 73 people.

==Aftermath==
Within weeks of the disaster, President George W. Bush declared 75 counties in Texas, southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, northwestern Florida, and southeastern Pennsylvania as disaster areas. The declarations allowed affected citizens to receive aid for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, and other serious disaster-related expenses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also provided 75% for the cost of debris removal, emergency services related to the disaster, and repairing or replacing damaged public facilities, such as roads, bridges and utilities.
A few weeks after Allison, FEMA opened six disaster recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48 shelters at the peak of need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000 meals. After the extensive damage to Houston hospitals, the U. S. Public Health Service team set up a temporary hospital at the Houston Police Academy. The National Disaster Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500 people. The team of 87 medical personnel served over 1,000 patients within two weeks of Allison&#x27;s passage. Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses. After nearly 50,000 cars were flooded and ruined, many people attempted to sell the cars across the country without telling of the car&#x27;s history. Many people took advantage of the flood victims, including fraudulent contractors and suppliers raising the price of goods more than is actually justified. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. By six months after the storm, around 120,000 Texas citizens applied for federal disaster aid, totaling to $1.05 billion (2001 USD).

Like in Texas, a mosquito outbreak occurred in Louisiana. Only pesticides acceptable to the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Fish and Wildlife Service were allowed to be used. FEMA officials warned homeowners of the dangers of floodwaters, including mold, mildew, and bacteria. By three months after the storm, just under 100,000 Louisiana citizens applied for federal aid, totaling to over $110 million (2001 USD, $143 million 2012 USD). $25 million (2001 USD, $32 million 2012 USD) of the total was for business loans, while an additional $8 million was for public assistance for communities and state agencies. More than 750 flood victims in Florida applied for governmental aid, totaling to $1.29 million (2001 USD, $1.5 million 2007 USD). In Pennsylvania, 1,670 flood victims applied for federal aid, totaling to $11.5 million (2001 USD, $14.3 million 2012 USD). $3.4 million (2001 USD, $4.4 million 2012 USD) of the total was to replace a SEPTA rail bridge over Sandy Run in Fort Washington.

===Retirement===

Due to the severe damage and deaths caused by the storm, the name &quot;Allison&quot; was retired from future use in the Atlantic basin in the spring of 2002 by the World Meteorological Organization. The name was replaced with &quot;Andrea&quot; for the 2007 season. Tropical Storm Allison was the first Atlantic tropical storm to have its name retired without reaching hurricane strength.

<text>A forester is a person who practises forest management and forestry, the science, art, and profession of managing forests. Foresters engage in a broad range of activities including ecological restoration and management of protected areas. Foresters manage forests to provide a variety of objectives including direct extraction of raw material, outdoor recreation, conservation, hunting and aesthetics. Emerging management practices include managing forestlands for biodiversity, carbon sequestration and air quality.

Foresters work for the timber industry, government agencies, conservation groups, local authorities, urban parks boards, citizens&#x27; associations, and private landowners. The forestry profession includes a wide diversity of jobs, with educational requirements ranging from college bachelor&#x27;s degrees to PhDs for highly specialized work. 

Industrial foresters plan forest regeneration starting with careful harvesting. Urban foresters manage trees in urban green spaces. Foresters work in tree nurseries growing seedlings for woodland creation or regeneration projects. Foresters improve tree genetics. Forest engineers develop new building systems. Professional foresters measure and model the growth of forests with tools like geographic information systems. Foresters may combat insect infestation, disease, forest and grassland wildfire, but increasingly allow these natural aspects of forest ecosystems to run their course when the likelihood of epidemics or risk of life or property are low. Increasingly, foresters participate in wildlife conservation planning and watershed protection. Foresters have been mainly concerned with timber management, especially reforestation, forests at prime conditions, and fire control.

Many people confuse the role of the forester with that of the logger, but most foresters are concerned not only with the harvest of timber, but also with the sustainable management of forests. The forester Jack C. Westoby remarked that &quot;forestry is concerned not with trees, but with how trees can serve people&quot;.

== Career ==

===United States===

The median salary of foresters in the United States was $53,750, in 2008. Beginning foresters without bachelor&#x27;s degrees make considerably less. Those with master&#x27;s degrees are able to command salaries closer to the average. The Council for Higher Education Accreditation considers the Society of American Foresters as the principal accreditor for academic degree programs in professional forestry, both at a Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s level.

Usually a bachelor&#x27;s degree is considered the minimum education required, but some individuals are able to secure a job without a college education based on their experience. Some states have a licensing requirement for foresters, and most of those require at least a four-year degree.

Foresters are often employed by private industry, federal and state land management agencies, or private consulting firms.

==Medieval foresters==

Forester was a title used widely during Medieval times. The forester usually held a position equal to a sheriff or local law enforcer, and he could act as a barrister or arbiter. He was often based in a forester&#x27;s lodge, and was responsible for patrolling the woodlands on a lord or noble&#x27;s property, hence the synonymous term &#x27;woodward&#x27;. His duties included negotiating sales of lumber and timber and stopping poachers from illegally hunting. Frequently outlaws would take refuge in heavily wooded regions. When this occurred it was the duty of the forester to organize armed posses to capture or disperse the criminals and during war time foresters were used as scouts to spy on enemy troop movement.
The pay and status of foresters was usually above average, reflecting the responsibility of their role in a medieval environment and economy.

<text>Michael S. Medved (born October 3, 1948) is an American radio show host, author, political commentator, and film critic. His talk show, &quot;The Michael Medved Show&quot;, is syndicated from his home station KTTH in Seattle. It is available via Cable Radio Network’s channel CRN1. It was syndicated via Genesis Communications Network until GCN’s closure on May 5, 2024.

==Early life and education==
Michael Medved was born on October 3, 1948, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to parents Renate (née Hirsch) and David Bernard Medved. His father was a Navy veteran and scientist. Raised in a Jewish home, his family&#x27;s origin is German and Ukrainian. The surname Medved means &quot;bear&quot; in many Slavic languages. Medved was raised in San Diego, California, where his father worked as a defense contractor for Convair and NASA. After the family moved to Los Angeles, California, he attended Palisades High School. Medved entered Yale University as a 16-year-old undergraduate. He received his B.A. with honors in 1969, and later attended Yale Law School, though he did not finish his J.D. degree. Medved volunteered for the 1968 presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy, and was present at his assassination.

==Career==

===Writer===
After his first year of law school, Medved left to work as a head speechwriter for diplomat Joseph Duffey in his unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate, and then for four years as a speechwriter and political consultant. After political campaign work, including a position as an aide to Congressman Ron Dellums, Medved worked in advertising, and coordinated a campaign to recruit more African Americans and Hispanics to the police departments of San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley.

After writing more than 40 articles for the book &quot;The People&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, Medved wrote &quot;What Really Happened to the Class of &#x27;65?&quot;, with David Wallechinsky. Focusing on the post-graduation lives of 30 of Medved&#x27;s Palisades High School classmates who were featured in a 1965 cover story in &quot;Time&quot;, the book became a bestseller in 1976. The book also became the basis for a weekly television series on NBC that ran for 13 weeks in 1978. As a result of some screenwriting work for feature film projects and television miniseries, Medved joined the Writers Guild of America.

Medved wrote &quot;The Shadow Presidents: The Secret History of the Chief Executives and Their Top Aides&quot; (1979), a study of the leading White House assistants since the establishment of the presidential staff in 1857. The book included interviews with the chiefs of staff of presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford. After the interviews, Medved continued his involvement in politics, befriending Ford&#x27;s chief of staff, Dick Cheney, affiliating himself with the Republican Party, and campaigning for Ronald Reagan in 1980.
In 1984, Medved wrote &quot;Hospital: The Hidden Lives of a Medical Center Staff&quot;, which was discussed in &quot;Time&quot;, on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;, and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. The book focused on 30 staff people who worked together in a California teaching hospital. In collaboration with his brother, Harry Medved, he wrote four satirical books about movies: &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot; (1979), &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot; (1980), &quot;The Hollywood Hall of Shame&quot; (1984) and &quot;Son of Golden Turkey Awards&quot; (1986).

In November 2008, Medved released his eleventh nonfiction book, &quot;The 10 Big Lies About America: Combating Destructive Distortions About Our Nation&quot;. The follow-up volume, &quot;The 5 Big Lies About American Business: Combating Smears Against the Free-Market Economy&quot;, was released in December 2009.

===Film reviewer===
As a film reviewer, Medved hosted a weekly spot on CNN (1980–83) and a show on British Channel 4 network, &quot;The Worst of Hollywood&quot;. His commentary centered on what he considered bad movies, particularly in &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot;. The film selected by the Medved Brothers as The Worst Film of All Time, &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, has become a cult classic.

In 1984, Medved joined &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, the weekly movie review show originated by Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, co-hosting it for 12 years with Jeffrey Lyons.

In 1993, Medved became chief film critic for the &quot;New York Post&quot;, a position he held for five years, during which he reviewed more than 700 movies for the paper.

Afterward, Medved played a prominent role in some movie-related controversies. He became an outspoken defender of Mel Gibson&#x27;s film, &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004), which had been criticized as antisemitic by many prominent Jewish groups. After Gibson&#x27;s DUI arrest in July 2006, Medved wrote that he felt &quot;betrayed&quot; by Gibson&#x27;s antisemitic outburst and urged Gibson to seek &quot;reconciliation&quot; with the Jewish community.

Some film critics, including Roger Ebert and Jim Emerson, criticized Medved for mentioning the &quot;right to die/assisted suicide&quot; theme in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;Million Dollar Baby,&quot; viewing Medved&#x27;s statements as a plot spoiler. Medved said that the inclusion of this theme in the film was &quot;deeply misleading&quot; because it was marketed as a &quot;Rocky-&quot;esque tale of a plucky female underdog in the boxing arena. He said he carefully avoided revealing the final turn in the plot, but felt honor-bound to inform his listeners and readers about the movie&#x27;s content and point of view. Ebert criticized Medved, saying he &quot;has for a long time been a political commentator, not a movie critic.&quot;

===Talk radio and political commentary===
While focusing on the theme of &quot;Hollywood vs. America&quot;, radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh interviewed Medved and then asked him to guest-host his talk show. In 1996 Medved was offered his own local show on a major Seattle radio station. In his 2005 autobiographical book &quot;Right Turns: From Liberal Activist to Conservative Champion in 35 Unconventional Lessons&quot;, Medved says he welcomed the chance to speak to a wider audience about politics and morality, which were a focus of his written commentary and books. The show broadcast from Seattle and syndicated through Salem Radio Network.

His three-hour daily show was broadcast on 200 stations coast to coast and reached more than 4.75 million listeners weekly. For ten consecutive years, &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot; listed Medved as one of its &quot;Heavy Hundred&quot; most important American talk show hosts, and in 2011 tied for eighth place in its ranking of talk hosts by audience size. Salem Radio announced on November 8, 2018, that Sebastian Gorka would replace Medved&#x27;s time slot in 2019. Medved said that his show would continue in a &quot;new format&quot; at the same time (3–6p.m. Eastern Time). His show continues in that time slot on fewer stations, but as of 2022, Medved remains in the &quot;Talkers&quot; Heavy Hundred, at position 92.

Medved describes the show as &quot;Your Daily Dose of Debate&quot;, often focused on listeners who call in to debate issues with the host. Guests have included those who are generally considered left-of-center, including Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore, John Shelby Spong, Oliver Stone, Warren Beatty, Ralph Nader, Barbara Boxer, Al Gore, Madeleine Albright, Ben Cohen, George Galloway, Thom Hartmann, Naomi Wolf, and Al Franken. Guests who are generally considered right-of-center include Robert Spencer, Condoleezza Rice, and Dinesh D&#x27;Souza.

Medved describes himself as &quot;your cultural crusader on politics and pop culture&quot; and common themes on his show include current events, politics, American history and the entertainment industry. He reviews four or more new movies or DVD releases per week. The program also includes a weekly &quot;Disagreement Day&quot;, focusing on callers from around the country who wish to contest anything Medved has stated in his written articles or on the radio, and a monthly (when the moon is full) &quot;Conspiracy Day,&quot; where callers from across the country expose what they consider the &quot;hidden forces&quot; behind &quot;perplexing and painful present events.&quot; He gives historical perspective to current events on the radio show, and has recorded vignettes on major historical events and people in American history, such as the American Revolution and Abraham Lincoln.
Medved writes a regular column for &quot;USA Today&quot; and is a member of the Board of Contributors for &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Forum Page, part of the newspaper&#x27;s Opinion section. He writes occasional op-ed pieces for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and blogged daily at Townhall.com. He also wrote the 1992 book &quot;Hollywood vs. America: Popular Culture and the War on Traditional Values&quot;, a condemnation of violence in cinema.

Medved reportedly rearranged his schedule in 1993 &quot;so he can devote time to a run for Congress.&quot;
In October 2007, Medved drew fire from critics after publishing a controversial column regarding the history of slavery in the United States, in which he wrote, &quot;No, it&#x27;s not true that the &#x27;peculiar institution&#x27; featured kind-hearted, paternalistic masters and happy, dancing field-hands, any more than it&#x27;s true that America displayed unparalleled barbarity or enjoyed disproportionate benefit from kidnapping and exploiting innocent Africans.&quot;

He has argued that voters in the American Jewish community do not necessarily embrace candidates based on their support for the state of Israel as much as they passionately oppose candidates based on their identification with Christianity, especially the Christian Right. Medved also states that the Orthodox community, which he states as less than ten percent of the American Jewish population, &quot;gives nearly as disproportionate support to Republicans as their Reform, Conservative, and secular Jewish neighbors give to Democrats&quot; and argues that this is because &quot;The Orthodox feel no instinctive horror at political alliances with others who make faith the center of their lives.&quot;

Medved criticized Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign, taking a Never Trump stance. He continued to criticize Trump after the election.

==Personal life and religion==
Medved is married to Diane Elvenstar Medved; the couple have three children. Diane is a convert to Orthodox Judaism.

In 1991, Medved co-founded &quot;Toward Tradition&quot; in Washington state with Orthodox rabbi Daniel Lapin and lobbyist Jack Abramoff. In October 1994, it co-sponsored the conference &quot;Toward a New Alliance: American Jews and Political Conservatism&quot;, with 300 attendees, featuring panelists Grover Norquist (Americans for Tax Reform), Ralph Reed (Christian Coalition), William Kristol (editor, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;), and David Horowitz (Center for the Study of Popular Culture). Also with Lapin, Medved helped revitalize the Pacific Jewish Center, an Orthodox synagogue in Venice, California. For fifteen years, Medved served as president of PJC, which states that its mission is outreach to unaffiliated and disconnected Jews. In his book &quot;Right Turns: Unconventional Lessons from a Controversial Life&quot;, he states that his commitment to religion led to his conservative political outlook. He is a baal teshuva (returnee to Orthodox Judaism).

In November 2007, Medved became a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement.

On January 30, 2015, Medved announced during his live radio broadcast that he would take an indefinite leave of absence from the show to undergo treatment for throat cancer. He returned to the air on April 21.

Medved endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

<text>Occupational therapy (OT), also known as ergotherapy, is a healthcare profession. Ergotherapy is derived from the Greek which is allied to work, to act and to be active. Occupational therapy is based on the assumption that being active is a basic human need and that purposeful activity has a health-promoting and therapeutic effect. Occupational science the study of humans as &#x27;doers&#x27; or &#x27;occupational beings&#x27; was developed by inter-disciplinary scholars, including occupational therapists, in the 1980s.

The World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT) defines occupational therapy as ‘a client-centred health profession concerned with promoting health and wellbeing through occupation. The primary goal of occupational therapy is to enable people to participate in the activities of everyday life. Occupational therapists achieve this outcome by working with people and communities to enhance their ability to engage in the occupations they want to, need to, or are expected to do, or by modifying the occupation or the environment to better support their occupational engagement&quot;&#x27;.&quot; 

Many of the Member Organisations of WFOT have agreed a national definition of occupational therapy. In New Zealand occupational therapy is translated into Maori as &#x27;whakaora ngangahau&#x27;. &#x27;Whakaora&#x27; means ‘to restore to health&#x27; and &#x27;ngangahau&#x27; is an adjective meaning &#x27;active, spirited, zealous&#x27;.

Education programmes leading to entry to practice as an occupational therapist can be at diploma, baccalaureate, bachelors, masters or doctoral level. Information about entry level education programmes, currently or previously approved by WFOT, is available on the WFOT website

Occupational therapy is an allied health profession.  In England, allied health professions (AHPs) are the third largest clinical workforce in health and care. Fifteen professions, with 352,593 registrants are regulated by the Health and Care Professions Council in the United Kingdom. 

== Early history ==
The earliest evidence of using occupations as a method of therapy can be found in ancient times. In c. 100 BCE, Greek physician Asclepiades treated patients with a mental illness humanely using therapeutic baths, massage, exercise, and music. Later, the Roman Celsus prescribed music, travel, conversation and exercise to his patients. However, by medieval times the use of these interventions with people with mental illness was rare, if not nonexistent.

== Moral treatment and graded activity ==
In late 18th-century Europe, doctors such as Philippe Pinel and Johann Christian Reil reformed the mental asylum system. Their institutions used rigorous work and leisure activities. This became part of what was known as moral treatment. Although it was thriving in Europe, interest in the reform movement fluctuated in the United States throughout the 19th century.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the establishment of public health measures to control infectious diseases included the building of fever hospitals. Patients with tuberculosis were recommended to have a regime of prolonged bed rest followed by a gradual increase in exercise.

This was a time in which the rising incidence of disability related to industrial accidents, tuberculosis, and mental illness brought about an increasing social awareness of the issues involved.

The Arts and Crafts movement that took place between 1860 and 1910 also impacted occupational therapy. The movement emerged against the monotony and lost autonomy of factory work in the developed world. Arts and crafts were used to promote learning through doing, provided a creative outlet, and served as a way to avoid boredom during long hospital stays.

From the late 1870&#x27;s, Scottish tuberculosis doctor Robert William Philip prescribed graded activity from complete rest through to gentle exercise and eventually to activities such as digging, sawing, carpentry and window cleaning. During this period a farm colony near Edinburgh and a village settlement near Papworth in England were established, both of which aimed to employ people in appropriate long-term work prior to their return to open employment.

== Development into a health profession ==
In the United States, the health profession of occupational therapy was conceived in the early 1910s as a reflection of the Progressive Era. Early professionals merged highly valued ideals, such as having a strong work ethic and the importance of crafting with one&#x27;s own hands with scientific and medical principles.

American social worker Eleanor Clarke Slagle (1870-1942) is considered to be the &quot;mother&quot; of occupational therapy. Slagle proposed habit training as a primary occupational therapy model of treatment. Based on the philosophy that engagement in meaningful routines shape a person&#x27;s wellbeing, habit training focused on creating structure and balance between work, rest and leisure. In 1912, she became director of a department of occupational therapy at The Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic in Baltimore.

== World War I ==
In 1915, Slagle worked at the first occupational therapy training program, the Henry B. Favill School of Occupations at Hull House in Chicago.

British-Canadian teacher and architect Thomas B. Kidner was appointed vocational secretary of the Canadian Military Hospitals Commission in January 1916. He was given the duty of preparing soldiers returning from World War I to return to their former vocational duties or retrain soldiers no longer able to perform their previous duties. He developed a program that engaged soldiers recovering from wartime injuries or tuberculosis in occupations even while they were still bedridden. Once the soldiers were sufficiently recovered they would work in a curative workshop and eventually progress to an industrial workshop before being placed in an appropriate work setting. He used occupations (daily activities) as a medium for manual training and helping injured individuals to return to productive duties such as work.The entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917 was a crucial event in the history of the profession. Up until this time, occupational therapy was not formalised into a profession. U.S. involvement in the war led to an escalating number of injured and disabled soldiers, which presented a daunting challenge to those in command.

The inaugural meeting of the National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy (NSPOT) was held in Clifton Springs, New York, 15-17 March 1917. The meeting was attended by six founders: George Edward Barton, William Rush Dunton, Eleanor Clarke Slagle, Thomas B Kidner, Susan Cox Johnson and Isabel Gladwin Newton Barton. Susan E. Tracy and Herbert James Hall, did not attend but are considered near founders of the Society. 

The military enlisted the assistance of NSPOT to recruit and train over 1,200 &quot;reconstruction aides&quot; to help with the rehabilitation of those wounded in the war.

Dunton&#x27;s 1918 article &quot;The Principles of Occupational Therapy&quot; appeared in the journal &quot;Public Health&quot;, and laid the foundation for the textbook he published in 1919 entitled &quot;Reconstruction Therapy&quot;.

Dunton struggled with &quot;the cumbersomeness of the term occupational therapy&quot;, as he thought it lacked the &quot;exactness of meaning which is possessed by scientific terms&quot;. Other titles such as &quot;work-cure&quot;, &quot;ergo therapy&quot; (ergo being the Greek root for &quot;work&quot;), and &quot;creative occupations&quot; were discussed as substitutes, but ultimately, none possessed the broad meaning that the practice of occupational therapy demanded in order to capture the many forms of treatment that existed from the beginning. NSPOT formally adopted the name &quot;occupational therapy&quot; for the field in 1921.

== Inter-war period ==
There was a struggle to keep people in the profession during the post-war years. Emphasis shifted from the altruistic war-time mentality to the financial, professional, and personal satisfaction that comes with being a therapist. To make the profession more appealing, practice was standardized, as was the curriculum. Entry and exit criteria were established, and the American Occupational Therapy Association advocated for steady employment, decent wages, and fair working conditions. Via these methods, occupational therapy sought and obtained medical legitimacy in the 1920s.

The emergence of occupational therapy challenged the views of mainstream scientific medicine. Instead of focusing purely on the medical model, occupational therapists argued that a complex combination of social, economic, and biological reasons cause dysfunction. Principles and techniques were borrowed from many disciplines—including but not limited to physical therapy, nursing, psychiatry, rehabilitation, self-help, orthopedics, and social work—to enrich the profession&#x27;s scope.

The 1920s and 1930s were a time of establishing standards of education and laying the foundation of the profession and its organization. Eleanor Clarke Slagle proposed a 12-month course of training in 1922, and these standards were adopted in 1923. In 1928, William Denton published another textbook, &quot;Prescribing Occupational Therapy&quot;. Educational standards were expanded to a total training time of 18 months in 1930 to place the requirements for professional entry on par with those of other professions. By the early 1930s, AOTA had established educational guidelines and accreditation procedures.

Margaret Barr Fulton became the first US qualified occupational therapist to work in the United Kingdom in 1925. She qualified at the Philadelphia School in the United States and was appointed to the Aberdeen Royal Hospital for mental patients where she worked until her retirement in 1963. US-style OT was introduced into England by Dr Elizabeth Casson who had visited similar establishments in America. (Casson had also earlier worked under the transformative English social reformer Octavia Hill.) In 1929 she established her own residential clinic in Bristol, Dorset House, for &quot;women with mental disorders&quot;, and worked as its medical director. It was here in 1930 that she founded the first school of occupational therapy in the UK.

The Scottish Association of Occupational Therapists was founded in 1932. The profession was served in the rest of the UK by the Association of Occupational Therapists from 1936. (The two later merged to form what is today the Royal College of Occupational Therapists in 1974.)

== World War II ==
With the US entry into World War II and the ensuing skyrocketing demand for occupational therapists to treat those injured in the war, the field of occupational therapy underwent dramatic growth and change. Occupational therapists needed to be skilled not only in the use of constructive activities such as crafts, but also increasingly in the use of activities of daily living.

The body that is now Occupational Therapy Australia began in 1944.

== Post-World War II ==
Another textbook was published in the United States for occupational therapy in 1947, edited by Helen S. Willard and Clare S. Spackman. The profession continued to grow and redefine itself in the 1950s. In 1954, AOTA created the Eleanor Clarke Slagle Lectureship Award in its namesake&#x27;s honor. Each year, this award recognizes a member of AOTA &quot;who has creatively contributed to the development of the body of knowledge of the profession through research, education, or clinical practice.&quot; The profession also began to assess the potential for the use of trained assistants in the attempt to address the ongoing shortage of qualified therapists, and educational standards for occupational therapy assistants were implemented in 1960.

The 1960s and 1970s were a time of ongoing change and growth for the profession as it struggled to incorporate new knowledge and cope with the recent and rapid growth of the profession in the previous decades. New developments in the areas of neurobehavioral research led to new conceptualizations and new treatment approaches, possibly the most groundbreaking being the sensory integrative approach developed by A. Jean Ayres.

The profession has continued to grow and expand its scope and settings of practice. Occupational science, the study of occupation, was founded in 1989 by Elizabeth Yerxa at the University of Southern California as an academic discipline to provide foundational research on occupation to support and advance the practice of occupation-based occupational therapy, as well as offer a basic science to study topics surrounding &quot;occupation&quot;.

In addition, occupational therapy practitioner&#x27;s roles have expanded to include political advocacy (from a grassroots base to higher legislation); for example, in 2010 PL 111-148 titled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act had a habilitation clause that was passed in large part due to AOTA&#x27;s political efforts. Furthermore, occupational therapy practitioners have been striving personally and professionally toward concepts of occupational justice and other human rights issues that have both local and global impacts. The World Federation of Occupational Therapist&#x27;s Resource Centre has many position statements on occupational therapy&#x27;s roles regarding their participation in human rights issues.

In 2021, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked occupational therapy as #19 of their list of &#x27;100 Best Jobs&#x27;.

== Practice frameworks ==
An occupational therapist works systematically with a client through a sequence of actions called an &quot;occupational therapy process.&quot; There are several versions of this process. All practice frameworks include the components of evaluation (or assessment), intervention, and outcomes. This process provides a framework through which occupational therapists assist and contribute to promoting health and ensures structure and consistency among therapists.

=== Occupational Therapy Practice Framework (OTPF, United States) ===
The Occupational Therapy Practice Framework (OTPF) is the core competency of occupational therapy in the United States. The OTPF is divided into two sections: domain and process. The domain includes environment, client factors, such as the individual&#x27;s motivation, health status, and status of performing occupational tasks. The domain looks at the contextual picture to help the occupational therapist understand how to diagnose and treat the patient. The process is the actions taken by the therapist to implement a plan and strategy to treat the patient.

=== Canadian Practice Process Framework ===
The Canadian Model of Client Centered Enablement (CMCE) embraces occupational enablement as the core competency of occupational therapy and the Canadian Practice Process Framework (CPPF) as the core process of occupational enablement in Canada. The Canadian Practice Process Framework (CPPF) has eight action points and three contextual element which are: set the stage, evaluate, agree on objective plan, implement plan, monitor/modify, and evaluate outcome. A central element of this process model is the focus on identifying both client and therapists strengths and resources prior to developing the outcomes and action plan.

=== International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) ===
The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is the World Health Organisation&#x27;s framework to measure health and ability by illustrating how these components impact one&#x27;s function. This relates very closely to the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework, as it is stated that &quot;the profession&#x27;s core beliefs are in the positive relationship between occupation and health and its view of people as occupational beings&quot;. The ICF is built into the 2nd edition of the practice framework. Activities and participation examples from the ICF overlap Areas of Occupation, Performance Skills, and Performance Patterns in the framework. The ICF also includes contextual factors (environmental and personal factors) that relate to the framework&#x27;s context. In addition, body functions and structures classified within the ICF help describe the client factors described in the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework. Further exploration of the relationship between occupational therapy and the components of the ICIDH-2 (revision of the original International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH), which later became the ICF) was conducted by McLaughlin Gray.

It is noted in the literature that occupational therapists should use specific occupational therapy vocabulary along with the ICF in order to ensure correct communication about specific concepts. The ICF might lack certain categories to describe what occupational therapists need to communicate to clients and colleagues. It also may not be possible to exactly match the connotations of the ICF categories to occupational therapy terms. The ICF is not an assessment and specialized occupational therapy terminology should not be replaced with ICF terminology. The ICF is an overarching framework for current therapy practices.

==Occupations==
According to the American Occupational Therapy Association&#x27;s (AOTA) Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process, 4th Edition (OTPF-4), occupations are defined as &quot;everyday activities that people do as individuals, and families, and with communities to occupy time and bring meaning and purpose to life. Occupations include things people need to, want to and are expected to do&quot;. Occupations are central to a client&#x27;s (person&#x27;s, group&#x27;s, or population&#x27;s) health, identity, and sense of competence and have particular meaning and value to that client. Occupations include activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), education, work, play, leisure, social participation, rest and sleep.

== Practice settings ==
According to the 2019 Salary and Workforce Survey by the American Occupational Therapy Association, occupational therapists work in a wide-variety of practice settings including: hospitals (28.6%), schools (18.8%), long-term care facilities/skilled nursing facilities (14.5%), free-standing outpatient (13.3%), home health (7.3%), academia (6.9%), early intervention (4.4%), mental health (2.2%), community (2.4%), and other (1.6%). According to the AOTA, the most common primary work setting for occupational therapists is in hospitals. Also according to the survey, 46% of occupational therapists work in urban areas, 39% work in suburban areas and the remaining 15% work in rural areas. 

The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) found that as of 2020 nearly half (46.1%) of occupational therapists worked in hospitals, 43.2% worked in community health, 3.6% work in long-term care (LTC) and 7.1% work in &quot;other&quot;, including government, industry, manufacturing, and commercial settings. The CIHI also found that 68% of occupational therapists in Canada work in urban settings and only 3.7% work in rural settings.

==Areas of practice in the United States==
===Children and youth===
Occupational therapists work with infants, toddlers, children, youth, and their families in a variety of settings, including schools, clinics, homes, hospitals, and the community. Evaluation assesses the child&#x27;s ability to engage in daily, meaningful occupations, the underlying skills (or performance components) which may be physical, cognitive, or emotional in nature, and the fit between the client&#x27;s skills and the environments and contexts in which the client functions. OT intervention and involves evaluating a young person&#x27;s occupational performance in areas of feeding, playing, socializing which aligns with their neurodiversity, daily living skills, or attending school. In planning treatment, occupational therapists work in collaboration with the children and teens themselves, parents, caregivers, and teachers in order to develop functional goals within a variety of occupations meaningful to the young client.

Early intervention addresses daily functioning of a child between the ages of birth to three years old. OTs who practice in early intervention support a family&#x27;s ability to care for their child with special needs and promote his or her function and participation in the most natural environment. Each child is required to have an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) that focuses on the family&#x27;s goals for the child. It&#x27;s possible for an OT to serve as the family&#x27;s service coordinator and facilitate the team process for creating an IFSP for each eligible child.

Objectives that an occupational therapist addresses with children and youth may take a variety of forms. Examples are as follows:
* Providing rehabilitation activities to children with neuromuscular disabilities such as cerebral palsy
* Supporting self-regulation within neurodivergent children whose neurobiology does not align with the sensory environment or the contexts in which they function
* Facilitating coping skills to a child with generalized anxiety disorder.
* Consulting with teachers, psychologists, social workers, parents/caregivers, and other professionals who work with children regarding modifications, accommodations and supports in a variety of areas, such as sensory processing, motor planning, visual processing, and executive function skills.
* Providing individualized treatment for sensory processing differences.
* Providing splinting and caregiver education in a hospital burn unit.
* Instructing caregivers in regard to mealtime intervention for autistic children who have feeding challenges.
* Facilitating handwriting development through providing intervention to develop fine motor and writing readiness skills in school-aged children.

In the United States, pediatric occupational therapists work in the school setting as a &quot;related service&quot; for children with an Individual Education Plan (IEP). Every student who receives special education and related services in the public school system is required by law to have an IEP, which is a very individualized plan designed for each specific student (U.S. Department of Education, 2007). Related services are &quot;developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as are required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education,&quot; and include a variety of professions such as speech–language pathology and audiology services, interpreting services, psychological services, and physical and occupational therapy.

As a related service, occupational therapists work with children with varying disabilities to address those skills needed to access the special education program and support academic achievement and social participation throughout the school day (AOTA, n.d.-b). In doing so, occupational therapists help children fulfill their role as students and prepare them to transition to post-secondary education, career and community integration (AOTA, n.d.-b).

Occupational therapists have specific knowledge to increase participation in school routines throughout the day, including:
* Modification of the school environment to allow physical access for children with disabilities
* Provide assistive technology to support student success
* Helping to plan instructional activities for implementation in the classroom
* Support the needs of students with significant challenges such as helping to determine methods for alternate assessment of learning
* Helping students develop the skills necessary to transition to post-high school employment, independent living or further education (AOTA).

Other settings, such as homes, hospitals, and the community are important environments where occupational therapists work with children and teens to promote their independence in meaningful, daily activities. Outpatient clinics offer a growing OT intervention referred to as &quot;Sensory Integration Treatment&quot;. This therapy, provided by experienced and knowledgeable pediatric occupational therapists, was originally developed by A. Jean Ayres, an occupational therapist. Sensory integration therapy is an evidence-based practice which enables children to better process and integrate sensory input from the child&#x27;s body and from the environment, thus improving his or her emotional regulation, ability to learn, behavior, and functional participation in meaningful daily activities.

Recognition of occupational therapy programs and services for children and youth is increasing worldwide. Occupational therapy for both children and adults is now recognized by the United Nations as a human right which is linked to the social determinants of health. , there are over 500,000 occupational therapists working worldwide (many of whom work with children) and 778 academic institutions providing occupational therapy instruction.

===Health and wellness===
According to the American Occupational Therapy Association&#x27;s (AOTA) &quot;Occupational Therapy Practice Framework&quot;, 3rd Edition, the domain of occupational therapy is described as &quot;Achieving health, well-being, and participation in life through engagement in occupation&quot;. Occupational therapy practitioners have a distinct value in their ability to utilize daily occupations to achieve optimal health and well-being. By examining an individual&#x27;s roles, routines, environment, and occupations, occupational therapists can identify the barriers in achieving overall health, well-being and participation.

Occupational therapy practitioners can intervene at primary, secondary and tertiary levels of intervention to promote health and wellness. It can be addressed in all practice settings to prevent disease and injuries, and adapt healthy lifestyle practices for those with chronic diseases. Two of the occupational therapy programs that have emerged targeting health and wellness are the Lifestyle Redesign Program and the REAL Diabetes Program.

Occupational therapy interventions for health and wellness vary in each setting:

====School====
Occupational therapy practitioners target school-wide advocacy for health and wellness including: bullying prevention, backpack awareness, recess promotion, school lunches, and PE inclusion. They also heavily work with students with learning disabilities such as those on the autism spectrum.

A study conducted in Switzerland showed that a large majority of occupational therapists collaborate with schools, half of them providing direct services within mainstream school settings. The results also show that services were mainly provided to children with medical diagnoses, focusing on the school environment rather than the child&#x27;s disability.

====Outpatient====
Occupational therapy practitioners conduct 1:1 treatment sessions and group interventions to address: leisure, health literacy and education, modified physical activity, stress/anger management, healthy meal preparation, and medication management.

====Acute care====
Occupational therapy practitioners in acute care assess whether a patient has the cognitive, emotional and physical ability as well as the social supports needed to live independently and care for themselves after discharge from the hospital. Occupational therapists are uniquely positioned to support patients in acute care as they focus on both clinical and social determinants of health.

Services delivered by occupational therapists in acute care include:
* Direct rehabilitation interventions, individually or in group settings to address physical, emotional and cognitive skills that are required for the patient to perform self-care and other important activities.
* Caregiver training to assist patients after discharge.
* Recommendations for adaptive equipment for increased safety and independence with activities of daily living (e.g. aids for getting dressed, shower chairs for bathing, and medication organizers for self-administering medications).
* They also perform home safety assessments to suggest modifications for improved safety and function after discharge.

Occupational therapists use a variety of models, including the Model of Human Occupation, Person, Environment and Occupation, and Canadian Occupational Performance Model to adopt a client centered approach used for discharge planning. Hospital spending on occupational therapy services in acute care was found to be the single most significant spending category in reducing the risk of readmission to the hospital for heart failure, pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction. 

====Community-based====
Occupational therapy practitioners develop and implement community wide programs to assist in prevention of diseases and encourage healthy lifestyles by: conducting education classes for prevention, facilitating gardening, offering ergonomic assessments, and offering pleasurable leisure and physical activity programs.

===Mental health===
Mental Health
Occupational therapy&#x27;s foundation in mental health is deeply rooted in the moral treatment movement, which sought to replace the harsh treatment of mental disorders with the establishment of healthy routines and engagement in meaningful activities. This movement significantly influenced the development of occupational therapy, particularly through the contributions of early 20th-century practitioners and theorists like Adolph Meyer, who emphasized a holistic approach to mental health care (Christiansen &amp; Haertl, 2014).
According to the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), occupational therapy is based on the principle that &quot;active engagement in occupation promotes, facilitates, supports, and maintains health and participation&quot; (AOTA, 2017). Occupations refer to individuals&#x27; activities to structure their time and provide meaning. The primary goals of occupational therapy include promoting physical and mental health and well-being and establishing, restoring, maintaining, and improving function and quality of life for individuals at risk of or affected by physical or mental health disorders (AOTA, 2017).

Education and Professional Qualifications

Occupational therapists require a master&#x27;s degree or clinical doctorate, while occupational therapy assistants need at least an associate&#x27;s degree. Their education encompasses extensive mental health-related topics, including biological, physical, social, and behavioral sciences, and supervised clinical experiences culminating in full-time internships. Both must pass national examinations and meet state licensure requirements. Occupational therapists apply mental and physical health knowledge, focusing on participation and occupation, using performance-based assessments to understand the relationship between occupational participation and well-being. Their education covers various aspects of mental health, including neurophysiological changes, human development, historical and contemporary perspectives on mental health, and current diagnostic criteria. This comprehensive training prepares occupational therapy practitioners to address the complex interplay of client variables, activity demands, and environmental factors in promoting health and managing health challenges (Bazyk &amp; Downing, 2017).
Occupational therapy role in mental health practice

Occupational therapy practitioners play a critical role in mental health by using therapeutic activities to promote mental health and support full participation in life for individuals at risk of or experiencing psychiatric, behavioral, and substance use disorders. They work across the lifespan and in various settings, including homes, schools, workplaces, community environments, hospitals, outpatient clinics, and residential facilities (AOTA,2017). Occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants assume diverse roles, such as case managers, care coordinators, group facilitators, community mental health providers, consultants, program developers, and advocates. Their interventions aim to facilitate engagement in meaningful occupations, enhance role performance, and improve overall well-being. This involves analyzing, adapting, and modifying tasks and environments to support clients&#x27; goals and optimal engagement in daily activities (AOTA, 2017).
Occupational therapy practitioners utilize clinical reasoning, informed by various theoretical perspectives and evidence-based approaches, to guide evaluation and intervention. They are skilled in analyzing the complex interplay among client variables, activity demands, and the environments where participation occurs. For individuals experiencing any mental health issues, his or her ability to participate in occupations actively may be hindered. For example, an individual diagnosed with depression or anxiety may experience interruptions in sleep, difficulty completing self-care tasks, decreased motivation to participate in leisure activities, decreased concentration for school or job-related work, and avoidance of social interactions.

Occupational therapy utilizes the public health approach to mental health (WHO, 2001) which emphasizes the promotion of mental health as well as the prevention of, and intervention for, mental illness. This model highlights the distinct value of occupational therapists in mental health promotion, prevention, and intensive interventions across the lifespan (Miles et al., 2010). Below are the three major levels of service:

====Tier 3: intensive interventions====
Intensive interventions are provided for individuals with identified mental, emotional, or behavioral disorders that limit daily functioning, interpersonal relationships, feelings of emotional well-being, and the ability to cope with challenges in daily life. Occupational therapy practitioners are committed to the recovery model which focuses on enabling persons with mental health challenges through a client-centered process to live a meaningful life in the community and reach their potential (Champagne &amp; Gray, 2011).

The focus of intensive interventions (direct–individual or group, consultation) is engagement in occupation to foster recovery or &quot;reclaiming mental health&quot; resulting in optimal levels of community participation, daily functioning, and quality of life; functional assessment and intervention (skills training, accommodations, compensatory strategies) (Brown, 2012); identification and implementation of healthy habits, rituals, and routines to support wellness.

====Tier 2: targeted services====
Targeted services are designed to prevent mental health problems in persons who are at risk of developing mental health challenges, such as those who have emotional experiences (e.g., trauma, abuse), situational stressors (e.g., physical disability, bullying, social isolation, obesity) or genetic factors (e.g., family history of mental illness). Occupational therapy practitioners are committed to early identification of and intervention for mental health challenges in all settings.

The focus of targeted services (small groups, consultation, accommodations, education) is engagement in occupations to promote mental health and diminish early symptoms; small, therapeutic groups (Olson, 2011); environmental modifications to enhance participation (e.g., create Sensory friendly classrooms, home, or work environments)

====Tier 1: universal services====
Universal services are provided to all individuals with or without mental health or behavioral problems, including those with disabilities and illnesses (Barry &amp; Jenkins, 2007). Occupational therapy services focus on mental health promotion and prevention for all: encouraging participation in health-promoting occupations (e.g., enjoyable activities, healthy eating, exercise, adequate sleep); fostering self-regulation and coping strategies (e.g., mindfulness, yoga); promoting mental health literacy (e.g., knowing how to take care of one&#x27;s mental health and what to do when experiencing symptoms associated with ill mental health). Occupational therapy practitioners develop universal programs and embed strategies to promote mental health and well-being in a variety of settings, from schools to the workplace.

The focus of universal services (individual, group, school-wide, employee/organizational level) is universal programs to help all individuals successfully participate in occupations that promote positive mental health (Bazyk, 2011); educational and coaching strategies with a wide range of relevant stakeholders focusing on mental health promotion and prevention; the development of coping strategies and resilience; environmental modifications and supports to foster participation in health-promoting occupations.

===Productive aging===
Occupational therapists work with older adults to maintain independence, participate in meaningful activities, and live fulfilling lives. Some examples of areas that occupational therapists address with older adults are driving, aging in place, low vision, and dementia or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD). When addressing driving, driver evaluations are administered to determine if drivers are safe behind the wheel. To enable independence of older adults at home, occupational therapists perform falls risk assessments, assess clients functioning in their homes, and recommend specific home modifications. When addressing low vision, occupational therapists modify tasks and the environment. While working with individuals with AD, occupational therapists focus on maintaining quality of life, ensuring safety, and promoting independence.

===Geriatrics/productive aging===
Occupational therapists address all aspects of aging from health promotion to treatment of various disease processes. The goal of occupational therapy for older adults is to ensure that older adults can maintain independence and reduce health care costs associated with hospitalization and institutionalization. In the community, occupational therapists can assess an older adults ability to drive and if they are safe to do so. If it is found that an individual is not safe to drive the occupational therapist can assist with finding alternate transit options. Occupational therapists also work with older adults in their home as part of home care. In the home, an occupational therapist can work on such things as fall prevention, maximizing independence with activities of daily living, ensuring safety and being able to stay in the home for as long as the person wants. An occupational therapist can also recommend home modifications to ensure safety in the home. Many older adults have chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, and cardiopulmonary conditions. Occupational therapists can help manage these conditions by offering education on energy conservation strategies or coping strategies. Not only do occupational therapists work with older adults in their homes, they also work with older adults in hospitals, nursing homes and post-acute rehabilitation. In nursing homes, the role of the occupational therapist is to work with clients and caregivers on education for safe care, modifying the environment, positioning needs and enhancing IADL skills to name a few. In post-acute rehabilitation, occupational therapists work with clients to get them back home and to their prior level of function after a hospitalization for an illness or accident. Occupational therapists also play a unique role for those with dementia. The therapist may assist with modifying the environment to ensure safety as the disease progresses along with caregiver education to prevent burnout. Occupational therapists also play a role in palliative and hospice care. The goal at this stage of life is to ensure that the roles and occupations that the individual finds meaningful continue to be meaningful. If the person is no longer able to perform these activities, the occupational therapist can offer new ways to complete these tasks while taking into consideration the environment along with psychosocial and physical needs. Not only do occupational therapists work with older adults in traditional settings, they also work in senior centre&#x27;s and ALFs.

===Visual impairment===
Visual impairment is one of the top 10 disabilities among American adults. Occupational therapists work with other professions, such as optometrists, ophthalmologists, and certified low vision therapists, to maximize the independence of persons with a visual impairment by using their remaining vision as efficiently as possible. AOTA&#x27;s promotional goal of &quot;Living Life to Its Fullest&quot; speaks to who people are and learning about what they want to do, particularly when promoting the participation in meaningful activities, regardless of a visual impairment. Populations that may benefit from occupational therapy includes older adults, persons with traumatic brain injury, adults with potential to return to driving, and children with visual impairments. Visual impairments addressed by occupational therapists may be characterized into two types including low vision or a neurological visual impairment. An example of a neurological impairment is a cortical visual impairment (CVI) which is defined as &quot;...abnormal or inefficient vision resulting from a problem or disorder affecting the parts of brain that provide sight&quot;. The following section will discuss the role of occupational therapy when working with the visually impaired.

Occupational therapy for older adults with low vision includes task analysis, environmental evaluation, and modification of tasks or the environment as needed. Many occupational therapy practitioners work closely with optometrists and ophthalmologists to address visual deficits in acuity, visual field, and eye movement in people with traumatic brain injury, including providing education on compensatory strategies to complete daily tasks safely and efficiently. Adults with a stable visual impairment may benefit from occupational therapy for the provision of a driving assessment and an evaluation of the potential to return to driving. Lastly, occupational therapy practitioners enable children with visual impairments to complete self care tasks and participate in classroom activities using compensatory strategies.

===Adult rehabilitation===
Occupational therapists address the need for rehabilitation following an injury or impairment. When planning treatment, occupational therapists address the physical, cognitive, psychosocial, and environmental needs involved in adult populations across a variety of settings.

Occupational therapy in adult rehabilitation may take a variety of forms:
* Working with adults with autism at day rehabilitation programs to promote successful relationships and community participation through instruction on social skills
* Increasing the quality of life for an individual with cancer by engaging them in occupations that are meaningful, providing anxiety and stress reduction methods, and suggesting fatigue management strategies
* Coaching individuals with hand amputations how to put on and take off a myoelectrically controlled limb as well as training for functional use of the limb
* Pressure sore prevention for those with sensation loss such as in spinal cord injuries.
* Using and implementing new technology such as speech to text software and Nintendo Wii video games
* Communicating via telehealth methods as a service delivery model for clients who live in rural areas
* Working with adults who have had a stroke to regain their activities of daily living

===Assistive technology===
Occupational therapy practitioners, or occupational therapists (OTs), are uniquely poised to educate, recommend, and promote the use of assistive technology to improve the quality of life for their clients. OTs are able to understand the unique needs of the individual in regards to occupational performance and have a strong background in activity analysis to focus on helping clients achieve goals. Thus, the use of varied and diverse assistive technology is strongly supported within occupational therapy practice models.

===Travel occupational therapy===
Because of the rising need for occupational therapy practitioners in the U.S., many facilities are opting for travel occupational therapy practitioners—who are willing to travel, often out of state, to work temporarily in a facility. Assignments can range from 8 weeks to 9 months, but typically last 13–26 weeks in length. Travel therapists work in many different settings, but the highest need for therapists are in home health and skilled nursing facility settings. There are no further educational requirements needed to be a travel occupational therapy practitioner; however, there may be different state licensure guidelines and practice acts that must be followed. According to Zip Recruiter, , the national average salary for a full-time travel therapist is $86,475 with a range between $62,500 to $100,000 across the United States. Most commonly (43%), travel occupational therapists enter the industry between the ages of 21–30.

===Occupational justice===
The practice area of occupational justice relates to the &quot;benefits, privileges and harms associated with participation in occupations&quot; and the effects related to access or denial of opportunities to participate in occupations. This theory brings attention to the relationship between occupations, health, well-being, and quality of life. Occupational justice can be approached individually and collectively. The individual path includes disease, disability, and functional restrictions. The collective way consists of public health, gender and sexual identity, social inclusion, migration, and environment. The skills of occupational therapy practitioners enable them to serve as advocates for systemic change, impacting institutions, policy, individuals, communities, and entire populations. Examples of populations that experience occupational injustice include refugees, prisoners, homeless persons, survivors of natural disasters, individuals at the end of their life, people with disabilities, elderly living in residential homes, individuals experiencing poverty, children, immigrants, and LGBTQI+ individuals.

For example, the role of an occupational therapist working to promote occupational justice may include:
* Analyzing task, modifying activities and environments to minimize barriers to participation in meaningful activities of daily living.
* Addressing physical and mental aspects that may hinder a person&#x27;s functional ability.
* Provide intervention that is relevant to the client, family, and social context.
* Contribute to global health by advocating for individuals with disabilities to participate in meaningful activities on a global level. Occupation therapists are involved with the World Health Organization (WHO), non-governmental organizations and community groups and policymaking to influence the health and well-being of individuals with disabilities worldwide

Occupational therapy practitioners&#x27; role in occupational justice is not only to align with perceptions of procedural and social justice but to advocate for the inherent need of meaningful occupation and how it promotes a just society, well-being, and quality of life among people relevant to their context. It is recommended to the clinicians to consider occupational justice in their everyday practice to promote the intention of helping people participate in tasks that they want and need to do.

===Occupational injustice===
In contrast, occupational injustice relates to conditions wherein people are deprived, excluded or denied of opportunities that are meaningful to them. Types of occupational injustices and examples within the OT practice include:

Occupational deprivation: The exclusion from meaningful occupations due to external factors that are beyond the person&#x27;s control. For example, a person with difficulties with functional mobility may find it challenging to reintegrate into the community due to transportation barriers.
* OTs can help in raising awareness and bringing communities together to reduce occupational deprivation
* OTs can recommend the removal of environmental barriers to facilitate occupation, whilst designing programs that enable engagement.
* Advocacy by providing information to policy to prevent possible unintended occupational deprivation and increase social cohesion and inclusion

Occupational apartheid: The exclusion of a person in chosen occupations due to personal characteristics such as age, gender, race, nationality, or socioeconomic status. An example can be seen in children with developmental disabilities from low socioeconomic backgrounds whose families would opt out of therapy due to financial constraints.
* OTs providing interventions within a segregated population must focus on increasing occupational engagement through large-scale environmental modification and occupational exploration.
* OTs can address occupational engagement through group and individual skill-building opportunities, as well as community-based experiences that explore free and local resources

Occupational marginalization: Relates to how implicit norms of behavior or societal expectations prevent a person from engaging in a chosen occupation. As an example, a child with physical impairments may only be offered table-top leisure activities instead of sports as an extracurricular activity due to the functional limitations caused by his physical impairments.
* OTs can design, develop, and/or provide programs that mitigate the negative impacts of occupational marginalization and enhance optimal levels of performance and wellbeing that enable participation

Occupational imbalance: The limited participation in a meaningful occupation brought about by another role in a different occupation. This can be seen in the situation of a caregiver of a person with a disability who also has to fulfill other roles such as being a parent to other children, a student, or a worker.
* OTs can advocate fostering for supportive environments for participation in occupations that promote individuals&#x27; well-being and in advocating for building healthy public policy

Occupational alienation: The imposition of an occupation that does not hold meaning for that person. In the OT profession, this manifests in the provision of rote activities that do not really relate to the goals or the client&#x27;s interests.
* OTs can develop individualized activities tailored to the interests of the individual to maximize their potential.
* OTs can design, develop and promote programs that can be inclusive and provide a variety of choices that the individual can engage in.

Within occupational therapy practice, injustice may ensue in situations wherein professional dominance, standardized treatments, laws and political conditions create a negative impact on the occupational engagement of our clients. Awareness of these injustices will enable the therapist to reflect on his own practice and think of ways in approaching their client&#x27;s problems while promoting occupational justice.

===Community-based therapy===
As occupational therapy (OT) has grown and developed, community-based practice has blossomed from an emerging area of practice to a fundamental part of occupational therapy practice (Scaffa &amp; Reitz, 2013). Community-based practice allows for OTs to work with clients and other stakeholders such as families, schools, employers, agencies, service providers, stores, day treatment and day care and others who may influence the degree of success the client will have in participating. It also allows the therapist to see what is actually happening in the context and design interventions relevant to what might support the client in participating and what is impeding her or him from participating. Community-based practice crosses all of the categories within which OTs practice from physical to cognitive, mental health to spiritual, all types of clients may be seen in community-based settings. The role of the OT also may vary, from advocate to consultant, direct care provider to program designer, adjunctive services to therapeutic leader.

===Nature-based therapy===
Nature-based interventions and outdoor activities may be incorporated into occupational therapy practice as they can provide therapeutic benefits in various ways. Examples include therapeutic gardening, animal-assisted therapy (AAT), and adventure therapy.

For instance, parents reported improvement in the emotional regulation and social engagement of their children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a study of parental perceptions regarding the outcomes of AAT conducted with trained dogs. They also observed reductions in problematic behaviors. A source cited in the study found similar results with AAT employing horses and llamas.

Gardening in a group setting may serve as a complementary intervention in stroke rehabilitation; in addition to being mentally restful and conducive to social connection, it helps patients master skills and can remind them of experiences from their past. Royal Rehab&#x27;s Productive Garden Project in Australia, managed by a horticultural therapist, allows patients and practitioners to participate in meaningful activity outside the usual healthcare settings. Thus, tending a garden helps facilitate experiential activities, perhaps attaining a better balance between clinical and real-life pursuits during rehabilitation, in lieu of mainly relying on clinical interventions.

For adults with acquired brain injury, nature-based therapy has been found to improve motor abilities, cognitive function, and general quality of life. Contributing to a theoretical understanding of such successes in nature-based approaches are: nature&#x27;s positive impact on problem solving and the refocusing of attention; an innate human connection with, and positive response to, the natural world; an increased sense of well-being when in contact with nature; and the emotional, nonverbal, and cognitive aspects of human-environment interaction.

== Education ==
Worldwide, there is a range of qualifications required to practice as an occupational therapist or occupational therapy assistant. Depending on the country and expected level of practice, degree options include associate degree, Bachelor&#x27;s degree, entry-level master&#x27;s degree, post-professional master&#x27;s degree, entry-level Doctorate (OTD), post-professional Doctorate (DrOT or OTD), Doctor of Clinical Science in OT (CScD), Doctor of Philosophy in Occupational Therapy (PhD), and combined OTD/PhD degrees.

Both occupational therapist and occupational therapy assistant roles exist internationally. Currently in the United States, dual points of entry exist for both OT and OTA programs. For OT, that is entry-level Master&#x27;s or entry-level Doctorate. For OTA, that is associate degree or bachelor&#x27;s degree.

The World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT) has minimum standards for the education of OTs, which was revised in 2016. All of the educational programs around the world need to meet these minimum standards. These standards are subsumed by and can be supplemented with academic standards set by a country&#x27;s national accreditation organization. As part of the minimum standards, all programs must have a curriculum that includes practice placements (fieldwork). Examples of fieldwork settings include: acute care, inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, skilled nursing facilities, schools, group homes, early intervention, home health, and community settings.

The profession of occupational therapy is based on a wide theoretical and evidence based background. The OT curriculum focuses on the theoretical basis of occupation through multiple facets of science, including occupational science, anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, and neurology. In addition, this scientific foundation is integrated with knowledge from psychology, sociology and more.

In the United States, Canada, and other countries around the world, there is a licensure requirement. In order to obtain an OT or OTA license, one must graduate from an accredited program, complete fieldwork requirements, and pass a national certification examination.

==Philosophical underpinnings==
The philosophy of occupational therapy has evolved over the history of the profession. The philosophy articulated by the founders owed much to the ideals of romanticism, pragmatism and humanism, which are collectively considered the fundamental ideologies of the past century.

One of the most widely cited early papers about the philosophy of occupational therapy was presented by Adolf Meyer, a psychiatrist who had emigrated to the United States from Switzerland in the late 19th century and who was invited to present his views to a gathering of the new Occupational Therapy Society in 1922. At the time, Dr. Meyer was one of the leading psychiatrists in the United States and head of the new psychiatry department and Phipps Clinic at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.

William Rush Dunton, a supporter of the National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy, now the American Occupational Therapy Association, sought to promote the ideas that occupation is a basic human need, and that occupation is therapeutic. From his statements came some of the basic assumptions of occupational therapy, which include:
* Occupation has a positive effect on health and well-being.
* Occupation creates structure and organizes time.
* Occupation brings meaning to life, culturally and personally.
* Occupations are individual. People value different occupations.

These assumptions have been developed over time and are the basis of the values that underpin the Codes of Ethics issued by the national associations. The relevance of occupation to health and well-being remains the central theme.

In the 1950s, criticism from medicine and the multitude of disabled World War II veterans resulted in the emergence of a more reductionistic philosophy. While this approach led to developments in technical knowledge about occupational performance, clinicians became increasingly disillusioned and re-considered these beliefs. As a result, client centeredness and occupation have re-emerged as dominant themes in the profession. Over the past century, the underlying philosophy of occupational therapy has evolved from being a diversion from illness, to treatment, to enablement through meaningful occupation.

Three commonly mentioned philosophical precepts of occupational therapy are that occupation is necessary for health, that its theories are based on holism and that its central components are people, their occupations (activities), and the environments in which those activities take place. However, there have been some dissenting voices. Mocellin, in particular, advocated abandoning the notion of health through occupation as he proclaimed it obsolete in the modern world. As well, he questioned the appropriateness of advocating holism when practice rarely supports it. Some values formulated by the American Occupational Therapy Association have been critiqued as being therapist-centric and do not reflect the modern reality of multicultural practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hocking/Whiteford&quot;&gt;Hocking, C and Whiteford, G (1995). Multiculturalism in occupational therapy: A time for reflection on core values. Australian Occupational Therapy Journal, 42(4), 172–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times occupational therapy practitioners have challenged themselves to think more broadly about the potential scope of the profession, and expanded it to include working with groups experiencing occupational injustice stemming from sources other than disability. Examples of new and emerging practice areas would include therapists working with refugees, children experiencing obesity, and people experiencing homelessness.

==Theoretical frameworks==
A distinguishing facet of occupational therapy is that therapists often espouse the use theoretical frameworks to frame their practice. Many have argued that the use of theory complicates everyday clinical care and is not necessary to provide patient-driven care.

Note that terminology differs between scholars. An incomplete list of theoretical bases for framing a human and their occupations include the following:

===Generic models===
Generic models are the overarching title given to a collation of compatible knowledge, research and theories that form conceptual practice. More generally they are defined as &quot;those aspects which influence our perceptions, decisions and practice&quot;.
* The Person Environment Occupation Performance model (PEOP) was originally published in 1991 (Charles Christiansen &amp; M. Carolyn Baum) and describes an individual&#x27;s performance based on four elements including: environment, person, performance and occupation. The model focuses on the interplay of these components and how this interaction works to inhibit or promote successful engagement in occupation.
Occupation-focused practice models
* Occupational Therapy Intervention Process Model (OTIPM) (Anne Fisher and others)
* Occupational Performance Process Model (OPPM)
* Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) (Gary Kielhofner and others)
** MOHO was first published in 1980. It explains how people select, organise and undertake occupations within their environment. The model is supported with evidence generated over thirty years and has been successfully applied throughout the world.
* Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement (CMOP-E)

This framework was originated in 1997 by the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (CAOT) as the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance (CMOP). It was expanded in 2007 by Palatjko, Townsend and Craik to add engagement. This framework upholds the view that three components—the person, environment and occupation- are related. Engagement was added to encompass occupational performance. A visual model is depicted with the person located at the center of the model as a triangle. The triangles three points represent cognitive, affective, and physical components with a spiritual center. The person triangle is surrounded by an outer ring symbolizing the context of environment with an inner ring symbolizing the context of occupation.
* Occupational Performances Model – Australia (OPM-A) (Chris Chapparo &amp; Judy Ranka)
** The OPM(A) was conceptualized in 1986 with its current form launched in 2006. The OPM(A) illustrates the complexity of occupational performance, the scope of occupational therapy practice, and provides a framework for occupational therapy education.
* Kawa (River) Model (Michael Iwama)
* Biopsychosocial models
** Engel&#x27;s biopsychosocial model takes into account how disease and illness can be impacted by social, environmental, psychological and body functions. The biopsychosocial model is unique in that it takes the client&#x27;s subjective experience and the client-provider relationship as factors to wellness. This model also factors in cultural diversity as many countries have different societal norms and beliefs. This is a multifactorial and multi-dimensional model to understand not only the cause of disease but also a person-centered approach that the provider has more of a participatory and reflective role.
** Other models which incorporate biology (body and brain), psychology (mind), and social (relational, attachment) elements influencing human health include interpersonal neurobiology (IPNB), polyvagal theory (PVT), and the dynamic-maturational model of attachment and adaptation (DMM). The latter two in particular provide detail about the source, mechanism and function of somatic symptoms. Kasia Kozlowska describes how she uses these models to better connect with clients, to understand complex human illness, and how she includes occupational therapists as part of a team to address functional somatic symptoms. Her research indicates children with functional neurological disorders (FND) utilize higher, or more challenging, DMM self-protective attachment strategies to cope with their family environments, and how those impact functional somatic symptoms.
** Pamela Meredith and colleagues have been exploring the relationship between the attachment system and psychological and neurobiological systems with implications for how occupational therapists can improve their approach and techniques. They have found correlations between attachment and adult sensory processing, distress, and pain perception. In a literature review, Meredith identified a number of ways that occupational therapists can effectively apply an attachment perspective, sometimes uniquely.

===Frames of reference===
Frames of reference are an additional knowledge base for the occupational therapist to develop their treatment or assessment of a patient or client group. Though there are conceptual models (listed above) that allow the therapist to conceptualise the occupational roles of the patient, it is often important to use further reference to embed clinical reasoning. Therefore, many occupational therapists will use additional frames of reference to both assess and then develop therapy goals for their patients or service users.
* Biomechanical frame of reference
** The biomechanical frame of reference is primarily concerned with motion during occupation. It is used with individuals who experience limitations in movement, inadequate muscle strength or loss of endurance in occupations. The frame of reference was not originally compiled by occupational therapists, and therapists should translate it to the occupational therapy perspective, to avoid the risk of movement or exercise becoming the main focus.
* Rehabilitative (compensatory)
* Neurofunctional (Gordon Muir Giles and Clark-Wilson)
* Dynamic systems theory
* Client-centered frame of reference
** This frame of reference is developed from the work of Carl Rogers. It views the client as the center of all therapeutic activity, and the client&#x27;s needs and goals direct the delivery of the occupational therapy process.
* Cognitive-behavioural frame of reference
* Ecology of human performance model
* The recovery model
* Sensory integration
** Sensory integration framework is commonly implemented in clinical, community, and school-based occupational therapy practice. It is most frequently used with children with developmental delays and developmental disabilities such as autism spectrum disorder, Sensory processing disorder and dyspraxia. Core features of sensory integration in treatment include providing opportunities for the client to experience and integrate feedback using multiple sensory systems, providing therapeutic challenges to the client&#x27;s skills, integrating the client&#x27;s interests into therapy, organizing of the environment to support the client&#x27;s engagement, facilitating a physically safe and emotionally supportive environment, modifying activities to support the client&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, and creating sensory opportunities within the context of play to develop intrinsic motivation. While sensory integration is traditionally implemented in pediatric practice, there is emerging evidence for the benefits of sensory integration strategies for adults.

== Global occupational therapy ==
The World Federation of Occupational Therapists is an international voice of the profession and is a membership network of occupational therapists worldwide. WFOT supports the international practice of occupational therapy through collaboration across countries. WFOT currently includes over 100 member country organizations, 550,000 occupational therapy practitioners, and 900 approved educational programs.

The profession celebrates World Occupational Therapy Day on the 27th of October annually to increase visibility and awareness of the profession, promoting the profession&#x27;s development work at a local, national and international platform. WFOT has been in close collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) since 1959, working together in programmes that aim to improve world health. WFOT supports the vision for healthy people, in alignment with the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which focuses on &quot;ending poverty, fighting inequality and injustice, tackling climate change and promoting health&quot;. Occupational therapy is a major player in enabling individuals and communities to engage in &quot;chosen and necessary occupations&quot; and in &quot;the creation of more meaningful lives&quot;.

Occupational therapy is practiced around the world and can be translated in practice to many different cultures and environments. The construct of occupation is shared throughout the profession regardless of country, culture and context. Occupation and the active participation in occupation is now seen as a human right and is asserted as a strong influence in health and well-being.

As the profession grows there is a lot of people who are travelling across countries to work as occupational therapists for better work or opportunities. Under this context, every occupational therapist is required to adapt to a new culture, foreign to their own. Understanding cultures and its communities are crucial to occupational therapy ethos. Effective occupational therapy practice includes acknowledging the values and social perspectives of each client and their families. Harnessing culture and understanding what is important to the client is truly a faster way towards independence.

<text>Howard George Hampton (born May 17, 1952) is a politician who was a member of Provincial Parliament for the province of Ontario. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Canada, from 1987 to 1999 in the electoral district of Rainy River, and from 1999 to 2011 in the redistributed electoral district of Kenora—Rainy River. A member of the Ontario New Democratic Party, he was also the party&#x27;s leader from 1996 to 2009. Hampton retired from the legislature at the 2011 Ontario provincial election and subsequently joined Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP as a member of the law firm&#x27;s corporate social responsibility and aboriginal affairs groups.

His wife, Shelley Martel, was also an MPP until 2007, representing Nickel Belt.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Hampton was born in Fort Frances, Ontario to a blue collar family, George (April 17, 1928 - January 2, 2006) and Elsie (November 8, 1931 - April 18, 2016) Hampton. He was a good student, but also athletically gifted and politically active. He first joined the NDP when he was a teenager.

Hampton took an undergraduate degree in philosophy and religion from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where he played varsity hockey for the school&#x27;s Division I NCAA ice hockey team. He later obtained a degree in education from the University of Toronto and a law degree from the University of Ottawa. He worked as a lawyer for the Canadian Labour Congress, and for the provincial NDP government of Allan Blakeney in Saskatchewan.

==Enters provincial politics==
Hampton sought election to the Ontario legislature under the NDP banner in the 1977 provincial election, placing third against incumbent Liberal Pat Reid and Progressive Conservative Gordon Armstrong in Rainy River. He ran for the riding again in the 1985 provincial election, and lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Jack Pierce by 278 votes.

==Cabinet minister==
Hampton was elected to Queen&#x27;s Park on his third attempt, in the provincial election of 1987. He was re-elected in the 1990 provincial election, in which the NDP won a majority government. On October 1, 1990, he was appointed Attorney General in the government of Bob Rae.

By all accounts, Hampton and Rae were not cabinet allies. Hampton disapproved of many of the Rae government&#x27;s centrist policies; in particular, he opposed Rae&#x27;s decision to retreat from an election pledge to introduce public automobile insurance in the province. Journalist Thomas Walkom has argued that Rae deliberately undermined Hampton&#x27;s control over the Attorney General&#x27;s office, staffing the ministry with bureaucrats to which he was ideologically incompatible. However, Walkom has also noted that Hampton supported Rae&#x27;s decision to impose a Social Contract of wage restraints and cost-saving measures on Ontario public servants.

Following a cabinet shuffle on February 3, 1993, Hampton was demoted to Minister of Natural Resources, responsible for Native Affairs. Marion Boyd replaced him as Attorney General. The NDP was defeated in the provincial election of 1995, and Hampton was re-elected over Progressive Conservative Lynn Beyak by only 205 votes.

===Cabinet posts===

==Ontario NDP Leader==

After Rae retired from provincial politics, Hampton became the leader of the NDP on June 22, 1996, beating Frances Lankin, who was seen as a Rae ally and whom many had considered the front-runner, on the third ballot. Leadership candidate Peter Kormos and his support generally went to Hampton rather than Lankin, which was seen as important to Hampton&#x27;s victory. Tony Silipo also ran for the leadership and would become Hampton&#x27;s Deputy Leader until 1999.
In the 1999 Ontario election, some progressives and union leaders, who had been a crucial source of NDP support before 1995, attempted to defeat Mike Harris, the Progressive Conservative premier, by abandoning the NDP for the Liberals. This tactical voting, commonly called &quot;strategic voting,&quot; did not succeed in ousting the Harris government, but nearly decimated the NDP, as they took just nine seats and 12 per cent of the popular vote in their worst election showing since the 1950s. As Hampton was not judged to have been at fault, he stayed on as leader. Hampton himself faced a challenging re-election; the Harris government had reduced the number of ridings in Ontario from 130 to 103, and Hampton faced off against Frank Miclash, the Liberal MPP for the adjoining Kenora riding, in the amalgamated riding of Kenora-Rainy River. Hampton defeated Miclash by 3,000 votes.
Hampton endorsed Bill Blaikie in the latter&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for the federal New Democratic Party leadership in 2002. This decision was unpopular with some other members of his caucus, including Deputy Leader Marilyn Churley who was a leading supporter of Jack Layton.

In Harris&#x27; second term, the government unveiled plans to privatize the public electricity utility, Ontario Hydro. Hampton quickly distinguished himself as an advocate of maintaining public ownership of the utility, and published a book on the subject, &quot;Public Power&quot;, in 2003. Harris&#x27; successor as premier, Ernie Eves, ultimately reached the decision not to sell the hydro utility.

Hampton and the NDP won only seven seats in the 2003 Ontario election, losing official party status for the first time since 1963. However, Hampton retained his seat and the party increased its share of the popular vote by 2 per cent. After intense lobbying to lower the minimum number of seats for party status, a compromise was reached which allowed additional funding for the NDP and more inquiry opportunities during Question Period.

Ultimately, this controversy was all for nought as on May 13, 2004, the NDP regained official party status in a by-election in Hamilton East, where city councillor Andrea Horwath was elected to fill the vacancy left by the death of Liberal member Dominic Agostino. When Marilyn Churley resigned her Toronto—Danforth seat in May 2005, the NDP was granted official party status at first until the by-election, and then until the 2007 provincial election; NDP candidate Peter Tabuns won the seat.

The Ontario NDP increased its seat count to nine in September 2006, when well-known local United Church minister Cheri DiNovo won a byelection. The seat became vacant when Liberal MPP Gerard Kennedy resigned to seek the Liberal Party of Canada leadership.

Hampton launched the Ontario NDP&#x27;s 2007 provincial election campaign at the party&#x27;s Fresh Ideas New Energy January 2007 policy convention. Hampton&#x27;s keynote speech focused on the party&#x27;s campaign to raise the minimum wage to $10 an hour, and signalled the NDP&#x27;s renewed focus on matters of economic justice. The NDP also unveiled a new logo and look.

Hampton&#x27;s NDP increased its seat count to 10 in February 2007, when businessman and community activist Paul Ferreira defeated star Liberal candidate Laura Albanese in a byelection in the Toronto riding of York South-Weston. The seat became vacant when Liberal cabinet minister Joe Cordiano resigned. The NDP&#x27;s campaign for the $10 minimum wage and its opposition to a controversial 25 per cent pay raise for MPPs were cited as key factors in the upset win.

Despite several encouraging opinion polls that predicted a gain of several seats, Hampton&#x27;s NDP failed to increase its seat count beyond 10 in the 2007 provincial election. While there was speculation following the election that he may retire, Hampton announced at the November 24, 2007, NDP provincial council that he was staying as party leader. However, in April 2008, he indicated he was considering his political future and, on June 14, 2008, he announced that he would not stand for re-election as party leader at the March 2009 party convention. He remained an MPP for the remainder of his parliamentary mandate, but did not run in the 2011 election.

==Recent career==
Hampton currently lives Fort Frances. He and his wife Shelley Martel are separated.

After leaving politics, Hampton worked for several years for the Toronto law firm Fasken Martineau.

In November 2014, Hampton was appointed as a consultant to federal NDP leader Thomas Mulcair on the Northern Ontario Ring of Fire mining development. After several months of being encouraged by the party to run as its candidate in Kenora against federal Natural Resources minister Greg Rickford, Hampton announced that he would seek the party&#x27;s nomination in the riding for the October 19, 2015 federal election; he subsequently won the nomination. The federal riding includes much of Hampton&#x27;s old provincial riding. Hampton finished second behind the Liberal candidate, former MP and cabinet minister Bob Nault, pushing Rickford into third place.

<text>The Dana Meadows can be found at the eastern entrance to Yosemite National Park, at the foot of Mount Dana, not far from Tuolumne Meadows and the Tioga Pass entrance station.

== Description ==

The Dana Fork of the Tuolumne River originates adjacent to the meadows, and flows west through them towards its junction with the Lyell Fork of the Tuolumne River.

At an altitude of 9,728 feet (2,965 m), the meadow can be covered in snow up to 162 inches (411 cm) deep in wintertime. In June or July, it is springtime in these meadows, but snow can come at any time, especially after 1 September.

Before Yosemite became a park, Basque sheepherders would graze their flocks here, and in other areas of the Sierra Nevada. Often lonely, they would carve their initials into the trees of the meadow, several of which are still visible. (In hunting season, some animals of the Sierra, such as the deer, have learned to migrate into the park.)

The meadows are named for James Dwight Dana (1813–1895), a professor of geology and natural history at Yale.

<text>The Brookings Institution, often stylized as Brookings, is an American think tank that conducts research and education in the social sciences, primarily in economics (and tax policy), metropolitan policy, governance, foreign policy, global economy, and economic development. 

Brookings has five research programs: Economic Studies, Foreign Policy, Governance Studies, Global Economy and Development, and Brookings Metro. It also operated three international centers: in Doha, Qatar (Brookings Doha Center); Beijing, China (Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy); and New Delhi, India (Brookings India). In 2020 and 2021, the Institution announced it was separating entirely from its centers in Doha and New Delhi, and transitioning its center in Beijing to an informal partnership with Tsinghua University, known as Brookings-Tsinghua China.

The University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s &quot;Global Go To Think Tank Index Report&quot; has named Brookings &quot;Think Tank of the Year&quot; and &quot;Top Think Tank in the World&quot; every year since 2008. 

Brookings states that its staff &quot;represent diverse points of view&quot; and describes itself as nonpartisan. Media outlets have variously described Brookings as centrist, conservative, liberal, center-right, and center-left. An academic analysis of congressional records from 1993 to 2002 found that Brookings was cited by conservative politicians almost as often as by liberal politicians, earning a score of 53 on a 1–100 scale, with 100 representing the most liberal score. The same study found Brookings to be the most frequently cited think tank by U.S. media and politicians.

==History==
===20th century===

Brookings was founded in 1916 as the Institute for Government Research (IGR), with the mission of becoming &quot;the first private organization devoted to analyzing public policy issues at the national level.&quot; The organization was founded on March 13, 1916, and began operations on October 1, 1916.

Its stated mission is to &quot;provide innovative and practical recommendations that advance three broad goals: strengthen American democracy; foster the economic and social welfare, security, and opportunity of all Americans; and secure a more open, safe, prosperous, and cooperative international system.&quot;

The Institution&#x27;s founder, philanthropist Robert S. Brookings (1850–1932), originally created three organizations: the Institute for Government Research, the Institute of Economics with funds from the Carnegie Corporation, and the Robert Brookings Graduate School affiliated with Washington University in St. Louis. The three were merged into the Brookings Institution on December 8, 1927.

During the Great Depression, economists at Brookings embarked on a large-scale study commissioned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to understand its underlying causes. Brookings&#x27;s first president, Harold G. Moulton, and other Brookings scholars later led an effort to oppose Roosevelt&#x27;s National Recovery Administration because they thought it impeded economic recovery.

With the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, Brookings researchers turned their attention to aiding the administration with a series of studies on mobilization. In 1948, Brookings was asked to submit a plan for administering the European Recovery Program. The resulting organization scheme assured that the Marshall Plan was run carefully and on a businesslike basis.

In 1952, Robert Calkins succeeded Moulton as Brookings&#x27; president. He secured grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation and reorganized Brookings around the Economic Studies, Government Studies, and Foreign Policy Programs. In 1957, Brookings moved from Jackson Avenue to a new research center near Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C.

In 1967, Kermit Gordon assumed Brookings&#x27; presidency. He began a series of studies of program choices for the federal budget in 1969 titled &quot;Setting National Priorities&quot;. He also expanded the Foreign Policy Studies Program to include research about national security and defense. 

After Richard Nixon was elected president in the 1968 United States presidential election, the relationship between Brookings and the White House deteriorated. At one point, Nixon aide Charles Colson proposed a firebombing of the institution. G. Gordon Liddy and the White House Plumbers actually made a plan to firebomb the headquarters and steal classified files, but it was canceled because the Nixon administration refused to pay for a fire engine as a getaway vehicle. Yet throughout the 1970s, Brookings was offered more federal research contracts than it could handle.

In 1976, after Gordon died, Gilbert Y. Steiner, director of the governmental studies program, was appointed the fourth president of the Brookings Institution by the board of trustees. As director of the governmental studies program, Steiner brought in numerous scholars whose research ranges from administrative reform to urban policy, not only enhancing the program&#x27;s visibility and influence in Washington and nationally, but also producing works that have arguably survived as classics in the field of political science.

By the 1980s, Brookings faced an increasingly competitive and ideologically charged intellectual environment. The need to reduce the federal budget deficit became a major research theme, as did problems with national security and government inefficiency. Bruce MacLaury, Brookings&#x27;s fifth president, also established the Center for Public Policy Education to develop workshop conferences and public forums to broaden the audience for research programs.

In 1995, Michael Armacost became the sixth president of the Brookings Institution and led an effort to refocus its mission heading into the 21st century. Under his direction, Brookings created several interdisciplinary research centers, such as the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy, now the Metropolitan Policy Program led by Bruce J. Katz, which brought attention to the strengths of cities and metropolitan areas; and the Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, which brings together specialists from different Asian countries to examine regional problems.

===21st century===
In 2002, Strobe Talbott became president of Brookings. Shortly thereafter, Brookings launched the Saban Center for Middle East Policy and the John L. Thornton China Center. In 2006, Brookings announced the establishment of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center in Beijing. In July 2007, Brookings announced the creation of the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform to be directed by senior fellow Mark McClellan, and in October 2007 the creation of the Brookings Doha Center directed by fellow Hady Amr in Qatar. During this period the funding of Brookings by foreign governments and corporations came under public scrutiny (see Funding controversies below).

In 2011, Talbott inaugurated the Brookings India Office.

In October 2017, former general John R. Allen became the eighth president of Brookings. Allen resigned on June 12, 2022, amid an FBI foreign lobbying investigation.

As of June 30, 2019, Brookings had an endowment of $377.2 million.

==Publications==
Brookings as an institution produces an Annual Report. The Brookings Institution Press publishes books and journals from the institution&#x27;s own research as well as authors outside the organization. The books and journals it publishes include &quot;Brookings Papers on Economic Activity&quot;, &quot;Brookings Review&quot; (1982–2003, ), &quot;America Unbound: The Bush Revolution in Foreign Policy&quot;, &quot;Globalphobia: Confronting Fears about Open Trade&quot;, &quot;India: Emerging Power&quot;, &quot;Through Their Eyes&quot;, &quot;Taking the High Road&quot;, &quot;Masses in Flight&quot;, US Public Policy Regarding Sovereign Wealth Fund Investment in the United States and &quot;Stalemate&quot;. In addition, books, papers, articles, reports, policy briefs and opinion pieces are produced by Brookings research programs, centers, projects and, for the most part, by experts. Brookings also cooperates with The Lawfare Institute in publishing the online multimedia publication &quot;Lawfare&quot;.

==Policy influence==
Brookings traces its history to 1916 and has contributed to the creation of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan, and the Congressional Budget Office, as well as to the development of influential policies for deregulation, broad-based tax reform, welfare reform, and foreign aid. The annual think tank index published by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; ranks it the number one think tank in the U.S. and the Global Go To Think Tank Index believes it is the number one such tank in the world. Moreover, in spite of an overall decline in the number of times information or opinions developed by think tanks are cited by U.S. media, of the 200 most prominent think tanks in the U.S., the Brookings Institution&#x27;s research remains the most frequently cited.

In a 1997 survey of congressional staff and journalists, Brookings ranked as the most influential and first in credibility among 27 think tanks considered. Yet &quot;Brookings and its researchers are not so concerned, in their work, in affecting the ideological direction of the nation&quot; and rather tend &quot;to be staffed by researchers with strong academic credentials&quot;. Along with the Council on Foreign Relations and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Brookings is generally considered one of the most influential policy institutes in the U.S.

==Political stance==
As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Brookings describes itself as independent and nonpartisan. A 2005 UCLA study concluded it was &quot;centrist&quot; because it was referenced as an authority almost equally by both conservative and liberal politicians in congressional records from 1993 to 2002. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has called Brookings liberal, liberal-centrist, and centrist. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; has called Brookings centrist, liberal, and center-left. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Brookings liberal-leaning and centrist before opining that it did not believe such labels mattered.

In 1977, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called Brookings the &quot;nation&#x27;s pre-eminent liberal think tank&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; has called it centrist and &quot;Politico&quot; has used the term &quot;center-left&quot;.

The media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, which describes itself as &#x27;a progressive group&#x27;, has called Brookings &quot;centrist&quot;, &quot;conservative&quot;, and &quot;center-right&quot;.

Matthew Yglesias, a former writer and editor at &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, and Glenn Greenwald at &quot;Salon&quot; have argued that Brookings foreign policy scholars were overly supportive of Bush administration policies abroad.

Brookings scholars have served in Republican and Democratic administrations, including Mark McClellan, Ron Haskins and Martin Indyk.

Brookings&#x27;s board of trustees is composed of 53 trustees and more than three dozen honorary trustees, including Kenneth Duberstein, a former chief of staff to Ronald Reagan. Aside from political figures, the board of trustees includes leaders in business and industry, including Haim Saban, Robert Bass, Hanzade Doğan Boyner, Paul L. Cejas, W. Edmund Clark, Abby Joseph Cohen, Betsy Cohen, Susan Crown, Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., Jason Cummins, Paul Desmarais Jr., Kenneth M. Duberstein, Glenn Hutchins, and Philip H. Knight (chairman emeritus of Nike, Inc).

==Presidents==
Since its incorporation as the Brookings Institution in 1927, it has been led by accomplished academics and public servants. Brookings has had eleven presidents, including three in acting capacity. The current president is Cecilia Rouse, who replaced acting President Amy Liu, who began serving in January 2024.

==Research programs==
=== Center for Middle East Policy===
In 2002, the Brookings Institution established the Center for Middle East Policy (&quot;CMEP&quot;, formerly the Saban Center for Middle East Policy) &quot;to promote a better understanding of the policy choices facing American decision-makers in the Middle East&quot;. The center was launched in May 2002 &quot;with a special address by His Majesty King Abdullah II bin al-Hussein of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to a select audience of policymakers in Washington, D.C.&quot;

====Funding====
The center was originally named after American-Israeli film and television producer Haim Saban. Saban, according to the center and its parent organization, &quot;made a generous initial grant and pledged additional funds to endow the Center.&quot; According to a press release from Saban&#x27;s charitable foundation, Saban &quot;donated $13 million for the establishment of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution.&quot; Saban, according to the center, ascribed his involvement to his &quot;abiding interest in promoting Arab-Israeli peace and preserving American interests in the Middle East&quot; that led him to fund the center.

====People====
;Leadership
* Natan Sachs, Director and Fellow
;Fellows
* Daniel L. Byman, Senior Fellow
*Shadi Hamid, Senior Fellow
* Suzanne Maloney, Senior Fellow, and Vice President for Foreign Policy, Brookings
* Chris Meserole, Fellow
* Bruce Riedel, Senior Fellow

====Criticism====
Some critics have charged that various sources of funding for the center have influenced its outlook, but the center has dismissed such allegations, saying that in all cases the donors respected the center&#x27;s independence.

John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, in their 2006 article wrote: &quot;To be sure, the Saban Centre occasionally hosts Arab scholars and exhibits some diversity of opinion. Saban Center fellows ... often endorse the idea of a two-state settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. But Saban Center publications never question US support for Israel and rarely, if ever, offer significant criticism of key Israeli policies.&quot; Some Saban Center fellows have responded by criticizing the authors&#x27; scholarship and expansive definition of &quot;Israel lobby.&quot; Martin Indyk stated that their &quot;notion of a loosely aligned group of people that all happen to be working assiduously for Israel is indeed a cabal... And this cabal includes anyone that has anything positive to say about Israel… And what does this cabal do? It ‘distorts’ American foreign policy, it ‘bends’ it, all these words are used to suggest that this cabal is doing something anti-American.” Another fellow wrote that the authors&#x27; book &quot;will pale in comparison [to other academic works] because the only way it can become an esteemed classic is if its underlying thesis is correct: that a domestic political lobby drives U.S. policy in the Middle East. If that were true, then the ruckus raised by The Israeli Lobby would establish the book as a classic. But it isn’t true. Domestic politics and lobbying do matter when it comes to matters of tone and timing, but as Aaron David Miller, a veteran American peace-process diplomat, puts it...: “I can’t remember a single decision of consequence American peace process advisers made, or one we didn’t, that was directly tied to some lobbyist’s call, letter, or pressure tactic.”

In a September 17, 2014, article in &quot;Tablet&quot;, Lee Smith criticized the center for accepting substantial donations from the Qatari government, &quot;a foreign government that, in addition to its well-documented role as a funder of Sunni terror outfits throughout the Middle East, is the main patron of Hamas—which happens to be the mortal enemy of both the State of Israel and Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah party.&quot; He suggested that the donations influenced the center&#x27;s research analysis and Martin Indyk&#x27;s statements as a State Department official and peace mediator. Brookings responded: &quot;A review of publications and media appearances by our scholars in Doha and in Washington—all of which are available at Brookings.edu—demonstrate the same independence of thinking and objective, fact-based analysis about Qatar as on every other topic of our research. Our agreements with Qatar specifically protect the independence of our scholarship in all respects.&quot; Smith thanked the think tank for its response, but said it did &quot;not satisfactorily address the key issues [his] article raises.&quot;

===Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy===
In 2006, the Brookings Institution established the Brookings-Tsinghua Center (BTC) for Public Policy as a partnership between the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC and Tsinghua University&#x27;s School of Public Policy and Management in Beijing, China. The Center seeks to produce research in areas of fundamental importance for China&#x27;s development and for US-China relations. The BTC was directed by Qi Ye until 2019.

===21st Century Defense Initiative===

The 21st Century Defense Initiative (21CDI) is aimed at producing research, analysis, and outreach that address three core issues: the future of war, the future of U.S. defense needs and priorities, and the future of the US defense system.

The Initiative draws on the knowledge from regional centers, including the Center on the United States and Europe, the Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, the Thornton China Center, and the Center for Middle East Policy, allowing the integration of regional knowledge.

P. W. Singer, author of &quot;Wired for War&quot;, serves as Director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative, and Michael O&#x27;Hanlon serves as Director of Research. Senior Fellow Stephen P. Cohen and Vanda Felbab-Brown are also affiliated with 21CDI.

===WashU at Brookings===
Under MacLaury&#x27;s leadership in the 1980s, the Center for Public Policy Education (CPPE) was formed to develop workshop conferences and public forums to broaden the audience for research programs. In 2005, the center was renamed the Brookings Center for Executive Education (BCEE), which was shortened to Brookings Executive Education (BEE) with the launch of a partnership with the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis. The academic partnership is now known as &quot;WashU at Brookings&quot;.

===Funding details===
As of 2017 the Brookings Institution had assets of $524.2 million. Its largest contributors include the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Hutchins Family Foundation, JPMorgan Chase, the LEGO Foundation, David Rubenstein, State of Qatar, and John L. Thornton.

Funding details as of 2017:


===Funding controversies===
A 2014 investigation by &quot;The New York Times&quot; found Brookings to be among more than a dozen Washington, D.C.–based research groups and think tanks to have received payments from foreign governments while encouraging American government officials to support policies aligned with those foreign governments&#x27; agendas. &quot;The Times&quot; published documents showing that Brookings accepted grants from Norway with specific policy requests and helped it gain access to U.S. government officials, as well as other &quot;deliverables&quot;. In June 2014, Norway agreed to make an additional $4 million donation to Brookings. Several legal specialists who examined the documents told the paper that the language of the transactions &quot;appeared to necessitate Brookings filing as a foreign agent&quot; under the Foreign Agent Registration Act.

The government of Qatar was named by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;the single biggest foreign donor to Brookings&quot;, reportedly contributing $14.8 million over a four-year period. A former visiting fellow at a Brookings affiliate in Qatar reportedly said that &quot;he had been told during his job interview that he could not take positions critical of the Qatar government in papers&quot;. Brookings officials denied any connection between the views of their funders and their scholars&#x27; work, citing reports that questioned the Qatari government&#x27;s education reform efforts and criticized its support of militants in Syria. But Brookings officials reportedly acknowledged that they meet with Qatari government officials regularly.

In 2018, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Brookings accepted funding from Huawei from 2012 to 2018. A report by the Center for International Policy&#x27;s Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative of the top 50 think tanks on the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Global Go-To Think Tanks rating index found that between 2014 and 2018, Brookings received the third-highest amount of funding from outside the United States compared to other think tanks, with a total of more than $27 million.

In 2022, Brookings president John R. Allen resigned amid an FBI probe into lobbying on behalf of Qatar.

==Buildings==
The main building of the Institution was erected in 1959 on 1775 Massachusetts Avenue. In 2009, Brookings acquired a building across the street, a former mansion built by the Ingalls family in 1922 on a design by Jules Henri de Sibour.

<text>A paddle steamer is a steamship or steamboat powered by a steam engine driving paddle wheels to propel the craft through the water. In antiquity, paddle wheelers followed the development of poles, oars and sails, whereby the first uses were wheelers driven by animals or humans.
In the early 19th century, paddle wheels were the predominant way of propulsion for steam-powered boats. In the late 19th century, paddle propulsion was largely superseded by the screw propeller and other marine propulsion systems that have a higher efficiency, especially in rough or open water. Paddle wheels continue to be used by small, pedal-powered paddle boats and by some ships that operate tourist voyages. The latter are often powered by diesel engines.

== Paddle wheels ==

The paddle wheel is a large steel framework wheel. The outer edge of the wheel is fitted with numerous, regularly spaced paddle blades (called floats or buckets). The bottom quarter or so of the wheel travels under water. An engine rotates the paddle wheel in the water to produce thrust, forward or backward as required. More advanced paddle-wheel designs feature &quot;feathering&quot; methods that keep each paddle blade closer to vertical while in the water to increase efficiency. The upper part of a paddle wheel is normally enclosed in a paddlebox to minimise splashing.

== Types of paddle steamers ==
The three types of paddle wheel steamer are sidewheeler, with one paddlewheel on each side; sternwheeler, with a single paddlewheel at the stern; and (rarely) inboard, with the paddlewheel mounted in a recess amidships. 

===Sidewheeler===

The earliest s were sidewheelers, and the type was by far the dominant mode of marine steam propulsion, both for steamships and steamboats, until the increasing adoption of screw propulsion from the 1850s. Though the side wheels and enclosing sponsons make them wider than sternwheelers, they may be more maneuverable, since they can sometimes move the paddles at different speeds, and even in opposite directions. This extra maneuverability makes side-wheelers popular on the narrower, winding rivers of the Murray–Darling system in Australia, where a number still operate.

European sidewheelers, such as , connect the wheels with solid drive shafts that limit maneuverability and give the craft a wide turning radius. Some were built with paddle clutches that disengage one or both paddles so they can turn independently. However, wisdom gained from early experience with sidewheelers deemed that they be operated with clutches out, or as solid-shaft vessels. Crews noticed that as ships approached the dock, passengers moved to the side of the ship ready to disembark. The shift in weight, added to independent movements of the paddles, could lead to imbalance and potential capsizing. Paddle tugs were frequently operated with clutches in, as the lack of passengers aboard meant that independent paddle movement could be used safely and the added maneuverability exploited to the full.

===Sternwheeler===
Although the first sternwheelers were invented in Europe, they saw the most service in North America, especially on the Mississippi River. was built at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, in 1814 as an improvement over the less efficient side-wheelers. The second stern-wheeler built, &quot;Washington&quot; of 1816, had two decks and served as the prototype for all subsequent steamboats of the Mississippi, including those made famous in Mark Twain&#x27;s book &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;.

===Inboard paddlewheeler===
Recessed or inboard paddlewheel boats were designed to ply narrow and snag-infested backwaters. By recessing the wheel within the hull it was protected somewhat from damage. It was enclosed and could be spun at a high speed to provide acute maneuverability. Most were built with inclined steam cylinders mounted on both sides of the paddleshaft and timed 90 degrees apart like a locomotive, making them instantly reversing.

== Feathering paddle wheel ==

In a simple paddle wheel, where the paddles are fixed around the periphery, power is lost due to churning of the water as the paddles enter and leave the water surface. Ideally, the paddles should remain vertical while under water. This ideal can be approximated by use of levers and linkages connected to a fixed eccentric. The eccentric is fixed slightly forward of the main wheel centre. It is coupled to each paddle by a rod and lever. The geometry is designed such that the paddles are kept almost vertical for the short duration that they are in the water.

== History ==
=== Western world ===
The use of a paddle wheel in navigation appears for the first time in the mechanical treatise of the Roman engineer Vitruvius (&quot;De architectura&quot;, X 9.5–7), where he describes multigeared paddle wheels working as a ship odometer. The first mention of paddle wheels as a means of propulsion comes from the fourth– or fifth-century military treatise (chapter XVII), where the anonymous Roman author describes an ox-driven paddle-wheel warship:
Italian physician Guido da Vigevano (&quot;circa&quot; 1280–1349), planning for a new crusade, made illustrations for a paddle boat that was propelled by manually turned compound cranks.
One of the drawings of the Anonymous Author of the Hussite Wars shows a boat with a pair of paddlewheels at each end turned by men operating compound cranks. The concept was improved by the Italian Roberto Valturio in 1463, who devised a boat with five sets, where the parallel cranks are all joined to a single power source by one connecting rod, an idea adopted by his compatriot Francesco di Giorgio.

In 1539, Spanish engineer Blasco de Garay received the support of Charles V to build ships equipped with manually-powered side paddle wheels. From 1539 to 1543, Garay built and launched five ships, the most famous being the modified Portuguese carrack &quot;La Trinidad&quot;, which surpassed a nearby galley in speed and maneuverability on June 17, 1543, in the harbor of Barcelona. The project, however, was discontinued. 19th century writer Tomás González claimed to have found proof that at least some of these vessels were steam-powered, but this theory was discredited by the Spanish authorities. It has been proposed that González mistook a steam-powered desalinator created by Garay for a steam boiler.

In 1705, Papin constructed a ship powered by hand-cranked paddles. An apocryphal story originating in 1851 by Louis Figuire held that this ship was steam-powered rather than hand-powered and that it was therefore the first steam-powered vehicle of any kind. The myth was refuted as early as 1880 by , though still it finds credulous expression in some contemporary scholarly work.

In 1787, Patrick Miller of Dalswinton invented a double-hulled boat that was propelled on the Firth of Forth by men working a capstan that drove paddles on each side.

One of the first functioning steamships, &quot;Palmipède&quot;, which was also the first paddle steamer, was built in France in 1774 by Marquis Claude de Jouffroy and his colleagues. The steamer with rotating paddles sailed on the Doubs River in June and July 1776. In 1783, a new paddle steamer by de Jouffroy, , successfully steamed up the river Saône for 15 minutes before the engine failed. Bureaucracy and the French Revolution thwarted further progress by de Jouffroy.

The next successful attempt at a paddle-driven steam ship was by Scottish engineer William Symington, who suggested steam power to Patrick Miller of Dalswinton. Experimental boats built in 1788 and 1789 worked successfully on Lochmaben Loch. In 1802, Symington built a barge-hauler, , for the Forth and Clyde Canal Company. It successfully hauled two 70-ton barges almost in 6 hours against a strong headwind on test in 1802. Enthusiasm was high, but some directors of the company were concerned about the banks of the canal being damaged by the wash from a powered vessel, and no more were ordered.

While &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot; was the first commercial paddle steamer and steamboat, the first commercial success was possibly Robert Fulton&#x27;s &quot;Clermont&quot; in New York, which went into commercial service in 1807 between New York City and Albany. Many other paddle-equipped river boats followed all around the world; the first in Europe being designed by Henry Bell which started a scheduled passenger service on the River Clyde in 1812.

In 1812, the first U.S. Mississippi River paddle steamer began operating out of New Orleans. By 1814, Captain Henry Shreve had developed a &quot;steamboat&quot; suitable for local conditions. Landings in New Orleans went from 21 in 1814 to 191 in 1819, and over 1,200 in 1833.

The first stern-wheeler was designed by Gerhard Moritz Roentgen from Rotterdam, and used between Antwerp and Ghent in 1827.

Team boats, paddle boats driven by horses, were used for ferries the United States from the 1820s–1850s, as they were economical and did not incur licensing costs imposed by the steam navigation monopoly. In the 1850s, they were replaced by steamboats.

After the American Civil War, as the expanding railroads took many passengers, the traffic became primarily bulk cargoes. The largest, and one of the last, paddle steamers on the Mississippi was the sternwheeler &quot;Sprague&quot;. Built in 1901, she pushed coal and petroleum until 1948.

In Europe from the 1820s, paddle steamers were used to take tourists from the rapidly expanding industrial cities on river cruises, or to the newly established seaside resorts, where pleasure piers were built to allow passengers to disembark regardless of the state of the tide. Later, these paddle steamers were fitted with luxurious saloons in an effort to compete with the facilities available on the railways. Notable examples are the Thames steamers which took passengers from London to Southend-on-Sea and Margate, Clyde steamers that connected Glasgow with the resort of Rothsay and the Köln-Düsseldorfer cruise steamers on the River Rhine. Paddle steamer services continued into the mid-20th century, when ownership of motor cars finally made them obsolete except for a few heritage examples.

=== China ===

The first mention of a paddle-wheel ship from China is in the &quot;History of the Southern Dynasties&quot;, compiled in the 7th century but describing the naval ships of the Liu Song dynasty (420–479) used by admiral Wang Zhen&#x27;e in his campaign against the Qiang in 418 AD. The ancient Chinese mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–500) had a paddle-wheel ship built on the Xinting River (south of Nanjing) known as the &quot;thousand league boat&quot;. When campaigning against Hou Jing in 552, the Liang dynasty (502–557) admiral Xu Shipu employed paddle-wheel boats called &quot;water-wheel boats&quot;. At the siege of Liyang in 573, the admiral Huang Faqiu employed foot-treadle powered paddle-wheel boats. A successful paddle-wheel warship design was made in China by Prince Li Gao in 784 AD, during an imperial examination of the provinces by the Tang dynasty (618–907) emperor. The Chinese Song dynasty (960–1279) issued the construction of many paddle-wheel ships for its standing navy, and according to the British biochemist, historian, and sinologist Joseph Needham:
&quot;...between 1132 and 1183 (AD) a great number of treadmill-operated paddle-wheel craft, large and small, were built, including sternwheelers and ships with as many as 11 paddle-wheels a side,&quot;.
The standard Chinese term &quot;wheel ship&quot; was used by the Song period, whereas a litany of colorful terms were used to describe it beforehand. In the 12th century, the Song government used paddle-wheel ships &quot;en masse&quot; to defeat opposing armies of pirates armed with their own paddle-wheel ships. At the Battle of Caishi in 1161, paddle-wheelers were also used with great success against the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) navy. The Chinese used the paddle-wheel ship even during the First Opium War (1839–1842) and for transport around the Pearl River during the early 20th century.

== Seagoing paddle steamers ==

The first seagoing trip of a paddle steamer was by the &quot;Albany&quot; in 1808. It steamed from the Hudson River along the coast to the Delaware River. This was purely for the purpose of moving a river-boat to a new market, but paddle-steamers began regular short coastal trips soon after. In 1816 Pierre Andriel, a French businessman, bought in London the paddle steamer &quot;Margery&quot; (later renamed &quot;Elise&quot;) and made an eventful London-Le Havre-Paris crossing, encountering heavy weather on the way. He later operated his ship as a river packet on the Seine, between Paris and Le Havre.

In 1822 Charles Napier&#x27;s , the world&#x27;s first iron ship, made the first direct steam crossing from London to Paris and the first seagoing voyage by an iron ship. The first paddle-steamer to make a long ocean voyage crossing the Atlantic Ocean was , built in 1819 expressly for this service. &quot;Savannah&quot; set out from the port of Savannah, Georgia for Liverpool on May 24, 1819, sighting Ireland after 23 days at sea. This was the first powered crossing of the Atlantic, although &quot;Savannah&quot; was built as a sailing ship with a steam auxiliary; she also carried a full rig of sail for when winds were favorable, being unable to complete the voyage under power alone.

In 1838, , a fairly small steam packet built for the Cork to London route, became the first vessel to cross the Atlantic under sustained steam power, beating Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s much larger by a day. &quot;Great Western&quot;, however, was actually built for the transatlantic trade, and so had sufficient coal for the passage; &quot;Sirius&quot; had to burn furniture and other items after running out of coal. &quot;Great Western&quot;″s more successful crossing began the regular sailing of powered vessels across the Atlantic. was the first coastal steamship to operate in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Paddle steamers helped open Japan to the Western World in the mid-19th century.
The largest paddle-steamer ever built was Brunel&#x27;s , but it also had screw propulsion and sail rigging. It was long and weighed 32,000 tons, its paddlewheels being in diameter.

In oceangoing service, paddle steamers became much less useful after the invention of the screw propeller, but they remained in use in coastal service and as river tugboats, thanks to their shallow draught and good maneuverability.

The last crossing of the Atlantic by paddle steamer began on September 18, 1969, the first leg of a journey to conclude six months and nine days later. The steam paddle tug was never intended for oceangoing service, but nevertheless was steamed from Newcastle to San Francisco. As the voyage was intended to be completed under power, the tug was rigged as steam propelled with a sail auxiliary. The transatlantic stage of the voyage was completed exactly 150 years after the voyage of &quot;Savannah&quot;.

As of 2022, the PS Waverley is the last seagoing passenger-carrying paddle steamer in the world.

== Paddle-driven steam warships ==
===Paddle frigates===

Beginning in the 1820s, the British Royal Navy began building paddle-driven steam frigates and steam sloops. By 1850 these had become obsolete due to the development of the propeller – which was more efficient and less vulnerable to cannon fire. One of the first screw-driven warships, , demonstrated her superiority over paddle steamers during numerous trials, including one in 1845 where she pulled a paddle-driven sister ship backwards in a tug of war. However, paddle warships were used extensively by the Russian Navy during the Crimean War of 1853–1856, and by the United States Navy during the Mexican War of 1846–1848 and the American Civil War of 1861–1865. With the arrival of ironclad battleships from the late 1850s, the last remaining paddle frigates were decommissioned and sold into merchant-navy service by the 1870s. These included , which became one of the first Boston steamers in 1867. Other paddle frigates were converted to auxilliary roles, a notable example is , a troopship which was wrecked in 1852.

===Paddle minesweepers===

At the start of the First World War, the Royal Navy requisitioned more than fifty pleasure paddle steamers for use as auxiliary minesweepers. The large spaces on their decks intended for promenading passengers proved to be ideal for handling the minesweeping booms and cables, and the paddles allowed them to operate in coastal shallows and estuaries. These were so successful that a new class of paddle ships, the Racecourse-class minesweepers, were ordered and 32 of them were built before the end of the war.

In the Second World War, some thirty pleasure paddle steamers were again requisitioned; an added advantage was that their wooden hulls did not activate the new magnetic mines. The paddle ships formed six minesweeping flotillas, based at ports around the British coast. Other paddle steamers were converted to anti-aircraft ships. More than twenty paddle steamers were used as emergency troop transports during the Dunkirk Evacuation in 1940, where they were able to get close inshore to embark directly from the beach. One example was , which saved an estimated 7,000 men over the nine days of the evacuation, and claimed to have shot down three German aircraft. Another paddle minesweeper, , was deliberately beached twice to allow soldiers to cross to other vessels using her as a jetty. The paddle steamers between them were estimated to have rescued 26,000 Allied troops during the operation, for the loss of six of them. A number of paddle steamers participated in various roles in the Normandy landings in 1944 and supported the Allied advance along the coast of the Belgium and Holland.

<text>The flag of Guatemala, often referred to as the National Pavilion () or the Blue-and-White (), features two colors: sky blue and white. According to decree, the two sky blue stripes represents strength, justice, truth and loyalty. The white color signifies purity, integrity, firmness and light. The blue and white colors, like those of several other countries in the region, are based on the flag of the former Federal Republic of Central America.

In the center of the flag is the Guatemalan coat of arms. It includes the resplendent quetzal, the national bird of Guatemala that symbolizes liberty; a parchment scroll bearing the date of Central America&#x27;s independence from Spain, 15 September 1821; crossed Remington Rolling Block rifles, indicating Guatemala&#x27;s willingness to defend itself by force if need be; a bay laurel crown, the symbol for victory; and crossed swords, representing honor. It is one of four national flags among UN member states that features a firearm, along with those of Mozambique, Haiti, and Bolivia.

It is one of five national flags that use the ratio 5:8, with the others being Argentina, Palau, Poland, and Sweden.

== History ==

The Federal Republic of Central America flag was used in Guatemala until 1851, when a pro-Spanish faction took over and added the Spanish colors of red and yellow to the flag. The original colors were restored on 17 August 1871, but as vertical (rather than horizontal) stripes in order to distinguish it from other flags and with a new coat of arms.

The resplendent quetzal previously appeared in the 1830s in the flag of Los Altos, the sixth state in the Federal Republic.

In 2008 a flag called the &quot;Bandera de Los Pueblos&quot; (Flag of indigenous peoples) was adopted by law and is shown together with the national flag of Guatemala in all events featuring the President of Guatemala since then. The flag is divided in four parts, red, yellow, white and black, each colour representing Xinca people, Garifuna people, Maya people, and Ladino people, respectively.

These colours are also part of the &quot;Qanil&quot;, a Maya symbol in which each color represents a point of the compass, an element of nature and a part of the human being. &quot;Qanil&quot; means &quot;seed&quot; in Mayan languages, and is also one of the 20 days of the Maya calendar.
Aimed at promoting &quot;interculturality&quot; in Guatemala, the &quot;Bandera de los Pueblos&quot; was received with disinterest by the leaders of the peoples, who do not seem to have been consulted.

=== Promoting the flag ===
Since 1961, 17 August has been commemorated as Flag Day.

<doc id="334075" wikidata="Q867353" url="?curid=334075" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn">
<text>The Diocese of Brooklyn () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Catholic Church in the U.S. state of New York. It is headquartered in Brooklyn and its territory encompasses the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. The Diocese of Brooklyn is a suffragan diocese in the ecclesiastical province of the metropolitan Archdiocese of New York. The diocesan cathedral is the Cathedral Basilica of St. James in Downtown Brooklyn and its co-cathedral is the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Prospect Heights. The current Bishop of Brooklyn is Robert J. Brennan.

Brooklyn is one of the few dioceses in the United States that is made up of 100% urban territory.

The bishop of the Diocese of Brooklyn, presides from both the Cathedral Basilica of St. James and the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph. This atypical arrangement was required due to the small size of the Cathedral Basilica of St. James. St. Joseph&#x27;s Church was designated as a co-cathedral for the Diocese of Brooklyn on February 14, 2013, by Pope Benedict XVI after Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio petitioned the Vatican.

==History==
The diocese was established in 1853 out of the territory of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, at a time when Brooklyn was still a separate city from New York City. It originally included all of Long Island, but its present-day territory was established in 1957 when Nassau and Suffolk counties were split off to form the Diocese of Rockville Centre.

The opening of the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1801 drew a number of immigrants, largely Catholics from Northern Ireland, especially from Derry and Donegal. They would cross the East River to attend services at St. Peter&#x27;s Church on Barclay Street. Periodically, John Power or others would come to celebrate Mass at the home of William Purcell or at Dempsey&#x27;s Blooming Grove Garden on Fulton St. The Church of St. James was erected in 1822. In July, 1841, Johann Stephen Raffeiner, from the Tyrol, began the German parish of the Most Holy Trinity on a part of the farm of the old Dutch Meserole family in the Bushwick section. Holy Cross Cemetery was opened in 1849. In 1853, Archbishop John Hughes appointed his vicar-general, Irish-born John Loughlin, former pastor of St. Patrick&#x27;s on Mulberry St. as bishop of the new diocese. Loughlin chose St. James as his cathedral.

During his episcopate, Loughlin founded 120 parishes. Plans to build the larger Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception were deferred in favor of orphanages, schools, and hospitals. He was succeeded in 1892, by Bishop Charles Edward McDonnell, former chancellor of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn served at that time 250,000 Catholics. With the increase in the number of immigrants of various nationalities, McDonnell founded a number of national churches which ministered to parishioners in their own language. To this end, he invited several religious institutes into the diocese, including the Redemptorists, Benedictines, Franciscans (including the Minor Conventuals and Capuchins), Jesuits, Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth, Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart, Daughters of Wisdom, and Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus. He also built three hospitals. Camp Wycoff and Camp Black, set up during the Spanish–American War were attended by local clergy.

Thomas Edmund Molloy was named the third Bishop of Brooklyn on November 21, 1921. In 1930 Bishop Molloy established the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre was split off from Brooklyn April 6, 1957. Ten days later, Bryan Joseph McEntegart became the next Bishop of Brooklyn. He built six high schools, Cathedral Preparatory Seminary, and a hospital. He improved outreach to the growing Hispanic population, he sent priests and religious to study Spanish language and culture. Bishop Francis Mugavero experience as former head Brooklyn&#x27;s Catholic Charities was reflected in his episcopate. In 1971, Mugavero established the Catholic Migration Office to serve the needs of immigrants and refugees living in Brooklyn and Queens. The Nehemiah project produced affordable housing in Brownsville.

In September 2018, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn agreed to a record $27.5 million settlement for sex abuse allegations. On February 15, 2019, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens made public a list of 108 clergy who were &quot;credibly accused&quot; of committing sexual abuse, some of whom have also been convicted for their crimes. Along with the list, Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio also issued a letter of apology, asking for forgiveness. In June 2020, the FBI arrested Francis Hughes, a priest serving in Queens, on child pornography charges and sex-related charges involving underage minors. In a separate case, the Vatican exonerated Bishop DiMarzio of allegations of sexual abuse dating back a half century. After an inquiry led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said that the accusations were groundless.

<text>Haute cuisine (; ) or grande cuisine is a style of cooking characterised by meticulous preparation, elaborate presentation, and the use of high quality ingredients. Typically prepared by highly skilled gourmet chefs, haute cuisine dishes are renowned for their high quality and are often offered at premium prices. 

==Early history==
&quot;Haute cuisine&quot; represents the cooking and eating of carefully prepared food from regular and premium ingredients, prepared by specialized chefs, and commissioned by those with the financial wherewithal to do so. It has had a long evolution through the monarchy and the bourgeoisie and their ability to explore and afford prepared dishes with exotic and varied flavors and looking like architectural wonders. &quot;Haute cuisine&quot; distinguished itself from regular French cuisine by what was cooked and served, by obtaining premium ingredients such as fruit out of season, and by using ingredients not typically found in France.

Trained kitchen staff was essential to the birth of &quot;haute cuisine&quot; in France, which was organized at the turn of the 20th century by August Escoffier into the brigade de cuisine. The extravagant presentations and complex techniques that came from these kitchens required ingredients, time, equipment, and therefore money. For this reason, early &quot;haute cuisine&quot; was accessible to a small demographic of rich and powerful individuals. Not only were professional chefs responsible for building and shaping &quot;haute cuisine&quot;, but their role in the cuisine was what differentiated it from regular French cuisine.

&quot;Haute cuisine&quot; is influenced by French cuisine with elaborate preparations and presentations that serves small, multiple courses prepared by a hierarchical kitchen staff, historically at the grand restaurants and hotels of Europe. The cuisine was very rich and opulent, with decadent sauces made out of butter, cream, and flour, the basis for many typical French sauces still in use today. The 17th-century chef and writer La Varenne (1615–1678) marked a change from cookery as known in the Middle Ages, to somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations. Subsequently, Antonin Carême (1784–1833) also published works on cooking, and he simplified and codified an earlier and even more complex cuisine. Nineteenth-century French &quot;haute cuisine&quot; interacted with the development of fine dining in Britain. French master chef, Jassintour Rozea (1721-1783) wrote several culinary books on haute cuisine (The Gift of Comus, 1752, and The Compleat Cook, Market Woman &amp; Dairy Maid, 1756 - Library of Congress, USA) was also master chef to Charles Seymour, 6th. Duke of Somerset and had subsequent positions at the stately homes of the Duke of Montrose, the Duke of Roxburgh, the Lords Hervey &amp; Edgecombe, and later John Hope, Earl of Hopetoun House, Edinburgh. Jassintour was renowned both in London &amp; Edinburgh for his glorious banquets attended by European aristocrats in the expected French tradition.

Contrary to popular belief, Catherine de&#x27; Medici did not introduce Italian food to the French court to create haute cuisine.

==&quot;Cuisine classique&quot;==
Georges Auguste Escoffier is a central figure in the modernisation of &quot;haute cuisine&quot; as of about 1900, which became known as &quot;cuisine classique&quot;. These were simplifications and refinements of the early work of Carême, Jules Gouffé and Urbain Dubois. It was practised in the grand restaurants and hotels of Europe and elsewhere for much of the 20th century. The major developments were to replace service &quot;à la française&quot; (serving all dishes at once) with service &quot;à la russe&quot; (serving meals in courses) and to develop a system of cookery, based on Escoffier&#x27;s &quot;Le Guide Culinaire&quot;, which formalized the preparation of sauces and dishes. In its time, it was considered the pinnacle of &quot;haute cuisine&quot;, and was a style distinct from &quot;cuisine bourgeoise&quot; (the cuisine of affluent city dwellers), the working-class cuisine of bistros and homes, and cuisines of the French provinces.

==Nouvelle cuisine==

The 1960s were marked by the appearance of &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot;, as chefs rebelled from Escoffier&#x27;s &quot;orthodoxy&quot; and complexity. Although the term &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot; had been used in the past, the modern usage can be attributed to authors André Gayot, Henri Gault, and Christian Millau, who used &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot; to describe the cooking of Paul Bocuse, Alain Chapel, Jean and Pierre Troisgros, Michel Guérard, Roger Vergé and Raymond Oliver, many of whom were once students of Fernand Point.

In general, &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot; puts an emphasis on natural flavours, so the freshest possible ingredients are used, preparation is simplified, heavy sauces are less common, as are strong marinades for meat, and cooking times are often reduced. &quot;Nouvelle cuisine&quot; was a movement towards conceptualism and minimalism and was a direct juxtaposition to earlier &quot;haute cuisine&quot; styles of cooking, which were much more extravagant. While menus were increasingly short, dishes used more inventive pairings and relied on inspiration from regional dishes.
Within 20 years, however, chefs began returning to the earlier style of &quot;haute cuisine&quot;, although many of the new techniques remained.

<text>Idriss Déby Itno ( &quot;&quot;; 18 June 1952 – 20 April 2021) was a Chadian politician and military officer who was the 6th president of Chad from 1991 until his death in 2021 during the Northern Chad offensive. His term of office of more than 30 years makes him Chad&#x27;s longest-serving president.

Déby was a member of the Bidayat clan of the Zaghawa ethnic group. A high-ranking commander of President Hissène Habré&#x27;s military during the 1980s, Déby played important roles in the Toyota War which led to Chad&#x27;s victory during the Chadian-Libyan War. He was later purged by Habré after being suspected of plotting a coup, and was forced into exile in Libya. He took power by leading a coup d&#x27;état against Habré in December 1990. Despite introducing a multi-party system in 1992 after several decades of one-party rule under his predecessors, throughout his presidency, his Patriotic Salvation Movement was the dominant party. Déby won presidential elections in 1996 and 2001, and after term limits were eliminated he won again in 2006, 2011, 2016, and 2021.

During the Second Congo War, Déby briefly ordered military intervention on the side of the Congolese government but soon withdrew when his forces were accused of looting and human rights abuses. In the early 2000s, oil was discovered in Chad, and Déby made petroleum production the driving force of the country&#x27;s economy. He survived various rebellions and coup attempts against his own rule, including a rebellion led by his former defense minister Youssouf Togoïmi from 1998 to 2002 as well as a civil war from 2005–2010 provoked by the refugee crisis of the War in Darfur in neighboring Sudan.

Several international media sources have described Déby as authoritarian. During his three decades in office, Chad experienced democratic backsliding, as well as widespread corruption, including cronyism, embezzlement, and a deeply entrenched patronage system. In 2016, the Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT) was established with the goal of overthrowing Déby&#x27;s government. In April 2021, FACT initiated the Northern Chad offensive; Déby was injured on 19 April while commanding troops on the frontline fighting the militants and died the following day.

==Early life==
Déby was born on 18 June 1952, in the village of Berdoba, approximately 190 kilometers from Fada in northern Chad. His father was a herdsman of the Bidayat clan of the Zaghawa community. After attending the Qur&#x27;anic School in Tiné, Déby studied at the École Française in Fada and at the Franco-Arab school (&quot;Lycée Franco-Arabe&quot;) in Abéché. He also attended the Lycée Jacques Moudeina in Bongor and held a bachelor&#x27;s degree in science.

After finishing school, he entered the Officers&#x27; School in N&#x27;Djamena. From there he was sent to France for training, returning to Chad in 1976 with a professional pilot certificate. He remained loyal to the army and President Félix Malloum even after Chad&#x27;s central authority crumbled in 1979. He returned from France in February 1979 and found Chad had become a battleground for many armed groups. Déby tied his fortunes to those of Hissène Habré, one of the chief Chadian warlords. A year after Habré became president in 1982, Déby was made commander-in-chief of the army.

He distinguished himself in 1984 by destroying pro-Libyan forces in eastern Chad. In 1985, Habré sent him to Paris to follow a course at the École de Guerre and upon his return in 1986, he was made chief military advisor to the president. In 1987, he confronted Libyan forces on the field, with the help of France in the so-called &quot;Toyota War&quot;, adopting tactics that inflicted heavy losses on enemy forces. During the war, he also led a raid on Maaten al-Sarra Air Base in Kufrah, in Libyan territory. A rift emerged on 1 April 1989 between Habré and Déby over the increasing power of the Presidential Guard.

According to Human Rights Watch, Habré was found responsible for &quot;widespread political killings, systematic torture, and thousands of arbitrary arrests&quot;, as well as ethnic purges when it was perceived that group leaders could pose a threat to his rule, including many of Déby&#x27;s Zaghawa ethnic group who supported the government. Increasingly paranoid, Habré accused Déby, minister of the interior Mahamat Itno, and then commander-in-chief of the Chadian army Hassan Djamous of preparing a coup d&#x27;état. Déby fled first to Darfur, then to Libya, where he was welcomed by Muammar Gaddafi in Tripoli. Itno and Djamous were arrested and killed. Since all three were ethnic Zaghawa, Habré started a targeted campaign against the group which saw hundreds seized, tortured, and imprisoned. Dozens died in detention or were summarily executed. In 2016, Habré was convicted of war crimes by a specially created international tribunal in Senegal. Déby gave the Libyans detailed information about CIA operations in Chad. Gaddafi offered Déby military aid to seize power in Chad in exchange for Libyan prisoners of war.

Déby relocated to Sudan in 1989 and formed the Patriotic Salvation Movement, an insurgent group, supported by Libya and Sudan, which started operations against Habré, and on 2 December 1990 Déby&#x27;s troops marched unopposed into N&#x27;Djamena in a successful coup, ousting Habré.

==Presidency==

Idriss Déby assumed Chad&#x27;s presidency in 1991. He was re-elected every five years up until the time of his death in 2021, equaling a total of 30 years in power.

===1990s===
After three months of the provisional government, on 28 February 1991, a charter was approved for Chad with Déby as president. During the following two years, Déby faced a series of coup attempts as government forces clashed with pro-Habré rebel groups, such as the Movement for Democracy and Development (MDD). Seeking to quell dissent, in 1993 Chad legalized political parties and held a National Conference which resulted in the gathering of 750 delegates, the government, trade unions, and the army to discuss the establishment of a pluralist democracy.

However, unrest continued. The Comité de Sursaut National pour la Paix et la Démocratie (CSNPD), led by Lt. Moise Kette, and other southern groups sought to prevent the Déby government from exploiting oil in the Doba Basin and started a rebellion that left hundreds dead. A peace agreement was reached in 1994, but it broke down soon thereafter. Two new groups, the Armed Forces for a Federal Republic (FARF) led by former Kette ally Laokein Barde, and the Democratic Front for Renewal (FDR), and a reformulated MDD clashed with government forces from 1994 to 1995.

Déby, in the mid-1990s, gradually restored basic functions of government and entered into agreements with the World Bank and IMF to carry out substantial economic reforms.

A new constitution was approved by referendum in March 1996, followed by a presidential election in June. Déby fell short of a majority; he was then elected president in the second round of votes held in July, with 69% of the vote.

In 1998 the MDJT rebelled against Déby and his government. They signed a peace agreement in 2002.

===2000s===
Déby was re-elected in the May 2001 presidential election, winning in the first round with 63.17% of the vote, according to official results. A civil war between Christians and Muslims erupted in 2005, accompanied by tensions with Sudan. An attempted coup d&#x27;état, involving the shooting down of Déby&#x27;s plane, was foiled in March 2006.

In mid-April 2006, there was fighting with rebels at N&#x27;Djaména, although the fighting soon subsided with government forces still in control of the capital. Déby subsequently broke ties with Sudan, accusing it of backing the rebels, and said that the May 2006 election would still take place.

Déby was sworn in for another term in office on 8 August 2006. Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir attended Déby&#x27;s inauguration, and the two leaders agreed to restore diplomatic relations on this occasion.

After Déby&#x27;s re-election, several rebel groups broke apart. Déby was in Abéché from 11 to 21 September 2006, flying in a helicopter to personally oversee attacks on Rally of Democratic Forces rebels.

The rebellion in the east continued, and rebels reached N&#x27;Djamena on 2 February 2008, with fighting occurring inside the city. After days of fighting, the government remained in control of N&#x27;Djamena. Speaking at a press conference on 6 February, Déby said that his forces had defeated the rebels, whom he described as &quot;mercenaries directed by Sudan&quot;, and that his forces were in &quot;total control&quot; of the city as well as the whole country.

Against this backdrop, in June 2005, a successful referendum was held to eliminate a two-term constitutional limit, which enabled Déby to run again in 2006. More than 77% of voters approved. Déby was a candidate in the 2006 presidential election, held 3 May, which was greeted with an opposition boycott. According to official results Déby won the election with 64.67% of the vote.

In 2000, with the north/south dispute quelled, Déby&#x27;s government started building the country&#x27;s first oil pipeline, the 1,070 kilometer Chad-Cameroon project. The pipeline was completed in 2003 and praised by the World Bank as &quot;an unprecedented framework to transform oil wealth into direct benefits for the poor, the vulnerable and the environment&quot;.

Oil exploitation in the southern Doba region began in June 2000, with World Bank Board approval to finance a small portion of a project, the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development Project, aimed at transport of Chadian crude through a 1000-km buried pipeline through Cameroon to the Gulf of Guinea. The project established unique mechanisms for World Bank, private sector, government, and civil society collaboration to guarantee that future oil revenues benefit populations and result in poverty alleviation.

However, with Chad receiving only 12.5% of profits from oil production, and the agreement for these revenues to be deposited into a London-based Citibank escrow account monitored by an independent body to ensure the funds were used for public services and development, not much wealth was immediately transferred to the country.

During the Chad–Sudan conflict, Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir supported any rebel group fighting against the Chadian government, and the proxy war saw opposition fighting on both sides. Déby visited Khartoum in February 2010 and the leaders would meet again in July 2010 when Bashir visited N&#x27;Djamena. These meetings resulted in Chad kicking out rebels while both counties committed to joint border patrols. After Déby won the 2011 Chadian presidential election, Omar al-Bashir decided to visit N&#x27;Djamena to attend his inauguration in August. Even though Chad was technically able to arrest al-Bashir, it and other African states declined to do so.

===2010s===

On 25 April 2011, Déby was re-elected for a fourth term with 88.7% of the vote and reappointed Emmanuel Nadingar as Prime Minister.

Because of Chad&#x27;s strategic position in West Africa, Déby sent troops or played a key mediating role in tackling multiple regional crises, such as Darfur, the Central African Republic (CAR), Mali, as well as the fight against Boko Haram.

With the security situation in the Central African Republic deteriorating, Déby decided in 2012 to deploy 400 troops to fight the CAR rebels. In January 2013, Chad also sent 2000 troops to fight Islamist groups in Mali, as part of France&#x27;s Operation Serval.

In 2006, Chad was placed at the top of the list of the world&#x27;s most corrupt nations by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, In 2012, Déby launched a nationwide anticorruption campaign called Operation Cobra, which reportedly recovered some $50 million in embezzled funds. Nongovernmental organizations say, however, that Déby has used such initiatives to punish rivals and reward cronies. As of 2016, Transparency International ranked Chad 147 out of 168 nations on its corruption index.

Faced with a growing threat from Boko Haram, Déby increased Chad&#x27;s participation in the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), a combined multinational formation comprising units from Niger, Nigeria, Benin, and Cameroon. In August 2015, Déby claimed in an interview that the MNJTF has successfully &quot;decapitated&quot; Boko Haram.

In January 2016, Déby succeeded Zimbabwe&#x27;s Robert Mugabe to become the chairman of the African Union for a one-year term. Upon his inauguration, Déby told presidents that conflicts around the continent had to end &quot;Through diplomacy or by force... We must put an end to these tragedies of our time. We cannot make progress and talk of development if part of our body is sick. We should be the main actors in the search for solution to Africa&#x27;s crises&quot;. One of Déby&#x27;s first priorities was to accelerate the fight against Boko Haram. On 4 March, the African Union agreed to expand the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) to 10,000 troops.

During the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, Idriss Déby raised the issue of Lake Chad, whose area was a small fraction of what it had been in 1973, and called on the international community to provide financing to protect the ecosystem.

In February 2016, Déby was nominated by the Patriotic Salvation Movement to run for a new term in the April 2016 Presidential elections. He pledged to reinstate term limits in the Constitution of Chad in saying that &quot;We must limit terms, we must not concentrate on a system in which a change in power becomes difficult. &quot;In 2005 the constitutional reform was conducted in a context where life of the nation was in danger&quot;.

In 2017, the United States Justice Department alleged Déby accepted a $2 million bribe in return for providing a People&#x27;s Republic of China company with an opportunity to obtain oil rights in Chad without international competition.

In January 2019, Déby and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the resumption of diplomatic relations between Chad and Israel. Netanyahu described his visit to Chad as “part of the revolution we are having in the Arab and Muslim world.”

===Final years===

Déby signed a bill abolishing capital punishment in 2020. The firing squad had last been used on terrorists in 2015.

In March 2020, Déby set up a COVID-19 management committee, replacing the health monitoring unit.

In June 2020, the National Assembly bestowed Déby with the additional title of &quot;Marshal of Chad&quot;, for &quot;service rendered to the Nation and the numerous military victories won both inside and outside the country&quot;. He officially received the title during a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of Chad&#x27;s independence on 11 August.

In February 2021, Déby announced Chad would send 1,200 soldiers alongside French troops to the Sahel border between Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso, to combat al-Qaeda linked groups.

===Death===
In the 2021 presidential election, Déby won his sixth term as president, when results were announced on 19 April, with 79.32% of the votes. In February earlier in the same year, Chadian security forces had attempted to arrest opposition leader Yaya Dillo Djérou, with Djérou claiming five members of his family were killed during this attempt, and the government instead reporting three were killed. Most political opponents had withdrawn from the election, urging a boycott, alleging attacks and excessive use of force by security forces during anti-government protests. Instead of giving a victory speech, Déby went to command the Chadian soldiers in person on the frontlines fighting the northern rebel incursion by the Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT).

According to the accounts from both military and rebel spokesmen, on 18 April he was said to have been caught in a crossfire in the village of Mele, near the town of Nokou, and sustained lethal gunshot injuries; despite being immediately flown to the capital for emergency medical rescue, he still succumbed to his wounds two days later and died on 20 April, at the age of 68.

The Chadian Parliament and Government were both dissolved upon his death and a Transitional Military Council was formed in its place with his son Mahamat Déby Itno as chairman. In addition, the Constitution of Chad was suspended and replaced by a new charter. The government ordered a fourteen-day national mourning with flags half-masted and closed public institutions and educational establishments for several days. A three-day national mourning was announced in Mali and South Sudan; one day of mourning was declared in Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea and Republic of the Congo.

Déby&#x27;s funeral took place on 23 April 2021. On that day, thousands gathered in the streets of N&#x27;Djamena to pay their respects to Déby. French President Emmanuel Macron, Guinean President Alpha Condé, and several other African leaders attended the funeral.

==Personal life==
Déby added &quot;Itno&quot; to his surname in January 2006. He was a graduate of Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s World Revolutionary Center.

Déby was polygamous and had four wives by 2018 – Zina Wazouna Ahmed Idriss, Hadja Halimé, Hinda Déby Itno (m. 2005), and Amani Musa Hila (m. 2012). BBC News has also mentioned a fifth wife named Ali Bouye. Déby had at least a dozen children.

In September 2005, Déby married Hinda (born 1977), who was reputed for her beauty. This marriage attracted much attention in Chad, and due to tribal affiliations it was seen by many as a strategic means for Déby to bolster his support while under pressure from rebels. Though she was not Déby&#x27;s oldest or newest wife, Hinda Déby was considered the &quot;First Lady of Chad&quot; due to her influential positions in government and politics. Hinda was a member of the Civil Cabinet of the Presidency, serving as Special Secretary. The daughter of a top Chadian diplomat, Hinda Déby Itno has dual Chadian and French citizenship. She and Déby had five children, all born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, who also hold French nationality.

On 21 January 2012, Déby married his most recent wife, Amani Musa Hila, a Sudanese national, member of Idriss Déby&#x27;s Zaghawa tribe, and daughter of Janjaweed militia leader Musa Hilal in Darfur. The marriage was seen as a way to strengthen bilateral ties between Chad and Sudan following a 2010 agreement to normalize diplomatic relations.

On 2 July 2007, Déby&#x27;s son, Brahim, was found dead aged 27 in the parking garage of his apartment near Paris. A murder inquiry was launched by the French police. Blogger Makaila Nguebla attributes the defection of many Chadian government leaders to their indignation over Brahim&#x27;s conduct: &quot;He is at the root of all the frustration. He used to slap government ministers, senior Chadian officials were humiliated by Déby&#x27;s son.&quot; In July 2011, four men were convicted of &quot;robbery leading to death without intention to kill&quot; in the case and sentenced to prison sentences of between five and thirteen years.

Déby was a practicing Muslim.

<text>Giambattista Bodoni (, ; 16 February 1740 – 30 November 1813) was an Italian typographer, type-designer, compositor, printer, and publisher in Parma.

He first took the type-designs of Pierre Simon Fournier as his exemplars, but afterwards became an admirer of the more modelled types of John Baskerville; and he and Firmin Didot evolved a style of type called &quot;Modern&quot;, in which the letters are cut in such a way as to produce a strong contrast between the thick and thin parts of their body. Bodoni designed many typefaces, each one in a large range of type sizes. He is even more admired as a compositor than as a type designer, as the large range of sizes which he cut enabled him to compose his pages with the greatest possible subtlety of spacing. Like Baskerville, he sets off his texts with wide margins and uses little or no illustrations or decorations.

Bodoni achieved an unprecedented level of technical refinement, allowing him to faithfully reproduce letterforms with very thin &quot;hairlines&quot;, standing in sharp contrast to the thicker lines constituting the main stems of the characters. He became known for his designs of pseudoclassical typefaces and highly styled editions, some considered more apt &quot;to be admired for typeface and layout, not to be studied or read&quot;. His printing reflected an aesthetic of plain, unadorned style, combined with purity of materials. This style attracted many admirers and imitators, surpassing the popularity of French typographers such as Philippe Grandjean and Pierre Simon Fournier. Bodoni has also had his share of detractors, including William Morris, who felt that his almost mechanical perfection seemed cold and inhumane.

There have been several modern revivals of his typefaces, all called &quot;Bodoni&quot;. They are often used as display faces.

==Biography==

===Childhood in Saluzzo (1740–1758)===

Bodoni&#x27;s birthplace is set in the foothills of the Cottian Alps, in what was then Kingdom of Sardinia, and is now Piedmont. He was the seventh child and fourth son of Francesco Agostino Bodoni and Paola Margherita Giolitti. His father and grandfather were both printers in Saluzzo, and as a child his toys were his grandfather&#x27;s leftover punches and matrices. He learned the printing trade working at his father&#x27;s side, and his gift for wood-engraving and printing was evident very early. So was his ambition and liveliness. At the age of 17 he decided to travel to Rome with the intention of securing fame and fortune as a printer. He left Saluzzo on 8 February 1758.

===Training in Rome (1758–1766)===
In Rome, Bodoni found work as an assistant compositor (typesetter) at the press of the Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide (The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples), the missionary arm of the Vatican. He flourished under the careful supervision of Cardinal Giuseppe Spinelli, the prefect of the Propaganda Fide, and Costantino Ruggieri, the superintendent of the press. One of his first tasks was sorting and cleaning punches in a wide variety of Middle Eastern and Asian languages. Bodoni quickly demonstrated his gift for exotic languages and, as a result, he was sent to study Hebrew and Arabic at “La Sapienza,” (Sapienza University of Rome). Bodoni soon became the press&#x27;s compositor of foreign languages, and began to typeset books. Spinelli and Ruggieri were so delighted with his work on the &quot;Pontificale Arabo-Copto&quot; that they allowed him to add his name and birthplace to subsequent printings. He then began cutting his own punches.

After eight years at the Propaganda Fide press, Bodoni&#x27;s remarkable skill was renowned, but he was ripe for change. Saddened by the death of Spinelli and Ruggieri&#x27;s tragic suicide, and encouraged by British friends, he left Rome for England, a country which, under the influence of Baskerville whose books were much admired on the Continent, had become a leader in printing innovation. Bodoni&#x27;s plan was summarily scotched by sickness; on his journey north, he succumbed to Tertian fever (malaria), and returned home to Saluzzo to recuperate.

===Life and work in Parma (1768–1813)===
After convalescing in Saluzzo, Bodoni started working with his father again. Meanwhile, in Parma, the young duke, Don Ferdinando di Borbone (Duke Ferdinand of Parma), and the prime minister, Guillaume du Tillot, were making plans to start a royal press. They wanted someone hardworking and talented to set it up and run it. Father Paolo Maria Paciaudi, the librarian at Parma, who had known Bodoni in Rome, put the young man&#x27;s name forward. In February 1768, with the permission of Duke Vittorio Amedo III of Savoy, Bodoni left Saluzzo for the court of Parma.

He started work right away. The challenge was tremendous; he needed help, so wrote to two of his brothers to come from Saluzzo to assist him. One of them, Giuseppe, remained by his side at the press in Parma for over 30 years. In tandem with Du Tillot, Bodoni acquired everything necessary for a printing business of the highest order: presses, paper, ink, tools, and he ordered type from Fournier in France. He used Fournier&#x27;s letters for early work published in Parma, gradually replacing it with his own imitations of Fournier, and eventually developing his own style.

His first major publication at the royal press was the extravagant volume in celebration of the wedding of the duke of Parma to Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria, &quot;Descrizione delle Feste Celebrate in Parma per le Auguste Nozze . . .&quot;As an example of its kind, it remains unsurpassed in its beauty and printing technique, and it showed the rest of Europe that the young Italian was a printer to be reckoned with.

Several major presentation volumes would follow, along with the various publications required by the court: announcements, invitations, posters, and many sonnets written by those who wished their work to be printed by the great Bodoni. He also began a series of specimen volumes, the first of which, &quot;Fregi e majuscule&quot; (1771) was in direct imitation of Fournier. His &quot;Manuale tipografico&quot; of 1788 paved the way for his masterwork, the &quot;Manuale tipografico&quot; of 1818, published posthumously by his widow.

Other cities tried to woo Bodoni away from Parma. Other patrons wished to oust the duke. The most formidable of these was José Nicolás de Azara, the Spanish ambassador to Rome. He felt Bodoni was wasting himself on unimportant work for the duke when he should instead be printing gorgeous editions of the classics. Bodoni was tempted by the offer to move to Rome, but in 1791, when the duke realized the seriousness of the threat, he offered Bodoni his own private press where he could print whatever he wished for whomever he wished. Bodoni had no desire to leave comfortable Parma, where he had just married (at the age of 51) Margherita Dall’Aglio, a local woman 18 years his junior. He remained in Parma for the rest of his life, running both ducal and private presses, and printing editions of the classics for Azara and other patrons.

In the years following 1791, Bodoni produced much of his greatest work, including the great classics of Horace, Virgil, Anacreon, Tasso, and Homer, among others. Napoleon was so delighted with the gift of Bodoni&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; that he made him a Chevalier of the Order of the Reunion and gave him a pension for life.

The duke of Parma died suddenly and mysteriously in 1802, the duchess fled to Prague, and the French swooped in to fill the vacuum. Bodoni, who lived to work, was apolitical and had no trouble in allying himself with the new régime.

His fame became comparable to that of today&#x27;s rock star. Visitors flocked to his print works on the banks of the river Parma, wanting a glimpse of him working in his studio. Benjamin Franklin, a printer himself, wrote a fan letter. In 1805, even the emperor Napoleon and empress Josephine visited the city and asked to see him; alas, that very day Bodoni was confined to bed with a disastrous attack of gout, a disease that was to plague him until the end of his life.

On his trip to Paris to crown Napoleon emperor, Pope Pius VII had been impressed by a copy of Jean-Joseph Marcel&#x27;s &quot;Oratio Dominica&quot;, which contained the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in 150 languages. Visiting Bodoni on his way back to Rome, he challenged him to surpass the Frenchman&#x27;s achievement. Bodoni took up the challenge, and in 1806 he was able to present the Pope with an &quot;Oratio Dominica&quot; in 155 languages.

Before his death on 30 November 1813, Bodoni had started work on a series of French classics for his new patron, Joachim Murat, Napoleon&#x27;s brother-in-law. The &quot;Théatre Complet de Jean Racine&quot; was on the press on the day of his death. His favorite title page was the one for &quot;Boileau Despréaux.&quot; He had to cut the type expressly for the title to fit on one line. It would be up to Bodoni&#x27;s widow to complete the series.

Margherita Dall’Aglio Bodoni picked up where her husband left off, completed the French classics, and then five years after Bodoni died, published the &quot;Manuale typografico&quot; of 1818, the specimen book to end all specimen books. Published in two volumes, it was over 600 pages long and contained 265 pages of roman characters, “imperceptibly declining in size, romans, italics, and script types, and the series of 125 capital letters; 181 pages of Greek and Oriental characters; 1036 decorations and 31 borders; followed in the last 20 pages by symbols, ciphers, numerals, and musical examples.”

==Since 1813==

<text>Kenneth Lewis Roberts (December 8, 1885 – July 21, 1957) was an American writer of historical novels. He worked first as a journalist, becoming nationally known for his work with the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; from 1919 to 1928, and then as a popular novelist. Born in Kennebunk, Maine, Roberts specialized in regionalist historical fiction, often writing about his native state and its terrain and also about other upper New England states and scenes. For example, the main characters in &quot;Arundel&quot; and &quot;Rabble in Arms&quot; are from Kennebunkport (then called Arundel), the main character in &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; is from Kittery, Maine and has friends in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and the main character in &quot;Oliver Wiswell&quot; is from Milton, Massachusetts.

==Early life==
Roberts graduated in 1908 from Cornell University, where he wrote the lyrics for two Cornell fight songs, including &quot;Fight for Cornell&quot;. He was also a member of the Quill and Dagger society. He was later awarded honorary doctorates from three New England colleges: Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire; Colby College, in Waterville, Maine; and Middlebury College, in Middlebury, Vermont.

==Journalism==
After graduation, Roberts spent eight years working as a newspaperman for the &quot;Boston Post&quot;. In 1917, he enlisted in the U.S. army for World War I. He was assigned to intelligence and promoted to a lieutenant, serving with that section in the American Expeditionary Force Siberia during the Russian Civil War, rather than at the European front. 

The contacts that he made in that role enabled him to become a European correspondent for the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; after the war. He was the first American journalist to cover the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s failed attempt to seize power. Roberts described working for the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s legendary editor George Horace Lorimer as follows: &quot;I told him my ideas, which he instantly rejected or accepted ... The price to be paid for a story was never discussed, and Lorimer was always generous.&quot;

==Historical fiction==

Writer Booth Tarkington, a neighbor of Roberts in Kennebunkport, Maine, convinced him that he would never find the time to succeed as a novelist while working as a journalist. Tarkington agreed to help by editing Roberts&#x27;s early novels. Although Roberts continued to sell a few essays to the &quot;Post&quot;, his next few years were largely dedicated to historical fiction. 

Ultimately, Tarkington edited all of Roberts&#x27;s novels through &quot;Oliver Wiswell&quot; (1940). Roberts said in his autobiography that he offered Tarkington co-writing credit on both &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; and &quot;Oliver Wiswell&quot; in acknowledgement of Tarkington&#x27;s extensive revisions to each. He also dedicated both those novels and &quot;Rabble in Arms&quot; to Tarkington. The author continued to assist Roberts until his death in 1946.

Roberts&#x27;s historical fiction often focused on rehabilitating unpopular persons and causes in American history. A key character in &quot;Arundel&quot; and &quot;Rabble in Arms&quot; is the American officer and eventual traitor Benedict Arnold, with Roberts focusing on Arnold&#x27;s expedition to Quebec and the Battle of Quebec in the first novel and the Battle of Valcour Island, the Saratoga campaign and the Battles of Saratoga in the second. Meanwhile, the hero of &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; was Major Robert Rogers and his company, Rogers&#x27; Rangers, although Rogers fought for the British during the American Revolutionary War. &quot;Oliver Wiswell&quot; focuses on a Loyalist officer during the American Revolution and covers the entire war, from famous events such as the Siege of Boston, the Battle of Bunker Hill, the New York and New Jersey campaign through the Battle of Fort Washington, and the Franco-American alliance, to less-remembered events such as the Convention Army, the exodus to Kentucky County, the Siege of Ninety-Six, and the resettlement of the United Empire Loyalists, as well as providing a later look at both a dissolute Rogers and a frustrated Arnold among the British.

George Orwell reviewed &quot;The Lively Lady&quot; in the &quot;New English Weekly&quot; in 1936, describing it as &quot; stuff ... chiefly interesting as showing that the old-fashioned nineteenth-century type of American bumptiousness ... is still going strong.&quot;

As a result of his research into the Arnold expedition, Roberts published a work of nonfiction, &quot;March to Quebec: Journals of the Members of Arnold&#x27;s Expedition&quot;, a compilation of journals and letters written by participants in the march. During Roberts&#x27;s research into Major Rogers, his researcher uncovered transcripts of both of Rogers&#x27;s courts-martial (once as the accuser and once as the accused), which had been thought lost for over a century, and these were published in the second volume of a special two-volume edition of &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;. He and his wife Anna translated into English the French writer Médéric Louis Élie Moreau de Saint-Méry&#x27;s account of his journey through America in the 1790s. His last published work was &quot;The Battle of Cowpens&quot;, a brief history of that battle, issued after his death, in 1958.

One of Lorimer&#x27;s last acts as editor of the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; was to serialize &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; in 1936 and 1937. As a result of the success of the serialization, the book, when published, became the second-best-selling novel in 1937 and fifth best for the year 1938. &quot;Oliver Wiswell&quot; also spent two years in the top ten (1940 and 1941), and &quot;Lydia Bailey&quot; reached the top ten in 1947. One of Roberts&#x27;s closest friends and neighbors, the novelist A. Hamilton Gibbs, later stated that he believed that Roberts probably &quot;wrote himself out&quot; after &quot;Oliver Wiswell&quot; and certainly had done so after &quot;Lydia Bailey&quot;.

Key historical novels by Roberts and their topics include the following:

*&quot;Arundel&quot; (1929), on the American Revolution through the Battle of Quebec
*&quot;The Lively Lady&quot; (1931), on the War of 1812
*&quot;Rabble in Arms&quot; (1933), the sequel to &quot;Arundel&quot;, on the American Revolution through the Battles of Saratoga
*&quot;Captain Caution&quot; (1934), on the War of 1812
*&quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1937), on the French and Indian War and the Jonathan Carver expedition
*&quot;Oliver Wiswell&quot; (1940), on the American Revolution from a Loyalist&#x27;s perspective, from the Siege of Boston to the United Empire Loyalists
*&quot;Lydia Bailey&quot; (1947), on the Haitian Revolution and the First Barbary War
*&quot;Boon Island&quot; (1955), on a 1710 shipwreck on Boon Island, Maine

In 1957, two months before his death, Roberts received a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation &quot;for his historical novels which have long contributed to the creation of greater interest in our early American history.&quot; He died, aged 71, in Kennebunkport.

==Controversies==
===Immigration===
While a reporter for the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; in the early 1920s, Roberts wrote many magazine articles and a book during the period immediately following World War I that urged strong legal restrictions on immigration from eastern and southern Europe and from Mexico. He warned of the dangers of immigration from places other than northwestern Europe. He became a leading voice for stricter immigration laws and testified before a congressional committee on the subject. 

He wrote:
:“If America doesn’t keep out the queer alien mongrelized people of Southern and Eastern Europe, her crop of citizens will eventually be dwarfed and mongrelized in turn.”

In &quot;Why Europe Leaves Home,&quot; derived from his &quot;Post&quot; articles, Roberts referred to Jews as &quot;human parasites&quot;. He was separately quoted warning against further &quot;Semitic&quot; immigration to America, which he feared would turn the U.S. population into a &quot;worthless and futile&quot; hybrid race.

===Florida land boom===
Three of Roberts&#x27;s first books were written at least in part to promote the Florida land boom of the 1920s. They were &quot;Sun Hunting&quot; (1922), &quot;Florida Loafing&quot; (1925), and &quot;Florida&quot; (1926). Many people lost a lot of money in the bust that followed. These books were usually omitted from the lists of “other books by this author” published in the front pages of his later works.

===Dowsing===
In the 1940s, Roberts became acquainted with Henry Gross, a retired Maine game warden and amateur water dowser. He and Gross began a long association to use Gross&#x27;s claimed dowsing abilities to find deposits of water, petroleum, uranium, and diamonds, through a corporation named Water Unlimited, Inc. Roberts documented his experiences in three nonfiction books that were popular successes but were strongly criticized by the scientific community. He joked that he should have given &quot;The Seventh Sense&quot; the subtitle &quot;Or How to Lose Friends and Alienate People.&quot;

===Maine cooking===
When Roberts was working on &quot;Trending Into Maine&quot;, he published a chapter in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; that was dedicated to dishes he remembered having as a boy growing up in Maine. Several months after the chapter was published, he began to receive mail from residents and ex-residents who were troubled that he neglected to mention many of the dishes they knew and loved from the Pine Tree State. Roberts was distressed by the letters but decided to keep them, and they were eventually compiled by his secretary, Marjorie Mosser. She eventually included many of the letters and provide recipes in the cookbook &quot;Good Maine Food&quot;, which was first published in 1939. Roberts wrote the introduction to the book and a chapter on diet.

<text>Adrian Johann Frutiger (; 24 May 1928 – 10 September 2015) was a Swiss typeface designer who influenced the direction of type design in the second half of the 20th century. His career spanned the hot metal, phototypesetting and digital typesetting eras. Until his death, he lived in Bremgarten bei Bern.

Frutiger&#x27;s most famous designs, Univers, Frutiger and Avenir, are landmark sans-serif families spanning the three main genres of sans-serif typefaces: neogrotesque, humanist and geometric. Univers was notable for being one of the first sans-serif faces to form a consistent but wide-ranging family, across a range of widths and weights. Frutiger described creating sans-serif types as his &quot;main life&#x27;s work&quot;, partially due to the difficulty in designing them compared to serif fonts.

==Early life==
Adrian Frutiger was born in Unterseen, Canton of Bern, the son of a weaver. As a boy, he experimented with invented scripts and stylized handwriting in a negative reaction to the formal, cursive penmanship then required by Swiss schools. His father and his secondary school teachers encouraged him to pursue an apprenticeship rather than pure art. After initially planning to train as a pastry chef, Frutiger secured an apprenticeship at the Otto Schlaefli printing house in Interlaken.

==Formative years and personal life==
At the age of sixteen, he was apprenticed for four years, as a compositor, to the printer Otto Schlaeffli in Interlaken, also taking classes in woodcuts and drawing at the Gewerbeschule in Bern under Walter Zerbe, followed by employment as a compositor at Gebr. Fretz in Zürich, Switzerland. In 1949 he transferred to the Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich, where he studied under Walter Käch, Karl Schmid, and Alfred Willimann until 1951. Students there studied monumental inscriptions from Roman forum rubbings. At the Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich, Frutiger concentrated on calligraphy — a craft favouring the nib and the brush, instead of drafting tools, but also began sketches for what would become Univers, influenced by the sans-serif types popular in contemporary graphic design.

Frutiger married Paulette Flückiger in 1952, who died in 1954 after the birth of their son Stéphane. He married the theologian Simone Bickel in 1955. They had two daughters, who both experienced mental health problems and committed suicide as adolescents. Disappointed by the standard of mental health care at the time, Frutiger and his wife founded the Adrian and Simone Frutiger Foundation () to fund psychology and neuroscience research and developments in mental health support.

In an interview, Frutiger described himself as a Calvinist.

Frutiger spent most of his professional career working in Paris and living in France, returning to Switzerland later in life.

==Career==

, of the Paris foundry Deberny &amp; Peignot, recruited Frutiger based upon the quality of the illustrated essay &quot;Schrift / Écriture / Lettering: the development of European letter types carved in wood&quot;, Frutiger&#x27;s final project at the Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich. Frutiger&#x27;s wood-engraved illustrations of the essay demonstrated his skill, meticulousness, and knowledge of letter forms. At Deberny &amp; Peignot foundry, Frutiger designed the typefaces Président, Méridien, and Ondine. In addition, Charles Peignot set Frutiger to work upon converting extant typefaces for the new phototypesetting Linotype equipment.

Adrian Frutiger&#x27;s first commercial typeface was Président — a set of titling capital letters with small, bracketed serifs, released in 1954. A calligraphic, informal, script face, Ondine ( in French), also was released in 1954. In 1955, Méridien, a glyphic, old-style, serif text face was released. The typeface shows inspiration by Nicolas Jenson, and, in the Méridien type, Frutiger&#x27;s ideas of letter construction, unity, and organic form, are first expressed together. Raph Levien described as a &quot;Frutiger trademark&quot; his common use of an &quot;a&quot; where the loop makes a horizontal line at the top on meeting the vertical. It makes use of narrow wedge serifs, a style sometimes known as Latin which Frutiger would often use in his future serif designs. In 1956, he designed his first-of-three, slab-serif typefaces — Egyptienne, on the Clarendon model; after Univers, it was the second, new text face to be commissioned for photo-composition.

===Univers===
Charles Peignot envisioned a large, unified font family, that might be set in both the metal and the photo-composition systems. Impressed by the success of the Bauer foundry&#x27;s Futura typeface, Peignot encouraged a new, geometric sans-serif type in competition. Frutiger disliked the regimentation of Futura, and persuaded Peignot that the new sans-serif should be based on the realist (neo-grotesque) model. The 1898 face, Akzidenz-Grotesk, is cited as the primary model. To maintain unity across the 21 variants, each weight and width, in roman (upright) and oblique (slanted), was drawn and approved before any matrices were cut. In the Univers font, Frutiger introduced his two-digit numeration; the first digit (3 though 8) indicates the weight, &quot;3&quot; the lightest, &quot;8&quot; the heaviest. The second digit indicates the face-width and either roman or oblique. It was marketed with a design inspired by the periodic table. The response to Univers was immediate and positive; he claimed it became the model for his future typefaces. His slab serif designs Serifa (1967) and Glypha (1977) are directly based upon it.

Univers attracted attention to Frutiger&#x27;s work outside continental Europe, and he was commissioned by Monotype to create Apollo, their first typeface specifically created for phototypesetting, which was released in 1964.

===Frutiger===

In 1961–64, Frutiger created with André Gürtler a sans-serif font named Concorde for news use in regular and bold styles for Parisian printing company Sofratype. Required to create a design clearly different from Univers, the design based on classical capitals with a greater classical influence than Univers, partially influenced by a serif design Opéra he had worked on in the interim. The design failed to attract attention and was withdrawn from sale after a few years.

In 1970, Frutiger was asked to design signage at the new Charles de Gaulle Airport in the Roissy suburb of Paris. The &quot;way-finding-signage&quot; commission brief required a typeface both legible from afar and from an angle. Frutiger decided to adapt Concorde using legibility research as a guide, and titled the new design Roissy.

In 1974, the Mergenthaler Linotype Company commissioned Frutiger to develop a print version of Roissy with improvements such as better spacing, which was released for public use under the name of Frutiger in 1976. Extremely legible at a distance or at small size, Frutiger became hugely influential on the development of future humanist sans-serif typefaces; font designer Erik Spiekermann described it as &quot;the best general typeface ever&quot; while Steve Matteson described it as &quot;the best choice for legibility in pretty much any situation&quot; at small text sizes.

Frutiger is an amalgamation of Univers tempered with organic influences of the Gill Sans, a humanist sans-serif typeface by Eric Gill, Edward Johnston&#x27;s type for the London Transport, and Roger Excoffon&#x27;s Antique Olive: like Univers it uses a single-story &#x27;g&#x27;, unlike the double of Gill Sans, and has square dots on the letters, but has a generally humanist design with wide apertures to increase legibility, decided on after legibility research.

In the 1970s, Frutiger designed Icone, a wedge-serif design with mild stroke modulation, which has many similarities in basic letter structure to Frutiger, and in overall effect to Albertus. Frutiger&#x27;s intention was more unusual: to create a design that could be modified by computer, through extreme slanting, morphing or changing stroke width, without seeming as if it had been distorted.

Frutiger designed a number of other signage projects in the 1970s. These included an adaptation of Univers for the Paris Métro, after the RATP, the public transport authority of Paris, asked Frutiger to examine the Paris Métro signage. He created a Univers font variation — a set of capitals and numbers specifically for white-on-dark-blue backgrounds in poor light. He also designed a slab serif font for the Centre Pompidou.

Frutiger&#x27;s 1984 typeface Versailles is an old-style serif text with capitals like those in the earlier Président. Versailles is a Latin design with sharp wedge serifs, based on a popular genre in 19th-century printing.

===Avenir===
In 1988, Frutiger completed the family Avenir. Frutiger intended the design to be a more human version of geometric sans-serif types popular in the 1930s such as Erbar and Futura, and it is named Avenir ( in French) as a reference to the latter.

In a complete reverse, his next design Westside was a wild-west themed slab serif, inspired by reverse-contrast French Clarendons of the late 19th century.

===Late designs===
In 1991, Frutiger finished Vectora, a design influenced by Morris Fuller Benton&#x27;s type faces Franklin Gothic and News Gothic. The resultant face has a tall x-height and is legible in small-point sizes. Frutiger&#x27;s 1991 release Linotype Didot was an elegant revival of the Didot typeface adapted to display use, which remains popular; it is the version of Didot bundled with OS X, for example. While Frutiger continued to be involved in adaptations and expansions of pre-existing families and smaller projects, he described in 1998 as his &quot;last typeface design&quot;.

===The roots of letters===

Linotype launched a font series named &quot;Type before Gutenberg&quot; in 1989 and in the 1990s, Frutiger released as part of it a series of designs inspired by pre-printing alphabets, such as Herculanum and Pompeijana, inspired by Roman brush lettering, Rusticana, inspired by &quot;&quot; Roman carving. He later also created Frutiger Stones (no connection to Frutiger), a playful design inspired by the shapes of pebbles. Parts of this design were finalised by Linotype&#x27;s team; it was based on an alphabet drawn by Frutiger on a 1992 Christmas card. He also created Capitalis, inspired by brush lettering but without a specific historical source. Nami, an uncial design Frutiger had been considering since 1992, followed in 2007.

===Remastered releases===

In the late 1990s, Frutiger began collaborating on refining and expanding his most famous Univers, Frutiger, and Avenir families. The new projects took advantage of improved digital production methods to create a wider range of styles and improved hinting for onscreen display. Univers was reissued as Linotype Univers with sixty-three variants; Frutiger was reissued as Frutiger Next with additional weights. Collaborating with Linotype designer Akira Kobayashi, Frutiger expanded the Avenir font family with light weights, heavy weights, and a condensed version that were released as the Avenir Next font. Frutiger described the process of restoring Univers as a &quot;personal gift.&quot;

These modifications were not universally considered improvements: Frutiger regretted allowing Linotype to substitute a modish 1990s true italic (not drawn by Frutiger) onto Frutiger Next instead of the sharper oblique Frutiger preferred throughout his career. In his autobiography, Frutiger commented that in resigning himself to it &quot;Maybe I was too soft to say what I really felt... I didn&#x27;t have the strength and patience anymore.&quot; From a different perspective, type designer Martin Majoor commented that he preferred the italic but described Linotype Univers as &quot;staggering&quot; and &quot;not an improvement&quot; for its return to the very aggressively slanted italic of Frutiger&#x27;s original drawings: &quot;Redesigning an old successful typeface is something a type designer should maybe never consider.&quot; Frutiger commented on the italic that he felt Univers needed to be &quot;snappy&quot; and that it added character.

In 2009, Frutiger collaborated with Akira Kobayashi on a second re-release of Frutiger, Frutiger Neue, which moved back towards the original 1970s release.

Through his later years, Frutiger collaborated with co-authors Heidrun Osterer and Philipp Stamm on an extensive autobiography, &quot;Typefaces: the Complete Works&quot; (2008). In this book, Frutiger discussed his entire career and his completed and abandoned projects.

==Death==
Frutiger died on 10 September 2015, in Bremgarten bei Bern at the age of 87.

==Typefaces==
Frutiger&#x27;s typefaces include:
* Ondine (1954): a display design inspired by Arabic calligraphy.
* Président (1954): a wedge-serif titling face in capitals and small capitals; somewhat similar to Copperplate Gothic.
* Méridien (1955): a text face, again with a crisp wedge-serif design and a gradual flare on ascenders. Frutiger Serif (below) is an update and expansion.
* Egyptienne (1956): a humanist slab-serif design.

==Other work==
In 2003, the Swiss watchmaker Ventura commissioned him to design a new watch face for a limited-edition line of wristwatches.

To celebrate Swiss graphic design he designed three stamps for the Swiss post office.

He also designed a word mark for the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, India. Originally, the institute was named National Design Institute, however, the institute renamed itself to match Adrian Frutiger&#x27;s stylized NID logotype alongside the name &quot;National Institute of Design.&quot;

For the Fondation Frutiger he created a set of symbols as an abstract presentation of the Foundation&#x27;s work.

Adrian Frutiger also designed small vignettes for the book of prayers of the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland, performing the work pro bono.

<doc id="334100" wikidata="Q135891" url="?curid=334100" title="ZAKA">
<text>ZAKA (, abbreviation for &quot;Zihuy Korbanot Ason&quot;, , ) is a series of voluntary post-disaster response teams in Israel, each operating in a police district (two in the Central District due to geographic considerations). They are recognized by the Israeli government. The full name is &quot;ZAKA – Identification, Extraction and Rescue – True Kindness&quot; (). The two largest ZAKA factions are Zaka Tel Aviv and ZAKA Search and Rescue.

ZAKA faced insolvency before 7 October 2023. Given the job of retrieving the dead bodies after the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, they started fund-raising on 8 October 2023. By 31 January 2024, they had raised over 50 million shekels ($13.7 million). According to &quot;Haaretz,&quot; ZAKA&#x27;s conduct in the aftermath of the attacks was unprofessional, including mixing up remains and spreading misinformation about atrocities that never happened in order to raise money. 

==Background==
ZAKA volunteers respond to the scenes of violent attacks and homicides throughout Israel. The volunteers are trained paramedics and are on call 24/7. ZAKA collects the remains of the dead, including their blood, so that they may be buried in accordance with Jewish religious law. Volunteers are allowed to work on Shabbat, because the sabbath can be broken in matters of life and death.

Members of ZAKA, most of whom are Orthodox Jews, assist ambulance crews, aid in the identification of the victims of violence, road accidents and other disasters, and where necessary gather body parts and spilled blood for proper Jewish burial. They also provide first aid and rescue services, and help with the search for missing persons and participate in international rescue and recovery operations.

After acts of violence, ZAKA volunteers also collect the bodies and body parts of non-Jews, including suicide bombers, for return to their families. The phrase &quot;Chesed shel Emet&quot; refers to doing &quot;kindness&quot; for the benefit of the deceased, which is considered to be &quot;true kindness&quot;, because the (deceased) beneficiaries of the kindness cannot return the kindness.

==History==

The organization traces its roots to a group of religious volunteers who assisted in the recovery of human remains after the Tel Aviv Jerusalem bus 405 attack in Israel in 1989, during the First Intifada. ZAKA was formally established in 1995.

During the attack on bus line 405 in 1990, Yehuda Meshi Zahav arrived with other yeshiva boys to provide first aid to the victims. On his way home, he concluded that if in the enemy&#x27;s view everyone is equal, so too for him. In the 1990s, he arrived at the scenes of suicide bombing attacks in Israel, among other things, and treated the bodies of those killed. As a result, ZAKA (Disaster Victim Identification) was founded. In his capacity as Chairman of ZAKA, he worked for inter-religious and secular reconciliation.

In 2005, ZAKA established a minorities unit with Bedouin, Muslim, and Druze volunteers to serve Israel&#x27;s non-Jewish communities, primarily Bedouin in the Negev and Druze in the Galilee. These units also function when religious Jews cannot, on the Jewish Sabbath and holidays. According to Jewish law, Jews may violate the Sabbath to save a life, but not to deal with the dead. In 2010, ZAKA said it planned to increase its minorities units to 125 volunteers.

In 2004, a group of ZAKA volunteers flew to The Hague, with the wreckage of the bus destroyed in the Jerusalem bus 19 suicide bombing on 29 January 2004. The wreckage, along with pictures of victims, was taken to Washington, D.C. to urge the United States Government to act against the Palestinian resistance movement. The bus was later displayed at various US universities.

In August 2007, ZAKA members were accused of burning down a secret crematorium in Israel. Most Jews believe Jews should be buried according to religious tradition, not cremated. ZAKA&#x27;s founder Yehuda Meshi Zahav denied any involvement of ZAKA in the arson but called the existence of the crematorium a &quot;desecration of the dead&quot; and said that the crematorium was &quot;destined to disappear in flames.&quot;

In January 2016, after two failed attempts, the United Nations granted ZAKA the status of a &#x27;consultant NGO&#x27;.

ZAKA faced insolvency before 7 October 2023. Given the job of retrieving the dead bodies after the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, they started fund-raising on 8 October 2023. By 31 January 2024, they had raised over 50 million shekels ($13.7 million). A &quot;Haaretz&quot; investigation accused them of &quot;negligence, misinformation and a fundraising campaign that used the dead as props&quot;.

==Organization==
Its volunteers are almost all ultra-Orthodox Jews. However as of 2010, more than 125 Muslim, Druze, and Bedouin volunteers provided services to non-Jewish victims.

In 2010, ZAKA volunteers numbered 1,500.

The organization says it employs around 4,000 volunteers, though a 2022 investigation by &quot;Haaretz&quot;, based on &quot;documents and testimonies by senior figures in the organization&quot;, said there were fewer than 1,000 volunteers, alleged that the numbers were inflated to increase funding, and found volunteers who said they had not received the biannual training mandated by the Interior Ministry. ZAKA denied the report. In 2017, its annual operating budget was about one million shekels. The New York Times reported a membership of &quot;more than 3,000 volunteers, most of them ultra-Orthodox Jewish men&quot; in 2024.

==International rescue &amp; recovery operations==

* In late 2004 and early 2005, members of ZAKA provided assistance in Thailand, Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Forensic teams reportedly dubbed the group &quot;the team that sleeps with the dead&quot; because they toiled nearly 24 hours a day at Buddhist pagodas in Thailand that had been transformed into morgues to identify those who died in the tsunami. The experience of ZAKA members, who reportedly see 38 bodies a week on average in Israel, helped the Israeli forensic team to identify corpses faster than many of the other forensic teams that operated in Thailand in the aftermath of the disaster, which placed them in high demand with grieving families.
* In February 2007, ZAKA sent a 10-person search and rescue team, consisting primarily of rescue divers, to Paris to search for a missing Israeli defense official. The mission was funded by the Defense Ministry at an expected cost of $80,000.
* In November 2008, ZAKA volunteers went to Mumbai, India following terrorist attacks that included a Jewish center among its targets.
* Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, a six-man ZAKA International Search and Rescue Unit delegation arrived in Haiti to assist with search and recovery efforts. Working with the Mexican military delegation and Jewish volunteers from Mexico, eight students trapped under the rubble of the collapsed eight-storey Port-au-Prince University building were rescued on the first day after their arrival.
* Teams of ZAKA volunteers were sent to Japan in March 2011 to assist in search-and-rescue after the devastating earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
* A ZAKA team was part of an Israeli mission to Nepal in late April 2015 to help search for casualties in the aftermath of the earthquake and subsequent avalanches.
* In January 2019, a ZAKA team deployed in Brazil to conduct search and rescue operations following a dam collapse in Brumadinho.

== Casualties and injuries ==
Several ZAKA volunteers died as a result of the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack. Danny Vovk, a driver, was killed during the Netiv HaAsara massacre.

Widespread psychological trauma was reported among ZAKA volunteers as a result of the scenes that they worked to clean.

== Controversies ==

=== Yehuda Meshi-Zahav ===
After Yehuda Meshi-Zahav, ZAKA&#x27;s co-founder and main figurehead for more than 30 years, was awarded the Israel Prize in March 2021, multiple accusations surfaced of his having committed sexual assaults against women, girls and boys over several decades, with the knowledge of others in the community. Channel 13 reported that ZAKA officials had known about the abuse allegations and worked to silence the claims. Meshi-Zahav subsequently resigned ZAKA leadership and relinquished the Israel Prize. 

In response to the accusations, a senior ZAKA official said the organization had now &quot;washed its hands&quot; of Meshi-Zahav and that &quot;given the accusations against him, it&#x27;s very hard to remember the good that he&#x27;s done. We always saw him with women and suspected that he was a deviant, but we never suspected he was a pedophile or a rapist. In retrospect, this [the allegations] explains a lot of things we saw over the years. Following a suicide attempt in April 2021, Meshi-Zahav entered a coma and died in June 2022. 

Gideon Aran, a Professor of Sociology and Anthropology at Hebrew University, said in his book about ZAKA that most ZAKA volunteers, while familiar with Meshi-Zahav and the colorful image of himself that he had cultivated, probably had no inkling of his misconduct; only a very few senior members were partially aware of his inclinations, without suspecting there was criminal and pathological behavior involved. Following the scandal, Aran found that aside from a few changes in personnel, the organization&#x27;s principles, sentiments and activities remained the same, and the damage to its public reputation was minimal.

=== 2023 Hamas attack on Israel ===
In the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, ZAKA volunteers gave several incorrect reports of atrocities allegedly committed by Hamas, including the binding and burning of babies, that were widely circulated in the media. Some of ZAKA&#x27;s accounts of Sexual and gender-based violence in the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel have also been debunked. For example, one volunteer discovered a girl&#x27;s body with her pants pulled down and concluded that she had been sexually assaulted. Later, it was discovered that Israeli soldiers had in fact dragged the body across the floor, causing the pants to fall. 

A ZAKA leader acknowledged mistakes were made: &quot;When we find bodies that are burned or in a state of decomposition, we can easily be mistaken and think the body is a child&#x27;s ... Our volunteers were confronted with traumatic scenes and sometimes misinterpreted what they saw.&quot; ZAKA also stated that they are not forensics specialists. However, the debunked accounts have fed skepticism about Israel&#x27;s description of the events of the Hamas attacks.

A subsequent &quot;Haaretz&quot; report stated that in order to get media exposure, ZAKA spread accounts of atrocities that never happened and released sensitive and graphic photos in an effort to shock people into donating. The &quot;Haaretz&quot; investigation accused ZAKA of &quot;negligence, misinformation and a fundraising campaign that used the dead as props&quot;. &quot;Haaretz&quot; also said that while hundreds of ZAKA volunteers did important work under challenging conditions, the organization acted unprofessionally on the ground, often mixing up the remains of multiple victims in the same bag and creating little or no documentation.

<text>Cultural tourism is a type of tourism in which the visitor&#x27;s essential motivation is to learn, discover, experience and consume the cultural attractions and products offered by a tourist destination. These attractions and products relate to the intellectual, spiritual, and emotional features of a society that encompasses arts and architecture, historical and cultural heritage, culinary heritage, literature, music, creative industries as well as the living cultures with their lifestyles, value systems, beliefs and traditions.

==Overview==
Cultural tourism experiences include, but are not limited to, architectural and archaeological treasures, culinary activities, festivals or events, historic or heritage, sites, monuments and landmarks, museums and exhibitions, national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, and religious venues. It includes tourism in urban areas, particularly historic or large cities and their cultural facilities such as theatres, as well as tourism in remote, indigenous regions. In the twenty-first-century United States, national parks and a limited number of Native American councils continue to promote &quot;tribal tourism.&quot; The U.S. National Park Service has publicly endorsed this strain of cultural tourism, despite lingering concerns over exploitation and the potential hazards of ecotourism in Native America.

Proponents of cultural tourism say that it gives the local population the opportunity to benefit financially from their cultural heritage and thus to appreciate and preserve it, while giving visitors the opportunity to broaden their personal horizons. Cultural tourism also has negative sides. There may be negative effects on local residents, such as making the local economy unstable, increasing the cost of living for local residents, increasing pollution, or creating environmental problems. Also, the local population is at risk of coming into contact with new ways of life that can disrupt their social fabric.

This form of tourism is becoming generally more popular throughout the world, and a recent OECD report has highlighted the role that cultural tourism can play in regional development in different world regions. Cultural tourism has recently shifted towards meeting the growing desire for cultural &quot;experiences&quot; in particular.

Sectors of cultural tourism can be distinguished both by the destination (urban cultural tourism, rural cultural tourism, etc.) as well as the theme of the trip (heritage tourism, popular culture tourism, etc.). The main subcategories are discussed in more detail below.

== Subcategories of Cultural Tourism ==

=== Heritage tourism ===
* Archaeological sites
* Monuments
* Architecture
* Museums
* Religious sites  

Heritage tourism involves traveling to a site of cultural significance to engage with the heritage of the region and local population. In recent years, more attention has been put on the inclusion and thoughtful representation of the history of marginalized groups for the tourist audience, marked by UNESCO&#x27;s updates to their World Heritage List, which is a comprehensive list of significant heritage sites. 

=== Arts tourism ===
* Theater
* Concerts and music venues
* Galleries
* Festivals, carnivals and events
* Literary sites

Arts tourism involves traveling to the location of an art exhibit, which includes live-performances, museums, and libraries. Arts tourism is a relatively less common form of cultural tourism, due both the historical exclusivity of the arts scene, and the option for artists to go on tour, eliminating the need for tourism. Even so, in recent years, the arts community has put increased emphasis on prioritizing the accessibility of local art and exhibits. 

=== Creative tourism ===
* Photography
* Painting
* Pottery
* Culinary arts
* Language learning
* Performing arts (e.g. music, dancing, singing)

Creative Tourism involves active participation from tourists in cultural experiences specific to each holiday destination. This form of tourism is more recently theorized and defined by Greg Richards and Crispin Raymond in 2000. They defined creative tourism as: &quot;Tourism which offers visitors the opportunity to develop their creative potential through active participation in courses and learning experiences, which are characteristic of the holiday destination where they are taken.&quot; (Richards &amp; Crispin, 2000). In line with Richards and Crispin&#x27;s conceptualization, Matteucci and Smith (2024) have defined creative tourism as &quot;a subset of cultural tourism, whereby tourists interact with inspirational locals and engage with place-specific endogenous resources for self-fulfilment purposes&quot; (p. 1). 

This type of tourism is opposed to mass tourism and allows the destinations to diversify and offer innovative activities different from other destinations.

Similarly, UNESCO launched in 2004 a program entitled &quot;Creative Cities Network&quot;. This network aims to highlight cities around the world that are putting creativity at the heart of their sustainable urban development plan. Creative cities are organized into seven categories representing seven different creative fields: crafts and folk arts, digital arts, film, design, gastronomy, literature, and music. As of January 2020, the network has 246 members across all categories. In order to promote the development of this new type of tourism, a non-profit organization was created in Barcelona in 2010: Creative Tourism Network. Its missions involve, among others: the promotion of creative tourism, the creation of a network of &quot;Creativefriendly&quot; cities but also awards celebration, The Creative Tourism Awards.&quot;

=== Urban cultural tourism ===
* Historic cities
* Regenerated industrial cities
* Waterfront development
* Arts and heritage attractions
* Shopping
* Nightlife

Urban cultural tourism involves traveling to urban sites of cultural significance, which often offer a range of both historical and recreational attractions. Certain major urban cities with cultural offerings are listed in UNESCO&#x27;s world heritage site and have been lauded for their promotion of cross-cultural exchange. Other urban cultural tourist sites are post-industrial cities, who offer tourists a slice of their history alongside modern recreation, such as shopping and nightlife. 

=== Rural cultural tourism ===
* Village, farm or agro-tourism
* Eco-museums
* National parks
* Wine trails

Rural cultural tourism involves traveling to rural sites of cultural significance. Similarly to urban cultural tourist sites, many rural sites are cities whose main industries have declined, that supplement their economies by offering various attractions, such as wine-tasting. Other rural cultural sites have great historical significance, such as national parks. 

=== Indigenous cultural tourism ===
* Hilltribe, desert or mountain trekking
* Visits to cultural centers
* Arts and crafts (by local artists)
* Cultural performances
* Festivals

Indigenous cultural tourism is defined as &quot;any service or product that is a) owned and operated at least in part by an Indigenous group and b) results from a means of exchange with outside guests.&quot; Most indigenous community have faced historic marginalization, which has led many proponents of cultural tourism to emphasize the need for sensitivity around these cultural events, as well as the importance of the indigenous population&#x27;s control over how their culture is represented. Experts recognize that &quot;the capitalization of Native identity has been a feature of Native and European interaction since the early colonial period.&quot; However, although this legacy is perhaps echoed by modern day indigenous tourism, involvement in the tourism industry allows indigenous populations &quot;[to take] part in the global economy on their own terms.&quot;

=== Popular cultural tourism ===
* Theme parks and themed attractions
* Shopping malls
* Pop concerts
* Sporting events
* Media and film sets
* Industrial heritage sites
* Fashion and design museums

Popular cultural tourism involves any kind of tourist attractions that are modern and mainstream, such as amusement parks or sporting events. Popular cultural tourism has only recently been included under the umbrella of cultural tourism, as recreational activities have gained increasing recognition for their cultural significance.

== Environmental impacts of cultural tourism ==

=== Negative ===

Increased tourist traffic often leads to greater rates of litter and pollution in a given community. This runs a risk for important cultural landscapes to be exposed to significant damage from human-caused wear and tear--&quot;Tourists are in a peculiar position, because they do not live with the consequences of the pollution they help create or the shortages they help cause.&quot; In many ancient European cities, such as Rome, Paris, and Florence, the buildup of air pollutants generated by car exhaust and gas-powered motors has caused the white stone to be covered in pollutants and turned to a gray or black color. These toxic exhausts can also accelerate the corrosion of culturally important stone monuments, statues and heritage buildings.

Changing environmental conditions can have large impacts on human environments and heritage sites, as well. Cultural landscapes can be lost to rising waters and increasingly severe storms. This deterioration, and in the worst case, destruction, can be a major issue in coastal communities and low-lying islands. Floods and rising water levels can also be a direct threat to archaeological sites, historic buildings that hold cultural values, and heritage gardens.

=== Positive ===
Tourism can bring communities economic growth from both job creation and tax revenue from ticket sales to festivals, museums, ancient ruins, religious sites and historic hotels. This increase in economic growth is welcomed by heads of conservation sites, as it often a major source of revenue for important cultural sites where government assistance is lacking. &quot;Tourism can act as an impetus for creating public awareness of the need to preserve the built environment. The establishment of national parks, national monuments and other protected areas is often justified by the existence of tourism&quot; 

Cultural tourism stimulates economic growth, preserves heritage, and fosters cross-cultural understanding. It promotes sustainable development and community revitalization, contributing to both local economies and global cultural enrichment through the preservation and celebration of diverse traditions.

===Demographics===

== History ==
The area of Izumo was part of the ancient Izumo Province and has been inhabited since prehistoric times. In 2009, a team of archaeologists announced that they likely discovered—at the Sunabara Site in Taki-chō, Izumo—the oldest stone tools ever found in Japan. The find totaled about 20 tools dating back an estimated 120,000 years: about 80,000 years earlier than previous estimates of when the first humans arrived in the Japanese archipelago. Later, this date was revised to 70,000 years before present upon the discovery of a layer of volcanic ash also dated 70,000 years before present. A powerful ancient kingdom developed in the fertile Izumo Plain from the Yayoi period, as evidenced by the area&#x27;s rich mythology, ruins, large amount of excavated items, and a wide variety of ancient tombs. The Izumo area is also rich in Kofun period burial mounds. The Imaichi Dainenji Kofun is believed to have been constructed in the 6th century with highly sophisticated construction methods for the time and with an overall length of 100 meters is the largest in the Izumo region

During the Sengoku period, Izumo was the stronghold of the Amago clan, until their defeat by the Mōri clan. Under the Edo Period Tokugawa shogunate, the area came largely under the control of Matsue Domain. Following the Meiji restoration, the town of Imaichi was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Imaichi merged with eight surrounding villages to form the town of Izumo on February 11, 1941. Izumo was raised to city status less than 9 months later, on November 3, 1941.

On March 22, 2005, Izumo absorbed the city of Hirata, and the towns of Koryō, Sada, Taisha and Taki (all from Hikawa District) to create the new and expanded city of Izumo.

On October 1, 2011, the town of Hikawa (also from Hikawa District) was also merged into the new Izumo. Hikawa District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

==Government==
Izumo has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 30 members. Izumo contributes nine members to the Shimane Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Shimane 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The main industries in are agriculture and commercial fishing. Izumo is also a major tourist destination within the San&#x27;in region.

==Education==
Izumo has 36 public elementary school and 14 public junior high schools operated by the city government, and six public high schools operated by the Shimane Prefectural Board of Education.

<doc id="334112" wikidata="Q582846" url="?curid=334112" title="Izumo Province">
<text>was an old province of Japan which today consists of the eastern part of Shimane Prefecture. It was sometimes called . The province is in the Chūgoku region.

== History ==
During the early Kofun period (3rd century) this region was independent and constructed rectangular tumuli. But in the fourth century this region saw the construction of rectangular and key shaped tumuli.

During the 6th or 7th century it was absorbed due to the expansion of the state of Yamato, within which it assumed the role of a sacerdotal domain.

Today, the Izumo Shrine constitutes (as does the Grand Shrine of Ise) one of the most important sacred places of Shinto: it is dedicated to &quot;kami&quot;, especially to Ōkuninushi (&quot;Ō-kuni-nushi-no-mikoto&quot;), mythical progeny of Susanoo and all the clans of Izumo. The mythological mother of Japan, the goddess Izanami, is said to be buried on Mt. Hiba, at the border of the old provinces of Izumo and Hōki, near modern-day Yasugi of Shimane Prefecture.

By the Sengoku period, Izumo had lost much of its importance. It was dominated before the Battle of Sekigahara by the Mōri clan, and after Sekigahara, it was an independent fief with a castle town at modern Matsue.

In Japanese mythology, the entrance to Yomi (Hell, land of the dead) was located within the province, and was sealed by the god Izanagi by placing a large boulder over the entrance.

<text>Carol Ryrie Brink (December 28, 1895 – August 15, 1981) was an American writer of over thirty juvenile and adult books. Her novel &quot;Caddie Woodlawn&quot; won the 1936 Newbery Medal and a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958.

== Lifetime ==
Caroline Sybil Ryrie born in Moscow, Idaho, the only child of Alexander and Henrietta (Watkins) Ryrie. Her father, an immigrant from Scotland, was the city&#x27;s mayor (1895–97) and her mother was the daughter of prominent physician Dr. William W. Watkins, the first president of the state&#x27;s medical association and a member of the board of regents of the new University of Idaho. After Alex Ryrie died in 1900, Henrietta remarried, but after her father was murdered in 1901, her second marriage (to Elisha Nathaniel Brown) failed and she committed suicide in 1904 at age twenty-nine. Carol was then raised in Moscow by her widowed maternal grandmother, Caroline Woodhouse Watkins, the model for Caddie Woodlawn. Her grandmother&#x27;s life and storytelling abilities inspired Carol&#x27;s writing from an early age.

Brink started writing for her school newspapers and continued that in college; she graduated from the Portland Academy in Oregon and attended the University of Idaho in Moscow for three years (1914–17). She wrote for &quot;The Argonaut&quot; student newspaper and &quot;Gem of the Mountains&quot; yearbook and was a member of Gamma Phi Beta sorority. She transferred to the University of California in Berkeley for her senior year in 1917 and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1918, then on June 12 married Raymond W. Brink, a young mathematics professor she had met in Moscow nine years earlier. He had joined the faculty at the University of Minnesota a year prior and the couple made their home in St. Paul for 42 years. The Brinks raised a son (David) and a daughter (Nora), spent summers in the Wisconsin backwoods, and traveled for several years in Scotland and France.

Brink’s first novel, &quot;Anything Can Happen on the River&quot;, was published in 1934. Brink wrote fiction throughout her life, and added poetry and painting to her later accomplishments. After 55 years of marriage, her husband died in 1973, and she died eight years later of heart failure at age 85 in La Jolla, California. In her family, the name Caroline or Carol has been given as either a first or middle name to the oldest female child without interruption for at least seven generations, continuing to the present day.

===Hometown honors===
Brink was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Idaho in 1965. At the university is Brink Hall, a faculty office building which includes the English department. A classic ivy-covered brick structure, built in the 1930s to appear much older, it was originally the Willis Sweet dormitory and later the Faculty Office Complex East. Named for her shortly after her death, its companion west building was named for Archie Phinney. Across town in east Moscow is &quot;Carol Ryrie Brink Nature Park,&quot; a stream restoration area alongside Paradise Creek on land owned by the school district. Dedicated during the centennial celebration of Brink&#x27;s birth in 1995, its west entrance is at Mountain View Road and 7th Street. At the city&#x27;s north end, the children&#x27;s section at the refurbished Carnegie building of the Moscow Public Library contains the &quot;Carol Ryrie Brink Reading Room.&quot; Opened in 1906, Brink had frequented that library as a youth.

<text>Reason is a digital audio workstation and audio plug-in developed by the Swedish company Reason Studios (formerly known as Propellerhead Software) for macOS and Windows. The first version was released in 2000.

== Background ==
Propellerhead Software was founded in 1994 by Ernst Nathorst-Böös, Pelle Jubel and Marcus Zetterquist and launched with ReCycle. They became popular in 1996 after releasing the ReBirth RB-338, described by MusicRadar in February 2011 as &quot;one of the most important virtual instruments in the history of electronic music&quot;. By the late 1990s, advancements in technology meant that it became feasible for home users to build their own virtual studios from software, and so in 1999, Propellerhead ended development on ReBirth to work on Reason.

==Release history==
Reason was first released in November 2000. MusicRadar described it in 2011 as &quot;broadly similar to the likes of Logic and Cubase, but&quot; with its &quot;user interface mimick[ing] a rack full of equipment, allowing instruments, effects and mixers to be linked together in order to create a complete production setup&quot;. Subsequent versions came out in September 2002, 2005, September 2007, August 2010, September 2011, April 2013, September 2014, June 2016, October 2017, September 2019, September 2021, and June 2024. Early versions of the program lacked the ability to record audio, and in September 2009, Propellerhead released Record to work alongside Reason; Record was later merged into Reason 6. The success of the program prompted Propellerhead to rebrand itself as Reason Studios in August 2019.

Reviewing Reason 12, MusicRadar questioned how useful Reason 11 users would find it, but noted that it looked &quot;the best it has in years&quot;, while Musictech.com described it as a &quot;brilliant buy&quot; for producers looking for a new digital audio workstation. Pcmag.com noted that &quot;existing fans [...] should take a close look&quot;, though criticised its user interface, saying that it had &quot;aged considerably&quot; compared to its competition.

<text>Reason is an American libertarian monthly magazine published by the Reason Foundation, with the tagline &quot;Free Minds and Free Markets&quot;. The magazine aims to produce independent journalism that is &quot;outside of the left/right echo chamber.&quot; As of 2016, the magazine had a circulation of around 50,000 and received about 2.5 million monthly unique website visitors.

== History ==
&quot;Reason&quot; was founded in 1968 by Lanny Friedlander (1947–2011), a student at Boston University, as a more-or-less monthly mimeographed publication. In 1970, it was purchased by Robert W. Poole Jr., Manuel S. Klausner, and Tibor R. Machan, who set it on a more regular publishing schedule. During the 1970s and 1980s, the magazine&#x27;s contributors included Milton Friedman, Murray Rothbard, Thomas Szasz, and Thomas Sowell. In 1978, Poole, Klausner, and Machan created the associated Reason Foundation, in order to expand the magazine&#x27;s ideas into policy research. Marty Zupan joined &quot;Reason&quot; in 1975, and served through the 1980s as managing editor and editor-in-chief, leaving in 1989.

Virginia Postrel was editor-in-chief of the magazine from July 1989 to January 2000. She founded the magazine&#x27;s website in 1995. Nick Gillespie became editor-in-chief in 2000.

In June 2004, subscribers to &quot;Reason&quot; magazine received a personalized issue that had their name, and a satellite photo of their home or workplace on the cover. The concept was to demonstrate the power of public databases, as well as the customized printing capabilities of Xeikon&#x27;s printer, according to then editor-in-chief Nick Gillespie. The move was seen by David Carr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;the ultimate in customized publishing&quot; as well as &quot;a remarkable demonstration of the growing number of ways databases can be harnessed.&quot;

In 2008, Matt Welch became magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief, with Gillespie becoming editor-in-chief of reason.tv. In 2011, Gillespie and Welch published the book &quot;The Declaration of Independents: How Libertarian Politics Can Fix What&#x27;s Wrong with America&quot;, which they co-wrote.
Katherine Mangu-Ward became the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief in June 2016, with Welch moving to an editor-at-large position. Nick Gillespie is the other editor-at-large of &quot;Reason&quot;.

==Hit &amp; Run==
Hit &amp; Run was &quot;Reason&quot;″s group blog. It was maintained and written by the staff of the magazine. It was started in 2002 and discontinued on April 14, 2019, with reason.com&#x27;s site redesign. Then-editor Gillespie and then-Web editor Tim Cavanaugh, both veterans of Suck.com, modeled the blog in some ways after that website: they brought along several other Suck.com writers to contribute, fostered a style in the blog matching that former website&#x27;s sarcastic attitude, and even the name &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot; was taken from what had been a weekly news roundup column on Suck.com. &quot;Reason&quot; editors referred to this co-opting of the former website as the &quot;&quot;Suck&quot;-ification of &quot;Reason&quot;&quot;.

In 2005, Hit &amp; Run was named as one of the best political blogs by &quot;Playboy&quot;.

==Reason TV==
&quot;Reason TV&quot; is a YouTube channel affiliated with &quot;Reason&quot; magazine that produces short-form documentaries and video editorials. Nick Gillespie is editor-in-chief. The site produced a series of videos called &quot;The Drew Carey Project&quot; hosted by comedian Drew Carey. &quot;Reason TV&quot; teamed with Carey again in 2009 to produce &quot;Reason Saves Cleveland&quot;, in which Carey suggested free market solutions to his hometown&#x27;s problems.

Since 2010, comedian Remy Munasifi has partnered with &quot;Reason TV&quot; to produce parody videos. Since 2017, John Stossel has produced more than 100 commentary segments published on the &quot;Reason TV&quot; YouTube channel.

&quot;Reason TV&quot; has a playlist called &quot;Great Moments in Unintended Consequences&quot; which examines historical and contemporary examples of government regulations producing unintended consequences.

== Reason podcasts ==
Reason has multiple podcast series, including &quot;Reason Roundtable&quot;, a weekly podcast in which the editors &quot;discuss and debate the week’s biggest stories and what fresh hell awaits us all&quot;. 

&quot;The Reason Interview with Nick Gillespie&quot;, is a podcast series in which editor at large, Nick Gillespie interviews activists, artists, authors, entrepreneurs, newsmakers, and politicians on current issues such as free speech, censorship, gun control, COVID-19 regulations, institutions such as the FBI, geopolitics and more. The podcast occasionally focuses on historical topics, such as pacifism during World War 2 and the philosophical views of Adam Smith and Ayn Rand. 

&quot;The Soho Forum Debates&quot; is moderated by Gene Epstein and features live debates between public intellectuals on current issues such as bitcoin, electric vehicles, government debt, illegal drugs, robotics, and sex work. 

The podcast series &quot;Why We Can&#x27;t Have Nice Things&quot; is a six part series about American trade policy and its impacts on the economy, such as the 2022 United States infant formula shortage.

<text>Character () is a 1997 Dutch-Belgian drama film, based on the best-selling novel by Ferdinand Bordewijk and directed by Mike van Diem. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Academy Awards. The film stars Fedja van Huêt, Jan Decleir, and Betty Schuurman.

==Plot==
In 1920&#x27;s Rotterdam, A.B. Dreverhaven, a dreaded bailiff, is found dead, with a knife stuck in his stomach. The obvious suspect is Jacob Willem Katadreuffe, an ambitious young lawyer who worked his way up from poverty, always managing to overcome Dreverhaven&#x27;s personal attacks against him. Katadreuffe was seen leaving Dreverhaven&#x27;s office on the afternoon of the murder. He is arrested and taken to police headquarters, where he reflects back on the story of his long relationship with Dreverhaven, who, police learn, is also Katadreuffe&#x27;s father.

The story begins when Katadreuffe&#x27;s taciturn mother, Joba, worked as a housekeeper for Dreverhaven. During that time, they had sex only once (it is implied that the encounter was forced upon Joba). She becomes pregnant and leaves her employer to make a living for herself and her son. Time and again, she rejects Dreverhaven&#x27;s offers by mail of money and marriage.

Even as a child, Katadreuffe finds that his path crosses with Dreverhaven, often with dire consequences. When he is arrested for becoming involved in a boyish theft and tells the police that Dreverhaven is his father, Dreverhaven refuses to recognize him as his son. When, as a young man, he unwittingly takes a loan from a bank that Dreverhaven owns to purchase a failed cigar store, Dreverhaven sues him to win the money back and force him into bankruptcy. Still, Katadreuffe manages to pay back the debt, finding a clerical position in the law firm retained to pursue him for his cigar-store debt. He manages to secure this job, even though most of his education is derived from reading an incomplete English-language encyclopedia that he found as a boy in his mother&#x27;s apartment; studying this set, he managed to teach himself English, which turns out to be a valuable talent in the eyes of his employers.

After paying back the cigar-store debt, Katadreuffe immediately seeks a second loan from Dreverhaven, so that he can finance his education and legal studies and, ultimately, take and pass the bar examination. Dreverhaven agrees, on the condition that he can call back the loan at any time. Despite the bailiff&#x27;s efforts to hinder his son, Katadreuffe passes his bar examination and qualifies as a lawyer. On the afternoon when his firm holds a celebration of his becoming a lawyer (the day with which the film begins, the day of the murder), Katadreuffe storms into Dreverhaven&#x27;s office to confront his lifelong tormentor, the bailiff. Katadreuffe reacts with rage to Dreverhaven&#x27;s congratulations, and his offer of a handshake, and, though he at first turns to leave, he runs toward Dreverhaven and attempts to attack him. After a bloody and angry brawl, Katadreuffe is witnessed leaving the bailiff&#x27;s office.

However, the police discover that Katadreuffe left Dreverhaven at 5:00 p.m., though an examination of the bailiff&#x27;s body reveals that Dreverhaven died at 11:00 p.m. The police finally reveal to Katadreuffe that Dreverhaven actually committed suicide. After Katadreuffe is cleared, a police official hands him a document, left by Dreverhaven&#x27;s lawyer, that turns out to be the bailiff&#x27;s will, which leaves all of his considerable wealth to Katadreuffe. The will is signed &quot;Vader&quot; (Father).

<doc id="334158" wikidata="Q234451" url="?curid=334158" title="Himiko">
<text>, also known as the , was a shamaness-queen of Yamatai-koku in . Early Chinese dynastic histories chronicle tributary relations between Queen Himiko and the Cao Wei Kingdom (220–265) and record that the Yayoi period people chose her as ruler following decades of warfare among the kings of Wa. Early Japanese histories do not mention Himiko, but historians associate her with legendary figures such as Empress Consort Jingū, who is said to have served as regent from 201 to 269.

Scholarly debates over the identity of Himiko and the location of her domain, Yamatai, have raged since the late Edo period, with opinions divided between northern Kyūshū or traditional Yamato Province in present-day Kinki. The &quot;Yamatai controversy&quot;, writes Keiji Imamura, is &quot;the greatest debate over the ancient history of Japan.&quot; A prevailing view among scholars is that she may be buried at Hashihaka Kofun in Nara Prefecture.

==Historical references==
The shaman Queen Himiko is recorded in various ancient histories, dating back to 3rd-century China, 8th-century Japan, and 12th-century Korea.

===Chinese sources===
The first historical records of Himiko are found in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (, ), a Chinese classic text dating to . However, rather than &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Japanese scholars use the term of , a Japanese abbreviation for the account of Wajin in the &quot;Biographies of the Wuhuan, Xianbei, and Dongyi&quot; (), Volume 30 of the &quot;Book of Wei&quot; () of the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (). This section is the first description of Himiko (Pimiko) and Yamatai:

This early history describes how Himiko came to the throne:

The &quot;Records of Wei&quot; also records envoys travelling between the Wa and Wei courts. Himiko&#x27;s emissaries first visited the court of Wei emperor Cao Rui in 238, and he replied:

Finally, the &quot;Records of Wei&quot; records that in 247 when a new governor arrived at Daifang Commandery in Korea, Queen Himiko officially complained of hostilities with , the king of Kuna (ja) (, literally &quot;dog slave&quot;), one of the other Wa states. The governor dispatched &quot;Chang Chêng, acting Secretary of the Border Guard&quot; with a &quot;proclamation advising reconciliation&quot;, and subsequently:

Commentators take this &#x27;Iyo&#x27; (, with , &quot;one&quot;, an old variant of ) as a miscopy of Toyo (, with &quot;platform; terrace&quot;) paralleling the writing () as ().

Two other Chinese dynastic histories mentioned Himiko. While both clearly incorporated the reports, they made some changes, such as specifying the &quot;some seventy or eighty years&quot; of Wa wars occurred between 146 and 189, during the reigns of Han Emperors Huan and Ling. The &quot;Book of Later Han&quot; ( ) says &quot;the King of Great Wa resides in the country of Yamadai&quot;, rather than the Queen:

The 636 &quot;Book of Sui&quot; (, ) changes the number of Himiko&#x27;s male attendants:

===Japanese sources===
Neither of the two oldest Japanese histories – the nor – mentions Queen Himiko. The circumstances under which these books were written is a matter of unending debate, and even if Himiko were known to the authors, they may have purposefully decided not to include her. However, they include three imperial-family shamans identified with her: Yamatototohimomosohime-no-Mikoto (ja), the aunt of Emperor Sujin (legendary 10th Japanese emperor, reigned 97–30 BC) and daughter of Emperor Kōrei; Yamatohime-no-mikoto, the daughter of Emperor Suinin (legendary 11th, reigned 29 BC–70 AD); and Empress Jingū (reigned AD), the wife of Emperor Chūai (legendary 14th emperor, reigned 192–200 AD). These dates, however, are not historically verified.

One remarkable exception to early Japanese histories overlooking Himiko is the , quoting the three times. In 239, &quot;the queen [] of Wa&quot; sent envoys to Wei; in 240, they returned &quot;charged with an Imperial rescript and a seal and ribbon;&quot; and in 243, &quot;the ruler [ &quot;king&quot;] of Wa again sent high officers as envoys with tribute&quot;.

, the shaman aunt of Emperor Sujin, supposedly committed suicide after learning her husband was a trickster snake-god. The does not mention her, but the describes her as &quot;the Emperor&#x27;s aunt by the father&#x27;s side, a shrewd and intelligent person, who could foresee the future&quot;. After a series of national calamities, the Emperor &quot;assembled the 80 myriads of Deities&quot; and inquired by divination. Yamato-totohi-momoso was inspired by Ōmononushi-nushi (&quot;Great Deity of All Deities and Spirits&quot;), to say: &quot;Why is the Emperor grieved at the disordered state of the country? If he duly did us reverent worship it would assuredly become pacified of itself.&quot; The Emperor inquired, saying: &quot;What God is it that thus instructs me?&quot; The answer was: &quot;I am the God who dwells within the borders of the land of Yamato, and my name is Oho-mono-nushi no Kami.&quot; While imperial worship of this god (from Mount Miwa) was &quot;without effect&quot;, Yamato-totohi-momoso later married him.

The Kofun in Sakurai, Nara is associated with this legend.

, the daughter of Emperor Suinin, supposedly founded the Ise Shrine to the sun-goddess Amaterasu. The records her as the fourth of Suinin&#x27;s five children, &quot;Her Augustness Yamato-hime, (was the high-priestess of the temple of the Great Deity of Ise)&quot;. The likewise records &quot;Yamato-hime no Mikoto&quot; and provides more details. The Emperor assigned Yamato-hime to find a permanent location for Amaterasu&#x27;s shrine, and after wandering for years, the sun-goddess instructed her to build it at Ise &quot;where she first descended from Heaven&quot;.

Empress Consort Jingū (or ) supposedly served as regent after the death of her husband Emperor Chūai () until the accession of her son Emperor Ōjin (legendary 15th emperor, ). The and have similar accounts. Emperor Chūai wanted to invade Kumaso, and while he was consulting with his ministers, Jingū conveyed a shamanistic message that he should invade Silla instead. Compare these:

The Emperor thought the gods were lying, said he had only seen ocean to the West, and then died, either immediately () or after invading Kumaso (). Jingū allegedly discovered she was pregnant, personally planned and led a successful conquest of Silla, gave birth to the future emperor, and returned to rule Yamato. The adds that since Jingū wanted to learn which gods had cursed Chūai, she constructed a shamanic &quot;palace of worship&quot;, &quot;discharged in person the office of priest&quot;, and heard the gods reveal themselves as coming from Ise (Amaterasu) and Mukatsu (an unnamed Korean divinity). Although the and myth-histories called Jingū first of the Japanese empresses, Meiji period historians removed her from the List of Emperors of Japan, leaving Empress Suiko () as the first historically verifiable female Japanese ruler.

===Korean sources===
The oldest extant Korean history text, the (, &quot;Chronicles of the Three [Korean] Kingdoms&quot;, completed in 1145), records that Queen Himiko sent an emissary to King Adalla of Silla in May 173.

==Interpretations==
Researchers have struggled to reconcile Himiko/Pimiko between Chinese and Japanese historical sources. While the described her as an important ruler in 3rd-century Japan, early Japanese historians purposely avoided naming Himiko, even when the quoted the about envoys from Wa.

===Name===
The three Chinese characters (simplified: ) transcribing the Wa regent&#x27;s name are read or in Modern Japanese and or in Modern Standard Chinese.

However, these contemporary readings differ considerably from how &#x27;Himiko&#x27; was pronounced in the 3rd century, both by speakers of the unknown Wa-language and by Chinese scribes who transcribed it. While transliteration into Chinese characters of foreign words is complex, the choice of these three particular characters is puzzling, with literal meanings &quot;low; inferior; humble&quot;, () &quot;fill, cover; full; whole, complete&quot;, and &quot;breathe out; exhale; cry out; call&quot;.

In terms of historical Chinese phonology, the modern () is simpler than its presumed 3rd-century late Old Chinese or early Middle Chinese pronunciation. Compare the following reconstructions of the name in Archaic Chinese or Middle Chinese (Bernhard Karlgren, Li Fanggui, and William H. Baxter), Early Middle Chinese (Edwin G. Pulleyblank), and, historically closest, Late Han Chinese (Axel Schuessler).
* (Karlgren)
* (Li)
* (Baxter)
* or (Pulleyblank)
* (Schuessler)

In terms of Japanese phonology (which historically did not have the consonant /h/ and whose modern /h/ evolves from historical /p/), the accepted modern reading of &#x27;Himiko&#x27; would regularly correspond to Old Japanese . However, Roy Andrew Miller says is a lexicographic error deriving from the transcriptions.

 (Old Japanese ), (, &quot;young noblewoman; princess&quot;), explains Miller, etymologically derives from () (, &quot;sun&quot;) and () (, &quot;woman&quot;).

Tsunoda notes that &quot;Pimiko is from an archaic Japanese title, , meaning &#x27;princess&#x27;&quot;; that is, with the female name suffix (, &quot;child&quot;), viz. the uncommon given name Himeko. Other Amaterasu-related etymological proposals for the Japanese name Himiko involve (, &quot;sun&quot;) and ( or , &quot;female shaman, shamaness; shrine maiden; priestess&quot;); or their combination , &quot;princess-priestess&quot;.

Bentley considers the Baekje word , &#x27;west&#x27;, the honorific prefix and , &#x27;heir&#x27;, and thus interprets as &#x27;the honorific heir of the west&#x27;.

===Identity and historicity===
Identifying Himiko/Pimiko of Wa is straightforward within the history of China, but problematic within the history of Japan. The 3rd-century Chinese (&quot;Records of Wei&quot;) provides details about shaman Queen Himiko and her communications with Emperors Cao Rui and Cao Fang. The 8th-century Japanese (&quot;Records of Ancient Matters&quot;) and the (&quot;Chronicles of Japan&quot;, which quotes the ) disregard Himiko, unless she was the subtext behind their accounts of Empress Jingū, Yamatohime-no-mikoto, or Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-hime-no-Mikoto.

None of these three legendary Japanese royal shamans adequately corresponds with the Chinese chronology and description of Himiko. Assuming the account that Himiko died around 248, if one accepts the dubious Japanese traditional dating, then she was closer to the 3rd-century AD Empress Jingū than to the 1st-century BC Yamato-hime-no-mikoto and Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-hime. On the other hand, if one accepts the postdating adjustments prior to the 4th century, then Himiko was closer to these Yamato-named shamans. Neither the nor the mentions Himiko or any of the salient topics that she was unmarried, was chosen as ruler by the people, had a younger brother who helped rule (unless this refers to Jingū&#x27;s son), or had numerous (figuratively &quot;1,000&quot;) female attendants.

William Wayne Farris reviews the history of scholarly debates over Himiko and her domain Yamatai. The Edo-period philosophers Arai Hakuseki and Motoori Norinaga began the controversies over whether Yamatai was located in Northern Kyushu or Yamato Province in the Kinki region of central Honshū and whether the or the was historically more trustworthy. The Confucianist Arai accepted the Chinese history as more reliable, and first equated Himiko with Jingū and Yamatai with Yamato. The scholar Motoori accepted the traditional Japanese myth-history as more reliable, and dismissed its quotations as later accretions. He hypothesized that a king from Kumaso sent emissaries who masqueraded as Jingū&#x27;s officials to the Wei court, thus leading Wei to mistake them for representatives of Himiko. Farris states that &quot;Motoori&#x27;s usurpation hypothesis () carried great weight for the next century.&quot;

Rather than being linked with Yamataikoku (regardless of wherever Yamataikoku was), Himiko may have been instead linked with (which Tsunoda located in near present-day Hakata in northern Kyūshū), whereto was sent a golden royal seal, by Emperor Guangwu of the Han dynasty. Nakoku is said to have existed from the 1st century to the early 3rd century, and seems to have been independent or even a rival of the current Imperial House of Japan, supposedly in Yamato, Honshū. Even so, both the and recorded that the current imperial dynasty, starting with Jimmu, originated from the Kumaso territory of Takachiho, Hyūga Province in present-day Kyushu&#x27;s southeastern section. The Kumaso were also associated with , ruled by Himiko&#x27;s rival, king Himikuko.

After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japanese historians adopted European historical scholarship, especially the source-based methodology of Leopold von Ranke. Naka Michiyo believed the chronology was inaccurate prior to the 4th century, and thus &quot;Jingū became a fourth-century queen whose reign could not possibly have coincided with Himiko&#x27;s.&quot; The sinologist Shiratori Kurakichi proposed the compilers were tempted to associate Jingū with the religious powers of Himiko. Naitō Torajirō argued that Himiko was the high priestess of the Ise shrine Yamato-hime-no-mikoto and that Wa armies obtained control of southern Korea:

Some later Japanese historians reframed Himiko in terms of Marxist historiography. Masaaki Ueda argued that &quot;Himiko&#x27;s was a despotic state with a generalized slave system&quot; , while Mitsusada Inoue idealized Yamatai as a &quot;balance of small states&quot; with communal property and popular political expression. Following the late 1960s &quot;Yamatai boom&quot;, when numerous Japanese historians, linguists, and archeologists published reevaluations of Himiko and Yamatai, the debate was joined by Japanese nationalists, mystery writers, and amateur scholars.

In Japanese historical and archeological periodization, the 2nd- and 3rd-century era of Queen Himiko was between late Yayoi period and early Kofun period. refers to characteristic keyhole-shaped burial mounds, and the noting &quot;a great mound was raised, more than a hundred paces in diameter&quot; for Pimiko&#x27;s tomb, may well be the earliest written record of a . Several archeological excavations of Yayoi and Kofun sites in kinki region, have revealed Chinese-style bronze mirrors, called . Many scholars who support the Kinki theory associate these with the &quot;one hundred bronze mirrors&quot; that the records Emperor Cao Rui presented to Queen Himiko, while other scholars oppose it. The Hashihaka Kofun in Sakurai, Nara was given a recent boost by radio-carbon dating circa 240–60. The early Chinese records of Himiko/Pimiko and her Yamatai polity remain something of a Rorschach test. To different interpreters, this early Japanese shaman queen can appear as evidence of communalism (Marxists), Jōmon priestess rulers (Feminist history), the Japanese conquest of Korea, the Mongolian conquest of Japan (Namio Egami&#x27;s &quot;horserider theory&quot; (ja)), the imperial system originating with tandem rule by a female shaman and male monarch, the &quot;patriarchal revolution&quot; replacing female deities and priestesses with male counterparts, or a shamanic advisor to the federation of Wa chieftains who &quot;must have looked like a ruling queen to Chinese envoys&quot;.

== Modern depictions ==

Depictions of Himiko in Japanese popular media take one of three archetypes: Himiko as a wise, old ruler; Himiko the cute and energetic shaman; or Himiko as a seductive sorceress. She is associated with several ritual objects including the – two large bronze bells ritually used at the end of the Yayoi period – as well as the branch and Chinese bronze mirrors. The described Himiko&#x27;s shamanism as , or Japanese , a type of Daoist folk religion. As such, Himiko is sometimes negatively associated with black magic or demons. Ruling in the transitional period between the Yayoi and Kofun eras, depictions of Himiko often display her wearing clothing originating from a variety of time periods, often embodied masculine elements. A queen during the late Yayoi, Himiko likely wore a one-piece, wide-sleeved under a vest and sash. She is also often depicted wearing beads and a diadem. However, no one can be certain what Himiko wore.

<text>William Cowper Brann (January 4, 1855 – April 2, 1898) was an American journalist also known as Brann the Iconoclast. During his life, he gained a reputation as a &quot;brilliant though vitriolic editorialist.&quot; He defended lynching Black men accused of rape and called for opponents of this type of mob violence to be castrated.

== Early life ==
The son of Presbyterian minister Noble J. Brann, he was born in Humboldt, Illinois. When his mother died in 1857, he was sent by his father to live with William and Mary Hawkins, where he stayed until 1868. That year, he ran away from home and took odd jobs in several cities, including working as a painter&#x27;s helper, a bellboy at a hotel, manager of an opera company, a pitcher in semiprofessional baseball, and a fireman and brakeman on a locomotive.

A job in a print shop turned Brann&#x27;s interest toward journalism, and he became a cub reporter. As his career progressed, he worked in St. Louis, Galveston, Houston, and San Antonio. While in Rochelle, Illinois in 1877, he married Carrie Belle Martin, with whom he had one son and two daughters.

==Career==
During the 1880s Brann began to take his career in journalism seriously and traveled around the country working for several significant newspapers, including the &quot;St. Louis Globe Democrat&quot;, the &quot;Galveston Evening Tribune&quot;, and the &quot;Galveston News&quot;. At the same time, Brann registered three plays with the Library of Congress: &quot;Cleon&quot;, &quot;That American Woman&quot;, and &quot;Retribution&quot;. Despite his growing success, Brann&#x27;s family was shaken by the suicide of his twelve-year-old daughter Inez in 1890, which greatly agonized Brann. Brann coped with this tragedy, and was inspired to continue to strive towards a successful career in writing and journalism.

In 1891, only one year after his daughter&#x27;s death, Brann moved to Austin, Texas to write for the &quot;Austin Statesman&quot;. After only a short time, however, he decided to attempt to write his own paper, and invested a significant chunk of his personal savings into the &quot;Iconoclast&quot;. That paper quickly failed, and Brann went back to working for other Texas newspapers, the &quot;San Antonio Express&quot; and the &quot;Houston Post&quot;.

===Waco &quot;Iconoclast&quot;===
In 1894 Brann moved to Waco, Texas, to become an editor with the &quot;Waco Daily News&quot;. By February 1895 he had decided to attempt to revive the &quot;Iconoclast&quot;, and this time the paper was successful, with a circulation nearing 100,000 people. With this new platform to communicate his views, Brann quickly became known for his stinging, often hateful attacks on various groups that drew his ire, including Baptists, Episcopalians, the British, blacks, and Baylor University. Brann attacked perceived hypocrisy from the Baptists with his seething prose, saying &quot;I have nothing against the Baptists. I just believe they were not held under long enough&quot;. He devoted many paragraphs to his hatred of the wealthy eastern social elites, such as the Vanderbilt family, and deplored their marriages to titled Europeans. He characterized such marriages as diluting the elites&#x27; already-debased American stock with worthless foreign blood. He was equally critical of the New York social scene.

Baylor University, the prominent Baptist institution in Waco, drew constant criticism from Brann. He set off a scandal with allegations that Baylor President Rufus Burleson&#x27;s son-in-law&#x27;s brother Steen Morris, who lived with the Burleson family, had impregnated a student from Brazil. He alleged that male faculty members were having sexual relations with female students and any father sending his daughter to Baylor would be risking her rape. In Brann&#x27;s view, Baylor was, as he published, &quot;A factory for the manufacture of ministers and magdalenes.&quot; Brann&#x27;s constant attacks on the university enraged many of its supporters, and, on October 2, 1897, he was kidnapped by Baylor students who demanded that he retract his statements. Four days later, Brann was beaten by three men, including a local Baptist judge, who were angry that he had not left town.

==Legacy and death==
On April 1, 1898, Brann was walking alone on Waco&#x27;s Fourth Street when he was shot in the back by Tom Davis, a Baylor supporter whose daughter was a student at the university. After being shot, Brann turned, drew his pistol, and fired multiple shots at Davis, who fell, mortally wounded, in the doorway of the Jake French Cigar Store. Brann was shot through the left lung with the bullet exiting his chest. He was forced to walk to the city jail but later escorted home by friends. Both Davis and Brann died the next day. Brann is buried in Oakwood Cemetery, Waco. Engraved on Brann&#x27;s monument is the word &quot;TRUTH,&quot; and beneath it is a profile of Brann with a bullet hole in it. Brann remains a controversial figure to this day. 

==Personal life==
Brann married Carrie Belle Martin on March 3, 1877, in Rochelle, Illinois. They had three children. Their daughter, Inez, died at age 12 following a confrontation with her father regarding the attentions of a young boy who left flowers at the house for Inez, whom Brann accused of encouraging the boy&#x27;s interest. Her denial led him to accuse her of lying. The next morning, her mother and father found her dead after she had taken morphine. She left a note that said, in part, &quot;I don’t want to live. I could never be as good as you want me to.”

Brann&#x27;s papers are housed at the Harry Ransom Center of The University of Texas at Austin.

<text>Carlos Roberto Reina Idiáquez (March 13, 1926 – August 19, 2003) was a Honduran politician, lawyer and diplomat who served as the 32nd President of Honduras from January 27, 1994 to January 27, 1998. He was a member of the Honduran Liberal Party.

==Background==
He was born in the city of Comayagüela, Honduras. His wife, Bessie Watson, was an American citizen with whom he had two daughters. He completed university studies in the National Autonomous University of Honduras where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Juridical and Social Sciences. Later, Reina continued his postgraduate studies in the and 
cities of London and Paris.

==Political career==
Throughout his long political career Reina held a number of political governmental and international jobs, including judge in the court of Tegucigalpa, peace member of the international court of The Hague, Ambassador of Honduras to France, and president of the Central Executive Council (CCE) of the Liberal Party, among other important positions.

Reina was arrested several times for his political activities in opposition to the military governments during his younger years. The first time was in 1944 for protesting against dictator Tiburcio Carías. Later in the 1960s he was sent to prison twice by General Oswaldo López, who had taken over the Honduran government through the use of military force. This led Reina to become a fierce defender of human rights throughout the rest of his life. In 1979, he was nominated president of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights of the Organization of American States.

==President of Honduras (1994-1998)==
Carlos Reina became president in November 1993, with the Liberal Party of Honduras (PLH, &quot;Partido Liberal de Honduras&quot;), after defeating Oswaldo Ramos, the candidate of the National Party of Honduras with 56% of the vote. He was accompanied by his vice presidential candidate: retired General Walter López, Juan de la Cruz Avelar and Guadalupe Jerezano Mejía.

On January 27, 1994, Reina replaced president Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero. Reina inherited a relatively difficult economic situation from the existing nationalist administration. Foreign debt weighed heavily on the economy of the country: debt service represented 40% of Honduran exports. Even though approximately 700 million dollars were condoned to Honduras, the debt &#x27;was&#x27; still higher than that it had been at the beginnings of 1990.

In his first presidential speech Reina launched his moral revolution: &quot; I pledge my word of honor before God, before the people and before history, that we will go forward in this enterprise that we have imposed upon ourselves. We will defeat corruption; we will give currency to social liberalism. We will see the moral revolution to its end.&quot; The issue of whether his plan was a success or a failure is still highly controversial.

One of Carlos Roberto Reina&#x27;s main objectives during his government was the reform of the Armed Forces. His reforms were mostly realized by the end of his first year in office. The first one was the total transfer of all power in hands of military men to civilian authorities, followed by the abolition of compulsory military service in the country. These and other reforms to the military are also controversial to the ruling elites, they believed it fomented gangs, by eliminating a source of employment and education for young men.

In July 1996, Reina was awarded the Order of Brilliant Jade by Lee Teng-hui, President of the Republic of China.

==Post-presidency and death==
Carlos Roberto Reina finished his presidency on 27 January 1998. Later, in October 1998, Reina began his period as president of the Central American Parliament (Parlacén), where he remained until 28 October 1999. Finally on 19 August 2003, Carlos Roberto Reina killed himself with a gunshot at the age of 77. His brother revealed that Reina was suffering from health issues relating to the gallbladder and pancreas.

<text>William Barton Rogers (December 7, 1804 – May 30, 1882) was an American geologist, physicist, and the founder and first president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 

A acclaimed lecturer in the physical sciences, Rogers taught at College of William &amp; Mary (1828–1835) and the University of Virginia (1835–1853). While at the university, he served as Virginia&#x27;s first state geologist and led the state&#x27;s first geological survey. After meeting Emma Savage in Boston, he married and moved there in 1853. 

A proponent of practical observation and scientific reasoning, Rogers saw that a university for the &quot;useful arts&quot; could be essential in an age of industrial progress. In 1861, Rogers secured funding from the Massachusetts legislature for a school of the &quot;useful arts.&quot; When MIT opened in 1865, Rogers was its first president and physics instructor. Ill health caused him to step away from his duties in 1868, although he stayed active in forming the Institute&#x27;s curriculum, fundraising, and efforts at coeducation. He returned as MIT&#x27;s president in 1878, stepped down three years later, and died while giving MIT&#x27;s 1882 graduation speech.

During the time Rogers lived in Virginia, he was a slaveowner, with two slaves in his household in 1840 and six slaves in 1850; one, his cook, was Isabella Gibbons. 

==Biography==

===Early life===
Rogers was born on December 7, 1804, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the second son of Patrick Kerr Rogers and Hannah Blythe and was of Irish, Scottish, and English extraction. Patrick Rogers was born in Newtownstewart, County Tyrone, Ireland and had immigrated at the end of the 18th century to America, where he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and practiced medicine. When William Barton was born, Patrick Rogers was tutor at Penn. In 1819 Patrick Rogers became professor of natural philosophy and mathematics at the College of William and Mary, where he remained until his death.

William Barton Rogers had three brothers: James Blythe Rogers (1802–1852), Henry Darwin Rogers (1808–1866), and Robert Empie Rogers (1813–1884). The Rogers brothers would each grow up to be distinguished scientists.

===Education===
William Barton Rogers was educated by his father Patrick Kerr Rogers and attended the public schools of Baltimore, Maryland. In 1819, his father was appointed as professor of natural history and chemistry at the College of William and Mary in Virginia and the family moved to Williamsburg, Virginia. According to MIT Libraries, William Barton Rogers attended the College of William and Mary from 1819 to 1824, but he &quot;apparently did not receive a degree&quot; and there was no evidence showing that he graduated.

===Scientific career===
William Barton Rogers delivered a series of lectures on science before the Maryland Institute in 1827, and succeeded his father as professor of natural philosophy and chemistry at William and Mary in 1828, where he remained until 1835. During this time, he carried on investigations on dew and on the voltaic battery, and prepared a series of papers on the greensand and calcareous marl minerals of eastern Virginia and their value as fertilizers. 

====Field geology (1833–1842)====
In 1833, his brother Henry had returned from England filled with enthusiasm for geology, and this had prompted Rogers to begin studies in the field. The practical value of his article on greensand caught the eye of the Virginia legislature. Rogers took this opportunity to lobby for a geological survey of Virginia, and he was called upon to organize it in 1835. That same year, he and his brother Henry were elected members of the American Philosophical Society.
By 1835, his brother Henry was state geologist of Pennsylvania, and together the brothers unfolded the historical geology of the Appalachian chain. Among their joint special investigations were the study of the solvent action of water on various minerals and rocks, and the demonstration that &quot;coal beds stand in close genetic relation to the amount of disturbance to which the inclosing strata have been submitted, the coal becoming harder and containing less volatile matter as the evidence of the disturbance increases&quot;. In modern terms, this was the realization that the geological process of metamorphism had gradually transformed softer grades of coal, such as lignite, into harder grades, such as anthracite.

Together, the brothers published a paper on &quot;The Laws of Structure of the more Disturbed Zones of the Earth&#x27;s Crust&quot;, in which the wave theory of mountain chains was first announced. This was followed later by William Rogers&#x27; statement of the law of distribution of geological faults. These pioneering works contributed to a better understanding of the vast coal beds underlying some parts of the Appalachian region, and helped pave the way for the Industrial Revolution in the United States.

In 1842 the work of the survey closed. State revenues had shrunk beginning in 1837, and the funding for the survey had been cut back. Meanwhile, Rogers had published six &quot;Reports of the Geological Survey of the State of Virginia&quot; (Richmond, 1836–40), though there were few copies, and recognition of their significance was slow to develop. They were later compiled by Jed Hotchkiss and issued in one volume with a map as &quot;Papers on the Geology of Virginia&quot; (New York, 1884).

====University of Virginia appointment (1835–1853)====
In 1835 Rogers also began serving as professor of &quot;natural philosophy&quot; at the University of Virginia (UVa). There he added mineralogy and geology to the curriculum, and did original research in geology, chemistry and physics. While he was chair of the department of philosophy at UVA, he vigorously defended to the Virginia State Legislature the university&#x27;s refusal to award honorary degrees, a policy which continues today. (Later, MIT would adopt a similar policy from its beginning, and continuing to the present). 

During the time Rogers lived in Virginia, he was a slaveowner, with two slaves in his household in 1840 and six slaves in 1850; one, his cook, was Isabella Gibbons. 

====Move to Boston====
In 1849, he married Emma Savage of Boston, daughter of James Savage, a prominent banker. In 1853 he resigned from the University of Virginia, moving to Boston for two principal reasons. First, he wanted to increase his participation in scientific circles under the auspices of the Boston Society of Natural History and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, in whose proceedings and in the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot; his papers had been published while at Virginia. Second, and more importantly, Rogers wanted to implement a scheme for technical education, which could not be achieved within the structure and institutional focuses of UVa. He desired to have associated, on one side, scientific research and investigation on the largest scale and, on the other side, agencies for the popular diffusion of useful knowledge. This project continued to occupy his attention until it culminated in the chartering of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1861), of which he became first president.

To raise funds and public awareness of his new Institute, Rogers delivered a course of lectures before the Lowell Institute on &quot;The Application of Science to the Arts&quot; in 1862.

In 1861, he was appointed inspector of gas and gas meters for the state of Massachusetts, a post he accepted reluctantly. During his service, he improved the standards of measurement.

===MIT Presidency===
For more detail, see History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

An act of the Massachusetts State Legislature incorporated MIT in 1861, and Rogers became its first president in 1862. He served as president of MIT until 1870, when he stood down because of declining health. By necessity, he returned to office in 1878 and continued to 1881, when he was made professor emeritus of physics and geology, which position he had held while he was president.

He died after collapsing during a speech at MIT&#x27;s 1882 commencement exercises. According to legend his last words were &quot;bituminous coal&quot;:

=== Other affiliations ===
Rogers was chairman of the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists (AAGN; organized 1840) in 1845 and again in 1847, and contributed important memoirs to its &quot;Transactions&quot;, including observations on the temperature of coal mines in eastern Virginia. In 1847 he also called to order the first meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), an enlargement of the AAGN. He was president of the AAAS in 1875, and elected its first honorary fellow in 1881, as a special mark of distinction. He was active in founding the American Social Science Association and its first president; also he was one of the corporate members of the National Academy of Sciences, and its president from 1878 until his death. In 1866, Harvard gave him the degree of LL.D.

== Legacy ==
Because of his affiliation with Virginia, Mount Rogers, the highest peak in the state, is named after him.

== Works ==
Besides numerous papers on geology, chemistry, and physics, contributed to the proceedings of societies and technical journals, he was the author of:

* &quot;Strength of Materials&quot; (Charlottesville, 1838)
* &quot;Elements of Mechanical Philosophy&quot; (Boston, 1852)
* &quot;Papers on the Geology of Virginia&quot; (New York, 1884)

<doc id="334169" wikidata="Q263972" url="?curid=334169" title="Prince Shōtoku">
<text>, also known as or , was a semi-legendary regent and a politician of the Asuka period in Japan who served under Empress Suiko. He was the son of Emperor Yōmei and his consort, Princess Anahobe no Hashihito, who was also Yōmei&#x27;s younger half-sister. But later, he was adopted by Prince Shōtoken. His parents were relatives of the ruling Soga clan and also he was involved in the defeat of the rival Mononobe clan. The primary source of the life and accomplishments of Prince Shōtoku comes from the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;. The Prince is renowned for modernizing the government administration and for promoting Buddhism in Japan. He also had two different families that fought over his custody.

Over successive generations, a devotional cult arose around the figure of Prince Shōtoku for the protection of Japan, the Imperial Family, and for Buddhism. Key religious figures such as Saichō, Shinran and others claimed inspiration or visions attributed to Prince Shōtoku.

==Biography==

According to tradition, Shōtoku was appointed regent (&quot;Sesshō&quot;) in 593 by Empress Suiko (554–628), his aunt. Shōtoku, inspired by the Buddha&#x27;s teachings, succeeded in establishing a centralized government during his reign. In 603, he established the Twelve Level Cap and Rank System at the court. He is credited with promulgating the seventeen-article constitution.

Shōtoku was an ardent Buddhist and is traditionally attributed the authorship of the &quot;Sangyō Gisho&quot; or &quot;Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras&quot; (the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Vimalakirti Sutra&quot;, and the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot;). The first of these commentaries, &quot;Hokke Gisho&quot;, is traditionally dated to 615 and thus regarded as &quot;the first Japanese text&quot;, in turn making Shōtoku the first known Japanese writer.

In the late 6th century, Shōtoku led an enormous national project to promote Buddhism and he commissioned the construction of Shitennō-ji. The Buddhist temple was built in Settsu Province (present-day Osaka) after his military victory against the powerful Mononobe clan, for he is said to have summoned them to crush his enemies. Shōtoku&#x27;s name has been linked with Hōryū-ji, a temple in Yamato Province, and numerous other temples in the Kansai region. Documentation at Hōryū-ji claims that Suiko and Shōtoku founded the temple in the year 607. Archaeological excavations in 1939 have confirmed that Prince Shōtoku&#x27;s palace, the &quot;Ikaruga no miya&quot; (斑鳩宮), stood in the eastern part of the current temple complex, where the &quot;Tō-in&quot; () sits today. Despite being credited as the founder of Japanese Buddhism, it is also said that the Prince respected Shinto and never visited Buddhist temples without visiting Shinto shrines. A popular quote attributed to Shōtoku that became foundational for Buddhist belief in Japan is translated as &quot;The world is vain and illusory, and the Buddha&#x27;s realm alone is true.&quot;

In his correspondence with Emperor Yang of Sui, Shōtoku&#x27;s letter contains the earliest known written instance in which the Japanese archipelago is referred to by a term meaning &quot;land of the rising sun.&quot; The Sui Emperor had dispatched a message in 605 that said, &quot;the sovereign of Sui respectfully inquires about the sovereign of Wa,&quot; and Shōtoku responded by sponsoring a mission led by Ono no Imoko in 607, who brought along a note reading: &quot;From the sovereign of the land of the rising sun (&quot;hi izuru tokoro&quot;) to the sovereign of the land of the setting sun.&quot;

He is said to have been buried at Shinaga in Kawachi Province (modern Osaka Prefecture).

==Legends==

A legend claims that when Bodhidharma came to Japan, he met with Prince Shōtoku whilst under the guise of a starving beggar. The Prince asked the beggar to identify himself, but the man did not reply. Instead of going ahead, Shōtoku gave him food, drink, and covered him with his purple garment, telling him to &quot;lie in peace&quot;. Shōtoku then sang for the starving man.
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Alas! For&quot;
&quot;The wayfarer lying&quot;
&quot;And hungered for rice&quot;
&quot;On the hill of Kataoka&quot;
(The sunshiny)
&quot;Art thou become&quot;
&quot;Parentless?&quot;
&quot;Hast thou no lord&quot;
&quot;Flourishing as a bamboo?&quot;
&quot;Alas! For&quot;
&quot;The wayfarer lying&quot;
&quot;And hungered for rice!&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

The second day, Shōtoku sent a messenger to the starving man, but he was already dead. Hereupon, he was greatly grieved and ordered his burial. Shōtoku later thought the man was no ordinary man for sure, and sending another messenger, discovered the earth had not been disturbed. On opening the tomb there was no body inside, and the Prince&#x27;s purple garment lay folded on the coffin. The Prince then sent another messenger to claim the garment, and he continued to wear it just as before. Struck by awe, the people praised the Prince: &quot;How true it is that a sage knoweth a sage.&quot; This legend is linked with the temple of Daruma-ji in Ōji, Nara, where a stone stupa was found underground, which is exceedingly rare.

==Titles and name==
Shōtoku is known by several titles, although his real name is since he was born in front of a stable. He is also known as or . He is also known for bearing the Sanskrit Dharma name Bhavyaśīla which was awarded to him by Bodhidharma. In the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, his name appears as . In the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, in addition to &quot;Umayado no ōji&quot;, he is referred to as &quot;Toyosamimi Shōtoku&quot; (豊聡耳聖徳), &quot;Toyosatomimi no Nori no Ōkami&quot; (豊聡耳法大王), and simply &quot;Nori no Ushi no Ōkami&quot; (法主王).

The name by which he is best known today, &quot;Prince Shōtoku&quot;, first appeared in &quot;Kaifūsō&quot;, written more than 100 years after his death in 622 AD.

==Legacy==

A number of institutes are named after Shōtoku, such as Shotoku Gakuen University and its associated junior college (both in Gifu). The first syllable of his name (聖), can be read &quot;shō&quot; in Go-on and can also be read &quot;sei&quot; in Kan-on. The later reading is found in Seitoku University and its associated junior college (both in Matsudo, Chiba) as well as Tokyo&#x27;s defunct Seitoku Junior College of Nutrition (and indirectly its replacement Seiei College).
