<text>Andrés José Salvador Garchitorena Yllana Jr. (born April 24, 1968), known professionally as Anjo Yllana, is a Filipino actor-comedian, television host and politician. He is one of the hosts from &quot;Eat Bulaga!&quot; from 1998 until 2020.

==Career==
Yllana started in show business in 1984 with talent manager the late Douglas Quijano. He then auditioned for the teen TV variety show &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; after attempting a career as a professional basketball player. He started with support roles in both comedy and drama. He was nominated by different award-giving bodies as Best Supporting Actor in the movie &quot;Itanong Mo sa Buwan&quot;, starring opposite Jaclyn Jose and directed by Chito S. Roño.

His turning point in show business came in 1991, when he was given the role of Dino Tengco, the mentally disabled son of the crazy politician couple Barbara and Anding Tengco in the ABS-CBN satirical sitcom &quot;Abangan Ang Susunod Na Kabanata&quot;. He was awarded Best Comedy Actor by Star Awards in 1992 for his efforts. He was subsequently launched as a solo comedian and had several successful comedy films to his name, among them &quot;Dino, Abangan ang Susunod Na...&quot; (his launching movie), &quot;Pempe ni Sara at Pen&quot; (with Kris Aquino and Vandolph) and &quot;Milyonaryong Mini&quot; (with John Estrada and Sheryl Cruz). He also became part of the sitcoms &quot;Ober da Bakod&quot; (GMA Network) and &quot;Palibhasa Lalake&quot; (ABS-CBN). His stint in the latter sitcom cost him his role in &quot;Ober da Bakod&quot; after he decided to become an exclusive ABS-CBN talent.

After &quot;Abangan Ang Susunod Na Kabanata&quot; ended its run, Anjo turned to TV directing via the GMA Network sitcom &quot;M.U.?&quot; which starred his brother Jomari Yllana as well as Gelli de Belen. Soon after, in 1999, he moved to GMA Network after ending his contract with ABS-CBN and started hosting the long-running noontime show &quot;Eat Bulaga!&quot;. His former comic tandem with Janno Gibbs in &quot;Ober da Bakod&quot; was revived via &quot;Beh Bote Nga&quot; (1999-2003) and &quot;Nuts Entertainment&quot; (2003-2007). They also appeared together in &quot;Eat Bulaga!&quot; until Janno resigned from the show to start acting in GMA soap operas. His last solo TV show was &quot;Cool Center&quot; where he formed a hilarious tandem with Eugene Domingo from 2008 to 2009.

In 2020, he finally resigned from &quot;Eat Bulaga!&quot; after 21 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With no other shows from his former network GMA Network, Yllana accepted Net 25&#x27;s offer as the lead host of the UHF network&#x27;s first noontime comedy variety program, &quot;Happy Time&quot; along with other co-hosts that are also formerly from &quot;Eat Bulaga!&quot; - Kitkat and Janno Gibbs. The show also served as the reunion of Anjo &amp; Janno tandem since &quot;Ober Da Bakod&quot;, &quot;Beh Bote Nga&quot;, &quot;Nuts Entertainment&quot; and &quot;Eat Bulaga!&quot;. As of 2021, he was cancelled/terminated from the show due to another bullying incident with the new hosts.

===Political career===
Yllana started ventured into politics in 1998 when he ran and won as city councilor of the 2nd district of Parañaque. He was reelected in 2001 and served for a total of two terms before seeking higher office. In 2004, he was elected vice mayor of the same city. In 2007, he lost in his bid for reelection to councilor Gustavo Tambunting. In 2010, he ran once again for vice mayor under the banner of Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino and as the running mate of Eduardo Zialcita, but lost.

In 2013, he ran for city councilor, this time in the newly created 5th district of Quezon City, which includes his home barangay Fairview. He was successfully reelected in 2016.

Yllana then transferred to Tinambac, Camarines Sur, and on October 4, 2021, he filed his certificate of candidacy to run for representative of the province&#x27;s 4th district in 2022. However, he withdrew from the race in November 2021, citing his health following his diagnosis with COVID-19 and money issues. He was reportedly substituted by comedian and former San Jose Mayor Tony Chavez, who would then go on to lose the race to incumbent Arnie Fuentebella.

In 2024, Yllana filed his certificate of candidacy to run for vice mayor of Calamba, Laguna, in 2025 as the running mate of former Mayor Timmy Chipeco, who is seeking a comeback.

<text>Georgetown is a large unincorporated community in the town of Halton Hills, Ontario, Canada, in the Regional Municipality of Halton. The town includes several small villages or settlements such as Norval, Limehouse, Stewarttown and Glen Williams near Georgetown and another large population centre, Acton. In 2016, the population of Georgetown was 42,123. It sits on the banks of the Credit River, approximately 40 km west of Toronto, and is part of the Greater Toronto Area. Georgetown was named after entrepreneur George Kennedy who settled in the area in 1821 and built several mills and other businesses.

==History==
By 1650, the Hurons had been wiped out by European diseases and the Iroquois. The region was now open to the Algonquian Ojibwa (also known as Mississauga). By 1850 the remaining Mississauga natives were removed to the Six Nations Reserve, where the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation Reserve was established.

===Early settlement===
Commencing in 1781, the British government purchased blocks of land from the Mississauga Nation. In 1818, they purchased land that later became the townships of Esquesing and Nassagaweya. The task of laying out the townships fell to Timothy Street and Abraham Nelles. Charles Kennedy was hired by Nelles to survey the northern part of Esquesing Township in 1819, and Charles Kennedy received a significant parcel of land as payment for his work. The brothers of Charles Kennedy, John, Morris, Samuel and George, all acquired land close to each another in the Silver Creek Valley. Charles Kennedy built a sawmill in a location where Main Street meets Wildwood Road today.

George Kennedy took advantage of the Silver Creek in the early 1820s to power a sawmill, and later a gristmill and foundry and then a woolen mill; a small settlement formed around the mills, often called &quot;Hungry Hollow&quot;. In 1828, John Galt of the Canada Company opened the York to Guelph Road (now Highway 7) which connected the settlement around George Kennedy&#x27;s Mill with other settlements in the area. The road also extended to Galt, to Guelph and to Goderich.

In 1837 the Barber brothers, including William and James, purchased land and the woolen mill and foundry from Kennedy in 1837; they renamed the settlement Georgetown. The brothers started the paper-making industry in 1854, using electricity produced by a dynamo at the Credit River. Their products included large volumes of wallpaper. John R. Barber&#x27;s home, Berwick Hall, still stands at Main and Park Streets. The business prospered for over 100 years. Other entrepreneurs arrived including Philo Dayfoot in the early 1840s, who started the local leather industry. In the 1850s, George Kennedy subdivided his land into small lots for sale to new settlers.

Esquesing Village (Stewarttown) was settled around 1818 and became the seat of the Township of Esquesing. It was also on the main north-south route to the steamships at Oakville. The Stewart Brothers had a successful mill in Esquesing Village, and James McNab had a prosperous mill in Norval.

In 1846, Norval had a population of about 200 inhabitants, served by two churches, various tradesmen, a grist mill, an oatmeal mill, a distillery, two stores and a tavern. Author Lucy Maud Montgomery who wrote the Anne of Green Gables series lived in Norval from 1926 to 1935 and considered it to be &quot;one of the prettiest villages in all Ontario&quot;.

The settlement of Glen Williams had been called Williamsburg but the name was changed in 1852 when the post office opened. The Barbers&#x27; brother-in-law, Benajah Williams, was one of the first settlers here and the community&#x27;s name was given in his honour. Limehouse, formerly Fountain Green, was a small settlement that grew after the railway arrived in the area in 1856; in addition to lime kilns (which opened in about 1840), a sawmill, blanket factory and paint factory opened in the village. In 1893, a fire destroyed the woollen mill, a paint factory and wood at the waterlime mill in Limehouse creating a serious financial problem for the settlement. The lime industry operated until 1917.

In 1846, Georgetown had a grist mill, sawmill, cloth factory, tavern, cabinet maker, foundry, chair maker, two tanneries, two tailors, two stores, three wagon makers, three shoemakers, and four blacksmiths. The population was about 700.

The Grand Trunk Railway arrived in 1856 and a line of the Hamilton and North-Western Railway reached the community about 20 years later. The two provided a convenient method for transporting not only passengers but manufactured goods. Hotels opened near the station, including the Railroad Exchange in a building that still stands. Georgetown was incorporated as a village in 1864. In 1869 the population was 1500; the Ontario Gazetteer mentioned Barber Brothers as a noted paper goods manufacturer with a staff of 40.

The settlement was incorporated as the village of Georgetown in 1865. The 1860s and 1870s were prosperous years. Recently opened businesses in that era included the &quot;Georgetown Herald&quot; newspaper, Culp and Mackenzie&#x27;s carriage making enterprise, the Creelman brothers&#x27; machine shop and the Bank of Hamilton, the first to open in the entire Halton County. By 1880, the Chapel Street School and Baptist Church and the Town Hall had been built; the high school opened in 1887.

Georgetown residents began to receive municipal water in 1891, piped by gravity. Electricity was not available until 1913 although John R. Barber had purchased a generator in 1888 and installed it at the Credit River; that provided power for the family&#x27;s paper mill.

On May 13, 1895, brothers Sam &amp; John McGibbon leased, in partnership, Thomas Clark&#x27;s Hotel for $600/year. The Hotel McGibbon was built by Robert Jones and was sold to Clark in about 1867. A double veranda graced the Main &amp; Mill Street side of the building until the hotel was ravaged by fire in the 1880s. After the fire, a third floor was added to part of the building. The McGibbon family lived at the hotel. Sam&#x27;s wife, Ann, kept white linen in the dining room, and in its earliest years had been a popular place for wedding receptions and banquets.

The Toronto Suburban Railway Company ran the Toronto-Guelph electric rail line through Georgetown opening opening 1917. The line, which transported both goods and passengers, had a combined station and substation building located at 29 Main Street South (at the current Goodfellas Pizza site). The line closed in 1931 after business had declined substantially. The venture failed because of the Depression and the increasing prevalence of the automobile, buses and trucks. Its proximity to the competing Grand Trunk Railway (Canadian National) line was also a factor.

By 1921 the village had over 2000 residents and was incorporated as a town in 1922, with LeRoy Dale as the first mayor. Many historic buildings still stand in the heart of Georgetown and in its small, more rural communities.

===Since World War II===
In the mid-1940s, the population was close to 4,000 and began to grow more quickly in the 1950s when Rex Heslop bought farms and developed the Delrex subdivision. The Hotel McGibbon was still operating although Sam McGibbon had died in 1940; a daughter, Gladys, and a son, Jack, took over the business until 1962 when it was sold to Isaac Sitzer Investments and later to George and Nick Markou purchased the hotel in 1978 and operated it until the property was sold to a condominium developer in 2015.

In 1962, the Moore Park subdivision started construction and would attract more residents to town. By that time, Georgetown had its own hospital.

The GO train arrived in Georgetown in 1974; the service has since expanded with a great deal of available parking at the Georgetown GO Station and frequent commuter trains on weekdays. On January 1, 1974 Georgetown was absorbed into the new regional town of Halton Hills. One of the most significant changes since then included the Georgetown South residential expansion that started in 1989. The two paper companies, Provincial Papers and Georgetown Coated Paper Company closed in 1991 and 1977 respectively.

====The Georgetown Boys====
On July 1, 1923, the first 50 orphans of the Armenian genocide arrived in Georgetown to be educated and trained for farming at the Cedarvale Farm, now known as Cedarvale Park, operated by the Armenian Canadian Relief Fund. The children were known as the Georgetown Boys. By 1928, most had homes on farms. Aris Alexanian was a teacher and assistant superintendent at the school. He went on to open an oriental rug store in Hamilton, Ontario, which has grown throughout Ontario and is now known as Alexanian Carpet and Flooring. In 1929 the farm became the Cedarvale School for Girls; most of the residents found positions as domestic staff. In total, 109 boys and 40 girls were taken in by the Canadian government, considered by many to be Canada&#x27;s first humanitarian initiative. Many became Canadian citizens.

====French presence====

The area had no early history of a concentration of French-Canadians, but that changed after World War II. First, in 1947, a boys&#x27; orphan farm relocated from St. Catharines, to Georgetown. This orphanage was operated by Father Clovis Beauregard and his niece, Therese St Jean. The Acadian boys from the orphanage decided to remain here in adulthood. The boys had learned apple farming and other Acadian families moved here to assist them with their apple business. Second, in 1957 a French-Canadian Association was formed. By 1966, about 150 French-speaking Catholic families created their own parish when the old Holy Cross Church was rededicated as L&#x27;Eglise Sacre Coeur.

====Halton Hills====
On January 1, 1974, Georgetown became part of the Town of Halton Hills when it amalgamated with the Town of Acton and most of the Township of Esquesing.

Together with the Town of Milton, the Town of Oakville and the City of Burlington, the Regional Municipality of Halton was formed, replacing Halton County. Halton Hills is well known for its terrain including slopes and inclines. In 1932, Bill Gauser proposed the idea to change the name from Halton to Halton Hills.

==Neighbourhoods==
Georgetown grew as new neighbourhoods were added. The oldest section is around Main Street and Church Street. The arrival of the railway produced a new section — around King Street and Queen Street. The Delrex subdivision was the third part of the town that was added. Shortly after Delrex, Moore Park was developed. In 1989, the Georgetown South development began and the town has grown considerably since that point.

*Delrex: In the 1950s, Rex Heslop, the builder of Rexdale in Toronto, built the Delrex subdivision. Delrex is a combination of Rex and his wife Delma&#x27;s names. In the 1950s and 1960s this area was referred to as Georgetown East.
*Moore Park: With the growth of Delrex subdivision, a second subdivision called Moore Park appeared in 1962.
*Trafalgar Country: Added in the mid-1990s and early 2000s, Trafalgar country is mostly bungalows and two-storey homes, and sits at the westernmost point in Georgetown.
*Georgetown South: In 1989 the farm land south of Silver Creek became the newest subdivision of Georgetown, Georgetown South. The development was undertaken by primarily Fernbrook Homes (West of Mountainview) and Canada Homes (East of Mountainview). Additional developments include Arbour Glen, Stewart&#x27;s Mills and the Four Corners. Not to be mistaken as the &quot;Four Corners&quot; of Hornby at Trafalgar Road and Steeles Avenue.

==Demographics==
The population at the time of the 2016 census was 42,123 (an increase of 4.8% over 2011) in the 24 km2 of the community. There were 14,679 private dwellings at that time. Data from previous years indicates steady growth.

Census data for periods prior to the amalgamation into the present Town are as follows:

==Government==
Georgetown ceased to be a separate town in 1974, and is now part of the Town of Halton Hills, which is divided into four wards, each with two elected Councillors. Two others are Regional Councillors, each representing two wards on Halton Hills Council, and also serve on the Halton Region Council as does the mayor.

The current membership of the town council is as follows:

Halton Hills has its own fire department but policing is provided by the Halton Regional Police Service. Halton Hills has its own official plan which came into force on 28 March 2008 and was consolidated in 2017 with the Region&#x27;s plan.

The Georgetown Agricultural Society organizes and runs the fair each year.

In 2003, the Fall Fair was the scene of a riot which broke out between local youth (approximately 500) and the Halton Regional Police force. There were several teens arrested and at least another half a dozen shot by rubber bullets during the riot. No major property damage occurred, only a portion of a small white picket fence was damaged. Conflict in the years following the event has so far been avoided.

==Recreation and parks==

===Hiking trails===
The Bruce Trail goes through Halton Hills, passing north of Georgetown.

The town is developing a multi-purpose trail system in Hungry Hollow, on old railbeds and various other locations. A citizens group called HHORBA is trying to work with the Town in planning and constructing the trails to be as environmentally friendly, safe for hikers and enjoyable for bicyclists as possible. HHORBA helped construct a one trail and three bridges with members of the Bruce Trail. HHORBA in the past has been a member of the International Mountain Bicycling Association.

===Georgetown Skate Park===

Located outside of the Mold-Masters SportsPlex at 221 Guelph Street, this facility was made possible by the co-operative efforts of the Halton Hills Community through the Skateboarders, Inline Skaters &amp; BMX Bikers of Halton Hills (SIBAHH) Committee and the Recreation and Parks Department. Funding was provided through generous community donations and the Corporation of the Town of Halton Hills. The facility is user supervised and is managed through posted regulations.

==History==
===Origin===
The Mikawa area has been inhabited since prehistoric times, as attested by finds of pottery shards from the Jōmon period and the megalithic Kofun tomb in Kira, the oldest in the Mikawa Province.

===Ancient history===
The fertile plains along the Yahagi River have been used for rice-farming as well as the production of tea and cotton since ancient times. Shell mounds dating to the late Japanese Paleolithic period which have been found in what is today the town center also point to fish and seafood as important early local produce.

In Hazu, a shrine from the Nara period is evidence of an early cultural connection to the Japanese capital at the time.
The soil around Nishio is rich in mica deposits, which was already mined in the Nara period.

===Early modern period===
During the 15th century Sengoku period, Nishio was the home territory for the Sakai clan, based at Nishio Castle.
The area eventually came under the control of the Tokugawa clan, and during the Edo period, most of the area was ruled as the Nishio Domain, a minor &quot;fudai&quot; feudal domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. The area prospered as a fishing port, and due to its location on the Tōkaidō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto, although the town itself suffered heavy damage due to a tsunami in the 1707 Hōei earthquake.

===Late modern period===
Early in the Meiji period, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system, Nishio was proclaimed a village in Hazu District in 1871.
Following the 1891 Mino–Owari earthquake, a tsunami killed over 60 people. Nishio was elevated to town status on May 1, 1906.
The town suffered damage in the 1944 Tōnankai earthquake, which killed 32 people, and the 1945 Mikawa earthquake, which killed 765.

===Contemporary history===
After the end of World War II, Nishio attracted many workers from the rural south of Japan and its population increased. In 1953, Nishio became a city with the annexation of neighboring Heisaka and Terazu towns and Fukuchi and Muroba villages; followed by Miwa and Meiji villages in 1955. In 1959, Typhoon Vera caused considerable damage to the area, with 20 people killed.

<text>The tres (Spanish for &quot;three&quot;) is a three-course chordophone of Cuban origin. The most widespread variety of the instrument is the original Cuban tres with six strings. Its sound has become a defining characteristic of the Cuban son and it is commonly played in a variety of Afro-Cuban genres. In the 1930s, the instrument was adapted into the Puerto Rican tres, which has nine strings and a body similar to that of the cuatro.

The tres developed in the second half of the 19th century in the eastern region of Guantánamo, where it was used to play changüí, a precursor of son cubano. Its exact origins are not known, but it is assumed to have developed from the 19th century Spanish guitar, which it resembles in shape, as well as the laúd and bandola, two instruments used in punto cubano since at least the 18th century. Tres playing revolves around the &quot;guajeo&quot;, an &quot;ostinato&quot; pattern found in many Afro-Cuban music styles. Tres players are commonly known as &quot;treseros&quot; (in Cuba) or &quot;tresistas&quot; (in Puerto Rico).

==Cuba==
===History===

By most accounts, the tres was first used in several related Afro-Cuban musical genres originating in eastern Cuba: the nengón, kiribá, changüí and son, all of which developed during the 19th century. Benjamin Lapidus states: &quot;The tres holds a position of great importance not only in changüí, but in the musical culture of Cuba as a whole.&quot; One theory holds that initially, a guitar, tiple or bandola, was used in the son. They were eventually replaced by a new native-born instrument, a fusion of all three, called the tres. Helio Orovio writes that, in 1892, Nené Manfugás brought the tres from Baracoa, its place of origin, to Santiago de Cuba. According to Sindo Garay, the tres itself originated in Baracoa. In 1927, Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes mentioned Nené Manfugás as the first tres player from Santiago de Cuba. However, he described the tres as having originated in &quot;time immemorial&quot; among Afro-Cubans, while bearing a strong resemblance to the Spanish guitar and the bandurria. According to writer Alejo Carpentier, the tres descended from the bandola (itself a derivative of the Spanish bandurria), which lost two courses over time. According to journalist Lino Dou, the tres was virtually unknown in western Cuba until 1895, when it was bought from Oriente by the &quot;mambises&quot;. Similarly, Fernando Ortiz stated that the wars between Spain and Cuba (Ten Years&#x27; War and Cuban War of Independence) gave rise to the differentiation between the Spanish guitar and the Cuban tres, the latter becoming a symbol of the creole nation. Ortiz asserted that the tres most likely originated during pre-colonial Cuba, before gaining widespread popularity in the late 19th century. The origins of the tres and other Cuban instruments are discussed in depth by Ortiz in his seminal work &quot;Los instrumentos de la música afrocubana&quot;, published between 1952 and 1955.

As the son cubano grew in popularity in the 1920s, so did the tres. By the 1930s, there were several rising stars of the tres, including Eliseo Silveira, Carlos Godínez, Arsenio Rodríguez and Niño Rivera. In the 1950s, Arsenio left Cuba and his sound was continued by Ramón Cisneros &quot;Liviano&quot; and Arturo Harvey &quot;Alambre Dulce&quot; in the Conjunto Chappottín. Other important &quot;treseros&quot; of the 1950s such as Senén Suárez and Juanito Márquez began making recordings with electric treses. In the United States, the tres was sometimes featured in salsa ensembles, especially in the 1970s, when players such as Nelson González, Charlie Rodríguez and Harry Viggiano made numerous recordings for Fania Records. Traditional tres playing has been promoted in Cuba since the first recordings by Grupo Changüí de Guantánamo in the 1980s, featuring Chito Latamblé, as well as the albums by Isaac Oviedo and his son Papi Oviedo. In 2010, &quot;tresero&quot; Pancho Amat won the highest accolade awarded to musicians in Cuba, the &quot;Premio Nacional de Música&quot;.

===Description and variants===
The Cuban tres is significantly smaller than the Spanish guitar, with a scale length between and . It has three courses (groups) of two strings each for a total of six strings. From the low pitch to the highest, the principal tuning is in one of two variants in C Major, either: G4 G3, C4 C4, E4 E4 (top course in unisons), or more traditionally: G4 G3, C4 C4, E3 E4 (top course in octaves). Note that when the octave tuning is used, the order of the octaves in the first course is the reverse of the order in the third course (&quot;low-high&quot; versus &quot;high-low&quot;). Today many &quot;treseros&quot; tune the whole instrument a step higher (in D major): A4 A3, D4 D4, F#4 F#4 or A4 A3, D4 D4, F#3 F#4.

A musician who plays the Cuban tres is called a &quot;tresero&quot;, although the term &quot;tresista&quot; has also been used in Cuba in the past. There are variants of the instrument in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Cuban trova singer, songwriter and guitarist Compay Segundo invented a variant of the tres and the Spanish guitar known as armónico. Eliades Ochoa plays another variant he calls the &quot;guitarra tres&quot;, which is a Spanish guitar with two extra strings tuned like a tres.

===Guajeos===
The typical tres ostinato is the guajeo. It emerged in Cuba in the 19th century in the musical genres nengón, kiribá, changüí, and son. The tres playing technique of changüí, and to a lesser extent nengón, has influenced contemporary son musicians, most notably pianist Lilí Martínez and &quot;tresero&quot; Pancho Amat, both of whom learned the style from Chito Latamblé. Both nengón and kiribá are included in the repertoire of changüí ensembles. For example, the debut album of Grupo Changüí de Guantánamo opens with &quot;Nengón&quot;.

====Nengón====
Benjamin Lapidus presents evidence of the &quot;linear view of the son&#x27;s development from nengón to kiribá and other regional styles, to changüí, and ultimately to son.&quot; The nengón has a limited harmonic range, where the tonic and dominant are accentuated, and the tres is usually placed in the traditional octave tuning (G4 G3, C4 C4, E3 E4). As a genre, nengón consists of variations of a single song, &quot;Para ti nengón&quot;. The following nengón guajeo is an embellishment of the rhythmic figure known as tresillo.

====Kiribá====
Closely related to nengón, the kiribá style emerged in the Baracoa region of eastern Cuba. Like nengón, kiribá is genre that is based on the song or refrain &quot;Kiribá, kiribá&quot;. Because of this, Cuban musicologists such as Olavo Alén Rodríguez prefer to categorise kiribá as a style within changüí. Nonetheless, kiribá has a distinct &quot;guajeo&quot; and might predate changüí.

====Changüí====
When playing changüí, the tres is again usually given the traditional octave tuning. The following changüí tres guajeo consists of all offbeats.

====Son====
According to Kevin Moore &quot;there are two types of pure son tres guajeos: generic and song-specific. Song-specific guajeos are usually based on the song&#x27;s melody, while the generic type involves simply arpeggiating triads.&quot; The rhythmic pattern of the following &quot;generic&quot; guajeo is used in many songs. Note that the first measure consists of all offbeats. The figure can begin in the first measure, or the second measure, depending upon the structure of the song.

===Solos===
Tres solos were first constructed by grouping guajeo variations together, a melodic/rhythmic approach relying on subtle variation and repetition, that maintains a &quot;groove&quot; for dancers. According to Lapidus, tres solos in changüí typically sound &quot;melodic/rhythmic ideas twice before moving on. This technique allows the soloist to set up a series of expectations for the listener, which are alternately satisfied, circumvented, frustrated, or inverted. The practice has its analogue in what Paul Berliner labels &#x27;a community of ideas,&#x27; as motives from these sequences are frequently returned to throughout the course of any given solo.&quot;

By the mid twentieth century, tres solos began incorporating the rhythmic &quot;vocabulary&quot; of quinto, the lead drum of rumba. The counter-metric emphasis of quinto-based phrases break free from the confines of the guajeo, which is normally &quot;locked&quot; to the clave cycle. Thus, quinto-based solos are capable of creating long cycles of tension—release spanning many measures.

== Puerto Rico ==

The Puerto Rican tres is an adaptation of Cuban tres with nine strings instead of six. Although nine-string treses are documented in Cuba since at least 1913, investigators agree that the creation of the instrument was probably caused by the 1929 visit of Isaac Oviedo to Puerto Rico during a tour by the Septeto Matancero. Inspired by Oviedo, guitarist Guillero &quot;Piliche&quot; Ayala ordered the construction of a similar instrument for which the body of a cuatro was used. As a result, the Puerto Rican tres is shaped like a Puerto Rican cuatro, with cut-outs, unlike the Cuban variety, which has a guitar-like shape. By 1934, the Puerto Rican cuatro had reached New York and nowadays most Puerto Rican tres players specialize in their national adaptation of the instrument, a notable exception being Nelson González. The Puerto Rican tres has nine strings in three courses and is tuned G4 G3 G4, C4 C4 C4, E4 E3 E4. Players of the Puerto Rican tres are called &quot;tresistas&quot;.

==History==
===Ancient history===
Tokoname has been associated with ceramics production since at least the Heian period, and &quot;Tokoname-yaki&quot; works from this period have been found in locations as far away as Aomori Prefecture in the north of Japan and Kagoshima prefecture in the south.
===Feudal period===
By the Kamakura period, over 3000 kilns were active. During the Sengoku period, the area came under the control of the Isshiki clan, and later came under the rule of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

===Early modern period===
During the Edo period, the area around present-day Tokoname was part of Owari Domain.
===Late modern period===
In the post Meiji Restoration cadastral reforms of 1889, the town of Tokoname was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system.
===Contemporary history===
Tokoname was elevated to city status on April 1, 1954, by the merger of Tokoname town with the towns of Onizaki (鬼崎), Nishiura (西浦) and Ōno (大野), and the village of Miwa (三和村).

==Government==

Tokoname has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 18 members. The city contributes one member to the Aichi Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Aichi District 8 of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

Chubu Centrair International Airport, built on an artificial island off the coast of Tokoname, opened on February 17, 2005, providing a major boost to local development.

Tokoname is a regional commercial center, and has been known since the Heian period for its production of ceramics, notably &quot;Tokoname-yaki&quot;, and ceramics production remains the mainstay of the local economy. 
One of the main producing companies is INAX.

About 60 climbing kilns formerly operated, most of which were constructed starting in the Meiji era. The chimneys became a landmark of the town, but many were closed and taken down after the Second World War as production methods modernised and burning of ovens was regulated by the authorities to protect the air quality. The Tōei Kiln (陶栄窯) is a climbing kiln (&quot;nobori-gama&quot;) that was constructed in 1887 and used until 1974. It is the largest climbing kiln existing in Japan. It was designated as an Important Tangible Cultural Property by the government in 1982. It has eight firing chambers running a 17° incline and ten chimneys of varying height.

With its long coastline, commercial fishing also plays an important role in the local economy.

<text>Incisors (from Latin &quot;incidere&quot;, &quot;to cut&quot;) are the front teeth present in most mammals. They are located in the premaxilla above and on the mandible below. Humans have a total of eight (two on each side, top and bottom). Opossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.

==Structure==
Adult humans normally have eight incisors, two of each type. The types of incisors are:
* maxillary central incisor (upper jaw, closest to the center of the lips)
* maxillary lateral incisor (upper jaw, beside the maxillary central incisor)
* mandibular central incisor (lower jaw, closest to the center of the lips)
* mandibular lateral incisor (lower jaw, beside the mandibular central incisor)

Children with a full set of deciduous teeth (primary teeth) also have eight incisors, named the same way as in permanent teeth. Young children may have from zero to eight incisors depending on the stage of their tooth eruption and tooth development. Typically, the mandibular central incisors erupt first, followed by the maxillary central incisors, the mandibular lateral incisors and finally the maxillary laterals. The rest of the primary dentition erupts after the incisors.

Apart from the first molars, the incisors are also the first permanent teeth to erupt, following the same order as the primary teeth, among themselves.

===Other animals===
Among other animals, the number varies from species to species. Opossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none. Cats, dogs, foxes, pigs, and horses have twelve. Rodents have four. Rabbits and hares (lagomorphs) were once considered rodents, but are distinguished by having six—one small pair, called &quot;peg teeth&quot;, is located directly behind the most anterior pair. Incisors are used to bite off tough foods, such as red meat.

Cattle (cows, bulls, etc.) have none on top but a total of six on the bottom.

==Function==
In cats, the incisors are small; biting off meat is done with the canines and the carnassials. In elephants, the upper incisors are modified into curved tusks (unlike with narwhals, where it is a canine that develops into a straight and twisted tusk). The incisors of rodents grow throughout life and are worn by gnawing. In humans, the incisors serve to cut off pieces of food, as well as in the grip of other food items.

<text>David Michael Stratton (April 10, 1941 – March 25, 2020) was an American professional football player who was a linebacker for 12 seasons in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). He won two AFL championships with the Buffalo Bills, where he was a six-time AFL All-Star. He was named to the AFL All-Time Second Team.

Stratton played college football for the Tennessee Volunteers. He played professionally for 11 years with the Bills and spent his final season with the San Diego Chargers. He won two AFL championships with the Bills in 1964 and 1965, with his tackle of Keith Lincoln in the former game being referred to as “The Hit Heard ‘Round the World”. His contributions as a team leader of a defense that allowed just seven points each in consecutive championship games as resulted in him being called one of the best defensive players in Bills history.

==Early life==
Stratton attended Tellico Plains High in Tellico Plains, Tennessee, a hamlet in the Great Smoky Mountains region. Football players there did not attract college recruiters, and Tellico Plains athletes rarely went to college. Stratton played tackle, fullback and wingback.

Stratton received a scholarship from Volunteers coach Bowden Wyatt to play at the University of Tennessee. He was a two-way player with Tennessee, playing tight end on offense and defensive end on defense.

==Professional career ==
Drafted out of college by the Buffalo Bills in the 13th round of the 1962 AFL draft, Stratton was selected as an AFL All-Star six straight seasons from 1963 through 1968. Bills coach Lou Saban teamed him with Harry Jacobs and John Tracey to form one of the best linebacking crews, playing together for 62 consecutive games from 1963 through 1967, a pro football record. They helped the Bills defense hold opposing teams without a 100-yard rusher for seventeen consecutive games in 1964 and 1965, capturing AFL championships in both years.

In the 1964 AFL Championship Game against the San Diego Chargers, Stratton made the memorable &quot;hit heard &#x27;round the world&quot;. San Diego&#x27;s Keith Lincoln had a 38-yard run on the game&#x27;s opening play. The Chargers were leading 7–0 when Stratton drove his shoulder into Lincoln&#x27;s midsection, breaking the star running back&#x27;s ribs and knocking him out of the game. The Bills shut out San Diego for the rest of the game, and won 20–7. In the closing minutes of the first half with Buffalo leading 13–7, the Chargers drove to the Bills&#x27; 15, but Stratton intercepted a Tobin Rote pass to end the threat. Rote and San Diego coach Sid Gillman called the turnover a decisive play. The combined efforts of players such as defensive tackle Tom Sestak, cornerback Butch Byrd, and others led to two Bills championships, where they allowed seven points in each contest.

Stratton played 11 seasons for the Bills before ending his career with the Chargers in 1973. He finished his career with 21 interceptions—18 with the Bills and 3 with the Chargers. He was selected to the AFL All-Time Second Team.

== Later years ==
After football, Stratton became an executive with insurance company Crump Associates in Knoxville, Tennessee. He and his wife raised three daughters and one son. The son died in 2023.

On March 25, 2020, Stratton died at age 78 from heart complications after a recent fall.

<text>Valgerd Svarstad Haugland (born 23 August 1956) is a Norwegian teacher, politician and civil servant.

She was leader of the Christian Democratic Party in Norway from 1995 to 2004. She was Minister of Children and Family Affairs from 1997 to 2000 and Minister of Culture from 2001 to 2005. Since 2019, she has been County Governor of Østfold, Buskerud, Oslo and Akershus. Prior to that, she served as county Governor of Oslo and Akershus from 2011 to 2018. In May 2024, she announced that she wouldn&#x27;t seek to be re-appointed county governor and would be leaving office by the end of the year. She announced her resignation in December, just shy of the end of her term, following revelations of the lack of treatment of discrepancies in the counties&#x27; health sector. 

In her capacity as Minister of Culture and Church Affairs, she gave volunteer work particular emphasis.

She withdrew as party leader at an extraordinary annual assembly of the party on 23 January 2004. She was primarily held responsible for the poor results during the last local election, held in September 2003. In the 2005 parliamentary elections she failed to win a seat in parliament.

Until 2010 she was a board member of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation.

<text>Paul Leo Maguire (born August 22, 1938) is an American former professional football player and television sportscaster. He played as a punter and linebacker in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL).

==Early sports career==
Maguire attended Ursuline High School in Youngstown, Ohio where he was an All State wide receiver and punter; he also played basketball and ran track. He played tight end at The Citadel where he led the nation in touchdown receptions his senior season in 1959 and was named a 3rd Team Associated Press All American; he was recruited by Assistant Coach Al Davis, the future Oakland Raiders owner.

==Professional football career==
In 1960, Maguire was selected by the Los Angeles Chargers of the American Football League, where he served as both a punter and linebacker. He moved with the team to San Diego in 1961, and stayed there until 1964 when he joined the Buffalo Bills. Maguire was an ace at the &quot;coffin corner&quot; punt. He contributed to three Bills&#x27; Eastern Division titles, and their AFL championships in 1964 and 1965.In the 1964 AFL Championship game he kicked a 78-yard punt that went out of bounds at the San Diego 2 yard line with 2 minutes left in the game that sealed the victory for the Bills. In the 1965 championship game he was involved in one of the most spectacular plays in Bills&#x27; history in the 1965 American Football League Championship game against the Chargers. Butch Byrd took a John Hadl punt and with outstanding blocking, took it 74 yards for a touchdown. The last two blocks were by Maguire, crushing two Chargers.

Maguire played in six of the ten American Football League Championship Games — three with the Chargers and three with the Bills, winning three AFL Championship rings, and he was the league&#x27;s all-time punter in punts and yardage. He was one of only twenty players who were in the AFL for its entire ten-year existence. After his retirement he was inducted into the Youngstown, Ohio Sports Hall of Fame, and the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame.

==Media career==
Beginning in the 1970s, Maguire worked as a color commentator on network NFL telecasts, first with NBC and then ESPN. He also called ESPN&#x27;s telecasts of college football, the Canadian Football League and the now-defunct USFL. Maguire re-joined NBC in 1986 as an analyst on their pregame show, then becoming a color commentator in 1988. Maguire most often worked with Marv Albert on NBC&#x27;s #2 broadcast team for his first seven seasons working for NBC. In 1995, Maguire and then-ESPN reporter Phil Simms joined Dick Enberg as the #1 broadcast team for NBC, and remained paired until the end of the 1997 season, when NBC lost the rights to the NFL.

Maguire rejoined ESPN for the 1998 season and became a second color commentator for &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;. While there he also served as a color commentator for ABC&#x27;s Wild Card Saturday games, as the &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; team would (usually) broadcast the early game of the day. During the time he was at ESPN, Maguire called playoff games for ABC every year except for 2002, when the network elected to use Brent Musburger and Gary Danielson, its lead college football broadcast team, on Wild Card Saturday.

In 1991, Maguire participated in the WrestleMania VII event.

Maguire, who had a residence in Buffalo after his playing days, hosted a locally produced call-in show called the &quot;Budweiser Sportsline&quot;. Later the program was broadcast on the Empire Sports Network.

Maguire worked his last regular season NFL game on January 1, 2006, as the St. Louis Rams and Dallas Cowboys played on ESPN&#x27;s final Sunday night broadcast. His final NFL game altogether came on January 7, 2006, as he worked the Washington Redskins-Tampa Bay Buccaneers opening round playoff game. However, Maguire was retained by ESPN to serve as a commentator for ABC&#x27;s college football with Brad Nessler, former Miami Dolphins quarterback Bob Griese, and field reporter Bonnie Bernstein.

In March 2007, Maguire began to serve as an in-studio analyst for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;NFL Live&quot;.

Maguire did not return to broadcasting for the 2009 college football season as his broadcast team was split up, with Nessler moving to Saturday night games on ESPN with Todd Blackledge and Griese moving to noon games on ESPN alongside Dave Pasch and Chris Spielman. He later (2009–2010) broadcast games for the then-new United Football League on HDNet, a cable network and streaming service.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Yokkaichi has increased steadily over the past 60 years.

==History==

The area around modern Yokkaichi has been settled since prehistoric times. Numerous Kofun period burial mounds have been discovered, and the area was one of the battle sites of the Asuka period Jinshin War. However, until the end of the Heian period, the area was sparsely settled, and the site of Yokkaichi was only a small port village. The area developed during the Kamakura period and by the Azuchi–Momoyama period, the port was developed and a regular market was opened on the 4th, 14th, and 24th day each month. Thus, the city is named Yokkaichi: &quot;yokka&quot; means fourth day, and &quot;ichi&quot; means market. After the Honnō-ji Incident during which warlord Oda Nobunaga was assassinated, Tokugawa Ieyasu fled from Yokkaichi port by sea to his castle at Edo. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, Yokkaichi was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory controlled directly by the &quot;shōgun&quot; and administered by a &quot;daikan&quot; based at the Yokkaichi Jin&#x27;ya. Throughout the Edo period, the area prospered as Yokkaichi-juku, the forty-third station on the Tōkaidō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. However, the city was largely destroyed by the Ansei great earthquakes.

Following the Meiji Restoration, Yokkaichi Town was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, and was designated the capital of Mie Prefecture. Yokkaichi&#x27;s port advanced remarkably during the Meiji period, primarily under the guidance of Inaba Sanuemon, a resident merchant interested in increasing trade in the Yokkaichi and Ise area by modernizing the port facilities. Starting in 1872, the project took 12 years to complete due to typhoons and difficulties in financing the project. This led to the port city being designated an Official International Port in 1899 The primary trade items shipped through Yokkaichi were originally seed oil, Banko ware, and Ise tea; but now it has developed into a port that handles cotton, wool, glass, and heavy equipment. Yokkaichi was elevated to city status on August 1, 1897.

From 1939, Yokkaichi became a center for the chemical industry, with the Imperial Japanese Navy constructing a large refinery near the port area. Yokkaichi was one of the first cities bombed by the United States during World War II, when on April 18, 1942, the city was attacked by aircraft from the Doolittle Raid. During the final stages of World War II, on June 18, 1945, 89 B-29 Superfortress bombers dropped 11,000 incendiary bombs destroying 35% of the urban area and killing 736 people. This attack on Yokkaichi was followed by another eight air raids until August 8, 1945, killing another 808 people.

From 1960 to 1972, the city residents suffered health problems caused by the emission of SOx into the atmosphere from local petrochemical and chemical plants. In Japan, a disease called &quot;Yokkaichi zensoku&quot; (Yokkaichi asthma) derives its name from the city, and it is considered one of the Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan.
Yokkaichi attained special city status on November 1, 2000, with increased local autonomy.

On February 7, 2005, the town of Kusu (from Mie District) was merged into Yokkaichi.

<text>, formerly called Ujiyamada (宇治山田), is a city in central Mie Prefecture, on the island of Honshū, Japan. Ise is home to Ise Grand Shrine, the most sacred Shintō shrine in Japan. The city has a long-standing title – Shinto (神都) – that roughly means &quot;the Holy City&quot;, and literally means &quot;the Capital of the &quot;Kami&quot;&quot;. , the city had an estimated population of 123,533 in 55,911 households and a population density of 590 people per km². The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Ise is located on the northern half of Shima Peninsula in far eastern Mie Prefecture. The northern part of the city is flat land and faces Ise Bay on the Pacific Ocean. In the south, the land rises to form hills and mountains with an elevation of 100 to 500 meters. Most of the city is within the geographic limits of Ise-Shima National Park.

===Climate===
Ise has a Humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Ise is . The average annual rainfall is , with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

===Demographics===
The population of Ise has remained relatively steady over the past 50 years.

==History==
Ise&#x27;s history is directly linked to that of Ise Grand Shrine. Ise Grand Shrine is separated into two main parts: The Inner Shrine and the Outer Shrine. Despite the names, these are actually two physically separate shrines approximately six kilometers apart. Ise began with small settlements that had sprung up around the two shrines. During the Edo period, Ise was a major destination for pilgrimages which were called &quot;o-Ise-mairi&quot; (literally, &quot;Coming to Ise&quot;) and thus, these settlements grew larger and developed into small villages. The village around the Inner Shrine was named Uji, and the village around the Outer Shrine was named Yamada. Because of the religious importance of Ise Grand Shrine, the Tokugawa shogunate during the Edo period viewed the area as politically significant and installed a magistrate in Yamada.

During the Meiji period, these two villages were merged with the establishment of the modern municipal system to form the town of Ujiyamada. The town was upgraded to city status on September 1, 1906. In 1909, the forerunner to the JNR connected Ujiyamada by train, followed by the forerunner of Kintetsu Railway in 1930. These lines were responsible for a large increase in pilgrims and tourists visiting Ise Grand Shrine, peaking with an estimated eight million visitors in the year 1940, per government-sponsored ceremonies celebrating the 2600th anniversary of the foundation of the Japanese empire. The significance of the Ise Grand Shrine to State Shinto made Ujiyamada a target for six air raids during World War II, the largest of which was on July 28, 1945 when 93 Twentieth Air Force Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers dropped incendiaries, burning 39% of the city.

On January 1, 1955 Ujiyamada absorbed the villages of Toyohama, Kitahama, Shigō and Kida and was renamed Ise City. The reason for this change is to avoid naming confusion with the later-formed cities of Uji in Kyōto Prefecture and the city of Yamada (now the city of Kama) in Fukuoka Prefecture. The name &quot;Ise&quot; was chosen because it was already recognized throughout Japan due to Ise Grand Shrine. However, the renaming phase took some time around the city. For example, it took four years to rename the main JR station in town, Yamada Station, to Iseshi Station. Some things were never renamed, such as Ujiyamada Station, Ise&#x27;s largest train station, and Ujiyamada High School, Ise&#x27;s first high school.

On September 26, 1959: The Ise-wan Typhoon, Japan&#x27;s strongest-recorded typhoon, hit Ise and surrounding areas.

On November 1, 2005: Ise absorbed the towns of Futami and Obata and the village of Misono (all from Watarai District).

==Government==
Ise has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 28 members. Ise contributes four members to the Mie Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Mie 4th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Local attractions ==

*Ise Grand Shrine: It is sometimes called &quot;The Shrine of the shrines&quot; to indicate its status as the most sacred Shintō shrine. Legend has it that Yata no Kagami (The Sacred Mirror), one of the Three Sacred Treasures of Japan, is housed somewhere within the grounds. The entire Shrine is completely rebuilt from scratch every 20 years using fresh lumber that is brought to Ise and then ceremonially carried through the streets on its way to the Shrine during an &quot;okihiki&quot; (お木曳). The Shrine is in its 62nd reconstruction, meaning this tradition has been carried out for at least 1,240 years. The next reconstruction will be in 2033.
** Outer Shrine (外宮 &quot;gekū&quot;): Sometimes called &quot;toyouke-daijingū&quot; (豊受大神宮), it is dedicated to Toyouke-Ōmikami, the goddess of food, clothing, and shelter (life&#x27;s basic needs). Pilgrims are supposed to visit the Outer Shrine before visiting the Inner Shrine. The Outer Shrine is very close to Ise-shi Station. 
** Inner Shrine (内宮 &quot;naikū&quot;): Sometimes called &quot;kō-taijingū&quot; (皇大神宮), it is dedicated to Amaterasu-Ōmikami, the sun goddess who is sometimes called the &quot;supreme kami.&quot; This shrine sees many visitors from around Japan on a daily basis; there is a sharp increase during the New Year&#x27;s season. People traditionally visit a shrine on New Year&#x27;s Day, but since it will be the first visit of a new year, special consideration is given to the choice of shrine. Some people travel to shrines that may be more significant than those in their own area, and this inevitably leads people to Ise Grand Shrine, particularly the Inner Shrine. The inner sanctum of the main shrine area within the Inner Shrine is off-limits to visitors, thus only the rooftop of the structure that houses the kami can be seen. 
** Cultural facilities: These institutions provide a deeper understanding of Ise Grand Shrine. They are all housed at the top Mt. Kurata which is part of the pilgrimage route between the Outer Shrine and the Inner Shrine.
*** or Jingu Chokokan Museum (神宮徴古館 &quot;jingū-chōkokan&quot;) chronicles the creation and development of the Shrine.
*** Fine Art Museum (神宮美術館 &quot;jingū-bijutsukan&quot;) displays works by artists and painters donated during the reconstruction ceremony that is held once every 20 years.
*** Agricultural Museum (神宮農業館 &quot;jingū-nōgyōkan&quot;): Since the Outer Shrine is dedicated to Toyouke-Ōmikami, the goddess of life&#x27;s basic needs, this museum covers how agriculture fulfills these needs.
*** Library (神宮文庫 &quot;jingū-bunko&quot;) contains various volumes dealing with Shintō and Ise Grand Shrine. Open to the public but generally only used by researchers and Shintō priests.
** Oharai Machi (おはらい町): A small side street that runs between Prefectural Route 32 and the entrance to the Inner Shrine with buildings that are made to evoke the Edo period. The part of the road near the Inner Shrine offers all sort of omiyage souvenirs. This road is home to the main akafuku (adzuki bean sweet) shop.
** Okage Yoko-chō (おかげ横丁): This area branches off of Oharai Machi about halfway between Prefectural Route 32 and the entrance to the Inner Shrine. It has a large concentration of eateries. Taiko performances can be heard here sometimes, usually on the weekends.
* : Located at Futami Okitama Shrine (二見興玉神社) in northeastern Ise. The rocks have been enshrined and are thus considered gods. 
* Ise-Shima National Park
** Ise-Shima Skyline: A 16.3-km-long scenic mountain road between Ise and Toba. 
** Mt. Asama (朝熊山): At 555m, this is the highest mountain in Ise; its two TV towers make it very distinctive. A lookout point is accessible from the Ise-Shima Skyline road. Nearby is a spa. The summit can also be reached on foot, beginning just north of Asama Station.
** Kongōshō Temple (金剛證寺): A Buddhist temple near the top of Mt. Asama. It is accessible from the Ise-Shima Skyline road.
* Miya River
** Riverside Park (宮川堤公園 &quot;miya-gawa tsutsumi kōen&quot;): A cherry blossom viewing area, making it a popular destination during the prime blooming season early in April. Fireworks are hosted in mid-July. The park is on the east side of the river near the Watarai Bridge.
** Love River (ラブリバー) houses public leisure and sports facilities for baseball, soccer, basketball, and tennis. The park is on the east side of the river near Route 23.
* Edo Wonderland Ise (安土桃山文化村 &quot;azuchi momoyama bunka mura&quot;): A theme park in Futami with an Edo-period theme, featuring samurai, a ninja maze, and a ghost house.
* Kawasaki: A section of historical buildings of the old merchant quarters in Ise that is located along the Seta River north of the Ujiyamada Station.
* Shintomiza (進富座): An independent movie theater showing a variety of art-house Japanese and foreign films. A short walk south of Miyamachi Station.

==Festivals==
* Ise Festival: Ise&#x27;s largest festival, held for two days in mid-October to celebrate all things Ise.
* Okihiki (お木曳): Festival in which the timber that will be used to reconstruct Ise Grand Shrine is ceremonially carried through the streets. Each neighborhood (or district) of Ise city is responsible for carrying its share of the load, and the ceremony is spread out over many weekends to allow all neighborhoods to participate. This festival is only held for the three consecutive years starting eight years before a Shrine reconstruction. For example, the Okihiki festivals for the next Shrine reconstruction in 2013 were held in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Okihiki for the Outer Shrine is held in May and starts on the Miya River. Okihiki for the Inner Shrine is held in late July and starts near the Isuzu River.
* Cherry Blossom Festival is held early April on the Miya River (near the Watarai Bridge).
* Miya River Fireworks is held in mid-July.
* Tennō Festival is held usually on the Sunday evening of the three-day weekend in July near Kawasaki and is well known for goldfish fireworks at night.

During the late Heian period and Muromachi period, the area of modern Kuwana was known as and was a major seaport on the east coast of Japan, controlled by a guild of merchants. The poet Socho described it in 1515 as a major city with over a thousand houses, temples and inns. During the Sengoku period, the area came under the control of the warlord Oda Nobunaga. The Sieges of Nagashima took place in 1571, 1573 and 1574, finally resulting in the destruction of the Ikkō-ikki by Nobunaga&#x27;s forces. After Nobunaga&#x27;s death, the area came under the control of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who initially installed Nobunaga&#x27;s younger son Oda Nobukatsu as ruler as all of Ise Province. However, following the Battle of Odawara, Hideyoshi demoted Oda Nobukatsu, divided Ise Province into several domains, was assigned to Ujiie Yukihiro as a 22,000 &quot;koku&quot; domain in 1595. Ujiie Yukihiro sided with the pro-Toyotomi armies in the Battle of Sekigahara and was dispossessed by Tokugawa Ieyasu. 

Under the Tokugawa shogunate, Kuwana was the castle town of Kuwana Domain, with a &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 150,000 &quot;koku&quot;. It was also the location of Kuwana-juku, as the forty-second post station on the vital Tōkaidō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. Some travelers along the road would take ships and boats across Ise Bay from Miya-juku (located in present-day Nagoya near Atsuta Shrine) to Kuwana, which reportedly made the journey more enjoyable. As the trip across Ise Bay took a whole day, Kuwana became a necessary stop for most travelers, benefiting the city&#x27;s numerous inns and restaurants which served fresh sea food. Kuwana was especially known for its clams. The shogunate recognized the strategic value of the location as both a seaport, and the domain was always ruled by a &quot;fudai daimyō&quot;, and from 1823 by the &quot;shinpan daimyō&quot; Hisamatsu clan. Matsudaira Sadaaki, the next-to-last &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kuwana served as the last &quot;Kyoto shoshidai&quot; and supported his brother, Matsudaira Katamori, daimyō of Aizu Domain. He fought in the Boshin War, finally surrendering to the Meiji government after the fall of the Republic of Ezo. With the abolition of the han system in July 1871 after the Meiji restoration, Kuwana Domain became “Kuwana Prefecture”, and later became Kuwana District within Mie Prefecture.

The area re-established itself as a regional commercial center and was noted for its metal casting industry. Kuwana Town was established in April 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to city status on April 1, 1937, as a result of a merger between existing towns and villages in the area. The city was devastated by Allied air raids on July 17 and July 24, 1945, during World War II, which destroyed some 90% of its urban area. Portions of the city were again heavily damaged in 1959 by the Isewan Typhoon.

On December 6, 2004, the towns of Nagashima and Tado (both from Kuwana District) were merged into Kuwana.

==Government==
Kuwana has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 26 members. Kuwana contributes four members to the Mie Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Mie 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Traditionally, Kuwana has been noted for its metal casting industry, which remains an important factor in the local economy, especially with the production on manhole covers and gratings. Another traditional industry that Kuwana was famous for was the production of Banko ware ceramics, and for its woodworking industries, including the production of wooden trays and furniture. Commercial fishing, especially the farming of &quot;hamaguri&quot; clams is also an important industry. Today, the city functions as a bed town for nearby Nagoya and Yokkaichi. A large housing estate called Ōyamada (大山田) is located west of central Kuwana.

==Education==
Kuwana has 27 public elementary schools and nine public middle schools operated by the city government and four public high schools operated by the Mie Prefectural Department of Education. There are also one private elementary school, middle school and high school. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.

<text>was a city located in Mie Prefecture, Japan. The city was founded on September 10, 1941. It was often referred to as [[Iga Province|Iga]]-Ueno to avoid confusion with other Uenos, including one in Ise Province which is now part of Yokkaichi.

As of 2003, the city had population estimated about 61,753 and the density was 316.26 persons per km2. The total area was 195.26 km2.

On November 1, 2004, Ueno, along with the towns of Iga (former) and Ayama, the villages of Ōyamada and Shimagahara (all from Ayama District), and the town of Aoyama (from Naga District), were merged to create the city of Iga.

Ueno is the location of Iga Ueno Castle and the Iga-ryū Ninja Museum. In the mid-15th to late 16th century, the site where the castle now stands was the main headquarters of the Iga &quot;ikki&quot;.

<text>is a city in Mie Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 197,977 in 87,680 households and a population density of 1000 persons per km². The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Suzuka is in northeastern Mie Prefecture, in northern Kii Peninsula, bordered by Ise Bay to the east. Parts of the city are within the borders of the Ise-no-Umi Prefectural Natural Park and the Suzuka Quasi-National Park.

==Climate==
Suzuka has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Suzuka is 15.6 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1737 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 27.0 °C, and lowest in January, at around 4.7 °C.

==Demographics==
The population of Suzuka has more than doubled over the 50-year period 1960-2010. 
==History==
Suzuka, as a place name, is mentioned in the Nara period chronicle &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;. The ancient Tōkaidō passed through Suzuka, and the Nara-period provincial capital was within its borders. During the Sengoku period, the area was controlled by Oda Nobutaka, the third son of Oda Nobunaga, who ruled from Kanbe Castle. During the Edo period, much of the area was under the control of the 15,000 &quot;koku&quot; Kanbe Domain, ruled by the Honda clan from 1732 until the Meiji restoration in 1871. During this period, two post stations were within the modern city limits: Ishiyakushi-juku and Shōno-juku, which prospered due to pilgrimage traffic to the Ise Grand Shrine.

After the start of the Meiji period, the area was organized as part of Suzuka District in 1889 and the town of Kanbe was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On December 1, 1942, Kanbe merged with the villages of Shirako, Inau, Iino, Kawano, Ichinomiya, Mida, Tanagaki, Wakamatsu, Ko, Shono, Takatsuse, Makita, and Ishiyakushi to form the city of Suzuka. The city further expanded in 1954 by annexing the villages of Sakae, Amana and Aikawa and portions of neighboring Kameyama.

==Government==
Suzuka has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 32 members. Suzuka contributes four members to the Mie Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Mie 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Suzuka boasts a significant industrial market, having major factories for Sharp and Honda in its bounds. These companies outsource part of their labor to South American nationals to secure a contract-based workforce.

Although the Japanese government encourages mandatory English-language education across the nation, in Suzuka many courses are offered by private cram schools (&quot;juku&quot;) and by publicly funded institutions supporting Portuguese and Spanish. In a controversial move, the city&#x27;s governing body, from April 2004, requires all garbage information and local signage to be in Japanese and Portuguese (but not English).

<text>is a city located in Mie Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 16,910, in 9,177 households. The population density was 88 persons per km2. The total area of the city was .

==Geography==
Owase is located in southeastern Kii Peninsula, in southern Mie Prefecture, facing the Gulf of Kumano the Pacific Ocean. Ninety percent of the city area is forested or coastal rias. Sandwiched between mountains and the offshore Kuroshio Current, the area has very heavy rainfall from spring through autumn. More than 80% of the population is concentrated in former Osawe town, on the coast.

===Climate===
Owase has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). It has comfortable spring and autumn seasons, and warm winters with practically no snow. The warm Kuroshio Current makes its closest contact with the Japanese coast at Owase. Combined with the high mountains falling almost to the sea, this gives Owase an extremely heavy annual rainfall of , which is the highest in the world at low altitudes in subtropical and warm temperate latitudes. Only certain parts of southern Chile, coastal British Columbia and the Adriatic Sea coast have as much rain at low elevations outside the tropics. Typhoons often pass Owase in summer.

Despite the excessive wetness of the climate, summers are no more uncomfortable or humid than in the rest of southern Japan. Humidity is marginally lower than in the cities close to the Seto Inland Sea or on the southern Sea of Japan.

===Demographics===
The population of Owase has decreased steadily over the past 50 years.

==History==
The area of present-day Owase was part of ancient Shima Province. It was transferred to Kii Province in 1582. During this time, large-scale forestry projects were begun. After the Meiji restoration, the area became part of Mie Prefecture. The town of Owase was established in April 1889, within Kitamuro District of Mie Prefecture, with the creation of the modern municipalities system.

The city of Owase was established in June 1954, by the merger of the town of Owase with the surrounding villages of Sugari and Kuki and the villages of Kitawauchi and Minamiwauchi, both from Minamimuro District.

==Government==
Owase has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 10 members. Owase, collectively with the towns of Kihoku, contributes two members to the Mie Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Mie 4th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Owase is mainly supported by its commercial fishery and forestry industries. Yellowtail, amberjack, Japanese horse mackerel, sauries, sea bream and bonito are among the fish landed at Owase. Japanese cypress and cryptomeria trees are found in abundance here in the mountains.

==Education==
Owase has five public elementary schools and two public middle schools operated by the city government. One public high school is operated by the Mie Prefectural Department of Education. The prefecture operates one special education school for the handicapped.

<doc id="329096" wikidata="Q290869" url="?curid=329096" title="Son montuno">
<text>Son montuno is a subgenre of son cubano developed by Arsenio Rodríguez in the 1940s. Although &quot;son montuno&quot; (&quot;mountain sound&quot;) had previously referred to the &quot;sones&quot; played in the mountains of eastern Cuba, Arsenio repurposed the term to denote a highly sophisticated approach to the genre in which the montuno section contained complex horn arrangements. He also incorporated piano solos and often subverted the structure of songs by starting with the montuno in a cyclic fashion. For his approach, Arsenio had to expand the existing &quot;septeto&quot; ensemble into the &quot;conjunto&quot; format which became the norm in the 1940s alongside big bands. Arsenio&#x27;s developments eventually served as the template for the development of genres such as salsa, songo and timba. 

==Background==
Son cubano developed in the late 19th century and soon became the most important genre of Cuban popular music. In addition, it is perhaps the most flexible of all forms of Latin American music, and is the foundation of many Cuban-based dance forms, and salsa. Its great strength is its fusion between European and African musical traditions.

The son arose in Oriente, merging the Spanish guitar and lyrical traditions with Afro-Cuban percussion and rhythms. We now know that its history as a distinct form is relatively recent. There is no evidence that it goes back further than the end of the nineteenth century. It moved from Oriente to Havana in about 1909, carried by members of the &quot;Permanent&quot; (the Army), who were sent out of their areas of origin as a matter of policy. The first recordings were in 1918.

There are many types of son, of which the &quot;son montuno&quot; is one. The term has been used in several ways. Probably the &#x27;montuno&#x27; originally referred to its origin in the mountainous regions of eastern Cuba; eventually, it was used more to describe the final up-tempo section of a son, with its semi-improvisation, repetitive vocal refrain and brash instrumental climax. The term was being used in the 1920s, when son sextetos set up in Havana and competed strongly with the older danzones.

== Development of the son montuno form ==
Cuban &quot;tresero&quot;, songwriter and bandleader Arsenio Rodríguez is considered the main figure in the development of son montuno as a form of dance music. He made several key innovations in the way rhythm is used in son cubano, leading to more complex arrangements which revolutionized the genre. The denser rhythmic weave of Rodríguez&#x27;s music required the addition of more instruments. Rodríguez added a second, and then, third trumpet, as well as the piano and the conga drum, the quintessential Afro-Cuban instrument. His bongo player used a large, hand-held cencerro (&#x27;cowbell&#x27;) during montunos (call-and-response chorus section).

===Layered guajeos===
Arsenio Rodríguez introduced the idea of layered guajeos (typical Cuban ostinato melodies)—an interlocking structure consisting of multiple contrapuntal parts. This aspect of the son&#x27;s modernization can be thought of as a matter of &quot;re-Africanizing&quot; the music. Helio Orovio recalls: &quot;Arsenio once said his trumpets played figurations the &#x27;Oriente&#x27; tres-guitarists played during the improvisational part of el son&quot; (1992: 11). The &quot;Oriente&quot; is the name given to the eastern end of Cuba, where the son was born. It is common practice for treseros to play a series of guajeo variations during their solos. Perhaps it was only natural then that it was Rodríguez the tres master, who conceived of the idea of layering these variations on top of each other. The following example is from the &quot;diablo&quot; section of Rodríguez&#x27;s &quot;Kila, Quique y Chocolate&quot; (1950). The excerpt consists of four interlocking guajeos: piano (bottom line), tres (second line), 2nd and 3rd trumpets (third line), and 1st trumpet (fourth line). 2-3 Clave is shown for reference (top line). Notice that the piano plays a single celled (single measure) guajeo, while the other guajeos are two-celled. It is common practice to combine single and double-celled ostinatos in Afro-Cuban music.
During the 1940s, the conjunto instrumentation was in full swing, as were the groups who incorporated the jazz band (or big band) instrumentation in the ensemble, guajeos (vamp-like lines) could be divided among each instrument section, such as saxes and brass; this became even more subdivided, featuring three or more independent riffs for smaller sections within the ensemble. By adopting polyrhythmic elements from the son, the horns took on a vamp-like role similar to the piano montuno and tres (or string) guajeo&quot;—Mauleón (1993: 155).

===Piano guajeos===
Arsenio Rodríguez took the pivotal step of replacing the guitar with the piano, which greatly expanded the contrapuntal and harmonic possibilities of Cuban popular music.

&quot;Dile a Catalina,&quot; sometimes called &quot;Traigo la yuca,&quot; may be Arsenio&#x27;s most famous composition. The first half uses the changüí/son method of paraphrasing the vocal melody, but the second half strikes out into bold new territory – using contrapuntal material not based on the song&#x27;s melody and employing a cross‐rhythm based on sequences of three ascending notes—Moore (2011: 39).

With Lilí Martínez as pianist, Arsenio&#x27;s conjunto recorded numerous songs with complex piano arrangements. For example, the piano guajeo for &quot;Dame un cachito pa&#x27; huele&quot; (1946) completely departs from both the generic son guajeo and the song&#x27;s melody. The pattern marks the clave by accenting the backbeat on the two-side. Moore observes: &quot;Like so many aspects of Arsenio&#x27;s music, this miniature composition is decades ahead of its time. It would be forty years before groups began to consistently apply this much creative variation at the guajeo level of the arranging process&quot;.

&quot;No me llores más&quot; [1948] stands out for its beautiful melodies and the incredible amount emotional intensity it packs into its ultra‐slow 58 bpm groove. The guajeo is based on the vocal melody and marks the clave relentlessly—Moore (2009: 48).

===Clave-specific bass tumbaos===

Arsenio Rodríguez brought a strong rhythmic emphasis back into the son. His compositions are clearly based on the key pattern known in Cuba as &quot;clave&quot;, a Spanish word for &#x27;key&#x27; or &#x27;code&#x27;.

When clave is written in two measures, as shown above, the measure with three strokes is referred to as the &quot;three-side&quot;, and the measure with two strokes—the &quot;two-side&quot;. When the chord progression begins on the three-side, the song, or phrase is said to be in 3-2 clave. When it begins on the two-side, it is in 2-3 clave. The 2-3 bass line of &quot;Dame un cachito pa&#x27; huele&quot; (1946) coincides with three of the clave&#x27;s five strokes. Listen to a midi version of the bass line for &quot;Dame un cachito pa&#x27; huele.&quot;
David García Identifies the accents of &quot;and-of-two&quot; (in cut-time) on the three-side, and the &quot;and-of-four&quot; (in cut-time) on the two-side of the clave, as crucial contributions of Rodríguez&#x27;s music. The two offbeats are present in the following 2-3 bass line from Rodríguez&#x27;s &quot;Mi chinita me botó&quot; (1944).

The two offbeats are especially important because they coincide with the two syncopated steps in the son&#x27;s basic footwork. The conjunto&#x27;s collective and consistent accentuation of these two important offbeats gave the son montuno texture its unique groove and, hence, played a significant part in the dancer&#x27;s &quot;feeling&quot; the music and dancing to it, as Bebo Valdés noted &quot;in &quot;contratiempo&quot;&quot; [&#x27;offbeat timing&#x27;]—García (2006: 43).

Moore points out that Arsenio Rodríguez&#x27;s conjunto introduced the two-celled bass tumbaos, that moved beyond the simpler, single-cell tresillo structure. This type of bass line has a specific alignment to clave, and contributes melodically to the composition. Rodríguez&#x27;s brother Raúl Travieso recounted, Rodríguez insisted that his bass players make the bass &quot;sing.&quot; Moore states: &quot;This idea of a bass tumbao with a melodic identity unique to a specific arrangement was critical not only to timba, but also to Motown, rock, funk, and other important genres.&quot;
Benny Moré (popularly known as &quot;El Bárbaro del Ritmo&quot;), which further evolved the genre, adding guaracha, bolero and mambo influences, helping make him extraordinarily popular and is now cited as perhaps the greatest Cuban sonero.

<doc id="329099" wikidata="Q3374970" url="?curid=329099" title="Secret decoder ring">
<text>A secret decoder ring (or secret decoder) is a device that allows one to decode a simple substitution cipher—or to encrypt a message by working in the opposite direction.

As inexpensive toys, secret decoders have often been used as promotional items by retailers, as well as radio and television programs, from the 1930s through to the current day.
Decoders, whether badges or rings, are an entertaining way for children to tap into a common fascination with encryption, ciphers, and secret codes, and are used to send hidden messages back and forth to one another.

==History==
Secret decoders are generally circular scales, descendants of the cipher disk developed in the 15th century by Leon Battista Alberti. Rather than the complex polyalphabetic Alberti cipher method, the decoders for children invariably use simple Caesar cipher substitutions.

The most well-known example started in 1934 with the Ovaltine company&#x27;s sponsored radio program &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;. The show&#x27;s fan club, &quot;Radio Orphan Annie&#x27;s Secret Society&quot;, distributed a member&#x27;s handbook that included a simple substitution cipher with a resulting numeric cipher text. This was followed the next year with a membership pin that included a cipher disk—enciphering the letters A–Z to numbers 1–26. From 1935 to 1940, metal decoders were produced for the promotion. From 1941 on, paper decoders were produced. Similar metal badges and pocket decoders continued with the &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; radio and television programs.

None of these early decoders were in the form of finger rings; however, &quot;secret compartment&quot; rings were common radio program premiums. In the early 1960s, secret decoder rings appeared—notably in conjunction with the &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; television program sponsored by PF Shoes. A later, less ornate, decoder ring was offered by Kix Cereals.

Today, high quality, stainless steel decoder rings for children and adults are being produced by companies such as Retroworks and ThinkGeek.

==Messages==
Ovaltine and other companies that marketed early decoders to children often included &quot;secret messages&quot; on their radio shows aimed at children. These could be decoded for a preview of the next episode of the show.

==Film references==
The film &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; (1983) depicts the &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; radio show transmitting a secret message that deciphered to: &quot;Be sure to drink your Ovaltine&quot;, unlike the actual broadcasts&#x27; secret code segments, which usually previewed the upcoming episode.

Decoder rings are mentioned by Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s character in &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;.

A &quot;Drogan&#x27;s Decoder Wheel&quot; is mentioned in the 1985 comedy movie &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; by characters played by Stephen Hoye and Dan Aykroyd.

Laura Petrie mentions her husband Rob&#x27;s &quot;Captain Midnight Decoder Ring,&quot; in Season 5, episode 27 of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;.

Kevin Pollak character Moishe Maisel finds a toy decoder ring in the cereal box of his grandson Ethan on Yom Kippur in season 2, episode 7 of &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; (&quot;Look, She Made a Hat&quot;).

===Climate===
Hikone has a Humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Hikone is 14.6 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1810 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.4 °C, and lowest in January, at around 3.6 °C. The highest recorded temperature was 37.7 °C (July 26, 2014) and the lowest was -11.3 °C (January 23, 1904).

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hikone has increased steadily over the past 60 years.

==History==
Hikone is part of ancient Ōmi Province and was originally a market town that developed around a Buddhist temple called Hogon-ji which was founded in the Heian period. The site was a natural bottleneck on the route of the Tōsandō (later the Nakasendō) highway connecting Heian-kyō with the eastern provinces. Hikone is home to two former post stations, Toriimoto-juku and Takamiya-juku on the Nakasendō and the Chōsenjin Kaidō also passed through the area. Strategically, it was a vital point in protecting the capital from attack from the east. In the Sengoku period, this area was controlled by the Azai clan, who were based in northern Ōmi, and who built a castle called Sawayama Castle. The Azai were defeated by Oda Nobunaga, who assigned Sawayama Castle to his general Niwa Nagahide. Under Toyotomi Hideyoshi, this closest advisor, Ishida Mitsunari was entrusted with the castle. After Ishida Mitsunari was defeated at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1601, Tokugawa Ieyasu appointed his general Ii Naomasa as &quot;daimyō&quot; of a new domain centered at Sawayama Castle. Ii Naomasa began the construction of Hikone Castle, which was completed by his son Ii Naokatsu in 1622. The area remained under the control of Hikone Domain through the end of the Edo Period.

The town of Hikone was established on April 1, 1889 within Inukami District, Shiga with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to city status on February 11, 1937 by merging with the neighboring villages of Matsubara, Aonami, Kitaaoyagi, Fukumitsu and Chimoto. The city escaped major damage in World War II.

In 2003, meetings were held to discuss the merger of Hikone with the towns of Toyosato, Kōra, and Taga (all from Inukami District). However, a survey conducted by the city in February 2004, revealed that most citizens opposed the merger, leading the city government to shelve the proposal.

==Government==

Hikone has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 24 members. Hikone, collectively with the towns of Inukami District, contributes four members to the Shiga Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Shiga 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==

The key industries of Hikone are the manufacturing of butsudan, textiles, and valves. Bridgestone has a tire manufacturing plant here. Fujitec, Ohmi Railway, and Heiwadō (the largest supermarket chain in Shiga) are headquartered in Hikone.

In 1999, a small area south of the castle, called the Yume Kyōbashi Castle Road, was built in the old style and attracts visitors keen to see modern construction fused with traditional looks. Even the Kansai Urban Bank in this district has remodeled itself to fit in with the surrounding structures.

==Education==

There are three universities in Hikone: Seisen University, Shiga University, and The University of Shiga Prefecture (USP).

Hikone is also the home of the Japan Center for Michigan Universities (JCMU), a facility operated jointly by a consortium of the fifteen public universities in the State of Michigan and the government of Shiga Prefecture (in coordination with USP) that offers programs for American university students and scholars for the study of Japanese language and culture, as well as courses in English for the citizens of Shiga Prefecture. The Michigan Center, as it is known, was founded in 1989, under the auspices of the Michigan-Shiga Sister State Agreement, the oldest such relationship between a US state and Japanese prefectures.

Hikone has 17 public elementary schools and seven public middle schools operated by the city government and one middle school operated by the Shiga Prefectural Department of Education. The prefecture also operates six public high schools and two special education schools for the handicapped. There are also two private high schools.

It is generally bounded by the Ibuki Mountains to the east, the Nosaka Mountains to the north and Lake Biwa to the south. The city is the second largest in the prefecture in terms of land area, after Takashima. The inland areas of the city are noted for very heavy snow accumulation in winter

The average annual rainfall is 2052 mm with July as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 24.0 °C, and lowest in January, at around 0.3 °C. 


==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Nagahama has remained relatively stable over the past 70 years.

==History==
Nagahama is part of ancient Ōmi Province and has been settled since at least the Yayoi period. During the Sengoku period, the area was contested between the Kyogoku clan, Azai clan and Asakura clan. The city center was developed and renamed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi when Hideyoshi moved the center of his administration from Odani Castle. Kunitomo (国友), the northeast of the city center, had been known for the production of arquebuses and guns since 1544. The settlement was originally called Imahama (今濱), but Hideyoshi renamed it &quot;Nagahama&quot;, taking one &quot;kanji&quot; from the name of his overlord, Oda Nobunaga. It is not related to the area of the same name in Fukuoka City and same name town in Ehime Prefecture. In the Edo period, it was largely under the control of Hikone Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate; however, the &quot;jin&#x27;ya&quot; of Ōmi-Miyagawa Domain, a 13,000 &quot;koku&quot; feudal holding under a cadet branch of the Hotta clan was located in what is now southeastern Nagahama. After the Meiji restoration, the town of Nagahama was established within Sakata District, Shiga with the creation of the modern municipalities system. 

On April 1, 1943, Nagahama annexed the neighboring villages of Kamiteru, Rokusho, Minamigori, Kitagori, Nishikuroda and Kanda to form the city of Nagahama. On February 13, 2006, the towns of Azai and Biwa (both from Higashiazai District) were merged into Nagahama. On January 1, 2010, the towns of Kohoku and Torahime (both from Higashiazai District), and the towns of Kinomoto, Nishiazai, Takatsuki and Yogo (all from Ika District) were merged into Nagahama. Both districts were thereby dissolved as a result of this merger.

The current city thus consists of areas once within three former districts; Sakata District, Higashiazai District and Ika District.

==Government==
Nagahama has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 26 members. Nagahama contributes four members to the Shiga Prefectural Assembly.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Ōmihachiman has recently plateaued after several decades of growth.

==History==
Ōmihachiman is part of ancient Ōmi Province and was originally a post station that developed around Musa-juku on the Tōsandō (later the Nakasendō) highway connecting Heian-kyō with the eastern provinces. During the Sengoku period, the warlord Oda Nobunaga built Azuchi Castle in the hills on the border with Higashiōmi. Under Toyotomi Hidetsugu the center shirted to a castle town at the base of Hachimanyama Castle, which attracted many merchants (&quot;Ōmi shōnin&quot;), especially after the destruction of Azuchi Castle. Former merchant&#x27;s residences and a canal used for transport are preserved in an old city area, designated a Preservation District for Groups of Traditional Buildings and an Important Cultural Landscape.

The town of Hachiman was established with Gamō District, Shiga with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. In 1905, an American architect William Merrell Vories came to Ōmihachiman as an English language teacher at commercial high school. Two years later he resigned the original work, but he remained in Ōmihachiman and spent most of his productive life here. He handed down western-style buildings, a pharmaceutical company, an educational foundation and a hospital to the city. The town expanded by annexing the neighboring villages of Utsuro in 1933 and Shima in 1951. On March 31, 1954, Hachiman merged with the villages of Okayama, Kanada, Kirihara and Mabuchi to form the city of Ōmihachiman. The name was changed from &quot;Hachiman&quot; to &quot;Ōmihachiman&quot; to avoid confusion with the then existing city of Yahata in Fukuoka Prefecture, as both &quot;Hachiman&quot; and &quot;Yawata&quot; are written in the same &quot;kanji&quot; characters. On March 21, 2010, the town of Azuchi was merged into Ōmihachiman.

Kusatsu is part of ancient Ōmi Province. It has been a transportation hub for east-west travel on the ancient Tōsandō and Tōkaidō highways connecting the capital of Heian-kyō with the provinces of eastern Japan from the end of the Nara period onwards. During the Muromachi period, it developed as a relay point between Kyoto and the Ise Grand Shrines. In 1422, when Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimochi made a pilgrimage to Ise, he built a palace, the &quot;Kusatsu Goshō&quot; in this location. Around 1568, Oda Nobunaga forced Ashikaga Yoshiaki to cede the Kusatsu area, which he viewed as strategically critical to controlling the approaches to Kyoto. Nobunaga made extensive road repairs and reconstructed the Seta Bridge. In the early Edo period, the system of post stations on the Nakasendō and Tōkaidō was formalized by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1602. Kusatsu-juku developed at the junction of these two highways as a post town from around this time.

The town of Kusatsu was established within Kurita District, Shiga with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On October 15, 1954, Kusatsu merged with the neighboring villages of Shizu, Oikami, Yamada, Kasanei and Tokiwa to form the city of Kusatsu.

<doc id="329109" wikidata="Q6237186" url="?curid=329109" title="John Hadl">
<text>John Willard Hadl (February 15, 1940 – November 30, 2022) was an American professional football player who was a quarterback for 16 years in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). He won an AFL championship with the San Diego Chargers in 1963. Hadl was named an AFL All-Star four times and was selected to two Pro Bowls. He was inducted into the Chargers Hall of Fame.

Hadl played college football for the Kansas Jayhawks. A two-time All-American, he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. Hadl played in three AFL title games with San Diego before the league&#x27;s merger with the NFL. He finished his career with the Los Angeles Rams, the Green Bay Packers and the Houston Oilers. He also played as a punter for five seasons.

==Early life==
Hadl was born in Lawrence, Kansas, to Jess and Judy Hadl. His father was a mechanic. Hadl attended Lawrence High School, where he was an all-state halfback.

==College career==
Hadl enrolled at the University of Kansas, where he played for his hometown Jayhawks. After playing halfback on both offense and defense as a sophomore, he played quarterback for his last two years, and was selected as the school&#x27;s Player of the Century. He was an All-American at halfback in 1960 and at quarterback in 1961.

Hadl was the first Kansas player to be picked twice for All-America (1960 and 1961) honors. Hadl also excelled as a defensive back, punt returner, and punter; he led the country with a 45.6-yard punting average in 1959. Hadl&#x27;s No. 21 jersey is one of only three Kansas has retired. Hadl was picked for the all-conference team for three seasons, and wound up with 1,345 yards passing and 1,041 yards rushing. Hadl still holds two Kansas records: longest interception return, a 98-yard run against TCU and longest punt, 94 yards versus Oklahoma.

With Hadl running the offense, the Jayhawks were ranked in the top 20 during his junior and senior years, finishing 15–5–2. He wrapped up his Kansas career leading his team to a 33–7 win over Rice in the Bluebonnet Bowl. He was also named MVP in the East–West Shrine Game and the College All-Star Game.

==Professional career==
===San Diego Chargers===
Hadl played at and . He joined the American Football League&#x27;s San Diego Chargers in 1962, having decided to play with them over the Detroit Lions (who selected him in the first round (tenth overall) of the NFL draft).

Hadl played in each game of his first season, although his use was more often in the second half than the first despite starting ten of fourteen games. His first pass in the AFL was a fifteen-yard touchdown pass to Bobby Jackson near the end of a 30–21 loss to the Denver Broncos. He made his first start with the September 23 game against the Houston Oilers, although he went 1-of-4 for six yards before being taken out for Dick Wood. The Chargers had three quarterbacks during that season, including Jack Kemp. Hadl had his highs and lows during this time, such as throwing three touchdowns along with three interceptions (the first of three games with three interceptions) on 7-of-14 passes against Oakland in a 42–33 win. He won just one of his nine starts, doing so in a 11-of-24 effort for 161 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception game versus Oakland on December 2, 1962.

Although the Chargers won four games that year, they improved to eleven in 1963, owing to the acquisition of 35-year old Tobin Rote as the new starting quarterback. While Rote started each game, Hadl did take action in mop-up duty, throwing 28-of-64 for 502 combined yards and six touchdowns and interceptions. In the AFL championship game, Rote and Hadl both got to play substantially against Boston, as they blew out the Patriots 51–10, with Hadl going 7-of-11 for 132 yards with both a passing and a rushing touchdown. Hadl also made two punts for the Chargers, kicking two of them for 75 yards.

The following year, Hadl started eight of the fourteen games while Rote did the other six. Hadl went 6-2 while throwing for 2,157 yards on eighteen touchdowns and fifteen interceptions with a 53.6 completion percentage, and he was named an AFL All-Star. However, in the 1964 AFL championship game, it was Rote who started against the Buffalo Bills and old teammate Kemp, now quarterbacking the opponent. After Rote threw a miserable 10-of-26 for 118 yards and a touchdown with a hobbled receiving corps (Lance Alworth and Keith Lincoln each suffered injury), Hadl was put in, but he went 3-of-10 for 31 yards and an interception as the Chargers lost 20–7. Hadl&#x27;s punting duties increased, as he punted 62 times for 2,447 yards, with one of the kicks going 71 yards.

In 1965, he was named San Diego&#x27;s starting quarterback and led the team to a 9–2–3 record while throwing 2,798 yards (a league high) for twenty touchdowns and 21 interceptions and a 50.0 completion percentage, all good for a second straight AFL-All Star appearance. Hadl made his third and final appearance in the AFL championship game that year. In his only start in said game, facing the Bills again, Hadl threw 11-of-23 for 140 yards and two interceptions as the Chargers were trounced 23–0. Hadl made punts for the second and last regular time, punting 38 times for 1,544 yards. Hadl would punt just three times for a hundred yards over the course of two separate seasons.

The following year, he started twelve of fourteen games (Steve Tensi started the other two). Hadl went 7–4–1 while throwing 2,846 yards for 23 touchdowns and fourteen interceptions for a 53.3 completion percentage, although the Chargers third-ranked offense was not enough for a playoff spot for the first time in four years. Hadl began a streak during the fifth game of the season. On October 8, he threw a touchdown pass against the New York Jets. For the rest of the season, Hadl would throw for at least one touchdown pass, and the streak would continue into the next season - his nineteen-game streak (October 8, 1966 - November 19, 1967) with at least one touchdown pass would be the longest streak by a quarterback in the American Football League. Hadl played in each game of the 1967 season, going 8–5–1 for 3,365 yards with 24 touchdowns and 22 interceptions while having a 50.8 completion percentage, and he led the league in yards gained per pass completion with 15.5. He improved further in 1968, leading the league in completions, attempts, yards (3,473), touchdowns (27), and interceptions (32, which was a career high) while having a 47.3 completion percentage and an All-Star selection. Despite going 9–5, it was only good enough for third place in the Western Division. In the final season of the AFL in 1969, the Chargers were a team in turmoil. Famed coach (and future member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame) Sid Gillman resigned due to health problems after going 4–5. Hadl played in ten games while Marty Domres started four games, and Hadl won five of his starts. He passed for 2,253 yards with ten touchdowns and eleven interceptions for a 48.8 completion percentage, and Hadl was named an AFL All-Star once again. In the AFL All-Star Game, he was named Most Valuable Player.

The Chargers had their fortunes dwindle in the prevailing years after the AFL–NFL merger, as they did not have another winning season until 1978. Hadl quarterbacked San Diego for the first three of those seasons. In 1970, he went 4–5–3 while passing for 2,388 yards with 22 touchdowns and fifteen interceptions for a 49.5 completion percentage. He had prime numbers in the following year, as he led the league in completions, attempts, yards (3,075), touchdowns (21), and yards per game (219.6) while throwing for 25 interceptions and a 54.1 completion percentage with a 6–8 record. Hadl became the second quarterback in history to lead two different leagues in passing yards (the first was Otto Graham), and it was third time in six years (1965, 1968) that he had led in passing.

In his final year with the Chargers in 1972, he went 4–9–1, passing for 2,449 yards with fifteen touchdowns and 26 interceptions (a league high) while having a 51.4 completion percentage and a Pro Bowl selection.

===Los Angeles Rams===
Hadl was traded to the Los Angeles Rams in January for defensive end Coy Bacon and running back Bob Thomas. In his only full season with the Rams, he had his first winning season since 1968 and first playoff appearance since 1965 as he led them to a 12–2 record, passing for 2,008 yards with 22 touchdowns and eleven interceptions while having a 52.3 completion percentage. He was named the National Football Conference (NFC) Player of the Year by UPI and selected to the Prow Bowl that season. In the playoffs that year, the Rams faced the Dallas Cowboys (10–4) at Texas Stadium, as the NFL playoffs at the time only included eight teams with rotated hosting duties. He went 7-of-23 for 133 yards with an interception as they lost 27–16 in a late fourth quarter rally in which the Rams were down by one point with ten minutes to go before the defense collapsed.

The following year was a turning point for two franchises. Hadl started the first five games for the Rams, then was replaced by James Harris during an upset loss to the Green Bay Packers in Milwaukee to fall to 3–2. The next game, a 37–14 home win over rival San Francisco, was the first NFL start for Harris, and 34-year-old Hadl was traded two days later to Green Bay for five draft picks—first and second round picks for 1975 and 1976, as well as a third round pick in 1975.

===Green Bay Packers===
Reportedly, head coach and general manager Dan Devine felt that an experienced quarterback was the only thing standing between the Packers and only their second playoff appearance since 1967, and it came about after an attempted trade for Archie Manning and the New Orleans Saints fell through. The trade turned out to be an unmitigated disaster; it is reckoned as one of the worst (if not &quot;the&quot; worst) trades for a starting quarterback in NFL history, at least in terms of relevance. Devine had led them to a combined record of 19—19–4 in his first three seasons, which included a playoff loss in 1972. The Packers finished 6–8 in 1974 and Devine left for Notre Dame, which left the door open for Bart Starr to take over as head coach. While he would lead them to one playoff win as a coach, Starr had just three of nine seasons with eight wins.

At the same time, the Rams used the picks acquired in the trade to acquire many of the players that allowed them to dominate the NFC West for the rest of the 1970s and lead them to an appearance in Super Bowl XIV. In later years, when asked for his thoughts on the infamous deal, Hadl himself expressed the surprise he felt, in 1974, at being sent to Green Bay: &quot;I really didn&#x27;t believe it... I didn&#x27;t think anyone would be that desperate.&quot;

Meanwhile, with a combined record of 6–5 on two teams, Hadl threw for 1,752 yards with eight touchdowns and fourteen interceptions and a 47.5 completion percentage. His only full season with the Packers was in 1975, and with a miserable front line, he threw for six touchdowns and 21 interceptions for 2,095 yards and a 54.1 completion percentage while being sacked 35 times in a 4–9 season.

===Houston Oilers===
Hadl moved to the Houston Oilers in , mostly in mop up duty for starter Dan Pastorini. He started six games over two seasons and won just once while throwing seven total touchdowns to eleven interceptions for 710 yards.

Despite his tenure with Green Bay, Hadl finished with a starting record of 82–76–9 in his professional career. At the time of his retirement, Hadl was sixth all time in wins at the quarterback position with 82. With the exception of Roman Gabriel, each of those quarterbacks are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He ranks 40th in all-time wins, although he has more wins than Hall of Famers that played in his era such as Sonny Jurgensen, Joe Namath, and George Blanda.

Hadl holds the NFL record for the most tied games (nine) by a starting quarterback. Hadl wore No. 21 for nearly his entire NFL career, aside from his first season with Green Bay when he briefly wore No. 12. He was the last regular starting quarterback to wear a uniform number greater than No. 19 before the NFL adopted a rigid uniform numbering system in 1973. Hadl was still on the top ten of most touchdowns thrown by a quarterback as late as 1999 (over twenty years after retirement), with him and two others in that list not being members of the Hall of Fame (Dave Krieg and Boomer Esiason being the others), as his former peak of fifth has receded to 26 with the advent of increased passing in subsequent years.

Hadl was inducted into the Chargers Hall of Fame in 1983. The Professional Football Researchers Association named him to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2006.

==Coaching and administrative career==
Upon retiring as a player after the 1977 season, Hadl returned to his alma mater and served as quarterback coach under Bud Moore at the University of Kansas in 1978. From 1979 to 1981, he remained at KU, moving up to offensive coordinator under new head coach Don Fambrough. At this time, he was pegged as the &quot;unnamed assistant football coach&quot; who provided improper benefits to Kansas recruits in the early 1980s, resulting in the NCAA imposing sanctions on the football program. Hadl consistently denied any wrongdoing and his tenure with Kansas athletics hasn&#x27;t yielded any suggestion of rules violations.

Unable to return to the program after 1981, he moved on to the Los Angeles Rams as an assistant coach in 1982. In 1983, he joined the Denver Broncos as the quarterback coach, where he was tasked with turning highly touted draft pick John Elway into a franchise quarterback.

After one season, Hadl decided to move on and became the head coach of the Los Angeles Express of the United States Football League (USFL) during 1984 and 1985, compiling a record of 13–23 in the regular season, 1–1 in the postseason. Hadl would later call this decision a &quot;career blunder.&quot;

Hadl ended his career as associate athletic director at the University of Kansas.

==Death==
Hadl died on November 30, 2022, at the age of 82.

==History==

Moriyama is part of ancient Ōmi Province. The area contains many archaeological sites from the Jōmon and especially the Yayoi period, and the Yasu River has been a key point for east-west transportation since ancient times. It was the site of a battle in the Asuka period Jinshin War, and during the Muromachi period was the location of a villa for Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshiaki. It later became a stronghold for the &quot;Ikkō-ikki&quot; movement. During the Edo Period, Moriyama-juku prospered as a post station on the Nakasendō) highway connecting Kyoto with the eastern provinces and Edo. The area was mostly &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under the direct administration of the Tokugawa shogunate. The village of Moriyama was stablished within Yasu District, Shiga on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to town status in 1904. Moriyama annexed neighboring Monobe Village from Kurita District in 1941 and Ozu, Tamatsu, Kawanishi and Hayano villages from Yasu district in 1955. On July 1, 1970 Moriyama was raised to city status.

In terms of national politics, the city is part of Shiga 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Moriyama traditionally had an economy based on agriculture and some commercial fishing on Lake Biwa. Melons were (and are) a noted local product. However, due to its location and transportation connections, the population growth of the city has been primarily as a commuter town to the nearby Kyoto, Osaka and Ōtsu urban areas.

The forces of Rokkaku, Iga, and Kōka defeated those of the shogun, and the ninja gained significant fame from their military actions.

During the Edo Period, much of the area which became Rittō was under control of either Zeze Domain or was tenryo territory directly administered by the Tokugawa shogunate. The area was organized into villages within Kurita District, Shiga with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.

<text>Granby is a town in the southwestern region of Quebec east of Montreal. According to the latest statistics from the 2021 Canadian Census, Granby has a population of 69,025. It is the administrative center of La Haute-Yamaska Regional County Municipality and is the second most populous city in The Eastern Townships after Sherbrooke. The town&#x27;s name is derived from John Manners, Marquess of Granby. One of the town&#x27;s main attractions is the Granby Zoo, and its well-known Lac Boivin fountain, also a notable landmark of the area. The mayor, Julie Bourdon was elected on November 7th, 2021, being the first female mayor of Granby.

==History==

Granby’s terrain, frequently characterized as a natural prairie, historically dotted with natural meadows and a rich tapestry of forests, was home to a variety of trees such as ash, fir, maple, hemlock, and birch. Not far from these woods, a small swamp could be found, nestled a short distance uphill. Over time, this land was traversed by Indigenous peoples, whose presence was intertwined with the area’s nomadic history.

In 1792, the Eastern Townships were officially opened for colonization by Loyalists. Subsequently, on January 29, 1803, Colonel Henry Caldwell and his 97 associates were granted the Township of Granby by the Executive Council of Quebec. The township’s first settler, John Horner, arrived in 1813 and established a sawmill adjacent to the Yamaska River. By 1825, Horner, in partnership with Richard Frost, expanded his enterprise to include a general store. That same year, Frost was responsible for drafting the township’s official plans.

Granby received official incorporation as a municipality in the year of 1816, marking its status as a town in 1971. 

Field areas have been exploited for agricultural use and the North Yamaska river&#x27;s flow has been used for its hydraulic energy since the construction of a first dam in 1815 by large industrial companies; the use of dams along the stream has provoked the formation of a large shallow swamp, called Lac Boivin, often cited as one of Granby&#x27;s landmarks.

In May 2006, the citizens of Granby and Granby Township held a referendum on a possible merger. A majority of citizens of the two municipalities approved the merger, which took effect on January 1, 2007.

==Geography==

Granby is a flat region located approximately halfway between Montreal and Sherbrooke along Autoroute 10; historically a land covered by forests and prairies, it has transformed into an urbanized core surrounded by fields and suburban neighborhoods. The North Yamaska river, which crosses lake Boivin (this lake took shape after the construction of a series of dams and later changed into a large swamp praised for its biodiversity. It connects to nearby villages by a network of roads and has two access points from the highway at exit 68 (through Saint-Alphonse-de-Granby) and 74 (via Bromont).

<doc id="329114" wikidata="Q6384651" url="?curid=329114" title="Keith Lincoln">
<text>Keith Payson Lincoln (May 8, 1939 – July 27, 2019) was an American professional football player who was a halfback for eight seasons in the American Football League (AFL), primarily with the San Diego Chargers. He played college football for the Washington State Cougars. Lincoln was a two-time All-AFL selection and a five-time AFL All-Star. A member of the Chargers Hall of Fame, he won an AFL championship with the Chargers in 1963, when he was named the most valuable player (MVP) of the championship game. He had a stint with the Buffalo Bills before returning to San Diego and finishing his career.

==Early life==
Born in Reading, Michigan, on May 8, 1939, Lincoln graduated in 1957 from Monrovia High School in Monrovia, California, in Los Angeles County. He played college football at Washington State University (WSU) in Pullman, Washington. Originally a quarterback on the Cougars&#x27; freshman team, he was moved to halfback and was also the team&#x27;s punter. He was nicknamed the &quot;Moose of the Palouse&quot;, given to him by a sportswriter from Spokane.

Lincoln was inducted into the WSU Athletic Hall of Fame and the State of Washington Sports Hall of Fame in 1980. In 1995, he was named to Washington State&#x27;s all-time team by a panel of experts commissioned by &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the school&#x27;s football program.

==Professional career==
Lincoln began his career with the San Diego Chargers, who selected him in the 1961 AFL draft, choosing them over the Chicago Bears of the more established NFL. As a rookie in 1961, he had a 91-yard reception for a touchdown, the longest catch in the AFL that year. His 86- and 76-yard touchdown runs in 1962 and 1963, respectively, were the league&#x27;s longest run in those seasons. His 103-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in 1963 was the AFL&#x27;s longest that year, and is tied for the Chargers team record with Darren Sproles (2008).

In the 1963 AFL championship game, Lincoln was voted the game MVP after the Chargers routed the Boston Patriots 51–10. It remains the only league title in the franchise&#x27;s history, as well as the city of San Diego&#x27;s only championship in a major sports league. In the game, Lincoln carried the ball 13 times for 206 yards and had seven catches for 123 yards, compiling an AFL-record 329yards from scrimmage; he also passed for 20 yards. The record stood for both AFL and NFL players until 1971, when Kansas City Chiefs running back Ed Podolak gained 350 in a double-overtime playoff game against the Miami Dolphins. Lincoln&#x27;s 206 yards rushing remained an NFL playoff record for 22 years, when Eric Dickerson of the Los Angeles Rams gained 248 against the Dallas Cowboys in 1985.

In the 1964 AFL Championship Game, in a play which came to be known as the &quot;Hit Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot;, Lincoln was the recipient of a particularly hard tackle from Buffalo Bills linebacker Mike Stratton which broke one of his ribs and forced him out of the game midway through the first quarter.

Lincoln was traded to the Buffalo Bills in 1967. He was productive that season, but was waived toward the end of the 1968 season before returning to San Diego and playing one game. Over his eight-year career, Lincoln rushed for 3,383 yards and 19 touchdowns and had 165 receptions for 2,250 yards and 19 touchdowns. He was a two-time All-AFL selection (1963, 1964) and a five-time AFL All-Star (1962–1965, 1967), twice being named the game&#x27;s MVP (1963, 1964). He was inducted into the Chargers Hall of Fame in 1980, and was also named to their 40th and 50th anniversary teams.

==NFL career statistics==

==Later years==
After retiring as a player, Lincoln was a college assistant coach for the Idaho Vandals in 1970 under first-year head coach Don Robbins. He became an assistant coach at his alma mater WSU in 1971 under fourth-year head coach Jim Sweeney, and later became the school&#x27;s long-time director of alumni relations.

==Personal life==
Lincoln was married to Bonnie Jo Lincoln ( McKarcher). They had two sons, Lance and Keith (nicknamed &quot;Kip&quot;).

Lincoln died at age 80 of congestive heart failure at Pullman Regional Hospital on July 27, 2019.

<doc id="329115" wikidata="Q924408" url="?curid=329115" title="Fulgurite">
<text>Fulgurites (), commonly called &quot;fossilized lightning&quot;, are natural tubes, clumps, or masses of sintered, vitrified, or fused soil, sand, rock, organic debris and other sediments that sometimes form when lightning discharges into ground. When composed of silica, fulgurites are classified as a variety of the mineraloid lechatelierite.

When ordinary negative polarity cloud-ground lightning discharges into a grounding substrate, greater than 100 million volts (100 MV) of potential difference may be bridged. Such current may propagate into silica-rich quartzose sand, mixed soil, clay, or other sediments, rapidly vaporizing and melting resistant materials within such a common dissipation regime. This results in the formation of generally hollow and/or vesicular, branching assemblages of glassy tubes, crusts, and clumped masses. Fulgurites have no fixed composition because their chemical composition is determined by the physical and chemical properties of whatever material is being struck by lightning.

Fulgurites are structurally similar to Lichtenberg figures, which are the branching patterns produced on surfaces of insulators during dielectric breakdown by high-voltage discharges, such as lightning.

==Description==
Fulgurites are formed when lightning strikes the ground, fusing and vitrifying mineral grains. The primary SiO2 phase in common tube fulgurites is lechatelierite, an amorphous silica glass. Many fulgurites show some evidence of crystallization: in addition to glasses, many are partially protocrystalline or microcrystalline. Because fulgurites are generally amorphous in structure, fulgurites are classified as mineraloids. Peak temperatures within a lightning channel exceed 30,000 K, with sufficient pressure to produce planar deformation features in SiO2, a kind of polymorphism. This is also known colloquially as shocked quartz.

Material properties (size, color, texture) of fulgurites vary widely, depending on the size of the lightning bolt and the composition and moisture content of the surface struck by lightning. Most natural fulgurites fall on a spectrum from white to black. Iron is a common impurity that can result in a deep brownish-green coloration. Lechatelierite similar to fulgurites can also be produced via controlled (or uncontrolled) arcing of artificial electricity into a medium. Downed high voltage power lines have produced brightly colored lechatelierites, due to the incorporation of copper or other materials from the power lines. Brightly colored lechatelierites resembling fulgurites are usually synthetic and reflect the incorporation of synthetic materials. However, lightning can strike man-made objects, resulting in colored fulgurites.

The interior of Type I (sand) fulgurites normally is smooth or lined with fine bubbles, while their exteriors are coated with rough sedimentary particles or small rocks. Other types of fulgurites are usually vesicular, and may lack an open central tube; their exteriors can be porous or smooth. Branching fulgurites display fractal-like self-similarity and structural scale invariance as a macroscopic or microscopic network of root-like branches, and can display this texture without central channels or obvious divergence from morphology of context or target (e.g. sheet-like melt, rock fulgurites). Fulgurites are usually fragile, making the field collection of large specimens difficult.

Fulgurites can exceed 20 centimeters in diameter and can penetrate deep into the subsoil, sometimes occurring as far as below the surface that was struck, although they may also form directly on a sedimentary surface. One of the longest fulgurites to have been found in modern times was a little over in length, found in northern Florida. The Yale University Peabody Museum of Natural History displays one of the longest known preserved fulgurites, approximately in length. Charles Darwin in &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot; recorded that tubes such as these found in Drigg, Cumberland, UK reached a length of . Fulgerites at Winans Lake, Livingston County, Michigan, extended discontinuously throughout a 30 m range and arguably include the largest reported fulgurite mass ever recovered and described: its largest section extending approximately 16 ft (4.88 m) in length by 1 ft in diameter (30 cm).

=== Classification ===
Fulgurites have been classified into five types related to the type of sediment in which the fulgurite formed, as follows:

* Type I – sand fulgurites with tubaceous structure; their central axial void may be collapsed
* Type II – soil fulgurites; these are glass-rich, and form in a wide range of sediment compositions, including clay-rich soils, silt-rich soils, gravel-rich soils, and loessoid; these may be tubaceous, branching, vesicular, irregular/slaggy, or may display a combination of these structures, and can produce exogenic fulgurites (droplet fulgurites)
* Type III – caliche or calcic sediment fulgurites, having thick, often surficially glazed granular walls with calcium-rich vitreous groundmass with little or no lechatelierite glass; their shapes are variable, with multiple narrow central channels common, and can span the entire range of morphological and structural variation for fulguritic objects
* Type IV – rock fulgurites, which are either crusts on minimally altered rocks, networks of tunneling within rocks, vesicular outgassed rocks (often glazed by a silicide-rich and/or metal oxide crust), or completely vitrified and dense rock material and masses of these forms with little sedimentary groundmass
* Type V – [droplet] fulgurites (exogenic fulgurites), which show evidence of ejection (e.g. spheroidal, filamentous, or aerodynamic), related by composition to Type II and Type IV fulgurites
* &quot;phytofulgurite&quot; – a proposed class of objects resulting from partial to total alteration of biomass (e.g. grasses, lichens, moss, wood) by lightning, described as &quot;natural glasses formed by cloud-to-ground lightning.&quot; These were excluded from the classification scheme because they are not glasses, so classifying them as a subset of fulgurites is debatable.

== Significance ==
The presence of fulgurites in an area can be used to estimate the frequency of lightning over a period of time, which can help to understand past regional climates. Paleolightning is the study of various indicators of past lightning strikes, primarily in the form of fulgurites and lightning-induced remanent magnetization signatures.

Many high-pressure, high-temperature materials have been observed in fulgurites. Many of these minerals and compounds are also known to be formed in extreme environments such as nuclear weapon tests, hypervelocity impacts, and interstellar space. Shocked quartz was first described in fulgurites in 1980. Other materials, including highly reduced silicon-metal alloys (silicides), the fullerene allotropes C60 (buckminsterfullerenes) and C70, as well as high-pressure polymorphs of SiO2, have since been identified in fulgurites. Reduced phosphides have been identified in fulgurites, in the form of schreibersite ( and ), and titanium(III) phosphide. These reduced compounds are otherwise rare on Earth due to the presence of oxygen in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, which creates oxidizing surface conditions.

==History==
Fulgurite tubes have been mentioned already by Persian polymaths Avicenna and Al-Biruni in the 11th century, without knowing their true origination. Over the following centuries fulgurites have been described but missinterpreted as a result of subterrestrial fires, falsely attributing curative powers to them, e.g. by Leonhard David Hermann 1711 in his &quot;Maslographia&quot;. Other famous natural scientists, among them Charles Darwin, Horace Bénédict de Saussure and Alexander von Humboldt gave attention to fulgurites, without discovering the relationship to lightning. 

In 1805 the true process of forming fulgurites by lightning strikes to the ground was identified by agriculturist Hentzen and mineralogist and mining engineer Johann Karl Wilhelm Voigt. In 1817 mineralogist and mining engineer Karl Gustav Fiedler published and comprehensively documented the phenomenon in the &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot;.

<doc id="329116" wikidata="Q329466" url="?curid=329116" title="Freddy Krueger">
<text>Freddy Krueger () is a fictional character and the antagonist of the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; horror film franchise. Created by Wes Craven, he made his debut in Craven&#x27;s &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984) as the malevolent spirit of a child killer who had been burned to death by his victims&#x27; parents after evading prison. Krueger goes on to murder his victims in their dreams, causing their deaths in the real world as well. In the dream world, he is a powerful force and seemingly invulnerable. However, whenever Freddy is pulled back into the real world, he has normal human vulnerabilities and can be destroyed. He is commonly identified by his burned, disfigured face, dirty red-and-green-striped sweater and brown fedora, and trademark metal-clawed, brown leather, right hand glove. This glove was the product of Krueger&#x27;s own imagination, having welded the blades himself before using it to murder many of his victims, both in the real and dream worlds. Over the course of the film series, Freddy has battled several reoccurring survivors including Nancy Thompson and Alice Johnson. The character was consistently portrayed by Robert Englund in the original film series as well as in the television spin-off &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot;. The reboot portrays him as an undead groundskeeper accused of molesting the students.

The character quickly became a pop culture icon going on to appear in toy lines, comic books, books, sneakers, costumes, and video games since his debut. In 2003, Krueger appeared alongside fellow horror icon Jason Voorhees in &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;. In 2010, a reboot of the original &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film, starring Jackie Earle Haley, was released.

&quot;Wizard&quot; magazine rated Freddy the 14th-greatest villain of all time; the British television channel Sky2 listed him 8th, and the American Film Institute ranked him 40th on its &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains&quot; list. In 2010, Freddy was nominated for the award for Best Villain (formerly Most Vile Villain) at the Scream Awards.

==Appearances==
===Film===
In &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, Freddy is introduced as a serial child killer, Fred Krueger, from the fictitious town of Springwood, Ohio, who kills his victims with a bladed leather glove he crafted in a boiler room where he used to take his 20 victims. He is captured, but is set free on a technicality when it is discovered that the search warrant was not signed in the right place. He is hunted down by a mob made up of the town&#x27;s vengeful parents and cornered in the boiler room. The mob douses the building with gasoline and sets it on fire by throwing Molotov cocktails, burning him alive. While his body dies, his spirit lives on within the dreams of a group of teenagers and pre-adolescents living on Elm Street, whom he preys on by entering their dreams and killing them, fueled by the town&#x27;s memories and fear of him and empowered by a trio of &#x27;dream demons&#x27; to be their willing instrument of evil. He is apparently destroyed at the end of the film by protagonist Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), but the last scene reveals that he has survived. He goes on to antagonize the teenage protagonists of the film&#x27;s sequels, including Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton), Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette), Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox), and Lori Campbell (Monica Keena).

In &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot;, more of Freddy&#x27;s backstory is revealed by the mysterious nun who repeatedly appears to Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson). Freddy&#x27;s mother, Amanda Krueger (Nan Martin), was a nun and a nurse at the asylum featured in the film. At the time she worked there, a largely abandoned, run-down wing of the asylum was used to lock up entire hordes of the most insane criminals all at once. When Amanda was young, she was accidentally locked into the room with the criminals over a holiday weekend. They managed to keep her hidden for days, raping her repeatedly. When she was finally discovered, she was barely alive and pregnant, with the result that Krueger was regarded as &quot;the bastard son of a hundred maniacs&quot; due to it being impossible to determine which of the rapists was his biological father. In &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot;, it is revealed that Freddy was adopted by an alcoholic named Mr. Underwood (Alice Cooper), who abused him throughout his childhood until Freddy finally murdered him as a teenager (Tobe Sexton), becoming his first kill. Freddy tortured animals and engaged in self-mutilation, and became a serial killer by murdering the children of people who had bullied him when he was a child. Prior to his murder, he was married to a woman named Loretta (Lindsey Fields), whom he also murdered after she discovers his secret. He also had a daughter, Katherine/Maggie (Lisa Zane), who seeks to end her father&#x27;s horrific legacy once and for all, killing him at the end of the movie.

After a hiatus following the release of &quot;The Final Nightmare&quot;, Krueger was brought back in &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; by Wes Craven, who had not worked on the film series since the third film, &quot;Dream Warriors&quot;. &quot;New Nightmare&quot; coincides with the approaching anniversary of the release of the first film. Robert Englund, who portrayed Krueger throughout the film series and its television spin-off, also took the role as a fictional version of himself in &quot;New Nightmare&quot;; it is implied that Englund was stalked by his character, who is an ancient demonic entity that took on the form of Wes Craven&#x27;s creation and has come to life from the film franchise&#x27;s fictitious world. Having been in various manifestations throughout the ages as the entity can be captured through storytelling, it is hinted that it was once in the form of the old witch from Brothers Grimm&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; when it was held prisoner in this allegory based on actions. Englund describes to his former co-star and friend Heather Langenkamp that this embodiment of Freddy is darker and more evil than as portrayed by him in the films; he struggles to keep his sanity intact from Krueger&#x27;s torments and goes into hiding with his family. Krueger aims to stop another film of the franchise from being made, eliminating the films&#x27; crew members, including Langenkamp&#x27;s husband, Chase Porter (David Newsom), after stealing a prototype bladed glove from him, and causes nightmares and makes threatening phone calls to producer Robert Shaye. The entity also haunts Wes Craven&#x27;s dreams, to the point that he sees future events related to Krueger&#x27;s actions and then writes them down as a movie script. Krueger sees Langenkamp as his primary foe because her character Nancy Thompson was the first to defeat him. Krueger&#x27;s attempts to cross over to reality cause a series of earthquakes throughout Los Angeles County, including the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Langenkamp, with help from her son Dylan (Miko Hughes), succeeds in defeating the entity and apparently destroys him; however, Krueger&#x27;s creator reveals that it is again imprisoned in the fictitious world, indicated by the character&#x27;s later appearances in films and other medias.

In 2003, Freddy battled fellow horror icon Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) from the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; film series in the theatrical release &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, a film which officially resurrected both characters from their respective deaths and subsequently sent them to Hell. As the film begins, Krueger is frustrated at his current inability to kill as knowledge of him has been hidden in Springwood, prompting him to manipulate Jason into killing in his place in the hope that the resulting fear will remind others of him so that he can resume his own murder spree. However, Freddy&#x27;s plan proves too effective when Jason starts killing people before Freddy can do it, culminating in a group of teens learning the truth and drawing Freddy and Jason to Camp Crystal Lake in the hope that they can draw Freddy into the real world so that Jason will kill him and remain &quot;home.&quot; The ending of the film is left ambiguous as to whether or not Freddy is actually dead; despite being decapitated, when Jason emerges from the lake carrying his head he looks and winks at the audience. A sequel featuring Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) from the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; franchise was planned, but never materialized onscreen. It was later turned into Dynamite Entertainment&#x27;s comic book series &quot;Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash&quot;.

In the 2010 remake of the original film, Freddy&#x27;s backstory is that he was a groundskeeper at Springwood Badham Preschool who tortured and sexually abused the teenage protagonists of the film when they were children. When their parents found out, they trapped him in a boiler room at an industrial park and set it on fire with a Molotov cocktail made out of a gasoline canister, killing him. As a spirit, he takes his revenge on the teenagers by haunting their dreams; he is particularly obsessed with Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara), who had been his &quot;favorite&quot; when she was a child. Krueger&#x27;s power comes from his prey&#x27;s memories and emotions upon remembering the abuse they suffered at his hands. His bladed glove is made out of discarded pieces of his gardening tools. Nancy destroys him at the end of the film by pulling his spirit into the physical world and cutting his throat; the final scene reveals that Freddy&#x27;s spirit has survived, however.

===Television===
Englund continued to portray Krueger in the 1988 television anthology series, &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot;. The show was hosted by Freddy, who did not take direct part in most of the episodes, but he did show up occasionally to influence the plot of particular episodes. Further, a consistent theme in each episode was characters having disturbing dreams. The series ran for 44 episodes over two seasons, ending on March 10, 1990. Although a bulk of the episodes did not feature Freddy taking a major role in the plot, the pilot episode, &quot;No More, Mr. Nice Guy&quot;, depicts the events of his trial, and his subsequent death at the hands of the parents of Elm Street after his acquittal. In &quot;No More, Mr. Nice Guy&quot;, though Freddy&#x27;s case seems open and shut, a mistrial is declared based on the arresting officer, Lt. Tim Blocker (Ian Patrick Williams), not reading Krueger his Miranda rights, which is different from the original &quot;Nightmare&quot;, which stated he was released because someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place. The episode also reveals that Krueger used an ice cream van to lure children close enough so that he could kidnap and kill them. After the town&#x27;s parents burn Freddy to death he returns to haunt Blocker in his dreams. Freddy gets his revenge when Blocker is put under anesthesia at the dentist&#x27;s office, and Freddy shows up and kills him. The episode &quot;Sister&#x27;s Keeper&quot; was a &quot;sequel&quot; to this episode, even though it was the seventh episode of the series. The episode follows Krueger as he terrorizes Blocker&#x27;s identical twin daughters and frames one sister for the other&#x27;s murder. Season two&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s My Party And You&#x27;ll Die If I Want You To&quot; featured Freddy attacking a high school prom date who stood him up 20 years earlier. He gets his revenge with his desire being fulfilled in the process.

==Creation and development==
Wes Craven said his inspiration for the basis of Freddy Krueger&#x27;s power stemmed from several stories in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven&#x27;s original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the &quot;worst thing&quot; he could think of. The decision was made to instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; went into production. Craven&#x27;s inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 12, and the 1970s pop song &quot;Dream Weaver&quot; by Gary Wright. In an interview, Craven said of the disfigured stranger:

When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, &#x27;Yes, I&#x27;m still looking at you.&#x27; The man walked towards the apartment building&#x27;s entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone.

===Portrayals and design===

According to Robert Englund, Freddy&#x27;s look was based on Klaus Kinski&#x27;s portrayal of Count Dracula in &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot; (1979) and some of the works of Lon Chaney, while he based Freddy&#x27;s poise and gait on the &quot;Cagney stance&quot; originated by actor James Cagney. Freddy&#x27;s characteristic of keeping his gloved arm lower than the other was incidental due to the knives being heavy to wear for Englund and forcing him to carry himself as such while playing the role.

Freddy&#x27;s physical appearance has stayed largely consistent throughout the film series, although small changes were made in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (solid red sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn work boots, in keeping with his blue collar background. The choice to have Freddy wear a fedora was reportedly Craven&#x27;s idea. In a 2018 interview, Englund stated:

The fedora was Wes&#x27;s idea. But he&#x27;d been talked into maybe trying some other hats. And they had this box of hats, and we&#x27;re sitting on the floor—kind of uncomfortably, both of these grown men on this futon—and [they&#x27;re] telling me to put on all of these different hats. I&#x27;m sitting there in makeup going, &quot;Guys, please, the fedora is right.&quot; And they kept putting on like, paperboy hats, and baseball hats, and God, one looked like a pimp hat. It was like, &quot;What are you thinking, you guys?&quot; I think I said something to Wes like, &quot;Look, the fedora was your idea.&quot; And I stood and showed my shadow on the wall with the [fedora] hat, and how strong that silhouette was. And then I took the hat off and showed the baldness, revealing the baldness, and how he could save that for the right time in the movie. And I kind of got my way.

Freddy&#x27;s skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy&#x27;s face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much longer than he does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the tips of his fingers. As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a superhero-inspired version of his sweater with a cape (&quot;The Dream Child&quot;), appearing as a video game sprite (&quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead&quot;), a giant snake-like creature (&quot;Dream Warriors&quot;), and a hookah-smoking caterpillar (&quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;).

In &quot;New Nightmare&quot;, Freddy&#x27;s appearance is updated considerably, giving him a green fedora that matches his sweater stripes, skin-tight leather pants, knee-high black boots, a turtleneck version of his trademark sweater, a blue-black trench coat, and a fifth claw on his glove, which also has a far more organic appearance, resembling the exposed muscle tissue of an actual hand. Freddy also has fewer burns on his face, though these are more severe, with his muscle tissue exposed in numerous places. Compared to his other incarnations, these Freddy&#x27;s injuries are more like those of an actual burn victim. For the 2010 remake, Freddy is returned to his iconic attire, but the burns on his face are intensified with further bleaching of the skin and exposed facial tissue on the left cheek, more reminiscent of actual third-degree burns than in the original series.

====Bladed glove====
Wes Craven stated that part of the inspiration for Freddy&#x27;s infamous bladed glove was from his cat, as he watched it claw the side of his couch one night.

In an interview he said, &quot;Part of it was an objective goal to make the character memorable, since it seems that every character that has been successful has had some kind of unique weapon, whether it be a chain saw or a machete, etc. I was also looking for a primal fear which is embedded in the subconscious of people of all cultures. One of those is the fear of teeth being broken, which I used in my first film. Another is the claw of an animal, like a saber-toothed tiger reaching with its tremendous hooks. I transposed this into a human hand. The original script had the blades being fishing knives.&quot;

When Jim Doyle, the creator of Freddy&#x27;s claw, asked Craven what he wanted, Craven responded, &quot;It&#x27;s kind of like really long fingernails, I want the glove to look like something that someone could make who has the skills of a boilermaker.&quot; Doyle explained, &quot;Then we hunted around for knives. We picked out this bizarre-looking steak knife, we thought that this looked really cool, we thought it would look even cooler if we turned it over and used it upside down. We had to remove the back edge and put another edge on it, because we were actually using the knife upside down.&quot; Later Doyle had three duplicates of the glove made, two of which were used as stunt gloves in long shots.

For &quot;New Nightmare&quot;, Lou Carlucci, the effects coordinator, remodeled Freddy&#x27;s glove for a more &quot;organic look&quot;. He says, &quot;I did the original glove on the first &quot;Nightmare&quot; and we deliberately made that rough and primitive looking, like something that would be constructed in somebody&#x27;s home workshop. Since this is supposed to be a new look for Freddy, Craven and everybody involved decided that the glove should be different. This hand has more muscle and bone texture to it, the blades are shinier and in one case, are retractable. Everything about this glove has a much cleaner look to it, it&#x27;s more a natural part of his hand than a glove.&quot; The new glove has five claws.

In the 2010 remake, the glove is redesigned as a metal gauntlet with four finger bars, but it is patterned after its original design. Owing to this iteration of the character&#x27;s origin as a groundskeeper, from the outset it was a gardener&#x27;s glove modified as an instrument of torture, and in film its blades was based on a garden fork.

Freddy&#x27;s glove appeared in the 1987 horror-comedy &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; above the door on the inside of a toolshed. This was Sam Raimi&#x27;s response to Wes Craven showing footage of &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, which was a response to Raimi putting a poster of Craven&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; in &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;. This, in turn, was a response to a ripped-up &quot;Jaws&quot; poster in &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;. The glove also appears in the 1998 horror-comedy &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot; in an evidence locker room that also contains the remains of the film&#x27;s villain Chucky, the chainsaw of Leatherface from &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, and the masks of Michael Myers from &quot;Halloween&quot; and Jason Voorhees from &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;.

At the end of the film &quot;Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday&quot;, the mask of the title character, Jason Voorhees, played by Kane Hodder, is dragged under the earth by Freddy&#x27;s gloved hand. Freddy&#x27;s gloved hand, in the ending, was played by Hodder.

==In popular culture==
=== Amusement parks ===
At Six Flags St. Louis&#x27; Fright Fest event (then known as Fright Nights), Krueger was the main character for the event&#x27;s first year in 1988. He reappeared in his own haunted house, Freddy&#x27;s Nightmare: The Haunted House on Elm Street, for the following two years. Freddy Krueger appeared alongside Jason Voorhees and Leatherface as minor icons during Halloween Horror Nights 17 and again with Jason during Halloween Horror Nights 25 at Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood. In 2016, Freddy Krueger returned to Halloween Horror Nights, along with Jason, in Hollywood.

===Miscellaneous===
Freddy Krueger made different appearances in &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; voiced by Seth Green. In the episode &quot;That Hurts Me&quot;, Freddy appears as a housemate of &quot;Horror Movie Big Brother&quot;, alongside other famous slasher movie killers such as Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, Leatherface, Pinhead and Ghostface. In the Simpsons episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror VI&quot; segment &quot;A Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace&quot;, Groundskeeper Willie played the Freddy Krueger role, with his backstory being toned down to him accidentally setting himself on fire thanks to Homer turning up the boiler and burning to death due to the parents ignoring his pleas for help, deciding to avenge himself by targeting their kids for their callously letting him burn to death. Krueger ultimately was stopped by Maggie plugging his bagpipe spider form, causing him to uncontrollably inflate and detonate within the dream world, though it is implied in the ending this resulted in him being restored to life in reality, albeit significantly less threatening.

In 1992, Freddy Krueger made an unlicensed appearance in a Belarusian children&#x27;s film titled &quot;&quot;&quot;, or &quot;Keshka i Fredi&quot;&quot;, directed by Boris Berzner. The film focused on the Belarusian youth, Keshka, who is described as being a &quot;...Tom Sawyer successor&quot;, and a &quot;...a pioneer at heart...&quot;, who decides to skip out on his school&#x27;s English lessons to attend a showing of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot; at a cultural center. Falling asleep in the middle of watching the movie, Keshka wakes up in the cultural center alone, being haunted by strange images and sounds from all over. Wandering around the cultural center, Keshka arrives in the basement of the cultural center, where he meets Freddy Krueger when he cuts his way through a film poster to approach the boy. Asking him if he speaks English, Keshka can not answer Freddy correctly, onto which Freddy replies that he will &quot;teach him English&quot;, before chasing the boy throughout the cultural center, threatening to kill him. Eventually backed into a corner by Freddy, Keshka recites the &quot;законы пионеров советского союза&quot; or the &quot;Laws of the Pioneers of the Soviet Union&quot;, like a psalm, while performing a pioneer salute in lieu of a cross. De-powered, 
Krueger falls limp, as Keshka takes a pair of pliers and snaps off each of his glove&#x27;s blades, before filing each one down to a fine stump. Waking up shortly after, Keshka meets up with his friends, holding Krueger&#x27;s hat in his hands, as he decides to devote more time to his studies in English.

Freddy&#x27;s first video game appearance was in the 1989 Commodore 64 game &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, published by Monarch and developed by Westwood Associates, which was followed by the 1990 NES game &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, published by LJN Toys and developed by Rare. Freddy Krueger appeared as a downloadable playable character for &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), with Robert Englund reprising his role. He has become the second non-&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; character to appear in the game. The game depicts Krueger as a malevolent spirit inhabiting the Dream Realm who attacks Shao Kahn for &quot;stealing&quot; the souls of his potential victims. During the fight, he is pulled into the game&#x27;s fictional depiction of the real world. The injured Krueger arms himself with two razor claws to continue to battle Kahn. Upon defeating him, Krueger is sent back to the Dream Realm by Nightwolf, where he continues to haunt the dreams of his human prey. In an interview with PlayStation.Blog, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator Ed Boon cited the character&#x27;s violent nature and iconic status as reasoning for the inclusion in the game, &quot;Over the years, we&#x27;ve certainly had a number of conversations about guest characters. At one point, we had a conversation about having a group—imagine Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, Leatherface from &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;. We never got a grip on how we would do it, whether they&#x27;d be DLC characters or what. We also wanted to introduce a character who was unexpected. This DLC thing opens the doors to realising these ideas.&quot; Krueger went on to become playable in the mobile edition of the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, alongside Jason from &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;.

In October 2017, the Jackie Earle Haley incarnation of Krueger was released as a downloadable playable character in the seventh chapter of the asymmetric survival horror game &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot;, alongside Quentin Smith. The events of the chapter are set immediately following Nancy Holbrook&#x27;s escape from Krueger, after which he targets Quentin Smith as revenge for aiding her. Invading Smith&#x27;s dreams, he forces him to go to the Badham Preschool, where the two are unwittingly taken to the universe of &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot; by an unseen force.

The character returned to television in an episode of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; titled &quot;Mister Knifey-Hands&quot; with Englund reprising his role in a cameo. Freddy Krueger appears as an OASIS avatar in &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. He is among the avatars seen on the PVP location Planet Doom where he is shot by Aech.

The frog species &quot;Lepidobatrachus laevis&quot; had been given multiple nicknames, one of which is the &quot;Freddy Krueger frog&quot; for its aggressive nature.

In 2023, &quot;Firkantus freddykruegeri&quot;, a prehistoric ichneumonid parasitoid wasp, was named after Freddy. The name emphasizes the similar features of the insect and the fictional character—long claws and arolium.

<text>Christian René Marie Joseph, Viscount de Duve (2 October 1917 – 4 May 2013) was a Nobel Prize-winning Belgian cytologist and biochemist. He made serendipitous discoveries of two cell organelles, peroxisomes and lysosomes, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974 with Albert Claude and George E. Palade (&quot;for their discoveries concerning the structural and functional organization of the cell&quot;). In addition to &quot;peroxisome&quot; and &quot;lysosome&quot;, he invented scientific names such as &quot;autophagy&quot;, &quot;endocytosis&quot;, and &quot;exocytosis&quot; on a single occasion.

The son of Belgian refugees during the First World War, de Duve was born in Thames Ditton, Surrey, England. His family returned to Belgium in 1920. He was educated by the Jesuits at Our Lady College, Antwerp, and studied medicine at the Catholic University of Louvain. Upon earning his MD in 1941, he joined research in chemistry, working on insulin and its role in diabetes mellitus. His thesis earned him the highest university degree (equivalent to PhD) in 1945.

With his work on the purification of penicillin, he obtained an MSc degree in 1946. He went for further training under (later Nobel Prize winners) Hugo Theorell at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, and Carl and Gerti Cori at the Washington University in St. Louis. He joined the faculty of medicine at Leuven in 1947. In 1960 he was invited to the Rockfeller Institute (now Rockefeller University). With mutual arrangement with Leuven, he became professor in both universities from 1962, dividing his time between Leuven and New York. In 1974, the same year he received his Nobel Prize, he founded the ICP, which would later be renamed the de Duve Institute. He became emeritus professor of the University of Louvain in 1985, and of Rockefeller in 1988.

De Duve was granted the rank of Viscount in 1989 by King Baudouin of Belgium. He was also a recipient of Francqui Prize, Gairdner Foundation International Award, Heineken Prize, and E.B. Wilson Medal. In 1974, he founded the International Institute of Cellular and Molecular Pathology in Brussels, eventually renamed the de Duve Institute in 2005. He was the founding President of the L&#x27;Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science Awards. He died by legal euthanasia after long suffering from cancer and atrial fibrillation.

==Early life and education==
De Duve was born of an estate agent Alphonse de Duve and wife Madeleine Pungs in the village of Thames Ditton, near London. His parents fled Belgium at the outbreak of the First World War. After the war in 1920, at age three, he and his family returned to Belgium. He was a precocious boy, always the best student (&quot;primus perpetuus&quot; as he recalled) in school, except for one year when he was pronounced &quot;out of competition&quot; to give chance to other students.

He was educated by the Jesuits at Onze-Lieve-Vrouwinstituut in Antwerp, before studying at the Catholic University of Louvain in 1934. He wanted to specialize in endocrinology and joined the laboratory of the Belgian physiologist Joseph P. Bouckaert, whose primary interest was one insulin. During his last year at medical school in 1940, the Germans invaded Belgium. He was drafted to the Belgian army, and posted in southern France as medical officer. There, he was almost immediately taken as prisoner of war by Germans. His ability to speak fluent German and Flemish helped him outwit his captors. He escaped back to Belgium in an adventure he later described as &quot;more comical than heroic&quot;.

He immediately continued his medical course, and obtained his MD in 1941 from Leuven. After graduation, de Duve continued his primary research on insulin and its role in glucose metabolism. He (with Earl Sutherland) made an initial discovery that a commercial preparation of insulin was contaminated with another pancreatic hormone, the insulin antagonist glucagon. However, laboratory supplies at Leuven were in shortage, therefore he enrolled in a programme to earn a degree in chemistry at the Cancer Institute. His research on insulin was summed up in a 400-page book titled &quot;Glucose, Insuline et Diabète&quot; (&quot;Glucose, Insulin and Diabetes&quot;) published in 1945, simultaneously in Brussels and Paris. The book was condensed into a technical dissertation which earned him the most advanced degree at the university level &quot;agrégation de l&#x27;enseignement supérieur&quot; (an equivalent of a doctorate – he called it &quot;a sort of glorified PhD&quot;) in 1945. His thesis was followed by a number of scientific publications. He subsequently obtained a MSc in chemistry in 1946, for which he worked on the purification of penicillin.

To enhance his skill in biochemistry, he trained in the laboratory of Hugo Theorell (who later won The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1955) at the Nobel Medical Institute in Stockholm for 18 months during 1946–47. In 1947, he received a financial assistance as Rockefeller Foundation fellow and worked for six months with Carl and Gerti Cori at Washington University in St. Louis (the husband and wife were joint winners of The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947).

==Career and research==
In March 1947 de Duve joined the faculty of the medical school of the Catholic University of Leuven teaching physiological chemistry. In 1951 he became full professor. In 1960, Detlev Bronk, the then president of the Rockfeller Institute (what is now Rockefeller University) of New York City, met him at Brussels and offered him professorship and a laboratory. The rector of Leuven, afraid of entirely losing de Duve, made a compromise over dinner that de Duve would still be under part-time appointment with a relief from teaching and conducting examinations. The rector and Bronk made an agreement which would initially last for five years. The official implementation was in 1962, and de Duve simultaneously headed the research laboratories at Leuven and at Rockefeller University, dividing his time between New York and Leuven.

In 1969, the Catholic University of Leuven was contentiously split into two separate universities along linguistic lines. De Duve chose to join the French-speaking side, Université catholique de Louvain. He took emeritus status at the University of Louvain in 1985 and at Rockefeller in 1988, though he continued to conduct research. Among other subjects, he studied the distribution of enzymes in rat liver cells using rate-zonal centrifugation. His work on cell fractionation provided an insight into the function of cell structures. He specialized in subcellular biochemistry and cell biology and discovered new cell organelles.

===Rediscovery of glucagon===
The hormone glucagon was discovered by C.P. Kimball and John R. Murlin in 1923 as a hyperglycaemic (blood-sugar elevating) substance among the pancreatic extracts. The biological importance of glucagon was not known and the name itself was essentially forgotten. It was a still a mystery at the time de Duve joined Bouckaert at Leuven University to work on insulin. Since 1921, insulin was the first commercial hormonal drug originally produced by the Eli Lilly and Company, but their extraction methods introduced an impurity that caused mild hyperglycaemia, the very opposite of what was expected or desired. In May 1944 de Duve realised that crystallisation could remove the impurity. He demonstrated that Lilly&#x27;s insulin process was contaminated, showing that, when injected into rats, the Lilly insulin caused initial hyperglycaemia and the Danish Novo insulin did not. Following his research published in 1947, Lilly upgraded its methods to eliminate the impurity. By then de Duve had joined Carl Cori and Gerty Cori at Washington University in St. Louis, where he worked with a fellow researcher Earl Wilbur Sutherland, Jr., who later won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1971.

Sutherland had been working on the puzzle of the insulin-impurity substance, which he had named hyperglycemic-glycogenolytic (HG) factor. He and de Duve soon discovered that the HG factor was synthesised not only by the pancreas but also by the gastric mucosa and certain other parts of the digestive tract. Further, they found that the hormone was produced from pancreatic islets by cells differing from the insulin-producing beta cells; presumably these were alpha cells. It was de Duve who realised that Sutherland&#x27;s HG factor was in fact the same as glucagon; this rediscovery led to its permanent name, which de Duve reintroduced it in 1951. The pair&#x27;s work showed that glucagon was the major hormone influencing the breakdown of glycogen in the liver—the process known as glycogenolysis—by which more sugars are produced and released into the blood.

De Duve&#x27;s original hypothesis that glucagon was produced by pancreatic alpha cells was proven correct when he demonstrated that selectively cobalt-damaged alpha cells stopped producing glucagon in guinea pigs; he finally isolated the purified hormone in 1953, including those from birds.

De Duve was first to hypothesise that the production of insulin (which decreased blood sugar levels), stimulated the uptake of glucose in the liver; he also proposed that a mechanism was in-place to balance the productions of insulin and glucagon in order to maintain normal blood sugar level, (see homeostasis). This idea was much disputed at the time, but his rediscovery of glucagon confirmed his theses. In 1953 he experimentally demonstrated that glucagon did influence the production (and thus the uptake) of glucose.

===Discovery of lysosome===
Christian de Duve and his team continued studying the insulin mechanism-of-action in liver cells, focusing on the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase, the key enzyme in sugar metabolism (glycolysis) and the target of insulin. They found that G6P was the principal enzyme in regulating blood sugar levels, but, they could not, even after repeated experiments, purify and isolate the enzyme from the cellular extracts. So they tried the more laborious procedure of cell fractionation to detect the enzyme activity.

This was the moment of serendipitous discovery. To estimate the exact enzyme activity, the team adopted a procedure using a standardised enzyme acid phosphatase; but they were finding the activity was unexpectedly low—&quot;quite&quot; low, i.e., some 10% of the expected value. Then one day they measured the enzyme activity of some purified cell fractions that had been stored for five days. To their surprise the enzyme activity was increased back to that of the fresh sample; and similar results were replicated every time the procedure was repeated. This led to the hypothesis that some sort of barrier restricted rapid access of the enzyme to its substrate, so that the enzymes were able to diffuse only after a period of time. They described the barrier as membrane-like—a &quot;saclike structure surrounded by a membrane and containing acid phosphatase.&quot;

An unrelated enzyme (of the cell fractionation procedure) had come from membranous fractions that were known to be cell organelles. In 1955, de Duve named them &quot;lysosomes&quot; to reflect their digestive properties. That same year, Alex B. Novikoff from the University of Vermont visited de Duve&#x27;s laboratory, and, using electron microscopy, successfully produced the first visual evidence of the lysosome organelle. Using a staining method for acid phosphatase, de Duve and Novikoff further confirmed the location of the hydrolytic enzymes (acid hydrolases) of lysosomes.

===Discovery of peroxisome===
Serendipity followed de Duve for another major discovery. After the confirmation of lysosome, de Duve&#x27;s team was troubled by the presence (in the rat liver cell fraction) of the enzyme urate oxidase. De Duve thought it was not a lysosome because it is not an acid hydrolase, typical of lysosomal enzymes; still, it had similar distribution as the enzyme acid phosphatase. Further, in 1960 he found other enzymes (such as catalase and D-amino acid oxidase), that were similarly distributed in the cell fraction—and it was then thought that these were mitochondrial enzymes.

Rouillier had described such extra-mitochondrial organelles as microbodies, and believed that they were precursors to mitochondria.) de Duve noted the three enzymes exhibited similar chemical properties and were similar to those of other peroxide-producing oxidases.

De Duve was skeptical of referring to the new-found enzymes as microbodies because, as he noted, &quot;too little is known of their enzyme complement and of their role in the physiology of the liver cells to substantiate a proposal at the present time&quot;. He suggested that these enzymes belonged to the same cell organelle, but one different from previously known organelles. But, as strong evidences were still lacking, he did not publish his hypothesis. In 1955 his team demonstrated similar cell fractions with same biochemical properties from the ciliated protozoan &quot;Tetrahymena pyriformis&quot;; thus, it was indicated that the particles were undescribed cell organelles unrelated to mitochondria. He presented his discovery at a meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology in 1955, and formally published in 1966, creating the name peroxisomes for the organelles as they are involved in peroxidase reactions. In 1968 he achieved the first large-scale preparation of peroxisomes, confirming that l-α hydroxyacid oxidase, d-amino acid oxidase, and catalase were all the unique enzymes of peroxisomes.

De Duve and his team went on to show that peroxisomes play important metabolic roles, including the β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids by a pathway different from that in mitochondria; and that they are members of a large family of evolutionarily related organelles present in diverse cells including plants and protozoa, where they carry out distinct functions. (And have been given specific names, such as glyoxysomes and glycosomes.)

===Origin of cells===

De Duve&#x27;s work has contributed to the emerging consensus towards accepting the endosymbiotic theory; which idea proposes that organelles in eukaryotic cells originated as certain prokaryotic cells that came to live inside eukaryotic cells as endosymbionts. According to de Duve&#x27;s version, eukaryotic cells with their structures and properties, including their ability to capture food by endocytosis and digest it intracellularly, developed first. Later, prokaryotic cells were incorporated to form more organelles.

De Duve proposed that peroxisomes, which allowed cells to withstand the growing amounts of free molecular oxygen in the early-Earth atmosphere, may have been the first endosymbionts. Because peroxisomes have no DNA of their own, this proposal has much less evidence than similar claims for mitochondria and chloroplasts. His later years were mostly devoted to origin of life studies, which he admitted was still a speculative field (see thioester).

==Personal life==
===Religious beliefs===
De Duve was brought up as a Roman Catholic. In his later years he tended towards agnosticism, if not strict atheism. However, de Duve believed that &quot;Most biologists, today, tend to see life and mind as cosmic imperatives, written into the very fabric of the universe, rather than as extraordinarily improbable products of chance.&quot; &quot;It would be an exaggeration to say I&#x27;m not afraid of death&quot;, he explicitly said to a Belgian newspaper &quot;Le Soir&quot; just a month before his death, &quot;but I&#x27;m not afraid of what comes after, because I&#x27;m not a believer.&quot;

He strongly supported biological evolution as a fact, and dismissive of creation science and intelligent design, as explicitly stated in one of his last books, &quot;Genetics of Original Sin: The Impact of Natural Selection on the Future of Humanity&quot; (French original 2009). He was among the seventy-eight Nobel laureates in science to endorse the effort to repeal the Louisiana Science Education Act of 2008.

===Family===
His family (von Duve) came from Hanover and settled in Belgium after the Battle of Waterloo.&lt;br&gt;De Duve married Janine Herman on 30 September 1943. Together they had had two sons, one of whom is noted art professor Thierry de Duve, and two daughters. 

Janine died in 2008, aged 86.

===Death===
De Duve died on 4 May 2013, at his home in Nethen, Belgium, aged 95. He decided to end his life by legal euthanasia, performed by two doctors and in the presence of his four children. He had been long suffering from cancer and atrial fibrillation, and his health problems were exacerbated by a recent fall in his home.

De Duve was cremated as he had willed, and his ashes were distributed among family members and friends.

==Awards and honours==
De Duve won the Francqui Prize for Biological and Medical Sciences in 1960, and the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1974. King Baudouin of Belgium honoured him to Viscount in 1989. He was the recipient of the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1967, and the Dr H.P. Heineken Prize for Biochemistry and Biophysics in 1973 from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

He was elected a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences (United States) in 1975. He won the Harden Medal of the Biochemical Society of Great Britain in 1978; the Theobald Smith Award from the Albany Medical College in 1981; the Jimenez Diaz Award in 1985; the Innovators of Biochemistry Award from Medical College of Virginia in 1986; and the E.B. Wilson Medal in 1989.

He was also a member of the Royal Academies of Medicine and the Royal Academy of Sciences, Arts, and of Literature of Belgium; the Pontifical Academy of Sciences of the Vatican; the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; the French National Academy of Medicine; the Academy of Sciences of Paris; the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina; the American Philosophical Society. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1988. In addition, he received honorary doctorates from eighteen universities around the world.

===Legacy===
De Duve founded a multidisciplinary biomedical research institute at Université catholique de Louvain in 1974, originally named the International Institute of Cellular and Molecular Pathology (ICP). He remained its president until 1991. On his 80th birthday in 1997 it was renamed the Christian de Duve Institute of Cellular Pathology. In 2005 its name was further contracted to simply the de Duve Institute.

De Duve was one of the founding members of the Belgian Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, established on 15 September 1951.

De Duve is remembered as an inventor of important scientific terminology. He coined the word &quot;lysosome&quot; in 1955, &quot;peroxisome&quot; in 1966, and &quot;autophagy&quot;, &quot;endocytosis&quot;, and &quot;exocytosis&quot; in one instance at the &quot;Ciba Foundation Symposium on Lysosomes&quot; held in London during 12–14 February 1963, while he, &quot;was in a word-coining mood.&quot;

De Duve&#x27;s life, including his work resulting in a Nobel Prize, and his passion for biology is the subject of a documentary film &quot;Portrait of a Nobel Prize: Christian de Duve (Portrait de Nobel : Christian de Duve)&quot;, directed by Aurélie Wijnants. It was first aired on Eurochannel in 2012.

<text>Jason Voorhees () is a character from the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; series. He first appeared in &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (1980) as the young son of camp-cook-turned-killer Pamela Voorhees, in which he was portrayed by Ari Lehman. Created by Victor Miller, with contributions by Ron Kurz, Sean S. Cunningham and Tom Savini, Jason was not originally intended to carry the series as the main antagonist. The character has subsequently been represented in various other media, including novels, video games, comic books, and a crossover film with Freddy Krueger.

The character has primarily been an antagonist in the films, whether by stalking and killing the other characters, or acting as a psychological threat to the protagonist, as in the case of &quot;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning&quot;. Since Lehman&#x27;s portrayal, the character has been represented by numerous actors and stuntmen, sometimes by more than one at a time; this has caused some controversy as to who should receive credit for the portrayal. Kane Hodder is the best known of the stuntmen to portray Jason, having played the character in four consecutive films.

The character&#x27;s physical appearance has gone through many transformations, with various special makeup effects artists making their mark on the character&#x27;s design. Tom Savini&#x27;s initial design has been the basis for many of the later incarnations. The trademark hockey mask did not appear until &quot;Friday the 13th Part III&quot;. Since &quot;Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives&quot;, filmmakers have given Jason superhuman strength, regenerative powers, and near invulnerability. Some interpretations suggest that the audience has empathy for Jason, whose motivation for killing has been cited as being driven by the immoral actions of his victims and his own rage over having drowned as a child. Jason has been featured in various humor magazines, referenced in feature films, parodied in television series, and was the inspiration for a horror punk band. Several toy lines have been released based on various versions of the character from the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; films. Jason’s hockey mask is a widely recognized image in popular culture.

== Appearances ==
Jason Voorhees first appears during a nightmare of the main character Alice Hardy (Adrienne King) in the original &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; film; he becomes the main antagonist of the series in its sequels. As well as the films, there have been books and comics that have either expanded the universe of Jason, or been based on a minor aspect of him.

=== Films ===
Jason made his first cinematic appearance in the original &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; on May 9, 1980. In this film, Jason (Ari Lehman) is portrayed in the memories of his mother, Mrs. Voorhees (Betsy Palmer), and as a nightmare of the film&#x27;s protagonist, Alice (Adrienne King). Although not a central character in the original movie, he is still the catalyst of the film&#x27;s plot—Mrs. Voorhees, the main antagonist, seeks revenge for her son&#x27;s drowning, which she blames on the irresponsible camp counselors. Jason&#x27;s second appearance was in the sequel, &quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot; (1981). Revealed to be alive, an adult Jason exacts revenge on Alice for decapitating his mother in the original film. Jason (Steven Dash and Warrington Gillette) returns to Crystal Lake, living there as a hermit and guarding it from all intruders. Five years later a group of teenagers arrive to set up a new camp, only to be murdered one by one by Jason, who wears a sack over his head to hide his face. Ginny (Amy Steel), the lone survivor, finds a makeshift shack in the woods with a shrine built around the severed head of Mrs. Voorhees, and surrounded by corpses. Ginny fights back and slams a machete through Jason&#x27;s shoulder. He is left incapacitated as Ginny is taken away in an ambulance. In &quot;Friday the 13th Part III&quot; (1982), Jason (Richard Brooker) escapes to a nearby lake resort, Higgins Haven, to rest from his wounds. At the same time, Chris Higgins (Dana Kimmell) returns to family property with some acquaintances. An unmasked and reclusive Jason kills anyone who wanders into the barn where he is hiding. Taking a hockey mask from a victim to hide his face, he leaves the barn to kill the rest of the group. Chris fends off Jason by slamming an axe into his head, but the night&#x27;s events drive her into hysteria as the police take her away.

&quot;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&quot; (1984) continues the story, with a presumed-dead Jason (Ted White) found by the police and taken to the morgue. Jason awakens at the morgue and kills the coroner and a nurse, and makes his way back to Crystal Lake. A group of teens renting a house there fall victim to Jason&#x27;s rampage. Jason then seeks out Trish (Kimberly Beck) and Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman) next door. While Trish distracts Jason, Tommy finally kills him with a machete. &quot;Friday the 13th: A New Beginning&quot; (1985) follows Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd), who was committed to a mental hospital after the events of &quot;The Final Chapter&quot;, and has grown up constantly afraid that Jason (Tom Morga) will return. Jason&#x27;s body was supposedly cremated after Tommy killed him. Roy Burns (Dick Wieand) uses Jason&#x27;s persona to become a copycat killer at the halfway home to which Tommy was moved. Jason appears in the film only through Tommy&#x27;s dreams and hallucinations. In &quot;Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives&quot; (1986), Tommy (Thom Mathews), who has run away from a mental institution, visits Jason&#x27;s grave and learns that Jason&#x27;s body was never actually cremated, but buried in a cemetery near Crystal Lake. While attempting to destroy his body, Tommy inadvertently resurrects Jason (C. J. Graham) via a piece of cemetery fence that acts as a lightning rod. Now possessing superhuman abilities, Jason returns to Crystal Lake, renamed Forest Green, and begins his killing spree anew. Tommy eventually lures Jason back to the lake where he drowned as a child and chains him to a boulder on the lake floor, but almost dies in the process. Tommy&#x27;s friend, Megan Garris (Jennifer Cooke), finishes Jason off by cutting his neck with a boat propeller.

&quot;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood&quot; (1988) begins an undisclosed amount of time after &quot;Jason Lives&quot;. Jason (Kane Hodder) is inadvertently freed from his chains by the telekinetic Tina Shepard (Lar Park Lincoln), who was attempting to resurrect her father. Jason begins killing those who occupy Crystal Lake, and after a battle with Tina, is dragged back to the bottom of the lake by an apparition of Tina&#x27;s father. &quot;Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan&quot; (1989) sees Jason return from the grave, brought back to life via an underwater electrical cable. He follows a group of students on their senior class trip to Manhattan, boarding the &quot;Lazarus&quot; to wreak havoc. Upon reaching Manhattan, Jason kills all the survivors but Rennie (Jensen Daggett) and Sean (Scott Reeves); he chases them into the sewers, where he is submerged in toxic waste and dies. In &quot;Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday&quot; (1993), through an unexplained resurrection, he returns to Crystal Lake where he is hunted by the FBI. The FBI sets up a sting to kill Jason, which proves successful. However, through mystical possession, Jason survives by passing his demon-infested heart from one being to the next. Though Jason does not physically appear throughout most of the film, it is learned he has a half-sister and a niece, and that he needs them to retrieve and reinhabit his body. After resurrecting it, Jason is stabbed by his niece Jessica Kimble (Kari Keegan) and dragged into Hell.

&quot;Jason X&quot; (2001) marked Kane Hodder&#x27;s last performance as Jason. The film starts off in 2010; Jason has returned after another unexplained resurrection. Captured by the U.S. government in 2008, Jason is being experimented upon in a research facility, where it has been determined that he has regenerative capabilities and that cryonic suspension is the only possible solution to stop him, since numerous attempts to execute him have proved unsuccessful. Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices through the cryo-chamber, spilling cryonics fluid into the room, freezing himself and the only other survivor, Rowan (Lexa Doig). A team of students 445 years later discover Jason&#x27;s body. On the team&#x27;s spacecraft, Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing the crew. Along the way, he is enhanced by a regenerative nanotechnology process, which gives him an impenetrable metal body. Finally, he is ejected into space and falls to the planet Earth Two, incinerated in the atmosphere.

&quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; (2003) is a crossover film in which Jason battles &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;&#x27;s villain Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), a supernatural killer who murders people in their dreams. Krueger has grown weak, as people in his home town of Springwood have suppressed their fear of him. Freddy, who is impersonating Jason&#x27;s mother (Paula Shaw), resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) from Hell and sends him to Springwood to cause panic and fear. Jason accomplishes this, but refuses to stop killing. A battle ensues in both the dream world and Crystal Lake. The identity of the winner is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy&#x27;s severed head, which winks and laughs.

In the 2009 &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; reboot, young Jason (Caleb Guss) witnesses his mother&#x27;s (Nana Visitor) beheading as a child and follows in her footsteps, killing anyone who comes to Crystal Lake. The adult Jason (Derek Mears) kidnaps Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti), a girl who looks like his mother, and holds her prisoner in his tunnels. Months later, Whitney&#x27;s brother Clay (Jared Padalecki) comes to Crystal Lake and rescues her. Eventually, Whitney uses Jason&#x27;s devotion to his mother against him, stabbing him with his own machete while he is distracted when she appears. When his body is dumped into the lake, Jason emerges from the water to grab Whitney and their fates are left unknown.

=== Literature ===
Jason first appeared outside of film in the 1982 novelization of &quot;Friday the 13th Part 3&quot; by Michael Avallone. Avallone chose to use an alternate ending, which was filmed for &quot;Part 3&quot; but never used, as the ending for his 1982 adaptation. In the alternate film ending, Chris, who is in the canoe, hears Rick&#x27;s voice and immediately rushes back to the house. When she opens the door, Jason is standing there with a machete, and he decapitates her. Jason next appears in print in the 1986 novelization of &quot;Jason Lives&quot; by Simon Hawke, who also adapted the first three films in 1987 and 1988. &quot;Jason Lives&quot; specifically introduced Elias Voorhees, Jason&#x27;s father, a character who was slated to appear in the film but was cut by the studio. In the novel, instead of being cremated, Elias has Jason buried after his death.

Jason made his comic book debut in the 1993 adaptation of &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot;, written by Andy Mangels. The three-issue series was a condensed version of the film, with a few added scenes that were never shot. Jason made his first appearance outside of the direct adaptations in &quot;Satan&#x27;s Six&quot; No. 4, published in 1993, which is a continuation of the events of &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot;. In 1995, Nancy A. Collins wrote a three-issue, non-canonical miniseries involving a crossover between Jason and Leatherface. The story involves Jason stowing away aboard a train, after being released from Crystal Lake when the area is drained due to heavy toxic-waste dumping. Jason meets Leatherface, who adopts him into his family after the two become friends. Eventually they turn on each other. In 1994, four young adult novels were released under the title of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;. They did not feature Jason explicitly, but revolve around people becoming possessed by Jason when they put on his mask.

In 2003 and 2005, Black Flame published novelizations of &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; and &quot;Jason X&quot; respectively. In 2005, they began publishing a new series of novels; one set was published under the &quot;Jason X&quot; title, while the second set utilized the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; title. The &quot;Jason X&quot; series consisted of four sequels to the novelization of the film. &quot;Jason X: The Experiment&quot; was the first published. In this novel, Jason is being used by the government, who are trying to use his indestructibility to create their own army of &quot;super-soldiers&quot;. &quot;Planet of the Beast&quot; follows the efforts of Dr. Bardox and his crew as they try to clone the body of a comatose Jason, and shows their efforts to stay alive when Jason wakes from his coma. &quot;Death Moon&quot; revolves around Jason crash-landing at Moon Camp Americana. Jason is discovered below a prison site and unknowingly awakened in &quot;To the Third Power&quot;. Jason has a son in this book, conceived through a form of artificial insemination.

On May 13, 2005, Avatar Press began releasing new &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; comics. The first, titled &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, was written by Brian Pulido and illustrated by Mike Wolfer and Greg Waller. The story takes place after the events of &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, where siblings Miles and Laura Upland have inherited Camp Crystal Lake. Knowing that Jason caused the recent destruction, Laura, unknown to her brother, sets out to kill Jason using a paramilitary group, so that she and her brother can sell the property. A three-issue miniseries titled &quot;Friday the 13th: Bloodbath&quot; was released in September 2005. Written by Brian Pulido and illustrated by Mike Wolfer and Andrew Dalhouse, the story involves a group of teenagers who come from Camp Tomorrow, a camp that sits on Crystal Lake, for work and a &quot;party-filled weekend&quot;. The teenagers discover they share common family backgrounds, and soon awaken Jason, who hunts them. Brian Pulido returned for a third time in October 2005 to write &quot;Jason X&quot;. Picking up after the events of the &quot;Jason X&quot; film, Über-Jason is now on Earth II where a biological engineer, Kristen, attempts to subdue Jason, in hopes that she can use his regenerative tissue to save her own life and the lives of those she loves. In February 2006, Avatar published &quot;Friday the 13th: Jason vs. Jason X&quot;. Written and illustrated by Mike Wolfer, the story takes place after the events of the film &quot;Jason X&quot;. A salvage team discovers the spaceship Grendel and awakens a regenerated Jason Voorhees. The &quot;original&quot; Jason and Über-Jason are drawn to each other, resulting in a battle to the death. In June 2006, a one-shot comic entitled &quot;Friday the 13th: Fearbook&quot; was released, written by Mike Wolfer with art by Sebastian Fiumara. The comic has Jason being captured and experimented upon by the Trent Organization; Jason escapes and seeks out Violet, the survivor of &quot;Friday the 13th: Bloodbath&quot;, who is being contained by the Trent Organization in their Crystal Lake headquarters.

The &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; novella storyline was not connected to the &quot;Jason X&quot; series, and did not continue the stories set forth by the films, but furthered the character of Jason in its own way. &quot;Friday the 13th: Church of the Divine Psychopath&quot; has Jason resurrected by a religious cult. Jason is stuck in Hell, when recently executed serial killer Wayne Sanchez persuades Jason to help him return to Earth in &quot;Friday the 13th: Hell Lake&quot;. In &quot;Hate-Kill-Repeat&quot;, two religious serial killers attempt to find Jason at Crystal Lake, believing that the three of them share the same contempt for those that break the moral code. In &quot;The Jason Strain&quot;, Jason is on an island with a group of convicts placed there by television executives running a reality game show. The character of Pamela Voorhees returns from the grave in &quot;Carnival of Maniacs&quot;. Pamela is in search of Jason, who is now part of a traveling sideshow and about to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.

In December 2006, DC Comics imprint Wildstorm began publishing new comic books about Jason Voorhees under the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; moniker. The first set was a six-issue miniseries involving Jason&#x27;s return to Camp Crystal Lake, which is being renovated by a group of teenagers in preparation for its reopening as a tourist attraction. The series depicts various paranormal phenomena occurring at Crystal Lake. Jason&#x27;s actions in this storyline are driven by the vengeful spirits of a Native American tribe wiped out on the lake by fur traders sometime in the 19th century. On July 11 and August 15, 2007, Wildstorm published a two-part special entitled &quot;Friday the 13th: Pamela&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The two-issue comic book covers Pamela Voorhees&#x27; journey to Camp Crystal Lake and the story of her pregnancy with Jason as she recounts it to hitchhiker Annie, a camp counselor who was killed in the original film. Wildstorm released another two-part special, entitled &quot;Friday the 13th: How I Spent My Summer Vacation&quot;, that was released on September 12 and October 10, 2007. The comic book provides new insight into the psychology of Jason Voorhees as he befriends a boy born with a skull deformity. Wildstorm released a six-issue series called &quot;Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash&quot;, starring the two killers and Ash from the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; series. In this story, Freddy uses the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, which is in the Voorhees&#x27; basement, to escape from Jason&#x27;s subconscious and &quot;gain powers unlike anything he&#x27;s had before&quot;. Freddy attempts to use Jason to retrieve the book, stating it will make him a real boy. Ash, who is working at the local S-Mart in Crystal Lake, learns of the book&#x27;s existence and sets out to destroy it. Wildstorm released another two-issue miniseries on January 9 and February 13, 2008, titled &quot;Friday the 13th: Bad Land&quot;, written and illustrated by Ron Marz and Mike Huddleston respectively. The miniseries features Jason stalking a trio of teenaged hikers taking shelter from a blizzard in Camp Crystal Lake.

A sequel to &quot;Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash&quot;, subtitled &quot;The Nightmare Warriors&quot;, was released by Wildstorm in 2009. Jason escapes from the bottom of Crystal Lake to resume his hunt for Ash, but is captured by the U.S. government. Freddy helps him escape and appoints him the general of his Deadite army, using the &quot;Necronomicon&quot; to heal his accumulated injuries and decomposition; it removes his natural deformities in the process. At the climax of the story, Jason battles his nemesis Tommy Jarvis and his great-niece Stephanie Kimble; Stephanie impales him before Tommy decapitates him with a shard of glass. Jason&#x27;s soul is then absorbed by Freddy, who uses it to increase his own power.

===Other appearances===
Jason has made an appearance in five video games. He first appeared in &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, a 1985 Commodore 64 game. His next appearance was in 1989, when LJN, an American game company known for its games based on popular movies in the 1980s and early 1990s, released &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The premise involved the gamer, who picks one of six camp counselors as their player, trying to save the campers from Jason, while battling various enemies throughout the game. On October 13, 2006, a &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; game was released for mobile phones. The game puts the user in the persona of Jason as he battles the undead. Jason also appears as a playable character in the fighting game &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; as a downloadable content bonus character. A new &quot;Friday the 13th video game&quot; was released in 2017, which allows players to take control of Jason or camp counselors in a multiplayer format focused on Jason trying to kill the counselors before they can escape or time runs out. Jason is also playable in the fighting game &quot;MultiVersus&quot;.

== Concept and creation ==

Initially created by Victor Miller, Jason&#x27;s final design was a combined effort by Miller, Ron Kurz, and Tom Savini. The name &quot;Jason&quot; is a combination of &quot;Josh&quot; and &quot;Ian&quot;, Miller&#x27;s two sons, and &quot;Voorhees&quot; was inspired by a girl that Miller knew at high school whose last name was Voorhees. Miller felt it was a &quot;creepy-sounding name&quot;, which was perfect for his character. Miller initially wrote Jason as a normal-looking child, but the crew behind the film decided he needed to be deformed. Victor Miller explained Jason was not meant to be a creature from the &quot;Black Lagoon&quot; in his script, and scripted Jason as a mentally disabled young boy; it was Savini who made Jason deformed. Ron Kurz confirmed that Miller&#x27;s version of Jason was that of a normal child, but claims that it was his idea to turn Jason into a &quot;mongoloid creature&quot;, and have him &quot;jump out of the lake at the end of the film&quot;. Miller later agreed the ending would not have been as good if he looked like &quot;Betsy Palmer at eight years old&quot;. Miller wrote a scene where Alice dreams she is attacked in a canoe by Jason, and then she wakes up in a hospital bed. Miller&#x27;s intention was to get as close to &quot;Carrie&quot;″s ending as possible. Savini believed having Jason pop out of the lake would be psychologically disturbing to the audience, and since Alice is supposed to be dreaming, the crew could get away with adding anything they wanted.

When it came time to cast the role of Jason, Ari Lehman, who had received a part in Sean Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;Manny&#x27;s Orphans&quot;, arrived to read for the character of Jack. Before he could get started, Cunningham walked in and offered him a different part: Jason. Without having read a single word, Cunningham just looked at Ari and said, &quot;You&#x27;re the right size, you&#x27;ve got it.&quot; In the original &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, Ari Lehman is seen only in a brief flashback as the surprise ending. Subsequent actors who portrayed a young Jason include Timothy Burr Mirkovich in &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot; and Spencer Stump in &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;. The adult role of Jason Voorhees has been played by various actors, some not credited, others taking great pride in their parts. Due to the physical demands the adult character requires, and the lack of emotional depth depicted, many of the actors since have been stuntmen. The most well known among them is Kane Hodder, who is cited as the best to play the role.

Many ideas were suggested for the sequel to &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, including making the title part of a serialized film series, where each succeeding film would be its own story and not related to any previous film under the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; moniker. It was Phil Scuderi, one of the producers for the original film, who suggested bringing Jason back for the sequel. The director Steve Miner felt it was the obvious direction to take the series, as he felt the audience wanted to know more about the child who attacked Alice in the lake. Miner decided to pretend as if Alice did not see the &quot;real Jason&quot; in her dream, and Jason had survived his drowning as a boy and had grown up. After killing Jason in &quot;The Final Chapter&quot;, it was the director Joseph Zito&#x27;s intention to leave the door open for the studio to make more films with Tommy Jarvis as the main antagonist. Screenwriter Barney Cohen felt Jarvis would become a substitute for Jason, but the idea was never fully developed in &quot;A New Beginning&quot;. Director and co-screenwriter Danny Steinmann disliked the idea of Jason not being the killer, but decided to use Tommy&#x27;s fear of Jason as the primary story. This idea was immediately abandoned in &quot;Jason Lives&quot;, when &quot;A New Beginning&quot; did not spark the &quot;creative success&quot; the studio was looking for. Executive producer Frank Mancuso Jr. wanted to bring Jason back, and he did not care how it was achieved. In yet another alteration of the series&#x27; continuity, Tom McLoughlin chose to ignore the idea that Jason had survived his drowning, instead presenting him as always having been some sort of supernatural force. Since &quot;A New Beginning&quot;, no sequel has attempted to replace Jason as the main antagonist. Miller, who has not seen any of the sequels, took issue with all of them because they made Jason the villain. Miller believes the best part of his screenplay was that it was about a mother avenging the senseless death of her son. Miller stated, &quot;Jason was dead from the very beginning; he was a victim, not a villain.&quot;

=== Men under the mask ===
Jason Voorhees went from deceased child to full-grown man for &quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot;, and Warrington Gillette was hired to play the role. Gillette auditioned for the role of Paul; that role eventually went to John Furey. Under the belief that he had attended the Hollywood Stuntman&#x27;s School, Gillette was offered the role of Jason Voorhees. Initially Gillette was unsure about the character, but the idea of starring in his first film grew on Gillette, and he also thought the role was amusing. It became apparent Gillette could not perform the necessary stunts, so the stunt coordinator Cliff Cudney brought in Steve Daskawisz. Daskawisz filmed all of the scenes except the opening sequence and the unmasking shot at the end; Gillette returned for the unmasking scenes. Gillette received credit for playing Jason, while Daskawisz was given credit as the stunt double. When &quot;Part 3&quot; was released the following year, Daskawisz was credited as Jason for the reused footage from the climax of the film. Initially, Daskawisz was asked to return to the role for &quot;Part 3&quot;, but it would have required him to pay for his own transportation and housing during filming. Having secured a part on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, Daskawisz declined.

Now wanting a &quot;bigger and stronger-looking&quot; Jason, one that was also &quot;more athletic and powerful&quot;, Steve Miner hired former British trapeze artist Richard Brooker. After a conversation, Miner decided he was the right person for the job. Being new to the country, Brooker believed that &quot;playing a psychopathic killer&quot; was the best way into the movie business. Brooker became the first actor to wear Jason&#x27;s now-signature hockey mask. According to Brooker, &quot;It felt great with the mask on. It just felt like I really was Jason because I didn&#x27;t have anything to wear before that.&quot; For &quot;The Final Chapter&quot;, Joseph Zito brought his own spin to the character, one that required a &quot;real hardcore stuntman&quot;; Ted White was hired to perform the role. White, who only took the job for the money, did &quot;get into the Jason psychology&quot; when he arrived on the set. White went so far as to not speak to any of the other actors for long stretches. As filming continued, White&#x27;s experience was not pleasant, and in one instance, he went to battle for co-star Judie Aronson, who played Samantha, when the director kept her naked in the lake for extended periods of time. Displeased with his experience from filming, White had his name removed from the credits. As with &quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot;, there was confusion over who performed the role in &quot;A New Beginning&quot;, partly because Jason is not the literal antagonist in the film. When Ted White turned down the opportunity to return, Dick Wieand was cast. Wieand is credited as Roy Burns, the film&#x27;s actual murderer, but it was stuntman Tom Morga who performed in the few flashes of Jason, as well as portraying Roy in almost all of the masked scenes. Wieand has been outspoken about his lack of enthusiasm over his role in the film. Feeling alienated during the shoot, Wieand spent most of his time in his trailer. By comparison, Morga enjoyed his time as Jason and made sure he &quot;really got into the character&quot;.

A nightclub manager in Glendale, C. J. Graham, was interviewed for the role of Jason in &quot;Jason Lives&quot;, but was initially passed over because he had no experience as a stuntman. Dan Bradley was hired, but Paramount executives felt Bradley did not have the right physique to play the role, and Graham was hired to replace him. Although Bradley was replaced early during filming, he can be seen in the paintball sequence of the film. Graham opted to perform most of his own stunts, including the scene where Jason catches on fire while battling Tommy in the lake. The rest of the cast spoke highly of Graham, remarking that he never complained during all the uncomfortable situations he was placed in. Graham had no intention of being an actor or a stuntman, but the idea of playing the &quot;bad guy&quot;, and the opportunity to wear the prosthetics, intrigued him. Graham was not brought back to reprise the role, but has often been cited as speaking highly of his time in the part.

Kane Hodder took over the role in &quot;The New Blood&quot;, and played Jason in the next four films. He previously worked alongside director John Carl Buechler on a film called &quot;Prison&quot;. Based on his experience working with Hodder, Buechler petitioned Frank Mancuso Jr. to hire him, but Mancuso was apprehensive about Hodder&#x27;s limited size. Knowing he planned to use full body prosthetics, Buechler scheduled a test screening, the first in &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; history for the character, and Mancuso immediately gave Hodder approval upon seeing him. It is Buechler&#x27;s contention that Hodder gave Jason his first true personality, based on the emotions, specifically the rage, that Hodder would emit while acting the part. According to Hodder, he wanted to &quot;get in touch with Jason&#x27;s thirst for revenge&quot; and try to better understand his motivation to kill. After viewing the previous films, Hodder decided that he would approach Jason as a more &quot;quick and agile&quot; individual than he had been portrayed in the previous sequels. John Carl Buechler felt that Kane had &quot;natural affinity for the role&quot;—so much that Kane&#x27;s appearance, when wearing the mask, would often terrify the cast, the crew, and in one incident a lone stranger that he came across on his walk back to his trailer. Initially Frank Mancuso Jr. and Barbara Sachs planned to use a Canadian stuntperson for &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;. Hodder acted as his own voice, calling and requesting that he be allowed to reprise the role; the ultimate decision was left to director Rob Hedden, who intended to use Hodder, because he felt Hodder knew the lore of the series. With Sean Cunningham&#x27;s return as producer for &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot;, Hodder felt his chances of reprising the role were even better: Hodder had worked as Cunningham&#x27;s stunt coordinator for years. Regardless, Adam Marcus, the director for &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot;, always intended to hire Hodder for the role. &quot;Jason X&quot; would mark Hodder&#x27;s last performance as Jason, to date. Todd Farmer, who wrote the screenplay for &quot;Jason X&quot;, knew that Hodder would play Jason from the beginning. Jim Isaac was a fan of Hodder&#x27;s work on the previous films, so hiring him was an easy decision.

New Line believed &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; needed a fresh start, and choose a new actor for Jason. Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing Hodder was the best choice for the role. Hodder did receive the script for &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, and had a meeting with director Ronny Yu and New Line executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu&#x27;s image of Jason. According to Hodder, New Line failed to provide him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films. Yu and development executive Jeff Katz recognized the outcry among fans over the replacement of Hodder as Jason, but stood by their choice in recasting.

The role eventually went to Ken Kirzinger, a Canadian stuntman who worked on &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;. There are conflicting reports over the reason Kirzinger was cast. According to Yu, Kirzinger was hired because he was taller than Robert Englund, the actor who portrays Freddy Krueger. Kirzinger stands , compared to the of Kane Hodder, and Yu wanted a much larger actor to tower over the Englund. Kirzinger believes his experience on &quot;Part VIII&quot; helped him land the part, as Kirzinger doubled for Hodder on two scenes for the film, but also believes he was simply sized up and handed the job. Although he was hired by the creative crew, New Line did not officially cast Kirzinger until first seeing him on film. Kirzinger&#x27;s first scene was Jason walking down Elm Street. New Line wanted a specific movement in Jason&#x27;s walk; Kirzinger met their expectations and signed a contract with the studio. However, concerns that test audiences were confused by the film&#x27;s original ending caused the studio to reshoot the final scene. Actor Douglas Tait was brought in to film the new ending, as he was available for the reshoot and had been the production&#x27;s second choice to portray the role of Jason during the original casting.

For the 2009 remake, stuntman Derek Mears was hired to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Mears&#x27;s pleasant demeanor had the studio worried about his ability to portray such a menacing character on screen, but Mears assured them he would be able to perform the role. When Mears auditioned for the role he was asked why they should hire an actor over just another guy in a mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to Greek mask work, where the mask and the actor are two separate entities, and, based on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance.

=== Design ===
The physical design of Jason Voorhees has gone through changes, some subtle and some radical. For &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, the task of coming up with Jason&#x27;s appearance was the responsibility of Tom Savini, whose design for Jason was inspired by someone Savini knew as a child whose eyes and ears did not line up straight. The original design called for Jason to have hair, but Savini and his crew opted to make him bald, so he would look like a &quot;hydrocephalic, mongoloid pinhead&quot;, with a dome-shaped head. Savini created a plaster mold of Ari Lehman&#x27;s head and used that to create prosthetics for his face. Lehman personally placed mud—from the bottom of the lake—all over his body to make himself appear &quot;really slimy.&quot;

For &quot;Part 2&quot;, Steve Miner asked Carl Fullerton, the make-up effects supervisor, to stick to Savini&#x27;s original design, but Fullerton only had one day to design and sculpt a new head. Fullerton drew a rough sketch of what he believed Jason should look like, and had it approved by Miner. Fullerton added long hair to the character. Gillette had to spend hours in a chair as they applied rubber forms all over his face, and had to keep one eye closed while the &quot;droopy eye&quot; application was in place. Gillette&#x27;s eye was closed for twelve hours at a time while he was filming the final scenes of the film. False teeth created by a local dentist were used to distort Gillette&#x27;s face. Much of the basic concept of Fullerton&#x27;s design was eliminated for &quot;Part 3&quot;. Miner wanted to use a combination of the designs from Tom Savini and Carl Fullerton, but as work progressed the design began to lean more and more toward Savini&#x27;s concept. Stan Winston was hired to create a design for Jason&#x27;s head, but the eyes were level and Doug White, the make-up artist for &quot;Part 3&quot;, needed a droopy right eye. White did keep Winston&#x27;s design for the back of the head, because the crew did not have the time to design an entirely new head for Jason. The process of creating Jason&#x27;s look was hard work for White, who had to constantly make alterations to Richard Brooker&#x27;s face, even up to the last day of filming.
The script for &quot;Part 3&quot; called for Jason to wear a mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in &quot;Part 2&quot;; what no one knew at the time was that the mask chosen would become a trademark for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film&#x27;s 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff&#x27;s mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker&#x27;s face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker&#x27;s head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.

Tom Savini agreed to return to make-up duties for &quot;The Final Chapter&quot; because he felt he should be the one to bring Jason full circle in terms of his look from child to man. Savini used his design from the original &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White&#x27;s face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in &quot;A New Beginning&quot;, it was not necessary to do any major designing for Jason&#x27;s look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites &quot;A New Beginning&quot; as almost a direct sequel to &quot;The Final Chapter&quot;, did base his head-mask on Tom Savini&#x27;s design for &quot;The Final Chapter&quot;.

&quot;Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood&quot; sought to make Jason more of a &quot;classic monster along the lines of Frankenstein.&quot; From the beginning, Buechler tried to tie the previous films together by having Jason&#x27;s appearance reflect that of the damage he received in the previous installments. Buechler wanted the motor boat damage from &quot;Jason Lives&quot;, and the axe and machete cuts Jason received in &quot;Part 3&quot; and &quot;Part 4&quot; to part of the design for &quot;The New Blood&quot;. Since Jason had been submerged under water in the previous entry, the effects team wanted Jason to appear &quot;rotted&quot;, with bones and ribs showing, and for Jason&#x27;s features to have a more defined feel to them. Howard Berger was inspired by Carl Fullerton&#x27;s design in &quot;The New Blood&quot;, and wanted to incorporate the exposed flesh concept into his model for &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot;. Berger designed Jason&#x27;s skin to overlap with the mask, to make it appear as if the skin and mask had fused and the mask could no longer be removed. Gregory Nicotero and Berger sculpted a full-body, foam latex suit for Kane Hodder to wear under the costume. The idea was to reveal as much of Jason&#x27;s skin as possible, because Nicotero and Berger knew the physical character would not be seen for most of the film.
Stephan Dupuis was given the task of redesigning Jason for the tenth &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; film. One concept brought into the film was Jason&#x27;s regenerative abilities. Dupuis gave the character more hair and more of a natural flesh appearance to illustrate the constant regeneration the character goes through; Dupuis wanted a more &quot;gothic&quot; design for Jason, so he added chains and shackles, and made the hockey mask more angular. Jim Isaac and the rest of his crew wanted to create an entirely new Jason at some point in the film. The idea was for the teens to completely destroy Jason&#x27;s body, allowing the futuristic technology to bring him back to life. What was referred to as Über-Jason was designed to have chunks of metal growing from his body, bonded by tendrils that grew into the metal, all pushing through a leather suit. The metal was created from VacuForm, the same material used to increase the size of the original hockey mask, and was attached by Velcro. The tendrils were made from silicone. All of the pieces were crafted onto one suit, including an entire head piece, which Hodder wore. The make-up effects team added zippers along the side of the suit, which allowed Hodder to enter and exit the suit within 15 minutes.

By the time &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; entered production there had been ten previous &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; films. Make-up effects artist Terezakis wanted to put his own mark on Jason&#x27;s look—he wanted Jason to be less rotted and decomposed and more defined, so that the audience would see a new Jason, but still recognized the face. Terezakis tried to keep continuity with the previous films, but recognized that had he followed them too literally, then &quot;Jason would have been reduced to a pile of goo.&quot; Ronny Yu wanted everything surrounding the hockey mask to act as a frame, making the mask the focal point of each shot. To achieve this, Terezakis created a &quot;pooled-blood look&quot; for the character by painting the skin black, based on the idea the blood had pooled in the back of his head because he had been lying on his back for a long time. As with other make-up artists before him, Terezakis followed Savini&#x27;s original skull design, and aged it appropriately.

For the 2009 version of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, effects artist Scott Stoddard took inspiration from Carl Fullerton&#x27;s design in &quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot; and Tom Savini&#x27;s work in &quot;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&quot;. Stoddard wanted to make sure that Jason appeared human and not like a monster. Stoddard&#x27;s vision of Jason includes hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face, but he attempted to craft Jason&#x27;s look in a way that would allow for a more human side to be seen. Stoddard took inspiration from the third and fourth films when designing Jason&#x27;s hockey mask. The make-up artist managed to acquire an original set piece, which he studied and later sculpted. Although he had a model of one of the original masks, Stoddard did not want to replicate it in its entirety. As Stoddard explains, &quot;Because I didn&#x27;t want to take something that already existed, there were things I thought were great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit, break them up.&quot; In the end, Stoddard crafted six versions of the mask, each with varying degrees of wear.

== Characteristics ==
In his original appearance, Jason was scripted as a mentally disabled young boy. Since &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, Jason Voorhees has been depicted as a non-verbal, indestructible, machete-wielding mass murderer. Jason is primarily portrayed as being completely silent throughout the film series. Exceptions to this include in &quot;Part III&quot; when he grunts in pain several times when final girl Chris manages to stab him (once in the hand and once just above his knee), flashbacks of Jason as a child, a brief scene in &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot; where the character cries out &quot;Mommy, please don&#x27;t let me drown!&quot; in a child&#x27;s voice before being submerged in toxic waste, and in &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot; where his spirit possesses other individuals. Online magazine &quot;Salon&quot;″s Andrew O&#x27;Hehir describes Jason as a &quot;silent, expressionless...blank slate.&quot; When discussing Jason psychologically, Sean S. Cunningham said, &quot;...he doesn&#x27;t have any personality. He&#x27;s like a great white shark. You can&#x27;t really defeat him. All you can hope for is to survive.&quot; Since &quot;Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives&quot;, Jason has been a &quot;virtually indestructible&quot; being. Tom McLoughlin, the film&#x27;s director, felt it was silly that Jason had previously been just another guy in a mask, who would kill people left and right, but get &quot;beaten up and knocked down by the heroine at the end&quot;. McLoughlin wanted Jason to be more of a &quot;formidable, unstoppable monster&quot;. In resurrecting Jason from the dead, McLoughlin also gave him the weakness of being rendered helpless if trapped beneath the waters of Crystal Lake; inspired by vampire lore, McLoughlin decided that Jason had in fact drowned as a child, and that returning him to his original resting place would immobilize him. This weakness would be presented again in &quot;The New Blood&quot;, and the idea that Jason had drowned as a child was taken up by director Rob Hedden as a plot element in &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;.

Many have given suggestions as Jason&#x27;s motivation for killing. Ken Kirzinger refers to Jason as a &quot;psychotic mama&#x27;s boy gone horribly awry...very resilient. You can&#x27;t kill him, but he feels pain, just not like everyone else.&quot; Kirzinger goes on to say that Jason is a &quot;psycho-savant&quot;, and believes his actions are based on pleasing his mother, and not anything personal. Andrew O&#x27;Hehir has stated, &quot;Coursing hormones act, of course, as smelling salts to prudish Jason, that ever-vigilant enforcer of William Bennett-style values.&quot; Todd Farmer, writer for &quot;Jason X&quot;, wrote the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic hibernation just as two of the teenagers are having sex. Farmer liked the idea that sex acts triggered Jason back to life. Whatever his motivations, Kane Hodder believes there is a limit to what he will do. According to Hodder, Jason might violently murder any person he comes across, but when &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot; called for Hodder to kick the lead character&#x27;s dog, Hodder refused, stating that, while Jason has no qualms against killing humans, he is not bad enough to hurt animals. Another example from &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;, involves Jason being confronted by a street gang of young teenage boys one of whom threatens him with a knife, however Jason chooses not to kill them and instead scares them off by lifting up his mask and showing them his face. Likewise, director Tom McLoughlin chose not to have Jason harm any of the children he encounters in &quot;Jason Lives,&quot; stating that Jason would not kill a child, out of a sympathy for the plight of children generated by his own death as a child.

In &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot;, director Adam Marcus decided to include a copy of the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, from the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; franchise, in the Voorhees home as a way to insinuate that Jason was actually a &quot;Deadite&quot;, a type of demonic being from that series. Marcus stated the book&#x27;s placement was intended to imply that Pamela Voorhees had used it to resurrect Jason after his childhood drowning, resulting in his supernatural abilities: &quot;This is why Jason isn&#x27;t Jason. He&#x27;s Jason plus &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;... That, to me, is way more interesting as a mashup, and [Sam] Raimi loved it! It&#x27;s not like I could tell New Line my plan to include &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;, because they don&#x27;t own &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;. So it had to be an Easter egg, and I did focus on it. It absolutely is canon.&quot; In an early draft of &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, it was decided that one of the villains needed a redeemable factor. Ronald D. Moore, co-writer of the first draft, explained that Jason was the easiest to make redeemable, because no one had previously ventured into the psychology surrounding the character. Moore saw the character as a &quot;blank slate&quot;, and felt he was a character the audience could really root for. Another draft, penned by Mark Protosevich, followed Moore&#x27;s idea of Jason having a redeemable quality. In the draft, Jason protects a pregnant teenager named Rachel Daniels. Protosevich explained, &quot;It gets into this whole idea of there being two kinds of monsters. Freddy is a figure of actual pure evil and Jason is more like a figure of vengeance who punishes people he feels do not deserve to live. Ultimately, the two of them clash and Jason becomes an honorable monster.&quot; Writers Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, who wrote the final draft of the film, disagreed about making Jason a hero, although they drew comparisons between the fact that Freddy was a victimizer and Jason was a victim. They stated, &quot;We did not want to make Jason any less scary. He&#x27;s still a brutal killer ... We never wanted to put them in a situation where Jason is a hero ... They&#x27;re both villains to be equally feared.&quot; Brenna O&#x27;Brien, co-founder of Fridaythe13thfilms.com, saw the character as having sympathetic qualities. She stated, &quot;[Jason] was a deformed child who almost drowned and then spent the rest of his childhood growing up alone in the woods. He saw his mother get murdered by a camp counselor in the first &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, and so now he exacts his revenge on anyone who returns to Camp Crystal Lake. Teenage fans can identify with that sense of rejection and isolation, which you can&#x27;t really get from other killers like Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers.&quot;

As Jason went through some characterization changes in the 2009 film, Derek Mears likens him more to a combination of John Rambo, Tarzan, and the Abominable Snowman from &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;. To him, this Jason is similar to Rambo because he sets up the other characters to fall into his traps. Like Rambo, he is more calculated because he feels that he has been wronged and he is fighting back; he is meant to be more sympathetic in this film. Fuller and Form contend that they did not want to make Jason too sympathetic to the audience. As Brad Fuller explains, &quot;We do not want him to be sympathetic. Jason is not a comedic character, he is not sympathetic. He&#x27;s a killing machine. Plain and simple.&quot;

In 2005, California State University&#x27;s Media Psychology Lab surveyed 1,166 people Americans aged from 16 to 91 on the psychological appeal of movie monsters. Many of the characteristics associated with Jason Voorhees were appealing to the participants. In the survey, Jason was considered to be an &quot;unstoppable killing machine.&quot; Participants were impressed by the &quot;cornucopic feats of slicing and dicing a seemingly endless number of adolescents and the occasional adult.&quot; Out of the ten monsters used in the survey—which included vampires, Freddy Krueger, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, Michael Myers, Godzilla, Chucky, Hannibal Lecter, King Kong and the Alien—Jason scored the highest in all the categories involving killing variables. Further characteristics that appealed to the participants included Jason&#x27;s &quot;immortality, his apparent enjoyment of killing [and] his superhuman strength.&quot;

== Reception ==


===Popularity===
Jason Voorhees is one of the leading cultural icons of American popular culture. In 1992 Jason was awarded the MTV Lifetime Achievement Award. He was the first of only three completely fictional characters to be presented the award; Godzilla (1996) and Chewbacca (1997) are the others. Jason was named No. 26 in &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 greatest villains of all time&quot;. Universal Studios theme parks, in collaboration with New Line Cinema, used the character for their Halloween Horror Nights event. In June 2020, Jason appears in a PSA to encourage people to wear a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021, &quot;IGN&quot; named Jason the &quot;Greatest Movie Slasher of All Time&quot;, while Scott Gleeson of &quot;USA Today&quot; named Jason the 2nd most &quot;haunting horror movie villain&quot;. &quot;Red Bull&quot; called Jason as one of the scariest video game villains of all time, because &quot;playing as Jason is loads of fun, but having to run and hide from him is as exhilarating as it is terrifying.&quot;

The character has been produced and marketed as merchandise over the years. In 1988 Screamin&#x27; Toys produced a model kit where owners could build their own Jason statuette. The kit required the owner to cut and paint various parts in order to assemble the figure. Six years later, Screamin&#x27; Toys issued a new model kit for &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot;. Both kits are now out of production. McFarlane Toys released two toy lines, one in 1998 and the other in 2002. The first was a figure of Jason from &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot;, and the other was of Über-Jason from &quot;Jason X&quot;. Since McFarlane&#x27;s last toy line in 2002, there has been a steady production of action figures, dolls, and statuettes. These include tie-ins with the film &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; (2003). In April 2010 Sideshow Toys released a polystone statue of Jason, based on the version appearing in the 2009 remake. NECA and Mezco Toyz also released figures of Jason in its own action figure series.

===Cultural impact===
The character has been referenced, or made cameo appearances, in various entertainment mediums. Outside of literature sources based on the character, Jason has been featured in a variety of magazines and comic strips. &quot;Cracked&quot; magazine has released several issues featuring parodies of Jason, and he has been featured on two of their covers. &quot;Mad&quot; magazine has featured the character in almost a dozen stories. He has appeared twice in the comic strip &quot;Mother Goose and Grimm&quot;. The &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; antagonist Jei is based on Voorhees; his name, with the honorific &quot;-san&quot; attached, is in fact a pun on Voorhees&#x27; first name.

Many musical artists have made references to Jason Voorhees. Inspired by his own experience, Ari Lehman founded a band called &quot;First Jason&quot;. Lehman&#x27;s band is classified as horror punk, and is influenced by the sounds of the Dead Kennedys and the Misfits. The band&#x27;s name pays homage to Lehman&#x27;s portrayal of Jason Voorhees in the original &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;. One of the band&#x27;s songs is entitled &quot;Jason is Watching&quot;. In 1986, coinciding with the release of &quot;Jason Lives&quot;, Alice Cooper released &quot;He&#x27;s Back (The Man Behind the Mask)&quot; from his album &quot;Constrictor&quot;. The song was written to &quot;signal Jason&#x27;s big return&quot; to cinema, as he had been almost entirely absent in the previous film in the series. Rapper Eminem has referenced Jason in several of his songs. The song &quot;Criminal&quot;, from the album &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;, mentions Jason specifically, while songs &quot;Amityville&quot; and &quot;Off the Wall&quot;—the latter featured fellow rapper Redman—contain Harry Manfredini&#x27;s music &quot;ki, ki, ki ... ma, ma, ma&quot; from the film series. Eminem sometimes wears a hockey mask during concerts. Other rap artists that have referenced Jason include Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre, LL Cool J, and Insane Clown Posse. In 1989, Puerto Rican rapper Vico C had a song titled &quot;Viernes 13&quot; which featured Jason in Puerto Rico. The song was so popular in the island that Vico C wrote a second part titled &quot;Viernes 13, Parte II&quot;. VH1 issued an advertisement for their Vogue Fashion Awards which was labeled &quot;Friday the 20th&quot;, and featured Jason&#x27;s mask created out of rhinestone.

Jason has been referenced or parodied in other films. The 1988 British film &quot;Unmasked Part 25&quot;, whose title lampoons the high number of installments in slasher film series like &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, features a hockey mask-wearing serial killer named Jackson who grows tired of his routine murder sprees and develops a romance with a young woman. In the 1996 film &quot;Scream&quot;, directed by &quot;Elm Street&quot; creator Wes Craven, actress Drew Barrymore&#x27;s character is being stalked by a killer who calls her on her home phone. In order to survive, she must answer the man&#x27;s trivia questions. One question is &quot;name the killer in &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;.&quot; She incorrectly guesses Jason, who did not become the killer for the film series until &quot;Part 2&quot;. Writer Kevin Williamson claimed his inspiration for this scene came when he asked this question in a bar while a group was playing a movie trivia quiz game. He received a free drink, because nobody got the answer right. In another Wes Craven film, &quot;Cursed&quot;, a wax sculpture of Jason, from &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot;, can be seen in a wax museum. In 2014, Jason made a cameo appearance in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial &quot;The &#x27;80s Called&quot;.

Jason has also been referenced by several television shows. The stop motion animated television series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; features Jason in three of its comedy sketches. In episode seventeen, &quot;&quot;, the mystery-solving teenagers from &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; arrive at Camp Crystal Lake to investigate the Jason Voorhees murders, and are killed off one by one as well as killing Don Knotts. Velma is the only survivor, and in typical Scooby-Doo fashion, she rips off Jason&#x27;s mask to reveal his true identity: Old Man Phillips. In &quot;That Hurts Me&quot;, Jason reappears, this time as a housemate of &quot;Horror Movie Big Brother&quot;, alongside other famous slasher movie killers such as Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, Pinhead and Ghostface. Three years later, in episode sixty-two, Jason is shown on the days before and after a typical &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;. Jason is spoofed in the season five episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot; entitled &quot;It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One&quot;. The so-called &quot;Mr. Voorhees&quot; explains to Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa how happy he is to see local wildlife return following the cleanup and rejuvenation of Lake Quahog. He reappears later in the episode as the manager of the &quot;Britches and Hose&quot; clothing store. As opposed to his monstrous personality in the films, Jason is depicted here as polite and articulate, albeit still a psychopath; he murders random swimmers and threatens to kill his employee if she screws up. In an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Jason appears in a Halloween episode sitting on the couch with Freddy Krueger waiting for the family to arrive. When Freddy asks where the family is, Jason responds, &quot;Ehh, whaddya gonna do?&quot; and turns the TV on. He also appears in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Stop, or My Dog Will Shoot!&quot;, alongside Pinhead, menacing Bart in a fantasy sequence. The &quot;South Park&quot; episodes &quot;Imaginationland Episode II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; feature Jason among an assortment of other villains and monsters as an inhabitant of the &quot;bad side&quot; of Imaginationland, a world populated by fictional characters. This version of Jason has an effeminate voice and describes the removal of Strawberry Shortcake&#x27;s eyeball as &quot;super hardcore&quot;. Experimental pop artist Eric Millikin created a large mosaic portrait of Jason Voorhees out of Halloween candy and spiders as part of his &quot;Totally Sweet&quot; series in 2013.

In the Heian period, the Fukuchiyama basin was developed into a number of &quot;shōen&quot; landed estates by the Five regent houses in Kyoto. In the Sengoku period, the area came under the control of Akechi Mitsuhide and a castle town developed around Fukuchiyama Castle. In the Edo Period, it was the center of Fukuchiyama Domain, which was ruled by a succession of &quot;fudai daimyō&quot;. After the Meiji restoration, the town of Fukuchiyama was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to city status on April 1, 1937, becoming the third city in Kyoto Prefecture after Kyoto and Fushimi. The city borders expanded in 1936, 1949, 1955.

Caledonia is located at the intersection of Highway 6 and Haldimand Highway 54 (within the town, these streets are called Argyle Street and Caithness Street respectively) on the Grand River.

==History==
Caledonia was once a small strip of land between Seneca and Oneida villages. The Oneida village was started by the Grand River Navigation Company, which laid out the village of Oneida on the south side of the Grand River. The Oneida village plot originally contained 16 acres and was named after the township where it began. In 1835, the same company started the village of Seneca about a mile down the river from Oneida on the opposite side of the Grand River. It was named &quot;Seneca Village&quot; after the township in which it began. The Grand River passed through Caledonia, dividing it into two sides, North and South. In 1834, Ranald McKinnon was hired by the Grand River Navigation Company to build a dam in Seneca and a dam in Caledonia. Completed in 1835, the dams made water power available with the accompanying lock, and excavation finished early in the following year. Mills sprung up all over Seneca village, and five mills were built in Caledonia by 1850. One was renamed Caledonia Mill, which has been rebuilt and is now used for office space.

In 1835, William Bryant was the first to own a tavern in town. Official deeds to the lands early settlers occupied were not provided until 1850; however, they did have bills of sale. There was a high concentration of Scottish immigrants, and as such, many of Caledonia&#x27;s streets are named in honour of this. Most notably, the main street is named &quot;Argyle&quot; after the example of Glasgow in Scotland.

The Hamilton to Port Dover plank road was brought through Caledonia in 1838. A bridge was built across the river in Caledonia and Seneca in 1842. When first constructed, a stagecoach travelled to both Hamilton and Port Dover daily. These wooden bridges lasted around 19 years before the ice on the river swept them away. The Seneca Bridge was never rebuilt. As of 2011, the Grand River Bridge built in 1927 serves Caledonia&#x27;s traffic.

In 1846, David Thompson of Ruthven became the first Member of Parliament for Haldimand County and died in office five years later in 1851. In the succeeding by-election, Ranald McKinnon ran for office but was ultimately defeated by William Lyon MacKenzie. In 1853, Caledonia was incorporated as a village, when the villages of Oneida and Seneca were amalgamated, and later as a town. Ranald McKinnon was the village&#x27;s first Reeve. 

By 1860, the Grand River Navigation Company was bankrupt, and their land was sold to different organizations. Seneca village was failing; many people from Seneca moved to Caledonia, and navigation on the river ended by 1880. A new way of transportation arrived around 1883; the Grand Trunk Railway passed through Caledonia. Oneida had become part of Caledonia, and the town limits were expanding.

In 1875 the Caledonia Dam was sold to milling companies in the area from the Haldimand Navigation company however several of those companies fell into hard times after a series of fires leveled many buildings in the area. McQuarry, Thorburn and Monroe went bankrupt by 1880, and the Caledonia Mill was taken over by Robert Shirra, which remained active until 1960.

A high school was built in 1924, remaining in use until 1991, when McKinnon Park Secondary School was constructed. It currently houses River Heights Public School. In 1927, the Grand River Bridge was built, unique as the only nine-span bridge of its kind in Canada and the first reinforced concrete bridge of its type ever constructed. During these years, the town also saw the opening of an Opera House and the construction of St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church.

James Little, the founder of Haldimand House, ensured that the ongoing railroad project was routed through Caledonia instead of Cayuga and heavily influenced the town into bankrupting itself to ensure it happened. He became director of the line in 1873. The wooden railway bridge, a local landmark, spanned the Grand River and opened on September 22, 1873, allowing railway travel from Hamilton to Jarvis and later to Port Dover. A &#x27;Railway Hotel&#x27; was built where the current train station sits, and after a series of detrimental fires, the current train station was opened on September 30, 1908. As new technology made the train station rather obsolete, it fell into a sad state of disrepair. It was only restored in November 1997 after a businessman, Ron Clark, saved the property.

In 2006, the Grand River land dispute involving First Nation land claims brought Caledonia to national attention. The land at the centre of the dispute in Caledonia covers 40 hectares, which Henco Industries Ltd. planned to develop as a residential subdivision to be known as the Douglas Creek Estates. It is part of the 385,000-hectare plot of land originally known as the &quot;Haldimand Tract&quot;, which was granted, in 1784, by the Crown to the Six Nations of the Grand River, for their use in settlement. Henco argues that the Six Nations surrendered their rights to the land in 1841, and Henco later purchased it from the Crown. The Six Nations, however, maintain that their title to the land was never relinquished. The Grand River land dispute continued with 1492 Land Back Lane, protests occurring during 2020 and 2021.

===Ranald McKinnon===
McKinnon was born in Ardelum, Scotland, on September 11, 1801. He came to Masonville, New York with his paternal grandparents, Malcolm McKinnon, his wife and a number of siblings. He worked in Virginia and Kentucky until 1820, when the family moved to Trafalgar, Esquesing and Vaughan. At 24, he began working on the Rideau Canal System. On March 3, 1835, he married his first cousin, Euphemia McKinnon, who was 22 years old at the time. The pair would go on to have nine children.

McKinnon was very involved in the community. He was the Treasurer of the Presbyterian Church for a time. In 1850 he petitioned that Caledonia be made its own township that would be absorbed into the county of Wentworth but nothing came of this. He ran for Haldimand County&#x27;s member of parliament as a conservative when the predecessor died in office in 1851 but lost the election. He became Caledonia&#x27;s first Reeve shortly after in 1853.

After several financial setbacks due to numerous of his business ventures burning down, McKinnon found himself in hard times. One of the last acts of his life was about 1875, when he attempted to have a steel bridge replace the pre-existing wooden one. Ranald McKinnon (&quot;Town Father&quot; of Caledonia) died October 18th, 1879, at age 79.

On April 1, 1974, the town was amalgamated into the new town of Haldimand within the Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk. Although the largest community in Haldimand, the town hall was located in nearby Cayuga. In 2001, Haldimand and all other municipalities within the region were dissolved, and the region was instead divided into two single-tier municipalities with city status but called counties. Caledonia is now an unincorporated community in Ward 3 of Haldimand County.

The current mayor of Haldimand County is Shelly Ann Bentley, and the elected councillor for Ward 3 (Caledonia) is Dan Lawrence.

===Edinburgh Square (Old Caledonia Town Hall)===
Previous to the town hall&#x27;s construction, council meetings were held at the house of John Campbell (the local inn) and in other makeshift quarters. The first mention of a town hall was made in 1854 and was discussed for several months until over a year later the council decided to spend a &quot;sum of Eight hundred pounds to build a Town Hall and public Lockup house.&quot; The town hall was built in 1857 and officially opened on January 18, 1858. At the time of its completion, John Scott was the Reeve of Caledonia, James Aldridge was the town clerk, and Thomas Belford was the constable and keeper.

Edinburgh Square was designed as a town hall with jail cells in the basement. The town hall was also intended to house a meat market in the basement. In addition, the second-floor hall was used for various purposes, from public events to Boy Scout meetings. In 1914 the library books had all been stored in the basement and the library was only reestablished in 1935 through the hard work of Laura and Harold Senn. When the library was reestablished, it remained within the town hall until the new Caledonia Public Library was opened in 1967.

The town hall was built by Mr. John Turner, a British immigrant who was residing in Brantford at the time. Mr. Turner also designed the courthouses in St. Thomas and Simcoe, St. Basil&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church and Park Baptist Church in Brantford.

On January 25, 1982, the Town of Haldimand designated the Caledonia Town Hall as a heritage building. The building currently houses the Edinburgh Square Heritage and Culture Centre, a museum preserving the local area&#x27;s history. The museum holds events throughout the year in partnership with the other county museums, Wilson MacDonald Memorial School Museum and Haldimand County Heritage Centre, in addition to summer camps.

===Toll House===
The Caledonia Toll House is the second oldest building in Caledonia, Ontario, still standing; the first being Haldimand House. The toll house was there when the original iron bridge collapsed and the new concrete one (still used today) was built.

With the historic Caledonia Bridge in need of complete replacement, the beautiful historic toll house, which is currently a home and business, has been appropriated as part of the Ministry of Transportation&#x27;s plan to replace it. The toll house is presently a private residence.

<doc id="329130" wikidata="Q750573" url="?curid=329130" title="Maizuru">
<text>is a city in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 78,644 in 34817 households and a population density of 230 persons per km². The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Maizuru is located in northern Kyoto Prefecture, facing scenic Maizuru Bay on the Sea of Japan to the north and Fukui Prefecture to the east.


===Neighboring municipalities===
Fukui Prefecture
*Takahama
Kyoto Prefecture
* Ayabe
*Fukuchiyama
*Miyazu

===Climate===
Like Toyooka in Hyōgo Prefecture, Maizuru has a climate resembling the Hokuriku region rather than the rest of Kansai, though it is less wet than other Hokuriku towns during the late autumn and winter because its location on a deep inlet means the northerly winds driven by the Siberian High and Aleutian Low do not produce as much rain and/or snow. In the summer, however, Maizuru can be extremely oppressive as the intense radiation creates extreme humidity around the bay: on August 13, 1994 the town recorded a &quot;minimum&quot; temperature of .

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Maizuru has declined gradually over the past 30 years.
== History ==
The area of Maizuru has been inhabited since prehistoric times, and numerous traces of Jomon and Yayoi period settlements have been discovered by archaeologists. The Yura River valley in particular was densely populated, and many &quot;kofun&quot; burial mounds have been found. The area became part of Tango Province in the Nara period. During the Muromachi period, the Isshiki clan ruled as &quot;shugo&quot; of the province, but were replaced in the Sengoku period with the Hosokawa clan, who constructed Tanabe Castle, whose nickname &quot;Maizuru Castle&quot; was later adopted as the name of the city. Following the Battle of Sekigahara, Tokugawa Ieyasu awarded the entire province of Tango to Kyōgoku Takatomo, who established Miyazu Domain. To ensure the succession of his line, Kyōgoku Takatomo gave 35,000 &quot;koku&quot; of his holdings to his third son, Kyōgoku Takamitsu, and established a cadet branch of the clan at Tango-Tanabe Domain, based at Maizuru Castle. The Kyōgoku were replaced by a cadet branch of the Makino clan,who ruled until the Meiji restoration in 1871. The town of Maizuru was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The same year, the Maizuru Naval District was created and the associated Maizuru Naval Arsenal for ship basing, construction, and repair was created in 1901. In the Russo-Japanese War, many warships were based there, due to its proximity to the Sea of Japan. Maizuru was raised to city status on August 1, 1938.

After the Second World War, Maizuru was a key port for returning Japanese servicemen and detainees from continental Asia for over 13 years. Today, JMSDF Maizuru Naval Base is a key district headquarters for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.

<doc id="329133" wikidata="Q4928303" url="?curid=329133" title="Bloomingdale, New York">
<text>Bloomingdale is a hamlet located in the town of St. Armand, Essex County, in the State of New York, United States. The United States Postal Service has assigned Bloomingdale the ZIP Code 12913.

==History==
Bloomingdale was incorporated as a village in 1852 and became the center of a thriving lumbering business soon after. Although the industry went into a decline in the 20th century, Bloomingdale&#x27;s location on the Saranac River and at the junction of five roads, including New York State Route 3, helped it to maintain an active community. The hamlet has an elementary school, general store, antique shop and restaurant, many of which have been serving the community for years. The Town Hall is the center of government and community activities. In 1985, the villagers voted in favor of a bill to dissolve the village. Village government formally dissolved in 1992.

In 1900, Daniel Seckington put in a nine-hole golf course in connection with his hotel, the Waverly House; this was one of the earliest golf courses in Essex County.

<text>Choctaw Stadium, formerly Globe Life Park, is an American multi-purpose stadium in Arlington, Texas, United States. The venue opened in April 1994 as a baseball stadium with the name The Ballpark in Arlington, serving as the home for the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball from 1994 through 2019. It replaced the nearby Arlington Stadium, and was succeeded by Globe Life Field. 

In 2020, the stadium was retrofitted for football and soccer. It is the current home of the North Texas SC of MLS Next Pro (FC Dallas&#x27;s reserve team), and the Arlington Renegades of the UFL.

==History==
In April 1989, Rangers owner Eddie Chiles sold the team to an investment group headed by George W. Bush. The aging Arlington Stadium was outdated and did not have amenities that helped make other baseball franchises more profitable. As a result, the team could not compete with other big-city teams for good players. In an effort to fund the project through public money instead of private financing, the Rangers threatened to leave Arlington. The city of Arlington spent $150,000 on an advertising campaign to persuade voters to approve the funding through a referendum by printing brochures, placing telemarketing calls, and planning a &quot;Hands Around Arlington Day.&quot; On January 19, 1991, over 65% of voters approved the deal, allowing the city government to cover 71% of the costs ($135 million out of $191 million) of building the new ballpark. The deal called for the city to raise the sales tax by half a cent to go toward construction. Both houses of the Texas Legislature unanimously approved the public purpose of the ballpark, and Texas Governor Ann Richards signed it all into law.

As part of the deal, the city created a separate corporation, the Arlington Sports Facilities Development Authority (ASFDA), to manage construction. Using authority granted to it by the city, the ASFDA seized several tracts of land around the stadium site using eminent domain for parking and future development.
Construction on the stadium, which was dubbed The Ballpark in Arlington, began on April 2, 1992, a short distance away from Arlington Stadium, the stadium it would replace, and the new Ballpark in Arlington opened on April 1, 1994, in an exhibition contest between the Rangers and the New York Mets. The first official game was on April 11 against the Milwaukee Brewers.

Ameriquest bought the naming rights to the ballpark on May 7, 2004, and renamed it Ameriquest Field in Arlington. The Rangers severed their relationship with Ameriquest on March 19, 2007, and announced the park would be renamed Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.

The largest crowd to watch a Rangers baseball game was on October 30, 2010, when 52,419 fans watched Game 3 of the 2010 World Series against the San Francisco Giants.

Globe Life and Accident Insurance Company, a subsidiary of McKinney-based Globe Life, bought the naming rights for the facility on February 5, 2014, naming it Globe Life Park in Arlington.

On May 20, 2016, the Rangers announced that they intended to move from Globe Life Park to the new Globe Life Field, beginning with the 2020 season. The new air conditioned stadium was slated to feature a retractable roof, which many argued could increase stadium revenue from those who would otherwise not want to sit in the heat during games as the season progresses throughout the hot Texas summer, in particular those that occur in the afternoon. Voting for the new ballpark began on November 8 (the same day as the 2016 presidential election) for residents in the city limits of Arlington. The ballpark was passed with a 60% favorable vote. The stadium opened in the 2020 season.

The new stadium was built south of Globe Life Park, on the site of a surface parking lot between Randol Mill Road and Cowboys Way. Space between the new stadium and Globe Life Park was constructed into an entertainment complex called Texas Live!, developed by The Cordish Companies, which, when finished, is slated to include sports bars, restaurants, and a 300-room hotel to be developed in three phases. The first phase, dubbed &quot;Rangers Republic&quot;, is a two-level venue with multiple restaurants and providing interactive games and authentic memorabilia; the second phase is the Live! Arena, a multi-level venue providing restaurants, a performance stage for concerts, and an outdoor beer garden; Arlington Backyard, the third venue to anchor the entertainment district calls for a large, covered venue that could host concerts, charitable functions, and community events.

Unlike Arlington Stadium, Choctaw Stadium was not demolished. Originally, city officials announced that they would redevelop the structure as part of the Texas Live! complex. The redevelopment would have retained the ballpark&#x27;s outfield office complex and facade, and most of the concourse would have been re-purposed. Potential uses included redeveloping the concourse for condos and retail, as well as turning the current field into an amphitheater. On December 5, 2018, city officials announced that the stadium would become the home of the Dallas Renegades of the new XFL, beginning with the league&#x27;s debut in 2020. North Texas SC, a USL League 1 team also announced they would play at the renovated stadium. Many of the park&#x27;s lower sections, mostly on the third base side, were removed to make room for the rectangular field which sits horizontally when viewed from behind the home plate. New seats were then added to where the ballpark&#x27;s outfield once lay.

On September 29, 2019, after the Rangers&#x27; last home game against the New York Yankees, home plate was removed and transferred to the new park. The renovation project of the stadium from a baseball facility into a football and soccer facility began in October. In December 2019, Six Flags Entertainment Corp. announced the company would move its corporate headquarters the following year to the Centerfield Office Building formerly occupied by the Rangers.

==Features==

===Design===

The stadium was designed by the Driehaus Prize winner and New Classical architect David M. Schwarz of Washington, D.C. The Rangers chose to build a retro-style ballpark (Retro-classic, or Retro-modern), incorporating many features of baseball&#x27;s Jewel Box parks. A roofed home run porch in right field is reminiscent of Tiger Stadium, while the white steel frieze that surrounds the upper deck was copied from the pre-1973 Yankee Stadium. The out-of-town scoreboard (removed in 2009 and replaced with a state-of-the-art video board) was built into the left-field wall—a nod to Fenway Park. The numerous nooks and crannies in the outfield fence are a reminder of Ebbets Field. The arched windows are a reminder of Comiskey Park.

However, it has a few distinct features of its own. Several traditional Texas-style stone carvings are visible throughout. A four-story office building encloses center field with a white steel multilevel facade similar to the facade on the roof.

As the stadium was built on one of the former Arlington Stadium parking lots, the irregular dimensions of the outfield were planned independently, rather than being forced by neighboring structures. The home plate, foul poles (replaced prior to the 2016 season), and bleachers were originally at Arlington Stadium. The Home Plate was inserted into place by Richard Greene (then Mayor of Arlington), Elzie Odom (Head of Arlington Home Run Committee and later Mayor of Arlington), and George W. Bush (former part Rangers owner, later Texas Governor and President of the United States).

The stadium&#x27;s -long facades are made of brick and Texas Sunset Red granite. Bas-relief friezes depict significant scenes from the history of both Texas and baseball. The calculus of seating arrangements represented a new economic model for the sport: a critical mass of high-dollar seats close to the infield boost ticket revenue. The stadium has three basic seating tiers: lower, club and upper deck. Two levels of luxury suites occupy spaces behind sliding glass doors above and below the club tier.

The stadium has a large number of obstructed-view seats. In some cases, the view is cut off by an overhang or underhang, and others are directly in front of support poles. Also, the design of the upper deck left it one of the highest in baseball. The view from the grandstand reserved sections in left is particularly obstructed.

Prior to the 2012 season, the visitor bullpen was reconfigured to be parallel to the field after the previous visitor bullpen configuration had an excessive amount of heat during hot weather games. To allow construction, a few rows of bleacher sections were removed.

====Greene&#x27;s Hill====

&quot;Greene&#x27;s Hill&quot; is a sloped section of turf located beyond the former center field fence. The Hill served as a batter&#x27;s eye, providing a contrasting background behind the pitchers which enabled hitters to more easily see the baseball after the pitcher&#x27;s release. It was originally designed as a picnic area for fans but the Rangers never initiated that policy. It was named after former Arlington mayor Richard Greene in November 1997. For a couple of years in the 2000s, the Rangers had the &quot;T&quot; from the Texas Rangers logo mowed into the grass. In 2010, the Rangers started a tradition where they had four girls run around on it with giant Texas state flags when the Rangers scored, similar to what many football teams do when their teams score. Unlike most batter&#x27;s eyes, fans were allowed to run onto the hill to catch a home run.

===Seating capacity===
The stadium contains 5,704 club seats and 126 luxury suites.

===Field dimensions===

During the stadium&#x27;s existence as a baseball park, it was one of baseball&#x27;s most notoriously hitter-friendly parks, due to the high temperatures, relatively short fences, and the design of the stadium which allowed the area&#x27;s high winds to swirl and lift balls that would not normally make it out. In truth, the park would have given up even more home runs if not for the office building in center and the field being below street level.

With a combination of the park&#x27;s design and the many good hitters who played for the Rangers during the team&#x27;s tenure in the park, the Rangers recorded fairly high home run totals. In 1996, the Rangers hit 221 home runs. They eclipsed 200 again in 1998 (201), 1999 (230), 2001 (241), 2002 (230), 2003 (239), 2004 (227), and 2005 (260, four short of the all-time record of 264 by the 1997 Seattle Mariners). Many of the Rangers&#x27; already-skilled hitters took advantage of this, some even racking up multiple 30+ home run seasons, such as Ian Kinsler, Adrián Beltré, and Josh Hamilton. The longest home run recorded was 505 feet to right field by Rangers RF Nomar Mazara on June 21, 2019.

Dimensions
===Lack of retractable roof===
Despite being hailed as a wonderful venue in its infant years, articles in &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; began to suggest that the ballpark would have been better served by having a dome or retractable roof – much like Daikin Park, the home of the Houston Astros – due to the often oppressive heat that settles over Texas in summer during baseball season, with temperatures on the field being in excess of . Many argue that the intense heat was a liability in attracting players, particularly starting pitchers.

When the Arlington ballpark was built in the early 1990s, the only Major League Baseball stadium with a retractable roof was Toronto&#x27;s SkyDome (now Rogers Centre), which opened in 1989. (Also, Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium was still in use as a ballpark at the time; in 1987, a retractable roof was installed which never worked correctly and was rarely if ever retracted.) The other modern retractable-roof ballparks like Chase Field, T-Mobile Park, Daikin Park, LoanDepot Park, and American Family Field were built in ensuing years.

===Renovations===
On December 3, 2010, the Rangers announced that extensive renovations to the stadium would be made and ready for the 2011 season. These renovations included:
*New Daktronics HD video displays in right field (atop the Home Run Porch) and center field (on top of the office building).
*The out-of-town scoreboard on the left field wall (which had been replaced prior to the 2009 season) also was updated with HD technology.
*The audio system throughout the stadium was completely overhauled, with new speakers and production equipment.
*A new &quot;Show Control System&quot; which can display networked data such as videos, scores, and point-of-sale information anywhere in the stadium.
*An IPTV system that can display live television content on ten HDTV channels to any display in the stadium.

It was announced on December 5, 2018, that the stadium&#x27;s lower stands would undergo extensive renovations once the Renegades moved into the stadium in 2020. The conversion to Choctaw Stadium from Globe Life Park was designed by SBL Architecture, Inc. When renovations for the football layout began, the Texas Rangers sold 6,000 souvenir seats in pairs. A broadcast booth and two booths for football coaches were built in the renovated lower suites and two new auxiliary locker rooms were built on the service level. The Rangers&#x27; clubhouse became the Renegades&#x27; locker room and coaches offices. Lockers were added to the visiting locker room to accommodate Renegades opponents.

==Accidents==

===1994===
On April 11, 1994, the first game at the ballpark, Hollye Minter, who was posing for a picture while intoxicated, fell over a railing in right field, fracturing several bones and causing the team to raise the height of the railings.

===2010===
On July 6, 2010, firefighter Tyler Morris, leaning over the rail to catch a Nelson Cruz foul ball, fell onto the section below him, causing a head injury and a severely sprained ankle to himself and minor injuries to fans he landed on. The game was stopped for 15 minutes while paramedics treated him.

===2011===
On July 7, 2011, firefighter Shannon Stone, from Brownwood, Texas, was attending the Rangers game against the Oakland Athletics with his six-year-old son, Cooper, when outfielder Josh Hamilton threw him a ball, as he had asked. Reaching for it, Shannon flipped over the railing and fell , head-first, onto the concrete behind the out-of-town scoreboard in left field. He was conscious and talking as paramedics tended to him, but he died en route to the hospital. The cause of death was identified as blunt force trauma. This was the fourth fall in the stadium&#x27;s 17 years of history. A moment of silence was held for him prior to the next day&#x27;s game, both the Rangers and Athletics wore black ribbons on their uniforms, and the flags at the stadium were flown at half-staff in memory of him. The Rangers Foundation set up a memorial fund for Stone&#x27;s family.

A tarp was placed over the opening through which Stone fell. Rangers team president Nolan Ryan said the height of the railings exceeds the requirement of the building codes but said the team would do &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to ensure the safety of the fans; on July 20, 2011, the Rangers announced they would raise all railings in the front of seating sections to . On August 10, 2011, the team announced it would erect a statue memorializing Stone. Cooper helped unveil the statue on April 5, 2012. It depicts him and his father wearing baseball caps. They are holding hands and looking at each other as if they were talking. The inscription on the statue reads &quot;In memory of Shannon Stone and dedicated to all fans who love the game&quot;.

On September 30, 2011, Cooper threw out the ceremonial first pitch to honor his father before Game 1 of the 2011 ALDS against the Tampa Bay Rays.

==Notable events==

===MLB===
The Ballpark In Arlington was the site of one perfect game. Kenny Rogers retired all 27 batters on July 28, 1994, against the California Angels.

The ballpark hosted the 1995 MLB All-Star Game. The first MLB regular-season interleague game was played there on June 12, 1997, when the Rangers played the San Francisco Giants. There were four interleague games on the schedule that night, but the other three were played on the West Coast, so the Giants–Rangers matchup started earlier than the others.

On September 18, 1999, Jim Morris made his major league debut there at age 35, ten years after he had retired from baseball following four arm surgeries. Morris became the oldest player to debut in the big leagues since Minnie Mendoza in 1970.

The first postseason game won by the Rangers there would come in game 2 of the 2010 ALCS, by a score of 7–2 over the Yankees on October 16, 2010. Six days later, the Rangers clinched their first ever American League pennant there after a 6–1 victory over the New York Yankees in game 6 of the ALCS, getting the third out in the ninth from former Ranger Alex Rodriguez.

Two world series have been played in The Ballpark In Arlington. The Rangers hosted games 3, 4 and 5 of the 2010 World Series; the San Francisco Giants won the final two games to win the series in five. Games 3, 4 and 5 of the 2011 World Series were also played there, with the Rangers winning 2 of 3 home games, but losing games 6 and 7 to the Cardinals in St. Louis. This was one of three sporting championships to take place in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex in the same year, along with Super Bowl XLV and the 2011 NBA Finals.

===College baseball===
It hosted the 2002 and the 2004 Big 12 Conference baseball tournament. Since 2013, the UT Arlington baseball team annually hosts one game in the stadium every March.

===In popular culture===
Scenes from Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; &quot;The Rookie&quot; were shot there. Filming included actor Dennis Quaid (as Jim Morris) running onto the playing field from the visitors&#x27; bullpen during the seventh-inning stretch of an actual game in progress.

The ballpark and Legends of the Game Museum were featured in an episode of &quot;North Texas Explorer&quot;.

==Non-baseball events==

===Concerts===
===Football===
Prior to the XFL&#x27;s shutdown after five weeks in 2020, the Dallas Renegades had played three games in the stadium. They lost all three beginning with a 15–9 defeat in the season opener against the St. Louis BattleHawks. After the Houston Roughnecks defeated the Renegades 27–20 in Week 4, their last game at Globe Life Park was a 30–12 loss to the New York Guardians. The Dallas Renegades will continue play in the stadium starting with the 2023 season, with the stadium serving as a hub for all eight teams during the regular season and the seven other teams flying to their home stadiums each week. In 2024, the XFL—ahead of an upcoming merger with the United States Football League—indicated that the stadium would again serve as the hub for the merged league.

In 2021 and 2022, the stadium was home of the annual Arlington Showdown featuring the Texas Southern Tigers versus the Southern University Jaguars.

The stadium hosts the high school football games for the Arlington Independent School District as part of the University Interscholastic League.

===Rugby union===
The stadium has been the home of the Dallas Jackals of Major League Rugby since their inaugural season in 2022 until the club ceased operations in September 2024.

===Soccer===

The International Champions Cup soccer match featuring Atlético Madrid of Spain vs. Chivas Guadalajara of Mexico was played on July 23, 2019. It was the first time that a soccer match involving professional clubs was played at Choctaw Stadium.

North Texas SC of USL League One moved from its previous home in Frisco to Choctaw Stadium beginning in 2020. The club is scheduled to leave the stadium in 2026 and move to Mansfield, Texas.

===Other events===
It was the venue for the Dallas/Fort Worth MDA Muscle Walk event that took place on September 20, 2014. This was previously held at AT&amp;T Stadium (formerly Cowboys Stadium) from 2010 to 2013.

On June 17, 2019, a tornado with estimated strength of EF-1 touched down in Arlington near Choctaw Stadium. Officials said the storm damaged windscreens in left field and caused damage to a small portion of the left field roof. Further, the Chick-fil-A signage on the foul pole in left field was damaged.

<text>Walter Francis Sweeney (April 18, 1941 – February 2, 2013) was an American professional football player who was a guard in the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Syracuse Orange and was named to the school&#x27;s all-century team. He also played in the North–South Bowl and the College All-Star Game. A first-round draft pick of the San Diego Chargers in 1963, Sweeney helped them win the AFL championship.

==Career==
A premier guard, Sweeney was versatile enough to fill virtually any offensive line position. He was named to All-Star teams and Pro Bowls for nine consecutive years at offensive guard, beginning with the 1964 AFL All-Star Team, and in 1970 was selected to the All-Time All-AFL second-team. Sweeney spent 11 seasons as an offensive guard with the Chargers, then played two seasons with the Washington Redskins. The Professional Football Researchers Association named Sweeney to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2009.

Sweeney, who stood 6&#x27;4&quot; and weighed 256 pounds, was such an intimidating presence on the field that Merlin Olsen famously remarked he&#x27;d &quot;rather sell used cars&quot; than play against Sweeney each game. Sweeney was among several Chargers fined by the league in 1974 for drug use. A fierce critic of the NFL, he blamed the league for his prolonged problems with drugs and alcohol. Towards the end of his life he retained this bitterness. &quot;If a guy breaks his back in the N.F.L., they&#x27;ll pay him. That didn&#x27;t happen to me. Instead, these guys broke my mind.&quot; He briefly served as a drug counselor at a San Diego hospital and appeared with Nancy Reagan in a promo for her &quot;Just Say No&quot; campaign.

==Death==
Sweeney died of pancreatic cancer on February 2, 2013, at his home in San Diego, California.

<doc id="329137" wikidata="Q1062199" url="?curid=329137" title="Changüí">
<text>Changüí is a style of Cuban music which originated in the early 19th century in the eastern region of Guantánamo Province, specifically Baracoa. It arose in the sugar cane refineries and in the rural communities populated by slaves.
&quot;Changüí&quot; combines the structure and elements of Spain&#x27;s &quot;canción&quot; and the Spanish guitar with African rhythms and percussion instruments of African origin. Changüí is considered a predecessor of &quot;son montuno&quot; (the ancestor of modern salsa), which has enjoyed tremendous popularity in Cuba throughout the 20th century.

Changüí is related to the other regional genres of &quot;nengón&quot; and &quot;kiribá&quot; and is descended from &quot;nengón.&quot; Technically, the changüi ensemble consists of: marímbula, bongos, tres, güiro (or guayo) and one or more singers. Changüi does not use the Cuban &quot;key pattern&quot; (or guide pattern) known as &quot;clave&quot;. The tres typically plays offbeat guajeos (ostinatos), while the guayo plays on the beat.

<doc id="329141" wikidata="Q362089" url="?curid=329141" title="Jovan Jovanović Zmaj">
<text>Jovan Jovanović Zmaj (, pronounced ; 24 November 1833 – 1 June 1904) was a Serbian poet, translator and physician.

Jovanović worked as a physician; he wrote in many poetry genres, including love, lyric, patriotic, political, and youth, but he remains best known for his children&#x27;s poetry. His nursery rhymes have entered the Serbian national consciousness and people sing them to their children without knowing who wrote them. Jovanović also translated the works of some of the great poets, such as Russians Lermontov and Pushkin, Germans Goethe and Heine, and the American Longfellow.

Jovanović&#x27;s nickname &quot;Zmaj&quot; or &quot;Змај&quot; (dragon) derives from the 3 May 1848 assembly.

==Biography==
Zmaj was born in Novi Sad, which was then part of Batsch-Bodrog County (Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire; today in Serbia), on 24 November 1833. His family was old and noble, and had roots in modern-day North Macedonia. His father came from a family of Aromanian descent, which is something that neither Zmaj nor other people from his epoch discussed, probably meaning that his family was fully assimilated. The Jovanovićs lived in Vojvodina as of the 18th century. Zmaj&#x27;s father Pavle served as the mayor of Novi Sad after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and his three brothers were soldiers, government officials and Serbian patriots. In his early childhood he showed a desire to learn by heart the Serbian national songs that were recited to him. As a child he began to compose poems. He finished elementary school in the town, and attended secondary school in Halas and Preßburg (today Bratislava), later studying law in Ofenpesth (Budapest), Prague and Vienna. This was his father&#x27;s wish but his own inclinations prompted him to take up the study of medicine. Zmaj then returned to his native city, where he accepted prominent official position. A year later, his poetic instincts caused him to leave his job to devote himself entirely to literary work. In 1870, Zmaj returned to Novi Sad to work as a doctor, motivated by the tuberculosis from which his wife and children were suffering.

His literary career began in 1849 and in 1852 his first poem was printed in a journal called &quot;Srbski Letopis&quot; (Serbian Annual Review); he contributed to this and to other journals, notably &quot;Neven&quot; and &quot;Sedmica&quot;. From that period until 1870, besides his original poems, he made many translations of works by Sándor Petőfi and János Arany to Serbian from Hungarian, from Russian the works of Lermontov, as well as some German and Austrian poets. In 1861 he edited the comic journal &quot;Komarac&quot; (&quot;The Mosquito&quot;), with Đorđe Rajković. That same year he started the literary journal &quot;Javor&quot; and contributed many poems to these journals.

In 1861, Zmaj married; during the years that followed he produced a series of lyrical poems called &quot;Đulići&quot;, which probably remains his masterpiece. In 1862, greatly to his regret, he discontinued his journal &quot;Javor&quot;. He was politically engaged and sympathized with the ideas of the &quot;United Serbian Youth&quot;, a movement that attracted a number of influential figures in Serbian public life in the 1860s and 1870s.

In 1863, Zmaj was elected director of the Tekelianum at Budapest. He renewed the study of medicine at the university and became a doctor of medicine. Zmaj wrote a lot of articles on hygiene, health and diet, and several scientific works. He also devoted himself to the education of Serbian youth. During his stay in Budapest he founded the literary society Preodnica, of which he was president. In 1864 he started the satirical journal &quot;Zmaj&quot; (&quot;The Dragon&quot;), which was so popular its name became a part of his own. In 1866, his comic play &quot;Šaran&quot; was given with great success.

In 1870, he began working as a physician. He was also an active advocate of cremation. Matica Srpska, the Serbian Medical Society and Serbian Literary Guild made Zmaj a full member.

The death of his wife in 1872 was followed by that of the couple&#x27;s only child who outlived her mother, out of his five children. He was very sad and wrote many sad poems. In 1873 he started another comic journal, the &quot;Žiža&quot;. In 1877 he began an illustrated chronicle of the Russo-Turkish War, and in 1878 began his popular comic journal &quot;Starmali&quot;. During this period he wrote poems and prose, including short novels.

He considered that the Serbian nation should be above the religious divide.

Zmaj died on 1 June 1904 in Sremska Kamenica, Serbia.

==Literary works==
Zmaj wrote lyrical songs under the collective titles &quot;Đulići&quot; (Little Rosebuds) and &quot;Đulići Uveoci&quot; (Faded Little Rosebuds), his most-creative work. He wrote six large volumes of his &quot;Pevanija&quot; (The Book of Songs), and several smaller collections including satires, epigrams, and children&#x27;s songs. His work was published in the United States by Robert Underwood Johnson, who was editor and publisher of New York City&#x27;s &quot;Century Magazine&quot; and a good friend of Nikola Tesla. Tesla himself translated some poems by Zmaj. In the following we have the poet&#x27;s definition of poetry:

&lt;poem&gt;
Where is Pain and dire Distress,
Songs shall soothe like soft caress;
Though the stoutest courage fails,
Song&#x27;s an anchor in all gales;
When all others fail to reach,
Song shall be the thrilling speech;
Love and friends and comfort fled,
Song shall linger by your bed;
And when Doubt shall question, Why?
Song shall lift you to the sky.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Zmaj is best known for his poetry for children and was one of the first authors of comic strips in Serbia.

==Legacy==
The Zmaj Children Games (Змајеве дечје игре/Zmajeve dečje igre), one of the biggest festivals for children in Serbia, are named after Jovan Jovanović Zmaj. The town of Sremska Kamenica bore the name Zmajeva Kamenica (Zmaj&#x27;s Kamenica) in his honour. He is included in lists of The 100 most prominent Serbs. During his lifetime, Zmaj had acquired the title of the &quot;people&#x27;s poet&quot;, an expression of esteem also befitting the title of Poet laureate.

August Šenoa wrote highly of his poetry. Literary historian Jovan Deretić considered Zmaj to be one of the central figures of Serbian Romanticism and Serbian literature of the second half of the 19th century. Deretić praised his poems, translations and satirical works.

Children&#x27;s poetry written by Zmaj is still popular in Serbia and the wider Balkans region.

<text>Terrebonne () is an off-island suburb of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is located in the North Shore region of the Montreal area, north of Laval across the Rivière des Mille-Îles.

This city is divided in three sectors, namely Lachenaie, La Plaine and Terrebonne. In the past, these sectors were distinct cities, but, on 22 August 2001, they merged under the name of &quot;Terrebonne&quot;. According to the 2021 Canadian Census Terrebonne has a population of 119,944, making it Montreal&#x27;s third largest suburb and the largest city on the North Shore.

==History==

The town of Lachenaie, which was founded in 1683 by Lord Charles Aubert de Lachenaye, is the oldest of the three towns that were merged. Some natives were already present on this territory at the time. The colonisation really started in 1647 when Lachenaie was merged with the Repentigny Seigniory. Louis Lepage de Ste-Claire, priest, canon, and the son of René Lepage de Sainte-Claire, acquired the Seigniory of Terrebonne on 2 September 1720. Abbot Louis Lepage de Ste-Claire built the first church in 1734 and the first manor in 1735. A few years later, Abbot Lepage equipped the town with both a saw mill and a flour mill.

The town of La Plaine was founded in 1830 on fragments of other towns, namely Mascouche, Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Saint-Lin, and Terrebonne. At that time, the lords of Terrebonne and Lachenaie built the road named &quot;chemin de la Grande Ligne&quot; to join the two towns. It is now called the boulevard Laurier. In 1877, the rail system was developed and stimulated the economic growth. The village of Saint-Joachim was founded during that time, which was later, in 1920, to be renamed La Plaine.

The first lord of Terrebonne was André Daulier-Deslandes, who was granted his title in 1673. Following the construction of the first wooden bridge in 1834, two main areas emerged. The commercial area was Terrebonne, while the agricultural one was Saint-Louis de Terrebonne. Terrebonne became incorporated as a city in 1860 and again in 1985 after the merger with the parish of Saint-Louis de Terrebonne.

At the time of the municipal merger in late August 2001, Lachenaie had over 20,000 residents, La Plaine had 17,000 residents, and Terrebonne had almost 46,000 residents. This merger made Terrebonne the 10th largest city in Quebec. Ten years later, the city had around 106,322 citizens on of land, according to the 2011 Canadian Census.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Terrebonne, like nearby Montréal city, has the same humid continental climate (warm summer subtype, Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;), with warm or hot humid summers and cold winters. Terrebonne is cooler on average than Montréal, and during cold waves temperatures generally remain at or below -30°C (-22°F) more often. Terrebonne&#x27;s record temperatures, as recorded at the nearby Mascouche station, are a high of in August 1 1975, and a low of in January 15 1957.

== Demographics ==


In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Terrebonne had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

===&quot;Île-des-moulins&quot;===

The pre-industrial complex of the &quot;Île-des-moulins&quot; was amongst the most important ones in the province of Quebec during the 19th century. Although several infrastructures have degraded, a total of five buildings remain. The fourth lord of Terrebonne, Abbot Louis Lepage, had ordered the construction of the first flour mill in 1721 as well as the first saw mill around 1725.

In 1803, the bakery was built and established in the village. The current saw and flour mills were built in 1804 and 1846, respectively. Four years following the construction of the flour mill that is currently standing at the &quot;Île-des-moulins&quot; to this day, the &quot;Moulin neuf&quot; (New Mill) was built in 1850. In addition, around the same time in 1850, the seigniory office was established.

In 1973, the &quot;Île-des-moulins&quot; was classified as a historic site of national interest by the Government of Quebec.

=== &quot;Moulin-Neuf&quot; dam ===

The &quot;Moulin-Neuf&quot; dam allows for the flow regulation of the Rivière des Mille Îles, as well as ice accumulation control in the spring.

The first dam at the &quot;Île-des-moulins&quot; was built in 1721, following the establishment of the very first flour mill. This dam linked the &quot;Île-des-moulins&quot; to the &quot;Ile Saint-Jean&quot;, passing through the small &quot;Île aux moutons&quot;, located midway between the two islands in the Rivière des Mille Îles.

In 1872, the Masson family ordered the construction of a new dam near the location of the current historical one. However, this dam was rebuilt in cement in the year 1890 for reinforcement and increased resilience.

Nearly a century later, in 1972, the owner of the &quot;Île-des-moulins&quot; decided to destroy the dam with dynamite due to flooding risk. As a result, the dam underwent severe damage, prompting the city of Terrebonne to acquire the island and classify it as a protected historical site in 1973.

In 1979, the &quot;Ministère des Richesses naturelles du Québec&quot; ordered the reconstruction of the &quot;Moulin-Neuf&quot; dam, to which a pedestrian walkway is added to allow citizens, visitors, and tourists to walk from the &quot;Île-des-moulins&quot; to the larger Ile Saint-Jean. This new dam was built a certain distance away from the small &quot;Île aux moutons&quot;, making the dam significantly longer than the initial ones.

=== Ecclesiastical architecture ===

The actual Saint-Louis-de-France Church in Old Terrebonne (&quot;Vieux Terrebonne&quot;), near the historical site of the &quot;Île-des-moulins&quot;, was established in 1878, while the parish was founded in 1723 by Louis Lepage de Sainte-Claire, priest of the diocese of Quebec, parish priest of the &quot;Île Jésus&quot;, and lord of the Seigniory of Terrebonne. The parish was part of the diocese of Saint-Jérôme.

The current Saint-Louis-de-France Church built around the year 1878, the third since the foundation of the parish, was equipped with a Casavant organ in 1946.

In 1880, parish priest Piché, informally known as the &quot;bon monsieur Piché&quot; (&quot;Good Mister Piché&quot; in English), exhumed the bodies buried in the basement of the old church in order to place them in the crypt of the new one.

==Sports==
The Terrebonne Cobras are part of the QJHL.

==Infrastructure==

Terrebonne is connected to Montreal&#x27;s Central Station by commuter rail via the Terrebonne station of the Réseau de transport métropolitain (RTM) Mascouche line.

The city of Terrebonne is also equipped with a bus network, also operated by the RTM, which enables residents to reach several metro stations both in Laval and Montreal, amongst many other locations. Some examples include bus line 30 (or 30G), which brings inhabitants of Terrebonne to the Radisson metro station on Sherbrooke Street East, bus line 19 (or 19G), which reaches Montmorency metro station in Laval, and bus line 25, whose terminal stop is at the Henri-Bourassa metro station.

==Education==

===University===
The Université de Montréal has a small campus located near the Pierre Le Gardeur Hospital in the Lachenaie sector of the city of Terrebonne. There are also some courses given by the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM) in the Terrebonne sector, as well as the &quot;Centre universitaire de Lanaudière à Terrebonne&quot; affiliated with the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières (UQTR) located within the Cégep régional de Lanaudière à Terrebonne.

<text>Paul Edward Lowe (born September 27, 1936) is an American former professional football player who was a halfback in the American Football League (AFL), primarily with the Los Angeles / San Diego Chargers. A four-time All-AFL selection and two-time AFL All-Star, he was named to the AFL All-Time Team.

Lowe played college football for the Oregon State Beavers. He won an AFL championship with the Chargers in 1963. He led the league in rushing yards in 1965, when he was named the AFL Player of the Year. Lowe finished his career with the Kansas City Chiefs, receiving a championship ring after they won Super Bowl IV. He was inducted into the Chargers Hall of Fame and named to their 40th and 50th anniversary teams.

==Early life==
Lowe was born in Homer, Louisiana, and grew up in the Los Angeles area. A native of Compton, California, he jumped the fence of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as a child to watch Los Angeles Rams games. He attended Centennial High School, where he was a standout in football, track, and basketball.

==College career==
Lowe attended Oregon State University and played under Beavers coach Tommy Prothro. In his sophomore year in 1956, he played as the No. 2 tailback behind starter Joe Francis in the Beavers&#x27; single-wing offense. Lowe rushed 113 times for 407 yards and six touchdowns, and completed 13 of 26 passes or 293 yards. He received honorable mention for the All-America team from the United Press, who also named him to the second team of the All-Coast team. Oregon State won the Pacific Coast Conference and was ranked 10th nationally. They played in the 1957 Rose Bowl, losing to No. 3 Iowa for the second time in the season.

Shortly after the Rose Bowl, Oregon State suspended Lowe due to low grades. After raising his grades in junior college, he returned to Oregon State the following year in 1958. He failed to meet expectations and was primarily a backup to Grimm Mason and Dainard Paulson, finishing with 62 rushes for 162 yards and two touchdowns along with 100 yards on 6 of 17 passing. After the season, Lowe withdrew from school due to financial and academic difficulties.

==Professional career==
After leaving Oregon State University, Lowe was undrafted in the 1959 NFL draft. He played for the San Francisco 49ers during the 1959 pre-season before being released in the final cut after hurting his ankle before the regular season began. He returned to Los Angeles, and looked for a job to support his wife and four children. He took a job in the mailroom for the Carte Blanche Corporation, owned by the Hilton family.

In 1960, Barron Hilton, son of famed hotel magnate Conrad Hilton, was the original owner of the Los Angeles Chargers, a start-up team in the newly formed American Football League. Chargers general manager Frank Leahy asked Lowe to come out to training camp based on his performance at Oregon State a few years back. Lowe joined the Chargers as a free agent. He returned his first touch of the football in the AFL for a 105-yard touchdown in the Chargers&#x27; first-ever exhibition game. That season, he led the team to a 10–4 record and a Western Division championship. He had a team-high 855 yards rushing on 136 carries for a career-high 6.3 yards per carry average, and also had 23 receptions for 377 yards. Lowe finished No. 2 in the league in rushing, 20 yards behind Abner Haynes of the Dallas Texans, and earned first-team All-AFL honors as a halfback. In the 1960 AFL championship game, Lowe ran for 165 yards.

In the season opener of 1961 against the Texans, with the team now based in San Diego, Lowe had the Chargers&#x27; longest run from scrimmage with an 87-yard run, a record that still stands. He missed the 1962 season after breaking his arm. He returned and ran for 1,010 yards in 1963, when the Associated Press named him the AFL Comeback Player of the Year. In the AFL championship game, Lowe rushed for 94 yards on 12 carries, including a 58-yard touchdown, in a 51–10 win over Boston. Limited by a muscle injury in 1964, his production fell to 496 yards.

In 1965, Lowe was named the AFL Player of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; after a then-league-record 1,121 yards rushing and six touchdowns (14-game schedule). He became the first AFL player to rush for 1,000 yards twice after gaining 99 yards in a 37–26 win over the Houston Oilers, clinching the Chargers&#x27; fifth Western Division title in six years. In the regular season finale against the Oakland Raiders, he broke Clem Daniels&#x27; AFL single-season record of 1,099 rushing yards, set by the Raider in 1963. Again named the AFL&#x27;s comeback player of the year, Lowe was also tied for second with teammate Lance Alworth in voting by United Press International for their AFL player of the year award, won by Jack Kemp.

Lowe rushed for 643 yards the following season in 1966, and his output fell to 71 yards on 2.5 yards per carry in 1967. After running for nine yards on his only carry in the 1968 season-opener win over Cincinnati, he was waived by San Diego. He was 28 yards shy of the 5,000-yard career milestone. Lowe joined the Kansas City Chiefs as a free agent after all six of their running backs were injured. On his first running play with the Chiefs, he separated his shoulder, and missed the rest of the season. In his final season in 1969, he passed 5,000 yards against Boston on September 21 after rushing eight times for 40 yards, surpassing the mark on the final play after a sweep for eight yards. He joined Daniels as the only AFL players to reach the milestone. However, Lowe fell below the mark after losing yards against the Chargers on the final carry of his career. Shortly after, he was hospitalized to treat a bleeding ulcer. Lowe retired and left the team with one game remaining in the regular season. Kansas City defeated Minnesota 23–7 in Super Bowl IV that season, and he received a Super Bowl ring.

==Legacy==
Lowe was a four-time All-AFL selection, including twice on the first team, as well as a two-time AFL All-Star. He averaged 4.9 yards per carry during his career, which is the highest in Chargers franchise history and tops in the AFL. He set a pro football record with six games gaining 100+ yards on 14 carries or less. Lowe&#x27;s career rushing total of 4,995 yards are the second-most in AFL history. He led the Chargers in rushing five times, including two 1,000 yard seasons. His 4,972 yards with the Chargers remained a team career record until 2004, when he was surpassed by LaDainian Tomlinson. Lowe was the AFL leader or runner-up in rushing touchdowns four times. He is also one of only twenty players who were in the AFL for its entire ten-year existence.

In 1970, the Pro Football Hall of Fame named Lowe as a running back on the All-Time All-AFL Team. In 1979, the Chargers inducted him into the Chargers Hall of Fame. As of 2006, Lowe was living in San Diego and supports his team as a season ticket holder.

==NFL career statistics==

==Health==
Lowe has experienced ringing in his ears since 1965. In 2017, a neurologist diagnosed that a CT scan &quot;showed atrophy of frontal lobes, and his testing showed...moderate dementia&quot;. In 2018, Lowe signed papers that awarded him $25,000 (before lawyer fees) from the NFL concussion settlement.

<text>True Names is a 1981 science fiction novella by American writer Vernor Vinge, a seminal work of the cyberpunk genre. It is one of the earliest stories to present a fully fleshed-out concept of cyberspace, which would later be central to cyberpunk. The story also contains elements of transhumanism.

&quot;True Names&quot; first brought Vinge to prominence as a science fiction writer. It also inspired many real-life hackers and computer scientists; a 2001 book about the novella, &quot;True Names: And the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier&quot;, included essays by Danny Hillis, Marvin Minsky, Mark Pesce, Richard Stallman and others. It was a finalist for the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1982, and was awarded the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award in 2007.

==Plot summary==
The story follows the progress of a group of computer hackers (called &quot;warlocks&quot;) who are early adopters of a new full-immersion virtual reality technology, called the &quot;Other Plane&quot;. Warlocks penetrate computers around the world for personal profit or curiosity. They must keep their true identities (&quot;True Names&quot;) secret even from each other and from the &quot;Great Enemy&quot;, the United States government, as those who know a warlock&#x27;s True Name can force him to work on their behalf, or cause a &quot;True Death&quot; by killing the warlock in real life.

The protagonist is a warlock known as &quot;Mr. Slippery&quot; in the Other Plane. The government learns Mr. Slippery&#x27;s True Name—Roger Pollack, a holonovelist in Arcata, California—and forces him to investigate the Mailman, a mysterious new warlock which the government suspects of conducting a large-scale subversion of databases and networks. The Mailman has been recruiting others, such as the warlock DON.MAC, by promising great power in the real world, and claims to be responsible for a recent revolution in Venezuela. Because he communicates only through text, and reacts to events only after a significant delay, Mr. Slippery and fellow warlock Erythrina begin to suspect that the Mailman may be an extraterrestrial invader, subverting global databases to conquer the Earth while causing the True Deaths of the warlocks he recruits.

Mr. Slippery and Erythrina receive permission from the government to use the old ARPANET to access massive amounts of computational power around the world as they search for the Mailman. As they become the most powerful warlocks in history they realize that DON.MAC is a sophisticated &quot;personality simulator&quot; working for the Mailman. It violently defends itself, and both sides use network connections to military weaponry to attack in the real world. Erythrina is forced to reveal her True Name to Mr. Slippery as the battles, real and virtual, cause global chaos. They succeed in destroying the many copies of the Mailman&#x27;s AI, and although tempted to keep their power over the world realize that they do not wish to be tyrants.

Ten weeks after the war and resulting worldwide economic depression from the disruptions in computer systems, Mr. Slippery returns to the Coven and learns that the Mailman may have survived. Fearing that Erythrina succumbed to temptation for power, Pollack visits her—Debbie Charteris of Providence, Rhode Island—in person. The elderly Charteris, an early military computer programmer, reveals that the Mailman was not an extraterrestrial, but a National Security Agency AI research project to protect government systems. Mistakenly left running, it slowly grew in power and sophistication, and used non-real-time communication to disguise its inability to fully emulate the human mind. As Charteris succumbs to senility she transfers more of her personality to the defeated Mailman&#x27;s kernel, and tells Pollack that &quot;when this body dies, I will still be, and you can still talk to me&quot;.

==Afterword==

Minsky&#x27;s afterword reviews ideas from his Society of Mind concept: the idea &quot;that there is, inside the cranium, perhaps as many as a hundred different kinds of computers, each with a somewhat different basic architecture&quot;, which specialize in different tasks and communicate, though perhaps only crudely. Minsky considers our conscious minds to be higher-level executives, which don&#x27;t really understand the inner workings of the subcomponents but rather select &quot;simple names from menu-lists of symbols which appear, from time to time, upon our mental screen-displays.&quot; Tying this back to virtual reality, Minsky suggests that &quot;we, ourselves, already exist as processes imprisoned in machines inside machines! Our mental worlds are already filled with wondrous, magical, symbol–signs, which add to every thing we &#x27;see&#x27; its ‘meaning’ and ‘significance’.&quot;

==Reception==
In 2001, &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared that Vinge&#x27;s depiction of &quot;a world rife with pseudonymous characters and other elements of online life that now seem almost ho-hum&quot; had been &quot;prophetic&quot;, while &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called it &quot;still compelling&quot;. &quot;Strange Horizons&quot; called it a &quot;landmark&quot;.

In 2001, a collection of essays, &quot;True Names: And the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier&quot;, was published, with contributions from Danny Hillis, Timothy C. May, Marvin Minsky, Chip Morningstar and F. Randall Farmer, Mark Pesce, and Richard Stallman.

<text>Fort McMurray ( ) is an urban service area in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo in Alberta, Canada. It is located in northeast Alberta, in the middle of the Athabasca oil sands, surrounded by boreal forest. It has played a significant role in the development of the national petroleum industry. The 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire led to the evacuation of its residents and caused widespread damage.

Formerly a city, Fort McMurray became an urban service area when it amalgamated with Improvement District No. 143 on April 1, 1995, to create the Municipality of Wood Buffalo (renamed the RM of Wood Buffalo on August 14, 1996). Despite its current official designation of urban service area, many locals, politicians and the media still refer to Fort McMurray as a city. Fort McMurray was known simply as McMurray between 1947 and 1962.

== History ==
Before the arrival of Europeans in the late 18th century, the Cree were the dominant First Nations people in the Fort McMurray area. The Athabasca oil sands were known to the locals and the surface deposits were used to waterproof their canoes. During the fur trade, the location of Fort McMurray, west of Methye Portage, was an important junction on the fur trade route from eastern Canada to the Athabasca Country. 

In 1778, the first European explorer, Peter Pond, came to the region in search of furs, as the European demand for this commodity at the time was strong. Pond explored the region farther south along the Athabasca River and the Clearwater River, but chose to set up a trading post much farther north by the Athabasca River near Lake Athabasca. However, his post closed in 1788 in favour of Fort Chipewyan, now the oldest continuous settlement in Alberta.

In 1790, the explorer Alexander MacKenzie made the first recorded description of the oil sands. By that time, trading between the explorers and the Cree was already occurring at the confluence of the Clearwater and Athabasca rivers. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the North West Company were in fierce competition in this region. Fort McMurray was established there as a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post by 1870, named for the Chief Factor William McMurray. It continued to operate as a transportation stopover in the decades afterwards. The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway arrived in 1915 complementing existing steamboat service.

The community has played a significant role in the history of the petroleum industry in Canada. Oil exploration is known to have occurred in the early 20th century, but Fort McMurray&#x27;s population remained small, no more than a few hundred people. By 1921, there was serious interest in developing a refining plant to separate the oil from the sands. Alcan Oil Company was the first outfit to begin bulk tests at Fort McMurray. The nearby community of Waterways was established to provide a southern terminus for waterborne transportation when the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway reached there in 1921.

Abasands Oil was the first company to successfully extract oil from the oil sands through hot water extraction by the 1930s, but production was very low. Fort McMurray&#x27;s processing output gradually grew to over 1,100 barrels/day by World War II, and Fort McMurray was set up by the US and Canadian forces as staging ground for the Canol Project.

Fort McMurray and Waterways amalgamated as the village of McMurray (the &quot;Fort&quot; was dropped until 1962, when it was restored to reflect its heritage) by 1947, and became a town a year later. Fort McMurray was granted the status of new town so it could get more provincial funding. By 1966, the town&#x27;s population was over 2,000.

In 1967, the Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor) plant opened and Fort McMurray&#x27;s growth soon took off. More oil sands plants were opened, especially after the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis, when serious political tensions and conflicts in the Middle East triggered oil price spikes. The population of the town reached 6,847 by 1971 and climbed to 31,000 by 1981, a year after its incorporation as a city.

The population peaked at almost 37,000 in 1985, then declined to under 34,000 by 1989. Low oil prices since the oil price collapse in 1986 slowed the oil sands production greatly, as oil extraction from the oil sands is a very expensive process and lower world prices made this uneconomical.

On April 1, 1995, the City of Fort McMurray and Improvement District No. 143 were amalgamated to form the Municipality of Wood Buffalo. The new municipality was subsequently renamed the Regional Municipality (RM) of Wood Buffalo on August 14, 1996. As a result, Fort McMurray was no longer officially designated a city. Instead, it was designated an urban service area within a specialized municipality. The amalgamation resulted in the entire RM of Wood Buffalo being under a single government. Its municipal office is located in Fort McMurray, which accounts for the great majority of the RM&#x27;s population; all but 5,000 of the RM&#x27;s residents live in the Fort McMurray urban service area.

The city continued to grow for a few years even after the oil bust caused by the 2003 collapse in world oil prices. Oil price increases since 2003 made oil extraction profitable again for around a decade, until another slump in oil prices which began in December 2014 and deepened in 2015 resulted in layoffs and postponement of projects.

In June 2013, heavy rains caused the Hangingstone River to flood, causing a six-day state of emergency, a bridge collapse, the closure of highways 63 and 881, and the evacuation of 150 people.

=== May 2016 wildfire ===

On May 3, 2016, a large wildfire burning southwest of Fort McMurray resulted in the mandatory evacuation of the community. Record-breaking temperatures, reaching , low relative humidity and strong winds contributed to the fire&#x27;s rapid growth in forests affected by &quot;an unusually dry and warm winter&quot;.

Upwards of 88,000 people in the community and surrounding region were evacuated. It was Canada&#x27;s largest recorded wildfire evacuation in history and third-largest recorded environmental disaster evacuation behind the 1979 Mississauga train derailment and the 1950 Red River flood.

About one-fifth of homes in the community were reported to be destroyed in the fire.

=== April 2020 flood ===
On April 27, 2020, massive ice jams along the Athabasca River resulted in a major flood. It devastated the downtown of Fort McMurray, submerging streets and ruining businesses, cars and houses.

Approximately 13,000 people from Fort McMurray and the surrounding area were evacuated.

=== May 2024 wildfire ===

On 14 May 2024, a wildfire led to the evacuation of several neighborhoods in the urban service area.

The evacuation displaced upwards of 6,000 people from their homes in these neighborhoods.

== Geography ==

Fort McMurray is northeast of Edmonton on Highway 63, about west of the Saskatchewan border, nestled in the boreal forest at the confluence of the Athabasca River, the Clearwater River, the Hangingstone River, and the Horse River. It sits at above sea level. Fort McMurray is the largest community in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo.

White spruce, trembling aspen, balsam poplar and white birch are the most prominent native trees in and around town. Black spruce and tamarack occur in poorly drained areas and jack pine may be seen on the driest sites. European aspen, blue spruce and sand cherry are among the exotic trees occasionally seen.

=== Climate ===
With severe winters except during periods of warming chinook winds, mild to warm summers and only three months which average temperature is higher than , Fort McMurray has a borderline subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;), being just below the threshold of humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;), with May and September average temperature of . It falls into the Natural Resources Canada (NRC) Plant Hardiness Zone 3a.

The community lies at a lower elevation than most other parts of Alberta, so under the right conditions it can be a &quot;hot spot&quot; for Alberta.

Temperatures range from an average of in January, to in July. The average annual precipitation is and falls mainly in the summer months. Average annual snowfall is , with almost all of it falling between October and April.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Fort McMurray was on June 30, 2021. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on February 1, 1917 and December 31, 1933.

=== Neighbourhoods ===
Neighbourhoods in Fort McMurray include Abasand Heights, Beacon Hill, Dickinsfield, Eagle Ridge, Grayling Terrace, Gregoire, Lower Townsite, Parsons Creek, Prairie Creek, Saline Creek, Stone Creek, Thickwood Heights, Timberlea, and Waterways.

In the 2016 census, the Fort McMurray population centre recorded 66,573 residents living in 23,937 of its 28,567 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 60,555. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

=== Municipal census ===
The permanent population of the Fort McMurray urban service area according to the RM of Wood Buffalo&#x27;s 2021 municipal census is 72,917, a change of from its 2018 municipal census permanent population of 72,056. In addition, the 2021 municipal census counted a shadow population of 3,089 non-permanent residents for a combined population of 76,006, while the 2018 municipal census counted 3,559 non-permanent residents for a combined population of 75,615.

=== Migration ===
Fort McMurray is an increasingly multicultural community. The 2021 census published by the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo found roughly 6,700 people moved to the region since the 2018 census.

The top four provinces that sent people were other communities in Alberta (55 per cent), followed by Newfoundland and Labrador (13 percent), and British Columbia and Ontario (nine percent each).

This is a drastic change from the 2012 municipal census, which was taken when Fort McMurray and the oil sands was undergoing a huge period of economic and population growth. That census reported people from Ontario represented 27.5 percent of Canadians coming to Fort McMurray, followed by British Columbia (26.3 percent) and Newfoundland and Labrador (17.5 percent). People from elsewhere in Alberta made up 3.1 per cent of the population.

=== Ethnicity ===
The 2021 census found 61.5 percent of residents are white, compared to 64 percent in 2016. The second largest pan ethnic group is Indigenous (10 percent), South East Asian (9.2 percent), followed by South Asian (7 percent). People identifying as Chinese, Japanese or Korean represented 1.3 percent of the population.

Indigenous peoples represented 7 percent, remaining consistent from 2018. The municipal survey did not count the population of the region&#x27;s First Nation reserves because they do not fall under municipal jurisdiction. First Nations people represent four percent of the municipality&#x27;s population. Métis people represent 2.89 percent of the population, followed by Inuk (0.16 percent) and non-Status First Nation (0.13 percent).

About 3.2 percent of people identified as African, followed by mixed ethnicities (2.44 percent), Black or African Canadian (2 percent), European (1.73 percent), Arab (1.41 percent), Hispanic or Latin American (1.08 percent), Caribbean (0.67 percent) and Oceanic (0.13 percent).

2.88 percent of respondents did not answer and 0.52 said they did not know their ethnicity.

== Economy ==
Fort McMurray is considered the heart of one of Alberta&#x27;s (and Canada&#x27;s) hubs of petroleum production, located near the Athabasca oil sands. Besides the oil sands, the economy also relies on natural gas and pipeline transport, forestry and tourism. Oil sands producers include Syncrude, Suncor Energy, Canadian Natural Resources, and CNOOC Petroleum North America ULC. Fort McMurray&#x27;s growth is characteristic of a boomtown. Housing prices and rents are far higher in Fort McMurray than most such remote areas, and in 2006, Fort McMurray had the highest prices in Alberta. The Alberta government has promised to release more Crown land for residential construction, particularly in Timberlea on the north side.

== Infrastructure ==


===Air===

There are several airports in the area, with Fort McMurray International Airport being the largest in northern Alberta. It is serviced by Air Canada, Air Canada Express, McMurray Aviation, Northwestern Air, WestJet and WestJet Encore, with scheduled flights to Calgary, Edmonton, Fort Chipewyan, Fort Smith, Montreal and Toronto. The airport is also serviced by various oil companies with corporate and charter flights heading north to private airstrips at oil sands operations. Flights are frequently booked to capacity because of the high transient worker population and workers who commute to Fort McMurray from other parts of Canada.

===Public transit===
Fort McMurray Transit operates in the community, with routes that extend to all subdivisions on the south side and subdivisions on the north side. Although the service concentrates on Fort McMurray it does operate to hamlets in the RM including Anzac, Janvier, Conklin and Fort McKay.

====Bus====
Ebus and Red Arrow operate scheduled passenger bus services to Edmonton and other communities along Highway 63, as well as other destinations farther south.

===Highways and roads===
Highway 63 is the only highway between Fort McMurray and Edmonton. Due to the industrial demands of the oilsands, Highway 63 boasts some of the highest tonnage per kilometre in Canada, and the largest and heaviest loads that trucks have ever carried. Highway 63 was fully twinned in May 2016. Highway 881 also provides access to the region from Lac La Biche.

===Rail===
Canadian National Railway (CN) discontinued the &quot;Muskeg Mixed&quot; (mixed train) to Fort McMurray in 1989, and there has been no passenger rail service since. CN continues to operate freight service on its Lac La Biche subdivision and stations beyond.

===Mail===
Canada Post identified Fort McMurray as &quot;having a particularly high cost to serve&quot; in January 2014, and planned to institute a surcharge of $5.00 for all parcels shipped to the area. However, the postal service retracted this decision before the rate change went into effect.

== Education ==

The Fort McMurray Public School District (FMPSD) and Catholic School District both serve the primary, elementary, and secondary education needs of students in Fort McMurray. Each school district offers diverse programs like French immersion, performing arts or a dedicated technology and science lab, however only FMPSD offers the Advanced Placement program at one of their schools, being Westwood Community High School.

On Abasand Drive, École Boréal is the only francophone school in the area and goes from pre-kindergarten to grade 12.

Keyano College is a publicly funded college and vocational institute based in the area and plays a role in training workers for the oil sands. Known as the cultural hub of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, Keyano College contains both a state-of-the-art theatre and recital hall, hosting a variety of musical and theatrical events that attract upwards of 50,000 visitors each season.

== Sports and recreation ==

Local teams include the Fort McMurray Oil Barons of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL), the Fort McMurray Giants of the Western Canadian Baseball League (WCBL), and the Keyano Huskies of the Alberta Colleges Athletics Conference (ACAC).

The MacDonald Island Park recreation centre is located on MacDonald Island north-east of downtown. The centre contains the Wood Buffalo Regional Library, indoor water park, basketball, tennis and squash courts, rock climbing, fitness centre, indoor playground, ice rinks and public rental space. Shell Place, a connected recreational facility, and a seasonal golf course surround the centre. Fort McMurray Knights Rugby Football Club is also based in the town.

<text>Arlington Stadium was a baseball stadium located in Arlington, Texas, United States, located between Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas. It served as the home of the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1972 until 1993, after which the team moved into The Ballpark in Arlington (now Choctaw Stadium).

==History==
===Early years as a minor league stadium===
The stadium was built in 1965 as Turnpike Stadium, a minor league ballpark seating 10,000 people named for the nearby Dallas–Fort Worth Turnpike (now part of Interstate 30, and known as the Tom Landry Highway). The Fort Worth Cats of the Texas League moved there as the Dallas–Fort Worth Spurs, and played there for the next seven years, setting many Texas League attendance records during their tenure at the stadium, especially after it expanded to 20,500 seats in 1970.

However, the stadium&#x27;s real purpose was to attract a major league team to the Metroplex. It had been built to be upgraded to Major League standards of the era, and was designed to be expandable to up to 50,000 seats (although its final actual capacity was 7,000 seats below that). Due to its location in a natural bowl, only minimal excavations (such as connecting dugouts directly to the clubhouses) would be necessary for it to be ready for a big-league team. Although it was built primarily with baseball in mind, its general shape was very similar to the major league multi-purpose stadiums that were beginning to emerge in the mid-1960s. In fact, the stadium was designed to accommodate football, but the Dallas Cowboys were never interested in playing in the stadium. The Metroplex had been mentioned as a possible expansion site since the 1950s, and Arlington Mayor Tom Vandergriff figured that Arlington, halfway between the two cities, would be the best site for a prospective major league team.

===1970s–1980s===

In 1971, the struggling second incarnation of the Washington Senators announced their intentions to move to the Metroplex under the banner of the Texas Rangers. The stadium was expanded to seat over 35,700 people, and was renamed Arlington Stadium. The stadium played host to its first major league game on April 21, 1972, when the Rangers inaugurated the stadium by defeating the California Angels, 7–6; MLB&#x27;s first-ever strike had disrupted the start of the 1972 season, hence the later than anticipated opening day.

Arlington Stadium had no roof, and thus virtually no protection from the oppressive Texas heat. For nearly all of its existence, it was the hottest stadium in the majors. It was not unusual for game-time temperatures to be well above . Combined with the Rangers&#x27; mediocre performance, this held down attendance considerably during the 1970s. Due in part to the heat, the Rangers scheduled nearly all of their games from May through September at night to get around it. Other than nearby amusement park Six Flags Over Texas, there was no neighborhood around the park. In his book &quot;Storied Stadiums&quot;, Curt Smith described it as &quot;small, (but) not intimate&quot;.

The scoreboard in the Rangers&#x27; early days was a long, horizontal rectangle with a panel shaped like the state of Texas. It was replaced after the 1984 season with a new scoreboard and series of billboards that ran from both foul poles. &quot;Cotton-Eyed Joe&quot; was played during the seventh-inning stretch for fans to dance to instead of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot;. Arlington Stadium was also the first major league ballpark to sell nachos (in 1974).
===1990s===

The stadium eventually began to show its age and inadequacy, and the City of Arlington approved the construction of a new stadium for the Rangers. The last game was played in Arlington Stadium on October 3, 1993, resulting in a 4–1 win by the visiting Kansas City Royals, witnessed by 41,039 fans (it was also the final game in the career of Hall-of-Famer George Brett, who recorded the last hit in the stadium with a ninth-inning single). Following the season, the Rangers moved to The Ballpark in Arlington, which was built nearby, and Arlington Stadium was demolished in 1994. The foul poles and home plate from Arlington Stadium were moved to the new ballpark, along with some of the bleachers. The bleachers were painted green, but their original blue color is occasionally visible in spots where the green paint has chipped. Home plate was inserted into place at the Ballpark in Arlington by Tom Schieffer (Texas Rangers then president), Richard Greene (then mayor of Arlington), Tom Vandergriff (former mayor responsible for bringing the team to Arlington), and George W. Bush (then team part-owner; later Governor of Texas and President of the United States).

The site of the old stadium is just west of the Arlington Convention Center and north of the youth ballpark. It was partially paved in 2001 to provide parking for the Convention Center, and Legends Way was built through the center of the site in 2007 to provide an access road to the new Cowboys Stadium. The road was renamed AT&amp;T Way in 2013 along with the corporate renaming of Cowboys Stadium. About a quarter of the former stadium site remains unpaved and undeveloped as of 2019.

Prior to the 2016 season, the original foul poles from Arlington Stadium were replaced at then-Globe Life Park in Arlington.

As of 2022, part of the site has been redeveloped as part of the National Medal of Honor Museum.

===Notable moments===
Arlington Stadium never saw a playoff game or an All-Star Game, but was host to several of Nolan Ryan&#x27;s greatest moments, including his 5,000th strikeout and his seventh (and final) no-hitter. Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. and Rangers outfielder Oddibe McDowell, were the only two players to hit for the cycle in Arlington Stadium. It was also the site of the 11th perfect game in Major League Baseball history, when Mike Witt of the California Angels defeated the Rangers on September 30, 1984, 1–0.

A memorable brawl happened on August 4, 1993, when the Rangers hosted the Chicago White Sox. Ryan, the starter for that game, hit Robin Ventura with a pitch. Ventura decided to charge the mound, which emptied both benches. As Ventura reached the mound, Ryan immediately caught him in a head lock and punched him on the top of his head six times.

<text>West Vancouver is a district municipality in the province of British Columbia, Canada. A member municipality of the Metro Vancouver Regional District, West Vancouver is situated on the north shore of Burrard Inlet to the northwest of the city of Vancouver. With the District of North Vancouver and the City of North Vancouver, West Vancouver is part of a regional grouping known as the North Shore municipalities. It is among the wealthiest municipalities in Canada by average household net worth. 

West Vancouver is home to the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal, one of the main transportation hubs connecting the British Columbia mainland and Vancouver Island, and to much of Cypress Provincial Park.

== History ==
The Municipality of West Vancouver was incorporated on March 15, 1912, after separating from the District of North Vancouver. The first municipal election was held on April 6, 1912. In November 1938, the Lions Gate Bridge was opened to traffic, allowing extensive growth of the semi-populated community, previously only accessible by ferry. Some homes in West Vancouver date back to the 1920s and 30s, though most of the currently existing dwellings were built in the 1970s and 80s, and mostly in British Pacific Properties&#x27; developments.
