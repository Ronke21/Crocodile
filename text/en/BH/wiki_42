<text>is a city located in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 55,151 in 27684 households, and a population density of 890 persons per km². The total area of the city is . 

==Geography==
Nōgata is located in the northern part of Fukuoka Prefecture, at the northern tip of the Chikuhō region. It is located approximately 30 km southwest of the center of Kitakyūshū City and approximately 50 km northeast of Fukuoka City. The center of the city is a plain, located almost in the center of the Chikuhō Plain, and the Onga River, which combines the Hikoyama River and the Inunaki River, flows through it. The urban area is centered around the area sandwiched between the Onga River and the JR Kyushu Chikuhō Main Line (Fukuhoku Yutaka Line). The eastern and western regions are residential areas, the southern area is an industrial area, and the northern area is a rural area. In the eastern part of the city, the Fukuchi Mountains run north-south, and have an average elevation of 600 meters, including Mt. Takatori and Mt. Shakudake, centered around the main peak, Mt. Fukuchi (900.8 meters).

The average annual rainfall is 1560 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.7 °C, and lowest in January, at around 4.7 °C.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Nōgata is as shown below

==History==
The area of Nōgata was part of ancient Chikuzen Province. The oldest recorded meteorite fall occurred at Nōgata on May 19 in the year of 861. (:ja:直方隕石) In the Nara period, a settlement developed around the Shingon temple of Toren-ji. The temple was destroyed in the Muromachi period and was replaced by a castle occupied by Prince Kaneyoshi during the wars of the Nanboku-chō period. During the Edo Period, it was part of the holdings of Fukuoka Domain under the Kuroda clan. From 1675 to 1677 and again from 1688 to 1720, it was the site of Nōgata Domain, a sub-domain of Fukuoka Domain. Although the domain was subsumed back into Fukuoka Domain due to lack of succession, the merchants of Nōgata succeeded in re-routing the Nagasaki &quot;kaidō&quot; highway through what is now the city center. After the Meiji restoration, the villages of Fukuchi, Shimosakai, Tonno, Niiri, and Ueki were established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Ueki was raised to town status on March 14, 1900. On November 1, 1926, Fukuchi, Shimosakai, Tonno, and Shiniri merged to form the town of Nōgata. Nōgata was raised to city status on January 1, 1931, and absorbed the town of Ueki on March 31, 1955.

==Government==
Nōgata has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 19 members. Nōgata contributes one member to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Fukuoka 8th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
During the Meiji period, Nōgata, along with the other municipalities of the Chikuhō area, developed with the Kitakyushu industrial zone through coal mining, and is still considered part of to the Greater Kitakyushu Metropolitan Area. However, as the demand for coal decreased due to the energy revolution, the coal mines that had sponsored prosperity have all closed, leading to depopulation. The economic activity of the town is now a mixture of commerce and light manufacturing. Due to its proximity to Kitakyūshū, it is increasing becoming a commuter town.

==Education==
Nōgata has eleven public elementary schools and four public junior high schools operated by the city government and three public high schools operated by the Fukuoka Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private high school and the prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.

<doc id="329426" wikidata="Q60074" url="?curid=329426" title="Max Müller">
<text>Friedrich Max Müller (; 6 December 1823 – 28 October 1900) was a German-born British comparative philologist and Orientalist. He was one of the founders of the Western academic disciplines of Indology and religious studies. Müller wrote both scholarly and popular works on the subject of Indology. He directed the preparation of the &quot;Sacred Books of the East&quot;, a 50-volume set of English translations which continued after his death. 

Müller became a professor at Oxford University, first of modern languages, then of comparative philology in a position founded for him, and which he held for the rest of his life. Early in his career he held strong views on India, believing that it needed to be transformed by Christianity. Later, his view became more nuanced, championing ancient Sanskrit literature and India more generally. He became involved in several controversies during his career: he was accused of being anti-Christian; he disagreed with Darwinian evolution, favouring theistic evolution; he raised interest in Aryan culture, deeply disliking the resulting racist Aryanism; and he promoted the idea of a &quot;Turanian&quot; family of languages.

Among his honours and distinctions, he was made an &quot;associé étranger&quot; of the French &quot;Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres&quot;; he was awarded the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art; and he was made a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

== Early life and education ==

Max Müller was born into a cultured family on 6 December 1823 in Dessau, the son of Wilhelm Müller, a lyric poet whose verse Franz Schubert had set to music in his song-cycles &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot;, and &quot;Winterreise&quot;. His mother, Adelheid Müller (née von Basedow), was the eldest daughter of a prime minister of Anhalt-Dessau. Carl Maria von Weber was a godfather.

Müller was named after his mother&#x27;s elder brother, Friedrich, and after the central character, Max, in Weber&#x27;s opera &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;. Later in life, he adopted Max as a part of his surname, believing that the prevalence of Müller as a name made it too common. His name was recorded as &quot;Maximilian&quot; on some of his honours, and in some other publications.

Müller entered the gymnasium (grammar school) at Dessau when he was six years old. In 1835, at the age of twelve, he was sent to live in the house of Carl Gustav Carus and attend the Nicolai School at Leipzig, where he continued his studies of music and classics. It was during his time in Leipzig that he frequently met Felix Mendelssohn.

In need of a scholarship to attend Leipzig University, Müller successfully sat his abitur examination at Zerbst. While preparing, he found that the syllabus differed from what he had been taught, requiring him to rapidly learn mathematics, modern languages and science. He entered Leipzig University in 1841 to study philology, leaving behind his early interest in music and poetry. Müller received his Ph.D. degree in Sep 1843. His final dissertation was on Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot;. He had an aptitude for classical languages, learning Greek, Latin, Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit.

==Academic career==

In 1850 Müller was appointed deputy Taylorian professor of modern European languages at Oxford University. In the following year, at the suggestion of Thomas Gaisford, he was made an honorary M.A. and a member of the college of Christ Church, Oxford. On succeeding to the full professorship in 1854, he received the full degree of M.A. by a decree of Convocation. In 1858 he was elected to a life fellowship at All Souls&#x27; College.

He was defeated in the 1860 election for the position of Boden Professor of Sanskrit, which was a &quot;keen disappointment&quot; to him. Müller was far better qualified for the post than the other candidate, Monier Monier-Williams, but Müller&#x27;s theological views, Lutheranism, German birth, and lack of practical first-hand knowledge of India spoke against him. After the election he wrote to his mother, &quot;all the best people voted for me, the Professors almost unanimously, but the &quot;vulgus profanum&quot; made the majority&quot;.

Later in 1868, Müller became Oxford&#x27;s first professor of comparative philology, a position founded on his behalf. He held this chair until his death, although he retired from its active duties in 1875.

==Scholarly and literary works==

===Sanskrit studies===
In 1844, prior to commencing his academic career at Oxford, Müller studied in Berlin with Friedrich Schelling. He began to translate the &quot;Upanishads&quot; for Schelling, and continued to research Sanskrit under Franz Bopp, the first systematic scholar of the Indo-European languages (IE). Schelling led Müller to relate the history of language to the history of religion. At this time, Müller published his first book, a German translation of the &quot;Hitopadesa&quot;, a collection of Indian fables.

In 1845, Müller moved to Paris to study Sanskrit under Eugène Burnouf. Burnouf encouraged him to publish the complete Rigveda, making use of the manuscripts available in England. He moved to England in 1846 to study Sanskrit texts in the collection of the East India Company. He supported himself at first with creative writing, his novel &quot;German Love&quot; being popular in its day.

Müller&#x27;s connections with the East India Company and with Sanskritists based at Oxford University led to a career in Britain, where he eventually became the leading intellectual commentator on the culture of India. At the time, Britain controlled this territory as part of its Empire. This led to complex exchanges between Indian and British intellectual culture, especially through Müller&#x27;s links with the Brahmo Samaj.

Müller&#x27;s Sanskrit studies came at a time when scholars had started to see language development in relation to cultural development. The recent discovery of the Indo-European language group had started to lead to much speculation about the relationship between Greco-Roman cultures and those of more ancient peoples. In particular the Vedic culture of India was thought to have been the ancestor of European Classical cultures. Scholars sought to compare the genetically related European and Asian languages to reconstruct the earliest form of the root-language. The Vedic language, Sanskrit, was thought to be the oldest of the IE languages.

Müller devoted himself to the study of this language, becoming one of the major Sanskrit scholars of his day. He believed that the earliest documents of Vedic culture should be studied to provide the key to the development of pagan European religions, and of religious belief in general. To this end, Müller sought to understand the most ancient of Vedic scriptures, the &quot;Rig-Veda.&quot; Müller translated the book written by the 14th century Sanskrit scholar Sayanacharya from Sanskrit to English. Müller was greatly impressed by Ramakrishna Paramhansa, his contemporary and proponent of Vedantic philosophy, and wrote several essays and books about him.

For Müller, the study of the language had to relate to the study of the culture in which it had been used. He came to the view that the development of languages should be tied to that of belief-systems. At that time the Vedic scriptures were little-known in the West, though there was increasing interest in the philosophy of the Upanishads. Müller believed that the sophisticated Upanishadic philosophy could be linked to the primitive henotheism of early Vedic Brahmanism from which it evolved. He had to travel to London to look at documents held in the collection of the British East India Company. While there he persuaded the company to allow him to undertake a critical edition of the Rig-Veda, a task he pursued over many years (1849–1874). 

For Müller, the culture of the Vedic peoples represented a form of nature worship, an idea clearly influenced by Romanticism. Müller shared many of the ideas associated with Romanticism, which coloured his account of ancient religions, in particular his emphasis on the formative influence on early religion of emotional communion with natural forces. He saw the gods of the Rig-Veda as active forces of nature, only partly personified as imagined supernatural persons. From this claim Müller derived his theory that mythology is &quot;a disease of language&quot;. By this he meant that myth transforms concepts into beings and stories. In Müller&#x27;s view, &quot;gods&quot; began as words constructed to express abstract ideas, but were transformed into imagined personalities. Thus the Indo-European father-god appears under various names: Zeus, Jupiter, Dyaus Pita. For Müller all these names can be traced to the word &quot;&quot;Dyaus&quot;,&quot; which he understood to imply &quot;shining&quot; or &quot;radiance&quot;. This leads to the terms &quot;deva&quot;, &quot;deus&quot;, &quot;theos&quot; as generic terms for a god, and to the names &quot;Zeus&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot; (derived from deus-pater). In this way a metaphor becomes personified and fixed.

===Gifford Lectures===

In 1888, Müller was appointed Gifford Lecturer at the University of Glasgow. These Gifford Lectures were the first in an annual series, given at several Scottish universities, that has continued to the present day. Over the next four years, Müller gave four series of lectures. The titles and order of the lectures were as follows:

# Natural Religion. This first course of lectures was intended as purely introductory, and had for its object a definition of Natural Religion in its widest sense.
# Physical Religion. This second course of lectures was intended to show how different nations had arrived at a belief in something infinite behind the finite, in something invisible behind the visible, in many unseen agents or gods of nature, until they reached a belief in one god above all those gods. In short, a history of the discovery of the infinite in nature.
# Anthropological Religion. This third course was intended to show how different nations arrived at a belief in a soul, how they named its various faculties, and what they imagined about its fate after death.
# Theosophy or Psychological Religion. The fourth and last course of lectures was intended to examine the relation between God and the soul (&quot;these two Infinites&quot;), including the ideas that some of the principal nations of the world have formed concerning this relation. Real religion, Müller asserted, is founded on a true perception of the &quot;relation&quot; of the soul to God and of God to the soul; Müller wanted to prove that this was true, not only as a postulate, but as an historical fact. The original title of the lectures was &#x27;Psychological Religion&#x27; but Müller felt compelled to add &#x27;Theosophy&#x27; to it. Müller&#x27;s final Gifford Lecture is significant in interpreting his work broadly, as he situates his philological and historical research within a Hermetic and mystical theological project.

===As translator===
In 1881, he published a translation of the first edition of Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. He agreed with Schopenhauer that this edition was the most direct and honest expression of Kant&#x27;s thought. His translation corrected several errors that were committed by previous translators. In his Translator&#x27;s Preface, Müller wrote:

Müller continued to be influenced by the Kantian Transcendentalist model of spirituality, and was opposed to Darwinian ideas of human development. He argued that &quot;language forms an impassable barrier between man and beast.&quot;

==Views on India==
===Early career===
On 25 August 1866, Müller wrote to Chevalier Bunsen:
In his career, Müller several times expressed the view that a &quot;reformation&quot; within Hinduism needed to occur, comparable to the Christian Reformation. In his view, &quot;if there is one thing which a comparative study of religions places in the clearest light, it is the inevitable decay to which every religion is exposed... Whenever we can trace back a religion to its first beginnings, we find it free from many blemishes that affected it in its later states&quot;.

He used his links with the Brahmo Samaj to encourage such a reformation on the lines pioneered by Ram Mohan Roy. Müller believed that the Brahmos would engender an Indian form of Christianity and that they were in practice &quot;Christians, without being Roman Catholics, Anglicans or Lutherans&quot;. In the Lutheran tradition, he hoped that the &quot;superstition&quot; and idolatry, which he considered to be characteristic of modern popular Hinduism, would disappear.

Müller wrote: 
The translation of the &quot;Veda&quot; will hereafter tell to a great extent on the fate of India, and on the growth of millions of souls in that country. It is the root of their religion, and to show them what the root is, I feel sure, is the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the last 3,000 years... one ought to be up and doing what may be God&#x27;s work.

Müller hoped that increased funding for education in India would promote a new form of literature combining Western and Indian traditions. In 1868 he wrote to George Campbell, the newly appointed Secretary of State for India:

===Late career===
In his sixties and seventies, Müller gave a series of lectures, which reflected a more nuanced view in favour of Hinduism and the ancient literature from India. In his &quot;What can India teach us?&quot; lecture at University of Cambridge, he championed ancient Sanskrit literature and India as follows:

Müller conjectured that the introduction of Islam in India in the 11th century had a deep effect on the psyche and behaviour of Hindus in another lecture, &quot;Truthful Character of the Hindus&quot;:

Swami Vivekananda, who was the foremost disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, met Müller over a lunch on 28 May 1896. Regarding Müller and his wife, the Swami later wrote:

==Controversies==
===Anti-Christian===
During the course of his Gifford Lectures on the subject of natural religion, Müller was severely criticised for being anti-Christian. In 1891, at a meeting of the Established Presbytery of Glasgow, Mr. Thomson (Minister of Ladywell) moved a motion that Müller&#x27;s teaching was &quot;subversive of the Christian faith, and fitted to spread pantheistic and infidel views amongst the students and others&quot; and questioned Müller&#x27;s appointment as lecturer. An even stronger attack on Müller was made by Monsignor Alexander Munro in St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral. Munro, an officer of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland (and Provost of the Catholic Cathedral of Glasgow from 1884 to 1892), declared that Müller&#x27;s lectures &quot;were nothing less than a crusade against Divine revelation, against Jesus Christ, and against Christianity&quot;. The blasphemous lectures were, he continued, &quot;the proclamation of atheism under the guise of pantheism&quot; and &quot;uprooted our idea of God, for it repudiated the idea of a personal God&quot;.

Similar accusations had already led to Müller&#x27;s exclusion from the Boden chair in Sanskrit in favour of the conservative Monier Monier-Williams. By the 1880s Müller was being courted by Charles Godfrey Leland, Theosophist Helena Blavatsky, and other writers who were seeking to assert the merits of pagan religious traditions over Christianity. The designer Mary Fraser Tytler stated that Müller&#x27;s book &quot;Chips from a German Workshop&quot; (a collection of his essays) was her &quot;Bible&quot;, which helped her to create a multi-cultural sacred imagery.

Müller distanced himself from these developments, and remained within the Lutheran faith in which he had been brought up. According to G. Beckerlegge, &quot;Müller&#x27;s background as a Lutheran German and his identification with the Broad Church party&quot; led to &quot;suspicion by those opposed to the political and religious positions that they felt Müller represented&quot;, particularly his latitudinarianism.

Although Müller took a strong religious and academic interest in Hinduism and other non-Christian religions, and often compared Christianity to religions that many traditional Protestants would have regarded as primitive or false, he grounded his Perennialism in a belief that Christianity possessed the fullest truth of all living religions. Twenty-first century scholars of religion, far from accusing Müller of being anti-Christian, have critically examined Müller&#x27;s theological project as evidence for a bias towards Christian conceptions of God in early academic religious studies.

===Darwin disagreement===

Müller attempted to formulate a philosophy of religion that addressed the crisis of faith engendered by the historical and critical study of religion by German scholars on the one hand, and by the Darwinian revolution on the other. He was wary of Darwin&#x27;s work on human evolution, and attacked his view of the development of human faculties. His work was taken up by cultural commentators such as his friend John Ruskin, who saw it as a productive response to the crisis of the age. He analyzed mythologies as rationalisations of natural phenomena, primitive beginnings that we might denominate &quot;protoscience&quot; within a cultural evolution. Müller proposed an early, mystical interpretation of theistic evolution, using Darwinism as a critique of mechanical philosophy.

In 1870 Müller gave a short course of three lectures for the British Institution on language as the barrier between man and beast, which he called &quot;On Darwin&#x27;s Philosophy of Language&quot;. Müller specifically disagreed with Darwin&#x27;s theories on the origin of language and that the language of man could have developed from the language of animals. In 1873, he sent a copy of his lectures to Darwin reassuring him that, though he differed from some of Darwin&#x27;s conclusions, he was one of his &quot;diligent readers and sincere admirers&quot;.

===Aryanism===

Müller&#x27;s work contributed to the developing interest in Aryan culture, which often set Indo-European (&quot;Aryan&quot;) traditions in opposition to Semitic religions. He was &quot;deeply saddened by the fact that these classifications later came to be expressed in racist terms&quot;, as this was far from his intention. For Müller, the discovery of common Indian and European ancestry was a powerful argument against racism, arguing that &quot;an ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar&quot; and that &quot;the blackest Hindus represent an earlier stage of Aryan speech and thought than the fairest Scandinavians&quot;.

===Turanian===

Müller put forward and promoted the theory of a &quot;Turanian&quot; family of languages or speech, comprising the Finnic, Samoyedic, &quot;Tataric&quot; (Turkic), Mongolic and Tungusic languages. According to Müller, these five languages were those &quot;spoken in Asia or Europe not included under the Arian [sic] and Semitic families, with the exception perhaps of the Chinese and its dialects&quot;. In addition, they were &quot;nomadic languages,&quot; in contrast to the other two families (Aryan and Semitic), which he called State or political languages.

The idea of a Turanian family of languages was not accepted by everyone at the time. Although the term &quot;Turanian&quot; quickly became an archaism (unlike &quot;Aryan&quot;), it did not disappear completely. The idea was absorbed later into nationalist ideologies in Hungary and Turkey.

== Honours and distinctions ==

In 1869, Müller was elected to the French &quot;Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres&quot; as a foreign correspondent (&quot;associé étranger&quot;).

In June 1874, Müller was awarded the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; (civil class), much to his surprise. Soon after, when he was commanded to dine at Windsor, he wrote to Prince Leopold to ask if he &quot;might&quot; wear his Order, and the wire came back, &quot;Not &quot;may&quot;, but &quot;must&quot;.&quot;

In 1875, Müller was awarded the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art. The award is given to acknowledge excellent and outstanding achievements in the field of science and art. In a letter to his mother dated 19 December, Müller wrote that the award was more showy than the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, &quot;but that is the best&quot;.

In 1896, Müller was appointed a member of the Privy Council.

==Personal life==

Müller became a naturalised British citizen in 1855, at the age of 32. He married Georgina Adelaide Grenfell on 3 August 1859 after overcoming the opposition from her family. The couple had four children, including William Grenfell. Two of their children predeceased them.

==Death and legacy==

Müller&#x27;s health began deteriorating in 1898 and he died at his home in Oxford on 28 October 1900. He was interred at Holywell Cemetery on 1 November 1900.

After his death a memorial fund, the Max Müller Memorial Fund, was opened at Oxford for &quot;the promotion of learning and research in all matters relating to the history and archaeology, the languages, literatures, and religions of ancient India&quot;.

Harry Smith stated of his film &quot;Heaven and Earth Magic&quot;: &quot;The first part depicts the heroine&#x27;s toothache consequent to the loss of a valuable watermelon, her dentistry and transportation to heaven. Next follows an elaborate exposition of the heavenly land in terms of Israel, Montreal and the second part depicts the return to earth from being eaten by Max Müller on the day Edward the Seventh dedicated the Great Sewer of London.&quot;

The Goethe Institutes in India are named Max Müller Bhavan in his honour, as is a street (Max Mueller Marg) in New Delhi.

Müller&#x27;s biographies include , and .
Nirad C. Chaudhuri&#x27;s &quot;Scholar Extraordinary&quot; was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for English by Sahitya Akademi, India&#x27;s National Academy of Letters. In addition, Stephen G. Alter&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;William Dwight Whitney and the Science of Language&quot; contains a chapter on Müller&#x27;s rivalry with the American linguist William Dwight Whitney.

<text>Rimouski ( ; ) is a city in Quebec, Canada. Rimouski is located in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region, at the mouth of the Rimouski River. It has a population of 48,935 (as of 2021). Rimouski, whose motto is &quot;Legi patrum fidelis&quot; (Faithful to the law of our fathers), is located on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence Estuary, around 300 km downstream of Quebec City. It is the site of Université du Québec à Rimouski (UQAR), the Cégep de Rimouski (which includes the Institut maritime du Québec) and the Music Conservatory. It is also the home of some ocean sciences research centres (see below).

==History==
The name Rimouski most likely derived from a Micmac word meaning &quot;land of the moose&quot;. The city was founded by Sir René Lepage de Ste-Claire in 1696. Originally from Ouanne in the Burgundy region, he exchanged property he owned on the Île d&#x27;Orléans with Augustin Rouer de la Cardonnière for the Seigneurie of Rimouski, which extended along the St. Lawrence River from the Hâtée River at Le Bic to the Métis River. De la Cardonnière had been the owner of Rimouski since 1688, but had never lived there. René Lepage moved his family to Rimouski, where it held the seigneurie until 1790, when it was sold to the Quebec City businessman Joseph Drapeau.
The &quot;Maison Lamontagne&quot; was built in 1750 per Marie-Agnès Lepage, granddaughter of René Lepage de Ste-Claire. It carries now the surname of the family that resided at it in 1844. It is one of the oldest half-timbered houses in Quebec and is within what is now called the District of Rimouski-Est.

Today, a boulevard, park and monument at the western entrance of Rimouski bear the name of René Lepage.

===The &quot;Red Night&quot;===
On May 6, 1950, Rimouski suffered a severe fire, in which 319 houses burned to the ground. This event is known as &quot;La nuit rouge&quot; (French for &quot;Red Night&quot;). The fire originated in the yard on the left shore of the Rimouski River and quickly crossed the river and spread throughout the city pushed by strong winds, destroying half of the city. No one died in the blaze. Legend has it that a priest sprinkled holy water around the city&#x27;s cathedral and that the fire would not cross the line.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Rimouski has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with cold, snowy winters and warm, rainy summers.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Rimouski had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
The 2021 census found that French was the mother tongue of 97.2% of the population. The next most common mother tongues were English (0.8%), Spanish (0.3%), Arabic (0.2%), and Swahili (0.1%).

==Economy==
===Maritime sector===
One of Rimouski&#x27;s primary economic fields is its maritime sector. Around 1900, the port was important for operating mail tenders such as &quot;HMCS Lady Evelyn&quot; for transatlantic liners. These could take mail from an arriving ship in the mouth of the St Lawrence, then speed it by rail to Quebec, arriving long before the ship. The town welcomes students at the Institut Maritime du Québec, which offers exclusively marine-related programs of studies. Rimouski is also the home of many marine research centres, such as the Institut des sciences de la mer (ISMER), the Centre de recherche sur les biotechnologies marines and the Centre interdisciplinaire de développement en cartographie des océans.

Rimouski is also home to the headquarters of the St. Lawrence Global Observatory,[2] an inter-institutional group seeking to provide, through its Internet portal, an integrated and rapid access to data and information concerning the global ecosystem of the St. Lawrence, in order to promote sustainable management.

A ferry used to cross over from Forestville twice daily from May to September, but it is not currently running.

The port operates five berths ranging from 130 to 213 metres in length, with a water depth of 7.3 metres, and is mainly used for the transshipment of salt.

<doc id="329428" wikidata="Q328605" url="?curid=329428" title="Iizuka, Fukuoka">
<text>is a city in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 124,757 in 63833 households, and a population density of 580 persons per km². The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Iizuka is the central city of the Chikuho region located in the center of Fukuoka Prefecture, approximately 35 kilometers east of Fukuoka City and approximately 40 kilometers southwest of the center of Kitakyushu City. The Onga River, a first-class river, flows through the central part of the city, and the area forms an urban area. From the northwestern part of the city to the western and southwestern parts of the city, there are mountains ranging in height from 400 to 900 meters, including Mt. Mikoriyama (935.9 meters) and Mt. Toishi (828 meters). There are also several mountains in the eastern part of the city that are between 200 and 300 meters high, forming a small mountain range. Therefore, the central and northern parts of the city are a basin surrounded by mountains. Yagiyama Pass and Shokegoe on the western edge of the city, and Hiyomizu Pass on the southern edge of the city were difficult areas for transportation until roads were developed.

The average annual rainfall is 1560 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.4 °C, and lowest in January, at around 4.0 °C. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is much higher in summer than in winter.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Iizuka is as shown below

==History==
The area of Iizuka was part of ancient Chikuzen Province. Rice has been cultivated in the fertile alluvial plains of the Onga River system since the Yayoi Period, and ancient kofun are scattered throughout the area. During the Edo Period it was part of the holdings of Fukuoka Domain. After the Meiji restoration, the town of Iizuka was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Iizuka was raised to city status on January 20, 1932. On March 26, 2006, Iizuka absorbed the towns of Chikuho, Honami, Kaita and Shōnai (all from Kaho District) to create the new and expanded city of Iizuka. 

==Government==
Iizuka has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 28 members. Iizuka, together with the town of Keisen contributes two members to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Fukuoka 8th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan, the country&#x27;s legislature.

== Economy ==
Iizuka was an important post-station on the Nagasaki Kaidō during the Edo Era. As Japan industrialised, Iizuka became the center of the most productive coal fields in Japan located throughout the surrounding Chikuho district. After the end of Second World War there was a large influx of people into the city as it was one of the few areas that offered a large number of jobs in the coal mines and related fields. Since the coal mines closed, Iizuka City has suffered from a consistently declining population base. However, its proximity to both Fukuoka City and Kitakyushu City cushioned the effect of the coal industry shutdown and kept the local economy from going into freefall. Now Iizuka has a strong light industrial base and is a center for education and a rapidly expanding IT economy.

==Education==
Iizuka has 22 public elementary schools and 9 public junior high schools operated by the city government and one private elementary and one private junior high school. There are one public junior high school and two public high schools operated by the Fukuoka Prefectural Board of Education, and also two private high schools. The prefecture also operates two schools for the handicapped. Kindai University has a junior college in Iizuka.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Yame in 2020 is 60,608 people. Yame has been conducting censuses since 1950.

==History==
The area of Yame was part of ancient Chikugo Province. It has been inhabited since ancient times, and many ruins from the Jōmon period to the Yayoi period have been discovered, as well as more than 300 kofun burial mounds from the Kofun period. A powerful ancient state existed in the Yame region, and it was the center of the Iwai Rebellion of 527 AD against the Yamato court. The Iwatoyama Kofun, located in northern Yame, is said to be the tomb of the leader of that rebellion and is the largest keyhole-shaped tumulus in northern Kyushu. During the Edo Period, Fukushima Castle in Yame was one of the largest flatland-style Japanese castles in the region and had a three-story &quot;tenshu&quot;. It was destroyed in 1615 after the area became part of Kurume Domain, but the &quot;jōkamachi&quot; survived to be one of the largest merchant towns within Kurume Domain. Many traditional buildings from the Edo period to modern times remain along the streets, mainly lacquered houses. After the Meiji restoration, the town of Fukushima was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. In 1943, during World War II, Fukushima was proposed as a site for relocating the capital of Japan.

On April 1, 1954 was raised to city status.. Initially, it was planned to name the city &quot;Chikugo-Fukushima,&quot; but due to possible confusion with neighbouring Chikugo city, it was decided to name the city &quot;Yame&quot; instead. At that time, there was a strong opposition to the name from the residents of the former Fukushima town.

On October 1, 2006 the town of Jōyō (from Yame District) was merged into Yame. On February 1, 2010, the towns of Kurogi and Tachibana, and the villages of Hoshino and Yabe (all from Yame District) were merged into Yame.

==Government==
Yame has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 22 members. Yame, collectively with the town of Hirokawa, contributes three members to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Fukuoka 7th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
The economy of Yame is overwhelmingly based on agriculture. Yame is a center of traditional craft industries and its total production of traditional crafts is the largest in Kyushu. These include &quot;washi&quot; paper, and various &quot;Chōchin&quot; lanterns, &quot;Butsudan&quot;, and Japanese umbrellas, and Tōrō lantern made from tuff from Mount Aso.

==Education==
Yame has 13 public elementary schools, eight public junior high schools and two vocational training schools operated by the city government. The city has two public high schools operated by the Fukuoka Prefectural Board of Education. There are also one private junior high and two private high schools.

==Transportation==
===Railways===
Yame no longer has any passenger railway service. The nearest train stations to the city are JR Kyushu Hainuzuka Station or Nishitetsu Kurume Station, the former of which is about 20 minutes away from Fukushima in the city center by bus. The latter is about 30 minutes by bus.

<doc id="329441" wikidata="Q557643" url="?curid=329441" title="Mission, British Columbia">
<text>Mission is a city in the Lower Mainland of the province of British Columbia, Canada. It was originally incorporated as a district municipality in 1892, growing to include additional villages and rural areas over the years, adding the original Town of Mission City, long an independent core of the region, in 1969. It is bordered by the city of Abbotsford to the south and the city of Maple Ridge to the west. To the east are the unincorporated areas of Hatzic and Dewdney.

It is situated on the north bank of the Fraser River, backing onto mountains and lakes overlooking the Central Fraser Valley southeast of Vancouver.

==Geography==
Unlike the other Fraser Valley municipalities, Mission is mostly forested upland with only small floodplains lining the shore of the Fraser River. Some benches of farmland rise in succession northwards above the core developed area of the city. Mission was once the heart of the berry industry in the Fraser Valley, with &quot;Home of the Big Red Strawberry&quot; as Mission&#x27;s slogan in the 1930s and into the 1940s.

The more southerly portion of the municipality is bounded on the west by the lower reaches of the Stave River, which consists mostly of the lakewaters of two hydroelectric reservoirs, Stave Lake and Hayward Lake. Although the vast majority of the population of Mission lives well to the east of the Stave, over 50% of the northern land area of the municipality is west and north of that river; its extreme northwest corner is on the far side of upper Alouette Lake. A small portion of the lower Stave still runs free in its last two miles before its confluence with the Fraser at Ruskin; its last three-quarters of a mile forms the border with the larger municipality of Maple Ridge to the west.

Over 40% of Mission is tree farm, making it one of two communities with municipal tree farms (the other being Revelstoke, with a much smaller and newer farm). Mission&#x27;s tree farm celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008. It comprises much of the northern part of the district, including the area west of the Stave River, up to the district&#x27;s northern boundary near the foot of Mount Robie Reid; a small sliver of Mission District is at the head of Alouette Lake (normally thought of as being in Maple Ridge).

The eastern boundary of the municipality roughly coincides with the division between the Mission upland and the alluvial floodplain of Hatzic Prairie, which resembles much of the rest of the Fraser Valley Lowland. The unincorporated communities from Hatzic eastwards through Dewdney and Nicomen Island to Deroche are part of the social and commercial matrix centred on Mission but have never joined the municipality, as is also the case with areas north of Hatzic and Dewdney such as McConnell Creek and Durieu; the local economy and societies are built on dairy, berry and corn farming as well as a large First Nations community at the Indian Reserves of the Leq&#x27; a: mel First Nation, formerly known as the Lakahahmen First Nation, on Nicomen Island and Deroche.

==Government==
Mission was incorporated in 1892 and is in size. In 1922 the District of Mission was partitioned by the creation of the Village of Mission, which later became the Village of Mission City, then the Town of Mission City, until amalgamated with the District by plebiscite in 1969.

The City of Mission uses the current Council-Manager system of local government. The present Council, was elected on October 15, 2022. The current mayor is Paul Horn. A notable past mayor is Pam Alexis who resigned as the mayor of Mission in November 2020 after winning a seat for the provincial riding of Abbotsford-Mission in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia.

==History==
The Town of Mission City took its name from the local St. Mary&#x27;s Mission and Residential School established earlier in 1861 and began as a land promotion. The town&#x27;s core commercial properties and residential streets were auctioned off through James Horne&#x27;s auction, the &quot;Great Land Sale&quot; May 19, 1891, with buyers brought in via the CPR mainline from Vancouver as well as from Eastern Canada. Soon afterwards, Harry Brown French, an American from New York, came to the city and founded the Mission Regional Chamber of Commerce on June 19, 1893. It was the first Board of Trade in B.C.&quot; Some of the early houses and commercial buildings were, in fact, specifically designed to be reminiscent of small towns in southern Ontario in order to encourage buyers. Hailed at the time as a new metropolis, the fledgling town&#x27;s location at the junction of the Canadian Pacific Railway mainline with a northward extension of the Burlington Northern Railroad brought name suggestions that included East Vancouver and North Seattle. The name Mission City was chosen due to the site&#x27;s proximity to the historic St. Mary&#x27;s Mission of the Oblate order just east of town, which was founded in 1868 (now the Peckquaylis Indian Reserve).

At the time of founding, the swing-span Mission Railway Bridge opened in 1891 was the only crossing of the Fraser River in the Fraser Valley below the Alexandra Bridge, and all rail traffic between Vancouver and the United States was necessarily routed through Mission until the New Westminster Bridge at New Westminster was built in 1904. The rail bridge at Mission doubled duty as a one-way alternating vehicular bridge until 1973, when a long-promised new Mission Bridge was finally completed. The bridge&#x27;s location is geographically important at the head of the tidal bore on the Fraser River, and its water level gauge is an important measure of the Fraser&#x27;s annual and sometimes dangerously large spring freshet.
Mission City&#x27;s original retail core was in the small area of lowland between the CPR mainline and the river. Following the great flood of 1894 a few years after the town&#x27;s founding, the core was relocated just north of the rail line at the foot of the hillside rising above the rail junction. This small commercial strip, originally named Washington Avenue, later Main Street and since the 1980s called First Avenue, is only four or five blocks long and was one of the principal commercial centres of the Fraser Valley for many decades and had a lively retail trade and social life. Following the 1894 flood, abandoned buildings and lots in the old downtown were taken over by Chinese merchants and workers, creating a Chinatown which lasted until the 1920s.

The western part of the district, the Stave Valley, is largely rural and forested but its watercourse is home to what was the largest hydroelectric project in British Columbia until the Bridge River Power Project opened in 1961. It was built by the British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) to provide power to the electric street railway and interurban system in Vancouver. The Stave Falls Power Co. operated a light-gauge railway for passenger and freight service up the lower canyon of the river to the dam at Stave Falls. During the construction of the Ruskin Dam (completed 1931) the railway was rebuilt at a higher elevation so as to skirt the new Hayward Lake reservoir. The rail line has long been discontinued, but the old grade and its trestles are now part of a recreation trail circling the reservoir.

Flanking the outraces of the powerhouse at Stave Falls there was once a fairly large community (300 houses), which was served by the railway via connections to the CPR line at Ruskin, although the (then very rough) Dewdney Trunk Road used the dam to cross the Stave River. Population in the Stave Falls area is now away from the dams, west along the Dewdney Trunk towards Maple Ridge, in a rural farm-and-wilderness area south of Rolley Lake Provincial Park.

Up against the Maple Ridge boundary near the waterfront on the west side of the Stave, and halfway between the dam and the mills at Ruskin, was a large drive-in theatre for many years. It is now a large trailer park, and the most populated of Ruskin&#x27;s neighbourhoods.

The building of the Highway 1 freeway on the south side of the Fraser in the early 1960s brought huge population growth and large shopping malls to formerly rural Abbotsford, Matsqui, Sumas and Langley; as a result Mission lost its &quot;anchor&quot;, the main Eaton&#x27;s department store in the Valley, and the town&#x27;s Main Street businesses lost much of their business to the new shopping malls a few minutes away across the river. This process was accelerated with the opening of the new bridge in the mid-1970s.

Despite a cohesive business community and new retail malls on the edges of the old core, Mission&#x27;s retail community has never regained its former prominence in the Fraser Valley. Burgeoning &quot;exurban&quot; population growth connected with the rapid growth of the population of the Lower Mainland and encouraged by a new commuter rail line direct to downtown Vancouver, the West Coast Express, has reversed this trend.
Outside of the core &quot;urban&quot; area, most of which had been the Town of Mission City, the former District of Mission was a collection of distinct rural communities, each with their own history and sometimes distinct ethnic flavour. Silverdale, west of Mission on the east bank of the lower Stave River, was homesteaded in the 1880s by Italian immigrants. Neighbouring Silverhill was founded by a Finnish Utopian sect who were superseded by Scandinavian and German settlers following a forest fire that virtually wiped out the Finns.

Steelhead, in the northern part of the district, was originally a weekend retreat for some of Vancouver&#x27;s press community. Other localities such as Ferndale, Cedar Valley and Hatzic were farming communities of mixed origin, with Europeans and anglicized French-Canadians alongside the usual English-Scottish Canadian mix typical of much of the Fraser Valley. Throughout the Mission area before World War II, there was a large Japanese-Canadian population involved in berry farming, logging and milling and in the fishery on the river.

In 1954, Benedictine monks obtained land near Mission, where they set up their Westminster Abbey and Seminary of Christ the King. They have lived there ever since, running their own farm and teaching high school and college men at the seminary.

The berry industry, formerly the district&#x27;s largest and most important, formed the heart of the town&#x27;s annual summer party, the Strawberry Festival. The Strawberry Festival began in 1946, when it was suggested by the Board of Trade. But with the impacts on this industry (relocation of the Japanese during wartime and the devastating flood of 1948), the strawberry theme was abandoned. The town acquired the rights to the Western Canada championships of the Soap Box Derby, which were held annually in a specially built facility until 1973; the Derby has been revived in the new millennium.

Mission&#x27;s other major industry was logging, and the town&#x27;s several mills were noted for being the world&#x27;s largest suppliers of red cedar shakes and shingles. The District of Mission has operated for many years its own tree farm, covering most of its northern and northwestern mountainous forests. This tree farm served as a model for silvicultural management on a larger scale throughout British Columbia as well as provided a unique income source for the municipality. From 1967 through the 1970s, the Soap Box Derby shared the July 1 Dominion Day holiday with a large Loggers Sports event, one of the largest in British Columbia and important on the North American Loggers Sports Association circuit.

In the 1960s and 1970s there was a large cluster of productive mills on the waterfront in Mission, for many years world capital of red cedar shake production (the mill at Whonnock outproduced the largest of the Mission mills, but Mission&#x27;s city of mills was the largest overall producer). Nearby Eddy Match Co., between Mission and Hatzic, was the largest matchstick-making plant in the world until it closed in the 1960s; its only rival was in Hull, Quebec.

Adjoining it was the Empress Foods Co. cannery, the survivor of the struggles of the berry industry in the Central Fraser Valley, and dating from the days of Mission&#x27;s supremacy as strawberry capital of the valley before the 1948 Fraser River flood wiped it out. In more recent times one of these buildings was for a while converted into the province&#x27;s largest marijuana grow-op, in a scandal involving one of the town&#x27;s wealthiest families.

Mission is noted as the home of a long-established professional dragstrip, Mission Raceway Park, which was moved in relatively recent times outside the dyking of the lower part of town to reduce noise in residential and commercial areas nearby.

In 1972 a large tract of land in central Mission&#x27;s Ferndale area, flat upland at the top of the slope above downtown, was acquired by the federal government and developed into two large penal facilities. One is a minimum security facility, and the other is a medium security prison. The northern part of the district, and the wilds of the Stave River basin to the north of it, are home to a few wilderness work camps for young offenders and low-risk convicts; these camps have over recent decades participated in the ongoing clearing of vast forests of flooded-out trees from the inundated areas of Stave Lake, opening the lake to water recreation and public exploration.

In the 1990s, The Junction Shopping Centre, Mission&#x27;s largest shopping centre located near the southern tip, was opened to the public.

On March 29, 2021, the District of Mission was reclassified as a city.

==Economy==
Historically, forestry, hydroelectricity and agriculture were Mission&#x27;s chief resource sectors and provided the basis for varied related retail and service activities. In recent history, transportation improvements have enabled the manufacturing sector to expand beyond sawmilling and food processing.

Forest and wood related industries dominate the manufacturing sector, with an emphasis on redcedar shake and shingle mills. Mission also holds the only municipal tree farm license in British Columbia.

Agriculture is mostly restricted to a narrow belt along the Fraser River, and the unincorporated Dewdney-Deroche district east of Mission contains the majority of the farms in the area. There are about 96 commercial and hobby farms in the area. Dairy is the chief agricultural enterprise; other income sources include poultry, hogs, beef and vegetables.

Mission&#x27;s largest employer is the local school district, School District #75, and its second largest employer is the District (i.e. the municipality) itself.

==Transportation==

Transportation infrastructure includes Abbotsford-Mission Highway 11, and the Lougheed Highway 7. Mission is also accessible through commuter rail, the West Coast Express, which runs five trains in each direction a day, five days a week, between Vancouver and Mission City Station. Bus service in Mission is served by the Central Fraser Valley Transit System connecting with the City of Abbotsford, as well as TransLink with service to Coquitlam Central Station via route 701.
Three days per week Via Rail&#x27;s &quot;The Canadian&quot; provides eastbound flag stop service from Mission Harbour railway station.

Mission differs from some of the other Fraser Valley communities because of its access to the Fraser River. The Fraser near Mission is for the most part undeveloped and unspoiled which makes Mission the launch point for many water based activities that happen year round. Boat tours run from Mission&#x27;s docks on Harbour Avenue, which are also home to sport and commercial fishing vessels; the Fraser has famous salmon runs and population of green sturgeon.

==Climate==
Mission has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean. However, Mission has plentiful rainfall all year round, with a drying trend in the summer.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Mission had a population of 41,519 living in 14,098 of its 14,701 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 38,554. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Abbotsford - Mission CMA had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The community has a young population, with a median age of 36.4, according to the 2001 Canadian census,

===Ethnicity===
The largest group is European Canadian, comprising approximately 74% of the population, but even within that Mission&#x27;s ethnic makeup is very complex, with, in addition to British settlers, large numbers of Germans and Dutch, but also Finns, Norwegians and other Scandinavians, Italians, Hungarians, Poles, anglicized French-Canadians and others.

There is a sizeable First Nations community, forming 8.6% of the population. The Peckquaylis Indian Reserve, which is the former St. Mary&#x27;s Residential School and its grounds, is a centre for services and governments of the communities in the area to the east.
The largest visible minority group in Mission are South Asians, primarily Indo-Canadians comprising 10.7% of the population. Mission&#x27;s Indo-Canadian community was active since the early 1900s. An Indo-Canadian volleyball team, &quot;Mission Sikhs&quot;, was active in the area. Naranjan Grewall became the first Indo-Canadian elected to public office when he took a position in Mission City&#x27;s government. According to the 2021 Canadian census, the South Asian population in Mission stood at 4,330 persons, forming approximately 10.7% of the total population, up from 2,220 persons or 6.6% of the total population as of the 2006 Canadian census.

Mission&#x27;s Japanese Canadian community began in 1904, when Kumekichi Fujino moved to the city. Many &quot;issei&quot;, or first generation immigrants, included prospective farmers and &quot;picture brides&quot;, or women who communicated with suitors through the mail for the purpose of marriage. Organizations established in Mission included the Japanese Farmer&#x27;s Association (Nokai), established in 1916; the Mission Judo Club; the Mission Buddhist Church; and a Japanese Language School. The ethnic Japanese people in Mission had of land on 103 properties by 1930. During the pre-World War II era 30% of Mission&#x27;s public school enrollment consisted of ethnic Japanese. The Nokai had 79 members in 1942. The World War II-era Japanese Canadian internment disrupted Mission&#x27;s ethnic Japanese community as their properties were confiscated, and productivity decreased as the farms were managed by their new non-Japanese. Many Japanese chose not to move back to Mission in the post-war era, even though they were permitted to come back in 1949. In 2006 there were 145 Japanese living in Mission, making up 4.1% of the city&#x27;s visible minorities.
*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.

==Education==
School District 75 Mission operates public schools in the District of Mission and in the unincorporated areas to the east. Students from Deroche/Lake Errock, Dewdney, Nicomen Island, Hatzic Island and Hatzic Prairie/Durieu and McConnell Creek elementary schools attend post-secondary at Mission Secondary School.

The &quot;Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique&quot; operates one Francophone school: &quot;école des Deux-rives&quot; primary school.

==Sports==
Mission has a mix of sport offerings locally standard to any municipality in this region. One exception is the large outdoor trail network within the Tree Farm and Interpretive Forest. Mission is home to world-class mountain bike trails as well as plenty of backcountry hiking opportunities that lie within the District Limits.

Mission is home to a Pacific Junior Hockey League team - the Mission City Outlaws.

Mission is also home to the Mission Soccer Club (MSC), which was established in 1974 and celebrated 50 years in 2024. MSC calls the Mission Sports Park its home. MSC is a member of the BC Soccer Association and the Canadian Soccer Association. MSC&#x27;s programming is based on the Canadian Soccer Association and BC Soccer Association Long Term Player Development.

Mission&#x27;s soccer history is rich, with multiple successes in the Pakenham Cup and Presidents Cup. Mission has won the Pakenham Cup 4 times (1924, 1925, 1950, &amp; 1951) with the honours in 1951 split with Bradner FC. The reason is the longest Pakenham Final on record, lasting well over four hours. After a complete game and three overtime periods, Bradner and Mission decided to call it a draw and share honours. 

Mission&#x27;s Fraser Valley Soccer League Division 2 men&#x27;s team won the Presidents Cup in 2022 and are the current cup holders for 2024 after dominant displays throughout those tournaments. The same team was league champions in the Division 2A 2021-22 Season and the Division 2B 2022-23 Season.

==Kidnapping and murder of Jessica Russell==
Jessica Russell was a young Canadian girl who disappeared from a Vancouver suburb on the morning of May 4, 2000, and was found dead the next day after she was kidnapped and murdered by a 20 year old man whose name was David Trott as he ostensibly took her to school. She was found dead in an incinerated trailer near Mission, British Columbia.

Per Japanese census data, the population of Nakama is as shown below

==History==
The area of Nakama was part of ancient Chikuzen Province. It has been a thriving area for rice cultivation since ancient times, and many artifacts from the Yayoi period have been discovered. From the Kamakura period to the Muromachi period, the area of Nakama became the domain of the Aso clan. During the Edo Period the area was under the control of Fukuoka Domain. After the Meiji restoration, the village of Nagatsu (長津村) was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to town status on November 1, 1922, and changed its name to Nakama (中間町) on September 1, 1924. Nakama was raised to city status on November 1, 1958.

There were plans for amalgamation, with the city becoming a ward of Kitakyushu, which would have become Nakama-ku, Kitakyushu. A poll (December 2004) stated that 70% of the citizens of Nakama were in favor of the city being absorbed into Kitakyushu. However, on Christmas Eve 2004 Nakama city councilors rejected the merger plan, despite it having initially been proposed by Nakama. The councilors claim that they are rejecting the merger for the good of the city. The suspected main reason was that only 3 of the 21 councilors would be retained afterwards.

==Government==
Nakama has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 16 members. Nakama contributes one member to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Fukuoka 8th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
During the Meiji period, Nakama, along with the municipalities of the Chikuho area, developed with the Kitakyushu industrial zone through coal mining, and is still considered part of to the Greater Kitakyushu Metropolitan Area. However, as the demand for coal decreased due to the energy revolution, the coal mines that had sponsored prosperity have closed, leading to depopulation. The sites of the former coal mines has been developed into an industrial park. 

==Education==
Nakama has six public elementary schools and four public junior high schools operated by the city government and one public high school operated by the Fukuoka Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private high school, and the prefecture operates one special education school for the handicapped.

<text>The Gunnison grouse, Gunnison sage-grouse or lesser sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus) is a species of grouse endemic to the United States. It is similar to the closely related greater sage-grouse (&quot;Centrocercus urophasianus&quot;) in appearance, but about a third smaller in size, with much thicker plumes behind the head; it also has a less elaborate courtship dance. It is restricted in range to southwestern Colorado and extreme southeastern Utah, with the largest population residing in the Gunnison Basin region in Colorado. Despite being native to a country where the avifauna is relatively well known, it was overlooked until the 1990s due to the similarities with the sage grouse, and only described as a new species in 2000—making it the first new avian species to be described from the USA since the 19th century. The description of &quot;C. minimus&quot; as a separate species is supported by a molecular study of genetic variation, showing that gene flow between the large-bodied and the small-bodied birds is absent.

==Breeding==
Gunnison sage-grouse are notable for their elaborate courtship rituals. Each spring, males congregate on leks and perform a &quot;strutting display&quot;. Groups of females observe these displays and select the most attractive males with which to mate. Only a few males do most of the breeding. Males perform on leks for several hours in the early morning and evening during the spring. Leks are generally open areas adjacent to dense sagebrush stands, and the same lek may be used by grouse for decades.

==Conservation==
This species is in decline because of loss of habitat; their range has shrunk. Following petitions, the species was proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and was eventually protected as a threatened species starting on December 22, 2014. The known population size of this species remains quite small, and it was estimated that fewer than 4,000 individuals existed in when the species was successfully protected under the Act. A 2019 survey found the population in Colorado to be reduced to an estimated 1,800 birds with only around 429 reproductive males, a record low for the species since surveys began.

==Distribution==
Gunnison sage-grouse occur in seven counties in southwestern Colorado and one county in southeastern Utah. It was once found in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, but is now extirpated in those states.

==Life cycle==
Males gather on the lek or strutting grounds, which are small, open areas where breeding occurs, in late February to April, as soon as the lek is relatively free of snow. Only a few dominant males, usually two, breed. After mating, the hen leaves the lek for the nesting grounds. Clutch size ranges from six to eight eggs; incubation time is 25 to 27 days. Sage-grouse apparently have high rates of nest desertion and nest predation. Chicks are precocial and can feed themselves.

==Preferred habitat==
Gunnison sage-grouse are totally dependent on sagebrush-dominated habitats. Sagebrush is a crucial component of the adult&#x27;s diet year-round, and they select sagebrush almost exclusively for cover. However, in order to rear a brood of chicks, the young require high protein broadleaved plants and wildflowers that bring insects, also for protein. However, cattle and sheep also relish these plants, and the removal of these critical chick-food plants is a major reason for this bird&#x27;s decline.

== History ==
The area of Ōnojō is located in former Chikuzen Province and has had strong ties with Hakata and Dazaifu since ancient times. The city takes its name from Ōno Castlem which was built in the Asuka Period to protect Daizaifu against possible invasion by Silla and Tang China. Nearby Mizuki Castle also served the same purpose. The city area also has many other ruins, including the Ushikubi Sue Ware Kiln Site, from a time when this area was a major producer of Sue ware pottery. During the Edo Period, it was largely under the control of Fukuoka Domain. 

After the Meiji restoration, the village of Ōno was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to town status on October 10, 1951 and changed its name to Ōnojō on being raised to city status on April 1, 1972.

==Government==

== Economy ==
Ōnojō is largely a commuter town for Fukuoka City, with almost half the full-time residents of the city commuting to work or school within Fukuoka City, daily. The city also is a commercial center and has light manufacturing. At the beginning of the 21st century the area has seen continued real estate development partly due to good infrastructure, unlike more rural parts of the prefecture. The retailers Seiyu Group and Aeon have stores in the area, as do several conbini chains. Central Ōnojō is on the flight path to Fukuoka airport, so noise pollution can be a problem.

<text>Penticton ( ) is a city in the Okanagan Valley of the Southern Interior of British Columbia, Canada, situated between Okanagan and Skaha lakes. In the 2016 Canadian Census, its population was 33,761, while its census agglomeration population was 43,432.

==Name origin==
The name Penticton is derived from a word in the Okanagan language. It is conventionally translated as &quot;a place to stay forever&quot; but is actually a reference to the year-round flow of Okanagan Lake through Penticton where it enters Skaha Lake. Differing accounts of the meaning are given in the BC Geographical Names entry for the city:


==History==

The site of the city was first settled by the Syilx (Okanagan people), of the Interior Salish languages group, who initially named the community Phthauntac, meaning the &quot;ideal meeting place&quot;, followed by Penticton, meaning a &quot;place to stay forever&quot;, or officially &quot;a place where people live year-round&quot; in the Okanagan language. They settled around the city&#x27;s two lakes: Skaha Lake and Okanagan Lake; the former was originally known as Dog Lake. Their descendants form the Penticton Indian Band, a First Nations government part of the Okanagan Nation Alliance situated near Penticton.

In 1866, Irishman Thomas Ellis and his family travelled to Penticton, and became the first white settlers. He started to develop a community by building a cattle empire, and planting fruit trees. The Penticton Hotel was established in 1892 by Ellis, who positioned it around the local government area, and its first road: Front Street. The sidewalks on the street were made from wood, with coal oil lamps being introduced to the sidewalk. Ellis and his relatives retired in 1892, and sold a portion of their land to property dealers. Around this time, a number of European fur traders travelled through Penticton and the surrounding communities.

The sternwheeler SS &quot;Aberdeen&quot;, which began service on Okanagan Lake in 1892, meant that more services could be shipped to the area. A group of residents formed their own local public government board for the community, by 1907, in the hopes of promoting the area. It was referred to as the Board of Trade, who attempted to specialize in arts, commerce, education, and recreation. Another sternwheeler was constructed at Okanagan Landing and launched that same year, the SS &quot;Okanagan&quot;, for use on Okanagan Lake, while other sternwheelers served Penticton and other communities on Skaha Lake.

Penticton was incorporated as a district municipality on December 31, 1908. Shortly after the district was incorporated, the fruit trees planted by Ellis, many of them apple trees, started to grow. Residents of the area packed fruit in boxes, so they could distribute it worldwide. In 1912, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) developed the Incola Hotel for the city, which operated for approximately 70 years. The Penticton Aquatic Club was a center of entertainment.

During World War I, the SS &quot;Sicamous&quot; came to the community, while the Kettle Valley Railway train service began operating, by moving specific passengers. In 1949, Penticton purchased the ship from the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Penticton Regional Airport was developed during World War II due to wartime military air transportation concerns, which acted as an emergency landing strip until its tarmac was completed. Its land was expropriated from the Penticton Indian Band in 1949 under the War Measures Act.

In 1948, a provincial highway opened between Hope and Princeton, which allowed access to Penticton, and created competition for the Kettle Valley Railway; headquarters for the railway were chosen to be in Penticton, in 1910, but the location burnt down in 1964. Much of the railroad&#x27;s original route has been converted to a multi-use recreational trail, known as the Kettle Valley Rail Trail, which carries the Trans Canada Trail through this part of British Columbia. It was incorporated as a city on May 10, 1948, with the Governor General of Canada declaring this. Reeve Robert Lyon served Penticton as the first mayor, while Lord Alexander was made a freeman of the city.

During a series of church fires in 2021–thought to be associated with the outrage following the discovery of many purported burials at Canadian Indian residential school sites–Sacred Heart Mission Church in Penticton was burned on 21 June 2021. Sacred Heart Mission was one of two Catholic churches burned that day, the other roughly 40 minutes away on Osoyoos land.

== Geography ==

=== Topography ===
Penticton is the largest city by area and population in, and the seat of, the Okanagan-Similkameen Regional District, which is part of the Okanagan as a whole, for which the city is the third largest in the region. It is the 21st largest settlement in British Columbia itself by population, while its metropolitan area, including the city plus Okanagan-Similkameen Electoral Area D, serves as the 71st largest in Canada; by area, Penticton ranks 20th in its province; statistics are based on the 2011 Canadian Census. It lies at the south bottom of Okanagan Lake, and north beginning of Skaha Lake. Between Okanagan Lake and Skaha Lake are a number of residential areas, farms, which grow orchard and wine products.

Pine and fir are commonly found in the mountains and high country around Penticton, which include the Okanagan Highland, and to its east, the Monashee Mountains. Apex Mountain Resort, which sits west of the city on the Thompson Plateau, is home to the tallest mountain peak in the Penticton area; ski services are offered.

== International relations ==
In early 1975, residents of the Penticton area travelled to Japan, in order to search for business opportunities. They met Kaneyasa Marutani, the mayor of Ikeda, Hokkaido, a town in the Nakagawa regional district of Japan. He claimed that the town was proposing a sister city relationship, and stated that Penticton was a reasonable option, due to its similarities with winery production, cattle industry, and geographic features. Later that year, residents of the Ikeda area toured Penticton and met with the government of Penticton, reaching a decision to become a sister city in 1977.

Since 1977, Penticton has served as a sister city of Ikeda. The relationship is one of the oldest in Canada, with a number of residents having exchanged visits to the respective locations annually. In 1993, there was consideration for building a Japanese garden in Penticton, in order to honour their agreement, with the garden&#x27;s construction beginning in 1997. It is known as the Penticton–Ikeda Japanese Garden.

== History ==
The origin of the name Munakata is said to be from &quot;Minokatachi&quot; or &quot;Minokata&quot; from the enshrinement of three Munakata goddesses, descended from sword of Susanoo-no-Mikoto and mentioned in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. It is believed to have been the site of the kingdom of Matsurokoku, one of the countries described in &quot;Wajinden&quot;, &quot;Liangshu&quot; and &quot;History of the Northern Dynasties&quot;, and is the first place where emissaries from China landed on the mainland of Wa. The area was part of ancient Chikugo Province, and prospered from trade with China and Korea from ancient times. From the Asuka period through the Sengoku period, Munakata Taisha controlled most of northern Kyūshū, with the Munakata clan ruling as temporal &quot;daimyō&quot; over what is now Onga in the east, south to Wakamiya and Miyata, and Shingū in the west. Munakata Ujisada of Munakata Shrine established Tsutagadake castle (Mount Jo) as a defense from invasion by other warlords such as Tachibana Dōsetsu and the Ōtomo clan. There are also ghost stories connected with the area since the Yamada incident arose. During the Edo Period much of the area was under the control of Fukuoka Domain.

After the Meiji restoration, the villages of Akama and Tōgō were established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Akama was raised to town status on June 25, 1898 and Tōgō on October 1, 1925, Both towns merged with the villages of Yoshitake, Nango, and Kawato in Munakata District to form the town of Munakata on April 1, 1954.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Dazaifu was on 20 July 2018 and 3 August 2023; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 25 January 2016.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Dazaifu in 2020 is 73,164 people. Dazaifu has been conducting censuses since 1920.

==History==
The area of Dazaifu was part of ancient Chikuzen Province and was the capital of ancient Tsukushi Province in the Kofun period. A fortified site that was the imperial office governing Kyūshū (corresponding to Tagajō in Tōhoku) was established in 663 AD, and the name &quot;Dazaifu&quot; first appears in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; in 671 AD. According to the Taiho Code of 701, an attempt by the Yamato Kingdom to exert further control over its territories, Dazaifu was given two principal administrative functions: to supervise the affairs of Tsukushi (present-day Kyushu) and to receive foreign emissaries. Dazaifu hosted foreign embassies from Tang China and Korea. Kōrokan, a guesthouse for foreign embassies, was also established. The Korokan featured in contemporary literature, such as the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, as a place of departure for ocean voyages. Government records indicate that the disastrous Japanese smallpox epidemic that took place from 735 to 737 first took hold in Dazaifu. From the Nara period through the Heian period and until the Kamakura period, Dazaifu was one of the military and administrative centers of Japan. In the Heian period, Dazaifu was a place of exile for high-ranking courtiers. Nobles exiled there include Sugawara no Michizane. His grave is at Dazaifu Tenman-gū. The government offices were burned down during the rebellion of Fujiwara no Sumitomo in 941 and with the decline of imperial authority, Dazaifu never regained its earlier prestige. By the Muromachi period the political center of Kyūshū was moved to Hakata. The Shōni were later expelled by the Ōuchi clan. In the Edo period, Dazaifu was part of Fukuoka Domain.

After the Meiji restoration, the village of Dazaifu was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Dazaifu was raised to town status on March 1, 1955, and to city status on April 1, 1982.

==Government==
Dazaifu has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 18 members. Dazaifu contributes two members to the Fukuoka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Fukuoka 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
Although mostly mountainous, Daizaifu does have arable land used for paddy fields and market gardening. However, tourism is the mainstay of the local economy, due to my historical sites. Dazaifu is also a &quot;college town&quot; with many students at its colleges and universities.

<doc id="329460" wikidata="Q1886116" url="?curid=329460" title="SaGa">
<text>is a series of science fantasy role-playing video games by Square Enix. The series originated on the Game Boy in 1989 as the creation of Akitoshi Kawazu at Square. It has since continued across multiple platforms, from the Super NES to the PlayStation 2 to mobile phones, PCs, and modern multi-platform console releases. The series is notable for its emphasis on open world exploration, non-linear branching plots, and occasionally unconventional gameplay. This distinguishes the games from most of Square&#x27;s other franchises.

== Development ==
The &quot;SaGa&quot; series was created by game designer Akitoshi Kawazu, whose contributions prior to the franchise&#x27;s introduction include &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;. At a time when Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy was becoming popular worldwide due to the puzzle game &quot;Tetris&quot;, then-Square president Masafumi Miyamoto requested that a development team create a game for the handheld console. Kawazu and fellow designer Koichi Ishii suggested that the company develop a role-playing video game, thus making &quot;Makai Toushi Sa·Ga&quot;, later released in North America as &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot;, the company&#x27;s first handheld title. The gameplay was designed to be difficult, described by Kawazu as the main difference between the &quot;SaGa&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. The character illustrations in all the games in the &quot;SaGa&quot; series were done by Tomomi Kobayashi, who has also done the illustrations for the MMORPG &quot;Granado Espada&quot;. Although it has been a long-running series, as of 2008, none of the ten production teams at Square Enix is assigned to the franchise. Akitoshi Kawazu and Production Team 2 are devoted to the &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot; series.

==Common elements==
The &quot;SaGa&quot; series emphasizes nonlinear gameplay and open world exploration, with its open-ended branching plot and free style of character development separating it from the more linear &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, which was ahead of its time Like the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, however, the stories in each &quot;SaGa&quot; share little to no continuity to one another.

The &quot;SaGa&quot; series is also considered a successor to &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;, which introduced a more open-ended activity-based progression system that was abandoned by later &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games but embraced by &quot;Makai Toushi SaGa&quot; (&quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot;), which expanded it with weapons that shatter with repeated use and added new ideas such as a race of monsters that mutate depending on which fallen foes they consume.

The early games in the series also feature some common gameplay elements and themes first established in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, such as random enemy encounters, but most of these disappear with the &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot; games, providing a unique gameplay experience. It also features a similar turn-based battle system, where a character&#x27;s prowess is driven by numerical values called &quot;statistics&quot; which, in turn, increase with combat experience. Given the open-ended aspect of gameplay and the ability to play through multiple character scenarios, heavy emphasis is placed upon the replay value of &quot;SaGa&quot; games.

Since the original &quot;Makai Toushi SaGa&quot;, much of the series has relied on loosely connected stories and sidequests rather than an epic narrative. &quot;Makai Toushi SaGa&quot; allowed players to travel through different worlds. &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot; expanded the open-endedness by offering many choices and allowing players to complete quests in any order, with the decision of whether or not to participate in any particular quest affecting the outcome of the storyline. The game also allowed players to choose from eight different characters, each with their own stories that start in different places and offer different outcomes. &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot; thus succeeded in providing a very different experience during each run through the game, something that later non-linear RPGs such as &quot;SaGa Frontier&quot; and &quot;Fable&quot; had promised but were unable to live up to. It also introduced a combo system where up to five party members can perform a combined special attack, and required characters to pay mentors to teach them abilities, whether it is using certain weapons or certain proficiencies like opening a chest or dismantling a trap.

While in the original &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot;, scenarios were changed according to dialogue choices during conversations, &quot;Romancing SaGa 2&quot; further expanded the open-endedness by having unique storylines for each character that can change depending on the player&#x27;s actions, including who is chosen, what is said in conversation, what events have occurred, and who is present in the party. &quot;Romancing SaGa 3&quot; featured a storyline that could be told differently from the perspectives of up to eight different characters and introduced a level-scaling system where the enemies get stronger as the characters do, a mechanic that was later used in &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot;, &quot;Silverfall&quot;, &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot;, &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, and &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;. &quot;SaGa Frontier&quot; further expanded on the non-linear gameplay of its &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot; predecessors, with a setting that spans multiple planets and an overarching plot that becomes apparent after playing through each of the different characters&#x27; quests that tie together at certain places.

== Games ==
=== Mainline ===
=== Others ===
==Music==

Music in the &quot;SaGa&quot; series have been composed by a number of people, the most prominent of which is Kenji Ito, who also composed some soundtracks for the &quot;Mana&quot; series. Nobuo Uematsu, responsible for a large portion of the music of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, solely composed &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot; and co-composed &quot;Final Fantasy Legend II&quot; with Ito. Ryuji Sasai and Chihiro Fujioka worked on &quot;Final Fantasy Legend III&quot; together. &quot;SaGa Frontier 2&quot; and &quot;Unlimited Saga&quot; are credited to Masashi Hamauzu.

==Reception==


Games in the &quot;SaGa&quot; series have been popular in Japan, with many of them selling over 1 million units. As of March 2011, the series has sold over 9.9 million units. In 2006, &quot;Famitsu&quot; readers voted &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot; as the 53rd best game of all time, and &quot;SaGa 2&quot; as the 94th best game of all time. Games in the series also received generally positive reviews from Japanese publications such as &quot;Famitsu&quot; and &quot;Dengeki&quot;. As of 2019, the series has sold over 10 million units.

However, the series has remained decidedly less popular in North America, many of the games receiving mixed reviews from printed and online publications. It has been suggested that this is due to the series&#x27; seemingly experimental gameplay and allowing the player to freely roam with little direction or narrative, atypical of what many North American gamers usually expect from Japanese role-playing games. In their September 2004 &quot;Overrated/Underrated&quot; article, &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; cited the &quot;SaGa&quot; series as one ruined in the transition to the PlayStation 2, citing primarily &quot;Unlimited SaGa&quot;.

<doc id="329469" wikidata="Q2041614" url="?curid=329469" title="Ouachita River">
<text>The Ouachita River ( ) is a river that runs south and east through the U.S. states of Arkansas and Louisiana, joining the Tensas River to form the Black River near Jonesville, Louisiana. It is the 25th-longest river in the United States (by main stem).

==Course==
The Ouachita River begins in the Ouachita Mountains near Mena, Arkansas. It flows east into Lake Ouachita, a reservoir created by Blakely Mountain Dam. The North Fork and South Fork of the Ouachita flow into Lake Ouachita to join the main stream. Portions of the river in this region flow through the Ouachita National Forest. From the lake, the Ouachita flows south into Lake Hamilton, a reservoir created by Carpenter Dam, named after Flavius Josephus Carpenter. The city of Hot Springs lies on the north side of Lake Hamilton. Another reservoir, Lake Catherine, impounds the Ouachita just below Lake Hamilton. Below Lake Catherine, the river flows free through most of the rest of Arkansas.

Just below Lake Catherine, the river bends south near Malvern, and collects the Caddo River near Arkadelphia. Downstream, the Little Missouri River joins the Ouachita. After passing the city of Camden, shortly downstream from where dredging for navigational purposes begins, the river collects the waters of Smackover Creek and later the Ouachita&#x27;s main tributary, the Saline River. South of the Saline, the Ouachita flows into Lake Jack Lee, a reservoir created by the Ouachita and Black River Project, just north of the Louisiana state line. The Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge encompasses the Ouachita from the Saline River to Lake Jack Lee&#x27;s mouth.

Below Lake Jack Lee, the Ouachita continues south into Louisiana. The river flows generally south through the state, collecting the tributary waters of Bayou Bartholomew, Bayou de Loutre, Bayou d&#x27;Arbonne, the Boeuf River, and the Tensas River.

The Ouachita has five locks and dams along its length, located at Camden, Calion, and Felsenthal, Arkansas, and in Columbia and Jonesville, Louisiana.

===Black River===

The river below the junction with the Tensas at is called the Black River and flows for in Catahoula and Concordia parishes until it joins the Red River, which flows into both the Atchafalaya River and the Mississippi River, via the Old River Control Structure.

==History==
The river is named for the Native American Ouachita tribe, one of several historic tribes who lived along it. Others included the Caddo, Osage Nation, Tensa, Chickasaw, and Choctaw. The historian Muriel Hazel Wright suggested that word Ouachita &quot;owa chito&quot; is a Choctaw phrase meaning &quot;hunt big&quot; or &quot;good hunting grounds&quot;.

Before the rise of the historic tribes, their indigenous ancestors had lived along the river for thousands of years. In the Lower Mississippi Valley, they began building monumental earthwork mounds in the Middle Archaic period (6000–2000 BC in Louisiana). The earliest construction was Watson Brake, an 11-mound complex built about 3500 BC by hunter gatherers in present-day Louisiana. The discovery and dating of several such early sites in northern Louisiana has changed the traditional model, which associated mound building with sedentary, agricultural societies, but these cultures did not develop for thousands of years.

The largest such prehistoric mound was destroyed in the 20th century during construction of a bridge at Jonesville, Louisiana. Likely built by the Mississippian culture, which rose about 1000 AD on the Mississippi and its tributaries, this mound was reported in use as late as 1540 by the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. On his expedition through this area, he encountered Indians occupying the site. A lightning strike destroyed the temple on the mound that year, which was seen as a bad omen by the tribe. They never rebuilt the temple, and were recorded as abandoning the site in 1736.

After the Louisiana purchase, Arkansas became a part of the U.S. and the Dunbar and Hunter Expedition was commissioned to explore Arkansas which included the length of the Ouachita River from the mouth to Hot Springs.

The Ouachita River was a route used in the Trail of Tears. Native Americans were transported along the river to Camden, Arkansas and from there they walked the rest of the way to Oklahoma.

The river was an important factor in settling the region because it provided access to larger markets for cotton and other goods. Nowadays the river still transports goods however to a lesser extent than before and many of its natural areas are preserved.

===Land speculators===
During the late 1700s, when the area was controlled by the Spanish and French, the river served as a route for early colonists, and for land speculators such as the self-styled Baron de Bastrop. The &quot;Bastrop lands&quot; later passed into the hands of another speculator, former Vice President Aaron Burr. He saw potential for big profits in the event of a war with Spain following the Louisiana Purchase. Burr and many of his associates were arrested for treason, before their band of armed settlers reached the Ouachita.

During the 1830s, the Ouachita River Valley attracted land speculators from New York and southeastern cities. Its rich soil and accessibility due to the country&#x27;s elaborate river steamboat network made it desirable.

One of the investors from the east was Meriwether Lewis Randolph, the youngest grandson of Thomas Jefferson. He was building a home on the Ouachita River in what is now Clark County, Arkansas, when he died of malaria in 1837. He had been appointed Secretary of the Arkansas Territory by President Andrew Jackson in 1835, and had relinquished his commission when Arkansas became a state in 1836.

===Steamboats, 1819 to 1890===
Steamboats operated on the Red River to Shreveport, Louisiana.

In April 1815, Captain Henry Miller Shreve was the first person to bring a steamboat, the Enterprise, up the Red River.

During the 1830s, farmers cultivated land for large cotton plantations; dependent on slave labor, cotton production supported new planter wealth in the ante-bellum years. Steamboats ran scheduled trips between Camden, Arkansas and New Orleans. A person could travel from any eastern city to the Ouachita River without touching land, except to transfer from one steamboat to another.

Trade using steamboats on the Ouachita River became an important part of the local economy and supported many of the communities along the river.

In the late 1830s, the steamboats in rivers on the west side of the Mississippi River were a long, wide, shallow draft vessel, lightly built with an engine on the deck. These newer steamboats could sail in just 20 inches of water. Contemporaries claimed that they could &quot;run with a lot of heavy dew&quot;.

In 1881 a snagboat was employed on the river and a boat for dredging in the shoals to the amount of $141,879.24. Earlier plans had called for the construction of locks and dams.

===Navigation===

A 337-mile-long &quot;Ouachita–Black Rivers Navigation Project&quot; began in 1902, to create a navigable waterway from Camden, Arkansas to Jonesville, Louisiana, and when completed in 1924 included six locks and dams that were 84 feet wide and 600 feet in length, having from 3 to 5 tainter gates. Including the Black River the total navigable length is 351 miles. The Ouachita-Black Rivers Navigation Project has less than a million tons of shipping annually which has the likely prospect of the future withdrawal of federal support. The project&#x27;s system of dams and locks enhances the river&#x27;s recreational use and regional water supply.

====Floods====
=====Flood of 1882=====
The Ouachita River reached a historic flood stage crest with a river gauge reading at Camden, Arkansas of 46 feet on May 12, 1882.

=====Flood of 1927=====
In Monroe, Louisiana during a flood on May 4, 1927 the high water mark on river gage reading was 48.6 feet.

Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 flooded the areas along the Ouachita Rivers along with many other rivers.

=====Flood of 1932=====
In February 1932, the Ouachita River rose 1.5 feet higher than the May 4, 1927 flood. The annual high water mark on river gage readings were 48.6 in 1927 and 49.7 in 1932.

=====Flood of 1968=====
The Ouachita River reached flood stage crest with a river gauge reading at Camden, Arkansas of 43.08 feet on May 17, 1968.

=====Flood of 2018=====
The Ouachita River reached flood stage crest at 85.43 feet above sea level, about 20 feet above the normal water level of 65 feet at the Felsenthal lock and dam on March 11, 2018. The highest water level ever recorded at Felsenthal was 88.3 feet in 1945.

==Natural history==

The river continues to be utilized for commercial navigation on a smaller scale than during its &quot;steamboat&quot; days. It is fed by numerous small creeks containing endemic native fish such as killifish. Fishing remains popular in the river for black bass, white bass, bream, freshwater drum, and gar. Concerns about airborne mercury contamination in some areas discourage consumption of the fish for food. Fishing for rainbow trout is popular in the tailwaters of Lakes Ouachita, Hamilton and Catherine in and around Hot Springs, Arkansas.

The river is commercially navigable from Camden, Arkansas, to its terminal point in Jonesville in Catahoula Parish in eastern Louisiana. Upstream of Camden, the river receives substantial recreational use.

The Ouachita is lined for most of its length with deep woods, including substantial wetlands. It has a scenic quality representative of the southwestern Arkansas and northern Louisiana region.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Karatsu is as shown below. 

==History==
The area of Karatsu was part of ancient Hizen Province. In 1591, on the coast of the northern part of the city (formerly the town of Chinzei), Nagoya Castle was constructed. The following year, it became the location from which the Imjin War was launched by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In the middle of 1593, Terazawa Hirotaka created Karatsu Domain. In 1602, replacing Nagoya Castle, Karatsu Castle was constructed in what is now the heart of Karatsu.

Following the Meiji restoration, the town of Karatsu and the villages of Hamasaki, Irino, Kagami, Karatsu, Kirigo, Kitahata, Kuri, Kyūragi, Minato, Mitsushima, Nagoya, Nanayama, Ōchi, Ōmura, Onizuka, Sashi, Uchiage and Yobuko were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Ōmura was renamed Tamashima in July 28, 1896. Hamasaki was elevated to town status on July 1, 1922. Karatsu annexed Mitsushima on January 1, 1924. Yobuko was elevated to town status on August 1, 1928. Karatsu Village was incorporated into Karatsu Town on January 1, 1932, and on September 1, 1935 both Sashi and Ōchi were elevated to town status. Sashi was subsequently annexed by Karatsu on November 11, 1941. Kyūragi was elevated to town status on May 3, 1952. On November 1, 1954 Karatsu annexed Kagami, Kuri, Minato and Onizuka. Hamasaki and Tamashima were merged to create the town of Hamasaki-Tamashima; and Nagoya and Uchiage were merge to create the town of Chinzei on September 30, 1956. On November 1, 1958 Kirigo was split and its parts were incorporated into Karatsu and Irino (respectively), and Irino was elevated to town status and was renamed Hizen. On November 1, 1966 Hamasaki-Tamashima was renamed Hamatama.

On January 1, 2005, the towns of Chinzei, Hamatama, Hizen, Kyūragi, Ōchi, Yobuko and the village of Kitahata (all from Higashimatsuura District) were merged into Karatsu.

On January 1, 2006, the village of Nanayama (from Higashimatsuura District) was merged into Karatsu.

==Government==
Karatsu has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 28 members. Karatsu contributes six members to the Saga Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Saga 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
Karatsu has a diverse economy. The main agricultural products are fruit trees, rice, vegetables, and beef cattle. In the plains of Kagami and Kuri, there are vast rice paddies developed as an ancillary project of the river improvement project in the Edo period. Rice is still the main crop, but due to the rice production reduction policy, there has been a shift to the production of soybeans and other beans, and barley, wheat, and other grains. Large-scale orchards are spread out in the Hamatama area, and greenhouse mandarin oranges are a specialty. The main industrial clusters are the Karatsu Ironworks Complex (Nakahara area), the Karatsu Ishishi Industrial Complex (Ishishi area), and the Kishiyama Industrial Complex (Kitahata Kishiyama area).

==Education==
Karatsu has 30 public elementary schools and 18 public junior high schools operated by the city government, and one public junior high schools operated by the Saga Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates a six public high schools and one special education school for the handicapped. There is also one private high school.

<doc id="329473" wikidata="Q629463" url="?curid=329473" title="Job satisfaction">
<text>Job satisfaction, employee satisfaction or work satisfaction is a measure of workers&#x27; contentment with their job, whether they like the job or individual aspects or facets of jobs, such as nature of work or supervision. Job satisfaction can be measured in cognitive (evaluative), affective (or emotional), and behavioral components. Researchers have also noted that job satisfaction measures vary in the extent to which they measure feelings about the job (affective job satisfaction). or cognitions about the job (cognitive job satisfaction).

One of the most widely used definitions in organizational research is that of Edwin A. Locke (1976), who defines job satisfaction as &quot;a pleasurable or positive emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one&#x27;s job or job experiences&quot; (p. 1304). Others have defined it as simply how content an individual is with their job; whether they like the job.

It is assessed at both the global level (whether the individual is satisfied with the job overall), or at the facet level (whether the individual is satisfied with different aspects of the job). Spector (1997) lists 14 common facets: appreciation, communication, coworkers, fringe benefits, Job conditions, nature of the work, organization, personal growth, policies and procedures, promotion opportunities, recognition, security, and supervision.

== Evaluation ==
Hulin and Judge (2003) have noted that job satisfaction includes multidimensional psychological responses to an individual&#x27;s job, and that these personal responses have cognitive (evaluative), affective (or emotional), and behavioral components. Job satisfaction scales vary in the extent to which they assess the affective feelings about the job or the cognitive assessment of the job. Affective job satisfaction is a subjective construct representing an emotional feeling individuals have about their job. Hence, affective job satisfaction for individuals reflects the degree of pleasure or happiness their job in general induces.

Cognitive job satisfaction is a more objective and logical evaluation of various facets of a job. Cognitive job satisfaction can be unidimensional if it comprises evaluation of just one facet of a job, such as pay or maternity leave, or multidimensional if two or more than two facets of a job are simultaneously evaluated. Cognitive job satisfaction does not assess the degree of pleasure or happiness that arises from specific job facets, but rather gauges the extent to which those job facets are judged by the job holder to be satisfactory in comparison with objectives they themselves set or with other jobs. While cognitive job satisfaction might help to bring about affective job satisfaction, the two constructs are distinct, not necessarily directly related, and have different antecedents and consequences.

Job satisfaction can also be seen within the broader context of the range of issues which affect an individual&#x27;s experience of work, or their quality of working life. Job satisfaction can be understood in terms of its relationships with other key factors, such as general well-being, stress at work, control at work, home-work interface, and working conditions.

== History ==
The assessment of job satisfaction through employee anonymous surveys became commonplace in the 1930s. Although prior to that time there was the beginning of interest in employee attitudes, there were only a handful of studies published. Latham and Budworth note that Uhrbrock in 1934 was one of the first psychologists to use the newly developed attitude measurement techniques to assess factory worker attitudes. They also note that in 1935 Hoppock conducted a study that focused explicitly on job satisfaction that is affected by both the nature of the job and relationships with coworkers and supervisors.

== Models ==

=== Affect theory ===
Edwin A. Locke&#x27;s Range of Affect Theory (1976) is arguably the most famous job satisfaction model. The main premise of this theory is that satisfaction is determined by a discrepancy between what one wants in a job and what one has in a job. Further, the theory states that how much one values a given facet of work (e.g. the degree of autonomy in a position) moderates how satisfied/dissatisfied one becomes when expectations are/are not met. When a person values a particular facet of a job, their satisfaction is more greatly impacted both positively (when expectations are met) and negatively (when expectations are not met), compared to one who does not value that facet.

To illustrate, if Employee A values autonomy in the workplace and Employee B is indifferent about autonomy, then Employee A would be more satisfied in a position that offers a high degree of autonomy and less satisfied in a position with little or no autonomy compared to Employee B. This theory also states that too much of a particular facet will produce stronger feelings of dissatisfaction the more a worker values that facet.

=== Dispositional approach ===
The dispositional approach suggests that individuals vary in their tendency to be satisfied with their jobs, in other words, job satisfaction is to some extent an individual trait. This approach became a notable explanation of job satisfaction in light of evidence that job satisfaction tends to be stable over time and across careers and jobs. Research also indicates that identical twins raised apart have similar levels of job satisfaction.

A significant model that narrowed the scope of the dispositional approach was the Core Self-evaluations Model, proposed by Timothy A. Judge, Edwin A. Locke, and Cathy C. Durham in 1997. Judge et al. argued that there are four core self-evaluations that determine one&#x27;s disposition towards job satisfaction: self-esteem, general self-efficacy, locus of control, and neuroticism. This model states that higher levels of self-esteem (the value one places on oneself) and general self-efficacy (the belief in one&#x27;s own competence) lead to higher work satisfaction. Having an internal locus of control (believing one has control over one&#x27;s own life, as opposed to outside forces having control) leads to higher job satisfaction. Finally, lower levels of neuroticism lead to higher job satisfaction.

=== Equity theory ===
Equity Theory shows how a person views fairness in regard to social relationships such as with an employer. A person identifies the amount of input (things gained) from a relationship compared to the output (things given) to produce an input/output ratio. They then compare this ratio to the ratio of other people in deciding whether they have an equitable relationship. Equity Theory suggests that if an individual thinks there is an inequality between two social groups or individuals, the person is likely to be distressed because the ratio between the input and the output are not equal.

For example, consider two employees who work the same job and receive the same pay and benefits. If one individual gets a pay raise for doing the same work as the other, then the less benefited individual will become distressed in the workplace. If, on the other hand, both individuals get pay raises and new responsibilities, then the feeling of equity will be maintained.

Other psychologists have extended the equity theory, suggesting three behavioral response patterns to situations of perceived equity or inequity. These three types are benevolent, equity sensitive, and entitled. The level by each type affects motivation, job satisfaction, and job performance.

#Benevolent-Satisfied when they are under-rewarded compared with co-workers
#Equity sensitive-Believe everyone should be fairly rewarded
#Entitled-People believe that everything they receive is their just due

=== Discrepancy theory ===
The concept of discrepancy theory is to explain the ultimate source of anxiety and dejection. An individual who has not fulfilled their responsibilities may feel a sense of anxiety and regret for not performing well. They may also feel dejection due to not being able to achieve their hopes and aspirations.

According to this theory, all individuals will learn what their obligations and responsibilities are for a particular function, and if they fail to fulfill those obligations then they are punished. Over time, these duties and obligations consolidate to form an abstracted set of principles, designated as a self-guide. Agitation and anxiety are the main responses when an individual fails to achieve the obligation or responsibility.
This theory also explains that if achievement of the obligations is obtained then the reward can be praise, approval, or love. These achievements and aspirations also form an abstracted set of principles, referred to as the ideal self guide. When the individual fails to obtain these rewards, they begin to have feelings of dejection, disappointment, or even depression.

=== Two-factor theory (motivator-hygiene theory) ===

Frederick Herzberg&#x27;s two-factor theory (also known as motivator-hygiene theory) attempts to explain satisfaction and motivation in the workplace. This theory states that satisfaction and dissatisfaction are driven by different factors – motivation and hygiene factors, respectively. An employee&#x27;s motivation to work is continually related to job satisfaction of a subordinate. Motivation can be seen as an inner force that drives individuals to attain personal and organizational goals. Motivating factors are those aspects of the job that make people want to perform, and provide people with satisfaction, for example achievement in work, recognition, promotion opportunities. These motivating factors are considered to be intrinsic to the job, or the work carried out. Hygiene factors include aspects of the working environment such as pay, company policies, supervisory practices, and other working conditions.

Herzberg&#x27;s model has stimulated much research. In the 1970s, researchers were unable to reliably empirically prove the model however, with Hackman &amp; Oldham suggesting that Herzberg&#x27;s original formulation of the model may have been a methodological artifact.

The theory has been criticized because it does not consider individual differences, conversely predicting all employees will react in an identical manner to changes in motivating/hygiene factors. The model has also been criticised in that it does not specify how motivating/hygiene factors are to be measured. Most studies use a quantitative approach by for example using validated instruments such as the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire. There are also studies that have utilized a qualitative methodology such as by means of individual interviews.

=== Job characteristics model ===

Hackman &amp; Oldham proposed the job characteristics model, which is widely used as a framework to study how particular job characteristics impact job outcomes, including job satisfaction. The five core job characteristics can be combined to form a motivating potential score (MPS) for a job, which can be used as an index of how likely a job is to affect an employee&#x27;s attitudes and behaviors. Not everyone is equally affected by the MPS of a job. People who are high in growth need strength (the desire for autonomy, challenge and development of new skills on the job) are particularly affected by job characteristics. A meta-analysis of studies that assess the framework of the model provides some support for the validity of the JCM.

== Influencing factors ==

=== Environmental factors ===

==== Communication overload and underload ====
One of the most important aspects of an individual&#x27;s work in a modern organization concerns the management of communication demands that they encounter on the job. Demands can be characterized as a communication load, which refers to &quot;the rate and complexity of communication inputs an individual must process in a particular time frame.&quot;

Individuals in an organization can experience communication overload and communication underload, which can affect their level of job satisfaction. Communication overload can occur when &quot;an individual receives too many messages in a short period of time,&quot; resulting in unprocessed information or when an individual faces more complex messages that are more difficult to process. Due to this process, &quot;given an individual&#x27;s style of work and motivation to complete a task, when more inputs exist than outputs, the individual perceives a condition of overload,&quot; which can be positively or negatively related to job satisfaction. In comparison, communication underload can occur when messages or inputs are sent below the individual&#x27;s ability to process them.

According to the ideas of communication overload and underload, if an individual does not receive enough input on the job or is unsuccessful in processing these inputs, the individual is more likely to become dissatisfied, aggravated, and unhappy with their work, leading to a low level of job satisfaction.

==== Superior-subordinate communication ====

Superior-subordinate communication is an important influence on job satisfaction in the workplace. The way in which subordinates perceive a supervisor&#x27;s behavior can positively or negatively influence job satisfaction. Communication behavior such as facial expression, eye contact, vocal expression, and body movement is crucial to the superior-subordinate relationship. Nonverbal messages play a central role in interpersonal interactions with respect to impression formation, deception, attraction, social influence, and emotion. Nonverbal immediacy from the supervisor helps to increase interpersonal involvement with their subordinates, impacting job satisfaction. The manner in which supervisors communicate with their subordinates nonverbally may be more important than the verbal content. Individuals who dislike and think negatively about their supervisor are less willing to communicate or have motivation to work, whereas individuals who like and think positively of their supervisor are more likely to communicate and are satisfied with their job and work environment. A supervisor who uses nonverbal immediacy, friendliness, and open communication lines is more likely to receive positive feedback and high job satisfaction from a subordinate. Conversely, a supervisor who is antisocial, unfriendly, and unwilling to communicate will naturally receive negative feedback and create low job satisfaction in their subordinates.

=== Strategic employee recognition ===
A Watson Wyatt Worldwide study identified a positive outcome between a collegial and flexible work environment and an increase in shareholder value. Suggesting that employee satisfaction is directly related to financial gain.
Over 40 percent of the companies listed in the top 100 of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Best Companies to Work For&quot; also appear on the Fortune 500. It is possible that successful workers enjoy working at successful companies, however, the Watson Wyatt Worldwide Human Capital Index study claims that effective human resources practices, such as employee recognition programs, lead to positive financial outcomes more often than positive financial outcomes lead to good practices.

Employee recognition is not only about gifts and points. It&#x27;s about changing the corporate culture in order to meet goals and initiatives and most importantly to connect employees to the company&#x27;s core values and beliefs. Strategic employee recognition is seen as the most important program not only to improve employee retention and motivation but also to positively influence the financial situation. The difference between the traditional approach (gifts and points) and strategic recognition is the ability to serve as a serious business influencer that can advance a company&#x27;s strategic objectives in a measurable way. &quot;The vast majority of companies want to be innovative, coming up with new products, business models and better ways of doing things. However, innovation is not so easy to achieve. A CEO cannot just order it, and so it will be. You have to carefully manage an organization so that, over time, innovations will emerge.&quot;

=== Individual factors ===

==== Emotion ====
Mood and emotions at work are related to job satisfaction. Moods tend to be longer lasting but often weaker states of uncertain origin, while emotions are often more intense, short-lived and have a clear object or cause.

Some research suggests moods are related to overall job satisfaction. Positive and negative emotions were also found to be significantly related to overall job satisfaction.

Frequency of experiencing net positive emotion will be a better predictor of overall job satisfaction than will intensity of positive emotion when it is experienced.

Emotion work (or emotion management) refers to various types of efforts to manage emotional states and displays. Emotion management includes all of the conscious and unconscious efforts to increase, maintain, or decrease one or more components of an emotion. Although early studies of the consequences of emotional work emphasized its harmful effects on workers, studies of workers in a variety of occupations suggest that the consequences of emotional work are not uniformly negative.

It was found that suppression of unpleasant emotions decreases job satisfaction and the amplification of pleasant emotions increases job satisfaction.

The understanding of how emotion regulation relates to job satisfaction concerns two models:
# Emotional dissonance: a state of discrepancy between public displays of emotions and internal experiences of emotions, that often follows the process of emotion regulation. Emotional dissonance is associated with high emotional exhaustion, low organizational commitment, and low job satisfaction.
# Social interaction model: taking the social interaction perspective, workers&#x27; emotion regulation might beget responses from others during interpersonal encounters that subsequently impact their own job satisfaction. For example, the accumulation of favorable responses to displays of pleasant emotions might positively affect job satisfaction.

==== Genetics ====
The influence that genetics has had on a variety of individual differences is well documented. Some research suggests genetics also play a role in the intrinsic, direct experiences of job satisfaction like challenge or achievement (as opposed to extrinsic, environmental factors like working conditions). Notably, Arvey et al. (1989) examined job satisfaction in 34 pairs of monozygotic twins who were reared apart to test for the existence of genetic influence on job satisfaction. After correcting for age and gender, they obtained an intra-class correlation of .31. This suggests that 31% of variance in job satisfaction has a genetic basis, the estimate would be slightly larger if corrected for measurement error. They also found that evidence of genetic heritability for job characteristics, such as complexity level, motor skill requirements, and physical demands.

==== Personality ====
Some research suggests an association between personality and job satisfaction. Specifically, this research describes the role of negative affectivity and positive affectivity. Negative affectivity is related strongly to the personality trait of neuroticism. Individuals high in negative affectivity are more prone to experience less job satisfaction. Positive affectivity is related strongly to the personality trait of extraversion. Those high in positive affectivity are more prone to be satisfied in most dimensions of their life, including their job. Differences in affectivity likely impact how individuals will perceive objective job circumstances like pay and working conditions, thus affecting their satisfaction in that job.

There are two personality factors related to job satisfaction, alienation and locus of control. Employees who have an internal locus of control and feel less alienated are more likely to experience job satisfaction, job involvement and organizational commitment. A meta-analysis of 187 studies of job satisfaction concluded that high satisfaction was positively associated with internal locus of control. The study also showed characteristics like high Machiavellianism, narcissism, trait anger, type A personality dimensions of achievement striving and impatience/irritability, are also related to job satisfaction.

=== Psychological well-being ===
Psychological well-being (PWB) is defined as &quot;the overall effectiveness of an individual&#x27;s psychological functioning&quot; as related to primary facets of one&#x27;s life: work, family, community, etc. There are three defining characteristics of PWB. First, it is a phenomenological event, meaning that people are happy when they subjectively believe themselves to be so. Second, well-being involves some emotional conditions. Particularly, psychologically well people are more prone to experience positive emotions and less prone to experience negative emotions. Third, well-being refers to one&#x27;s life as a whole. It is a global evaluation. PWB is primarily measured using the eight-item Index of Psychological Well-Being developed by Berkman (IPWB). IPWB asks respondents to reply to a series a questions on how often they felt &quot;pleased about accomplishing something&quot;, &quot;bored&quot;, &quot;depressed or unhappy&quot;, etc.

PWB in the workplace plays an important role in determining job satisfaction and has attracted much research attention in recent years. These studies have focused on the effects of PWB on job satisfaction as well as job performance. One study noted that because job satisfaction is specific to one&#x27;s job, the research that examined job satisfaction had not taken into account aspects of one&#x27;s life external to the job. Prior studies had focused only on the work environment as the main determinant of job satisfaction. Ultimately, to better understand job satisfaction (and its close relative, job performance), it is important to take into account an individual&#x27;s PWB. Research published in 2000 showed a significant correlation between PWB and job satisfaction (r = .35, p &lt; .01). A follow-up study by the same authors in 2007 revealed similar results (r = .30, p &lt; .01). In addition, these studies show that PWB is a better predictor of job performance than job satisfaction alone. Job satisfaction more associate to mental health than physical health.

== Measuring ==
The majority of job satisfaction measures are self-reports and based on multi-item scales. Several measures have been developed over the years, although they vary in terms of how carefully and distinctively they are conceptualized with respect to affective or cognitive job satisfaction. They also vary in terms of the extent and rigour of their psychometric validation.

The Brief Index of Affective Job Satisfaction (BIAJS) is a four-item, overtly affective as opposed to cognitive, measure of overall affective job satisfaction. The BIAJS differs from other job satisfaction measures in being comprehensively validated not just for internal consistency reliability, temporal stability, convergent and criterion-related validities, but also for cross-population invariance by nationality, job level, and job type. Reported internal consistency reliabilities range between 0.81 and 0.87.

The Job Descriptive Index (JDI) is a specifically cognitive job satisfaction measure. It measures one&#x27;s satisfaction in five facets: pay, promotions and promotion opportunities, coworkers, supervision, and the work itself. The scale is simple, participants answer either yes, no, or can&#x27;t decide (indicated by &#x27;?&#x27;) in response to whether given statements accurately describe one&#x27;s job.

The Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS) measures satisfaction with nine facets: Pay, Promotion, Supervision, Fringe Benefits, Contingent Rewards, Operating Procedures, Coworkers, Nature of Work, and Communication.

The Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire job satisfaction subscale is a 3-item measure of general job satisfaction. It has been very popular with researchers.

The Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) has 20 facets plus intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction scores. There are long and short forms.

The Short Index of Job Satisfaction (SIJS) is a free five-item measure which provides overall attitudinal job satisfaction scores. It derived from the Index of Job Satisfaction (IJS) which originally had 18 items. The SIJS presented good validity evidence based on the internal structure (i.e., dimensionality, reliability of the scores, and measurement invariance among sex and countries) as also good validity evidence based on the relation to other variables (e.g., US samples, Brazilian and Portuguese samples).

== Relationships and practical implications ==
Job satisfaction can be indicative of work behaviors such as organizational citizenship, and withdrawal behaviors such as absenteeism, and turnover. Further, job satisfaction can partially mediate the relationship of personality variables and deviant work behaviors. The most important predictor of job satisfaction was perceived organizational support, followed by organizational health. Research shows that staying healthy boosts a person&#x27;s mindset, which influences job satisfaction. Moreover, a corporate wellness program can positively shape how employees feel about their work environment and office conditions. Positive psychological capital was also predicted by organizational health, which was highly related to work satisfaction.

One common research finding is that job satisfaction is correlated with life satisfaction. This correlation is reciprocal, meaning people who are satisfied with life tend to be satisfied with their job and people who are satisfied with their job tend to be satisfied with life. In fact, a 2016 FlexJobs survey revealed 97% of respondents believe a job that offered flexibility would positively impact their lives, 87% think it would help lower stress and 79% think the flexibility would help them live healthier. Additionally, a second survey of 650 working parents revealed that flexible work arrangements can positively affect people&#x27;s personal health, as well as improve their romantic relationships and 99% of respondents believe a flexible job would make them a happier person in general. However, some research has found that job satisfaction is not significantly related to life satisfaction when other variables such as nonwork satisfaction and core self-evaluations are taken into account.

An important finding for organizations to note is that job satisfaction has a rather tenuous correlation to productivity on the job. This is a vital piece of information to researchers and businesses, as the idea that satisfaction and job performance are directly related to one another is often cited in the media and in some non-academic management literature. A recent meta-analysis found surprisingly low correlations between job satisfaction and performance. Further, the meta-analysis found that the relationship between satisfaction and performance can be moderated by job complexity, such that for high-complexity jobs the correlation between satisfaction and performance is higher than for jobs of low to moderate complexity. Additionally, one longitudinal study indicated that among work attitudes, job satisfaction is a strong predictor of absenteeism, suggesting that increasing job satisfaction and organizational commitment are potentially good strategies for reducing absenteeism and turnover intentions. Recent research has also shown that intention to quit alone can have negative effects on performance, organizational deviance, and organizational citizenship behaviours. In short, the relationship of satisfaction to productivity is not as straightforward as often assumed and can be influenced by a number of different work-related constructs, and the notion that &quot;a happy worker is a productive worker&quot; should not be the foundation of organizational decision-making. For example, employee may even be more important than job satisfaction in regards to performance. Job satisfaction has also been found to be impacting the shorter job tenure among persons with severe mental illness.

== Absenteeism ==

Numerous studies have been done to show the correlation of job satisfaction and absenteeism. For example, Goldberg and Waldman looked at absenteeism in two dimensions as total time lost (number of missed days) and the frequency of time lost.

Self-reported data and records-based data were collected and compared. Following absenteeism measures were evaluated according to absenteeism predictors.

#Self-report time lost
#self-reported frequency
#records-based time lost

Only three categories of predictors had a significant relationship ratio and were taken in account further:

* Health
* Wages
* Position level

This research results revealed that absenteeism cannot be predicted by job satisfaction, although other studies have found significant relationships.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Imari is as shown below. 

==History==
The area of Imari was part of ancient Hizen Province. On August 15, 1281 the 2nd Mongol invasion fleet retreated into Imari Bay and was destroyed here by Kamikaze typhoon. During the Edo period, Imari was part of the Saga Domain. During the Edo period this region flourished due to the export of ceramics and porcelain. High quality goods presented to Shōgun and the Imperial Court were produced in what is now called Ōkawachiyama and were styled Nabeshima ware. From the Meiji period to 1955 coal was also a major export.

Following the Meiji restoration, the town of Imari and the villages of Higashiyamashiro, Kurokawa, Makishima, Matsuura, Minamihata, Niri, Nishiyamashiro, Ōdake, Ōkawa, Ōkawachi and Ōtsubo were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system. On February 16, 1901 Ōdake Village was renamed Hatatsu Village. On December 10, 1928 Makishima Village was incorporated into Imari Town. Nishiyamashiro was raised to town status on April 1, 1936 becoming Yamashiro Town. On December 8, 1943 the villages of Ōkawachi and Ōtsubo were incorporated into Imari Town. The towns of Imari and Yamashiro, and the villages of Higashiyamashiro, Kurokawa, Hatatsu, Minamihata, Ōkawa, Matsuura, and Niri were merged on April 1, 1954 to create Imari City.

==Government==
Imari has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 21 members. Imari contributes two members to the Saga Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Saga 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
While Imari is best known as a center of the ceramics industry, there is an industrial park near the Port of Imari. Agriculture is thriving, including rice, green onions, mandarin oranges, pears, and grapes.

=== The Imari Pear ===
Imari is the largest Japanese pear producing center in western Japan. The cultivation of the Japanese pear from Imari (), which originated in the Ōkawa area 100 years ago, has spread out to the Minamihata area and other areas of the city. Today, they are produced over about 350 hectares of land, and their quantity of production was about 4800 tons per year as of 2007. Ōkawa originally had little rice fields, but in 1906 this led the chairman of the Ōkawa Junior Chamber of Commerce, Takeji Fujita and 11 other people to spearhead the reclamation of forest lands and the cultivation of Japanese pears as a cash crop in Ōkawa. Since then the production and the crop acreage of Imari &quot;nashi&quot; have increased. According to the latest municipal statistics, the production is the fifth and the acreage is the third in the nation. The characteristics of Imari &quot;nashi&quot; are juiciness and crispness. Thanks to the adoption of light sensor systems for fruit sorting, only those which are of excellent quality can be selected and are shipped to Kantō, Kansai, and Kyūshū districts. Recently export to China has started and been promoted. The main brands of Imari nashi are Kosui, Hosui, and Niitaka. The most produced is Kosui, but Hosui is the most popular brand of the three.

<text>Bragg Creek is a hamlet in southern Alberta under the jurisdiction of Rocky View County in Division No. 6.

Bragg Creek is located west of Calgary (via Highway 8 and Highway 22) at the confluence of the Elbow River and Bragg Creek north of the intersection of Highway 66 and Highway 22.

Situated in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, this charming hamlet is steeped in tradition and history. Just a 30-minute drive from Calgary, close to the junctions of Highways 8 and 22, it’s a community of outdoor enthusiasts, artists, ranchers, and local businesses. This eclectic mix of residents coexist in harmony with nature and are proud to call Bragg Creek home.
It has been the location of several movies and TV series.

== Amenities ==

Bragg Creek is popular for shopping, with its quaint shops, restaurants, and mountain scenery.

The area is a popular spot for vacations and short day trips from Calgary. It is near the Rocky Mountains and Kananaskis Country. The Elbow River and the scenic Elbow Falls are a short distance away.

There are many recreational areas in the area. These include Bragg Creek Provincial Park and the Canyon Creek Ice Cave, also known as the Bragg Creek Ice Cave. There are numerous hiking/biking trails, equestrian trails and picnic/camping areas. Downhill skiing used to be popular, although since the abandonment of the nearby downhill ski centre, Wintergeen, only cross country skiing facilities are available. In recent years the Greater Bragg Creek Trails Association has developed over of biking, hiking, snowshoeing, and horseback riding trails.

Many summer camps, such as OLQP, Easter Seals Camp Horizon and Kamp Kiwanis are also near Bragg Creek.

The powderface42, a marathon and half-marathon takes place in the vicinity every year. A mountain marathon is an event that combines the distance and endurance of a classical marathon with the challenging terrain of a mountain race. Unlike traditional mountain marathons in the UK, this event does not require participants to navigate through the course. Instead, the route is clearly marked and there are water stations along the way. It is similar to a traditional marathon running race in that respect.

== History ==
Bragg Creek is named after Albert Warren Bragg from Collingwood, Nova Scotia and his 14-year-old brother John Thomas who homesteaded in the area in 1894. The community was established between a forestry reserve, the Sarcee First Nations reserve and a Provincial Park. Ranching was the original primary economic generator in Bragg Creek. The economy diversified with the emergence of recreation in the 1920s.

Back in 1933, Mary Belle and Catherine Barclay, two sisters from Alberta, established the first hostel in a tent in Bragg Creek, just west of Calgary. Together they officially founded and then registered the Canadian Youth Hostel Association in 1938 (now HI Canada) (see https://hihostels.ca/en/about).

Lyon Mountain Ski Hill was a small resort located in Alberta, Canada. It opened in 1982 and was named after its builder, Bob Lyon. The resort featured four lifts and 11 runs, most of which were classified as easy or intermediate in difficulty. It was popular with families due to its close proximity to Calgary. In 2003, the resort was closed by its owner at the time, Resorts of the Canadian Rockies (RCR). This decision was made due to a combination of factors, including poor snow conditions, aging infrastructure, and a lack of potential for reinvestment. RCR continues to operate the adjacent Wintergreen Golf and Country Club. Over time, most of the ski lifts at Lyon Mountain Ski Hill have been removed and sold. RCR has proposed a large housing development for the area, including single-family homes, villas, and a hotel.

Bragg Creek was featured in the feature films &quot;Storm&quot; (1987) and &quot;Killer Image&quot; (1992) both directed by David Winning, and also &quot;Betrayed&quot; (1988) directed by Costa-Gavras. During the 1990s, CBC aired the television program &quot;North of 60&quot;, which was mainly filmed in Bragg Creek. The town was the filming location for the BBC/Discovery Channel series &quot;Dinosapien&quot; (2007) and the 2009 CBC Television series &quot;Wild Roses&quot;, as well as portions of the movie &quot;FUBAR&quot;.

=== 2013 flooding ===
In the late spring of 2013, Bragg Creek and areas surrounding the Elbow River were put on a flood watch and eventually voluntary evacuation when the river rose over , overflowing and eroding in some places. The majority of Bragg Creek buildings were damaged in this event, as were the majority of houses in nearby Redwood Meadows. The voluntary evacuation was not met with widespread co-operation, as many residents stayed to battle the flood by building makeshift dams. Bragg Creek has since recovered from the event.

== Demographics ==

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Takeo is as shown below.

==History==
The area of Takeo was part of ancient Hizen Province. During the Edo period it was mostly under Saga Domain ruled by the Nabeshima clan. Following the Meiji restoration, the town of Takeo and the villages of Asahi, Hashishita, Higashikawanobori, Kitagata, Kitsu, Nakato, Nishikawanobori, Sumiyoshi, Takeo, Takeuchi and Wakaki were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system in Kishima District, Saga. Takeo village and Takeo town merged on June 7, 1900. Kitamura was raised to town status on April 29, 1944. On April 1, 1954 Takeo annexed the villages of Asahi, Hashishita, Higashikawanobori, Nishikawanobori, Takeuchi and Wakagi and was raised to city status. On September 1, 1960 Yamauchi was raised to town status. On March 1, 2006, the towns of Kitagata and Yamauchi (both from Kishima District) were merged into Takeo.

==Government==
Takeo has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 20 members. Takeo contributes two members to the Saga Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Saga 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
About 23% of the city area is farmland, and agriculture is practiced throughout the city. The main agricultural product is rice, with wheat and soybeans also being cultivated. However, agricultural income has been declining year by year, and is the lowest among the cities in the prefecture. Combined with the aging of agricultural successors, the increase in abandoned farmland and the decline in agriculture have become serious problems.

Industry is centered around ceramics production and a number of kilns are located mainly in the old portion of the city. The former Yamauchi Town is adjacent to Arita, so there are many Arita ware (Imari ware) kilns. The city has a number of industrial parks. 

The tertiary industry is centered on commerce and tourism due to Takeo Onsen and other hot springs.

<text>Joseph Francis Fletcher (April 10, 1905 – October 28, 1991) was an American professor who founded the theory of situational ethics in the 1960s. A pioneer in the field of bioethics. Fletcher was a leading academic proponent of the potential benefits of abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, eugenics, and cloning. Ordained as an Episcopal priest, he later identified himself as an atheist.

==Life==
Fletcher, a prolific academic, taught; participated in symposia; and completed ten books, and hundreds of articles, book reviews, and translations. He taught &quot;Christian Ethics&quot; at Episcopal Divinity School (established to train people for ordination in the American Episcopal Church), Cambridge, Massachusetts, and at Harvard Divinity School from 1944 to 1970. He was the first professor of medical ethics at the University of Virginia and co-founded the &quot;Program in Biology and Society&quot; there. He retired from teaching in 1977.

In 1974, the American Humanist Association named him Humanist of the Year. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.

He served as president of the Euthanasia Society of America (later renamed the Society for the Right to Die) from 1974 to 1976. He was also a member of the American Eugenics Society and the Association for Voluntary Sterilization.

One of his children, Joseph F. Fletcher Jr., was a historian.

== Quotes == 

* “mercy killing” is justified for “an incorrigible ‘human vegetable,’ whether spontaneously functioning or artificially supported, [who] is progressively degraded while constantly eating up private or public financial resources in violation of the distributive justice owed to others.” Joseph Fletcher, “Ethics and Euthanasia,” in Horan and Mall, eds., Death, Dying, and Euthanasia, p. 301.
* &quot;People [with children with Down&#x27;s syndrome]... have no reason to feel guilty about putting a Down&#x27;s syndrome baby away, whether it&#x27;s &quot;put away&quot; in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium or in a more responsible lethal sense. It is sad; yes. Dreadful. But it carries no guilt. True guilt arises only from an offense against a person, and a Down&#x27;s is not a person.&quot;

<text>Action painting, sometimes called &quot;gestural abstraction&quot;, is a style of painting in which paint is spontaneously dribbled, splashed or smeared onto the canvas, rather than being carefully applied. The resulting work often emphasizes the physical act of painting itself as an essential aspect of the finished work or concern of its artist.

== Background ==
The style was widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms &quot;action painting&quot; and &quot;abstract expressionism&quot; interchangeably). A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French tachisme. The New York School of American Abstract Expressionism (1940s-50s) is also seen as closely linked to the movement.

The term was coined by the American critic Harold Rosenberg in 1952, in his essay &quot;The American Action Painters&quot;, 
and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of New York School painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was &quot;an arena in which to act&quot;. The actions and means for creating the painting were seen, in action painting, of a higher importance than the result. While Rosenberg created the term &quot;action painting&quot; in 1952, he began creating his action theory in the 1930s as a critic. While abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like Clement Greenberg, focused on their works&#x27; &quot;objectness.&quot; Clement Greenberg was also an influential critic in action painting, intrigued by the creative struggle, which he claimed was evidenced by the surface of the painting. To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings&#x27; clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them. &quot;Some of the labels that became attached to Abstract Expressionism, like &quot;informel&quot; and &quot;Action Painting,&quot; definitely implied this; one was given to understand that what was involved was an utterly new kind of art that was no longer art in any accepted sense. This was, of course, absurd.&quot; – Clement Greenberg, &quot;Post Painterly Abstraction&quot;.

Rosenberg&#x27;s critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting&#x27;s creation. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist Wolfgang Paalen in the position of the artist and theoretician who used the term &quot;action&quot; at first in this sense and fostered the theory of the subjective struggle with it. In his theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space, in which the artist &quot;acts&quot; like in an ecstatic ritual, Paalen considers ideas of quantum mechanics, as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia. His long essay &quot;Totem Art&quot; (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as Martha Graham, Barnett Newman, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko; Paalen describes a highly artistic vision of totemic art as part of a ritual &quot;action&quot; with psychic links to genetic memory and matrilinear ancestor-worship.

Over the next two decades, Rosenberg&#x27;s redefinition of art as an act rather than an object, as a process rather than a product, was influential, and laid the foundation for a number of major art movements, from Happenings and Fluxus to Conceptual, Performance art, Installation art and Earth Art.

== Historical context ==
It is essential for the understanding of action painting to place it in historical context. The action painting movement took place in the time after World War II ended. With this came a disordered economy and culture in Europe, and in America the government took advantage of their new state of importance. A product of the post-World War II artistic resurgence of expressionism in America and more specifically New York City, action painting developed in an era where quantum mechanics and psychoanalysis were beginning to flourish and were changing people&#x27;s perception of the physical and psychological world; and civilization&#x27;s understanding of the world through heightened self-consciousness and awareness.

American action painters pondered the nature of art as well as the reasons for the existence of art often when questioning what the value of action painting is. The preceding art of Kandinsky and Mondrian had freed itself from the portrayal of objects and instead tried to evoke, address and delineate, through the aesthetic sense, emotions and feelings within the viewer. &quot;Action painting&quot; took this a step further, using both Jung and Freud&#x27;s ideas of the subconscious as its underlying foundations. Many of the painters were interested in Carl Jung&#x27;s studies of archetypal images and types, and used their own internal visions to create their paintings. Along with Jung, Sigmund Freud and Surrealism were also influential to the beginning of action painting. The paintings of the Action painters were not meant to portray objects per se or even specific emotions. Instead they were meant to touch the observer deep in the subconscious mind, evoking a sense of the and tapping the collective sense of an archetypal visual language. This was done by the artist painting &quot;unconsciously,&quot; and spontaneously, creating a powerful arena of raw emotion and action, in the moment. Action painting was clearly influenced by the surrealist emphasis on automatism which (also) influenced by psychoanalysis claimed a more direct access to the subconscious mind. Important exponents of this concept of art making were the painters Joan Miró and André Masson.

<text>Canyonlands National Park is a national park of the United States located in southeastern Utah near the town of Moab. The park preserves a colorful landscape eroded into numerous canyons, mesas, and buttes by the Colorado River, the Green River, and their respective tributaries. Legislation creating the park was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on September 12, 1964.

The park is divided into four districts: the Island in the Sky, the Needles, the Maze, and the combined rivers—the Green and Colorado—which carved two large canyons into the Colorado Plateau. While these areas share a primitive desert atmosphere, each retains its own character. Author Edward Abbey, a frequent visitor, described the Canyonlands as &quot;the most weird, wonderful, magical place on earth—there is nothing else like it anywhere.&quot;

== History ==
In the early 1950s, Bates Wilson, then superintendent of Arches National Monument, began exploring the area to the south and west of Moab, Utah. After seeing what is now known as the Needles District of Canyonlands National Park, Wilson began advocating for the establishment of a new national park that would include the Needles. Additional explorations by Wilson and others expanded the areas proposed for inclusion into the new national park to include the confluence of Green and Colorado rivers, the Maze District, and Horseshoe Canyon.

In 1961, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall was scheduled to address a conference at Grand Canyon National Park. On his flight to the conference, he flew over the Confluence (where the Colorado and Green rivers meet). The view apparently sparked Udall&#x27;s interest in Wilson&#x27;s proposal for a new national park in that area and Udall began promoting the establishment of Canyonlands National Park.

Utah Senator Frank Moss first introduced legislation in Congress to create Canyonlands National Park. His legislation attempted to satisfy both nature preservationists&#x27; and commercial developers&#x27; interests. Over the next four years, his proposal was struck down, debated, revised, and reintroduced to Congress many times before being passed and signed into law.

In September 1964, after several years of debate, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed , which established Canyonlands National Park as a new national park. Bates Wilson became the first superintendent of the new park and is often referred to as the &quot;Father of Canyonlands&quot;.

== Recreation ==
Canyonlands is a popular recreational destination. Since 2007, more than 400,000 people have visited the park each year with a record of 776,218 visitors in 2016, representing a 22 percent increase from the prior year. The geography of the park is well suited to a number of different recreational uses. Hikers, mountain bikers, backpackers, and four-wheelers all enjoy traveling the rugged, remote trails within the Park. The White Rim Road traverses the White Rim Sandstone level of the park between the rivers and the Island in the Sky. Since 2015, day-use permits must be obtained before travelling on the White Rim Road due to the increasing popularity of driving and bicycling along it. The park service&#x27;s intent is to provide a better wilderness experience for all visitors while minimizing impacts on the natural surroundings. Canyonlands National Park upholds a strict no-hunting policy.
, the Island in the Sky district, with its proximity to the Moab, Utah area, attracts 76.7 percent of total park visitors. The Needles district is the second most visited, drawing 20.7 percent of visitors. The remote Maze district accounts for only about 1.5 percent of visitors, while river rafters and other river users account for the remaining 1.1 percent of total park visitation.

Rafters and kayakers float the calm stretches of the Green River and Colorado River above the Confluence. Below the Confluence, Cataract Canyon contains powerful whitewater rapids, similar to those found in the Grand Canyon. However, since there is no large impoundment on the Colorado River above Canyonlands National Park, river flow through the Confluence is determined by snowmelt, not management. As a result, and in combination with Cataract Canyon&#x27;s unique graben geology, this stretch of river offers the largest whitewater in North America in heavy snow years.

Political compromise at the time of the park&#x27;s creation limited the protected area to an arbitrary portion of the Canyonlands basin. Conservationists hope to complete the park by bringing the boundaries up to the high sandstone rims that form the natural border of the Canyonlands landscape.

On March 27, 2020, Canyonlands National Park was closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

== Geography ==

The Colorado River and Green River combine within the park, dividing it into three districts called the Island in the Sky, the Needles, and the Maze. The Colorado River flows through Cataract Canyon below its confluence with the Green River.

The Island in the Sky district is a broad and level mesa in the northern section of the park, between the Colorado and Green rivers. The district has many viewpoints overlooking the White Rim, a sandstone bench below the Island, and the rivers, which are another below the White Rim.

The Needles district is located south of the Island in the Sky, on the east side of the Colorado River. The district is named for the red and white banded rock pinnacles which are a major feature of the area. Various other naturally sculpted rock formations are also within this district, including grabens, potholes, and arches. Unlike Arches National Park, where many arches are accessible by short to moderate hikes, most of the arches in the Needles district lie in backcountry canyons, requiring long hikes or four-wheel drive trips to reach them.

The Ancestral Puebloans inhabited this area and some of their stone and mud dwellings are well-preserved, although the items and tools they used were mostly removed by looters. The Ancestral Puebloans also created rock art in the form of petroglyphs, most notably on Newspaper Rock along the Needles access road.
The Maze district is located west of the Colorado and Green rivers. The Maze is the least accessible section of the park, and one of the most remote and inaccessible areas of the United States.

A geographically detached section of the park located north of the Maze district, Horseshoe Canyon contains panels of rock art made by hunter-gatherers from the Late Archaic Period (2000–1000 BC) pre-dating the Ancestral Puebloans. Originally called Barrier Canyon, Horseshoe&#x27;s artifacts, dwellings, pictographs, and murals are some of the oldest in America. The images depicting horses date from after 1540 AD, when the Spanish reintroduced horses to America.

Since the 1950s, scientists have been studying an area of completely surrounded by cliffs. The cliffs have prevented cattle from ever grazing on the area&#x27;s of grassland. According to the scientists, the site may contain the largest undisturbed grassland in the Four Corners region. Studies have continued biannually since the mid-1990s. The area has been closed to the public since 1993 to maintain the nearly pristine environment.

== Nature ==

=== Fauna ===

Mammals that roam this park include black bears, coyotes, skunks, bats, elk, foxes, bobcats, badgers, ring-tailed cats, pronghorns, desert bighorn sheep, and cougars. Desert cottontails, kangaroo rats and mule deer are commonly seen by visitors.

At least 273 species of birds inhabit the park. A variety of hawks and eagles are found, including the Cooper&#x27;s hawk, the northern goshawk, the sharp-shinned hawk, the red-tailed hawk, the golden and bald eagles, the rough-legged hawk, the Swainson&#x27;s hawk, and the northern harrier. Several species of owls are found, including the great horned owl, the northern saw-whet owl, the western screech owl, and the Mexican spotted owl. Grebes, woodpeckers, ravens, herons, flycatchers, crows, bluebirds, wrens, warblers, blackbirds, orioles, goldfinches, swallows, sparrows, ducks, quail, grouse, pheasants, hummingbirds, falcons, gulls, and ospreys are some of the other birds that can be found.

Several reptiles can be found, including eleven species of lizards and eight species of snake (including the midget faded rattlesnake). The common kingsnake and prairie rattlesnake have been reported in the park, but not confirmed by the National Park Service.

The park is home to six confirmed amphibian species, including the red-spotted toad, Woodhouse&#x27;s toad, American bullfrog, northern leopard frog, Great Basin spadefoot toad, and tiger salamander. The canyon tree frog was reported to be in the park in 2000, but was not confirmed during a study in 2004.

=== Flora ===

Canyonlands National Park contains a wide variety of plant life, including 11 cactus species, 20 moss species, liverworts, grasses and wildflowers. Varieties of trees include netleaf hackberry, Russian olive, Utah juniper, pinyon pine, tamarisk, and Fremont&#x27;s cottonwood. Shrubs include Mormon tea, blackbrush, four-wing saltbush, cliffrose, littleleaf mountain mahogany, and snakeweed

Cryptobiotic soil is the foundation of life in Canyonlands, providing nitrogen fixation and moisture for plant seeds. One footprint can destroy decades of growth.

== Climate ==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Canyonlands National Park has a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;). The plant hardiness zones at the Island in the Sky and Needles District Visitor Centers are 7a with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 4.0 °F (-15.6 °C) and 2.9 °F (-16.2 °C), respectively.

The National Weather Service has maintained two cooperative weather stations in the park since June 1965. Official data documents the desert climate with less than of annual rainfall, as well as hot, mostly dry summers and cold, occasionally wet winters. Snowfall is generally light during the winter.

=== Climate change ===
National parks in the Western United States are more affected by climate change than the country as a whole, and the National Park Service has begun research into how exactly this will affect the ecosystem of Canyonlands National Park and the surrounding areas and ways to protect the park for the future. The mean annual temperature of Canyonlands National Park increased by 2.6 °F (1.4 °C) from 1916 to 2018. It is predicted that if current warming trends continue, the average highs in the park during the summer will be over by 2100. In addition to warming, the region has begun to see more severe and frequent droughts which causes native grass cover to decrease and a lower flow of the Colorado River. The flows of the Upper Colorado Basin have decreased by per year, which has led to a decreased amount of sediment carried by the river and rockier rapids which are more frequently impassable to rafters. The area has also begun to see an earlier spring, which will lead to changes in the timing of leaves and flowers blooming and migrational patterns of wildlife that could lead to food shortages for the wildlife, as well as a longer fire season.

The National Park Service is currently closely monitoring the impacts of climate change in Canyonlands National Park in order to create management strategies that will best help conserve the park&#x27;s landscapes and ecosystems for the long term. Although the National Park Service&#x27;s original goal was to preserve landscapes as they were before European colonization, they have now switched to a more adaptive management strategy with the ultimate goal of conserving the biodiversity of the park. The NPS is collaborating with other organizations including the US Geological Survey, local indigenous tribes, and nearby universities in order to create a management plan for the national park. Right now, there is a focus on research into which native plants will be most resistant to climate change so that the park can decide on what to prioritize in conservation efforts. The Canyonlands Natural History Association has been giving money to the US Geological Survey to fund this and other climate related research. They gave $30,000 in 2019 and $61,000 in 2020.

== Geology ==

A subsiding basin and nearby uplifting mountain range (the Uncompahgre) existed in the area in Pennsylvanian time. Seawater trapped in the subsiding basin created thick evaporite deposits by Mid Pennsylvanian. This, along with eroded material from the nearby mountain range, became the Paradox Formation, itself a part of the Hermosa Group. Paradox salt beds started to flow later in the Pennsylvanian and probably continued to move until the end of the Jurassic. Some scientists believe Upheaval Dome was created from Paradox salt bed movement, creating a salt dome, but more modern studies show that the meteorite theory is more likely to be correct.

A warm shallow sea again flooded the region near the end of the Pennsylvanian. Fossil-rich limestones, sandstones, and shales of the gray-colored Honaker Trail Formation resulted. A period of erosion then ensued, creating a break in the geologic record called an unconformity. Early in the Permian an advancing sea laid down the Halgaito Shale. Coastal lowlands later returned to the area, forming the Elephant Canyon Formation.

Large alluvial fans filled the basin where it met the Uncompahgre Mountains, creating the Cutler red beds of iron-rich arkose sandstone. Underwater sand bars and sand dunes on the coast inter-fingered with the red beds and later became the white-colored cliff-forming Cedar Mesa Sandstone. Brightly colored oxidized muds were then deposited, forming the Organ Rock Shale. Coastal sand dunes and marine sand bars once again became dominant, creating the White Rim Sandstone.
A second unconformity was created after the Permian sea retreated. Flood plains on an expansive lowland covered the eroded surface and mud built up in tidal flats, creating the Moenkopi Formation. Erosion returned, forming a third unconformity. The Chinle Formation was then laid down on top of this eroded surface.

Increasingly dry climates dominated the Triassic. Therefore, sand in the form of sand dunes invaded and became the Wingate Sandstone. For a time climatic conditions became wetter and streams cut channels through the sand dunes, forming the Kayenta Formation. Arid conditions returned to the region with a vengeance; a large desert spread over much of western North America and later became the Navajo Sandstone. A fourth unconformity was created by a period of erosion.

Mud flats returned, forming the Carmel Formation, and the Entrada Sandstone was laid down next. A long period of erosion stripped away most of the San Rafael Group in the area, along with any formations that may have been laid down in the Cretaceous period.

The Laramide orogeny started to uplift the Rocky Mountains 70 million years ago and with it, the Canyonlands region. Erosion intensified and when the Colorado River Canyon reached the salt beds of the Paradox Formation the overlying strata extended toward the river canyon, forming features such as The Grabens. Increased precipitation during the ice ages of the Pleistocene quickened the rate of canyon excavation along with other erosion. Similar types of erosion are ongoing, but occur at a slower rate.

<text>The SU-76 (&quot;Samokhodnaya Ustanovka 76&quot;) was a Soviet light self-propelled gun used during and after World War II. The SU-76 was based on a lengthened version of the T-70 light tank chassis and armed with the ZIS-3 mod. 1942 76-mm divisional field gun. Developed under the leadership of chief designer S.A. Ginzburg (1900–1943). Its quite simple construction and multipurpose combat role made it the second most produced Soviet armored fighting vehicle of World War II, after the T-34 medium tank.

== History ==

===SU-76===

Design of the SU-76 began in June 1942, when the State Defense Committee (GKO) ordered the construction of infantry support self-propelled guns armed with the ZIS-3 76-mm divisional field gun and the M-30 122-mm howitzer. The T-70 light tank chassis was chosen by chief designer S.A. Ginzburg for mounting the ZIS-3 gun, and basic tank&#x27;s hull was lengthened, adding one road wheel per side, to facilitate better gun mounting. The gun was installed in the embrasure of the front armored plate of the fixed fully closed armored casemate above the rear of the hull. The power plant consisted of two engines connected in parallel with the transmission. The units of the latter were also paralleled and connected at the level of the main gears. The mechanic-driver sat in the bow of the vehicle, and the gun crew of three men including the commander (usually junior lieutenant) was located in the casemate. The SU-76 (factory designation SU-12) was put into service by a GKO decree of December 2, 1942.

The first batch of SU-76s (25 units) was manufactured by January 1, 1943, and sent to the self-propelled artillery training center. At the end of January, the first two self-propelled artillery regiments of a mixed organization (1433rd and 1434th) were sent to the Volkhov Front to participate in breaking the siege of Leningrad. In March 1943, two more regiments were formed - the 1485th and 1487th, which participated in battles on the Western Front (Soviet Union).

However, already after 10 days of military operation, most of the SU-76s were out of order due to breakdowns in gearboxes and main shafts. An attempt to correct the situation by strengthening the shafts did not lead to anything. Moreover, such vehicles failed even more often. It became obvious that the transmission of the SU-76 had a fundamental design flaw, which was the parallel installation of two twin engines that worked on a common shaft. Such transmission scheme led to the occurrence of resonant torsional vibrations on the shafts. Moreover, the maximum value of the resonant frequency accounted for the most intense mode of operation of the engines (driving in 2nd gear off-road), which led to their rapid failure. Elimination of this defect required time, therefore, on March 21, 1943, the production of the SU-76 was suspended. A total of 560 units were built at Plant No. 38 in Kirov. During the investigation that followed the mass failure of SPGs in the winter of 1943, a commission chaired by I.M. Zaltsman defined that the main culprit was the head of the Department of the Chief Designer of the People&#x27;s Commissariat of the Tank Industry S.A. Ginzburg, who was removed from his position and sent to the front as the head of the repair service of the 32nd tank brigade belonged to the 29th tank corps. Stalin, having learned about this, did not approve of such a hasty decision, and ordered the talented tank designer to be recalled from the front, but it was too late - Ginzburg was killed in action.

===SU-76M===

A more reliable vehicle, the SU-15, appeared as a result of a competition announced by the management of the People&#x27;s Commissariat of the Tank Industry for a light assault SPG armed with a 76-mm divisional gun. GAZ and Plant No. 38 took part in the competition. Tests of the new self-propelled guns took place at the Gorokhovets artillery training ground in July 1943, at the height of the Battle of Kursk. The SU-15 enjoyed the greatest success with the military, and it was recommended for mass production after some improvements. It was necessary to lighten the vehicle, which was done by removing the armored roof over the casemate, at the same time this solved all problems with its ventilation, and also facilitated the boarding and disembarkation of the crew as well as the gun maintenance. In July 1943, the SU-15 under the army designation SU-76M was adopted by the Red Army.

After production of the light SPGs resumed, GAZ and Plant No. 40 in Mytishchi near Moscow joined it in autumn 1943 (the same time the production of T-70 light tanks was fully finished), and as a result 13,732 SU-76Ms were built. More than 9,000 of these SPGs were built solely by Gorky Automobile Plant (GAZ), which became the main plant for the production of the SU-76M from January 1, 1944. The SU-76M became the second most produced Soviet armored fighting vehicle of World War II, after the T-34 medium tank. Under the leadership of the chief designer N.A. Astrov, since the autumn of 1943, work had been going on at GAZ to improve the SPG and adapt its design to mass production conditions. Changes were made to the design of the SU-76M. Vehicles of later series received a higher rear armor plate of the fighting compartment with two firing ports and a larger door, a tube welded to the right and left sides at the back of a casemate appeared to mount a machine gun for anti-aircraft defense. Firing ports of a new shape began to be used, more adapted for firing from a machine gun, etc. Mass production of the SU-76M ceased in October 1945. In contemporary accounts SU-76Ms are often referred to in texts, public radio and TV broadcasting as SU-76s with the &quot;M&quot; omitted, due to their ubiquity in comparison with the original SU-76s.

The layout of the SU-76M and its chassis remained unchanged compared to the SU-76. But the SU-76M had an armored casemate open at the top and partly behind. Two chief designers at the GAZ, N.A. Astrov and A.A. Lipgart, changed the power plant arrangement to that of the T-70 light tank - two GAZ-202 engines were connected in series and installed on the right hand side of the vehicle. The transmission consisted of a two-disk main clutch of dry friction, a four-speed gearbox of the ZIS-5 type, a main drive, side clutches and side drives.

The SU-76M had a clearance . The SPG could climb a slope of 28o, overcame a wide trench, a high wall and a deep ford.

The ZIS-3 gun pointing angles ranged from -5o to +15o vertically and 15o left and right horizontally. The rate of fire of the gun with the pointing correction was 10 rounds per minute, with the rapid fire - up to 20 rounds per minute.

The SU-76 was the basis for the first serial Soviet tracked armored anti-aircraft vehicle, the ZSU-37. Mass production of the ZSU-37 was continued after SU-76M production ceased. The majority of SU-76Ms had been withdrawn from the Soviet army service in the beginning of 1950s, although some were retained as training vehicles for tank crews as late as 1960s.

== Variants ==
;OSU-76: Experimental model based on the T-60 light tank chassis and armed with the 76-mm gun ZIS-3, three prototypes were built in summer 1944.
;SU-76 (factory designation SU-12): Based on a lengthened T-70 light tank chassis, with the inferior dual-engine arrangement of earlier T-70s. Only 560 units were produced, and these were quickly withdrawn from front line service because of transmission problem, which was the parallel installation of two twin engines that worked on a common shaft. The casemate of this version had armored roof, but it caused ventilation issues and was sometimes removed in field depots. Combat mass was 11,200 kg (24,692 lb).
;SU-76M (factory designation SU-15): Main production model (13,732 units were produced). The casemate was open at the top and partly behind. The power plant was taken from the later T-70 light tank and consisted of two GAZ-202 engines connected in series. Combat mass was 10,500 kg (23,149 lb).
;SU-85A/SU-85B (factory designation SU-15A/SU-15B): The SU-85A and SU-85B were based on the SU-76M with an elongated hull. The SU-85A was armed with the 85-mm D-5S-85A gun and a prototype was tested in 1944, although flaws were found in the prototype such as stability during firing not being adequate. The SU-85B was an improved version of the SU-85A with the 85-mm LB-2 gun and an improved fighting compartment and suspension. The SU-85B prototype was tested in April and May of 1945 and was recommended for production, but did not due to cutbacks on vehicle production after the war.
;ZSU-37: Self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, based on the SU-76M.

In 1978, Institute 111 from Romania designed an armoured personnel carrier based on the SU-76M chassis, equipped with the TAB-71 turret. The vehicle entered service as the MLVM (, meaning &quot;infantry fighting vehicle of vânători de munte&quot;).

==Unrelated vehicles==
The unrelated &quot;SU-76i&quot; (the &quot;i&quot; standing for &quot;inostrannaya&quot;, or &#x27;foreign&#x27;, in Russian), first designed and fielded in 1943, was based on captured stocks of German Panzer III and StuG III chassis, a large quantity coming from defeated German troops after the Battle of Stalingrad that year. This partially-modified vehicle was armed with an S-1 76.2 mm tank gun (a cheaper variant of the renowned F-34/ZIS-5 guns which were already mounted on T-34 and KV-1 tanks respectively) in a casemate superstructure but retained the original German Maybach gasoline engine and its torsion-bar suspension system. Around 200 of these ex-German vehicles were sent for conversion into SU-76is at Factory No. 37 to supplement the existing SU-76. They were issued to tank and self-propelled gun units starting in the fall of 1943. They were eventually withdrawn from the front in early 1944 and then used for training and testing until the end of 1945. Only 2 have survived the war, most having been scrapped after 1945. A similar vehicle called SG-122 existed, which was a similar Panzer III conversion, but armed with 122 mm M-30 howitzer. Only around 20 were converted, as the M-30 was considered an insufficient weapon for infantry support.

The also unrelated &quot;SU-76P&quot; (1941) was based on the T-26 chassis. It was built in Leningrad during the Siege of Leningrad and involved removing the turret from the T-26 and mounting a 76 mm regimental gun M1927 on the engine deck. This was created due to the lack of high-explosive 45 mm ammunition inside Leningrad due to the siege, so some T-26 tanks were rearmed with 37mm or 76mm guns for which a reliable source of ammunition was available. They served until 1944, when the siege was broken. They were originally called &quot;SU-76s&quot;, until the SU-76 came into service, upon which it was renamed &quot;SU-76P&quot; (&quot;polkovaya&quot; - regimental).

== SU-76M in combat ==

The SU-76M virtually replaced light tanks in the close support role. While its thin armour and open top made it vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and grenades, its light weight and low ground pressure gave it good maneuverability and low noise on the move. SU-76M was a reliable vehicle (the GAZ-203 engine unit confidently worked out not less than 350 hours without serious breakdowns). But the main advantage of light SPGs was their wide versatility.

According to table of organization and equipment of 1943, each light self-propelled artillery regiment was equipped with 21 SU-76M, there were 119 such regiments in the Red Army by the end of World War II. In the end of 1944 and the beginning of 1945, 70 self-propelled artillery divizions (16 SU-76M in each) were formed to be included into rifle divisions. Some rifle divisions, formed according to special reinforced states, for instance, the 9th plastun rifle volunteer division, received a self-propelled artillery regiment even (initially equipped with 8 SU-76M and 12 SU-122). Also 4 light self-propelled artillery brigades of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (60 SU-76M SPGs, 5 T-70 light tanks and 3 US M3A1 Scout Car armored personnel carriers in each) were formed, starting from the first half of 1944.

The SU-76M was a multipurpose SPG and combined three main battlefield roles: light assault gun for infantry support, mobile anti-tank weapon and mobile gun for indirect fire. With all these tasks, light SPGs successfully coped. The SU-76M had a large number of ammunition types. They included armour-piercing (usual, with ballistic nose and subcaliber hyper-velocity), hollow charge, high explosive, fragmentation, shrapnel and incendiary projectiles. This made the SU-76M an excellent multi-purpose light armoured fighting vehicle.

As a light assault gun, the SU-76M was well-regarded by Soviet infantrymen (in contrast with their own crews). It had more powerful gun than any previous light tank for close support of infantry in defense and offensive, and communication between infantry and the SU-76M crew was simple due to the partially open fighting compartment. This was extremely useful in urban combats like the Battle of Berlin where good teamwork between infantry and AFVs was a key to success.

The SU-76M was effective against any medium or light German tank. It could also knock out the Panther tank with a flank shot, but the ZIS-3 gun was not effective against Tiger tanks. Soviet manuals for SU-76M crews usually instructed the gunner to aim for the tracks or gun barrels when facing Tigers. To improve the SU-76M&#x27;s anti-armour capabilities, armour-piercing composite rigid (APCR) and hollow charge projectiles were introduced. This gave the SU-76M a better chance against heavily armoured German vehicles. A low profile, a low noise signature and good mobility were other advantages of the SU-76M. This was ideal for organizing ambushes and sudden flank or rear strikes in close combat, where the ZIS-3 gun was sufficient against most German armoured fighting vehicles.

The maximum elevation angle of the SU-76M&#x27;s gun was the highest of all Soviet self-propelled guns. The maximum indirect fire distance was nearly 13 km. SU-76Ms were sometimes used as light artillery vehicles (like the German Wespe) for counter-battery fights, bombardments, indirect fire support. However, the power of the 76.2 mm shells was not sufficient in some cases.

The SU-76M was the single Soviet vehicle able to operate in swamps with minimal support from engineers. During the Belarus liberation campaign in 1944 it was extremely useful for organizing surprise attacks through swamps; bypassing heavy German defenses on firmer ground. Usually only lightly armed infantry could pass through large swampy areas. With SU-76M support, Soviet soldiers and engineers could effectively destroy enemy strongpoints and continue to advance.

One famous crewman was Rem Nikolaevich Ulanov. In his younger days he was a mechanic-driver and later a commander of a SU-76. He and some other soldiers called their SU-76 &quot;Columbina&quot; after the female Renaissance Italian Commedia dell&#x27;Arte personage.

The reliability and good driving performance of the SU-76M proved to be especially in demand at the final stages of World War II, during the liberation of Poland and battles in Germany. Relatively maneuverable and fast, SU-76Ms sometimes additionally armed with trophy machine guns and carried infantrymen on its armour were often included into vanguards to pursue the retreating enemy. SU-76M SPGs took part in combat operations on the Eastern Front until the end of World War II, and then in the Soviet–Japanese War. During World War II, 130 SU-76Ms were given to the Polish People&#x27;s Army.

In the post-war period, the SU-76M was in service with the Soviet Army until the early 1950s, and in the armies of a number of countries even longer. The SU-76M SPGs of the Korean People&#x27;s Army took part in the Korean War, a small number of them were captured and used by South Korea after the landing at Incheon. The SU-76M was in service with the Polish People&#x27;s Army until the mid-1950s. During the same period, SU-76Ms were used in the Czechoslovak and Romanian armies. The SU-76M served in the National People&#x27;s Army of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) until the early 1960s, and in the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic they served even longer - until the early 1970s.

== Surviving examples ==
Due to the large number of vehicles produced, many SU-76Ms have survived the post-war years, and most of the larger Russian military museums have examples of the SU-76M in their exhibitions. They can also be found at the German-Soviet War monuments or memorials in different Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian cities.

<text>The SU-122 (from &quot;Samokhodnaya Ustanovka 122 mm&quot;) was a Soviet self-propelled howitzer or assault gun used during World War II. The number &quot;122&quot; in the designation represents the caliber of the main armament, a 122 mm M-30S howitzer. The chassis was that of the T-34.

==Development history==
The Soviet High Command became interested in assault guns following the success of German Sturmgeschütz IIIs. Assault guns had some advantages over tanks with turrets. The lack of a turret made them cheaper to produce. They could be built with a larger fighting compartment and could be fitted with bigger and more powerful weapons on a given chassis. However, assault guns generally aim by orienting the entire vehicle, and were thus less suited for close combat than tanks with turrets.

In April 1942, design bureaus were asked to develop several assault guns with various armament: 76.2 mm ZiS-3 divisional field guns and 122 mm M-30 howitzers for infantry support, and 152 mm ML-20 howitzers for attacking enemy strongholds.

A prototype assault gun, armed with the 122 mm howitzer and built on the German Sturmgeschütz III chassis was developed, designated &quot;SG-122&quot;. Only 20 of these were completed. Production was halted when the vehicle was found to be hard to maintain and judged to be unsuccessful.

Simultaneously, an SPG based on the T-34 medium tank was also developed. Initially, the T-34&#x27;s chassis was selected for the 76.2 mm F-34 gun. This vehicle, the &quot;U-34&quot;, was created in the summer of 1942 at UZTM (Uralmashzavod – Uralsky Machine Building factory) design bureau, by N. W. Kurin and G. F. Ksjunin. It was a tank destroyer with the same armament as the T-34, but without a turret. The vehicle was 70 cm lower than a T-34, had thicker armor, and was 2 tonnes lighter. It did not enter production.

UZTM then worked on combining features of the &quot;U-34&quot; and the &quot;SG-122&quot;. Initial design work was completed between July and August 1942. The project emphasized minimizing modifications to the platform and the howitzer. It used the same chassis, superstructure, engine and transmission as the &quot;U-34&quot; and was armed with (the then new) 122 mm M-30S howitzer from F. F. Petrov&#x27;s design bureau. This vehicle also used the same gun bed cover and mountings as the SG-122, to keep costs low and simplify production. It had 45 mm thick frontal armor. The M-30S howitzer could be elevated or depressed between −3° and +26° and had 10° of traverse. The five-man crew consisted of a driver, gunner, commander and two loaders.

By 25 November 1942, the first &quot;U-35&quot; prototype was ready. Trials ran from 30 November to 19 December 1942, and uncovered various faults in the design, including insufficient elevation, a flawed shell transfer mechanism, poor ventilation for the crew compartment, and the fact that the commander had to assist in operating the gun, which made him unable to successfully carry out his other duties. The &quot;U-35&quot; entered service with the Red Army as the SU-35 (later renamed SU-122) despite these faults.

Production SU-122s were based on an improved prototype built after trials were conducted. They incorporated several modifications, including slightly less sloped front armor to ease production, modified layout of the fighting compartment (the location of crew member stations and ammunition racks were changed), fewer vision slots, and a periscope for the commander. The first production vehicles were completed before 1943.
==Production history==
SU-122 production began in December 1942 with 27 vehicles built that month. The original plan for production beyond that point was to produce 100 SU-122s each month. Production continued until the summer of 1943, by which time a total of 638 SU-122s had been built.

==Service history==
The first SU-122s produced in December 1942 were sent to training centers and two new combat units, the 1433rd and 1434th self-propelled artillery regiments. Initially, each of these mixed regiments consisted of two batteries with four SU-122s each and four batteries with four SU-76 tank destroyers each. Each regiment had an added SU-76 tank destroyer as a command vehicle. It was planned to raise 30 self-propelled artillery regiments operating within armoured and mechanized corps.

In January 1943, the 1433rd and 1434th self-propelled artillery regiments were sent to the Volkhov Front near Leningrad as part of the 54th Army. On 14 January, they saw combat for the first time in Smierdny region. After that, it was decided SU-122s should follow between 400 m and 600 m behind the attacking tanks; sometimes this distance was shortened to between 200 m and 300 m.

The use of SU-76 tank destroyers together with SU-122s proved unsuccessful. Based on combat experience, the organization of self-propelled artillery regiments was changed; the new regimental organization consisted of two batteries of SU-76 tank destroyers and three batteries of SU-122s, for a total of 20 self-propelled guns. In April, the organization of self-propelled artillery regiments was again changed. Separate regiments were created for SU-76 tank destroyers (light self-propelled artillery regiment) and SU-122s (medium self-propelled artillery regiment).

The medium self-propelled artillery regiment consisted of four batteries of four SU-122s each. Each regiment was also equipped with either an added SU-122 or a T-34 for the commander and a BA-64 armoured car. This organization remained in place until the start of 1944 when the SU-122 began to be replaced by the SU-152, ISU-122 and ISU-152 heavy self-propelled guns, and the SU-85 tank destroyers.

The SU-122 proved effective in its intended role of direct fire on strongholds. The massive concussion of the 122 mm high explosive round was reportedly enough to blow the turret off even a Tiger I if a direct hit was scored, a trait shared with the larger 152 mm howitzers. A new BP-460A high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) projectile was introduced in May 1943; however, its primitive warhead design was only minimally more effective than brute concussive effects of the older high explosive shell. However, like most howitzers, the accuracy of the M-30 was less than that of contemporary weapons designed for anti-tank warfare.

At least one SU-122 was captured by the German Army.

Few SU-122s survived the war. Currently only one exists and is on display in the Kubinka Tank Museum.

==Variants==
The SU-122 had no variants that went into mass production. The T-34 chassis of the SU-122 was further adapted as part of the later SU-85 self-propelled gun.

===SU-122M===
Even as the SU-122 was being mass-produced, its design was being refined primarily with an eye to reduce production costs. The M-30S armament proved poorly suited for purpose, in spite of its prior recommendation by the GAU RKKA artillery committee. The howitzer took a lot of space and required both commander and gunner to operate it in order to fire. Because of this, in January 1943, work began on fitting the SU-122 with a different howitzer.

The prototype SU-122M was built in April 1943. It featured a bigger fighting compartment as well as an individual driver&#x27;s hatch. The M-30S howitzer, mounted on the floor of the vehicle, was replaced by the more modern D-11 howitzer (a variant of U-11 howitzer). However, the SU-122M was not put into production due to a decision to proceed with the SU-85 instead.

===SU-122-III===
Another attempt to create an improved SU-122 replacement took an SU-85 chassis and paired it with the 122-mm D-6 howitzer, which was lighter and smaller than the U-11 howitzer. This was unsuccessful, due to the unreliability of the howitzer&#x27;s recoil mechanism and its poor anti-tank abilities. Subsequent wartime design work on 122 mm self-propelled howitzers was cancelled.

<text>Campbell River is a city in the Sayward Land District of British Columbia, Canada, on the east coast of Vancouver Island at the south end of Discovery Passage, which lies along the 50th parallel north along the important Inside Passage shipping route. Campbell River has a population (2021 census) of 35,138 and has long been touted as the &quot;salmon capital of the world.&quot; Campbell River and Region are near the communities of Quadra and the Discovery Islands, Sayward, Oyster River, Gold River, Tahsis and Zeballos.

Campbell River is served by the coast-spanning Island Highway, the nearby but now defunct Island Rail Corridor, and Campbell River Airport.

==History==
The first settlers known in the area were members of the Kʼómoks (Island Comox) and related Coast Salish peoples. During the 18th century, a migration of Kwakwakaʼwakw (Kwakʼwala-speaking) people of the Wakashan linguistic and cultural group migrated south from the area of Fort Rupert. Establishing themselves in the Campbell River area, they enslaved and later absorbed the Kʼómoks. These newcomers became infamous as raiders of the Coast Salish peoples farther south, who are known to history as the Euclataws (also spelled Yucultas), a variant on the Laich-kwil-tach, Lekwiltok or Legwildok, which is their name for themselves. There are two subdivisions of this group, also known as the Southern Kwakiutl: the Wekayi or Weiwaikai of the We Wai Kai Nation (Cape Mudge Indian Band) on Quadra Island and the Weiwaikum of the Campbell River Band located in and around the city of Campbell River.

Captain George Vancouver reached Campbell River in 1792 aboard the ships and . The channel between Quadra Island and Campbell River is named Discovery Passage after HMS &quot;Discovery&quot;. The captain and his botanist, Mr Archibald Menzies, encountered a small tribe of 350 natives who spoke the Salish language. A Laich-kwil-tach war party, heavily armed with European rifles, paddled south from Johnstone Strait in the middle of the 19th century and were in control of the area when came through on a cartography mission under Captain George Henry Richards around 1859. Dr Samuel Campbell was the ship surgeon, and historians believe his name was given to the river by Richards. The community took the name &quot;Campbell River&quot; when its post office was constructed in 1907. Likewise, the name of HMS &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s First Lieutenant Zachary Mudge is preserved in the nearby Cape Mudge.

Sports fishermen travelled to the area as early as the 1880s, especially after the tales from anglers such as Sir Richard Musgrave and Sir John Rogers. The formation of the Campbell River Tyee Club in 1924, over concern regarding over-fishing of the salmon stocks, served to popularize the area among fishermen. E.P. Painter, for instance, moved to Campbell River the following year and opened his Painter&#x27;s Lodge in 1929. Painter&#x27;s Lodge attracted clientèle from Hollywood and regular patrons included Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Commercial fishing was a large industry for many years. The town&#x27;s magistrate Roderick Haig-Brown purchased a fishing cabin on Campbell River and wrote a number of books on fly fishing for both sport fishermen and conservationists.

Industrial logging took off in the 1920s with Merrill Ring and Company, Bloedel, Stewart and Welch and Comox Logging. A large forest fire started near Buttle Lake and burned much of the valley in 1938. Rock Bay, Menzies Bay, and Englewood all were big logging camps.

After 1912, Campbell River became a supply point for northern Vancouver Island, Quadra Island, and Cortes Island. The E and N Railway was surveyed to Campbell River, yet it only reached Courtenay, south. In its original conception, it would have been the last leg of the transcontinental railway, which had been proposed to run down Bute Inlet after crossing the British Columbia Interior, connecting to Vancouver Island just north of Campbell River at Seymour Narrows. After the Second World War, Campbell River became a boomtown and industrial centre with the building of the John Hart Dam, the Elk Falls Mill, and nearby mills in Tahsis and Gold River. Logging and mining in the area prospered. There is a lead zinc mine nearby as well as coal mines, while a large copper mine operated to the north.

In recent years Campbell River, about halfway up Vancouver Island, has continued to mark the boundary between the more developed south and the wild and natural areas of the northern part of the island. 
Local fish hatcheries help to maintain salmon stocks for the fishing industry.

There is uncertainty about the source of the name of the city. It is thought that the river and the city may have been named for Dr. Samuel Campbell, who was assistant surgeon aboard &quot;HMS Plumper&quot; from 1857 to 1861.

Campbell River has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csb&quot;), very closely bordering on oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;).

<text>Pietro Cavallini (1259 – ) was an Italian painter and mosaic designer working during the late Middle Ages.

==Biography==
Little is known about his biography, though it is known he was from Rome, since he signed &quot;pictor romanus&quot;.

His first notable works were the fresco cycles for the Basilica di San Paolo fuori le Mura, with stories from the New and Old Testament (1277–1285). They were destroyed by the fire of 1823.

His &quot;Last Judgment&quot; in the Church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere in Rome, painted c. 1293 and considered Cavallini&#x27;s masterwork, demonstrates an artistic style known as Roman naturalism. This naturalism influenced the work of artists working in other Italian cities such as Florence and Siena.

In the Sienese school, the influence of classical Roman forms combined with the Byzantine artistic heritage of the region and with northern Gothic influences to form a naturalized painting style that was one of the origins of International Gothic.

In Florence, the influence of classical Roman forms combined with the Byzantine artistic heritage of the region to spark an interest in volumetric, naturalistic paintings and statuary. This work is in stark contrast to the comparatively flat and ornamented Gothic, International Gothic, and Byzantine styles.

This naturalism is also evident in the Basilica of San Francesco d&#x27;Assisi in Assisi, built in the early years of the 13th century in honour of the newly canonized St. Francis. As the shrine was commissioned by the Roman church, its interior is painted in the Roman tradition. The identities of the artists at work in this church are for the most part not known but at least one team of artists came from Rome. Owing to the similarity of the work in San Francesco to that of Florentine artist Giotto, he was traditionally credited with some of the frescoes, although most scholars no longer believe he was involved.

Giotto&#x27;s work in the Arena Chapel (also known as the Scrovegni Chapel) at Padua strongly shows the influence of stylized Roman naturalism in a newly individualized style which would come to characterize the work of Florentine Renaissance artists.

From 1308 Cavallini worked in Naples at the court of King Charles II of Anjou, notably in the churches of San Domenico Maggiore (1308) and Santa Maria Donnaregina (1317), together with his fellow Roman Filippo Rusuti. He returned to Rome before 1325, beginning the external decoration of the Basilica di San Paolo fuori le Mura in 1321, with a series of Byzantine-style mosaics.

Cavallini&#x27;s pupils included Giovanni di Bartolommeo.

==Works==
His works include:
*&quot;Jael and Tisseran&quot; (date unknown), watercolour
*&quot;Scenes from the life of Mary&quot; (c. 1298), mosaics at the apse of Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome. The six scenes were made by the order of Bertoldo Stefaneschi, brother of Cardinal Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi, and include a donor portrait of him. These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts at perspective:
**&quot;Nativity of the Virgin&quot;
**&quot;Annunciation&quot;
**&quot;The Birth of Jesus&quot;
**&quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;
**&quot;Presentation in the Temple&quot;
**&quot;Dormition&quot;
*&quot;The Last Judgment&quot; (1295–1298), part of fresco cycle at Santa Cecilia in Trastevere in Rome.

The apse paintings at San Giorgio al Velabro, Rome, have been attributed to him on the basis of stylistic similarity to the Trastevere paintings.

The apse mosaic of the San Crisogono church in the Trastevere district, depicting the &quot;Mary with Sts. Sebastian and Chrysogonos&quot;, is also attributed to Cavallini.

The illustrated Clement Bible has been attributed to Cavallini or his workshop.

<text>The SU-85 (&quot;Samokhodnaya ustanovka&quot; 85) was a Soviet self-propelled gun used during World War II, based on the chassis of the T-34 medium tank. Earlier Soviet self-propelled guns were meant to serve as either assault guns, such as the SU-122, or as tank destroyers; the SU-85 fell into the latter category. As with the other AFVs in the SU series, the designation &quot;85&quot; refers to the vehicle&#x27;s main armament, the 85 mm D-5T gun.

== Development history ==
Early in World War II, Soviet tanks such as the T-34 and KV-1 had adequate firepower to defeat any of the German tanks then available. By the fall of 1942, Soviet forces began to encounter the new German Tiger tank, with armor too thick to be penetrated by the 76.2 mm guns used in the T-34 and KV tanks at a safe range. The Soviet command also had reports of the Panther tank, that was in development then and possessed thicker armor than the Tiger; both represented an advance in German tank design. Although the Panther was not seen in combat until July 1943, the new generation of German vehicles meant the Red Army would need a new, more powerful main gun for their armoured formations.

In May 1943, work was begun on a new anti-tank gun. Military planners directed the design bureaus of both Gen. Vasiliy Grabin and Gen. Fyodor Petrov to modify the 85 mm anti-aircraft gun for use as an anti-tank weapon. Petrov&#x27;s bureau developed the D-5 85 mm gun. Though much too large for the T-34 or KV-1 turret, it was thought the gun could be mounted upon the chassis of the SU-122 self-propelled gun to give the weapon mobility. The version of this gun intended to be mounted upon the SU-85 was called the D-5S, with the &quot;S&quot; standing for self-propelled. Initially the production factory at Uralmash rejected the proposed design. Nevertheless, the administrators at Uralmash were persuaded to proceed, and the new design was put into production. The weapon was later modified to include a telescopic sight and a new ball gun mantlet. This vehicle was retitled the SU-85-II.

== Description ==
The SU-85 was a modification of the earlier SU-122 self-propelled howitzer, essentially replacing the 122 mm M-30S howitzer of the SU-122 with a D-5T high-velocity 85 mm antitank gun. The D-5T was capable of penetrating the Tiger I from 1000 m. The vehicle had a low profile and excellent mobility. Initially given an armored commander&#x27;s cap on the first batch, the SU-85&#x27;s observational optics were improved by the introduction of a standard commander&#x27;s cupola - the same as on the T-34/76 model 1942 - in addition to the already existing prismatic observation sights installed in left side and rear. On later vehicles, the same optics were added, allowing all-around observation.

== Production history ==

SU-85 production started in mid-1943, with the first vehicles reaching their units by August. When the up-gunned T-34-85 medium tank entered mass production in the spring of 1944, there was no point in continuing production of a tank destroyer without superior firepower. In light of this, SU-85 production was stopped in late 1944 after 2,650 vehicles had been produced. It was replaced on the production lines by the SU-100 tank destroyer, armed with the more powerful 100 mm D-10S gun, but due to delays with 100 mm ammo, a stopgap version called SU-85M appeared in September 1944, which was SU-100 fitted with 85 mm gun, already with thicker frontal armor and commander&#x27;s cupola.

== Service history ==
The SU-85 entered combat in August 1943. It saw active service across the Eastern Front until the end of the war. Though a capable weapon, it was found that its 85 mm weapon was not adequate to penetrate the armour of the larger German armoured fighting vehicles. It was replaced by the SU-100.

The SU-85 was withdrawn from Soviet service soon after the war, and was exported to many Soviet client states in Europe and elsewhere. Some SU-85s were converted to use as command and recovery vehicles. Countries such as North Korea and Vietnam kept it in service for many years.

<text>The SU-100 (&quot;Samokhodnaya Ustanovka&quot; 100) is a Soviet tank destroyer armed with the D-10S 100 mm anti-tank gun in a casemate superstructure. It was used extensively during the last year of World War II and saw service for many years afterwards with the armies of Soviet allies around the world.

== Development ==

The SU-85 was developed from the chassis of the T-34 tank replacing the turret with a larger, fixed superstructure that allowed a larger gun to be fitted: the 85 mm D-5 gun, providing dramatically upgraded firepower compared to the T-34&#x27;s 76.2 mm models. Introduced to service in 1943, the SU-85 was quickly rendered obsolete as a new tank design featured the same gun on the T-34-85.

This prompted the design of a more advanced turretless tank destroyer with an even more powerful cannon. Development was conducted under supervision of L. I. Gorlitskiy, chief designer of all medium Soviet self-propelled guns. The work started in February 1944 and the first prototype of the SU-100, &quot;Object 138&quot;, was delivered in March. After intensive testing with different models of 100 mm gun Soviet engineers approved the D-10S gun for mass production. This gun was developed in Constructors Bureau of Artillery Factory No. 9 under the guidance of F. F. Petrov. After the Second World War this gun was installed on T-54 and T-55 tanks; these vehicles and their derivatives were in service forty years after initial development.

It was built at the UZTM (Russian abbreviation УЗТМ for Уральский Завод Тяжелого Машиностроения – Ural Heavy Machinery Factory, also called &quot;Uralmash&quot;) in Yekaterinburg. The SU-100 quickly proved itself to be able to penetrate around of vertical armor from a range of and the sloped front armor of the German Panther from (with APCBC round).

The hull of the SU-100 had major improvements over the SU-85; the thickness of the front armour was increased from with a constructional armour slope of 55 degrees, making armour as effective as 125 mm, which forced the Panzer IV and StuG III to all but the closest ranges and the Tiger I having to close in at less than 1 km. Additional improvements were the commander&#x27;s workplace, as it now was made in a small sponson on the right side of the hull; combined with the commander&#x27;s cupola this improved the commander&#x27;s effectiveness. Its German &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot;-family counterparts — the Jagdpanzer IV, Jagdpanther and Jagdtiger, by comparison, lacked this key piece of observational equipment. On the other hand, the SU-100&#x27;s optics were a little inferior (4x optics vs German 5x optics). For better ventilation two ventilator units were installed, instead of only one as in the SU-85. Mass production began in September 1944.

== Service history ==
The SU-100 was introduced in October 1944 and quickly became popular with Soviet tank crews as its gun could penetrate virtually any German tank then in service until being outmatched by the Tiger II. The gun was excellent, being able to penetrate the Tiger I at 2 km with APCBC rounds while its APHE rounds could penetrate a max of 218 mm of armour. The SU-100 especially saw extensive service during the last year of the war. It was used &quot;en masse&quot; in Hungary in March 1945, when Soviet forces defeated the German Operation Frühlingserwachen offensive at Lake Balaton. And although not intended for it, the SU-100 was also used in the Battle of Berlin because its gun could deal with heavy fortifications. However, its lack of a machine gun made it need aircraft and infantry support. By July 1945, 2,335 SU-100s had been built.

The vehicle remained in service with the Red Army well after the war; production continued in the Soviet Union until 1947 and into the 1950s in Czechoslovakia. It was withdrawn from Soviet service in 1967 but many vehicles were transferred to reserve stocks. Some exist to this day in the Russian Army holding facilities.

Many Warsaw Pact countries also used the SU-100, as did Soviet allies such as Egypt, Angola and Cuba. A few SU-100 were delivered to Yugoslavia after the war, under the designation M-44. The SU-100 saw service in the fighting that accompanied the 1956 Suez Crisis, in which the Egyptians used SU-100s against Israel&#x27;s M4 Sherman tanks. The vehicle was also utilized in the 1967 Six-Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War. It was modified slightly to adapt it to the sandy conditions of the Middle East, thus creating the SU-100M variant . Exported SU-100s continued in service until the 1970s, and in some countries, even later. The Su-100 saw service during the Yugoslav Wars, but was quickly retired due to a lack of spare parts, despite its satisfactory performance. The SU-100 remains in use by the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army and the Korean People&#x27;s Army Ground Force.

SU-100s entered service with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) of China after 1 December 1950 when Soviet forces left Dalian. The armaments in Dalian were sold to China, including 99 SU-100s, 18 IS-2 heavy tanks, and 224 T-34s, with which PLA formed its 1st Mechanised Division.

In April 2015, a SU-100 self-propelled gun was photographed being used in Yemen as part of the ongoing conflict. Video evidence uploaded to YouTube in November 2016 showed an apparent SU-100 being knocked out by an anti-tank guided missile in Yemen.

<text>The SU-152 () is a Soviet self-propelled heavy howitzer used during World War II.

It mounted a 152 mm gun-howitzer on the chassis of a KV-1S heavy tank. Later production used an IS tank chassis and was re-designated ISU-152. Because of its adopted role as an impromptu heavy tank destroyer, capable of knocking out heavy German armoured vehicles such as the Tiger and Elefant, it was nicknamed &quot;Zveroboy&quot; (&quot;Beast Slayer&quot;).

== Development ==

The Stalingrad counteroffensive, Operation Uranus, exposed the Red Army&#x27;s urgent need for mobile heavy guns to destroy German fortifications. At the time Soviet front-line ground units did not possess sufficient firepower to deal with pillboxes and other fortifications.

Close support of artillery and combat engineers was an important factor in the success of Operation Uranus. However, with rare exceptions, Soviet guns and howitzers at this time were towed rather than self-propelled. This lack of mobility was exacerbated by the absence of roads, the presence of deep snow and a scarcity of artillery tractors.

Towed guns were also vulnerable to counterattack while moving, especially since they were often hauled by horses or their crews. The 152 mm heavy howitzers were particularly difficult to maneuver owing to their great weight. They were incapable of crossing rivers on anything but tank bridges and were prone to being abandoned after becoming mired.

In November 1942, the State Defense Committee therefore ordered the development of a heavy self-propelled gun with a 152.4mm ML-20 howitzer. 

The Red Army had dedicated anti-fortification vehicles in the pre-war period, such as the KV-2 heavy tank armed with the 152.4 mm M-10 howitzer. However, mass production of KV-2s ceased in October 1941, when the Kirov Works had to be evacuated from Leningrad to Chelyabinsk. An unknown number were still operating in 1942.

The new anti-fortification vehicle was designed with the same purpose in mind, but with higher mobility, heavier armor, reduced production cost, and the more powerful and accurate ML-20 152mm gun. Mounting the ML-20 in a turret was impossible due to its length and recoil, and it was decided that the new vehicle should have a non-rotating gun mounted in a fixed casemate-style superstructure.

Several other anti-fortification vehicle projects had all been halted. Later in the war these projects were restarted. In December 1942 three different designs of &quot;pillbox killer&quot; vehicles were introduced by engineer groups from the major Soviet artillery and tank factories. All of these designs used the ML-20 gun as a primary armament, with the KV-1S heavy tank chassis. After some discussion, the project of Josef Kotin was chosen for mass production. This design successfully combined the ML-20 and KV-1S chassis with minimal expense.

The project was designated &quot;KV-14&quot; and assembly of the first prototype (called &quot;Object 236&quot;) began on December 31, 1942. It was completed after 25 days. Plant trials of &quot;Object 236&quot; began on January 25, 1943. After a number of successful plant tests the more stringent state tests began. &quot;Object 236&quot; succeeded again. On February 14, 1943 the State Defense Committee accepted it for Red Army service and immediately launched it into mass production at the &quot;Chelyabinskiy Kirovskiy Zavod&quot; (Chelyabinsk Kirov Plant, ChKZ). The designation of the series of self-propelled guns was changed from KV-14 to SU-152. The ML-20 gun was slightly modified for mounting in the SU-152 — some handles were moved for improved gunner comfort. This variant had the designation ML-20S. The muzzle velocity and external ballistics were identical to the original towed ML-20 gun.

Although designed with no consideration for the anti-tank role, the SU-152 proved to have surprisingly good anti-tank capabilities due to the ML-20S&#x27;s extremely heavy high explosive projectiles. Purpose-built anti-tank guns of the period usually relied on small, high-velocity solid projectiles, optimised for punching through armour. Since the SU-152, like all SU-series self-propelled guns was not designed with tank killing in mind, no AP projectiles were issued to crews and no initial tests against armor were conducted. However, tests performed on captured Tiger tanks in early 1943 showed that the SU-152 was able to destroy them at any range with some reliability (in 1943, this is only vehicle in Russian service capable of doing so) by dislodging the turret through blast effect. This discovery spurred massive SU-152 production and the formation of self-propelled artillery units, which then functioned as heavy tank destroyer battalions.

After the SU-152 began mass production, it was slightly modified to improve reliability and effectiveness. Initially the SU-152 lacked a machine gun, which was a severe weakness in urban warfare and other close combat. To solve this problem the DShK 12.7 mm anti-aircraft gun installation was developed in the summer of 1943. Some SU-152s received it after repair. The SU-152 was the last member of the KV family of tanks in mass production, and was replaced by the ISU-152 on the ChKZ production lines in December 1943. The exact number of SU-152s produced differs even in Russian sources, with the most common figures being 670 or 704.

The SU-152s that survived World War II were withdrawn from Soviet Army service in 1958.

== Construction and design ==

The SU-152 followed the same, fully enclosed casemated design as most other Soviet self-propelled guns. The fully armoured hull was divided into two compartments: one for the crew, gun, and ammunition in the front of the hull, and one for the engine and transmission in the rear. The hull was welded from rolled armour plates of different thickness — 75, 60, 30 and 20 mm. The front hull and superstructure armour plates were sloped for better vehicle protection, while side armour was vertical. Lower front hull and rear armour plates were cylindrical, and relatively complex in their method of production. The ML-20S gun-howitzer was mounted slightly to the right of centre with a limited traverse in a range of 12 degrees. Three of the crew were to the left of the gun, with the driver to the front, then the gunner and lastly the loader. The vehicle commander and breech mechanism operator were to the right.

The suspension consisted of 12 torsion bars for the six road wheels (each 600 mm in diameter) on each side. The drive sprockets were at the back. Each track was made up of 90 stamped links, each link of 608 mm width. The normal distance between two connected links was 160 mm. There were three internal fuel tanks, two in the crew area and one in the engine compartment, for a total capacity of 600–615 litres. These were usually enhanced by four unconnected external fuel tanks, which could hold an additional 360 litres of fuel. A 24-volt electrical power supply came from a 1 kW GT-4563A generator with a RRA-24 voltage relay regulator unit and four 6STE-128 accumulator batteries with a total capacity of 256 ampere-hours. This electrical equipment was common in contemporary Soviet armoured vehicles. The generator and accumulator batteries fed all other electrical equipment — the ST-700 electric starter motor, a radio set, an intercom, external and internal lights, and illumination of gunsight scales.

For observation from the interior, all roof hatches had periscopes along with two gun sights: the telescopic ST-10 (СТ-10) and a panoramic sight. For crew communication a TPU-4-BisF intercom was fitted, and for inter-vehicle communication there was a single radio. The first-series SU-152 was equipped with the 9R, then 10R and finally the 10RK-26 radio set. These radios were better than Soviet equipment at the start of the war, but inferior to German equipment.

The crew was equipped with two PPSh submachine guns and 25 F1 grenades for short-range self-defence.

== Combat history ==
Although not designed for the role, the SU-152 proved to be a cheap and effective heavy tank killer, second only to the SU-100 as a Soviet antitank vehicle, as well as successful at its original role against infantry and fortifications, serving a similar role to the SU-100Y.

The SU-152 was produced in large numbers throughout 1943, with the first SU-152s being issued to new heavy mechanized gun regiments raised in May 1943. The first regiment arrived at Kursk with only 12 guns, and was brought up to its full strength of 21 guns during the fighting.

Disadvantages of the vehicle included a low rate of fire due to the heavy ammunition, low ammunition storage (only 20 rounds), and a cramped and un-ergonomic crew compartment. Its armor protection was only adequate; the 65 mm of 30-degree sloped frontal armor still left it vulnerable frontally to the 88 mm KwK 36/43 guns of the Tiger and Ferdinand/Elefant at long range and the 7.5 cm KwK 40 high-velocity gun of the Panzer IV and StuG III/IV at medium and short ranges (and from any range from the flanks or rear). The 152 mm gun, while having a maximum range far superior to the 88 mm, was still essentially a heavy howitzer with a shorter accurate range than the 88 mm and 7.5 cm guns while being vulnerable to return fire at the same distance. This made it most effective for use against entrenched enemies, where the German heavy tanks&#x27; advantages could be nullified and the SU-152s could utilize their one-shot kill potential.
Since it was intended as a self-propelled artillery piece rather than a true tank destroyer, the SU-152 was generally issued with standard HE rounds rather than armor-piercing projectiles. The 152mm HE round produced a massive blast that did not rely on velocity for its effectiveness, making it effective against any German tank, including the Tiger and Elefant (although still less effective than penetrating projectiles). It was capable of dislodging the turret of a Tiger tank (at any range), and numerous German armored fighting vehicles were claimed destroyed or damaged by SU-152s during the Battle of Kursk.

However, it proved less reliable at permanently destroying the Ferdinand heavy tank destroyer, whose bulkier, simplified design was more resistant to non-penetrating HE blast. While the Russians knocked out at least seven German Ferdinands in SU-152 ambushes at Kursk during one operation, German after-action engineers were able to repair, recrew and return nearly all to battle the next day. This has been attributed to the gun&#x27;s blast killing the crew and destroying the vehicle&#x27;s interior via concussion and spalling without harming the ammunition supply or chassis. Soviet SU-152 crews were ordered to continue firing at incapacitated tanks until their turrets were knocked off, but the Ferdinand did not have a turret.

After Kursk, the 152 mm BR-540 solid-core AP round was produced in small numbers and issued to heavy tank destroyer battalions as a penetrating projectile, but the gun&#x27;s low velocity made the AP round no more accurate and only moderately more effective than the standard HE round (which could also be used against infantry).
After Kursk, the SU-152 played an important role in destroying German fortifications during the Operation Bagration offensive, this being the vehicle&#x27;s original design goal..From the second half of 1943 to the end of World War II SU-152s were used on all Soviet fronts, from Finland to the Crimea. Due to combat losses and mass production ceasing in December 1943, the number of SU-152s in the Soviet Army decreased. Eventually SU-152s were replaced by the more reliable and better-armored ISU-152, which used the same armament and ammunition in the same dual-purpose role. Despite this, the SU-152 remained in Soviet Army service throughout World War II and post-war until 1958.

== Operators ==
* - Captured units.
* - 3 vehicles used for training from 1945 until 1949.

== Organization ==

The SU-152 was used by the Independent Heavy Self-propelled Artillery Regiments (OTSAP, ОТСАП, in Russian, from &quot;Otdel&#x27;niy Tyazheliy Samokhodno-Artilleriyskiy Polk&quot;, Отдельный Тяжелый Самоходно-Артиллерийский Полк). Initially each OTSAP had twelve SU-152s, divided into three batteries of four vehicles. One KV-1S tank served as a commander&#x27;s vehicle. After November 1943 the OTSAP organisation changed to 21 vehicles per regiment.

<text>The ISU-122 (acronym of&quot; Istrebitelnaja - or Iosif Stalin-based - Samokhodnaya Ustanovka 122&quot;) was a Soviet assault gun used during World War II, mostly in the anti-tank role.

==History and purpose==
A prototype of the ISU-122 (in Russian ИСУ-122) heavy self-propelled gun was built at the Chelyabinsk Kirov Plant (&quot;Chelyabinskiy Kirovskiy Zavod (ChKZ)&quot;, Chelyabinsk, Russia), in December 1943. The design shared the chassis of the ISU-152 self-propelled gun and differed only in armament, having an A-19S 122-mm gun as its main weapon instead of the ISU-152&#x27;s ML-20S gun-howitzer. Towed versions of these guns used the same carriage: 52-L-504A (Russian designation 52-Л-504А), so installation of an A-19 instead of an ML-20 gun was not a difficult task. After completing development of the ISU-152, ChKZ engineers mounted the A-19 gun on the ISU-152 chassis to create &quot;Object 242&quot; — the first ISU-122 prototype. It was successfully tested, but not immediately launched into mass production.

At that time, all ISU hulls were being equipped with the ML-20S gun-howitzer, but the production of hulls increased quickly and there was a lack of ML-20S tubes in the beginning of 1944. State authorities ordered these uncompleted hulls armed with an A-19 gun (specifically with the A-19S variant, slightly modified for the self-propelled gun mount). A further advantage of rearming the ISU was increased direct fire range against heavy German tanks. For these reasons, the State Defense Committee adopted &quot;Object 242&quot; for Red Army service as the ISU-122 on 12 March 1944. In April 1944, the first series ISU-122 left the ChKZ production lines.

The A-19S gun had a manual-piston breech, which reduced the rate of fire from 2.5 to 1.5 shots per minute. Soviet designers developed the D-25 by modernizing the A-19S&#x27;s breech, creating a semi-automatic variant of the 122-mm gun. The D-25 gun was installed in IS-2 tanks as a priority, but in September 1944 became available for self-propelled guns. The prototype ISU vehicle, armed with a D-25S was designated &quot;Object 249&quot; and successfully passed plant and state testing. The fire rate was improved to 2 to 3 shots per minute and with two strong experienced loaders the rate of fire reached 4 shots per minute. Due to the muzzle brake reducing recoil forces, the D-25 had a smaller recoil buffer than the A-19. This improved the crew&#x27;s work conditions and allowed for a smaller, lighter gun shield with the same armour thickness.

After testing, &quot;Object 249&quot; was immediately launched in mass production as the ISU-122S (ИСУ-122С) self-propelled gun. However, the original ISU-122 remained in production (along with the ISU-152) due to a large stock of A-19 guns (the ML-20 and D-25 came directly from artillery factories). Mass production of the ISU-122 and ISU-122S ceased at the end of 1945. ChKZ produced 1,735 ISU-122 and 675 ISU-122S variants in total.

After World War II, many surviving ISU-122s were rebuilt as very large calibre gun chassis or supply vehicles. The small number of ISU-122s that kept their original armament were modernized in 1958. This modernization was not as complete as that of the ISU-152. Most ISU-122s did not receive a new engine, only upgraded gun sights and radio sets. In the beginning of 1960, the ISU-122 was withdrawn from Soviet Army service (the ISU-152 served much longer). Some disarmed ISU-122s were transferred to civil organizations, to be used as emergency vehicles on Soviet railways or as tracked transport in Arctic areas of the Soviet Union. However, most ISU-122s (both variants) remained in service longer in Warsaw Pact states and, with unconfirmed reports, in service in North Korea and China, having both variants.

== Variants ==

Some vehicles were fitted with a 12.7 mm DShK anti-aircraft machine gun.

*ISU-122S - In later models, the A-19 gun was modified to have a semi-automatic breech block. This gun was designated D-25S, and the vehicle mounting it ISU-122S. The modification increased rate of fire from 1.5 rounds/minute to 3 rounds/minute. The ISU-122S variant is recognizable by its ball-shaped gun mantlet and double-baffle muzzle brake. The ISU-122S model was coded &#x27;type 249&#x27; by the German&#x27;s in their reporting. 

== Construction and design ==
Construction of the ISU-122 and ISU-152 is the same except for the gun mounting, sights and ammunition stowage. The A-19S or D-25S cannons of the ISU-122 had 18 degrees elevation angle and 30 rounds of ammunition (the ISU-152 had 20 degrees and 20 rounds respectively). The A-19S cannon was equipped with an ST-18 (СТ-18) telescopic sight and the D-25S cannon was equipped with a TSh-17 (ТШ-17) sight. Both types of sights had maximal exact targeting distance of 1.5 km (the ISU-152 could manage only 900 m). Maximum direct fire range of the A-19S or D-25S cannons was 5 km, much further than these sights&#x27; targeting abilities. For direct or indirect firing on distances over 1.5 km the gunner used the second, panoramic sight.

The ISU-122 had a five-man crew; their location and roles were identical to those of ISU-152 crewmen. The ISU-122S was used with either four- or five-man crews since the semi-automatic breech allowed for a reasonable fire rate with a crew of four; the place of the absent loader was often taken up with additional ammunition. With a five-man crew (two loaders), the ISU-122S demonstrated a better fire rate than with four men.

== Organisation ==
The organisation of military units utilizing the ISU-122 was the same as with the ISU-152. Soviet Army commanders tried not to mix the ISU-122 and the ISU-152 in one regiment or brigade, although there were some units equipped with both types. The different armament of the ISU-122 and the ISU-152 caused problems with ammunition supplies and logistics. Another disadvantage of mixed-type units was a doubling of the calculations required for massed indirect fire.

== Combat history ==
The ISU-122 was used as a powerful assault gun, a self-propelled howitzer, and a long-range tank destroyer, the same as with the SU-152 and ISU-152 heavy self-propelled guns in general. However, these vehicles differed in their combat use. The primary application of the ISU-122 was as a tank destroyer, while the SU/ISU-152 tended more towards the assault gun role. With the same hull as the IS-2, the ISU-122 had good armour performance but very good performance with high-explosive rounds. The 122-mm gun had great potential, although the gun&#x27;s abilities were somewhat reduced by the available projectiles and its lack of accuracy. In 1944, the BR-471 was the sole armour-piercing round available. An improved version, the BR-471B (БР-471Б), was developed in early 1945, but was available in quantity only after World War II ended. In extremis, the ISU-122 engaged enemy heavy armour with OF-471 (ОФ-471) high explosive projectiles. These shells had a mass of 25 kg, a muzzle velocity of 800 m/s, and were equipped with a 3 kg TNT charge. Mechanical shock and explosion was often enough to knock out enemy AFVs without any armour penetration.

For urban combat, ISU-122s were utilized as assault guns, but with a lower efficiency in comparison to the SU/ISU-152. In general, Red Army commanders viewed the ISU-122 as a good assault gun. The OF-471 projectile was powerful enough against unprotected and entrenched infantry, pillboxes, and fortified buildings. In urban combat, the long barrel of the 122 mm cannon sometimes made maneuvering difficult.

Use of the ISU-122 as a self-propelled howitzer was rare, although its maximum range of fire exceeded 14 km. Usually, the ISU-122 delivered indirect fire to the enemy during rapid advances when support from towed artillery was not available.

== Surviving examples ==

Most of the ISU-122s produced survived the Second World War and examples remain, but only a few of the surviving ISU-122s kept their initial appearance. Many were rebuilt or scrapped in the mid 1960s. The number of ISU-122s preserved in museums and memorials is substantially lower than surviving ISU-152s. ISU 122s can be seen in the Military Historical Museum of Artillery, Engineers and Signal Corps in St Petersburg, the Kubinka Tank Museum, the Central Museum of the Russian Army, the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War in Kyiv (where it is an ISU-152 crudely modified with spare D-25T gun, labeled as ISU-122) and other tank museums and World War II memorials in Poland and Belarus.

<text>The ISU-152 (, meaning &quot;IS tank based self-propelled installation with 152mm caliber gun&quot;) is a Soviet self-propelled gun developed and used during World War II. It was unofficially nicknamed Zveroboy (; &quot;beast killer&quot;) in response to several large German tanks and guns coming into service, including Tigers and Panthers. Since the ISU-152&#x27;s gun was mounted in a casemate, aiming it was awkward, and had to be done by repositioning the entire vehicle using the tracks. Therefore, it was used as mobile artillery to support more mobile infantry and armor attacks. It continued service into the 1970s and was used in several campaigns and countries.

==History==

The beginnings of the ISU-152 came on 24 January 1943, when the first prototype of the SU-152 was unveiled. This was a fully enclosed 152mm gun-howitzer on the KV-1S tank chassis. It was designated &#x27; (&quot;Object 236&quot;) . Object 236 was completed in Factory No. 100 in Chelyabinsk, and was tested successfully from 24 January to 7 February 1943. On 14 February the vehicle was adopted and put into production under the KV-14&quot;&#x27; (&quot;кв&quot;-14) designation; in April 1943 the designation was changed to SU-152&quot; (&quot;СУ&quot;-152).

Although the SU-152 was successful in combat, production of the KV-1S tank chassis was ending, which made the modernisation of the vehicle necessary, using the new IS tank chassis. On 25 May 1943 the administration of Factory No. 100 ordered the modernisation of the SU-152, which included increased armour protection and other improvements. Development began in July 1943, under the supervision of Josef Kotin, the chief designer of Soviet heavy tanks, and G. N. Moskvin as the main designer.

The new design, designated IS-152 (&quot;ИС&quot;-152), was tested from September to November 1943. Testing revealed a large number of deficiencies, which sent it back for further improvement. On 6 November 1943 an order was issued for adoption of the improved variant, under the ISU-152 () designation, and in December production began at the Chelyabinsk Kirovsk Plant, replacing the SU-152.

==Design==

On 15 April 1942, at the plenum of the artillery committee, where the development of assault guns for support of the infantry was discussed, the necessity of also developing assault guns capable of destroying fortified positions was acknowledged. It was intended these assault guns would be armed with a 152.4 mm gun-howitzer and used for penetration of the enemy defence in the offensive operations planned for 1942–1943. This resulted in the development of the Object 236, and eventually the SU-152, which concept was later continued and further developed with the ISU-152.

The ISU-152 followed the same design as most other Soviet self-propelled guns. The fully armoured hull was divided into two compartments: fighting compartment for the crew, gun and ammunition in the front of the hull, and engine and transmission in the rear. The gun was mounted slightly to the right of centre with a limited traverse of 12 degrees left and right. The crew consisted of four or five men placed in the superstructure. Three of the crew were to the left of the gun: driver to the front, then gunner and last the loader. The vehicle commander and lockman (who operated the gun breech) were to the right: commander to the front and the lockman behind. When the crew consisted of four men, the loading was carried out by the lockman.

The suspension consisted of twelve torsion bars for the six road wheels on either side. The drive sprockets were at the back, and the front idlers were identical to the road wheels. Each track was made up of 90 links. There were three internal fuel tanks, two in the crew area and one in the engine compartment. These were usually supplemented with four unconnected external fuel tanks. 12- and 24-volt electrical power supplies came from a 1 kW generator feeding four accumulator batteries.

For observation from the interior, all roof hatches had periscopes and there were two gun sights: telescopic ST-10 (СТ-10) and panoramic. For crew communication a TPU-4-BisF intercom was fitted, and for inter-vehicle communication there was a single 10R or 10RK radio. These were better than Soviet equipment at the start of the war but still inferior to German equivalents.

The crew were given two PPSh submachine guns with 1491 rounds and 20 F-1 grenades for short-range self-defence.

The ISU-152 was armed with the same gun as the SU-152, but it used the hull of the IS-1 tank instead of the KV-1S. Later in the war the ISU-152 was further improved. It used the hull of the IS-2 or IS-2 model 1944 tank, the armour of the mantlet was increased, the gun was replaced by newer variants, a 12.7×108 mm DShK anti-aircraft machine gun was installed by the right forward hatch and later its ammunition capacity increased, the 10R radio set was upgraded to a 10RK and the fuel capacity was increased.

Some ISU-152s were equipped with even larger external fuel tanks, two tanks on the rear hull deck, in addition to the four external fuel tanks — each, maximum — or with two smaller additional external fuel tanks, on the hull rear. This option was probably available for the post-war ISU-152 variants.

Between December 1943 and May 1945, 1,885 ISU-152s were built. Mass production ceased in 1947, with 3,242 vehicles produced in total.

Post-war ISU-152 modernisation included installation of night vision sights, replacing of the V-2IS engine with the V-54K, the 12.7mm machine gun was replaced by a newer variant, the ammunition capacity increased to 30 rounds, additional armor, automotive improvements and significant increase of the main fuel capacity.

==Variants==
The initial variant was developed in 1943. The factory designation was Object 241 (Объект 241). It was armed with the 152.4 mm ML-20S (МЛ-20С) model 1937 gun-howitzer, with a barrel length of over 4.2 metres (27.9 calibers). This gun had a maximum range of . The armor-piercing round, weighing , had a muzzle velocity of and a maximum penetration of of rolled homogeneous armour (RHA) at 90° at a range of . The rate of fire was 2-3 rounds/min. The ISU-152 carried 21 rounds of two piece (shell and charge) armor-piercing and high explosive ammunition. Later ISU-152 versions had a newer gun with a slightly longer barrel, up to over 4.9 metres (32.3 calibers), with a maximum range of fire of up to .

The ISU-152 had different versions, with changes in the gun (later versions), the number of hatches, or the hull (based on the hull of the IS-1, IS-2 or IS-2 model 1944 tanks). The IS-2 based versions had a thicker gun shield and larger fuel tank. Until May 1944, the main armament was the 152.4 mm ML-20 model 1937 gun-howitzer. The ISU-152 had a rate of fire of 2-3 rounds/min. The early versions had three hatches in the superstructure roof and one emergency hatch at the bottom of the hull behind the driver&#x27;s seat, which had an armored cover. Later versions had a fourth, round hatch in the superstructure roof on the right, next to the rectangular hatch on the left.

===ISU-152-2===
ISU-152BM (ИСУ-152БМ), sometimes referred to as ISU-152BM-1 or ISU-152-1, with the factory designation Object 246 (Объект 246), was a single prototype developed in April 1944 in Factory No. 100 in attempt to increase the firepower of the ISU-152. The &quot;BM&quot; (&quot;БМ&quot;) in the designation stands for &quot;High-Powered&quot; (&quot;Большой Мощности&quot;). The main purpose of the ISU-152BM was to fight against heavily armored tank destroyers such as the Elefant and the Jagdtiger. It was armed with the 152.4 mm BL-8 (БЛ-8) long-barreled gun, which unlike the ISU-152&#x27;s gun was not a gun-howitzer. The gun had a maximum range of , with the high-explosive shell which had a muzzle velocity of . The overall length of the gun was over , with a barrel length of (50 calibers). The armor-piercing round, weighing , had a muzzle velocity of . During test firing at armour plates with different thicknesses, the ISU-152BM successfully penetrated a maximum of of RHA at 90° at ranges of up to . However, during trials in July 1944, the gun showed some deficiencies, such as being difficult for the crew to operate, unreliability of the muzzle brake and the breech block, and unsatisfactory performance of the shells. In addition, the gun, protruding far forward of the hull front, limited the maneuverability of the vehicle. The self-propelled gun carried 21 rounds of two-piece (shell and charge) ammunition, and had a rate of fire of 2 rounds per minute. It used the engine, transmission, running gear, and electric equipment of the ISU-122. In August 1944 the BL-8 gun was replaced with the improved 152.4 mm BL-10 (БЛ-10) long-barreled gun, with a slightly shorter barrel of (48.5 calibers). This vehicle gun was designated ISU-152-2 (ИСУ-152-2). The factory designation was Object 247 (Объект 247). It was also equipped with external fuel tanks. The gun had a modified muzzle brake and a semi-automatic breech block. It had a rate of fire of 3 rounds/min. The BL-10 had a maximum range of , with the high-explosive shell. In December 1944 the ISU-152-2 underwent trials, revealing the barrel strength and the angle of horizontal guidance were unsatisfactory. The gun was sent for further improvement, but it was not completed before the war ended. The vehicle was never adopted. After the war, the final and most improved, third modification of ISU-152-2 was completed. The gun had a maximum range of , using a high-explosive shell with a muzzle velocity of .

===Object 704===

Object 704 (Объект 704) was the factory designation for a prototype self propelled gun developed in 1945. Also known as the Kirovets-2, it was developed on the chassis of the Kirovets-1, the initial prototype of the project that became the IS-3. The overall height of the vehicle was reduced to , which was compensated with an increased width of the superstructure. It was armed with the 152.4 mm ML-20SM model 1944 (МЛ-20СМ обр. 1944 г.) gun-howitzer, with a barrel length of over (29.6 calibers) and no muzzle brake. It had a maximum range of . The self-propelled gun carried 20 rounds of two-piece (shell and charge) armour-piercing and high-explosive ammunition. The armour-piercing round, weighing , had a muzzle velocity of . The rate of fire was 1-2 round/min. Object 704 had four hatches at the superstructure roof and one emergency hatch at the bottom of the hull behind the driver&#x27;s seat, which had an armoured cover. The self-propelled gun carried two external fuel tanks, not connected to the supply system. The secondary armament of the fighting vehicle consisted of two 12.7×108 mm DShK machine guns, one anti-aircraft and one co-axial. The protection was increased by placing thicker armour at more radical angles. In the area of the gun, where the mantlet combined with the hull front behind it and the housing of the recoil mechanism, the armour thickness was . Object 704 was the best protected of all experimental or production Soviet self-propelled guns of the Second World War. However, the radical incline of the superstructure walls combined with the increased recoil of the gun, due to the lack of a muzzle brake, significantly complicated the work of the crew, and for this reason it was not adopted.

===ISU-152K===

Object 241K (Объект 241К) was the factory designation for a modernised variant of the wartime ISU-152, developed in 1956. It used a new engine, that of the T-54, with a cooling system and a heater. The capacity of the main internal fuel tank was increased to , which added more to the vehicle&#x27;s range on a road. The ammunition capacity was increased to 30 rounds after the removal of an additional internal fuel tank placed in the crew compartment. The gun had a maximum range of . It received a new commander&#x27;s cupola, and also new sights. The running gear used many elements of the T-10. The mantlet had additional armor ring protecting the sight. Some of the ISU-152Ks received an additional 15 mm armour plate welded on top of the 60 mm armour plate covering the mantlet above. Also, some of them received an additional armour plate welded on the upper mantlet front. The modernisation was carried out in the Leningrad Kirov Plant.

===ISU-152M===
ISU-152M was the final variant of ISU-152, developed in 1959. The work was now transferred to the Chelyabinsk Kirovsk Plant. This modernisation was parallel to the IS-2M program and the ISU-152M used many elements of the tank. The factory designation was Object 241M (Объект 241М). The innovations included night vision sights, increased ammunition stowage for the 12.7 mm machine gun, which was replaced by the improved DShKM, and internal automotive improvements. It had the same new commander&#x27;s cupola and sights as the ISU-152K. It also had the same main internal fuel tank capacity, , adding more to the vehicle&#x27;s range on a road compared to the ISU-152, and an increased ammunition capacity to 30 rounds due to the removal of an internal fuel tank. The gun had a maximum range of . The ring protecting the sight was present, and the armour of the upper mantlet front was further increased with a thicker additional armour plate. The ISU-152M had the same V-54K engine with a heater, but lacked the cooling system.

==Use==
The ISU-152 self-propelled gun combined three battle roles: heavy assault gun, heavy tank destroyer and heavy self-propelled artillery. The 152.4 mm gun used a number of powerful (shell and charge) ammunition. Some of these ammunition had a 43.56 kg high-explosive shell, or a 48.78 kg armour-piercing shell, or the heaviest of all, the 53-G-545 (53-Г-545) long-range concrete-piercing ammunition with a 56 kg shell. The ISU-152 was used for infantry and tank support in attacking fortified enemy positions in a direct-fire role, for artillery support on the battlefield in an indirect-fire role and for engagement against armored vehicles in a direct-fire role.

===Heavy assault gun===
As a heavy assault gun, the ISU-152 was an extremely valuable weapon in urban combat operations such as the Battle of Berlin, Budapest and Königsberg. The vehicle&#x27;s excellent armour protection finally provided the 152.4 mm gun with good protection from most German anti-tank guns, allowing it to advance into the face of direct anti-tank fire, while the huge, low velocity, high-explosive rounds were excellent at blasting open even the most heavily fortified and reinforced enemy strongpoints. Such actions would be much more dangerous and much less effective for a conventional towed artillery piece, with their high crew exposure and low mobility, or even a tank, with their smaller main guns. When supporting tanks, the usual tactics of the ISU-152 were to be used in the second line of the attack order, behind the attacking tanks, which were usually IS tanks with equal mobility.

The ISU-152, like the earlier SU-152 and contemporary ISU-122, was employed by Independent Heavy Self-propelled Artillery Regiments. Between May 1943 and 1945, 53 of these regiments were formed. Many of them were re-formed tank regiments, and employed similar direct fire tactics as used by tanks when supporting infantry. Each of the heavy regiment had 21 guns, divided into four artillery batteries of five vehicles and the commander&#x27;s vehicle. For support, these heavy regiments had some supplementary unarmoured vehicles such as trucks, jeeps, or motorcycles. In December 1944, Guards Heavy Self-propelled Artillery Brigades were formed, to provide heavy fire support to the tank armies. They were organized along the model of tank brigades, each with 65 ISU-152 or ISU-122 self-propelled guns.

To minimize the risks of being knocked out by &quot;Panzerfaust&quot;-equipped units during urban operations, the ISU-152 usually acted in one- or two-vehicle detachments alongside infantry squads for protection. The infantry squad would include a specialist sniper (or at least a sharpshooter), some submachine gunners and sometimes a flamethrower. The ISU-152&#x27;s heavy-calibre DShK machine gun was also useful for targeting Panzerfaust gunners hiding on upper floors of city buildings or behind protective cover and defensive barricades. Effective teamwork between the ISU-152 crew and supporting infantry allowed them to achieve their goals with minimal losses, but if such tactics were not adhered to, the attacking vehicles were easily attacked and destroyed, usually through the weaker armor on the roof or rear compartment.

===Heavy tank destroyer===

The ISU-152 could also operate as an effective heavy tank destroyer. Though it was not designed for the role, the vehicle inherited the nickname &quot;Zveroboy&quot; (&quot;beast killer&quot;) from its predecessor, the SU-152, for its ability to reliably kill the best protected German fighting vehicles; the Panther tank, the Tiger I and Tiger II tanks, and even the rare Elefant and Jagdtiger tank destroyers. The sheer weight of the 152.4 mm shells resulted in an extremely low rate of fire, only two to three rounds per minute, and were not as accurate at long range as high-velocity tank and anti-tank guns. However, the massive blast effect from the heavy high-explosive warhead was capable of blowing the turret completely off a Tiger tank. A direct hit usually destroyed or damaged the target&#x27;s tracks and suspension, immobilizing it. While the low-velocity 152mm high-explosive shell did not generally penetrate heavy armor, it frequently killed or severely wounded the crew through spalling (splintering) inside the hull as well as injuries caused by blast concussion. Due to the brittle nature of German tank steel during the latter stages of the war, it was common for impacted armor plates to shatter from the concussive blast, or for weld lines to break, allowing the entire armor piece to fall away. Surviving crew were often left with an immobilized vehicle which had to be hurriedly abandoned before being destroyed.

For anti-tank operations following the July 1943 Battle of Kursk, armour-piercing ammunition was developed, with an eye towards giving the howitzer a more traditional anti-tank capability. However, these rounds were expensive, in short supply, and only moderately more effective than the standard non-penetrating high-explosive round. As a howitzer the ML-20S exchanged velocity and accuracy for throw weight and distance, and was not intended to compete with true anti-tank guns. Sometimes the concrete-piercing ammunition was used for the anti-tank role. A primitive shaped charge ammunition, with a shell, was also developed. It had a maximum penetration of 250 mm of RHA at 90°, but it was not used during the war.

The ISU-152&#x27;s 90 mm of sloped frontal armor, in contrast to the SU-152&#x27;s 65 mm, provided excellent frontal protection from the 75mm KwK 40 gun of the ubiquitous Panzer IV and StuG family at all but the closest ranges, while also forcing the original Tiger I, with its vaunted 88 mm KwK 36 gun, to close to medium ranges in order to successfully penetrate the vehicle, negating its traditional long-range superiority and putting it within effective range of the Soviet T-34-85 medium tanks.

The ISU-152 was not a true purpose-built tank destroyer. It had a very low rate of fire compared with specialised tank destroyers such as the German Jagdpanther or the Soviet SU-100, which could manage a brief burst of five to eight rounds per minute. However, prior to the introduction of the SU-100 it was the only Soviet armored vehicle capable of tackling the German heavy tanks with any kind of reliability, and its ability to satisfy multiple roles meant it was produced in far greater numbers than the SU-100. Attention to camouflage, quick relocation between firing positions, and massed ambushes of four or five vehicles firing in salvo at a single target&#x27;s flanks reduced the disadvantage of the low rate of fire.

===Self-propelled artillery===
The ISU-152 was also sometimes used as self-propelled artillery for support on the battlefield and preparatory bombardments, though it had a medium range of fire and a slow speed of reloading. The Soviet army had not developed specialized vehicles for this purpose. Their tank and mechanized units were well equipped with towed artillery, but the towed guns were very vulnerable while moving and they could not support tanks and motorized infantry during rapid advances into enemy positions, especially when they lacked the armored fully enclosed design of vehicles like ISU-152.

The internal stowage was limited to only 20 or 21 rounds of ammunition, with extra rounds often stowed on the rear deck. Replenishing the vehicle&#x27;s ammunition supply took over 40 minutes and required a very strong loader, due to the large size and weight of the shells - over . The ST-10 telescopic sight used for direct fire was graduated up to . A second, panoramic, sight was used for direct fire up to range no direct fire. However, it was problematic for the gunner to switch between the two. To compensate it was simpler to concentrate the fire of several vehicles onto the target, sacrificing accuracy for volume of firepower. The high-explosive shells were large enough to take out even a heavily armoured vehicle, or a fortification with the even heavier long-range concrete-piercing shells. The usual complement of ammunition was 13 high-explosive and 7 armour-piercing or concrete-piercing.

The armor penetration can vary between ammunition batches and different rolled homogeneous armour.

==Foreign military service==
===Finland===
In June 1944, during the Continuation War, a captured ISU-152 was used by the Finnish military. It was abandoned during the counter-attack at Kärstilänjärvi after receiving numerous shots from Soviet T-34-85 medium tanks. This was a direct result of the Finnish crew&#x27;s lack of experience and training with the ISU-152. Another captured one was repaired in Varkaus, Finland, but never saw combat.

=== Poland===
In 1944, more than 30 ISU-152s were delivered to the People&#x27;s Army of Poland. Shortly afterwards, the Polish military created the 25th Polish Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment, which consisted of 10 ISU-152s and 22 ISU-122s. As part of the 1st Polish Tank Corps (which operated both T-34-76 and T-34-85 tanks), the regiment took part in combat action along the River Nysa, located in southwestern Poland in March 1945. In the early months of 1945, the Polish command began to form another ISU-152 regiment, but with too few vehicles, the newly-formed 13th Polish self-propelled artillery regiment received two ISU-152s and two batteries comprising SU-85s. This regiment took part in the Battle of Berlin between April and May 1945.

Post-WWII, ISU-152s remained in service with the Polish military until the early 1960s.

===Czechoslovakia===
As part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s military assistance to friendly or pro-Soviet countries around the world, a few ISU-152s were transferred to the Czechoslovakian military after World War II, which operated them until the end of 1950s. For several decades it was the heaviest armoured vehicle in the Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Army, which used these to test newly developed anti-tank obstacles.

=== Romania===
One captured during World War II. The Romanian Army had received 20 ISU-152s during the 1950s; these were assigned to the artillery units of the 6th, 7th and 57th tank divisions of the Romanian Army. They were known as T-152 in Romanian service.

===Yugoslavia===
The Yugoslav Army had only one ISU-152 in its inventory. This sole vehicle was abandoned by units of the Soviet Red Army&#x27;s 2nd Ukrainian Front in 1944. In 1946, members of the Yugoslav 2nd Tank Brigade&#x27;s first battalion, led by technical officer Stojimir Ilijevic – Guerrilla, recovered the self-propelled gun after five days of work. As a unique vehicle it was used by the Army&#x27;s Tank School at Bela Crkva. After it was withdrawn from service, this single Yugoslav ISU-152 ended up as a practice target at the Manjača firing range.

===China===
In 1955, the Soviet Army moved out from Dalian in northeastern China, officially ending 10 years of military occupation. All weapons and armaments left behind by the Soviet Union were sold to the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army, including 67 ISU-152s; 45 were given to the newly created 1st Mechanized Division of the PLA.

===Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea===
During and after the Korean War, ISU-152s were operated by the Korean People&#x27;s Army of the DPRK. North Korea reportedly still uses ISU-152s in both active and reserve units, however, the actual number is unknown.

=== Egypt===

In the early 1960s the Egyptian military received at least one regiment of ISU-152s. They were used during the Arab-Israeli conflicts between 1967 and 1973. They proved mostly ineffective and several were captured by the Israeli Defence Forces; one is now on display in Yad la-Shiryon.

===Iraq===

A few surviving examples were operational during the Iran–Iraq War and First Gulf War.

<text>Rouyn-Noranda (; 2021 population 42,313) is a city on Osisko Lake in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region of Quebec, Canada.

The city of Rouyn-Noranda is a coextensive with a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) and census division (CD) of Quebec of the same name. Their geographical code is 86.

==History==
The city of Rouyn (named for Jean-Baptiste Rouyn, a captain in the Régiment Royal Roussillon of Louis-Joseph de Montcalm) appeared after copper was discovered in 1917. Noranda (a contraction of &quot;North Canada&quot;) was created later around the Horne mine and foundry. Both were officially constituted as cities in 1926, then merged in 1986.

Since 1966, Rouyn and Noranda constitute the capital of the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region. It is also the seat of (UQAT) since 1983.

The population tends to increase or decrease dramatically depending on the economic situation. The city&#x27;s population dropped by 5 per cent between the 1996 and 2001 census, before increasing slightly by 0.8 per cent for the 2006 census. This more closely parallels the demographic patterns of Northern Ontario than those of Quebec during this period. Rouyn-Noranda also has other cultural affiliations with Northern Ontario, being the only municipality in Quebec that holds a membership in the Francophone Association of Municipalities of Ontario.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rouyn-Noranda was established on February 9, 1974, by Pope Paul VI, with Mgr. Jean-Guy Hamelin as its first bishop. It is part of the Metropolitan Province of Gatineau. Mgr. Dorylas Moreau was appointed as bishop on November 30, 2001, replacing Mgr. Hamelin. On September 15, 2003, a decree moved the cathedral from Saint-Michel-Archange Church to Saint-Joseph Church.

==Geography==

As part of the 2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec, on January 1, 2002, the municipalities (including unorganized territories) of the former Rouyn-Noranda Regional County Municipality amalgamated into the new City of Rouyn-Noranda. These were: 
Arntfield, Bellecombe, Beaudry, Cadillac, Cléricy, Cloutier, D&#x27;Alembert, Destor, Évain, Lac-Montanier, Lac-Surimau, McWatters, Mont-Brun, Montbeillard, Rapides-des-Cèdres, Rollet, and the former Rouyn-Noranda.

Rouyn-Noranda is known as &quot;La Capitale Nationale du Cuivre&quot; (or the National Copper Capital) for its extensive copper deposits and mining/smelting activities.

==Attractions==
St. George Russian Orthodox Church of Rouyn is a Russian Orthodox Church, with traditional architecture. It was erected between 1955 and 1957 by the Russian community, at the time about twenty families. A guided tour explains the celebration of Mass and the history of immigrant communities and their role in local history. This distinctive church paints a vivid picture of the lives of the people who suffered through the First and Second World Wars and finally came to live in Canada.

==Sports==
The Rouyn-Noranda Huskies have played in the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League since the Saint-Hyacinthe Laser relocated to the town in 1996. Rouyn-Noranda has produced a large number of NHLers for its size including former NHL stars Pierre Turgeon, Stephane Matteau, Sylvain Turgeon, Dale Tallon, Pit Martin, Jacques Laperrière, Jacques Cloutier, Dave Keon and Kent Douglas, the last two both members of the 1967 Stanley Cup Champion Toronto Maple Leafs. Former NHL players Réjean Houle, Éric Desjardins and the Bordeleau Brothers (Christian, Jean Paul and Paulin) also hail from the city. Rouyn-Noranda native Marc-André Cliche played in his first NHL game in 2010. Their most fierce rivals are the Val-d&#x27;Or Foreurs, which constitute the &quot;Battle of the 117&quot; since both cities are connected by Route 117.

==Government==
Federally, Rouyn-Noranda is part of the Abitibi—Témiscamingue riding. The MP is Sébastien Lemire of the Bloc Québécois.

The primary highways through the city are the north–south Route 101 and the east–west Route 117, which is part of the Trans-Canada Highway system.

==Media==
Almost all media in Rouyn-Noranda and the nearby city of Val-d&#x27;Or serves both cities. Although the cities are far enough apart that radio and television stations in the area serve the cities from separate transmitters, almost every broadcast station in either city has a rebroadcaster in the other city. The only nominal exceptions are the cities&#x27; separate Énergie stations, although at present even these stations share the majority of their broadcast schedule.

<doc id="329524" wikidata="Q466831" url="?curid=329524" title="Eugenie Scott">
<text>Eugenie Carol Scott (born October 24, 1945) is an American physical anthropologist who has been active in opposing the teaching of young Earth creationism and intelligent design in schools. She coined the term &quot;Gish gallop&quot; to describe a fallacious rhetorical technique of overwhelming an interlocutor with as many individually weak arguments as possible, in order to prevent rebuttal of the whole argument.

From 1986 to 2014, Scott served as the Executive Director of the National Center for Science Education, a nonprofit science education organization supporting teaching of evolutionary science. Since 2013, Scott has been listed on their advisory council.

Scott serves on the Board of Trustees of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. Scott is a member of the Board of Advisers for the publication, &quot;Scientific American&quot;. She is also a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) and GWUP.

==Early life and education==

Scott grew up in Wisconsin and first became interested in anthropology after reading her sister&#x27;s anthropology textbook.
Scott received BS and MS degrees from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, followed by a PhD from the University of Missouri. She joined the University of Kentucky as a physical anthropologist in 1974, and shortly thereafter attended a debate between her mentor James A. Gavan and the young Earth creationist Duane Gish, which piqued her interest in the creation–evolution controversy. She also taught at the University of Colorado and at California State University, Hayward. Her research work focused on medical anthropology, and skeletal biology.

==Career==

In 1980, Scott worked to prevent creationism from being taught in the public schools of Lexington, Kentucky. Scott was appointed the executive director of the National Center for Science Education in 1987, the year in which requiring the teaching of creation science in American public schools was deemed illegal by the Supreme Court in &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot;. Scott announced that she would be retiring from this position by the end of 2013, doing so on 6 January 2014. Her place was taken by Ann Reid.

=== Worldview ===

Scott was brought up in Christian Science by her mother and grandmother but later switched to a congregational church under the influence of her sister; she describes her background as liberal Protestant. Scott is now a secular humanist and describes herself as a nontheist. In 2003, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that, &quot;Scott describes herself as atheist but does not discount the importance of spirituality.&quot; In 2003 she was one of the signatories to the third humanist manifesto, &quot;Humanism and Its Aspirations&quot;.

=== Authorship ===

Scott is an expert on creationism and intelligent design. Her book &quot;Evolution vs. Creationism: An Introduction&quot; was published by Greenwood Press in 2004 and then in paperback by the University of California Press in 2005. Niles Eldredge wrote the foreword in the first edition. A second edition of the book was published in 2008 and in paperback in 2009. The foreword to this edition was written by John E. Jones III, who was the presiding judge in the Kitzmiller v. Dover court case.

She co-edited with Glenn Branch the 2006 anthology &quot;Not in Our Classrooms: Why Intelligent Design is Wrong for Our Schools&quot;.

In 2006 Jon D. Miller, Scott and Shinji Okamoto had a brief article published in &quot;Science&quot; entitled &quot;Public Acceptance of Evolution&quot;, an analysis of polling on the acceptance of evolution from the last 20 years in the United States and compared to other countries. Turkey had the lowest acceptance of evolution in the survey, with the United States having the next-lowest, though the authors saw a positive in the higher percentage of Americans who are unsure about evolution, and therefore &quot;reachable&quot; for evolution.

===Academic recognition===

As of 2023 Scott has been the recipient of 10 honorary degrees.

=== Media appearances ===
David Berlinski, a fellow at the Discovery Institute, describes Scott as an opponent &quot;who is often sent out to defend Darwin&quot;. Scott prefers to see herself as &quot;Darwin&#x27;s golden retriever&quot;.

Scott has been profiled in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Scientific American&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot;, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, and the &quot;Stanford Medical Magazine&quot;. She has been interviewed for Science &amp; Theology News, CSICOP, Church &amp; State, and Point of Inquiry. Her commentary has been published by &quot;Science &amp; Theology News&quot;, and Metanexus Institute.

Scott has taken part in numerous debates on MSNBC and Fox News.

In 2004, Scott represented the National Center for Science Education on the Showtime television show &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot;, on the episode titled &quot;Creationism&quot;, where she offered philosophical views about the creationist and intelligent design movements.

=== &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; ===

In 2005, Scott and other NCSE staff served as scientific and educational consultants for the plaintiffs in the &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; case regarding the teaching of intelligent design in public schools. Judge John Jones ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. Scott said that &quot;we won decisively&quot; and &quot;in triplicate&quot;, and &quot;we had the better case.&quot; About the merits of the case, she said, &quot;Within evolutionary biology, we argue about the details... and the mechanisms,&quot; but &quot;we don&#x27;t argue about whether living things descended with modification from common ancestors, which is what biological evolution is all about... The Dover School Board wanted students to doubt whether evolution had taken place.&quot;

=== Awards ===


==Personal life==

Scott and her husband, lawyer Thomas C. Sager, have one daughter and reside in Berkeley, California.

Scott is a backyard beekeeper with two beehives, and is interested in colony collapse disorder and an advocate of amateur beekeeping.

Hisham III, the brother of Abd ar-Rahman IV, was chosen as Caliph after long negotiations between the governors of the border regions and the people of Córdoba. He could not enter Córdoba until 1029 as the city was occupied by the Berber armies of the Hammudids.

Although he tried to consolidate the Caliphate, the raising of taxes (to pay for mosques amongst other things) led to heavy opposition from the Muslim clerics. After the murder of his Vizier al-Hakam by a conspiracy of Cordoban Patricians, Hisham was imprisoned. He managed to escape, but died in exile in 1036 in Balaguer.

After the Caliphate fell with the overthrow of Hisham III in 1031, the Caliphate&#x27;s land holdings—already much diminished from its height in power just 100 years past—devolved into a number of militarily weak but culturally advanced taifas.

<text>Harvard Medical School (HMS) is the medical school of Harvard University and is located in the Longwood Medical Area in Boston, Massachusetts. Founded in 1782, HMS is the third oldest medical school in the United States. It provides patient care, medical education, and research training through its 15 clinical affiliates and research institutes, including Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Mount Auburn Hospital, McLean Hospital, Cambridge Health Alliance, The Baker Center for Children and Families, Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, and others 

Harvard Medical School also partners with newer entities such as Harvard Catalyst, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, the Center for Primary Care, and Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering.

== History ==

Harvard Medical School was founded on September 19, 1782, on the initiative of Harvard President Joseph Willard. The founding faculty were John Warren, Aaron Dexter, and Benjamin Waterhouse. It is the third-oldest medical school in the United States, after the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.

Lectures were first held in the basement of Harvard Hall, then in Holden Chapel. Students paid no tuition but purchased tickets to five or six daily lectures. The first two students graduated in 1788.

In the following century, the school moved locations several times due to changing clinical relationships, a function of the fact that Harvard Medical School does not directly own or operate a teaching hospital. In 1810, the school moved to Boston at what is now downtown Washington Street. In 1816, the school was moved to Mason Street and was called the Massachusetts Medical College of Harvard University in recognition of a gift from the Great and General Court of Massachusetts. In 1847, the school was moved to Grove Street to be closer to Massachusetts General Hospital. In 1883, the school was relocated to Copley Square. Before this move, Charles William Eliot became Harvard&#x27;s president in 1869, and found the medical school in the worst condition of any part of the university. He instituted drastic reforms that raised admissions standards, instituted a formal degree program, and defined HMS as a professional school within Harvard University that laid the groundwork for its transformation into one of the leading medical schools in the world.

In 1906, the school moved to its present location in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area.

=== Innovations ===
Harvard Medical School postdoctoral trainees and faculty have been associated with several important medical and public health innovations:

=== Broadening admissions ===
==== Women ====

In mid-1847, professor Walter Channing&#x27;s proposal that women be admitted to lectures and examinations was rejected by the President and Fellows of Harvard College. That year Harriot Hunt became the first woman to apply to Harvard Medical School. Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. had recently been made Dean of the school and initially considered accepting her application. He was heavily criticized by the all-male student body as well as the university overseers and other faculty members, and she was asked to withdraw her application. Shortly after Elizabeth Blackwell&#x27;s graduation from Geneva College in 1849, Hunt applied to Harvard again, but was denied. 

In 1866, two women with extensive medical education elsewhere applied but were denied admission. In 1867, a single faculty member&#x27;s vote blocked the admission of Susan Dimock.
In 1872, Harvard declined a gift of $10,000 conditioned on the medical school admitting women medical students on the same terms as men.
A similar offer of $50,000, by a group of ten women including Marie Elizabeth Zakrzewska, was declined in 1882; a committee of five was appointed to study the matter.
After the medical school moved from North Grove Street to Boylston Street in 1883, professor Henry Ingersoll Bowditch&#x27;s proposal that the North Grove Street premises be used for medical education for women was rejected.

In 1943, a dean&#x27;s committee recommended the admission of women, the proportion of men and women being dependent solely on the qualifications of the applicants. 
In 1945, the first class of women was admitted; projected benefits included helping male students learn to view women as equals, increasing the number of physicians in lower-paid specialties typically shunned by men, and replacing the weakest third of all-male classes with better-qualified women. By 1972, about one-fifth of Harvard medical students were women.

==== African Americans ====
In 1850, three black men, Martin Delany, Daniel Laing Jr., and Isaac H. Snowden, were admitted to the school but were later expelled under pressure from faculty and other students.

In 1968, in response to a petition signed by hundreds of medical students, the faculty established a commission on relations with the black community in Boston; at the time less than one percent of Harvard medical students were black. By 1973, the number of black students admitted had tripled, and by the next year, it had quadrupled. In 2011, HMS appointed its first African American full professor of medicine, Valerie E. Stone. That year they also appointed their first African-American professor of radiology, Stone&#x27;s former classmate Tina Young Poussaint.

In 2019, LaShyra Nolen was the first black woman to be elected class president of Harvard Medical School.

===2018—2022 Anatomical Gifts morgue scandal===
On June 14, 2023, the morgue manager for the Anatomical Gifts Program at Harvard Medical School, Cedric Lodge, and associates were criminally charged with theft of human organs by the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Twelve lawsuits were subsequently filed against the school by families of Lodge&#x27;s victims. On January 17, 2024, a lawyer representing Harvard urged Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Salinger to dismiss the lawsuits.

== Medical education ==
=== Curriculum ===
Harvard Medical School has gone through many curricular revisions for its MD program. In recent decades, HMS has maintained a three-phase curriculum with a classroom-based pre-clerkship phase, a principal clinical experience (PCE), and a post-PCE phase.

The pre-clerkship phase has two curricular tracks. The majority of students enter the more traditional Pathways track that focuses on active learning and earlier entry into the clinic with courses that include students from the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Pathways students gain early exposure to the clinic through a longitudinal clinical skills course that lasts the duration of the pre-clerkship phase. A small portion of each class enters the HST track, which is jointly administered with MIT. The HST track is designed to train physician-scientists with an emphasis on basic physiology and quantitative understanding of biological processes through courses that include Ph.D. students from MIT.

=== Admissions ===
Admission to Harvard Medical School&#x27;s MD program is highly selective. There are 165 total spots for each incoming class, with 135 spots in the Pathways curriculum and 30 spots in the HST program. While both use a single application, each curricular track independently evaluates applicants.

For the MD Class of 2023, 6,815 candidates applied, and 227 were admitted (3.3%). There was a matriculation rate of 73%. For the Master of Medical Sciences (MMSc) program in Global Health Delivery, the Fall 2020 admissions rate was 8.2%.

===Rankings===
For 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; did not rank Harvard Medical School due to its official withdrawal from the USNWR. For 2023, Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research reported that Harvard Medical School is No. 43 in Research.

== Graduate education ==

=== PhD degree programs ===
There are nine PhD programs based in Harvard Medical School. Students in these programs are enrolled in the Division of Medical Sciences in Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) and are part of the HILS (Harvard Integrated Life Sciences) inter-program federation.

=== Master&#x27;s degree programs ===
Harvard Medical School offers two types of master&#x27;s degrees, Master of Medical Sciences (MMSc) degrees and Master of Science (MS) degrees.

=== Postgraduate certificate programs ===
Harvard Medical School offers several Postgraduate Certificate programs. These graduate-level programs may run up to twelve months. Admitted participants are awarded a Certificate from Harvard Medical School upon successful completion, and are eligible for associate membership in the Harvard Alumni Association.

== Affiliated teaching hospitals and research institutes ==
Harvard Medical School does not directly own or operate any hospitals and instead relies on affiliated teaching hospitals for clinical education. Medical students primarily complete their clinical experiences at the following hospitals. Clinical faculty at Harvard Medical School generally hold a concurrent appointment as a physician or a surgeon at one of the affiliated hospitals. Basic science faculty at Harvard Medical School may hold the primary appointment at the School itself or one of the affiliated hospitals. 

== Notable alumni ==

As of 2020, there are over 10,425 alumni. It has trained more Nobel Prize winners in Medicine and Physiology than any other medical school.

<doc id="329533" wikidata="Q725798" url="?curid=329533" title="Epperson v. Arkansas">
<text>Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (1968), was a unanimous landmark United States Supreme Court case that invalidated an Arkansas statute prohibiting the teaching of human evolution in the public schools. The Court held that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits a state from requiring, in the words of the majority opinion, &quot;that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma.&quot; The Supreme Court declared the Arkansas statute unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. After this decision, some jurisdictions passed laws that required the teaching of creation science alongside evolution when evolution was taught. The Court also ruled these laws were unconstitutional in the 1987 case, &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot;.

== Background ==
&quot;Epperson&quot; focused on the constitutionality of a 1928 Arkansas statute prohibiting the teaching of human evolutionary theory in its public schools and universities. The statute was enacted during a period of Christian Fundamentalist religious fervor in the 1920s. The Arkansas statute was modeled after Tennessee&#x27;s 1925 &quot;Butler Act&quot;, the subject of the well known Scopes Trial in 1925. The Tennessee Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Tennessee law in 1927, allowing the state to continue to prohibit the teaching of evolution.

The Arkansas law was passed through the initiative process, the first anti-evolution law in the United States passed through general election, and teachers who violated it were made subject to fine and dismissal by the state. The law made it unlawful for any teacher or other instructor in any university, college, public school or other institution of the state which is supported in whole or in part from public funds derived by state or local taxation to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals, and also that it be unlawful for any teacher, textbook commission, or other authority exercising the power to select textbooks for above-mentioned institutions to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches the doctrine or theory that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animal.

Thirty years later, Cold War concerns over Soviet success with the 1957 Sputnik launch led to the 1958 National Defense Education Act and Biological Sciences Curriculum Study setting textbook standards which included evolution.
&quot;Epperson v. Arkansas&quot; involved the teaching of biology in a Little Rock high school. Based upon the recommendation of the school biology teachers, administrators adopted the 1965 textbook &quot;Modern Biology&quot; for the 1965–1966 school year, which contained a chapter discussing Charles Darwin and evolutionary theory, and prescribed the subject be taught to the students.

Susan Epperson was a teacher in the Little Rock school system, employed to teach 10th grade biology at the Little Rock Central High School. The adoption of the new textbook and curriculum standard put her in a legal dilemma because it remained a criminal offense to teach the material in her state, and to do as her school district instructed would also put her at risk of dismissal. Epperson was not opposed to the teaching, and with backing from the Arkansas chapter of the National Education Association and the American Civil Liberties Union, and the unequivocal support of the Little Rock Ministerial Association, filed suit to test the federal constitutionality of the Arkansas state law. She filed in the Chancery Court in Pulaski County seeking nullification of the law and an injunction against her being dismissed for teaching the evolutionary curriculum. She was joined in the suit by H. H. Blanchard, a parent with children in the school.

The trial began on April 1, 1966, and the court issued its decision on May 27, 1966. The Chancery Court held that the statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which protects citizens from state interference with freedom of speech and thought as contained in the First Amendment. The lower court decided the law was unconstitutional because it &quot;tends to hinder the quest for knowledge, restrict the freedom to learn, and restrain the freedom to teach.&quot;

The state appealed the decision to the Arkansas Supreme Court, which reversed the lower court ruling on June 5, 1967. The opinion read:

Upon the principal issue, that of constitutionality, the court holds that Initiated Measure No. 1 of 1928, Ark.Stat.Ann. § 81627 and § 81628 (Repl.1960), is a valid exercise of the state&#x27;s power to specify the curriculum in its public schools. The court expresses no opinion on the question whether the Act prohibits any explanation of the theory of evolution or merely prohibits teaching that the theory is true, the answer not being necessary to a decision in the case and the issue not having been raised.

This decision left the ban against teaching evolution in effect.

==U.S. Supreme Court Decision==
Epperson appealed the State Supreme Court&#x27;s reversal to the United States Supreme Court. Eugene R. Warren presented arguments for the appellant, Epperson, and Don Langston, an Assistant Attorney General for Arkansas, argued for the state of Arkansas. Both Langston and the State Appeal Court focused on the power given to states to set curriculum standards, and did not delve far into the subject of evolutionary theory itself nor to the boundaries between church and state.
The U.S. Supreme Court hearing commenced on October 16, 1968, and the Court announced its unanimous decision on November 12, 1968. It found the reasons given in the Arkansas reversal were in error. The Court went on to say that the clear purpose of the Arkansas statute against the teaching of evolution was to protect a particular religious view, and was thus unconstitutional. In a decision written by Justice Abe Fortas, the Court held that:

The overriding fact is that Arkansas’ law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine; that is, with a particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group.

The Court found that not only was the state prohibited from advancing or protecting a particular religious view, but that

[T]he state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them.

Justice Hugo Black issued a separate opinion to overturn the Arkansas law, finding the law unconstitutionally &quot;vague&quot; rather than an unconstitutional religious infringement. While agreeing with the majority to reverse the State Appeal Court decision, his opinion details his dissent from the majority over the First Amendment issue.

==Consequences==
Though William Jennings Bryan famously testified to some questions about Biblical creation in the 1925 &quot;Scopes v. State&quot; trial, that Court, like this one, was asked only to judge whether teachings about human evolution could be prohibited in the public schools. Bryan, who opposed the evolution instruction, never argued that the teaching of Biblical creation belonged in the school.

The precedent set in &quot;Epperson&quot;, in which the Court concluded the sole motive behind the ban against evolution teaching in Arkansas was to protect a particular religious view, effectively nullified all other related evolution education prohibitions throughout the United States. Within a short time of the &quot;Epperson&quot; decision, religious opponents of the teaching attempted through other means to lessen its influence in the curriculum, including requiring schools to teach biblical creation alongside evolution or forcing schools to provide disclaimers that evolution was &quot;only a theory&quot;. These attempts eventually resulted in precedent-setting court decisions including &quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot;, and ultimately &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot;, which struck down a Louisiana statute as unconstitutional.

<doc id="329534" wikidata="Q7171495" url="?curid=329534" title="Pesticide misuse">
<text>Under United States law, pesticide misuse is considered to be the use of a pesticide in a way that violates laws regulating their use or endangers humans or the environment; many of these regulations are laid out in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Pesticide misuse encompasses a range of practices, including overapplication, incorrect timing, and the use of banned substances. This global issue not only threatens environmental safety but also undermines efforts towards sustainability. The risk of pesticide pollution at a global scale necessitates a concerted effort to understand and mitigate misuse. The most common instances of pesticide misuse are applications inconsistent with the labeling, which can include the use of a material in any way not described on the label, changing dosage rates, or violating specific safety instructions. Pesticide labels have been criticized as a poor risk communication vehicle, leading some officials and researchers to question whether &quot;misuse&quot; is an appropriate term for what are often &quot;unintended uses&quot; resulting from a poor understanding of safety and application instructions. Other kinds of pesticide misuse include the sale or use of an unregistered pesticide or one whose registration has been revoked and the sale or use of an adulterated or misbranded pesticide. Under most jurisdictions, it is illegal to alter or remove pesticide labels, to sell restricted pesticides to an uncertified applicator, or to fail to maintain sales and use records of restricted pesticides. 

Pesticides are toxic compounds, and their labels are specifically designed to encourage safe and effective use. Ignoring the directions can lead to civil and criminal charges and civil liability for damages to other parties.

== Health effects ==
=== In humans ===
Pesticide misuse can lead to pesticide poisoning, the consequences of which range from mild skin irritations to seizure to death. The effects of poisoning vary drastically depending on dosage and levels of exposure. The types of pesticides most often present in poisonings are organophosphates and N-methyl carbamates, pyrethrin and synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, and organochloride insecticides. Certain fumigants, nematicides, herbicides, and dipyridyls are also common in cases of pesticide poisoning.

One of the best known cases of pesticide misuse in recent history involved the application of a pesticide intended for outdoor agricultural use (methyl parathion) to homes in Mississippi for cockroaches and other home pests. Two exterminators were charged with multiple criminal charges after their ongoing use (of several years) was exposed. A number of residents, including two infants, suffered symptoms of pesticide poisoning. A number of homes and business, including several day care centers and schools were rendered uninhabitable or unusable. Heavy fines and prison terms followed for the perpetrators.

===In other animals===

Pesticide misuse can also endanger wildlife and other environmental resources.

Birds
Birds are particularly susceptible to pesticide exposure. Certain pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates, interfere with the nervous systems of birds, leading to reduced reproductive success and increased mortality rates. The thinning of eggshells caused by DDT, a now-banned pesticide, is a well-documented example. This phenomenon led to a decline in the populations of several bird species, including the bald eagle and peregrine falcon.

Mammals
Mammals can also suffer from pesticide exposure. Rodents and other small mammals are at risk of ingesting pesticides directly or through contaminated food sources. This can result in acute poisoning or chronic health issues, such as reproductive and developmental problems. Predatory mammals, such as foxes and weasels, can be indirectly affected through bioaccumulation, where they consume prey that has been exposed to pesticides.

Insects
Beneficial insects, including pollinators like bees and butterflies, are highly vulnerable to pesticides. Neonicotinoids, a class of insecticides, have been linked to the decline of bee populations due to their neurotoxic effects. These pesticides impair foraging behavior, reduce reproductive success, and increase susceptibility to diseases and parasites. The decline in pollinator populations poses a significant threat to biodiversity and agriculture.

Aquatic Life
Aquatic animals are impacted by pesticide runoff from agricultural fields and urban areas. Fish and amphibians are particularly at risk as pesticides can contaminate water bodies, leading to lethal and sublethal effects. Pesticides can disrupt the endocrine systems of fish, affecting their growth, reproduction, and development. Amphibians, which have permeable skin, are highly sensitive to waterborne pesticides, leading to population declines and deformities.

Reptiles
Reptiles, such as snakes and lizards, can also be affected by pesticide exposure. These animals may encounter pesticides through direct contact with treated areas or by consuming contaminated prey. The impacts on reptiles can include decreased fertility, altered behavior, and increased mortality rates. 

Notable Instance of Pesticide misuse: A Florida man was recently cited and fined $23,100 for using the pesticide Aldicarb on deer carcasses to kill coyotes, for storing the pesticide in unlabeled containers, and not being a certified applicator.

Specific label directions are given on materials that are toxic to bees, because these pollinators are considered an important environmental resource. A typical bee-protection label direction reads: &quot;This product is highly toxic to bees exposed to direct treatment on blooming crops or weeds. Do not apply this product or allow it to drift to blooming crops or weeds if bees are visiting the treatment area.&quot; In 2013, over 25,000 bumblebees died as a result of pesticide misuse in Wilsonville, Oregon. A South Carolina farmer was also cited and fined for pesticide misuse, because he sprayed a blooming cucumber field while bees were foraging on the blossoms, causing a serious bee kill. Similar bee kills have impacted US beekeepers and the growers who need bees for pollination billions of dollars in losses. Efforts to curb pesticide misuse are critical, especially in agricultural countries where literacy barriers and lack of training contribute significantly to the problem. Programs like Integrated Pest Management (IPM) training have shown promise in reducing misuse and enhancing crop yields.

== Contributing factors ==
Pesticide misuse occurs most frequently in developing countries and in countries with predominantly agricultural economies. Several factors contribute to pesticide misuse, but ecological researchers have found language barriers and illiteracy to be among the most common. Safety data sheets for pesticides are available in a variety of languages, but the farmers and agricultural workers who are responsible for pesticide application are often unable to read them. Limited education and a lack of proper training tend to be among the most significant contributing factors to improper handling and application of pesticides. The majority of agricultural workers and rural farmers in developing countries have received only a few years of primary education, which contributes to the illiteracy of these populations. Farmers in underdeveloped countries also frequently misuse pesticides due to improper training; however, Integrated Pest Management training has been shown to reduce rates of improper handling and application of pesticides while simultaneously increasing crop yields.

<doc id="329536" wikidata="Q6555807" url="?curid=329536" title="Lionel Taylor">
<text>Lionel Thomas Taylor (born August 15, 1935) is an American former football player and coach. He played as a wide receiver primarily with the Denver Broncos of American Football League (AFL), he led the league in receptions for five of the first six years of the league&#x27;s existence. The second player to lead a league in receptions for at least five seasons, Taylor is currently the last to do so. He was the third wide receiver to reach 500 receptions in pro football history. He was also a longtime assistant coach in the league, winning two Super Bowls with the Pittsburgh Steelers. In 2024, he was given the Award of Excellence by the Pro Football Hall of Fame for his work as an assistant. However, despite all of his accomplishments as a player and coach, he has yet to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==College football==
Taylor attended New Mexico Highlands University, where he had starred in basketball and track, earning all-conference wide receiver honors in 1956 and 1957.

==Professional football==
Taylor first played eight games as a linebacker with the Chicago Bears of the National Football League before moving to the Denver Broncos of the AFL for the 1960 season. With the Broncos, he switched positions and became a receiver. Third in all-time receptions (543) and receiving yards (6,872) for the Denver Broncos, Taylor was the Broncos&#x27; team MVP in 1963, 1964 and 1965, and an AFL All-Star in 1961, 1962 and 1965. An original Bronco, Taylor was part of the team&#x27;s inaugural Ring of Fame class in 1984. Along with Lance Alworth, Charlie Hennigan and Sid Blanks, he shares the record for most receptions in one game with 13, doing so against the Oakland Raiders on November 29, 1964.

Taylor was the first professional football receiver ever to make 100 catches in a single season, accomplishing the feat in only 14 games (1961). He had four seasons with over 1,000 yards receiving, and averaged 84.7 catches per year from 1960 to 1965, then the highest six-year total in professional football history. , his 102.9 yards per game in 1960 remains a Broncos franchise record. Taylor completed his career with the Houston Oilers in 1967 and 1968.

In the time he played (1960–1968), the leading receiver in the AFL outmatched the leading receiver in the NFL each time except 1968. Taylor was the first receiver to have caught more than 90 passes in a single season, and he was also the first to do it twice. No receiver would lead the league in receptions over 90 in two separate seasons until Sterling Sharpe did so (1989, 1992, 1993). Taylor had a peak from 1960 to 1965 that resulted in 508 receptions for 6,424 yards and 43 touchdowns. In that same time, on the NFL side, Bobby Mitchell had 338 catches for 5,571 yards and 43 touchdowns. Curiously, Mitchell finished with more touchdowns and yards than Taylor but had less receptions and yards per game and managed to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, while Taylor has not.

After his playing career, Taylor went into a long career as a coach. He was an assistant coach for two Super Bowl championship teams of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 1970s and then the Los Angeles Rams.

In 2022, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Taylor to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2022.

<text>The Caddo River is a tributary of the Ouachita River in the U.S. state of Arkansas. The river is about long.

==Course==
The Caddo River flows out of the Ouachita Mountains through Montgomery, Pike, and Clark counties in Arkansas before flowing into DeGray Lake and then to its terminus at the Ouachita River north of Arkadelphia, Arkansas.

The upper Caddo is known as a good family canoeing river and is a popular destination for fishing. Smallmouth and spotted bass are found in quantity, as are longear and green sunfish. The lower course of the Caddo, below Degray Dam, is also a popular fishing and canoeing river, although the length of river remaining is only a few miles at that point.

Communities through which the Caddo River passes are:
*Black Springs, Arkansas
*Norman, Arkansas
*Caddo Gap, Arkansas
*Glenwood, Arkansas
*Amity, Arkansas
*Caddo Valley, Arkansas
*Arkadelphia, Arkansas

==Flood of 2010==
On the night of June 11, 2010, between 200 and 300 campers awoke to rapidly rising water, as a flash flood along the Caddo and Little Missouri Rivers killed twenty people.

==Etymology==
The Caddo River is named for the Caddo Native American tribes that, at one time, lived along its banks.

<doc id="329542" wikidata="Q238231" url="?curid=329542" title="Disk (mathematics)">
<text>In geometry, a disk (also spelled disc) is the region in a plane bounded by a circle. A disk is said to be &quot;closed&quot; if it contains the circle that constitutes its boundary, and &quot;open&quot; if it does not.

For a radius, formula_1, an open disk is usually denoted as formula_2 and a closed disk is formula_3. However in the field of topology the closed disk is usually denoted as formula_4 while the open disk is formula_5.

==Formulas==
In Cartesian coordinates, the &quot;open disk&quot; of center formula_6 and radius &quot;R&quot; is given by the formula:
:formula_7
while the &quot;closed disk&quot; of the same center and radius is given by: 
:formula_8

The area of a closed or open disk of radius &quot;R&quot; is π&quot;R&quot;2 (see area of a disk).

==Properties==
The disk has circular symmetry.

The open disk and the closed disk are not topologically equivalent (that is, they are not homeomorphic), as they have different topological properties from each other. For instance, every closed disk is compact whereas every open disk is not compact. However from the viewpoint of algebraic topology they share many properties: both of them are contractible and so are homotopy equivalent to a single point. This implies that their fundamental groups are trivial, and all homology groups are trivial except the 0th one, which is isomorphic to Z. The Euler characteristic of a point (and therefore also that of a closed or open disk) is 1.

Every continuous map from the closed disk to itself has at least one fixed point (we don&#x27;t require the map to be bijective or even surjective); this is the case &quot;n&quot;=2 of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. The statement is false for the open disk:

Consider for example the function
formula_9
which maps every point of the open unit disk to another point on the open unit disk to the right of the given one. But for the closed unit disk it fixes every point on the half circle formula_10

==As a statistical distribution==
A uniform distribution on a unit circular disk is occasionally encountered in statistics. It most commonly occurs in operations research in the mathematics of urban planning, where it may be used to model a population within a city. Other uses may take advantage of the fact that it is a distribution for which it is easy to compute the probability that a given set of linear inequalities will be satisfied. (Gaussian distributions in the plane require numerical quadrature.)

&quot;An ingenious argument via elementary functions&quot; shows the mean Euclidean distance between two points in the disk to be , while direct integration in polar coordinates shows the mean squared distance to be .

If we are given an arbitrary location at a distance from the center of the disk, it is also of interest to determine the average distance from points in the distribution to this location and the average square of such distances. The latter value can be computed directly as .

===Average distance to an arbitrary internal point===
To find we need to look separately at the cases in which the location is internal or external, i.e. in which , and we find that in both cases the result can only be expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals.

If we consider an internal location, our aim (looking at the diagram) is to compute the expected value of under a distribution whose density is for , integrating in polar coordinates centered on the fixed location for which the area of a cell is  ; hence
formula_11

Here can be found in terms of and using the Law of cosines. The steps needed to evaluate the integral, together with several references, will be found in the paper by Lew et al.; the result is that
formula_12
where and are complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds. ; .

===Average distance to an arbitrary external point===
Turning to an external location, we can set up the integral in a similar way, this time obtaining
formula_13
where the law of cosines tells us that and are the roots for of the equation
formula_14
Hence
formula_15
We may substitute to get 
formula_16
using standard integrals.

Hence again , while also
formula_17

<text>Spruce Grove is a city that is west of Edmonton, Alberta, in Canada. The city is adjacent to the Town of Stony Plain and is surrounded by Parkland County.

With a 2021 population of 37,645, Spruce Grove is the ninth-largest city in Alberta. The mayor of Spruce Grove is Jeff Acker.

Spruce Grove is home to the Horizon Stage Performing Arts Centre, a local theatre, and the TransAlta Tri Leisure Centre, a recreation facility shared with Stony Plain and Parkland County.

Jennifer Heil, the freestyle skier who won the first gold medal for Canada in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, and a silver medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics is from Spruce Grove, as is Carla MacLeod, a member of the 2010 Canada women&#x27;s national ice hockey team, and Hockey Hall of Fame member and Stanley Cup-winning goalie Grant Fuhr. Stephanie Labbé, goalkeeper for Canada&#x27;s 2020 Summer Olympic gold-medal winning women&#x27;s soccer team, grew up in the Spruce Grove and Stony Plain area and played soccer at Spruce Grove Composite High School.

== History ==
Centuries before European settlement, the Cree and Sarcee people occupied the land that would become Spruce Grove, moving with the seasons.

Homesteaders in the area date back to 1879. Originally the town comprised a general store, livery stables, blacksmith shop, hotel, and the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1908 the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway came through Spruce Grove and a train station was built. With the establishment of the railroad, the community became a busy grain-trading center.

Spruce Grove was incorporated as a village on March 14, 1907, but it was dissolved on August 30, 1916. Spruce Grove was re-incorporated as a village on January 1, 1955, and incorporated as a town on January 1, 1971, and as a city on March 1, 1986.

== Geography ==
Spruce Grove is near the province&#x27;s geographical centre, at from downtown Edmonton and from Edmonton&#x27;s city limits. It is part of the Edmonton Metropolitan Region.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the City of Spruce Grove had a population of 37,645 living in 14,273 of its 14,752 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 34,108. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The population of the City of according to its 2017 municipal census is 34,881, a change of from its 2016 municipal census population of 33,640.

== Arts and culture == 
The Spruce Grove Art Gallery is in the Melcor Cultural Centre and is operated by the Allied Arts Council of Spruce Grove. The gallery hosts ongoing shows for original art created by its members, made up of artists from mainly the Spruce Grove, Stony Plain and Parkland County area.

Horizon Stage hosts many plays and acts throughout the year, as well as a lot of community theatre. Spruce Grove also has a 7 screen theatre complex which opened in the fall of 2007.

Another cultural facility within the city is the Spruce Grove Grain Elevator Museum.

== Attractions ==
The TransAlta Tri Leisure Centre, opened in 2002, provides a pool, soccer fields, a gymnasium, workout gym, and ice rinks to the people of Parkland County. Spruce Grove has bike trails winding throughout the city, called the Heritage Grove Trail, where bike riders can ride for hours through lush forest. On June 7, 2008, Spruce Grove held the grand opening of the West District Park, which features two full artificial surface fields for football, soccer and other activities. The Edmonton Eskimos donated $10,000 towards the event and held practice at the facility as part of the first-day activities.

== Sports ==
Spruce Grove has a number of youths and adults involved in amateur sports, that run year round. Box lacrosse runs from March to July under the organization Parkland Posse, which pulls young people from the Tri communities of Spruce Grove, Stony Plain and Parkland County. Hockey runs from September to April, soccer and rugby run from May to October, football runs from July to December and baseball runs from March to October. The Spruce Grove Saints are a Junior A hockey team that play in the British Columbia Hockey League.

The TransAlta Tri Leisure Centre is an activity centre formed as a union between the municipalities of Parkland County, Stony Plain and Spruce Grove. It is in the west end of Spruce Grove. The centre was opened to the public by Premier Ralph Klein on September 18, 2002.

, the Myshak Metro Ballpark is under construction. Upon completion, it will become the home stadium of the Edmonton Prospects.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===
;Highways
:Two highways pass through Spruce Grove, Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) and Highway 16A. Highway 16 has no traffic lights but has two exits into Spruce Grove, while Highway 16A has several traffic intersections. Travelling east on either of these highways leads to Edmonton. Travelling west on Highway 16A leads to Stony Plain, and going west on either highway leads to Edson, Hinton, and eventually Jasper.
;Local streets
:The majority of the streets in Spruce Grove use a standard naming system. Their names share a first letter with that of its subdivision. For example, all streets start with &quot;M&quot; in Millgrove subdivision; in Woodhaven, they all start with &quot;W&quot;. Only in the original subdivision of Broxton Park and the downtown core is this naming convention not utilized.
;Rail
:&quot;The Canadian&quot; passenger train travels through the city, however, the nearest stop is at Edmonton.
;Transit
:Edmonton Transit Service offers a commuter transit route from Spruce Grove to Edmonton, peak hours only. There is also a local transit service run by the city for transportation within the city boundaries.

<text>Eugene L. Mingo (born September 22, 1938) is an American former professional football player who played in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). He played several positions including halfback, placekicker, and return specialist. He is widely recognized as the first African American placekicker in football.

==Early life==
He played youth football at the behest of a cousin, Dean Newby. After quitting, his cousin was angry. He called Gene a quitter, and tried to get him to come back. Shortly after, his cousin lost his life when mauled by a dog. When his aunt called him a quitter, too, he went back to football. After missing a couple of years to care for his terminally ill mother, he returned to school and found out that he excelled at football.

He later dropped out of high school and joined the Navy where he played for a Navy team and was a star. After his discharge, he returned to Akron and worked at the Goodyear plant. 
==Pro career==
Reading the paper in the lead up to the inaugural 1960 season, he read about a former opponent who had played for the Army who was signed by the Denver Broncos. He wrote them a letter and received a contract. He made the team without having played any college football.

In 1960, he had the first punt return for a touchdown in the American Football League, for the Denver Broncos. That touchdown won the first-ever American Football League game, as the Broncos defeated the Boston Patriots. Mingo also scored the first points in Mile High Stadium, then called Bears Stadium, with an 18-yard field goal. In the 1961 season opener at War Memorial Stadium against the Buffalo Bills, Mingo threw a touchdown pass, from the halfback position, to help the Broncos win 22-10: a 50-yarder to Lionel Taylor in the first quarter. Mingo kicked the PATs after each score. He led the American Football League in scoring as a rookie in 1960 with 123 points and in 1962 with 137 points. Mingo holds the Broncos&#x27; franchise record for the longest touchdown run, an 82-yarder against the Raiders in 1962. He also played for the Oakland Raiders, Miami Dolphins, and Washington Redskins. He kicked for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1969 and 1970.

==Personal life==
After he retired, Mingo became a drug and alcohol counselor in the Denver area. He also spent many years involved with the Denver Broncos Alumni Association.

==Legacy==
On September 14, 2014, Mingo, along with Dan Reeves and Rick Upchurch, was inducted into the Broncos Ring of Fame.

<doc id="329549" wikidata="Q849425" url="?curid=329549" title="Surface of revolution">
<text>A surface of revolution is a surface in Euclidean space created by rotating a curve (the &quot;generatrix&quot;) one full revolution around an &quot;axis of rotation&quot; (normally not intersecting the generatrix, except at its endpoints).
The volume bounded by the surface created by this revolution is the &quot;solid of revolution&quot;.

Examples of surfaces of revolution generated by a straight line are cylindrical and conical surfaces depending on whether or not the line is parallel to the axis. A circle that is rotated around any diameter generates a sphere of which it is then a great circle, and if the circle is rotated around an axis that does not intersect the interior of a circle, then it generates a torus which does not intersect itself (a ring torus).

==Properties==
The sections of the surface of revolution made by planes through the axis are called &quot;meridional sections&quot;. Any meridional section can be considered to be the generatrix in the plane determined by it and the axis.

The sections of the surface of revolution made by planes that are perpendicular to the axis are circles.

Some special cases of hyperboloids (of either one or two sheets) and elliptic paraboloids are surfaces of revolution. These may be identified as those quadratic surfaces all of whose cross sections perpendicular to the axis are circular.

==Area formula==
If the curve is described by the parametric functions , , with ranging over some interval , and the axis of revolution is the -axis, then the surface area is given by the integral
formula_1
provided that is never negative between the endpoints and . This formula is the calculus equivalent of Pappus&#x27;s centroid theorem. The quantity
formula_2
comes from the Pythagorean theorem and represents a small segment of the arc of the curve, as in the arc length formula. The quantity is the path of (the centroid of) this small segment, as required by Pappus&#x27; theorem.

Likewise, when the axis of rotation is the -axis and provided that is never negative, the area is given by
formula_3

If the continuous curve is described by the function , , then the integral becomes
formula_4
for revolution around the -axis, and
formula_5
for revolution around the &quot;y&quot;-axis (provided ). These come from the above formula.

This can also be derived from multivariable integration. If a plane curve is given by formula_6 then its corresponding surface of revolution when revolved around the x-axis has Cartesian coordinates given by formula_7 with formula_8. Then the surface area is given by the surface integral 
formula_9

Computing the partial derivatives yields
formula_10
formula_11
and computing the cross product yields 
formula_12
where the trigonometric identity formula_13 was used. With this cross product, we get
formula_14
where the same trigonometric identity was used again. The derivation for a surface obtained by revolving around the y-axis is similar.

For example, the spherical surface with unit radius is generated by the curve , , when ranges over . Its area is therefore
formula_15

For the case of the spherical curve with radius , rotated about the -axis
formula_16

A minimal surface of revolution is the surface of revolution of the curve between two given points which minimizes surface area. A basic problem in the calculus of variations is finding the curve between two points that produces this minimal surface of revolution.

There are only two minimal surfaces of revolution (surfaces of revolution which are also minimal surfaces): the plane and the catenoid.

==Coordinate expressions==
A surface of revolution given by rotating a curve described by formula_17 around the x-axis may be most simply described by formula_18. This yields the parametrization in terms of formula_19 and formula_20 as formula_21. If instead we revolve the curve around the y-axis, then the curve is described by formula_22, yielding the expression formula_23 in terms of the parameters formula_19 and formula_20. 

If x and y are defined in terms of a parameter formula_26, then we obtain a parametrization in terms of formula_26 and formula_20. If formula_19 and formula_30 are functions of formula_26, then the surface of revolution obtained by revolving the curve around the x-axis is described by formula_32, and the surface of revolution obtained by revolving the curve around the y-axis is described by formula_33.

==Geodesics==
Meridians are always geodesics on a surface of revolution. Other geodesics are governed by Clairaut&#x27;s relation.

==Toroids==
A surface of revolution with a hole in, where the axis of revolution does not intersect the surface, is called a toroid. For example, when a rectangle is rotated around an axis parallel to one of its edges, then a hollow square-section ring is produced. If the revolved figure is a circle, then the object is called a torus.

<doc id="329550" wikidata="Q1338153" url="?curid=329550" title="20th-century classical music">
<text>20th-century classical music is art music that was written between the years 1901 and 2000, inclusive. Musical style diverged during the 20th century as it never had previously, so this century was without a dominant style. Modernism, impressionism, and post-romanticism can all be traced to the decades before the turn of the 20th century, but can be included because they evolved beyond the musical boundaries of the 19th-century styles that were part of the earlier common practice period. Neoclassicism and expressionism came mostly after 1900. Minimalism started later in the century and can be seen as a change from the modern to postmodern era, although some date postmodernism from as early as about 1930. Aleatory, atonality, serialism, &quot;musique concrète&quot;, and electronic music were all developed during the century. Jazz and ethnic folk music became important influences on many composers during this century.

==History==
At the turn of the century, music was characteristically late Romantic in style. Composers such as Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss and Jean Sibelius were pushing the bounds of post-Romantic symphonic writing. At the same time, the Impressionist movement, spearheaded by Claude Debussy, was being developed in France. Debussy in fact loathed the term Impressionism: &quot;I am trying to do &#x27;something different—in a way realities—what the imbeciles call &#x27;impressionism&#x27; is a term which is as poorly used as possible, particularly by art critics&quot;. Maurice Ravel&#x27;s music, also often labelled as impressionist, explores music in many styles not always related to it (see the discussion on Neoclassicism, below).

Many composers reacted to the Post-Romantic and Impressionist styles and moved in different directions. An important moment in defining the course of music throughout the century was the widespread break with traditional tonality, effected in diverse ways by different composers in the first decade of the century. From this sprang an unprecedented &quot;linguistic plurality&quot; of styles, techniques, and expression. In Vienna, Arnold Schoenberg developed atonality, out of the expressionism that arose in the early part of the 20th century. He later developed the twelve-tone technique which was developed further by his disciples Alban Berg and Anton Webern; later composers (including Pierre Boulez) developed it further still. Stravinsky (in his last works) explored twelve-tone technique, too, as did many other composers; indeed, even Scott Bradley used the technique in his scores for the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons.

After the First World War, composers started returning to the past for inspiration and wrote works that drew elements (form, harmony, melody, structure) from it. This type of music thus became labelled neoclassicism. Igor Stravinsky (&quot;Pulcinella&quot;), Sergei Prokofiev (&quot;Classical Symphony&quot;), Ravel (&quot;Le Tombeau de Couperin&quot;), Manuel de Falla (&quot;El retablo de maese Pedro&quot;) and Paul Hindemith (&quot;&quot;) all produced neoclassical works.

Italian composers such as Francesco Balilla Pratella and Luigi Russolo developed musical Futurism. This style often tried to recreate everyday sounds and place them in a &quot;Futurist&quot; context. The &quot;Machine Music&quot; of George Antheil (starting with his Second Sonata, &quot;The Airplane&quot;) and Alexander Mosolov (most notoriously his &quot;Iron Foundry&quot;) developed out of this. The process of extending musical vocabulary by exploring all available tones was pushed further by the use of Microtones in works by Charles Ives, Julián Carrillo, Alois Hába, John Foulds, Ivan Wyschnegradsky, Harry Partch and Mildred Couper among many others. Microtones are those intervals that are smaller than a semitone; human voices and unfretted strings can easily produce them by going in between the &quot;normal&quot; notes, but other instruments will have more difficulty—the piano and organ have no way of producing them at all, aside from retuning and/or major reconstruction.

In the 1940s and 50s composers, notably Pierre Schaeffer, started to explore the application of technology to music in musique concrète. The term electroacoustic music was later coined to include all forms of music involving magnetic tape, computers, synthesizers, multimedia, and other electronic devices and techniques. Live electronic music uses live electronic sounds within a performance (as opposed to preprocessed sounds that are overdubbed during a performance), John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Cartridge Music&quot; being an early example. Spectral music (Gérard Grisey and Tristan Murail) is a further development of electroacoustic music that uses analyses of sound spectra to create music. Cage, Berio, Boulez, Milton Babbitt, Luigi Nono and Edgard Varèse all wrote electroacoustic music.

From the early 1950s onwards, Cage introduced elements of chance into his music. Process music (Karlheinz Stockhausen &quot;Prozession&quot;, &quot;Aus den sieben Tagen&quot;; and Steve Reich &quot;Piano Phase&quot;, &quot;Clapping Music&quot;) explores a particular process which is essentially laid bare in the work. The term experimental music was coined by Cage to describe works that produce unpredictable results, according to the definition &quot;an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen&quot;. The term is also used to describe music within specific genres that pushes against their boundaries or definitions, or else whose approach is a hybrid of disparate styles, or incorporates unorthodox, new, distinctly unique ingredients.

Important cultural trends often informed music of this period, romantic, modernist, neoclassical, postmodernist or otherwise. Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev were particularly drawn to primitivism in their early careers, as explored in works such as &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; and &quot;Chout&quot;. Other Russians, notably Dmitri Shostakovich, reflected the social impact of communism and subsequently had to work within the strictures of socialist realism in their music. Other composers, such as Benjamin Britten (&quot;War Requiem&quot;), explored political themes in their works, albeit entirely at their own volition. Nationalism was also an important means of expression in the early part of the century. The culture of the United States of America, especially, began informing an American vernacular style of classical music, notably in the works of Charles Ives, John Alden Carpenter, and (later) George Gershwin. Folk music (Vaughan Williams&#x27; &quot;Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus&quot;, Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;A Somerset Rhapsody&quot;) and jazz (Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein, Darius Milhaud&#x27;s &quot;La création du monde&quot;) were also influential.

In the last quarter of the century, eclecticism and polystylism became important. These, as well as minimalism, New Complexity, and New Simplicity, are more fully explored in their respective articles.

==Styles==

===Romantic style===
At the end of the 19th century (often called the &quot;Fin de siècle&quot;), the Romantic style was starting to break apart, moving along various parallel courses, such as Impressionism and Post-romanticism. In the 20th century, the different styles that emerged from the music of the previous century influenced composers to follow new trends, sometimes as a reaction to that music, sometimes as an extension of it, and both trends co-existed well into the 20th century. The former trends, such as Expressionism are discussed later.

In the early part of the 20th century, many composers wrote music which was an extension of 19th-century Romantic music, and traditional instrumental groupings such as the orchestra and string quartet remained the most typical. Traditional forms such as the symphony and concerto remained in use. Gustav Mahler and Jean Sibelius are examples of composers who took the traditional symphonic forms and reworked them. (See Romantic music.) Some writers hold that Schoenberg&#x27;s work is squarely within the late-Romantic tradition of Wagner and Brahms and, more generally, that &quot;the composer who most directly and completely connects late Wagner and the 20th century is Arnold Schoenberg&quot;.

===Neoclassicism===

Neoclassicism was a style cultivated between the two world wars, which sought to revive the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of the 17th and 18th centuries, in a repudiation of what were seen as exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism. Because these composers generally replaced the functional tonality of their models with extended tonality, modality, or atonality, the term is often taken to imply parody or distortion of the Baroque or Classical style. Famous examples include Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Classical Symphony&quot; and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Pulcinella&quot;, &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot;, and Concerto in E-flat &quot;Dumbarton Oaks&quot;. Paul Hindemith (&quot;&quot;), Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc (&quot;Concert champêtre&quot;), and Manuel de Falla (&quot;El retablo de maese Pedro&quot;, Harpsichord Concerto) also used this style. Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Le Tombeau de Couperin&quot; is often seen as neo-baroque (an architectural term), though the distinction between the terms is not always made.

===Jazz-influenced classical composition===


A number of composers combined elements of the jazz idiom with classical compositional styles, notably:
*Malcolm Arnold in two clarinet concertos for Benny Goodman
*Leonard Bernstein in West Side Story and Candide
*Aaron Copland in his Piano Concerto and Clarinet Concerto
*George Gershwin in Rhapsody in Blue, An American in Paris, and his many musicals
*Nikolai Kapustin in &quot;Suite in the Old Style&quot;
*Constant Lambert in &quot;The Rio Grande,&quot; and his Piano Sonata and the &quot;Concerto for piano and nine Instruments&quot;
*Darius Milhaud in &quot;La création du monde&quot;
*Maurice Ravel in his Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata No. 2
*Gunther Schuller (third stream) in &quot;Transformation&quot;, &quot;Concertino&quot;, &quot;Abstraction&quot;, and &quot;Variants on a Theme of Thelonious Monk&quot;
*John Serry Sr. in his American Rhapsody and &quot;Concerto For Free Bass Accordion&quot;
*Dmitri Shostakovich in his Suite for Jazz Orchestra No. 1 and Suite for Jazz Orchestra No. 2
*Igor Stravinsky in his &quot;Ebony Concerto&quot; 
“Jazz” or African American music was revolutionary to more than just America in the 20th century. It expresses the division between the oppressor and the oppressed. The genre of jazz reflects the changes of African American oppressed nationality as it paralleled the rise of imperialism, which many African Americans opposed.

==Movements==

===Impressionism===

Impressionism started in France as a reaction, led by Claude Debussy, against the emotional exuberance and epic themes of German Romanticism exemplified by Wagner. In Debussy&#x27;s view, art was a sensuous experience, rather than an intellectual or ethical one. He urged his countrymen to rediscover the French masters of the 18th century, for whom music was meant to charm, to entertain, and to serve as a &quot;fantasy of the senses&quot;.

Other composers associated with impressionism include Maurice Ravel, Albert Roussel, Isaac Albéniz, Paul Dukas, Manuel de Falla, Charles Martin Loeffler, Charles Griffes, Frederick Delius, Ottorino Respighi, Cyril Scott and Karol Szymanowski. Many French composers continued impressionism&#x27;s language through the 1920s and later, including Albert Roussel, Charles Koechlin, André Caplet, and, later, Olivier Messiaen. Composers from non-Western cultures, such as Tōru Takemitsu, and jazz musicians such as Duke Ellington, Gil Evans, Art Tatum, and Cecil Taylor also have been strongly influenced by the impressionist musical language.

===Modernism===
====Futurism====

At its conception, Futurism was an Italian artistic movement founded in 1909 by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti; it was quickly embraced by the Russian avant-garde. In 1913, the painter Luigi Russolo published a manifesto, &quot;L&#x27;arte dei rumori&quot; (The Art of Noises), calling for the incorporation of noises of every kind into music. In addition to Russolo, composers directly associated with this movement include the Italians Silvio Mix, Nuccio Fiorda, Franco Casavola, and Pannigi (whose 1922 &quot;Ballo meccanico&quot; included two motorcycles), and the Russians Artur Lourié, Mikhail Matyushin, and Nikolai Roslavets.

Though few of the futurist works of these composers are performed today, the influence of futurism on the later development of 20th-century music was enormous. Sergei Prokofiev, Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky, Arthur Honegger, George Antheil, Leo Ornstein, and Edgard Varèse are among the notable composers in the first half of the century who were influenced by futurism. Characteristic features of later 20th-century music with origins in futurism include the prepared piano, integral serialism, extended vocal techniques, graphic notation, improvisation, and minimalism.

===Free dissonance and experimentalism===

In the early part of the 20th century, Charles Ives integrated American and European traditions as well as vernacular and church styles, while using innovative techniques in his rhythm, harmony, and form. His technique included the use of polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatoric elements, and quarter tones. Edgard Varèse wrote highly dissonant pieces that utilized unusual sonorities and futuristic, scientific-sounding names. He pioneered the use of new instruments and electronic resources (see below).

===Expressionism===
By the late 1920s, though many composers continued to write in a vaguely expressionist manner, it was being supplanted by the more impersonal style of the German Neue Sachlichkeit and neoclassicism. Because expressionism, like any movement that had been stigmatized by the Nazis, gained a sympathetic reconsideration following World War II, expressionist music resurfaced in works by composers such as Hans Werner Henze, Pierre Boulez, Peter Maxwell Davies, Wolfgang Rihm, and Bernd Alois Zimmermann.

===Postmodern music===
Postmodernism is a reaction to modernism, but it can also be viewed as a response to a deep-seated shift in societal attitude. According to this latter view, postmodernism began when historic (as opposed to personal) optimism turned to pessimism, at the latest by 1930.

John Cage is a prominent figure in 20th-century music, claimed with some justice both for modernism and postmodernism because the complex intersections between modernism and postmodernism are not reducible to simple schemata. His influence steadily grew during his lifetime. He often uses elements of chance: Imaginary Landscape No. 4 for 12 radio receivers, and Music of Changes for piano. Sonatas and Interludes (1946–48) is composed for a prepared piano: a normal piano whose timbre is dramatically altered by carefully placing various objects inside the piano in contact with the strings. Currently, postmodernism includes composers who react against the avant-garde and experimental styles of the late 20th century such as Astor Piazzolla, Argentina, and Miguel del Águila, USA.

===Minimalism===
In the later 20th century, composers such as La Monte Young, Arvo Pärt, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and John Adams began to explore what is now called minimalism, in which the work is stripped down to its most fundamental features; the music often features repetition and iteration. An early example is Terry Riley&#x27;s &quot;In C&quot; (1964), an aleatoric work in which short phrases are chosen by the musicians from a set list and played an arbitrary number of times, while the note C is repeated in eighth notes (quavers) behind them.

Steve Reich&#x27;s works &quot;Piano Phase&quot; (1967, for two pianos), and &quot;Drumming&quot; (1970–71, for percussion, female voices and piccolo) employ the technique called phasing in which a phrase played by one player maintaining a constant pace is played simultaneously by another but at a slightly quicker pace. This causes the players to go &quot;out of phase&quot; with each other and the performance may continue until they come back in phase. According to Reich, “&quot;Drumming&quot; is the final expansion and refinement of the phasing process, as well as the first use of four new techniques: (1) the process of gradually substituting beats for rests (or rests for beats); (2) the gradual changing of timbre while rhythm and pitch remain constant; (3) the simultaneous combination of instruments of different timbre; and (4) the use of the human voice to become part of the musical ensemble by imitating the exact sound of the instruments”. &quot;Drumming&quot; was Reich’s final use of the phasing technique.

Philip Glass&#x27;s &quot;1 + 1&quot; (1968) employs the additive process in which short phrases are slowly expanded. La Monte Young&#x27;s &quot;Compositions 1960&quot; employs very long tones, exceptionally high volumes and extra-musical techniques such as &quot;draw a straight line and follow it&quot; or &quot;build a fire&quot;. Michael Nyman argues that minimalism was a reaction to and made possible by both serialism and indeterminism. (See also experimental music.)

==Techniques==

===Atonality and twelve-tone technique===
Arnold Schoenberg is one of the most significant figures in 20th-century music. While his early works were in a late Romantic style influenced by Wagner (&quot;Verklärte Nacht&quot;, 1899), this evolved into an atonal idiom in the years before the First World War (&quot;Drei Klavierstücke&quot; in 1909 and &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot; in 1912). In 1921, after several years of research, he developed the twelve-tone technique of composition, which he first described privately to his associates in 1923. His first large-scale work entirely composed using this technique was the Wind Quintet, Op. 26, written in 1923–24. Later examples include the Variations for Orchestra, Op. 31 (1926–28), the Third and Fourth String Quartets (1927 and 1936, respectively), the Violin Concerto (1936) and Piano Concerto (1942). In later years, he intermittently returned to a more tonal style (&quot;Kammersymphonie no. 2&quot;, begun in 1906 but completed only in 1939; &quot;Variations on a Recitative&quot; for organ in 1941).

He taught Anton Webern and Alban Berg and these three composers are often referred to as the principal members of the Second Viennese School (Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven—and sometimes Schubert—being regarded as the First Viennese School in this context). Webern wrote works using a rigorous twelve-tone method and influenced the development of total serialism. Berg, like Schoenberg, employed twelve-tone technique within a late-romantic or post-romantic style (Violin Concerto, which quotes a Bach Choral and uses Classical form). He wrote two major operas (&quot;Wozzeck&quot; and &quot;Lulu&quot;).

==Electronic music==

The development of recording technology made all sounds available for potential use as musical material. Electronic music generally refers to a repertory of art music developed in the 1950s in Europe, Japan, and the Americas. The increasing availability of magnetic tape in this decade provided composers with a medium which allowed recording sounds and then manipulating them in various ways. All electronic music depends on transmission via loudspeakers, but there are two broad types: acousmatic music, which exists only in recorded form meant for loudspeaker listening, and live electronic music, in which electronic apparatus are used to generate, transform, or trigger sounds during performance by musicians using voices, traditional instruments, electro-acoustic instruments, or other devices. Beginning in 1957, computers became increasingly important in this field. When the source material was acoustical sounds from the everyday world, the term musique concrète was used; when the sounds were produced by electronic generators, it was designated electronic music. 

After the 1950s, the term &quot;electronic music&quot; came to be used for both types. Sometimes such electronic music was combined with more conventional instruments, Edgard Varèse&#x27;s &quot;Déserts&quot; (1954), Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Hymnen&quot; (1969), Claude Vivier&#x27;s &quot;Wo bist du Licht!&quot; (1981), and Mario Davidovsky&#x27;s series of &quot;Synchronisms&quot; (1963–2006) are notable examples.

<doc id="329552" wikidata="Q7750994" url="?curid=329552" title="The Men Who Killed Kennedy">
<text>The Men Who Killed Kennedy is a video documentary series by British television network ITV that depicts the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Originally broadcast in 1988 in two parts (with a subsequent studio discussion), it was rebroadcast in 1991 re-edited to three parts with additional material, and a fourth episode added in 1995. The addition of three further episodes in 2003 caused great controversy, particularly in the final episode implicating Lyndon B. Johnson and the withdrawal of these additional episodes.

==Broadcast history and critical response==

===1988 to 2003===
&quot;The Men Who Killed Kennedy&quot; began with two 50-minute segments originally aired on 25 October 1988 in the United Kingdom, entitled simply &quot;Part One&quot; and &quot;Part Two.&quot; The programmes were produced by Central Television for the ITV network, and was followed three weeks later with a studio discussion on the issues titled &quot;The Story Continues,&quot; chaired by broadcaster Peter Sissons.

The original broadcast was controversial in Britain. The episodes identify three men as the assassins of Kennedy: deceased drug trafficker Lucien Sarti and two living men (Roger Bocagnani and Sauveur Pironti). All three were later revealed to have strong alibis: Sarti was undergoing medical treatment in France, another was in prison at the time, and the third had been in the French Navy. One of the two living men threatened to sue, and Central Television&#x27;s own subsequent investigation into the allegations revealed they were &quot;total nonsense&quot;. Turner justified his failure to interview one of the accused on the grounds that the individual was &quot;too dangerous&quot;. Turner was censured by the British Parliament. The Independent Broadcasting Authority forced Central Television to produce a third episode dedicated to the false allegations, which aired on November 16, 1988, which was later referred to as a &quot;studio crucifixion&quot; of Turner and his inaccuracies.

The United States corporation, Arts &amp; Entertainment Company, purchased the rights to the original two segments. In 1989, the series was nominated for a Flaherty Documentary Award. In November 1991, the series was re-edited with additional material and divided into three 50-minute programmes, which were also shown by ITV on consecutive nights. An additional episode appeared in 1995. The series typically aired in November every year and from time to time during the year.

===2003 onwards===
In November 2003, three additional segments (&quot;The Final Chapter&quot;) were added by the History Channel, entitled, respectively, &quot;The Smoking Guns&quot;, &quot;The Love Affair&quot; and &quot;The Guilty Men&quot;.

&quot;The Smoking Guns&quot; examines claims of changes to the procedures normally followed by the Secret Service on the day of the assassination, bullet damage to the windshield of the president&#x27;s limousine consistent with a bullet fired through it from the front, and discrepancies between observations made by the doctors who treated Kennedy at Parkland Hospital after the shooting and the official autopsy and photographs of the president&#x27;s body which were cited by the Warren Commission.

&quot;The Love Affair&quot; focuses on the claims that Judyth Vary Baker was Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s lover in 1963, and that she worked with Oswald and others to develop a cancer-causing biological weapon as part of a CIA plan to assassinate Fidel Castro.

The third of these additional segments – &quot;The Guilty Men&quot; – was based substantially on the book &quot;Blood, Money &amp; Power: How L.B.J. Killed J.F.K.&quot; by Barr McClellan. The book and the episode directly implicate Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) – who was the U.S. Vice President at the time of the assassination – and its airing in 2003 created an outcry among Johnson&#x27;s surviving associates, including Johnson&#x27;s widow, Lady Bird Johnson, former LBJ aides Bill Moyers and Jack Valenti (longtime president of the Motion Picture Association of America), as well as U.S. Presidents Gerald Ford – who was the last living Warren Commission member – and Jimmy Carter. These Johnson supporters lodged complaints of libel with the History Channel, and subsequently threatened legal action against Arts &amp; Entertainment Company, owner of the History Channel. The History Channel responded by assembling a panel of three historians, Robert Dallek, Stanley Kutler, and Thomas Sugrue. On a program aired April 7, 2004, titled &quot;The Guilty Man: A Historical Review&quot;, the panel agreed that the documentary was not credible and should not have aired. The History Channel issued a statement saying, in part, &quot;The History Channel recognizes that &#x27;The Guilty Men&#x27; failed to offer viewers context and perspective, and fell short of the high standards that the network sets for itself. The History Channel apologized to its viewers and to Mrs. Johnson and her family for airing the show.&quot; The channel said it would not show the episode again. Author Barr McClellan, on whose work the episode was largely based, complained that he had tried to cooperate with the reviewing historians to discuss his evidence with them and had been ignored.

Malcolm Liggett, a retired economics professor, labor economist at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and employee of the Office for Wage and Price Stability in the Executive Office of the President from 1975 to 1981 sued A&amp;E regarding the episode &quot;The Smoking Guns&quot;, which claims Liggett was involved in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Liggett and A&amp;E reached a settlement which required that a letter by Liggett be read on the show &quot;History Center.&quot;

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the documentary as &quot;well-researched, but still farfetched&quot;. Addressing &quot;The Guilty Men&quot; episode, Dorothy Rabinowitz of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called it a &quot;primitive piece of conspiracy-mongering&quot; and wrote that &quot;the documentary&#x27;s ever deepening mess of charges and motives is never less than clear about its main point—that Lyndon Johnson personally arranged the murder not only of the president, but also seven other people, including his own sister.&quot;

In a letter to the chief executives of the three parent companies of A&amp;E NetworksVictor F. Ganzi of the Hearst Corporation, Michael D. Eisner of Disney, and Robert C. Wright of NBCformer United States President Gerald Ford described the allegations as &quot;the most damaging accusations ever made against a former vice president and president in American history.&quot;

==Episode list==
&quot;The first two episodes were followed by &quot;The Story Continues&quot; (16 November 1988), a critical studio discussion about them. The final episode was followed by a critical review, &quot;The Guilty Men: A Historical Review.&quot; (7 April 2004).&quot;

<text>Restricted use pesticides (RUP) are pesticides not available to the general public in the United States. Fulfilling its pesticide regulation responsibilities, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registers all pesticides as either &quot;unclassified&quot; or &quot;restricted use&quot;. Unclassified pesticides are available over-the-counter, while the latter require a license to purchase and apply the product. Pesticides are classified as &quot;restricted use&quot; for a variety of reasons, such as potential for or history of groundwater contamination. 

The RUP classification restricts a product, or its uses, to use by a certificated pesticide applicator or under the direct supervision of a certified applicator. Certification programs are administered by the federal government, individual states, and by company policies that vary from state to state. This is managed by the EPA under the Worker Protection Standard, in cooperation with the United States Department of Agriculture.

The RUP list is part of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 152.175). Atrazine is the most widely used restricted-use herbicide, however there are over 700 RUPs as of 2017. Many insecticides and fungicides used in fruit production are restricted use.

== License ==
The Worker Protection Standard (WPS) identifies the type of requirements that must be satisfied to obtain the proper license needed to purchase and apply restricted use pesticide. The process required to obtain a pest control licenses is regulated by a combination of state laws, federal laws, common law, and private company policies. All RUP applications must be recorded to identify the date, location, and type of pesticide applied. Federal law requires a minimum record retention period, which may be three years or longer depending upon state laws. There are two licensee categories: supervisor and applicator. A pest control supervisor license is required to purchase RUP. Duties of a licensed pest control supervisor include:
* ensuring that pest control applicators are competent to use any restricted use products.
* maintaining application records for 3 years or more, as determined by state and federal laws. These records must identify the date, location, and type of pesticide that has been applied.
* notifying the local government agency that is responsible for air quality to satisfy laws governing the right to know regarding public health and safety risks when restricted use pesticides are applied outside buildings.

<text>Taddeo Gaddi (c. 1290, in Florence – 1366, in Florence) was a medieval Italian painter and architect.

He was the son of Gaddo di Zanobi, called Gaddo Gaddi. He was a member of Giotto&#x27;s workshop from 1313 until the master&#x27;s death in 1337. According to Giorgio Vasari, he was considered Giotto&#x27;s most talented pupil: in 1347 he was placed at the top in a list of Florence&#x27;s most renowned painters. He also traded as a merchant, and had a branch establishment in Venice. As well as a painter, he was a mosaicist and architect.

His main work is the cycle of &quot;Stories of the Virgin&quot; in the Baroncelli Chapel of the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence (1328–1338). Later he perhaps painted the cabinet tiles in the sacristy of the same church, now divided among the Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia of Florence and museums in Munich and Berlin. These works show his mastership of Giotto&#x27;s new style, to which he added a personal experimentation in the architectural backgrounds, such as in the staircase of the &quot;Presentation of the Virgin&quot; in the Baroncelli Chapel.

According to some scholars, he collaborated in the Stefaneschi Polyptych in Rome. His other works include a &quot; Madonna&quot; in Bern, an &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; in Dijon, the &quot;Stories of Job&quot; (Pisa, Camposanto Monumentale), the &quot;Madonna Enthroned with Child, Angels and Saints&quot; (Florence, Uffizi Gallery), &quot;The Stigmatization of Saint Francis&quot; (Cambridge, MA, Harvard Art Museums), the &quot;Madonna del Parto&quot; (Florence), and the Polyptych in Santa Felicita&#x27;s sacristy, Florence. Barcelona&#x27;s MNAC keeps as a permanent loan from the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid a small tempera panel dated in 1325, a &quot;Nativity&quot; that was part of a larger table. Vasari credited him also of the design and reconstruction of the Ponte Vecchio, which is however disputed by modern scholars.

He was the father of Agnolo Gaddi and Giovanni Gaddi.

<text>The Cossatot River is an river in Howard, Polk and Sevier counties in the U.S. state of Arkansas.

The Cossatot begins in the Ouachita Mountains southeast of Mena, Arkansas. The river flows through the Ouachita National Forest and then in a generally southerly direction until it empties into Gillham Lake. After exiting Gillham Lake the river becomes leisurely until it joins with the Little River at the site where it empties into Millwood Lake.

Cossatot comes from an Indian term which translates roughly to skull crusher. The Cossatot is known as a difficult (class II - IV+) whitewater stream to canoeists and kayakers and a section at Cossatot Falls in Howard County, Arkansas has been called &quot;the most challenging section of whitewater between the Smokies and the Rockies,&quot; though there are many more challenging runs in the state of Arkansas, such as Richland Creek, Crooked Creek or the Upper Buffalo (Hailstone run). An 11-mile (18-km) section including Cossatot Falls is designated as the Cossatot River State Park-Natural Area. Cossatot Falls is a series of back-to-back class III-IV+ rapids that drops around 40 feet in 1/8 of a mile. Rapid names are Cossatosser (class II+), Eye Opener, B.M.F. (class III), Washing Machine (class IV+), Whiplash, (class III+), and Shoulderbone (class II), with Deer Camp Rapid (class III), Devil&#x27;s Hollow Rapid (class III+), and Devil&#x27;s Hollow Falls (class IV) located downstream of the Falls area. Zigzag (Class III) and the Esses (class III) are other notable rapids on the Cossatot, located above the Falls. Whitewater rapid classes vary depending on water level. At certain higher levels near flood state, almost all of the Cossatot Falls turn into one long rapid.

The World War II fleet oiler USS &quot;Cossatot&quot; (AO-77) is named after this river.

Camping sites are located near the Cossatot Falls area, and at the nearby Brushy Creek Recreation area.

The Cossatot is listed as a &quot;National Wild and Scenic River&quot; and an &quot;Arkansas Natural and Scenic River&quot;.

<text>Agnolo Gaddi (c.1350–1396) was an Italian painter. He was born and died in Florence, and was the son of the painter Taddeo Gaddi, who was himself the major pupil of the Florentine master Giotto.

Agnolo was a painter and mosaicist, trained by his father, and a merchant as well; in middle age he settled down to commercial life in Venice, and he added greatly to the family wealth. He died in Florence in October 1396.

Agnolo was an influential and prolific artist who was the last major Florentine painter stylistically descended from Giotto. His paintings show much early promise, although suggests his abilities did not progress as he advanced in life. One of the earliest works, at San Jacopo tra i Fossi, Florence, represents the &quot;Resurrection of Lazarus.&quot; Another probably youthful performance is the series of frescoes of the Prato Cathedral—legends of the Virgin and of her Sacred Girdle; the &quot;Marriage of Mary&quot; is one of the best of this series, the later compositions in which have suffered much by renewals. In Santa Croce, Florence he painted, in eight frescoes, the legend of the Cross, beginning with the archangel Michael giving Seth a branch from the Tree of Knowledge, and ending with the emperor Heraclius carrying the Cross as he enters Jerusalem; in this picture is a portrait of the painter himself.

Among his pupils was the author of an art treatise, Cennino Cennini, who mentions him in the book.

Giorgio Vasari included a biography of Agnolo Gaddi in his &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;.

<doc id="329572" wikidata="Q524634" url="?curid=329572" title="Cassia gens">
<text>The gens Cassia was a Roman family of great antiquity. The earliest members of this gens appearing in history may have been patrician, but all those appearing in later times were plebeians. The first of the Cassii to obtain the consulship was Spurius Cassius Vecellinus, in 502 BC. He proposed the first agrarian law, for which he was charged with aspiring to make himself king, and put to death by the patrician nobility. The Cassii were amongst the most prominent families of the later Republic, and they frequently held high office, lasting well into imperial times. Among their namesakes are the Via Cassia, the road to Arretium, and the village of Cassianum Hirpinum, originally an estate belonging to one of this family in the country of the Hirpini.

Their most famous member is Gaius Cassius Longinus, an assassin of Julius Caesar alongside Brutus.

==Origin==

A possible clue to the origin of the Cassii is the &quot;cognomen Viscellinus&quot; or &quot;Vecellinus&quot;, borne by the first of this gens to appear in history. It appears to be derived from the town of Viscellium or Vescellium, a settlement of the Hirpini, which is mentioned by Titus Livius in connection with the Second Punic War. The town was one of three captured by the praetor Marcus Valerius Laevinus after they had revolted in 215 BC. Its inhabitants, the Viscellani, are also mentioned by Pliny the Elder. This suggests the possibility that the ancestors of the Cassii were from Hirpinum, or had some other connection with Viscellium. The existence of a substantial estate of the Cassii in Hirpinum at a later time further supports such a connection.

Spurius Cassius Vecellinus, thrice consul at the beginning of the Republic, has traditionally been regarded as a patrician, in part because all of the consuls before 366 BC were supposed to have been patricians. The previous year saw the passage of the &quot;lex Licinia Sextia&quot;, formally permitting the plebeians to stand for the consulship. However, scholars have long suspected that a number of consuls bearing traditionally plebeian names during the nearly century and a half before this law were in fact plebeians, and that the original intent of the &quot;lex Licinia Sextia&quot; was not to open the consulship to the plebeians, but to require the election of a plebeian consul each year, although this was not permanently achieved for a number of years after its passage. Viscellinus may thus have been a plebeian, who made enemies of the patricians through his efforts at agrarian reform, and his proposed treaty with Rome&#x27;s allies during his last consulship.

However, this point cannot be definitely settled. Many patrician families had plebeian branches, and it was common for families to vanish into obscurity for decades or even centuries, before returning to prominence in the Roman state. Patricians could also be expelled from their order, or voluntarily go over to the plebeians; but few examples are known. It may be that the sons of Viscellinus were expelled from the patriciate in lieu of being executed, or that they chose to pass over to the plebeians following their father&#x27;s betrayal and murder.

From the imagery on their coins, it appears that the Cassii had a special devotion to the Aventine Triad of Ceres, Liber, and Libera, for whom Spurius Cassius Vecellinus built a temple on the Aventine Hill in 494. Libertas, a goddess associated with Liber and Libera, also features regularly on their coins. She was later the emblem of the &quot;Liberatores&quot; during the Civil War led by Gaius Cassius Longinus and Brutus against Octavian and Mark Antony.

==Praenomina==
The principal names of the Cassii during the Republic were &quot;Lucius&quot;, &quot;Gaius&quot;, and &quot;Quintus&quot;. The praenomen &quot;Spurius&quot; is known only from Spurius Cassius Vecellinus, at the very beginning of the Republic, while &quot;Marcus&quot; appears in the first century BC.

==Branches and cognomina==
The chief family of the Cassii in the time of the Republic bears the name of &quot;Longinus&quot;. The other &quot;cognomina&quot; during this time are &quot;Parmensis&quot;, &quot;Sabaco&quot;, &quot;Varus&quot;, and &quot;Viscellinus&quot;. One of the earliest Roman historians was Lucius Cassius Hemina, whose cognomen—unique in Roman history—comes from a unit of measure of about half a pint, or a quarter litre, perhaps an allusion to his short stature. A number of other surnames are found from the final century of the Republic onwards. The famous censor Lucius Cassius Longinus also used the agnomen &quot;Ravilla&quot;. A single &quot;Caecianus&quot; is known; his cognomen shows that he or an ancestor was adopted from the gens Caecia. He might have been related to the Longini as he pictured Ceres on the coins he minted.

==History==
Shimabara is within ancient Hizen Province. It developed as a castle town around Shimabara Castle which was the capital of Shimabara Domain during the Edo period. It was the site of considerable foreign trade and missionary activity during the late Muromachi period, and in the early Edo period, a large percentage of the population were &quot;Kirishitan&quot;. Due to misgovernment, high taxes and persecution of Christianity, the population rose up during the Shimabara Rebellion of 1637, which was suppressed with extreme severity by the Tokugawa shogunate. Shimabara was subsequently ruled by a branch of the Matsudaira clan from 1668 to 1774 and from 1774 to 1871.

After the Meiji restoration, the town of Shimabara was created with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Shimabara town annexed neighboring Shimabara village and Minato town on April 1, 1924. On April 1, 1940, it annexed Annaka and Sugitani villages and was raised to city status. Shimabara annexed neighboring Mikae village on April 1, 1955. On January 1, 2006, the town of Ariake (from Minamitakaki District) was merged into Shimabara.

Throughout its history, Shimabara has been dominated by the seismic activity of Mount Unzen. A major volcanic eruption in 1792 resulted in a tsunami that destroyed most of the town and killed over 15,000 people, in one of Japan&#x27;s worst volcanic disasters. In more recent history, major eruptions in 1990–1991 resulted in pyroclastic flows, which killed 43 people and forced the temporary evacuation of hundreds of others. The 5th International Conference of Cities on Volcanoes was held in Shimabara on November 19–23, 2007.

Isahaya was part of ancient Hizen Province. The place name of &quot;Isahaya&quot; appears in documents from the Kamakura period. During the Sengoku period, the area was controlled by a cadet branch of the Ryūzōji clan. It was part of the holdings of Saga Domain during the Edo Period. The town of Isahaya was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. On April 1, 1923, Isahaya annexed the villages of Isahaya and Kita-Isahaya. On September 1, 1940, it annexed the villages of Oguri, Ono, Yuki, Matsuyama, Motono, and Nagata to form the city of Isahaya.

In July 1957, a severe downpour within Nagasaki caused a large flood in Isahaya, with over 500 casualties and 3500 injuries reported in Isahaya alone (1957 Isahaya floods).

On March 1, 2005, the towns of Tarami, Moriyama, Iimori, Takaki and Konagai (all from Kitatakaki District) were merged to create the new and expanded city of Isahaya.

<text>Floyd Douglas Little (July 4, 1942 – January 1, 2021) was an American professional football player who was a halfback for the Denver Broncos, initially in the American Football League (AFL) and later the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Syracuse Orangemen, twice earning All-American honors. Little was the sixth overall selection of the 1967 NFL/AFL draft, the first common draft. He was the first first-round draft pick to sign with the AFL&#x27;s Broncos, where he was known as &quot;the Franchise&quot;. Little was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Early life==
Little was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 4, 1942. He attended the Hillhouse High School in New Haven and the Bordentown Military Institute in Bordentown, New Jersey.

==College career==
Little was recruited by Gen. Douglas MacArthur to play football at the United States Military Academy and had told him that he&#x27;d ascend to the rank of general if he enrolled at West Point. He was also recruited by the University of Notre Dame. Little ultimately chose to attend Syracuse University at the persuasion of the first African-American Heisman Trophy winner, Ernie Davis. Little is the only three-time All-American running back to have played for the Orange.

Little played for Syracuse for three seasons. In 1964 he made 157 carries for 874 yards and nine touchdowns and 17 catches for 257 yards and 1 touchdown.

==Professional career==
In his rookie year, he was elected a team captain; he would be the last Broncos rookie to do so until Bo Nix in 2024.

In 1975, Little retired as the NFL&#x27;s seventh all-time leading rusher with 6,323 yards rushing and 54 total touchdowns (rushing, receiving and returns). He also threw a touchdown pass to receiver Jerry Simmons in a 1972 upset over the Oakland Raiders. During his rookie year, Little led the NFL in punt returns with a 16.9-yard average. He led the NFL in combined yards in 1967 and 1968. Little was Denver Broncos&#x27; team captain in all of his nine seasons with the team, including his rookie campaign.

Little was a charter member of the Broncos&#x27; Ring of Fame in 1984, which also included; Rich Jackson, Lionel Taylor, and Goose Gonsoulin. He was the first Bronco to win a rushing title, leading the AFC in rushing in 1970 with 901 yards and the following year he became the first Bronco to eclipse 1,000 yards, gaining 1,133 to lead the NFL. Little was the first player to lead his conference in rushing for a last-place team and the 13th player ever in professional football to rush for at least 1,000 yards in one season. He was an American Football League All-Star in 1968. In a week 12 win over Buffalo, he caught four passes out of the backfield for 165 yards, including a 66-yard touchdown, setting a franchise record of 41.25 yards per reception, which still stands. He was named first-team &quot;All-AFL&quot; in 1969, and made the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl in 1970, 1971, and 1973. At 5′10″ and 195 pounds, Little was the smallest back to lead the league in rushing since World War II. He led the league in combined yards in 1967 and 1968 and was the only player to return punts for touchdowns in both seasons. During a six-year period (1968–1973), Little rushed for more yards and more yards from scrimmage (rushing and receiving) than any running back in the NFL.

Little acquired his nickname &quot;the Franchise&quot; because his decision to sign with the AFL&#x27;s Broncos was credited with generating sufficient fan interest to keep the team from relocating in the 1960s, and with helping to convince Denver voters to approve funding for the purchase and expansion of Mile High Stadium.

In 2005, Little was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association&#x27;s third HOVG class.

In 2009, Little was a finalist for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was voted in on February 6, 2010, his induction took place in Canton, Ohio, on August 7, 2010. Little is one of five players in the Super Bowl era to make the Hall of Fame without ever playing a postseason game.

From July 2011 to June 2016, Little served as the special assistant to the athletic director at Syracuse University.

==Awards and honors==

Little&#x27;s jersey number, 44, was retired by the Broncos in 1975 in his honor and by the Syracuse football program on November 12, 2005, to honor Little, Ernie Davis, and Jim Brown, and the eight other players who wore the number. Little was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. He was inducted into the Denver Broncos&#x27; Ring of Fame on October 1, 1984.

On August 7, 2010, Little was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame alongside Jerry Rice, Emmitt Smith, Russ Grimm, Rickey Jackson, John Randle, and Dick LeBeau. On September 15, 2011, the New Haven Athletic Center, billed as the largest scholastic athletics facility in New England, was renamed the Floyd Little Athletic Center. On May 15, 2016, Little received his honorary doctorate from Syracuse University in Humane Letters. On May 17, 2019, Little was awarded the University of Denver&#x27;s Distinguished Alumni Award and on May 18, 2019, Little was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws as speaker at DU&#x27;s Sturm College of Law&#x27;s commencement ceremonies. Syracuse&#x27;s football practice facility has a bronze statue of Little alongside Jim Brown and Ernie Davis.

Little lived with his wife DeBorah in Las Vegas. Little finished 40th in his class of 140 at the University of Denver law school, from which he received his master&#x27;s degree in legal administration degree in 1975. Little owned automobile dealerships in Denver, the Seattle area and Santa Barbara.
In May 2020, his former Syracuse teammate Pat Killorin announced that Little had been fighting cancer.

<text>is a city located in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 28,172, and a population density of 120 people per km2. The total area of the city is 

==Geography==
Hirado City occupies the northern part of Nagasaki Prefecture, the northwestern tip of the Kitamatsuura Peninsula, Hirado Island, which lies to the west of the peninsula across the Hirado Strait, Ikitsuki Island, which lies to the northwest of Hirado Island, Takushima Island, which lies directly north of Hirado Island, and Matoyama-Oshima Island, which lies directly north of Tsushima. It is located about 25 kilometers northwest of Sasebo City and about 80 kilometers north-northwest of Nagasaki City. The Hirado Bridge connects Hirado Island to the Kyushu mainland, and the Ikitsuki Bridge connects Hirado Island to Ikitsuki Island.

The western end of Hirado Island is west of Kōzakihana, the westernmost point of Kyushu, and is the westernmost of all areas that can be traveled between the mainland of Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu) or the mainland of Japan by land transportation alone.

=== Surrounding municipalities ===
Nagasaki Prefecture
* Matsuura
* Sasebo

==Climate==
Hirado has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen:&quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot summers and cool winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is much higher in the summer, although the relatively low latitude and its coastal location the city receives snow in small quantities but enough to &quot;mark&quot; the winter every year despite being in 33 ° N receives intrusions from the Arctic cold of the Siberia air combined with the humidity of the Sea of Japan.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hirado is as shown below:

==History==
Hirado has been a port of call for ships between the East Asian mainland and Japan since the Nara period. During the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, the local Matsuura clan held the rights to trade with Korea and with Song-dynasty China. During the Sengoku and early Edo periods, Hirado&#x27;s role as a center of foreign trade increased, especially &quot;&quot; Ming-dynasty China and the Dutch East India Company (&quot;Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie&quot; or VOC). The Portuguese arrived in Japan in 1543; after the Battle of Fukuda Bay in 1561 the Portuguese stayed for a few more years until they settled in the city of Nagasaki in 1571. The English and Dutch initially reached Japan at the beginning of the 17th century. The first step in the profitable Dutch-Japanese trading relationship was the Shōgun&#x27;s grant of a trading pass (&quot;handelspas&quot;) in 1609. In 1613, the British ship &quot;Clove&quot; arrived in Japan and its Captain John Saris was able to gain the shogunate&#x27;s permission to establish in Hirado a commercial house of the British East India Company. However, the company soon came to consider this outpost to be unprofitable, especially due to their inability to obtain Japanese raw silk for import to China. Therefore, the British closed their factory in 1623, voluntarily leaving the Dutch as the sole European presence.

At its maximum extent, the Dutch trading center covered the whole area of present-day Sakikata Park. In 1637 and in 1639, stone warehouses were constructed, and the Dutch builders incorporated these dates into the stonework. However, the Tokugawa shogunate disapproved of the use of any Christian year dates, and therefore demanded the immediate destruction of these two structures. This failure to comply with strict &quot;sakoku&quot; practices was then used as one of the Shogunate&#x27;s rationales for forcing the Dutch traders to abandon Hirado for the more constricting confines of Dejima, a small artificial island in the present-day city of Nagasaki. The last VOC &quot;Opperhoofd&quot; or &quot;Kapitan&quot; at Hirado and the first one at Dejima was François Caron, who oversaw the transfer in 1641. Modern research indicated this incident might have been an excuse for the Shogunate to take the Dutch trade away from the Hirado clan. The stone warehouse from 1639 that was torn down was reconstructed back to its original form in 2011.
During the Edo period, Hirado was the seat of the Hirado Domain. Hirado Castle is today a historical and architectural landmark.

Following the Meiji restoration, the town of Hirado and the villages of Hirado, Nakano, Shishi, Himosashi, Nakatsura, Tsuyoshi, Shijiki, Tahibira, Minami-Tabira, Ikitsuki and Oshima were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The village and town of Hirado merged on April 1, 1925. Ikitsuki was raised to town status on April 17, 1940. On April 1, 1954 Tabira and Minami-Tabira merged to form the town of Tabira. On January 1, 1955 - Hirado Town, and the villages of Nakano, Shishi, Himosashi, Nakatsura, Tsuyoshi, and Shijiki merged to form the city of Hirado. The city expanded by merging on October 1, 2005, with the neighboring towns of Tabira, Ikitsuki, and the village of Ōshima. The local economy is dominated by agriculture, fishing and food processing.

==Government==
Hirado has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 18 members. Hirado contributes one member to the Nagasaki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Nagasaki 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. The city was previously part of Nagasaki 4th district, which was abolished in 2022.

== Economy ==
The economy of Hirado is heavily dependent on commercial fishing, agriculture and tourism.

==Geography==
Matsuura City is located in the northeastern part of the Kitamatsuura Peninsula in northwestern Nagasaki Prefecture, facing Imari Bay from the Genkai Sea to the north, and bordering Imari City in Saga Prefecture to the east. The inland area to the south of the city is a hilly lava plateau with little flat land. Rivers such as the Sakase River, Tatsuo River, Sasa River, Chokawa River, and Imabuku River flow through the city, and at the mouth of the river is an area of singing sand known as &quot;Gigigahama&quot;.

The administrative area includes the inhabited islands of Fukushima, Takashima, Kuroshima, Tobishima, and Aoshima, in Imari Bay. Of these islands Fukushima is connected to the neighboring Imari City by the Fukushima Ohashi Bridge and Takashima is connected to Karatsu City by the Takashima Hizen Ohashi Bridge. As such, the two islands have strong economic and geographical ties not only with the mainland of Matsuura City, but also with Saga Prefecture. Fukushima and Tsukinokawa are known for their cascading rice terraces.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Matsuura in 2020 is 21,271 people. Matsuura has been conducting censuses since 1920. Matsuura&#x27;s population peaked in 1960, when the population exceeded 60,000, and has since declined slowly; in 2020, the city&#x27;s population is only 50% of what it was in the 1950s.

==History==
Mention of a &quot;Matsuura County&quot; appears in written records from the Heian period, and this area was the home of the Matsura clan, a local warrior clan. Takashima, within the borders of the modern town, is the location where the Mongol invasions of Japan, floundered due to the winds of typhoons in 1274 and 1281, giving rise to the legend of the &quot;kamikaze&quot;. In the Edo period, the area was largely under the control of the Hirado Domain.

The villages of Sasa, Mikuriya, Hoshika, Chokawa, Imabuku, Fukushima, and Takashima were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The discovery of coal in the early Meiji period led to the rapid economic development of the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; however, the coal mines closed in the 1960s. On November 1, 1922 Sasa was raised to town status, followed by Imabuku on April 1, 1929. On January 1, 1941 Mikuriya and Hosika merged to form the town of Shin-Mikuriya. Chokawa was raised to town status on January 1, 1949, followed by Fukushima on January 21, 1951. On March 31, 1955 Sasa, Shin Mikuriya, and Chokawa merged to form the city of Matsuura. On April 15, 1955 Imafuku was annexed by Matsuura. On January 1, 1975 Takashima was raised to town status.

On January 1, 2006, Matsuura absorbed the towns of Fukushima and Takashima (both from Kitamatsuura District) to become the current and expanded city of Matsuura.

==Government==
Matsuura has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 17 members. Matsuura contributes one member to the Nagasaki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Nagasaki 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. The city was previously part of Nagasaki 4th district, which was abolished in 2022.

== Economy ==
In the Meiji period, the area was known for its coal fields; however, by the 1960s the last coal mines had been closed. Matsuura is located in a now primarily rural area, with several industrial companies located near the city center including a steel works, a commercial fish market, and a regional power plant. The amount of catch at Matsuura fish market is about 89,294 tons. (8th place in Japan)
