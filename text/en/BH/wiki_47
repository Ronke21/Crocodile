<text>The rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), also known as the ring-necked parakeet, ringneck parrot (in aviculture) or the Kramer parrot, is a medium-sized parrot in the genus Psittacula, of the family Psittacidae. It has disjunct native ranges in Africa and the Indian subcontinent, and is now introduced into many other parts of the world where feral populations have established themselves or are bred for the exotic pet trade.

One of the few parrot species that have successfully adapted to living in disturbed habitats, it has withstood the onslaught of urbanization and deforestation. As a popular pet species, escaped birds have colonised a number of cities around the world, including populations in Northern and Western Europe. They can live in a variety of climates outside their native range, and are able to survive low winter temperatures in Northern Europe.

The species is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because its population appears to be increasing, but its popularity as a pet and unpopularity with farmers have reduced its numbers in some parts of its native range.

== Taxonomy ==
Four subspecies are recognised, though they differ little:

* African subspecies:
** African rose-ringed parakeet (&quot;P. k. krameri&quot;): West Africa in Guinea, Senegal, and southern Mauritania, east to western Uganda and southern Sudan, north to Egypt. Resident along the Nile Valley and certainly in Giza, it is sometimes seen on the northern coast and in Sinai. The African rose-ringed parakeet also started to breed in Israel and Jordan in the 1980s and is considered an invasive species there.
** Abyssinian rose-ringed parakeet (&quot;P. k. parvirostris&quot;): northwestern Somalia, west across northern Ethiopia to Sennar state, Sudan
* Asian subspecies:
** The Indian rose-ringed parakeet (&quot;P. k. manillensis&quot;) originates from the southern Indian subcontinent and has feral and naturalised populations worldwide, in Australia, Great Britain (mainly around London), the United States, and other Western countries. It is often referred to as the Indian ringneck parrot.
** The boreal rose-ringed parakeet (&quot;P. k. borealis&quot;) is distributed in Bangladesh, Pakistan, northern India and Nepal to central Burma; introduced populations are found worldwide.


The Asian subspecies are both larger than the African subspecies.

The genus name &quot;Psittacula&quot; is a diminutive of Latin &quot;psittacus&quot;, &quot;parrot&quot;, and the specific &quot;krameri&quot; commemorates the German naturalist Wilhelm Heinrich Kramer.

In 2019, a genetic study revived the genus &quot;Alexandrinus&quot;, formerly viewed as a synonym of the current genus &quot;Psittacula&quot;. Some organisations, including the IUCN, have accepted the new taxonomy.

== Description ==
The rose-ringed parakeet is sexually dimorphic. The adult male sports a pink and black neck ring, and the hen and immature birds of both sexes either show no neck rings, or display shadow-like pale to dark grey neck rings. Both sexes have a distinctive green colour in the wild with a red beak and blue tail, and captive bred ringnecks have multiple colour mutations which include turquoise, cinnamon, olive, white, blue, violet, grey and yellow. Rose-ringed parakeets measure on average in length, including the tail feathers, a large portion of their total length. Their average single-wing length is about . In the wild, this is a noisy species with an unmistakable squawking call. Captive individuals can be taught to speak. They are a herbivorous and non-migratory species.

== Distribution ==
Since the 19th century, the rose-ringed parakeet has successfully colonized many other countries. It breeds further north than any other parrot species. It has established itself on a large scale in Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and the UK. See Feral Birds section below.

This shows that the risk of parakeet establishment may rise further as a result of decreasing frost days due to global warming, rising urbanization, and rising human populations. Because of the significant separate parakeet imports in Europe, researchers are capable of investigating the widely held hypothesis of climate matching and human activity at the species level.

== Ecology and behaviour ==

=== Diet ===
In the wild, rose-ringed parakeets usually feed on buds, nectar, fruits, vegetables, nuts, berries, seeds, grains, and insects. Wild flocks also fly several miles to forage in farmlands and orchards, causing extensive damage. Feral parakeets will regularly visit gardens and other locations near human habitation, taking food from bird feeders.

In India, they feed on cereal grains, and during winter also on pigeon peas. In Egypt during the spring, they feed on mulberry and in summer they feed on dates and nest inside palm trees and eat from sunflower and corn fields.

In captivity, rose-ringed parakeets will take a large variety of food and can be fed on a number of fruits, vegetables, pellets, seeds, and even small amounts of cooked meat for protein. Oils, salts, chocolate, alcohol, and other preservatives should be avoided.

=== Reproduction ===
In northwestern India, Indian rose-ringed parakeets form pairs from September to December. They do not have life mates and often breed with another partner during the following breeding season. During this cold season, they select and defend nest sites, thus avoiding competition for sites with other birds. Feeding on winter pea crops provides the female with nutrients necessary for egg production. From April to June, they care for their young. Fledglings are ready to leave the nest before monsoon.

Seasonal changes in testicular activity, plasma luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and 5 α-dihydrotestosterone (5 α-DHT) were related to pair bond formation, nest building, nest defense, and parental behavior in free living Indian rose-ringed parakeets in northwest India. The parakeets are able to reproduce in the winter because it allows them to avoid competing with other birds for nesting places, postpone having young during the monsoon season, and take use of the winter pea harvest, which provides the female with extra nutrients for egg formation.

== Aviculture ==
Rose-ringed parakeets are popular as pets and they have a long history in aviculture. The ancient Greeks kept the Indian subspecies &quot;P. krameri manillensis&quot;, and the ancient Romans kept the African subspecies &quot;P. krameri krameri&quot;. Colour mutations of the Indian rose-ringed parakeet subspecies have become widely available in recent years. A blue colour morph mutation of the rose-ringed parakeet is also commonly kept in aviculture. Birds that display this mutation have solid light blue feathers instead of green.

=== Mimicry ===
Both males and females have the ability to mimic human speech. First, the bird listens to its surroundings, and then it copies the voice of the human speaker. Some people hand-raise rose-ringed parakeet chicks for this purpose. Such parakeets then become quite tame and receptive to learning. They have extremely clear speech and are one of the best talking parrots.

== Feral birds ==

A popular pet, the rose-ringed parakeet has been released in a wide range of cities around the world, giving it an environment with few predators where their preferred diet of seeds, nuts, fruits, and berries is available from suburban gardens and bird feeders. 

Feral populations are established in Europe, the U.S., South Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Japan. There are stable populations in Florida, California and Hawaii. Self-sustaining populations are also found in Turkey, mostly in Ankara, İzmir, Istanbul (concentrated in parks), Tunis, Tripoli and Tehran (concentrated in the north side of the city). It is also found throughout Lebanon, Israel, Iran, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman. A small number of escaped birds are present in Australia.

The specimens in these naturalised populations often represent intra-specific hybrids, originally between varying numbers (according to locality) of the subspecies &quot;manillensis&quot;, &quot;borealis&quot;, and/or (to a lesser extent) &quot;krameri&quot;, along with some inter-specific hybrids with naturalised &quot;Psittacula eupatria&quot; (the Alexandrine parakeet).

Where introduced, rose-ringed parakeets may affect native biodiversity and human economy and wellness.

=== Europe ===
Its adaptations to cold winters in the Himalayan foothills allow it to easily withstand European winter conditions. The European populations became established during the mid-to-late 20th century. 

A Europe-wide count was held in 2015 and found 85,220 rose-ringed parakeets in 10 European countries.

Rose-ringed parakeets are seen as a direct threat to populations of Europe&#x27;s largest bat, the greater noctule, as parakeets compete with the bats for nesting sites, and will attack and kill adults before colonising their habitat.

==== Great Britain ====
There is a burgeoning population of feral parakeets in Great Britain which is centred on suburban London and the Home Counties of South-East England. Parakeet numbers have been highest in the south-west of London, although the population has since spread rapidly, and large flocks of birds can be observed in places such as Crystal Palace Park, Battersea Park, Buckhurst Hill, Richmond Park, Wimbledon Common, Greenwich Park, and Hampstead Heath, as well as Surrey and Berkshire. Feral parakeets have also been observed in Abbey Wood, Bostall Heath, Bostall Woods and Plumstead Common. The winter of 2006 had three separate roosts of about 6000 birds around London. They have also established themselves in Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, and Regent&#x27;s Park. A smaller population occurs around Margate, Broadstairs and Ramsgate, Kent. There is also an established population to the North East of London in Essex at Loughton and Theydon Bois by Epping Forest. Elsewhere in Britain, smaller feral populations have become established from time to time throughout the Midlands, Northern England and even as far north as Edinburgh. It has been suggested that feral parrots could endanger populations of native British birds, and that the rose-ringed parakeet should be culled as a result, although this is not currently recommended by conservation organisations. A major agricultural pest in locations such as India, as of 2011 the rose-ringed parakeet population was growing rapidly, but is generally limited to urban areas in southern England. 

In the United Kingdom and especially within London, parakeets face predation by native birds of prey and owls, including the peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), Eurasian hobby (&quot;F. subbuteo&quot;) and tawny owl (&quot;Strix aluco&quot;).

==== Benelux ====
In the Netherlands, the feral population in the four largest urban areas (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht and The Hague) was estimated at 20,000 birds in 2021, double the number of birds estimated in 2010. There also exists a feral population in Belgium, with as many as 5,000 pairs estimated in Brussels. These originate from an original population that was set free in 1974 by the owner of the Meli Zoo and Attraction Park near the Atomium who wanted to make Brussels more colourful.

==== Germany ====
In Germany, these birds are found along the Rhine in all major urban areas such as Bonn, Cologne, Düsseldorf (about 800 birds), Frankenthal, Heidelberg, Ladenburg, Ludwigshafen, Mainz, Mannheim, Speyer, Wiesbaden, Worms and Zweibrücken. 

==== France ====
Large populations in France are found especially in and around Paris but also in other places.

==== Italy ==== 
In Italy, Rome is notable for parakeet populations in the gardens of the Palatine Hill, the trees of Trastevere and Janiculum and at Villa Borghese. There are also colonies in Orto Botanico di Palermo in Palermo and in the city of Genoa.

==== Spain ====
In Spain there are populations in Barcelona.

==== Portugal ====
There are breeding population in Lisbon and on Madeira Island.

==== Turkey ====
In Turkey, there are populations in Istanbul over 1000 parakeets and also in İzmir, Manisa, Muğla, Balıkesir, Ankara, Antalya totally over 5,000.

=== Japan ===
There is a feral population of the birds in Japan. In the 1960s many Japanese people became pet owners for the first time and the parakeet was widely imported as a pet. Some escaped or were released and formed populations around the country. By the 1980s groups could be found in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Niigata and Kyushu. Some groups since died out, but as of 2009 there was a large population residing at the Tokyo Institute of Technology&#x27;s main campus at Ookayama, along with small groups in Maebashi and Chiba city.

=== New Zealand ===
Feral rose-ringed parakeets have sporadically been observed around New Zealand, and are treated as a major potential threat to the country&#x27;s native bird populations due to their potential to outcompete native parakeet species, and introduce diseases.
== Aggression toward other animals ==
In the &quot;María Luisa Park&quot; in Seville, the population of the greater noctule bat declined sharply when the population of rose-ringed parakeets increased 20-fold. The rose-ringed parakeets attacked the greater noctule at tree cavities and occupied most of the cavities previously used by the bats. The attacks by the rose-ringed parakeets often led to the death of the greater noctule. In 14 years, the number of tree cavities occupied by the greater noctule decreased by 81%. A spatial analysis of tree cavity use showed that the greater noctule tried to avoid cavities near parakeets. In the Rhineland, conspicuous bite wounds have been found in bats caught near rose-ringed parakeet nesting cavities. More detailed studies in the Rhineland on this are missing so far. Several authors have reported negative behaviors of the ring-necked parakeet near their nest sites: lethal attacks on a Leisler&#x27;s bat (&quot;Nyctalus leisleri&quot;) in Italy (Menchetti et al. 2014), on black rats (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;) in Spain (Hernández-Brito et al. 2014b) and on several competitor and predator species in Spain (Hernández-Brito et al. 2014a). In the Paris area in France, an attack by a ring-necked parakeet on an adult red squirrel (&quot;Sciurus vulgaris&quot;) has been reported (Clergeau et al. 2009).

<text>Social change is the alteration of the social order of a society which may include changes in social institutions, social behaviours or social relations. Sustained at a larger scale, it may lead to social transformation or societal transformation.

== Definition ==
Social change may not refer to the notion of social progress or sociocultural evolution, the philosophical idea that society moves forward by evolutionary means. It may refer to a paradigmatic change in the socio-economic structure, for instance the transition from feudalism to capitalism, or hypothetical future transition to some form of post-capitalism.

Social development is the people that develop social and emotional skills across the lifespan, with particular attention to childhood and adolescence. Healthy social development allows us to form positive relationships with family, friends, teachers, and other people in our lives.

Accordingly, it may also refer to social revolution, such as the Socialist revolution presented in Marxism, or to other social movements, such as women&#x27;s suffrage or the civil rights movement. Social change may be driven through cultural, religious, economic, environmental, scientific or technological forces.

== Prominent theories ==
Change arises from two primary sources: unique factors, such as climate, weather, or the presence of specific groups of people, and systematic factors. For example, successful development generally has the same requirements, such as a stable and flexible government, enough free and available resources, and a diverse social organization of society. On the whole, social change is usually a combination of systematic factors along with some random or unique factors.

Many theories attempt to explain social change. One view suggests that a theory of change should include elements such as structural aspects of change (like population shifts), processes and mechanisms of social change, and directions of change.
*Christian: In Christianity &amp; Judaism social change is seen in terms of God&#x27;s blessings on faithfulness or curses on disobedience. See Deuteronomy chapter 28. 
* Hegelian: The classic Hegelian dialectic model of change is based on the interaction of opposing forces. Starting from a point of momentary stasis, &quot;Thesis&quot; countered by &quot;Antithesis &quot;first yields conflict, then it subsequently results in a new &quot;Synthesis&quot;.
* Marxist: Marxism presents a dialectical and materialist concept of history, seeing humankind&#x27;s history as a fundamental &quot;struggle between social classes&quot;.
* Kuhnian: The philosopher of science, Thomas Kuhn argues in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; with respect to the Copernican Revolution that people are likely to continue utilizing an apparently unworkable paradigm until a better paradigm is commonly accepted. A Kuhnian approach to the study of societies is provided by the critical juncture approach to social order and change.
* Heraclitan: The Greek philosopher Heraclitus used the metaphor of a river to speak of change thus: &quot;On those stepping into rivers staying the same other and other waters flow&quot; (DK22B12). What Heraclitus seems to be suggesting here, later interpretations notwithstanding, is that, in order for the river to remain the river, change must constantly be taking place. Thus one may think of the Heraclitan model as parallel to that of a living organism, which, in order to remain alive, must constantly change. A contemporary application of this approach is shown in the social-change theory SEED-SCALE which builds off of the complexity theory subfield of emergence.
* Daoist: The Chinese philosophical work &quot;Dao De Jing&quot;, I.8 and II.78 uses the metaphor of water as the ideal agent of change. Water, although soft and yielding, will eventually wear away stone. Change, in this model, is to be natural, harmonious and steady, albeit imperceptible.

== Types of change ==
Social changes can vary according to speed and scope and impetus.
Some research on the various types of social change focuses on social organizations such as corporations.

Different manifestations of change include:

* Fabian change – gradual and reformist incremental amelioration after the manner of the Fabian Society
* radical change – improvements root and branch in the style of political radicalism
* revolutionary change – abrupt, radical and drastic change, with implications of violence and of starting afresh (perhaps most popular as a political bogeyman)
* transformational change – a New-age version of radical change, and thus difficult to define
* continuous change, open-ended change – change (allegedly) for the sake of change
* top-down change – reliance on leadership
* bottom-up change – reliance on the huddled masses
* socio-tectonic change – postulated deep-seated fundamental social shifts

== Current examples ==
=== Global demographic shifts ===
One of the most obvious changes currently occurring is the change in the relative global population distribution between countries. In recent decades, developing countries have become a larger proportion of the world population, increasing from 68% in 1950 to 82% in 2010, and the population of the developed countries has declined from 32% of the total world population in 1950 to 18% in 2010. China and India continue to be the largest countries, followed by the US as a distant third.

However, population growth throughout the world is slowing. Population growth among developed countries has been slowing since the 1950s and is now at 0.3% annual growth. Population growth among the less developed countries excluding the least developed ones has also been slowing since 1960 and is now at 1.3% annually. Population growth among the least developed countries has slowed relatively little; as of 2022, the annual growth rate is 2.33%.

=== Gendered patterns of work and care ===
In much of the developed world, changes from distinct men&#x27;s work and women&#x27;s work to more gender equal patterns have been economically important since the mid-20th century. Both men and women are considered to be great contributors to social change worldwide.

<text>A lifeguard is a rescuer who supervises the safety and rescue of swimmers, surfers, and other water sports participants such as in a swimming pool, water park, beach, spa, river and lake. Lifeguards are trained in swimming and CPR/AED first aid, certified in water rescue using a variety of aids and equipment depending on requirements of their particular venue. In some areas, lifeguards are part of the emergency services system to incidents and in some communities, lifeguards may function as the primary EMS provider.

==Responsibilities==
A lifeguard is responsible for the safety of people in an area of water, and usually a defined area immediately surrounding or adjacent to it, such as a beach next to an ocean or lake. The priority is to ensure no harm comes to users of the area for which they are responsible. Lifeguards often take on this responsibility upon employment, However, there may also be volunteer lifeguards.

The conditions resulting in drowning are summarized by the &#x27;drowning chain&#x27; in which each link can lead directly to an incident, or contribute to a succession of links. It consists of lack of education about water safety or local conditions, a lack of safety advice (for example, about rip currents at a beach) a lack of protection (like no flotation device for a weak swimmer), lack of safety supervision, or an inability to cope with conditions (strong surf with a weak swimmer). 
The drowning chain provides a clear basis for preventing drowning which includes:
* education and information
* provision of warnings
* denial of access
* supervision
* training in survival skills

The lifeguard is able to provide all these elements to help prevent drownings (or other incidents) in their area of responsibility, and for this reason this should be the primary focus of a lifeguard&#x27;s activities, as it is better to stop an incident from occurring rather than reacting once it has occurred. This means that the effectiveness of a lifeguard unit can be measured not by the number or rapidity of rescues, or the skill with which they are executed, but by the absence or reduction of drownings, accidents, and other medical emergencies. Prevention is an effective skill that is vitally important to a lifeguard because it can aid in maintaining the safety of the aquatic patrons.

==Duties==

A lifeguard&#x27;s key duties (usually as part of a team, but in some places, lifeguards may be required to work on their own) are to: 
*Enforce rules to prevent problems/injuries
*Maintain concentrated observation of the duty area and its users in to anticipate problems (this will enable the lifeguard to intervene with one of the drowning prevention measures) and to identify an emergency quickly.
*Supervise the use of other equipment when allocated to that duty (such as water slides or any other activities taking place)
*Effect rescues and initiate other emergency action as necessary
*Give immediate first aid in the event of injury to a bather or other incident
*Communicate with bathers and other users to fulfill the above tasks
*Help clean areas around pool or beach to ensure the safety of patrons

Lifeguards may have other secondary duties such as cleaning, filing paperwork, checking a swimming pool&#x27;s chlorine and pH levels, or acting as a general information point. It is important that lifeguards never allow their secondary responsibilities to interfere with their primary responsibilities.

Lifeguards may also be required to attend occasional in-service meetings to discuss strategy, patron safety and water skills.

The California State Lifeguards, a division of the California State Parks Peace Officer department, perform law enforcement duties in addition to regular lifeguard tasks.

== Training ==

Every lifeguard has to undergo a certification course in order to be able to work as a lifeguard. Certain certification companies, such as the Red Cross or Ellis and Associates, are in charge of the certification process. Certification usually lasts for 1–2 years, but can last up to 5. Classes last 25–30 hours and will generally be held over a few days, with the hours per day varying depending on the number of days needed. At the end of the certification class, lifeguards are required to take a final exam, and will only receive a certificate if they pass the final exam. Lifeguards are then required to do additional training throughout the duration of their certification at the discretion of the facility they work for.

Most skills taught in various lifeguard certification classes are similar or the same, but some skills may vary minorly based on the certification company. Additionally, different in-water skills will be taught depending on the facility certifying the lifeguard, i.e., shallow/deep water pools, water parks, beaches, etc.

Training equipment required in certification classes include:

* Rescue tubes
* Backboards
* CPR mannequins
* Resuscitation masks
* Bag-valve masks
* Disposable gloves
* AED Trainer
* First aid supplies

Some of the various out-of-water skills taught are:
* Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)A series of chest compressions and ventilations that try to circulate blood containing oxygen throughout the body to vital organs in an attempt to resuscitate a victim.
* First aidThe lifeguard in training should know how to protect themselves from blood borne pathogens. Lifeguards should protect themselves at all times when performing first aid.
* Emergency oxygen administrationProvides emergency oxygen therapy for victims with breathing and cardiac emergencies. 
* In-line stabilizationA technique used for suspected spinal injuries both in and out of the water that uses the arms to stabilize the head and prevent further movement that could worsen the head, neck, or spinal injury.
* Active and unconscious chokingActive choking measures make use of back blows and abdominal thrusts to try to force out the object blocking the victim&#x27;s airway; Unconscious choking measures are similar to CPR with a few small changes.
* Various first aid skillsUsed to treat various injuries and sudden illnesses that can occur.
* Legal Issueslifeguards must learn how to legally care for guests and/or guests in distress, otherwise they may be a liability. The certification process and further trainings will instruct lifeguards on the legal facets of lifeguarding: duty to care, standard of care, negligence, consent, refusal of care, abandonment, confidentiality, and documentation.
* Emergency Action Planseach facility will have an established protocol in the event of an emergency. The details of this protocol are decided by the facility.
Some of the various in-water skills taught are:
* Active-victim rescueAn active victim rescue is designed to quickly remove and calm a victim from the water. Depending on whether the victim is facing towards or facing away from the rescuer, the rescue will change.
* Active-victim front rescueA common rescue, when a victim is facing the rescuer, is to straighten the arms and push the victim to the side of the pool. The space the straightened arms give between the rescuer and the victim will prevent a victim from latching on to the rescuer. When approaching an active drowning victim from the rear, a common save is to perform a &#x27;hooking&#x27; maneuver, where rescuers hook their arms under the victim&#x27;s arm pits and begin extraction.
* Passive-victim rescueSaving and removing a victim who is passive (or not moving) in the water; There are variations for both shallow and deep water
* Spinal rescueA rescue that assumes a victim has a head, neck, or spinal injury and uses more appropriate measures to ensure that no unnecessary movement creates further harm to the victim. There are variations for both shallow and deep water.

=== Prerequisites ===
Most lifeguard certification companies require potential lifeguards to demonstrate strong swimming skills prior to the certification process. These prerequisites will usually include a mid-distance swim, a timed water tread, and diving for a weighted brick at the bottom of the pool.

=== Ongoing Trainings ===
Many aquatic facilities will have their lifeguards undergo additional Lifeguard Training Classes for the duration of their certification. The nature and frequency of these additional training depends on the aquatic facility and the certification company the aquatic facility follows. For example, a beach facility may practice beachfront saves and search-and-rescue scenarios, where an indoor pool facility whose lifeguards are responsible for the whole building may practice scenarios that simulate emergencies in different parts of the building. These in-service trainings are meant to serve as practice in order to maintain and develop skills taught during the certification process. Examples of these trainings include First Aid/CPR/AED skill review and Aquatic Emergency Action Plan Drills.

Additionally, some certification companies outside of the facility may audit or examine lifeguards during their rotations. These visits are meant to serve as both a test of preparedness and also as a learning experience and a chance to improve on weaker skills. Visits are generally unannounced and may include videoing of on-duty lifeguards, skills evaluations involving a scenario meant to model real life, and vigilance awareness testing.

Lifeguards also must be recertified regularly, as lifeguard certifications expire after some time.

== Water entries ==
There are four main types of water entries:

* Slide-in is the slowest of the four entries. This technique is used when a victim has a suspected head, neck, or spinal injury.
* Stride jump should only be used in water depth of five feet or more and the lifeguard should be no higher than three feet above ground.
* Compact jump can be used from the side of the pool or from the lifeguard chair. The pool depth should be at least five feet if jumping from an elevated position.
* Run-and-swim is used in shallow waters that go from zero-depth to at least three feet.

These entries are used in different scenarios depending on if the victim is passive, or conscious, whether they are in deep or shallow water, and if they have a potential head, neck or spinal injury.

==Identifying types of swimmer==

While performing patron surveillance (usually from an elevated stand or a water-level standing or sitting position) lifeguards watch for and recognize struggling or drowning swimmers, and swimmers with sudden medical conditions such as a stroke, heart attack, asthma, diabetes, or seizures. Lifeguards look for swimmers in various categories and conditions:
#Passive drowning person are inactive in the water, submerged or otherwise. When a lifeguard sees this kind of swimmer they perform an emergency rescue.
# Active drowning person are taking in water while attempting to stay at the surface. Common signs lifeguards look for include looking for arms moving or flapping laterally (in an effort to press down on the water and leverage the head above the water&#x27;s surface), not necessarily flailing, with the body vertical, no supporting kick, and no forwards progress. This behavior is known as the instinctive drowning response. Lifeguards perform an emergency rescue to assist this kind of swimmer as their behavior results from being incapable of more active efforts to survive. They may be less than 60 seconds from sinking underwater.
# Distressed swimmers are having trouble swimming, perhaps from fatigue, and may or may not be calling out for help. Lifeguards usually swim out and help these swimmers to the side. They may or may not require additional assistance.
# Normal swimmers (Healthy swimmers) are those who do not need any support and can swim on their own doing intermediate strokes (swimming standards).

==Locations==
Lifeguards can be found patrolling many different types of water, and each type has its own unique features, duties and challenges. Locations where lifeguards can be found include:
*Ocean beach – Lifeguards are commonly associated with beaches on the seashore, and this is often considered the most challenging environment to lifeguard due to the influence of external factors such as weather, currents, tides and waves. Lifeguards have to be in peak physical condition in order to accommodate these conditions. Lifeguards are required to complete additional training to be able to service ocean beach areas.
*Inland body of water (Waterfront) – Lifeguards can also look after open water areas such as rivers, or even lakes or ponds where swimmers may congregate.
*Swimming pool – Swimming pools of various sizes are oftentimes monitored by lifeguards, however some pools may not require monitoring as due to the size of the pool, or the patron attendance being too low. A sign indicating that &quot;Lifeguard not on duty&quot; will be present in this case.
**Water park – Whilst water parks are a type of swimming pool, they can be considered a unique type of facility as they may involve additional features such as water slides or wave generators, or shallow pool play areas
**Ocean lagoon or tidal pool – These enclosed areas use seawater, but like a pool have a limited and contained area, but have the potential for additional hazards above and beyond an artificial pool
** Waterfront – Lifeguards can look after in a non-surf, open-water areas such as lakes, rivers, streams, and lagoons that are found at public parks, resorts, summer camps and campgrounds. 
*Open ocean – In some cases, people may swim in the open ocean from a boat (such as a cruise ship) and lifeguards may be employed for safety in this instance.
==Positioning==

Lifeguards have a primary duty to supervise their responsibility area. To achieve this the lifeguard needs an optimum position to observe the public. This is often best achieved from an elevated position, which can be a chair, platform or the roof of a vehicle. This allows them maximum visibility over their supervised area and may facilitate communication between them and their team.

Some lifeguard teams use portable platforms or chairs which can be moved to the most appropriate position. This can take account of changes such as a specific activity taking place, prevailing wind direction or simply enable lifeguards to move closer to the water if the tide goes out on a beach.

The chair or tower can also act as storage for the lifeguard, holding important rescue and communication equipment nearby. It can also act as a recognizable point for the public to find lifeguard assistance. For this reason, it is often marked with a flag or flags to enable location by the public. These flags may also give information to the bathers about current swimming conditions.

Other options, depending on the location, can include patrolling the edge of the water on foot, which allows closer interaction with the public, and the opportunity to provide face to face reassurance and advice, or supervising from within or on the water, which is most applicable in open water (such as the sea or even a large water park) where lifeguards can use boats or other personal watercraft to be in the water, which extends their range and may allow quicker response to emergencies.

=== 10/20 Protection Standard ===
The 10/20 Protection Standard is a technique developed by safety consultants Jeff Ellis and Associates, and taught to lifeguards on many courses including the United Kingdom National Pool Lifeguard Qualification.

The standard requires scanning from one side of the pool to the other, or the designated area, in 10 seconds, with the lifeguard no further than 20 seconds away from any swimmer in difficulty in the lifeguard&#x27;s area.

== Flags ==


In most countries, lifeguards use similar flag signs to signal swimmers their presence, specific areas and possible dangers:
==Equipment==

Equipment used by lifeguards will vary depending on the location and specific conditions encountered. Certain equipment is relatively universal such as a whistle for attracting the attention of the public or other members of the team, a first aid kit and rescue aids. Other equipment includes, but is not limited to, rescue cans, rescue tubes, rescue boards, spinal boards, AEDs, trauma bags, and oxygen.

===Rescue aids===
There is a hierarchy of rescue techniques which minimizes danger to lifeguards and maximizes the effectiveness of a rescue, and this dictates the types of rescue aids that a lifeguard should have available. Lifeguards are supposed to have some equipment to aid rescues. After determining a swimmer is in trouble they try to help in ways that will not result in a threat to the life of the lifeguard or others. This is done by helping at a distance by using a pole; a lifebuoy may be thrown, wading to the victim, using available watercraft, swim with an aid, such as a rescue buoy. As a last resort, direct swimming to the apparent victim.

In addition to these basic lifeguarding techniques, some units are trained in additional water rescue techniques such as scuba diving and swift water training, or in rescue techniques unrelated to water rescue such as abseiling for cliff rescue and bike patrol training, and they will carry appropriate equipment for these.

===First aid===
Lifeguards are proficient in first aid and have a well-stocked first aid kit available. They may have advanced first aid items such as supplemental oxygen, airway management devices, a suction device, a resuscitator, a defibrillator or AED, or a spinal board. Lifeguards are trained to contact EMS personnel immediately. If a drowning victim has been rescued the victim might need EMS attention or extensive medical treatment.

California public sector lifeguards are trained in a more extensive advanced first aid that is known as Title 22 First Aid For Public Safety Personnel.

Some lifeguards are crossed trained as emergency medical technicians as a part of their emergency services system.

In certain jurisdictions, lifeguards may use airway adjuncts such as nasopharyngeal airways and oropharyngeal airways.

===Rescue watercraft===

Lifeguards will sometimes use rescue watercraft to rescue victims that are either far away or when there is large surf, i.e. big waves. Types of rescue watercraft:

* Inflatable Rescue Boats (IRBs)These inflatable boats are useful when patrolling a beach especially ocean surf beaches where either the surf is too powerful or the beach too large to perform rescues effectively on a board.
*Row Rescue BoatsBest used in calmer water, wood paddle boats are used to patrol swimmers and for quick entry into the water when a drowning is happening at further distance. These are maneuvered and propelled by human power, so they require a lot of practice. Each boat has a larger wooden bench that allows lifeguards to perform CPR while heading back to shore, if needed. 
* Rescue Water Craft (RWC)Also known as personal watercraft, are useful for their faster top speeds and maneuverability in ocean surf conditions.

===Communications===
Effective communications are vital for lifeguards and they may choose to use whistles, two-way radios, megaphones or signal flares.

A more traditional method of communication with the public is through the use of colored flags, which can be raised over permanent or temporary flag poles to inform the public of different information.

More often than not a whistle is used in the pool leisure facility (public and private), the following signals are used by some lifeguards with a whistle (It is always important to remember that each facility may have their own standards and procedures for their whistle protocol).

*1 short blast – used to gain the attention of a swimmer.
*2 short blasts – used to gain the attention of fellow lifeguards (including managers/head lifeguards)
*3 short blasts – used to signal that a lifeguard is activating their EAP and taking action in their area.
*1 long blast – (swimming pools) used to clear the pool
*1 long blast – used to signal to a fellow lifeguard that you are jumping in for an active save.
*2 long blasts – used to signal to swimmers that they must clear the pool, this could be because the pool is closed or an emergency is taking place significant enough for the lifeguards to clear the pool.

===Transportation===

For duty areas over a wide area, such as beaches and lakes, lifeguards may require transport over distance and they may use land transport including pick-up trucks, quad bikes, gators, or other off-road vehicle.

They may also use larger water craft such as a large rigid or inflatable boats, personal water crafts, or hovercraft.

==By country==
===Australia===

In Australia lifeguards are distinguished from surf life savers. Lifeguards are paid employees who patrol beaches, lakes and pools/aquatic venues. Beach lifeguards are usually employed by local government authorities and patrol the beach throughout the year. Surf Lifesavers are a large voluntary organization that patrol beaches on weekends and public holidays during the warmer months (usually from mid-September to late April) and also perform public training of kids, the nippers, as well as competitions, such as surf carnivals or winter swimming events.

===Belgium===
Belgium has a coastline with a length of . The coast is urbanised over practically its entire length and is visited by thousands of tourists each year. In 1982 a lifeguard service has been built up to minimize the death by drowning at the Belgian coast. Because the North Sea only borders Flanders, more particularly the province of West Flanders, the training of the lifeguards is organised by that province. Beach lifeguards in Belgium are trained by the WOBRA and are mostly students who are employed for a month during the summer holidays (July and August). Some municipalities also employ lifeguards in June and September. To obtain uniformity, all municipalities from the Belgian coast joined the IKWV This is the coordinating organisation for all the municipalities for lifeguard service. The organisation of IKWV has made the Belgian coastline one of the safest coastlines of the world in a couple decades.

===Brazil===

In Brazil, firefighting services, accident assistance, and the rescue of people drowning on beaches, rivers, and lakes are maintained by each state&#x27;s fire department. The rescue of drowning people in private places is the responsibility of the owner of the place. Like the military police, responsible for ostensive policing, the members of the fire departments are also considered military, including lifeguards. The state military police and state fire departments are auxiliary institutions and reserves of the Brazilian Army. Considering the service provided by fire departments insufficient, some Brazilian cities have their own lifeguard services, but most Brazilian lifeguards are members of fire departments.

===Canada===

In Canada, all lifeguards and assistant lifeguards are certified by the Lifesaving Society of Canada. The lifeguarding certification offered by the LSS is the National Lifeguard program, which was officially launched in 1964. There are four types of lifeguard certification: pool, waterpark, waterfront and surf.

As of December 31, 2022, the Canadian Red Cross Lifeguard and Learn to Swim programs were retired. Canadian Red Cross wanted to focus their efforts on humanitarian relief.

=== Denmark ===
In Denmark the lifeguard-services are divided into two major groups. The beach lifeguards, which are established on a voluntarily basis by the beach administrators (in most cases the municipality). There are three main lifeguard service providers, one heavily sponsored: TrygFonden Kystlivredning, which is backed by TrygFonden (Danish Foundation) while Den Nordsjællandske Kystlivredningstjeneste are sponsored by the councils at the Zealand Northshore. In Copenhagen there is Team Bade lifeguard service, run by Copenhagen Municipality. All public pools (both commercial and government) are required to &quot;provide a secure and safe environment&quot; and thus lifeguards. Unlike the beach lifeguards, these have to pass a government approved test as well as a yearly a physical examination and first aid test.

===Germany===

In Germany three major organizations exist that train people in swimming, lifesaving and which maintain lifeguard services at public beaches, lakes etc. All three are mainly based on volunteer work. The DLRG (Deutsche Lebens-Rettungs-Gesellschaft – German Life Saving Society) is the largest aquatic lifeguard organization in the world with more than 1,000,000 members and promoters. The Wasserwacht (&quot;water watch&quot;) is a division of the German Red Cross. Third is the &quot;Wasserrettungsdienst&quot; of the Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Deutschland. Also the Fire Departments will maintain lifeguard services at rivers, coasts and lakes. In Germany, anyone who wants to be a ILS Pool Lifeguard equivalent requires the following certification: &#x27;Rettungsschwimmer Silber&#x27; (DRSA Silber)
In order to attain this, they have to demonstrate various practical and theoretical skills, e.g. 25m distance diving, three deep dives to 3-5m depth retrieving 5kg brick, 300m swimming in clothing in 12 minutes, rescue exercises, and various other skills. The training is considered more demanding than in many other countries.

===India===
In India the longest coast manned by lifeguards is Goa&#x27;s 105 km shoreline. Drishti Marine holds government contracts with a body of 710 professionally trained lifeguards across Goa and Mumbai. They have 5000+ rescues on record since starting operations in 2008. The lifeguards are trained by Special Rescue Training Academy (SRTA) and enlisted as government first response for emergency services such as flood rescue. The lifeguards in Goa are also trained in stranded marine mammal rescue as part of Ocean Watch a collaborative effort between Drishti Marine, Terra Conscious, Goa Forest Department and IUCN India. They conduct regular interventions for turtles and dolphins caught in ghost nets.

In October 2018 Drishti lifeguards were water safety partners for India&#x27;s first Ironman held in Miramar Goa.

===Iran===
In Iran, the lifesaving organization is the &quot;Iran lifesaving organization.&quot; It has an areas roughly equal to that of the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Germany combined, or somewhat more than the US state of Alaska. Iran has a coastline to the Caspian Sea to the north, and the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman to the south.

===Ireland===

In Ireland, the statutory body established to promote water safety is &quot;Irish Water Safety&quot; who train and award lifeguards with the National Pool Lifeguard Award, the National Beach Lifeguard Award and the Inland Open Water Lifeguard Award.

In addition in Ireland the Royal Lifesaving Society (RLSS), through independent trainer assessors / clubs, trains and qualifies lifeguards with the National Pool Lifeguard Qualification (NPLQ) and the National Beach Lifeguard Qualification (NBLQ).

===Italy===
In Italy, Lifeguards are certified by the Italian Swimming Federation the National Lifesaving Society and the Italian Water Rescue Federation. The Italian Swimming Federation&#x27;s diploma is recognized abroad by the country affiliated to ILS whilst the National Lifesaving Society is active member and internationally recognized by the International Maritime Rescue Federation. Differences exist between pool, lakes and sea diplomas. Also Italian Red Cross has a special branch called OPSA (Polyvalent Water Rescue Operators) that has some lifeguards duties in some parts of Italy.
Lifeguards in Italy are not organised in a unique service: every venue has its own Lifeguards, depending on licenses, danger and requests. Public beaches are not patrolled by an organisation, but each comune calls on duty freelance lifeguards during summer or particular events, when public funds can afford the costs. In some beaches, where there hotels or other structures have licenses, there is the obligation to have lifeguards, that are paid by the structure itself.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand the term lifeguard generally refers to swimming pool lifeguards but can be used interchangeably with lifesaver. These are qualified paid professionals employed by the pool management to watch over pool users. Surf Life Saving New Zealand (SLSNZ) is responsible for training and maintaining coastal Surf Lifesaving in New Zealand. Surf Lifesavers patrol various beaches in New Zealand. Lifesavers are able to sit their Bronze Medallion which qualifies them as a volunteer Surf Lifeguards. Volunteers patrol New Zealand&#x27;s beaches on weekends over the summer months from Labour Day to around Easter. Paid Lifeguards patrol beaches during the week over the busiest summer months. They also come under the control of SLSNZ.

===Netherlands===

The KNBRD or Reddingsbrigade is the Dutch lifeguard association. The Netherlands has more than 200 units on the Dutch beaches, and over 5000 active volunteers. The lifeguards secure the Dutch coastline and also many cities that have a lot of swimming water, like lakes. They also provide training. The KNBRD wears the international clothing style which is yellow/red. The KNBRD works together with the KNRM. Additionally, many local rescue teams have one or more disaster units which can be called in case of major flooding anywhere in the country.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, the lifeguard service is coordinated by the Portuguese Lifeguard Institute (ISN). Under the technical tutelage of the ISN, several organizations provide lifeguard services in the Portuguese maritime and river beaches. The entities that have a concession to explore a beach are obliged to contract a lifeguard service to be provided in the respective concession area. In the cases of beaches that are not under concession, the contracting and providing of lifeguard services is usually done by the local municipalities. The ISN is responsible for the establishment of standards for the training, equipment and uniforms of the lifeguards.

===Singapore===
In Singapore the lifesaving organization is the Singapore Lifesaving Society(SLSS) which is responsible for administering lifesaving awards. Lifeguards have to earn their Lifesaving 1, 2 and 3 awards before they are allowed to move on to Bronze Medallion which is the minimum requirement for employment in most Singapore pools.

===Spain===
In Spain there are many organizations that teach and train people in lifesaving. The International Lifeguard Society and Royal Spanish Rescue and Lifesaving Federation are a couple of the prominent organizations.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland the lifesaving organization is the Swiss Lifesaving Society.

===South Africa===

Lifeguards in South Africa are certified through Lifesaving South Africa, a regulatory body. All Lifesaving Award (LA) trainees are thoroughly trained in surf rescue with pool and open water training being incorporated into the LA course. Once a year, Lifesaving SA holds an annual retest for all LA certified Lifeguards. If this retest is not completed or is failed three years consecutively the LA certification lapses. In the event of the LA certification lapsing the lifeguard will have to redo the LA course in its entirety.

Common equipment used by lifeguards in rescue situations are: Rigid torpedo buoys, soft torpedo buoys, rescue craft (malibu boards), paddle skis, box line, throw line and spinal boards.
Common equipment used by Lifeguards in first aid situations are: Saline solution, bandages, antiseptics, antihistamines, oxygen kits, latex gloves, laerdal pocket masks, splints, rescue blankets and first aid kits.

Beaches in South Africa are contracted out to independent or private companies. These companies submit tenders, on an annual basis, to local municipalities/government. 
Lifeguards who are not permanently employed by a company often find work during the holiday periods as Temp Lifeguards on main beaches. Often students who hold LA certification will work on a day by day basis during busy seasons.

Many main beaches such as Scottburgh and St Michaels beaches have voluntary lifeguard clubs. These clubs recruit new members into the Lifeguard niche by way of their nipper and Junior Lifesaving Award programs. A cost-effective way of obtaining the LA certification would be to join a club and do the course, at a reduced rate, through that club.

===Taiwan===

In Taiwan there are three main lifesaving organizations providing lifeguard licenses and training, one is called National Water Life Saving Association Republic of China (NWLSAROC) another is called The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China and National Chinese Surf Life Saving Association(NCSLSA). NWLSA was first launched in 1970 and aided by Australians Surf Life Savers. The Red Cross Society was founded around 1949. NWLSA joined the International Life Saving Federation in 1994. National Chinese Surf Lifesaving Association, founded in 1993 and joined ILS as associated member in 1997, is the first and only organization that focus on training surf lifesaver and open-water lifeguard in Taiwan.

===United Kingdom===

====Pool lifeguards====
In the United Kingdom, there are three awarding bodies for Lifeguard qualifications, Highfield Awarding Body for Compliance (HABC), the Swimming Teachers Association, and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS). The organisations&#x27; qualifications are STA Level 2 Award for Pool Lifeguard / STA Professional Award for Pool Lifeguard (title in Scotland,) the HABC Level 2 Award in Pool lifeguarding (QCF) and the National Pool Lifeguard Qualification respectively. The National Pool Lifeguard Qualification is administered by the Institute of Qualified Lifeguards (IQL) on behalf of the RLSS.

All three qualifications are recognised professionally within the United Kingdom and enable the holder to work as a Professional Pool Lifeguard satisfying all Health and Safety Executive (HSE) regulations. For Public Swimming sessions a full lifeguard qualification is recommended by the HSE in the Managing health and safety in swimming pools manual.

A full Pool Lifeguard course lasts a minimum of 36 hours and ends with external examiners testing the individuals both on land and in the water and includes an examination paper (verbal in Generation 8 NPLQ, however this has been replaced with multiple choice questions in the new Generation 9, consisting of three sections; first aid, lifeguarding situations and pool specifics). The qualification is valid for two years from the date of assessment. A minimum of 20 hours training must be logged in those two years for the individual to be eligible to submit for a renewal examination. The employer of the lifeguard should provide training every month in lifeguard skills and resuscitation training to help it comply with HSE guidelines. Additional units which all full Pool Lifeguards are assessed vigorously and which all Leisure facilities must have (public and private) is the use of spinal boards, a specialist piece of rescue equipment designed for immobilizing a casualty suspected of suffering a spinal cord injury. They are trained in lifeguarding, first aid and CPR and are typically stationed at beaches, pools, or other bodies of water where there is a risk of drowning.

HABC/RLSS qualifications are trained by TAs (Trainer/Assessors) and STA qualifications are trained by tutors. These are experienced lifeguards or lifesavers who have undergone additional training to train and assess. Many leisure centres have their own TAs or tutors who operate in-house training for the lifeguards. TAs and tutors also assess qualification renewals but RLSS TAs and STA tutors are unable to assess any lifeguard who works in the same place the TA or tutors hold training sessions. Also they are unable to assess any lifeguard they have trained. Highfield (HABC) T/As are able to assess lifeguards from the same centre as long as they have had no involvement with the training.

In 2012, there were no reported drownings in UK swimming pools where there was a lifeguard on duty.

====Beach lifeguards====

The three alternative schemes for qualifying beach lifeguard in the UK are run by the Royal Life Saving Society UK, who offer the &#x27;National Vocational Beach Lifeguard Qualification&#x27; (NVBLQ), Surf Life Saving Wales and Surf Life Saving Great Britain (in association with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution) who offer the &#x27;National Rescue Standards Beach Lifeguard Qualification&#x27; (NaRS BL).

Both organizations also offer a range of &quot;specialist modules&quot; that can be added to the basic qualification, such as VHF Radio Operator; Rescue Water Craft RWC, Rescue Surf Skills, Rescue (paddle) Board, Rescue Boat (Crew), Rescue Boat (Driver), AED and CPR Oxygen Administration.

The RNLI is the largest operator of lifeguard units in the UK, patrolling over 230 operational beaches around the coast of England and Wales, helping around 7,000 people each year.
====Canoe lifeguards====
The British Canoe Union has canoe life guard units in the UK managed by the BCU Lifeguards. These are special units that operate in Kayaks and Canoes in areas where motor boats would have problems.

====Inland lifeguards====
Inland water sites such as lakes, rivers and estuaries – typically where there is a specific need, such as sports competitions or public events. There are a few examples of organisations that provide such services; some operating on a voluntary basis such as Colwick Park Lifeguards, relying heavily on the services of volunteers. There are also commercial entities that provide similar services, ranging from marina staff to workboat providers. Typically in the UK voluntary groups of this type are either local to that particular stretch of water or provide a service across the country. As of recently, the Royal Life Saving Society has offered an Open Water Lifeguard qualification which specialises in still, non-tidal waters. This acts as an entirely separate qualification or can be done as an additional module in National Pool Lifeguard Qualifications (NPLQs).

====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland, the Royal Life Saving Society (RLSS IRELAND) also provide training in lifesaving and courses in lifeguarding for both the National Pool Lifeguard Qualification (NPLQ) and the National Beach Lifeguard Qualification.

===United States===

In the United States there are several nationally recognized organizations that certify lifeguards. The American Red Cross Lifeguarding program, American Lifeguard Association, Jeff Ellis and Associates, the YMCA, Starfish Aquatics Institute&#x27;s Starguard program, NASCO, and the Boy Scouts of America. The standard in open water surf training is the United States Lifesaving Association.

The American Red Cross, USLA and Ellis and Associates establish standards which are universally adopted for lifeguard training.

The first beach patrol in the United States was founded in 1891 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The Atlantic City Beach Patrol is currently the oldest active beach patrol in the United States.

In 2009, 117 drowned at the nation&#x27;s beaches; 21 drowned where lifeguards were on duty. There were 82,969 rescues reported from 114 reporting agencies.

==Consent==
In an active emergency, lifeguards are required to act, and to ask permission to give care in any situation. Ill or injured people can grant their informed consent for care. Someone who is unresponsive, confused or seriously injured or ill (such as in a nonfatal drowning) may not be able to grant consent. In these cases, the law assumes the victim would give consent if able. This is called implied consent, and also applies to an underage victim whose parent or guardian is not present.

==Competition==

Continuous training is necessary to maintain lifeguarding skills and knowledge. Formal competitions have developed as a way to encourage training, and also as a social activity. In Australia, the annual Surf Lifesaving competition at Kurrawa Beach on the Gold Coast is the largest athletic event in the world after the Olympic Games with tens of thousands of lifeguards competing.
Lifeguard competitions include both physical events and technical (medical) events. Technical events are challenging accident simulations in which guards are evaluated on their adherence to treatment standards. These events are a subject of controversy amongst some lifeguards due to their subjectivity. Purely physical competitions have recently become more popular, often including various combinations of running, swimming, paddle boarding, and surf skiing. Most lifeguard competitions include an Ironman event that combines three different physical activities.

<text>A caboose is a crewed North American railroad car coupled at the end of a freight train. Cabooses provide shelter for crew at the end of a train, who were formerly required in switching and shunting; as well as in keeping a lookout for load shifting, damage to equipment and cargo, and overheating axles.

Originally flatcars fitted with cabins or modified box cars, they later became purpose-built, with bay windows above or to the sides of the car to allow crew to observe the train. The caboose also served as the conductor&#x27;s office, and on long routes, included sleeping accommodations and cooking facilities.

A similar railroad car, the brake van, was used on British and Commonwealth railways outside North America (the role has since been replaced by the crew car in Australia). On trains not fitted with continuous brakes, brake vans provided a supplementary braking system, and they helped keep chain couplings taut.

Cabooses were used on every freight train in the United States and Canada until the 1980s, when safety laws requiring the presence of cabooses and full crews were relaxed. A major purpose of the caboose was for observing problems at the rear of the train before they caused trouble. Lineside defect detectors and end-of-train devices eliminated much of this need. Older freight cars had plain bearings with hot boxes for crews to spot overheating – as freight cars replaced these with roller bearings, there was also less need for cabooses to monitor them. Nowadays, they are generally only used on rail maintenance or hazardous materials trains, as a platform for crew on industrial spur lines when it is required to make long reverse movements, or on heritage and tourist railroads.

==Etymology==
Railroad historian David L. Joslyn (a retired Southern Pacific Railroad draftsman) has traced the possible root of &quot;caboose&quot; to the obsolete Middle Low German word &quot;Kabuse&quot;, a small cabin erected on a sailing ship&#x27;s main deck. This was absorbed into Middle Dutch and entered the Dutch language &quot;circa&quot; 1747 as &quot;kabhuis&quot;, the compartment on a ship&#x27;s main deck in which meals were prepared. In modern Dutch, &quot;kombuis&quot; is equivalent to &quot;galley&quot;.

Eighteenth century French naval records also make reference to a &quot;cambose&quot; or &quot;camboose,&quot; which described both the food preparation cabin on a ship&#x27;s main deck and its stove. Camboose may have entered English through American sailors who had come into contact with their French allies during the American Revolution. It was already in use in U.S. naval terminology by the 1797 construction of the USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, whose wood-burning food preparation stove is known as the &quot;camboose.&quot; In modern French, &quot;cambuse&quot; can refer both to a ship&#x27;s storeroom and to the North-American railcar.

Camboose as a cook shack was in use in English at least by 1805, when it was used in a New York &quot;Chronicle&quot; article cited in the &quot;New English Dictionary&quot; describing a New England shipwreck, which reported that &quot;[Survivor] William Duncan drifted aboard the canboose .&quot; As the first railroad cabooses were wooden shanties erected on flat cars as early as the 1830s, they would have resembled the cook shack on a ship&#x27;s deck.

The earliest known printed record of &quot;caboose&quot; used to describe the railcar appeared in 1859 in court records in conjunction with a lawsuit filed against the New York and Harlem Railway.

The most common pluralization of caboose is &quot;cabooses&quot;.

==History==
Use of cabooses began in the 1830s, when railroads housed trainmen in shanties built onto boxcars or flatcars. The caboose provided the train crew with a shelter at the rear of the train. The crew could exit the train for switching or to protect the rear of the train when stopped. They also inspected the train for problems such as shifting loads, broken or dragging equipment, and hot boxes (overheated axle bearings, a serious fire and derailment threat). The conductor kept records and handled business from a table or desk in the caboose. For longer trips, the caboose provided minimal living quarters, and was frequently personalized and decorated with pictures and posters.

Early cabooses were nothing more than flat cars with small cabins erected on them, or modified box cars. The standard form of the American caboose had a platform at either end with curved grab rails to facilitate train crew members&#x27; ascent onto a moving train. A caboose was fitted with red lights called markers to enable the rear of the train to be seen at night. This has led to the phrase &quot;bringing up the markers&quot; to describe the last car on a train. These lights were officially what made a train a &quot;train&quot;, and were originally lit with oil lamps. With the advent of electricity, later caboose versions incorporated an electrical generator driven by belts coupled to one of the axles, which charged a lead-acid storage battery when the train was in motion. The addition of the cupola, a lookout post atop the car, was introduced in 1863.

Coal or wood was originally used to fire a cast-iron stove for heat and cooking, later giving way to a kerosene heater. Now rare, the old stoves can be identified by several essential features. They were without legs, bolted directly to the floor, and featured a lip on the top surface to keep pans and coffee pots from sliding off. They also had a double-latching door, to prevent accidental discharge of hot coals caused by the rocking motion of the caboose.

Cabooses are non-revenue equipment and were often improvised or retained well beyond the normal lifetime of a freight car. Tradition on many lines held that the caboose should be painted a bright red, though on many lines it eventually became the practice to paint them in the same corporate colors as locomotives. The Kansas City Southern Railway was unique in that it bought cabooses with a stainless steel car body, and so was not obliged to paint them.

===Decline===

Until the 1980s, laws in the United States and Canada required all freight trains to have a caboose and a full crew for safety. Technology eventually advanced to a point where the railroads, in an effort to save money by reducing crew members, stated that cabooses were unnecessary.

New diesel locomotives had large cabs that could house entire crews. Distant dispatchers controlled switches, eliminating the need to manually throw switches after trains had passed. Improved signaling eliminated the need to protect the rear of a stopped train. Bearings were improved and lineside detectors were used to detect hot boxes, which themselves were becoming rarer with more and more freight cars gaining roller bearings. Better-designed cars avoided problems with the loads which helped as well. The railroads also claimed a caboose was a dangerous place, as slack run-ins could hurl the crew from their places and even dislodge weighty equipment.

Railroads proposed the end-of-train device (EOT or ETD), commonly called a FRED (flashing rear-end device), as an alternative. An ETD could be attached to the rear of the train to detect the train&#x27;s air brake pressure and report any problems to the locomotive by telemetry. The ETD also detects movement of the train upon start-up and radios this information to the engineers so they know all of the slack is out of the couplings and additional power could be applied. The machines also have blinking red lights to warn following trains that a train is ahead. With the introduction of the ETD, the conductor moved up to the front of the train with the engineer.

A 1982 Presidential Emergency Board convened under the Railway Labor Act directed United States railroads to begin eliminating caboose cars where possible to do so. A legal exception was the state of Virginia, which had a 1911 law mandating cabooses on the ends of trains, until the law&#x27;s final repeal in 1988. With this exception aside, year by year, cabooses started to fade away. Very few cabooses remain in operation today, though they are still used for some local trains where it is convenient to have a brakeman at the end of the train to operate switches, on long reverse movements, and are also used on trains carrying hazardous materials.

CSX Transportation is one of the few Class 1 railroads that still maintains a fleet of modified cabooses for regular use. Employed as &quot;shoving platforms&quot; at the rear of local freight trains which must perform long reverse moves or heavy switching, these are generally rebuilt bay-window cabooses with their cabin doors welded shut (leaving their crews to work from the rear platform). BNSF also maintains a fleet of former wide-vision cabooses for a similar purpose, and in 2013 began repainting some of them in heritage paint schemes of BNSF&#x27;s predecessor railroads.

==Types==
The form of cabooses varied over the years, with changes made both to reflect differences in service and improvements in design. The most commonly seen types are:

===Cupola or &quot;standard&quot;===

The most common caboose form in American railroad practice has a small windowed projection on the roof, called the cupola. The crew sat in elevated seats to inspect the train from this perch.

The invention of the cupola caboose is generally attributed to T. B. Watson, a freight conductor on the Chicago and North Western Railway. In 1898, he wrote:

The position of the cupola varied. In most eastern railroad cabooses, the cupola was in the center of the car, but most western railroads preferred to put it toward the end of the car. Some conductors preferred to have the cupola toward the front, others liked it toward the rear of the train, and still others had no preference. ATSF conductors could refuse to be assigned to a train if they did not have their cabooses turned to face the way they preferred. This would be a rare union agreement clause that could be used however it was not a regular issue.

The classic idea of the &quot;little red caboose&quot; at the end of every train came about when cabooses were painted a reddish brown; however, some railroads (UP, and NKP, for example) painted their cabooses yellow or red and white. The most notable was the Santa Fe which in the 1960s started a rebuild program for their cabooses in which the cars were painted bright red, with an eight-foot-diameter Santa Fe cross herald emblazoned on each side in yellow. Some railroads, chiefly the Wabash Railway, Pennsylvania Railroad, Norfolk and Western and Illinois Central Gulf, also built or upgraded cabooses with streamlined cupolas for better aerodynamics and to project a more modern image.
===Bay window===
In a bay window caboose, the crew monitoring the train sits in the middle of the car in a section of wall that projects from the side of the caboose. The windows set into these extended walls resemble architectural bay windows, so the caboose type is called a bay window caboose. This type afforded a better view of the side of the train and eliminated the falling hazard of the cupola. It is thought to have first been used on the Akron, Canton and Youngstown Railroad in 1923, but is particularly associated with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which built all of its cabooses in this design starting from an experimental model in 1930. The bay window gained favor with many railroads because it eliminated the need for additional clearances in tunnels and overpasses.

On the West Coast, the Milwaukee Road and the Northern Pacific Railway used these cars, converting over 900 roof top cabooses to bay windows in the late 1930s. Milwaukee Road rib-side bay window cabooses are preserved at New Lisbon, Wisconsin, the Illinois Railway Museum, the Mt. Rainier Scenic Railroad and Cedarburg, Wisconsin, among other places.

The Western Pacific Railroad was an early adopter of the type, building their own bay window cars starting in 1942 and acquiring this style exclusively from then on. Many other roads operated this type, including the Southern Pacific Railroad, St. Louis – San Francisco Railway, Katy Railroad, Kansas City Southern Railway, the Southern Railway, and the New York Central Railroad.

In the UK, brake vans are usually of this basic design: the bay window is known as a lookout or ducket.

===Extended-vision===
In the extended-vision or wide-vision caboose, the sides of the cupola project beyond the side of the car body. Rock Island created some of these by rebuilding some standard cupola cabooses with windowed extensions applied to the sides of the cupola itself, but by far, the greatest number have the entire cupola compartment enlarged. This model was introduced by the International Car Company and saw service on most U.S. railroads. The expanded cupola allowed the crew to see past the top of the taller cars that began to appear after World War II, and also increased the roominess of the cupola area.

Additionally, Monon Railroad had a unique change to the extended-vision cabooses. They added a miniature bay to the sides of the cupola to enhance the views further. This created a unique look for their small fleet. Seven of the eight Monon-built cabooses have been saved. One was scrapped after an accident in Kentucky. The surviving cars are at the Indiana Transportation Museum (operational), the Indiana Railway Museum (operational), the Kentucky Railway Museum (fire damaged), and the Bluegrass Railroad Museum (unrestored but serviceable). The remaining three are in private collections.

===Transfer===
A transfer caboose looks more like a flat car with a shed bolted to the middle of it than like a standard caboose. It is used in transfer service between rail yards or short switching runs, and as such, lacks sleeping, cooking or restroom facilities. The ends of a transfer caboose are left open, with safety railings surrounding the area between the crew compartment and the end of the car.

A recent variation on the transfer caboose is the &quot;pushing&quot; or &quot;shoving&quot; platform. It can be any railcar where a brakeman can safely ride for some distance to help the engineer with visibility at the other end of the train. Flatcars and covered hoppers have been used for this purpose, but often the pushing platform is a caboose that has had its windows covered and welded shut and permanently locked doors. CSX uses former Louisville &amp; Nashville short bay window cabooses and former Conrail waycars as pushing platforms.
Transfer cabooses are not to be confused with Missouri Pacific Railroad (MoPac) cabooses, as their cabooses were fully functional.

===Drover&#x27;s===
Drover&#x27;s cabooses looked more like combine cars than standard cabooses. The purpose of a drover&#x27;s caboose was much more like a combine, as well. On longer livestock trains in the American West, the drover&#x27;s caboose is where the livestock&#x27;s handlers would ride between the ranch and processing plant. The train crew rode in the caboose section while the livestock handlers rode in the coach section. Drover&#x27;s cabooses used either cupolas or bay windows in the caboose section for the train crew to monitor the train. The use of drover&#x27;s cars on the Northern Pacific Railway, for example, lasted until the Burlington Northern Railroad merger of 1970. They were often found on stock trains originating in Montana.

==Preservation and reuse==
Although the caboose has largely fallen out of use, some are still retained by railroads in a reserve capacity. These cabooses are typically used in and around railyards. Other uses for the caboose include &quot;special&quot; trains, where the train is involved in some sort of railway maintenance; as part of survey trains that inspect remote rail lines after natural disasters to check for damage; or in protecting the movement of nuclear material within the United States. Others have been modified for use in research roles to investigate complaints from residents or business owners regarding trains in certain locations. Finally, some are coupled to trains for special events, including historical tours.

The Chihuahua al Pacífico Railroad in Mexico still uses cabooses to accompany their motorail trains between Chihuahua and Los Mochis.

Cabooses have also become popular for collection by railroad museums and for city parks and other civic uses, such as visitor centers. Several railroad museums roster large numbers of cabooses, including the Illinois Railway Museum with 19 examples and the Western Pacific Railroad Museum at Portola, California, with 17. Many shortline railroads still use cabooses today. Large railroads also use cabooses as &quot;shoving platforms&quot; or in switching service where it is convenient to have crew at the rear of the train.

Cabooses have been reused as vacation cottages, garden offices in private residences, and as portions of restaurants. Also, caboose motels have appeared, with the old cars being used as cabins.

A bay window caboose numbered FCD-17 is still being used by the Philippine National Railways for non-revenue maintenance trains. It was built in Japan in 1962 and is used as an inspection car by the Philippine National Police.

<doc id="329958" wikidata="Q4670941" url="?curid=329958" title="Senegalia greggii">
<text>Senegalia greggii, formerly known as Acacia greggii, is a species of tree in the genus &quot;Senegalia&quot; native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, from the extreme south of Utah south through southern Nevada, southeast California, Arizona, New Mexico and western Texas to Baja California, Sinaloa and Nuevo León in Mexico. The population in Utah at 37°10&#x27; N is the northernmost naturally occurring &quot;Senegalia&quot; species anywhere in the world.

Common names include acacia bush, catclaw acacia, catclaw mesquite, Gregg&#x27;s catclaw, paradise flower, wait-a-minute bush, and wait-a-bit tree; these names mostly come from the fact that the tree has numerous hooked prickles with the shape and size of a cat&#x27;s claw which tend to hook onto passers-by; the hooked person must stop (&quot;wait a minute&quot;) to remove the prickles carefully to avoid injury or shredded clothing. (The common name &quot;cat&#x27;s claw&quot; is also used to refer to several other plant species, including &quot;Uncaria tomentosa&quot;, a woody vine found in the tropical jungles of South and Central America.) The specific epithet &quot;greggii&quot; refers to Josiah Gregg, a 19th-century author, explorer, and amateur naturalist of the American Southwest and northern Mexico.

==Description==

It is a large shrub or small tree growing to tall with a trunk up to diameter. The grey-green leaves are deciduous, and bipinnate, divided into 1-3 pairs of pinnae, each pinna long with 10-18 leaflets that are . Pinnae are most frequently in two pairs, with the proximal pair perpendicular to the petiolule and the distal pair forming a V at the tip.

The blooms are produced in dense cylindrical spikes of numerous flowers, each individual flower with five cream colored petals and numerous creamy yellow stamens. The fruit is a flat, twisted legume (pod) long, containing generally 3 to 5 hard, flattened, medium brown seeds. The seed pod is constricted between seeds (a loment), and seed dispersal occurs both through dehiscence and breaks at these constrictions.

==Ecology==
&quot;Senegalia greggii&quot; is most common in arroyos where its roots have access to deep water. Its seeds require physical scarification in order to germinate. This effectively prevents germination unless a flash flood disturbs the area and deposits enough water to increase the likelihood that seedlings will be able to establish deep enough roots to survive the dry season. Catclaw is fully drought deciduous and will usually lack leaves for most of the year. &quot;S. greggii&quot; has extrafloral nectaries, a trait shared with other senegalias. A tentative connection has been made between these glands and insects that would suggest a mutualistic relationship (as found in other &quot;Senegalia&quot; species). Ants are known to use the glands as a source of food and water, and may provide some defense for the plant against herbivorous insects. Like other arroyo trees in family Fabaceae, &quot;S. greggii&quot; is frequently afflicted with Desert Mistletoe, &quot;Phoradendron californicum&quot;. Unlike other legumes, &quot;S. greggii&quot; is not known to form root nodule associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

It is argued that this species may be an example of an evolutionary anachronism, in which the range and renewal of the species is limited due to the extinction of the mammalian megafauna responsible for seed dispersal. Within this model, the scarification required to germinate the seeds would have occurred during the chewing and digestion of the fruit by a large mammal, who later passes the seed intact some distance from the original tree.

Gambel quail eat the seeds. Antelope browse the foliage, but more delicate species may do so cautiously on account of the thorns.

==Ethnobotany==
&quot;Senegalia greggii&quot;, even though it is used as forage for livestock, contains a potentially poisonous cyanogenic glycoside called prunasin. Mature seeds are to be avoided, as the native people did. The young, unripe beans of &quot;S. greggii&quot; were gathered and eaten by desert tribes of North America, including the Chemehuevi of the Southern Paiute, the Pima, and the Cahuilla. The Cahuilla also ground the dried beans for mush and cakes, while the Havasupai ground it to make flour for bread. The Seri ground the beans to meal then mixed it with water and sea lion oil for porridge. The Diegueno used &quot;S. greggii&quot; as food for domesticated animals.

The Pimas and Tohono O&#x27;odham ate the seeds as pinole.
The Cahuilla and Pima used the fibers for sturdy construction material and firewood. The Havasupai split the twigs and used them for basketry, but also used the twigs as a broom to brush off metates. The O&#x27;odham used the broken twigs for baskets, and were curved to make intricate weaves in the baskets. The Pima used the dried bushes to pile them to make a brush fence. The branches were used to make cradle frames as well.

The Tohono O&#x27;odham fitted the branches around deer hunters&#x27; heads to make a disguise, and the buds and blossoms were dried to make perfume sachets by the women. The sticks were also used to dislodge saguaro fruits from the cactus body, and rods were curved to flesh animal skins. The Akimel O&#x27;odham made bows out of the wood.

<doc id="329959" wikidata="Q3250739" url="?curid=329959" title="Brake van">
<text>Brake van and guard&#x27;s van are terms used mainly in the UK, Ireland, Australia and India for a railway vehicle equipped with a hand brake which can be applied by the guard. The equivalent North American term is caboose, but a British brake van and a caboose are very different in appearance, and use because the former usually has only four wheels, while the latter usually has bogies, as well as American Cabooses not being used to provide braking on a train, and instead serving as a mobile office for the conductor and the brakemen who helped monitor the train. German railways employed brakeman&#x27;s cabins combined into other cars.

Many British freight trains formerly had no continuous brake so the only available brakes were those on the locomotive and the brake van. Because of this shortage of brake power, the speed was restricted to . The brake van was marshalled at the rear of the train so both portions of the train could be brought to a stand in the event of a coupling breaking.

When freight trains were fitted with continuous braking, brake vans lost their importance, and were discontinued by many railways. However, they still continue on some important railways, such as the Indian Railways, besides the heritage railways.

==Origin==

Railways were a formalised development of industrial tramways, which had found need on occasions to add additional braking capacity by adding an empty truck to the rear of a group of tramcars. This allowed the &quot;locomotive&quot; — often a cableway powered by a steam engine at the surface — to operate both safely and, more importantly, at higher speed.

The first railways, such as the pioneering Liverpool and Manchester Railway of 1830, used a version of the tramways buffer and chain coupling, termed a screw-coupling. Vehicles are coupled by hand using a hook and links with a turnbuckle-like device that draws the vehicles together. Vehicles have buffers, one at each corner on the ends, which are pulled together and compressed by the coupling device. With no continuous brake across the entire train, the whole train was reliant on the braking capacity of the locomotive, and train lengths were restricted.

To allow for longer trains, early railway companies from the 1840s onwards began replicating industrial tramway practises, by adding &quot;break vans&quot;. The term was derived from their name on the industrial tramways, in which they controlled the (residual) train if there was a &quot;break&quot; in the linkage to the locomotive. Early railway couplings had been found to be prone to breakages. The term was only replaced by &quot;brake van&quot; from the 1870s onwards.

Because of the combined risks of shortage of brake power and breaking couplings, the speed of freight trains was initially restricted to . The brake van was marshalled at the rear of the train, and served two purposes:

*Provided additional braking for &#x27;unfitted&#x27; goods trains
*Put a man (the guard) at the rear of the train, who could take action in the event of a breakdown or accident

While the UK railway system persisted until post-nationalisation in 1948 with &quot;unfitted&quot; (discontinuously braked) trains and loose couplings (the final unfitted trains ran in the 1990s), other systems, such as the North American adoption of the Janney coupler, overcame the same railway safety issues in a different manner.

==The guard&#x27;s duties==

On unfitted trains, the brake van has several purposes, and hence jobs for the guard: Operating the brake, train supervision, and illumination &amp; communication. 

Firstly, and most importantly, the guard would use the brake van&#x27;s brakes to assist with keeping the train under control on downwards gradients, and whenever they could see that the locomotive&#x27;s crew was attempting to slow the train. Route knowledge would allow the guard to initiate the braking before the driver. To aid in this, signalling regulations mandated that signals be left at clear until the entirety of a train (including guard&#x27;s van) had passed, as the guard would immediately apply brakes upon seeing a signal at danger.

Secondly, they minimized the risk of snapped broken couplings by application of handbrake wheel, which would keep otherwise-loose screw couplings taut between unfitted wagons. This helped mitigate the risk of a coupling failure from uneven acceleration (&quot;snatching&quot; or jerking). This was particularly a problem as locomotives became more powerful. Because coupling failures were a fairly common occurrence when starting an unfitted train, train crews were given specific instruction upon starting a freight train that the footplate crew look back towards the brake van for a signal from the guard (by flag or lamp) that the entire train was moving and all couplings were taut, before accelerating to higher speeds. 

A later job of the guard was the provision of side lamps on brake vans. The white lamp is the tail lamp, whilst the grey lamps are the side lamps, along with the standard tail lamp (showing red to the rear and sides) required on the rear of every train. The side lamps showed a white light towards the front and a red light to the side/rear. The front-facing lamps were an indication to the locomotive crew that the train was still complete, whilst the provision of extra red lights to the rear was an additional safety measure. Due to the very low chance of all three lights being out at once, it was stipulated that a freight train passing without any lamps on the rear had split and that the rear portion was potentially running away. These side lamps were used on passenger trains before the adoption of continuous brakes on such trains.

A further purpose for these side lamps was altering the colour of illumination lamps. Because the red indication was provided by a removable filter, a white light could be shown to the rear of the train when needed. This could be used to indicate to a train on a parallel faster line that the slower freight train showing the white light was travelling in the same direction but on another line, presenting no danger of a collision. The white lamp would be on the side closest to the faster running line, and would be deployed on relief or slow lines where faster running lines ran parallel with no more than one other line intervening, or on loops or refuge sidings next to running lines. In an emergency, the guard could attract the attention of other railway staff by reversing these side lights, so that red lights shone forward to alert the locomotive crew, and any other railway staff that saw them.

==Country overview==

===Great Britain===

====Past====

In Great Britain, freight trains without a continuous train braking system in either the whole train or the rearmost section of the train (&quot;unfitted&quot; or &quot;partly fitted&quot;, respectively in UK railway parlance) were still prevalent in the 1970s, but mostly eliminated by the 1980s.

Early brake vans were heavily weighted, adapted open freight wagons, equipped with an externally mounted hand-operated brake acting on all four wheels. The term brake van began to be adopted from the 1870s onwards, when bespoke designed vehicles had a specific hut added to house the guard away from the weather. In keeping with tradition, most brake vans had an open area, but from the 1870s onwards this &quot;veranda&quot; became in part enclosed through the addition of a roof. Some vans became fully enclosed, but were equipped at each end with windows to allow the guard to view the entire train.

All of the operating equipment, specifically the brakes and sandboxes to improve traction, were located in the open area of the brake van. Brakes were normally controlled using a hand wheel mounted within the veranda, although some early designs continued with an externally mounted shaft. To improve the guard&#x27;s visibility, many were fitted with look-outs on the roof, but side look-outs (termed &quot;duckets&quot;) were the more common. The North Eastern Railway, Great Central Railway, London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway all built brake vans with a raised look-out at one end of the roof.

Two issues always added to brake power, the purpose of a brake van: wheels, and weight. Hence, many companies tried both approaches to improve their brake vans. Brake vans often had a significant amount of ballast, in the form of concrete, cast iron or water tanks built into their structure, to increase the available braking effort.

Whilst most brake vans had two axles with four wheels, many railway companies built brake vans with three axles and six wheels. The Great Northern Railway built a few eight-wheelers for very heavy coal trains, the only rigid eight-wheeler brake vans built in the UK. In the 1930s, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) built three bespoke twin-bogied vans (four axles, eight wheels), for use on a particular branch line, where they replaced pairs of four-wheeled vans. The design covered the entire chassis length, with two extended verandas on either side of a cabin equipped with twin duckets.
To improve braking further, some LMS and LNER brake vans were fitted with vacuum brakes in addition to their normal brake, which could be operated by the guard. Almost all War Department brake vans were fitted with vacuum cylinders, as they were exclusively used on ammunition trains. The Southern Railway built 46 twin-bogie brake vans: the first 21 on redundant electric locomotive chassis, termed the &quot;Gondola&quot; brake vans; and the last 25 on new chassis, termed the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; brake vans. Designed for high speed operation on milk and parcels trains rather than stopping power, they had a lengthened cabin, but did not cover the entire twin-bogie chassis.

====Equipment and Furniture====
Equipment carried aboard the brake van, which had to be checked by the guard before the train&#x27;s departure, consisted of:
* A shunting pole: a wooden pole about 6 feet long with a twisted hook on the end which was used to couple and uncouple 3-link and instanter couplings without the guard having to position himself dangerously in between the vehicles,
* At least 2 &quot;sprags&quot;: A section of wood designed to be shoved into gaps in the side of a railway wagon wheel, that physically prevent the wheel from rotating, effectively immobilizing a wagon. They were often used during shunting operations, or when wagons needed detached from a train as means to prevent runaways.
* Brake stick: similar in shape to a square ended baseball bat; and used to lever down the handbrakes of wagons by placing it under the solebar and applying downward pressure, 
* Track circuit clips: A pair of metal spring clips connected by a wire used on lines with track circuits to indicate to the signalman that a train is occupying that section. They would be used in the event of an accident in which other running lines were fouled and trains on them had to be stopped as a matter of great urgency.
* A set of red and green signalling flags,
* At least 12 detonators (fog signals),
* Various lamps: A guard would ensure they were carried, filled, trimmed, and ready for use where required by railway rules.
** Hand lamp: A lamp kept inside the brake van that was required to be lit: at night, during fog or falling snow, long tunnels, or any other location ordered by the Operating Superintendent,
** Tail lamp: A lamp mounted on the center of the brake van, that displayed a red light to anyone viewing the train from behind, such as a following train that there was a train, as enabling signallers to confirm the train was complete.
** Side lamps: Two lamps were mounted on either side of a brake van. The lamps showed a white lamp forward to enable the engine crew to see the train was complete, and either a red or white light to rear. (The rear facing color depended the location of the train in multi-track situations.)

These checks were part of the guard&#x27;s train preparation duties, and their responsibility. The guard would also ensure that the van carried coal and kindling to light the stove fire, even in summer if the train was to be relieved by another crew who might have to work into the cool of evening or night. It was common for guards to carry old newspapers with which to stop up any draughts that made their presence felt at speed; partly fitted freight trains might run up to .

Other features of the van&#x27;s interior would be a coal stove for the guard&#x27;s heating and cooking needs, above which was a rail with hooks on for the purpose of drying wet clothing. Furniture would consist of padded seating, with pads at shoulder height to protect the guard from the inevitable jolts and jerks (&#x27;snatches&#x27;) of freight work, at the duckets; the guard would sit here for protection while the train was moving, unless absolutely necessary. The guard could reach the brake wheel from that position. This padded seat would be on top of a bench locker that stretched the entire side of one side of the van and half of the other (the side which the stove). A further padded seat was provided at the end of this bench locker where there was a small desk for the guard to perform whatever written work was necessary.

====Decline====
In 1968, the requirement for fully fitted freight trains to end with a guard&#x27;s van was lifted. By this time, nearly all steam locomotives had been withdrawn and most of the standard-design British Railways diesel and electric locomotives which replaced them had cabs at both ends. The guard was therefore allowed to ride in the rearmost locomotive cab, which gave a good view of the whole train. There being in consequence no operational need for so many brake vans, many types were withdrawn. In 1985, the rail unions agreed to single-man operation of some freight services, and for the first time in over 150 years trains were operated without a guard on board. Brake vans continued to be required, nevertheless, on trains carrying dangerous chemicals until the late 1990s.

====Present====
The requirement to use brake vans on trains in Great Britain was formally removed in 2021 with changes to the formal rules for freight train operation (colloquially known as the &#x27;White Pages&#x27;).

In the years immediately prior to that, brake vans were only deemed necessary by HM Railway Inspectorate or Network Rail in certain special cases, for example in trains with unusual cargoes, track maintenance trains.
The nearest equivalent to a brake van still in use on main-line British railways is the driving van trailer (DVT), which is used on locomotive-hauled trains to control the locomotive from the other end of the train in a push-pull configuration, removing the need for the locomotive to run around its train at termini. Although the DVT has braking capability of its own, this is incidental, as the vehicle&#x27;s primary purpose is to allow the train to be driven from the opposite end of the train from the locomotive, as well as to provide accommodation for bulky luggage.

Brake vans are still a common sight on many heritage railways. On occasion, multiple brake vans will be coupled together in what is known as a &quot;brake van special&quot; for people to ride in.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, brake vans (or guard&#x27;s vans; both terms were in common use) were often also used for carrying parcels and light freight, and usually had large compartments and loading doors for such items. Some of the larger vans also included a compartment for passengers travelling on goods services or drovers travelling with their livestock.

==== Cane railways ====
Sugar cane railways in Queensland sometimes have radio-controlled brake vans. The wagons in these trains are unfitted and have no continuous brake pipes.

===India===

On Indian Railways, brake vans are still in use to a great extent on freight or goods trains and in some passenger trains.

The brake van in the passenger trains (usually the first and last coaches in the train) is a part of a coach and consists of an enclosed room/cabin with two small seats facing opposite each other, one seat having the writing table for the guard to assist writing and working his train, the opposite seat being a spare. The van also has a small lavatory. A special feature of the passenger brake van is a small dog box where passengers can carry their pets along with them while they travel in the same train in a different coach. The guard generally remains responsible for the water and pet food while the train is moving, and there are features to the dog box to allow the same. The brake van also contains a stretcher, an emergency train lighting box, and a stand to hold the lamp signal during the night. The vacuum or air pressure gauge is hosted in front of the guard&#x27;s seat with a lever to operate it in case of emergency. The hand brake can be used in case of high emergency. The remaining part of the coach consists of space for carrying parcels and small goods. It also has seating for ladies or for the disabled (wheelchair friendly).

The goods brake van is less attractive, is generally the last vehicle on the train, open on both sides, and does not necessarily have interior lighting/lamps, but it does house a small lavatory seat for the guards, owing to their long hours on freight trains. The van is less secure and has fewer features than a passenger brake van. Eight-wheeled brake vans were introduced recently to improve the riding comfort for the guards.

==Passenger brake van==

A passenger brake van was a combine car originally designed to serve the same purpose as a goods brake van, but, when continuous brakes became standard on passenger trains, its use changed. The van may have equipment for the application of continuous brakes in an emergency if fitted alongside the hand brake for when the train is parked without a locomotive present. The vehicle also provides a compartment for the guard, a luggage compartment, and sometimes passenger accommodation, as well.

===Examples===
Examples of British passenger brake vans include:

* Brake Gangwayed
* Brake Standard Open
* Brake Standard Open (Micro-Buffet)

===Support coaches===
In the UK, converted British Railways Mark 1 passenger brake vans are used as the basis for preserved steam locomotive support coaches.

<doc id="329971" wikidata="Q508752" url="?curid=329971" title="Frank Lautenberg">
<text>Frank Raleigh Lautenberg (; January 23, 1924 June 3, 2013) was an American businessman and Democratic Party politician who served as United States Senator from New Jersey from 1982 to 2001, and again from 2003 until his death in 2013. He was originally from Paterson, New Jersey.

Lautenberg was elected five terms as Senator. He first took office in December 1982 and served three terms, retiring from the Senate in 2001. Called upon to run again one year later due to circumstances surrounding his Senate colleague Robert Torricelli&#x27;s re-election campaign, Lautenberg returned to the Senate in January 2003 and was elected to one additional term in 2008. He died during his fifth term and remains New Jersey&#x27;s longest serving senator, with a total of 28 years, 5 months and 8 days in office.

Before entering politics, he was an early partner in, and became the chairman and chief executive officer of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. In his early years, he served overseas in the U.S. Army Signal Corps from 1942 to 1946 as a part of the war effort, and after returning home his interest in American political events increased. He has been called &quot;the last of the New Deal liberals&quot; and was known for his legislative efforts against drunk driving, and his support of spending for Amtrak and urban public transportation, for stronger environmental regulations, greater consumer protections, and investigations of wrongdoing by Wall Street.

== Early life and career ==
Lautenberg was born in Paterson, New Jersey, the son of Mollie (née Bergen) and Sam Lautenberg, Jewish immigrants from Poland and Russia, who had arrived in the United States as infants. He was named after his maternal grandfather, Frank Bergen, and close family friend and Paterson community activist, Raleigh Weintrob.

When Lautenberg was 19, his father, who worked in silk mills, sold coal, farmed, and once ran a tavern, died of cancer. His mother then opened a sandwich shop to support the family.

After graduating from Nutley High School in 1941, Lautenberg served overseas in the United States Army Signal Corps during World War II from 1942 to 1946. Then, financed by the GI Bill, he attended and graduated from Columbia Business School&#x27;s now-defunct undergraduate program in 1949 with a degree in economics.

He worked as a salesman for Prudential Insurance and was the first salesman at Automatic Data Processing (ADP), a payroll-management company. He became the company&#x27;s CEO in 1975.

He was the executive commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey from 1978 to 1982.

Lautenberg also served in roles with a number of Jewish and pro-Israel organizations, including as a member of the Jewish Agency for Israel&#x27;s board of governors and as president of the American Friends of the Hebrew University. In 1974, he became the youngest chair ever in the history of the United Jewish Appeal. Within a year Lautenberg had increased its charitable intake to the second-highest level in its history. He was also named to the President&#x27;s Commission on the Holocaust in the late 1970s.

== U.S. Senator ==
=== Early years ===
Lautenberg contributed to Democratic candidates for years. He donated $90,000 to George McGovern&#x27;s campaign for president in 1972, earning himself a place on one of Richard Nixon&#x27;s enemies lists. In 1982, he ran for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. He faced nine other candidates: former State Banking Commissioner Angelo Bianchi, former Morristown Mayor Donald Cresitello, former Congressman Joseph A. LeFante, labor leader Frank Forst, former Congressman Andrew Maguire, Richard McAleer, businessman Howard Rosen, Princeton Mayor Barbara Boggs Sigmund, and Passaic County Freeholder Cyril Yannarelli. Maguire was the favorite but Boggs&#x27; entry took votes away from him and Lautenberg spent a considerable amount of his own money. Lautenberg won with a plurality, taking 26% of the vote to Maguire&#x27;s 23%, LeFante&#x27;s 20% and Sigmund&#x27;s 11%.

The seat had been occupied by Democrat Harrison A. Williams, who resigned on March 11, 1982, after being implicated in the Abscam scandal. After Williams&#x27; resignation, Republican Governor Thomas Kean appointed Republican Nicholas F. Brady to the seat. Brady served in the Senate through the primary and general elections but did not run for the seat himself. In the general election, Lautenberg faced popular Republican congresswoman Millicent Fenwick. She ran on a very progressive platform and polls in the Summer of 1982 put her ahead by 18 points. Even Lautenberg quipped that she was &quot;the most popular candidate in the country.&quot; Lautenberg spent more of his own money, eventually out-spending Fenwick two-to-one. He emphasised President Reagan&#x27;s unpopularity, reminded the voters that she would be a vote for a Republican majority in the Senate and called Fenwick, who was 72, &quot;eccentric&quot; and &quot;erratic&quot; but denied that he was referring to her age. He did however point out that she would be almost 80 at the end of her first term and was therefore unlikely to gain much seniority in the Senate. Lautenberg won by 51% to 48%, in what was considered a major upset. Brady, who had just a few days left in his appointed term, resigned on December 27, 1982, allowing Lautenberg to take office several days before the traditional swearing-in of senators, which gave him an edge in seniority over the other freshman senators.

In his first term, Lautenberg pushed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which was passed in 1984. The same year, he spoke at the Democratic National Convention, though he was overshadowed by New York Governor Mario Cuomo, who gave the keynote speech.

In the 1988 election, Lautenberg was opposed by Republican Wall Street executive, former college football star Brigadier General Pete Dawkins, who won the 1958 Heisman Trophy for the Army Black Knights. After trailing in early polls, the Lautenberg campaign, headed by Democratic consultant James Carville, ran an aggressive advertising campaign enumerating Lautenberg&#x27;s legislative accomplishments and raising the possibility that Dawkins&#x27; candidacy was intended solely as a stepping stone to the presidency, as well as pointing out his lack of roots in New Jersey. Lautenberg ultimately came from behind to win re-election, 54% to 46%. The race was named the 17th-nastiest in American political history by political scientist Kerwin Swint in his book &quot;Mudslingers: The 25 Dirtiest Political Campaigns of All Time&quot;.

Following his re-election, Lautenberg became a member of the President&#x27;s Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism (PCAST), which was set up in September 1989 to review and report on aviation security policy in light of the sabotage of Pan Am Flight 103 on December 21, 1988.

After Boris Perchatkin’s speeches in the US Congress in 1989 along with Representative Bruce Morrison, Lautenberg was a primary sponsor of what became known as the Lautenberg Amendment, which first passed in 1989. The amendment granted presumptive refugee status to Jewish people and members of other groups from the Soviet Union, and facilitated the emigration of hundreds of thousands of Jews to the United States.

Lautenberg was re-elected in the 1994 Republican Revolution, defeating New Jersey State Assembly Speaker Chuck Haytaian by 50% to 47%.

In 1999, two popular Republicans were considering running against Lautenberg: the incumbent Governor Christine Todd Whitman and former Governor Thomas Kean. Polling showed Lautenberg trailing both of them. Lautenberg also did not get along with his New Jersey Senate colleague Robert Torricelli, and suspected that he was encouraging Whitman to run against him. Torricelli&#x27;s relationship with Lautenberg had been very rocky, especially when Lautenberg directly accused Torricelli of encouraging Whitman to challenge him for his Senate seat. Lautenberg raised his concerns in a meeting with Democratic senators in 1999, and Torricelli responded by shouting, &quot;You&#x27;re a fucking piece of shit, and I&#x27;m going to cut your balls off!&quot; Lautenberg was also less than enthusiastic at the prospect of fundraising for a grueling campaign, and did not want to have to spend more of his own money.

He announced his retirement in 2000, but denied it was because he thought he would lose to Whitman or Kean, saying that he had been vulnerable in previous elections, and, &quot;Mr. Vulnerable always wins.&quot; His fellow Democrat and businessman, Jon Corzine, was elected to replace him.

=== 2002 election ===
Almost immediately, Lautenberg regretted his decision, especially after neither Whitman nor Kean ran against Corzine in the general election (instead, Congressman Bob Franks ran for the seat, and was defeated). He also was said to be missing his days working in the Senate. He had considered reversing his decision and running for re-election, but since his rival, Senator Torricelli, had encouraged Corzine to run in the first place, Lautenberg would likely have had trouble restarting his campaign. A little over a year after he left office, however, Lautenberg found an opening.

In the 2002 primaries leading up to the midterm elections. Torricelli won the Democratic nomination for a second term in the Senate. The Republican candidate was Doug Forrester, the mayor of West Windsor Township. It was expected that Torricelli would win the election by a significant margin, as no Republican had won election from New Jersey since Clifford P. Case was elected to his final six-year term in 1972 in the seat Torricelli was currently occupying. However, an ongoing investigation into the Senator&#x27;s activities and business dealings resulted in federal corruption charges being filed against him before the election. The subsequent drop in voter support in the weeks that followed resulted in Torricelli&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the race on September 30, 2002.

After overtures were made to retired Senator Bill Bradley, Congressman Frank Pallone, and future Senator Robert Menendez to take over as candidate, the New Jersey Democratic Party called upon Lautenberg and he accepted the nomination. This was met with an almost immediate challenge by Forrester and the Republicans as New Jersey law forbade the replacement of candidates on the ballot after a certain deadline. The ballot name change was unanimously upheld by the New Jersey Supreme Court, who cited that the law, as written, did not consider the possibility for an emergency resignation and said that Forrester would have an unfair advantage if Torricelli was left on the ballot. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case. With the popular Lautenberg now in the race, Forrester&#x27;s lead in the polls evaporated and Lautenberg won the election by a 54% to 44% margin.

=== Back in the Senate ===

Despite having served over 18 years in the Senate, upon Lautenberg&#x27;s return he was treated like other freshman senators with respect to seniority. This was despite the fact that he had agreed to run for office with the implicit understanding that Democratic leader Tom Daschle would allow him to retain seniority and serve on the Appropriations Committee. He was reported to have been upset with his treatment and commented that &quot;when you come down from a relatively lofty position of seniority, the atmosphere is different&quot;, having been given one of the least prestigious office spaces behind a fire exit door.

Back in the Senate, Lautenberg was once again considered one of the chamber&#x27;s most liberal members. He was pro-choice, supported gun control, introduced many bills increasing penalties for carjacking and car theft, and criticized the Bush administration on national security issues. He was heavily involved in various anti-smoking and airline safety legislation. He also co-sponsored legislation to increase drunk driving penalties. He was probably best known as the author of the legislation that banned smoking from most commercial airline flights. He also is known for authoring the Ryan White Care Act, which provides services to AIDS patients. Upon his return to the Senate, Lautenberg was the first U.S. senator to introduce legislation calling for homeland security funds to be distributed solely on the basis of risk and vulnerability.

In 2005, he became a leading voice within the Senate in calling for an investigation into the Bush administration payment of columnists.

When Jon Corzine resigned from the Senate to become Governor of New Jersey, Lautenberg became the senior senator again in 2006. This also made him the only person to have been both the junior and senior senator from New Jersey twice each. Lautenberg received an &quot;A&quot; on the Drum Major Institute&#x27;s 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.

In 2007, Lautenberg proposed the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2007, designed to deny weapons purchases by persons that the government has placed on the terrorist watchlist. On June 21, 2007, Lautenberg passed Clifford Case for the most votes on the Senate floor of any United States Senator in New Jersey history.

=== 2008 election ===

In February 2006, Lautenberg announced his intention to run for re-election in 2008, saying that deciding not to run for re-election in 2000 &quot;was among the worst decisions of his life.&quot; Lautenberg formally announced his candidacy on March 31, 2008. His campaign manager was Brendan W. Gill.

Congressman Steve Rothman and State Senator John Adler both mooted the possibility of running, but said they would defer to Lautenberg. In private he called them &quot;the pallbearers&quot;. Ultimately, both declined to run. Instead, Congressman Rob Andrews announced he would challenge Lautenberg for renomination in the Democratic primary. Also running was Morristown Mayor Donald Cresitello, who had run against Lautenberg in the 1982 Senate primary. Andrews ran a poor campaign, &quot;best remembered—if it&#x27;s remembered at all—for its ineptness.&quot; He was also tarred with his vote for the Iraq War. Lautenberg&#x27;s New Jersey Senate colleague Bob Menendez also came to his aid and Lautenberg defeated Andrews 59% to 35% in the June 3 primary. He then defeated former Congressman Dick Zimmer in the general election 56% to 42%.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial board endorsed Mr. Lautenberg&#x27;s candidacy for Senate during the 2008 cycle.

Both opponents cited Lautenberg&#x27;s age among reasons to vote against him. Andrews, for example, referenced Lautenberg&#x27;s own 1982 defeat of Millicent Fenwick, in which Lautenberg was alleged to have referred to Fenwick&#x27;s age (Fenwick was 72 at the time; Lautenberg was 84 in 2008). Lautenberg denied he made Fenwick&#x27;s age an issue, saying he only ever questioned Fenwick&#x27;s &quot;ability to do the job.&quot;

=== Final years ===
In June 2010, Lautenberg compared the devil with Dubai. Lautenberg was quoted as stating, &quot;We wouldn&#x27;t transfer the title to the devil, and we&#x27;re not going to transfer it to Dubai.&quot; According to a Foreign Policy in Focus article, Lautenberg defended his remarks due to the UAE&#x27;s refusal to support U.S. policy toward Israel and Iran. According to the Arab American Institute, Lautenberg apologized in a letter upon meeting with Arab American Institute representatives.

On February 14, 2013, Lautenberg announced he would not seek re-election. In the press conference, Lautenberg joked &quot;Is it too late to change my mind?&quot; and joked that he would pray &quot;something goes wrong&quot; so he could be called on to run again.

At the time of his death from viral pneumonia at age 89, Lautenberg was the oldest serving senator and the last remaining World War II veteran in the Senate.

== Political positions and votes ==
* Agriculture In 2007, Lautenberg voted for an amendment to the 2007 farm bill which would have limited the amount of subsidies that a married couple could receive to $250,000; the amendment failed. However, he voted against eliminating farm price supports and eventually voted for the 2007 farm bill as well. He supported increasing the minimum wage.
* Civil liberties Lautenberg was not in the Senate at the time of the original Patriot Act in 2001; when the 2005 re-authorization came to the Senate floor, Lautenberg voted against cloture, but voted in favor of accepting the conference report. In March 2011, he stated to an assembled group of constituents that Tea Party Republicans &quot;don&#x27;t deserve the freedoms that are in the Constitution ... but we&#x27;ll give them to them anyway&quot;.
* Environment and energy Lautenberg, who had a pro-environment voting record, wrote a bill in 1986 that established the Toxics Release Inventory, which required companies to disclose the chemicals they released into the environment. He also co-sponsored the Consumer First Energy Act of 2008, which would have repealed $17 billion in tax breaks for oil companies and re-invested the $17 billion in renewable energy development and energy efficiency technology. However, the Senate rejected a cloture motion on the bill in June 2008. One of his main priorities in his final term was a bill he authored with Republican Senator David Vitter that would overhaul chemical safety laws. Lautenberg favored alternative energy sources, and voted in favor of giving tax incentives to those who use them.
* Foreign policy In 1996, Lautenberg voted against a bill that eliminated the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the United States Information Agency, the Agency for International Development, and the International Development Cooperation Agency and allowed the President to withhold 20% of funds appropriated to the United Nations if any agency of the organization does not implement consensus-based decision-making procedures on budgetary matters that assure that significant attention is given to the specific interests of the United States. He opposed capping foreign aid, and voted to give billions of dollars to the International Monetary Fund. He voted against implementing both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Central American Free Trade Agreement. He called for action to be taken at the World Trade Organization against members of the OPEC cartel which sets production quotas that raise prices for crude oil, and consequently, America&#x27;s gasoline. Lautenberg was an opponent of the Iraq War, though he was not in office when it was voted on.
* Gun control Lautenberg was a consistent supporter of gun control. He sponsored the Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban, more commonly known as the &quot;Lautenberg Amendment&quot;. This piece of legislation prohibits individuals (including law enforcement officers and military service members), convicted of a state or federal misdemeanor involving the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, among family members, from possessing a firearm. One of his last speeches on the Senate floor was in support of a failed bi-partisan measure for increased gun control.
* Homeland security Lautenberg was a proponent of the Container Security Initiative which would screen cargo containers bound for the United States for radiological contents. This policy is intended to identify threats before they arrive at U.S. ports. The Bush administration argued that the policy would be too expensive to implement, as U.S. inspection teams, with equipment, would need to be installed in 700 foreign ports.
* Public health In 1984, Lautenberg wrote the National Minimum Drinking Age Act that set the national drinking age at 21. In 2000, his legislation set 0.08 as the blood alcohol level threshold for drunk driving. He also wrote legislation that banned smoking on airplanes, in federal buildings, and in federally-funded buildings that serviced children.
* Social issues Lautenberg was pro-choice on abortion, and voted against banning &quot;partial-birth abortions&quot; in 1999. He voted in favor of expanding embryonic stem cell research. The NAACP gave him a 100% rating, indicating his strong support for affirmative action.Lautenberg was a strong supporter of same-sex marriage, and also voted to prohibit job discrimination based on sexual orientation and to expand the federal definition of hate crimes to include sexual orientation. He voted against a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, and expressed his support for equal marriage rights for LGBT couples in later years. Lautenberg did, however, vote in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. The Human Rights Campaign gave him a 100% rating, indicating his strong support for LGBT rights. Lautenberg also cosponsored a bill in 2012 that would have removed the deadline for the Equal Rights Amendment and a new attempt for the ERA in 2013.
* Tax policy Lautenberg voted against repealing and restricting the Alternative Minimum Tax and the estate tax. Lautenberg voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which contained $280 billion in tax breaks by expanding the earned income tax credit, child tax credit, home energy credit, and college credit, introducing a homebuyer credit and a credit for workers earning less than $75,000, along with an increased ceiling for the AMT and extended tax credits to companies for renewable energy production, along with a new policy making more companies eligible for a certain tax refund. In 2008, he voted to raise taxes on those earning more than $1 million per year. In 2006, he voted in favor of repealing the Bush-era tax cut on capital gains.
* Transportation Lautenberg supported federal funding of public transportation, such as Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. Lautenberg was primary sponsor of the S.294 [110th] &quot;Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008&quot; (Full Text), which would fund Amtrak for the next five years and provide opportunity for expansion. With the dramatic rise of gasoline prices from 2007 to 2008, Amtrak ridership has reached record levels. The bill passed the House, but Senate and House differences were never resolved. He was also a strong supporter of the commuter rail project Access to the Region&#x27;s Core. When New Jersey Governor Chris Christie cancelled the project, Lautenberg called his move &quot;one of the biggest public-policy blunders in New Jersey history&quot;, and said that, &quot;All he knows how to do is blow hot air.&quot; The Frank R. Lautenberg Rail Station at Secaucus Junction was dedicated in 2003 with his name, because he helped allocate federal funds to build it.
* Miscellaneous Since the advent of the late 2000s recession, Lautenberg supported a number of Democratic bills designed to deal with the resulting problems plaguing Americans. In 2009, he voted in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, popularly dubbed the stimulus bill. He later voted for the Credit Cardholders&#x27; Bill of Rights and the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
Frank Lautenberg married Lois Levenson in 1956, with whom he had four children: Ellen, Nan, Lisa, and Joshua. Their 31-year marriage ended in divorce, in 1988. On 25 January 2004, he married his companion of nearly 16 years, Bonnie S. Englebardt. He also had two stepdaughters, Danielle Englebardt and Lara Englebardt Metz with Bonnie; and 13 grandchildren.

Lautenberg resided in Montclair, New Jersey for much of his Senate career and last resided in nearby Cliffside Park. In 2024, Lautenberg was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden, a Senate colleague for over two decades.

=== Health ===
On February 19, 2010, his office announced that Lautenberg had been diagnosed with a diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (an aggressive but curable blood cancer that appears in organs like the stomach) at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. He had been hospitalized with profuse gastric bleeding following a fall in his Cliffside Park, New Jersey, home shortly after returning from a Haiti trip with a 12-member congressional delegation. He was released from the hospital on February 25, 2010. Six to eight chemotherapy treatments of the intensive R-CHOP regimen followed every 21 days over several months, and a doctor for Lautenberg at the time said a full recovery was expected. Lautenberg continued his Senate work between treatments. On June 26, 2010, the senator announced that he was cancer-free.

=== Wealth ===
In 2010, Lautenberg&#x27;s wealth was estimated to be between $55 million and $116.1 million, making him the fifth-wealthiest Senator. Lautenberg began collecting modern art after his election to the Senate, much of which was sold after his death.

== Death ==

Lautenberg died at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan on June 3, 2013, of viral pneumonia. He was 89.

Lautenberg was returned to Washington by an Amtrak funeral train. &quot;Amtrak is honored to be chosen to carry him back to Washington, D.C. one final time,&quot; wrote Amtrak Chairman Tony Cosica and President/CEO Joseph Boardman in a joint public statement of condolence, &quot;thank you Sen. Lautenberg for your service to the nation.&quot;

On June 6, 2013, his body lay in repose atop the Lincoln Catafalque within the Senate chamber at the Capitol. He was buried on June 7, 2013, with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

Congress passed on September 20, 2013, a spending bill, H.J.Res.59 – Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014, that included a $174,000 tax-free death benefit payment to his widow. An annual salary payment to the widow or family member of a deceased lawmaker is a long-standing tradition for the United States Congress going back to the 1800s.

== Succession ==
On June 4, 2013, Governor Chris Christie announced that a special election to fill the vacant Senate seat would be held on October 16, 2013. A special primary, which was won by Cory Booker as the Democrat and Steve Lonegan as the Republican candidate, was held on August 13, 2013.

On June 6, 2013, Christie appointed Republican New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa to fill the Senate seat until the elected winner could be sworn in.

On October 17, 2013, Democrat Cory Booker was announced the winner of the special election. He has held the seat ever since.

<text>The 4th Infantry Division is a division of the United States Army based at Fort Carson, Colorado. It is composed of a division headquarters battalion, three brigade combat teams (two Stryker and one armor), a combat aviation brigade, a division sustainment brigade, and a division artillery.

The 4th Infantry Division&#x27;s official nickname, &quot;Ivy&quot;, is a play on words of the Roman numeral &quot;IV&quot; or 4. Ivy leaves symbolize tenacity and fidelity which is the basis of the division&#x27;s motto: &quot;Steadfast and Loyal&quot;. The second nickname, &quot;Iron Horse&quot;, has been adopted to underscore the speed and power of the division and its soldiers.

==World War I==
On 19 November 1917, about seven months after American entry into World War I on 6 April 1917, the War Department directed the organization of the 4th Division at Camp Greene, North Carolina, around a cadre of Regular Army troops that had been stationed at Camp Greene, the Presidio of Monterey, California, Vancouver Barracks, Washington, and other posts. It was at Camp Greene where the division originally adopted its distinctive insignia of four ivy leaves. The ivy leaf came from the Roman numerals for four (IV) and signified their motto &quot;Steadfast and Loyal.&quot;

On 10 December 1917, Major General George H. Cameron assumed command. At the end of December, with 13,000 men, systematic training began. During and subsequent to the latter part of February 1918, men who had been inducted from all sections of the United States are sent to the division, while from 1-21 March, drafts aggregating 10,000 men from Camps Custer, Michigan, Camp Grant, Illinois, Camp Lewis, Washington, Camp Pike, Arkansas, and Camp Travis, Texas, completed the division. The division sailed overseas from late April to early June 1918.

===St. Mihiel Offensive===
For the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, the division moved into an area south of Verdun as part of the First United States Army. General John Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) on the Western Front, had gotten the French and British to agree that the AEF would fight under its own organizational elements. One of the first missions assigned to the AEF was the reduction of the Saint-Mihiel salient. The 4th Division, assigned to V Corps, was on the western face of the salient. The plan was for V Corps to push generally southeast and to meet IV Corps who was pushing northwest, thereby trapping the Germans in the St. Mihiel area.

The 59th Infantry Regiment moved into an area previously occupied by the French, deploying along a nine kilometer front. On 12 September, the first patrols were sent forward by the 59th. The 4th Division attack began on 14 September with the 8th Brigade capturing the town of Manheulles. All along the front, the American forces pressed forward and closed the St. Mihiel salient.

===Occupation duty===

Under the terms of the Armistice, Germany was to evacuate all territory west of the Rhine. American troops were to relocate to the center section of this previously German-occupied area all the way to the Koblenz bridgehead on the Rhine. The 4th marched into Germany, covering 330 miles in 15 days where it was widely dispersed over an area with Bad Bertrich as division headquarters. The division established training for the men as well as sports and educational activities. In April 1919 the division moved to a new occupation area further north on the Rhine.

The division went north to Ahrweiler, Germany, in the Rheinland-Pfalz area. In July the division returned to France and the last detachment sailed for the United States on 31 July 1919.

==Interwar period==

The 4th Division arrived at Camp Merritt, New Jersey, on 1 August 1919, after completing 8 months of occupation duty near and in Bad Bertrich and Bad Breisig, Germany. Emergency period personnel were discharged from the service at Camp Merritt after arrival. The division proceeded to Camp Dodge, Iowa, and arrived 8 August. The division took up temporary station until January 1920, when it was transferred to Camp Lewis, Washington, for permanent station.

As a part of the War Department&#x27;s decision to maintain only three fully-active stateside infantry divisions, the 4th Division was inactivated on 21 September 1921, less the 8th Infantry Brigade and several other divisional elements. The remaining division personnel and equipment were transferred to the 3rd Division. Concurrently, the inactive units were assigned to &quot;active associate&quot; units for mobilization purposes; the active associate units would provide the cadre from which the inactive units would be formed in the event of war. For mobilization responsibility, the division was allotted to the Fourth Corps Area and assigned to the IV Corps. Camp McClellan, Alabama, was designated as the mobilization and training station for the division upon reactivation. During the period 1921–39, the 4th Division was represented by the 8th Infantry Brigade and other assorted active elements, which formed the base force from which the division would be reactivated in the event of war. In 1926, the War Department abandoned the active associate concept and authorized the manning of inactive Regular Army units with Organized Reserve personnel. The division headquarters was organized by June 1927 as a &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; (RAI) unit at Fort McPherson, Georgia, and many of the inactive elements of the division were also organized as such after mid-1927.

The RAI units generally trained with the active elements of the division during summer training camps. Several units, such as the 4th Signal Company, 4th Engineer Regiment, and the 39th Infantry Regiment, were affiliated with various colleges and universities the sponsored the Reserve Officers Training Corps and organized as RAI units with the Regular Army cadre and commissionees from the schools’ programs. The active elements of the division also maintained habitual training relationships with many Organized Reserve units in the Fourth Corps Area, including the IV Corps, XIV Corps, and the 81st, 82nd, and 87th Divisions. The training of the Reserve units was usually conducted at Camp McClellan, and frequently, at the regimental home stations of 4th Division units. The 8th and 22nd Infantry Regiments also supported the Reserve units’ conduct of the Citizens Military Training Camps held at Camp McClellan and Fort McPherson. The 8th Infantry Brigade, reinforced by the active elements of the 4th Tank Company, 83rd Field Artillery Regiment, and 4th Engineer Regiment held annual maneuvers at Fort Benning, Georgia.

The division headquarters was occasionally formed in a provisional status during summer camps or command post exercises (CPXs) to train Regular and Reserve officers in division-level command and control procedures. It was provisionally formed on 5 September 1936 for the Third Army CPX held that month at Camp Bullis, Texas. The division headquarters was also provisionally formed for the August 1938 Third Army Maneuvers in the DeSoto National Forest in Mississippi. For that maneuver, the division (8th Infantry Brigade as the nucleus) was reinforced by the 17th Ordnance Company, a detachment of the 51st Signal Battalion, and the Georgia National Guard’s 122nd Infantry Regiment, in addition to the active divisional elements.

==World War II==

The 4th Division was reactivated on 1 June 1940 at Fort Benning, Georgia, under the command of Major General Walter Prosser. Commencing the summer of 1941, the formation was reorganized as a motorized division for the upcoming Louisiana Maneuvers, and assigned (along with the 2nd Armored Division) to I Armored Corps. It was first given its motorized title in parenthesized style, and then as the “4th Motorized Division” effective 11 July 1941. The division participated in the Louisiana Maneuvers held during August–September 1941 and then in the Carolina Maneuvers of October–November 1941, after which it returned to Fort Benning. The division transferred to Camp Gordon, Georgia, in December 1941, the month America entered World War II, and rehearsed training at the Carolina Maneuver Area during the summer of 1942.

The division, now under the command of Major General Raymond O. Barton, then moved on 12 April 1943 to Fort Dix, New Jersey, where it reorganized as a standard infantry division and was redesignated the 4th Infantry Division on 4 August of that year. The division participated in battlefield maneuvers and instruction in Florida starting in September and after this fall training exercise arrived at Camp Jackson, South Carolina, on 1 December 1943. At this station the division was alerted for overseas movement and staged at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, beginning 4 January 1944 prior to departing the New York Port of Embarkation on 18 January 1944. The 4th Infantry Division sailed to England where it arrived on 26 January 1944.

===France===
The 4th Infantry Division assaulted the northern coast of German-held France during the Normandy landings, landing at Utah Beach, 6 June 1944. The 8th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division claimed being the first surface-borne Allied unit (as opposed to the parachutist formations that were air-dropped earlier) to hit the beaches at Normandy on D-Day, 6 June 1944. Relieving the isolated 82nd Airborne Division at Sainte-Mère-Église, the 4th cleared the Cotentin peninsula and took part in the capture of Cherbourg on 25 June. After taking part in the fighting near Periers, 6–12 July, the division broke through the left flank of the German 7th Army, helping to stem the German drive toward Avranches.

By the end of August the division had moved to Paris, and gave French forces the first place in the liberation of their capital. During the liberation of Paris, Ernest Hemingway took on a self-appointed role as a civilian scout in the city of Paris for his friends in the 4 ID. He was with the 22nd Infantry Regiment when it advanced from Paris, northeast through Belgium, and into Germany. J. D. Salinger, who met Hemingway during the liberation of Paris, was with the 12th Infantry Regiment.

===Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany===
The 4th then moved into Belgium through Houffalize to attack the Siegfried Line at Schnee Eifel on 14 September, and made several penetrations. Slow progress into Germany continued in October, and by 6 November the division entered the Battle of Hurtgen Forest, where it was engaged in heavy fighting until early December. It then shifted to Luxembourg, only to meet the German Army&#x27;s winter Ardennes Offensive head-on (in the Battle of the Bulge) starting on 16 December 1944. Although its lines were dented, it managed to hold the Germans at Dickweiler and Osweiler, and, counterattacking in January across the Sauer, overran German positions in Fouhren and Vianden.

Halted at the Prüm River in February by heavy enemy resistance, the division finally crossed on 28 February near Olzheim, and raced on across the Kyll on 7 March. After a short rest, the 4th moved across the Rhine on 29 March at Worms, attacked and secured Würzburg and by 3 April had established a bridgehead across the Main at Ochsenfurt. Speeding southeast across Bavaria, the division had reached Miesbach on the Isar on 2 May 1945, when it was relieved and placed on occupation duty. Writer J. D. Salinger served with the division from 1942–1945.

==Post War/Early Cold War==
The division returned to the United States in July 1945 and was stationed at Camp Butner North Carolina, preparing for deployment to the Pacific. After the war ended it was deactivated on 5 March 1946. It was reactivated as a training division at Fort Ord, California on 15 July 1947.

On 1 October 1950, it was redesignated a combat division, training at Fort Benning, Georgia. In May 1951 it deployed to Germany as the first of four United States divisions committed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization during the early years of the Cold War. The division headquarters was at Frankfurt. After a five-year tour in Germany, the division redeployed to Fort Lewis, Washington in May 1956.

The division was replaced in Germany by the 3rd Armored Division as part of an Operation Gyroscope deployment. The division was reduced to zero strength, the colors were transferred to Fort Lewis, Washington, and the division was reestablished by reflagging the 71st Infantry Division (which itself had just returned from Alaska) on 15 September 1956.

On 1 April 1957, the division was reorganized as a Pentomic Division. The division&#x27;s three infantry regiments (the 8th, 12th and 22nd) were inactivated, with their elements reorganized into five infantry battle groups (the 1-8 IN, 1-12 IN, 1-22 IN, 2-39 IN and the 2-47 IN).
On 1 October 1963, the division was reorganized as a Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD). Three Brigade Headquarters were activated and Infantry units were reorganized into battalions.

The 6th Tank Battalion of the 2d Armored Division, Fort Hood, Texas, was sent to Korea during the war to serve with the 24th Infantry Division. The lineages of the tank companies within the battalion are perpetuated by battalions of today&#x27;s 66th and 67th Armor Regiments in the 4th Infantry Division.

==Vietnam War==
The 4th Infantry Division deployed from Fort Lewis to Camp Enari, Pleiku, Vietnam on 25 September 1966 (The 2nd Brigade actually deployed on 21 July and arrived in Vietnam on August 2nd aboard the Nelson M Walker and was flown to Pleiku) and served more than four years, returning to Fort Carson, Colorado on 8 December 1970. Two brigades operated in the Central Highlands/II Corps Zone, but its 3rd Brigade, including the division&#x27;s armor battalion, was sent to Tây Ninh Province northwest of Saigon to take part in Operation Attleboro (September to November 1966), and later Operation Junction City (February to May 1967), both in War Zone C. After nearly a year of combat, the 3rd Brigade&#x27;s battalions officially became part of the 25th Infantry Division in exchange for the battalions of the 25th&#x27;s 3rd Brigade, then in Quảng Ngãi Province as part of the division-sized Task Force Oregon.

=== Deployment table 1966–1970 ===

Throughout its service in Vietnam the division conducted combat operations ranging from the western Central Highlands along the border between Cambodia and Vietnam to Qui Nhơn on the South China Sea. The division experienced intense combat against People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam regular forces in the mountains surrounding Kontum in the autumn of 1967. The division&#x27;s 3rd Brigade was withdrawn from Vietnam in April 1970 and inactivated at Fort Lewis.

In May the remainder of the division conducted cross-border operations during the Cambodian Incursion. The division then moved to An Khe. The &quot;Ivy Division&quot; returned from Vietnam on 7 December 1970, and was rejoined in Fort Carson by its former 3rd Brigade from Hawaii, where it had re-deployed as part of the withdrawal of the 25th Infantry Division. One battalion remained in Vietnam as a separate organization until January 1972.

==Post Vietnam/Late Cold War and REFORGER==

Returning to the US, the division resumed training and Cold War missions. The division remained stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado from 1970 through 1995. During this period, the division was converted to a mechanized infantry division, and frequently sent constituent units to Europe to participate in the annual REFORGER exercises to continue the Cold War mission of deterring Communist threats. In 1976 the division&#x27;s 4th Brigade was established and permanently stationed forward at Wiesbaden, West Germany as Brigade 76, remaining there until being inactivated in 1984. It was during their time in Fort Carson that the division assumed the nickname, &quot;Ironhorse&quot;.

==Force XXI==
In December 1995, the Ivy Division was reflagged at Ft Hood, Tx when the 2nd Armored Division was deactivated as part of the downsizing of the Army. One of the brigades remained at Ft Carson as 3rd Brigade 4th Infantry Division stationed at Ft Carson. The division became an experimental division of the Army, as it had been in the early 1940s. Until completing the mission in October 2001, 4ID led the Army into the 21st century under Force XXI, the Army&#x27;s modernization program. The division tested and fielded state-of-the-art digital communications equipment, night fighting gear, advanced weaponry, organization, and doctrine to prepare the Army for the future.

From 1989 to 1996 the 116th Cavalry Brigade of the Idaho and Oregon Army National Guard served as roundout brigade of the division.

==Iraq War==
Alerted on 19 January 2003, the 4th Infantry Division was scheduled to take part in the Iraq War in the spring of 2003 by spearheading an advance from Turkey into northern Iraq. The deployment was going to involve over 80,000 troops. The Turkish Parliament refused to grant permission for the operation and the division&#x27;s equipment remained offshore on ships during the buildup for the war. Its original mission, holding 13 Iraqi divisions along the &quot;Green Line&quot; in northern Iraq, was executed by joint Task Force Viking.

The Turkish refusal to allow entrance to Turkey kept the division from participating in the invasion as originally planned, instead joining the fight as a follow-on force. After quickly organizing materiel and manpower at ports in Kuwait, the division moved to positions around Baghdad in April 2003. After all divisional assets were established in Iraq, the brigade combat teams attacked selected areas. The main avenues of attack for the division pushed north through Tikrit and Mosul. Headquartered in Saddam Hussein&#x27;s former palaces, the 4th ID was deployed in the northern area of the Sunni Triangle. The 4th Infantry Division was spread all over Northern Iraq from Kirkuk to the Iranian border and as far south as Al Wihda, southeast of Baghdad.

The division headquarters was located at FOB Ironhorse in the old Saddam Presidential Complex in Tikrit, while the 1st Brigade Combat Team headquarters was at FOB Raider south of the city. To the south in the volatile Diyala Province was the 2nd Brigade Combat Team headquarters at FOB Warhorse just northeast of Baqubah. The 3rd Brigade Combat Team was at FOB Anaconda at the Balad Air Base northwest of Khalis and DIVARTY, along with elements of the 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery Regiment at FOB Gunner, Al Taji airfield. To the far north stationed at an air field just on the outskirts of the city of Kirkuk were elements of the division&#x27;s 4th Artillery Brigade and attached units, until mid-September when it was moved back to Tikrit. The 4th Infantry Division also disarmed the MEK warriors in Northern Iraq in July–August 2003.

On 13 December 2003, elements of the 1st Brigade Combat Team participated in Operation Red Dawn with United States special operations forces, who captured Saddam Hussein, former President of Iraq.

The division rotated out of Iraq in the spring of 2004, and was relieved by the 1st Infantry Division.

Some have been critical of the division under its then-commander Maj. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, calling its stance belligerent during their initial entry into Iraq after the ground war had ceased and arguing that the unit&#x27;s lack of a &#x27;hearts and minds&#x27; approach was ineffective in quelling the insurgency. In his unit&#x27;s defense, Odierno and others have argued that enemy activity in the 4th ID&#x27;s area of operations was higher than in any other area of the country because of the region&#x27;s high concentration of Sunni resistance groups still loyal to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime. His unit was headquartered in Hussein&#x27;s hometown and this environment necessitated a different approach from those of units located in the more peaceful regions in the south and the north of the country.

===Subsequent Iraq Deployments===
The division&#x27;s second deployment to Iraq began in the fall of 2005. The division headquarters replaced the 3rd Infantry Division, which had been directing security operations as the headquarters for Multi-National Division – Baghdad. The 4th ID assumed responsibility on 7 January 2006 for four provinces in central and southern Iraq: Baghdad, Karbala, An-Najaf and Babil. On 7 January 2006, MND-Baghdad also assumed responsibility for training Iraqi security forces and conducting security operations in the four provinces.

During the second deployment, 3rd Brigade of the 4th Infantry Division area of operation (AO) was Saladin and Diala provinces and was assigned to conduct security and training operations under the command of Task Force Band of Brothers, led initially by the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and later 25th Infantry Division Headquartered out of FOB Warhorse. Later during the third deployment the unit was involved in the 2008 Battle of Sadr City.

In March 2008 the 1st Brigade Combat Team deployed to Iraq and was stationed in Baghdad. The 1st Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment was detached from the brigade and attached to the 4th Brigade, 10th Mountain Division which was stationed at FOB Rustamiyah in Al Amin, Baghdad. The brigade returned home to Fort Hood, Texas in March 2009 and immediately began preparing for reassignment to Fort Carson, Colorado.

In these three deployments to Iraq:
*84 4ID/Task Force Ironhorse soldiers were killed in 2003–2004
*235 4ID/Multi-National Division – Baghdad soldiers lost their lives in 2005–2006
*113 4ID/Multi-National Division – Baghdad soldiers were killed in 2007–2009

July 2009 saw another division change of command as MG David Perkins took command to become the 56th Commanding General of the 4th Infantry Division. With this change of command, even more significant events happened as the 4ID completed 14 years calling Fort Hood, TX home and returned to Fort Carson, CO, where they had served from late 1970 through late 1995. It was at this time that the 4th Division headquarters and the 1st Brigade Combat Team transferred to Fort Carson, Colorado. The 2nd, and 4th Brigades had already relocated and 3rd Brigade was already at Fort Carson having never moved to Fort Hood and the 4th Infantry Division&#x27;s Aviation Brigade stayed at Fort Hood, Texas.

The 3rd Brigade of the 4th Infantry Division deployed to southern Iraq from March 2010 to March 2011 in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn in an “Advise and Assist” role. 3rd Brigade Soldiers served alongside 50,000+ other U.S. service members under the command of United States Forces- Iraq. Soldiers from the brigade assisted in the training and preparation of Iraqi forces tasked with taking over responsibility of the southern sector of Iraq after U.S. forces were expected to withdraw from the area. 3rd Brigade Soldiers were re-flagged from being designated as a “Brigade Combat Team” and instead were reassigned as an “Advise and Assist” Brigade. The brigade was still tasked with completing combat operations within the southern sector Area Of Operation (A.O.) in Iraq and were exposed to direct combat with anti-coalition forces operating within the A.O. The 3rd Brigade returned to Fort Carson in March 2011 in order to resume garrison duties.

==War in Afghanistan==
In May 2009 the 4th Brigade Combat Team deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom X for a 12-month combat rotation. The 1st Battalion 12th Infantry Regiment deployed to Regional Command South. Task Force 1-12 operated in Maiwand district and Zhari district, namely the Arghandab River Valley, west of Kandahar City. Referred to as &quot;The Heart of Darkness&quot; for its notoriety as the birthplace of the Taliban, the soldiers of Task Force 1-12 operated in a very complex combat environment.

Much of the fighting was conducted in notoriously dense grape fields, which insurgent forces used as cover and concealment for a variety of complex attacks on coalition forces. The 2nd Battalion 12th Infantry Regiment deployed in to Regional Command East and was based in the Pech River Valley, Kunar Province, home to the Korangal Valley, Waygal, Shuriak, and Wata Pour Valleys. During its rotation, the 2nd Battalion saw heavy combat throughout the area.

The 3rd Squadron 61st Cavalry Regiment was also deployed to Regional Command East and served during its rotation in Kunar and Nuristan Provinces. Task Force Destroyer saw intense combat, namely the Battle of Kamdesh in which a combat outpost was attacked by over 300 insurgents in a complex attack 20 miles from the Pakistan border. For their bravery, on October 3, 2009, Bravo Troop 3-61 Cavalry became the most decorated unit of the Afghanistan War. The Battle of Kamdesh was the first in 50 years in which the Medal of Honor was given to two living servicemen.

Some reports indicate that the US soldiers of 4th ID did not maintain their efforts in the fight and withdrew inside of buildings to wait for QRF to arrive from elements of 10th Mountain Division. In May 2010, elements of the 4th Brigade Combat Team began to redeploy to Fort Carson and immediately began assisting and training sister units for future contingency operations, as well as training for its own future combat deployments. 38 soldiers from the brigade died during the deployment. For its actions 4th Brigade Combat Team was awarded the Valorous Unit Award, the second highest unit decoration awarded to United States Army units.

Upon 4BCT redeploying to Fort Carson, the rest of the division was set to deploy to Afghanistan. The 1st and 2nd Brigade Combat Teams also served in Afghanistan building on the efforts that were initiated by 4BCT. The 4th BCT has once again deployed in an advise and assist capacity, fulfilling the mission of training and preparing the Afghan Security Forces for the handover of all combat operations in the upcoming years.

The 1st and 2nd Brigade Combat Teams deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel in 2017.

==Operation Inherent Resolve==
Soldiers assigned to the 4th Infantry Division completed a nine-month deployment to Iraq in 2015, in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. This operation supported the military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

In February 2015, troops from the division&#x27;s 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team were deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria.

In September 2021, troops from the division&#x27;s 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team deployed to Erbil Air Base in Iraq following base closures for Operation Inherent Resolve.

==Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel==
In October 2015, the US Army announced that 1,000 troops from 4th Infantry Division&#x27;s Combat Aviation Brigade would be sent to Afghanistan sometime in winter, with another 1,800 soldiers from the 4th ID&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team deploying to Afghanistan in the spring 2016. On 12 August 2016, a U.S. Soldier from 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th ID died from a noncombat-related injury in Kandahar.

==Operation Atlantic Resolve==
On 3 November 2016, the U.S. Army deployed some 4,000 soldiers from 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team to Europe in winter in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve - to help deter possible Russian aggression. The brigade will arrive in Poland and will fan out across the continent, one battalion with M1 Abrams tanks will cover the Baltic region of Estonia and Latvia, while another will operate in Germany. A mechanized infantry battalion with M2 Bradley troop carriers and M1 Abrams tanks will have a foothold in the Romanian and Bulgarian region, whilst brigade headquarters will remain in Poland, along with an armored cavalry unit and a field artillery battalion wielding self-propelled M109 Paladin howitzers.

<doc id="329997" wikidata="Q2839155" url="?curid=329997" title="Almost Blue">
<text>Almost Blue is the sixth studio album by the English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, and his fifth with the Attractions—keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas (no relation). It was recorded in May 1981 in Nashville, Tennessee, and released in October the same year. A departure from Costello&#x27;s previous works, it is a covers album composed entirely of country music songs, including works written by Hank Williams and George Jones. The project originated with Costello&#x27;s desire to record a collection of covers after his two previous studio albums commercially underperformed following &quot;Armed Forces&quot; (1979).

Produced by Billy Sherrill, the recording sessions were marked by a fraught atmosphere, including resistance from Sherrill himself. The Doobie Brothers member John McFee contributed pedal steel as a way to add an authentic country sound. Most of the songs are relatively straightforward renditions of their original counterparts; a few were based on other covers of the originals. Costello&#x27;s poor health during recording and troubled personal life reflected in the song choices. All of the tracks express a &quot;blue&quot; state of mind, reflected in the cover artwork, an homage to Kenny Burrell&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Blue&quot; (1963).

The lead single, a cover of Jones&#x27;s &quot;Good Year for the Roses&quot;, received heavy airplay and reached the UK top ten. &quot;Almost Blue&quot; was released to little promotion, reaching number 7 in the UK and number 50 in the US. It received mixed reviews from music critics, who were divided on the vocal performances and debated on Costello&#x27;s success as a country singer. It has continued to receive mixed reactions in later decades from critics and has placed low on lists ranking the artist&#x27;s albums. Nevertheless, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; argued in 2016 that the album predicted numerous unexpected musical excursions Costello took later in his career. It has been reissued multiple times with bonus tracks.

==Background==

By 1981, Elvis Costello had experimented with country music throughout his entire career. While he did not grow up listening to country music, his discovery of Gram Parsons&#x27; work with both the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers inspired him to explore other country acts such as Merle Haggard and the Louvin Brothers. He played country rock songs during his time with the pub rock band Flip City in the mid-1970s and recorded the country tracks &quot;Radio Sweetheart&quot; and &quot;Stranger in the House&quot; during the sessions for his debut album &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; (1977). At the suggestion of Columbia Records&#x27; executive Greg Geller—who signed Costello to Columbia in America in 1977—Costello sang &quot;Stranger in the House&quot; as a duet with country musician George Jones in 1979, which appeared on the latter&#x27;s &quot;My Very Special Guests&quot; album the same year. Costello first met Jones&#x27;s longtime producer, Billy Sherrill, during an initial session in Nashville, Tennessee a year earlier. When Jones failed to show up, the two became friends and agreed to work together if Costello desired to create a country album.

The weaker commercial performances of both &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; (1980) and &quot;Trust&quot; (1981) following the successful &quot;Armed Forces&quot; (1979) made Costello question where he was at in his career. He was unable to express his current thoughts in his own music and stated that he &quot;just wanted to sing other people&#x27;s songs&quot;. Intending to explore his capabilities as a performer of cover versions, he recorded acoustic demos of several popular songs, including &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; (1933) and Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Love for Sale&quot; (1930). His initial vision was not limited to country music but rather &quot;a collection of melancholy songs of many styles&quot;, similar to Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; (1958). In an interview with Nicky Campbell, the artist said:

==Development==
While touring &quot;Trust&quot; in early 1981, Costello and his backing band the Attractions—keyboardist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas and drummer Pete Thomas (no relation)—conducted a session at Nashville&#x27;s CBS Studio B with Sherrill producing and Pete Drake on pedal steel that foreshadowed &quot;Almost Blue&quot;; the session yielded covers of Hank Cochran&#x27;s &quot;He&#x27;s Got You&quot; (1962) and Bobby Bland&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Care of You&quot; (1959). The band also road-tested several country songs during the tour. The Attractions had hesitations about the project, but Costello did not want to work with session musicians, stating: &quot;Then it would be just like going to the funfair and sticking your head through one of those little cut-out things and having your picture taken. I thought it could be a good emotional record. It was something that was very real to me when I did it.&quot; 

Rehearsals for the project commenced at Nick Lowe&#x27;s Am-Pro Studios in early April 1981. Pete Thomas&#x27;s associate from his former band Chilly Willy and the Red Hot Peppers, Paul &quot;Bassman&quot; Riley, contributed bass after Bruce Thomas fell ill; Bruce recovered in time for the album sessions. Over 40 songs were rehearsed. Songs Costello chose for the project included tracks recorded by Jones, Stonewall Jackson, Janis Martin, Webb Pierce, Conway Twitty and Charlie Rich. Sherrill felt the chosen material was outdated and presented cassette tapes of songs he felt were better suited, such as Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; (1956) and a Willie Nelson demo titled &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Let You Say Goodbye&quot;. Sherrill was willing to see how the band would interpret the material &quot;unless we write a new one&quot;. The producer also convinced Costello to record one of his own songs, &quot;Too Far Gone&quot;.

==Production==
===Recording===

The album was recorded from 18 to 29 May 1981 at Nashville&#x27;s CBS Studio A; Studio B was being renovated so operations were forced to move to the adjacent studio, which Costello said was more generic and less atmospheric. Sherrill produced while Ron &quot;Snake&quot; Reynolds engineered; it was Costello&#x27;s first studio album not produced by Nick Lowe. Alongside the Attractions, Doobie Brothers member John McFee was invited to contribute pedal steel and additional guitar overdubs to add an authentic country sound. Costello said: &quot;We wanted the sound but we didn&#x27;t necessarily want the main instrumental line which usually comes from the steel in country to be somebody we&#x27;d never heard before.&quot; The sessions were filmed by a camera crew, directed by Peter Carr, for the arts programme &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;.

The sessions were marred by a tense atmosphere. Costello himself was in poor health: he looked pale, was overweight and constantly drinking, which led to the recording of Haggard&#x27;s &quot;Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down&quot; (1966) and Rich&#x27;s &quot;Sittin&#x27; and Thinkin&quot;. According to Costello, Sherrill was a poor producer. Compared to Lowe, Sherrill was distant, uncommunicative and more interested in personal ventures than producing. With different work ethics, the producer and artist clashed frequently, with the latter stating that &quot;after a while it was less of a collaboration and more of a contest in cultural differences&quot;. Costello recalled at one point finding Sherrill and Reynolds comparing handguns behind the mixing desk. 

Sherrill had little faith in the project itself; he and CBS saw the sessions as an &quot;Englishman&#x27;s indulgence ... in music he didn&#x27;t really understand&quot;. He later recalled he lacked interest in Costello as an artist and failed to understand what he could contribute. McFee remembered an instance where Sherrill pulled him aside and asked him &quot;What the hell does this guy think he wants to make a country record for?&quot; The Attractions also disliked Sherrill. Nieve and Pete Thomas enjoyed country music and the project as a whole, while Bruce did not. One day the band ran through a fast rendition of Hank Williams&#x27;s &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Love Me (Like You Used to Do)?&quot;, which Sherrill enjoyed. He later said that the way they played the track is what he thought the whole album itself would sound like.

Despite the fraught atmosphere, Costello stated the sessions progressed quickly and productively, limiting the tracks to one or two takes before moving on to the next. According to Costello, over 25 songs were recorded during the sessions, although a good portion attempted were never in serious contention for inclusion on the album, recorded simply as backing tracks and lacking final mixes. The band attempted Costello&#x27;s original &quot;Tears Before Bedtime&quot;, a non-country number which Sherrill rejected. In the final days, Sherrill identified the recordings of Jones&#x27;s &quot;Good Year for the Roses&quot; (1970) and Don Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; (1955) as potential hits, adding strings by Tommy Millar and backing vocals by Nashville Edition. After mixing, Costello and the Attractions had dinner with Johnny Cash and his family to celebrate the occasion.

===Composition===

A departure from Costello&#x27;s previous works, &quot;Almost Blue&quot; is composed of 12 country songs that all reflect a &quot;blue&quot; state of mind. In his review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Allan Jones stated that the tracks are divided between &quot;driving, shitkicking honky tonk tunes and exquisitely poignant ballads&quot;. Costello&#x27;s troubled personal life, including his failing marriage and alcoholism, were reflected in the song choices, particularly &quot;Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down&quot;, &quot;Sittin&#x27; and Thinkin&quot; and George Jones&#x27;s &quot;Brown to Blue&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Will Hodge argued that other than the fast-paced version of &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Love Me (Like You Used to Do)?&quot; that opens the album, the album itself bears little resemblance to the artist&#x27;s previous works. The author Mick St. Michael added that the opening track does not represent the album as a whole, a statement supported by Costello, who said &quot;the meat of the album is the ballads&quot;.

The majority of the songs are mostly straightforward renditions of their original counterparts; &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; and Big Joe Turner&#x27;s &quot;Honey Hush&quot; (1953) were based on the Tommy McLain and Johnny Burnette Trio renditions, respectively. Costello said Nieve devised new piano lines for &quot;Brown to Blue&quot; and &quot;How Much I&#x27;ve Lied&quot;. Three tracks by George Jones appear: &quot;Brown to Blue&quot;, &quot;Good Year for the Roses&quot; and &quot;Color of the Blues&quot; (1958). The band recorded the Johnny Mullins-penned Loretta Lynn number &quot;Success&quot; (1962) at the insistence of Nieve, who recalled: &quot;We must have gone through hundreds of albums, trying to find that one song that we could make our own.&quot; Other tracks include Sherrill&#x27;s &quot;Too Far Gone&quot; and Parsons&#x27;s &quot;How Much I&#x27;ve Lied&quot; and &quot;Hot Burrito No. 1&quot;, the latter retitled &quot;I&#x27;m Your Toy&quot;. Costello commented that &quot;Hot Burrito No. 1&quot; was one of his favourites and &quot;an ambition&quot; of his to cover it. St. Michael states that Costello utilised looser and less formal vocal performances on the Parsons tracks, which aid in their successes.

==Packaging and artwork==
The album&#x27;s design is an homage to Kenny Burrell&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Blue&quot; (1963) and was packaged in four different coloured sleeves, all with blue as the base. Photographed by Keith Morris, the image depicts Costello with his glasses removed and face covered with one hand – a ring on his middle finger – appearing as though he is hiding tears. The original LP came with a removable sticker reading &quot;Warning: This album contains country &amp; western music and may produce radical reaction in narrow minded people&quot;. In his memoir, Costello stated the &quot;warning&quot; was a tease for listeners who desired &quot;More New Wave Hits&quot;. On the back cover, Costello and the Attractions appear with small grins, along with an image of McFee in a Stetson. A logo reads &quot;no spoiler signal&quot;.

==Release==

&quot;Good Year for the Roses&quot; was issued as the lead single, backed by a cover of Jack Ripley&#x27;s &quot;Your Angel Steps Out of Heaven&quot;, in September 1981. It received heavy airplay on BBC Radio One and Radio Two and charted at number 6 on the UK Singles Chart, proving Costello&#x27;s prediction that it &quot;would probably reach a lot of people that don&#x27;t buy our records normally&quot;. It was promoted with a music video that was filmed at the Meldrum House. According to Costello, they could not take a piano onto the wood floor of the saloon so Nieve mimed the string parts using a violin. The video was played frequently on MTV in America during the programme&#x27;s early days. &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; was released as the second single in December, backed by a live version of Leon Payne&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;, and reached number 42 in the UK.

&quot;Almost Blue&quot; was released on 23 October 1981 through F-Beat Records in the UK and Columbia in the US. It reached number 7 on the UK Albums Chart and number 50 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, the latter of which Costello attributed to the lack of promotion from country radio stations. F-Beat released an interview album subtitled &quot;Elvis Introduces His Favorite Country Songs&quot; to selected journalists and DJs as a promotional tool. The &quot;South Bank Show&quot; special filmed during the recording sessions aired shortly after its release. The band took time off after recording, with occasional live performances in late-July that mostly featured Costello&#x27;s previous work and less country material. By August, he had begun writing original compositions and demoed several songs that would appear on his next album, &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; (1982).

==Critical reception==

&quot;Almost Blue&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics on release. In the UK, it was greeted with mostly positive reactions. In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Allan Jones positively compared the artist&#x27;s vocal performances to &quot;Trust&quot;, arguing that Costello&#x27;s voice &quot;has rarely enjoyed such freedom and expressive scope&quot;, concluding that &quot;Almost Blue&quot; &quot;unashamedly evoke[s] memories of all the places you thought you&#x27;d never leave but did, all the lovers you thought you&#x27;d still know, don&#x27;t, but can&#x27;t forget.&quot; Paul Du Noyer deemed it &quot;a richly satisfying sidestep&quot; in &quot;NME&quot;, saying that &quot;it has the feel of being both a homage and a holiday&quot;. In a five-star review, &quot;Record Mirror&quot; Mike Nicholls proclaimed that taken on its own terms, &quot;it&#x27;s as flawless an LP as has been released all year&quot;, although he felt Costello&#x27;s fans would be disappointed due to the lack of originals.

The artist&#x27;s vocal performances proved divisive in America. Many deemed some renditions as successes and others as failures. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Martha Hume argued that &quot;a truly great country singer&quot; possesses both control of their own voice, the ability to broadcast a character and—ideally—is able to convey their own personality onto the listener. She stated that Costello succeeds at this on &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Toy&quot; and &quot;Good Year for the Roses&quot;, while failing on &quot;Brown to Blue&quot;, &quot;Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Color of the Blues&quot;. Hume noted that the LP stood as the artist&#x27;s first album on which the lyrics are easily understandable. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Robert Palmer wrote that Costello&#x27;s singing &quot;exposes his own technical limitations&quot;, a comment supported by Robert Hilburn in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, who wrote that Costello&#x27;s voice is ideal for &quot;expressing ironies and nuances&quot; in his own songs, but &quot;lacks the purity and range&quot; to effectively compete with the original versions of the tracks. More positively, &quot;Cash Box&quot; argued that the singer&#x27;s &quot;distinctive vocals fit perfectly into the country framework&quot; and the songs are &quot;rendered with conviction and emotion&quot;.
American critics were mixed on &quot;Almost Blue&quot; as a whole. Carrie B. Cooper found that Costello was &quot;settling for love rather than passion&quot; in &quot;Boston Rock&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; announced that the album &quot;does for country what the band&#x27;s &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; did for R&amp;B—respect the music&#x27;s form and essence, yet link both to Costello&#x27;s own writing&quot;. More negatively, Hilburn deemed it a &quot;major disappointment&quot; that would serve as an intriguing piece for hardcore fans, but provide little enjoyment to everyone else, exhibiting &quot;little of Costello&#x27;s usual vision&quot;. Hilburn asserted that although &quot;Almost Blue&quot; is not a bad country album, it &quot;simply lacks the power and originality we have come to expect from this invaluable figure&quot;. In &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, Jon Young felt that the artist would be a worthy participant in country as a whole once he presented more of himself into the genre. Young and Ira Robbins later labelled the album &quot;surprisingly clumsy&quot; and a &quot;dud&quot;.

Additionally, several noted the continued absence of Costello&#x27;s angry persona featured prominently in his earlier works, while some gave positive mentions to the performances of the Attractions. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, critic Robert Christgau positively compared &quot;Almost Blue&quot; to other covers albums such as David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Pin Ups&quot; (1973) and John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1975), records that &quot;also seemed &#x27;important&#x27; when they appeared&quot;.

==Subsequent events and legacy==

After recording &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; in November 1981, Costello and the Attractions underwent the Almost Blue Tour from December to January 1982, playing major cities in the US and the UK. The setlist was composed of country songs from &quot;Almost Blue&quot;, as well as older and newer originals. On 7 January, Costello played to a sold out show at the Royal Albert Hall, fronting the 92-member Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The show received praise from Allan Jones, who hailed that &quot;Costello&#x27;s voice raided every emotional avenue on its way to the heart.&quot; A live version of &quot;I&#x27;m Your Toy&quot; from the show was released as a single in April, backed by renditions of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Cry! Cry! Cry!&quot; (1955) and Webb Pierce&#x27;s &quot;Wondering&quot; (1951). Costello and the Attractions continued touring throughout 1982 before &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; was released in July.

Although &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; had represented Costello&#x27;s first instance of shifting musical styles, &quot;Almost Blue&quot; stood as his first true departure, predicting a career of ever-changing songwriting approaches, musical styles and experimentation. Hodge commented in 2016 that since &quot;Almost Blue&quot;, Costello has released several &quot;unconventional and unexpected&quot; albums amidst his &quot;normal&quot; albums, from the orchestral instrumental of &quot;G.B.H.&quot; (1991) and the jazz ballads of &quot;North&quot; (2003), to a ballet score (&quot;Il Sogno&quot;, 2004) and a collection of classical string quartet pieces (&quot;The Juliet Letters&quot;, 1993). Hodge further acknowledges the artist&#x27;s collaborative records with the Roots (&quot;Wise Up Ghost&quot;, 2013), Burt Bacharach (&quot;Painted from Memory&quot;, 1998) and Allen Toussaint (&quot;The River in Reverse&quot;, 2006). Costello returned to country music in the late-2000s with the back-to-back releases of &quot;Secret, Profane &amp; Sugarcane&quot; (2009) and &quot;National Ransom&quot; (2010). Hodge summarises:

===Retrospective appraisal===

Retrospectively, &quot;Almost Blue&quot; has received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. In 1994, &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s David Cavanagh acknowledged that &quot;its exact point eluded most of us, although it arguably turned many others on to the genre from which it drew&quot;, further remarking that its first expanded reissue presented it as &quot;a little too good to class as a career blip&quot;. Senior AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine agreed, arguing that &quot;Almost Blue&quot; stands as &quot;one of the most entertaining cover records in rock &amp; roll&quot; due to the enthusiasm behind the project. Reporting on the 2004 reissue, &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine&#x27;s Chris Roberts argued that the album has aged well despite its divisive reception on its initial release, highlighting &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, &quot;Good Year for the Roses&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Your Toy&quot; as tracks that sound &quot;as warm and nasty as ever&quot;. The online music service Rhapsody called it one of their favourite covers albums in 2010. In 2022, Chris Ingalls of &quot;PopMatters&quot; named &quot;Almost Blue&quot; one of Costello&#x27;s ten most under-appreciated albums, finding the artist&#x27;s embracement of the genre and the Attractions&#x27; fine performances make for a &quot;worthwhile listen&quot; and a &quot;charming change of pace&quot;.

Costello&#x27;s biographers have shown appreciation for &quot;Almost Blue&quot;. In his book &quot;Elvis Costello: God&#x27;s Comic&quot;, David Gouldstone describes the album as &quot;a brave experiment, and a successful one&quot;. Tony Clayton-Lea deems it &quot;one of rock&#x27;s finest and enriching sidesteps&quot;, summarising it as &quot;another collection of good, even great songs&quot;. St. Michael commends the performances and overall good execution, further stating that Costello had already displayed &quot;his command of the country lyric idiom&quot; on tracks such as &quot;Stranger in the House&quot; and &quot;Trust&quot; &quot;Different Finger&quot;. The author James E. Perone calls the record uneven but finds it &quot;presents Elvis Costello as a successful country balladeer who could effectively sing American country ballads and not simply try to capture the style.&quot; Graeme Thomson, on the other hand, describes &quot;Almost Blue&quot; as &quot;a difficult record to love&quot;. He opines that despite its brevity—at a little over 30 minutes in length—it drags and &quot;merely sound[s] funereal and oppressive&quot;, with the more up-tempo tracks &quot;lumbering rather than fleet of foot&quot;.

In lists ranking Costello&#x27;s albums from worst to best, &quot;Almost Blue&quot; has consistently ranked in the lower tier. In 2021, writers for &quot;Stereogum&quot; placed it at number 18 (out of 27), deeming the material &quot;serviceable&quot; with &quot;surprisingly perfunctory&quot; results. They highlighted the album as a showcase for Costello&#x27;s growth as a singer, particularly on &quot;Good Year for the Roses&quot;, ultimately dubbing &quot;Almost Blue&quot; &quot;a tentative dry run&quot; for the artist&#x27;s reach into more experimental territories. A year later, Al Shipley of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, placed it at number 17 (out of 31), calling it &quot;a fascinating early fusion of Costello&#x27;s personal vision and his aspirations to master a wide variety of genres.&quot; Conversely, Michael Gallucci placed it at number 27 (out of 29) in &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; the same year – only above Costello&#x27;s second all-covers album &quot;Kojak Variety&quot; (1995) and &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot; (1984) – deeming it the first misstep of the artist&#x27;s career, failed by Costello&#x27;s handling of the material.

==Reissues==
&quot;Almost Blue&quot; was first released on CD through Columbia and Demon Records in January 1986. Its first extended reissue through Demon in the UK and Rykodisc in the US on CD came in May 1994, which came with numerous bonus tracks, including outtakes and live recordings. The author Brian Hinton finds this reissue &quot;more satisfying&quot; than the original album, particularly highlighting the live performances in Aberdeen as &quot;possessing a snap and crackle&quot; lacking on the studio recordings. He also lists the Royal Albert Hall performance of &quot;I&#x27;m Your Toy&quot; as &quot;pull[ing] dimensions out of Costello&#x27;s voice barely hinted at in the studio version: urgency, passion and danger.&quot; &quot;Almost Blue&quot; was again reissued by Rhino Records on 3August 2004 as a two-disc set with additional bonus tracks. The album was later remastered and reissued by UMe on 6November 2015.

<doc id="330000" wikidata="Q6577601" url="?curid=330000" title="List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts">
<text>Throughout the history of Major League Baseball (MLB), franchises have had various postseason and World Series droughts.

All 16 of the original Major League franchises (i.e., those in place when the first World Series was played in 1903) have won the World Series, with the longest wait for a franchise&#x27;s first championship being for the Phillies ( seasons, ending in 1980). Since expansion began in 1961, five of the 14 expansion teams have never won the World Series. Furthermore, one franchise, the Cleveland Guardians, currently has a championship drought that pre-dates the expansion era. The three longest championship droughts in history were ended recently by the Red Sox ( seasons, ending in 2004), the White Sox ( seasons, ending in 2005), and the Cubs ( seasons, ending in 2016).

Only one expansion franchise (the Seattle Mariners) has never won a pennant (i.e., the league championship, the two winners of which meet in the World Series). The three longest pennant droughts in history were recently ended by the Rangers ( years, starting with the team&#x27;s foundation and ending in 2010), the Cubs ( years, ending in 2016), and the Nationals ( years, starting with the team&#x27;s foundation and ending in 2019, and including the franchise&#x27;s entire years as the Montreal Expos). As the Nationals are the third franchise to be based in the city of Washington, their 2019 pennant also ended a drought of seasons played in Washington since their last pennant, which was in 1933 (discounting the 33 seasons during which there was no team in Washington).

As of the 2024 season, every active MLB franchise has qualified for the playoffs, especially since expansion of the playoffs in 1994 made that feat easier. The Angels have the longest active postseason drought at 10 years, while the Cincinnati Reds have the longest active postseason series-win drought at 28 years. Long postseason droughts were ended recently by the Nationals ( years, ending in 2012), the Pirates ( years, ending in 2013), the Royals ( years, ending in 2014), the Blue Jays ( years, ending in 2015), and the Mariners ( years, ending in 2022).

This list includes only the modern World Series between the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), not the various 19th-century championship series. Those teams which have never achieved a particular accomplishment in their franchise history are listed by the date they entered the leagues.

==Postseason droughts==

===Longest current postseason droughts===

<text>The 1st Cavalry Division (&quot;First Team&quot;) is a combined arms division and is one of the most decorated combat divisions of the United States Army. It is based at Fort Cavazos, Texas. It was formed in 1921 and served during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, with the Stabilization Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Iraq War, the War in Afghanistan as well as Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel and Operation Inherent Resolve. As of July 2023, the 1st Cavalry Division is subordinate to the III Armored Corps and is commanded by Major General Thomas M. Feltey.

The unit is unique in that it has served as a cavalry division, an infantry division, an air assault division and an armored division during its existence.

==History==
The history of the 1st Cavalry Division began in 1921 after the army established a permanent cavalry division table of organization and equipment on 4 April 1921. It authorized a square division organization of 7,463 officers and men, organized as follows:
* Headquarters Element (34 men)
* Two Cavalry Brigades (2,803 men each)
* Field Artillery Battalion (790 men)
* Engineer Battalion (357 men)
* Division Quartermaster Trains Command (276 men)
* Special Troops Command (337 men)
* Ambulance Company (63 men)

On 20 August 1921, the War Department Adjutant General constituted the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Divisions to meet partial mobilization requirements and authorized the establishment of the 1st Cavalry Division under the new TO&amp;E on 31 August 1921. Since the 1st Cavalry Division was to assemble from existing units, it was able to be activated on 13 September 1921, even though all of the division&#x27;s subordinate units did not arrive until 1922.

The 1st Cavalry Division was assigned to the VIII Corps Area, with the division headquarters and 2nd Cavalry Brigade located at Fort Bliss, Texas, and the 1st Cavalry Brigade at Camp Harry J. Jones in Douglas, Arizona. The headquarters facilities used by the 1st Cavalry Division were those previously vacated by the 8th Brigade when it was commanded by MG John J. Pershing in 1916, and the wartime 15th Cavalry Division, which had existed at Fort Bliss between 10 December 1917 and 12 May 1918.
The 1st Cavalry Division assembled at Douglas, Arizona. The 1st, 7th, and 8th Cavalry Regiments had previously been assigned to the wartime 15th Cavalry Division until they were returned to the VIII Corps Area troop list on 12 May 1918. The 1st Cavalry Regiment remained assigned until it was transferred to the 1st Cavalry Division on 20 August 1921. The 7th, 8th, and 10th Cavalry Regiments were transferred on 13 September 1921, although the assignment of the 10th Cavalry Regiment to the 1st Cavalry Division was controversial because the transfer violated the Jim Crow laws. This controversy continued until 18 December 1922, when the 5th Cavalry Regiment, then on the VIII Corps Area Troop List, swapped places with the 10th Cavalry Regiment.

In 1923, the 1st Cavalry Division held division maneuvers for the first time, intending to hold them annually thereafter. However, financial constraints made that impossible. Only in 1927, through the generosity of a few ranchers who provided free land, was the division able to conduct such exercises again. In 1928 Major General Herbert B. Crosby, Chief of Cavalry, faced with personnel cuts, reorganized the cavalry regiments, which in turn reduced the size of the 1st Cavalry Division. Crosby&#x27;s goal was to decrease overhead while maintaining or increasing firepower in the regiments. After the reorganization, each cavalry regiment consisted of a headquarters and headquarters troop, a machine gun troop, a medical and chaplain element, and two squadrons, each with a headquarters element and two line troops. The cavalry brigades&#x27; machine gun squadrons were inactivated, while the responsibility for training and employing machine guns fell to the regimental commanders, as in the infantry.

At about the same time, Crosby cut the cavalry regiment, and the army staff, seeking to increase the usefulness of the wartime cavalry division, published new tables of organization for an even larger unit. The new structure increased the size of the signal troop (177), expanded the medical unit to a squadron (233), and endorsed Crosby&#x27;s movement of the machine gun units from the brigades to the regiments (2x176). A divisional aviation section, an armored car squadron (278), and a tank company (155) were added, the field artillery battalion was expanded to a regiment (1,717), and divisional strength rose to 9,595.

==Prelude to World War II==

With the arrival of the 1930s, serious work started on the testing and refining of new equipment and TO&amp;Es for a mechanized and motorized army. To facilitate this, the 1st Cavalry Division traded the 1st Cavalry Regiment, which was in the process of being reorganized as a separate mechanized unit, for the 12th Cavalry Regiment from the 2nd Cavalry Division on 3 January 1933. Taking into account recommendations from the VIII Corps Area, the Army War College, and the Command and General Staff School, the board developed a new smaller triangular cavalry division, which the 1st Cavalry Division evaluated during maneuvers at Toyahvale, Texas, in 1938. Like the 1937 infantry division test, the maneuvers concentrated on the divisional cavalry regiments around which all other units were to be organized.

Following the test, a board of 1st Cavalry Division officers, headed by Brigadier General Kenyon A. Joyce, rejected the three-regiment division and recommended retention of the two-brigade (four-regiment) organization. The latter configuration allowed the division to deploy easily in two columns, which was accepted as standard cavalry tactics. However, the board advocated reorganizing the cavalry regiment along triangular lines, which would give it a headquarters and headquarters troop, a machine gun squadron with special weapons and machine gun troops, and three rifle squadrons, each with one machine gun and three rifle troops. No significant change was made in the field artillery, but the test showed that the engineering element should remain a squadron to provide the divisional elements greater mobility on the battlefield and that the special troops idea should be extended to include the division headquarters, signal, and ordnance troops; quartermaster, medical, engineer, reconnaissance, and observation squadrons; and a chemical warfare detachment. One headquarters would assume responsibility for the administration and disciplinary control of these forces.

Although the study did not lead to a general reorganization of the cavalry division, the wartime cavalry regiment was restructured, effective 1 December 1938, to consist of a headquarters and headquarters troop, machine gun and special weapons troops, and three squadrons of three rifle troops each. The special troops remained as structured in 1928, and no observation squadron or chemical detachment found a place in the division. With the paper changes in the cavalry divisions and other minor adjustments, the strength of a wartime divisional rose to 10,680.

In order to prepare for war service, 1st Cavalry Division participated in the following maneuvers:
* Toyahvale, TX Maneuvers – 7 October through 30 October 1939.
* Cravens-Pitkin Louisiana Maneuvers – 13 August through 24 August 1940.
* Second 3rd Army Louisiana Maneuvers – 10 August through 4 October 1941.
* VIII Corps Louisiana Maneuvers near Mansfield, LA – 27 July 1942 – 21 September 1942.

==== Training ====

With the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the &quot;great laboratory&quot; phase for developing and testing organizations, about which Marshall wrote in the summer of 1941, closed, but the War Department still had not developed ideal infantry, cavalry, armored, and motorized divisions. In 1942 it again revised the divisions based on experiences gained during the great GHQ maneuvers of the previous year. As in the past, the reorganizations ranged from minor adjustments to wholesale changes.

1st Cavalry Division retained its square configuration after the 1941 maneuvers, but with modifications. The division lost its antitank troop, the brigades their weapons troops, and the regiments their machine gun and special weapons troops. These changes brought no decrease in divisional firepower, but placed most weapons within the cavalry troops. The number of .50-caliber machine guns was increased almost threefold. In the reconnaissance squadron, the motorcycle and armored car troops were eliminated, leaving the squadron with one support troop and three reconnaissance troops equipped with light tanks. These changes increased the division from 11,676 to 12,112 officers and enlisted men.

The last of the 1st Cavalry Division&#x27;s mounted units permanently retired their horses and converted to infantry formations on 28 February 1943. However, a mounted special ceremonial unit known as the Horse Platoon – later, the Horse Cavalry Detachment – was established within the division in January 1972. Its ongoing purpose is to represent the traditions and heritage of the American horse cavalry at military ceremonies and public events.

1st Cavalry Division reported for its port call at Camp Stoneman, CA as follows:


===Combat chronicle===

Although originally part of the III Corps (which eventually participated in the European Theater), while training in the United States, most of the 1st Cavalry Division arrived in Australia as shown above, continued its training at Strathpine, Queensland, until 26 July, then moved to New Guinea to stage for the Admiralties campaign 22–27 February 1944. The division experienced its first combat in the Admiralty Islands, units landing at Los Negros on 29 February 1944. Momote airstrip was secured against great odds. Attacks by the Japanese were thrown back, and the enemy force surrounded by the end of March. Nearby islands were taken in April and May. The division next took part in the invasion of Leyte, on 20 October 1944, captured Tacloban and the adjacent airstrip, advanced along the north coast, and secured Leyte Valley, with elements landing on and securing Samar Island. Moving down Ormoc Valley (in Leyte) and across the Ormoc plain, the division reached the west coast of Leyte on 1 January 1945.

The division then invaded Luzon, landing in the Lingayen Gulf area on 27 January 1945, and fought its way as a &quot;flying column&quot; to Manila by 3 February 1945. More than 3,000 civilian prisoners at the University of Santo Tomas, including more than 60 US Army nurses (some of the &quot;Angels of Bataan and Corregidor&quot;) were liberated, and the 1st Cavalry then advanced east of Manila by the middle of February before the city was cleared. On 20 February the division was assigned the mission of seizing and securing crossings over the Marikina River and securing the Tagaytay-Antipolo Line. After being relieved on 12 March in the Antipolo area during the middle of the Battle of Wawa Dam, elements pushed south into Batangas and provinces of the Bicol Region together with recognized guerrillas. They mopped up the remaining pockets of resistance in these areas in small unit actions. Resistance was officially declared at an end on 1 July 1945.

===Casualties===

*Total battle casualties: 4,055
*Killed in action: 734
*Wounded in action: 3,311
*Missing in action: 9
*Prisoner of war: 1

===Postwar===

The division left Luzon on 25 August 1945 for occupation duty in Japan, arriving in Yokohama on 2 September 1945 and entering Tokyo on 8 September, the first United States division to enter the Japanese capital. 101 unit was set up in May 1945 to search for the missing soldiers in the Second World War. The detachment consisted of two officers (Captain MacColeman and Lieutenant Foley) and 15 enlisted members. The operation was successful, although it lasted three years. Occupation duty in Japan followed for the next five years.

==Korean War==
On 25 June 1950, North Korea attacked South Korea, and the 1st Cavalry Division was rushed to Korea to help shore up the Pusan Perimeter, landing on Pohang On 18 July 1950.

After the X Corps attack at Incheon, a breakout operation was launched at the Pusan Perimeter. The division then joined the UN counteroffensive that recaptured most of South Korea by the end of September. The UN offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel into North Korea on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the division and the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) 1st Infantry Division captured the city. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening resistance. The Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) entered the war on the side of North Korea, making their first attacks in late October.

On 28 October 1950, Eighth Army commander General Walton Walker relieved the 1st Cavalry Division of its security mission in Pyongyang. The division&#x27;s new orders were to pass through the ROK 1st Division&#x27;s lines at Unsan and attack toward the Yalu River. Leading the way on the twenty-ninth, the 8th Cavalry Regiment departed Pyongyang and reached Yongsan-dong that evening. The 5th Cavalry Regiment arrived the next morning, with the mission to protect the 8th Cavalry Regiment&#x27;s rear. With the arrival of the 8th Cavalry Regiment at Unsan on the 31st, the ROK 1st Division redeployed to positions northeast, east, and southeast of Unsan; the 8th Cavalry took up positions north, west, and south of the town. Meanwhile, the ROK 15th Regiment was desperately trying to hold its position east of the 8th Cavalry, across the Samt&#x27;an River.

During the afternoon of 1 November, the PVA attack north of Unsan gained strength against the ROK 15th Regiment and gradually extended to the right flank of the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry. At nightfall, the 1st Battalion controlled the northern approaches to the Samt&#x27;an River, except for portions of the ROK 15th Regiment&#x27;s zone on the east side. The battalion&#x27;s position on the left was weak; there were not enough soldiers to extend the defensive line to the main ridge leading into Unsan. This left a gap between the 1st and 2nd Battalions. East of the Samt&#x27;an the ROK 15th Regiment was under heavy attack, and shortly after midnight it no longer existed as a combat force. At 19:30 on 1 November, the PVA 116th Division attacked the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, all along its line. At 21:00 PVA troops found the weak link in the ridgeline and began moving through it and down the ridge behind the 2nd Battalion, penetrating its right flank and encircling its left. Now both the 1st and 2nd Battalions were engaged by the enemy on several sides. Around midnight, the 8th Cavalry received orders to withdraw southward to Ipsok. At 01:30 on 2 November, no PVA activity was reported in the 3rd Battalion&#x27;s sector south of Unsan. But as the 8th Cavalry withdrew, all three battalions became trapped by roadblocks made by the PVA 347th Regiment, 116th Division south of Unsan during the early morning hours. Members of the 1st Battalion who were able to escape reached the Ipsok area. A head count showed the battalion had lost about 15 officers and 250 enlisted men. Members of the 2nd Battalion, for the most part, scattered into the hills. Many of them reached the ROK lines near Ipsok. Others met up with the 3rd Battalion, the hardest hit. Around 03:00 the PVA launched a surprise attack on the battalion command post. Hand-to-hand fighting ensued for about half an hour before the PVA was driven from the area. The disorganized members of the 3rd Battalion formed a core of resistance around three tanks on the valley floor and held off the PVA until daylight. By that time, only six officers and 200 enlisted men were still able to function. More than 170 were wounded, and the number of dead or missing were uncounted. Attempts by the 5th Cavalry to relieve the beleaguered battalion were unsuccessful, and the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, soon ceased to exist as an organized force.

Following the battle, there were disparaging rumors about the 1st Cavalry Division&#x27;s fighting abilities, including a folk song of the time called &quot;The Bug-Out Ballad&quot;. The series of engagements that were rumored to have given rise to the song were due (at least partly) to the myth that the division lost its unit colors. Other Army and Marine units disparagingly described the division shoulder insignia as representing &#x27;The horse they never rode, the river they never crossed, and the yellow speaks for itself&#x27;. Another version goes: &quot;The shield they never carried, the horse they never rode, the bridge they never crossed, the line they never held, and the yellow is the reason why.&quot;

* Korean War casualties
** 3,811 killed in action
** 12,086 wounded in action
* Korean War honors
** 9 Medal of Honor recipients:
**:8th Engineer Battalion: Melvin L. Brown (4 September 1950).
**:5th Cavalry Regiment: Lloyd L. Burke (28 October 1951), Samuel S. Coursen (12 December 1950), and Robert M. McGovern (30 January 1951).

**:16th Reconnaissance Company: Gordon M. Craig (10 September 1950).

The 1st Cavalry Division remained in the line until it was relieved by the 45th Infantry Division from the Oklahoma Army National Guard in January 1952. Following the relief, the division returned to Japan. The division returned to Korea in 1957, where it remained until 1965.

==Vietnam War==


As a result of the Howze Board, helicopters were used in Vietnam for reconnaissance, command and control, troop transport, attack gunships, aerial rocket artillery, medical evacuation, and supply. It was a revolution in maneuver doctrine that freed the infantry from the limitations of terrain to attack the enemy at the time and place of its choosing.

The 11th Airborne Division had been reactivated at Fort Benning on 1 February 1963 and redesignated as the 11th Air Assault Division (Test). In September 1963, Air Assault I exercises tested the Airmobility concept at the battalion level at Fort Stewart in Georgia. Air Assault II, a much larger exercise, was conducted across two states in October 1964. The 11th Air Assault Division operated against the 82nd Airborne Division and the 11th thoroughly dominated the exercise.

When the test proved successful, the assets of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test), the 10th Air Transport Brigade, and the 2nd Infantry Division were merged into a single unit. The colors and subordinate unit designations of the 1st Cavalry Division were transferred from its post in Korea. On 3 July 1965, the colors of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) were cased and retired and the 1st Air Cavalry Division colors were moved onto the field at Doughboy Stadium and passed to the commander of the former 11th Air Assault Division, Major General Kinnard. At the same time, the personnel and units of the 1st Cavalry Division that remained in Korea were reflagged as a new 2nd Infantry Division. On 29 July 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered the 1st Air Cavalry Division to Vietnam.


Shortly thereafter, the division began deploying to Camp Radcliff, An Khe, Vietnam, in the Central Highlands and was equipped with the new M16 rifle, the UH-1 troop carrier helicopter, UH-1C gunships, the CH-47 Chinook cargo helicopter, and the massive CH-54 Skycrane cargo helicopter. All aircraft carried insignia to indicate their battalion and company.
The division&#x27;s first major operation was to help relieve the Siege of Plei Me near Pleiku and the pursuit of the withdrawing People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) which culminated in the Battle of Ia Drang, described in the book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once...And Young&quot;, was also the basis of the film &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;. Because of that battle the division earned the Presidential Unit Citation (US), the first unit to receive such in the war. In 1966, the division attempted to root the communist Viet Cong (VC) and PAVN out of Bình Định Province with Operation Masher, Operation Crazy Horse and Operation Thayer. 1967 was then spent conducting Operation Pershing, a large scale search and destroy operation of PAVN/VC base areas in II Corps in which 5,400 PAVN/VC soldiers were killed and 2,000 captured. In Operation Jeb Stuart, January 1968, the division moved north to Camp Evans, north of Hue and on to Landing Zones Sharon and Betty, south of Quang Tri City, all in the I Corps Tactical Zone.
In the early morning hours of 31 January 1968, the largest battle of the Vietnam War, the Tet Offensive, was launched by 84,000 PAVN/VC soldiers across South Vietnam. In the division&#x27;s area of operation, the PAVN/VC forces seized most of the city of Huế. As the 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, fought to cut off PAVN/VC reinforcements pouring into Huế, at Quảng Trị, five battalions, most from the 324th Division, attacked the city and LZ Betty (Headquarters 1st Brigade). To stop allied troops from intervening, three other PAVN/VC infantry battalions deployed as blocking forces, all supported by a 122mm-rocket battalion and two heavy-weapons companies armed with 82mm mortars and 75mm recoilless rifles. After intense fighting, 900 PAVN/VC soldiers were killed in and around Quảng Trị and LZ Betty. However, across South Vietnam, 1,000 Americans, 2,100 South Vietnamese, 14,000 civilians, and 32,000 PAVN/VC were killed.

In March 1968 the division shifted forces to LZ Stud, the staging area for Operation Pegasus to break the siege of the Marine&#x27;s Khe Sanh Combat Base—the second largest battle of the war. All three brigades participated in this airmobile operation, along with a Marine armor thrust. US Air Force B-52s alone dropped more than 75,000 tons of bombs on PAVN soldiers from the 304th and 325th Divisions encroaching the combat base in trenches. As these two elite enemy divisions, with history at Dien Bien Phu and the Ia Drang Valley, depleted, the division leapfrogged west, clearing Route 9, until at 0:800 hours 8 April, the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, linked-up with Marines at the combat base, ending the 77-day siege.

On 19 April 1968, as the 2nd Brigade continued pushing west to the Laotian border, the 1st and 3rd Brigades (about 11,000 men and 300 helicopters) swung southwest and air assaulted A Shau Valley, commencing Operation Delaware. The PAVN was a well-trained, equipped, and led force. They turned A Shau into a formidable sanctuary —complete with PT-76 tanks; powerful crew-served 37mm antiaircraft cannons, some radar controlled; twin-barreled 23mm cannons; and scores of 12.7mm heavy machine guns. A long-range penetration operation was launched by members of the Division&#x27;s long-range reconnaissance patrol (LRP) against the PAVN when they seized &quot;Signal Hill&quot;—the name attributed to the peak of Dong Re Lao Mountain, a densely forested mountain midway in the valley—so the 1st and 3rd Brigades, slugging it out hidden deep behind the mountains, could communicate with Camp Evans near the coast or with approaching aircraft.

Despite hundreds of B-52 and jet air strikes, the PAVN forces shot down a C-130, a CH-54, two CH-47s and nearly two dozen UH-1s. Many more were lost in accidents or damaged by ground fire. The division also suffered more than 100 dead and 530 wounded in the operation. Bad weather aggravated the loss by causing delays in troop movements, allowing a substantial number of PAVN to escape to safety in Laos. Still, the PAVN lost more than 800 dead, a tank, 70 trucks, two bulldozers, 30 flamethrowers, thousands of rifles and machine guns, and dozens of antiaircraft cannons. They also lost tons of ammunition, explosives, medical supplies and foodstuffs.

In mid-May 1968 Operation Delaware ended, however, the division continued tactical operations in I Corps as well as local pacification and &quot;medcap&quot; (medical outreach programs to local Vietnamese). In the autumn of 1968, the division relocated south to Phước Vĩnh Base Camp northeast of Saigon. In May 1970, the division participated in the Cambodian Incursion, withdrawing from Cambodia on 29 June. Thereafter, the division took a defensive posture while US troops withdrawals continued from Vietnam. On 29 April 1971 the bulk of the division was withdrawn to Fort Hood, Texas, but its 3rd Brigade remained as one of the final two major US ground combat units in Vietnam, departing 29 June 1972. However, its 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, Task Force Garry Owen, remained another two months.

In the Vietnam War, the division suffered more casualties than any other U.S. Army division: 5,444 men killed in action and 26,592 wounded in action.

==Cold War service and REFORGER Exercise==

When the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) departed Vietnam, its colors were retained by reflagging the existing 1st Armored Division at Fort Hood as the &quot;new&quot; 1st Cavalry Division, configured as an armored division. Concurrently, the colors of the 1st Armored Division were transferred to Germany where the 4th Armored Division was reflagged as the 1st Armored Division.

In the aftermath of Vietnam, the 1st Cavalry Division was converted from an airmobile light infantry role into a triple capabilities (TRICAP) division. The unit received an infusion of mechanized infantry and artillery, to make it capable of missions needing three types of troops; armored, airmobility and air cavalry.
In the post-Vietnam era, morale in the US Army waned. In response, the Department of the Army released a morale–enhancing order in 1973 permitting local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing uniform distinctions. Consequently, many units embraced the wear of various military berets. The 1st Cavalry Division&#x27;s use of various colored berets started in 1971 with the TRICAP experiment: black for armor, light–blue for infantry, red for artillery, and kelly–green for support. The division eventually settled on the use of black berets for all 1st Cavalry soldiers and continued wearing them until the Army&#x27;s moral enhancing order ended in 1979.

However, the TRICAP concept was short-lived, and by 1975, the division was reorganized under the Round-Out Division concept, with two active duty armored brigades and one National Guard armored brigade - the Mississippi Army National Guard&#x27;s 155th Armored Brigade from 1984 to 1991.

The division participated in numerous REFORGER exercises, and was used to test new doctrinal concepts and equipment, including the XM-1 tank. The unit assignment and structure changed significantly, notably when 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry was inactivated. The 13th Signal Battalion fielded mobile subscriber equipment (MSE), a secure digital communications system for corps and below units.

By October 1986 all heavy army and national guard divisions, including the 1st Cavalry Division, had transitioned to the Army of Excellence J-series TOE. Thus the division&#x27;s tank battalions fielded 58 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, 6 M3 Bradley cavalry fighting vehicles and 6 M106A2 mortar carriers. The two tank battalions of the 155th Armored Brigade were also equipped with M1A1 Abrams tanks. The division&#x27;s and 155th brigade&#x27;s mechanized battalions fielded 54 M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, 12 M901 ITV anti-tank vehicles, 6 M3 Bradley cavalry fighting vehicles, 6 M106A2 mortar carriers.

The authorized strength for an armored J-Series division was 17,027 men, 348 M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks, 316 cavalry/infantry fighting vehicles, 72 M109 155 mm self-propelled howitzers, 9 M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, 12 M110 203 mm self-propelled howitzers (transferred in 1986 to field artillery brigades at corps level), 50 to 44 attack helicopters (50 for an all AH-1S Cobra combat aviation brigade, 44 for an all AH-64 Apache combat aviation brigade), 38 to 28 utility helicopters (38 if the Assault Aviation Company was equipped with UH-1H helicopters, 28 if the Assault Aviation Company was equipped with UH-60A Black Hawk helicopters; in the first case 2 were assigned to the aviation intermediate maintenance company as reserve), and 54 OH-58 Kiowa observation helicopters (4 assigned to divisional Aviation Office). The divisional air defense artillery battalion was to be equipped with 18 MIM-72 Chaparral and 36 M247 Sergeant York (DIVAD) systems, but with the cancelation of the York air defense battalions retained a mix of MIM-72 Chaparral, M163 Vulcan and FIM-92 Stinger systems, until the AN/TWQ-1 Avenger could be fielded, with the 1st Cavalry Division&#x27;s 4th Battalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery receiving the first systems in 1989.

==Middle East in 1990s==
===Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm===
The 1st Cavalry next fought as a heavy division, during Operation Desert Storm in January and February 1991. It participated in the Battle of Norfolk. The 1st Cavalry Division deployed in October 1990 as part of XVIII Corps. The division&#x27;s &#x27;round-out&#x27; formation, the 155th Armored Brigade was not deployed. It was planned to augment the division by attaching the Tiger Brigade from the 2nd Armored Division, but that brigade was attached to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force (1st &amp; 2nd Marine Divisions) to add heavy armor support to that force. Consequently, the 1st Cavalry Division was assigned the role of CENTCOM&#x27;s reserve. During the Ground war, was assigned to VII Corps and was crucial in the movement of ground forces to the Kuwaiti and west Saudi Arabian theaters by making two assaults into Iraqi held territory with the division&#x27;s Black Jack Brigade moving north drawing Iraqi divisions out of Kuwait to support the Iraqi units defending in Iraq. This movement was led by the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, from the Wadi Al-Batin to just north of Basra through several Iraqi divisions before stopping. The assault by M1 Abrams main battle tanks, M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, and other support vehicles moved much faster than was thought possible, catching the Iraqi Army off guard.

The 13th Signal Battalion was the first unit in the U.S. Army to deploy mobile subscriber equipment (MSE) into combat. Installing, operating, and maintaining communications equipment to support a communications network spanning over 280 kilometers, the 13th Signal Battalion again provided the division&#x27;s communications. The 13th Signal Battalion was the first unit in the U.S. Army to provide digital communications in West Asia. It was a gateway link from the Port of Dammam to the U.S. Army XVIII Airborne Corps Headquarters.

After the division returned from Kuwait, the 1st &quot;Tiger&quot; Brigade, 2nd Armored Division was reflagged as the 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (separate lineage). In response to the continued hostile movements by the Iraqi Armed Forces after Desert Storm, the U.S. Department of Defense ordered successive Operation Intrinsic Action deployments by combat brigades and special forces units to the Iraq/Kuwait border. The 1st Cavalry&#x27;s three brigades contributed heavily to the decade-long deployments from 1992 to 2002.

==Bosnia-Herzegovina==
The 1st Cavalry Division took control of the U.S. peacekeeping contingent in Bosnia-Herzegovina with approximately 6,900 personnel on 20 June 1998, as part of the multinational Stabilization Force (SFOR). The 1st Brigade served for Rotation SFOR 4. 2nd Brigade served for Rotation SFOR 5. The 2nd Brigade was alerted for action during the Russian move from Bosnia to the Pristina International Airport in June 1999, but no action was ultimately taken after consultation at the highest levels in NATO. In August 1999, the 10th Mountain Division took over operations in the Tuzla/Multinational Division North area.

== 2001–2020: War on Terror ==
Elements of the division arrived in Washington, D.C., shortly after the 11 September attacks.

===Iraq===

In October 2001 an advance party of a division brigade combat team was deployed to the Iraq/Kuwait border. Some divisional units participated in the initial 2003 invasion of Iraq. The division in its entirety deployed to Iraq in January 2004, sending an initial detachment of the 9th Cavalry Regiment into combat in September 2003. The 1st Cavalry relieved the 1st Armored Division in Baghdad. Among its subordinate formations were: Louisiana&#x27;s 256th Infantry Brigade; Arkansas&#x27; 39th Infantry Brigade; element of A Company, 28th Signal Battalion; elements of Washington&#x27;s 81st Armored Brigade; and the 2d Battalion, 162nd Infantry (Oregon Army National Guard), and Company E (Air Traffic Control Services), 126th Aviation, MA ARNG. After spending more than a year in Iraq, it redeployed back to the US by April 2005. It was relieved by the 3rd Infantry Division. Division Artillery (DIVARTY) was organized as the 5th BCT. It contained HHB, DIVARTY; 1–7 CAV; 1–8 CAV; 1–21 FA; and the 515th FSB (Provisional). The division fought in many key battles against insurgents, including the Second Battle of Fallujah in 2004, where the 2nd Brigade Combat Team engaged in house-to-house intense urban combat to root out enemy cells in the city. During its OIF2 deployment, the division assigned and attached personnel numbered approximately 40,000. 168 personnel were killed in action, with approximately 1,500 wounded.

The division assumed duties as Headquarters, Multi-National Division – Baghdad from November 2006 to December 2007. 4th Brigade Combat Team, activated in 2005, arrived in Ninawa Governorate in October and November 2006. However, 2–12 Cavalry was detached, deployed to Baghdad to augment the division efforts there.

The 3d Brigade Combat Team, &quot;Greywolf&quot;, deployed to the Diyala Province in September 2006 and fought in the Battle of Baqubah as a part of the Iraq War troop surge of 2007.

The division assumed duties as the Headquarters, Multi-National Division – Baghdad Jan 2009– Jan 2010. The deployment was extended by 23 days past the one year mark.

The 4th Brigade Combat Team &quot;Long Knife&quot; deployed to Mosul, Nineva Province, October 2006 to January 2008 and again September 2010 to September 2011.

===Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan (2001–2014)===
In November 2001, elements of the 1st Cavalry Division (3d Platoon, 545th MP CO, originally assigned to 2d Brigade &quot;BlackJack&quot; 1st Cav) deployed to Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan.

In May 2011, the division headquarters deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and assumed command of Regional Command East, replacing the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). The 1st Infantry Division HQ took command of RC-East on 19 April 2012.

In June 2014, the division headquarters returned to Afghanistan and assumed command of Regional Command South, replacing the 4th Infantry Division.

In October 2014, the division flag returned to Fort Hood, leaving its Deputy Commanding General behind as the new Train Advise Assist Command South.

Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan (OEF-A) ended in late 2014.

===Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel (2015–2021)===
After the completion of Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan, the new US deployment to Afghanistan was known as Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel.

In June 2015, the division element in TAAC South was relieved by an element from the 7th Infantry Division Headquarters.

In September 2016, the 1st Cavalry Division Headquarters deployed again to Afghanistan, this time with the 1st Cavalry Division Sustainment Brigade alongside it. The headquarters served as the United States Forces – Afghanistan National Support Element, and was also responsible for Bagram Airfield, the largest US military base in Afghanistan. It supported forces serving in the United States&#x27; Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel and NATO&#x27;s Resolute Support Mission, enabling both the international effort to train, advise, and assist the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and the counterterrorism fight. The 1st Cavalry Division Sustainment Brigade also supported both Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel and Resolute Support and was the Army&#x27;s only deployed active duty Sustainment Brigade until US forces withdrew in 2021.

===Operation Inherent Resolve===
The division&#x27;s 3d BCT deployed in February 2017 to Kuwait, and elements of 3ABCT supported operations in Iraq to retake Mosul from ISIS.

===Global missions===

The 1st Cavalry Division currently holds three of the active Army&#x27;s ten armored brigade combat teams. The division provides the Army and Combatant Commanders with trained and ready forces.

In April 2014, 2–5 Cavalry from 1st BCT, 1CD deployed to Europe to support Operation Combined Resolve II, a NATO exercise in southeastern Germany. In October 2014, 1CD returned to Europe to support its NATO partners in another pair of exercises, this time participating in Operations Combined Resolve III and Atlantic Resolve with the majority of 1ABCT.

A battalion task force from the Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division deployed to Germany in November 2015; it participated in Atlantic Resolve, then stayed in Germany for the next nine months to provide aviation support to US and NATO forces across Europe.

In June 2015, the 2d BCT was the first rotational brigade deployed to South Korea, relieving the 1st BCT, 2nd Infantry Division as it inactivated. The 2d BCT deployed for nine months; in February 2016, the 2d BCT was replaced by the 1st BCT on another nine-month rotation.

== Organization ==

The 1st Cavalry Division consists of a division headquarters and headquarters battalion, three armored brigade combat teams, a division artillery, a combat aviation brigade, and a division sustainment brigade.

=== Organization history ===
The 4th Brigade Combat Team &quot;Long Knife&quot; inactivated in October 2013 the following units: the Special Troops Battalion, 4th BCT; the 5th Battalion, 82nd Artillery; and 27th Brigade Support Battalion, with some of the companies of the latter two used to augment artillery and support battalions in the remaining three BCTs. The 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry joined the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry joined the 3rd Brigade Combat Team and the 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry joined the 1st Brigade Combat Team. The 3rd Cavalry Regiment was subordinate to the division until March 2017.

==Shoulder sleeve insignia==

The shoulder sleeve insignia was originally approved 3 January 1921, with several variations in colors of the bend and horse&#x27;s head to reflect the subordinate elements of the division. The design was authorized for wear by all subordinate elements of the division on 11 December 1934, and previous authorization for the variations was canceled. The insignia is worn subdued on field uniforms after experience in the Vietnam War, where the gold was too conspicuous. Normally, the gold is changed to the base color of the uniform to subdue it. With the retirement of the green &quot;Class A&quot; uniform in October 2015, only the subdued version of the SSI is worn, on the ACU&#x27;s left sleeve.

It consists on a yellow, triangular Norman shield with rounded corners in height overall, a black diagonal stripe extends over the shield from upper left to lower right, and in the upper right a black horse&#x27;s head cuts off diagonally at the neck, all within a 0.125-in green border.

Yellow was chosen because it is the traditional cavalry color, and the horse&#x27;s head refer to the division&#x27;s original cavalry structure. Black, symbolic of iron, alludes to the transition to tanks and armor. The black diagonal stripe represents a sword baldric and is a mark of military honor; it also implies movement &quot;up the field&quot; and thus symbolizes aggressive elan and attack. The one diagonal bend and the one horse&#x27;s head also allude to the division&#x27;s numerical designation.

==Distinctive unit insignia==
Description: A metal and enameled device, 1 inch in height overall, consisting of a gold-colored Norman shield with a black horse&#x27;s head couped in sinister chief, and a black bend charged with two five-pointed stars. Properly: Or, on a bend sable two stars of five points Or, in chief sinister a sable couped horse head, a border vert

Symbolism: The device is a miniature reproduction of the 1st Cavalry Division&#x27;s shoulder sleeve insignia with the addition of two five-pointed stars. The Division Commander and the Division Staff wore the distinctive insignia design from 1922 to 1934 as a shoulder sleeve insignia.

Background: The distinctive unit insignia was approved 25 August 1965.

The flag of the 1st Cavalry Division is a white field with the distinctive yellow triangular Norman shield with rounded corners, a black diagonal stripe extending over the shield from upper left to lower right and in the upper right a silhouetted horse&#x27;s head cut off diagonally at the neck with a green border.

==In popular culture==
* The 2002 film &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;, depicted the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, at the Battle of Ia Drang in 1965. The battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore was played by actor Mel Gibson. The battle is notable for being the first large scale helicopter air assault of the Vietnam War.
* The Division is featured in the 1979 film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1–9 Cavalry).
* In the 1981 movie, &quot;Stripes&quot;, the division insignia is displayed on the drill sergeant’s sleeve. 
* The 1986 film &quot;Platoon&quot; is an extrapolation of director (and 1st Cavalry Division veteran) Oliver Stone&#x27;s experiences in Vietnam. The characters of Sgt. Elias K. Grodin (Willem Dafoe) and S/Sgt. Robert Barnes (Tom Berenger) were real soldiers. Juan Angel Elias died in combat in Quang Tri Province, Vietnam, on 29 May 1968, serving with the 2nd Platoon, Company E, 52nd Inf. (LRP), and John Barnes served in the same platoon at the same time and retired from the Army as an SGM. In the film, Elias wears the 1st Cavalry Division&#x27;s unit insignia as his combat patch (the unit depicted in the film is: B Co, 3-22 IN, 3d BDE, 25th ID—Stone having served with both divisions).
* The 1992 book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once… and Young&quot;, along with its 2002 film adaptation, follows the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry Regiment during the Battle of Ia Drang.
* The Division was depicted in the National Geographic Channel miniseries, &quot;The Long Road Home&quot;, created by Mikko Alanne. The miniseries was based on the 2007 book &quot;The Long Road Home: A Story of War and Family&quot; by Martha Raddatz. The miniseries premiered on 7 November 2017, on National Geographic.
* The Army football team honored the Division in the 2019 Army-Navy Game with special uniforms.

<doc id="330007" wikidata="Q1573466" url="?curid=330007" title="Constitution of Greece">
<text>The Constitution of Greece () was created by the Fifth Revisionary Parliament of the Hellenes in 1974, after the fall of the Greek military junta and the start of the Third Hellenic Republic. It came into force on 11 June 1975 (adopted two days prior) and has been amended in 1986, 2001, 2008 and 2019.

The constitutional history of Greece goes back to the Greek War of Independence (1821–1832), during which the first three Greek constitutions were adopted by the revolutionary national assemblies. Syntagma Square (&quot;Plateia Syntagmatos&quot;) in Athens is named after the first constitution adopted in the modern Greek State.

==Context==
The Constitution consists of 120 articles, in four parts:
*The first part (articles 1–3), Basic Provisions, establishes Greece as a &quot;presidential parliamentary democracy&quot; (or &quot;republic&quot; – the Greek δημοκρατία can be translated both ways), and confirms the prevalence of the Orthodox Church in Greece.
*The second part (Individual and Social Rights, articles 4–25), concerns individual and social rights, whose protection has been reinforced after the Revision of 2001. The new provisions regulate subjects such as the protection of personal data and the competence of certain independent authorities.
*The third part (Organization and functions of the State, articles 26–105) describes the organization and function of the State. Article 28 formally integrates international laws and international conventions into Greek law.
*The fourth part (Special, Final and Transitory Provisions, articles 106-120) comprises special, final and transitory provisions.

==Constitutional amendments==
The Constitution of 1975 has been revised four times: in 1986, 2001, 2008 and 2019.

==Constitutional revision==
Parliament has the right to revise or amend the Constitution, except for the articles dealing with the &quot;Form of the State&quot; (the establishment of the presidential, parliamentary republic) and the articles safeguarding human rights and freedoms, which are unalterable. Revision of the Constitution is initiated by a motion by at least one sixth of MPs, and approved by a supermajority of three fifths of MPs, expressed twice, in two separate votes at least one month apart. In this case, the business of revision is transferred to the next term of Parliament, &quot;i.e.&quot;, after the following legislative elections. Parliament may then ratify the revision by a 50% plus one majority. If the initial motion for revision only achieved a 50% plus one majority, then a three fifths supermajority of the new Parliament is required. A Parliament thus endowed by its predecessor with the powers of revising the Constitution is officially named a &quot;Revisional Parliament&quot; and is enumerated separately from &quot;Ordinary&quot; Parliamentary terms. In recent years, the 1974 Parliament was titled &quot;5th Revisional&quot;, as it operated under, and amended, the 1952 constitution. The resulting constitution of 1975 was essentially an entirely new constitution, especially so since it incorporated the outcome of the 1974 plebiscite that established the republic in the place of constitutional monarchy. Nevertheless, it was officially deemed a revision of the 1952 one. The 1986 parliament was the &quot;6th Revisional&quot;; the 2001 one the &quot;7th Revisional Parliament&quot;; the 2004 Parliament was the &quot;11th Ordinary Parliament&quot; of the Third Hellenic Republic; the 2007 Parliament was the &quot;8th Revisional Parliament&quot;; the 2009 Parliament was the &quot;12th Ordinary&quot;; the first 2012 Parliament which resulted from the national election held on 6 May was the &quot;13th Ordinary&quot; (also referred to as the &quot;Parliament of one day&quot;, because it formed for one day, only to be dismissed again in order for 17 June national election to be held, since no governmental majority could be secured) and the sitting 2012 Parliament is the &quot;14th Ordinary&quot;. A minimum of five years must elapse after the successful conclusion of the revision process, before another may be initiated.

==Constitutional history of Greece==


During the modern history of Greece, the Constitution of 1975/1986/2001/2008/2019 is the last in a series of democratically adopted Constitutions (with the exception of the Constitutions of 1968 and 1973 imposed by a dictatorship). The first of these Constitutions was adopted in 1822. 
The current constitution is formally a major revision of the constitution of 1952, as effected by the 5th Revisional Parliament.

<text>An Official Secrets Act (OSA) is legislation that provides for the protection of state secrets and official information, mainly related to national security. However, in its unrevised form (based on the UK Official Secrets Act 1911), it can include all information held by government bodies.

OSAs are currently in-force in over 40 countries (mostly former British colonies) including Bangladesh, Kenya, Pakistan, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Myanmar, Uganda, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom, and have previously existed in Canada and New Zealand.

There were earlier English and British precedents, long before the acts enumerated here. As early as the 16th Century, following Francis Drake&#x27;s circumnavigation, Queen Elizabeth I declared that all written accounts of Drake&#x27;s voyages were to become the &quot;Queen&#x27;s secrets of the Realm&quot;. In addition, Drake and the other participants of his voyages were sworn to their secrecy on the pain of death; the Queen intended to keep Drake&#x27;s activities away from the eyes of rival Spain.

==Countries and legislation==
=== Australia===
Australia previously had Part VII of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth), entitled &quot;Official Secrets and Unlawful Soundings&quot;, since repealed and replaced with Part 5.6 – Secrecy of Information of the Criminal Code Act (1995).

===Canada===
The British Official Secrets Act 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. 52) was adopted in Canada with minor modifications in 1890. Its provisions became part of the Criminal Code in 1892. The &quot;Official Secrets Act (Canada) 1939&quot; replaced the Criminal Code provisions and utilised the provisions of the British Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1920. Amendments were made in 1950, 1967, 1970 and 1973. The &quot;Official Secrets Act (Canada) 1981&quot; was the final version of that law adopted by the House of Commons. 

In 2001, the Act was repealed and replaced by the &quot;Security of Information Act&quot;, created in the wake of September 11, 2001 attacks to replace the vaguely-worded Official Secrets Act.
Twenty-two prosecutions occurred under the &quot;Official Secrets Act&quot; in Canada, over half of which were in relation to the Gouzenko Affair. In 1989, Stephen Joseph Ratkai was charged and convicted under the Act, of espionage in relation to the SOSUS network site at Naval Station Argentia in Newfoundland.

===Hong Kong===
Hong Kong has the Official Secrets Ordinance 1997 (Cap. 521), in which it is largely based on the British Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989.

===India===
===Ireland===
Ireland has the Official Secrets Act 1963, that repealed the previous British legislation of 1911 and 1920. The Official Secrets Act, as amended, applies to all civil servants and potentially anyone within the state. A suit may only be instigated at the approval of the Attorney General of Ireland, additionally proceedings may occur in camera but the verdict and any sentence must occur in public.

===Jersey===
Jersey has the Official Secrets (Jersey) Law 1952.

===Malaysia===
Malaysia has the Official Secrets Act 1972, prohibiting the collection, possession or distribution of information marked as an official secret – an action which can be made by any public officer. The certification of a document as an official secret is not subject to judicial review, and a violation of the act is punishable with between one and seven years&#x27; imprisonment. The act has been controversial for its use to silence dissent and stifling anti-corruption activities.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the Official Secrets Act 1951 was repealed by the Official Information Act 1982.

===Pakistan===
===Singapore===
In Singapore, the Official Secrets Act (Cap. 213, 2012 Rev. Ed.) prohibits the disclosure of official documents and information. 

The Act was first introduced to Singapore in 1935 as the Official Secrets Ordinance. Section 5 of the Act prohibits the wrongful communication of information that is considered sensitive by the government.

===United Kingdom===
The Official Secrets Acts (OSA) of the UK comprise several laws aimed at the protection of state secrets and the prevention of espionage. The key Acts are the Official Secrets Act 1889, 1911, 1920, 1939 and 1989.

Individuals working with sensitive information are often required to sign a statement affirming their agreement to adhere to the restrictions of the OSA, colloquially known as &quot;signing the Official Secrets Act&quot;. However, signing this statement does not alter the legal obligations, as the Act is a law, not a contract, and its provisions apply irrespective of whether an individual has signed the statement. The signature serves primarily as a reminder of the obligations under the Act.

The now-repealed Naval Discipline Act 1957 also played a role in protecting sensitive information by making it an offence to spy on-board Royal Navy ships or overseas bases, punishable by life imprisonment, and previously a capital offence until 1981.

==== Recent developments and criticism ====
Jarvis provides a critical analysis of these Acts. He highlights that the laws have been criticised for being outdated and not adequately addressing contemporary issues related to information technology and modern espionage. Jarvis points out the lack of a &#x27;public interest&#x27; defence in the current legislation, which has been a significant point of contention among legal experts, media, and public advocacy groups. 

According to Jarvis, the current framework allows the government to wield the OSA in a manner that can prevent politically embarrassing disclosures rather than purely safeguarding national security. This has led to calls for reform, including recommendations from the Law Commission to modernise the Acts, introduce clearer language, and incorporate provisions that balance state security with transparency and public interest.

==== National Security Act 2023 ====
In response to ongoing concerns and to address the evolving landscape of national security threats, the UK enacted the National Security Act 2023. This new legislation aims to modernise the country&#x27;s approach to safeguarding official data and combating espionage, reflecting the recommendations put forth by the Law Commission and other stakeholders.

The National Security Act 2023 introduces several key features aimed at addressing contemporary security challenges. It modernises the language and definitions used in previous Official Secrets Acts, making them relevant to current threats and technologies. The Act expands the scope of espionage to include cyber threats and other modern tactics, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all potential security risks. Notably, it introduces a public interest defence for the first time, allowing individuals to argue that their disclosure was justified in the public interest, thereby protecting whistleblowers who expose government wrongdoing or illegal activities. Additionally, the Act imposes stricter penalties for breaches of national security, reflecting the gravity of these offences in today&#x27;s context. To ensure accountability and transparency, an independent statutory commissioner is established to oversee investigations into alleged breaches of the Act.

===United States===

The United States does not have a broad-reaching Official Secrets Act, although the Espionage Act of 1917 has similar components. Much of the Espionage Act remains in force, although some has been struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional because of the First Amendment (see &quot;United States v. The Progressive&quot;, &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot;, &quot;New York Times Co. v. United States&quot;). , enacted in 1951, makes dissemination of secret information involving cryptography, espionage, and surveillance illegal for all people, and is thus an &quot;official secrets act&quot; limited to those subjects.

<doc id="330017" wikidata="Q17007827" url="?curid=330017" title="Discretization">
<text>In applied mathematics, discretization is the process of transferring continuous functions, models, variables, and equations into counterparts. This process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers. Dichotomization is the special case of discretization in which the number of discrete classes is 2, which can approximate a continuous variable as a binary variable (creating a dichotomy for modeling purposes, as in binary classification).

Discretization is also related to discrete mathematics, and is an important component of granular computing. In this context, &quot;discretization&quot; may also refer to modification of variable or category &quot;granularity&quot;, as when multiple discrete variables are aggregated or multiple discrete categories fused.

Whenever continuous data is discretized, there is always some amount of discretization error. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered for the modeling purposes at hand.

 The terms &quot;discretization &quot; and &quot;quantization&quot; often have the same denotation but not always identical connotations. (Specifically, the two terms share a semantic field.) The same is true of discretization error and quantization error.

Mathematical methods relating to discretization include the Euler–Maruyama method and the zero-order hold.

== Discretization of linear state space models ==
Discretization is also concerned with the transformation of continuous differential equations into discrete difference equations, suitable for numerical computing.

The following continuous-time state space model

formula_1

where and are continuous zero-mean white noise sources with power spectral densities

formula_2

can be discretized, assuming zero-order hold for the input and continuous integration for the noise , to

formula_3

with covariances

formula_4

where

formula_5

and is the sample time. If is nonsingular, formula_6

The equation for the discretized measurement noise is a consequence of the continuous measurement noise being defined with a power spectral density.

A clever trick to compute and in one step is by utilizing the following property:

formula_7

Where and are the discretized state-space matrices.

=== Discretization of process noise ===
Numerical evaluation of is a bit trickier due to the matrix exponential integral. It can, however, be computed by first constructing a matrix, and computing the exponential of it
formula_8
The discretized process noise is then evaluated by multiplying the transpose of the lower-right partition of with the upper-right partition of :
formula_9

=== Derivation ===
Starting with the continuous model
formula_10
we know that the matrix exponential is
formula_11
and by premultiplying the model we get
formula_12
which we recognize as
formula_13
and by integrating,
formula_14
which is an analytical solution to the continuous model.

Now we want to discretise the above expression. We assume that is constant during each timestep.
formula_15
We recognize the bracketed expression as formula_16, and the second term can be simplified by substituting with the function formula_17. Note that formula_18. We also assume that is constant during the integral, which in turn yields

formula_19

which is an exact solution to the discretization problem.

When is singular, the latter expression can still be used by replacing formula_20 by its Taylor expansion,
formula_21
This yields
formula_22
which is the form used in practice.

=== Approximations ===
Exact discretization may sometimes be intractable due to the heavy matrix exponential and integral operations involved. It is much easier to calculate an approximate discrete model, based on that for small timesteps formula_23. The approximate solution then becomes:
formula_24

This is also known as the Euler method, which is also known as the forward Euler method. Other possible approximations are formula_25, otherwise known as the backward Euler method and formula_26, which is known as the bilinear transform, or Tustin transform. Each of these approximations has different stability properties. The bilinear transform preserves the instability of the continuous-time system.

== Discretization of continuous features ==
In statistics and machine learning, discretization refers to the process of converting continuous features or variables to discretized or nominal features. This can be useful when creating probability mass functions.

== Discretization of smooth functions ==
In generalized functions theory, discretization
arises as a particular case of the Convolution Theorem
on tempered distributions

: formula_27
: formula_28

where formula_29 is the Dirac comb,
formula_30 is discretization, formula_31 is
periodization, formula_32 is a rapidly decreasing tempered distribution
(e.g. a Dirac delta function formula_33 or any other
compactly supported function), formula_34 is a smooth,
slowly growing
ordinary function (e.g. the function that is constantly formula_35
or any other band-limited function)
and formula_36 is the (unitary, ordinary frequency) Fourier transform.
Functions formula_34 which are not smooth can be made smooth using a mollifier prior to discretization.

As an example, discretization of the function that is constantly formula_35 yields the sequence formula_39 which, interpreted as the coefficients of a linear combination of Dirac delta functions, forms a Dirac comb. If additionally truncation is applied, one obtains finite sequences, e.g. formula_40. They are discrete in both, time and frequency.

<text>This is a list of settlements in [[Cyprus]]. The English name is indicated first, followed by the Greek and Turkish names, in turn followed by any former names, including ones used in antiquity. Note that even though, prior to the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Turkish names existed for some villages/towns, due to political reasons, most of the villages/towns were given a different Turkish name. The largest cities in Cyprus, in order from largest, are Nicosia (capital), Limassol, Larnaca, Paphos, Famagusta and Kyrenia.

=== District capital cities ===
Note that not all North Cyprus District capital cities are also District capital cities of the Republic of Cyprus.
=== Municipalities ===
Municipalities are under the de facto control of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Turkish names were established in 1958, then some of them were altered after the Turkish invasion (e.g. Morphou in Nicosia District). Note that not all North Cyprus Municipalities are also Municipalities of the Republic of Cyprus.
=== Minor towns and villages ===
Towns and villages, illegally occupied since the 1974 Turkish invasion and sub-sequentially under the de facto control of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Turkish names were established in 1958, then some of them were altered after the Turkish invasion (e.g. Kourou Monastiri in Nicosia District).

<text>Poel () or Poel Island (), is an island in the Baltic Sea. It forms the natural northern and eastern boundaries of the Bay of Wismar on the German coast. The northern coast of the island is also on the south side of the large gulf known as the Bay of Mecklenburg, which Wismar Bay enters into. Insel Poel thus forms on its northern side the unofficial latitude of the northern boundary of the Wismar Bay.
It is close to the cities of Lübeck, Wismar and Schwerin and is part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region.

Administratively it is a municipality in the Nordwestmecklenburg district. It consists of Kirchdorf and Oertzenhof (the main towns) and the smaller villages of Timmendorf, Wangern, Hinterwangern, Weitendorf, Weitendorf-Hof, Brandenhusen, Neuhof, Seedorf, Niendorf, Schwarzer Busch, Kaltenhof, Fährdorf, Malchow, Vorwerk and Gollwitz. It covers an area of and has 2,873 citizens. Satellite pictures show that most of it is used as farmland. With its good air, clean water, fine beaches and sheltered harbours, it is also popular recreational area. At Timmendorf harbour there are a pilot&#x27;s station and facilities for yachts and local fishermen. Kirchdorf has a yachting harbour and a boatyard. Wismar Bay is cited by the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1910-1911) as the finest harbor on the Baltic.

The island&#x27;s name derives from &quot;pole&quot;, the Common Slavic word for &quot;flat land&quot; or &quot;field&quot;.

== History ==

Poel&#x27;s first inhabitants in historic times were Slavs, belonging to the West Mecklenburgian tribe of the Obotrites. The Slavic ruler and Lord of Mecklenburg Heinrich Borwin I brought German settlers from the providences of Dithmarschen and Holstein to the island in the early 13th century. They began building the church on Poel around 1210. The church was built in four or five periods and was completed around 1350. The tower (the oldest part of the building) is in Romanesque style, and with its 47 meters it is visible from almost all points on the island. The church nave was originally Romanesque in style, was enlargened however around 1300 with a long and high choir and at that time changed into the Gothic style. The church which still remains a major sightseeing attraction on the island contains two winged Marian altars from the 15th century, a triumphal cross from around 1450, a rare Danish gravestone from the 13th century and the model of a Zeesenboat from 1936. Since about 1535 it is a Lutheran Church. Besides the weekly Divine Service there are also many concerts with classical music in the church during the summer months.

In 1614 Duke of Mecklenburg Adolf Friedrich I started the construction of a fortress on the island in the vicinity of the church, making use of the strategically good location. In 1618 it was completed. In June 1620 Gustav II Adolf of Sweden visited his cousin Duke Johann Albrecht II here, and in September of that same year his bride-to-be, Princess Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, visited the island and stayed at the castle on the way to her marriage in Stockholm. She was received by Duke Johann Albrecht II with a festive worship service in the church and will a feast that went on for several days. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the Duke had to give up the castle to enemy imperial troops (= Catholic coalition) in 1628. General Wallenstein ruled over Mecklenburg for several years.

In 1631 Gustav Adolf helped the dukes of Mecklenburg regain their power, and Johann Albrecht II returned to Poel finding the castle in a desolate condition. When Mecklenburg signed a truce with Emperor Ferdinand II (Holy Roman Empire) in 1635, the Swedes invaded the land and took over the castle on Poel. The emperor&#x27;s troops returned in 1638, drove the Swedes away and burned several villages.

After the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 two-thirds of Poel together with Wismar and the municipality of Neukloster were granted to the King of Sweden. The western third of the island remained the property of the Holy-Spirit-Hospital (Heiligen-Geist-Hospital) in Lübeck which had already had this endowment for several centuries. The Swedes were in possession of the castle on Poel but had no interest in it, since they invested all their money and efforts in making Wismar a major military centre on the Baltic Sea. The castle quickly deteriorated and by 1740 there were only ruins left.

In the 19th century the inhabitants of Poel were allowed to use the bricks to build their homes and barns so that the buildings were completely disassembled. Today one still can see the impressive earthen embankments and most of the moats which were constructed between 1614 and 1618 for defense purposes. The castle grounds were formed in a five-pointed star form, and the church with its grounds (see above) were enclosed into a similar defense compound in the shape of the tail of a star (the so-called &quot;Hornewerck&quot;). In November 1802 the House of Mecklenburg under the leadership of Duke Friedrich Franz I came in possession of the property of the Holy-Spirit-Hospital in Lübeck. The Swedish portion of the island was leased for 99 years by the Duke in 1803. It officially remained in Swedish possession until 1903, when it completely returned to Mecklenburg.

Since the 17th century Poel has been connected to the mainland with dams and bridges. Since 1927 the island has been connected to the mainland by a causeway.

In 2003 a sister city treaty was signed with Hammarö Municipality, an island in lake Vänern in Sweden.

Nearby Walfisch island was also fortified.

<doc id="330025" wikidata="Q1401710" url="?curid=330025" title="KoalaPad">
<text>The KoalaPad is a graphics tablet, released in 1983 by US company Koala Technologies Corporation, for the Apple II, TRS-80 Color Computer (as the TRS-80 Touch Pad), Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, and IBM PC compatibles.

Originally designed by Dr. David Thornburg as a low-cost computer drawing tool for schools, the Koala Pad and the bundled drawing program, KoalaPainter, was popular with home users as well. KoalaPainter was called KoalaPaint in some versions for the Apple II, and PC Design for the IBM PC. A program called Graphics Exhibitor was included for creating slideshow presentations from KoalaPainter drawings.

==Description==
The pad was four inches square (i.e. roughly 10×10 cm) and mounted on a slightly inclined base with the back of the pad higher than the front. At the top, &quot;behind&quot; the pad, were two buttons. The pad hooked into the computer using the analog signals of the joystick ports (the so-called paddle inputs), which meant that it had a low resolution and tended to jostle the cursor if moved during use.

As an alternative to the drawing stylus, the pad could as easily be operated by the user&#x27;s fingers for tasks that demanded less precision, such as selecting between menu items (thus using the pad as a kind of &quot;indirect touch screen&quot;).

The top-mounted buttons tended to be somewhat frustrating to use, as the user had to &quot;reach around&quot; the stylus to push the buttons in order to start or stop drawing. A similar tablet from Atari, the Atari CX77 Touch Tablet, addressed this with a built-in button on the stylus, which some enterprising users adapted for use with their KoalaPad.

==KoalaPainter==

The pad shipped with a simple bitmap graphics editor developed by Audio Light called KoalaPainter, PC Design or Micro Illustrator depending on the target machine (see release history). Although bundled with the pad, KoalaPainter could also be operated using an ordinary digital joystick.

One unique feature of the program, for its time, was that it held two pictures in the computer&#x27;s memory, allowing the user to flip from one to the other—a function commonly used in order to study the differences between an original and a modified picture, and to copy and paste between two different pictures.

Some third-party bitmap editors could also be used with the KoalaPad, such as Broderbund&#x27;s Dazzle Draw for the Apple II.

===Release history===
*KoalaPainter for Commodore 64 (1983) and Atari 8-bit computers (1983)
*PC Design for the IBM PC (1983) 
*Micro Illustrator for the Apple II (1983), Atari 8-bit computers (1983) and Commodore Plus/4 (1984)
*KoalaPainter II for Commodore 64 (1984)

===Reception===
&quot;Ahoy!&quot; called KoalaPainter &quot;a very powerful and effective color drawing package&quot;, and concluded that it and the KoalaPad were &quot;excellent in ease of use, a fine choice for a beginner as well as young children&quot;. &quot;BYTE&quot;″s reviewer stated in December 1984 that he made far fewer errors when using an Apple Mouse with MousePaint than with a KoalaPad and its software. He found that MousePaint was easier to use and more efficient, predicting that the mouse would receive more software support than the pad. Cassie Stahl in &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; praised the tablet and its documentation, rating it &quot;Excellent&quot; among all categories and stating that &quot;Playing with the KoalaPad becomes addictive. It does everything it claims to, and it does it well&quot;. She also liked Micro Illustrator, rating it &quot;Excellent&quot; except for &quot;Good&quot; for Performance. While criticizing the limited erase function, Stahl reported an undocumented feature enabling exporting pictures to other software.

===File format===
The Commodore 64 version of KoalaPainter used a fairly simple file format corresponding directly to the way bitmapped graphics are handled on the computer: A two-byte load address, followed immediately by 8,000 bytes of raw bitmap data, 1,000 bytes of raw &quot;Video Matrix&quot; data, 1,000 bytes of raw &quot;Color RAM&quot; data, and a one-byte Background Color field.

==KoalaWare==
Koala Technologies offered more software beyond the bundled KoalaPainter and Graphics Exhibitor for use with the pad. Among these applications, marketed under the moniker KoalaWare (like KoalaPainter itself), was educational software for use with customized keypads and overlays, such as spelling tools, music programs, and mathematics instruction software, as well as software for &quot;translating&quot; graphical designs into LOGO programs.

<doc id="330027" wikidata="Q1200164" url="?curid=330027" title="White Sands National Park">
<text>White Sands National Park is a national park of the United States located in New Mexico and completely surrounded by the White Sands Missile Range. The park covers in the Tularosa Basin, including the southern 41% of a field of white sand dunes composed of gypsum crystals. This gypsum dunefield is the largest of its kind on Earth, with a depth of about , dunes as tall as , and about 4.5 billion short tons (4.1 billion metric tons) of gypsum sand.

Approximately 12,000 years ago, the land within the Tularosa Basin featured large lakes, streams, grasslands, and Ice Age mammals. As the climate warmed, rain and snowmelt dissolved gypsum from the surrounding mountains and carried it into the basin. Further warming and drying caused the lakes to evaporate and form selenite crystals. Strong winds then broke up crystals and transported them eastward. A similar process continues to produce gypsum sand today.

Thousands of species of animal inhabit the park, a large portion of which are invertebrates. Several animal species feature a white or off-white coloration. At least 45 species are endemic, living only in this park, with 40 of them being moth species. The Tularosa Basin has also seen a number of human inhabitants, from Paleo-Indians 12,000 years ago to modern farmers, ranchers, and miners.

White Sands National Park was originally designated White Sands National Monument on January 18, 1933, by President Herbert Hoover. Since 1941, the park has been completely surrounded by the military installations of White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base. It was redesignated as a national park by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump on December 20, 2019. It is the most visited NPS site in New Mexico, with about 600,000 visitors each year. The park features a drive from the visitor center to the heart of the dunes, picnic areas, backcountry campground in the dunefield, marked hiking trails, and sledding on the dunes. Ranger-guided orientation and nature walks occur at various times and months throughout the year.

==History==
===Native people===

The potentially oldest known human footprints in North America were found at White Sands by researchers who identified approximately 60 fossilized footprints buried in layers of gypsum soil on a large playa in the Tularosa Basin. Multiple human footprints are stratigraphically constrained and bracketed by layers containing seeds of &quot;Ruppia cirrhosa&quot; that yield calibrated radiocarbon ages between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The present consensus for human arrival into North America is placed at 13–16,000 years ago. Initially, these estimates were questioned by other authors, who suggested that the dating could potentially be erroneus, due to the fact that &quot;Ruppia cirrhosa&quot; intakes carbon from the water in which it grows rather than the air, which may introduce systematic error making the seeds seem older than they actually are. However, the date was later supported by a variety of methods, including radiocarbon dating of pollen and optically stimulated luminescence dating of quartz grains within the footprint layers. Other tracks are known for extinct megafauna, including ground sloths (likely either &quot;Nothrotheriops&quot; or &quot;Paramylodon&quot;) and Columbian mammoths, which appear to be contemporaneous to human footprints.

Paleo-Indians inhabited the shoreline of Lake Otero, a large lake that covered much of the Tularosa Basin. They used stone from the mountains to create projectile points, known as Folsom and Plano points, and attached them to spears for hunting mammoths, camels, ground sloths, and bison. Projectile points and stone tools have been found in the basin associated with ancient shorelines, streams, and hills. As the large ice sheet that capped the North American continent receded, Lake Otero began to evaporate, leaving behind Alkali Flat and Lake Lucero. The grassland died and the basin became increasingly arid, slowly changing into desert scrubland. The megafauna disappeared from the basin leaving behind fossil footprints.

The Archaic people improved upon the hand thrown spear used by Paleo-Indians with the invention of the atlatl. After Lake Otero dried out, wind carried large quantities of gypsum sand up from the basin floor which accumulated into a large dunefield. Archaic people entered the Tularosa Basin about 4,000 years ago, after the dunes had stabilized, possibly attracted by a cereal grass called Indian ricegrass. The first evidence of agriculture is found in the Archaic period. Archaic peoples would tend to wild plants so they would produce in a more reliable manner and in larger quantities than they did naturally. Archaic people started living in small villages throughout the year to tend their fields. Hearth mounds are found within the dunes, which are the remains of prehistoric fires containing charcoal and ash. When gypsum is heated to it becomes a plaster that hardens when moisture is added and subsequently evaporates. The plaster cements these hearths in place, preserving them for thousands of years.

The Jornada Mogollon people made pottery, lived in permanent houses, and farmed the Tularosa Basin. Evidence of their prehistoric presence dates back to about 200 CE. The Jornada Mogollon inhabited the basin until about 1350 CE when they moved away, leaving behind puddled adobe structures and pottery sherds.
Over 700 years ago, bands of Apaches followed herds of bison from the Great Plains to the Tularosa Basin. The Apaches were nomadic hunters and gatherers who lived in temporary houses known as wickiups and teepees. The Apaches had established a sizable territory in southern New Mexico by the time European explorers arrived. They fiercely defended the rights to their homeland against the encroachment of colonial settlers. Apache groups, led by Victorio and Geronimo, fought with settlers in the basin and engaged in military battles with Buffalo Soldiers. The Battle of Hembrillo Basin in 1880 was a military engagement between Victorio&#x27;s warriors and the United States Army&#x27;s 9th Cavalry Regiment of Buffalo Soldiers. The battleground, located on White Sands Missile Range, is the closest archaeological evidence of the Apache Wars (1849 to 1924). Conflict between the Apaches and the American settlers over their conflicting interests in the basin ultimately ended in the forceful removal of the Apaches from their homelands to the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation. The Mescalero Apache maintain an active cultural affinity to the landscape of their ancestors.

===Euro-Americans===
While a Spanish colony was established to the north around Santa Fe, the Tularosa Basin was generally avoided until the nineteenth century. The basin lacked any reliable water sources and was the primary stronghold of local Apaches who stole livestock from Pueblo and Spanish settlements near the basin. When Spaniards did enter the basin, they traveled along established trails to the salt pan north of Alkali Flat. Spanish colonists had established the salt trails in 1647, to connect the salt deposits with the Camino Real in El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Juárez) and silver mines in Durango, Mexico. Salt is a fundamental element in the processing of silver ore. Expeditionary parties using mule-drawn carts with military escorts would be formed a few times each year for the journey to the salinas (salt pans).

Hispanic populations throughout the Spanish colonial and Mexican periods were allowed to gather salt from the salinas, which were considered public property. Texan-American settlers made private claims to the land to profit from mining of minerals on their property. James Magoffin held a title to the salt flats north of Lake Lucero but had been unsuccessful in collecting fees for salt gathering. In 1854, using military force, he intercepted a salt gathering expedition of Hispanos from Doña Ana at the salt flats and fatally wounded three members of the party. In response to Magoffin&#x27;s use of extreme force during the Magoffin Salt War, the courts dissolved his property claim to the salt flats and established a precedent for free public access to salt deposits.

The first US Army exploration of south-central New Mexico was led by a party of topographical engineering officers in 1849. They passed west of the San Andres Mountains and Organ Mountains. A lieutenant was dispatched east across the basin with a scouting party to map a potential military wagon route to the Sierra Blanca.

Hispanic families started farming communities at Tularosa in 1861 and La Luz in 1863. The villagers mixed water with gypsum sand from the dunefield to create plaster for the adobe walls of their homes. The white color was not only decorative but functional in deflecting the rays of the summer sun.
In the 1880s, a brief period of heavy rainfall supported the return of lush grasslands in the Tularosa Basin which attracted the attention of goat, sheep, and cattle grazers, predominately from Texas. Large cattle drives pushed into the basin, and ranching became the dominant economy for the next sixty years. In 1897, the Lucero brothers, Jose, Felipe, and Estevan, began ranching on the south shore of the lake that would eventually bear their name. By 1940, Felipe consolidated the family&#x27;s ranches into a property. Shortly afterward, the National Park Service took over ownership of the Lucero family properties with their appropriation of Lake Lucero and Alkali Flat. The remnants of the Lucero family ranch include the stock pens, watering trough, a water well, and a fallen windmill which visitors can see on a ranger-led tour to Lake Lucero once each month, in the cooler months of the year.

At the turn of the twentieth century, the discovery of oil, coal, silver, gold, and other precious mineral deposits inspired many settlers to cover the Tularosa Basin in mining claims. By 1904, over 114 people made mineral claims to more than of Lake Lucero; however, very few of the claims were developed. Eddy&#x27;s Soda Prospect, developed by the same Eddy brothers that had founded the El Paso and Northeastern Railway and the town of Alamogordo, was a mineral recovery operation for glauberite salt mining along the southern shore of Lake Lucero. In 1907, J.R. Milner and Bill Fetz constructed a plaster of Paris batching plant along the southern edge of the dunes. The operation involved drilling long shafts into the dunes and extracting gypsum to cook into plaster at night. Though successful, the establishment of the national monument permanently shut down the plant.

===National monument===

The idea of creating a national park to protect the white sands formation dates to 1898 when a group from El Paso, Texas, proposed the creation of Mescalero National Park. The plan failed as it included a game hunting preserve that conflicted with the idea of preservation held by the Department of the Interior.

From 1912 to 1922, Albert B. Fall, a Senator from New Mexico—later appointed Secretary of the Interior—and the owner of a large ranch in Three Rivers northeast of the dune field, promoted four separate bills in Congress for a national park in the Tularosa Basin. Fall&#x27;s ultimate plan was called the All-Year National Park as it would be open throughout the year, unlike more northerly parks. The bill included four geographically separate and diverse areas, to be administered as one national park. The proposed areas included a scenic portion of the Mescalero Indian reservation, of the dune field, 640 acres of a volcanic area to the north named Carrizozo Malpais, and the shoreline of the Elephant Butte Reservoir to the west, beyond the San Andres Mountains. Stephen Mather, the director of the National Park Service, criticized the proposal as having &quot;disjointed boundaries, lack of spectacular scenery, and questionable usage.&quot; The National Parks Association and the Indian Rights Association campaigned against Fall&#x27;s bill, mainly because of the appropriation of Indian reservation land and that it might establish a precedent of industrial usage within parks. The bill failed in Congress, and Fall resigned in 1923 during the Teapot Dome scandal.

During the 1920s, an Alamogordo businessman named Tom Charles promoted the potential economic benefits of protecting the white sands formation. Charles mobilized enough local support for the construction of an improved state route between Las Cruces and Alamogordo (now U.S. Route 70), passing the southern edge of the dune field. He lobbied to have the dunes declared a national park, but was advised by Senator Bronson M. Cutting, who had influence with President Herbert Hoover, that national monument status would be much easier to obtain.

On January 18, 1933, President Hoover designated White Sands National Monument, acting under the authority of the Antiquities Act of 1906. The dedication and grand opening was on April 29, 1934. Tom Charles became the first custodian of the monument, and the first concessionaire in 1939, operating as White Sands Service Company.

The visitor center and a nearby comfort station, three ranger residences, as well as three maintenance buildings were constructed of adobe bricks as a Works Progress Administration project starting in 1936 and completed in 1938. The original eight adobe buildings and other nearby structures were designated the White Sands National Monument Historic District when they were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The principal architects were Lyle E. Bennett and Robert W. Albers, who also designed NPS buildings together at Casa Grande and Bandelier national monuments. Bennett also designed the picnic table shelters at White Sands, the Painted Desert Inn at Petrified Forest, and buildings at Carlsbad Caverns and Mesa Verde national parks.
The park is completely surrounded by the military installations of White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base, and has always had an uneasy relationship with the military. The missile range and air force base were established after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, with continuing operations after World War II and throughout the Cold War. Errant missiles often fell within the park&#x27;s boundaries, occasionally destroying some of the visitor areas. Overflights from Holloman disturbed the tranquility of the area. Flight training missions continue over the dunefield, and the park closes temporarily for several hours during missile tests in the adjacent range and cooperative use area on the west side of the park.

Between 1969 and 1977, 95 oryx were released on the missile range and adjacent areas of the Tularosa Basin by the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish for hunting purposes. The oryx, having no natural predators, entered the park and competed with native species for forage. Thousands of oryx reside on the missile range presently, though annual hunts have occurred since 1974 to help control and stabilize the population. The National Park Service, concerned about the negative effects on native plants and animals within the park, erected a long boundary fence in 1996 to prevent oryx from entering.

Increasingly problematic alcohol abuse by students on spring break in the 1990s led to a ban on the consumption of alcohol. The possession of alcohol or alcohol containers is banned throughout the park from February 1 to May 31.

===World Heritage Site controversy===
White Sands was placed on a tentative list of potential World Heritage Sites on January 22, 2008. The state&#x27;s two U.S. Senators, Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman, wrote letters of support of the application. U.S. Representative Steve Pearce declined to support the application, saying, &quot;I would guarantee that if White Sands Monument receives this designation, that there will at some point be international pressures exerted that could stop military operations as we know them today.&quot;

The WHS application generated much controversy in Otero County, most of it taking place in meetings of the Otero County Commission. A petition with 1,200 signatures opposing the application was presented to the commission on August 16, 2007. The commission passed a resolution of opposition to the application on August 23, 2007, and passed Ordinance 07-05 on October 18, 2007, relating to any potential World Heritage Site designations within the county. The ordinance requires coordination with the county in following its environmental planning and review process through its Public Land Use Advisory Council, and states that &quot;No world heritage site...will be located on or adjacent to any military land...within or adjacent to the boundaries of Otero County.&quot; On January 24, 2008, after the WHS tentative list was announced, the commission instructed the county attorney to write a letter to the Secretary of the Interior, demanding that WSNM be taken off the list.

===National park bill===
In May 2018, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (Democrat, New Mexico) introduced a bill to designate White Sands a national park. Heinrich consulted with monument officials, the National Park Service, White Sands Missile Range, the U.S. Army and Holloman Air Force Base before the bill was introduced in Congress. The bill was supported by the Alamogordo City Commission; the Las Cruces City Council; the Mescalero Apache Tribal Council; the Town of Mesilla Board of Trustees; Alamogordo Mayor Richard Boss; New Mexico Senator Ron Griggs (Republican); the Alamogordo Chamber of Commerce; the Greater Las Cruces Chamber of Commerce; the Las Cruces Green Chamber of Commerce; the National Parks Conservation Association and the Southern New Mexico Public Lands Alliance. The bill was opposed, however, by Otero County commissioners, who stated that the main argument in favor of national park status was the potential for increased visitation, while also noting that the monument is already the most-visited NPS site in the state. The commissioners were also concerned that &quot;the change in status will affect filmmaking here either from higher fees or increased regulation.&quot; The commissioners only supported boundary adjustments and additional infrastructure, such as campgrounds and improved road access. The Doña Ana County commissioners also opposed the redesignation of White Sands as a national park. The redesignation bill was re-introduced on March 27, 2019.

On December 11, 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, which includes legislation redesignating White Sands National Monument as White Sands National Park. The Senate passed the act on December 16 and President Donald Trump signed the bill on December 20. The act includes the transfer of land management both to and from the missile range, as well as the protection of additional land, adding a net to the park.

===Filming===
White Sands, during its period as a national monument, has been used as a filming location for scenes in several westerns, including &quot;Four Faces West&quot; (1948), &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; (1968), &quot;The Hired Hand&quot; (1971), &quot;My Name Is Nobody&quot; (1973), &quot;Bite the Bullett&quot; (1975), and &quot;Young Guns II&quot; (1990). Additional feature-length films with location shooting in the park include &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1950), &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; (1976), &quot;White Sands&quot; (1992), &quot;Transformers&quot; (2007), &quot;&quot; (2009), &quot;The Men Who Stare at Goats&quot; (2009), &quot;Year One&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; (2010). Wye Oak&#x27;s title track for the album &quot;The Louder I Call, the Faster It Runs&quot; (2018) was filmed at White Sands. &quot;Yoga Mind &amp; Body&quot; (1994), featuring yoga teacher Erich Schiffmann and actress Ali MacGraw, was also filmed on the dunes.

==Geography==
White Sands National Park is located in southern New Mexico, on the north side of U.S. Route 70 approximately southwest of Alamogordo and northeast of Las Cruces, in western Otero County and northeastern Doña Ana County. The closest commercial airport is in El Paso, Texas, about away. The park is situated in the Tularosa Basin with elevations ranging from at Lake Lucero, to at a former military site called NE 30.

The park&#x27;s primary feature is the field of white sand dunes composed of gypsum crystals. The gypsum dunefield is the largest of its kind on Earth. The park protects of the dunefield, about 42%, while the remaining are located to the north within White Sands Missile Range. The depth of gypsum sand across the entire field is about below the interdunal surface, while the tallest dunes are about high. About 4.5 billion short tons (4.1 billion metric tons) of gypsum sand fill the dunefield, which formed about 7,000–10,000 years ago.

Total park acreage is which includes a net added in 2019 when the national park designation modified the boundaries between the park and the missile range. The missile range borders the park on all sides, with a cooperative use area designated in the park&#x27;s western portion where public access is only allowed by permit. The cooperative use area includes most of the Alkali Flat region in the park&#x27;s northwestern quadrant, as well as Lake Lucero and dome dunes in the southwestern quadrant. The San Andres Mountains rise beyond the park&#x27;s western boundary, while Holloman Air Force Base is a short distance to the east. A rock formation called the Twin Buttes is located to the south on land administered by the Bureau of Land Management.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, White Sands National Park has a continental or cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;), bordering closely on a cold desert climate (&quot;BWk&quot;). Daily means resemble those of a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), though its relatively high elevation and low precipitation causes a higher diurnal temperature variation and shorter growing season than would be typical of such a climate. The growing season generally lasts less than six months, from April 27 to October 19 on average.

The warmest months are April through October when the average high temperature reaches or exceeds and the daily mean temperature is in the range . Afternoon temperatures in June and July average around . The highest recorded temperature is , set on June 22, 1981. The cooler months are November through March when the average low temperature is below and the daily mean temperature is in the range , with December and January being the coldest months. The lowest recorded temperature is , set on January 11, 1962.

The average annual precipitation is , with the wettest month being August at . July through October have the most rainy days, averaging four to seven days per month. The remaining months have an average of two or three days with precipitation. Snow may occur from November through March, with an average accumulation of .

==Geology==

During the Permian Period, shallow seas covered the area that today forms White Sands National Park. The seas left behind gypsum (calcium sulfate), and subsequent tectonic activity lifted areas of the gypsum-rich seabed to form part of the San Andres and Sacramento Mountains. Over time, rain dissolved the water-soluble gypsum in the mountains, and rivers carried it to the Tularosa Basin, which has no outlet to the sea. The trapped water sank into the ground or formed shallow pools that subsequently dried out, leaving the gypsum on the surface in a crystalline form called selenite. Groundwater that flows out of the Tularosa Basin flows south into the Hueco Basin. 
During the last ice age, a body of water named Lake Otero covered much of the basin. When it dried out, a large flat area of selenite crystals remained, which is named the Alkali Flat.

Lake Lucero is a dry lakebed in the southwest corner of the park, at one of the lowest points in the basin. Rain and snowmelt from the surrounding mountains and upwelling from deep groundwater within the basin periodically fill Lake Lucero with water containing dissolved gypsum. When filled, the lake covers about at a depth of . As the water evaporates, small selenite crystals about in diameter form on the surface of the lake. Most of the crystal formation occurs when large floods concentrate the mineralized water every ten to fourteen years. Wind and water break down the crystals into progressively smaller particles until they are fine grains of white gypsum sand.
The ground in the Alkali Flat and along Lake Lucero&#x27;s shore is also covered with selenite crystals that measure up to long. Weathering and erosion eventually break the crystals into sand-size grains that are carried away by the prevailing winds from the southwest, forming the white dunes. The dunes constantly change shape and slowly move downwind. Since gypsum is water-soluble, the sand that composes the dunes may dissolve and cement together after rain, forming a layer of sand that is more solid, which increases the wind resistance of the dunes.
The increased resistance does not prevent dunes from quickly covering the plants in their path. Some species of plants can grow fast enough to avoid being buried by the dunes, while others utilize survival strategies such as the formation of a hardened pedestal around their roots to stabilize the plant amid the moving dunes.
White Sands contains various forms of dunes. Dome dunes are found along the southwest margins of the field, transverse and barchan dunes in the center of the field, and parabolic dunes along the northern, southern, and northeastern margins. Scientists have surveyed a long strip of dunes with lasers; installed shallow water wells across the dunefield; looked at the chemistry and age of the water below the dunes; measured hundreds of thousands of individual sand grains from across the dunes; and used satellites to see temperature and moisture changes throughout the year.

Toward the western side of the dunefield, the dunes are more than tall, and they become progressively smaller toward the eastern edge, until they come to an abrupt stop at the eastern boundary. Throughout the dunes, water is only a few feet (a meter) from the surface and very salty, but toward the western edge of the dunefield, the water is older and even saltier. The depth to groundwater also decreases from below the surface on the eastern end to only on the western end of the dunefield. The dunes at the western end have very little vegetation and move very quickly, while the dunes on the eastern end move very slowly and are very vegetated. Toward the western edge, the sand grains become larger and have all different shapes, while at the eastern edge they are all very small and round. The dunefield is much cooler and wetter than the surrounding hot, dry desert soils based on satellites images. Scientists have discovered what appear to be old lakeshores beneath the dunes using laser scanning technology. At each of these old lakeshore terraces, the dune movement and type of dunes changes greatly.

==Ecology==
More than 600 invertebrates, 300 plants, 250 birds, 50 mammals, 30 reptiles, seven amphibians, and one fish species inhabit White Sands National Park. Animal species that have a white, or off-white, coloration include three mammals, three reptiles, one amphibian, and numerous insects. At least 45 species are endemic, living only in this park, with 40 of them being moth species, along with the Apache pocket mouse (&quot;Perognathus flavescens Apachii&quot;), White Sands woodrat (&quot;Neotoma micropus leucophaea&quot;), bleached earless lizard (&quot;Holbrookia maculata ruthveni&quot;), and two camel crickets.

===Flora===

The plants at White Sands National Park stabilize the leading edges of the dunes, providing both food and shelter for wildlife. Humans have made extensive use of the dunefield&#x27;s native plant life, using some for food and others to create cloth and medicine. Native Americans wove mats with the thicker blades of grass, and consumed some of the grass seeds.

The park&#x27;s flora must be tough to live in the nutrient-poor alkaline soil of the dunefield. Drought-tolerant plants are able to survive in temperatures that range from sub-freezing to over , depending on the season. Many of these plants also tolerate the high concentrations of salt, while thrive in these conditions.

The cane cholla and other cacti, as well as desert succulents like the soaptree yucca, are able to store water through the hot summers and dry winters, blooming in the spring. Desert grasses have developed a tolerance for the highly alkaline soil. Grass species like alkali sacaton and Indian rice grass provide food for many tiny animals, such as Apache pocket mice and kangaroo rats. Grass seeds produce a protein-rich kernel that dries well and fills many rodents&#x27; underground granaries.

Native Americans used many parts of the soaptree yucca. The young flower stalks are rich in vitamin C, while the flower pods can be boiled or roasted. The leaf fibers were used for the fabrication of rope, matting, sandals, baskets, and coarse cloth. The roots were chopped and boiled to produce soap to wash hair, blankets, and rugs.

Other plants include skunkbush sumac, Rio Grande cottonwood (&quot;Populus deltoides wislizeni&quot;), hoary rosemary mint, purple sand verbena (&quot;Abronia angustifolia&quot;), Mormon tea (also known as longleaf jointfir), and claret cup cactus whose fruit is among the sweetest of any
desert plant. American Indians used the hoary rosemary mint for seasoning foods, and the purple sand verbena as a mild sedative. They used the skunkbush sumac&#x27;s berries to make a tart drink, while the flexible stems were used for basketry and binding. The sumac&#x27;s branches contain tannin, which is useful in producing dyes, and its leaves were used as an astringent to treat stings, bites, rashes, and sunburn. The cholla&#x27;s fruit can be eaten raw or cooked, while its flower buds were used as a diuretic, and a hair tonic was made from its roots. Strips of the cottonwood&#x27;s branches and bark were woven into baskets. The tree&#x27;s buds and flowers are edible, and its bark was used for treating bruises, strains, and sprains. A tea made from cottonwood bark is an anti-inflammatory agent and mild diuretic. The Mormon tea plant contains traces of ephedrine, which is a stimulant and decongestant effective in countering symptoms of the common cold.

===Fauna===

More than 800 animal species inhabit the park, many of them nocturnal. Several species of animals have developed very specialized means of survival in this harsh environment, enabling them to thrive in a place with very little surface water and highly mineralized groundwater. Some species that inhabit the dunes have gradually changed color through centuries of evolution, becoming substantially lighter than their cousins elsewhere. Many of these white species are endemic to the park. The Apache pocket mouse, bleached earless lizard, sand-treader camel cricket, sand wolf spider, and moth species including &quot;Protogygia whitesandsensis&quot; and &quot;Givira delindae&quot; are among the white animals inhabiting the dunefield. Lighter colored animals blend in with their white surroundings better than darker animals, which helps them to avoid predation, allowing them more time to reproduce.

Invertebrates form the largest group with more than 600 species, including varied species of spiders, wasps, beetles and moths. Spider species include Apache jumping spider, burrowing wolf spider, funnel-web spider (&quot;Agelenopsis longistylus&quot;), tarantula, and western black widow spider. Other arachnid species include sand scorpion (&quot;Paruroctonus utahensis&quot;), and wind scorpion. Insect species include white-lined sphinx moth, yucca moth, bleached skimmer dragonfly, tarantula hawk wasp, minor ground mantis, toothpick grasshopper, walking stick, Maricopa harvester ant, and darkling beetle. The Maricopa harvester ant inhabits much of the Southwestern United States and is believed to have the most toxic insect venom in the world. Humans may experience up to four hours of intense pain, while the equivalent of twelve ant stings is capable of killing a rat.

, 246 species of birds have been recorded, including wrens, mockingbirds, and ravens, as well as larger species like roadrunners and raptors. Fourteen species are listed as &quot;common&quot; meaning they may be seen daily but not in large numbers, while the others are seen only a few times each month, each year, or every few years. The most commonly seen species are: mourning dove, turkey vulture, Swainson&#x27;s hawk, red-tailed hawk, ash-throated flycatcher, Chihuahuan raven, common raven, northern mockingbird, house finch, Brewer&#x27;s sparrow, black-throated sparrow, white-crowned sparrow, and great-tailed grackle. Cactus wrens have a long white streak over their eyes, a cluster of black spots on their breast, and make a somewhat ratchety call. They build their nests in cacti and feed by hopping under shrubs hunting insects, or picking insects off the radiator grills of parked cars. Birds are usually observed in vegetated areas of the park away from the heart of the dunefield, mainly near the visitor center and the edges of the dunefield, as well as Lake Lucero though it is open to the public only once each month by guided tour.
Most mammals of the Tularosa Basin have adapted to the hot summers by staying in their dens until evening. Visitors may see footprints along the dunes as evidence of the nightly hunting and foraging excursions of nocturnal animals. Carnivorans include coyotes, bobcats, badgers, and kit foxes. Rabbits include desert cottontails and black-tailed jackrabbits, with the jackrabbit capable of speeds as high as . Rodents include porcupines, pocket gophers, Apache pocket mice, and Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rats, the latter of which can jump up to high when frightened despite having only a body and an tail. The pallid bat eats insects in the air like other bats but locates most of its food on the ground while walking around. Four other bat species have also been observed in the park, though the pallid bat is the most commonly seen species, roosting under the visitor center&#x27;s eaves during the summer.

Among reptiles, the most common lizards include the bleached earless lizard, little white whiptail (&quot;Aspidoscelis gypsi&quot; – a white species that will detach its tail as an escape strategy), southwestern fence lizard, and side-blotched lizard; while the most common snakes are the coachwhip, Sonoran gopher snake, prairie rattlesnake, western diamondback rattlesnake, and the massasauga which is another species of rattlesnake, all of them venomous. The sole resident turtle species is the desert box turtle.

Seven species of amphibians inhabit the park, including three species of toads: the Great Plains toad, the western toad, and the red-spotted toad; three species of spadefoot toads: Couch&#x27;s spadefoot toad, the plains spadefoot toad, and the New Mexico spadefoot toad, all of which have a single hard, dark spade on the underside of each hind foot that is used to burrow into the ground to prevent water loss and hide from predators; and one salamander species, the barred tiger salamander.

The White Sands pupfish is the only species of fish endemic to the Tularosa Basin, and the only fish found in the park. The pupfish has dark eyes, silver scales, and grows from in length.

==Paleontology==

Before the Pleistocene epoch ended about 12,000 years ago, the land within the Tularosa Basin featured large lakes, streams, and grasslands. The climate was wetter and cooler, producing a lot more rain and snow than in the present. Lake Otero was one of the largest lakes in the southwest, covering , which is an area larger than the state of Rhode Island.

The basin teemed with life, including large ice age mammals that lived by the shores of Lake Otero and in the surrounding grasslands. Columbian mammoths, ground sloths, ancient camels, dire wolves, lions, and saber-toothed cats—also known as saber-toothed tigers, though not closely related to tigers—all crossed the Tularosa Basin where the dunes lie presently. The animals left fossil footprints as they walked the muddy shores of Lake Otero, their body weight compressing the wet clay and gypsum. The fragile tracks are uncovered by the wind, then rapidly erode away, with many tracks disappearing after only two years.

Scattered along the now dried lakebed are trackways of ancient camels and Columbian mammoths. The fossilized footprints appear to gather around ancient pools of water. For 80 years, only a small collection of fossil footprints had been found in the park; however, a group of scientists noticed dark spots dotting the expanse of the lakebed that appeared to be footprints. During the 2010s, footprints of a dire wolf were discovered beside ancient seeds dated to more than 18,000 years ago. The fossil footprints of ground sloths have also been found in the park. Paleolithic human footprints are sometimes found interacting with Ice Age animals. One set of footprints shows the stalking of sloths. The paleo-humans who lived in the Tularosa Basin left behind no other evidence of their passage. Though stone flakes from toolmaking, arrowheads, and spear points are found in surrounding areas, they are the artifacts of humans who lived after the Ice Age. The lakebed is nearly devoid of a single artifact from before the Spanish exploration in the 1500s. In a study of exposed outcrops of Lake Otero in 2021, Bennett et al. reveal numerous human footprints dating to about 23,000 to 21,000 years ago which provide strong evidence of pre-Clovis occupation of the American continents.

===Carnivores===

Dire wolves lived in North and South America during the Pleistocene. Standing at about 2.6–2.8 feet (80–85 cm) tall and weighing 130–150 pounds (60–68 kg), they were about the same size as modern gray wolves, but with a heavier, more muscular build. They had powerful jaws, with a stronger bite than modern wolves, and probably hunted in packs, allowing them to target larger prey such as horses and bison.

During the Pleistocene, large cats lived throughout the world, including lions in North America. About four feet (1.2 m) tall at the shoulder and weighing over 500 pounds (230 kg), American lions had long, slender legs for chasing down prey. They hunted by ambushing animals like deer, camels, ground sloths, bison, and young mammoths.

Saber-toothed cats are known for their oversized canine teeth, which could reach seven to ten inches (17–20 cm) in length. Standing around 3 feet (one meter) tall and weighing up to 750 pounds (340 kg), saber-toothed cats had a bulky, muscular build that allowed them to subdue large prey, like sloths, bison, and young mammoths. Some fossil evidence suggests that they may have hunted in packs.

===Herbivores===

Columbian mammoths stood up to 14 feet (over four meters) tall at the shoulder and weighed 18,000–22,000 pounds (8,000–10,000 kilograms). They had large tusks and ridged teeth for eating plants like modern elephants. These giant herbivores probably did not have much hair, unlike the woolly mammoths that evolved in colder regions. Columbian mammoths inhabited a range from Canada to Nicaragua and Honduras.

Camels are commonly associated with Africa, though they originated in North America. The ancient western camel probably resembled modern, one-humped dromedary camels, but with longer legs, standing up to seven feet (over two meters) tall at the shoulder. The camels were opportunistic herbivores, grazing over large ranges, and leaving distinctive footprints.

Ground sloths are the ancient relatives of modern tree sloths, armadillos, and anteaters. The Harlan&#x27;s ground sloth dwarfed modern relatives, standing 10 feet (three meters) tall when upright and weighing over a ton (about 2,200–2,400 pounds or 1000–1090 kilograms). These giant herbivores had a slow, waddling walk and left kidney-bean shaped footprints, created as their back feet rotated inwards while walking. Some ground sloth prints appear bipedal, possibly caused by the large hind feet covering the tracks of the smaller front feet. Such tracks have sometimes been mistaken for the tracks of a giant human.

==Visitation==

White Sands National Park is the most visited NPS site in New Mexico, with about 600,000 visitors each year. In year two of the pandemic, White Sands National Park saw more than 780,000 visitors from both locals and visitors. Many visitors arrive during the warmer months from March through August, but sledders and photographers can be seen throughout the dunes year round. March and July are the two busiest months with more than 60,000 visitors each, or about 2,000 per day, while November through February have the fewest visitors with less than 30,000 each month, or fewer than 1,000 per day.

The Dunes Drive leads into the dunes from the visitor center at the park entrance. Three picnic areas are available, as well as a backcountry campground with ten sites for overnight camping in the dunefield. Five marked trails totaling allow visitors to explore the dunes on foot. Ranger-guided orientation and nature walks occur at various times and months throughout the year. Sunset strolls are presented every evening of the year, while Lake Lucero hikes are offered once a month, from November to April, and full moon guided hikes from April to October, on the night before the full moon. The park participates in the Junior Ranger Program, with various age-group-specific activities.

Both the park and U.S. Route 70 between Las Cruces and Alamogordo are subject to closure for safety reasons when tests are conducted at White Sands Missile Range which completely surrounds the park. Dunes Drive may be closed for periods of up to three hours during missile tests. Park staff is usually notified two weeks in advance of scheduled tests; however, notifications from White Sands Missile Range may be received as little as 24 hours in advance of a test. All activity, including horseback riding, backcountry camping, hiking, sledding, and driving on Dunes Drive is prohibited during all missile tests that require road closure. According to a National Park Service report, in 2020, visitors spent roughly $22.5 million in nearby communities with more than 360,000 more guests in 2021, nearby towns felt the boost.

<text>Hiddensee () is a car-free island in the Baltic Sea, located west of Germany&#x27;s largest island, Rügen, on the German coast.

The island has about 1,000 inhabitants. It was a holiday destination for East German tourists during German Democratic Republic (GDR) times, and continues to attract tourists today. It is the location of the University of Greifswald&#x27;s ornithological station. Gerhart Hauptmann and Walter Felsenstein are buried there.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Hedinsey&quot; surfaces as early as the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; written by Saxo Grammaticus and means &quot;Island of Hedin&quot;. The legendary Norwegian king, Hedin, was supposed to have fought here for a woman or even just for gold. Under Danish rule the name &quot;Hedins-Oe&quot; (&quot;Hedin&#x27;s Island&quot;) was common. Even in 1880 the island was shown in German maps as &quot;Hiddensjö&quot; and, in 1929, in German holiday guides as &quot;Hiddensöe&quot;. Its full Germanization to &quot;Hiddensee&quot; is thus relatively recent.

== Geography ==

Hiddensee is about long, about wide at its narrowest point and about wide at its broadest point. It is the largest island within the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park and belongs to the district of Vorpommern-Rügen in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. It lies west of the island of Rügen and is divided into an undulating, over northern part (&quot;Dornbusch&quot;, whose highest point is the Bakenberg at ), a dune and heath landscape in the central area (Dünenheide) and a flat, only few-metres-high southern part, the &quot;Gellen&quot;. In the northeast are the two spits of &quot;Alter Bessin&quot; and &quot;Neuer Bessin&quot;. The island is bounded by the &quot;Schaproder Bodden&quot; and &quot;Vitter Bodden&quot; to the east, the Gellenstrom (the shipping channel to Stralsund) to the south and the open Baltic Sea to the west and north.

=== Settlements ===
The following settlements are located on the island: Kloster, Vitte, Neuendorf, Grieben.

==== Grieben ====
Grieben is the northernmost place on the island. Its name is derived from the Slavic word for mushroom. Grieben was one of the two settlements on the island that existed in Slavic times before the arrival of the German monks in the 13th century. In the 14th century, eight cottages are documented for Grieben. The number of houses has hardly changed since then.

==== Kloster ====
The village was established around Kloster Hiddensee, founded at the end of the 13th century. At the end of the 19th century, there was only a church, a manor house, a rectory and schoolhouse, and two workers&#x27; houses. Only then did the village gradually grow to its present size. A number of artists, writers or even scientists settled in the village or on its outskirts; Kloster has become known as the place of residence of Gerhart Hauptmann, who was buried in the island cemetery there.
==== Vitte ====
Vitte was first mentioned in a document in 1513. The name comes from Low German and means settlement of herring fishermen. Vitte soon developed into the largest town on the island due to its central location on the narrow island.

==== Glambeck (deserted village) ====
Along with Grieben, Glambeck was one of the two settlements existing on the island in Slavic times, the name means deep place. Already before 1700 the place became deserted. In the 21st century a field name one kilometer north of Neuendorf reminds of the former place.

==== Neuendorf ====
The village was established around 1700, probably as a replacement for the abandoned village of Glambeck. Here the character of the old fishing village has been preserved the most on the island. Its development structure with houses on a common meadow area without constructed paths is considered unique, the village as a whole is under monument protection.

==== Plogshagen ====
Plogshagen is a foundation from times of colonization by German settlers after the foundation of the monastery. The name is said to be derived from the personal name Plog. Today Plogshagen has largely grown together with Neuendorf.

== Geology ==
=== Overview ===

The island of Hiddensee is, from a geological perspective, a very young landscape and was formed during the last ice age about 12,000 years ago. The ice age left behind here a Young Drift landscape. As a result of thawing inland ice, the underlying land rose and the hollows filled with water; the predecessor of what became the Baltic Sea, Ancylus Lake emerged. As a result, only protruding ridges like the &quot;Dornbusch&quot; remained visible, as islands. The overall shape of the coast in the southern area of the Baltic Sea was formed during the Littorina Transgression about 7,000 to 2,500 years ago. Around 5,000 years ago, the sea level attained its present level and the Dornbusch and two older island cores became islands. 4,500 years ago the salt water currents from the North Sea were sharply reduced. The Baltic has slowly become less salty since. As a result of coastal erosion (land denudation, drift and deposition) the islands changed to their present shapes over the course of time. For example, the former three island cores were joined to one another by accretion. This process still carried sand away from the north of the Dornbusch. In 2000, of till twice broke off from the northern tip of the Hiddensee in the area of the &quot;Toter Kerl&quot; and collapsed into the sea. On average the cliff edges of the &quot;Dornbusch&quot; recede about per year. In mid-March 2004 another collapsed into the sea. Geologically seen the Hiddensee is a region undergoing constant change. The landmasses carried away from its northern tip are washed up again at the southern end and on the east side of the Schaproder Bodden. This has caused the formation of two geologically recent spits at the southern end of the&quot; Gellen&quot;: the &quot;Alter Bessin&quot; und &quot;Neuer Bessin&quot;. The &quot;Alter Bessin&quot; began to appear about 300 to 400 years ago and was already over long by the middle of the 19th century. Since then it has barely grown. On the other hand, the &quot;Neuer Bessin&quot; which appeared in 1900 is growing by annually and is already long. Meanwhile, a third &quot;Bessin&quot; is emerging. Even the southern tip is growing as a so-called windwatt into the Schaproder Bodden.

=== Hills, ravines and other natural forms ===
From the highlands in the north to the lowlands in the south, there are the following mountains, gorges and shapes (altitude above sea level in parentheses, rounded):
== Climate ==

Hiddensee is dominated macro-climatically by the Baltic Sea coastal climate with frequent alternation between maritime and continental influences (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dobk&quot;). Characteristically it has frequent, brisk and changeable winds and long periods of sunshine. This averages 1,850 hours per year. As a result, Hiddensee is one of the sunniest places in Germany. One special feature is so-called transperiod wind circulation, when there are weak, offshore wind conditions, and which is caused by the different temperatures over the sea and land. This produces a sea breeze in late morning that abates in the afternoon or evening.

The longstanding annual average temperature on the island is . The average wind speed in Kloster is . In comparison to the nearby island of Rügen, the average annual precipitation on Hiddensee is markedly less at .

In 2008, Hiddensee-Dornbusch was the sunniest place in Germany, as reported by the weather service, Meteomedia, with 2,168 hours of sunshine. The data was gathered by Meteomedia&#x27;s own weather station (; ).

The Hiddensee weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Its highest temperature was on 10 July 2010.
* Its lowest temperature was on 17 February 1940.
* Its greatest annual precipitation was in 1960.
* Its least annual precipitation was in 1971.
* The longest annual sunshine was 1952.2 hours in 1975.
* The shortest annual sunshine was 1478.3 hours in 1978.

=== Storm flood ===
Again and again Hiddensee was hit by storm flood. For example, the island is said to have been separated from the island of Rügen by the All Saints&#x27; Flood in 1304, but this has not been proven with certainty. In 1864 and 1865 Hiddensee was breached three times by storm floods between Hohen Dünschen Garn and Peterbergschen Garn, a very shallow and thin area. The 1872 Baltic Sea flood flooded the island again near Plogshagen. There is still a threat of the island being divided into a southern and a northern part, which could only be prevented by extensive coastal protection measures so far.

== Flora and fauna ==
Hiddensee is the largest island in the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park and blends an old cultural landscape with the wood pastures of the original dune heathland. The large accumulations of new land in the northeast (Alter and Neuer Bessin) and south (at the Gellen) of Hiddensee offer habitats for numerous invertebrates, such as worms and mussels. These in turn provide nourishment for many migrating birds. For example, the area around the island is one of the most important crane roosting areas in Germany. The southern tip of the island is, like the &quot;Neuer Bessin&quot; was therefore classified as conservation zone I of the national park und is out-of-bounds. On the island are two nature reserves, the between Neuendorf and Vitte and the in the north.

The &quot;Naturschutzgesellschaft Hiddensee und Boddenlandschaft&quot; maintains a national park house in Vitte, with a permanent exhibition of fauna and flora.

In 1936 the was established on the island.

== Population development ==
The population of Hiddensee has shrunk in recent years. While an estimated 1,261 people lived on Hiddensee in 1990, an estimate in 2001 put the number at only 1,173, and in 2011 the census revealed only 995 inhabitants. Since then, the exodus seems to have stopped; the 2021 estimate resulted in 994 inhabitants. More women (52.1%) than men live on the island. Of the 994 inhabitants, 124 are under the age of eighteen.

== Subdivisions ==
The municipality of Insel Hiddensee (&quot;Island of Hiddensee&quot;) has four subdivisions (from north to south):

=== Grieben ===
Grieben is the oldest, northernmost and smallest village on Hiddensee and lies on the eastern edge of the uplands of the island. Its name comes from the Slavic &quot;grib&quot; (for &quot;mushroom&quot;). Grieben has no harbour of its own.

=== Kloster ===

The parish of Kloster gets its name from the former Cistercian abbey, which stood from 1296 to 1536 in the vicinity of the present harbour in Kloster. It was dissolved with the Reformation. Today Kloster with its Gerhart Hauptmann Haus, the island church and island cemetery with the graves of Gerhart Hauptmann, Walter Felsenstein and Gret Palucca is the cultural centre of Hiddensee. It lies on the edge of the uplands (&quot;Hochland&quot;), whose highest point is the Dornbusch. In Kloster are the Hiddensee Biological Station and the Hiddensee Bird Observatory, both branches of the University of Greifswald, which were both formed out of the Hiddensee Biological Research Institute, founded in 1930.

=== Vitte ===

Vitte (pronounced: &quot;Fitte&quot;), first mentioned in 1513, is the main settlement and the largest and most central village on the island. The name is a derivation of &quot;vit&quot;; a word that was used to refer to places where fish was sold. In Vitte is the parish hall and council administration. In addition there is the ferry landing stage for the goods ferry that brings delivery and waste disposal vehicles from Schaprode on the island of Rügen. Goods are transferred to trailers that are pulled by electric tractors and distributed to the food markets and restaurants on the island. Sometimes smaller goods are still delivered by horse and cart. The heath landscape on Hiddensee, between Vitte and Neuendorf, is also part of Vitte. In Vitte is the oldest surviving house on the island, the Witch&#x27;s House (), the old summer house for Adolf Reichwein. In addition there is the last tented cinema and the puppet theatre .

=== Neuendorf ===

Neuendorf is the southernmost settlement on Hiddensee. The inhabitants of Neuendorf are known by the rest of the island as the Southerners (). Although Neuendorf is only from Vitte, its inhabitants speak a different dialect. Large parts of Neuendorf resemble a large pasture on which the houses are arranged like a piece of string. There are no paths in places, so that some addresses may only be reached by walking over the grass. Neuendorf has its own harbour.

Neuendorf consists of two originally independent villages: the older one, &quot;Plogshagen&quot;, existed as early as the 13th century and the actual Neuendorf, which was formed in 1700 by relocation of people from &quot;Glambek&quot;. Ruins of these settlements are still recognisable today northeast of Neuendorf parish.

South of Neuendorf lies the so-called Gellen, an important bird reserve that belongs to conservation zone I of the West Pomeranian Lagoon Area National Park and is thus out-of-bounds to the public.

== History ==

=== Stone Age to the end of the 17th century ===
The first settlements on the island took place in the middle and younger Stone Age. After a large part of the Germanic population had left the southern Baltic region in the 6th century AD, the Rani (Slavs) took possession of the island. The Hiddensee treasure, as well as the name of the islet, testify that the area was then in the sphere of influence of the Vikings in the 9th/10th century. In 1168 the Rans were defeated by King Waldemar I of Denmark by conquering the fortress Jaromarsburg at Cape Arkona on Rügen, Christianized and brought under Danish feudal dependence. Hiddensee was thus under Danish sovereignty. On 13 April 1296 the prince of Rügen, Wizlaw II, donated the island of Hiddensee, &quot;as it was surrounded by the salt sea&quot;, to the Neuenkamp Abbey. There, a Cistercian abbey named Nikolaikamp was founded, named after St. Nicholas as the patron saint of sailors. In fact, the monastery was called Kloster Hiddensee for the entire time of its existence.

In the fall of 2008, archaeologists excavating under the direction of medieval archaeologist Felix Biermann discovered ten burials on the grounds of the former Cistercian monastery. Nine graves were found north of the monastery church and one in the cloister east of the west wing of the enclosure. Bettina Jungklaus anthropologically examined the skeletons of seven male and two female adults and one young girl. One 20- to 30-year-old male exhibited a healed slash wound to the right frontal bone. There was a joint burial of a 50-60-year-old man with a 14-15-year-old girl, where the man held the youth&#x27;s left arm with his right hand. The disease burden was strikingly low. Tartar and periodontal disease were found most frequently. Caries was found on only one set of teeth, which was unusually low for medieval populations.

Simultaneously with the construction of the monastery, the Gellenkirche, a small beacon called Luchte, and the first harbor were built on the Gellen in the south of the island in the years 1302 to 1306. The foundations of these structures are located (today) west of the Gellen in the Baltic Sea.

In 1332, the consecration of the Island Church, intended for the farmers and fishermen of the island, took place in today&#x27;s Kloster district outside the monastery walls. With the transfer of the baptismal font from the Gellenkirche to the new church, pastoral duties have been carried out from there ever since. The barrel vault, built in around 1781, received a painting with rose decoration by the Berlin painter Nikolaus Niemeier in 1922.

In the course of the Reformation, the monastery was dissolved in 1536. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War from 1618 to 1648, soldiers burned down the mixed oak forest on the Dornbusch on Wallenstein&#x27;s orders in 1628, thus depriving the Danes of the opportunity to extract timber. Even in the 21st century, the ash layer from that time can still be seen on the roadsides near the lighthouse a few centimeters below the turf. In the years from 1648 to 1815, Hiddensee, like the whole of Western Pomerania, was under Swedish administration.

From 1754 to 1780, Joachim Ulrich Giese was the owner of the island and began mining clay for the &quot;Stralsunder Fayencenmanufaktur&quot; he founded.

=== 19th century to the end of the Second World War ===

From 1800 to 1836 the island belonged to captain and Knight Wilhelm Friedrich Ludwig von Bagewitz (1777–1835) on Ralow. He increased the levies, drove the people of Hiddensee to 104 days of forced labor annually on his estates and prevented a school for the children. Under him, the free peasants in Grieben became serfs. Even when King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden abolished serfdom in 1806, nothing changed on Hiddensee.

From 1815, Hiddensee and Vorpommern belonged to Prussia until the end of World War II and was assigned to the district of Rügen (until 1939, the district of Rügen). In 1836, Stralsund&#x27;s Holy Spirit Monastery acquired the island, and the first schools on the island were built in Plogshagen and Kloster in 1837 and 1840, respectively. In the years between 1854 and 1864, a reorganization of the land relations also took place on Hiddensee in the context of the redemption of the real burdens (liberation of farmers).

Until 1861, Hiddensee was virtually treeless for decades, except for the barren willow avenue between the monastery and Grieben and a few pines planted there around 1770, as well as a few trees at Schwedenhagen and Rübenberg. The dense oak tree population on Hiddensee, which still existed in the 13th century, had been almost completely decimated for firewood, house and ship building by the beginning of the 17th century. That the slash-and-burn in 1628 by Wallenstein would have destroyed the forest, as the legend would have it, is unlikely, because already on the map of Rügen by Eilhard Lubin from 1602 no tree symbol is drawn on Hiddensee anymore and the thorn bush is shown as bare hilly land. First in 1861 the Dornbusch between Bakenberg and Hucke was planted with pines, around 1900 also the Dornbusch north of Bakenberg, the coastal section from Hucke to the museum of local history as well as from there along the coast to Gellen (Karkensee). The section of coast in front of Vitte was excluded from this, because the Vitter rejected the government&#x27;s offered reforestation for the reason that access to the beach for tourists would then be impeded.

In 1864 and 1872, the island was hit by severe storm floods. During the first flood, Hiddensee broke in two due to a complete flooding at the narrowest point of the island, south of Neuendorf, which could only be reversed by extensive reconstruction measures six years later. After the second storm flood, the Hiddensee treasure, a Viking work from the 10th century, is said to have been found. A replica of it can be seen in the Hiddensee Museum of Local History, the original is on display in the Stralsund Museum.

In 1874, the district of Hiddensee was formed in the German Empire. In 1875, the painter Gustav Schönleber &quot;discovered&quot; Hiddensee, which was difficult to access. In 1888 the lighthouse on the Dornbusch, the harbor and the sea rescue station were completed in Kloster. In 1887 the bulwark in Kloster was built, and in 1905 and 1907 the steamer landing bridges in Vitte and Neuendorf. From this time on, larger ships could dock directly on Hiddensee and the adventurous mooring or disembarking at the level of the ferry island was no longer necessary. From 1892 onwards, steamships operated regularly between Stralsund and Kloster for the first time. From 1905, with the founding of the medical association, the first doctor on Hiddensee received his license.

With the almost simultaneous construction of five large hotels in Kloster (&quot;Haus Hitthim&quot; in 1909, &quot;Zum Klausner&quot; in 1911, &quot;Wieseneck and Haus am Meer&quot; - the later Vogelwarte - both in 1913, and in the same year the Dornbusch, which had been expanded from an inn to a hotel), the number of tourists increased by leaps and bounds and Kloster became the island&#x27;s main tourist resort.

With the founding of the Hiddensee Nature Conservation Association, the Fährinsel was declared a nature reserve in 1910 and Gellen and Gänsewerder in 1922 by the Prussian government. The status of a nature reserve was given to the Dornbusch, the Schwedenhagener Ufer and the Altbessin in 1937.

From 1916 to 1921, the photographer Elfriede Reichelt visited the island several times. Between 1922 and 1925, Max Taut built a house on Hiddensee every year. The most famous is the &quot;Karusel&quot; in Vitte, built in 1922, which the silent film actress Asta Nielsen bought as a residence in 1928 and for which Bruno Taut had designed the color concept of the house. Just near Karusel is another house by Max Taut, &quot;Haus Weidermann&quot;, built in 1923 for the Berlin merchant Karl Weidermann. In Kloster stand the &quot;Haus Pingel&quot;, built for the interior designer Walter Pingel in 1924 (significantly altered structurally in the 1960s), and right next to it the house built in 1925 for the Berlin publisher Max Gehlen, which has been on the grounds of the Biological Station of Hiddensee since 1930 and is used as a doctoral student house.

In 1927, a police regulation was issued prohibiting the use of motor vehicles on the island. Only the island doctor and the local police were allowed to use a motorcycle. In the same year the island was connected to the electricity grid and three years later the Biological Research Station was founded by Erich Leick from the University of Greifswald, which together with an ornithological station became the Biological Research Institute of Hiddensee in 1936.

In 1937, work began on the large stone embankment with stone groynes in front of the Hucke. It was planned to protect the entire approximately four-kilometer-long break-off bank of the Dornbusch with a rampart. In addition to protecting the island, the intention was to limit sand drift in order to save the costs of constant dredging at the Gellen channel and in the Stralsund fairway. The outbreak of World War II put an end to the construction work, only four hundred meters were completed and remained so until today. After the construction of the Huckemauer, the beach at Kloster and Vitte deteriorated, suffering from a lack of sand.

Between 1937 and 1939, the three communities on the island merged to form the municipality of Hiddensee. Until before 1939, according to the last officially published &quot;Güter-Adressbuch Pommern&quot;, the family of Paul Wüstenberg was the tenant of the 239 ha &quot;Stadtgutes Kloster Hiddensee&quot;. According to genealogical sources of the Deutsches Geschlechterbuch, his family withdrew from the estate already around 1937. He was succeeded by Rüdiger von Hagen, brother of Albrecht von Hagen, who later became a short-time curator of the University of Greifswald. The family of Paul Wüstenberg was the tenant of the 239 ha town estate.

At the end of the 1930s, bunkers and anti-aircraft weapons were built at Enddorn for air defense during World War II, as well as a jetty at Schwedenhagen for material transport. The bunkers were blown up by the Soviet Army in 1945 (the debris was not removed until the 2000s) and the jetty was developed by VEB Erdöl-Erdgas Grimmen for experimental oil drilling in the 1960s. The pier was subsequently used, from 1974, by a pusher for island supply and demolished in 2010.

=== 1945 until 1989 ===
On 4-5 May 1945 Soviet troops occupied the island. In the same year as in the following year, the Hiddensee estate was divided into 18 new farms as part of the land reform.

On 28 July 1946 Gerhart Hauptmann was buried in the cemetery in Kloster (Hiddensee Island). The memorial stone was unveiled exactly five years later, on 28 July 1951.

In 1952, the second ferry service between Seehof on Rügen and the ferry island had to be discontinued.

Between 1958 and 1959, the &quot;VEB Fahrzeug- und Jagdwaffenwerk &quot;Ernst Thälmann&quot;&quot; built a vacation village for its employees in Dünenheide. Right next to it, the &quot;Bau- und Montagekombinat Industrie- und Hafenbau Stralsund&quot; built another vacation village for its employees in 1980/81.

From 1952 to 1955, Hiddensee belonged administratively to the Bergen district. In 1953, during &quot;Aktion Rose&quot;, some hoteliers fled to the West, others were arrested. After this action, all hotels on the island were expropriated and handed over to the FDGB. In the fifties the local history museum and the Gerhart Hauptmann Haus opened; the LPG Dornbusch was founded.

In 1962, dike construction began between Kloster and Vitte. With the diking of the meadows and pastures along the Bodden coast, the largest transformation of Hiddensee began. In Vitte, the Bodden water previously went as far as the streets &quot;Wiesenweg&quot;, &quot;Norderende&quot; and &quot;Zum Seglerhafen&quot;. Large parts of today&#x27;s harbor of Vitte as well as the whole area with today&#x27;s sports field, the heliport and the sailing harbor Lange Ort were artificially washed up or drained. Also in Kloster parts of the Bodden were drained, which before the dike construction had still extended from the harbor to far behind &quot;Höhe Postweg&quot;.

The Weiße Flotte Stralsund took over the cooperative shipping company and the fishermen founded the FPG&#x27;n &quot;De Süder&quot; in Neuendorf and Swantevit in Vitte.

On 10 April 1967 petroleum exploration began as a result of seismic surveys in the north of the island of Hiddensee with the &quot;E Rügen 2/67&quot; research well. This 4,602 m deep well, as well as the wells &quot;E Hiddensee 3/67&quot;, &quot;4/68 and 5/68&quot; that followed until December 1968, did not yield any exploitable oil deposits. The 5th well, which had already been prepared, was cancelled, and all wells were plugged in the summer of 1971. The crude oil produced up to that point was shipped by tanker from a temporary port near Kloster to the Soviet Union for examination and processing.

Until 1971, the site of the &quot;5. Technische Beobachtungskompanie Dornbusch&quot; of the NVA was built between the pension Zum Klausner and the Dornbusch lighthouse. Behind a double fence, with dog run in between, there was an ammunition bunker and other buildings. The facility was dismantled in 1993 and the bunker was covered with earth. Since then, the former access road, the plate road from Kloster, which forks shortly before Klausner, leads to the right into &quot;nothingness&quot;.

In 1972/73, the connecting roads between the villages were paved with concrete slabs, except for a gap of about 500 m between Vitte and Kloster, which existed for many years due to an incipient shortage of building material, and which is still recognizable today as the only asphalted road section. In 1974, the domestic waste dumps on the outskirts of all localities were covered and a central waste dump was built for them near &quot;Swantiberges&quot;. This was exhausted in the early nineties. Since 1993, all garbage is collected in the port of Vitte and transported to Rügen.

On 7 May 1989, 4.7 percent of the votes cast in the GDR local elections on Hiddensee were against the government. Hiddensee was considered a niche for dissidents and dropouts, who often worked in hotels, restaurants or as lifeguards in the summer. On the small island, they were easy to control, and despite sometimes open Stasi surveillance, some incidents and meetings were accepted. An intellectual climate prevailed on Hiddensee, and artists, writers, actors, musicians and scientists retreated there, such as Jo Harbort, Christine Harbort, Günter Kunert, Kurt Böwe, Harry Kupfer, Inge Keller, Günther Fischer, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Christoph Hein, Robert Rompe or members of the punk band Feeling B.

The bodies of people who were shot during escape attempts across the Baltic Sea, mostly in a folding kayak, or who perished without outside interference, were also found again and again on the beaches of Hiddensee, such as those of 18-year-old Friedrich Klein and Ernst August Utpaddel (both in February 1962) and 21-year-old Uwe Richter (in August 1987). But Hiddensee was also the starting point for one of the most spectacular escapes from the GDR and the only one with a surfboard, in November 1986, by 30-year-old Karsten Klünder and 22-year-old Dirk Deckert one day later. In the early morning of each day, both of them sailed from Gellen to the Danish island of Møn, 70 kilometers away, in a good four hours with homemade surfboards and sails.

=== From 1989 ===
After the reunification, a new pier for the cargo ferry was completed in Vitte. Some sailors then used the old concrete pier of the push boat in Kloster as a sailing harbor. From the 2010s, a yachting harbor with sanitary facilities was created during the largest harbor renovation project in Kloster.

In 1992, the research facilities at the Schwedenhagen test site of Central Institute for Electron Physics in Berlin and the Ferry Island test site of Central Institute for Microbiology and Experimental Therapy in Jena were abandoned.

Hiddensee was also the site of the large-scale electric vehicle test launched in 1992 by the Federal Ministry of Research and the automotive industry. In the course of the test, a large solar system was installed on the roof of a building at the port of Vitte, which still exists today.

In May 2010, the tent cinema in Vitte had to be closed after 46 years. After a transitional period at changing locations, a new tent cinema opened at Vitte harbor in 2012, with Jörg Mehrwald as its director until 2020.

Between 2010 and 2014, some roads were repaved or paved at all and the local roads were widened by a good 50 percent (Vitte-Neuendorf 2010 and Kloster-Vitte 2014). In Vitte, a helipad went into operation in 2012 for emergency patients and for a disaster situation.

In October 2019, a new island bus with electric drive was put into operation. The predecessor ran on diesel and was thus still one of the few combustion vehicles on the island, after the police had also switched to an electric car in September 2015.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the island was closed to tourists for some time in 2020.

At the beginning of 2021, it became known that the municipality of Hiddensee would like to expand the harbor in Vitte. Plans include a 135-place yachting harbor, a multipurpose hall, a 5590-square-meter photovoltaic system, a seawater desalination plant in a twelve-meter tower, two piers, an expansion of the ferry dock for cruise ships, and several other buildings. A citizens&#x27; initiative has been formed against the expansion plans.

== Economy ==
The inhabitants of the island live mainly from tourism. The majority of visitors are day tourists. Annually, Hiddensee has about 50,000 overnight guests, compared to about 250,000 day visitors.

Even before 1990, Hiddensee was a popular vacation spot. In the 1970s, up to 4,000 vacationers and 3,000 day trippers were on the island every day during the peak season. By the mid-1980s, the number of day visitors had risen to nearly 250,000 annually. Due to the desired naturalness, the tourism sector was hardly developed further, and the number of visitors has hardly changed since then. Today, Hiddensee has just under 3,300 guest beds.

A considerable part of Hiddensee&#x27;s area is used for agricultural purposes.

== Education ==
School children have been taught on the island since 1788. In the beginning this was done by the sexton. The first school in Vitte was founded on 2 November 1887. After the restructuring in connection with the German reunification in 1990, the Vitte school became a secondary school. Currently, 69 students are taught from first to tenth grade (as of 2019).

== Transport == 

Private motor vehicle traffic is prohibited on the entire island, which has been regulated by law since 1927. Some exceptions exist, recently increasingly with electric drive. Horse-drawn carts are used for passenger transport and some goods traffic. Between the northern and southern parts of the municipality, an electric regular bus operated by &quot;Rügener Personennahverkehrs GmbH&quot; (RPNV) runs Monday through Friday. However, the most frequently used means of transportation is the bicycle.

Unlike pedelecs/e-bikes, e-scooters on Hiddensee require a special permit, which is rarely issued, like all vehicles powered by engine power.

The island can be reached via several ship connections both from Stralsund (seasonally limited) and from Schaprode on Rügen, operated by the Weiße Flotte &quot;Reederei Hiddensee&quot;. Here, the free transportation of severely disabled persons applies. In the summer season, there are further connections with Ralswiek, Breege, Wiek and Zingst. There are also water taxi connections with the mainland and the island of Rügen.

== Sights and museums ==
The &quot;biggest&quot; attraction on Hiddensee is the long sandy beach. It stretches practically the entire length of the island on the west side. Therefore, it has been known as a bathing resort since the late 19th century. Yet bathing attire (and also clothing etiquette in general) was very permissive even in the days of the Belle Époque. Ladies going barefoot and showing bare calves was possible everywhere on Hiddensee, where elsewhere it would have caused a scandal. In the interwar period, the island became a center of the &quot;Lebensreform&quot; and Naturism. In GDR times, due to complaints from indignant tourists, an attempt was made at times to ban skinny-dip, but this was hardly noticed. Today, there is no division into textile and nude beach sections on Hiddensee, and both are permitted and common throughout the beach.

=== Kloster ===
==== Dornbusch lighthouse ====

In the north of the island, on the Schluckswiek in the so-called highlands of Hiddensee, stands the landmark of the island, the Hiddensee Lighthouse. 102 steps lead up to the tower, which has been open to visitors since 1994. However, so that it doesn&#x27;t get too crowded up there, only 15 visitors can climb the tower at a time. From wind force 6, the tower remains closed for safety reasons.

==== Gerhart Hauptmann House ====

In the former country house Modler and later house Seedorn the writer Gerhart Hauptmann was a summer guest already in 1926. Four years later he bought it from the municipality and added an annex. From 1930 to 1943 he spent the summer months here with his wife. In 1956, it became the Gerhart Hauptmann Museum, which also hosts readings and concerts. The literature pavilion, built in 2012 in a strikingly modern form on the property, serves as the entrance and houses the ticket office, museum store (bookstore) and a permanent exhibition &quot;Literaturlandschaft Hiddensee.&quot;

==== Hiddensee Island Church ====
Hiddensee Island Church was built in 1332 in front of the monastery, of which nothing is preserved today (the so-called Klostertor was built only after the monastery was abandoned). For centuries it served as a parish church for the inhabitants of the island. In 1781 it was rebuilt in the Baroque style - the pulpit altar, confessional, baptismal angel and baptismal font date from this period. The painted barrel vault, the so-called Hiddenseer Rosenhimmel, however, is only from 1922. Today, the island church is the seat of the Protestant parish of Hiddensee.

==== Lietzenburg ====

The Lietzenburg is a listed Art Nouveau villa built by the painter Oskar Kruse in 1904/1905. It is a brick building with natural stone foundation on a hill near the Dornbusch. For many years it has served as a boarding house for artists.

==== Museum of local history Hiddensee ====
The museum of local history Hiddensee is a simple plaster building in Kloster. It offers a permanent exhibition on the island&#x27;s history with about 450 exhibits, a complete copy of Hiddensee treasure found on the island, files, about 2500 photographs, postcards and slides, and an extensive library. Some works by well-known representatives of the Hiddensee artists&#x27; colony are also in the museum&#x27;s collection. The building itself dates back to 1890 and was a sea rescue station.

==== Doktorandenhaus ====
Only a few steps away from the Gerhart Hauptmann Museum, at Biologenweg 5, stands the Doktorandenhaus, built in 1925 by Max Taut for the Berlin publishing director Max Gehlen. In 1930, the island administration bought the building as a summer house for the Biological Station of Hiddensee. Since about 1990, it has served as a seminar and accommodation building for the University of Greifswald.

==== Eggert Gustavs Museum ====
In the settlement area Am Bau, the Alte Schmiede was converted into a museum and opened in 2019. It honors the life and work of the artist Eggert Gustavs, who died in 1996 and was the son of the island&#x27;s long-time pastor Arnold Gustavs, and thus aims to make him known to wider circles.

=== Vitte ===

==== National Park House Hiddensee ====
The national park house was opened in 1998. The house in the north of Vitte is a thatched building with a trapezoidal ground plan. It contains a permanent exhibition about the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park with a focus on Hiddensee. The exhibition&#x27;s motto is &quot;Panta Rhei – Alles fließt&quot;.

==== Asta Nielsen House and surroundings ====

The round building, also called &quot;Karusel&quot; after the Danish word for carousel, was built in 1923 according to plans by Max Taut for the Müller family. In 1928, the daughter of silent film actress Asta Nielsen bought it and spent the summer months there with her mother and her husband until the 1930s. Frequent visitors were Joachim Ringelnatz with his wife, Heinrich George and Gerhart Hauptmann. In 1975, the local government listed the building under cultural heritage management; in 1989, the Nielsen heirs sold the house to the municipality. In 2015, a permanent exhibition about Asta Nielsen opened. The house was located directly on the Bodden until the 1960s (see History 1945 to 1989). Right next to the Asta Nielsen House is another building by Max Taut, built in 1924 for the commercial director Karl Weidermann.

The municipality uses the house for public events, but it was badly damaged in the meantime and had to be renovated. The Ministry of Agriculture of the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and the district of Western Pomerania provided around 500,000 euros for this purpose, and the municipality also had to make a small contribution. The renovation was completed in 2015, and since then wedding ceremonies can also be held in the balcony room. In addition, the house now serves as a museum and artists&#x27; residence, where, among other things, the cinematic work of the silent film actress and the life of Max Taut are shown in a permanent exhibition. Special exhibitions and seminars in adjoining rooms are added.
==== Blaue Scheune ====

In its original layout, the Blaue Scheune is a Low German half-timbered house from the beginning of the 19th century. Since the 1970s it has housed the gallery of the owner Günter Fink. He exhibited his paintings with island motifs here and also sold them.

==== Henni Lehman Haus ====
The Landhaus Lehmann was used as the summer residence of the Henni Lehmann family from 1907 to 1937. The building was designed by the Schwerin architect Paul Ehmig. After a reconstruction, the building served as the town hall of Vitte between 1938 and 1991. Since 5 June 2000 the house is officially called Henni Lehmann House and is used for events and exhibitions as well as the local library.

==== Hexenhaus ====
Built in 1755 as a fisherman&#x27;s cottage, it is considered the oldest house in Vitte. Since 1915 the painter Elisabeth Büttner lived in the house, from 1930 it was the summer residence of the Pallat family or the resistance fighter Adolf Reichwein, who was murdered in 1944, and is still owned by the family today. In 1981, the house in Süderende 105 was listed as a historical monument. A commemorative stumbling stone is located in front of the house. The building cannot be visited from the inside.

==== Humunkulus figure collection ====
The collection of figures and props in the matter-of-fact new building made of larch wood comes mainly from the neighboring puppet theater Seebühne by Karl Huck. On display, in addition to theater posters and brochures, are, for example, Doctor Faustus, Long John Silver, Ebenezer Scrooge, Hans Christian Andersen, Tolstoy, Kafka, Edgar Allan Poe, William Shakespeare, Goethe, Pinocchio, King Kong, Marilyn Monroe, Helena, and an extensive animal kingdom including a dronte chick.

=== Neuendorf ===
==== Gellen lighthouse ====
The 12.30 m high structure (height of fire 10 m), a sector and cross light, is located south of Neuendorf at the northern border of the Gellen. It has the lighthouse number C2586 and the coordinates ♁54° 30′ 29″ N, 13° 4′ 28″ E. The beacon bears the official designation &quot;Leuchtfeuer Gellen/Hiddensee&quot;. The white steel tower with red gallery and conical roof stands on a natural stone base. It was built in 1904 by the company Julius Pintsch (Berlin) from cast segments (tubbings) and has been in trial operation since 1905, in continuous operation since 1907. The Ranzow and Kolliker Ort lighthouses (on the island of Rügen) and the Norddorf lighthouse (on the island of Amrum) were built in the same way at the same production plant (Fürstenwalde/Spree branch). The lighthouse Gellen/Hiddensee marks the northern entrance to the Gellenstrom, in the west the fairway of the Gellenstrom and leads in the east through the Schaproder Bodden. The lighthouse was depicted on a 5-million-mark emergency banknote issued by the district of Rügen in 1923. In the GDR&#x27;s special stamp series &quot;Leucht-, Leit- und Molenfeuer&quot; from 1975, the Gellen beacon graced the 10 pfennig stamp as a motif.

==== Parish hall &quot;Uns Tauflucht&quot; ====
So that church services could also be celebrated in Neuendorf, the parish hall &quot;Uns Tauflucht&quot; (Our Refuge) was built at the end of the 20th century. In addition to ecumenical services, it is also used for community events such as lectures and concerts.

==== Fishery museum &quot;Lütt Partie&quot; ====

In 2006/2007, a brick-built former net and equipment shed from 1885 was converted into the &quot;Lütt Partie&quot; (Small Unit) Fishery Museum. The name is from times when it was still in its former purpose. At that time there was a large and a small net or equipment shed, one was popularly called &quot;Grod Partie&quot;, the smaller &quot;Lütt Partie&quot;. Since 2007, fishermen from the island have been presenting and explaining fishing equipment and telling stories about fishing history and everyday work in the past and present. The museum is run by the &quot;Fischereipartie Neuendorf e. V.&quot; association, which is financed solely by donations.

== &quot;Stolpersteine&quot; ==
Six &quot;Stolpersteine&quot; in Vitte commemorate Henni Lehmann and four other painters of Jewish origin as well as the pedagogue and politician Adolf Reichwein, who became victims of the National Socialist regime.

== Culture ==

The island of Hiddensee enjoyed the reputation of an artists&#x27; colony from the beginning of the 20th century. Artists of all kinds spent the summer months there and recorded their impressions in their work.

From 1904, the painter Elisabeth Büchsel spent the summer months in Neuendorf. In the same year, Oskar Kruse built his Lietzenburg in Kloster, which became an artists&#x27; meeting place. Later, his sister-in-law, the doll maker Käthe Kruse, also lived there. In the Blaue Scheune in Vitte, the summer residence of Henni Lehmann, the &quot;Hiddensoer Künstlerinnenbund&quot; met from 1922 to 1933. Other artists closely associated with Hiddensee from the period after the First World War are Willy Jaeckel and Joachim Ringelnatz.

Even during the GDR era, numerous artists regularly stayed on Hiddensee and reflected on everyday life and the landscape in their paintings, prints and books, such as the writer Hanns Cibulka. The dancer and dance teacher Gret Palucca spent every summer on Hiddensee from 1948, was given a plot of land in Vitte by the GDR, on which she had a house built in 1961, which was demolished by an investor in 2009. Palucca was buried in the island cemetery in Kloster, where also lies artistic director Walter Felsenstein, who had a house built opposite the Lietzenburg, where he spent the summer months.

Felsenstein&#x27;s neighbor, the painter Willi Berger (1922–2018), lived on Hiddensee since 1955. His catalog raisonné includes more than 4200 paintings, most of them with Hiddensee or people on Hiddensee as a motif. He also restored paintings of the painter Elisabeth Büchsel, but from 1955 to 1979 he was a full-time ornithologist and conservator at the ornithological station of Hiddensee. In his home and studio &quot;Schwalbennest&quot; on the Hügelweg in Kloster, a memorial exhibition was held in October 2019. Whether this will become a permanent exhibition is still uncertain.

Since 1987, the painter Torsten Schlüter celebrates his &quot;Hiddenseer Sommerausstellungen im Garten&quot; at various locations on the island such as the Schliekerschen Haus in Kloster. Currently, he owns an exhibition space in the former arts and crafts store of Irene Hasenberg at the Hotel Dornbusch and a studio in his house above the steep coast of Kloster (Biologist path), which he has named &quot;Anna Hucke&quot; and where he also exhibits in the garden in the summer. The exhibition is held in the garden.

Traditionally, a lot of carving art is made from driftwood and other dead wood on Hiddensee. In the 1970s and 1980s, mainly by the Schierk musician and artist Hanns Mehner (1927–2005), who at that time spent the summer months at his mother-in-law&#x27;s house in Kloster. Mehner&#x27;s owls, totem poles, and faces adorned the front gardens of Kloster (some to this day). After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Jo. Harbort continued this tradition. His wooden sculptures are placed among others at the playgrounds in Vitte and Neuendorf, at the harbors in Kloster and Neuendorf, at the church in Kloster and at the &quot;Inselblick&quot;. Together with the innkeepers &quot;Zum Klausner&quot;, he opened a sculpture park at the inn in 2005, which was created by students of the Theater Sculpture class at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and is expanded annually by new works of the respective class. Harbort&#x27;s sculptures are also displayed at the island view.

Furthermore, there is a tent cinema at the harbor of Vitte and the puppet theater Seebühne in Vitte as well as the galleries &quot;Am Seglerhafen&quot; in Vitte, &quot;Am Torbogen&quot;, &quot;Galerie am Hügel&quot; and &quot;Hedins Oe&quot; in Kloster.

== Others ==
The island of Hiddensee is also called &quot;Sötes Länneken&quot;, sweet little land, by the locals.

Because many members of Berlin&#x27;s bohemian scene spent their summer holidays on Hiddensee during the Weimar period, the island in the capital was also known as the Romanisches Café among the Baltic islands.

In 1974, Nina Hagen released the hit &quot;Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen&quot;, which says: &quot;Hoch stand der Sanddorn am Strand von Hiddensee ...&quot;. The folk duo De Plattfööt also sang about &quot;Hiddensee, Land zwischen Luv un Lee&quot;.

A missile fast patrol boat of the German Navy of the Tarantul class bore the name Hiddensee from 1990 until its decommissioning in 1996. It is now a museum ship at the Battleship Cove naval museum in Massachusetts (USA) and can be visited.

The German Maritime Search and Rescue Service (DGzRS) owns and operates a rescue station with a rescue boat in Vitte.

=== Culinary specialties ===
On the island grows sea buckthorn in large quantities. Its fruits are processed into alcoholic (sea buckthorn liqueur and sea buckthorn spirit) and non-alcoholic beverages (cold and hot sea buckthorn juice), vitamin-rich dishes (sea buckthorn cake and ice cream) and cosmetics, etc. In addition, the local products are dominated by fish, especially freshly caught and smoked. A speciality is the Hiddenseer Schmoraal, for which every old-established Hiddenseer family and every restaurant has its own recipe. Meanwhile, the Boddenzander has also proven its culinary quality. Little known, but all the more admired for its green bones, is the needlefish, which can be found on some menus.

=== House marks ===

Many houses on Hiddensee still have their traditional house marks on them today.

<text>Greifswalder Oie (literally &quot;Greifswald&#x27;s isle&quot;) is a small island in the Baltic Sea, located east of Rügen and north of Usedom on the German coast. The island covers an area of about 54 hectares. The isle forms part of the municipality of Kröslin.

== Geography ==
The Greifswalder Oie is about 1,550 metres long, a maximum of 570 metres wide and, at the cliffs on its eastern side, a maximum of 19 metres high. It is about 12 kilometres off the shore of Usedom and belongs administratively to the municipality of Kröslin on the mainland. On the island, with its striking steep coast, is a 49 metre high lighthouse with one of the strongest beacons in the Baltic. The whole island is a nature reserve.

It was formed during the last ice age, the Weichselian glaciation, by several glacial depositions from Scandinavia. On the Oie a total of three different deposition phases are evident, so that rocks originating in different parts of Scandinavia may be found on the island. 

==History==
The island was first mentioned in 1282 under the name &quot;Swante Wostroe&quot; (Holy island) and given its modern name by 1608, referencing the city of Greifswald, which owned the isle at the time. The island was then sold to Wolgast in 1291, which had to sell it later due to not being able to pay off its debts. In 1527 the island was let to Councillor Henning Oldhaver who used it as a base to fish from, yet the island remained uninhabited, only featuring a seasonally occupied fishing hut. In the mid-17th century, the city of Greifswald let the island to the Swedish Marshal Carl Gustaf Wrangel who planned to make the island into a hunting resort and thus introduced various wild animals to the island; scrapping the plan when the animals ran out. By the end of the 17th-century settlement on the island commenced for the first time, inhabiting the island were a few farmers who lived off of agriculture on the island. During the Great Northern War around 300 Danish soldiers occupied the island and relied on the reserves and produce of the few farmers that lived on the island at the time, depleting them. In 1749 Greifswald ended the lease of Wrangel and transferred the buildings that were at the time present on the island to the ownership of the peasants.

By 1850 three families that let the island from the city permanently settled on the island and lived from fishing as well as farming. Between 1853 and 1855 the architect Hermann Kirchhoff constructed a lighthouse on the island. In 1865 the island had 41 residents. Between 1873 and 1877 a fishing harbor was built on the island which also assisted fishermen nearby that were in maritime emergency. In 1883 the island was sold to the Prussian state by Greifswald as the city could not longer afford to keep the lighthouse and the emergency rescue operations running. The island was used by tourists and became a popular spot for vacationing, and especially swimming, between 1877 and 1937. Tourists were brought to and from the island with a steam-powered ferry that serviced the location multiple times a day.

After World War I, only one family remained on the island, that of Fritz Halliger who lived a natural and self-sustaining life with his children, who he himself educated. In 1928 he built a pension and restaurant on the island to service the guests to the island. Many prominent people such as Asta Nielsen and Thomas Mann visited the island during this time and it became the backdrop to the 1932 movie &quot;F.P.1&quot;.

Around 1929, Johannes Winkler experimented with small LOX methane rockets on the island. Under Nazi-leadership the island fell under the jurisdiction of the Wehrmacht which declared it a military exclusion zone, something it would stay until 1991. Fritz Halliger and his family were forced to leave the island in 1937 and settled in northern Rügen. Between 1937 and 1945, the island was used as a rocket testing site, most notably of the A3, A4 and A5 rockets. See also: List of V-2 test launches. In an operation designated &quot;Lighthouse&quot;, Wernher von Braun oversaw attempts to launch A3 rockets in December 1937, each of which failed. Between 1938 and 1942, the island was the scene for the nearly successful launches of the A5 rockets. Also twenty-eight A4/V2 rockets were launched vertically from Greifswalder Oie between 1943 and 1945. These launches were made in order to observe the reentrance of the rockets into the atmosphere.

By the end of World War II the Red Army dismantled most of the rocketry infrastructure, leaving in the early 1950s to make way for the GDR Navy which permitted tourists to visit the island until 1957. Later, the 6th Border Brigade of the GDR Border Troops was stationed on the island with 25 to 30 men. During these times the island&#x27;s beekeepery was established by the &quot;VEB Forschungsstelle für Bienenwirtschaft&quot;.

==Current situation==
As of the 2000s, the islet is an uninhabited sea bird reserve, save for a single man who works the light house, manages the small emergency yacht harbour (depth ca. 1.6m / 6 ft), and creates outdoor art objects that he scatters along a path that circles the island. There is an infrequent ferry service from Peenemünde and Karlshagen.

<text>Ruden is a small island in the Baltic Sea, between Rügen and Usedom off the German coast. Ruden belongs to the municipality of Kröslin, in the German state (&quot;Bundesland&quot;) of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Before the storm tide of All Saints Day in 1304, Ruden was probably part of a land bridge between Usedom and Rügen.

Today, the Ruden is a nature reserve. On the island there is a private mating station where colonies of Buckfast bees are kept and used for breeding, since the adverse environmental conditions and the distance to the nearest mainland mean that the population cannot mix with other bee colonies.

<text>Vilm is a Baltic Sea island in the bay south of the much larger island of Rügen, and is one of Germany&#x27;s most remote and tranquil spots. Covering less than , Vilm is the remnant of a moraine left as the glaciers retreated about 6000 years ago. Since its formation the shape of the island has gradually changed, with sandbars and beaches forming and eroding continuously. Today the island is shaped like a tadpole, consisting of two distinct parts. Great Vilm, the &quot;head&quot; to the north-east, rises to almost . The low-lying isthmus of Middle Vilm forms a long &quot;tail&quot; to the south-west, which culminates in Little Vilm, a rocky mound about above sea level. The chalky cliffs to the southern side of Great Vilm are rapidly eroding, while sandbanks are building to add a snail-like curl to the tail.

==History==
Vestiges on the island suggest that humans used it in the early Stone Age, not long after its formation. Slavic peoples built a temple there, and its use for spiritual purposes persisted into Christian times, when in the Middle Ages it became a place of pilgrimage. In the early 19th century a law was passed to prevent trees from being felled on the island, and it became a summer residence for aristocrats. In 1936 the fauna and flora of the island were placed under protection to preserve its ancient oak and beech woodlands. After the second world war, Vilm became a favourite destination for tourists from German cities. By 1957 the island&#x27;s public restaurant was used by some 700 visitors a day.

In 1959 the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) closed the island to the public and constructed 11 guesthouses, administrative and farm buildings. From then until the dissolution of the GDR, they used it as a private retreat for high functionaries, including the GDR heads of state Walter Ulbricht and Erich Honecker. Manor homes were built for the &quot;communist elite&quot; and the restaurant served no other customers.

Two days before the end of the GDR, on 1 October 1990, the government designated the island and surrounding seas as a landscape protection area of central importance with the designation &quot;southeast-southwest-Rügen biosphere reserve&quot;. This and other protected areas could not by law be transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany directly; instead the GDR had to sign them over to an individual who could then sign them over to the Federal Republic of Germany. This is how it came to be that the island of Vilm and many other protected areas belonged for one logical second to Christian Patermann, then a high official in the Ministry of the Environment, now retired, but at one time a director in the European Commission.

Thus the island came not only under the administration of the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania but also the responsibility of the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (&quot;Bundesamt für Naturschutz&quot;), which confirmed its designation as a nature reserve, a core area of the Southeast-Rügen Biosphere Reserve.

Three days after its adoption by the Federal Republic of Germany, the &quot;International Nature Conservation Academy&quot; was incorporated under the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation. The academy, which maintains and uses the GDR buildings as an ecological research station, is mandated to provide scientific support to the Federal Secretary of the Environment in matters concerning national and international nature conservation and landscape management, international cooperation, ecosystems, environmental monitoring and research in the Baltic Sea area, and the transfer of scientific method and knowledge.

==Nature==
Although it is small, the surprising natural diversity and beauty of the Isle of Vilm has attracted hundreds of landscape painters over the last two centuries. Most of it is covered in forest that has been undisturbed for decades, and even centuries, with the result that its oak and beech woods are among the most untouched and impressive in Germany, and the island boasts a rich diversity of birds and small mammals. Part of the islandmost of Middle Vilm and all of Little Vilmis strictly closed to all human presence. Swimming is not permitted from any of its beaches. In the winter the bay sometimes freezes, and people can walk across the ice to and from Rügenthough most prefer to take the icebreaker.

Today, the core of the island is designated as protected zone I of the biosphere reserve, while the cleared area with guesthouses is part of the protected zone II, the so-called development and care zone.

The scientists who work on Vilm do not live there, but travel to and from the island daily. The agency has modified some of the buildings for conferences. Conference participants are housed in the cottages built for the ministers. The only thing on the island to distract the delegates from their work is nature; there are no shops, no TV, and no newspapers. Its isolation and complete quiet make it a perfect place for thinking.

The island may be visited only by prior arrangement, via a ferry boat from Lauterbach, from March to October. A maximum of 60 visitors per day are allowed on Vilm.

<text>The City of Stockholm is situated on fourteen islands and on the banks to the archipelago where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic Sea. The city centre is virtually situated on the water.

The area of Stockholm is one of several places in Sweden with a joint valley terrain. In these landscapes erosion along geological joints has split the flattish upper surfaces into low-lying plateaus. In the case of Stockholm the plateau surfaces are remnants of the Sub-Cambrian peneplain.

== Lakes and watercourses ==

The access to fresh water is excellent in Stockholm today. Historically, lakes and watercourses were used as refuse dumps and latrines, causing epidemic cholera and many other diseases. By the 1860s water was being drawn from Årstaviken, the waters south of Södermalm, and was treated in the first water-purifying plant at Skanstull and from there distributed through water mains.

In modern times the city&#x27;s water supply is from Lake Mälaren purified by plants at Norsborg and Lovön, together producing 350,000 m³ per day, which means Stockholm residents are consuming 200 litres per day on average. Water is purified at three plants at Bromma, Henriksdal and Loudden, together filtering some 400,000 m³ sewage per day from pollution, including nitrogen and phosphorus, before discharging it into the Baltic Sea.

Levels of several pollutants in lakes in the central parts of the city, especially on the western side, are far above average, including substances such as cadmium, copper, mercury, and lead. Decreasing usage of several of these substances has reduced these levels in the upper sediments of the lakes.

The Stockholm area used to contain many more lakes and watercourses than it does today, much due to post-glacial rebound, but also because of lake reclamation for settlements and health. Historical lakes, such as Fatburssjön on Södermalm and Träsket on Norrmalm, were putrid and associated with a high mortality rate in Stockholm until the late 19th century. Other historical lakes, like Packartorgsviken and its interior part Katthavet, were filled with mud and equally repulsive. Other lakes still present today were once much larger – such as Magelungen, Drevviken, Judarn, and Råstasjön – while some bays of today once were proper lakes – Brunnsviken and Hammarby sjö.

As in other urban areas, the lakes of Stockholm are directly affected by the city&#x27;s sewer system and pollution from settlements, traffic, and industry. Sewers often reduce the catchment areas of smaller lakes by redirecting surface water to Lake Mälaren or Lake Saltsjön. While nutritious substances such as phosphorus and nitrogen are mostly derived from agriculture, urban areas produce high amounts of metals and organic compounds. In Stockholm, this mostly applies to central bays – such as Klara sjö, Årstaviken, Ulvsundasjön, Riddarfjärden, and Hammarby Sjö - but also waters surrounded by bungalows and villas – like Långsjön in Älvsjö.


== Bridges and viaducts ==

The historical name for Stockholm Old Town was &quot;The city between the bridges&quot; (&quot;Staden mellan broarna&quot;), a name which is still used for the entire city which spans over many islands, islets, and hills. During the course of centuries, the city has seen many bridges relieve each other.

In an urban code dated 1350, King Magnus IV (1316-1377) prescribed the bridges leading over Norrström and Söderström to be built and maintained by the city of Stockholm together with six other cities surrounding Lake Mälaren, as they were the only land passage between the provinces Uppland and Södermanland, north and south of the city respectively. Apparently, in the view of the king, the city, a hundred years after its foundation, was still unable to afford maintenance of its own bridges.

These first bridges were in no sense technically complicated or physically impressive, but rather simple wooden bridges, either floating bridges or beam bridges resting on poles or stone caissons, in either case with spans of no more than a few metres. The width probably corresponded to the directions for public roads, eight ell or 4,8 metres, which was probably more than enough for many centuries. The long and narrow bridges were easily demolished in case of siege, which besides the drawbridges, also necessary for the passing of ships, was an important defensive strategy. As the accounts of the city tells, spring floods and ice break-ups resulted in the frequent destruction of the bridges.

By the mid 17th century, the population of the city had resulted in settlements north and south of Gamla stan, on Norrmalm and Södermalm, and the number of bridges had grown considerably, if not their dimensions or quality. In a map dated 1640, three bridges connects Stadsholmen to Norrmalm passing over Helgeandsholmen, at the time still a group of islets; while two bridges close to each other lead over to Riddarholmen. Several new bridges of considerable length connected Norrmalm to the islets west and east of it; Blasieholmen, at the time still an islet, was connected to the mainland by a bridge called Näckenströms bro, and northward to present day Strandvägen by Stora Ladugårdslandsbron, a bridge on poles; and to the west a bridge connected Norrmalm to Kungsholmen over Blekholmen, a now non-existent islet. By the end of the 17th century, population growth resulted in an additional bridge north of Stadsholmen.

One of the oldest bridges was located where today Stallbron is found, immediately south of the Riksdag Building. The first stone bridge, Norrbro, was built in front of the Royal Palace under Gustav III.

Not until the 20th century, Stockholm was able to surpass the straits and bays surrounding the city. Half of the about 30 bridges in central Stockholm were built 1920–50, most of them during the 1930s. This development was due to increasing traffic loads caused by a fivefold increase of vehicles in the 1920s. At Slussen, passing ships caused stationary rows of trams several hundreds metres long. The situation was solved when a traffic committee in 1930 could present the so-called &quot;clover-leaf solution&quot; of engineer Gösta Lundborg and architect Tage William-Olsson inaugurated in 1935. The modernity of the solution put Stockholm in a state of rapture and impressed even Le Corbusier, who praised the scale of the construction and invited the world to follow the example of Stockholm.

Meanwhile, across the Riddarfjärden bay, construction works had started on Västerbron, the large bridge offering a north–south passage west of the historical city centre. Designed by architects David Dahl and Paul Hedqvist and engineered by Ernst Nilsson and Salomon Kasarnowski, Västerbron became the first large bridge designed by this quartet. Tranebergsbron was inaugurated in 1934, with its span of 200 m, for a few years the world&#x27;s longest span. These large-scale bridges not only tied various parts of the city together, but their mere size changed the cityscape permanently. Considerably smaller but during the decade equally praised was the small Riksbron designed by Ragnar Östberg.

== National parks and nature reserves ==
The nature reserves in Stockholm involves regulations affecting both landowners and the general public by regulating usage of insecticides and fertilizers, construction of bridges, lighting of fires, camping, anchoring, and keeping unleashed dogs. A plan for the care and development of a nature reserve often means the city as well as private landowners are obliged to guarantee the maintenance of the area.

There is one national urban park, Kungliga Nationalstadsparken, and three major nature reserves in Stockholm, Kyrksjölöten, Judarskogen and Grimstaskogen while Hansta is likely to become one soon. Transforming the other areas listed below into nature reserves is being investigated, as they all are regarded to be of great recreational and biological value.
* Judarskogen
* Kyrksjölöten
* Hansta
* Järvafältet
* Kyrkhamn-Lövsta
* Grimstaskogen (Grimsta Nature Reserve)
* Sätraskogen
* Årstaskogen and Årsta holmar
* Älvsjöskogen
* Flaten
* Hammarbyskogen and Nacka Open-Air Area
* Fagersjöskogen and Farstanäset
* Rågsved Open-Air Area

== Places ==
*Riddarfjärden, Riddarholmskyrkan
*Stockholms ström
*Gamla Stan
*Norrmalmstorg
*Sergels Torg
*Djurgården, Gröna Lund
*Norrmalm
*Östermalm
*Södermalm
*Slussen
*Riddarholmskyrkan
*Sager House, Rosenbad
*Stockholm City Hall
*Royal Palace in Stockholm

== Divisions ==
Since 1 January 2017, the city is divided into 14 boroughs as regulated by the City Council (before 2017 there were 18 boroughs). In looser terms, the city is also divided into three major parts:
*Stockholm City Centre (&quot;Innerstaden&quot;)
*South Stockholm (&quot;Söderort&quot;)
*West Stockholm (&quot;Västerort&quot;)

Surrounding the city is the Stockholm Metropolitan Area.

The eastern basins the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga are likewise not considered part of the Baltic Sea proper. Whether islands situated in, or on the borders to, these basins (Åland, Hailuoto and Kotlin) shall be included in the list is therefore a matter of definition.

The Danish islands Zealand (7,000 km² 2,200,000 people), Funen (2,984 km² 400,000 people), Als (312 km² 51,300 people), and Langeland (284 km² 13,300 people) lie in the Danish straits connecting the Baltic Sea and the Kattegat.

<text>Toom–Cook, sometimes known as Toom-3, named after Andrei Toom, who introduced the new algorithm with its low complexity, and Stephen Cook, who cleaned the description of it, is a multiplication algorithm for large integers.

Given two large integers, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, Toom–Cook splits up &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; into &quot;k&quot; smaller parts each of length &quot;l&quot;, and performs operations on the parts. As &quot;k&quot; grows, one may combine many of the multiplication sub-operations, thus reducing the overall computational complexity of the algorithm. The multiplication sub-operations can then be computed recursively using Toom–Cook multiplication again, and so on. Although the terms &quot;Toom-3&quot; and &quot;Toom–Cook&quot; are sometimes incorrectly used interchangeably, Toom-3 is only a single instance of the Toom–Cook algorithm, where &quot;k&quot; = 3.

Toom-3 reduces nine multiplications to five, and runs in Θ(&quot;n&quot;log(5)/log(3)) ≈ Θ(&quot;n&quot;1.46). In general, Toom-&quot;k&quot; runs in , where , &quot;ne&quot; is the time spent on sub-multiplications, and &quot;c&quot; is the time spent on additions and multiplication by small constants. The Karatsuba algorithm is equivalent to Toom-2, where the number is split into two smaller ones. It reduces four multiplications to three and so operates at Θ(&quot;n&quot;log(3)/log(2)) ≈ Θ(&quot;n&quot;1.58).

Although the exponent &quot;e&quot; can be set arbitrarily close to 1 by increasing &quot;k&quot;, the constant term in the function grows very rapidly. The growth rate for mixed-level Toom–Cook schemes was still an open research problem in 2005. An implementation described by Donald Knuth achieves the time complexity .

Due to its overhead, Toom–Cook is slower than long multiplication with small numbers, and it is therefore typically used for intermediate-size multiplications, before the asymptotically faster Schönhage–Strassen algorithm (with complexity ) becomes practical.

Toom first described this algorithm in 1963, and Cook published an improved (asymptotically equivalent) algorithm in his PhD thesis in 1966.

==Details==
This section discusses exactly how to perform Toom-&quot;k&quot; for any given value of &quot;k&quot;, and is a simplification of a description of Toom–Cook polynomial multiplication described by Marco Bodrato. The algorithm has five main steps: 
# Splitting
# Evaluation
# Pointwise multiplication
# Interpolation
# Recomposition

In a typical large integer implementation, each integer is represented as a sequence of digits in positional notation, with the base or radix set to some (typically large) value &quot;b&quot;; for this example we use &quot;b&quot; = 10000, so that each digit corresponds to a group of four decimal digits (in a computer implementation, &quot;b&quot; would typically be a power of 2 instead). Say the two integers being multiplied are:

These are much smaller than would normally be processed with Toom–Cook (grade-school multiplication would be faster) but they will serve to illustrate the algorithm.

=== Splitting ===
In Toom-&quot;k&quot;, we want to split the factors into &quot;k&quot; parts.

The first step is to select the base &quot;B&quot; = &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot;, such that the number of digits of both &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; in base &quot;B&quot; is at most &quot;k&quot; (e.g., 3 in Toom-3). A typical choice for &quot;i&quot; is given by:

:formula_1

In our example we&#x27;ll be doing Toom-3, so we choose . We then separate &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; into their base &quot;B&quot; digits &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot;:

:formula_2

We then use these digits as coefficients in degree- polynomials &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, with the property that &quot;p&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) = &quot;m&quot; and &quot;q&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) = &quot;n&quot;:

:formula_3
:formula_4

The purpose of defining these polynomials is that if we can compute their product , our answer will be .

In the case where the numbers being multiplied are of different sizes, it&#x27;s useful to use different values of &quot;k&quot; for &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, which we&#x27;ll call &quot;k&quot;&quot;m&quot; and &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot;. For example, the algorithm &quot;Toom-2.5&quot; refers to Toom–Cook with &quot;k&quot;&quot;m&quot; = 3 and &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 2. In this case the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;B&quot; = &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot; is typically chosen by:

:formula_5

=== Evaluation ===
The Toom–Cook approach to computing the polynomial product &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a commonly used one. Note that a polynomial of degree &quot;d&quot; is uniquely determined by &quot;d&quot; + 1 points (for example, a line - polynomial of degree one is specified by two points). The idea is to evaluate &quot;p&quot;(·) and &quot;q&quot;(·) at various points. Then multiply their values at these points to get points on the product polynomial. Finally interpolate to find its coefficients.

Since , we will need points to determine the final result. Call this &quot;d&quot;. In the case of Toom-3, &quot;d&quot; = 5. The algorithm will work no matter what points are chosen (with a few small exceptions, see matrix invertibility requirement in Interpolation), but in the interest of simplifying the algorithm it&#x27;s better to choose small integer values like 0, 1, −1, and −2.

One unusual point value that is frequently used is infinity, written ∞ or 1/0. To &quot;evaluate&quot; a polynomial &quot;p&quot; at infinity actually means to take the limit of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)/&quot;x&quot;deg &quot;p&quot; as &quot;x&quot; goes to infinity. Consequently, &quot;p&quot;(∞) is always the value of its highest-degree coefficient (in the example above coefficient m2).

In our Toom-3 example, we will use the points 0, 1, −1, −2, and ∞. These choices simplify evaluation, producing the formulas:

:formula_6

and analogously for &quot;q&quot;. In our example, the values we get are:

As shown, these values may be negative.

For the purpose of later explanation, it will be useful to view this evaluation process as a matrix-vector multiplication, where each row of the matrix contains powers of one of the evaluation points, and the vector contains the coefficients of the polynomial:

: formula_7

The dimensions of the matrix are &quot;d&quot; by &quot;k&quot;&quot;m&quot; for &quot;p&quot; and &quot;d&quot; by &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; for &quot;q&quot;. The row for infinity is always all zero except for a 1 in the last column.

==== Faster evaluation ====
Multipoint evaluation can be obtained faster than with the above formulas. The number of elementary operations (addition/subtraction) can be reduced. The sequence given by Bodrato for Toom-3, executed here over the first operand (polynomial &quot;p&quot;) of the running example is the following:

This sequence requires five addition/subtraction operations, one less than the straightforward evaluation. Moreover the multiplication by 4 in the calculation of &quot;p&quot;(−2) was saved.

=== Pointwise multiplication ===
Unlike multiplying the polynomials &quot;p&quot;(·) and &quot;q&quot;(·), multiplying the evaluated values &quot;p&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) and &quot;q&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) just involves multiplying integers — a smaller instance of the original problem. We recursively invoke our multiplication procedure to multiply each pair of evaluated points. In practical implementations, as the operands become smaller, the algorithm will switch to schoolbook long multiplication. Letting &quot;r&quot; be the product polynomial, in our example we have:

As shown, these can also be negative. For large enough numbers, this is the most expensive step, the only step that is not linear in the sizes of &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;.

=== Interpolation ===
This is the most complex step, the reverse of the evaluation step: given our &quot;d&quot; points on the product polynomial &quot;r&quot;(·), we need to determine its coefficients. In other words, we want to solve this matrix equation for the vector on the right-hand side:

: formula_8

This matrix is constructed the same way as the one in the evaluation step, except that it&#x27;s &quot;d&quot; × &quot;d&quot;. We could solve this equation with a technique like Gaussian elimination, but this is too expensive. Instead, we use the fact that, provided the evaluation points were chosen suitably, this matrix is invertible (see also Vandermonde matrix), and so:

: formula_9

All that remains is to compute this matrix-vector product. Although the matrix contains fractions, the resulting coefficients will be integers — so this can all be done with integer arithmetic, just additions, subtractions, and multiplication/division by small constants. A difficult design challenge in Toom–Cook is to find an efficient sequence of operations to compute this product; one sequence given by Bodrato for Toom-3 is the following, executed here over the running example:

We now know our product polynomial &quot;r&quot;:

: formula_10

If we were using different &quot;k&quot;&quot;m&quot;, &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot;, or evaluation points, the matrix and so our interpolation strategy would change; but it does not depend on the inputs and so can be hard-coded for any given set of parameters.

=== Recomposition ===

Finally, we evaluate r(B) to obtain our final answer. This is straightforward since B is a power of &quot;b&quot; and so the multiplications by powers of B are all shifts by a whole number of digits in base &quot;b&quot;. In the running example b = 104 and B = b2 = 108.

And this is in fact the product of 1234567890123456789012 and 987654321987654321098.

==Interpolation matrices for various &quot;k&quot;==

Here we give common interpolation matrices for a few different common small values of &quot;k&quot;&quot;m&quot; and &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

=== Toom-1 ===
Applying formally the definition, we may consider Toom-1 (&quot;k&quot;&quot;m&quot; = &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 1). This does not yield a multiplication algorithm, but a recursive algorithm that never halts, as it trivially reduces each input instance to a recursive call with the same instance. The algorithm requires 1 evaluation point, whose value is irrelevant, as it is used only to &quot;evaluate&quot; constant polynomials. Thus, the interpolation matrix is the identity matrix:

: formula_11

=== Toom-1.5 ===
Toom-1.5 (&quot;k&quot;&quot;m&quot; = 2, &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 1) is still degenerate: it recursively reduces one input by halving its size, but leaves the other input unchanged, hence we can make it into a multiplication algorithm only if we supply a 1 × &quot;n&quot; multiplication algorithm as a base case (whereas the true Toom–Cook algorithm reduces to constant-size base cases). It requires 2 evaluation points, here chosen to be 0 and ∞. Its interpolation matrix is then the identity matrix:

: formula_12

The algorithm is essentially equivalent to a form of long multiplication: both coefficients of one factor are multiplied by the sole coefficient of the other factor.

=== Toom-2 ===
Toom-2 (&quot;k&quot;&quot;m&quot; = 2, &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 2) requires 3 evaluation points, here chosen to be 0, 1, and ∞. It is the same as Karatsuba multiplication, with an interpolation matrix of:

: formula_13

=== Toom-2.5 ===
Toom-2.5 (&quot;k&quot;&quot;m&quot; = 3, &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 2) requires 4 evaluation points, here chosen to be 0, 1, −1, and ∞. It then has an interpolation matrix of:

: formula_14

<text>Anna Cecilia Sahlin (born 11 May 1976), known professionally as Anna Sahlene and formerly by the one-word stage name Sahlene, is a Swedish singer and actress best known for placing third at the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 representing Estonia with &quot;Runaway&quot;.

==Early life/career==
Born in Söderhamn on 11 May 1976, Sahlene was the oldest of seven children having three younger brothers and three younger sisters. Both her parents had strong musical inclinations which were passed on to their children, with Sahlene herself singing from an early age in addition to learning cello, guitar, oboe and piano. However her performing career began as an actress: at age nine she had a lead role in &quot;The Children of Noisy Village&quot; (1986), based on a story by Astrid Lindgren, and subsequently reprised her role - that of Anna - in the sequel &quot;More About the Children of Noisy Village&quot; (1987) appearing in both films billed as Anna Sahlin.

Sahlene did not pursue a performing career subsequent to these two films - although she appeared on television in 1989 when the two &quot;Noisy Village&quot; films were run as a seven part series - until the age of eighteen when she moved to Stockholm with aspirations to be a singer. She was for several years a member of One Voice a gospel choir directed by Gabriel Forss whose members also performed as background vocalists on recordings by such artists as Eric Gadd, Carola and Robyn.

She was among the members of One Voice who formed the chorale for the Charlotte Nilsson performance of &quot;Take Me to Your Heaven&quot; at Eurovision 1999 where, representing Sweden, the number won. At the subsequent Eurovision 2000, held in Stockholm, Sahlene was again onstage as one of the members of One Voice who formed the chorale for the Claudette Pace performance of the Maltese entrant &quot;Desire&quot;. Sahlene&#x27;s own recording career began in 1997 when she fronted the band Rhythm Avenue on their album &quot;Twelve Steps Down the Avenue&quot;.

==As Sahlene==

===&quot;The Little Voice&quot;===
Sahlene&#x27;s first solo single in 2000 was called &quot;The Little Voice&quot; (&quot;The Little Voice&quot; did not pick up much airplay until it was later covered and released as a single by Hilary Duff in 2004, though with almost entirely rewritten lyrics). Three videos were made for tracks recorded by Sahlene for Roadrunner Arcade Music: &quot;Fifth Element&quot;; &quot;The Little Voice&quot;, landing in the top 5 of MTV Nordic&#x27;s most played list; and &quot;Fishies&quot;, filmed on location in Sardinia, Italy. &quot;The Little Voice&quot; and the 2001 single release &quot;House&quot; were both minor Swedish chart hits for Sahlene with respective peaks of #51 and #52. Sahlene recorded tracks for a &quot;The Little Voice&quot; album release which was shelved due to EMG&#x27;s buyout of Roadrunner Arcade Music and its eventual fall into bankruptcy. However Sahlene was afforded the opportunity to serve as opening act at Swedish concerts by Robert Plant and Bon Jovi as part of the promotion for &quot;The Little Voice&quot; album prior to its release being canceled.

===Eurovision 2002/ &quot;Runaway&quot;===
Sahlene was subsequently signed to Virgin Records Sweden but had yet to record for that label when Virgin Sweden was contacted in January 2002 by Estonian pop group 2 Quick Start, who had entered their composition &quot;Runaway&quot; in Eurolaul 2002: top Estonian pop star Ines had recorded the demo of &quot;Runaway&quot; but opted out of performing the song in Eurolaul and 2 Quick Start, unable to solicit another Estonian singer, were now hoping to recruit a singer from Sweden. Virgin Records telephoned Sahlene with the offer to perform &quot;Runaway&quot; at Eurolaul 2002 the evening of the day the label was contacted by the songwriters and at 6 a.m. the following morning Sahlene flew to the Estonian capital of Tallinn where she rehearsed with 2 Quick Start over the two weeks remaining prior to Eurolaul 2002.

On 26 January 2002 Sahlene&#x27;s performance of &quot;Runaway&quot; at Eurolaul 2002 resulted in a first-place finish, with &quot;Runaway&quot; resultantly becoming the Estonian entrant for Eurovision 2002 and on the night of competition for Eurovision 2002 - mounted 25 May 2002 at Saku Suurhall Arena in Tallinn - Sahlene&#x27;s performance of &quot;Runaway&quot; resulted in a third-place finish.

&quot;Runaway&quot; debuted at #20 on the Swedish singles chart dated 12 June 2002 but failed to rise higher although it did spend 14 weeks in the Top 40 with seven of those weeks in the Top 25.

===2003 (Melodifestivalen/ debut album) - 2004===
In 2003 Sahlene made her first bid to represent her native Sweden at Eurovision participating in Melodifestivalen, the Swedish national preselection round for Eurovision, with the number &quot;We&#x27;re Unbreakable&quot; which on 8 March 2003 bowed out of Melodifestivalen 2003 with a fifth-place finish in Round #1 of Semi-Final #4. Sahlene had freely admitted prior to Melodifestivalen 2003 that the intent of her Melodifestivalen participation was to showcase &quot;We&#x27;re Unbreakable&quot; only to the point of securing a hit in Sweden and Estonia: she was sure &quot;We&#x27;re Unbreakable&quot; would not be voted by the Swedish public as their Eurovision entrant and Sahlene in fact preferred not to compete on the Eurovision main stage for a second consecutive year.

&quot;We&#x27;re Unbreakable&quot; was included on Sahlene&#x27;s debut album &quot;It&#x27;s Been a While&quot; which mostly consisted of tracks from her unreleased &quot;Little Voice&quot; album and also contained &quot;Runaway&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s Been a While&quot; was released on M&amp;L Records - a Lionheart Music Group label - in April 2003 and &quot;Unbreakable&quot; became a hit on Swedish radio although it was not released as a physical single and therefore did not chart.

Sahlene&#x27;s name was leaked as a possible performer for the Melodifestivalen 2004 entrant &quot;Baby I Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;: however the eventual performer of the song was Gladys del Pilar.

Sahlene was a guest performer on the album &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; by the Joybells, singing the title track for that summer 2004 release.

==As Anna Sahlene==

===2005===
In February 2005 Sahlene&#x27;s second album &quot;Photograph&quot; was released on M&amp;L&#x27;s parent label Lionheart with artist credit reading Anna Sahlene: the addition of the first name &quot;Anna&quot; to Sahlene&#x27;s professional name was first evident on this album&#x27;s advance single &quot;Creeps&quot; - released in January 2005 to become a hit in both Sweden (#28) and Finland (#13) - and the subject of this article has been credited as &quot;Anna Sahlene&quot; in all her subsequent professional endeavors, including voicing the character of &quot;Cappy&quot; in the Swedish-language dubbed version of the animated film &quot;Robots&quot; (released by 20th Century Fox March 2005).

===2006 (Melodifestivalen) - 2007===
In 2006 Anna Sahlene again vied to represent Sweden at Eurovision participating in Melodifestivalen 2006 with the song &quot;This Woman&quot; which Sahlene composed with Bobby Ljunggren and Henrik Wikström: &quot;This Woman&quot; bowed out of Melodifestivalen 2006 in the first semi-final having finished that round in fifth place and thus just missing the cut-off for advancement. However Sahlene&#x27;s recording of &quot;This Woman&quot; - released on M&amp;L - did return her to the Swedish Top 20 for the first time since &quot;Runaway&quot; with &quot;This Woman&quot; peaking at #19 in March 2006 although the eight-week chart tenure of &quot;This Woman&quot; was far briefer than that of the #20 hit &quot;Runaway&quot;.

Sahlene was one of the contestants on the 2007 season of the Swedish TV show &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; on TV4. Sahlene was voted off the show, which was won by Lasse Brandeby.

On 11 August 2007 Sahlene began an extended run in the female lead Ariel Moore in the musical &quot;Footloose&quot; in Gothenburg: the show moved to Stockholm on 20 February 2008.

===2008 - 09 (Melodifestivalen)===
In January 2008 it was announced that Sahlene would possibly participate in that year&#x27;s Selecția Națională: the national preselection round for Romania in Eurovision: although the demo of the number &quot;Dr Frankenstein&quot; had only featured vocalist LaGaylia Frazier it was tentatively planned that the number would be performed in Selecția Națională as a duet by Frazier and Sahlene with the duo being billed as LaSal. However, by the month&#x27;s end it was confirmed that Sahlene&#x27;s schedule would not permit her to participate in Selecția Națională (&quot;Dr Frankenstein&quot; as performed by LaGaylia Frazier at the Selecția Națională final of 23 February 2008 finished in tenth place). Sahlene was a guest performer at Eurolaul 2008 broadcast live from the Eesti Televisioon Studio in Tallinn on 2 February 2008 previewing her upcoming single release, a cover version of Maria Arredondo&#x27;s #4 2007 Norwegian hit &quot;Brief and Beautiful&quot;.

Sahlene again bid to represent Sweden at Sweden at Eurovision 2009, competing in Melodifestivalen 2009 with &quot;Killing Me Tenderly&quot; a duet with Maria Haukaas Storeng: conceived as a solo, the song&#x27;s composers had recast &quot;Killing Me Tenderly&quot; as a duet upon finding the demo submitted by Sahlene and that submitted by Storeng equally impressive. &quot;Killing Me Tenderly&quot; bowed out of Melodifestivalen 2009 in Semi-Final #4 - held 28 February 2009 - in seventh place: however the recording of &quot;Killing Me Tenderly&quot; by Anna Sahlene and Maria Haukaas Storeng - released on M&amp;L - rose as high on the Swedish charts as #10 (though with a very brief overall chart tenure of three weeks).

On 24 October 2010 Sahlene performed at a &quot;Eurovision Night After Dark&quot; party held at the Swedish embassy in Washington D.C.

===Recent career===
In 2010 Sahlene was one of several artists featured &quot;Ta Min Hand&quot; a charity single in support of SOS Children&#x27;s Villages; Sahlene was also among the personnel of &quot;Ta Min Hand&quot; who performed at an accompanying fundraising concert held at Kungsträdgården on 20 November 2010 - the day of the single&#x27;s release.

From autumn 2010, Anna Sahlene and LaGaylia Frazier extensively toured Sweden with an R&amp;B-oriented live show entitled the Blues Mothers.

2012 saw the first release of any new recordings by Sahlene in four years, with the single &quot;Jamie&quot; released on 27 February and the follow-up &quot;Horns of Mississippi&quot; released on 6 July 2012: these two singles are included on the eleven-track album &quot;Roses&quot; released on 26 September 2012.

It was announced that as of 27 December 2012 Sahlene will perform in the role of Maria Magdalena in the Göta Lejon Theatre production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.

In 2013 Sahlene voiced the character of Queen Tara in the Swedish-language dubbed version of the animated film &quot;Epic&quot; released by 20th Century Fox in May 2013.

It was announced on 5 May 2016 that Sahlene and Dea Norberg will be the backing vocalists for Dami Im when she performs the 2016 Australian entry for Eurovision: &quot;Sound of Silence&quot;, which Im is scheduled to perform in the second semi-final on 11 May 2016 at the Globen: a Top Ten place in the semi-final will entitle Im to perform &quot;Sound of Silence&quot; in the Eurovision 2016 Grand Final held at the Globen on the night of 14 May 2016. At the 5 May 2016 rehearsals for Im&#x27;s semi-final performance Sahlene and Norberg performed their background vocals offstage.

In autumn 2018 she played the role Grace Farrell in Nöjesteaterns production of the stage musical &quot;Annie&quot;. She reprised her role in the spring of 2019 in Lorensbergsteatern in Göteborg.

In May 2019, she provided backing vocals at Eurovision 2019 for the United Kingdom&#x27;s entry “Bigger Than Us” by Michael Rice.

She entered Eesti Laul 2022 with the song &quot;Champion&quot; finishing 4th.

In 2023, she participated in the Netflix series &quot;Squid Game: The Challenge&quot; as Player 142.

<doc id="330065" wikidata="Q666495" url="?curid=330065" title="Trilok Gurtu">
<text>Trilok Gurtu (born 30 October 1951) is an Indian percussionist and composer whose work has blended the music of India with jazz fusion and world music.

He has worked with Terje Rypdal, Gary Moore, John McLaughlin, Jan Garbarek, Joe Zawinul, Michel Bisceglia, Bill Laswell, Maria João &amp; Mário Laginha, Stefano Bollani and Robert Miles.

==Early life==
Gurtu was born to Hindu Brahmin parents in Mumbai, India; he had a Kashmiri Pandit father and a Marathi mother. He attended Don Bosco High School (Matunga) in Mumbai. His mother, the famous Hindustani classical and semi-classical vocalist Shobha Gurtu, encouraged him to learn playing tabla, and he received formal training in percussion from Shah Abdul Karim.

==Career==

Gurtu began playing a western drum kit in the 1970s, and developed an interest in jazz. In a 1995 television special on Jimi Hendrix, Gurtu mentioned having initially learned Western music without awareness of overdubbing, which, he said, forced him to learn multiple parts which most musicians would have never attempted. In the 1970s, he played with Charlie Mariano, John Tchicai, Terje Rypdal, and Don Cherry.

One of Gurtu&#x27;s earliest recordings was on &quot;Apo-Calypso&quot;, a 1977 album by the German ethnic fusion band Embryo. His mother also sang in that record, and later joined him on his first solo CD, &quot;Usfret&quot;.

In the 1980s, Gurtu played with Swiss drummer Charly Antolini and with John McLaughlin in McLaughlin&#x27;s trio, accompanied variously by bassists Jonas Hellborg, Jeff Berlin, Kai Eckhardt, and Dominique DiPiazza. The line-up with Hellborg performed at least one concert opening for Miles Davis in Berkeley, California in 1988.

Collaboration between Gurtu and McLaughlin included vocal improvisations using the Indian &quot;tala talk&quot; method of oral drumming notations for teaching drum patterns. Sometimes, Eckhardt would join in with hip-hop beat-box vocals for a three-way vocal percussion jam, while Gurtu and McLaughlin would throw in a few amusing words such as some Japanese brand names mixed with some Indian words.

Some of the unusual aspects of Gurtu&#x27;s drum playing include playing without a drum stool, in a half-kneeling position on the floor, and the use of an unconventional kick drum that resembles a large drum head with a kick-pedal, and a mix of tablas and western drums. Gurtu&#x27;s unique percussion signature involves dipping cymbals and strings of shells into a bucket of water to create a shimmering effect.

Gurtu joined Oregon after the death of drummer Collin Walcott. He played on three of their records: Ecotopia (1987), &quot;45th Parallel&quot; (1989), and &quot;Always, Never and Forever&quot; (1991).

In the early 1990s, Gurtu resumed his career as a solo artist and a bandleader. Various noted musicians have backed him on a number of his CD releases.

In 1999, Zakir Hussain and Bill Laswell founded a musical group, Tabla Beat Science, which played a mixture of Hindustani music, Asian underground, ambient, Drum and Bass, and Electronica. Gurtu joined this group along with Karsh Kale and Talvin Singh. The group released three albums before going dormant in late 2003.

In 2004, Gurtu created an album, &quot;Miles Gurtu&quot;, with Robert Miles. His collaboration with the Arkè String Quartet began in 2007 with the release of the album &quot;Arkeology&quot;.

In 2010, Trilok Gurtu played on the album &quot;Piano Car&quot;, an opera of minimalist composer Stefano Ianne with Ricky Portera, Nick Beggs (Kajagoogoo), Mario Marzi, Terl Bryant (John Paul Jones/Led Zeppelin), John De Leo.

In 2012, Trilok Gurtu collaborated with electronic folk duo Hari &amp; Sukhmani in their hometown of Chandigarh and produced a song &#x27;Maati&#x27; on the music documentary-travelogue The Dewarists.

==Legacy==
Trilok Gurtu is universally acknowledged as one of the most innovative and ground breaking percussionists around; integrating swords, buckets and other non-conventional elements and into his sound. Zakir Hussain said that if Trilok Gurtu played only the tabla, he would have been the best tabla player in the world.

Deadmau5 (Joel Zimmerman) mentions Trilok Gurtu as his hero and adds &quot;You know who&#x27;s a big hero of mine? Trilok Gurtu... Indians should know this. Indian traditional percussive algos (algorhythms) and modes blow my mind. Check him out. Full-on retarded isolation skills. I can&#x27;t even chew gum and walk. There&#x27;s a whole different language/notation to a tabla.&quot;

==Style==
&quot;An open-minded musician who embraces Jazz, Indian classical music, abstract improvisational and Asian pop, a dazzling percussion virtuoso, an accessible entertainer&quot; – The Guardian UK.

He is self-confessedly strongly influenced by the rhythms of Africa and African beats and drumming patterns.

<doc id="330072" wikidata="Q845623" url="?curid=330072" title="Weston-super-Mare">
<text>Weston-super-Mare ( ) is a seaside town and civil parish in the North Somerset district, in the ceremonial county of Somerset, England. It lies by the Bristol Channel south-west of Bristol between Worlebury Hill and Bleadon Hill. Its population at the 2021 census was 82,418.

The area around the town has been occupied since the Iron Age. It was still a small village until the 19th century when it developed as a seaside resort. A railway station and two piers were built. In the second half of the 20th century it was connected to the M5 motorway but the number of people holidaying in the town declined and some local industries closed, although the number of day visitors has risen.

Attractions include the Grand Pier, Weston Museum and The Helicopter Museum. Cultural venues include The Playhouse, the Winter Gardens and the Blakehay Theatre.

The Bristol Channel has the second largest tidal range in the world; the low tide mark in Weston Bay is about from the seafront. The beach is sandy but low tide reveals areas of thick mud which are dangerous to walk on. The mouth of the River Axe is at the south end of the beach. To the north of the town is Sand Point which marks the upper limit of the Bristol Channel and the lower limit of the Severn Estuary. In the centre of the town is Ellenborough Park, which is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the range of plant species found there.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Weston&quot; comes from Old English for west &quot;tun&quot; or settlement; &quot;super mare&quot; is Latin for &quot;upon the sea&quot;
and was added to distinguish it from the many other settlements named Weston in the Diocese of Bath and Wells.

In considering the ultimate origin of the name, ‘Weston’, we need to ask exactly what the settlement or estate of that name was considered to be west &quot;of&quot; – since such ‘cardinal’ place-names usually only arise in relation to another, perhaps ‘superior’ estate to which they were somehow directly related. In this respect, some of the place-names in the wider landscape around Weston may hold a clue, and two especially – Norton and Milton. Norton, on the low-lying levels land immediately to the north of Worle Hill, is, simply, the ‘north &quot;tūn&quot;’. Norton, which historically was in Kewstoke parish, was certainly in existence by the early 13th century, and can be confidently asserted to be of at least late Anglo-Saxon foundation. Milton is ‘the middle &quot;tūn&quot;’. It seems at various times to have been split between Weston and Worle parishes. Milton is actually mentioned by name in Domesday Book (1086), and is certainly of at least late Anglo-Saxon origin. Taking the three places together – the west, the middle, and the north &quot;tūnas - ,&quot; and looking for a bigger, more important place to which these three were subservient, and in direct relation to which they took their names, the most obvious solution is Worle, which by the late 11th century, as shown by Domesday Book, was a substantial estate. Milton lies directly between Weston and Worle, although rather closer to Worle. So by, say, the year 1000 CE, we can perhaps imagine a large estate centred on Worle, at the eastern end of Worle Hill and with the hill itself, indeed, forming in effect, its backbone, and taking in a swathe of territory to the north and south of the hill (probably including Kewstoke), and all the way to its west &quot;tūn&quot; at the coast. This would make an economically very viable estate, which would have included a variety of different types of agricultural land, on the hill, on the lower flanks of the hill, and on the low-lying levels land to both north and south of the hill.

Weston is not identified by name in Domesday Book, but as almost certainly a recognised territorial entity before the Norman Conquest, it would have been liable for tax, even if at only a low level. Most reliable authorities consider that Weston&#x27;s tax assessment in Domesday is subsumed, without identification by name, within the assessment for Ashcombe.

Prior to 1348 it was known as Weston-juxta-Mare (&quot;beside the sea&quot;). The name was changed by Ralph of Shrewsbury, who was the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Between the 14th and 17th centuries the &#x27;super Mare&#x27; part of the name disappeared and it was just known as Weston, although in 1610 it was recorded as Weston on the More; &#x27;môr&#x27; being the Welsh word for sea but this could be a misreading or misunderstanding of the Latin word &#x27;mare&#x27;.

==History==

===Early history===
Weston&#x27;s oldest structure is Worlebury Camp, on Worlebury Hill, dating from the Iron Age. However, outside of the hillfort itself, a series of extremely important, rock-cut burials, and fragmentary remains, of this date have turned up intermittently during the course of progressive development on the southern slope of Worlebury Hill. These have been reviewed by Emily La-Trobe Bateman, whose Extensive Urban Survey of Weston, undertaken by her on behalf of the former Avon County Council, is an extremely important and authoritative modern source for the general history of Weston, but especially for the earlier, more &#x27;archaeologically dependent&#x27; periods, and it should be far more widely known.

La-Trobe Bateman has identified two clusters of such burials in particular: one in the Montpelier area, and the other to the north-east of Knightstone Road. Bateman follows an earlier suggestion by Jane Evans that there may have been a major Iron Age cemetery related to the hillfort, on the slopes of the hill. The 15 or so discoveries known at the time that Bateman was writing, may, she suggests, represent only a fraction of the burials and cremations that originally existed. Most interestingly, she further suggests that

It is deeply regrettable that many of these remains were chance finds, during 19th or early 20th century construction, and were poorly recorded, if at all. However, remarkably, during archaeological evaluation work in 2005, prior to the construction of a new parish room on the north-western side of St John&#x27;s church, a crouched inhumation burial, with pottery indicating a mid- to late-Iron Age date, was discovered within the churchyard, below a series of unmarked post-medieval burials. This is one of the very few such finds on Weston hillside that has been excavated and recorded to full modern archaeological standards. This ground had clearly been sacred to this individual, and his community, at the very least about 1,500 years before any Christian church had been established on the site. But controversially, the local incumbent at the time refused permission for the individual to be reinterred within the graveyard, on the grounds that he had not been a Christian.

An occupation site of Romano-British date was investigated in 2008-2009 as part of a planning application by Weston College immediately to the west of the School of Science and Art, on the south side of South Terrace. This built on investigations that had already been carried out on the site in the late 1950s which strongly suggested the presence of Romano-British occupation. It is the only site known of this date in central Weston and was probably a small farmstead or hamlet. Finds included an extremely important burial of a male individual who had clearly led a very hard life, and had suffered multiple medical conditions which were expressed on his skeletal remains. It is possible that he had been a slave.

The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred. Contrary to earlier edits of this page, the site known as Castle Batch, a small motte-type fortification of probably late 11th or 12th century date, has no direct spatial relationship whatsoever to Weston, since it lies at Worle, 4.7 km to the north-east of Weston&#x27;s original parish church of St John.

The medieval church of St John was demolished in 1824 and rebuilt on the same site, though a stump of the medieval preaching cross survives by the exterior south wall. A font of Norman date, in and of itself, represents firm evidence for the presence of a church on this site by the late 11th or 12th century. The former rectory is a 17th-century structure with later additions. Though it remains adjacent to the church, it has not been a parsonage house since the end of the 19th century. Today it is known as Glebe House and is divided into flats.

The Old Thatched Cottage restaurant on the seafront carries the date 1774, but this is entirely baseless and without attested historical foundation of any kind whatsoever. The actual date of its construction is in fact completely unknown. The building is Grade II Listed, and its formal Historic England listing description states only that it is &quot;late 18th century, certainly before 1804&quot;. Historical evidence examined by one of Weston&#x27;s foremost modern historians shows that it was definitely extant by June of that year (ie 1804), and a construction date of &quot;by&quot; 1803 might therefore be distinctly possible. It cannot date to before 1779, which is when its builder, William Leeves, became Rector of Wrington, and Leeves is not known to have had any prior connection with Weston. Likewise, a recurrent tradition of an earlier building on the site, occupied by a man called Light, is also currently without any foundation whatsoever in terms of either historical or archaeological evidence. It is perfectly possible that the story is entirely apocryphal - its provenance cannot be traced back any further than 1966, to an article in a local newspaper, in which the writer fails to note the exact source of his account.

===19th century===

Early in the 19th century, Weston was a small village of about 30 houses, located behind a line of sand dunes fronting the sea, which had been created as an early sea wall after the Bristol Channel floods of 1607. The Pigott family of Brockley, who were the local Lords of the Manor, had a summer residence at Grove House. Weston owes its growth and prosperity to the Victorian era boom in seaside holidays. Construction of the first hotel in the village started in 1808; it was called &quot;Reeves&quot; (now the Royal Hotel). Along with nearby Burnham-on-Sea, Weston benefited from proximity to Bristol, Bath and South Wales. The first attempt at an artificial harbour was made in the late 1820s at the islet of Knightstone and a slipway built from Anchor Head towards Birnbeck Island.
Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his family lived in Weston, at Swiss Villa (towards the north end of Trevelyan road), while he was supervising the construction of the Bristol and Exeter Railway in the area. With the opening of the railway in 1841, thousands of visitors came to the town from Bristol, the Midlands and further afield, on works outings and bank holidays. Mining families also came across the Bristol Channel from South Wales by paddle steamer. To cater for them, Birnbeck Pier was completed in 1867, offering in its heyday amusement arcades, tea rooms, amusement rides and a photographic studio. It is now in a derelict state and has been added to English Heritage&#x27;s Buildings at Risk Register, but visitors can still admire its structure from behind barbed wire. It was designed by Eugenius Birch with ironwork by the Isca Foundry of Newport, Monmouthshire. It is a grade II* listed building.

Large areas of land were released for development from the 1850s onwards. Large detached villas, for the middle classes, were built on the southern slopes of Worlebury Hill. Semi-detached and terraced housing was built on the low &quot;moorland&quot; behind the sea front in an area known as South Ward. Many of these houses have now been converted into bedsits. Most of the houses built in the Victorian era are built from stone and feature details made from Bath Stone, influenced by local architect Hans Price.

In 1885, the first transatlantic telegraph cable of the Commercial Cable Company was brought ashore and the company started a long association with the town, ending in 1962.

Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of wireless telegraphy, successfully transmitted radio signals across the Bristol Channel in the spring of 1897, from Penarth (near Cardiff) to Brean Down (just south west of Weston, on the other side of the River Axe).

A second railway, the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway, opened on 1 December 1897, connecting Weston to Clevedon. The terminus station was at Ashcombe Road. The railway was extended to Portishead on 7 August 1907 but was closed in 1940.

===Architecture===
Much of the character of the buildings in the town derives from the use of local stone, much of it from the Town Quarry. Notable among the architects working in the 19th century was Hans Price (1835–1912). Many examples of his work are still to be seen: the Town Hall, the &quot;Mercury&quot; Office, the Constitutional Club (originally the Lodge of St Kew), villas and numerous other domestic dwellings. The Odeon Cinema by Thomas Cecil Howitt is notable for fully retaining many Art Deco features both internally and externally, and retaining its original theatre organ, a Compton from 1935. It is believed to be the only cinema organ in the West Country left working in its original location and is still in regular use. Other organs by Compton in Weston-super-Mare can be found at Victoria Methodist Church and All Saints&#x27; Church by George Bodley (modelled on that in Downside Abbey).

===20th century===
Local traders, unhappy that visitors were not coming as far as the centre of the town, built a new pier closer to the main streets. Opened in 1904, and known as the Grand Pier, it was designed to be long. Further development occurred after World War I, with the Winter Gardens Pavilion in 1927, the open air pool, with its arched concrete diving board, and an airfield dating from the inter-war period. Art Deco influences can be seen in much of the town&#x27;s architecture from this period.

During World War II over 10,000 official evacuees were accommodated in the town, however only 130 spent four or more years in the town. The area was also home to war industries, such as aircraft and pump manufacture, and a Royal Air Force station at RAF Locking. The town was also on the return route of bombers targeting Bristol and was itself bombed by the Luftwaffe. The first bombs fell in June 1940, but the worst attacks were in January 1941 and in June 1942. Large areas of the town were destroyed, particularly Orchard Street and the Boulevard. On 3 and 4 January 1941, incendiary bombs fell on the town. The Air Ministry set up a &quot;Q-station&quot; decoy at Bleadon in an attempt to divert the bombers to an unpopulated area. In all 110 civilians lost their lives through enemy action in the borough. In the later part of the war, United States Army troops were billeted in the area, but they were relocated in the run-up to D-Day.
RAF Weston-super-Mare was opened in 1936 by No. 24 Group, with a single tarmac runway. It served as a flying candidates selection and initial training facility, and as a relief airport during World War II, latterly as the Polish Air Force Staff College from April 1944 to April 1946. After the war it served as a logistics supply station, with helicopter makers Westland Helicopters on site until closure in 1987. Today there is an operational heliport on site used occasionally by the RAF Search and Rescue service. The former Westland site, which closed in 2002, houses the Helicopter Museum featuring examples of Westland aircraft. Pride of place is given to an immaculate Westland Wessex HCC Mk.4, formerly of the Queen&#x27;s Flight.

Residential areas outside the town centre include Ashcombe and the Oldmixon, Coronation, and Bournville housing estates, built in the mid to late 20th century.

In 1986, Weston General Hospital was opened on the edge of Uphill village, replacing the Queen Alexandra Memorial Hospital on The Boulevard, which was opened in 1928.

===21st century===

Around 2000, the town saw a growth in residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation treatment centres, with attendant crime and social problems. These problems were highlighted by Weston&#x27;s councillors and newspapers, and by the Member of Parliament (MP), John Penrose during his maiden speech in the House of Commons in 2005. By 2009, Weston was home to around 11% of drug rehabilitation places in the UK, and North Somerset Council proposed an accreditation system examining the quality of counselling, staff training, transparency of referral arrangements, along with measures of the treatment&#x27;s effectiveness and site inspections. By 2012, there had been a significant reduction in the number of rehabilitation facilities in the town, with the number of patient beds having nearly halved.

A structure known as &quot;Silica&quot; was installed at Big Lamp Corner during 2006. It is a piece of public art, an advertising sign, a retail kiosk selling newspapers and hot food, as well as a bus shelter. It has been criticised by local residents who liken it to a carrot or a space ship, although it is meant to symbolise man&#x27;s harmony with the sea. This was part of North Somerset Council&#x27;s ongoing civic pride initiative that has sought to revitalise Weston-super-Mare&#x27;s public spaces, which had suffered a period of decline. Other public space improvements have been made throughout the town such as improvements to the street scene in Grove Park Village.

On 28 July 2008, the pavilion at the end of the Grand Pier was completely destroyed by a fire. Eleven fire engines and 80 firefighters could not contain the blaze, which is believed to have started in the north-east tower of the Pavilion. A competition was held to design a new pavilion, and the project was awarded to the winning architect Angus Meek Architects of Bristol. Construction work began on the pier and new pavilion in 2009, and it was scheduled to reopen in July 2010, after a £39 million rebuilding programme. After continuing problems and setbacks, with the pier not opening until a formal opening ceremony on 23 October 2010, the overall costs reached £51 million. During the same period there was a £34 million redevelopment of the promenade, including refurbishment of the Marine Lake and pedestrianisation of Pier Square. As part of the work, a scour protection apron and splash wall were added as part of flood prevention measures.

In March 2017 Weston-super-Mare was chosen as one of the 10 successful bids for the first phase of the creation of Heritage Action Zones (HAZ) a scheme where Historic England works with local partners in places with significant historic environment to use that heritage to help build economic growth and other opportunities in the locality. Over a three-year period the Heritage Action Zone aimed to boost economic growth and researched Weston&#x27;s heritage and urban development, by reviewing Weston&#x27;s listed buildings, using aerial photographs, undertaking a historic characterisation of Weston-super-Mare, its land and sea environs and a report on the architecture of the town, which culminated with the publication of a new book &quot;Weston-super-Mare The town and its seaside heritage&quot;.

In November 2021, it was announced that North Somerset Council had agreed to purchase Birnbeck Pier from its owners and planned to restore it with additional funding from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), Historic England, and others.

Newer housing has since been built towards the east of the town in North Worle, Milton, Locking Parklands, Weston Village, Haywood Village and West Wick, nearer to the M5 motorway.
Weston-super-Mare has expanded to include the established villages of Worle, Uphill, and West Wick, as well as new areas such as Locking Parklands and Haywood Village.

==Governance==

Municipal history began in 1842 when a Local Act was obtained for &quot;paving, lighting, watching, cleansing and otherwise improving the Town of Weston-super-Mare in the County of Somerset and for establishing a Market therein&quot; under the jurisdiction of eighteen appointed Commissioners. Town Commissioners gave way to an Urban District Council in 1894, and then in 1937 the town received its Royal Charter as a municipal borough. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, it was merged into the Woodspring district of the Avon County Council, and became a Charter trustees town. Weston-super-Mare regained its town council in 2000, becoming a civil parish. The island of Steep Holm is part of the civil parish of Weston-super-Mare.

Before 1 April 1974, Weston-super-Mare came under the administration of Somerset County Council. When Avon was split up in 1996, it became the administrative headquarters of the unitary authority of North Somerset, one of the successor authorities, which remains part of the ceremonial county of Somerset.

There are 11 electoral wards in Weston.

The MP for the Weston-super-Mare parliamentary constituency is Dan Aldridge of the Labour Party, who won the seat from John Penrose of the Conservative Party in the 2024 general election.
==Geography==

The mainly flat landscape of Weston is dominated by Worlebury Hill, 109 metres (357 ft), which borders the entire northern edge of the town, and Bleadon Hill, 176 metres (577 ft) which together with the River Axe, and Brean Down at Uphill form its southern border. In the centre of the town is Ellenborough Park a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the range of plant species found there.
The beach of Weston Bay lies on the western edge of the town. The upper part is sandy, but the sea retreats a long way at low tide, exposing large areas of mud flats (hence the colloquial name of Weston-super-Mud). The tidal range in this part of the Bristol Channel is great, and since beach and mud flats are on a gentle slope, it is inadvisable to try to reach the sea at low tide, as the sand gives way to deep mud which has often resulted in loss of life over the years. Driving on the beach is permitted in certain areas, but occasionally the drivers are caught unawares as they drive too close to the sea and break through the sand into the underlying mud, and are then stuck.

The tidal rise and fall in the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel can be as great as , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. This tidal movement contributes to the deposition of natural mud in bays such as Weston. There has been concern about pollution levels from industrial areas in Wales and at the eastern end of the Bristol Channel; however this tends to be diluted by the Atlantic waters. There are measurable levels of chemical pollutants, and little is known about their effects. Of particular concern are the levels of cadmium and to a lesser degree residual pesticides and hydrocarbons.

Just to the north of the town is Sand Point which marks the lower limit of the Severn Estuary and the start of the Bristol Channel. It is also the site of the Middle Hope biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest.

The town&#x27;s suburbs include Ashcombe, Bournville, Coronation, Ebdon, Haywood Village, Hutton, Locking, Locking Parklands, Mead Vale, Milton, Oldmixon, St. Georges, Uphill, West Wick, Worle and Worlebury.

==Climate==
Along with the rest of South West England, Weston has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==Demography==
The population of Weston-super-Mare is 82,418 according to the United Kingdom Census 2021. 17,602 (21%) are aged over 65. 73,147 (89%) were born in the United Kingdom and 77,951 (95%) declare themselves as white.

In 1831 the town&#x27;s population was 1,310. The town had approximately 36,900 households in 2021 but in 1801 there were just 138 while in 1829 there were 250.

==Economy==

Since the 1970s, Weston has suffered a decline in popularity as a holiday destination, as have most British seaside resorts, due to the advent of cheap foreign holidays and the demise of the traditional &quot;works holidays&quot; of heavy and manufacturing industries elsewhere in UK. The town had become a centre of industries such as helicopter production, and maintenance at the GKN Westland factory until its closure in 2002, however the company still retains a design office under the name GKN Aerospace Engineering Services at the Winterstoke Road site. Road transport links were improved with the M5 motorway running close by, and the town now supports light industries and distribution depots, including Lidl&#x27;s distribution centre for its southern based stores, and is also a dormitory town for Bristol. Vutrix, one of the largest semiconductor and video/audio distribution equipment companies in the television broadcasting industry, is based in the town. Two of the town&#x27;s largest employers are the local council and Weston College, which has recently begun to offer university degrees as a secondary campus of Bath Spa University.

===Tourism===
Weston-super-Mare is a tourist destination, with its long sandy beach, Helicopter Museum, Weston Museum, Grand Pier and seasonal Wheel of Weston. A 2009 survey by Visit England placed the Grand Pier in the top ten free attractions in England. However, as of 2014, the pier charges for admission. On the Beach Lawns was a miniature railway operated by steam and diesel locomotives, which closed in 2012. The Paddle Steamer &quot;Waverley&quot; and MV &quot;Balmoral&quot; offer day trips from Knightstone Island to various destinations along the Bristol Channel and Severn estuary.

Since the 1970s the number of visitors staying for several nights in the town has decreased, but the numbers of day visitors has increased. In 1995 there were 4 million visitors but by 2005 this had risen to 5.3 million. In 2007 69% of visitors to the resort were day visitors, compared to 58% in 2005. The 2005 survey showed that day visitors stay in Weston-super-Mare for an average of six hours whilst overnight visitors stay for an average of five nights. The largest percentage of visitors (22%) were from the West Midlands. Weston was found to attract two distinct groups: &quot;grey tourists&quot; over the age of 60 and families with young children.

The Art Deco Tropicana, once a very popular lido on the beach, suffered years of neglect before closing to the public in 2000, and despite a number of attempts to reopen it, permission was given to demolish it in 2012. However, the complex reopened in 2015 and now serves as an events space, primarily hosting a seasonal amusement park and ice rink.

In July 2011, North Somerset Council gave planning approval to the £50 million Leisure Dome, a indoor ski slope to be built on the site of RAF Locking. In 2015 the future of the project was in doubt because of the need for additional funding, and no mention of the LeisureDome proposals appear on the information provided by St. Modwen Properties, the developers about their plans for Locking Parklands as the site is now known. It was planned to include a climbing wall, a vertical wind tunnel for indoor skydiving, indoor surfing, a BMX track, a health and fitness club, and a number of shops and restaurants. The ski slope will be the longest in the United Kingdom.

&#x27;International HeliDays&#x27;, in association with the Helicopter Museum, are staged at the beach lawns over a long weekend around the end of July, when up to 75 helicopters from Europe fly in for a static display. There are frequent Helicopter Air Experience flights from the Museum heliport. There is also an annual display by the Red Arrows.

Weston Bike Nights are motorcycle meetings on the Promenade each Thursday during the summer. They are organised by The Royal British Legion Riders Branch to raise money for the Poppy Appeal.

==Transport==

=== Rail ===

The Bristol and Exeter Railway arrived in Weston-super-Mare on 14 June 1841. This was not the route that serves today&#x27;s Weston-super-Mare railway station, but rather a single-track branch line from , midway between the present day and Uphill junctions, which terminated at a small station in Regent Street close to the High Street. A second larger station was constructed in 1866 to replace this, when planning permission was gained to create a loop station from the main line. After legal action was taken by residents along the proposed new route through issues of planning blight, the station on the current site was constructed in 1881.
Today, the station, which is on a short loop off the Bristol to Exeter line, is situated close to the town centre and less than ten minutes walk from the sea front. It has direct services to London Paddington operated by Great Western Railway, and also trains to stations such as Bristol Temple Meads, , and . CrossCountry services run to Birmingham and the North. The station has two platforms. Other stations are located at and . During the middle of the day they are served by the local trains between Taunton, Bristol and Cardiff, but during the peak periods London trains call at both stations. Weston Milton station is on the single track loop and therefore has only one platform, while Worle is on the main line and has two side platforms. The Weston loop diverges just to the southwest of Worle station, and the junction is therefore known as Worle Junction.

=== Tram ===
The gauge Weston-super-Mare Tramways network opened on 12 May 1902. The main route ran from Birnbeck Pier along the sea front to the Sanatorium (now Royal Sands); a branch line ran to the railway station and on to the tram depot in Locking Road. The fleet originally consisted of 12 double deck cars and 4 open-sided &quot;toast rack&quot; cars. The system was bought out by the competing bus company and closed on 18 April 1937, by which time the fleet comprised 8 double deck and 6 &quot;toast racks&quot;. An earlier proposal for the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Tramway to run along the streets of the town to the sea front had failed to materialise, leaving the line as an ordinary railway (the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway) with a terminus in Ashcombe Road.

=== Road ===
Weston is close to junction 21 of the M5 motorway, to which it is linked by a dual-carriageway relief road built in the 1990s. This replaced Locking Road as the designated A370 route and avoided some of the traffic congestion along that narrower urban road.

=== Bus ===
Most local bus services are provided by First West of England. All services call at stops in the Regent Street and Big Lamp Corner area, including some stops in the adjacent High Street. Some town services and those to Sand Bay, Wells, Burnham-on-Sea and Bristol Airport start from or run via the main railway station. The service to Sand Bay is sometimes operated by an open top bus. National Express operate long-distance coach services, mostly from the coach terminal in Locking Road Car Park which is close to the railway station. Bakers Dolphin previously operated a service to London but this was withdrawn in 2013.

The town had a bus station on the sea front from 1928 until 1987. After nine months of construction a new &quot;bus hub&quot; consisting of a street lined with bus stops was opened in February 2022. It is situated on Alexandra Parade.

The WESTlink on-demand bus serves the town.

=== Air ===
The nearest operational airport to Weston is Bristol Airport, located away at Lulsgate.

==Education==
The Unitary authority of North Somerset, provides support for 78 schools, delivering education to approximately 28,000 pupils.

Secondary education is provided by Broadoak Academy, Priory Community School Academy, Winterstoke Hundred Academy, Worle Community School Academy and Hans Price Academy. The town&#x27;s main further education provider is Weston College, and the town&#x27;s expanding higher education provision is supplied by University Centre Weston.

Nigel Leat, a teacher at Hillside First School, was jailed indefinitely in summer 2011 for paedophile offences that happened over a 14-year period. The school&#x27;s headmaster lost his job in December 2011 due to the incident.

==Culture==

The town contains several arts venues. The Playhouse serves both tourists and the local population. The Winter Gardens on the seafront hosts shows, exhibitions and conferences. The Blakehay Theatre &amp; Community Arts Centre is a small venue housed in a former Baptist church. All Saints Church hosts regular concerts, some of high national standing. This church is also used for recording, especially by the Emerald Ensemble and has featured on BBC TV programme &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;.

The Odeon Cinema was opened in 1935 and is a building in the modernist style designed by Thomas Cecil Howitt. It houses the only Compton theatre pipe organ in an Odeon cinema outside London and is one of only two working theatre organs left in the country still performing in their original location in commercially operating cinemas. This Compton organ was installed in 1935 and is the only one left in the West Country, the next nearest being the Odeon Leicester Square, London. All other models have been either restored and moved elsewhere, or destroyed. Occasional organ concerts continue to be held at the venue. The building has Grade II Listed status. The cinema was sold to Merlin Cinemas in 2023 and renamed Plaza Cinema, Weston-super-Mare.

Weston-super-Mare has a small number of live music venues of note. &quot;The Electric Banana&quot; hosts more established touring rock bands, while the &quot;Brit Bar&quot; and &quot;Legends Bar&quot; attract a wide array of local musicians, as well as artists from further afield. The &quot;T4 on the Beach&quot; concert had been hosted annually since 2006, up until 2012, by Channel 4 youth programme &quot;T4&quot;. Well known bands and singers perform four or fewer of their hits. However, artists would have to organise a lip sync performance (in which the vocals are mimed) in case they were unable to sing live as the event is being produced for live TV broadcast. Each summer the beach is also used as the venue for the Weston-super-Mare Sand Sculpture Festival.

The town was the subject of a song &quot;Sunny Weston-super-Mare&quot; performed by local band The Wurzels. The last scenes of &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;, a James Ivory film of 1993, were shot at locations in the town including the Grand Pier and the Winter Gardens.

The Weston Arts Festival takes place each year during September and October using local venues including the Blakehay Theatre, Playhouse, All Saints, and galleries and offering a wide range of cultural events.

Weston is also the 3rd Carnival in the November West Country Carnival circuit, when a large number of brightly illuminated floats called &quot;carts&quot; parade through the streets.

The town&#x27;s weekly newspaper is &quot;The Weston &amp; Somerset Mercury&quot;, which has been serving the population since 1843. It is now owned by publishing company Archant. There are also two online publications &quot;The Weston Echo&quot;, and &quot;Weston super Mare People&quot;.

Local television news programmes are BBC Points West and ITV News West Country.

Weston Super Television was an on-line community television channel set up in 2011.
Its volunteers make and present studio programmes, including interviews with local councillors, musicians and community leaders, as well as filming local events in and around the town.
The 2011–2013 Sky1 television comedy series &quot;The Café&quot; was co-written by Michelle Terry who was born in the town and the series was filmed in Weston-super-Mare.

In August 2015, the artist Banksy opened the temporary art installation &quot;Dismaland&quot; at the derelict Tropicana venue.

The town is served by county-wide radio stations, BBC Radio Bristol, Heart West and Greatest Hits Radio South West.

In late 2019, a new community radio station WaveWSM was also opened with studios in the centre of the town, bringing local internet radio to the town, with presenters and shows local to Weston as well as shows syndicated in from around the UK. The plan Is for a local breakfast show to start in January 2020.

In 2022, See Monster, a retired gas platform repurposed as an art installation, opened at the Tropicana as part of the national art festival . The installation was purported to be the first of its kind in the world. Its opening was preceded by three drone light shows by SkyMagic.

===Twinning===
Weston has been twinned with Hildesheim in Germany since 1983.

==Landmarks==
The Grand Pier is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the town. It houses funfair style attractions, a go-kart track, cafes, a fudge factory, and a host of arcade games, and underwent a £34 million re-development after a fire in 2008 destroyed the main pavilion. After a harsh winter which delayed progress, the new pier pavilion reopened on 23 October 2010.

Weston&#x27;s first pier, Birnbeck Pier, standing on a small island to the north of the bay is currently closed to the public. The current owners, Manchester-based company Urban Splash purchased the pier in 2006. A competition was held as a means to encourage redevelopment of the site for commercial use. To date, no firm plans are in place, and the future of Birnbeck Pier is uncertain. The pier houses Weston-super-Mare Lifeboat Station.
Knightstone Island housed a theatre, swimming pool and sauna, after having been purchased by the physician Edward Long Fox in 1830 to create a therapeutic spa with range of hot, cold and chemical baths. After years of disrepair and dereliction, the area has been redeveloped by Redrow Homes. During 2006/2007, luxury apartments and commercial outlets have been built on the site. Consideration has been taken due to the listed building status of much of the site. Boat trips from here include the &quot;Waverley&quot; and &quot;Balmoral&quot; and trips to Steep Holm and Flat Holm islands as well as short trips around Weston Bay.
The Tropicana outdoor swimming pool that is located on the southern section of the sea front has not been occupied since 2000. A private developer, Henry Boot, was selected to redevelop the site with a new &quot;Life Station&quot; leisure complex, which was planned to include a six lane, swimming pool, water park, 96-bed hotel, restaurant, eight-screen cinema, 14 retail units, and a 20-lane bowling alley. The redevelopment was beset by delays and controversy. A group of local residents challenged the council over its decision to appoint Henry Boot, asking to put forward their own proposals for the site. In November 2009, the plans were finally abandoned, leaving the future of the site uncertain. In 2010 the council invited submissions from developers for a new, less ambitious, scheme to redevelop the site with a swimming pool at its heart. A decision on a new scheme was expected towards the end of 2010. The local authority announced on 23 August 2011 that it was giving developers six months to propose plans for a smaller development otherwise they will arrange to demolish the Tropicana.
In February 2013, North Somerset Council granted planning permission to a consortium of local businesses who intend to build a new swimming pool complex on the site. The Tropicana is occupied by an amusement park called Funland during summer months, featuring a wild mouse roller coaster and several thrill rides.

The First World War memorial in Grove Park, containing a sculpture by Alfred Drury, was unveiled in 1922, with additions by Walter Cave for the Second World War. It contains the names of 402 men from the area who fell in the First World War. It consists of a winged allegorical figure of Victory holding an olive branch, which stands on an octagonal column. The memorial is a grade II listed building.

==Religious sites==

Most of the town&#x27;s churches and chapels are neo-Gothic 19th century structures. The Medieval village church of St John the Baptist was completely demolished in 1824 to make way for a new and larger place of worship. The Catholic St Joseph&#x27;s Church was built in 1858 by Charles F. Hansom and extended in 1893 by Alexander Scoles.

All Saints Church was built between 1898 and 1902 to a design by George Frederick Bodley and completed by his pupil F. C. Eden in the 14th century style so favoured by Bodley. It is a Grade II* listed building. Holy Trinity Church, designed by H Lloyd and opened in 1861, is also Grade II*.

There is a Greek Orthodox Church of St Andrew the Apostle in Grove Road, Milton. Victoria Methodist Church was built in 1935–36 to replace an earlier church of 1899–1900, which was destroyed by fire in 1934.

==Sport==
Football team Weston-super-Mare A.F.C. play in the National League South at the purpose-built Woodspring Stadium, which opened in August 2004. Weston-super-Mare A.F.C. are the current holders of the 2022-2023 Southern League Premier South.

There are two rugby clubs in the town; Weston-super-Mare RFC, formed in 1875, and Hornets RFC, formed in 1962. Weston play in South West Premier league, whilst Hornets play in the Tribute South West 1 West league. These are national level 5 and level 6 respectively in the English rugby union system.

Somerset County Cricket Club played first class and one-day matches for one week a season on a pitch prepared at Clarence Park, near the sea front. This began in 1914 and continued until the last &quot;festival&quot; in 1996.
Weston-super-Mare Cricket Club play at Devonshire Park Ground.

<text>A water park (also waterpark, water world, or aquapark) is an amusement park that features water play areas such as swimming pools, water slides, splash pads, water playgrounds, and lazy rivers, as well as areas for floating, bathing, swimming, and other barefoot environments. Modern water parks may also be equipped with some type of artificial surfing or bodyboarding environment, such as a wave pool or flowrider.

==History==

Water parks have grown in popularity since their roots of public swimming pools in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The first water park featuring water slides and wave pools was Wet &#x27;n Wild, which opened in Orlando, Florida, in 1977. The United States has the largest and most concentrated water park market, with over 1,000 water parks and dozens of new parks opening each year. Major organizations are the IAAPA (International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions) and WWA (World Waterpark Association), which is the industry trade association.

Water parks which emerge from spas tend to more closely resemble mountain resorts, as they become year-round destinations. For example, Splash Universe Water Park Resort is themed to match the community in which it is located. The theme is intended to enhance the community&#x27;s destination appeal. Therefore, the amusement and leisure-time industry is becoming more concentrated, as winter sports are becoming common themes in summertime water recreation.

A process of concentration can be observed in the hybrid versions of theme-, amusement-, and water parks. Some water parks are more spa-oriented. For example, SchwabenQuellen has no water slides; it has instead many saunas, steam rooms, &quot;adventure showers&quot;, and relaxation-oriented water play areas.

In the 2000s, an effort was made to reduce long waiting lines by introducing conveyor belts to lift passengers or use water jets.

An unusual feature at a water park is ice skating. Deep River Water Park in northwestern Indiana features ice skating, made possible by cooling pipes installed under their massive plaza.

==Indoor water parks==

Some of the first indoor water parks are at Duinrell (The Netherlands, 1984), Nautiland located at Haguenau (France, 1984), the Aqua Mundo at Center Parc De Eemhof located at Zeewolde (The Netherlands, 1980) and (Switzerland, 1977).

In 1986 World Waterpark was open in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada at the West Edmonton Mall. It is in 2016 the largest indoor water park in North America.

Tropical Islands Resort (Germany), with an area of , is in 2016 the largest indoor water park in the world.

With five indoor water parks, Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin has been dubbed the &quot;Water Park Capital of the World&quot;. It showcases several of America&#x27;s largest indoor and outdoor water parks, such as Noah&#x27;s Ark Water Park. Wisconsin Dells is also home to the first indoor water park in the United States, which was debuted in 1994 by the Polynesian Resort Hotel. 

Success in extending the tourist season and turning water park resorts into vacation destinations has resulted in tremendous industry growth. Usually, resort hotels featuring massive indoor water parks have been reserved for overnight guests. Companies like Great Wolf Resorts/Great Wolf Lodge and Kalahari Resorts have branched out from their origin in Wisconsin Dells to open new locations around the country. Mt. Olympus Theme and Water Park (formerly Family Land) is another huge water park in the Dells.

The largest indoor water park in the UK is Sandcastle Water Park in Blackpool, England, which opened in 1986.

There are many water parks in southern Europe where the climate suits a long season. For example, in Portugal&#x27;s Algarve, there are three main parks: Aqualand, Aquashow, and Slide and Splash.

==Water play areas==
Water play areas are similar to water parks and include urban beaches, splash pads, and smaller collections of water slides in many hotels and public swimming pools.

For example, the Chelsea Hotel in Toronto features a four-story water slide called the Corkscrew.

== Safety ==
According to estimates from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, more than 4,200 people annually are sent to emergency rooms from suffering injuries on public waterslides. In July 2015, one drowning and at least three near-drownings were reported at water parks in the United States.

On August 7, 2016, Caleb Schwab, the 10-year-old son of American politician Scott Schwab, was decapitated on the Verrückt water ride at the Schlitterbahn water park in Kansas City, Kansas. Following the fatal incident, Verrückt permanently closed.

<text>Robert Paul Smith (April 16, 1915 – January 30, 1977) was an American author, most famous for his classic evocation of childhood, &quot;Where Did You Go? Out. What Did You Do? Nothing&quot;.

==Biography==
Robert Paul Smith was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Mount Vernon, NY, and graduated from Columbia College in 1936. He worked as a writer for CBS Radio and wrote four novels: &quot;So It Doesn&#x27;t Whistle&quot; (1946) (1941, according to Avon Publishing Co., Inc., reprint edition &quot;... Plus Blood in Their Veins&quot; copyright 1952); &quot;The Journey&quot;, (1943); &quot;Because of My Love&quot; (1946); &quot;The Time and the Place&quot; (1951).

&quot;The Tender Trap&quot;, a play by Smith and &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; creator Max Shulman, opened in 1954 with Robert Preston in the leading role. It was later made into a movie starring Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds. A classic example of the &quot;battle-of-the-sexes&quot; comedy, it revolves around the mutual envy of a bachelor living in New York City and a settled family man living in the New York suburbs.

&quot;Where Did You Go? Out. What Did You Do? Nothing&quot; is a nostalgic evocation of the inner life of childhood. It advocates the value of privacy to children; the importance of unstructured time; the joys of boredom; and the virtues of freedom from adult supervision. He opens by saying &quot;The thing is, I don&#x27;t understand what kids do with themselves any more.&quot; He contrasts the overstructured, overscheduled, oversupervised suburban life of the child in the suburban 1950&#x27;s with reminiscences of his own childhood. He concludes &quot;I guess what I am saying is that people who don&#x27;t have nightmares don&#x27;t have dreams. If you will excuse me, I have an appointment with myself to sit on the front steps and watch some grass growing.&quot;

&quot;Translations from the English&quot; (1958) collects a series of articles originally published in &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; magazine. The first, &quot;Translations from the Children,&quot; may be the earliest known example of the genre of humor that consists of a series of translations from what is said (e.g. &quot;I don&#x27;t know why. He just hit me&quot;) into what is meant (e.g. &quot;He hit his brother.&quot;)

&quot;How to Do Nothing With Nobody All Alone By Yourself&quot; (1958) is a how-to book, illustrated by Robert Paul Smith&#x27;s wife Elinor Goulding Smith. It gives step-by-step directions on how to: play mumbly-peg; build a spool tank; make polly-noses; construct an indoor boomerang, etc. It was republished in 2010 by Tin House Books.

<text>Sanna Laura Voutilainen (born 17 May 1975 in Jyväskylä) is a Finnish pop singer.

==Career==
Voutilainen&#x27;s debut single was called &quot;Muuttanut oot maailmain&quot; but her breakthrough came with the 1993 single &quot;Kerran&quot; which reached the Top Ten of the Finnish charts in January 1994. Also in 1994 the singer&#x27;s debut album &quot;Laura Voutilainen&quot; was released selling in excess of 120,000 units; Voutilainen was consequently honored as Finland&#x27;s top female vocalist with the Emma Award for 1994, an honor she again earned for the year 1996. Voutilainen has released a total of six albums and since 1999 she has hosted a TV show of her own.

Voutilainen participated in the Finnish national preliminary round for Eurovision 2002 with the song &quot;Addicted to You&quot;. With 46 points awarded by the jury and 36% of the public vote &quot;Addicted to You&quot; easily won the right to represent Finland at Eurovision 2002: despite heavy promotion - reportedly the most ever afforded a Finnish Eurovision entrant - and high expectations for its Eurovision placing, &quot;Addicted to You&quot; finished Eurovision 2002 in twentieth place out of a field of twenty-four and failed to reach the Finnish Top Ten, stalling at #11.

In 2007 Voutilainen made a bid to again represent Finland at Eurovision participating in Euroviisut 2007, the Finnish national preliminary for Eurovision 2007. Voutilainen was one of twelve contenders at Euroviisut 2007 each of whom sang two songs in the semi-finals with one of each contender&#x27;s songs being advanced to the final: of Voutilainen&#x27;s two semi-final numbers: &quot;Kosketa Mua&quot; and &quot;Take a Chance&quot;, the last-named advanced to the Euroviisut 2007 final where it placed fourth.

<doc id="330089" wikidata="Q561218" url="?curid=330089" title="Henri Grégoire">
<text>Henri Jean-Baptiste Grégoire (; 4 December 1750 – 28 May 1831), often referred to as the Abbé Grégoire, was a French Catholic priest, constitutional bishop of Blois and a revolutionary leader. He was an ardent slavery abolitionist and supporter of universal suffrage. He was a founding member of the &quot;Bureau des longitudes&quot;, the &quot;Institut de France&quot;, and the &quot;Conservatoire national des arts et métiers&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
Grégoire was born in Vého near Lunéville, France, as the son of a tailor. Educated at the Jesuit college at Nancy, he became &quot;curé&quot; (parish priest) of Emberménil in 1782. In 1783 he was crowned by the Academy of Nancy for his &quot;Eloge de la poésie&quot;, and in 1788 by that of Metz for an &quot;Essai sur la régénération physique et morale des Juifs&quot;.

He was elected in 1789 by the clergy of the bailliage of Nancy to the Estates-General, where he soon made his name as one of the group of clerical and lay deputies of Jansenist or Gallican sympathies who supported the Revolution. He was one of the first of the clergy to join the third estate, and thus contributed notably to the union of the three orders. He presided in the session that lasted sixty-two hours while the Bastille was being attacked, and spoke vehemently against the supposed &quot;enemies of the nation&quot;. He later took a leading role in the abolition of the privileges of the nobility and the Church.

==Career and contributions==

===Constitutional bishop===
Under the new Civil Constitution of the Clergy, to which he was the first priest to take the oath (27 December 1790), Grégoire was elected bishop by two &quot;départements&quot;. He selected that of Loir-et-Cher, but assumed the old title of bishop of Blois, and for ten years (1791–1801) governed his diocese with exemplary zeal. An ardent republican, he strongly supported Collot d&#x27;Herbois&#x27; motion for the abolition of the monarchy in the first session of the National Convention (21 September 1792) with the memorable phrase &quot;Kings are in morality what monsters are in the world of nature.&quot;

On 15 November 1792, he delivered a speech in which he demanded that King Louis XVI be brought to trial, and immediately afterwards was elected president of the Convention, over which he presided in his episcopal street dress. During the trial, being absent with other three colleagues on a mission for the union of Savoy to France, he along with them wrote a letter urging the condemnation of the king, but attempted to save the life of the monarch by proposing that the death penalty should be suspended.

When, on 7 November 1793, Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel, bishop of Paris, was intimidated into resigning his episcopal office at the bar of the Convention, Grégoire, who was temporarily absent, hearing what had happened, faced the indignation of many deputies, refusing to give up either his religion or his office. This display of courage ultimately saved him from the guillotine.

Throughout the Reign of Terror, in spite of attacks in the Convention, in the press, and on placards posted at the street corners, Grégoire appeared in the streets in his episcopal dress and celebrated daily Mass in his house. He was then the first to advocate the reopening of the churches (speech of 21 December 1794).

Grégoire also coined the term vandalism in reference to the destruction of property that occurred during the Revolution, both that which was ordered by the National Convention and that which occurred at the hands of individuals. In a series of three reports issued to the National Convention in 1794, Grégoire advocated for additional protection of art works, architecture, inscriptions, books, and manuscripts. He is credited by scholars, such as Joseph Sax and Stanley Idzerda, as one of the founders of the idea of preservation of cultural objects.

===Annihilating the dialects of France===

The Abbé Grégoire is also known for advocating a unified French national language, and for writing the &quot;Rapport sur la Nécessité et les Moyens d&#x27;anéantir les Patois et d&#x27;universaliser l&#x27;Usage de la Langue française&quot; (Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalise the use of the French language), which he presented on 4 June 1794 to the National Convention.

According to his own research, the vast majority of people in France spoke one of 33 dialects or &quot;patois&quot;, and he argued that French had to be imposed on the population and all other dialects eradicated. Although he was natively raised with knowledge of the Lorrain &quot;patois&quot;, his conclusion came from a common view at the time within Jacobin circles that the linguistic diversity of France had been purposely used by the nobility of France to keep the various linguistic groups of France separated from one another and from the political institutions in which French was primarily spoken. That made Grégoire see the various patois as limiting to the ability of French citizens to practice their individual rights.

However, his work was still influenced by the rising sense of French linguistic superiority that had been started by Bertrand Barère with &quot;Rapport du Comité de salut public sur les idiomes&quot; (1794)&quot;.&quot; He thus classified Corsican and Alsatian as &quot;highly degenerate&quot; (&quot;très-dégénérés&quot;) forms of Italian and German, respectively. In his view, Occitan was decomposed into a variety of syntactically-loose local remnants of the language of troubadours that were mutually unintelligible and should be abandoned in favor of the language of Paris. Thus began a process that was expanded dramatically by the policies of Jules Ferry a century later and led to the declining use of the regional languages in France.

==Advocate of equality==
===Racial equality===
In October 1789, Grégoire took a great interest in abolitionism after he had met Julien Raimond, a free colored planter from Saint-Domingue who was trying to win admission to the Constituent Assembly as the representative of his group. Grégoire published numerous pamphlets and later books on the subject of racial equality.

Grégoire also became an influential member of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks although the group and many others like it were seen as radical at the time. As a member of the National Assembly, Grégoire supported seemingly opposing views, such as the eradication of slavery in France, but also maintained his position as a member of the clergy, which was known for mostly wanting to keep slavery within France and its colonies. It was on Grégoire&#x27;s motion in May 1791 that the Constituent Assembly passed its first law admitting some wealthy free men of color in the French colonies to the same rights as whites.

Later, he was recognized for his work &quot;De la littérature des Nègres&quot;, which aimed to highlight the intellectual ability of black writers. In 1810, the encyclopedia was published in New York City in an English translation by the Irish republican exile in Paris, David Bailie Warden.

===Jewish equality===
Grégoire was considered a friend of the Jews. He argued that in the French society, the supposed degeneracy of Jews was not inherent, but rather a result of their circumstances. He blamed the condition of the Jews on the way they had been treated, their persecution by Christians, and the &quot;ridiculous&quot; teachings of their rabbis, and believed they could be brought into mainstream society and made citizens.

==Political career after 1795==
After the establishment of the Directory in 1795, Grégoire was elected to the Council of Five Hundred. He and his fellow council members opposed the &quot;coup d’état&quot; of 18 Brumaire in which Napoleon seized power. The day after the coup, the Council issued a proclamation warning the coup would cause France to revert to the times before the Revolution.

Under Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s rule, Grégoire became a member of the &quot;Corps Législatif&quot;, then of the Senate (1801). He was a leading voice at the national church councils of 1797 and 1801; but he was strenuously opposed to Napoleon&#x27;s policy of reconciliation with the Holy See, and after the signature of the Concordat he resigned his episcopal see on 8 October 1801. He was one of the minority of five in the Senate who voted against the proclamation of the French Empire, and he opposed the creation of a new French nobility and Napoleon&#x27;s divorce from Joséphine de Beauharnais. Regardless, he was created a Count and officer of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;.

During the later years of Napoleon&#x27;s reign he traveled to England and Germany, but in 1814 he returned to France.

After the restoration of the Bourbons, Grégoire remained influential, though as a revolutionary and a schismatic bishop he was also the object of hatred by royalists. He was expelled from the Institut de France. From this time onward, he lived in semi-retirement, occupying himself in literary pursuits and in correspondence with other intellectual figures of Europe. He was compelled to sell his library to obtain means of support.

In 1814 he published &quot;De la constitution française de l&#x27;an 1814&quot;, in which he commented on the &quot;Charter&quot; from a Liberal point of view, and this work reached its fourth edition in 1819, in which year he was elected to the Lower Chamber by the &quot;département&quot; of Isère. This was considered a potentially harmful episode by the powers of the Quintuple Alliance, and the question was raised of a fresh armed intervention in France under the terms of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. To prevent this, Louis XVIII decided on a modification of the franchise; the Dessolles ministry resigned; and the first act of Count Decazes, the new premier, was to annul the election of Grégoire.

==Death, funeral, and transfer ==
Despite his revolutionary Gallican and liberal views, Grégoire considered himself a devout Catholic. During his 1831 final illness, he confessed to his parish &quot;curé&quot;, a priest of Jansenist sympathies, expressing his desire for the last Sacraments of the Church. Hyacinthe-Louis De Quelen, the uncompromising royalist Archbishop of Paris, would only concede on condition that he retract his oath to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which Grégoire refused to do.

In defiance of the archbishop, the Abbé Baradère gave Grégoire the &quot;viaticum&quot;, while the rite of extreme unction was administered by the Abbé Guillon, an opponent of the Civil Constitution, without consulting the archbishop or the parish &quot;curé&quot;. The attitude of the archbishop caused uproar in Paris, and the government deployed troops to avoid a repetition of the riots in February of that year which had led to the sacking of the church of Saint-Germain l&#x27;Auxerrois and the archbishop&#x27;s palace. Grégoire&#x27;s funeral was held at the church of the Abbaye-aux-Bois. Its clergy absented in obedience to the archbishop&#x27;s orders, and Mass was sung by the Abbé Louis-Charles de Grieu (1755–1836), assisted by two clerics, the catafalque being decorated with the episcopal insignia. The horses were unyoked from the hearse after it set out from the church, and it was pulled by students to the cemetery of Montparnasse, the cortege being followed by a crowd of some 20,000 people.

On 12 December 1989, his ashes were transferred to the Panthéon, the resting place of French notables, in a ceremony at which President François Mitterrand presided. The apostolic nuncio to France, Archbishop Lorenzo Antonetti, and the outspoken Bishop Jacques Gaillot of Évreux attended. The Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, offered a requiem Mass in Grégoire&#x27;s memory the previous day.

<text>Anostostomatidae is a family of insects in the order Orthoptera, widely distributed in the southern hemisphere. It is named Mimnermidae or Henicidae in some taxonomies, and common names include king crickets in Australia and South Africa, and wētā in New Zealand (although not all wētā are in Anostostomatidae). Prominent members include the Parktown prawn of South Africa, and the giant wētā of New Zealand. 

==General characteristics==
Some members of this family can be quite large: Parktown prawn can exceed 6 cm and tree weta can exceed 8 cm in length.

Some Australian and Asian anostostomatids have wings (e.g. &quot;Exogryllacris&quot;, &quot;Gryllotaurus&quot;, &quot;Transaevum&quot;), while most lack wings (e.g. &quot;Anostostoma&quot;, &quot;Hypocophoides&quot;, &quot;Penalva&quot;).

Males of some species have highly modified heads, which they use in male-male conflicts.

The wētā of New Zealand, such as &quot;Hemideina&quot;, are mostly herbivores that feed on leaves, fruit and flowers, but may also scavenge recently killed invertebrates. The ground wētā &quot;Anderus maculifrons&quot; eats a range of forest invertebrates.

The king crickets of Australia include generalised scavengers that consume various dead and decaying matter, specialised feeders (e.g. &quot;Exogryllacris&quot; feeds on fungal fruiting bodies growing on fallen trees) and predators of other invertebrates. There is a record of an Australian king cricket preying on a funnel-web spider.

== Behaviour ==
Anostostomatidae are nocturnal. They generally become active soon after sunset.

Anostostomatidae communicate with sound, both through the air and as ground waves through soil, wood and sand. Adults of both sexes and also nymphs can produce sound. These crickets hear sound using foretibial tympana or other modifications to the tibiae, tarsi and perhaps prothorax.

As one example, &quot;Anostostoma&quot; can stridulate by rubbing its abdomen against its hind legs. The sides of the base of the abdomen have dense patches of short, sharp pegs, and there are similar pegs on the inner surfaces of the hind femurs. Sound is produced by these pegs rubbing together.

Anostostomatidae use various behaviours to defend against predators. Many hide in burrows during the day to avoid diurnal predators. If disturbed by a predator, they may jump away, stridulate, eject putrid-smelling faeces, bite, fly away (done by winged &quot;Exogryllacris&quot; and &quot;Gryllotaurus&quot;) or jump into water (done by &quot;Transaevum&quot; nymphs, which feed on streamsides).

== Life cycle ==
Like other orthopterans, Anostostomatidae go through the three stages of egg, nymph and adult. Life cycles in this family are often long, with egg development taking up to 18 months, nymphal development taking 1–3 years and involving 7-10 instars, and adults living for a year or more. Adult females may brood eggs and young nymphs in isolated chambers.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
At least one Cretaceous fossil of an anostostomatid-like cricket is known from Australia but has not been described. The modern distribution of this family in the southern hemisphere has led to speculation that members of this group owe their distribution to the breakup of the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. This may be the case but evidence for the large scale if not total submergence of continental crust in the New Zealand and New Caledonian region in the Oligocene, indicates the possibility that wētā have arrived in these locations since re-emergence of land. The fact that anostostomatid crickets also occur on some Japanese islands supports this possibility.

===King crickets of South Africa===
The best-known species is the Parktown prawn, not to be confused with the well-known &quot;Koringkrieke&quot; or armoured ground crickets, which never have been in the family Anostostomatidae.

&quot;Henicus monstrosus&quot; is a nocturnal anostostomatid. The males are unusual in their anatomy; their heads are disproportionately large and bear forward-directed prongs. They have extremely long, curved mandibles that are functional, but seem to play no part in the eating process.

===Wētā of New Zealand===

Six genera of New Zealand wētā are part of the family Anostostomatidae:
* Giant wētā (&quot;Deinacrida&quot;)
* Ground wētā (&quot;Hemiandrus&quot; &amp; &quot;Anderus&quot;)
* Northland tusked wētā (&quot;Anisoura&quot;)
* Tree wētā (&quot;Hemideina&quot;)
* Tusked wētā (&quot;Motuweta&quot;)

The cave wētā species belong to a different family, the Rhaphidophoridae.

<text>The orthopteran family Rhaphidophoridae of the suborder Ensifera has a worldwide distribution. Common names for these insects include cave crickets, camel crickets, spider crickets (sometimes shortened to &quot;criders&quot; or &quot;sprickets&quot;), and sand treaders. Those occurring in New Zealand are typically referred to as jumping or cave [[wētā]]. Most are found in forest environments or within caves, animal burrows, cellars, under stones, or in wood or similar environments. All species are flightless and nocturnal, usually with long antennae and legs. More than 500 species of Rhaphidophoridae are described.

The well-known field crickets are from a different superfamily (Grylloidea) and only look vaguely similar, while members of the family Tettigoniidae may look superficially similar in body form.

==Description==

Most cave crickets have very large hind legs with &quot;drumstick-shaped&quot; femora and equally long, thin tibiae, and long, slender antennae. The antennae arise closely and next to each other on the head. They are brownish in color and rather humpbacked in appearance, always wingless, and up to long in body and for the legs. The bodies of early instars may appear translucent.

As their name suggests, cave crickets are commonly found in caves or old mines. Some inhabit other cool, damp environments such as rotten logs, stumps and hollow trees, and under damp leaves, stones, boards, and logs. Occasionally, they prove to be a nuisance in the basements of homes in suburban areas, drains, sewers, wells, and firewood stacks. Some reach into alpine areas and live close to permanent ice, such as the Mount Cook &quot;flea&quot; (&quot;Pharmacus montanus&quot;) and its relatives in New Zealand.

* &quot;Tropidischia&quot; 

An as-yet-unnamed genus was discovered within a cave in Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument, on the Utah/Arizona border, in 2005. Its most distinctive characteristic is that it has functional grasping cerci on its posterior.

==Ecology==
Their distinctive limbs and antennae serve a double purpose. Typically living in a lightless environment, or active at night, they rely heavily on their sense of touch, which is limited by reach. While they have been known to take up residence in the basements of buildings, many cave crickets live out their entire lives deep inside caves. In those habitats, they sometimes face long spans of time with insufficient access to nutrients. Given their limited vision, cave crickets often jump to avoid predation. Those species of Rhaphidophoridae that have been studied are primarily scavengers, eating plant, animal, and fungi material. Although they look intimidating, they are completely harmless.

The group known as &quot;sand treaders&quot; is restricted to sand dunes, and are adapted to live in this environment. They are active only at night, and spend the day burrowed into the sand to minimize water loss. In the large sand dunes of California and Utah, they serve as food for scorpions and at least one specialized bird, LeConte&#x27;s thrasher (&quot;Toxostoma lecontei&quot;). The thrasher roams the dunes looking for the tell-tale debris of the diurnal hiding place and excavates the sand treaders (the range of bird is in the Mojave and Colorado Deserts in the U.S.).

==Interactions with humans==

Cave and camel crickets are of little economic importance except as a nuisance in buildings and homes, especially basements. They are usually &quot;accidental invaders&quot; that wander in from adjacent areas. They may reproduce indoors, and are seen in dark, moist conditions such as a basement, shower, or laundry area, as well as in organic debris (e.g., compost heaps) that serve as food. They are fairly common invaders of homes in Hokkaido and other chilly regions in Japan. They are called &quot;kamado-uma&quot; or colloquially &quot;benjo korogi&quot; (便所コオロギ, literally, &quot;toilet cricket&quot;).

A representation of a female from the &quot;Troglophilus&quot; genus has been found engraved on a bison bone in the Cave of the Trois-Frères, showing that they were likely already present around humans, maybe as pets or pests, in caves inhabited by prehistoric populations in the Magdalenian.

<text>Sandrine François (born December 1980 in Paris) is a French singer who represented France at the 2002 Eurovision Song Contest.

==Biography==
She was discovered singing in a pub and invited to sing on the television show of Mireille Dumas. This appearance led to a record contract, and to her working with producer-writer-arranger Erick Benzi (Jean-Jacques Goldman, Céline Dion).

In 2002 François was invited by French television to represent her country in the Eurovision Song Contest. Rick Allison, Marie-Florence Gros and Patrick Bruel wrote a song for her called &quot;Il faut du temps.&quot; She reached fifth position with 104 points.

Her success led to the production of a solo album entitled &#x27;Et Si Le Monde...&#x27;, boasting 14 tracks in French including &#x27;Il Faut Du Temps&#x27; along with a variety of mid tempo tracks and power ballads, which portray Francois&#x27;s vocal ability.

<doc id="330095" wikidata="Q687704" url="?curid=330095" title="Kernel (set theory)">
<text>In set theory, the kernel of a function formula_1 (or equivalence kernel) may be taken to be either

* the equivalence relation on the function&#x27;s domain that roughly expresses the idea of &quot;equivalent as far as the function formula_1 can tell&quot;, or
* the corresponding partition of the domain.

An unrelated notion is that of the kernel of a non-empty family of sets formula_3 which by definition is the intersection of all its elements:
formula_4 
This definition is used in the theory of filters to classify them as being free or principal. 

==Definition==

For the formal definition, let formula_5 be a function between two sets.
Elements formula_6 are &quot;equivalent&quot; if formula_7 and formula_8 are equal, that is, are the same element of formula_9
The kernel of formula_1 is the equivalence relation thus defined. 

The is 
formula_11
The kernel of formula_12 is also sometimes denoted by formula_13 The kernel of the empty set, formula_14 is typically left undefined. 
A family is called and is said to have if its is not empty. 
A family is said to be if it is not fixed; that is, if its kernel is the empty set.

==Quotients==

Like any equivalence relation, the kernel can be modded out to form a quotient set, and the quotient set is the partition:
formula_15

This quotient set formula_16 is called the &quot;coimage&quot; of the function formula_17 and denoted formula_18 (or a variation).
The coimage is naturally isomorphic (in the set-theoretic sense of a bijection) to the image, formula_19 specifically, the equivalence class of formula_20 in formula_21 (which is an element of formula_18) corresponds to formula_23 in formula_24 (which is an element of formula_25).

==As a subset of the Cartesian product==

Like any binary relation, the kernel of a function may be thought of as a subset of the Cartesian product formula_26
In this guise, the kernel may be denoted formula_27 (or a variation) and may be defined symbolically as
formula_28

The study of the properties of this subset can shed light on formula_29

==Algebraic structures==
If formula_21 and formula_24 are algebraic structures of some fixed type (such as groups, rings, or vector spaces), and if the function formula_5 is a homomorphism, then formula_27 is a congruence relation (that is an equivalence relation that is compatible with the algebraic structure), and the coimage of formula_1 is a quotient of formula_35
The bijection between the coimage and the image of formula_1 is an isomorphism in the algebraic sense; this is the most general form of the first isomorphism theorem. 

==In topology==

If formula_5 is a continuous function between two topological spaces then the topological properties of formula_27 can shed light on the spaces formula_21 and formula_9
For example, if formula_24 is a Hausdorff space then formula_27 must be a closed set.
Conversely, if formula_21 is a Hausdorff space and formula_27 is a closed set, then the coimage of formula_17 if given the quotient space topology, must also be a Hausdorff space. 

A space is compact if and only if the kernel of every family of closed subsets having the finite intersection property (FIP) is non-empty; said differently, a space is compact if and only if every family of closed subsets with F.I.P. is fixed.

<text>Kandalaksha () is a town in Kandalakshsky District of Murmansk Oblast, Russia, located at the head of Kandalaksha Gulf on the White Sea, north of the Arctic Circle. Population: 40,564 (2002 Census); 

== Etymology ==
According to the most common version, the name of the town comes from its location on the shore of Kandalaksha Bay, where &quot;laksa&quot; means &quot;lip&quot; (in Karelian &quot;lakši&quot; — «bay»), Kanda — name of the river that traverses the town. According to other sources, the name of the bay may come from the Sámi names &quot;Kantlukht&quot; (kannҍt — hill, a dry place among a swamp, &quot;лӯххт&quot; — bay) or &quot;Kandaslukht&quot; (ка̄нҍтэсь — pack saddle, &quot;лӯххт&quot; — bay, which means: “the bay where horse packs were reloaded”), or from &quot;Kantaalahti&quot; ( Finnish &quot;kantaa&quot; — to feed, bear fruit and Finnish &quot;lahti&quot; — bay).
==History==
The settlement was founded the 11th century but may have existed as a temporary stop for fishermen from the 9th century. In the 13th century, it became a part of the Novgorod Republic along with the southern part of the Kola Peninsula, and in 1478 was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In 1915, the construction of a seaport started, and in 1918 a railroad connecting Moscow to Murmansk running through Kandalaksha was opened. On August 29, 1927, Kandalaksha was made the administrative center of the newly established Kandalakshsky District, and on June 1, 1932, it was granted work settlement status. Status of a town of district significance was granted to it on April 20, 1938. On February 9, 1940, Kandalaksha was administratively separated from the district and granted the status of a town of oblast significance.

In July 1941, during World War II, the town was the primary target of an unsuccessful German-Finnish offensive which attempted to cut the strategic Kirov Railway.

By the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of March 19, 1959, the Councils of Deputies of Kandalaksha and of Kandalakshsky District were merged into one Kandalaksha Town Council of Deputies. While the district was nominally retained as a separate administrative division, all its subdivisions were administratively subordinated to the town&#x27;s Council of Deputies.

Since 1995, Vitino oil port operates near Beloye More a few kilometers south of Kandalaksha.

Kandalaksha Mayor Nina Varlamova was murdered in an attack in December 2008.
