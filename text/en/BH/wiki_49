<text>Allen R. Davis (July 4, 1929 – October 8, 2011) was an American professional football executive and coach. He was the managing general partner, principal owner and &quot;de facto&quot; general manager of the National Football League (NFL) Oakland Raiders for 39 years, from 1972 until his death in 2011. Prior to becoming principal owner of the Raiders, he served as the team&#x27;s head coach from 1963 to 1965 and part owner from 1966 to 1971, assuming both positions while the Raiders were part of the American Football League (AFL). He served as AFL commissioner in 1966.

Known for his motto &quot;Just win, baby&quot;, Davis managed the Raiders into one of the NFL&#x27;s most successful and popular teams. The franchise enjoyed their greatest successes during the 1970s and 1980s where they were perennial playoff contenders and won three Super Bowl titles. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1992.

Davis was active in civil rights, refusing to allow the Raiders to play in any city where black and white players had to stay in separate hotels. He was the first NFL owner in the modern era to hire a black head coach (Art Shell), the first to hire a female chief executive (Amy Trask), and the first NFL owner to hire a Latino head coach (Tom Flores). He remains the only executive in NFL history to have served as an assistant coach, a head coach, a general manager, a commissioner, and an owner.

== Early life ==
Davis was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, to a Jewish family. Davis&#x27; father, Louis Davis, worked in a variety of trades in Massachusetts; having found some success in the garment manufacturing field, he moved to Brooklyn, New York, in 1934 with his wife, Rose, and their two sons, Jerry and Allen. Louis Davis rented a sixth-floor walkup for his family off Utica Avenue, became very successful in the garment trade, and put his two sons through college before seeking a more comfortable dwelling in Atlantic Beach, New York. Although there are a number of stories of Louis Davis backing his younger son in anything so long as the boy did not get caught or back down from a confrontation, most of these stories derive from Al Davis. Childhood friends depicted him as more of a talker than a fighter, although very good with his mouth. Young Al&#x27;s sport of choice was basketball, and he gained a reputation of a hard player, if not the most skillful. As a boy, he was determined to play for Coach Al Badain at Erasmus Hall High School, passing up the opportunity to attend school closer to his house. Although he was only a reserve on the Erasmus team, and did not play much, Davis studied Badain&#x27;s coaching techniques, and felt he learned much from him. In the 1980s, with Badain ill and in need, Davis brought his elderly former coach to the West Coast to witness his Raiders in the Super Bowl, and paid the man&#x27;s debts.

Despite Davis&#x27;s slight role on his high school team, Raiders media guides later published descriptions of Davis which depicted him as a schoolboy star, only to have the claims scaled back—slightly—in future editions after reporters investigated the matter. His lack of football playing experience (he did play football for his high school fraternity) made him one of the few to be a head coach in the NFL or AFL despite never having played even for the high school varsity.

Davis graduated from high school in January 1947, immediately enrolling at Wittenberg College in Springfield, Ohio at age 17. The school had recruited Davis, although it did not extend him a scholarship. He spent a semester there, occupying himself with baseball and plans to transfer to a higher-profile school. In mid-1947, he transferred to Syracuse University. Although Davis repeatedly tried out for the various varsity teams, the height of his athletic career at Syracuse was warming the bench for the junior varsity baseball team. Frustrated by this, he briefly transferred to Hartwick College, also in New York State, in 1948, but soon returned to Syracuse. Despite Davis&#x27;s lack of athletic success, he commonly mingled with varsity athletes, many of whom assumed he was also one but on another team. Unsuccessful in his efforts to join the men&#x27;s basketball team, Davis became interested in football strategy, and haunted the football team&#x27;s practices until asked to leave by the head coach, suspicious of Davis for taking notes. Davis also took the academic courses in football strategy given by the assistant coaches, and ordinarily attended only by players.

==Early coaching career==
===College coach===
In job hunting, he would introduce himself as &quot;Davis from Syracuse&quot;, likely intentionally to conflate with George Davis, star halfback for the school&#x27;s football team. Turned down at Hofstra University and by Bill Altenberg, athletic director at Adelphi University (both on Long Island), he approached Adelphi&#x27;s president. What went on between the two men is not known; his biographer Mark Ribowsky suggests Davis used a combination of &quot;bluff and con,&quot; but a half hour after Altenberg dismissed Davis from his office, he received a call from the president that he had a new freshman football coach.

===Military service===
In 1952, with his student deferral ended upon receipt of his master&#x27;s degree, Davis was inducted into the United States Army. He quickly secured a place attached to a public relations unit near Syracuse, and set about obtaining a place on one of the coaching staff for the military&#x27;s football teams. General Stanley Scott of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, obtained Davis&#x27;s services in 1953 as football coach for his post&#x27;s football squad. At the time, military football was taken very seriously; the teams were well-stocked with drafted college stars, and often scrimmaged National Football League teams. Davis coached Fort Belvoir, just south of Washington, D.C., to a record of eight wins, two losses, and one tie (8–2–1), missing a chance to play in the Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego because of a final-game loss to the nearby Quantico Marine Base. As a private first class, he was often coaching players of a higher rank, including officers. Near the end of 1952, he was called to testify before a congressional committee investigating whether athletes were being coddled in the military. Although most of Davis&#x27;s team was sent to Korea, he remained at Fort Belvoir until his discharge in 1954. While coaching in the army, Davis sold scouting information about his players to NFL teams. One NFL executive who contacted Davis was Pete Rozelle of the Los Angeles Rams, but as Rozelle had been allocated no money, Davis gave him no information.

===Scouting and return to college coaching===
After his military service, Davis married his fiancée, Carol Sagal, in a Brooklyn synagogue; the couple established a first home in Atlantic Beach, near Al Davis&#x27;s parents. Davis worked for a year as a freelance scout for the Baltimore Colts of the NFL. He had considerable knowledge of the players he had had on his roster or coached against, and advised the Colts which players to offer contracts to or draft as they returned to civilian life. Davis cultivated the Colts&#x27; head coach, Weeb Ewbank, hoping Ewbank&#x27;s connections would lead to a coaching job for Davis, and these efforts paid off in January 1955, when Davis was hired by The Citadel in South Carolina as an assistant to first-year head coach John Sauer. In contrast to the glory won by its alumni in war, the South Carolina military academy&#x27;s football team had lost every game the previous season, and previous head coach John McMillan was dismissed after two seasons. Davis stated, in his interview, that he would be able to persuade small-town boys from the Northeast to attend The Citadel, which often had difficulty in recruiting star players because of its regimented lifestyle. He was successful in his recruiting, although not all remained past the first training camp, at Parris Island Marine base.

During games, Davis was stationed in the press box, calling plays which were generally run by Sauer without modification. The Citadel unexpectedly began the season by winning five of its first six games, although it lost the next three to end the season 5–4. Davis received much credit for his role in The Citadel&#x27;s success, although losing Sauer&#x27;s regard through too-aggressive self-promotion. The 1956 season was less successful, as the team finished 3–5–1. Sauer resigned at the end of the season; Davis unsuccessfully sought the head coaching position and then resigned; Ribowsky records that there were allegations of payments and other benefits to players in violation of NCAA rules; he also states that Davis pressured professors to change grades to keep student-athletes eligible to play football. By the time he left The Citadel, Davis had already arranged his next job, at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles.

Davis was an effective recruiter as a USC assistant coach, bringing one prospect, Angelo Coia to the Los Angeles Coliseum at night, and as the lights were slowly turned off, asked the student to imagine himself playing there before 100,000 people. Coia played for USC and later worked for the Raider front office. When Davis arrived, USC was on NCAA probation for allowing alumni to surreptitiously give money to players, and had not been permitted to play in a bowl game after the 1956 season; these sanctions hampered Davis&#x27;s first two seasons at USC, 1957 and 1958, during which the team posted a combined 5-14-1 record. The head coach, Don Clark, came to rely heavily on Davis. Clark and Davis hoped that 1959 would bring a conference championship and the chance to play in the Rose Bowl, but in April 1959 USC was sanctioned by the NCAA again, this time for inducing recruits signed by other schools into breaking their letters of intent. Not allowed to play on television, USC won its first eight games before losing to UCLA and Notre Dame. Despite the defeats, the team was Pacific Coast Conference champions, but because of the sanctions could not play in the Rose Bowl. Clark resigned after the season; although Davis put in for the position, it went to another assistant, John McKay, who did not keep Davis on his staff.

===Chargers assistant===
Davis had met Los Angeles Rams coach Sid Gillman in Atlantic City at a coaching clinic; the NFL coach had been impressed that Davis had sat in the front row, taken copious notes, and had asked many questions afterwards. Gillman was fired after the 1959 season, but was quickly hired by the Los Angeles Chargers of the startup American Football League (AFL) for their debut 1960 season. He hired Davis as backfield coach on a coaching staff which included future hall of famer Chuck Noll as well as future AFL head coach and NFL general manager Jack Faulkner. Gillman later stated that he hired Davis for his success both as a coach and as a recruiter, and because &quot;Al had that knack of telling people what they wanted to hear. He was very persuasive.&quot;

The AFL&#x27;s rules were crafted to encourage wide-open, high-scoring football. In later years, much to Gillman&#x27;s anger, Davis hinted that he had designed the Chargers&#x27; offense, or at least deserved partial credit. The team initially proved successful, winning the AFL Western Division in 1960 and 1961, although losing each time in the AFL Championship Game to the Houston Oilers.

One player whom Davis recommended to the Chargers, and then secured, was wide receiver Lance Alworth of Arkansas, who was a first-round selection of NFL San Francisco 49ers in the 1962 NFL draft. Unwilling to give the 49ers a chance to sign him, Davis raced onto the field at the conclusion of Alworth&#x27;s final college game and signed him to a contract under the goalpost as 49ers head coach Red Hickey watched helplessly from the stands. Davis later stated, &quot;I knew it wasn&#x27;t safe to let Alworth go to the dressing room.&quot; In 1978, Davis was selected by Alworth to introduce him at his induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.

== First stint with the Raiders (1963–1965)==
=== Background and hiring ===
Early in the 1962 season, Davis spoke with Oakland Raiders owner F. Wayne Valley about their head coaching job. However, Davis was not then interested. After the team&#x27;s disastrous 1962 season, in which it lost its first 13 games before defeating a Boston Patriots team demoralized from having just been eliminated from playoff contention, Valley sought to replace head coach Red Conkright.

A number of names were rumored to be in contention for the Raiders head coaching job, from Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi to Lou Agase, former coach of the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts. On January 1, 1963, Davis met with Valley and the other Raiders general partner, Ed McGah. According to witnesses present at the negotiations, Davis did not have a high opinion of Valley and McGah, indicating during their absence that they did not know the right questions to ask. They offered him a one-year contract as head coach. He declined, insisting on a multi-year deal as both head coach and general manager, with complete control over football operations, to which they eventually agreed and settled on a three-year stint at an annual salary of $20,000. According to Davis biographer Ira Simmons, the date that Davis came to Oakland, January 18, 1963, &quot;was probably one of the three or four most important dates in AFL history. Maybe NFL history too.&quot; Valley later stated, &quot;we needed someone who wanted to win so badly, he would do anything. Everywhere I went, people told me what a son of a bitch Al Davis was, so I figured he must be doing something right.&quot;

The Raiders team had been a late addition to the original AFL in 1960; the franchise had been awarded when the owners of the AFL Minnesota team had been induced to join the NFL instead. While it inherited the departed Minnesota team&#x27;s draft picks, it had little else. The franchise, originally nicknamed the Señors (changed to Raiders after columnists raised objections) was not established until the other AFL teams had had the opportunity to sign players and coaches, a handicap which contributed to it being the only team to post a losing record in each of the AFL&#x27;s first three seasons. The University of California refused to let it play at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, and no other facility in the East Bay was suitable even for temporary use, forcing it to play its first two seasons at Kezar Stadium and Candlestick Park, both located across the bay in San Francisco.

Valley and his group purchased the Raiders in 1961. Valley and his partners used the threat of leaving to induce city officials to construct Frank Youell Field, a temporary facility in downtown Oakland next to the Nimitz Freeway which held about 15,000 people, the use of which was shared with high schools. Planning for a larger stadium — what became the Oakland Coliseum — began, but there was no guarantee that it would ever be built. 

=== Youngest coach in the AFL ===
Davis immediately began to try to build the Raiders into a championship team, both on the field and in the front office. Many Raiders players and front-office employees were dismissed. Since their first season, the Raiders had used hand-me-down black and gold uniforms from the University of the Pacific in Stockton. Davis had been impressed by the black uniforms of the football players at West Point, which he felt made them look larger. Soon after he arrived, the Raiders adopted their now-iconic silver and black motif. The Raiders&#x27; offices were on an open mezzanine overlooking a downtown Oakland hotel lobby; Davis got Valley to move them to more private facilities. With no agreement between the AFL and NFL, drafted players often went to the higher bidder. Davis could not hope to outbid the NFL and drafted players with remaining college eligibility, hoping to sign them once they finished their careers. Thus, his hopes of success for 1963 rested on what trades he could make, and in signing players cut by other teams.

Davis&#x27;s methods of acquiring these players caused other teams&#x27; executives to regard him with respect and caution. He acquired All-AFL guard Bob Mischak from the New York Jets for Dan Ficca without telling Jets coach/general manager Weeb Ewbank that Ficca would not be released from his military service until after the season began. Wide receiver Art Powell had played out his contract with New York and become a free agent, and had apparently been signed by the Buffalo Bills. Davis learned that the Powell contract had been made before the season ended, and thus constituted tampering. He signed Powell himself, and the Bills did not contest it.

Gillman&#x27;s Chargers teams had used high-powered offenses. Davis sought to increase their power. From the opening of training camp, he sought to motivate his players, using techniques he had learned in the military. From the start, players saw phrases like &quot;commitment to excellence&quot; and, on schedules next to the time of games, &quot;We go to war!&quot; In the season opener, at Houston&#x27;s Jeppesen Stadium against the Oilers, the two-touchdown underdog Raiders won, 24–13, then came home to defeat the Bills 35–17. A home loss to the Patriots was next, followed by an East Coast road trip on which the Raiders lost all three games. To growing excitement in Oakland, the Raiders did not lose the rest of the season, finishing 10–4, a game behind the division champion Chargers, whom the Raiders defeated twice. Davis was voted AFL Coach of the Year. The 1963 Oakland Raiders were the only pro football team to improve its record by nine victories under the 14-game schedule.

Although the team slipped to 5–7–2 in 1964, it rebounded to an 8–5–1 record in 1965.

== AFL commissioner (1966) ==

By the end of its sixth season in 1965, the American Football League had overcome its initial status of bare-bones survivor to become a significant rival to the NFL. With a television contract with NBC and major stadiums constructed or being built, the AFL could afford to compete on equal terms for players with the NFL. Not all AFL owners sought a merger — Jets owner Sonny Werblin, for example, felt that with brand-new Shea Stadium and the young star Joe Namath at quarterback, his team could compete on equal terms with the crosstown NFL Giants. However, most AFL owners wanted to be a part of the older, better-established NFL, whose owners feared continued escalation of player salaries.

While the AFL owners liked the league&#x27;s first commissioner, Joe Foss, they had little confidence in his abilities at a time for struggle between the two leagues, and Foss resigned on April 7, 1966. Davis, 36, was voted in as commissioner the following day, and took the job with Valley&#x27;s agreement, hired as a fighter who would win the war with the NFL. The owners, led by Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, felt that Davis could put pressure on the NFL and force a favorable settlement. His biographer, Glenn Dickey, notes that Davis was deceived by the owners, &quot;He thought he had been hired to win the war with the NFL. In fact, the owners only wanted to force a peace. They were quietly negotiating a merger while Davis was fighting a war.&quot;

According to sportswriter Ken Rappoport in his history of the AFL, &quot;Davis had a plan, and, considering the football genius the man would become, no one should have been surprised that it would work—brilliantly.&quot; Davis&#x27;s target in the war was the NFL&#x27;s quarterbacks, arranging for AFL teams to sign star players, such as Roman Gabriel of the Rams, who would be free agents after 1966 although that season had not yet begun. Gabriel, with his AFL contract to begin in 1967, received an immediate $100,000 bonus. The signing of 49ers quarterback John Brodie was announced by Davis and the AFL. These transactions increased the financial pressure on the NFL&#x27;s weaker franchises, which faced the prospect of losing their best players in a year, or greatly increasing their labor costs. A merger agreement was announced on June 8 and Davis was greatly displeased with the agreement on two fronts. It required the Jets and Raiders to pay indemnities to the Giants and 49ers for establishing teams within their exclusive territories, and it also put him out of a job: the merger agreement immediately abolished the post of AFL commissioner. Pete Rozelle would continue in his post as NFL commissioner under the merger agreement. Davis had hoped to be named commissioner if any merger was reached; the result increased what already had become a dislike of Rozelle.

Davis resigned as commissioner on July 25, 1966. AFL owners wanted Davis to continue serving as AFL &quot;President.&quot; AFL owners had explicitly agreed that the office of AFL President would be subservient to that of the NFL Commissioner, and Davis flatly refused to consider serving as a subordinate to Rozelle. Eventually, Milt Woodard (who was assistant commissioner under Foss) agreed to serve as President of the AFL.

== Back with the Raiders (1966–2011) ==
After resigning as AFL commissioner, Davis formed a holding company, A.D. Football, Inc., and returned to the Oakland Raiders as one of three general partners, along with Wayne Valley and Ed McGah. He was also named head of football operations. Although he only owned a 10% stake in the team, Davis was now operating head of the franchise, and would remain so for the next 45 years; Valley and McGah largely left the Raiders in Davis&#x27; hands.

In 1972, while managing general partner Valley was attending the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Davis drafted a revised partnership agreement that made him the new managing general partner, with near-absolute control over team operations. McGah signed the agreement. Since two of the team&#x27;s three general partners had voted in favor of the agreement, it was binding under California partnership law at the time. Valley sued to overturn the agreement once he returned to the country but was unsuccessful. Valley sold his interest in 1976 and from that point none of the other partners played any role in the team&#x27;s operations, despite the fact that Davis did not acquire a majority interest in the Raiders until 2005, when he bought the shares held by McGah&#x27;s family (McGah died in 1983). At the time of his death, Davis owned about 67% of the team.

In addition to serving as owner, Davis effectively served as his own general manager until his death — longer than any football operations chief in the league at the time. When he died, he was one of three NFL owners who had the title or powers of general manager, the others being Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys and Mike Brown of the Cincinnati Bengals. Davis was long recognized as one of the most hands-on owners in professional sports and reportedly had more authority over day-to-day operations than any other owner in the league.

Davis was known throughout the league as a maverick and dressed the part. By the time he took complete control of the Raiders, he had assumed his classic image—slicked-back hair in a 1950s-style ducktail, dark sunglasses, white tracksuits and Brooklyn-tinged speech (&quot;the Raiduhs&quot;). The Raiders&#x27; bully image of the 1970s and 1980s are attributed directly to Davis, who has often said he&#x27;d rather be feared than respected. Slogans such as &quot;Just Win, Baby,&quot; &quot;Pride and Poise,&quot; and &quot;Commitment to Excellence&quot; are Davis trademarks. &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid of failure,&quot; said Davis. &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about mistakes. Just win.&quot;

Although he became successful on the business side of football, Davis didn&#x27;t lose touch with game strategy and talent evaluation. He has boasted that he can watch somebody for 10 seconds and tell if he&#x27;s a player. &quot;I don&#x27;t think the idea is to be totally human,&quot; Davis said. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to look like the other owners. It&#x27;s establishment. I&#x27;ve always been closer to the players.&quot; &quot;If horse racing were Al&#x27;s business, he would love those yearling auctions where they walk each horse out for everybody to see them,&quot; former Raiders coach John Madden wrote in his autobiography. &quot;Al would pick more stakes winners than anybody else. Al might even find a way to talk to the horse.&quot;

With Davis in control, the Raiders became one of the most successful teams in all of professional sports. From 1967 to 1985, the team won one AFL championship (1967), three Super Bowls: 1976 (XI), 1980 (XV), and 1983 (XVIII), and made 15 playoff appearances (including 11 AFL / AFC Championship Game appearances). Although the Raiders later fell on harder times, going 37–91 from 2003 to 2010, they are one of only five teams to play in the Super Bowl in four different decades, the others being the Pittsburgh Steelers, New England Patriots, New York Giants and Denver Broncos.

In 1992, Davis was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a Team and League Administrator and was presented by John Madden. Davis was chosen by a record nine Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees to present them at the Canton, Ohio ceremony: Lance Alworth, Jim Otto, George Blanda, Willie Brown, Gene Upshaw, Fred Biletnikoff, Art Shell, Ted Hendricks and Madden.

In 2007, Davis sold a minority stake in the Raiders for $150 million and said that he would not retire until he won two more Super Bowls or died.

Davis&#x27; generosity was legendary when it came to helping former players in need, although he routinely did so without fanfare. His philosophy was: once a Raider, always a Raider.

=== Legal battles ===
Davis was long considered one of the most controversial owners in the NFL and was involved in multiple lawsuits involving Los Angeles, Oakland, Irwindale and the National Football League. 

Davis failed in his efforts to get luxury suites added to Oakland-Alameda Coliseum in 1980 and, despite 12 straight seasons of sellouts, announced plans to move the team to Los Angeles but was blocked by a court injunction. In response, Davis filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL. In June 1982, a federal district court ruled in Davis&#x27; favor, which included $35 million in damages (he settled for $18 million), and the team relocated to Los Angeles for the 1982 NFL season. When the upstart United States Football League filed its antitrust suit in 1986, Davis was the only NFL owner who sided with the USFL.

In 1995, after being unable to secure a new stadium in the Los Angeles area and when a proposed move to Sacramento that involved Davis taking ownership of the Sacramento Kings fell apart, Davis moved the team back to Oakland then sued the NFL, claiming the league sabotaged the team&#x27;s effort to build a stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood by not doing enough to help the team move from the antiquated Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to a new stadium complete with luxury suites. The NFL won a verdict in 2001, but Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Richard Hubbell ordered a new trial amid accusations that one juror was biased against the team and Davis and that another juror committed misconduct. A state appeals court later overturned that decision. The case was thrown out in 2007 when the Supreme Court of California unanimously ruled that the verdict against the Raiders stood. This was the last of several lawsuits the Raiders had outstanding against the league and its stadium landlords.

In the mid-1990s, Davis sued the NFL on behalf of the Raiders, claiming the Raiders had exclusive rights to the Los Angeles market, even though the Raiders were in Oakland. Davis and the Raiders lost the lawsuit.

In 2007, NFL Films chose the feud between Davis and the NFL/Pete Rozelle as their No. 1 greatest feud in NFL history on the NFL Network&#x27;s Top Ten Feuds, citing almost a half-century of animosity between Davis and the league. Some believe that the root of Davis&#x27; animosity towards the NFL and his former co-owners in the AFL was the surreptitious way they pushed the AFL-NFL merger behind his back.

The feud was most recently chronicled in &quot;Al Davis vs. the NFL&quot;, a documentary on the feud between Davis and Rozelle first broadcast by ESPN on February 4, 2021, as part of its &quot;30 for 30&quot; series. The film&#x27;s narrative structure uses reconstructions of Davis and Rozelle to &quot;tell&quot; its story, using deepfake technology and extensive content from the NFL Films archives.

=== Trading Stabler ===
In the 1980 offseason, star quarterback Ken Stabler attempted to renegotiate his contract with the Raiders. A veteran “gunslinger”, Stabler had won the Raiders&#x27; only title until then and had been a mainstay since his 1968 signing with the team as a protégé of Lamonica. Davis angered much of the Raider community by dealing him to the Oilers for quarterback Dan Pastorini, a trade many regarded as selfishly seeking revenge while strengthening the team&#x27;s top AFC rival. Pastorini was injured in week 5, and the starting role fell to his backup, Jim Plunkett. The former Heisman Trophy-winning but little-achieved professional led the Raiders to a victory in Super Bowl XV.

=== Marcus Allen benching ===
Marcus Allen, the MVP in the Raiders&#x27; Super Bowl XVIII victory, was ordered benched by Davis for two years following a contract dispute. Davis only commented, &quot;He was a cancer on the team.&quot; Allen said that Davis &quot;told me he was going to get me.&quot; He added that &quot;I think he&#x27;s tried to ruin the later part of my career. He&#x27;s trying to stop me from going to the Hall of Fame. They don&#x27;t want me to play.&quot; Davis called Allen&#x27;s charges &quot;fraudulent&quot;, and then-Raiders coach Art Shell said only he decided who plays. The Raiders released Allen in 1992.

=== Davis deals Gruden ===
On February 18, 2002, Davis dealt his head coach Jon Gruden to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for Tampa Bay&#x27;s 2002 and 2003 first-round draft picks, 2002 and 2004 second-round draft picks, and $8 million in cash. His replacement, Bill Callahan, led Oakland to an 11–5 record and their third consecutive division championship. The Raiders reached Super Bowl XXXVII, where they faced Gruden, who led Tampa Bay to its first Super Bowl berth. The Buccaneers won in a 48–21 blowout, in a matchup that was termed the &quot;Gruden Bowl&quot;. Seventeen years later, Gruden returned to the Raiders as head coach in 2018 after seven years with the Buccaneers and nine years with ESPN, although he resigned in 2021 as a result of emails leaked of Gruden making misogynistic, homophobic, and racist comments.

=== Losing years ===
Although it was not apparent at the time, the Raiders&#x27; loss in the Super Bowl would be Davis&#x27; last hurrah. The Raiders would start to struggle and suffer seven consecutive losing seasons from 2003 to 2009, the longest drought in franchise history. This included double-digit loss record seasons in seven consecutive years from 2003 to 2009. The team cycled through multiple head coaches. Their 2007 first overall draft pick, quarterback JaMarcus Russell, was called &quot;the biggest draft flop in NFL history&quot; by FoxSports.com. Davis was largely blamed, and his motto of &quot;Just win, baby!&quot; was mocked by many. Russell was released by the Raiders in May 2010 and never played another down in the NFL.

The 2011 Raiders&#x27; record was 2–2 at Davis&#x27; death. The day after his death, the Raiders defeated the Houston Texans 25–20 on a final play interception by safety Michael Huff in the end zone. The Raiders finished the season with a record of 8–8 and missed the playoffs, after starting the season 7–4.

=== Civil rights and diversity ===
Davis breached several civil rights and diversity barriers during his career with the Raiders. In 1963, the Raiders were scheduled to play a preseason game in Mobile, Alabama. In protest of Alabama&#x27;s segregation laws, Davis refused to allow the game to be played there and demanded the game be moved to Oakland. He also refused to allow the players to travel to cities to play games where the black and white players would have to stay in separate hotels.

Davis was the first NFL owner to hire an African American head coach, Art Shell, and a female chief executive, Amy Trask. He also hired Tom Flores, the first Latino head coach in the league.

==Head coaching record==
== Death ==
Davis died, aged 82, in his suite at the Hilton Hotel Oakland Airport at 2:45 a.m. PDT on October 8, 2011, in Oakland, California. Nine days later, a private service and funeral was held for Davis, who was interred at Chapel of the Chimes. In the days following the funeral, The Associated Press obtained information pertaining to Davis&#x27; death. The death certificate, issued by Alameda County, disclosed Davis had died from &quot;an abnormal heart rhythm, congestive heart failure and a heart muscle disease&quot;. Davis had previously undergone heart surgery in 1996. Davis was also afflicted with Merkel-cell carcinoma, a rare skin cancer, and had undergone throat surgery in the days preceding his death.

There was an outpouring of support and grief in the wake of Davis&#x27; death. John Madden, who had remained close to Davis since their first meeting in 1966, lamented, &quot;You don&#x27;t replace a guy like that. No way. No damn way. You look at the things he&#x27;s done that no one ever did before, being a scout, assistant coach, head coach, general manager, commissioner and owner.&quot; The Sunday following his death, the Oakland Raiders adorned their helmets with a sticker which read &quot;Al&quot; in Davis&#x27; memory. A league-wide moment of silence was also observed. Despite the widespread remembrance of his accomplishments, Davis&#x27; position as a controversial figure lives on as part of his legacy. Sportswriter Rick Reilly was particularly adamant that the questionable personnel decisions Davis made later in his career and his arrogant, brash personality should not be forgotten amidst sportswriters&#x27; praise of him as an innovative owner.

Davis was survived by his wife, Carol, and their only child, Mark, a graduate of California State University, Chico. Mark assumed his father&#x27;s old title of managing general partner of the Raiders and with his mother owns the majority of the team. Both Mark and Carol represent the Raiders in owners&#x27; meetings. Carol suffered a serious heart attack in 1979 and was hospitalized for three weeks but was able to make a complete recovery.

Al Davis&#x27; mother Rose had lived to age 103. She died in 2001, having outlived her husband Lou by 40 years.

=== The &quot;11th man&quot; ===
The day after Davis&#x27; death, the Raiders played the Houston Texans. Oakland was leading the game, 25–20, late in the fourth quarter. On the final play of the game, Raider free safety Michael Huff intercepted Texan quarterback Matt Schaub in the end zone to preserve the victory. The Raiders had only 10 defensive players on the field for the play. The play was referred to as the &quot;Divine Interception&quot; with media speculating that Davis was the 11th player on the field in spirit. Raiders coach Hue Jackson said Al Davis &quot;had his hand on that ball.&quot; Jackson was highly emotional in victory, as well as Davis&#x27;s son Mark Davis. Jackson said, &quot;One thing coach [Davis] always taught me was he said: &#x27;Hue, don&#x27;t believe in plays. Believe in players and eventually the players will make plays for you.&#x27; And that&#x27;s what I did. I could just hear him saying that to me the whole time. Believe in your players and not the plays.&quot; &quot;We know he&#x27;s looking down on us right now,&quot; Hue said. &quot;This win is for him. I appreciate everything he&#x27;s done for this organization. He&#x27;s never gone in our eyes. We&#x27;ll never let him go. He&#x27;s with us.&quot;

==Al Davis Memorial Torch==
After Davis&#x27; death, Mark Davis and the Raiders created the Al Davis Memorial Torch.

There are currently two such torches: the original torch is a gas-operated torch that was brought out on game days at the Oakland Coliseum, and was lit by a former Raiders player or coach prior to each Raider home game. That individual would then also sign the back or one of the side panels of the torch.

When the team relocated to Las Vegas in 2020, the torch from the Coliseum was moved to and placed in front of the team&#x27;s new headquarters in Henderson, Nevada, with the player-signed side and back panels being put on display at Allegiant Stadium, where an tall torch (that rises above the main concourse) was built. The Allegiant Stadium Al Davis Memorial Torch is the largest 3D printed object in the world.

==Accolades==
In 2003, Davis was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

<doc id="330178" wikidata="Q158778" url="?curid=330178" title="Louis-Nicolas Davout">
<text>Louis-Nicolas d&#x27;Avout (; 10 May 1770 – 1 June 1823), better known as Davout, 1st Prince of Eckmühl, 1st Duke of Auerstaedt, was a French military commander and Marshal of the Empire who served during both the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. His talent for war, along with his reputation as a stern disciplinarian, earned him the nickname &quot;The Iron Marshal&quot; (&quot;Le Maréchal de fer&quot;). He is ranked along with Marshals André Masséna and Jean Lannes as one of Napoleon&#x27;s finest commanders. His loyalty and obedience to Napoleon were absolute. During his lifetime, Davout&#x27;s name was commonly spelled Davoust - this spelling appears on the Arc de Triomphe and in much of the correspondence between Napoleon and his generals.

==Early life==
Davout was born in the small village of Annoux, Yonne, as the eldest son of Jean-François d&#x27;Avout (1739–1779), a cavalry officer and his wife (married in 1768) Françoise-Adélaïde Minard de Velars (1741–1810). Although a member of an impoverished minor French noble family, he was still educated in the nearby Brienne-le-Chateau, which had a military academy also attended by Napoleon, before also transferring to the &quot;École Militaire&quot; in Paris on 29 September 1785. He graduated on 19 February 1788 and was appointed a &quot;sous-lieutenant&quot; in the Royal-Champagne Cavalry Regiment in garrison at Hesdin (Pas-de-Calais).

==French Revolutionary Wars==
On the outbreak of the French Revolution, Davout embraced its principles. He was &quot;chef de bataillon&quot; in a volunteer corps in the campaign of 1792, and distinguished himself at the Battle of Neerwinden the following spring. He had just been promoted to general of brigade when he was removed from the active list because of his noble birth. After he divorced his wife in 1794 he served in the Rhine campaign of 1796, and accompanied General Louis Desaix in the Egyptian expedition of Napoleon Bonaparte.

On his return, he did not take part in the Battle of Marengo, where his friend Desaix was killed while making a decisive contribution to the victory. Napoleon, who had great confidence in his abilities, finally promoted him to general of division and arranged his marriage to his sister Pauline&#x27;s sister-in-law Aimée Leclerc, thus making him part of Napoleon&#x27;s extended family, and gave him a command in the grenadiers of the Consular Guard.

==Napoleonic Wars==

At the ascension of Napoleon as emperor in 1804, Davout was named as one of the original 18 Marshals of the Empire. Davout was the youngest and least experienced of the generals promoted to marshal, which earned him the hostility of other generals throughout his career. On 18 June 1805 he was present at the Battle of Blanc-Nez and Gris-Nez after joining a Batavian flotilla, headed for Boulogne, as an observer. 

As commander of the III Corps of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, Davout rendered his greatest services. At the Battle of Austerlitz, following a forced march of 48 hours to fall on the left flank of the Russian army, the III Corps bore the brunt of the allies&#x27; attack. In the subsequent War of the Fourth Coalition, Davout, with a single corps, with the intention to fall on the Prussian left wing, fought and won the Battle of Auerstädt against the main Prussian Army, under the Duke of Brunswick, which had more than twice as many soldiers at its disposal (more than 63,000, to Davout&#x27;s 28,000). His actions in this battle earned him the nickname &#x27;Iron Marshal&#x27;. Napoleon after hearing reports about the alleged battle would mock Davout, telling his aide-de-camp “your Marshal must’ve been seeing double”, mocking Davout’s spectacle wearing. Historian François-Guy Hourtoulle writes: &quot;At Jena, Napoleon won a battle he could not lose. At Auerstädt, Davout won a battle he could not win&quot;. As a reward, Napoleon let Davout and his men enter Berlin first on 25 October 1806.

Davout added to his renown in the battles of Eylau and Friedland. Napoleon left him as governor-general of the newly created Duchy of Warsaw following the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807, and the next year awarded him with the title of Duke of Auerstädt. During the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809, Davout took part in the Battle of Eckmühl, and also distinguished himself in the Battle of Wagram, where he commanded the right wing. He was later made Prince of Eckmühl following the campaign. In 1810 Davout travelled to Compiègne with Napoleon to collect the 18-year-old bride Marie-Louise of Austria. 

In 1810 he was sent to Hamburg when Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte left for Sweden; Davout was entrusted by Napoleon with the task of organizing the &quot;corps of observation of the Elbe&quot;, which would become the gigantic army with which Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812. In this, he commanded the I Corps, the strongest corps, numbering over 70,000. On 1 July he left Vilnius. On the order of Napoleon Davout secretly took over the command of Jérôme Bonaparte, occupied Minsk but had lost a third of his men due to sickness and desertion. Davout went very far in humiliating the 33rd regiment, which was no exception. He defeated the Russians at Mohilev before he joined the main army at Smolensk, with which he continued throughout the campaign. During the retreat from Moscow he conducted the rear guard, which was deemed too slow by the emperor, and was replaced by Marshal Michel Ney in the Battle of Vyazma. His inability to hold out against Mikhail Miloradovich in the Battle of Krasnoi, threatened his forces with destruction, until the arrival of the Old Guard led by Édouard Mortier. Davout managed to successfully cross the Losvinka brook, albeit at the cost of his rearguard&#x27;s sacrifice. Davout&#x27;s jammed carriages, fell into the hands of the Cossacks. Among the booty captured by the Russians were Davout&#x27;s war chest, a plethora of maps of the Middle East, Central Asia and India, and Davout&#x27;s Marshal baton. The loss of his baton led him into disgrace and he would not meet with the emperor again until his return from Elba.

In April 1813, on his return from Russia with 4,000, the remains of 70,000 men, Davout commanded the military district of Hamburg and Dirk van Hogendorp left. (The French had initially been driven out by the Russians in March 1813.) He defended the poorly fortified and provisioned city, through the long Siege of Hamburg, only surrendering on direct order by King Louis XVIII, who had come to the throne after Napoleon&#x27;s abdication in April 1814. The French restored their authority with many reprisals among the population. During the siege, he expelled up to 25,000 of Hamburg&#x27;s poorest citizens out of the city into the cold winter, many of whom perished of cold and starvation. Between 1806 and 1814, when the French occupation came to an end by Davout&#x27;s surrender, the population decreased by nearly one-half, to 55,000. 
 
Davout&#x27;s military character has been interpreted as cruel and he had to defend himself against many attacks upon his conduct at Hamburg. He was a stern disciplinarian, who exacted rigid and precise obedience from his troops, and consequently his corps was more trustworthy and exact in the performance of its duty than any other. For example, Davout forbade his troops from plundering enemy villages, a policy he would enforce by the use of the death penalty. Thus, in the early days of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, the III Corps tended to be entrusted with the most difficult work. He was regarded by his contemporaries as one of the ablest of Napoleon&#x27;s marshals. 

===Hundred Days===

Upon the first restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, he retired into private life, openly displaying his hostility to the Bourbons, and when Napoleon returned from Elba, Davout rejoined him. Appointed Minister of War, he reorganized the French Army insofar as time permitted, and he was so indispensable to the war department that Napoleon kept him in Paris during the Waterloo campaign. To what degree his skill and bravery would have altered the fortunes of the campaign of 1815 can only be surmised, but Napoleon has been criticized for his failure to avail himself in the field of the services of the best general he then possessed.

Davout directed the gallant, but hopeless, defense of Paris after the Battle of Waterloo. He received the command of the army assembled under the walls of Paris, and would have fought, had he not received the order of the provisional government to negotiate with the enemy. On 24 June 1815, Davout was sent by Joseph Fouché, the president of the provisional government, to the dethroned emperor at the Élysée Palace with a request to quit Paris, where his continued presence could lead to trouble and public danger. Napoleon received him coldly but left Paris the next day and resided at Château de Malmaison until 29 June when he departed for Rochfort. In later years, Napoleon said of Davout bitterly that &quot;he betrayed me too. He has a wife and children; he thought that all was lost; he wanted to keep what he had got,&quot; while on another occasion he remarked that, &quot;I thought that Davout loved me, but he loved only France.&quot; Subsequently, Davout retired with the army beyond the Loire and made his submission to the restored Bourbon monarchy on 14 July, and within a few days gave up his command to Marshal Jacques MacDonald.

==Later life==

Upon the second restoration, Davout was deprived of his titles and was exiled to Louviers on 27 December 1815. When some of his subordinate generals were proscribed, he demanded to be held responsible for their acts, as executed under his orders, and he endeavoured to prevent the condemnation of Ney. After half a year, the hostility of the Bourbons towards Davout faded and he became reconciled to the monarchy. In 1817, his rank and titles were restored and in 1819, he became a member of the Chamber of Peers.

In 1822, Davout was elected mayor of Savigny-sur-Orge, an office he held for a year. His son Louis-Napoléon was also mayor of the city from 1843 to 1846. A main square bears their name in the city, as does a boulevard in Paris.

Davout died in Paris on 1 June 1823. His remains rest in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, where an elaborate tomb marks his grave.

==Honours and awards==
Davout held the following honours and awards:
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Legion of Honour
* Knight of the Order of the Iron Crown
* Grand Cross and Star of the Virtuti Militari
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the White Eagle
* Knight of the Order of Christ
* Knight Grand Cross of the Military Order of St. Henry
* Knight Grand Cross of the Military Order of Max Joseph
* Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of St. Stephen of Hungary
* Knight of the Military Order of Maria Theresa
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Elephant

==Personal life==


Davout was known as a methodical person in both military and personal affairs. Within the army and among his social peers, he was often considered cold and distant; while respected, he was not well-liked. During times of peace, he preferred to spend time with his family and care for his home, rather than cultivate his high social standing.

Because of his stubborn personality and limited social skills, he developed many enemies and antagonists within the army&#x27;s officer corps, notably Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, Joachim Murat (with whom he clashed strongly during the 1812 campaign), Louis-Alexandre Berthier and Baron Thiébault (who would harshly criticize Davout in his memoirs).

Perhaps his fiercest anger was directed towards Bernadotte, who he perceived to have failed to come to his aid at Auerstadt, though close enough to observe the smoke and hear the cannon fire. His anger was so intense that Davout requested to settle the matter with a personal duel, averted only by Napoléon&#x27;s personal intervention. Bernadotte was eventually sent back to Paris in disgrace after being caught by Napoleon retreating without orders at the battle of Wagram. Bernadotte then caught the eye of the Swedish ambassador, looking for a well-connected French officer to take on the role of heir to the Swedish throne. When Sweden threw in her lot against Napoleon in the War of the Sixth Coalition, Davout personally asked to be placed opposite Bernadotte&#x27;s contingent, in order to gain retribution for the latter&#x27;s betrayal. But with Davout assigned to defend Hamburg (which he did, up to and beyond Napoleon&#x27;s abdication), they never did face each other in battle.

Of the other Marshals, Davout had the best relations with Michel Ney, Edouard Mortier, Nicolas Charles Oudinot and Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr. His best friend was possibly Charles-Étienne Gudin de La Sablonnière, one of his subordinates, who was killed in battle in 1812.. Also, he was friends with Louis Desaix, who was killed at the Battle of Marengo. 

===Family===

Davout was also noted for his loyalty to his long-time second wife Louise &quot;Aimée&quot; Julie Davout (née Leclerc, sister of Charles Leclerc and sister-in-law of Pauline Bonaparte) (Pontoise, 19 June 1782Paris, 17 December 1868), whom he married in 1801 and who remained with him until his death. Their marriage was loving and the couple seem to have been faithful to each other despite very long periods of separation. They had eight children, four of whom died in childhood:
*Paul (1802–1803)
*Joséphine (1804–1805)
*Antoinette Joséphine (180519 August 1821), married in 1820 to Achille, Comte Félix-Vigier (1801–1868)
*Adèle Napoleone (June 180721 January 1885), married on 14 March 1827 to Étienne, Comte de Cambacérès (180420 December 1878)
*Napoleon (1809–1810)
*Napoleon &quot;Louis&quot;, 2nd Duke of Auerstedt, 2nd and last Prince of Eckmühl (6 January 181113 June 1853), who died unmarried and without issue
*Jules (1812–1813)
*Adelaide-Louise (8 July 18156 October 1892), married on 17 August 1835 to François-Edmond de Couliboeuf, Marquis de Blocqueville (1789–1861)
The title of duke went to the descendants of Louis-Nicolas&#x27; brother Charles Isidor (1774–1854) by his marriage in 1824 to Claire de Cheverry (1804–1895). He also had a sister Julie (1771–1846), married in 1801 to Marc-Antoine Bonnin de La Bonninière, 1st Count de Beaumont (1763–1830), and another brother, Alexandre-Louis-Edme, 1st Baron d&#x27;Avout (1773–1820), married in 1808 to Alire Parisot (1786–1856).
The youngest daughter, Adelaide-Louise, marquise de Blocqueville, left provision in her will for the name of her father to be given to a lighthouse. In 1897, the Phare d&#x27;Eckmühl was opened on the headland of Penmarc&#x27;h in Brittany.

<text>Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine (4 February 174028 August 1793) was a French general. As a young officer in the French Royal Army, he served in the Seven Years&#x27; War. In the American Revolutionary War he joined Rochambeau&#x27;s &quot;Expédition Particulière&quot; (Special Expedition) supporting the American colonists. Following the successful Virginia campaign and the Battle of Yorktown, he returned to France and rejoined his unit in the Royal Army.

When the French Revolution began he was elected to the Estates-General and served in the subsequent National Constituent Assembly as a representative from Metz. He supported some of the August Decrees, but also supported, generally, royal prerogative and the rights of the French émigrés. At the dissolution of the Assembly in 1791, he rejoined the army as a lieutenant general and the following year replaced Nicolas Luckner as commander-in-chief of the Army of the Vosges. In 1792, he successfully led campaigns in the middle and upper Rhine regions, taking Speyer and Mainz and breaching the Wissembourg lines. Following Charles François Dumouriez&#x27;s apparent treason, the Committee of Public Safety investigated Custine, but a vigorous defense mounted by Maximillien Robespierre resulted in his acquittal.

Upon return to active command, he found the army had lost most of its officer corps and experienced troops, and in 1793, following a series of reversals in the spring, the French lost control of much of the territory they had acquired the year before. Ordered to take command of the Army of the North, Custine sought first to solidify French control of the important crossings of the Rhine by Mainz. However, when he failed to relieve the besieged fortress of Condé the following year, he was recalled to Paris. After Condé, Mainz and Speyer had all been lost, he was arrested. He was prosecuted in a lengthy trial before the Committee on Public Safety&#x27;s Revolutionary Tribunal by Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville, and Jacques Hébert continued to attack Custine through his publication &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot;. Custine was found guilty of treason by a majority vote of the Tribunal on 27 August, and guillotined the following day.

His son was also executed a few months later, and his daughter-in-law Delphine de Custine suffered for several months in prison before she was released in the summer of 1794. She managed to recover some of the family property and emigrated to Germany, and later Switzerland, with her son, Astolphe-Louis-Léonor, who became a well-known travel writer. The fate of the family is representative of the fates of many of the minor aristocracy in France, especially those in the military and diplomatic corps, whose reputations the Montagnards tarnished in the Reign of Terror.

==Military service==

===Early career===

Custine began his career at the age of eight, in 1748, at the end of the War of Austrian Succession in Germany under Marshal Saxe, who continued his tutelage during peace time. During the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–63), Custine served in the French army in the German states; in 1758, he was a captain of dragoons in the Schomberg regiment. While fighting the Prussians, Custine learned to admire their modern military organization, which later influenced his own military style.

By the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Custine was &quot;maestre de camp&quot;. The Duc de Choiseul recognized his talent and created a regiment of dragoons for him, but Custine exchanged this for a regiment of infantry that was heading for America, where he could continue military action, acquire additional experience, and obtain promotion. His regiment, the &quot;Regiment de Saintonge&quot; (1,322 men and officers), embarked for the Thirteen Colonies in April 1780 from Brest. There, he served with distinction against the British as a colonel in the expeditionary force of Count Rochambeau in the War of American Independence. The regiment participated in the Virginia campaign of 1781 and received distinguished commendations for action at the Battle of Yorktown; Custine received individual recognition of merit and a brevet from the United States government. Rouchambeau&#x27;s reports praised his honesty, zeal, courage and talents.

Custine was in charge of the French troops that opened the first parallel at Yorktown on 8 October 1781. During other Yorktown operations he acted as a second-in-command to Claude-Anne de Rouvroy de Saint Simon. At least one officer had a poor opinion of Custine. At 7:00 pm on the night of 14–15 October, French and American columns successfully stormed two British redoubts in the Yorktown defenses. A diversionary attack was carried out against the Fusilier&#x27;s Redoubt at the opposite end of the line in which the French suffered 16 casualties. One of Rochambeau&#x27;s aides, Baron Ludwig von Closen wrote that Custine botched this assignment by making the feint attack after the other redoubts were captured. The aide heard that Custine was late because he had imbibed too much alcohol and believed the rumor because he had seen Custine drunk. Closen asserted that Custine underwent 24-hours arrest for his blunder.

Following the surrender of the British, the &quot;Saintonge&quot; regiment wintered in Williamsburg, Virginia and departed for the Antilles in December 1782, with the rest of the expeditionary force. On his return to France, Custine was named &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; (brigadier general) and appointed governor of Toulon. He also resumed responsibilities as the proprietor of the dragoon regiment &quot;de Rouergue.&quot;

===Activities during the French Revolution===

In 1789, the &quot;bailliage&quot; (bailiwick) of Metz elected Custine to the Estates-General; upon his election, he resigned his military commission, judging that his responsibilities in the national assembly required his full attention. In July 1789, as the French Revolution gained momentum, he remained in the National Constituent Assembly. There, he supported the creation of a constitution espousing the principles of representative government and often voted with such liberal (constitutional) nobility as the Marquis de Lafayette. Although he supported the abolition of some seigniorial rights, he strongly defended royal prerogative and the rights of the nobility who fled during the Great Fear, especially their rights of property. He offered limited support of the nineteen decrees that abolished game-laws, seigniorial courts, the purchase and sale of posts in the magistracy, pecuniary immunities, favoritism in taxation, surplice money, first-fruits, pluralities, and unmerited pensions.

With the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly in October 1791, Custine was appointed lieutenant general to the Army of the Vosges, as the army of volunteers was known. Despite his strict discipline, he was popular with the soldiers, amongst whom he was known as &quot;général moustache&quot;. The following year he was appointed commander-in-chief of the army, replacing Nicolas Luckner; in the following campaign, he took Speyer, Worms, Mainz and Frankfurt in September and October 1792.

In the Rhineland, Custine continued the revolution by proclamation, and levied heavy taxes on the nobility and clergy. During the winter a Prussian army forced him to evacuate Frankfurt, re-cross the Rhine and fall back upon Landau. This occurred during Charles François Dumouriez&#x27;s treasonous collaboration with the Austrians. Summoned to Paris to account for himself, Custine was accused of treason, but was ably defended by Robespierre, the French revolutionary and lawyer, who declared Custine an honest man who gave his country good service. With Robespierre&#x27;s defense, he was cleared of all charges, and was later given command of the Army of the North.

In early May 1793, Custine designed a plan to cut off a body of the Coalition force that had ventured too far from the main force at Mainz. However, since he was about to take command of the Army of the North, he delegated some of the responsibility for this plan to Jean Nicolas Houchard (another ill-fated general destined for the guillotine), instructing him to attack Limbourg with the Army of the Moselle. The garrison at Landau was to make several feints to distract the Prussian troops. Custine also created and distributed a false report that the cavalry of the Army of the Moselle had arrived, and that they had also been reinforced by part of the artillery from Strasbourg. General Jean-Baptiste Michel Féry, who commanded an 40 battalions, was to throw himself on the Prussians until he heard that the principal engagement by Rheinzabern had begun. Custine left with his troops in the evening; several delays prevented him from arriving until five in the morning, but Charles Hyacinthe Leclerc de Landremont engaged the Austrian army in the meanwhile and prevented them from advancing until Custine arrived and charged the Austrian post with two divisions of dragoons. Unfortunately, a battalion of French mistook Custine&#x27;s dragoons for the enemy, and fired upon them with great accuracy. Any attempt to rally the battalion met with additional discharges. The commander, who apparently had no control over his troops, was denounced by both the representatives and his troops, and was arrested, but shot himself. Custine was disgusted with the affair: &quot;This day, which ought to have so memorable, terminated by the taking of one piece of cannon and a very great number of prisoners.&quot; Custine was recalled to Paris on 15 July.

===Trial before the Tribunal===

Upon arrival in Paris, Custine displayed his usual , which seemed to exasperate his political enemies. He took private rooms in a furnished hotel, and rented a room for his secretary. He visited his son and daughter-in-law, and carried on his usual Parisian social calendar: he appeared in all the public places, at the Palais-Royal and the theater, and was received with noisy ovations and shouts of &quot;Vive Custine!&quot; The Committee of Public Safety ordered a policeman to accompany him everywhere. On 22 July, he was arrested and imprisoned in the Luxembourg. On 23 July, the news came that Mainz had capitulated; on 28 July came the news of the loss of Valenciennes. He was transferred to the Conciergerie on 28 July, and his rooms, those of his secretary, and those of his son were sealed, pending a search.

After three weeks of searches and examination, the public prosecutor Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville drew up the indictment: Custine&#x27;s crime, according to the representatives on mission, was negligence, for allowing the Allies to take Condé and Valenciennes, and also for the loss of Mainz, a city that Custine had abandoned when occupation became untenable. During his trial, Hébert continued to attack Custine via his newspaper, the infamous &quot;Père Duchene&quot;.

This time Robespierre did not defend Custine. Custine&#x27;s lovely daughter-in-law came daily to the courthouse to sit at his feet; eventually, the prosecutors accused the judges of postponing a verdict so that they could continue to gaze at her. The Revolutionary Tribunal convicted him of treason and he was executed by guillotine on the following day, 28 August 1793.

===Character===

Custine&#x27;s leadership and character, although impugned by the Tribunal, proved fundamentally sound in the field. As an admirer of the Prussian style of drill and discipline, he was a strict disciplinarian, but his soldiers actually liked him, and felt inspired by him. Custine liked to make speeches and reportedly knew the names of his soldiers. He visited men in the hospital, demonstrated blunt good humor, and was the master of repartee. His ready wit was quoted throughout his command. He did not tolerate disorder or insubordination however; when encountering a troop of volunteers in 1792, who bragged that they were going to teach the army the right step (make it Republican), he ordered his cavalry to surround and disarm them.

Custine also recognized and recruited talented officers. At the surrender of the garrison at Mainz, he offered the Mainz commander, Rudolf Eickemeyer, a colonel&#x27;s commission to serve in the French army. By 1793, Eickemeyer had been promoted to brigadier general; he served in the Upper Rhine campaigns and the Rhine Campaign of 1796. During this campaign, he also acquired the services of a young officer, Laurent Gouvion, later known as Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr. According to Antoine Marie Chamans, he acquired Saint Cyr&#x27;s services in an unusual way, indicative of Custine&#x27;s temperament and personality. In a break in action, Gouvion was sketching the countryside, including the enemy positions near Eckheim, in the vicinity of Mainz, when Custine saw him from a distance. Not approving of his occupation, Custine galloped to him, snatched the paper from his hand, and angrily asked what he was doing. Upon noticing that Gouvion&#x27;s drawing closely matched the positions, he assigned the young officer to his own staff.

One of Custine&#x27;s staff officers, Simon François Gay de Vernon wrote that he was careful of his soldiers&#x27; well-being, a good administrator, generous with his own money, used to managing soldiers, able to understand things at a glance, sober, and active. Custine appreciated the sage advice of intelligent officers and showed his gratitude to them. Aside from Saint-Cyr, Custine appointed Louis Desaix and Jean-Baptiste Kléber to his staff. His enormous vanity, his belief that his plans were so wonderful that he failed to see their flaws, and his bad habit of accusing and denouncing other generals were Custine&#x27;s greatest flaws. When Houchard was appointed to command two armies, Custine wrote accurately, &quot;the conduct of two armies is beyond Houchard&#x27;s power...&quot; The letter was published and hurt the feelings of a man who had served Custine loyally. Custine unwisely got into a quarrel with General Pierre Joseph Ferrier du Chastelet who was on friendly terms with the War Minister Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte. He also denounced fellow army commanders Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville and François Christophe de Kellermann.

==Family==

Born in Metz on 4 February 1740, Custine was a son of Philippe-François-Joseph, comte de Custine, and Anne-Marguerite Maguin, daughter of Francois, comte d&#x27; Roussy and Marguerite de Walter. His father, the tenth count, had died at the Battle of Rossbach in 1757, one of six French generals killed in the engagement. Custine&#x27;s other titles included Signeur de Guermagne and de Sareck, and he was, after 1770, also the lord of Niderviller, a property he purchased. He married Adelaide-Celeste Louise Gagnat de Longny. In 1790 Custine&#x27;s daughter, Adelaide-Anne-Philippe, married Henri Evrard, marquis de Dreux-Brézé, master of ceremonies for Louis XVI. She and her husband spent much of the early 1790s as refugees in Britain, although he returned to France several times to visit his estates; he was eventually confirmed as a peer of France, resumed his pre-Revolution position as master of ceremonies, this time for Louis XVIII, and was awarded military rank.

Custine&#x27;s son, Renaud-Louis-Philippe-Francois, (b. in Paris in 1768 and died 3 January 1794), also called Armand, was a captain in one of the regiments in the Army of the Rhine. As a young man, he had traveled widely, and made a long study of the art of war in Berlin. Comte de Mirabeau, ever the politician, predicted that the young Custine would become a well-respected diplomat. By 1792, Armand was Nicholas Luckner&#x27;s aide-de-camp; following Luckner&#x27;s dismissal, he entered a brief embassy duty in Berlin in 1792 as &quot;chargé de affaires&quot; and eventually, as diplomatic relations between France and the rest of Europe became strained, he was a hostage for the safe return of Prussian and Austrian diplomats in Paris. His deceased mother had left him capital of 700,000 &quot;livres&quot;, making him a wealthy young man; it was assumed that his father would also settle a suitable amount on him upon his marriage as well as the family estates in Niderviller, which included six farms.

Custine, as an aristocratic general, and his son, an up-and-coming diplomat, seemed natural targets of suspicion. In 1792, after spending part of a year in Berlin, the younger Custine found himself under suspicion, despite his careful and circumspect behavior in Berlin: he had gone out of his way to make sure that he documented and reported any contact with the Prussians, and that all reports of his conversations were carefully and specifically annotated. He wrote to his mother-in-law that, by a miracle, he was not on the list of those to be arrested, and had avoided the September 1792 massacre at the Prison de l&#x27;Abbaye. He reported that he feared writing to his wife by the insecure post. He languished in Paris over the winter, but eventually he secured a position in his father&#x27;s command in the Army of the Rhine, joining that army in Frankfurt. By August 1793, though, following his father&#x27;s arrest, young Custine found himself proscribed, that is, on the list of suspected royalists. The September Law of Suspects accelerated the son&#x27;s trial. The chief evidence against him seemed to be a letter he had written to his father the previous spring, suggesting that he resign from the army, and this, as well as other letters—real and forged—guaranteed his condemnation. He was condemned and guillotined a day later. He left a young son, Astolphe-Louis-Léonor, Marquis de Custine (18 March 1790 – 25 September 1857).

===Faience investment===

In 1770, Custine acquired property in the Niderviller region, which included a faience factory. The manufactory had been founded in 1735, but had enjoyed limited profitability. Various difficulties, including a fire that gutted the production building and a limitation on the manufacture of soft-paste porcelain, discouraged the original investors. When Custine purchased the property in 1770, it was a struggling investment. He encountered significant financial problems over the next eight years, and considered bankruptcy in 1778. He subsequently entered into business with François-Henri Lenfrey and the factory began producing faience in the English style of tableware. Lenfrey also revamped the production process, producing &quot;cailloutage&quot;, which combined faience production techniques with a new process that mixed crushed limestone with the clay. Custine&#x27;s execution led to the temporary closing of the plant when the regime confiscated his property; the workmen, summarily laid off, traveled to Paris to find work, and several signed a petition for her release. The continued war with the Coalition reduced the number of employees to 15; the factory survived, however, and enjoyed a renaissance in the mid-nineteenth century. Custine presented George Washington with a set of this tableware service in 1782.

<text>Jean Lannes, 1st [[Duc de Montebello|Duke of Montebello]], Prince of [[Duchy of Siewierz|Siewierz]] (; 10 April 1769 – 31 May 1809), was a French military commander and a Marshal of the Empire who served during both the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

He was one of Napoleon&#x27;s most daring and talented generals, and is regarded by many as one of history&#x27;s greatest military commanders. Napoleon once commented on Lannes: &quot;I found him a pygmy and left him a giant&quot;. A personal friend of the emperor, he was allowed to address him with the familiar &quot;tu&quot;, as opposed to the formal &quot;vous&quot;.

==Early life==
Lannes was born in the small town of Lectoure, in the province of Gascony in Southern France. He was the son of a small landowner and merchant, Jeannet Lannes (1733–1812), son of Jean Lannes (d. 1746), a farmer, and his wife, Jeanne Pomiès (d. 1770), and paternal grandson of Pierre Lane and wife Bernarde Escossio (both died in 1721), and wife Cécile Fouraignan (1741–1799), daughter of Bernard Fouraignan and wife Jeanne Marguerite Laconstère. He was apprenticed in his teens to a dyer. Lannes received little education, but his great strength and proficiency in many sports caused him in 1792 to be elected sergeant-major of the battalion of volunteers of Gers, which he had joined upon the outbreak of war between France and Spain. He served under General Jean-Antoine Marbot during the campaigns in the Pyrenees in 1793 and 1794, and rose by distinguished conduct to the rank of &quot;chef de brigade&quot;. During his time in the Pyrenees, Lannes was given some important tasks by General Jacques François Dugommier and recommended for promotion by future Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout.

==Campaigns of Italy and Egypt==

Lannes served under General Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer, taking part in the Battle of Loano. However, in 1795, as a result of the reforms of the army introduced by the Thermidorians, he was dismissed from his rank. He re-enlisted as a simple volunteer in the French &quot;Armée d&#x27;Italie.&quot; He served in the Italian campaign of 1796, and climbed his way up to high rank once again, being given command of a brigade in General Charles-Pierre Augereau’s division and later of 3 battalions of the permanent advance guard at different times. Lannes was distinguished in every battle and played an important role in the victory at Dego. At the Battle of Bassano, he captured two enemy flags with his own hands and received multiple wounds at the Battle of Arcole but kept leading his column in person.

Lannes led troops under Claude Victor-Perrin in the invasion of the Papal States. When he and a small reconnaissance party ran into 300 Papal cavalry, he averted danger by astutely ordering the men to return to base, convincing them not to attack.

He was chosen by Bonaparte to accompany him to Egypt as commander in one of General Jean-Baptiste Kléber&#x27;s brigades, in which capacity he greatly distinguished himself, especially during the retreat from Syria. Lannes was wounded at the Battle of Abukir, before he returned to France with Bonaparte, and assisted him in the Coup of 18 Brumaire. After Bonaparte&#x27;s takeover and appointment as Consul of France, Lannes was promoted to the ranks of general of division and commandant of the Consular Guard.

Back with the &quot;Armée d&#x27;Italie&quot;, Lannes commanded the advanced guard in the crossing of the Alps in 1800, was instrumental in winning the Battle of Montebello, from which he afterwards took his title, and played a large part in the Battle of Marengo.

==Napoleonic Wars==

General Joachim Murat and &quot;Chef de brigade&quot; Jean-Baptiste Bessières schemed to have Lannes removed over a budget deficit, but Augereau bailed him out. As a result, Lannes was not totally disgraced, but was instead sent as ambassador to Portugal in 1801. Opinions differ as to his merits in this capacity; Napoleon never made such use of him again. Lannes purchased the seventeenth-century Château de Maisons, near Paris, in 1804 and had one of its state apartments redecorated for a visit from Napoleon.

Upon the establishment of the First French Empire, he was made one of the original eighteen Marshals of the Empire. In 1805, he fully regained Napoleon&#x27;s favour, which he lost during the consulate. At Austerlitz, he commanded the left wing of the . During the War of the Fourth Coalition, Lannes was at his best, commanding his corps with the greatest credit in the march through the Thuringian Forest, the Battle of Saalfeld (which is studied as a model today at the French Staff College), and the Battle of Jena. His leadership of the advance guard at Friedland was even more prominent.

In 1807, Napoleon recreated the Duchy of Siewierz (&quot;Sievers&quot;), granting it to Lannes after Prussia was forced to cede all her acquisitions from the second and third partitions of Poland.

After this, Lannes was to be tested as a commander-in-chief, for Napoleon sent him to Spain in 1808 and gave him a detached wing of the army to command, with which he won a crushing victory over General Francisco Castaños at Tudela on 22 November. In January 1809, he was sent to capture Zaragoza, and by 21 February, after one of the most stubborn defences in history, Lannes was in possession of the place. He later said, &quot;this damned Bonaparte is going to get us all killed&quot; after his last campaign in Spain. In 1808, Napoleon made him Duke of Montebello, and in 1809, for the last time, gave him command of the advance guard. He took part in the engagements around Eckmühl and the advance on Vienna. With his corps, he led the French Army across the Danube River and bore the brunt, with Marshal André Masséna, at the Battle of Aspern-Essling.

==Death==
On 22 May 1809, during a lull in the second day of the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Lannes went and sat down at the edge of a ditch, his hand over his eyes and his legs crossed.

As he sat there, plunged in gloomy meditation on having seen his friend, General Pierre Charles Pouzet, decapitated mid-conversation by a cannonball, a second cannonball fired from a gun at Enzersdorf ricocheted and struck him just where his legs crossed. The knee-pan of one was smashed, and the back sinews of the other torn. The marshal said &quot;I am wounded; it&#x27;s nothing much; give me your hand to help me up.&quot; He tried to rise, but could not.

He was carried to the &quot;tête de pont&quot;, where the chief surgeons proceeded to dress his wound. One of Lannes&#x27; legs was amputated within two minutes by Dominique Jean Larrey. He bore the painful operation with courage; it was hardly over when Napoleon came up and, kneeling beside the stretcher, wept as he embraced the marshal. On 23 May, he was transported by boat to the finest house in , now a part of Simmering district of Vienna. Eight days later, on 31 May, Lannes died from his painful wounds at daybreak. Napoleon commented on Lannes&#x27; death by saying &quot;I have lost the most distinguished general in my army, my companion in arms for sixteen years, and my best friend.&quot;

He was initially buried in Les Invalides, Paris, but in 1810, he was exhumed and reinterred in the Panthéon national after a grandiose ceremony.

==Family==
Lannes married twice, in Perpignan on 19 March 1795 to Paulette Méric, whom he divorced because of infidelity in 1800, after she had given birth to an illegitimate son while he was serving in Egypt:
* Jean-Claude Lannes de Montebello (Montauban, 12 February 1799 – 1817), who died unmarried and without issue,

His second marriage was at Dornes on 16 September 1800 to Louise Antoinette, Comtesse de Guéhéneuc (Paris, 26 February 1782 – Paris, 3 July 1856), by whom he had five children:
* Louis Napoléon (30 July 1801 – 19 July 1874)
* Alfred-Jean (11 July 1802 – 20 June 1861)
* Jean-Ernest (20 July 1803 – 24 November 1882)
* Gustave-Olivier (4 December 1804 – 25 August 1875)
* Josephine-Louise (4 March 1806 – 8 November 1889)
One succeeded in his titles and three others used the courtesy title of baron. One of his direct descendants, Philippe Lannes de Montebello, was the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art until 2008.

==Assessment==
Lannes ranks with Louis-Nicolas Davout and André Masséna as the ablest of all of Napoleon&#x27;s marshals. He was continually employed in tasks requiring the utmost resolution and daring, and more especially when the emperor&#x27;s combinations depended upon the vigour and self-sacrifice of a detachment or fraction of the army. It was thus with Lannes at Friedland and at Aspern as it was with Davout at Austerlitz and Auerstedt, and Napoleon&#x27;s estimate of his subordinates&#x27; capacities can almost exactly be judged by the frequency with which he used them to prepare the way for his own shattering blow. Dependable generals with the usual military virtue, or careful and exact troop leaders like Jean-de-Dieu Soult and Étienne Macdonald, were kept under Napoleon&#x27;s own hand for the final assault which he himself launched; the long hours of preparatory fighting against odds of two to one, which alone made the final blow possible, he entrusted only to men of extraordinary courage and high capacity for command. Lannes&#x27; place in his affections was never filled.

== Miscellaneous ==
A chocolate cake, the &quot;Gâteau au chocolat de la Maréchale de Lannes&quot;, is named after him.

<text>Sarit Hadad (, ; born September 20, 1978) is an Israeli singer. She was named by Channel 24 as the &quot;best female singer of the 2000s&quot; in October 2009. She represented Israel with the song &quot;Light a Candle&quot; at the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 in Tallinn, Estonia.

==Biography==
Hadad was born Sarah Hudadatov () in Afula, Israel, to a family of Mountain Jews. Her parents had made &quot;aliyah&quot; from Dagestan in 1976. Hadad also traces her ancestry to Uralo-Kavkaz, a region in Ukraine near the Black Sea. She is the youngest of eight children: she has four brothers and three sisters. In 1980, her family moved to Hadera. When she was 10 years old, she participated in a contest for young talent, where she performed on the piano. She also played the organ, guitar, accordion, and darbuka.

In September 2021, she came out of the closet and revealed her partner Tamar Yahalomi, releasing the song &quot;Ahava Kmo Shelanu&quot; (&quot;A Love Like Ours&quot;).

On September 21, 2017, Hadad gave birth to a baby girl named Noya. In May 2020 Sarit and Tamar had a second daughter together, Shira and in November 2022 they had a third girl, Adele Esther. 

==Career==
Hadad comes from a musical family and was recognized as a child prodigy. She began performing at the age of eight. Apart from classical piano, she taught herself to play the organ, guitar, accordion, and a Middle Eastern drum known as the darbuka. At the age of 15, she joined the Hadera Youth Band. When she was 16 she was discovered by Avi Gueta, who is still her manager.

Hadad&#x27;s career as a pop singer has been successful, with many of her songs topping the Israeli charts. Israeli Television selected her to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. The song, &quot;Nadlik Beyakhad Ner (Light A Candle)&quot; (in Hebrew: נדליק ביחד נר), came in 12th place.

In 2004, she collaborated with David D&#x27;Or to record the DVD &quot;Pets in Tunes&quot;.

In December 2006, Hadad drew crowds in New York City, Miami, and Los Angeles with her &quot;Sing with Sarit&quot; tour. In July 2007, Madonna revealed that she is a fan of Hadad, and enjoys listening to her music when dining at a kosher restaurant near her home.

Hadad performs Mizrahi music, sometimes employing Arabic lyrics. She does not perform on Jewish holidays or on the Jewish Sabbath.

She sings in English, Arabic, Georgian, Turkish, Greek and Hebrew. She was the first Israeli to perform (professionally) in Jordan.

In 2020 she did a duet with Neta Barzilai, winner of the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest.

Hadad was a judge in the inaugural season of &quot;The Voice Israel&quot; on Israeli television.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2010, Hadad was named Israel&#x27;s Singer of the Decade by Galgalatz and Channel 24.

<doc id="330206" wikidata="Q783507" url="?curid=330206" title="Differentiable function">
<text>In mathematics, a differentiable function of one real variable is a function whose derivative exists at each point in its domain. In other words, the graph of a differentiable function has a non-vertical tangent line at each interior point in its domain. A differentiable function is smooth (the function is locally well approximated as a linear function at each interior point) and does not contain any break, angle, or cusp.

If is an interior point in the domain of a function , then is said to be &quot;differentiable at&quot; if the derivative formula_1 exists. In other words, the graph of has a non-vertical tangent line at the point . is said to be differentiable on if it is differentiable at every point of . is said to be &quot;continuously differentiable&quot; if its derivative is also a continuous function over the domain of the function formula_2. Generally speaking, is said to be of class if its first formula_3 derivatives formula_4 exist and are continuous over the domain of the function formula_2.

For a multivariable function, as shown here, the differentiability of it is something more complex than the existence of the partial derivatives of it.

==Differentiability of real functions of one variable==

A function formula_6, defined on an open set formula_7, is said to be &quot;differentiable&quot; at formula_8 if the derivative
:formula_9 
exists. This implies that the function is continuous at .

This function is said to be &quot;differentiable&quot; on if it is differentiable at every point of . In this case, the derivative of is thus a function from into formula_10 

A continuous function is not necessarily differentiable, but a differentiable function is necessarily continuous (at every point where it is differentiable) as is shown below (in the section Differentiability and continuity). A function is said to be &quot;continuously differentiable&quot; if its derivative is also a continuous function; there exist functions that are differentiable but not continuously differentiable (an example is given in the section Differentiability classes).

==Differentiability and continuity==

If is differentiable at a point , then must also be continuous at . In particular, any differentiable function must be continuous at every point in its domain. &quot;The converse does not hold&quot;: a continuous function need not be differentiable. For example, a function with a bend, cusp, or vertical tangent may be continuous, but fails to be differentiable at the location of the anomaly.

Most functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at almost every point. However, a result of Stefan Banach states that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a meagre set in the space of all continuous functions. Informally, this means that differentiable functions are very atypical among continuous functions. The first known example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere is the Weierstrass function.

==Differentiability classes==

A function formula_2 is said to be if the derivative formula_12 exists and is itself a continuous function. Although the derivative of a differentiable function never has a jump discontinuity, it is possible for the derivative to have an essential discontinuity. For example, the function
formula_13
is differentiable at 0, since
formula_14
exists. However, for formula_15 differentiation rules imply
formula_16
which has no limit as formula_17 Thus, this example shows the existence of a function that is differentiable but not continuously differentiable (i.e., the derivative is not a continuous function). Nevertheless, Darboux&#x27;s theorem implies that the derivative of any function satisfies the conclusion of the intermediate value theorem.

Similarly to how continuous functions are said to be of continuously differentiable functions are sometimes said to be of . A function is of if the first and second derivative of the function both exist and are continuous. More generally, a function is said to be of if the first formula_3 derivatives formula_4 all exist and are continuous. If derivatives formula_20 exist for all positive integers formula_21 the function is smooth or equivalently, of 

==Differentiability in higher dimensions==

A function of several real variables is said to be differentiable at a point if there exists a linear map such that
:formula_22

If a function is differentiable at , then all of the partial derivatives exist at , and the linear map is given by the Jacobian matrix, an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;m&quot; matrix in this case. A similar formulation of the higher-dimensional derivative is provided by the fundamental increment lemma found in single-variable calculus.

If all the partial derivatives of a function exist in a neighborhood of a point and are continuous at the point , then the function is differentiable at that point .

However, the existence of the partial derivatives (or even of all the directional derivatives) does not guarantee that a function is differentiable at a point. For example, the function defined by

:formula_23

is not differentiable at , but all of the partial derivatives and directional derivatives exist at this point. For a continuous example, the function

:formula_24

is not differentiable at , but again all of the partial derivatives and directional derivatives exist.

==Differentiability in complex analysis==

In complex analysis, complex-differentiability is defined using the same definition as single-variable real functions. This is allowed by the possibility of dividing complex numbers. So, a function formula_25 is said to be differentiable at formula_26 when

:formula_27

Although this definition looks similar to the differentiability of single-variable real functions, it is however a more restrictive condition. A function formula_25, that is complex-differentiable at a point formula_26 is automatically differentiable at that point, when viewed as a function formula_30. This is because the complex-differentiability implies that

:formula_31

However, a function formula_25 can be differentiable as a multi-variable function, while not being complex-differentiable. For example, formula_33 is differentiable at every point, viewed as the 2-variable real function formula_34, but it is not complex-differentiable at any point because the limit formula_35 does not exist (the limit depends on the angle of approach).

Any function that is complex-differentiable in a neighborhood of a point is called holomorphic at that point. Such a function is necessarily infinitely differentiable, and in fact analytic.

==Differentiable functions on manifolds==

If &quot;M&quot; is a differentiable manifold, a real or complex-valued function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;M&quot; is said to be differentiable at a point &quot;p&quot; if it is differentiable with respect to some (or any) coordinate chart defined around &quot;p&quot;. If &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are differentiable manifolds, a function &quot;f&quot;: &quot;M&quot; → &quot;N&quot; is said to be differentiable at a point &quot;p&quot; if it is differentiable with respect to some (or any) coordinate charts defined around &quot;p&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;).

<text>Aivaras Stepukonis (born 28 September 1972) is a Lithuanian musician and philosopher.

== Biography ==
From 1983 to 1986 he studied at the Kaunas music school Nr. 1 and from 1987 to 1991 at Kauno konservatorija (the clarinet class). 
From 1992 to 1994 Stepukonis earned baccalaureate in theology and philosophy from the Franciscan University of Steubenville (Ohio, USA) in 1995 and master&#x27;s degree from the International Academy of Philosophy in Schaan (Liechtenstein) in 1997. 
From 2001 to 2005 he received his doctorate in philosophy at the Lithuanian Culture, Philosophy, and Art Research Institute in Vilnius. In 2005, he defended his PhD thesis at the institute. In the same year he published monograph on Max Scheler and sociology of knowledge (&quot;Pavergto mąstymo problema: Maxas Scheleris ir žinojimo sociologijos ištakos&quot;; ). In 2007, he received a research fellowship from UNESCO and Keizō Obuchi to study of the University of Hawaii. Since 2005 he is a Senior Fellow at the Institute for Science Lithuanian Cultural Studies. Since 2007 he is also a director of UAB &quot;Kranto studijos&quot;.

He was vocals in a band called &quot;Pėdsakai&quot; (Footprints) from 1998 until 2001, when he decided to start a solo career. He was nominated as the artists of the year for the 2001 Bravo awards. In the national selections for the Eurovision Song Contest 2002, he placed second. Nevertheless, he was allowed to represent Lithuania with the song &quot;Happy You&quot; at the international final in Tallinn because the winners B&#x27;Avarija were disqualified. Aivaras was not very successful reaching only 23rd place. Since then, Stepukonis has released three solo albums: eponymous &quot;Aivaras&quot;, &quot;Myliu arba tyliu&quot;, and &quot;Sage &amp; Fool&quot;. After the second album he retired from the stage, working as composer and sound director with other artists.

<doc id="330215" wikidata="Q2091296" url="?curid=330215" title="Row echelon form">
<text>In linear algebra, a matrix is in row echelon form if it can be obtained as the result of Gaussian elimination. Every matrix can be put in row echelon form by applying a sequence of elementary row operations. The term &quot;echelon&quot; comes from the French &quot;échelon&quot; (&quot;level&quot; or step of a ladder), and refers to the fact that the nonzero entries of a matrix in row echelon form look like an inverted staircase.

For square matrices, an upper triangular matrix with nonzero entries on the diagonal is in row echelon form, and a matrix in row echelon form is (weakly) upper triangular. Thus, the row echelon form can be viewed as a generalization of upper triangular form for rectangular matrices.

A matrix is in reduced row echelon form if it is in row echelon form, with the additional property that the first nonzero entry of each row is equal to formula_1 and is the only nonzero entry of its column. The reduced row echelon form of a matrix is unique and does not depend on the sequence of elementary row operations used to obtain it. The variant of Gaussian elimination that transforms a matrix to reduced row echelon form is sometimes called Gauss–Jordan elimination.

A matrix is in column echelon form if its transpose is in row echelon form. Since all properties of column echelon forms can therefore immediately be deduced from the corresponding properties of row echelon forms, &quot;only row echelon forms are considered in the remainder of the article.&quot;

==(General) row echelon form==

A matrix is in row echelon form if
* All rows having only zero entries are at the bottom.
* The leading entry (that is, the left-most nonzero entry) of every nonzero row, called the pivot, is on the right of the leading entry of every row above.

Some texts add the condition that the leading coefficient must be 1 while others require this only in reduced row echelon form.

These two conditions imply that all entries in a column below a leading coefficient are zeros.

The following is an example of a formula_2 matrix in row echelon form, but not in reduced row echelon form (see below):
: formula_3

Many properties of matrices may be easily deduced from their row echelon form, such as the rank and the kernel.

==Reduced row echelon form==
A matrix is in reduced row echelon form (also called row canonical form) if it satisfies the following conditions:
* It is in row echelon form.
* The leading entry in each nonzero row is (called a leading one).
* Each column containing a leading has zeros in all its other entries.

If the first two conditions are verified, the last condition is equivalent to:
* Each column containing a leading has zeros in all entries above the leading .

While a matrix may have several echelon forms, its reduced echelon form is unique. 

Given a matrix in reduced row echelon form, if one permutes the columns in order to have the leading of the th row in the th column, one gets a matrix of the form
:formula_4
where is the identity matrix of dimension formula_5 equal to the rank of the entire matrix, is a matrix with formula_5 rows and formula_7 columns, and the two &#x27;s are zero matrices of appropriate size. Since a permutation of columns is not a row operation, the resulting matrix is inequivalent under elementary row operations. In the Gaussian elimination method, this corresponds to a permutation of the unknowns in the original linear system that allows a linear parametrization of the row space, in which the first formula_5 coefficients are unconstrained, and the remaining formula_7 are determined as linear combinations of these.

== Systems of linear equations ==

A system of linear equations is said to be in &quot;row echelon form&quot; if its augmented matrix is in row echelon form. Similarly, a system of linear equations is said to be in &quot;reduced row echelon form&quot; or in &quot;canonical form&quot; if its augmented matrix is in reduced row echelon form.

The canonical form may be viewed as an explicit solution of the linear system. In fact, the system is inconsistent if and only if one of the equations of the canonical form is reduced to 0 = 1; that is if there is a leading in the column of the constant terms. Otherwise, regrouping in the right hand side all the terms of the equations but the leading ones, expresses the variables corresponding to the pivots as constants or linear functions of the other variables, if any.

== Transformation to row echelon form ==
Gaussian elimination is the main algorithm for transforming every matrix into a matrix in row echelon form. A variant, sometimes called Gauss–Jordan elimination produces a reduced row echelon form. Both consist of a finite sequence of elementary row operations; the number of required elementary row operations is at most for an -by- matrix.
For a given matrix, despite the row echelon form not being unique, all row echelon forms, including the reduced row echelon form, have the same number of zero rows and the pivots are located in the same positions.

This is an example of a matrix in reduced row echelon form, which shows that the left part of the matrix is not always an identity matrix:

: formula_10

For a matrix with integer coefficients, the Hermite normal form is a row echelon form that can be calculated without introducing any denominator, by using Euclidean division or Bézout&#x27;s identity. The reduced echelon form of a matrix with integer entries generally contains non-integer entries, because of the need of dividing by its leading coefficient each row of the echelon form.

The non-uniqueness of the row echelon form of a matrix follows from the fact that some elementary row operations transform a matrix in row echelon form into another (equivalent) matrix that is also in row echelon form. These elementary row operations include the multiplication of a row by a nonzero scalar and the addition of a scalar multiple of a row to one of the rows above it. For example:
: formula_11
In this example, the unique reduced row echelon form can be obtained by subtracting three times the second row from the first row :
: formula_12

== Affine spaces of reduced echelon forms ==

In this section and the following one, we denote the location of the columns containing the leading entries of the successive rows of a formula_13 matrix formula_14 in reduced row echelon form (the pivots) as formula_15, with
:formula_16
where formula_17 is the dimension of the row space of the matrix. The data formula_18 will be called the &quot;shape&quot; of formula_14, which has leading non-zero entries
formula_20, the entries in the column formula_21 above and below it vanish, and so do all those to the left of it within the same row, as well as all entries in the formula_22th row for formula_23:
:formula_24

Since all other entries are arbitrary elements of the base field formula_25, the set formula_26 of all reduced echelon form matrices with shape formula_18 is a -affine space of dimension
:formula_28

To see this, note that, of the formula_29 possible matrix entries within the first formula_5 rows, formula_31 are determined as formula_32&#x27;s and formula_1&#x27;s because they are in the columns formula_15 containing the pivots. A further formula_35 are also required to be formula_32, because they are to the left of the pivots, but of these, 
::formula_37 

are also in the columns formula_38. Therefore, the total number of entries that are not fixed to be equal to formula_32 or formula_1 is
::formula_41

== Maximal rank: Schubert cells ==
The row echelon form can be used to give a concrete description of the Schubert cells associated with the Grassmannian of formula_42-dimensional subspaces of a vector space.

If formula_43, the matrices formula_44 are of maximal rank formula_42, and determine formula_42-dimensional subspaces formula_47 of the free formula_25-module formula_49, as the span 
:: formula_50

of linear combinations
:: formula_51

of the elementary basis vectors formula_52,
with coefficients equal to the row vectors. In this case, the affine space formula_53 is the Schubert cell
formula_54 of the Grassmannian formula_55, consisting of formula_42-dimensional subspaces of formula_57 corresponding to the integer partition
:formula_58

with parts equal to
:formula_59

relative to the complete flag
:formula_60

where 
:formula_61

This means that formula_62 consists of those formula_42-dimensional subspaces formula_47 whose intersections with the subspaces formula_65 have dimensions
::formula_66
Its dimension is then equal to the weight formula_67 of the partition 
:formula_68

An equivalent, but simpler characterization of the Schubert cell formula_54 may be given in terms of the dual complete flag

:formula_70

where 
:formula_71

Then formula_62 consists of those formula_42-dimensional subspaces formula_47 that have a basis formula_75
consisting of elements
:: formula_76

of the subspaces formula_77 which, relative to the standard basis, are the row vectors formula_78 of the row echelon form, written in reverse order.

<text>According to the Bible, Gershom ( &quot;Gēršōm&quot;, &quot;a sojourner there&quot;; ) was the firstborn son of Moses and Zipporah. The name means &quot;a stranger there&quot; in Hebrew, ( &quot;ger sham&quot;), which the text argues was a reference to Moses&#x27; flight from Egypt. Biblical scholars regard the name as being essentially the same as &quot;Gershon&quot; and in the Book of Chronicles the progenitor of one of the principal Levite clans is sometimes identified as Gershom, sometimes as Gershon.

The firstborn son of Moses by Zipporah; born in Midian. Moses’ father-in-law Jethro came to Moses in the wilderness, bringing with him Moses’ wife Zipporah and their two sons, Gershom and Eliezer. The priestly service of Gershom&#x27;s descendant Jonathan on behalf of the Danites was illegal, because, although he was a Levite, he was not of Aaron&#x27;s family.

The passage in Exodus concerning Moses and Zipporah at a night camp appears to suggest that some being, possibly God or an angel, attacks either Gershom or Moses, until a circumcision is carried out by Zipporah on Gershom.

The later Books of Chronicles identify Shebuel as a &quot;son&quot; of Gershom, though this is anachronistic for a literal interpretation of the Bible because &quot;Shebuel&quot; is described as living in the time of King David. The Hebrew word for &quot;son&quot; can also mean descendant; for example even remote descendants of King David are in many instances identified as &quot;So-and-so son of David&quot; in the original Hebrew.

== Priestly connections ==

Although certain passages of the Bible, which textual scholars ascribe to the Priestly Source, assert that it is only the descendants of Aaron known as Aaronim who were legitimate priests, biblical scholars believe that the priesthood was originally open to members of any tribe, and that the restriction to Aaronim was purely an Aaronim invention, opposed by authors such as the Deuteronomist. Aaronim claimed descent from Aaron – Moses&#x27; brother, and hence any immediate descendant of Moses would not count among the Aaronim.

The possibility that the story of Micah&#x27;s Idol refers to &quot;immediate descendants of Moses being priests&quot; is taken by biblical scholars as a demonstration that the Aaronim-only restriction was originally not present in the Israelite priesthood. One of the accounts of Micah&#x27;s idol refers to a priest as being &quot;a sojourner there&quot; (), which could alternatively be taken as stating that the priest was indeed Gershom (). The accounts of Micah&#x27;s idol also include reference to a &quot;Jonathan son of Gershom&quot; as being a priest, and although the Masoretic Text seems to avoid the implication that non-Aaronim could be priests by describing this particular &quot;Gershom&quot; as a son of &quot;Manasseh&quot; (), this appears to have been distorted; the letter &quot;nun&quot; () appears here in superscript, suggesting that the text originally described this &quot;Gershom&quot; as the one that was a son of &quot;Moses&quot; (). The rabbinic text known as the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; has &quot;Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses&quot; when it quotes this verse.

The priestly/prophetic aspect remains open to discussion, God explicitly chose Aaron and his direct sons for the Tabernacle and Temple services in remembrance of Aaron&#x27;s servitude to Moses all along. Aaron served his brother Moses with much devotion being metaphorically called &quot;his prophet&quot; from the very beginning.
The King and the Priest/Prophet are the two head leaders in ancient hierarchy; from this viewpoint, the belief of priesthood being open to &quot;anyone&quot; appears unsupported. The Bible recounts very strict lineage rules for the priests, aka &quot;the descendants of Aaron&quot;, but certain deviations from the concept are mentioned – for instance, prophets such as Samuel or Elijah performed priestly-like services in special cases. As mentioned above, it is probable that Gershom&#x27;s lineage would have compelled him into the priesthood, yet it appears he performed no regular priestly services of note. In other related writings it is mentioned that God ordered Moses to pass authority unto Joshua instead of his own two stubborn sons, Gershom and Eliezer.

<text>Contemporary classical music is Western art music composed close to the present day. At the beginning of the 21st century, it commonly referred to the post-1945 modern forms of post-tonal music after the death of Anton Webern, and included serial music, electronic music, experimental music, and minimalist music. Newer forms of music include spectral music and &quot;post-minimalism&quot;.

== History ==
=== Background ===
At the beginning of the 20th century, composers of classical music were experimenting with an increasingly dissonant pitch language, which sometimes yielded atonal pieces. Following World War I, as a backlash against what they saw as the increasingly exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism, certain composers adopted a neoclassic style, which sought to recapture the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of earlier styles (see also New Objectivity and social realism). After World War II, modernist composers sought to achieve greater levels of control in their composition process (e.g., through the use of the twelve-tone technique and later total serialism). At the same time, conversely, composers also experimented with means of abdicating control, exploring indeterminacy or aleatoric processes in smaller or larger degrees. Technological advances led to the birth of electronic music. Experimentation with tape loops and repetitive textures contributed to the advent of minimalism. Still other composers started exploring the theatrical potential of the musical performance (performance art, mixed media, fluxus). New works of contemporary classical music continue to be created. Each year, the Boston Conservatory at Berklee presents 700 performances. New works from contemporary classical music program students comprise roughly 150 of these performances.

=== 1945–75 ===
To some extent, European and the US traditions diverged after World War II. Among the most influential composers in Europe were Pierre Boulez, Luigi Nono, and Karlheinz Stockhausen. The first and last were both pupils of Olivier Messiaen. An important aesthetic philosophy as well as a group of compositional techniques at this time was serialism (also called &quot;through-ordered music&quot;, &quot;&#x27;total&#x27; music&quot; or &quot;total tone ordering&quot;), which took as its starting point the compositions of Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern (and thus was opposed to traditional twelve-tone music), and was also closely related to Le Corbusier&#x27;s idea of the &quot;modulor&quot;. However, some more traditionally based composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten maintained a tonal style of composition despite the prominent serialist movement.

In America, composers like Milton Babbitt, John Cage, Elliott Carter, Henry Cowell, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, George Rochberg, and Roger Sessions formed their own ideas. Some of these composers (Cage, Cowell, Glass, Reich) represented a new methodology of experimental music, which began to question fundamental notions of music such as notation, performance, duration, and repetition, while others (Babbitt, Rochberg, Sessions) fashioned their own extensions of the twelve-tone serialism of Schoenberg.

== Movements ==
=== Neoromanticism ===

The vocabulary of extended tonality, which flourished in the late 19th and very early 20th centuries, continues to be used by contemporary composers. It has never been considered shocking or controversial in the larger musical world—as has been demonstrated statistically for the United States, at least, where &quot;most composers continued working in what has remained throughout this century the mainstream of tonal-oriented composition&quot;.

=== High modernism ===
Serialism is one of the most important post-war movements among the high modernist schools. Serialism, more specifically named &quot;integral&quot; or &quot;compound&quot; serialism, was led by composers such as Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Bruno Maderna, Luigi Nono, and Karlheinz Stockhausen in Europe, and by Milton Babbitt, Donald Martino, Mario Davidovsky, and Charles Wuorinen in the United States. Some of their compositions use an ordered set or several such sets, which may be the basis for the whole composition, while others use &quot;unordered&quot; sets. The term is also often used for dodecaphony, or twelve-tone technique, which is alternatively regarded as the model for integral serialism.

Despite its decline in the last third of the 20th century, there remained at the end of the century an active core of composers who continued to advance the ideas and forms of high modernism. Those no longer living include Pierre Boulez, Pauline Oliveros, Toru Takemitsu, Jacob Druckman, George Perle, Ralph Shapey, Franco Donatoni, Wolfgang Rihm, Jonathan Harvey, Erkki Salmenhaara, and Henrik Otto Donner. Those still living in December 2024 include Helmut Lachenmann, Salvatore Sciarrino, Magnus Lindberg, George Benjamin, Brian Ferneyhough, Richard Wernick, Richard Wilson, and James MacMillan.

==== Electronic music ====
===== Computer music =====

Between 1975 and 1990, a shift in the paradigm of computer technology had taken place, making electronic music systems affordable and widely accessible. The personal computer had become an essential component of the electronic musician&#x27;s equipment, superseding analog synthesizers and fulfilling the traditional functions of composition and scoring, synthesis and sound processing, sampling of audio input, and control over external equipment.

==== Music theatre ====
==== Spectral music ====
==== Polystylism (eclecticism) ====

Some authors equate polystylism with eclecticism, while others make a sharp distinction.

=== Post-modernism ===
==== Minimalism and post-minimalism ====
==== Historicism ====
Musical historicism—the use of historical materials, structures, styles, techniques, media, conceptual content, etc., whether by a single composer or those associated with a particular school, movement, or period—is evident to varying degrees in minimalism, post-minimalism, world-music, and other genres in which tonal traditions have been sustained or have undergone a significant revival in recent decades. Some post-minimalist works employ medieval and other genres associated with early music, such as the &quot;Oi me lasso&quot; and other laude of Gavin Bryars.

The historicist movement is closely related to the emergence of musicology and the early music revival. A number of historicist composers have been influenced by their intimate familiarity with the instrumental practices of earlier periods (Hendrik Bouman, Grant Colburn, Michael Talbot, Paulo Galvão, Roman Turovsky-Savchuk). The musical historicism movement has also been stimulated by the formation of such international organizations as the Delian Society and Vox Saeculorum.

==== Art rock influence ====
Some composers have emerged since the 1980s who are influenced by art rock, for example, Rhys Chatham.

==== New Simplicity ====
==== New Complexity ====
New Complexity is a current within today&#x27;s European contemporary avant-garde music scene, named in reaction to the New Simplicity. Amongst the candidates suggested for having coined the term are the composer Nigel Osborne, the Belgian musicologist Harry Halbreich, and the British/Australian musicologist Richard Toop, who gave currency to the concept of a movement with his article &quot;Four Facets of the New Complexity&quot;.

Though often atonal, highly abstract, and dissonant in sound, the &quot;New Complexity&quot; is most readily characterized by the use of techniques which require complex musical notation. This includes extended techniques, microtonality, odd tunings, highly disjunct melodic contour, innovative timbres, complex polyrhythms, unconventional instrumentations, abrupt changes in loudness and intensity, and so on. The diverse group of composers writing in this style includes Richard Barrett, Brian Ferneyhough, Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf, James Dillon, Michael Finnissy, James Erber, and Roger Redgate.

==Artistry==
Gočeva&#x27;s music is regarded primarily as pop. She has additionally ventured in many other musical styles of Macedonian ethno music, predominantly incorporating elements of čalgija. According to Dave Wilson, a music critic of the New Zealand School of Music, she can be classified in the so-called &quot;second wave of ethno music&quot; along with other performers such as Ljubojna and . With her later projects, Gočeva has also managed to create her own distinctive sound where &quot;all her technical capabilities are on display&quot; and several genres amalgamate. The music released by the singer in the period between 2008 and 2018 involved traditional arrangements mixed with jazz, funk and soul. The modern lyrics of her songs often reflected the positive and negative love experiences of the female protagonist.

During interviews, Gočeva has shared that some of her music influences include Madonna and contemporary artists such as Dua Lipa, Cardi B, Whitney Houston, Cyndi Lauper, Coldplay and Hurts.

==Legacy==
Upon her first entry in the Serbian pop market, Gočeva achieved high popularity at a very fast rate. One of the &quot;obstacles&quot; she encountered at the beginning of the career was the opinions of others as she could easily fall under the musical influence or suggestions of her surroundings instead of staying genuine to her own musical style. Through the years, she decided that in addition to venturing in pop music, she also likes to experiment with different musical styles, something she sees as essential in an artist.

<text>Étienne Jacques-Joseph-Alexandre Macdonald, 1st duc de [[Taranto|Tarente]] (; 17 November 176525 September 1840), was a Marshal of the Empire and military leader during the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. While not as famous as the other marshals of Napoleon, he was nonetheless a first-rate and successful general.

Macdonald distinguished himself during the War of the First Coalition, with Macdonald being instrumental in the French victory during the Flanders campaign. He saw service in the Low Countries, Germany and Italy. He was one of the most successful Republican generals, playing an important role in extending French control over Europe during the French Revolutionary Wars.

==Family background==
Étienne Jacques Joseph Alexandre Macdonald was born in Sedan, Ardennes, France. His father was an exiled Jacobite Army veteran and war poet named Neil MacEachen MacDonald, who had been born into Clan MacDonald of Clanranald at Howbeg in South Uist, in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. Neil Macdonald briefly studied for the Roman Catholic priesthood in Paris, where he had developed a fluency in the French language that later endeared him to Prince Charles Edward Stuart. 
Similarly to his uncle, the fellow Gaelic poet and Jacobite officer Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair, Neil Macdonald was a close relative of the far more famous Flora MacDonald, who aided the escape of Prince Charles Edward Stuart to France after the defeat of the 1745 Rising at the Battle of Culloden. 

In a Gaelic poem composed, however, after his release from the Tower of London, Niall mac Eachainn mhic Sheumais, who had also risked his own life to protect the hunted Prince, harshly criticized his cousin Flora MacDonald. Flora, he alleged, had carefree steps and accordingly sought to curry favor with both the Stuarts and Hanoverians at the same time, instead of making a choice and sticking with it. In contrast, Neil not only vowed his own forever loyalty to the Prince, but followed him into exile in France, where he married into the nobility. In the late 1820s, a partial manuscript of Mac Echainn&#x27;s, &quot;fluent charming, and undoubtedly genuine narrative of the prince&#x27;s sojourn in the Hebrides&quot;, during the rising&#x27;s aftermath resurfaced in the hands of a Paris barber who claimed to be his illegitimate son. Marshal MacDonald, who had just visited South Uist seeking to research his genealogy in 1825, had been unaware of the manuscripts existence.

==Military life==
In 1784, Macdonald joined the Irish Legion, raised to support the revolutionary party in the Dutch Republic against the Kingdom of Prussia and was made lieutenant on 1 April 1785. After it was disbanded, he received a commission in Dillon&#x27;s Regiment, Irish Brigade of the French Royal Army. At the start of the French Revolution, the regiment of Dillon remained loyal to the King, except for Macdonald, who was in love with Mlle Jacob, whose father was an enthusiastic revolutionary. After his marriage on 5 May 1791, on 17 August 1792 he was promoted to captain, and on 29 August 1792 he was appointed &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to General Charles François Dumouriez. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Jemappes, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 12 November 1792 and then colonel on 8 March 1793.

He refused to defect to the Austrians with Dumouriez and as a reward was made &quot;général de brigade&quot; on 26 August 1793 and appointed to command the leading brigade in Pichegru&#x27;s invasion of the Netherlands. His knowledge of the country proved useful, and he was instrumental in the capture of the Dutch fleet by French hussars in January 1795.

In 1797, having been made &quot;général de division&quot; back in November 1794, he now served first in the Army of the Rhine and later in the Army of Italy as of 24 April 1798. When he reached Italy in 1798, the Treaty of Campo Formio had been signed on 18 October 1797, and Bonaparte had returned to France; but, under the direction of Berthier, Macdonald occupied Rome in the 1798-1799 Roman Republic, of which he was made governor on 19 November 1798, and then in conjunction with Championnet he defeated General Mack at the Battle of Ferentino, the Battle of Otricoli, the 5 December 1798 Battle of Civita Castellana, and two military affairs, first at Calvi Risorta and then on 3 January 1799 at Capua, and then by 10 January 1799, he had resigned his Office due to disagreements with Championnet. However, despite any differences, the men managed to conquer the 1282-1799 Kingdom of Naples, which then became known as the Parthenopaean Republic.

Imperial Russian Army General Suvorov invaded northern Italy in March 1799 with an Austro-Russian army, and was undoing the conquests of Bonaparte and defeated Moreau at Cassano and San Giuliano. In response Macdonald moved northwards in command of the &quot;Armée de Naples&quot;. With 35,000 men, he attacked Suvorov&#x27;s 22,000 men at the Trebbia. After three days&#x27; fighting, receiving no help from Moreau, he was utterly defeated and retreated to Genoa. Later, he was made governor of Versailles and acquiesced, even if he did not participate, in the events of the 18 Brumaire.

In 1800, he received command of the army in the Helvetic Republic, maintaining communications between the armies of Germany and of Italy. He carried out his orders diligently, and in the winter of 1800–01, he was ordered to march over the Splügen Pass at the head of the Army of the Grisons. This achievement is described by Mathieu Dumas, his chief of staff. It is sometimes considered as noteworthy as Bonaparte&#x27;s passage of the St Bernard before the Battle of Marengo, although Macdonald did not fight a battle.

On his return to Paris, Macdonald married the widow of General Joubert, and was appointed French ambassador to Denmark. Returning in 1805, he was associated with Moreau and thus incurred the dislike of Napoleon, who did not include him in his first creation of marshals. It was for the same reason that Napoleon did not give him a military command between 1803 and 1809.

==Under Napoleon==
He remained without employment until 1809, but then Napoleon made him military adviser to Prince Eugène de Beauharnais, viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy and the commander of the Army of Italy. After meeting an unexpected defeat at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon summoned Eugène&#x27;s army north to join him, with Macdonald in tow. On the second day of Wagram, amid great pressure along the entire front, Napoleon ordered Macdonald to launch a desperate counterattack on the enemy centre. Macdonald promptly organised a gigantic three-sided open-backed infantry square, covered by Nansouty&#x27;s cavalry, and hurled it against the Austrian lines. Despite sustaining terrible casualties from the Austrian artillery, this bold attack broke the Austrian centre and won the day.

After the battle, having rushed to find him on the corpse-strewn battlefield, Napoleon told Macdonald, &quot;You have behaved valiantly...On the battlefield of your glory, where I owe you so large a part of yesterday&#x27;s success, I make you a Marshal of France. You have long deserved it.&quot; Additionally, Napoleon soon after ennobled him as &quot;duc de Tarente&quot; (Duke of Taranto) in the Kingdom of Naples.

In 1810, Macdonald served in Spain and in 1812, he commanded the left wing of the for the invasion of Russia. He was sent to the north but did not succeed in occupying Riga. In 1813, after participating in the battles of Lützen and Bautzen, he was ordered to invade Silesia, where Blücher defeated him with great loss at Katzbach. At the Battle of Nations in 1813, his force was pushed out at Liebertwolkwitz by Johann von Klenau&#x27;s IV Corps (Austrian); on a counterattack, his troops took the village back. Later that day, Klenau foiled his attempt to flank the Austrian main army, commanded by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. After the Battle of Leipzig, he was ordered to cover the evacuation of Leipzig with Prince Poniatowski. After the blowing up of the last bridge over the river, he managed to swim the Elster, but Poniatowski drowned. During the defensive campaign of 1814, Macdonald again distinguished himself. He was one of the marshals sent by Napoleon to take the notice of his abdication to Paris. When all were deserting Napoleon, Macdonald remained faithful. He was directed by Napoleon to give his adherence to the new &quot;régime&quot;, and was presented with the sabre of Murad Bey for his fidelity.

==Under the Bourbons==

At the Restoration, he was made a peer of France and knight grand cross of the royal order of St. Louis; he remained faithful to the new order during the Hundred Days. In 1815, he became chancellor of the Legion of Honour, a post he held till 1831. In 1816, as major-general of the royal bodyguard, he took part in the debates of the Chamber of Peers, created under the Charter of 1814, voting consistently as a moderate Liberal. After Napoleon&#x27;s abdication in 1814 Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814), Macdonald continued serving under the Bourbon monarchy. Known for speaking his mind, and never shying away from sharing his opinions, King Louis XVIII gave him the nickname &quot;His Outspokenness&quot;.

From 1830, he lived in retirement at his country home, the Chateau de Courcelles-le-Roy in Beaulieu-sur-Loire commune, Loiret, where he died on 25 September 1840, aged 74.

==Personal life==
In 1791, he married Marie-Constance Soral de Montloisir (died 1797) and had 2 daughters:
* Anne-Charlotte Macdonald (1792–1870)
* Adele-Elisabeth Macdonald (1794–1822)

In 1802, he married Felicité-Françoise de Montholon (1780–1804), the widow of General Joubert, and had a daughter:
* Alexandrine-Aimee Macdonald (1803–1869)

In 1821, he married Ernestine-Therese de Bourgoing (1789–1825) and had a son:
* Louis-Marie Macdonald, 2nd duc de Tarente (1824–1881)

==Scottish legacy==
On 30 April 2010, a plaque was unveiled to the memory of Marshal of France Jacques Macdonald on the Outer Hebridean island of South Uist, the familial home of Macdonald. Macdonald had visited South Uist in 1825 in order to find out more about his family roots.

==Assessment==
Macdonald was assessed in the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1911, which argued:Macdonald had none of that military genius that distinguished Davout, Masséna and Lannes, nor of that military science conspicuous in Marmont and St Cyr, but nevertheless his campaign in Switzerland gives him a rank far superior to such mere generals of division as Oudinot and Dupont. This capacity for independent command made Napoleon, in spite of his defeats at the Trebia and the Battle of Katzbach, trust him with large commands till the end of his career. As a man, his character cannot be spoken of too highly; no stain of cruelty or faithlessness rests on him.
Military historian Gunter E. Rothenberg wrote that although he overstated his own abilities, Macdonald was an excellent commander. Richard Dunn-Pattison praised Macdonald for his &quot;keen military insight&quot; while A. G. MacDonell called his career a string of defeats. John M. Keefe blamed his defeat at Katzbach on a general lack of staff officers in French armies not commanded by Napoleon, arguing that Macdonald had fought successfully in the rest of his career.

<text>Philippe-Paul, comte de Ségur (; 4 November 1780 – 25 February 1873) was a French general and a historian.

==Biography==
Ségur was the son of Louis Philippe, comte de Ségur and was born in Paris 4 November 1780. He enlisted in the cavalry in 1800, and forthwith obtained a commission. He served with General Macdonald in the Grisons in 1800–1801, and published an account of the campaign in 1802. By the influence of Colonel Duroc (afterwards duc de Frioul) he was attached to the personal staff of Napoleon. He served through most of the important campaigns of the first empire, and was frequently employed on diplomatic missions. During the campaign in Poland in 1807 he was taken prisoner by the Russians, but was exchanged at the Peace of Tilsit.

For his diplomatic duties he was promoted to colonel. Wounded in Spain, he was compelled to return to France. As general of brigade he took part in the Russian campaign of 1812, and in the campaigns of 1813 and 1814 he repeatedly distinguished himself, notably at Hanau (October 1813), and in a brilliant affair at Reims (March 1814). He remained in the army at the Restoration, but, having accepted a command from Napoleon during the Hundred Days, he was retired until 1818, and took no further active part in affairs until the July Revolution of 1830.

On the establishment of the July monarchy he received, in 1831, the grade of lieutenant-general and a peerage. In 1830 he was admitted to the Académie française, and he became grand cross of the Legion of Honour in 1847. After the Revolution of 1848 he lived in retirement, dying in Paris on 25 February 1873.

==Bibliography==
During his first retirement between 1818 and 1830 he wrote his &quot;Histoire de Napoléon et de la grande armée pendant l&#x27;année 1812&quot; (Paris, 2 vols., 1824), which ran through numerous editions, and was translated into several languages. The unfavourable portrait of Napoleon given in this book provoked representations from General Gourgaud, and eventually a duel, in which Ségur was wounded.

His other works include: &quot;Histoire de Russie et de Pierre le Grand&quot; (1829); &quot;Histoire de Charles VIII.&quot; (2 vols., 1834–1842), in continuation of the history of France begun by his father; and the posthumous &quot;Histoire et mémoires&quot; (8 vols., 1873).

His daughter, Marie Célestine Amélie d&#x27;Armaillé (1830–1918), was also a writer, biographer, and historian.

<doc id="330241" wikidata="Q2623863" url="?curid=330241" title="Three generations of human rights">
<text>The division of human rights into three generations was initially proposed in 1979 by the Czech jurist Karel Vasak at the International Institute of Human Rights in Strasbourg. He used the term at least as early as November 1977. Vasak&#x27;s theories have primarily taken root in European law.

In a speech two years later, his divisions follow the three watchwords of the French Revolution: &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot;. The three generations are reflected in some of the rubrics of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights lists first- and second-generation rights, the document itself does not specifically order them in accordance with Vasak&#x27;s framework.
== First-generation human rights ==
First-generation human rights, sometimes called &quot;blue rights&quot;, deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally civil and political in nature: They serve negatively to protect the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, the right to life, equality before the law, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, property rights, the right to a fair trial, and voting rights. Some of these rights and the right to due process date back to the Magna Carta of 1215 and the Rights of Englishmen, which were expressed in the English Bill of Rights in 1689. A more full set of first-generation human rights was pioneered in France by the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789, and by the United States Bill of Rights in 1791.

They were enshrined at the global level and given status in international law first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and later in the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In Europe, they were enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights in 1953.

== Second-generation human rights ==
Second-generation human rights are related to equality and began to be recognized by governments after World War II. They are fundamentally economic, social, and cultural in nature. They guarantee different members of the citizenry equal conditions and treatment. Secondary rights would include a right to be employed in just and favorable condition, rights to food, housing and health care, as well as social security and unemployment benefits. Like first-generation rights, they were also covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and further embodied in Articles 22 to 28 of the Universal Declaration, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.

In the United States of America, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed a Second Bill of Rights, covering much the same grounds, during his State of the Union Address on January 11, 1944. Today, many nations, states, or groups of nations have developed legally binding declarations guaranteeing comprehensive sets of human rights, e.g. the European Social Charter.

Some U.S. states have enacted some of these economic rights; for example, the state of New York has enshrined the right to a free education, as well as &quot;the right to organize and to bargain collectively&quot;, and workers&#x27; compensation, in its constitutional law.

These rights are sometimes referred to as &quot;red&quot; rights. They impose upon the government the duty to respect and promote and fulfill them, but this depends on the availability of resources. The duty is imposed on the state because it controls its own resources. No one has the direct right to housing and right to education. (In South Africa, for instance, the right is not, &quot;per se&quot;, to housing, but rather &quot;to have access to adequate housing&quot;, realised on a progressive basis.)

The duty of government is in the realization of these positive rights.

== Third-generation human rights ==
Third-generation human rights are those rights that go beyond the mere civil and social, as expressed in many progressive documents of international law, including the 1972 Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and other pieces of generally aspirational &quot;soft law&quot;.

Also known as Solidarity human rights, they are rights that try to go beyond the framework of individual rights to focus on collective concepts, such as community or people. However, the term remains largely unofficial, just as the also-used moniker of &quot;green&quot; rights, and thus houses an extremely broad spectrum of rights, including:

* Group and collective rights
* Right to self-determination
* Right to economic and social development
* Right to a healthy environment
* Right to natural resources
* Right to communicate and communication rights
* Right to participation in cultural heritage
* Rights to intergenerational equity and sustainability

The African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights ensures many of those: the right to self-determination, right to development, right to natural resources and right to satisfactory environment. Some countries also have constitutional mechanisms for safeguarding third-generation rights. For example, the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations, the Parliament of Finland&#x27;s , and the erstwhile Commission for Future Generations in the Israeli Knesset.

Some international organizations have offices for safeguarding such rights. An example is the High Commissioner on National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Directorate-General for the Environment of the European Commission has as its mission &quot;protecting, preserving and improving the environment for present and future generations, and promoting sustainable development&quot;.

A few jurisdictions have enacted provisions for environmental protection, e.g. New York&#x27;s &quot;forever wild&quot; constitutional article, which is enforceable by action of the New York State Attorney General or by any citizen &quot;ex rel.&quot; with the consent of the Appellate Division.

==Fourth generation==

Several analysts claim that a fourth generation of human rights is emerging, which would include rights that cannot be included in the third generation, future claims of first and second generation rights and new rights, especially in relation to technological development and information and communication technologies and cyberspace.

However, the content of it is not clear, and these analysts do not present a unique proposal. They normally take some rights from the third generation and include them in the fourth, such as the right to a healthy environment or aspects related to bioethics. Some of those analysts believe that the fourth generation is given by human rights in relation to new technologies, while others prefer to talk about digital rights, where a new range of rights would be found, such as:

* The right to equally access computing and digital 
* The right to digital self-determination
* The right to digital security
* The right to access one&#x27;s own digital data (&quot;habeas data&quot;)

Others point out that the differentiating element would be that, while the first three generations refer to the human being as a member of society, the rights of the fourth would refer to the human being as a species.

== Commentary ==
Maurice Cranston argued that scarcity means that supposed second-generation and third-generation rights are not really rights at all. If one person has a right, others have a duty to respect that right, but governments lack the resources necessary to fulfill the duties implied by citizens&#x27; supposed second- and third-generation rights.

Charles Kesler, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College and senior fellow of the Claremont Institute, has argued that second- and third-generation human rights serve as an attempt to cloak political goals, which the majority may well agree are good things in and of themselves, in the language of rights, and thus grant those political goals inappropriate connotations. In his opinion, calling socio-economic goods &quot;rights&quot; inherently creates a related concept of &quot;duties&quot;, so that other citizens have to be coerced by the government to give things to other people in order to fulfill these new rights. He also has stated that, in the U.S., the new rights create a &quot;nationalization&quot; of political decision-making at the federal level in violation of federalism. In his book &quot;Soft Despotism, Democracy&#x27;s Drift&quot;, Paul Rahe, professor at Hillsdale College, wrote that focusing on equality-based rights leads to a subordination of the initial civil rights to an ever-expanding government, which would be too incompetent to provide for its citizens correctly and would merely seek to subordinate more rights.

19th century philosopher Frederic Bastiat summarized the conflict between these negative and positive rights by saying: 

Economist Friedrich Hayek has argued that the second generation concept of &quot;social justice&quot; cannot have any practical political meaning: 

New York University School of Law professor of law Jeremy Waldron has written in response to critics of the second-generation rights: 

Hungarian socialist and political economist Karl Polanyi made the antithetical argument to Hayek in the book &quot;The Great Transformation&quot;. Polanyi wrote that an uncontrolled free market would lead to repressive economic concentration and then to a co-opting of democratic governance that degrades civil rights.

The World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 opposed the distinction between civil and political rights (negative rights) and economic, social and cultural rights (positive rights) that resulted in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action proclaiming that &quot;all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated&quot;.

<doc id="330246" wikidata="Q6267598" url="?curid=330246" title="Johnny Robinson (safety)">
<text>Johnny Nolan Robinson (born September 9, 1938) is an American former professional football player. He was primarily a safety, but also played on offense as a halfback and flanker early in his career. He played college football for the LSU Tigers.

Robinson played his entire twelve-year professional career with the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs of the American Football League (AFL) and later the National Football League (NFL). He led the AFL in interceptions with ten in 1966, and led the NFL in 1970 with ten. He had 57 interceptions during his career. Robinson is a inductee to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming the ninth member of the Chiefs&#x27; Super Bowl IV championship team to be inducted.

==Early life==
Born in Delhi, Louisiana on September 9, 1938, Robinson was W. T. &quot;Dub&quot; Robinson and Mattie Robinson&#x27;s second son. Robinson was an all-state football, tennis, and baseball player in high school. He became starting fullback in his freshman year at University High School, Louisiana State University&#x27;s (LSU) laboratory school located on LSU&#x27;s campus in Baton Rouge. Robinson and his older brother, Tommy, won the national boys&#x27; junior tennis championship when they were at U-High, where Dub Robinson was the LSU tennis coach from 1948 to 1974. Tommy was the superior tennis player and was inducted into the Louisiana Tennis Hall of Fame in 2015.

In 2019, University High retired Robinson&#x27;s football number 44. 

==College career==
Robinson committed to play college football at LSU, in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), under head coach Paul Dietzel. From 1957 to 1959, he would become one of the greatest two-way players in team history. In his junior season,1958, the Tigers won all ten games in the regular season. Then, on January 1, 1959, they won the Sugar Bowl over Clemson 7–0 (making them 11-0), further winning the national championship. Billy Cannon, the 1958 Heisman Trophy winner, was also on that team. LSU went 9–2 in 1959, and again played in the Sugar Bowl, on January 1, 1960, losing to Ole Miss. Robinson had a fractured hand and did not carry the ball once in that game. 

In 1958, Robinson earned first team All-SEC honors as a halfback, and in 1959, he was second team all-conference. Over his three-year LSU career, the team was 25–7, and Robinson had 893 rushing yards, 453 receiving yards, and 14 touchdowns. In a 1958 game against Tulane, Robison had four touchdowns in the second half, and United Press International named him Back Of The Week. 

Also while at LSU, he won the 1958 SEC tennis championship in singles, and SEC doubles championship with his brother Tommy.

In 2019, Robinson was LSU&#x27;s SEC Football Legend.

==Professional career==
In 1960, Robinson was selected by the Dallas Texans (who later became the Kansas City Chiefs) in the first round of the 1960 AFL draft, and selected third overall by the Detroit Lions in the 1960 NFL draft. In his third season, the Texans won the 1962 AFL title with a 20–17 double-overtime victory over the two-time defending AFL champion Houston Oilers in the longest professional football league championship game ever played. Robinson had two interceptions. The dramatic game was watched by millions on television, and played an important part in creating the grounds for an AFL-NFL merger.

Robinson played in the first Super Bowl in early 1967, a loss to the Green Bay Packers in which Robinson had 9 tackles. Three years later in Super Bowl IV, the underdog Chiefs decisively defeated the Minnesota Vikings, 23–7. Robinson played that game with three broken ribs he received in the previous game. Late in the first half, he picked up a Minnesota fumble and made an interception in the second half to help seal the win.

During his first two years in the AFL, Robinson played flanker on offense, rushing for 658 yards on 150 carries and had 1,228 receiving yards on 77 receptions, and fifteen touchdowns. Texans coach Hank Stram moved Robinson to safety after his second year and he continued as a standout for ten of his twelve years. His last game came on Christmas Day 1971, when the Chiefs lost to the Miami Dolphins 24–27 after 22 minutes and forty seconds of overtime. Robinson suffered a career-ending injury that game, which remains the longest game in NFL history, as of 2024, and the last NFL game in Municipal Stadium. Robinson thus played in the sport&#x27;s longest championship game in 1962 and in its absolute longest game, each game closing out professional football in its respective stadium.

After twelve seasons with the same franchise, Robinson retired at age 33 in July 1972, prior to training camp.

== Legacy ==
Robinson was a seven-time first-team All-Pro and three-time second-team All-Pro selection. He is a member of the All-time All-AFL Team and one of only 20 players who were in the AFL for its entire ten-year existence. He is one of only three players (with hall of famers Jim Otto and Ron Mix) who were on the All-AFL first team and the combined AFL/NFL all decade team for the 1960s.

The Chiefs had a 35–1–1 record in games that Robinson made an interception. He is an inductee of the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame, and was elected into the Pro Football Hall Of Fame in February , the ninth member inducted from the 1969 Chiefs; his bust at Canton was sculpted by Scott Myers. Later that year, he was recognized as an SEC Football Legend for LSU. He is also a member of the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame.

==Career statistics==


==Personal and later life==
After he retired as a player, Robinson was a scout for the Chiefs until Hank Stram was fired in 1974. He then coached defensive backs for the Jacksonville Express of the World Football League in 1975. The league folded that year, and he became a scout for the New Orleans Saints, again under Stram.

Robinson became an ordained minister in 1979. He founded and operates a youth home called Johnny Robinson&#x27;s Boys Home for troubled boys in Monroe, Louisiana, and has been a long-time supporter of children&#x27;s causes.

<text>Louis Philippe, comte de Ségur (10 December 175327 August 1830) was a French diplomat and historian.

==Biography==
Ségur was born in Paris, the son of Philippe Henri, marquis de Ségur and Louise Anne Madeleine de Vernon. He entered the army in 1769, served in the American War of Independence in 1781 as a colonel under Rochambeau.

In 1784 he was sent as minister plenipotentiary to Saint Petersburg, where he was received into the intimacy of the empress Catherine II and wrote some comedies for her theatre. At Saint Petersburg he concluded (in January 1787) a commercial treaty which was exceedingly advantageous to France. The same year he accompanied Catherine II in her journey to the Crimea. He returned to Paris in 1789.

Ségur took up a sympathetic attitude towards the Revolution at its outset and in 1791 was sent on a mission to Berlin, where he was badly received. After fighting a duel he was forced to leave Berlin, and went into retirement until 1801 when, at Bonaparte&#x27;s command, he was nominated by the senate to the Corps Législatif. Subsequently he became a member of the council of state, grand master of the ceremonies, and senator, 1813. In 1814 Ségur voted for the deposition of Napoleon and entered Louis XVIII&#x27;s Chamber of Peers. Deprived of his offices and functions in 1815 for joining Napoleon during the Hundred Days, he was reinstated in 1819, supported the Revolution of 1830, but died shortly afterwards in Paris.

Ségur married on 30 April 1777 Antoinette Élisabeth d&#x27;Aguesseau, who also died in Paris, and had three sons and one daughter:
* Laure Antoinette de Ségur (11 April 177815 July 1812), married Louis Auguste Vallet de La Touche, baron de Villeneuve, marquis du Blanc (Paris, 4 February 1779le Blanc, Indre, 24 December 1837), and had issue
* Octave-Henri Gabriel, comte de Ségur (Paris, 5 June 1779Paris, 15 August 1818), soldier and famous suicide
* Philippe Paul, comte de Ségur (Paris, 4 November 1780Paris, 25 February 1873), general and historian
* Olivier Alexandre de Ségur (3 October 17904 May 1791)

Losco has been involved in advertising in her country, including for Guess, McDonald&#x27;s Salad Plus, and Vodafone&#x27;s Music Jam Campaign.

Losco won the Maltese national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 on 23 January, with the song &quot;Walk On Water&quot;. On 31 July 2018, it was announced that Losco will be a judge on Malta&#x27;s version of &quot;The X Factor&quot;. On the same year, Ira Losco published her double album &quot;No Sinner No Saint&quot; to commemorate her 15th year in the music industry.

== Eurovision Song Contest ==

Losco represented Malta at the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 with the song &quot;7th Wonder&quot;. She finished runner up, just 12 points behind eventual winner Marie N, which was Malta&#x27;s highest result ever in the competition until it was equalled in 2005.

In December 2015, it was revealed that Losco had submitted two songs for the Malta Eurovision Song Contest 2016, the country&#x27;s national selection process. Her entries &quot;Chameleon&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s why I love you&quot; were both shortlisted for the semifinal, with &quot;Chameleon&quot; qualifying for the final. On 23 January, Losco won the national selection with over 40% of the votes cast by the Maltese public.

Following Losco&#x27;s win at the Malta Eurovision Song Contest 2016, she stated that she was open to the idea of performing a song other than &quot;Chameleon&quot; at Eurovision, should it improve Malta&#x27;s chances of winning. The national final rules, set by PBS, allow for the winning song to be partially modified or completely changed. On 19 February 2016, PBS announced that an international jury consisting of representatives from ten countries, along with local experts from Malta, would be presented with several songs, including a revamped version of &quot;Chameleon&quot;, and would determine which song Losco would perform at the contest. On 14 March it was announced that she would perform the song &quot;Walk on Water&quot;. The song and video were released on 17 March 2016.

The dress she wore for the contest was by Alex Zabotto-Bentley, who has also designed for Lady Gaga, Prince and Kylie Minogue. In order to increase the chances of winning the contest, the budget was increased drastically, from minimum €200,000 in a previous given year to an approximate maximum of €1,500,000 during Losco&#x27;s participation in 2016. In the first semi-final, on 10 May 2016, &quot;Walk on Water&quot; qualified for the Eurovision final. In the final on Saturday 14 May 2016, she placed 12th out of 26 countries.

== Awards ==
== Personal life ==
In May 2016, it was announced that Losco and her partner, Sean Gravina, were expecting a baby. Their son, Harry, was born on 25 August 2016. On 1 December 2019, Ira and Sean got married. In June 2020, Losco announced that together with her husband and son, they were expecting a baby girl. Their daughter, Gigi, was born on 14 November 2020.

== Activism ==
Losco has publicly expressed her support for a number of social causes in Malta, including LGBT rights and anti-bullying campaigns amongst teenagers. In 2014, she was nominated for the first LGBTI Community Awards organised by the Malta Gay Rights Movement. Losco supports equal rights and acceptance, rather than just tolerance, in the context that her country, Malta, has been known as the best country in Europe and the world in LGBTQI rights. Losco organised an LGBT friendly party in Stockholm during the Eurovision Song Contest 2016.

<doc id="330259" wikidata="Q1575579" url="?curid=330259" title="Hank Stram">
<text>Henry Louis Stram (; January 3, 1923 – July 4, 2005) was an American football coach. He is best known for his 15-year tenure with the Dallas Texans / Kansas City Chiefs of the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL).

Stram won three AFL championships, more than any other coach in the league&#x27;s history. He then won Super Bowl IV with the Chiefs. He also coached the most victories (87), had the most post-season games (7) and the best post-season record in the AFL (5–2). Stram is largely responsible for the introduction of Gatorade to the NFL due to his close association with Ray Graves, coach at the University of Florida during Gatorade&#x27;s development and infancy. Stram never had an offensive coordinator, defensive coordinator, or special teams coach during his career with the Chiefs.

==Early life==
Stram was born in Chicago as Henry Louis Wilczek on January 3, 1923. His Polish-born father, Henry Wilczek, a tailor, had wrestled professionally under the name Stramm, the German word for &quot;sturdy,&quot; and the family&#x27;s surname was eventually changed to Stram. He later grew up in Gary, Indiana, and graduated from Lew Wallace High School class of 1941. (The football stadium press box was renamed in his honor.) He earned seven letters playing football and baseball and joined the Sigma Chi fraternity at Purdue in the 1940s, playing in 1942 and again in 1946 and 1947. Stram served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, interrupting his university career.

==Coaching career==
===Early jobs===
He was an assistant football coach for the Boilermakers from 1948 to 1955 and the head baseball coach from 1951 to 1955. In 1996, Stram and Len Dawson were inducted into the Purdue Athletic Hall of Fame. After coaching at Purdue, Stram was an assistant at Notre Dame, Southern Methodist University, and Miami. Stram was Miami&#x27;s backfield coach and credited with installing the multiple offense that helped lead the team to a 6–4 record in 1959.

===Dallas Texans / Kansas City Chiefs===
In 1959, Lamar Hunt recruited Stram to coach his Dallas Texans in the new AFL, which commenced play in 1960. Hunt had previously been a bench player at SMU when Stram had been coaching there and the Texans&#x27; position had been turned down by Oklahoma Sooners head coach Bud Wilkinson and New York Giants defensive coordinator Tom Landry. The Texans played their first game in the new AFL in September 1960 and proved to be successful from the beginning.

In 1962, the Texans won the AFL Western Division and the AFL championship. The Texans won the championship against the Houston Oilers 20–17 in what was the longest professional football championship game ever played. Tommy Brooker kicked a field goal at 17:54 of overtime to win the game for the Texans and stop the Oilers from winning their third straight title.

The Dallas Texans became the Kansas City Chiefs in 1963 and continued their success. In 1966, they won the AFL title again on the back of one of the best defensive teams in the history of professional football featuring three hall of famers and eight all star players. The Chiefs defeated the Buffalo Bills 31–7 in Buffalo. The Chiefs played the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl I with the Packers winning 35–10. To overcome the Chiefs&#x27; defense, Packers&#x27; coach Vince Lombardi used a short passing game which proved successful, with quarterback Bart Starr becoming the first Super Bowl MVP.

In a 1968 game against the Oakland Raiders in Kansas City, the Chiefs entered the game without a healthy wide receiver ready to play. Stram went in to pro football&#x27;s past and resurrected the T formation. The Chiefs won the game 24–10 running the ball 60 times for over 300 yards while passing only three times for 16 yards.

The Kansas City Chiefs won the AFL championship again in 1969. In Super Bowl IV, his ingenious innovations, the &quot;moving pocket&quot; and the &quot;triple-stack defense&quot;, dominated the Minnesota Vikings on both sides of the ball. In the Super Bowl, Stram became the first professional football coach to wear a microphone. Stram&#x27;s recorded comments from that game have become classics: &quot;Just keep matriculatin&#x27; the ball down the field, boys.&quot;, &quot;How could all six of you miss that play?&quot; &quot;65 Toss Power Trap&quot;, &quot;Kassulke was running around there like it was a Chinese fire drill&quot;, and his assessment of the Vikings&#x27; confusion and ineffective play: &quot;They look like they&#x27;re flat as hell.&quot;. In the clip where he asks an official &quot;How could all six of you miss that play?&quot; the official&#x27;s response, not about the play, but about Stram not being allowed on the field during a game, leads the confused Stram to mutter, &quot;No. What?&quot; The Super Bowl victory was the second straight by a team from the AFL and added credibility to the newer league, which would complete a planned merger with the NFL the following season.

In 1971, the Chiefs won the AFC West championship. The Miami Dolphins defeated the Chiefs on Christmas Day 1971. The teams played the longest game in the history of professional football. After that, the Chiefs did not enjoy the same success, resulting in Stram leaving the franchise. Stram&#x27;s tenure in Kansas City ended with a 35–15 loss at home to the same Viking team the Chiefs defeated in Super Bowl IV.

Following a 5–9 finish in the 1974 season, which was at the time the worst record in franchise history (and only the third losing season it had suffered), Stram was fired.

Stram&#x27;s 129 victories were the most in Chiefs history until 2023 when Andy Reid surpassed him with his 130th win.

===New Orleans Saints===
Stram became the head coach of the New Orleans Saints in 1976, but posted losing records in his two seasons, 4–10 and 3–11. Hampering Stram&#x27;s efforts to rebuild the typically struggling Saints was a severe elbow injury to quarterback Archie Manning, who missed the entire 1976 season and parts of the 1977 campaign. Stram also had to deal with continuous discipline problems caused by his leading rusher, Chuck Muncie, who was in the early stages of a cocaine addiction which would lead to his trade in 1980 from New Orleans to the San Diego Chargers.

Perhaps the biggest highlight of his New Orleans tenure was a 27–17 win over his former team, the Kansas City Chiefs, at Arrowhead Stadium in 1976, Stram&#x27;s first victory with the Saints. The 1977 campaign culminated in an historic home loss to the previously winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers who were riding a 26-game losing streak over two seasons. Stram took the loss hard, burning the game film. He was fired after the final game of the season.

===Legacy===
Stram was an innovator, a shrewd judge of talent, and an excellent teacher. He helped develop Hall of Famers Len Dawson, Bobby Bell, Buck Buchanan, Curley Culp, Willie Lanier, Jan Stenerud, Emmitt Thomas, and Johnny Robinson, and others like Ed Budde and Otis Taylor. He would take players that had been unsuccessful on other teams, such as Len Dawson, who had failed to catch on with both the Steelers and the Browns, and help them develop their potential. Stram recruited heavily from historically black colleges, so his teams were always diverse, and he also instituted weight-training and off-season mini-camps. He was also the first coach in professional football to use Gatorade on his sidelines and run both the I formation and two-tight end offense, still used in professional football today. On defense, the Chiefs employed a triple-stack defense, hiding the three linebackers behind defensive linemen.

He was considered a motivational genius, and his emphasis on the Chiefs&#x27; wearing of a patch commemorating the AFL in Super Bowl IV was one of his typical ploys, extracting maximum effort from players who had been derided by proponents of the NFL. Stram was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2003, nine years &quot;after&quot; Bud Grant, the man whose team he had convincingly defeated in Super Bowl IV, had been enshrined. At the Hall of Fame ceremonies, Stram was so weakened by the effects of diabetes that Len Dawson pushed his former coach onto the stage in a wheelchair. Stram&#x27;s induction speech was then played from a previously recorded videotape.

Stram was the only head coach who lasted the entire history of the AFL (1960 – 1969).

==Broadcasting career==
Following his retirement from coaching, Stram enjoyed a long and successful career as a color commentator on CBS&#x27; television and radio broadcasts of NFL games. Stram began broadcasting games for CBS in 1975, originally calling games with Frank Glieber. After a brief hiatus so he could return to coaching, Stram returned to call games with Gary Bender in 1978. His other broadcast partners were Jack Buck, Vin Scully, Curt Gowdy, Dick Stockton, Tim Brant, Steve Zabriskie, Jim Henderson, Sean McDonough, and Jim Nantz, along with various others. From 1979 through 1989 he called the Tampa Bay Buccaneers&#x27; preseason football games for WTOG-TV in Tampa, Florida, and from 1993 through 1996 he called preseason Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders&#x27; games for KCAL.

As a broadcaster, Stram is best remembered for his near-20-year stint (beginning in 1978 and lasting through the 1995 season) with Jack Buck on CBS Radio broadcasts of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games. Stram&#x27;s key broadcasting trademark was his habit of predicting the next play before it happened.

On January 10, 1982, Stram, along with Vin Scully, called the famous NFC Championship Game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys. The game in question was immortalized by Dwight Clark&#x27;s touchdown catch which elevated the 49ers into their first Super Bowl appearance (the first of four during the 1980s).

During a 1988 broadcasting trip to Indianapolis for a Chicago Bears–Colts game, Stram collapsed with a severely blocked aortic valve and underwent open heart surgery. He was hospitalized in Indianapolis for a week and later resumed his career with CBS.

He remained a part of CBS&#x27; television broadcast team until 1993. His last game as a broadcaster was Super Bowl XXX for CBS Radio in 1996.

==Personal life==
Stram married Phyllis Marie Pesha in 1953 and they stayed together as husband and wife until his death due to complications from diabetes in 2005. They had six children, four sons and two daughters, including actor Henry Stram. 

===Later life and death===
Stram made a guest appearance as himself on the TV show &quot;Coach&quot;. In the episode, Stram was attending a coaching convention with fellow coaches Barry Switzer and George Allen. Hayden Fox, the fictional protagonist of the show, also attended the conference.

Hank Stram retired to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he built a home in the town of Covington. He died at St. Tammany Parish hospital in Covington, from complications due to diabetes, on July 4, 2005.

<doc id="330264" wikidata="Q187912" url="?curid=330264" title="Lamar Hunt">
<text>Lamar Hunt Sr. (August 2, 1932 – December 13, 2006) was an American businessman most notable for his promotion of football, soccer, and tennis in the United States. With his brothers, he also attempted to corner the silver market.

He was the principal founder of the American Football League (AFL) and Major League Soccer (MLS), as well as MLS&#x27;s predecessor, the North American Soccer League (NASL), and co-founder of World Championship Tennis. He was also the founder and owner of the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL), the Kansas City Wizards of MLS, and at the time of his death owned two other MLS teams, Columbus Crew and FC Dallas. In Kansas City, Hunt also helped establish the Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun theme parks.

The oldest ongoing national soccer tournament in the United States, the U.S. Open Cup (founded 1914), now bears his name in honor of his pioneering role in that sport stateside. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1972; into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1982; and into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1993 for his contribution to the birth of professional Open Era tennis.

The National Soccer Hall of Fame bestowed upon Hunt their Medal of Honor in 1999, an award given to only three recipients in history thus far. He was married for 42 years to his second wife Norma, and had four children, Sharron, Lamar Jr., Daniel, and Clark Hunt.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hunt was born in El Dorado, Arkansas, US, on August 2, 1932. He was the son of oil tycoon H. L. Hunt and younger brother of tycoons Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt. Lamar was raised in Dallas, Texas. He attended Culver Military Academy and graduated from The Hill School in Pennsylvania in 1951 and Southern Methodist University in Dallas in 1956, with a B.S. degree in geology. Hunt was a college football player who rode the bench but was still an avid sports enthusiast during his time in college and throughout his entire childhood. While attending SMU in 1952, Hunt joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity. In 1972, he was selected as Kappa Sigma&#x27;s Man of the Year.

===Founding of the American Football League===
On the strength of his great inherited oil wealth, Hunt applied for a National Football League expansion franchise but was turned down. In 1959, professional American football was a distant second to Major League Baseball in popularity, and the thinking among NFL executives was that the league must be careful not to &quot;oversaturate&quot; the market by expanding too quickly. Hunt also attempted to purchase the NFL&#x27;s Chicago Cardinals (now based in Arizona) franchise in 1959 with the intention to move them to Dallas, but was again turned down (the team moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1960).

In response, Hunt approached several other businessmen who had also unsuccessfully sought NFL franchises, including fellow Texan and oilman Bud Adams of Houston, about forming a new football league, and the American Football League was established in August 1959. The group of the eight founders of the AFL teams was referred to as the &quot;Foolish Club&quot;. Hunt&#x27;s goal was to bring professional football to Texas and to acquire an NFL team for the Hunt family. Hunt became an owner of the Dallas Texans and hired future hall-of-Famer Hank Stram as the team&#x27;s first head coach. The team, along with the AFL, began play in 1960.

===Ownership and NFL merger===
As a response to the newly formed league and the presence of an AFL franchise in Dallas, the NFL quickly placed a new franchise of their own in Dallas, the Dallas Cowboys, who also began play in 1960. As a result, the Dallas Texans, despite being one of the more successful AFL teams in the league&#x27;s early days, had little luck at the gate, as they had to compete with the Cowboys for fans.

By the end of the 1962 season, Hunt concluded that Dallas was not big enough to support two teams, and began to consider moving the team. Kansas City became one of the contenders, as Hunt wanted a city to which he could easily commute from Dallas. To convince Hunt to move the team to Kansas City, mayor H. Roe Bartle promised Hunt home attendance of 25,000 people per game: Hunt finally agreed to move the team to Kansas City, and in 1963 the Dallas Texans were rebranded the Kansas City Chiefs.

While the Chiefs&#x27; first two seasons had attendance not matching the levels Mayor Bartle had promised, in 1966 average home attendance at Chiefs games increased and reached 37,000. By 1969, Chiefs&#x27; average home attendance had reached 51,000. In 1966, the Chiefs won their first AFL Championship (after having previously won it as the Dallas Texans) and reached the first-ever Super Bowl, which the Chiefs lost to the Green Bay Packers. The Chiefs remained successful through the 1960s, and in 1970 the Chiefs won the AFL Championship and Super Bowl IV (the last Super Bowl played when the AFL was a separate league, prior to it being absorbed into the NFL as the American Football Conference) over the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings.

Hunt insisted that he be listed in team media guides as the &quot;founder&quot; of the Chiefs rather than the &quot;owner&quot;, and publicly listed his telephone number in the phone book for the rest of his life. From 1960 to 2005, the Chiefs reached the postseason fourteen times with Hunt as founder, with nine coming after 1971. The Chiefs reached the AFC Championship Game to compete for the trophy named in 1984 after Hunt on one occasion during his lifetime, losing in 1993.

===Coinage of the term &quot;Super Bowl&quot;===

In 1966, the NFL and AFL agreed to merge, with a championship game between the two leagues to be played after that season. In a July 25, 1966, letter to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Hunt wrote, &quot;I have kiddingly called it the &#x27;Super Bowl,&#x27; which obviously can be improved upon.&quot; Hunt would later say the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a Super Ball toy. Although the leagues&#x27; owners decided on the name &quot;AFL-NFL Championship Game&quot;, the media immediately picked up on Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Super Bowl&quot; name, which would become official beginning with the third annual game in 1969, which was won by the AFL&#x27;s New York Jets over the NFL&#x27;s Baltimore Colts.

===The NASL: ownership and battles with the NFL===
In 1967 Hunt helped promote professional soccer in the United States. Hunt&#x27;s interest in soccer began in 1962 when he accompanied his future wife, Norma, to a Shamrock Rovers game in Dublin, Ireland. In 1966, he viewed the FIFA World Cup in England, and then attended nine of the next 11 World Cup tournaments.

In 1967, Hunt founded the Dallas Tornado as members of the United Soccer Association. In 1968 the league merged with the National Professional Soccer League to form the North American Soccer League. Hunt was an active advocate for the sport and the league and the Dallas Tornado won the NASL championship in 1971 and were runners-up in 1973.

The NFL owners were not happy with Hunt&#x27;s ownership in and promotion of pro soccer. The NFL attempted to force legal requirements that would disallow team ownership in more than one sport for owners of NFL franchises. This strategy backfired on the NFL, and the NASL won an anti-trust case against the NFL. A primary benefactor of this outcome was Lamar Hunt.

In 1981, after 15 seasons and losses in the millions, Hunt and his Dallas Tornado partner Bill McNutt decided to merge their team with the Tampa Bay Rowdies franchise, while retaining a minority stake in the Florida club. Two years later, along with Rowdies principal George Strawbrige, they sold the Rowdies to local investors. The move effectively ended Hunt&#x27;s ties to the NASL a year before the league itself finally collapsed in 1984.

===Major League Soccer===
Hunt returned to soccer as one of the original founding investors of Major League Soccer, which debuted in 1996. He originally owned two teams: the Columbus Crew and the Kansas City Wizards (now Sporting Kansas City). In 1999, Hunt financed the construction of the venue now known as Historic Crew Stadium, the second, and first since 1913, of several large soccer-specific stadiums in the USA. In 2003, Hunt purchased a third team, the Dallas Burn (now FC Dallas), after announcing that he would partially finance the construction of their own soccer-specific stadium. On August 31, 2006, Hunt sold the Wizards to a six-man ownership group led by Cerner Corporation co-founders Neal Patterson and Cliff Illig.

===Tennis===
In 1968, Hunt co-founded the World Championship Tennis circuit, which gave birth to the Open Era of tennis. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1993.

==Business ventures outside sports==
===Amusement parks and caves===
Hunt was the founder of two theme parks in Kansas City: Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun, which opened in 1973 and 1982 respectively. The two parks were an outgrowth and adjoined a vast industrial park he developed in the bluffs above the Missouri River in Clay County, Missouri.

Immediately south of the Hunt-founded parks is the Hunt-developed SubTropolis, a 55 million-square-foot (5.06 million m2), manmade limestone cave which is claimed to be the World&#x27;s Largest Underground Business Complex (TM). Hunt&#x27;s extensive business dealings in Clay County contributed to the Chiefs having their NFL Training Camp at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri until 1991.

===Hunt Brothers Silver speculation===
During the 1970s and early 1980s, Hunt and his brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt attempted to corner the silver market. They began buying silver in the early 1970s. By the end of 1979, their ownership of one-third of the world silver market caused the price to rise from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to $50 an ounce in January 1980. In the last nine months of 1979, the brothers profited by an estimated $2 billion to $4 billion. However, on March 27, 1980, subsequently referred to within the precious-metals industry as Silver Thursday, the price collapsed. In September 1988, the Hunt brothers filed for bankruptcy under the United States Bankruptcy Code Chapter 11.

==Personal life==

Hunt had three brothers, Haroldson Lafayette Hunt, Jr, Nelson Bunker and William Herbert. His half-sister Swanee Hunt was Ambassador to Austria.

Married twice, Hunt first married Rosemary Carr. The pair met in Dallas as teenagers, went to Southern Methodist University together and married in 1956. Together they had two children Lamar Jr. and Sharron Hunt. The pair divorced in 1962, due in part to Hunt&#x27;s travel schedule.

In 1964, he married his second wife Norma, who was a schoolteacher and hostess for the Dallas Texans, to whom he remained married until his death. They had two sons, Clark and Daniel. Norma Hunt was one of the few people and the only woman to attend every Super Bowl, from 1967 until her death in June 2023.

==Death and succession==
Hunt died December 13, 2006, at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas of complications related to prostate cancer, having been hospitalized for weeks. He was 74 years old. Upon his death, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones called Hunt &quot;a founder of the NFL as we know it today,&quot; adding &quot;He&#x27;s been an inspiration for me.&quot; Said Dan Rooney, chairman of the Pittsburgh Steelers: &quot;Lamar Hunt was one of the most influential owners in professional football over the past 40-plus years, He was instrumental in the formation of the American Football League and in the AFL-NFL merger, which helped the National Football League grow into America&#x27;s passion.&quot; The mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, Kay Waldo Barnes, requested that all city flags fly at half-staff the following Thursday and Friday after Hunt&#x27;s death.

Upon Hunt&#x27;s death, his son Clark was named the chairman of the Kansas City Chiefs and FC Dallas, having been elected by Hunt&#x27;s other children, Lamar Hunt Jr., Sharron Munson, and Daniel Hunt. Though Hunt&#x27;s wife and children shared legal ownership of the Chiefs, Clark represents the team at all league owner meetings and handles the day-to-day responsibilities of the team.

<text>A visa (; also known as visa stamp) is a conditional authorization granted by a polity to a foreigner that allows them to enter, remain within, or leave its territory. Visas typically include limits on the duration of the foreigner&#x27;s stay, areas within the country they may enter, the dates they may enter, the number of permitted visits, or if the individual can work in the country in question. Visas are associated with the request for permission to enter a territory and thus are, in most countries, distinct from actual formal permission for an alien to enter and remain in the country. In each instance, a visa is subject to entry permission by an immigration official at the time of actual entry and can be revoked at any time. Visa evidence most commonly takes the form of a sticker endorsed in the applicant&#x27;s passport or other travel document but may also exist electronically. Some countries no longer issue physical visa evidence, instead recording details only in immigration databases.

Some countries require that their citizens, and sometimes foreign travelers, obtain an exit visa in order to be allowed to leave the country. Until 2004, foreign students in Russia were issued only an entry visa on being accepted to University there, and had to obtain an exit visa to return home. This policy has since been changed, and foreign students are now issued multiple entry (and exit) visas.

Historically, immigration officials were empowered to permit or reject entry of visitors on arrival at the frontiers. If permitted entry, the official would issue a visa, when required, which would be a stamp in a passport. Today, travellers wishing to enter another country must often apply in advance for what is also called a visa, sometimes in person at a consular office, by post, or over the Internet. The modern visa may be a sticker or a stamp in the passport, an electronic record of the authorization, or a separate document which the applicant can print before entering and produce on entry to the visited polity. Some countries do not require visitors to apply for a visa in advance for short visits.

Visa applications in advance of arrival give countries a chance to consider the applicant&#x27;s circumstances, such as financial security, reason for travel, and details of previous visits to the country. Visitors may also be required to undergo and pass security or health checks upon arrival at the port of entry.

Some polities which restrict emigration require individuals to possess an exit visa to leave the polity. These exit visas may be required for citizens, foreigners, or both, depending on the policies of the polity concerned. Unlike ordinary visas, exit visas are often seen as an illegitimate intrusion on individuals&#x27; right to freedom of movement. The imposition of an exit visa requirement may be seen to violate customary international law, as the right to leave any country is provided for in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Uniquely, the Norwegian special territory of Svalbard is an entirely visa-free zone under the terms of the Svalbard Treaty. Some countries—such as those in the Schengen Area—have agreements with other countries allowing each other&#x27;s citizens to travel between them without visas. In 2015, the World Tourism Organization announced that the number of tourists requiring a visa before travelling was at its lowest level ever.

== History ==
The history of passports dates back several centuries, originating from early travel documents used to ensure safe passage across regions. One of the earliest known references to a passport-like document comes from 445 BC in Persia, where officials were provided letters by the king for safe travel. Similarly, during the Han Dynasty in China, documents were required at checkpoints to verify travelers&#x27; identities. In medieval Europe, rulers issued &quot;safe conduct&quot; letters that protected travelers. In 1414, during the reign of King Henry V of England, passports became more formalized, allowing foreigners and citizens to travel safely within England. The 19th century saw an increase in international travel due to the Industrial Revolution, which led to the widespread adoption of passports, particularly for managing the movement of migrant workers.

In Western Europe in the late 19th century and early 20th century, passports and visas were not generally necessary for moving from one country to another. The relatively high speed and large movements of people travelling by train would have caused bottlenecks if regular passport controls had been used. Passports and visas became usually necessary as travel documents only after World War I.

After World War I, passports became essential for international travel. The League of Nations convened conferences in the 1920s to standardise passports, setting the foundation for modern versions. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) took over regulation in 1947, leading to machine-readable passports and, eventually, biometric passports in the late 20th century, offering enhanced security and speed in processing travelers.

== Issuing authorities ==

Some visas can be granted on arrival or by prior application at the country&#x27;s embassy or consulate, or through a private visa service specialist who is specialized in the issuance of international travel documents. These agencies are authorized by the foreign authority, embassy, or consulate to represent international travellers who are unable or unwilling to travel to the embassy and apply in person. Private visa and passport services collect an additional fee for verifying customer applications, supporting documents, and submitting them to the appropriate authority. If there is no embassy or consulate in one&#x27;s home country, then one would have to travel to a third country (or apply by post) and try to get a visa issued there. Alternatively, in such cases visas may be pre-arranged for collection on arrival at the border. The need or absence of need of a visa generally depends on the citizenship of the applicant, the intended duration of the stay, and the activities that the applicant may wish to undertake in the country he or she visits; these may delineate different formal categories of visas, with different issue conditions.

The issuing authority, usually a branch of the country&#x27;s foreign ministry or department (e.g. U.S. State Department), and typically consular affairs officers, may request appropriate documentation from the applicant. This may include proof that the applicant is able to support him or herself in the host country (lodging, food), proof that the person hosting the applicant in his or her home really exists and has sufficient room for hosting the applicant, proof that the applicant has obtained health and evacuation insurance, etc. Some countries ask for proof of health status, especially for long-term visas; some countries deny such visas to persons with certain illnesses, such as HIV/AIDS. The exact conditions depend on the country and category of visa. Notable examples of countries requiring HIV tests of long-term residents are Russia and Uzbekistan. In Uzbekistan, however, the HIV test requirement is sometimes not strictly enforced. Other countries require a medical test that includes an HIV test, even for a short-term tourism visa. For example, Cuban citizens and international exchange students require such a test approved by a medical authority to enter Chilean territory.

The issuing authority may also require applicants to attest that they have no criminal convictions, or that they do not participate in certain activities (like prostitution or drug trafficking). Some countries will deny visas if passports show evidence of citizenship of, or travel to, a country that is considered hostile by that country. For example, some Arabic-oriented countries will not issue visas to nationals of Israel and those whose passports bear evidence of visiting Israel.

Many countries frequently demand strong evidence of intent to return to the home country, if the visa is for a temporary stay, due to potential unwanted illegal immigration. Proof of ties to the visa applicant&#x27;s country of residence is often demanded to demonstrate a sufficient incentive to return. This can include things such as documented evidence of employment, bank statements, property ownership, and family ties.

== Visa policies ==
The main reasons states impose visa restrictions on foreign nationals are to curb illegal immigration, security concerns, and reciprocity for visa restrictions imposed on their own nationals. Typically, nations impose visa restrictions on citizens of poorer countries, along with politically unstable and undemocratic ones, as it is considered more likely that people from these countries will seek to illegally immigrate. Visa restrictions may also be imposed when nationals of another country are perceived as likelier to be terrorists or criminals, or by autocratic regimes that perceive foreign influence to be a threat to their rule. According to Professor Eric Neumayer of the London School of Economics:

The poorer, the less democratic, and the more exposed to armed political conflict the target country is, the more likely that visa restrictions are in place against its passport holders. The same is true for countries whose nationals have been major perpetrators of terrorist acts in the past.

Some countries apply the principle of reciprocity in their visa policy. Visa reciprocity is a principle in international relations where two countries agree to give each other&#x27;s citizens similar treatment when it comes to visa requirements. For example visa reciprocity is a central principle of the EU&#x27;s common visa policy. The EU aims to achieve full visa reciprocity with non-EU countries whose citizens can travel to the EU without a visa. For example, when in 2009, Canada reintroduced visa requirements for Czech nationals, arguing it was necessary due to a surge in asylum applications, it raised concerns within the EU about the implications for the common visa policy, the importance of reciprocity in maintaining good relations and ensuring equal treatment for citizens of member states.

Government authorities usually impose administrative entry restrictions on foreign citizens in three ways – countries whose nationals may enter without a visa, countries whose nationals may obtain a visa on arrival, and countries whose nationals require a visa in advance. Nationals who require a visa in advance are usually advised to obtain them at a diplomatic mission of their destination country. Several countries allow nationals of countries that require a visa to obtain them online.

The following table lists visa policies of all countries by the number of foreign nationalities that may enter that country for tourism without a visa or by obtaining a visa on arrival with normal passport. It also notes countries that issue electronic visas to certain nationalities. Symbol &quot;+&quot; indicates a country that limits the visa-free regime negatively by only listing nationals who require a visa, thus the number represents the number of UN member states reduced by the number of nationals who require a visa and &quot;+&quot; stands for all possible non-UN member state nationals that might also not require a visa. &quot;N/A&quot; indicates countries that have contradictory information on its official websites or information supplied by the Government to IATA. Some countries that allow visa on arrival do so only at a limited number of entry points. Some countries such as the European Union member states have a qualitatively different visa regime between each other as it also includes freedom of movement.

=== Visa exemption agreements ===

Possession of a valid visa is a condition for entry into many countries, and exemption schemes exist. In some cases visa-free entry may be granted to holders of diplomatic passports even as visas are required by normal passport holders (&quot;see: Passport&quot;).

Some countries have reciprocal agreements such that a visa is not needed under certain conditions, e.g., when the visit is for tourism and for a relatively short period. Such reciprocal agreements may stem from common membership in international organizations or a shared heritage:
* All citizens of European Union (EU) and EFTA member countries can travel to and stay in all other EU and EFTA countries without a visa. See Four Freedoms (European Union) and Citizenship of the European Union.
* British and Irish citizens are entitled the right to travel to and stay in each other&#x27;s countries without visas or restrictions under the Common Travel Area.
* Citizens of countries in the Common Travel Area (CTA) do not need visas to travel to and stay in other countries in the CTA.
* The United States Visa Waiver Program allows citizens of 41 countries to travel to the United States without a visa (although a pre-trip entry permission, ESTA, is needed).
* Citizens of Canada and the United States do not require a visa to travel between the two countries. Historically, verbal declaration of citizenship, or, if requested by an officer, the presentation of one of over 8,000 different types of documents indicating US or Canadian citizenship was sufficient in order to cross the border. Since the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative came into effect in 2009, a passport, border crossing card, or enhanced driver&#x27;s license is now required in order to enter the US from Canada by land, or a passport by air.
* Any Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) citizen can enter and stay as long as required in any other GCC member state.
* All citizens of members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), excluding those defined by law as undesirable aliens, may enter and stay without a visa in any member state for a maximum period of 90 days. The only requirement is a valid travel document and international vaccination certificates.
* Nationals of the East African Community member states do not need visas for entry into any of the member states.
* Some countries in the Commonwealth do not require tourist visas of citizens of other Commonwealth countries.
* Citizens of member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations do not require tourist visas to visit another member state, with the exception of Malaysia and Myanmar; both countries require citizens of the other country to have an eVisa to visit. Until 2009, Burmese citizens were required to have visas to enter all other ASEAN countries. Following the implementation of visa exemption agreements with the other ASEAN countries, in 2016 Burmese citizens are only required to have visas to enter Malaysia.
* Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) member states mutually allow their citizens to enter visa-free, at least for short stays. There are exceptions between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
* Nepal and India allow their citizens to enter, live, and work in each other&#x27;s countries due to the Indo-Nepal friendship treaty of 1951. Indians do not require a visa or passport to travel to Bhutan and are only required to obtain passes at the border checkpoints, whilst Bhutan nationals holding a valid Bhutanese passport are authorized to enter India without a visa.
* Citizens of Mercosur full member and associate countries can enter without a visa in any of the member and associate countries, just needing to present the ID card.

Other countries may unilaterally grant visa-free entry to nationals of certain countries to facilitate tourism, promote business, or even to cut expenses on maintaining consular posts abroad.

Some of the considerations for a country to grant visa-free entry to another country include (but are not limited to):
* being a low security risk for the country potentially granting visa-free entry
* diplomatic relationship between two countries
* conditions in the visitor&#x27;s home country as compared to the host country
* having a low risk of overstaying or violating visa terms in the country potentially granting visa-free entry

To have a smaller worldwide diplomatic staff, some countries rely on other country&#x27;s (or countries&#x27;) judgments when issuing visas. For example, Mexico allows citizens of all countries to enter without Mexican visas if they possess a valid American visa that has already been used. Costa Rica accepts valid visas of Schengen/EU countries, Canada, Japan, South Korea, and the United States (if valid for at least three months on date of arrival). The ultimate example of such reliance is the microstate of Andorra, which imposes no visa requirements of its own because it has no international airport and is inaccessible by land without passing through the territory of either France or Spain and is thus &quot;protected&quot; by the Schengen visa system.

Visa-free travel between countries also occurs in all cases where passports (or passport-replacing documents such as laissez-passer) are not needed for such travel. (&quot;For examples of passport-free travel, see International travel without passports&quot;.)

As of 2019, the &quot;Henley &amp; Partners&quot; passport index ranks the Japanese, Singaporean, and South Korean passports as the ones with the most visa exemptions by other nations, allowing holders of those passports to visit 189 countries without obtaining a visa in advance of arrival.
However, the Passport Index ranks the United Arab Emirates passport as the one with the most visa exemptions by other nations, allowing holders of this passport to visit 173 countries without obtaining a visa in advance of arrival.

=== Common area visas ===
Normally, visas are valid for entry only into the country that issued the visa. Countries that are members of regional organizations or party to regional agreements may, however, issue visas valid for entry into some or all of the member states of the organization or agreement:
* The Schengen Visa is a visa for the Schengen Area, which consists of most of the European Economic Area, plus several other adjacent countries. The visa allows visitors to stay in the Schengen Area for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. The visa is valid for tourism, family visits, and business.
* The Central American Single Visa (Visa Única Centroamericana) is a visa for Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. It was implemented by the CA-4 agreement. It allows citizens of those four countries free access to other member countries. It also allows visitors to any member country to enter another member country without having to obtain another visa.

==== Possible common visa schemes ====
Potentially, there are new common visa schemes:
* An ASEAN common visa scheme has been considered with Thailand and the &quot;CLMV&quot; countries of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam opting in earlier. After talk arose of a CLMV common visa, with Thailand being omitted, Thailand initiated and began implementation of a trial common visa with Cambodia, but cited security risks as the major hurdle. The trial run was delayed, but Thailand implemented a single visa scheme with Cambodia beginning on 27 December 2012 on a trial basis.
* A Gulf Cooperation Council single visa has been recommended as a study submitted to the council.
* The Pacific Alliance, which currently consists of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, offer a common visa for tourism purposes only in order to make it easier for nationals from countries outside of the alliance to travel through these countries by not having to apply for multiple visas.
* An East African Single Tourist Visa is under consideration by the relevant sectoral authorities under the East African Community (EAC) integration program. If approved the visa will be valid for all five partner states in the EAC (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi). Under the proposal for the visa, any new East African single visa can be issued by any partner state&#x27;s embassy. The visa proposal followed an appeal by the tourist boards of the partner states for a common visa to accelerate promotion of the region as a single tourist destination and the EAC Secretariat wants it approved before November&#x27;s World Travel Fair (or World Travel Market) in London. When approved by the East African council of ministers, tourists could apply for one country&#x27;s entry visa, which would then be applicable in all regional member states as a single entry requirement initiative. This is considered also by COMESA.
* The SADC UNIVISA (or Univisa) has been in development since Southern African Development Community (SADC) members signed a Protocol on the Development of Tourism in 1998. The Protocol outlined the Univisa as an objective so as to enable the international and regional entry and travel of visitors to occur as smoothly as possible. It was expected to become operational by the end of 2002. Its introduction was delayed and a new implementation date, the end of 2006, was announced. The univisa was originally intended to only be available, initially, to visitors from selected &quot;source markets&quot; including Australia, the Benelux countries, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It is now expected that when the Univisa is implemented, it will apply to non-SADC international (long-haul) tourists travelling to and within the region and that it will encourage multi – destination travel within the region. It is also anticipated that the Univisa will enlarge tourist market for transfrontier parks by lowering the boundaries between neighbouring countries in the parks. The visa is expected to be valid for all the countries with trans frontier parks (Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe) and some other SADC countries (Angola and Swaziland). As of 2017, universal visa is implemented by Zambia and Zimbabwe. Nationals of 65 countries and territories are eligible for visa on arrival that is valid for both countries. This visa is branded &quot;KAZA Uni-visa programme&quot; after Kavango–Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA). It is expected that other SADC countries will join the program in the future.

==== Previous common visa schemes ====
These schemes no longer operate.
* The CARICOM Visa was introduced in late 2006 and allowed visitors to travel between 10 CARICOM member states (Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago). These ten member countries had agreed to form a &quot;Single Domestic Space&quot; in which travellers would only have their passport stamped and have to submit completed, standardized entry and departure forms at the first port and country of entry. The CARICOM Visa was applicable to the nationals of all countries except CARICOM member states (other than Haiti) and associate member states, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the overseas countries, territories, or departments of these countries. The CARICOM Visa could be obtained from the Embassies/Consulates of Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago and in countries that have no CARICOM representatives, the applications forms could be obtained from the embassies and consulates of the United Kingdom. The common visa was only intended for the duration of the 2007 Cricket World Cup and was discontinued on 15 May 2007. Discussions are ongoing into instituting a revised CARICOM visa on a permanent basis in the future.
* A predecessor of the Schengen common visa was the Benelux visa. Visas issued by Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg were valid for all the three countries.

=== Entry and duration period ===
Visas can also be &quot;single-entry&quot;, which means the visa is cancelled as soon as the holder enters the country; &quot;double-entry&quot;; or &quot;multiple-entry&quot;, which permits double or multiple entries into the country with the same visa. Countries may also issue re-entry permits that allow temporarily leaving the country without invalidating the visa. Even a business visa will normally not allow the holder to work in the host country without an additional work permit.

Once issued, a visa will typically have to be used within a certain period of time.

In some countries, the validity of a visa is not the same as the authorized period of stay. The visa validity then indicates the time period when the entry is permitted into the country. For example, if a visa has been issued to begin on 1 January and to expire on 30 March, and the typical authorized period of stay in a country is 90 days, then the 90-day authorized stay starts on the day the passenger enters the country (entrance has to be between 1 January and 30 March). Thus, the latest day the traveller could conceivably stay in the issuing country is 1 July (if the traveller entered on 30 March). This interpretation of visas is common in the Americas.

With other countries, a person may not stay beyond the period of validity of their visa, which is usually set within the period of validity of their passport. The visa may also limit the total number of days the visitor may spend in the applicable territory within the period of validity. This interpretation of visa periods is common in Europe.

Once in the country, the validity period of a visa or authorized stay can often be extended for a fee at the discretion of immigration authorities. Overstaying a period of authorized stay given by the immigration officers is considered illegal immigration even if the visa validity period is not over (i.e., for multiple entry visas) and a form of being &quot;out of status&quot; and the offender may be fined, prosecuted, deported, or even blacklisted from entering the country again.

Entering a country without a valid visa or visa exemption may result in detention and removal (deportation or exclusion) from the country. Undertaking activities that are not authorized by the status of entry (for example, working while possessing a non-worker tourist status) can result in the individual being deemed liable for deportation—commonly referred to as an illegal alien. Such violation is not a violation of a visa, despite the common misuse of the phrase, but a violation of status – hence the term &quot;out of status&quot;.

Even having a visa does not guarantee entry to the host country. The border crossing authorities make the final determination to allow entry, and may even cancel a visa at the border if the alien cannot demonstrate to their satisfaction that they will abide by the status their visa grants them.

Some countries that do not require visas for short stays may require a long-stay visa for those who intend to apply for a residence permit. For example, the EU does not require a visa of citizens of many countries for stays under 90 days, but its member states require a long-stay visa of such citizens for longer stays.

==== By method of issue ====
Normally visa applications are made at and collected from a consulate, embassy, or other diplomatic mission.

===== On-arrival visas =====

Also known as visas on arrival (VOA), they are granted at a port of entry. This is distinct from visa-free entry, where no visa is required, as the visitor must still obtain the visa on arrival before proceeding to immigration control.

* Almost all countries will consider issuing a visa (or another document to the same effect) on arrival to a visitor arriving in unforeseen exceptional circumstances, for example:
** Under provisions of article 35 of the Schengen Visa Code, a visa may be issued at a border in situations such as the diversion of a flight causing air passengers in transit to pass through two or more airports instead of one. In 2010, Iceland&#x27;s Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted, causing significant disruption of air travel throughout Europe, and the EU responded by announcing that it would issue visas at land borders to stranded travellers.
** Under section 212(d)(4) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, visa waivers can be issued to travellers arriving at American ports of entry in emergency situations or under other conditions.
** Certain international airports in Russia have consuls on-duty, who have the power to issue visas on the spot.
* Some countries issue visas on arrival to special categories of travellers, such as seafarers or aircrew.
* Some countries issue them to regular visitors. There often are restrictions – for example:
** issues visas on arrival in Minsk international airport only to nationals of countries where there is no consular representation of Belarus.
** only issues visas on arrival at certain border checkpoints. The most notable crossing where visas on arrival are not issued is the Padang Besar checkpoint for passenger trains between Malaysia and Thailand.

===== Electronic visas =====
An electronic visa (e-Visa or eVisa) is stored in a computer and is linked to the passport number so no label, sticker, or stamp is placed in the passport before travel. The application is done over the internet, and the receipt acts as a visa, which can be printed or stored on a mobile device.

==== Visa extensions ====
Many countries have a mechanism to allow the holder of a visa to apply to extend a visa. In Denmark, a visa holder can apply to the Danish Immigration Service for a Residence Permit after they have arrived in the country. In the United Kingdom, applications can be made to UK Visas and Immigration.

In certain circumstances, it is impossible for the holder of the visa to do this, either because the country does not have a mechanism to prolong visas or, most likely, because the holder of the visa is using a short stay visa to live in a country.

===== Visa run =====

Some foreign visitors engage in what is known as a &quot;visa run&quot;: leaving a country—usually to a neighboring country—for a short period just before the permitted length of stay expires, then returning to the first country to get a new entry stamp in order to extend their stay (&quot;reset the clock&quot;). Despite the name, a visa run is usually done with a passport that can be used for entry without a visa.

Visa runs are frowned upon by immigration authorities as they may signify that the foreigner wishes to reside permanently and might also work in that country – purposes that are prohibited and that usually require an immigrant visa or a work visa. Immigration officers may deny re-entry to visitors suspected of engaging in prohibited activities, especially when they have done repeated visa runs and have no evidence of spending reasonable time in their home countries or countries where they have the right to reside and work.

To combat visa runs, some countries have limits on how long visitors can spend in the country without a visa, as well as how much time they have to stay out before &quot;resetting the clock&quot;. For example, Schengen countries impose a maximum of 90 days in any 180-day period. Some countries do not &quot;reset the clock&quot; when a visitor comes back after visiting a neighboring country. For example, the United States does not give visitors a new period of stay when they come back from visiting Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean; instead they are re-admitted to the United States for the remaining days granted on their initial entry. Some other countries, e.g. Thailand, allow visitors who arrive by land from neighboring countries a shorter length of stay than those who arrive by air.

In some cases, a visa run is necessary to activate new visas or change the immigration status of a person. An example would be leaving a country and then returning immediately to activate a newly issued work visa before a person can legally work.

=== Exit visas ===
Exit visas may be required to leave some countries. Many countries limit the ability of individuals to leave in certain circumstances, such as those with outstanding legal proceedings or large government debts. Despite this, the term &quot;exit visa&quot; is generally limited to countries that systematically restrict departure, where the right to leave is not automatic. Imposing a systematic requirement for exit permission may be seen to violate the right to freedom of movement, which is found in the UDHR and forms part of customary international law.

Countries implementing exit visas vary in who they require to obtain one. Some countries permit the free movement of foreign nationals while restricting their own citizens. Others may limit the exit visa requirement to resident foreigners in the country on work visas, such as in the Kafala system.

==== Asia ====
Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates all have an exit visa requirement for alien foreign workers. This is part of their &quot;kafala&quot; work visa sponsorship system. Consequently, at the end of a foreign worker&#x27;s employment period, the worker must secure clearance from their employer stating that the worker has satisfactorily fulfilled the terms of their employment contract or that the worker&#x27;s services are no longer needed. The exit visa can also be withheld if there are pending court charges that need to be settled or penalties that have to be meted out. In September 2018, Qatar lifted the exit visa requirement for most workers. Persons are generally free to leave Israel, except for those who are subject to a stay of exit order.

Nepal requires its citizens emigrating to the United States on an H-1B visa to present an exit permit issued by the Nepali Ministry of Labour. This document is called a work permit and needs to be presented to Nepali immigration to leave Nepal.

Uzbekistan was the last remaining country of the former USSR that required an exit visa, which was valid for a two-year period. The practice was abolished in 2019. There had been an explicit United Nations complaint about this practice.

North Korea requires that its citizens obtain an exit visa stating the traveller&#x27;s destination country and time to be spent abroad before leaving the country. Additionally, North Korean authorities also require North Korean citizens to obtain a re-entry visa from a North Korean embassy or North Korean mission abroad before being allowed back into North Korea.

The government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China requires its citizens to obtain a Taiwan Travel Permit issued by the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s authorities with a valid endorsement prior to visiting the Republic of China if they depart from the mainland (besides Chongqing, Nanchang or Kunming if they leave for the Republic of China for transit). The endorsement is a &quot;de facto&quot; exit visa for ROC-bound trips for mainland citizens of China.

Singapore operates an Exit Permit scheme in order to enforce the national service obligations of its male citizens and permanent residents. Requirements vary according to age and status:

Iran, Taiwan and South Korea also require male citizens who are older than a certain age but have not fulfilled their military duties to register with local Military Manpower Administration office before they pursue international travels, studies, business trips, and/or performances. Failure to do so is a felony in those countries and violators would face up to three years of imprisonment.

==== Europe ====

During the Fascist period in Italy, an exit visa was required from 1922 to 1943. Nazi Germany required exit visas from 1933 to 1945.

The Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies required exit visas both for emigration and for those who wanted to leave the Soviet Union for a shorter period.

Some countries, including the Czech Republic, require that an alien who needs a visa on entry be in possession of a valid visa upon exit. To satisfy this formal requirement, exit visas sometimes need to be issued.

Russia requires an exit visa if a visitor stays past the expiration date of their visa. They must then extend their visa or apply for an exit visa and are not allowed to leave the country until they show a valid visa or have a permissible excuse for overstaying their visa (e.g., a note from a doctor or a hospital explaining an illness, missed flight, lost or stolen visa). In some cases, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can issue a return-Home certificate that is valid for ten days from the embassy of the visitor&#x27;s native country, thus eliminating the need for an exit visa.

A foreign citizen granted a temporary residence permit in Russia needs a temporary resident visa to take a trip abroad (valid for both exit and return). It is also colloquially called an &quot;exit visa&quot;. Not all foreign citizens are subject to that requirement. Citizens of Germany, for example, do not require this exit visa.

In March 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Kingdom required everyone leaving England to fill out an exit form detailing their address, passport number, destination, and reason to travel. Permitted reasons to travel included for work or volunteering, education, medical or compassionate reasons such as weddings and funerals. Travellers may have been required to carry evidence to support their reason to travel.

==== Americas ====
Cuba dropped its exit visa requirement in January 2013.

Guatemala requires any foreigner who is a permanent resident to apply for a multiple 5-year exit visa.

===== United States =====
The United States of America does not require exit visas. Since 1 October 2007, however, the U.S. government requires &quot;all&quot; foreign and U.S. nationals &quot;departing&quot; the United States by air to hold a valid passport (or certain specific passport-replacing documents). Even though travellers might not require a passport to enter a certain country, they &quot;will&quot; require a valid passport booklet (booklet only, U.S. Passport Card not accepted) to depart the United States in order to satisfy the U.S. immigration authorities. Exemptions to this requirement to hold a valid passport include:

* U.S. Permanent Resident/Resident Alien Card (Form I-551);
* U.S. Military ID Cards when travelling on official orders;
* U.S. Merchant Mariner Card;
* NEXUS Card;
* U.S. travel document:
**Refugee Travel Document (Form I-571); or
** Permit to Re-Enter (Form I-327)
* Emergency Travel Document (e.g. Consular Letter) issued by a foreign embassy or consulate specifically for the purpose of travel to the bearer&#x27;s home country.
* Nationals of Mexico holding one of the following documents:
** (expired) &quot;Matricula Consular&quot;; or
** Birth certificate with consular registration; or
** Certificate of Nationality issued by a Mexican consulate abroad; or
** Certificate of Military Duty (&quot;Cartilla Militar&quot;); or
** Voter&#x27;s Certificate (&quot;Credencial IFE&quot; or &quot;Credencial para Votar&quot;).

In addition, green card holders and certain other aliens must obtain a certificate of compliance (also known as a &quot;sailing permit&quot; or &quot;departure permit&quot;) from the Internal Revenue Service proving that they are up-to-date with their US income tax obligations before they may leave the country. While the requirement has been in effect since 1921, it has not been stringently enforced, but in 2014 the House Ways and Means Committee has considered beginning to enforce the requirement as a way to increase tax revenues.

==== Australia ====
Australia, citing COVID-19 concerns, in 2020 banned outward travel by both Australian citizens and permanent residents, unless they requested and were granted an exemption. In August 2021 this ban was extended to people who are ordinarily resident in countries other than Australia as well. Exceptions apply to business travel and travel for &quot;compelling reasons&quot; for three months or longer, among others.

On 1 November 2021, after 20 months, the exit permit system was scrapped and New South Wales and Victoria officially re-opened their borders in addition to ending quarantine requirements on arrival for fully vaccinated individuals. However, on 27 November 2021, 72-hour quarantine requirements were reinstated over concerns about the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.

=== Visa refusal ===
In general, an applicant may be refused a visa if they do not meet the requirements for admission or entry under that country&#x27;s immigration laws. More specifically, a visa may be denied or refused when the applicant:
* has committed fraud, deception, or misrepresentation in his or her current application as well as in a previous application
* has obtained a criminal record, has been arrested, or has criminal charges pending
* is considered to be a threat to national security
* does not have a good moral character
* has previous visa/immigration violations (even if the violations did not happen in the country the applicant is seeking a visa for)
* had their previous visa application(s) or application for immigration benefits refused and cannot prove that the reasons for the previous refusals no longer exist or are not applicable any more (even if the refusals did not previously happen in the country the applicant is seeking a visa for)
* cannot prove to have strong ties to their current country of nationality or residence (for those who are applying for temporary or non-immigrant visas)
* intends to reside or work permanently in the country she/he will visit if not applying for an immigrant or work visa respectively
* fails to demonstrate intent to return (for non-immigrants)
* fails to provide sufficient evidence/documents to prove eligibility for the visa sought after
* does not have a legitimate reason for the journey
* does not have adequate means of financial support for themselves or family
* does not have adequate medical insurance, especially if engaging in high risk activities (e.g. rock climbing, skiing, etc.)
* does not have travel arrangements (i.e. transport and lodging) in the destination country
* does not have health/travel insurance valid for the destination and the duration of stay
* is a citizen of a country to which the destination country is hostile or at war with
* has previously visited, or intends to visit, a country to which the destination country is hostile
* has a communicable disease, such as tuberculosis or ebola, or a sexually transmitted disease
* has a passport that expires too soon

Even if a traveller does not need a visa, the aforementioned criteria can also be used by border control officials to refuse the traveller&#x27;s entry into the country in question.

== Types ==

Each country typically has a multitude of categories of visas with various names. The most common types and names of visas include:

=== By purpose ===
==== Transit visas ====
For passing through the country of issue to a destination outside that country. Validity of transit visas are usually limited by short terms such as several hours to ten days depending on the size of the country or the circumstances of a particular transit itinerary.
* , required by some countries for passing through their airports even without going through passport control.
* , issued to persons employed or trained on aircraft, vessels, trains, trucks, buses, and any other means of international transportation, or ships fishing in international waters.

==== Short-stay or visitor visas ====
For short visits to the visited country. Many countries differentiate between different reasons for these visits, such as:
* , for private visits by invitation from residents of the visited country.
* , for a limited period of leisure travel, no business activities allowed.
* , for undertaking diagnostics or a course of treatment in the visited country&#x27;s hospitals or other medical facilities.
* , for engaging in commerce in the country. These visas generally preclude permanent employment, for which a work visa would be required.
* Working holiday visa, for individuals travelling between nations offering a working holiday program, allowing young people to undertake temporary work while travelling.
* , issued to athletes and performing artists (and their supporting staff) performing at competitions, concerts, shows, and other events.
** , usually issued to athletes and performing artists participating in a cultural exchange program.
* , issued to persons fleeing the dangers of persecution, a war or a natural disaster.
* : this type of visa is mainly issued to those intending to visit religious destinations and/or to take part in particular religious ceremonies. Such visas can usually be obtained relatively quickly and at a low cost; those using them are usually permitted to travel only as a group, however. The most well-known example is Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Hajj visa.

==== Long-stay visas ====
Visas valid for long term stays of a specific duration include:
* (F-1 in the United States), which allows its holder to study at an institution of higher learning in the issuing country. The F-2 visa allows the student&#x27;s dependents to accompany them in the United States.
** , for students doing fieldwork in the host country.
* , for approved employment in the host country. These are generally more difficult to obtain but valid for longer periods of time than a business visa. Examples of these are the United States&#x27; H-1B and L-1 visas. Depending on a particular country, the status of temporary worker may or may not evolve into the status of permanent resident or to naturalization.
** , which some countries require of people in that occupation when travelling for their respective news organizations. Countries that insist on this include Cuba, China, Iran, Japan, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, the United States (I-visa), and Zimbabwe.
* , granted to people obtaining long-term residence in the host country. In some countries, such as New Zealand, long-term residence is a necessary step to obtain the status of a permanent resident.
* , issued to people who have suffered or reasonably fear persecution in their own country due to their political activities or opinion, or features, or association with a social group; or were exiled from their own country.
* , issued to certain family members of holder of a long-stay visa of certain other types (e.g., to spouse and children of a qualified employee holding a temporary worker visa).
* , for digital nomads who want to temporarily reside in a country while performing remote work. Thailand launched its SMART Visa, targeted at high expertise foreigners and entrepreneurs to stay a longer time in Thailand, with online applications for the visa being planned for late 2018. Estonia has also announced plans for a digital nomad visa, after the launch of its e-Residency program.

==== Immigrant visas ====
Granted for those intending to settle permanently in the issuing country (obtain the status of a permanent resident with a prospect of possible naturalization in the future):
* &#x27; or &#x27;, granted to the spouse, civil partner or de facto partner of a resident or citizen of a given country to enable the couple to settle in that country.
* , for other members of the family of a resident or citizen of a given country. Usually, only the closest ones are covered:
** Parents, often restricted to helpless ones, i.e. those who, due to their elderly age or state of health, need supervision and care;
** Children (including adopted ones), often restricted to those who have not reached the age of maturity or helpless ones;
** Often also extended to grandchildren or grandparents, where their immediate parents or children, respectively, are for whichever reason unable to take care of them;
** Often also extended to helpless siblings.
* , granted for a limited period before intended marriage or conclusion of a civil partnership based on a proven relationship with a citizen of the destination country. For example, a German woman wishing to marry an American man would obtain a Fiancée Visa (also known as a K-1 visa) to allow her to enter the United States. A K1 Fiancée Visa is valid for four months from the date of its approval.
* (also known as retiree visa or retirement visa), issued by a limited number of countries (Australia, Argentina, Thailand, Panama, etc.), to those who can demonstrate a foreign source of income and who do not intend to work in the issuing country. Age limits apply in some cases.

==== Official visas ====
These are granted to officials doing jobs for their governments, or otherwise representing their countries in the host country, such as the personnel of diplomatic missions.
* A in combination with a regular or diplomatic passport.
* A is issued to representatives of foreign governments or international organizations who do not qualify for diplomatic status but do merit expedited, courteous treatment – an example of this is Australia&#x27;s special purpose visa.

<doc id="330266" wikidata="Q312676" url="?curid=330266" title="Auguste de Marmont">
<text>Auguste Frédéric Louis Viesse de Marmont, duc de Raguse (; 20 July 1774 – 22 March 1852) was a French general and nobleman who rose to the rank of Marshal of the Empire and was awarded the title (). In the Peninsular War Marmont succeeded the disgraced André Masséna in the command of the French army in northern Spain, but lost decisively at the Battle of Salamanca as France ultimately lost the war in Spain.

At the close of the War of the Sixth Coalition, Marmont went over to the Restoration and remained loyal to the Bourbons through the Hundred Days. This gave Marmont a reputation as a traitor among the remaining Bonapartists, and in French society more broadly. He led the royalist Paris garrison during the July Revolution in 1830, but his efforts proved incapable of quelling the revolution, leading King Charles X to accuse Marmont of betraying the Bourbons as he had betrayed the Bonapartes.

Marmont departed France with Charles&#x27;s entourage and never returned to France. Spending his exile mostly in Vienna and other lands of the Austrian Empire, he died in Venice in 1852.

==Early life and career==

Marmont was born at Châtillon-sur-Seine, the son of an ex-officer in the army who belonged to the &quot;petite noblesse&quot; and adopted the principles of the Revolution. His love of soldiering soon showed itself, and his father took him to Dijon to learn mathematics before entering the artillery. There, he made the acquaintance of Napoleon Bonaparte, which he renewed after obtaining his commission when he served in Toulon.

The acquaintance ripened into intimacy; Marmont became General Bonaparte&#x27;s &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;, remained with him during his disgrace and accompanied him to Italy and Egypt, winning distinction and promotion to general of brigade. In 1799, he returned to Europe with his chief. He was present at the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of the 18th Brumaire and organized the artillery for the expedition to Italy, which he commanded with great effect at Marengo. For this, he was at once made general of division. In 1801, he became inspector-general of artillery, and in 1804, grand officer of the Legion of Honour. However, he was greatly disappointed at being omitted from the list of officers who were made marshals.

==Napoleonic Wars==
In 1805, he received the command of a corps, with which he did good service at Ulm. He was then directed to take possession of Dalmatia with his army and occupied the Republic of Ragusa. For the next five years, he was military and civil governor of Dalmatia, and traces of his beneficent régime still survive both in great public works and in the memories of the people. In 1808, he was made Duke of Ragusa.

In the War of the Fifth Coalition, he defeated an Austrian holding force in the Dalmatian Campaign of May 1809 and captured the opposing commander. Breaking out of Dalmatia, he reached Ljubljana (Laibach) in early June. After he defeated Ignaz Gyulai&#x27;s corps in the Battle of Graz, Napoleon summoned the XI Corps to Vienna. Marmont arrived in time to fight in the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July. In the subsequent pursuit of Archduke Charles, Marmont&#x27;s corps was in a compromising position and was rescued only by the arrival of Napoleon with heavy reinforcements. Napoleon made him a Marshal of the Empire, though he said, &quot;Between ourselves, you have not done enough to justify entirely my choice.&quot; Of the three marshals created after Wagram, the French soldiers said,

MacDonald is France&#x27;s choice&lt;br&gt;Oudinot is the army&#x27;s choice&lt;br&gt;Marmont is friendship&#x27;s choice.

Marmont was appointed governor-general of all the Illyrian provinces of the empire. This region included the Croatian port city state of Ragusa. In May 1811, Marmont was hastily summoned to succeed Masséna in the command of the French army in northern Spain. Despite the presence of the British army, his relief of Ciudad Rodrigo was a great feat. The manoeuvering which preceded the Battle of Salamanca was not successful, however, as Wellington ordered his cavalry to charge Marmont&#x27;s unsuspecting left flank in the battle and inflicted a great defeat on the French. Marmont and his deputy commander Comte Jean-Pierre François Bonet were both struck by shrapnel very early in the battle. Marmont was gravely wounded in the right arm and side, and command of the battle passed to Bertrand Clauzel. He retired to France to recover.

In April 1813, Napoleon again gave Marmont the command of a corps, which he led at the battles of Lützen, Bautzen and Dresden. He then fought throughout the great defensive campaign of 1814 until the last battle before Paris. Marmont&#x27;s forces fought a fighting retreat back to the commanding position of Essonne, inflicting high casualties on the enemy.

Marmont then took upon himself a political role, seeking to halt what he now saw as a pointless prolonging of a war that France would now assuredly lose. Marmont contacted the Allies and reached a secret agreement with them. As the Allies closed on Montmartre, Marmont—together with marshals Mortier and Moncey—marched to a position where they were quickly surrounded by Allied troops and then surrendered their forces.

==Bourbon service==
Marmont stayed loyal to the restored Bourbon king Louis XVIII during the Hundred Days, and following Waterloo, voted in favour of the execution of Marshal Ney.

He was made a Peer of France and a major-general of the royal guard, and in 1820, a knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit and a grand officer of the Order of Saint Louis. He was the major-general of the guard on duty in July 1830 during the July Revolution and was ordered to put down with a strong hand any opposition to the July Ordinances. Himself opposed to the court policy, he nevertheless tried to do his duty and only gave up the attempt to suppress the revolution when it became clear that his troops were outmatched. This brought more obloquy upon him, and Charles X even ordered him arrested, saying:
Marmont accompanied the king into exile and forfeited his marshalate. His desire to return to France was never gratified and he wandered in central and eastern Europe, settling finally in Vienna, where he was well received by the Austrian government. Strangely, he was made tutor to the Duke of Reichstadt, the young man who had once for a few weeks been styled Napoleon II. Despite his long friendship with Napoleon, by this time the verb &quot;raguser&quot;—derived from his title, the Duke of Ragusa—was a household word in France that meant &quot;to betray&quot;. Thirty years later, as an old man living in Venice, little children in the street would point and say, &quot;There goes the man who betrayed Napoleon.&quot; He died in Venice in March 1852, the last living Napoleonic marshal.

==Works==
In his last years, Marmont spent much of his time working on his &quot;Mémoires&quot;, which are of great value to the military history of the time.

His works are:
*&quot;Voyage en Hongrie&quot;, etc. (4 vols., 1837)
*&quot;Voyage en Sicile&quot; (1838); trans. it., Milan, 1840
*&quot;Esprit des institutions militaires&quot; (1845)
*&quot;Cesar&quot;; &quot;Xenophon&quot;; and &quot;Mémoires&quot; (8 vols., published after his death in 1856)

==Family==

In 1798, Marmont married Anne-Marie-Hortense Perregaux, the daughter of Jean-Frédéric Perregaux, a Swiss (and Protestant) banker, later a founder and regent of the Banque de France, and Adélaïde de Praël de Surville, herself the natural daughter of the banker to the court of Louis XV, Nicolas Beaujon. They had no children and were divorced in 1817. She outlived him by five years, dying in Paris in 1857.

==Evaluation==
Marmont is perhaps one of the most controversial marshals created under the Empire. His reputation, like many French generals in Spain, was tarnished by his defeats in the Peninsular War. However, on the whole, Marmont&#x27;s military career was quite impressive. He was perhaps the most educated of the marshals and one of the few to write a thesis on the art of war. He was a talented strategist, understanding the art of command and the movement of troops. He performed wonderfully in Dalmatia making what John Elting calls &quot;a remarkable 300-mile march through frequently roadless country, scattering two Austrian forces, but clinging to his independent status...&quot; Perhaps even more impressive is his study and evaluation of the Spanish theater of the war. He studied Wellington&#x27;s nature of war, refusing to give battle against the British unless the ground was of Marmont&#x27;s choosing. This led to a series of manoeuvres where Marmont frequently had the upper hand. Marmont understood the importance of cooperation in the Peninsula by supporting his fellow marshals. Tactically Marmont was deadly and quick to strike, but prone to sloppiness which caused him his two defeats.

<doc id="330269" wikidata="Q48184" url="?curid=330269" title="György Kurtág">
<text>György Kurtág (; born 19 February 1926) is a Hungarian composer of contemporary classical music and pianist. According to &quot;Grove Music Online&quot;, with a style that draws on &quot;Bartók, Webern and, to a lesser extent, Stravinsky, his work is characterized by compression in scale and forces, and by a particular immediacy of expression&quot;. In 2023 he was described as &quot;one of the last living links to the defining postwar composers of the European avant-garde&quot;.

He was an academic teacher of piano at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music from 1967, later also of chamber music, and taught until 1993.

==Life and career==
György Kurtág was born on 19 February 1926 in Lugoj, Romania, to Jewish Hungarian parents. From the age of 14, he took piano lessons from Magda Kardos and studied composition with Max Eisikovits in Timișoara. He moved to Budapest in 1946 and became a Hungarian citizen in 1948. There, he began his studies at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, where he met his wife, Márta Kinsker, as well as composer György Ligeti, who became a close friend. His piano teacher at the academy was Pál Kadosa. He studied composition with Sándor Veress and Ferenc Farkas, chamber music with Leó Weiner, and theory with Lajos Bárdos, and graduated in piano and chamber music in 1951 before receiving his degree in composition in 1955. He married Márta in 1947 and their son György was born in 1954.

Following the Hungarian uprising in 1956, Kurtág&#x27;s time in Paris between 1957 and 1958 was of critical importance for him. There, he studied with Max Deutsch, Olivier Messiaen, and Darius Milhaud. During this time, however, Kurtág was suffering from severe depression. He has said, &quot;I realized to the point of despair that nothing I had believed to constitute the world was true.&quot; Kurtág received therapy from art psychologist Marianne Stein, who encouraged him to work from the simplest musical elements, an encounter that revivified him and strongly stimulated his artistic development. During this time, he also discovered the works of Anton Webern and the plays of Samuel Beckett. The string quartet he composed in 1959 after his return to Budapest marks this crucial turning point; he refers to this piece as his Opus 1. He dedicated it to Stein.

Kurtág worked as a répétiteur at the Bartók Music School (1958–63) and at the National Philharmonia in Budapest (1960–68). In 1967, he was appointed professor of piano and later also of chamber music at the Franz Liszt Academy, where he taught until 1993. During this time his students included Zoltán Kocsis and András Schiff.

Kurtág&#x27;s first international opportunity came in 1968 when his largest work to date, &quot;The Sayings of Peter Bornemisza&quot;, was performed by Erika Sziklay and Lóránt Szűcs at the Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music. The critical response was not positive, and his international recognition began to grow only later with &quot;Messages of the Late Miss R.V. Troussova&quot; for soprano and chamber ensemble, which had its premiere in Paris in 1981.

Since the early 1990s, he has worked abroad with increasing frequency: he was composer in residence at the Berlin Philharmonic (1993–95) and the Vienna Konzerthaus Society (1995). He then lived in the Netherlands (1996–98), again in Berlin (1998–99) and upon invitation by Ensemble InterContemporain, Cité de la Musique, and Festival d&#x27;Automne, in Paris (1999–2001). Kurtág and his wife lived near Bordeaux from 2002 to 2015, when they moved back to Budapest. The couple remained married until Márta&#x27;s death in October 2019.

==Music==

According to scholar Rachel Beckles Willson, &quot;Kurtág composes painstakingly and haltingly: in 1985, when he was 59, his output had reached only Op. 23, and several works remained unfinished or had been withdrawn for revision.&quot;

Kurtág&#x27;s compositions are often made up of many very brief movements. &quot;Kafka Fragments&quot;, for instance, is an approximately 55-minute song cycle for soprano and solo violin made up of 40 short movements, setting extracts from Franz Kafka&#x27;s writings, diaries, and letters. Music journalist Tom Service wrote that Kurtág&#x27;s music &quot;involved reducing music to the level of the fragment, the moment, with individual pieces or movements lasting mere seconds, or a minute, perhaps two.&quot; Most extreme of all, his piano piece &quot;Flowers We Are, Mere Flowers&quot;, from the eighth volume of &quot;Játékok&quot; (&quot;Games&quot;), consists of just seven notes. Because of this interest in miniatures, Kurtág&#x27;s music is often compared to Webern&#x27;s.

Prior to &quot;Stele&quot;, Op. 33 (written for the Berlin Philharmonic and Claudio Abbado), Kurtág&#x27;s compositions were mainly vocal solo and choral music and instrumental music ranging from solo pieces to works for chamber ensembles of increasing size. Since &quot;Stele&quot;, a number of large-scale compositions have been premiered, such as &quot;Messages&quot; Op. 34 and &quot;New Messages&quot; Op. 34a for orchestra and the double concerto &quot;…concertante…&quot; Op. 42. Kurtág&#x27;s only opera, &quot;Fin de partie&quot;, based on Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Endgame&quot;, was premiered at La Scala on 15 November 2018, eight years after the original commission.

Beginning in the late 1980s, Kurtág wrote several works in which the spatial distribution of instruments plays an important role. His composition, &quot;… quasi una fantasia…&quot; for piano and ensemble, premiered in 1988, is the first piece in which he explores the idea of music that spatially embraces the audience.

Kurtág often held master classes in chamber music, and appeared in concerts together with his wife. The couple played an always-renewing selection of pieces for two- and four-hand piano from Kurtág&#x27;s ten-volume collection &quot;Játékok&quot; as well as transcriptions.

Most of Kurtág&#x27;s music is published by Editio Musica Budapest, some by Universal Edition, Vienna, and some by Boosey &amp; Hawkes, London.

==Recognition==

Kurtág has received numerous awards, including Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1985, the Kossuth Award of the Hungarian government for his life achievement in 1973, the Austrian &quot;Ehrenzeichen&quot; in 1996, and the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 1998. He is also a member of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, and of the Akademie der Künste, Berlin (both since 1987), and was named an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2001. In 2006, he received the Grawemeyer Award for his composition &quot;…concertante…&quot; Op. 42, for violin, viola and orchestra. 

In 2024 Kurtág received the Wolf Prize, an international award granted in Israel, &quot;for his contribution to the world&#x27;s cultural heritage, which is fundamentally inspirational and human&quot;.

Kurtág received the 2014 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the category of Contemporary Music for, in the view of the jury, its &quot;rare expressive intensity&quot;. &quot;The novel dimension of his music&quot;, the citation continues, &quot;lies not in the material he uses but in its spirit, the authenticity of its language, and the way it crosses borders between spontaneity and reflection, between formalism and expression.&quot;

Invited by Walter Fink, Kurtág was the 14th composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2004. The Ensemble Modern and soloists performed his works Opp. 19, 31b and 17. On the occasion of his 80th birthday in February 2006, the Budapest Music Centre honoured him with a festival in his hometown. The same year&#x27;s editions of Musikfest Berlin, Vienna modern, Holland Festival and Festival d&#x27;Automne in Paris dedicated special programmes to Kurtág.

<doc id="330270" wikidata="Q5214238" url="?curid=330270" title="Dan Quisenberry">
<text>Daniel Raymond Quisenberry (; February 7, 1953 – September 30, 1998), nicknamed &quot;Quiz&quot;, was an American right-handed relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who played primarily for the Kansas City Royals. Notable for his submarine-style pitching delivery and his humorous quotes, he led the American League in saves a record five times (1980, 1982–85). Quisenberry retired in 1990 with 244 saves, then the fifth-highest total in major league history.

==Early life==
Quisenberry was born in Santa Monica, California. His name is the English mutation of the German surname Questenberg, a village in Saxony-Anhalt. His parents divorced when he was 7 years old, and his mother remarried Art Meola, a Rockwell International engineer who encouraged him and his older brother to play baseball. Quisenberry played baseball at Costa Mesa High School/Middle School. In 1973, while attending Orange Coast College, he was named team MVP. He was then recruited by the University of La Verne, a Church of the Brethren college, where he met his future wife, Janie Howard, while attending a class in square dancing.

==Career==

=== Kansas City Royals ===
Quisenberry signed with the Royals as an amateur free agent in 1975 for a Class A team in Waterloo, Iowa, and pitched a complete game in his first start. At the end of the season, he was promoted to the Double-A team in Jacksonville, Florida. At the time, he worked for a sporting goods store during the day and a mortuary at night. In the winter of 1978, he attended Fresno Pacific University, affiliated with the Mennonite Brethren Church, to get a teaching degree in case his baseball career was not successful.

On July 8, 1979, at the age of 26, he made his major league debut with the Kansas City Royals against the Chicago White Sox, pitching scoreless innings, and surrendering just two hits and no walks. Quisenberry appeared in 32 games and posted a record with a 3.15 earned run average and five saves.

During spring training in 1980, manager Jim Frey suggested that Quisenberry learn the submarine-style delivery from Pittsburgh Pirates reliever Kent Tekulve to confuse hitters, because he could not overpower them with a fastball. From 1980 to 1985, Quisenberry was the American League&#x27;s dominant closer leading the American League in saves every season except the strike-shortened 1981 season. During that time, he posted an ERA of 2.45 and won the Rolaids Relief Man Award each season. He also finished in the top five in voting for the Cy Young Award during this span. He won the Sporting News Reliever of the Year Award every year from 1982 to 1985.
Unlike many closers, Quisenberry did not possess a hard fastball, and thus had to rely on pinpoint control, guile, and deception, which was augmented by the submarine delivery he first used in 1980. His primary pitch was a sinking fastball, which causes hitters to hit the ball on the ground rather than in the air. He also threw a curveball, a changeup he developed in 1984, and an occasional knuckleball. Although Quisenberry was not a strikeout pitcher (averaging only 3.3 strikeouts per nine innings during his career), he offset this deficiency by seldom walking batters or throwing wild pitches. His 45 saves in 1983 set a single-season MLB record, later tied in 1984 by Bruce Sutter and broken in 1986 by Dave Righetti, and set a team record that was tied in 1993 by Jeff Montgomery and surpassed in 2013 by Greg Holland. Quisenberry was the first pitcher in major league history to save more than 40 games in a season twice in his career. He won a World Series with the Royals in 1985 and was the winning pitcher of Game 6, notorious for Don Denkinger&#x27;s blown call at first base.

In 1983, the Royals signed Quisenberry to a lifetime contract, similar to the contract of teammate George Brett. However, a rocky start in 1988 led to Quisenberry&#x27;s relegation to middle relief and mop-up duty. Shortly before the All-Star break, he was released by the Royals.

=== St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants ===
Ten days later, the St. Louis Cardinals, managed by ex-Royals manager Whitey Herzog, signed Quisenberry as a free agent. After pitching for a year and a half in St. Louis, Quisenberry signed to play with the San Francisco Giants in 1990. He tore his rotator cuff just five appearances into the 1990 season; this was the first serious injury of his career. Quisenberry retired from baseball in 1990 with 244 saves, then the fifth-highest total in major league history.

=== Career legacy ===
In the 1996 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America, Quisenberry received 18 votes, just under the 24 vote (5%) cut-off to remain on the ballot. In the same election, Bruce Sutter, a pitcher with remarkably similar overall statistics, received 137 votes; Sutter went on to be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 2006. In 2013, Quisenberry&#x27;s Hall of Fame candidacy was given a second look by the Expansion Era Committee, which re-examines the credentials of overlooked players from 1973–present, but he fell short of the 12 votes needed from the 16-member panel.

Along with Sutter and Rich Gossage, Quisenberry was part of the transition from &quot;fire men&quot; to the ninth inning closer popularized by manager Tony La Russa.

==Personal life==
Quisenberry and his wife lived in Kansas City. They had two children, Alysia and David. The family supported the Harvesters Food Bank.

Quisenberry was religious. Originally considered a hothead, Quisenberry credited his wife as well as Christianity for calming him.

After his baseball career ended, Quisenberry published book of poetry, &quot;On Days Like This,&quot; in 1998. He was also one of baseball&#x27;s most quotable characters, with &quot;bon mots&quot; like &quot;I found a delivery in my flaw&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve seen the future and it&#x27;s much like the present, only longer.&quot; The latter quote, however, had been published verbatim nearly two decades prior.

===Death===
In January 1998, Quisenberry cut short a snowboarding vacation in Colorado because of headaches, dizzy spells, and blurred vision. Quisenberry was diagnosed with grade IV astrocytoma, a highly malignant form of brain cancer. He died at age 45 on September 30, 1998, in Leawood, Kansas.

<text>The World Fantasy Awards are a set of awards given each year for the best fantasy fiction published during the previous calendar year. Organized and overseen by the World Fantasy Convention, the awards are given each year at the eponymous annual convention as the central focus of the event. They were first given in 1975, at the first World Fantasy Convention, and have been awarded annually since. Over the years that the award has been given, the categories presented have changed; currently World Fantasy Awards are given in five written categories, one category for artists, and four special categories for individuals to honor their general work in the field of fantasy.

The awards have been described by book critics such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;prestigious fantasy prize&quot;, and one of the three most prestigious speculative fiction awards, along with the Hugo and Nebula Awards (which cover both fantasy and science fiction). World Fantasy Award nominees and winners are decided by attendees of the convention and a panel of judges, typically made up of fantasy authors. Winners receive a small trophy; through the 2015 awards it was a bust of H. P. Lovecraft designed by cartoonist Gahan Wilson. The bust was retired following that year amid complaints about Lovecraft&#x27;s history of racism; a new statuette designed by Vincent Villafranca depicting a tree in front of a full moon was released in 2017. The 2024 awards were presented at the 50th convention in Niagara Falls, New York on October 20, 2024, and the 2025 awards will be presented at the 51st convention in Brighton, United Kingdom on November 2, 2025.

==History==

The World Fantasy Awards were established at the first World Fantasy Convention, an annual convention of professionals, collectors, and others interested in the field of fantasy, held that first year in horror writer H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s home city of Providence, Rhode Island in 1975. Winners were presented with a trophy in the form of a bust of an elongated caricature of Lovecraft designed by cartoonist Gahan Wilson, nicknamed the &quot;Howard&quot;, which matched the theme of the first convention, &quot;The Lovecraft Circle&quot;. As stated by Wilson in &quot;First World Fantasy Awards: An Anthology of the Fantastic&quot;, &quot;The point of the awards was, is, and hopefully shall be to give a visible, potentially usable, sign of appreciation to writers working in the area of fantastic literature, an area too often distinguished by low financial remuneration and indifference&quot;.

At the start of the awards in 1975, seven categories were presented: Best Novel, Best Short Fiction, Best Collection, Best Artist, Special Award—Professional, Special Award—Non-professional, and Life Achievement. Only a few categories have changed since then, and no changes have been made to the rules. 1978 saw the addition of the Convention Award, a special award given for general contributions to the genre, and the only award not given every year since the beginning. The Short Fiction award was split into Short Story and Novella awards in 1982, and in 1988 the multi-author anthologies, previously eligible for the Collection award, were split into their own Best Anthology category. No changes have been made since.

Winners were presented with the H. P. Lovecraft bust through the 2015 awards; at that ceremony the presenters announced that future ceremonies will no longer use the trophy. Although controversy had arisen in recent years over Lovecraft&#x27;s history of racism, no explicit reason was given for the change. A new statuette, designed by Vincent Villafranca, was announced in April 2017 to be used for the 2016 awards on. The new award, which depicts a tree in front of a full moon, was intended to evoke the use of trees and night imagery in mythology, fantasy, and horror works.

==Administration==
World Fantasy Award nominees and winners are decided by judges and attendees of the World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, with the two most-nominated selected, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors, as well as other fantasy professionals and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which has the power to break ties if the judges are deadlocked. The awards administration is a subgroup of the World Fantasy Convention Board, which selects sites for upcoming World Fantasy Conventions. Both the board and the judges panel are largely made up of professionals in the field of fantasy. The judges for the 2014 awards, for example, were authors Andy Duncan, Kij Johnson, Oliver Johnson, and Liz Williams, and editor John Klima.

The nominees are announced in July, and final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention around the end of October. The Life Achievement and Convention Awards do not list nominees, and instead have the winner announced along with the other categories&#x27; nominees. The Life Achievement winner is decided by the judges panel, while the Convention award winner, not given every year, is selected by the convention organizers. The World Fantasy Convention itself is a multi-day event with several hundred attendees taking place in a different city each year, usually in the United States but sometimes in Canada or the United Kingdom. In addition to the awards ceremony, the conventions include an art show, a dealer&#x27;s room, autograph receptions, and numerous panels and discussions.

==Categories==
The World Fantasy Awards are split into ten categories, including both awards for written works and for professionals in the field. Eligibility requirements are loosely defined: works must have been published in the prior calendar year, and professionals must still be living. All types of fantasy works are accepted, regardless of subgenre or style, though whether a given work is considered to be fantasy is left up to the discretion of the nominators and judges.

Across all categories, Ellen Datlow has both the most nominations and most wins of any nominee, with 10 wins out of 42 nominations, primarily for her anthologies. She is followed by Terri Windling with 9 out of 30 and Stephen Jones with 3 out of 28, both also mainly for editing anthologies. Jeffrey Ford has the highest number of wins after Datlow and Windling with 6 out of 14 nominations, and is tied for the highest number of fiction awards with Stephen King at four.

==Recognition==
The awards have been described by book critics such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;prestigious fantasy prize&quot;, and one of the three most prestigious speculative fiction awards, along with the Hugo and Nebula Awards (which cover both fantasy and science fiction). In 2010 multiple winner George R. R. Martin described winning the Hugo, Nebula, and &quot;the prestigious World Fantasy Award&quot; as the &quot;triple crown&quot;. Others have also noted the award&#x27;s prestige in the field, such as Tachyon Publications and 2014 Best Anthology winner Gardner Dozois. Stephen Jones of the &quot;Best New Horror&quot; series has said that winning the anthology award for their first volume in 1991 helped &quot;establish the series among readers and some publishers&quot; in multiple countries. Winners such as Nnedi Okorafor—Best Novel in 2011—have described the award as &quot;one of my greatest honors as a writer&quot;. Editor and bookseller Rick Klaw in 2007, however, noted that the consensus at the time &quot;in the bookselling community&quot; was that winning the novel category did not have any effect on sales and did not help keep the book in print, with 57 percent of prior winners out of print, compared to 23 percent of Hugo Award winners from the same time period.

Two anthologies have been drawn from the World Fantasy Award winners: &quot;First World Fantasy Awards: An Anthology of the Fantastic&quot; in 1977, edited by Gahan Wilson and covering stories from the initial award year, and &quot;The World Fantasy Awards: Volume Two&quot; in 1980, edited by Stuart David Schiff and Fritz Leiber.

==Controversies==

===Graphic novels===
At the 1991 awards, graphic novel &quot;The Sandman&quot; issue #19 &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, scripted by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Charles Vess, won the award for Best Short Story. It was reported that the rules were subsequently changed to prevent another graphic novel from winning, though the awards administration stated that comics and graphic novels were not intended to be eligible for that category, and said that &quot;Comics are eligible in the Special Award Professional category. We never made a change in the rules.&quot;

===H. P. Lovecraft bust===
A minor controversy about the trophy occurred in 1984, when Donald Wandrei refused his Life Achievement award as he felt the award bust was a demeaning caricature of Lovecraft, whom he had known personally. Wandrei&#x27;s rejected trophy was later recycled and given to another award winner.

A larger controversy surrounding the bust began in the 2010s, when several authors began to object to using the author H. P. Lovecraft as the symbol of the awards, given his outspoken racism, though others, such as Indian-American Lovecraft scholar and World Fantasy Award winner S. T. Joshi, claimed that Lovecraft&#x27;s attitudes were not considered extreme at the time. Winners Nnedi Okorafor and China Miéville noted in 2011 that they felt conflicted about being honored by a bust of a man who hated people of color. Several authors and editors argued for the trophy to be changed, including a petition by author Daniel José Older in 2014, an editorial by &quot;The New York Review of Science Fiction&quot; editor Kevin J. Maroney arguing that it should be changed &quot;as a courtesy to generations of writers whom the WFA hopes to honor&quot;, and 2014 Best Novel winner Sofia Samatar&#x27;s acceptance speech.

In September 2014, the administrators of the World Fantasy Award announced they were &quot;in discussion&quot; about the future of the award trophy. In November 2015, at the 2015 awards, they announced that the Lovecraft bust would no longer be used beginning the following year. Lenika Cruz, associate editor of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, defended the decision, stating that &quot;Lovecraft&#x27;s removal is about more than just the writer himself; it&#x27;s not an indictment of his entire oeuvre&quot;. S. T. Joshi, however, expressed anger at the decision, and returned his two World Fantasy Awards and urged a boycott of the convention.

<text>Louis-Alexandre Berthier, prince de Neuchâtel et Valangin, prince de Wagram (; 20 November 1753 – 1 June 1815) was a French military commander who served during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. He was twice Minister of War of France and was made a Marshal of the Empire in 1804. Berthier served as chief of staff to Napoleon Bonaparte from his first Italian campaign in 1796 until his first abdication in 1814. The operational efficiency of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; owed much to his considerable administrative and organizational skills.

Born into a military family, Berthier served in the American Revolutionary War and survived suspicion of monarchism during the Reign of Terror before a rapid rise in the ranks of the French Revolutionary Army. Although a key supporter of the coup against the Directory that gave Napoleon supreme power, and present for his greatest victories, Berthier strongly opposed the progressive stretching of lines of communication during the Russian campaign. Allowed to retire by the restored Bourbon regime, he died by either suicide or murder shortly before the Battle of Waterloo. Berthier&#x27;s reputation as a superb operational organiser remains strong among current historians.

==Early life==
Berthier was born in Versailles on 20 November 1753. He was the eldest of five surviving children of Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Baptiste Berthier (1721–1804), an officer in the Corps of Topographical Engineers, and his first wife (married in 1746) Marie Françoise L&#x27;Huillier de La Serre. Three of his brothers also served in the French Army, with two, César (1765–1819) and Victor-Léopold (1770–1807), becoming generals during the Napoleonic Wars.

==Early career==

As a boy, Berthier was instructed in the military art by his father, an officer of the &quot;Corps de genie&quot; (Engineer Corps). In 1764 he was admitted to the Royal Engineering School of Mézières, as a second lieutenant, graduating as a topographical engineer two years later, at the age of 12. In March 1772, Berthier entered the army as a lieutenant in the Flanders Legion. He then joined the Prince of Lambesc&#x27;s Lorraine Dragoon Regiment in August 1776, and was promoted to captain in June 1777.

Berthier first saw action during the American Revolutionary War, in which he served from 1780 to 1783 as a staff officer under Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, Count of Rochambeau. On his return, having attained the rank of colonel, he was employed in various staff posts and was made a Knight of Saint Louis in 1788. In July 1789, at the start of the French Revolution, Berthier was made a lieutenant-colonel as well as chief of staff of the Versailles National Guard, and in this role protected King Louis XVI&#x27;s family from popular violence. In 1791, he aided in the emigration of the king&#x27;s aunts Victoire and Adélaïde.

==French Revolutionary Wars==

In 1792, Berthier was promoted to maréchal de camp and posted to the Army of the North. He was appointed chief of staff to Marshal Nicolas Luckner, and bore a distinguished part in the Argonne campaign of Generals Dumouriez and Kellermann. He served with great credit in the War in the Vendée of 1793–1795. Berthier was made a brigade general in March 1795 and a general of division three months later.

Berthier first met Napoleon Bonaparte in March 1796, and was at once made chief of staff to the Army of Italy, which Bonaparte had recently been appointed to command. He served in the Italian campaign of 1796, distinguishing himself at the Battle of Lodi. In January 1797 he played an important role in the Battle of Rivoli, relieving General Joubert when the latter was attacked by the Austrian general Jozsef Alvinczi. His power of work, accuracy and quick comprehension, combined with his long and varied experience and his complete mastery of detail, made Berthier the ideal chief of staff. In this capacity, Berthier was Napoleon&#x27;s most valued assistant for the rest of his career.

Berthier accompanied Napoleon throughout the campaign of 1797, and was left in charge of the army after the Treaty of Campo Formio. He was in this post in 1798 when he entered Italy, invaded the Vatican, organized the Roman Republic, and took Pope Pius VI prisoner. Berthier supervised the Pope’s relocation to Valence, where, after a tortuous journey, Pius died. The death of the Pope dealt a major blow to the Vatican&#x27;s political power.
After this, Berthier joined his chief in Egypt, serving there until Napoleon&#x27;s return. He assisted in the Coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799), afterwards becoming Minister of War for a time. During the Battle of Marengo, Berthier was the nominal head of the Army of Reserve, but the first consul accompanied the army and he acted in reality, as always, as chief of staff to Napoleon.

Despite serving as a staff officer, Berthier had at one point received a battlefield injury. A contemporary subordinate staff officer, Brossier, reports that at the Battle of Marengo:
At the close of the campaign, he was employed in civil and diplomatic business. This included a mission to Spain in August 1800, which resulted in the retrocession of Louisiana to France by the Treaty of San Ildefonso on 1 October 1800, and led to the Louisiana Purchase.

==Napoleonic Wars==
In May 1804, Napoleon became emperor and at once made Berthier a Marshal of the Empire. He took part in the campaigns of Austerlitz, Jena, and Friedland. Berthier was made Grand Huntsman in 1804 and Vice-Constable of the Empire in 1807. In 1806, when Napoleon deposed King Frederick William III of Prussia from the Principality of Neuchâtel (now the Swiss canton of Neuchâtel), Berthier was appointed its ruler, with the title of Prince of Neuchâtel and Duke of Valangin. This lasted until his abdication on 3 June 1814. Berthier never visited Neuchâtel, where he was represented by a governor, although he was well acquainted with its affairs.

In 1808, Berthier served in the Peninsular War, and in 1809, served in the Austrian theatre during the War of the Fifth Coalition, after which he was given the title of Prince of Wagram. He was with Napoleon in Russia in 1812, and took part in the extremely unusual council of war on whether to proceed, being one of several who advised against an advance on Moscow which Napoleon had decided on, encouraged by Joachim Murat who was blamed by many for the horse-killing pace of the march into Russia. Berthier is said to have burst into tears at the decision. He served in Germany in 1813, and France in 1814, fulfilling, until the fall of the French Empire, the functions of chief of staff of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;.

==Later life==

Following Napoleon&#x27;s first abdication, Berthier retired to Château de Grosbois, his 600-acre (2.4 km2) estate at Boissy-Saint-Léger, Val-de-Marne. He made peace with Louis XVIII in 1814 and accompanied the king on his solemn entry into Paris. During Napoleon&#x27;s short exile on Elba, he informed Berthier of his projects. Berthier was much perplexed as to his future course and, being unwilling to commit to Napoleon, fell under the suspicion both of his old leader and of Louis XVIII.

==Death==

On Napoleon&#x27;s return to France in March 1815, Berthier withdrew to the Bavarian city of Bamberg. On 1 June 1815 he died from a fall from an upstairs window at the &quot;Neue Residenz&quot;, a 17th-century Bishop&#x27;s residence. The manner of his death remains uncertain because he fell from a casement window with a sill from the floor, making an accident seem unlikely. According to some accounts, he was assassinated by members of a secret society, while others say he threw himself from the window, maddened at the sight of Russian troops marching to invade France. It remains unclear whether his defenestration was suicide or murder.

His loss was keenly felt by Napoleon, who wished he had his former Chief of Staff at Waterloo:
==Character assessment==
Berthier was an immensely skilled chief of staff, but he was not a great field commander. When he was in temporary command in 1809, the French army in Bavaria underwent a series of reverses. Despite the fact that his merit as a general was completely overshadowed by the genius of Napoleon, Berthier was nevertheless renowned for his excellent organising skills and being able to understand and carry out the emperor&#x27;s directions to the minutest detail. General Paul Thiébault wrote of him:

No one could have better suited General Bonaparte, who wanted a man capable of relieving him of all detailed work, to understand him instantly and to foresee what he would need.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1796, Berthier fell in love with Giuseppa Carcano, marquise Visconti di Borgorato, who was to be his mistress for the duration of the First French Empire, despite the emperor&#x27;s disapproval. Even when Napoleon forced him to marry a Bavarian princess, the Duchess Maria Elisabeth, in 1808, Berthier managed to keep his mistress and his wife together under the same roof, a state of affairs which infuriated the emperor.

On 9 March 1808, Berthier married Elisabeth who was the only daughter of Duke Wilhelm in Bavaria and Countess Palatine Maria Anna of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld-Rappoltstein, the sister of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, and a relative of the Russian emperor through the Wittelsbach line on the Bavarian side and Prussian (Mecklenburg) side of her lineage.

They had one son and two daughters :
* Napoléon-Alexandre, 2nd Duke and 2nd Prince of Wagram (11 September 1810 – 10 February 1887), married on 29 June 1831 to Zénaïde Françoise Clary (25 November 1812 – 27 April 1884). They had two daughters, Malcy Louise Caroline Frédérique Berthier Princess of Walgram (1832-1884), Elisabeth Alexandrine Maria Berthier Princess of Wagram (1849–1932) and a son, Louis Philippe Marie Alexandre Berthier, 3rd Prince of Wagram (1836–1911)
* Caroline-Joséphine, Princess of Wagram (22 August 1812 – 1905), married on 9 October 1832 to Alphonse Napoléon, Baron d&#x27;Hautpoul (29 May 1806 – 25 April 1889)
* Marie Anne Wilhelmine Alexandrine Elisabeth, Princess of Wagram (19 February 1816 – 23 July 1878). Born shortly after her father&#x27;s death. Married on 24 June 1834 to Jules Lebrun, 3rd Duke of Plaisance (19 April 1811 – 15 January 1872)

==In literature==
Berthier is mentioned and/or appears in several of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Brigadier Gerard stories, including &quot;How the Brigadier Was Tempted by the Devil&quot; (1895), and in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;.

==In video games==
Berthier is prominently featured in the 2010 video game &quot;&quot;, where he serves as the narrator of the campaign/story mode, and the battle advisor to the French faction during battles. He is also featured prominently in the three tutorial missions in the game, and also appears in two of the game&#x27;s historical battles. The game is slightly inaccurate in Berthier&#x27;s life, in that Berthier gives the narration about the Battle of Waterloo, regardless of a win or a loss, while in real life, Berthier died shortly before the battle from a fall in his home.

This particularly relates to other Serbo-Croatian standards of Bosnian, Montenegrin and Serbian which liberally draw on Turkish, Latin, Greek, Russian and English loanwords.

==Description==
Croatian literature across the centuries is argued to demonstrate a tendency to cherish Slavic words and word coinage, and to expel &quot;foreign&quot; borrowings. Croatian philologist Zlatko Vince articulates this tendency as follows:
Croatian literature even in the old ages tends to stay away from barbarisms and foreign words, a certain conscious care in the works of literature is felt when it comes to language selection. In the course of centuries hence the tendency is formed for standard language to be as much as pure and selective as possible. One thing is the colloquial language, often ridden with foreign words, and entirely different thing is the language of literary works in which tendency for language purity arises. The way and the extent to which that need could be satisfied is different in various periods, but the tendency for as pure and selective language can be noted even in Old Dubrovnik writers, and in Vitezović. All the way to pre-Illyrian and Illyrian efforts and by the end of the 19th century, when the osmotic influence of traditional Croatian literary heritage does not cease to stop...That care of language purity which characterizes Croatian literary expression even in the 19th century, remains immanent in later periods...Standard language of the Croats is in fact organic continuation of older state of affairs in Croatian literature.
In a session regarding the issue of the usage for foreign words in Croatian, as well on the problems of ongoing projects of coining Slavic replacements for established technical terms by combined efforts of linguists and specialists, the now defunct institution for the standardization of Croatian—the Council for Standard Croatian Language Norm—has presented the historical overview of the issue as follows:
The attitude towards foreign words in standard Croatian is multi-dimensional in many respects. The origin of Croatian linguistic culture, when writing in Slavic, is determined by the tradition of Church Slavonic literature. Originating from copies of Ancient Greek liturgical texts, it places a distinct emphasis to Slavic expressive devices, and only exceptionally non-Slavic words are being borrowed. That tendency has been continued in Croatian linguistic culture to this day. The usage of Croatian words, if necessary even in a modified meaning, or Croatian coinages, if they&#x27;re considered to be successful, represents higher merit then mere mechanical borrowing of foreign expressive devices. That way the Croatian word is more solemn and formal (&quot;glazba&quot;, &quot;mirovina&quot;, &quot;redarstvenik&quot;), and the loanword is more relaxing and less demanding (&quot;muzika&quot;, &quot;penzija&quot;, &quot;policajac&quot;). This dimension of purism is incorporated into the very foundations of Croatian linguistic sensitivity.
==History==
===Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary===
The Illyrian movement and its successor, the Zagreb Philological School, have been particularly successful in creating the corpus of Croatian terminology that covered virtually all areas of modern civilization. This was especially visible in two fundamental works: Ivan Mažuranić&#x27;s and Josip Užarević&#x27;s &quot;German-Croatian dictionary&quot; (1842), and Bogoslav Šulek&#x27;s &quot;German-Croatian-Italian dictionary of scientific terminology&quot; (1875). These works and especially Šulek&#x27;s, systematized (i.e. collected from older dictionaries), invented and coined Croatian terminology for the 19th century jurisprudence, military schools, exact and social sciences, as well as numerous other fields (technology and commodities of urban civilization).

During this period, purist attitudes towards loanwords were not identical between the two variants of Serbo-Croatian. In Croatia, particularly during Croatian national revival, it was considered that purism &quot;...is a stronger assertion of identity than the mere wholesale adaptation of foreign terms&quot; in opposition of neighbouring languages, German, Italian and Hungarian which &quot;objectively dominated&quot; a language that was, according to contemporary references, felt &quot;subjectively inferior&quot;. Purist tendencies were accompanied with struggles for the use of Croatian in public domains, and especially targeted against the German influence. A smaller part of German loanwords became part of the Croatian standard language, while a greater number of German loanwords remained in spoken dialects.

The very lively purist activity in Croatia was not met with approval among Serbian philologists. Although the latter called for attention to the purity of the language in schools and scientific usage, they also warned about taking this policy too far. Linguistic objections against neologisms and calques &quot;forged in Zagreb&quot; were that they did not follow the rules of Shtokavian word formation but were modeled mainly on German compounds (&quot;veleposjednik, veleizdaja&quot;) or that some of the adopted Slavonic words (&quot;nužda, uštrb&quot;) or &#x27;unnecessary Russianisms&#x27; do not conform to the Shtokavian phonological rules. Small number of neologisms have been accepted in Serbia, despite a persistent line of public support for substitution of loanwords with native words. In support of replacing loanwords were Jovan Bošković in his book &quot;O srpskom jeziku&quot; (1887), Jovan Živanović under the same title (1888), various articles and periodicals, and a leading Serbian linguist Aleksandar Belić, who thought that loanwords should only be used in exceptional cases. &#x27;Antipurist campaigns&#x27; were, however, led by language advice columns in an influential Belgrade daily newspaper &quot;Politika&quot;, arguing that &quot;loanwords are almost never either synonymous or equally applicable as the suggested native replacements.&quot;

===First Yugoslavia===
During the Yugoslav period, from 1918 to 1990, Croatian and Serbian were treated as Western and Eastern variants of Serbo-Croatian. Parts of this policy were systematic attempts to eliminate traits of standard Croatian by which it distinguished itself from standard Serbian, and vice-versa.

===World War II===
In the Independent State of Croatia, a World War II state that existed between 1941 and 1945, the totalitarian dictatorship of Ante Pavelić pushed purist tendencies to extremes.

The language law of 1941 promulgated purity as a policy, and tried to eliminate internationalisms, stigmatized Serbisms and introduced etymological spelling (&quot;korijenski pravopis&quot;).

This era is best covered in Marko Samardžija&#x27;s 1993 book (&quot;Croatian language in the Independent State of Croatia&quot;).

===Second Yugoslavia===
In Communist Yugoslavia, Serbian terminology prevailed in a few areas: the military, diplomacy, Federal Yugoslav institutions (various institutes and research centres), state media and jurisprudence at Yugoslav level.

The methods used for this &quot;unification&quot; were manifold and chronologically multifarious; even in the eighties, a common &quot;argument&quot; was to claim that the opponents of the official Yugoslav language policy were sympathising with the &quot;Ustaša&quot; regime of World War 2, and that the incriminated words were thus &quot;ustašoid&quot; as well. Another method was to punish authors who fought against censorship. Linguists and philologists, the authors of dictionaries, grammars etc., were not allowed to write their works freely and according to the best of their professional knowledge and competence. Hence, for example, the whole edition of the &quot;Croatian Orthography&quot; (&#x27;Hrvatski pravopis&#x27;) edited by Babić-Finka-Moguš (1971) was destroyed in a paper factory just because it had been titled &quot;&quot;Croatian&quot; Orthography&quot; instead of &quot;Serbocroatian&quot; or &quot;Croatoserbian&quot; &quot;Orthography&quot;.

The passive Croatian vocabulary contained many banished words equivalent to the actively used words of the politically approved vocabulary. For example, the officers of the JNA could be publicly called only &quot;oficir&quot;, and not &quot;časnik&quot;. For the usage of word &quot;časnik&quot; (&#x27;officer&#x27;), coined by a father of Croatian scientific terminology Bogoslav Šulek, the physician Ivan Šreter was sentenced to 50 days in jail in 1987. Concordantly, the possibility of using the previously frequent word &quot;časnik&quot; was already reduced to the extent that before 1991 it could occur only in special contexts, e.g. in relation to historical events.

===After independence ===
After the disintegration of Yugoslavia and its subsequent wars, the situation changed. Suppression changed significantly with the rise of ethnic nationalism and the independence of Croatia, which enabled public usage of previously forbidden words in the semantic sphere of administration, army etc. As a consequence, formerly suppressed words switched from the more or less passive vocabulary of standard Croatian to the active one without any special stylistic marking.

Croatian linguists fought this wave of &quot;populist purism&quot;, led by various nationalist non-linguists. Ironically: the same people who were, for decades, stigmatised as ultra-Croatian &quot;linguistic nationalists&quot; (Stjepan Babić, Dalibor Brozović, Radoslav Katičić, Miro Kačić) have been accused as pro-Serbian &quot;political linguists&quot; simply because they opposed these &quot;language purges&quot; that wanted to purge numerous words of Church Slavonic origin (which are common not only to Croatian and Serbian, but are also present in Polish, Russian, Czech and other Slavic languages).

In 1993, the Dr. Ivan Šreter Award was created to promote creation of neologisms in Croatian.

Before 1994, the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ, which had come into power in 1990) considered ideas reminiscent of the Independent State of Croatia (Ustashe) language policy in the form of the so-called &quot;&quot;korijenski pravopis&quot;, but ultimately discarded it as too radical and instead made the &quot;londonski pravopis&quot;&quot;, originally made during the Croatian Spring, official.
At the time, extreme forms of purism were advocated by nationalist-minded linguists who were in turn described by Radoslav Katičić as &quot;marginal elements&quot;. The leaders of (mainstream) language purification were Stjepan Babić and Dalibor Brozović.

Since the 1990s, a form of language censorship has been practiced by the &quot;proofreaders&quot; (called &quot;lektori&quot;) in the media and schoolbooks. Despite forcing techniques for implementing purism, there has been significant resistance to purism in common usage. There have also been Croatian linguists that offer severe criticism of the language purism, e.g., Vladimir Anić, Snježana Kordić, Dubravko Škiljan, Kristina Štrkalj and Mate Kapović.

<doc id="330282" wikidata="Q335234" url="?curid=330282" title="Camcorder">
<text>A camcorder is a self-contained portable electronic device with video and recording as its primary function. It is typically equipped with an articulating screen mounted on the left side, a belt to facilitate holding on the right side, hot-swappable battery facing towards the user, hot-swappable recording media, and an internally contained quiet optical zoom lens.

The earliest camcorders were tape-based, recording analog signals onto videotape cassettes. In the 2000s, digital recording became the norm, and additionally tape was replaced by storage media such as mini-HDD, MiniDVD, internal flash memory and SD cards.

More recent devices capable of recording video are camera phones and digital cameras primarily intended for still pictures, whereas dedicated camcorders are often equipped with more functions and interfaces than more common cameras, such as an internal optical zoom lens that is able to operate silently with no throttled speed, whereas cameras with protracting zoom lenses commonly throttle operation speed during video recording to minimize acoustic disturbance. Additionally, dedicated units are able to operate solely on external power with no battery inserted.

== History ==

 Video cameras originally designed for television broadcast were large and heavy, mounted on special pedestals and wired to remote recorders in separate rooms. As technology improved, out-of-studio video recording was possible with compact video cameras and portable video recorders; a detachable recording unit could be carried to a shooting location. Although the camera itself was compact, the need for a separate recorder made on-location shooting a two-person job. Specialized videocassette recorders were introduced by JVC (VHS) and Sony (U-matic, with Betamax) releasing a model for mobile work. Portable recorders meant that recorded video footage could be aired on the early-evening news, since it was no longer necessary to develop film.

In 1983, Sony released the first camcorder, the Betacam system, for professional use. A key component was a single camera-recorder unit, eliminating a cable between the camera and recorder and increasing the camera operator&#x27;s freedom. The Betacam used the same cassette format ( tape) as the Betamax, but with a different, incompatible recording format. It became standard equipment for broadcast news.

Sony released the first consumer camcorder in 1983, the Betamovie BMC-100P. It used a Betamax cassette and rested on the operator&#x27;s shoulder, due to a design not permitting a single-handed grip. That year, JVC released the first VHS-C camcorder. Kodak announced a new camcorder format in 1984, the 8 mm video format. Sony introduced its compact 8 mm Video8 format in 1985. That year, Panasonic, RCA and Hitachi began producing camcorders using a full-size VHS cassette with a three-hour capacity. These shoulder-mount camcorders were used by videophiles, industrial videographers and college TV studios. Full-size Super-VHS (S-VHS) camcorders were released in 1987, providing an inexpensive way to collect news segments or other videographies. Sony upgraded Video8, releasing the Hi8 in competition with S-VHS.

Digital technology emerged with the 1986 Sony D1, a device which recorded uncompressed data and required a large amount of bandwidth for its time. In 1992 Ampex introduced DCT, the first digital video format with data compression using the discrete cosine transform algorithm present in most commercial digital video formats. In 1995 Sony, JVC, Panasonic and other video-camera manufacturers launched DV, which became a &quot;de facto&quot; standard for home video production, independent filmmaking and citizen journalism. That year, Ikegami introduced Editcam (the first tapeless video recording system).

Camcorders using DVD media were popular at the turn of the 21st century due to the convenience of being able to drop a disc into the family DVD player; however, DVD capability, due to the limitations of the format, is largely limited to consumer-level equipment targeted at people who are not likely to spend any great amount of effort video editing their video footage. Hitachi released the world&#x27;s first DVD-RAM camcorder in 2000, using the more compact 8 cm MiniDVD.
===High definition (HD)===

The Sony HDVS system, launched in 1984, allowed 1080i recording in the late 1990s. Sony later released a HD version of Betacam called HDCAM in 1997.

Panasonic launched DVCPRO HD in 2000, expanding the DV codec to support high definition (HD). The format was intended for professional camcorders, and used full-size DVCPRO cassettes. In 2003 Sony, JVC, Canon and Sharp introduced HDV as the first affordable HD video format, due to its use of inexpensive MiniDV cassettes.

===Tapeless===

Sony introduced the XDCAM tapeless video format in 2003, introducing the Professional Disc (PFD). Panasonic followed in 2004 with its P2 solid state memory cards as a recording medium for DVCPRO-HD video. In 2006 Panasonic and Sony introduced AVCHD as an inexpensive, tapeless, high-definition video format. AVCHD camcorders are produced by Sony, Panasonic, Canon, JVC and Hitachi. About this time, some consumer grade camcorders with hard disk and/or memory card recording used MOD and TOD file formats, accessible by USB from a PC.

===3D===

In 2010, after the success of James Cameron&#x27;s 2009 3D film &quot;Avatar&quot;, full 1080p HD 3D camcorders entered the market. With the proliferation of file-based digital formats, the relationship between recording media and recording format has declined; video can be recorded onto different media. With tapeless formats, recording media are storage for digital files.
In 2011 Panasonic, Sony, and JVC released consumer-grade camcorders capable of filming in 3D. Panasonic released the HDC-SDT750. It is a 2D camcorder which can shoot in HD; 3D is achieved by a detachable conversion lens. Sony released a 3D camcorder, the HDR-TD10, with two lenses built in for 3D filming, and can optionally shoot 2D video. Panasonic has also released 2D camcorders with an optional 3D conversion lens. The HDC-SD90, HDC-SD900, HDC-TM900 and HDC-HS900 are sold as &quot;3D-ready&quot;: 2D camcorders, with optional 3D capability at a later date. JVC also released a twin-lens camcorder in 2011, JVC Everio GS-TD1.

===4K Ultra HD===

In CES (January) 2014, Sony announced the second consumer/low-end professional (&quot;&quot;) camcorder Sony FDR-AX100 with a 1&quot; 20.9MP sensor able to shoot 4K video in 3840x2160 pixels 30fps or 24fps in the XAVC-S format; in standard HD the camcorder can also deliver 60fps. When using the traditional format AVCHD, the camcorder supports 5.1 surround sound from its built-in microphone, this is however not supported in the XAVC-S format. The camera also has a 3-step ND filter switch allowing greater control of how much light can enter the camera for maintaining a shallow depth of field or giving a softer appearance to motion. For one hour video shooting in 4K the camera needs about 32 GB to accommodate a data transfer rate of 50 Mbit/s. The camera&#x27;s MSRP in the US is US$2,000.

In 2015, consumer UHD (3840x2160) camcorders below US$1000 became available. Sony released the FDRAX33, and Panasonic released the HC-WX970K and the HC-VX870.

In September 2014 Panasonic announced and claimed 4K Ultra HD Camcorder HC-X1000E as the first conventional camcorder design that can capture up to 60fps at 150 Mbit/s or alternatively standard HD recording at up to 200 Mbit/s in ALL-I mode with MP4, MOV and AVCHD formats all offered depending on the resolution and frame rate. With use 1/2.3&quot; small sensor as commonly is used by bridge cameras, the camcorder has 20x optical zoom in a compact body with dual XLR audio inputs, Internal ND filters and separate control rings for focus, iris and zoom. In HD capture, the camcorder enables in-camera downscaling of the 4K image to HD to reduce noise inherent in the smaller sensor.

As of January 2017, the only major manufacturer to announce new consumer camcorders at CES (Consumer Electronic Show) in Las Vegas was Canon with its entry-level HD models. Panasonic only announced details regarding their Mirrorless Micro Four Thirds Digital Camera called the LUMIX GH5, capable of shooting 4K in 60p. This is the first time in decades that Panasonic and Sony have not announced new traditional camcorders at CES, and instead carried over 2016&#x27;s models, such as Sony&#x27;s FDR-AX53. This is due to there being far less demand in the market for traditional camcorders as more and more consumers prefer to record video with their 4K-capable smartphones, DSLRs, and action cameras from GoPro, Xiaomi, Sony, Nikon, and many others.

== Components ==
Camcorders have three major components: lens, imager and recorder. The lens gathers light, focusing it on the imager. The imager (usually a CCD or CMOS sensor; earlier models used vidicon tubes) converts incident light into an electrical signal. The recorder converts the electrical signal to video, encoding it in a storable form. The lens and imager comprise the &quot;camera&quot; section.

=== Lens ===
The lens is the first component of the light path. Camcorder optics generally have one or more of the following controls:
* Aperture (or iris): Regulates exposure and controls depth of field
* Zoom: Controls focal length and angle of view
* Shutter speed: Regulates exposure to maintain desired motion portrayal
* Gain: Amplifies signal strength in low-light conditions
* Neutral density filter: Regulates exposure intensity

In consumer units these adjustments are often automatically controlled by the camcorder, but can be adjusted manually if desired. Professional-grade units offer user control of all major optical functions.

=== Imager ===
The imager, often a CCD, or a photodiode array which may be an Active Pixel Sensor, converts light into an electrical signal. The camera lens projects an image onto the imager surface, exposing the photosensitive array to light. This light exposure is converted into an electrical charge. At the end of the timed exposure, the imager converts the accumulated charge into a continuous analog voltage at the imager&#x27;s output terminals. After the conversion is complete, the photosites reset to start the exposure of the next video frame. In many cases the photosites (per pixel) are actually reset globally by charging to a fixed voltage, and discharged towards zero individually proportionally to the accumulated light, because it is simpler to manufacture the sensor that way.

Most camcorders use a single imaging sensor with integrated colour filters, per pixel, to enable red, green and blue to be sensed, each on their own set of pixels. The individual pixel filters present a significant manufacturing challenge. However some camcorders, even consumer grade devices such as the JVC GZ-HD3, introduced around 2007, are triple sensor cameras, usually CCD but could be CMOS. In this case the exact alignment of the three sensors so that the red, green and blue components of the video output are correctly aligned, is the manufacturing challenge.

=== Recorder ===
The recorder writes the video signal onto a recording medium, such as magnetic videotape. Since the record function involves many signal-processing steps, some distortion and noise historically appeared on the stored video; playback of the stored signal did not have the exact characteristics and detail as a live video feed. All camcorders have a recorder-controlling section, allowing the user to switch the recorder into playback mode for reviewing recorded footage, and an image-control section controlling exposure, focus and color balance.

The image recorded need not be limited to what appeared in the viewfinder. For documenting events (as in law enforcement), the field of view overlays the time and date of the recording along the top and bottom of the image. The police car or constable badge number to which the recorder was given, the car&#x27;s speed at the time of recording, compass direction and geographical coordinates may also be seen.

== Functionality ==
Dedicated camcorders are usually equipped with optical image stabilization, optical zoom, stereo microphone, and touch screen.

Additional possible features include a viewfinder (usually digital), a pressure-sensitive knob for zooming at a controllable speed, LED lamp for illuminating in darkness – possibly with an option to adjust automatically, night vision which may be assisted by an infrared lamp, still photography, the ability to capture still photos while filming – usually at a higher resolution than the video, the ability to lock the OIS on far subjects while zoomed in (named &quot;OIS Lock&quot; by Panasonic), the ability to buffer footage before pressing the &quot;record&quot; button to avoid missing moments without having to be constantly recording (named &quot;PRE-REC&quot; by Panasonic), the ability to keep the lens cover open for few minutes into stand-by mode for rapid restarting, internal storage for recording when the inserted memory card&#x27;s space is exhausted, autofocus able to track objects, and optional visual effects during video recording and playback.:p37

Metadata such as date/time and technical parameters may be stored in a separate subtitle track. The former allows measuring the exact and undistorted recording time of scenes even if intermittently paused, and the latter may encompass aperture, frames&#x27; exposure duration, exposure value, and photosensitivity.

On digital camcorders, the video resolution, frame rate, and/or bit rate may be adjustable between higher quality but larger file sizes and lower quality but extended recording time on remaining storage. The image sensor may have a higher resolution than the recorded video, allowing for lossless digital zoom by cropping the area read out from the image sensor.

The video player may allow for navigation between individual frames and extraction of still frames from footage to standalone pictures.

== Types ==

=== Analog and digital ===

Camcorders are often classified by their storage device; VHS, VHS-C, Betamax, Video8 are examples of late 20th century videotape-based camcorders which record video in analog form. Digital video camcorder formats include Digital8, MiniDV, DVD, hard disk drive, direct to disk recording and solid-state, semiconductor flash memory. While all these formats record video in digital form, Digital8, MiniDV, DVD and hard-disk drives have no longer been manufactured in consumer camcorders since 2006.

In the earliest analog camcorders the imaging device is vacuum-tube technology, in which the charge of a light-sensitive target was directly proportional to the amount of light striking it; the Vidicon is an example of such an imaging tube. Newer analog, and digital camcorders use a solid-state charge-coupled imaging device (CCD) or a CMOS imager. Both are analog detectors, using photodiodes to pass a current proportional to the light striking them. The current is then digitised before being electronically scanned and fed to the imager&#x27;s output. The main difference between the two devices is how the scanning is done. In the CCD the diodes are sampled simultaneously, and the scan passes the digitised data from one register to the next. In CMOS devices, the diodes are sampled directly by the scanning logic.

Digital video storage retains higher-quality video than analog storage, especially on the prosumer and strictly consumer levels. MiniDV storage allows full-resolution video (720x576 for PAL, 720x480 for NTSC), unlike analog consumer-video standards. Digital video does not experience colour bleeding, jitter, or fade.

Unlike analog formats, digital formats do not experience generation loss during copying; however, they are more prone to complete loss. Although digital information can theoretically be stored indefinitely without deterioration, some digital formats (like MiniDV) place tracks only about 10 micrometers apart (compared with 19–58 μm for VHS). A digital recording is more vulnerable to wrinkles or stretches in the tape which could erase data, but tracking and error-correction code on the tape compensates for most defects. On analog media, similar damage registers as &quot;noise&quot; in the video, leaving a deteriorated (but watchable) video. DVDs may develop DVD rot, losing large chunks of data. An analog recording may be &quot;usable&quot; after its storage media deteriorates severely, but slight media degradation in digital recordings may trigger an &quot;all or nothing&quot; failure; the digital recording will be unplayable without extensive restoration.

=== Recording media ===
Older digital camcorders record video onto tape digitally, microdrives, hard drives, and small DVD-RAM or DVD-Rs. Newer machines since 2006 record video onto flash memory devices and internal solid-state drives in MPEG-1, MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 format. Because these codecs use inter-frame compression, frame-specific editing requires frame regeneration, additional processing and may lose picture information. Codecs storing each frame individually, easing frame-specific scene editing, are common in professional use.

Other digital consumer camcorders record in DV or HDV format on tape, transferring content over FireWire or USB 2.0 to a computer where large files (for DV, 1 GB for 4 to 4.6 minutes in PAL/NTSC resolutions) can be edited, converted and recorded back to tape. The transfer is done in real time, so the transfer of a 60-minute tape requires one hour to transfer and about 13 GB of disk space for the raw footage (plus space for rendered files and other media).

==== Tapeless ====
A tapeless camcorder is a camcorder that does not use video tape for the digital recording of video productions as 20th century ones did. Tapeless camcorders record video as digital computer files onto data storage devices such as optical discs, hard disk drives and solid-state flash memory cards.

Inexpensive pocket video cameras use flash memory cards, while some more expensive camcorders use solid-state drives or SSD; similar flash technology is used on semi-pro and high-end professional video cameras for ultrafast transfer of high-definition television (HDTV) content.

Most consumer-level tapeless camcorders use MPEG-2, MPEG-4 or its derivatives as video coding formats. They are normally capable of still-image capture to JPEG format additionally.

Consumer-grade tapeless camcorders include a USB port to transfer video onto a computer. Professional models include other options like Serial digital interface (SDI) or HDMI. Some tapeless camcorders are equipped with a FireWire (IEEE-1394) port to ensure compatibility with magnetic tape-based DV and HDV formats.

=== Consumer market ===
Since the consumer market favors ease of use, portability and price, most consumer-grade camcorders emphasize handling and automation over audio and video performance. Most devices with camcorder capability are camera phones or compact digital cameras, in which video is a secondary capability. Some pocket cameras, mobile phones and camcorders are shock-, dust- and waterproof.

The consumer camcorder was generally still very expensive throughout the early to mid 1990s, but prices compared to the 1980s had halved for an entry-level model and fell even further at the turn of the millennium, placing them in easier reach of basic-income consumers with the addition of available and more easy to obtain credit to spread payments.

This market has followed an evolutionary path driven by miniaturization and cost reduction enabled by progress in design and manufacture. Miniaturization reduces the imager&#x27;s ability to gather light; designers have balanced improvements in sensor sensitivity with size reduction, shrinking the camera imager and optics while maintaining relatively noise-free video in daylight. Indoor or dim-light shooting is generally quiet, and in such conditions artificial lighting is recommended. Mechanical controls cannot shrink below a certain size, and manual camera operation has given way to camera-controlled automation for every shooting parameter (including focus, aperture, shutter speed and color balance). The few models with manual override are menu-driven. Outputs include USB 2.0, Composite and S-Video and IEEE 1394/FireWire (for MiniDV models).

The high end of the consumer market emphasizes user control and advanced shooting modes. More-expensive consumer camcorders offer manual exposure control, HDMI output and external audio input, progressive-scan frame rates (24fps, 25fps, 30fps) and higher-quality lenses than basic models. To maximize low-light capability, color reproduction and frame resolution, multi-CCD/CMOS camcorders mimic the 3-element imager design of professional equipment. Field tests have shown that most consumer camcorders (regardless of price) produce noisy video in low light.

Before the 21st century, video editing required two recorders and a desktop video workstation to control them. A typical home personal computer can hold several hours of standard-definition video, and is fast enough to edit footage without additional upgrades. Most consumer camcorders are sold with basic video editing software, so users can create their own DVDs or share edited footage online.

Since 2006, nearly all camcorders sold are digital. Tape-based (MiniDV/HDV) camcorders are no longer popular, since tapeless models (with an SD card or internal SSD) cost almost the same but offer greater convenience; video captured on an SD card can be transferred to a computer faster than digital tape. None of the consumer-class camcorders announced at the 2006 International Consumer Electronics Show recorded on tape.

=== Other devices ===
Video-capture capability is not confined to camcorders. Cellphones, digital single-lens reflex and compact digicams, laptops and personal media players offer video-capture capability, but most multipurpose devices offer less video-capture functionality than an equivalent camcorder. Most lack manual adjustments, audio input, autofocus and zoom. Few capture in standard TV-video formats (480p60, 720p60, 1080i30), recording in either non-TV resolutions (320x240, 640x480) or slower frame rates (15 or 30 fps).

A multipurpose device used as a camcorder offers inferior handling, audio and video performance, which limits its utility for extended or adverse shooting situations. The camera phone developed video capability during the early 21st century, reducing sales of low-end camcorders.

DSLR cameras with high-definition video were also introduced early in the 21st century. Although they still have the handling and usability deficiencies of other multipurpose devices, HDSLR video offers the shallow depth-of-field and interchangeable lenses lacking in consumer camcorders. Professional video cameras with these capabilities are more expensive than the most expensive video-capable DSLR. In video applications where the DSLR&#x27;s operational deficiencies can be mitigated, DSLRs such as the Canon 5D Mark II provide depth-of-field and optical-perspective control.

Combo-cameras combine full-feature still cameras and camcorders in a single unit. The Sanyo Xacti HD1 was the first such unit, combining the features of a 5.1 megapixel still camera with a 720p video recorder with improved handling and utility. Canon and Sony have introduced camcorders with still-photo performance approaching that of a digicam, and Panasonic has introduced a DSLR body with video features approaching that of a camcorder. Hitachi has introduced the DZHV 584E/EW, with 1080p resolution and a touch screen.

===Flip Video===

The Flip Video was a series of tapeless camcorders introduced by Pure Digital Technologies in 2006. Slightly larger than a smartphone, the Flip Video was a basic camcorder with record, zoom, playback and browse buttons and a USB jack for uploading video. The original models recorded at a 640x480-pixel resolution; later models featured HD recording at 1280x720 pixels. The Mino was a smaller Flip Video, with the same features as the standard model. The Mino was the smallest of all camcorders, slightly wider than a MiniDV cassette and smaller than most smartphones on the market. In fact the Mino was small enough to fit inside the shell of a VHS cassette. Later HD models featured larger screens. In 2011, the Flip Video (more recently manufactured by Cisco) was discontinued.

===Interchangeable lenses===
Interchangeable-lens camcorders can capture HD video with DSLR lenses and an adapter.

===Built-in projector===
In 2011, Sony launched its HDR-PJ range of HD camcorders: the HDR-PJ10, 30 and 50. Known as Handycams, they were the first camcorders to incorporate a small image projector on the side of the unit. This feature allows a group of viewers to watch video without a television, a full-size projector or a computer. These camcorders were a huge success and Sony subsequently released further models in this range. Sony&#x27;s 2014 line up comprises the HDR-PJ240, HDR-PJ330 (entry-level models), HDR-PJ530 (mid-range model) and the HDR-PJ810 (top of the range). Specifications vary by model.

== Uses ==

=== Media ===
Camcorders are used by nearly all electronic media, from electronic-news organizations to current-affairs TV productions. In remote locations, camcorders are useful for initial video acquisition; the video is subsequently transmitted electronically to a studio or production center for broadcast. Scheduled events (such as press conferences), where a video infrastructure is readily available or can be deployed in advance, are still covered by studio-type video cameras &quot;tethered&quot; to production trucks.

=== Home movies ===
Camcorders often cover weddings, birthdays, graduations, children&#x27;s growth and other personal events. The rise of the consumer camcorder during the mid- to late 1980s led to the creation of TV shows such as &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, which showcases homemade video footage.

=== Entertainment ===

Camcorders are used in the production of low-budget TV shows if the production crew lacks access to more expensive equipment. Movies have been shot entirely on consumer camcorder equipment, including &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot;. Academic filmmaking programs switched from 16mm film to digital video in the early 2010s, due to the reduced expense and ease of editing of digital media and the increasing scarcity of film stock and equipment. Some camcorder manufacturers cater to this market; Canon and Panasonic support 24p (24 fps, progressive scan—the same frame rate as cinema film) video in some high-end models for easy film conversion.

=== Education ===
Schools in the developed world increasingly use digital media and digital education. Students use camcorders to record video diaries, make short films and develop multi-media projects across subject boundaries. Teacher evaluation involves a teacher&#x27;s classroom lessons being recorded for review by officials, especially for questions of teacher tenure.

Student camcorder-created material and other digital technology are used in new-teacher preparation courses. The University of Oxford Department of Education PGCE programme and NYU&#x27;s Steinhardt School&#x27;s Department of Teaching and Learning MAT programme are examples.

The USC Rossier School of Education goes further, insisting that all students purchase their own camcorder (or similar) as a prerequisite to their MAT education programs (many of which are delivered online). These programs employ a modified version of Adobe Connect to deliver the courses. Recordings of MAT student work are posted on USC&#x27;s web portal for evaluation by faculty as if they were present in class. Camcorders have allowed USC to decentralize its teacher preparation from Southern California to most American states and abroad; this has increased the number of teachers it can train.

*DVCPRO (1995): Panasonic released its own variant of the DV format for broadcast news-gathering.
*DVCAM (1996): Sony&#x27;s answer to the DVCPRO
*DVD recordable (1996): A variety of recordable optical disc standards were released by multiple manufacturers during the 1990s and 2000s, of which DVD-RAM was the first. The most common in camcorders was MiniDVD-R, which used recordable 8 cm discs holding 30 minutes of MPEG video.
*D-VHS (1998): JVC&#x27;s VHS tape supporting 720p/1080i HD; many units also supported IEEE 1394 recording.

*Multiview Video Coding: Amendment to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video compression for sequences captured from multiple cameras using a single video stream; backwards-compatible with H.264

== Operating systems ==
Since most manufacturers focus their support on Windows and Mac users, users of other operating systems have difficulty finding support for their devices. However, open-source products such as Kdenlive, Cinelerra and Kino (written for the Linux operating system) allow editing of most popular digital formats on alternative operating systems and can be used in conjunction with OBS for online broadcast solutions; software to edit DV streams is available on most platforms.

==Digital forensics==
The issue of digital-camcorder forensics to recover data (e.g. video files with timestamps) has been addressed.

<text>Faverges (; ) is a former commune located in Haute-Savoie department situated in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region (south-east of France). On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Faverges-Seythenex.

It occupies a glacial valley which gave birth to the Lake Annecy.

==Geology==
Originally, at the end of the ice age, the lake extended some 30 km, from Sillingy all the way to the site of Faverges, at the base of the Dent de Cons mountain. In those times, the waters of the lake joined the river Isère, and people first settled the lakeshores and sunny slopes.

==History==
The digs in Viuz and at the Thovey site in Faverges have yielded a great deal of information about Gallo-Roman times, some two thousand years ago. The &quot;vicus&quot; of Viuz, which covered some fifty acres (200,000 m2), was an important stop along the Roman road which ran from Turin to Geneva. Merovingian times also left numerous traces on the landscape. In the Middle Ages, pre-industrial metalworks were renowned for their iron and copper tools and jewelry. Numerous forges, making nails, clasps, and all types of iron implements, were built along the rivers and streams from which they derived some of their energy needs. The Tamié Abbey was founded in 1132, and Faverges castle around 1250. At that time, Rodolphe (or &quot;Ruph&quot;) lived a hermit&#x27;s life on a nearby mountain and left his name to the hamlet of St. Ruph. The deep religious fervor of the 14th and 15th centuries is responsible for the ten chapels and sanctuaries dedicated to St. Ruph in the area.

The French Revolution left few traces on the community, except for some vandalism to the town church. In 1811, the castle was turned into a cotton-weaving factory, thus launching Faverges into the Industrial Revolution. This is a fitting heritage for a town whose name derives from the Latin &quot;faber&quot;, &quot;fabricae&quot; (&quot;manufacture&quot;).

==Economy==
Faverges now has several important factories (Stäubli, S.T. Dupont, Bourgeois) providing some 2,500 jobs, which is especially remarkable in that Faverges itself has only some 7,000 inhabitants.

<text>Robert Norman Munsch (born June 11, 1945) is an American-born, Canadian children&#x27;s author.

==Personal life and career==
Robert Munsch was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on June 11, 1945. He grew up in a family of nine children. Munsch graduated from Fordham University in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and from Boston University in 1971 with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology.

Munsch studied to become a Jesuit priest, but decided he would rather work with children after having jobs at orphanages and daycare centers. In 1973, Munsch received a Master of Education in Child Studies from Tufts University. He moved to Canada in 1975 to work at the preschool at the University of Guelph in Guelph, Ontario. Munsch also taught in the College of Family and Consumer Studies at the University of Guelph as a lecturer and as an assistant professor. In Guelph, he was encouraged to publish the many stories he made up for the children he worked with.

One of Munsch&#x27;s best-known books, &quot;Love You Forever&quot;, was listed fourth on the 2001 &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; All-Time Bestselling Children&#x27;s Books list for paperbacks at 6.97 million copies (not including the 1.049 million hardcover copies). It has since sold over 30 million copies and has been featured on the episode &quot;The One With the Cake&quot; from the NBC television show &quot;Friends&quot;, as well as being mentioned by talk show host Oprah Winfrey on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; as being her favorite children&#x27;s book. Munsch&#x27;s other famous book, &quot;The Paper Bag Princess&quot;, has sold over seven million copies and is considered to be a feminist story, as well as a literary classic.

Munsch and his wife, Ann, discovered they could not have biological children after two pregnancies ended with still-births. They have three children via adoption.

==Health==
Munsch has publicly talked about his bipolar disorder and addiction issues. In August 2008, Munsch suffered a stroke that affected his memory. He has since retired, but continued to publish two previously written books each year. On May 15, 2010, Munsch announced that he had been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive and manic-depressive disorder, and that he had a cocaine addiction that started in 2005 and was a recovering alcoholic; at the time, Munsch had been clean for four months, and had regularly attended Alcoholics Anonymous for the previous 25 years and Narcotics Anonymous meetings more recently. On October 2, 2021, Munsch told the CBC that he had been diagnosed with dementia and, as a result, can no longer write.

==Writing style==
Munsch is known for his exuberant storytelling methods, with exaggerated expressions and acted voices. He makes up his stories in front of audiences and refines them through repeated tellings.

Munsch&#x27;s stories do not have a recurring single character; instead, the characters are based on the children to whom he first told the story, including his own children. Munsch often performed at children&#x27;s festivals and appears at elementary schools, sometimes unannounced. In 1991, some of his books were adapted into an animated TV series &quot;A Bunch of Munsch&quot;, but made in Montreal and premiered on the pay-TV channel.

==Awards and honours==
In 1985, Munsch won a Juno Award for his portrayal of &quot;Murmel, Murmel, Munsch: More Outrageous Stories&quot;. In 1992, he was also chosen &quot;Author of the Year&quot; by the &quot;Canadian Booksellers&#x27; Association&quot;.

In 1999, Munsch was made a Member of the Order of Canada. On June 17, 2009, it was announced that Munsch would receive a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto. The induction ceremony was held on September 12, 2009, and in 2013, his star was revealed on King Street in Toronto.
In 2009, Robert Munsch Public School opened in Whitby, Ontario, and in 2014, a second Robert Munsch Public School opened in Mount Albert, Ontario.

Munsch is also the most stolen author at the Toronto Public Library.

<doc id="330297" wikidata="Q5251085" url="?curid=330297" title="Default argument">
<text>In computer programming, a default argument is an argument to a function that a programmer is not required to specify.
In most programming languages, functions may take one or more arguments. Usually, each argument must be specified in full (this is the case in the C programming language). Later languages (for example, in C++) allow the programmer to specify default arguments that always have a value, even if one is not specified when calling the function.

== Default arguments in C++ ==

Consider the following function declaration:
int MyFunc(int a, int b, int c = 12);
This function takes three arguments, of which the last one has a default of twelve. The programmer may call this function in two ways:
int result = MyFunc(1, 2, 3);
result = MyFunc(1, 2);
In the first case the value for the argument called &quot;c&quot; is specified explicitly. In the second case, the argument is omitted, and the default value of &quot;12&quot; will be used instead.
For the function called, there is no means to know if the argument has been specified by the caller or if the default value was used.

The above-mentioned method is especially useful when one wants to set default criteria so that the function can be called with or without parameters.
Consider the following:
void PrintGreeting(std::ostream&amp; stream = std::cout) {
 // This outputs a message to the given stream.
 stream « &quot;hello world!&quot;;


The function call:

PrintGreeting();

will by default print &quot;hello world!&quot; to the standard output codice_1 (typically the screen). On the other hand, any object of type codice_2 can now be passed to the same function and the function will print to the given stream instead of to the standard output. The example below sets the codice_3 to codice_4, and thus prints the output the standard error stream.
PrintGreeting(std::cerr);
Because default arguments&#x27; values are &quot;filled in&quot; at the call site rather than in the body of the function being called, virtual functions take their default argument values from the static type of the pointer or reference through which the call is made, rather than from the dynamic type of the object supplying the virtual function&#x27;s body.

struct Base {
 virtual std::pair&lt;int, int&gt; Foo(int x = 1) {
 return {x, 1};
};

struct Derived : public Base {
 std::pair&lt;int, int&gt; Foo(int x = 2) override {
 return {x, 2};
};

int main() {
 Derived d;
 Base&amp; b = d;
 assert(d.Foo() == std::make_pair(2, 2));
 assert(b.Foo() == std::make_pair(1, 2));


==Overloaded methods==
Some languages, such as Java, do not have default arguments. However, the same behaviour can be simulated by using method overloading to create overloaded methods of the same name, which take different numbers of arguments; and the versions with fewer arguments simply call the versions with more arguments, with the default arguments as the missing arguments:
int MyFunc(int a, int b) { return MyFunc(a, b, 12); }
int MyFunc(int a, int b, int c) { /* main implementation here */ }
However, in addition to several other disadvantages, since the default arguments are not modeled in the type system, the type of a callback (aka higher-order function) can&#x27;t express that it accepts either of the overloads nor simulate the default arguments with overloaded functions. Whereas, in JavaScript the non-overloaded function definition can substitute the default when the input value is codice_5 (regardless if it was implicitly codice_5 via the argument&#x27;s absence at the call site or an explicitly passed codice_5 value); which is modeled as an optional argument parameter type codice_8 in TypeScript. JavaScript&#x27;s solution is not resolved statically (i.e. not at compile-time, which is why TypeScript models only the optionality and not the default values in the function&#x27;s type signature) thus incurs additional runtime overhead, although it does provide more flexibility in that callbacks can independently control their defaults instead of centrally dictated by the (callback&#x27;s type signature in the) type signature of the function which inputs the callback. The TypeScript solution can be simulated in Java with the codice_9 type except the analogous of an implicit codice_5 for each absent argument is an explicit codice_11 at the call site.

==Evaluation==

For every function call default argument values must be passed to the called function. If a default argument value contains side-effects, it is significant when those side effects are evaluated – once for the entire program (at parse time, compile time, or load time), or once per function call, at call time.

Python is a notable language that evaluates expressions in default arguments once, at the time the function declaration is evaluated. If evaluation per function call is desired, it can be replicated by having the default argument be a sentinel value, such as codice_12, and then having the body of the function evaluate the default value&#x27;s side effects only if the sentinel value was passed in.

For example:

import random

def eager(a=random.random()):
 return a

x = eager()
y = eager()
assert x == y

def lazy(a=None):
 if a is None:
 a = random.random()
 return a

x = lazy()
y = lazy()
assert x != y
==Extent==
Generally a default argument will behave identically to an argument passed by parameter or a local variable declared at the start of the function, and have the same scope and extent (lifetime) as a parameter or other local variable, namely an automatic variable which is deallocated on function termination.

In other cases a default argument may instead be statically allocated. If the variable is mutable, it will then retain its value across function calls, as with a static variable.

This behavior is found in Python for mutable types, such as lists. As with evaluation, in order to ensure the same extent as a local variable, one can use a sentinel value:

def eager(a=[]):
 return a

x = eager()

<text>Montmin () is a former commune in the Haute-Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in south-eastern France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Talloires-Montmin.

Inhabitants of the commune are known as Montminois (male) and Montminoises (female).

==Geography==
The seven hamlets occupy a four-mile long valley which is bordered on the west by Mont Chenevier, and on the east by the impressive and snow-capped Tournette massif. According to locals, Noah&#x27;s Ark landed at the Col de l&#x27;Aulp, whose valley is indeed shaped like a ship; Noah, Biblical father of viticulture, would have planted the lakeside vineyards of Talloires, which produced wines and brandy until the 1950s. The mean elevation of the village is 1000 meters, or 3250 feet above sea level.

==History==
First settled in the early Middle Ages, shortly after the year 1000, the hamlets were farming communities that existed almost entirely independently of the outside world until the advent of modern transportation.

==Tourism==

With the arrival of modern roads and vehicles, Montmin has become a tourist attraction renowned for the scenic Col de la Forclaz mountain pass, one of the premier hang gliding and paragliding sites in Europe. Montmin hosted the 1995 Hang Gliding Championships of France. And in July 1997 Montmin watched the Tour de France bicycle race come through the community, up from Faverges, over the Col de la Forclaz and back down toward Bluffy and the high Alps to the east.

Unlike its neighbors in the high Alps (La Clusaz, Megève, etc.), Montmin has not become a vast urbanized winter playground crisscrossed with ski lifts and dotted with large hotels and apartment buildings. Cautious zoning and deliberately limited development have allowed Montmin to retain much of its charm as a quiet agricultural community, even though it is a mere twenty minutes from downtown Annecy.

In the winter, Montmin&#x27;s small ski lifts are known as a good place for beginning and intermediate skiers; many of the villagers are certified ski instructors, and many children of the Annecy and Faverges area first learned to ski in Montmin. In the summer, the same lifts are used for summer gliding sports. Montmin&#x27;s principal claim to fame is as the starting point of several popular hiking trails, including the scenic climb up Mt. Tournette, the tallest of the mountains overlooking Lake Annecy.

A hotel and several restaurants at the Col de la Forclaz mountain pass receive thousands of tourists who come to enjoy the excellent view of Lake Annecy. These facilities offer comfortable accommodations and traditional Savoy country cooking.

==Miscellaneous==
The local cheese dairy farms produce the renowned Tomme and Reblochon cheeses for which the area is famous.

At the dawn of the 21st century, Montmin&#x27;s population is beginning to grow again as the village finds a new role as a dormitory for the cities of Annecy and Faverges, though it retains much of its rustic charm.

<doc id="330304" wikidata="Q730302" url="?curid=330304" title="Zygomatic arch">
<text>In anatomy, the zygomatic arch (colloquially known as the cheek bone), is a part of the skull formed by the zygomatic process of the temporal bone (a bone extending forward from the side of the skull, over the opening of the ear) and the temporal process of the zygomatic bone (the side of the cheekbone), the two being united by an oblique suture (the zygomaticotemporal suture); the tendon of the temporal muscle passes medial to (i.e. through the middle of) the arch, to gain insertion into the coronoid process of the mandible (jawbone). 

The jugal point is the point at the anterior (towards face) end of the upper border of the zygomatic arch where the masseteric and maxillary edges meet at an angle, and where it meets the process of the zygomatic bone.

The arch is typical of &quot;Synapsida&quot; (&quot;fused arch&quot;), a clade of amniotes that includes mammals and their extinct relatives, such as &quot;Moschops&quot; and &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;.

While the terms zygomatic arch and cheekbone are often used interchangeably, the arch is a specific anatomical structure within the cheekbone (zygomatic bone).

==Structure==
The zygomatic process of the temporal arises by two roots:
* an &quot;anterior&quot;, directed inward in front of the mandibular fossa, where it expands to form the articular tubercle.
* a &quot;posterior&quot;, which runs backward above the external acoustic meatus and is continuous with the supramastoid crest.

The upper border of the arch gives attachment to the temporal fascia; the lower border and medial surface give origin to the masseter.

==Society and culture==
High cheekbones are pronounced zygomatic arches, causing the upper part of the cheeks to jut out and form a line cut into the sides of the face. High cheekbones, forming a symmetrical face shape, are very common in fashion models and may be considered a beauty trait in both males and females within Eurocentric beauty standards.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;zygomatic&quot; derives from the Greek ζύγωμα zygōma, meaning &quot;bolt, bar&quot;, derived from ζυγο-, &quot;yoke, join&quot;. The Greek word was already used with this anatomical sense by Galen (2.437, 746) in the 2nd century AD. The zygomatic arch is occasionally referred to as the zygoma, but this term usually refers to the zygomatic bone or occasionally the zygomatic process.

==Other animals==
The zygomatic arch is significant in evolutionary biology, as it is part of the structures derived from the ancestral single temporal fenestra of the synapsid ancestor of mammals.

<doc id="330305" wikidata="Q2655" url="?curid=330305" title="John Franklin">
<text>Sir John Franklin (16 April 1786 – 11 June 1847) was a British Royal Navy officer, explorer and colonial administrator. After serving in the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812, he led two expeditions into the Canadian Arctic and through the islands of the Arctic Archipelago, during the Coppermine expedition of 1819 and the Mackenzie River expedition of 1825, and served as Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land from 1837 to 1843. During his third and final expedition, an attempt to traverse the Northwest Passage in 1845, Franklin&#x27;s ships became icebound off King William Island in what is now Nunavut, where he died in June 1847. The icebound ships were abandoned ten months later, and the entire crew died from causes such as starvation, hypothermia, and scurvy.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Franklin was born in Spilsby, Lincolnshire, on , the ninth of twelve children born to Hannah Weekes and Willingham Franklin. His father was a merchant descended from a line of country gentlemen, while his mother was the daughter of a farmer. One of his brothers later entered the legal profession and eventually became a judge in Madras; another joined the East India Company; while a sister, Sarah, was the mother of Emily Tennyson, wife of Alfred, Lord Tennyson. John Franklin must have been affected by an obvious desire to better his social and economic position, given that his elder brothers struggled, sometimes successfully and sometimes not, to establish themselves in a wide variety of careers.

Educated at King Edward VI Grammar School in Louth, he soon became interested in a career at sea. His father, who intended for Franklin to enter the church or become a businessman, was initially opposed but was reluctantly convinced to allow him to go on a trial voyage on a merchant ship when he was aged 12. His experience of seafaring only confirmed his interest in a career at sea, so in March 1800, Franklin&#x27;s father secured him a Royal Navy appointment on .

Commanded by Captain Lawford, the &quot;Polyphemus&quot; carried 64 guns and, at the time of Franklin&#x27;s appointment, was still at sea. He did not join the vessel until the autumn of 1800. Initially serving as a first-class volunteer, Franklin soon saw action in the Battle of Copenhagen in which the &quot;Polyphemus&quot; participated as part of Horatio Nelson&#x27;s squadron. An expedition around the coast of Australia aboard , commanded by Captain Matthew Flinders, followed, with Franklin now a midshipman. He accompanied Captain Nathaniel Dance on the , frightening off Admiral Charles de Durand-Linois at the Battle of Pulo Aura in the South China Sea on . He was present at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 aboard . During the War of 1812 against the United States, Franklin, now a lieutenant, served aboard and was wounded during the Battle of Lake Borgne on 14 December 1814.

Franklin commanded HMS Trent in 1818 on a journey from London to Spitzbergen, now Svalbard. The overall expedition was commanded by Captain David Buchan on HMS &quot;Dorothea&quot;.

=== 1819: Coppermine expedition ===

In 1819, Franklin was chosen to lead the Coppermine expedition overland from Hudson Bay to chart the north coast of Canada eastwards from the mouth of the Coppermine River. On his 1819 expedition, Franklin fell into the Hayes River at Robinson Falls and was rescued by a member of his expedition about downstream.

Between 1819 and 1822, he lost 11 of the 20 men in his party. Most died of starvation or exhaustion, but there were also at least one murder and suggestions of cannibalism. The survivors were forced to eat lichen and even attempted to eat their own leather boots. This gained Franklin the nickname of &quot;the man who ate his boots&quot;.

=== 1823: Marriage and third Arctic expedition ===

In 1823, after returning to England, Franklin married the poet Eleanor Anne Porden. Their daughter, Eleanor Isabella, was born the following year. His wife died of tuberculosis in 1825. Eleanor Isabella married Reverend John Philip Gell in 1849. She died in 1860.

In 1825, he left for his second Canadian and third Arctic expedition, the Mackenzie River expedition. The goal this time was the mouth of the Mackenzie River from which he would follow the coast westward and possibly meet Frederick William Beechey who would try to sail northeast from the Bering Strait. With him was John Richardson who would follow the coast east from the Mackenzie to the mouth of the Coppermine River.

At the same time, William Edward Parry would try to sail west from the Atlantic. (Beechey reached Point Barrow and Parry became frozen-in to the east. At this time, the only known points on the north coast were a hundred or so miles east from the Bering Strait, the mouth of the Mackenzie, Franklin&#x27;s stretch east of the Coppermine, and a bit of the Gulf of Boothia which had been seen briefly from the land.) Supplies were better organised this time, in part because they were managed by Peter Warren Dease of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC).

After reaching Great Slave Lake using the standard HBC route, Franklin took a reconnaissance trip down the Mackenzie and on , became the second European to reach its mouth. He erected a flagpole with buried letters for Parry. He returned to winter at Fort Franklin (modern-day Délı̨nę) on Great Bear Lake. The following summer he went downriver and found the ocean frozen. He worked his way west for several hundred miles and gave up on at Return Reef when he was about east of Beechey&#x27;s Point Barrow.

Reaching safety at Fort Franklin on , he left on and spent the rest of the winter and spring at Fort Chipewyan. He reached Liverpool on the first of September 1827. Richardson&#x27;s eastward journey was more successful. Franklin&#x27;s diary from this expedition describes his men playing hockey on the ice of the Great Bear Lake; Délı̨nę, built on the site of Fort Franklin, thus considers itself to be one of the birthplaces of the sport.

On , he married Jane Griffin, a friend of his first wife and a seasoned traveller who proved indomitable in the course of their life together. On , he was knighted by George IV and the same year awarded the first Gold Medal of the Société de Géographie of France. On , he was made Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order and a Knight of the Greek Order of the Redeemer.

=== 1837: Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land ===
Franklin was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in 1837 but was removed from office in 1843. He is remembered by a significant landmark in the centre of Hobart—a statue of him dominates the park known as Franklin Square, which was the site of the original Government House. On the plinth below the statue appears Tennyson&#x27;s epitaph:

His wife worked to set up a university, which was eventually established in 1890, and a museum, credited to the Royal Society of Tasmania in 1843 under the leadership of her husband. Lady Franklin may have worked to have the Lieutenant-Governor&#x27;s private botanical gardens, established in 1818, managed as a public resource. Lady Franklin also established a glyptotheque and surrounding lands to support it near Hobart. Sir John and Lady Jane Franklin adopted the daughter of the chief of an indigenous Australian tribe. She was renamed Mathinna and was raised with their own daughter Eleanor, but she was abandoned in Tasmania when the Franklins returned to England in 1843.

The village of Franklin, on the Huon River, is named in his honour, as is the Franklin River on the West Coast of Tasmania, one of the better known Tasmanian rivers due to the Franklin Dam controversy.

Shortly after leaving his post as Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, Franklin revisited a cairn on Arthurs Seat, a small mountain just inside Port Phillip Bay in Victoria, Australia, that he had visited as a midshipman with Captain Matthew Flinders in April 1802. On this trip he was accompanied by Captain Reid of The Briars and Andrew Murison McCrae of Arthurs Seat Station, now known as McCrae Homestead.

=== 1845: Northwest Passage expedition ===

Exploration of the Arctic coastal mainland after Franklin&#x27;s second Arctic expedition had left less than of unexplored Arctic coastline. The British decided to send a well-equipped Arctic expedition to complete the charting of the Northwest Passage. After Sir James Clark Ross declined an offer to command the expedition, an invitation was extended to Franklin, who, despite being 59 years old, accepted what was to become Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition.

A younger man, Commander James Fitzjames, was given command of , and Franklin was named the expedition commander. Captain Francis Crozier, who had commanded during the Ross expedition of 1841–1844 to the Antarctic, was appointed executive officer and commander of &quot;Terror&quot;. Franklin was given command on , and received official instructions on .
 The crew was chosen by the Admiralty. Most of them were Englishmen, many were from northern England, and a small number were Irishmen and Scotsmen. 

&quot;Erebus&quot; and &quot;Terror&quot; were sturdily built and were outfitted with recent inventions. These included steam engines from the London and Greenwich Railway that enabled the ships to make on their own power, a unique combined steam-based heating and distillation system for the comfort of the crew and to provide large quantities of fresh water for the engine&#x27;s boilers, a mechanism that enabled the iron rudder and propeller to be drawn into iron wells to protect them from damage, ships&#x27; libraries of more than 1,000 books, and three years&#x27; worth of conventionally preserved or tinned preserved food supplies. The tinned preserved food was supplied by a cut-rate provisioner who was awarded the contract a few months before the ships were to sail.

Though the provisioner&#x27;s &quot;patent process&quot; was sound, the haste with which he had prepared thousands of cans of food led to sloppily-applied beads of solder on the cans&#x27; interior edges, allowing lead to leach into the food. Additionally, the water distillation system may have used lead piping and lead-soldered joints, which would have produced drinking water with a high lead content.

The Franklin Expedition set sail from Greenhithe, England, on , with a crew of 24 officers and 110 men. The ships travelled north to Aberdeen and the Orkney Isles for supplies. From Scotland, the ships sailed to Greenland with and a transport ship, &quot;Barretto Junior&quot;. After misjudging the location of Whitefish Bay on Disko Island, the expedition backtracked and finally harboured in that far north outpost to prepare for the rest of their voyage. Five crew members were discharged and sent home on the &quot;Rattler&quot; and &quot;Barretto Junior&quot;, reducing the ships&#x27; final crew size to 129. The expedition was last seen by Europeans on , when Captain Dannett of the whaler encountered &quot;Terror&quot; and &quot;Erebus&quot; moored to an iceberg in Lancaster Sound.

It is now believed that the expedition wintered on Beechey Island in 1845–46. &quot;Terror&quot; and &quot;Erebus&quot; became trapped in ice off King William Island in September 1846. According to a note later found on that island, Franklin died there on , but the exact location of his grave is unknown.
After two years and no word from the expedition, Lady Franklin urged the Admiralty to send a search party. Because the crew carried supplies for three years, the Admiralty waited another year before launching a search and offering a £20,000 reward () for finding the expedition. The money and Franklin&#x27;s fame led to many searches.

At one point, ten British and two American ships, and , headed for the Arctic. Eventually, more ships and men were lost looking for Franklin than in the expedition itself. Ballads such as &quot;Lady Franklin&#x27;s Lament&quot;, commemorating Lady Franklin&#x27;s search for her lost husband, became popular.

In the summer of 1850, several expeditions, including three from England as well as one from the United States, joined in the search. They converged off the east coast of Beechey Island, where the first relics of the Franklin expedition were found, including the gravesites of three of Franklin&#x27;s crewmen. Many presumed Franklin was still alive, and he was promoted to Rear-Admiral of the Blue in October 1852, an example of an unintentional posthumous promotion.

In 1854, the Scottish explorer John Rae, while surveying the Boothia Peninsula for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, discovered the true fate of the Franklin party from talking to Inuit hunters. He was told both ships had become icebound, and the men had tried to reach safety on foot but had succumbed to cold, and some had resorted to cannibalism. Forensic evidence of cut marks on the skeletal remains of crew members found on King William Island during the late 20th century somewhat supported the Inuit accounts of reported cannibalism.

Rae&#x27;s report to the Admiralty was leaked to the press, which led to widespread revulsion in Victorian society, enraged Franklin&#x27;s widow, and condemned Rae to ignominy. Lady Franklin&#x27;s efforts to eulogise her husband, with support from the British Establishment, led to a further 25 searches over the next four decades, none of which would add much further information of note regarding Franklin and his men, but contributed hugely to the mapping of the Arctic.

In the mid-1980s, Owen Beattie, a University of Alberta professor of anthropology, began a 10-year series of scientific studies that showed that the Beechey Island crew had most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis. Toxicological reports indicated that lead poisoning was also a possible factor.

In 1997, more than 140 years after his report, Dr. Rae&#x27;s account was finally vindicated; cut marks caused by blades were discovered on the bones of some of the crew found on King William Island, strongly suggesting that conditions had become so dire that some crew members resorted to cannibalism. Evidence suggestive of breakage and boiling of bones, characteristic of efforts to extract marrow, was subsequently identified. It appeared from these studies that a combination of bad weather, years locked in ice, poisoned food, botulism, starvation, and disease, including scurvy, had killed everyone in the Franklin party. In October 2009, marine archaeologist Robert Grenier outlined recent discoveries of sheet metal and copper which have been recovered from 19th-century Inuit hunting sites. Grenier firmly believes these pieces of metal once belonged to the &quot;Terror&quot; and formed the protective plating of the ship&#x27;s hull.

A quote from the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; states:
== Legacy ==

A memorial to Franklin was set up almost immediately on the assumption of his death. This is in Westminster Abbey to a design of Matthew Noble.

For years after the loss of the Franklin party, the media of the Victorian era portrayed Franklin as a hero who led his men in the quest for the Northwest Passage. A statue of Franklin in his home town bears the inscription: &quot;Discoverer of the North West Passage&quot;. Statues of Franklin outside the Athenaeum Club in London and in Tasmania bear similar inscriptions. There is also a memorial to him in the Chapel of St Michael at Westminster Abbey.

Many geographic locales are named after Franklin, among them Franklin Island in Antarctica, Franklin Island in Greenland, Franklin Strait in northern Canada, Franklin, Quebec, Franklin Sound north of Tasmania, and the Franklin River and the town of Franklin in Tasmania, as well as many streets and schools, including Sir John Franklin School, Calgary, AB. The Australian oceanographic research vessel and the Canadian Coast Guard vessel both bear his name. The wintering site of Franklin&#x27;s second Canadian expedition, in Délı̨nę, Northwest Territories, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1996. The explorer was also memorialised when one of Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories subdivisions was named the District of Franklin. Franklin&#x27;s gull (Leucophaeus pipixcan) of North America was also named after him.

In 2009, a special service of Thanksgiving was held in the chapel at the Royal Naval College to accompany the rededication of the national monument to Sir John Franklin. It was a celebration of the contributions made by the United Kingdom in the charting of northern Canada, and honoured the loss of life in the pursuit of geographical discovery. The service also marked the 150th anniversary of Francis McClintock&#x27;s voyage aboard the yacht &quot;Fox&quot;, and that expedition&#x27;s return to London with news of the tragedy.

Franklin&#x27;s time in Tasmania was dramatised in the play &quot;Jane, My Love&quot; and its radio adaptation &quot;The Franklins of Hobart Town&quot;.
=== Rediscovery ===

In September 2014, the wreck of was rediscovered in Wilmot and Crampton Bay near the Adelaide Peninsula, and, in September 2016, the wreck of was discovered, in Terror Bay on the south coast of King William Island, in &quot;pristine&quot; condition. The wrecks were found many miles south of their last known location off the northwest coast of King William Island; archaeologists believe the &quot;Terror&quot; must have been crewed and sailed to its new location, as the anchor was used and it was sailed through a maze of islands and channels. The wrecks are designated as the Wrecks of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror National Historic Site, with the precise locations of the discoveries undisclosed.

<doc id="330310" wikidata="Q303402" url="?curid=330310" title="Rank–nullity theorem">
<text>The rank–nullity theorem is a theorem in linear algebra, which asserts:
* the number of columns of a matrix is the sum of the rank of and the nullity of ; and
* the dimension of the domain of a linear transformation is the sum of the rank of (the dimension of the image of ) and the nullity of (the dimension of the kernel of ).
It follows that for linear transformations of vector spaces of equal finite dimension, either injectivity or surjectivity implies bijectivity.

==Stating the theorem==

===Linear transformations===

Let formula_1 be a linear transformation between two vector spaces where formula_2&#x27;s domain formula_3 is finite dimensional. Then
formula_4
where formula_5 is the rank of formula_2 (the dimension of its image) and formula_7 is the nullity of formula_2 (the dimension of its kernel). In other words,
formula_9
This theorem can be refined via the splitting lemma to be a statement about an isomorphism of spaces, not just dimensions. Explicitly, since formula_10 induces an isomorphism from formula_11 to formula_12 the existence of a basis for formula_13 that extends any given basis of formula_14 implies, via the splitting lemma, that formula_15 Taking dimensions, the rank–nullity theorem follows.

=== Matrices ===
Linear maps can be represented with matrices. More precisely, an formula_16 matrix represents a linear map formula_17 where formula_18 is the underlying field. So, the dimension of the domain of formula_19 is , the number of columns of , and the rank–nullity theorem for an formula_16 matrix is
formula_21

== Proofs ==
Here we provide two proofs. The first operates in the general case, using linear maps. The second proof looks at the homogeneous system formula_22 where formula_23 is a formula_16 with rank formula_25 and shows explicitly that there exists a set of formula_26 linearly independent solutions that span the null space of formula_27.

While the theorem requires that the domain of the linear map be finite-dimensional, there is no such assumption on the codomain. This means that there are linear maps not given by matrices for which the theorem applies. Despite this, the first proof is not actually more general than the second: since the image of the linear map is finite-dimensional, we can represent the map from its domain to its image by a matrix, prove the theorem for that matrix, then compose with the inclusion of the image into the full codomain.

===First proof===
Let formula_28 be vector spaces over some field formula_29 and formula_2 defined as in the statement of the theorem with formula_31.

As formula_32 is a subspace, there exists a basis for it. Suppose formula_33 and let
formula_34
be such a basis.

We may now, by the Steinitz exchange lemma, extend formula_35 with formula_36 linearly independent vectors formula_37 to form a full basis of formula_3.

Let
formula_39
such that
formula_40
is a basis for formula_3.
From this, we know that
formula_42
::formula_43
We now claim that formula_44 is a basis for formula_45.
The above equality already states that formula_44 is a generating set for formula_45; it remains to be shown that it is also linearly independent to conclude that it is a basis.

Suppose formula_44 is not linearly independent, and let
formula_49
for some formula_50.

Thus, owing to the linearity of formula_2, it follows that
formula_52
This is a contradiction to formula_53 being a basis, unless all formula_54 are equal to zero. This shows that formula_44 is linearly independent, and more specifically that it is a basis for formula_56.

To summarize, we have formula_35, a basis for formula_58, and formula_44, a basis for formula_56.

Finally we may state that
formula_61
::formula_62
This concludes our proof.

===Second proof===

Let formula_27 be an formula_16 matrix with formula_65 linearly independent columns (i.e. formula_66). We will show that:
To do this, we will produce an formula_67 matrix formula_68 whose columns form a basis of the null space of formula_27.

Without loss of generality, assume that the first formula_65 columns of formula_27 are linearly independent. So, we can write
formula_72
where
*formula_73 is an formula_74 matrix with formula_65 linearly independent column vectors, and
*formula_76 is an formula_77 matrix such that each of its formula_26 columns is linear combinations of the columns of formula_73.

This means that formula_80 for some formula_81 matrix formula_82 (see rank factorization) and, hence,
formula_83

Let
formula_84
where formula_85 is the formula_86 identity matrix. So, formula_68 is an formula_67 matrix such that
formula_89

Therefore, each of the formula_26 columns of formula_68 are particular solutions of formula_92.

Furthermore, the formula_26 columns of formula_68 are linearly independent because formula_95 will imply formula_96 for formula_97:
formula_98
Therefore, the column vectors of formula_68 constitute a set of formula_26 linearly independent solutions for formula_101.

We next prove that &quot;any&quot; solution of formula_102 must be a linear combination of the columns of formula_68.

For this, let
formula_104

be any vector such that formula_105. Since the columns of formula_73 are linearly independent, formula_107 implies formula_108.

Therefore,
formula_109
formula_110

This proves that any vector formula_111 that is a solution of formula_112 must be a linear combination of the formula_26 special solutions given by the columns of formula_68. And we have already seen that the columns of formula_68 are linearly independent. Hence, the columns of formula_68 constitute a basis for the null space of formula_27. Therefore, the nullity of formula_27 is formula_119. Since formula_65 equals rank of formula_27, it follows that formula_122. This concludes our proof.

== A third fundamental subspace ==

When formula_123 is a linear transformation between two finite-dimensional subspaces, with formula_124 and formula_125 (so can be represented by an formula_126 matrix formula_127), the rank–nullity theorem asserts that if formula_2 has rank formula_65, then formula_119 is the dimension of the null space of formula_127, which represents the kernel of formula_2. In some texts, a third fundamental subspace associated to formula_2 is considered alongside its image and kernel: the cokernel of formula_2 is the quotient space formula_135, and its dimension is formula_136. This dimension formula (which might also be rendered formula_137) together with the rank–nullity theorem is sometimes called the &quot;fundamental theorem of linear algebra&quot;.

== Reformulations and generalizations ==
This theorem is a statement of the first isomorphism theorem of algebra for the case of vector spaces; it generalizes to the splitting lemma.

In more modern language, the theorem can also be phrased as saying that each short exact sequence of vector spaces splits. Explicitly, given that
formula_138
is a short exact sequence of vector spaces, then formula_139, hence
formula_140
Here formula_141 plays the role of formula_45 and formula_143 is formula_58, i.e.
formula_145

In the finite-dimensional case, this formulation is susceptible to a generalization: if
formula_146
is an exact sequence of finite-dimensional vector spaces, then
formula_147
The rank–nullity theorem for finite-dimensional vector spaces may also be formulated in terms of the &quot;index&quot; of a linear map. The index of a linear map formula_148, where formula_3 and formula_150 are finite-dimensional, is defined by
formula_151

Intuitively, formula_152 is the number of independent solutions formula_153 of the equation formula_154, and formula_155 is the number of independent restrictions that have to be put on formula_156 to make formula_157 solvable. The rank–nullity theorem for finite-dimensional vector spaces is equivalent to the statement
formula_158

We see that we can easily read off the index of the linear map formula_2 from the involved spaces, without any need to analyze formula_2 in detail. This effect also occurs in a much deeper result: the Atiyah–Singer index theorem states that the index of certain differential operators can be read off the geometry of the involved spaces.

<text>The Welsh Government () is the executive arm of the devolved government of Wales. The government consists of cabinet secretaries and ministers. It is led by the first minister, usually the leader of the largest party in the Senedd (Welsh Parliament; ), who selects ministers with the approval of the Senedd. The government is responsible for tabling policy in devolved areas (such as health, education, economic development, transport and local government) for consideration by the Senedd and implementing policy that has been approved by it.

The current Welsh Government is a Labour minority administration, following the 2021 Senedd election. It is led by Eluned Morgan who has been the first minister of Wales since August 2024.

== History ==
===The Welsh Office===
Prior to devolution in 1999 many executive functions for Wales were carried out by the Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Office. The Welsh Office was a department in the Government of the United Kingdom with responsibilities for Wales. It was established in April 1965 to execute government policy in Wales, and was headed by the Secretary of State for Wales, a post which had been created in October 1964. The post however had no Welsh electoral mandate, and over the ensuing years there were complaints of a &quot;democratic deficit&quot;. For eleven years prior to 1997 Wales had been represented in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom by a Secretary of State who did not represent a Welsh constituency at Westminster. These factors led to growing calls for political devolution. The Welsh Office was disbanded on 1 July 1999 when most of its powers were transferred to the National Assembly for Wales.

=== Executive Committee of the National Assembly for Wales 1999 to 2007 ===

The National Assembly was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998, which followed a referendum in 1997. As initially established, the Welsh Government had no independent executive powers in law (unlike, for instance, the Scottish ministers and British government ministers). The National Assembly was established as a &quot;body corporate&quot; by the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the executive, as a committee of the assembly, only had those powers that the assembly as a whole voted to delegate to ministers. 

On 27 November 2001, First Minister Rhodri Morgan announced that the brand &quot;Welsh Assembly Government&quot; would be used going forward for the committee, to more clearly delineate the division of functions within the Assembly. 

The Government of Wales Act 2006 formally separated the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government, giving Welsh ministers independent executive authority, this taking effect following the May 2007 elections. Following separation, the Welsh ministers exercise functions in their own right. Further transfers of executive functions from the British government can be made directly to the Welsh ministers (with their consent) by an Order in Council approved by the British parliament.

Separation was designed to clarify the respective roles of the assembly and the government. Under the structures established by the Government of Wales Act 2006, the role of Welsh ministers is to make decisions; develop and implement policy; exercise executive functions and make statutory instruments. The remainder of the 60 assembly members in the National Assembly scrutinise the government&#x27;s decisions and policies; hold ministers to account; approve budgets for the Welsh Government&#x27;s programmes; and enact acts of assembly on subjects that have been devolved to the Welsh administration.

The result mirrored much more closely the relationship between the British government and British parliament and that between the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament.

=== After the 2007 election of the National Assembly for Wales ===

==== Legal separation ====

The new arrangements provided for in the Government of Wales Act 2006 created a formal legal separation between the National Assembly for Wales, comprising 60 assembly members, and the Welsh Assembly Government, comprising the first minister, Welsh ministers, deputy ministers and the counsel general. This separation between the two bodies took effect on the appointment of the first minister by Queen Elizabeth II following the assembly election on 3 May 2007.

Separation was meant to clarify the respective roles of the assembly and the government. The role of the government is to make decisions; develop and implement policy; exercise executive functions and make statutory instruments. The 60 assembly members in the National Assembly scrutinise the Welsh Government&#x27;s decisions and policies; hold ministers to account; approve budgets for the Welsh Government&#x27;s programmes; and have the power to enact assembly measures on certain matters. Assembly measures can now go further than the subordinate legislation which the assembly had the power to make prior to 2007.

==== Transfer of functions ====

The assembly&#x27;s functions, including that of making subordinate legislation, in the main, transferred to the Welsh ministers upon separation. A third body was also established under the 2006 Act from May 2007, called the National Assembly for Wales Commission. It employs the staff supporting the new National Assembly for Wales, and holds property, enters into contracts and provides support services on its behalf.

==== Welsh ministers ====

The 2006 Act made new provision for the appointment of Welsh ministers. The first minister is nominated by the Senedd and then appointed by His Majesty the King. The first minister then appoints the Welsh ministers and the deputy Welsh ministers with the approval of the monarch. The Act created a new post of Counsel General for Wales, the principal source of legal advice to the Welsh Government. The counsel general is appointed by the monarch, on the nomination of the first minister, whose recommendation must be agreed by the Senedd and who cannot be dismissed without the Senedd&#x27;s consent, but automatically leaves office when a new first minister is nominated. The counsel general may be, but does not have to be, a member of the Senedd. The Act permits a maximum of 12 Welsh ministers, which includes deputy Welsh ministers, but excludes the first minister and the counsel general. Accordingly, the maximum size of the Welsh Government is 14.

In Acts of the Senedd and of the UK Parliament, the expression &quot;the Welsh Ministers&quot; is used to refer to the Welsh government in similar contexts to those where &quot;the Secretary of State&quot; would be used to refer to the British government; it is defined to include only the first minister and ministers, not the deputy ministers or the counsel general.

=== 2011 referendum on law-making powers ===

==== Functions and areas of competence ====

Following the &quot;yes&quot; vote in the referendum on further law-making powers for the assembly on 3 March 2011, the Welsh Government is now entitled to propose bills to the National Assembly for Wales on subjects within 20 fields of policy. Subject to limitations prescribed by the Government of Wales Act 2006, Acts of the National Assembly may make any provision that could be made by Act of Parliament. The 20 areas of responsibility devolved to the National Assembly for Wales (and within which Welsh ministers exercise executive functions) are:

*Agriculture, fisheries, forestry and rural development
*Ancient monuments and historical buildings
*Culture
*Economic development
*Education and training
*Environment
*Fire and rescue services and promotion of fire safety
*Food
*Health and social services
*Highways and transport
*Housing
*Local government
*National Assembly for Wales
*Public administration
*Social welfare
*Sport and recreation
*Tourism
*Town and country planning
*Water and flood defences
*Welsh language

=== Renaming ===
The Welsh Assembly Government was renamed Welsh Government (&quot;&quot;) in practice in 2011, and in law by the Wales Act 2014.

== Cabinet secretaries and ministers ==
The government is composed of cabinet secretaries and ministers. The current government is a minority by Welsh Labour.

The current cabinet was formed on 11 September 2024, replacing the interim cabinet formed by Morgan when she was appointed First Minister in August 2024, which was largely a continuation of Gething&#x27;s. In the September reshuffle, new positions were created, while all existing ministers remained in cabinet (except the Counsel General-designate) but most with amended roles. The September 2024 cabinet is as follows:

Cabinet secretaries and ministers were known as ministers and deputy ministers respectively before 2016, and under Mark Drakeford from 2018 to 2024. They returned to their current names in May 2024 following the appointment of Vaughan Gething.

== Civil service ==
The Welsh Government also includes a civil service that supports the Welsh ministers. As of March 2018, there are 5,015 full-time equivalent civil servants working across Wales. The civil service is a matter reserved to the British Parliament at Westminster: Welsh Government civil servants work within the rules and customs of His Majesty&#x27;s Civil Service, but serve the devolved administration rather than the British Government.

=== Permanent secretary ===
The Permanent secretary heads the civil service of the Welsh Government and chairs the Strategic Delivery and Performance Board.

The Permanent Secretary is a member of His Majesty&#x27;s Civil Service, and therefore takes part in the Permanent Secretaries Management Group of the Civil Service and is answerable to the most senior civil servant in Britain, the Cabinet Secretary, for professional conduct. The permanent secretary remains, however, at the direction of the Welsh ministers.

=== The Board ===

The Welsh Government Board translates the strategic direction set by the Welsh cabinet and its committees into work that is joined up across Welsh Government departments and makes the best use of its resources. The board is made up of six directors general, six directors and four non-executive directors, and is chaired by the permanent secretary.

Board members are appointed at the discretion of and by the permanent secretary. Membership is not wholly dependent on functional responsibilities; it is designed to provide balanced advice and support to the permanent secretary, and collective leadership to the organisation as a whole.
=== Welsh Government sponsored bodies ===
The Welsh Government is responsible for a number of Welsh Government sponsored bodies (WGSBs). These are, respectively,

*executive WGSBs, which are non-departmental public bodies such as the Arts Council of Wales;
*advisory WGSBs, which are non-departmental public bodies; and
*tribunals such as the Mental Health Review Tribunal for Wales.

WGSBs are staffed by public servants rather than civil servants.

The Welsh Government is also responsible for some public bodies that are not classed as WGSBs, such as NHS Wales, and the Welsh Offices of England and Wales legal offices.

== Estate ==
The Welsh Government has a total of 18 core and operational offices across Wales. It also has an office based in Westminster. Additionally, it has 7 specialist properties across Wales, which include stores, traffic management centres and the pavilion at the Royal Welsh Showground.

The Government also has 21 offices located in 11 countries outside the United Kingdom: Belgium; Canada; China; France; Germany; Ireland; India; Japan; Qatar; United Arab Emirates, and the United States of America.

Historically, most Welsh Office staff were based in Cardiff, especially in Cathays Park. However, in 2002, the Fullerton Review concluded that &quot;the Assembly could no longer sustain having the majority of its operational functions located in and around Cardiff&quot;. Since 2004, Welsh Government civil servants have been relocated across Wales as part of the Location Strategy, which involved the creation of new offices at Merthyr Tydfil, Aberystwyth and Llandudno Junction. In 2006, the mergers of Education and Learning Wales, the Wales Tourist Board and the Welsh Development Agency into the Welsh Government brought these agencies&#x27; offices into the Welsh Government estate.

The office of the First Minister is in Tŷ Hywel in Cardiff Bay; an office is also kept at the Welsh Government building in Cathays Park where the majority of Cardiff-based Welsh Government civil servants are located.

== Budget ==

Wales receives a budget allocation from the UK Government determined by the Barnett formula, which makes up roughly 80% of the Welsh budget. The remaining 20% comes from devolved taxes such as non-domestic rates, land transaction tax, landfill disposal tax and the Welsh rates of income tax. These taxes are collected and managed by the Welsh Revenue Authority, except for income tax which is collected by His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs on behalf of the Welsh Government.

The Welsh Government sets out its spending and financing plans for the forthcoming financial year in the autumn.

The Senedd scrutinises the budget and associated taxation and spending plans.

<doc id="330320" wikidata="Q574576" url="?curid=330320" title="Exponential decay">
<text>A quantity is subject to exponential decay if it decreases at a rate proportional to its current value. Symbolically, this process can be expressed by the following differential equation, where is the quantity and (lambda) is a positive rate called the exponential decay constant, disintegration constant, rate constant, or transformation constant:

:formula_1

The solution to this equation (see derivation below) is:

:formula_2

where is the quantity at time , is the initial quantity, that is, the quantity at time .

== Measuring rates of decay ==

=== Mean lifetime ===
If the decaying quantity, &quot;N&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), is the number of discrete elements in a certain set, it is possible to compute the average length of time that an element remains in the set. This is called the mean lifetime (or simply the lifetime), where the exponential time constant, formula_3, relates to the decay rate constant, λ, in the following way:
:formula_4

The mean lifetime can be looked at as a &quot;scaling time&quot;, because the exponential decay equation can be written in terms of the mean lifetime, formula_3, instead of the decay constant, λ:
:formula_6
and that formula_3 is the time at which the population of the assembly is reduced to ≈ 0.367879441 times its initial value. This is equivalent to formula_8 ≈ 1.442695 half-lives.

For example, if the initial population of the assembly, &quot;N&quot;(0), is 1000, then the population at time formula_3, formula_10, is 368.

A very similar equation will be seen below, which arises when the base of the exponential is chosen to be 2, rather than &quot;e&quot;. In that case the scaling time is the &quot;half-life&quot;.

===Half-life===
A more intuitive characteristic of exponential decay for many people is the time required for the decaying quantity to fall to one half of its initial value. (If &quot;N&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is discrete, then this is the median life-time rather than the mean life-time.) This time is called the &quot;half-life&quot;, and often denoted by the symbol &quot;t&quot;1/2. The half-life can be written in terms of the decay constant, or the mean lifetime, as:

:formula_11

When this expression is inserted for formula_3 in the exponential equation above, and ln 2 is absorbed into the base, this equation becomes:

:formula_13

Thus, the amount of material left is 2−1 = 1/2 raised to the (whole or fractional) number of half-lives that have passed. Thus, after 3 half-lives there will be 1/23 = 1/8 of the original material left.

Therefore, the mean lifetime formula_3 is equal to the half-life divided by the natural log of 2, or:

: formula_15

For example, polonium-210 has a half-life of 138 days, and a mean lifetime of 200 days.

== Solution of the differential equation ==

The equation that describes exponential decay is
:formula_16
or, by rearranging (applying the technique called separation of variables),
:formula_17

Integrating, we have
:formula_18
where C is the constant of integration, and hence
:formula_19
where the final substitution, &quot;N&quot;0 = &quot;e&quot;&quot;C&quot;, is obtained by evaluating the equation at &quot;t&quot; = 0, as &quot;N&quot;0 is defined as being the quantity at &quot;t&quot; = 0.

This is the form of the equation that is most commonly used to describe exponential decay. Any one of decay constant, mean lifetime, or half-life is sufficient to characterise the decay. The notation λ for the decay constant is a remnant of the usual notation for an eigenvalue. In this case, λ is the eigenvalue of the negative of the differential operator with &quot;N&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) as the corresponding eigenfunction. The units of the decay constant are s−1.

=== Derivation of the mean lifetime ===
Given an assembly of elements, the number of which decreases ultimately to zero, the mean lifetime, formula_3, (also called simply the lifetime) is the expected value of the amount of time before an object is removed from the assembly. Specifically, if the &quot;individual lifetime&quot; of an element of the assembly is the time elapsed between some reference time and the removal of that element from the assembly, the mean lifetime is the arithmetic mean of the individual lifetimes.

Starting from the population formula

:formula_21

first let &quot;c&quot; be the normalizing factor to convert to a probability density function:

:formula_22

or, on rearranging,

:formula_23

Exponential decay is a scalar multiple of the exponential distribution (i.e. the individual lifetime of each object is exponentially distributed), which has a well-known expected value. We can compute it here using integration by parts.

:formula_24

=== Decay by two or more processes ===

A quantity may decay via two or more different processes simultaneously. In general, these processes (often called &quot;decay modes&quot;, &quot;decay channels&quot;, &quot;decay routes&quot; etc.) have different probabilities of occurring, and thus occur at different rates with different half-lives, in parallel. The total decay rate of the quantity &quot;N&quot; is given by the &quot;sum&quot; of the decay routes; thus, in the case of two processes:

:formula_25

The solution to this equation is given in the previous section, where the sum of formula_26 is treated as a new total decay constant formula_27.

:formula_28

Partial mean life associated with individual processes is by definition the multiplicative inverse of corresponding partial decay constant: formula_29. A combined formula_30 can be given in terms of formula_31s:

:formula_32

:formula_33

Since half-lives differ from mean life formula_3 by a constant factor, the same equation holds in terms of the two corresponding half-lives:

:formula_35

where formula_36 is the combined or total half-life for the process, formula_37 and formula_38 are so-named partial half-lives of corresponding processes. Terms &quot;partial half-life&quot; and &quot;partial mean life&quot; denote quantities derived from a decay constant as if the given decay mode were the only decay mode for the quantity. The term &quot;partial half-life&quot; is misleading, because it cannot be measured as a time interval for which a certain quantity is halved.

In terms of separate decay constants, the total half-life formula_36 can be shown to be

:formula_40

For a decay by three simultaneous exponential processes the total half-life can be computed as above:

:formula_41

=== Decay series / coupled decay ===

In nuclear science and pharmacokinetics, the agent of interest might be situated in a decay chain, where the accumulation is governed by exponential decay of a source agent, while the agent of interest itself decays by means of an exponential process. 

These systems are solved using the Bateman equation. 

In the pharmacology setting, some ingested substances might be absorbed into the body by a process reasonably modeled as exponential decay, or might be deliberately formulated to have such a release profile. 

== Applications and examples ==

Exponential decay occurs in a wide variety of situations. Most of these fall into the domain of the natural sciences.

Many decay processes that are often treated as exponential, are really only exponential so long as the sample is large and the law of large numbers holds. For small samples, a more general analysis is necessary, accounting for a Poisson process.

=== Natural sciences ===
* Chemical reactions: The rates of certain types of chemical reactions depend on the concentration of one or another reactant. Reactions whose rate depends only on the concentration of one reactant (known as first-order reactions) consequently follow exponential decay. For instance, many enzyme-catalyzed reactions behave this way.
* Electrostatics: The electric charge (or, equivalently, the potential) contained in a capacitor (capacitance &quot;C&quot;) discharges with exponential decay (when the capacitor experiences a constant external load of resistance &quot;R&quot;) and similarly charges with the mirror image of exponential decay (when the capacitor is charged from a constant voltage source though a constant resistance). The exponential time-constant for the process is formula_42 so the half-life is formula_43 The same equations can be applied to the dual of current in an inductor.
** Furthermore, the particular case of a capacitor or inductor changing through several parallel resistors makes an interesting example of multiple decay processes, with each resistor representing a separate process. In fact, the expression for the equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel mirrors the equation for the half-life with two decay processes.
* Geophysics: Atmospheric pressure decreases approximately exponentially with increasing height above sea level, at a rate of about 12% per 1000m.
* Heat transfer: If an object at one temperature is exposed to a medium of another temperature, the temperature difference between the object and the medium follows exponential decay (in the limit of slow processes; equivalent to &quot;good&quot; heat conduction inside the object, so that its temperature remains relatively uniform through its volume). See also Newton&#x27;s law of cooling.
* Luminescence: After excitation, the emission intensity – which is proportional to the number of excited atoms or molecules – of a luminescent material decays exponentially. Depending on the number of mechanisms involved, the decay can be mono- or multi-exponential.
* Pharmacology and toxicology: It is found that many administered substances are distributed and metabolized (see &quot;clearance&quot;) according to exponential decay patterns. The biological half-lives &quot;alpha half-life&quot; and &quot;beta half-life&quot; of a substance measure how quickly a substance is distributed and eliminated.
* Physical optics: The intensity of electromagnetic radiation such as light or X-rays or gamma rays in an absorbent medium, follows an exponential decrease with distance into the absorbing medium. This is known as the Beer-Lambert law.
* Radioactivity: In a sample of a radionuclide that undergoes radioactive decay to a different state, the number of atoms in the original state follows exponential decay as long as the remaining number of atoms is large. The decay product is termed a radiogenic nuclide.
* Thermoelectricity: The decline in resistance of a Negative Temperature Coefficient Thermistor as temperature is increased.
* Vibrations: Some vibrations may decay exponentially; this characteristic is often found in damped mechanical oscillators, and used in creating ADSR envelopes in synthesizers. An overdamped system will simply return to equilibrium via an exponential decay.
* Beer froth: Arnd Leike, of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, won an Ig Nobel Prize for demonstrating that beer froth obeys the law of exponential decay.

=== Social sciences ===
* Finance: a retirement fund will decay exponentially being subject to discrete payout amounts, usually monthly, and an input subject to a continuous interest rate. A differential equation dA/dt = input – output can be written and solved to find the time to reach any amount A, remaining in the fund.
* In simple glottochronology, the (debatable) assumption of a constant decay rate in languages allows one to estimate the age of single languages. (To compute the time of split between &quot;two&quot; languages requires additional assumptions, independent of exponential decay).

=== Computer science ===

* The core routing protocol on the Internet, BGP, has to maintain a routing table in order to remember the paths a packet can be deviated to. When one of these paths repeatedly changes its state from &quot;available&quot; to &quot;not available&quot; (and &quot;vice versa&quot;), the BGP router controlling that path has to repeatedly add and remove the path record from its routing table (&quot;flaps&quot; the path), thus spending local resources such as CPU and RAM and, even more, broadcasting useless information to peer routers. To prevent this undesired behavior, an algorithm named &quot;route flapping damping&quot; assigns each route a weight that gets bigger each time the route changes its state and decays exponentially with time. When the weight reaches a certain limit, no more flapping is done, thus suppressing the route.

<doc id="330321" wikidata="Q1470005" url="?curid=330321" title="Front Mission">
<text>is a collection of video games and related media produced by Square, now Square Enix. The series was created by Toshiro Tsuchida and developed by G-Craft, a studio that was later absorbed by Square and existed within Square Enix as Product Development Division-6. Since the release of the original &quot;Front Mission&quot; in 1995, the series has gone on to encompass several media, including film, manga, novels, radio dramas, mobile phone applications, and toys. While the series is primarily rooted in the turn-based tactical role-playing genre, it has also ventured into other genres such as side-scrolling shooter, real-time strategy (RTS), massive multiplayer online (MMO), and third-person shooter through its spin-offs. The &quot;Front Mission&quot; video games achieved moderate success, selling over 3 million units worldwide up until January 2006.

The main selling point of &quot;Front Mission&quot; is its storytelling approach. Taking place during the 21st and 22nd centuries, the series revolves around military conflicts and political tension between powerful supranational unions and their member states. Although the &quot;Front Mission&quot; video games use self-contained, standalone stories, these tie into a greater overarching storyline that encompasses the entire series. In combination with the stories from its other media, the series possesses a level of storytelling depth and continuity comparable to a serial drama. Another major draw of &quot;Front Mission&quot; is its use of giant mecha called &quot;wanzers&quot; (from the fictional German word &quot;Wanderpanzer&quot;, or walking tanks) in battle.

==Development==
Development of the first &quot;Front Mission&quot; started with discussions between software developers Square and G-Craft. Square had never had another developer make a game for them and planning proceeded slowly, but an agreement between the two was finished in the Fall of 1993. Game producer and writer Toshiro Tsuchida presented a proposal for a game called “100 Mission” to Square through his own development company, Solid, on G-Crafts behalf. When Square producer Shinji Hashimoto first saw the first version of the game proposal, he thought it was “too radical” and usually such proposals would not be approved. Square was not enthusiastic, repeatedly telling Tsuchida “no robots”, and being told by Square that game development couldn&#x27;t just be driven by a creators passion anymore. Tsuchida also had difficulty explaining how much of a role robots would have in the proposed game, and so he obtained some development hardware to create a prototype of the title. Square was the only publisher at the time willing to consider Tsuchidas’ proposal. They finally agreed to make the game because they thought working in a new genre would be stimulating and it was a title they probably could not do themselves as to that point Square had mostly made fantasy games.

There are two types of &quot;Front Mission&quot; installments: the numbered entries and the non-numbered entries. The numbered &quot;Front Mission&quot; titles are all structured as tactical role-playing games. All other &quot;Front Mission&quot; titles that do not have a number assigned to it are genre spin-offs. Each of the five spin-off entries are classified under different genres. &quot;Front Mission: Gun Hazard&quot; is a side-scrolling shooter video game. &quot;Front Mission Alternative&quot; is a real-time strategy video game. &quot;Front Mission: Online&quot; is a massively multiplayer online third-person shooter video game. &quot;Front Mission Evolved&quot; is a third-person shooter video game with rail shooter segments. In an RPGamer interview with Front Mission developer Koichi Sakamoto in 2007, he suggested that the development team is interested in combining real-time and turn-based aspects for future installments.

==Games==

Since 1995, the &quot;Front Mission&quot; series has released 15 video games, seven of which are main (numbered) entries and the other five are spin-off entries. Additionally, the series has spawned a number of video game ports, remakes, and compilations over its 15-year history. On July 12, 2002, a direct port of &quot;Front Mission&quot; was released for the Bandai WonderSwan Color. A year later, the video game entry received a Sony PlayStation remake under the title &quot;Front Mission First&quot; on October 23, 2003. Shortly after its release, a compilation titled &quot;Front Mission History&quot; was released in Japan on December 11, 2003. The compilation contained the &quot;Front Mission First&quot; remake, a modified &quot;Front Mission 2&quot;, and &quot;Front Mission 3&quot;. &quot;Front Mission First&quot; also spawned an enhanced port of the game on March 22, 2007 for the Nintendo DS. A second remake for &quot;Front Mission 2089&quot; was developed and titled as &quot;Front Mission 2089: Border of Madness&quot;. This remake was released for the &quot;Nintendo DS&quot; in Japan on May 29, 2008. A third remake for Front Mission (called Front Mission 1st) was released on November the 30th 2022 for the Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PS5.

While all &quot;Front Mission&quot; video games have seen releases in Japan, only a few been localized overseas. &quot;Front Mission 3&quot; was the first entry to receive both a North American and European localization on March 22, 2000 and August 11, 2000 respectively. &quot;Front Mission 4&quot; became the second entry to undergo an English localization and was released in North America on June 15, 2004. A three-year gap followed before the localization of the Nintendo DS port of &quot;Front Mission First&quot;, which saw a release in North America on October 23, 2007. This marked the third time that a &quot;Front Mission&quot; title was localized for the North American region. &quot;Front Mission Evolved&quot; became the first spin-off entry to be localized in North America and Europe, making it the fourth and second titles respectively to reach those regions. It was released in Japan on September 16, 2010, in North America on September 28, 2010, and in Europe on October 8, 2010.

To date, only seven &quot;Front Mission&quot; entries have ever been officially localized and released outside Japan.

==Common elements==

===Gameplay===
Although &quot;Front Mission&quot; video games venture into multiple genres, each of them contain core elements that are universal to the entire series. In the &quot;Front Mission&quot; series, players use playable units called wanzers, a term for mecha derived from the German word &quot;Wanderpanzer&quot;, or &quot;walking tank&quot;. Wanzers differ from the typical combat unit in that it has four modular parts: body, left arm, right arm, and legs. Each part has a specific function and its own health bar. The legs parts enable movement and evasion, the arm parts are necessary to use hand and shoulder weapons, and the body part maintains the wanzer&#x27;s operability. In the event the body is destroyed, the wanzer is removed from play completely. Destruction of arm and leg parts does not remove the wanzer from play, but it severely cripples its performance. While the player fights mostly wanzers, vehicles, aircraft, and mobile weapons platforms are also featured. These enemy units generally have only one part, the body, and are much stronger than wanzers themselves.

Wanzers can be customized with a variety of parts, computers, auxiliary backpacks, and weapons. The player has full control over customizing their wanzers and can do so as long as its total weight value does not exceed its given power output. To field a wanzer in battle, it must have a complete frame of parts: body, left arm, right arm, and legs. Parts with built-in weapons in the body or arm sections can also be equipped on a wanzer. In most &quot;Front Mission&quot; titles, computers must also be installed; these improve the accuracy of the weapons equipped on the wanzer. Auxiliary backpacks and weapons are not mandatory equipment to use wanzers, but are crucial in order to progress through the games. Auxiliary backpacks serve to give a wanzer special features during combat. For example, storage backpacks allow the player to carry extra ammunition or armor repair items.

In terms of weapons, there are four classes of weapons: melee weapons, short-range weapons, long-range weapons, and support fire weapons. Melee weapons are hand-to-hand weapons with a tendency to strike the body part of its target. Knuckles, pile bunkers, and rods are examples of melee weapons. Short-range weapons, such as machine guns, shotguns, and flamethrowers are used at close range and deal damage to all parts of a target. Long-range weapons have a long reach and are ideal for avoiding counterattacks. Sniper rifles, bazookas, and Gatling guns are examples of long-range weapons. Support-fire weapons, such as missiles, grenades, and rockets are indirect fire weapons; they can never be counterattacked and almost always hit their target, but have limited ammunition supply. Lastly, shields can be equipped on wanzers to absorb some of the damage taken from incoming attacks.

These are other gameplay features that are commonly seen in multiple &quot;Front Mission&quot; titles.

* Arena, introduced in &quot;Front Mission&quot;, allows the player to participate in special fights to earn monetary rewards or new parts. These fights take place in either individual matches, or team battles. This feature is also present in &quot;Front Mission 2&quot;, &quot;Front Mission 5: Scars of the War&quot;, &quot;Front Mission 2089: Border of Madness&quot;, and &quot;Front Mission: Online&quot;.
* Action Points (AP), introduced in &quot;Front Mission 2&quot;, determines the number of actions that can be taken during a Player and Enemy Phase. Every action, such as movement or counterattacks, has a certain AP cost. After one full turn (which is made up of one Player Phase and Enemy Phase) has passed, a set amount of AP is recharged. This feature is also present in &quot;Front Mission 3&quot;, &quot;Front Mission 4&quot;, and &quot;Front Mission 5: Scars of the War&quot;.

===Setting===
These are the fictional nations that play a major role in the &quot;Front Mission&quot; series.

Oceania Cooperative Union

The Oceania Cooperative Union (OCU) is a supranational union of countries in Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Australia. The OCU capital, where the OCU Central Parliament located, is Canberra, Australia. The union&#x27;s roots date back to 2006, when the Association of Southeast Asian Nations reorganized itself into the Bangkok Economic Alliance. The alliance is later renamed into the Oceania Cooperative Union in 2019 after Australia and Oceania decided to join the bloc. It is finally consolidated as a political union in 2026.

In the localized version of &quot;Front Mission 3&quot;, the OCU&#x27;s full name is presented as &quot;Oceana Community Union&quot;. The localized versions of subsequent games use the current naming convention instead.

United States of the New Continent

The United States of the New Continent (USN) is a supranational union of the North and South American countries. The USN capital, where the USN Central Government operates, is Washington DC. The union&#x27;s roots date back to 2011, when its relations with Australia began to sour following a diplomatic incident over the detention of an Australian ship named &quot;The Trinidad&quot;. The United States and Canada begin negotiations on merging with South American countries after the Republic of Zaftra is formed in 2015. These talks culminate in the creation of the USN five years later.

In the localized versions of &quot;Front Mission First&quot;, &quot;Front Mission 4&quot;, and &quot;Front Mission Evolved&quot;, the USN is presented as the Unified Continental States (UCS). The localized version of &quot;Front Mission 3&quot; retains the original naming convention.

European Community

The European Community (EC) is a supranational union of the nations in Europe. The capital, where the EC Central Assembly operates, is Paris, France. The union&#x27;s roots date back to the European Union&#x27;s (EU) genesis in 1993. In the late 1990s, the EU&#x27;s founding member-states began to convince other European countries to join their banner. The EU is renamed as the European Community in 2005 as the last of the non-EU countries agree to join the bloc.

Organization of African Consolidation

The Organization of African Consolidation (OAC) is an alliance of African countries. The union&#x27;s roots date back to 2026, when the EC and the OCU assisted the African nations to merge as a super-state. Unlike the other unions, the OAC is divided into five semi-autonomous regional blocs: the South African United States (SAUS), Union of North African States (UNAS), West African States Community Union (WA), the Community of Central African States (CA), and the East African Community (EA).

Republic of Zaftra

The Republic of Zaftra is a supranational union consisting of Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Zaftran capital, where the Zaftra Central Administration operates, is Moscow, Russia. The union&#x27;s roots date back to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The former Soviet republics struggled to survive on their own after it collapsed, facing economic hardships and civil conflicts. In an attempt to remedy their issues and make capitalism work, the post-Soviet nations reformed as the Republic of Zaftra in 2015.

Republic of Ravnui

The Republic of Ravnui is Belarus renamed after it seceded from the Commonwealth of Independent States rather than join the Republic of Zaftra in 2015. The nation&#x27;s capital is Minsk.

People&#x27;s Republic of Da Han Zhong

The People&#x27;s Republic of Da Han Zhong (DHZ) is formed from the presumably peaceful reunification of China and Taiwan. The nation&#x27;s capital is Beijing.

==Music==

The music of the series includes the soundtracks to the main series, composed of &quot;Front Mission&quot; through F&quot;ront Mission 5: Scars of the War&quot;, as well as the spin-off games, which include &quot;Front Mission: Gun Hazard&quot;, &quot;Front Mission Alternative&quot;, &quot;Front Mission: Online&quot;, &quot;Front Mission 2089&quot; and its remake &quot;Front Mission 2089: Border of Madness&quot;, &quot;Front Mission 2089-II&quot;, and &quot;Front Mission Evolved&quot;. The soundtracks of the series&#x27; installments have been released in album form in Japan, with the exceptions of &quot;2089&quot;, &quot;2089-II&quot;, &quot;Border of Madness&quot; (which reuse music from the other installments) and &quot;Evolved&quot;, which was published in 2010. The soundtrack to &quot;Front Mission&quot; was released in 1995 by NTT Publishing, which also published the soundtrack to &quot;Front Mission: Gun Hazard&quot; in 1996. DigiCube published soundtrack albums for &quot;Front Mission 2&quot; and &quot;Alternative&quot; in 1997 and &quot;3&quot; in 1999. Square Enix published the albums for &quot;Front Mission 4&quot; in 2004, and &quot;5&quot; and &quot;Online&quot; in 2006.

The soundtracks of the series have been warmly reviewed by critics, especially those of the main series and &quot;Gun Hazard&quot;. The music of &quot;Alternative&quot; and &quot;Online&quot; was less well-received. The music of the series typically includes a fusion of electronic and orchestral music, though each game and composer in the series has taken the music in different directions. The composers for the series have included Yoko Shimomura, Noriko Matsueda, Koji Hayama, Hayato Matsuo, Hidenori Iwasaki, and Garry Schyman. A box set of music from across the series is currently planned, but has not yet been formally announced or given a release date.

==Reception==

In April 1995, Front Mission&#x27;s original release on the Super Famicom was well received. &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine gave the Super Famicom version of the game first a 9 out of 10 and later an 8 out of 10 in their Reader Cross Review. &quot;Mega Fun&quot; gave the game a Gold for an import game. &quot;Front Mission: Gun Hazard&quot; was rated by &quot;Fun Generation&quot; a 7 out of 10, while &quot;Super GamePower&quot; gave it a 4.2 out of 5. &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine awarded &quot;Front Mission 2&quot; the game 32 out of 40 upon its release. The magazine chose the game as the number 63rd best game on the original PlayStation. Greg Kasavin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the graphics of &quot;Front Mission Alternative&quot; and audio experience, but criticized the game for being too short and rewarding players with more elaborate story sections if they failed to achieve game missions, indirectly rewarding failure. He also called the soundtrack &quot;a bunch of dizzying techno that doesn&#x27;t suit the onscreen grandeur&quot;. &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; noted it was not a very deep real time strategy game, but praised its branching stories and variety of endings. &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted that &quot;Front Mission 3&quot; may be a title worth introducing the franchise to American audiences, but criticized its graphics for being a notch lower than &quot;Front Mission 2&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; lauded the game&#x27;s battle mechanics as rare in other Square installments since &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, but cited the graphics transitions between overhead play and individual battles as spotty.

&quot;Front Mission 4&quot; holds a 75% on both GameRankings and Metacritic. North American reaction to the game was consistent across the board, receiving mixed to generally good reviews. It was praised for its deep gameplay, customizable wanzers, and high production values. On the disapproving side many felt the plot advanced at a sluggish pace, the AI was subpar, and the menu system was cumbersome at times. &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave generally positive feedback for &quot;Front Mission Online&quot;, describing how the game was successfully transforming the strategy game series into an action and combat based experience. In RPG Fan&#x27;s Games of 2006 feature, they enumerated the reasons that &quot;Front Mission 5: Scars of the War&quot; was the &quot;Import RPG of the Year&quot; make note of the game&#x27;s improvements and excellent execution in design and functionality. The game was also voted the runner-up &quot;Strategy RPG of the Year&quot; by RPG Fan in their &quot;Games of 2006&quot; awards. While the developers acknowledge the good reception of the cinematic focus of the game, they noted that later entries in the series would not necessarily follow the same direction.

Greg Miller of &quot;IGN&quot; scored &quot;Front Mission Evolved&quot; a 6.0/10, calling it &quot;uninspired&quot; and that it would only appeal to &quot;hardcore mech-heads&quot;. He commented that the missions were mainly &quot;frustrating filler&quot;, and while the customization of the wanzer was enjoyable, it was often negated by missions &quot;shoehorning you into annoying loadouts&quot;. Calling its story &quot;less than stellar&quot;, he stated that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t feel like a full fledged game&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; called &quot;Left Alive&quot; a “failure on every level”, with poor controls and game balances issues cited along with technical glitches. &quot;Destructoid&quot; praises the game&#x27;s soundtrack and art direction, but highlighted the low resolution graphical textures that gave the game a “drab” look. They also noted “laughable” enemy physics, where killed enemies bodies would jump in the air however they died. They further describes voice acting as “varied”, from decent, to sounding like the actors “gave up” after one take. &quot;Kotaku&quot; loved the idea of urban warfare, including searching for improvised weapons to take on war mechs, but the game&#x27;s “stiff” and “sluggish” controls made the game impossibly hard to play.

===Legacy===

Since 1994, the &quot;Front Mission&quot; series has spawned numerous products in various media outside of video games. The series has a long-running line of manga and novels that are expanded universe supplements to the stories of the &quot;Front Mission&quot; video games. Likewise, the series has produced two live-action films directed by Yoshihiko Dai and a ten-episode radio drama directed by Hiroshi Yamaguchi, both of which further expand the &quot;Front Mission&quot; universe. Some of the actors and actresses that have been involved in these productions include Banjō Ginga, Hiromi Tsuru, Dax Griffin, Danielle Keaton, and Tina Coté. Apart from these media, there have been numerous books, toys, and soundtracks that have been published under the &quot;Front Mission&quot; brand name.

<doc id="330322" wikidata="Q564072" url="?curid=330322" title="Annabel Lee">
<text>&quot;Annabel Lee&quot; is the last complete poem composed by American author Edgar Allan Poe. Like many of Poe&#x27;s poems, it explores the theme of the death of a beautiful woman. The narrator, who fell in love with Annabel Lee when they were young, has a love for her so strong that even angels are envious. He retains his love for her after her death. There has been debate over who, if anyone, was the inspiration for &quot;Annabel Lee&quot;. Though many women have been suggested, Poe&#x27;s wife Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe is one of the more credible candidates. Written in 1849, it was not published until shortly after Poe&#x27;s death that same year.

==Synopsis==
The poem&#x27;s narrator describes his love for Annabel Lee, which began many years ago in a &quot;kingdom by the sea&quot;. Though they were young, their love for each other burned with such intensity that even angels were envious. For this reason, the narrator believes the seraphim caused her death. Even so, their love is strong enough that it extends beyond the grave and the narrator believes their two souls are still entwined. Every night, the narrator dreams of Annabel Lee and sees the brightness of her eyes in the stars. Every night, the narrator lies down by her side in her tomb by the sea.

==Analysis==
Like many other Poe poems including &quot;The Raven&quot;, &quot;Ulalume&quot;, and &quot;To One in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; follows the theme of the death of a beautiful woman, which Poe called &quot;the most poetical topic in the world&quot;. Like women in many other works by Poe, she marries young and is struck with illness. The poem focuses on an ideal love which is unusually strong. In fact, the narrator&#x27;s actions show that he not only loves Annabel Lee, but he worships her, something he can only do after her death. The narrator admits that he and Annabel Lee were children when they fell in love, but his explanation that angels murdered her is in itself childish, suggesting he has failed to mature since then. His repetition of this assertion suggests he is trying to rationalize his own excessive feelings of loss.

Unlike &quot;The Raven&quot;, in which the narrator believes he will &quot;nevermore&quot; be reunited with his love, &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; says the two will be together again, as not even demons &quot;can ever dissever&quot; their souls.

===Poetic structure===
&quot;Annabel Lee&quot; consists of six stanzas, three with six lines, one with seven, and two with eight, with the rhyme pattern differing slightly in each one. Though it is not technically a ballad, Poe referred to it as one. Like a ballad, the poem uses repetition of words and phrases purposely to create its mournful effect. The name Annabel Lee emphasizes the letter &quot;L&quot;, a frequent device in Poe&#x27;s female characters such as &quot;Eulalie&quot;, &quot;Lenore&quot;, and &quot;Ulalume&quot;.

The Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore, Maryland has identified 11 versions of &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; that were published between 1849 and 1850. The biggest variation is in the final line:
:Original manuscript: &quot;In her tomb by the side of the sea&quot;
:Alternative version: &quot;In her tomb by the sounding sea&quot;

==Inspiration==

It is unclear on whom the eponymous character Annabel Lee is based. Biographers and critics usually suggest Poe&#x27;s frequent use of the &quot;death of a beautiful woman&quot; theme stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his own life, including his mother Eliza Poe and his foster mother Frances Allan. Biographers often interpret that &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; was written for Poe&#x27;s wife Virginia, who had died two years prior, as was suggested by poet Frances Sargent Osgood, though Osgood is herself a candidate for the poem&#x27;s inspiration. A strong case can be made for Poe&#x27;s wife Virginia: She was the one he loved as a child, the only one who had been his bride, and the only one who had died. Autobiographical readings of the poem have also been used to support the theory that Virginia and Poe never consummated their marriage, as &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; was a &quot;maiden&quot;. Critics, including T. O. Mabbott, believed that Annabel Lee was merely the product of Poe&#x27;s gloomy imagination and that Annabel Lee was no real person in particular. A childhood sweetheart of Poe&#x27;s named Sarah Elmira Royster believed the poem was written with her in mind and that Poe himself said so. Sarah Helen Whitman and Sarah Anna Lewis also claimed to have inspired the poem.

==Publication history and reception==
&quot;Annabel Lee&quot; was probably composed in May 1849. Poe took steps to ensure that the poem would be seen in print. He gave a copy to Rufus Wilmot Griswold, his literary executor and personal rival, gave another copy to John Thompson to repay a $5 debt, and sold a copy to &quot;Sartain&#x27;s Union Magazine&quot; for publication. Though &quot;Sartain&#x27;s&quot; was the first authorized printing in January 1850, Griswold was the first to publish it on October 9, 1849, two days after Poe&#x27;s death as part of his obituary of Poe in the Horace Greeley newspaper the &quot;New-York Daily Tribune&quot;. Thompson had it published in the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; in November 1849.

&quot;Annabel Lee&quot; was an inspiration for Vladimir Nabokov, especially for his novel &quot;Lolita&quot; (1955), in which the narrator, as a child, falls in love with the terminally ill Annabel Leigh &quot;in a princedom by the sea&quot;. Originally, Nabokov titled the novel &quot;The Kingdom by the Sea&quot;. Nabokov later used this as the title of the Lolita &quot;doppelganger novel&quot; in &quot;Look at the Harlequins!&quot;.

==Adaptations==
*The English composer Henry David Leslie (1822–96) set this as a ballad for voice and piano, respelling as &quot;Annabelle Lee&quot;.
* The 1914 silent film &quot;The Avenging Conscience&quot; is based on &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; and Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;.
* 1968 Short Film &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; featuring Paul Le Mat (an unknown at the time) and Margo Duke - directed by Ronald R. Morante and Producer Paul Wolff - won best International Short Subject Competition for Best Cinematography. All rights were sold to Warner Bros. ca. 1969.

<text>The northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), fulmar, or Arctic fulmar is an abundant seabird found primarily in subarctic regions of the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. There has been one confirmed sighting in the Southern Hemisphere, with a single bird seen south of New Zealand. Fulmars come in one of two colour morphs; a light one in temperate populations, with white head and body and grey wings and tail, and a dark one in arctic populations, which is uniformly grey; intermediate birds are common. Though similar in appearance to gulls, fulmars are in fact members of the family Procellariidae, which includes petrels and shearwaters.

The northern fulmar and its sister species, the southern fulmar (), are the only extant members of the genus . The fulmars are in turn a member of the order Procellariiformes, and they all share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns; however, nostrils on albatrosses are on the sides of the bill, as opposed to the rest of the order, including fulmars, which have nostrils on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. One of these plates makes up the hooked portion of the upper bill, called the maxillary unguis. They produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defense against predators from a very early age, and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. It will mat the plumage of avian predators, and can lead to their death. Finally, they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage that helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. This gland excretes a high saline solution from their nose.

The northern fulmar was first described as &quot;&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in 1761, based on a specimen from within the Arctic Circle, on Spitsbergen. The Mallemuk Mountain in Northeastern Greenland is named after the northern fulmar ().

==Taxonomy==
The northern fulmar was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1761 in the second edition of his book &quot;Fauna Svecica&quot;. He placed it with the other petrels in the genus &quot;Procellaria&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Procellaria glacialis&quot;. Linnaeus based his description mainly on the &quot;Mallemucke&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1675 by the German naturalist Friderich Martens in his account of his voyage to Spitzbergen. The northern fulmar is now placed in the genus &quot;Fulmarus&quot; that was introduced in 1826 by the English naturalist James Stephens. The genus name comes from the Old Norse &quot;Fúlmár&quot; meaning &quot;foul-mew&quot; or &quot;foul-gull&quot; because of the birds&#x27; habit of ejecting a foul-smelling oil. The specific epithet &quot;&quot; is Latin for &quot;icy&quot;.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;F. g. glacialis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1761) – the nominate subspecies, which breeds in the high arctic regions of the North Atlantic; remains at high latitudes in winter, occasionally south to Great Britain. Mostly dark morph, with grey body.
* &quot;F. g. auduboni&quot; Bonaparte, 1857 – breeds in the low arctic, boreal and temperate regions of the North Atlantic, south to Newfoundland in the west and Brittany in the east; wintering south to Delaware in the west and Portugal in the east. Tail pale grey. Mostly light morph, with white body. Included in &quot;F. g. glacialis&quot; by some authors.
* &quot;F. g. rodgersii&quot; Cassin, 1862 – breeds in the North Pacific on the coast of eastern Siberia (south to the Kuril Islands), Alaska, and (in very small numbers) in British Columbia south to Triangle Island; wintering south to Japan in the west and Baja California in the east. Tail contrastingly dark grey.

==Description==
The northern fulmar has a wingspan of and is in length. Body mass can range from . This species is grey and white with a pale yellow, thick bill and bluish legs. However, there are both a light morph and dark, or &quot;blue&quot;, morph; in the Pacific Ocean there is an intermediate morph as well. Only the dark morph has more than dark edges on the underneath but they all have pale inner primaries on the top of the wings. The Pacific morph has a darker tail than the Atlantic morph.

Like other petrels, their walking ability is limited, but they are strong fliers, with a stiff wing action quite unlike the gulls. They look bull-necked compared to gulls, and have short stubby bills. They are long-lived, with a lifespan of 31 years not uncommon, and exceptionally over 50 years, recorded on Eynhallow in Orkney.
==Behaviour==

===Feeding===
Northern fulmars will feed on shrimps, fish, squid, plankton, jellyfish, and carrion, as well as refuse. When eating fish, they will dive up to 4 metres deep to retrieve their prey.

===Breeding===
The northern fulmar starts breeding at between six and twelve years old. It is monogamous, and forms long-term pair bonds. It returns to the same nest site year after year. The breeding season starts in May; however, the female has glands that store sperm to allow weeks to pass between copulation and the laying of the egg. During the breeding season adult Fulmars usually remain within 500 km of their breeding colony instead of traveling up to thousands of kilometres while searching for food. Their nest is a scrape on a grassy ledge or a saucer of vegetation on the ground, lined with softer material. The birds nest in large colonies Recently, they have started nesting on rooftops and buildings. Both sexes are involved in the nest-building process. A single white egg, , is incubated for a period of 50 to 54 days, by both sexes. The altricial chick is brooded for 2 weeks and fully fledges after 70 to 75 days. Again, both sexes are involved. During this period, the parents are nocturnal, and will even be inactive on well-lit nights.

===Social behaviour===
The mating ritual of this fulmar consists of the female resting on a ledge and the male landing with his bill open and his head back. He commences to wave his head side to side and up and down while calling.

They make grunting and chuckling sounds while eating and guttural calls during the breeding season.

==Conservation==
The northern fulmar is estimated to have between 15,000,000 and 30,000,000 mature individuals that occupy an occurrence range of and their North American population is on the rise, hence it is listed with the IUCN as Least Concern. The range of these species increased greatly last century due to the availability of fish offal from commercial fleets, but may contract because of less food from this source and climatic change. The population increase has been especially notable in the British Isles.

== Anthropogenic impact ==
Northern fulmars&#x27; stomach contents are a hallmark indicator of marine debris in marine environments because of their high abundance and wide distribution. A study of 143 northern fulmars from 2008 to 2013 found 89.5% of them containing microplastics within their gastrointestinal tracts. A mean score of 19.5 pieces of plastic and 0.461 g per individual was calculated. This is considerably higher than in past studies on northern fulmars, possibly implying increasing plastic debris in marine ecosystems and shorelines. However, more research is needed to substantiate such conclusion. Long-term data from the Netherlands dating back to the 1980s show an increase in consumer plastics and a decrease in industrial plastics in the stomach contents of fulmars. The increased plastic ingestion can occur through biomagnification: their diet consists of such invertebrates like plankton that have shown an increase of consumption of microplastics entering the ocean. By going deeper into the food web of marine life, it is evident that fulmars could be indirectly affected through tropic transfer and biomagnification, and similarly could also affect their predators ingestion of plastic pollution. With the increase in freshwater pollution of plastic debris, there may be a further rise in microplastic content of seabird gastrointestinal tracts.

== Legend ==
A popular story among the central Inuit, for instance, is that of their race-mother Sedna, who was the daughter of a chief, and was wooed by a fulmar who promised her, if she would marry him, a delightful life in his distant home. So she went away with him. But she had been ruefully deceived, and was cruelly mistreated. A year later her father went to pay her a visit; and discovering her misery he killed her husband and took his repentant daughter home. The other fulmars in the village followed them, mourning and crying for their murdered fellow, and fulmars continue to utter doleful cries to this day.

<text>The southern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides) is a seabird of the Southern Hemisphere. Along with the northern fulmar, &quot;F. glacialis&quot;, it belongs to the fulmar genus &quot;Fulmarus&quot; in the family Procellariidae, the true petrels. It is also known as the Antarctic fulmar or silver-grey fulmar.

It is largely pale grey above and white below with a distinctive white patch on the wing. It breeds on the coast of Antarctica and on surrounding islands, moving north in winter. It nests in colonies on cliffs, laying a single egg on a ledge or crevice. Its diet includes krill, fish and squid picked from the water&#x27;s surface.

==Taxonomy==
The southern fulmar formally described and illustrated in 1840 by the Scottish zoologist Andrew Smith in his major work &quot;Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa&quot;. He placed it with all the other petrels in the genus &quot;Procellaria&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Procellaria glacialoides&quot;. The southern fulmar is now placed with the northern fulmar in the genus &quot;Fulmarus&quot; that was introduced in 1826 by the English naturalist James Stephens. The genus name comes from the Old Norse &quot;Fúlmár&quot; meaning &quot;foul-mew&quot; or &quot;foul-gull&quot; because of the birds&#x27; habit of ejecting a foul-smelling oil. The specific epithet &quot;glacialoides&quot; combines the specific &quot;glacialis&quot; introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1761 for the northern fulmar with the Ancient Greek &quot;-oidēs&quot; meaning &quot;resembling&quot;.
 The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. Molecular data suggests that the two fulmar species diverged during the Pleistocene epoch.

==Description==
It is a fairly large, bulky petrel, long with a wingspan of . The male has an average weight of while the smaller female weighs around . These weights increase to at the start of a shift incubating the eggs. The male has a wing length of , bill length of , tarsus length of and tail length of . The female has a wing length of , bill length of , tarsus length of and tail length of .

The bird flies with a mixture of shallow flaps and long glides, often looking down to scan the water. The wings are fairly broad and rounded and are held stiff. The plumage is mainly pale silvery-grey above and white below. The head is white with a pale grey crown. The wingtips are blackish with a large white patch and the wings have a dark rear edge. The legs and feet are pale blue. The bill is pink with a black tip and dark bluish naricorns. First-year birds have a more slender bill than the adults.

It is usually silent but has loud, cackling calls which are uttered at the nest or in feeding flocks. Courting birds produce soft droning and guttural croaking calls.

==Distribution and habitat==
There are colonies on a number of the islands around Antarctica such as the South Sandwich Islands, South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island, and Peter I Island. The bird also breeds at several sites along the mainland coast of Antarctica.

At sea, it mainly occurs along the outer edge of the pack ice in summer with water temperatures of −1.5 to 0.5 °C. In winter, it regularly ranges north to around 40°S latitude. It occurs further north in the cool waters of the Humboldt Current, reaching Peru. Small numbers are seen off the coasts of South Africa, southern Australia and New Zealand. Many birds can be washed up on beaches after storms. There are several unconfirmed reports from the west coast of North America.

It is a common species with a population of at least 4 million individuals. About a million pairs breed on the South Sandwich Islands alone. The species is not thought to be at risk of extinction and is classed as least concern by Birdlife International.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===

The breeding colonies may contain hundreds of birds and are on cliffs in ice-free areas with the birds arriving in October. The courtship display consists of a pair sitting alongside each other while calling, waving their heads and nibbling and preening each other. The nest is a shallow scrape lined with stone chips. It is built in a spot sheltered from the wind on a ledge or scree slope or in a crevice. A single, white egg is laid during late November or early December. It measures and weighs about . It is incubated for about 45 days with both parents taking turns in stints of 3–9 days. The down feathers of the young birds are initially white apart from a blue-grey wash on the mantle. The second set of down feathers is grey on the upperparts and flanks while the rest of the underparts and the forehead remain white. The young fledge after around 52 days. Poor weather can lead to high mortality rates among eggs and chicks and they are also preyed on by skuas and sheathbills. Breeding success increases as the parents mature, improving from 48% at age 6–8 to 87% at age 18–20.

===Feeding===
Southern fulmars frequently gather in flocks, often with other species of seabird such as Cape petrels, when there is a concentration of food like a school of krill or around whaling ships and trawlers. Krill and other crustaceans are the most important component of the diet but the species also feeds on small fish such as the Antarctic silverfish and squid such as &quot;Psychroteuthis&quot;, &quot;Gonatus&quot; and &quot;Galiteuthis&quot;. Food is usually picked from the surface of the water but the bird will occasionally dive.

<doc id="330329" wikidata="Q206840" url="?curid=330329" title="Red-necked phalarope">
<text>The red-necked phalarope (Phalaropus lobatus), also known as the northern phalarope and hyperborean phalarope, is a small wader. This phalarope breeds in the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is migratory, and, unusually for a wader, winters at sea on tropical oceans.

==Taxonomy==

In 1743, the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the red-necked phalarope in the first volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The coot-footed tringa&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a specimen that had been collected off the coast of Maryland. When in 1758, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the red-necked phalarope with the phalaropes and sandpipers in the genus &quot;Tringa&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Tringa lobata&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The red-necked phalarope is now placed in the genus &quot;Phalaropus&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The English and genus names come through French &quot;phalarope&quot; and scientific Latin &quot;Phalaropus&quot; from Ancient Greek &quot;phalaris&quot;, &quot;coot&quot;, and &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;. Coots and phalaropes both have lobed toes. The specific &quot;lobatus&quot; is Neo-Latin for &quot;lobed&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The red-necked phalarope is about in length, with lobed toes and a straight, fine bill. The breeding female is predominantly dark grey above, with a chestnut neck and upper breast, black face and white throat. They have a white wing stripe which helps distinguish this bird from the similar Wilson&#x27;s phalarope. The breeding male is a duller version of the female. They have lobed toes to assist with their swimming. Young birds are grey and brown above, with buff underparts and a black patch through the eye. In winter, the plumage is essentially grey above and white below, but the black eyepatch is always present. They have a sharp call described as a &quot;whit&quot; or &quot;twit&quot;.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===

Female red-necked phalaropes are generally larger than males, though there is some overlap between small-bodied females and large-bodied males. The females pursue and fight over males, and will defend their mate from other females until the clutch is complete and the male begins incubation. The males perform all incubation and chick-rearing activities, while the females may attempt to find another mate. Females may lay multiple clutches per year if her original nest fails or there are an excess of adult males in the breeding population. Once it becomes too late in the breeding season to start new nests, females begin their southward migration, leaving the males to incubate the eggs and look after the young.
The nest is a grass-lined depression at the top of a small mound. Clutch size is usually four splotchy olive-buff eggs, but can be fewer. Incubation is about 20 days. The young are precocial, and mainly feed themselves and are able to fly within 20 days of hatching.

===Feeding===
When feeding, a red-necked phalarope will often swim in a small, rapid circle, forming a small whirlpool. This behaviour is thought to aid feeding by raising food from the bottom of shallow water. The bird will reach into the centre of the vortex with its bill, plucking small insects or crustaceans caught up therein. On the open ocean, they are often found where converging currents produce upwellings. During migration, some flocks stop over on the open waters at the mouth of the Bay of Fundy to take advantage of food stirred up by tidal action.

===Migration===
Almost all of the nonbreeding season is spent in open water. As this species rarely comes into contact with humans, it can be unusually tame.

===Status===
The red-necked phalarope is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

==In Britain and Ireland==
The red-necked phalarope is a rare and localised breeding species in Ireland and Britain, which lie on the extreme edge of its world range. The most reliable place for them is Shetland, particularly the Loch of Funzie on Fetlar, with a few birds breeding elsewhere in Scotland in the Outer Hebrides (e.g. at Loch na Muilne, where a &quot;phalarope watchpoint&quot; has been set up) and sometimes the Scottish Mainland in Ross-shire or Sutherland. They have also bred in western Ireland since about 1900, where the population reached a peak of about 50 pairs. There have been very few breeding records in Ireland since the 1970s, but breeding was reported from County Mayo in 2015, involving a male and three females.

The tracking of a tagged bird from Fetlar unexpectedly revealed that it wintered with a North American population in the tropical Pacific Ocean; it took a round trip across the Atlantic via Iceland and Greenland, then south down the Eastern seaboard of America, across the Caribbean and Mexico, before ending up off the coast of Ecuador and Peru. For this reason, it is suspected that the Shetland population could be an offshoot of a North American population rather than the geographically closer Scandinavian population that is believed to winter in the Arabian Sea.

<text>The red phalarope or grey phalarope (Phalaropus fulicarius) is a small wader. This phalarope breeds in the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is migratory, and, unusually for a wader, migrates mainly on oceanic routes, wintering at sea on tropical oceans.

==Taxonomy==
In 1750, the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the red phalarope in the third volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Red-footed Tringa&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a preserved specimen that had been brought to London from the Hudson Bay area of Canada by James Isham. When the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition in 1758, he included the red phalarope and placed it with phalaropes and sandpipers in the genus &quot;Tringa&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Tringa fulicaria&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The red phalarope is now one of three species placed in the genus &quot;Phalaropus&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The English and genus names for phalaropes come through French &quot;phalarope&quot; and scientific Latin &quot;Phalaropus&quot; from Ancient Greek &quot;phalaris&quot;, &quot;coot&quot;, and &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;. The specific &quot;fulicarius&quot; is from Latin &quot;fulica&quot;, &quot;coot&quot;. Coots and phalaropes both have lobed toes.

==Description==
The red phalarope is about in length, with lobed toes and a straight bill, somewhat thicker than that of red-necked phalarope. The breeding female is predominantly dark brown and black above, with red underparts and white cheek patches. The bill is yellow, tipped black. The breeding male is a duller version of the female. Young birds are light grey and brown above, with buff underparts and a dark patch through the eye. In winter, the plumage is essentially grey above and white below, but the black eyepatch is always present. The bill is black in winter. Their call is a short &quot;beek&quot;.

==Breeding==

The typical avian sex roles are reversed in the three phalarope species. Females are larger and more brightly coloured than males. The females pursue males, compete for nesting territory, and will aggressively defend their nests and chosen mates. Once the females lay their olive-brown eggs, they begin their southward migration, leaving the males to incubate the eggs and care for the young. Three to six eggs are laid in a ground nest near water. Incubation lasts 18 or 19 days. The young mainly feed themselves and are able to fly within 18 days of birth.

==Behaviour==
When feeding, a red phalarope will often swim in a small, rapid circle, forming a small whirlpool. This behaviour is thought to aid feeding by raising food from the bottom of shallow water. The bird will reach into the outskirts of the vortex with its bill, plucking small insects or crustaceans caught up therein. They sometimes fly up to catch insects in flight. On the open ocean, they are found in areas where converging ocean currents produce upwellings and are often found near groups of whales. Outside of the nesting season they often travel in flocks.

This species is often very tame and approachable.

==Status and conservation==
The red phalarope is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>Wilson&#x27;s phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor) is a small wader. This bird, the largest of the phalaropes, breeds in the prairies of North America in western Canada and the western United States. It is migratory, wintering in inland salt lakes near the Andes in Argentina. They are passage migrants through Central America around March/April and again during September/October. The species is a rare vagrant to western Europe.

This species is often very tame and approachable. Sometimes it is placed in a monotypic genus Steganopus.

==Etymology==
This bird is named after Scottish-American ornithologist Alexander Wilson. The English and genus names for phalaropes come through French &quot;phalarope&quot; and scientific Latin &quot;Phalaropus&quot; from Ancient Greek &quot;phalaris&quot;, &quot;coot&quot;, and &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;. Coots and phalaropes both have lobed toes. The specific &quot;tricolor&quot; is from Latin &quot;tri-&quot;, &quot;three-&quot;, and &quot;color, coloris&quot; &quot;colour&quot;.

==Description==

Wilson&#x27;s phalarope is slightly larger than the red phalarope at about in length. It is a dainty shorebird with lobed toes and a straight fine black bill. The breeding female is predominantly gray and brown above, with white underparts, a reddish neck and reddish flank patches. The breeding male is a duller version of the female, with a brown back, and the reddish patches reduced or absent.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

In a study of breeding phalaropes in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada, females were found to average around 10% larger in standard measurements and to weigh around 30% more than the males. Females weighed from , whereas males average .
Young birds are grey and brown above, with whitish underparts and a dark patch through the eye. In winter, the plumage is essentially grey above and white below, but the dark eyepatch is always present. The average longevity in the wild is 10 years.

==Ecology and status==
Wilson&#x27;s phalaropes are unusually halophilic (salt-loving) and feed in great numbers when on migration on saline lakes such as Mono Lake in California, Lake Abert in Oregon, and the Great Salt Lake of Utah, often with red-necked phalaropes.

When feeding, a Wilson&#x27;s phalarope will often swim in a small, rapid circle, forming a small whirlpool. This behaviour is thought to aid feeding by raising food from the bottom of shallow water. The bird will reach into the outskirts of the vortex with its bill, plucking small insects or crustaceans caught up therein.

The typical avian sex roles are reversed in the three phalarope species. Females are larger and more brightly coloured than males. The females pursue males, compete for nesting territory, and will aggressively defend their nests and chosen mates. Once the females lay their eggs, they begin their southward migration, leaving the males to incubate the eggs. Three to four eggs are laid in a ground nest near water. The young feed themselves.

Although very common, this bird&#x27;s population may have declined in some areas due to the loss of prairie wetland habitat. A few staging areas are of critical importance during migration.

<text>Ateneo de Manila University (; ), commonly referred to as Ateneo de Manila or Ateneo, is a private, Catholic, teaching and research university, and a basic education institution located in Quezon City, Philippines. Established in 1859 by the Jesuits, it is among the oldest Jesuit-administered institutions of higher education in the Asia-Pacific.

Ateneo de Manila is widely regarded as one of the leading universities in the Philippines, offering primary and secondary education, as well as undergraduate and graduate programs in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, engineering, and business. The university provides professional degrees through the Graduate School of Business, the School of Government, the School of Medicine and Public Health, and Ateneo Law School. It follows a Jesuit tradition of liberal arts education, emphasizing the humanities at all educational levels.

==History==
The Jesuits returned to the Philippines in the 19th century following their expulsion from Spanish lands in 1759, and were tasked with managing a small private school in Manila, renaming it the Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1859. Initially situated in Intramuros, the school moved to Ermita after the original campus was destroyed by fire in 1932. However, it was again destroyed during the Battle of Manila in 1945. Post-World War II, in 1954, the university relocated to its present campus in Loyola Heights, Quezon City, and eventually sold the Ermita site (now Robinsons Manila).

Fr. Pacífico Ortíz, SJ became the first Filipino president of the university on September 25, 1969. During his tenure, the Graduate School was divided into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and what would later become the Graduate School of Business. In 1968, Ateneo co-founded the Asian Institute of Management. Women were first admitted to the college in 1973. By 1976, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences had moved to Loyola Heights, and the Padre Faura campus was finally closed in 1977.

In the 1970s, Ateneo students became active in protests against the Marcos dictatorship and its imposition of martial law, and many later participated in the 1986 People Power Revolution.

In 1991, the Ateneo Law School became the first in the country to offer the Juris Doctor degree. The School of Government was established in 1996, and a new campus for the Graduate School of Business, Law School, and School of Government opened in Rockwell Center in 1998. Significant developments in the 2000s include the establishment of the Loyola Schools and completion of various educational and recreational facilities.

The university continued to expand and innovate, launching the Pathways to Higher Education initiative in 2002, and consecrating the Church of the Gesù at the Loyola Heights campus in July 2002.

In 2003, the Ateneo formalized its partnership with Gawad Kalinga for university-wide social action. The Manuel V. Pangilinan Center for Student Leadership opened in 2006, and the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health began operations in 2007.

In recent years, significant events include a shooting incident in July 2022 that led to the cancellation of the law school&#x27;s graduation ceremonies, and the consolidation of the university&#x27;s higher education units in October 2022.

<text>Field corn is a North American term for maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot;) grown for livestock fodder (silage and meal), ethanol, cereal, and processed food products. The principal field corn varieties are dent corn, flint corn, flour corn (also known as soft corn) which includes blue corn (&quot;Zea mays amylacea&quot;), and waxy corn.

Field corn primarily grown for livestock feed and ethanol production is allowed to mature fully before being shelled off the cob and being stored in silos, pits, bins, or grain &quot;flats&quot;. Part of it is used to make corn syrup, especially with dent corn. Field corn can also be harvested as high-moisture corn, shelled off the cob and piled and packed like silage for fermentation; or the entire plant may be chopped while still very high in moisture, with the resulting silage either loaded and packed in plastic bags, piled and packed in pits, or blown into and stored in vertical silos.

== Uses ==
Large-scale applications for field corn include:
* Livestock fodder, whether as whole cobs (for hogs only), whole or ground kernels, or (after chopping and ensilage) the entire above-ground portion of the unripe plant
* Cereal products including corn flour, corn meal, hominy, grits, nixtamal, tortillas, corn bread, and cold breakfast cereals (such as corn flakes).
* Other processed human-food products including corn starch, corn oil, corn syrup, and high-fructose corn syrup.
* Alcohol and corn whiskey
*Adhesives, plastic, gels, and thickeners from starch

 In some parts of Latin America and Mexico, field corn consumption far exceeds that of sweet corn. In the United States, field corn is not generally regarded as desirable for human food without commercial pre-processing. An exception is &quot;roasting ears&quot;, similar in appearance to corn on the cob, although it is necessarily roasted (rather than boiled or steamed as is usual with sweet corn), and is neither tender nor sweet even after the roasting. A variety of field corn is also commonly eaten in Andean South America and is known as Cuzco corn.

== Wet mills ==
Field corn is processed for its various uses in what are known as &quot;wet mills&quot;. These types of mills are different from traditional mills in that they take apart a cob of corn and process its various parts into products for consumption. The yellow skin of the kernel, for example, is separated from the dark germ, which is essentially the seed. While the yellow skin is usually used to produce nutritional supplements and vitamins, the germ is used to produce oil. The endosperm, which is the largest part of a corn kernel, has the most uses. Its carbohydrate molecules are taken apart to produce the organic compounds used in many products. Examples of these organic compounds include citric and lactic acid, glucose, fructose, and ethanol.

Cargill and ADM are the two largest corn processing companies in the United States.
