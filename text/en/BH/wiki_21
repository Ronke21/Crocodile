<text>&quot;&quot; (, ; &#x27;O God of Justice&#x27;) is the national anthem of Serbia, as defined by the Article 7 of the Constitution of Serbia. &quot;Bože pravde&quot; was adopted in 1882 and had been the national anthem of the Kingdom of Serbia until 1919 when Serbia became a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It was re-adopted as the national anthem at first by the parliamentary recommendation in 2004 and then constitutionally sanctioned in 2006, after Serbia restored its independence.

==History==
Before Serbia had an official national anthem, there were several songs that were unofficially used in this manner. The most popular of these was &quot;Rado ide Srbin u vojnike&quot; also known as &quot;Graničarska pesma&quot; (&quot;Granichary Song&quot;), which was written in 1844 by Vasa Živković on a melody composed by Nikola Đurković. It was used as a Serbian anthem during the Revolution of 1848.

The first initiative to create an official Serbian anthem came from Prince Mihailo in 1865. He hired (through the Ministry of Education) poet Jovan Jovanović Zmaj, to write lyrics, and composer Kornelije Stanković, to compose a melody for a new anthem. This anthem was created, but was not adopted, and was soon completely forgotten. Although it had no title, the first verse of this anthem was also &quot;Bože pravde&quot;.

After the assassination of Prince Mihailo in 1868, Prince Milan came to the throne. In 1872, celebrating his coming of age, he ordered a play from the manager of the National Theater in Belgrade, Jovan Đorđević. Đorđević quickly wrote and presented the play &quot;&quot; (&quot;Marko&#x27;s sword&quot;), with the aim of glorifying Serbian history and the ruling house of Obrenović. The song &quot;Bože pravde&quot;, composed by Davorin Jenko, was part of the play&#x27;s musical score. The song gained more popularity among the people than the piece itself, and in 1882, on the occasion of Milan&#x27;s enthronement as Serbian king, Đorđević reworked the text and so his new version became the first official anthem of Serbia.

In 1903, after the May Coup, the Obrenović dynasty died out and the house of Karađorđević came to the helm of Serbia. A competition for a new anthem was announced. It was won by Aleksa Šantić with a song titled &quot;Bože, na polja zemlje ove&quot; for which he wrote both lyrics and melody, but this new anthem was not officially adopted. Eventually, in 1909, King Peter I decided to make the anthem &quot;Bože pravde&quot; official again, with minor changes to the text.

Various rulers of Serbia changed the words of the anthem to suit them. During the rule of Prince Milan I, the words were (&#x27;God save Prince Milan&#x27;), which was changed to (&#x27;God save King Milan&#x27;), when Serbia became a kingdom. It was later tailored to Alexander I with the verse (&#x27;God save King Alexander&#x27;), and Peter I with (&#x27;God save King Peter&#x27;) as well.

During World War I, in the territories of Serbia occupied by Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, the performance of the national anthem, as well as the display of the symbols of the Kingdom of Serbia, was prohibited. During the time of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which later became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), &quot;Bože pravde&quot; was part of its national anthem. On the eve of the World War II, at the great international gathering of the Music Confederation, held in Paris, this anthem was declared one of the three most beautiful in the world.

&quot;Bože pravde&quot; was officially abandoned and banned after the World War II in 1945, in favour of &quot;Hej, Sloveni&quot; (&#x27;Hey, Slavs&#x27;), which was the national anthem of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for 47 years, from 1945 to 1992. After the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991-1992, only Serbia and Montenegro remained in the federation (i.e. the newly-formed Serbia and Montenegro), but since no agreement over the anthem could be reached, &quot;Hej, Sloveni&quot; remained the national anthem. Many Serbs disliked the song during this period and booed it whenever it was played, such as at sporting events. In 1992, &quot;Vostani Serbije&quot; and &quot;March on the Drina&quot; were proposed as the anthem of Serbia along with &quot;Bоže pravde&quot;. &quot;March on the Drina&quot;, popularized by then-ruling Socialist Party of Serbia, even received a plurality of popular vote on referendum, but was never officially adopted.
The recommendation on the use of &quot;Bože pravde&quot; was adopted unanimously by the National Assembly in 2004 and constitutionally sanctioned in 2006, after Serbia restored its independence, while the recommended text was promulgated into the law in 2009.
It utilizes slightly modified original lyrics, asserting that Serbia is no longer a monarchy — all the verses that had a monarchist overtone were changed. In three verses, (&#x27;Serbian king&#x27;) was changed to (&#x27;Serbian lands&#x27;), and the verse (&#x27;God save the Serbian king&#x27;) was changed to (&#x27;God protect, God defend&#x27;). In public performances, the verses (&#x27;God protect, God bless&#x27;) and (&#x27;Serbian lands, Serbian race&#x27;) are often sung on the repeat as (&#x27;Our Serbia, God defend&#x27;) and (&#x27;our whole race prays to you&#x27;), respectively.

&quot;Bože pravde&quot; was also used until 2006 as the regional anthem of the Republika Srpska, a constituency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, when it was ruled down by the country&#x27;s constitutional court for being unconstitutional and replaced with Moja Republika.

== Lyrics ==
The full Serbian national anthem as officially defined consists of eight stanzas, but usually only the first two are performed on public occasions for reasons of brevity. The third verse is also usually omitted in full performances.

<doc id="326175" wikidata="Q3657052" url="?curid=326175" title="Claud Cockburn">
<text>Francis Claud Cockburn ( ; 12 April 1904 – 15 December 1981) was a British journalist. His saying &quot;believe nothing until it has been officially denied&quot; is widely quoted in journalistic studies, but he did not claim credit for originating it. He was the second cousin, once removed, of the novelists Alec Waugh and Evelyn Waugh. He lived at Brook Lodge, Youghal, County Cork, Ireland.

In 1940 Cockburn&#x27;s Security Service file said that &quot;In 1939 he was a leading British Communist Party member and was said to be a leader of the Comintern in Western Europe&quot;.

==Early life==
Cockburn was born in Peking (present-day Beijing), China, on 12 April 1904, the son of Henry Cockburn, a British consul general, and wife Elizabeth Gordon (née Stevenson). His paternal great-grandfather was Scottish judge/biographer Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn. Cockburn was educated at Berkhamsted School, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, and Keble College, Oxford, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts. At Oxford he was part of the Hypocrites&#x27; Club.

==Journalist==
He became a journalist with &quot;The Times&quot; and worked as a foreign correspondent in Germany and the United States before he resigned in 1933 to start his own newsletter, &quot;The Week&quot;. It has been said that during his spell as a sub-editor on &quot;The Times&quot;, Cockburn and colleagues competed (with a small prize for the winner) to write the dullest printed headline. Cockburn only once claimed the honours, with &quot;Small Earthquake in Chile, Not many dead&quot;. No copy of &quot;The Times&quot; featuring that headline has been located although it finally appeared decades after the recollection in &quot;Not the Times&quot;, a spoof version of the newspaper produced by several journalists at &quot;The Times&quot; in 1979 during the paper&#x27;s year-long absence because of an industrial dispute.

==Spanish Civil War==
Under the alias Frank Pitcairn, Cockburn contributed to the British communist newspaper, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;. In 1936, Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, asked him to cover the Spanish Civil War. Cockburn joined the Fifth Regiment to report the war as a soldier. While in Spain, he published &quot;Reporter in Spain&quot;. According to the editor of a volume of his writings on Spain, Cockburn formed a personal relationship with Mikhail Koltsov, &quot;then the foreign editor of &quot;Pravda&quot; and, in Cockburn&#x27;s view, &#x27;the confidant and mouthpiece and direct agent of Stalin in Spain&#x27;&quot;.

Cockburn&#x27;s reporting in Spain, as &quot;Frank Pitcairn&quot;, was heavily criticised by George Orwell in his 1938 memoir &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;. Orwell accused Cockburn of being under the control of Stalinist handlers and was critical of Cockburn&#x27;s depiction of the Barcelona May Days in which Orwell had taken part and during which anti-Stalinist communists and anarchists were caught and executed by operatives of the Soviet NKVD. Specifically, to undermine anti-Stalinist factions on the Republican side, Cockburn falsely reported that the anti-Stalinist figurehead Andrés Nin, who had been tortured and executed by the NKVD, was alive and well after escaping to fascist territory.

According to writer Adam Hochschild, Cockburn functioned as Stalinist propagandist during the war &quot;on [Communist] Party orders&quot;. In one instance, Cockburn claimed to have been an eyewitness to a battle that he totally invented. This hoax was intended to persuade the French prime minister that Francisco Franco&#x27;s forces were weaker than they appeared and thus make the Republicans seem worthier candidates for help in obtaining arms. The ruse worked, and the French border was opened for a previously-stalled artillery shipment.

==Opposition to appeasement==
In the late 1930s Cockburn&#x27;s &quot;The Week&quot; was highly critical of Neville Chamberlain. Cockburn said in the 1960s that much of the information in &quot;The Week&quot; had been leaked to him by Sir Robert Vansittart, Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office.

At the same time, Cockburn said that the Security Service (MI5) was spying on him because of &quot;The Week&quot;, but the British historian D. C. Watt argued that it was more likely that if anyone was spying on Cockburn, it was the police Special Branch, which was less experienced in that work than MI5. However, a 1940 Security Service file on Cockburn was later made public, and Claud&#x27;s son Patrick Cockburn applied for his MI5 files and received 24 volumes of them. Cockburn was an opponent of appeasement before the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. In a 1937 article in &quot;The Week&quot;, Cockburn coined the term &quot;Cliveden set&quot; to describe what he alleged to be an upper-class pro-German group that exercised influence behind the scenes. &quot;The Week&quot; ceased publication shortly after the war began.

Watt alleges that the information printed in &quot;The Week&quot; included rumours, some of which suited Moscow&#x27;s interests. Watt used as an example the claim &quot;The Week&quot; made in February–March 1939 that German troops were concentrating in Klagenfurt for an invasion of Yugoslavia, which Watt says had no basis in reality.

==Postwar==
In 1947, Cockburn moved to Ireland and lived at Ardmore, County Waterford. He continued to contribute to newspapers and journals, including a weekly column for &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. There he famously stated, &quot;Wherever there is a stink in international affairs, you will find that Henry Kissinger has recently visited&quot;.

Among his novels were &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; (originally under the pseudonym James Helvick), &quot;The Horses&quot;, &quot;Ballantyne&#x27;s Folly&quot;, and &quot;Jericho Road&quot;. &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; was made into a film in 1953 by the director John Huston, who paid Cockburn £3,000 for the rights to the book and screenplay. Cockburn collaborated with Huston on the early drafts of the script, but the credit went to Truman Capote. The title was later used by Cockburn&#x27;s son Alexander for his regular column in &quot;The Nation&quot;.

He published &quot;Bestseller&quot;, an exploration of English popular fiction, &quot;Aspects of English History&quot; (1957), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Decade&quot; (1973), his history of the 1930s and &quot;Union Power&quot; (1976).

His first volume of memoirs was published as &quot;In Time of Trouble&quot; (1956) in the United Kingdom and as &quot;A Discord of Trumpets&quot; in the United States. It was followed by &quot;Crossing the Line&quot; (1958), and &quot;A View from the West&quot; (1961). Revised, they were published by Penguin as &quot;I, Claud...&quot; in 1967. Again revised and shortened, with a new chapter, they were republished as &quot;Cockburn Sums Up&quot; shortly before he died.

He also wrote &quot;Mr. Mintoff Comes to Ireland&quot;. The book was published in 1975 but set in 1980 when Dom Mintoff was Malta&#x27;s Prime Minister and leader of the Malta Labour Party. The cover description describes it as a &quot;shrewd assessment of how a small independent nation may best stand up to the so-called Great Powers&quot;.

<text>The African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) is one of the two living species of African elephant, along with the African bush elephant. It is native to humid tropical forests in West Africa and the Congo Basin. It is the smallest of the three living elephant species, reaching a shoulder height of . As with other African elephants, both sexes have straight, down-pointing tusks, which begin to grow once the animals reach 1–3 years old. The forest elephant lives in highly sociable family groups of up to 20 individuals. Since they forage primarily on leaves, seeds, fruit, and tree bark, they have often been referred to as the &#x27;megagardener of the forest&#x27;; the species is one of many that contributes significantly to maintaining the composition, diversity and structure of the Guinean Forests of West Africa and the Congolese rainforests. Seeds of various plants will go through the elephant&#x27;s digestive tract and eventually pass through in the animal&#x27;s droppings (likely in a new location where they will sprout), thus helping to maintain the spread and biodiversity of the forests.

The first scientific description of the species was published in 1900. During the 20th century, overhunting caused a sharp decline in population, and by 2013 it was estimated that fewer than 30,000 individuals remained. It is threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation, and poaching. The conservation status of populations varies across range countries. Since 2021, the species has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.

== Taxonomy==

&quot;Elephas&quot; (&quot;Loxodonta&quot;) &quot;cyclotis&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Paul Matschie in 1900 who described the skulls of a female and a male specimen collected by the Sanaga River in southern Cameroon.

=== Phylogeny and evolution ===
The African forest elephant was long considered to be a subspecies of the African elephant, together with the African bush elephant. Morphological and DNA analysis showed that they are two distinct species.

The taxonomic status of the African pygmy elephant (&quot;Loxodonta pumilio&quot;) was uncertain for a long time. Phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial genome of nine specimens from museum collections indicates that it is an African forest elephant whose diminutive size or early maturity is due to environmental conditions.

Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear DNA of African bush and forest elephants, Asian elephants, woolly mammoths and American mastodons revealed that the African forest elephant and African bush elephant are two distinct species that genetically diverged at least 1.9 million years ago. They are therefore considered distinct species. Despite evidence of hybridization between the two species where their ranges overlap, there appears to have been little gene flow between the two species since their initial divergence.

DNA from the extinct European straight-tusked elephant (&quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;) indicates that members of the extinct elephant genus &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; interbred with African forest elephants, with over 1/3 of the nuclear genome as well as the mitochondrial genome of the straight-tusked elephant deriving from that of African forest elephants, with the genomic contribution more closely related to modern West African populations of the forest elephant than to other populations. &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; carried multiple separate mitochondrial lineages derived from forest elephants.

== Description ==

The African forest elephant is considerably smaller than the African bush elephant, though the size of the species has been subject to contradictory estimates. A 2000 study suggested that bulls of the species reach a shoulder height of , and weighed , while females were about tall at the shoulder and . However, a 2003 study of forest elephants at a reserve in Gabon did not find any elephants taller than . A 2015 study alternately suggested that fully grown African forest elephant males in optimal condition were only on average tall and in weight, with the largest individuals (representing less than 1 in 100,000 as a proportion of the total population) no bigger than tall and in weight.

The African forest elephant has grey skin, which looks yellow to reddish after wallowing. It is sparsely covered with black coarse hair, which is long around the tip of the tail. The length of the tail varies between individuals from half the height of the rump to almost touching ground. It has five toenails on the fore foot and four on the hind foot. Its back is nearly straight. Its oval-shaped ears have small elliptical-shaped tips. and the tip of the trunk has two finger-like processes.

The African forest elephant&#x27;s tusks are straight and point downwards, and are present in both males and females. The African forest elephant has pink tusks, which are thinner and harder than the tusks of the African bush elephant. The length and diameter vary between individuals. Tusks of bulls grow throughout life, tusks of cows cease growing when they are sexually mature. The tusks are used to push through the dense undergrowth of their habitat. The largest tusk recorded for the species is long and in weight. A larger tusk measuring long and weighing has been recorded, but this may belong to a forest-bush elephant hybrid. The average tusk size is uncertain due to measurements historically being lumped in with those of African bush elephants, but based on the sizes of the largest known tusks may be in the region of and .

== Distribution and habitat ==

Populations of the African forest elephant in Central Africa range in large contiguous rainforest tracts from Cameroon to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the largest stable population in Gabon, where suitable habitat covers 90% of the country.

Nonetheless, it was estimated that the population of African forest elephants in Central Africa had declined by around 86% (in the 31 years preceding 2021) due to poaching and loss of habitat. In places such as Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic, many areas of appropriate forest habitat have been reduced after years of warfare and human conflict. During the first wildlife survey in 30 years (in 2021) by the Wildlife Conservation Society and the National Parks of Gabon, it was reported that an estimated 95,000 forest elephants lived in Gabon. Prior to this the population had been estimated to be as low as 50,000 to 60,000 individuals.

They are also distributed in the evergreen moist deciduous Upper Guinean forests in Ivory Coast and Ghana, in West Africa.

There is a small population of perhaps 10-25 elephants living on the escarpment to the east of Luanda in the Kambondo forest (Hines, pers. comm. 2015) and sightings of these elephants are marked as point records. Which are the southernmost forest elephants in Africa. 

==Behaviour and ecology==

The African forest elephant lives in family groups. Groups observed in the rain forest of Gabon&#x27;s Lopé National Park between 1984 and 1991 comprised between three and eight individuals. Groups of up to 20 individuals were observed in the Dzanga-Sangha Complex of Protected Areas, comprising adult cows, their daughters and subadult sons. Family members look after calves together, called allomothering. Once young bulls reach sexual maturity, they separate from the family group and form loose bachelor groups for a few days, but usually stay alone. Adult bulls associate with family groups only during the mating season. Family groups travel about per day and move in a home range of up to .
Their seasonal movement is related to the availability of ripe fruits in Primary Rainforests.
They use a complex network of permanent trails that pass through stands of fruit trees and connect forest clearings with mineral licks. These trails are reused by humans and other animals.

In Odzala-Kokoua National Park, groups were observed to frequently meet at forest clearings indicating a fission–fusion society. They stayed longer when other groups were also present. Smaller groups joined large groups, and bulls joined family units.

===Diet ===

The African forest elephant is an herbivore. Elephants observed in Lopé National Park fed mostly tree bark and leaves, and at least 72 different fruits.
To supplement their diet with minerals, they congregate at mineral-rich waterholes and mineral licks.

Elephant dung piles collected in Kahuzi-Biéga National Park contained seeds and fruit remains of &quot;Omphalocarpum mortehanii&quot;, junglesop (&quot;Anonidium mannii&quot;), &quot;Antrocaryon nannanii&quot;, &quot;Klainedoxa gabonensis&quot;, &quot;Treculia africana&quot;, &quot;Tetrapleura tetraptera&quot;, &quot;Uapaca guineensis&quot;, &quot;Autranella congolensis&quot;, &quot;Gambeya africana&quot; and &quot;G. lacourtiana&quot;, &quot;Mammea africana&quot;, &quot;Cissus dinklagei&quot;, and &quot;Grewia midlbrandii&quot;. Dung piles collected in a lowland rain forest in the northern Republic of Congo contained seeds of at least 96 plant species, with a minimum of 30 intact seeds and up to 1102 large seeds of more than in a single pile. Based on the analysis of 855 dung piles, it has been estimated that African forest elephants disperse a daily mean of 346 large seeds per of at least 73 tree species; they transport about a third of the large seeds for more than .

Seeds passed by elephant gut germinate faster. The African forest elephant is one of the most effective seed dispersers in the tropics and has been referred to as the &quot;megagardener of the forest&quot; due to its significant role in maintaining plant diversity. In the Cuvette Centrale, 14 of 18 megafaunal tree species depend on seed dissemination by African forest elephants, including wild mango (&quot;Irvingia gabonensis&quot;), &quot;Parinari excelsa&quot; and &quot;Tridesmostemon omphalocarpoides&quot;. These 14 species are not able to survive without elephants.
African forest elephants provide ecological services that maintain the composition and structure of Central African forests.

===Communication===
Vocalization is a trait found among &quot;L. cyclotis&quot; with studies emphasizing significance in acoustic structure and their social dynamics. Vocalization patterns can be classified into three main types: single rumble, single broadband, and combinatorial. Rumbles are tonal, low-frequency calls, while broadband are calls that lack clear harmonic structures, resembling barks and roars. The utilization of rumbles and broadband calls in combinatorial calls may involve distinct acoustic elements, forming multi-element calls, which combine meaningless elements to generate context-specific meaningful calls. &quot;L. cyclotis&quot; also exhibits a more balanced distribution of combinatorial call types compared to other elephant species. Despite having a simpler social structure, &quot;L. cyclotis&quot; can display a comparable repertoire of rumble-roar call combinations than &quot;L. africana&quot;. Communication patterns vary across age and sex, with adult males typically producing more combinatorial calls than adult females. Additionally, certain events may provoke a behavioral change, as evidenced by lowered levels of vocalizations in response to gunfire sounds related to poaching.

For these mammals, hearing and smell are the most important senses they possess because they do not have good eyesight. They can recognize and hear vibrations through the ground and can detect food sources with their sense of smell. Elephants are also an arrhythmic species, meaning they have the ability to see just as well in dim light as they can in the daylight. They are capable of doing so because the retina in their eyes adjusts nearly as quickly as light does.

The elephant&#x27;s feet are sensitive and can detect vibrations through the ground, whether thunder or elephant calls, from up to 10 miles away.

===Reproduction===
Females reach sexual maturity between the age of 8 and 12 years, depending on the population density and nutrition available. On average, they begin breeding at the age of 23 and give birth every 5–6 years. As a result, the birth rate is lower than the bush species, which starts breeding at age 12 and has a calf every 3–4 years.

Baby elephants weigh around at birth. Almost immediately, they can stand up and move around, allowing the mother to roam around and forage, which is also essential to reduce predation. The baby suckles using its mouth while its trunk is held over its head. Their tusks do not come until around 16 months and calves are not weaned until they are roughly 4 or 5 years old. By this time, their tusks are around long and begin to get in the way of suckling.

Forest elephants have a lifespan of about 60 to 70 years and mature slowly, coming to puberty in their early teens. Bulls generally pass puberty within the next year or two of females. Between the ages of 15 and 25, bulls experience &quot;musth&quot;, which is a hormonal state they experience marked by increased aggression. The male secretes fluid from the temporal gland between his ear and eye during this time. Younger bulls often experience musth for a shorter period of time, while older bulls do for a longer time. When in musth, bulls have a more erect walk with their head high and tusks inward, they may rub their heads on trees or bushes to spread the musth scent, and they may even flap their ears, accompanied by a musth rumble, so that their smell can be blown toward other elephants. Another behavior affiliated with musth is urination. Bulls allow their urine to slowly come out and spray the insides of their hind legs. All of these behaviors are to advertise to receptive females and competing bulls that they are in the musth state. Bulls only return to the herd to breed or to socialize; they do not provide prenatal care to their offspring but rather play a fatherly role to younger bulls to show dominance.

Females are polyestrous, meaning they are capable of conceiving multiple times a year, which is a reason why they do not appear to have a breeding season. However, there does appear to be a peak in conceptions during the two rainy seasons of the year. Generally, the female conceives after two or three matings. Though the female has plenty of room in her uterus for twins, twins are rarely conceived. Gestation lasts 22 months. Based on the maturity, fertility, and gestation rates, African forest elephants have the capacity to increase their population by 5% annually under ideal conditions.

== Traditional hunting ==
African forest elephants are hunted by various hunter-gatherer groups in the Congo basin, including by Mbuti pygmies, among others. It is unknown how long the active hunting of elephants in the region has been practised, and it may have only begun as a response for the demand for ivory beginning in the 19th century or earlier. 

Elephants are traditionally hunted using spears, typically to stab at the lower abdomen (as is done among the Mbuti) or knees, both of which are effective at rendering the animal immobile. Anthropologist Mitsuo Ichikawa observed the hunting of elephants by Mbuti pygmies in fieldwork during the 1970s and 1980s, when the Mbuti used spears tipped with metal points (though earlier reports suggest that that prior to this they used purely wooden spears, which may have been less effective at breaking the elephants hide). As observed by Ichikawa, elephant hunting by the Mbuti pygmies involved both small and large groups of hunters, which was led by at least one experienced hunter called a &quot;mtuma.&quot; Before the hunt began, ritual acts of singing and dancing were performed by the community to support the success of the hunt. These hunters often went into the forest without food, living off of wild honey and vegetables, smearing themselves in mud, elephant dung, and charcoal made from certain plants to disguise their scent from the elephants. Once the traces of an elephant are detected, it was carefully tracked, before being approached from downwind and stabbed. It typically took several hours to several days from the first stab to the death of the elephant.

Many hunts failed due to elephants detecting the hunters before being stabbed and fleeing, with field research by Ichikawa finding that only one out of six Mbuti elephant hunts were successful in a six-month period, corresponding to around 60–70 days of total hunting time, meaning that despite the large quantity of meat provided by each individual elephant, it did not provide reliable subsistence, with the Mbuti instead relying on hunting smaller animals. Following the death of the animal, the Mbuti hunters returned to their homes, with the whole community moving to dismember the elephant carcass. Meat was shared equally among the community with the exception of a few body parts which were reserved for certain community members, with the feast on the animals remains lasting for several days. Elephant hunting was a dangerous activity that was known to result in the deaths of hunters.

== Threats ==
Both African elephant species are threatened foremost by habitat loss and habitat fragmentation following conversion of forests for plantations of non-timber crops, livestock farming, and building urban and industrial areas. As a result, human-elephant conflict has increased. Poaching for ivory and bushmeat is a significant threat in Central Africa. Because of a spike in poaching, the African forest elephant was declared Critically Endangered by the IUCN in 2021 after it was found that the population had decreased by more than 80% over 3 generations.

Civil unrest, human encroachment, and habit fragmentation leaves some elephants confined to small patches of forest without sufficient food. In January 2014, International Fund for Animal Welfare undertook a relocation project at the request of the Ivory Coast government, moving four elephants from Daloa to Assagny National Park.

=== Poaching ===

Genetic analysis of confiscated ivory showed that 328 tusks of African forest elephants seized in the Philippines between 1996 and 2005 originated in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo; 2,871 tusks seized in Hong Kong between 2006 and 2013 originated in Tridom, the tri-national Dja-Odzala-Minkébé protected area complex and the adjacent Dzanga Sangha Reserve in the Central African Republic. So did partly worked ivory confiscated between 2013 and 2014 at warehouses in Togo comprising of tusks.
The hard ivory of the African forest elephant makes for more enhanced carving and fetches a higher price on the black market. This preference is evident in Japan, where hard ivory has nearly monopolized the trade for some time. Premium quality bachi, a traditional Japanese plucking tool used for string instruments, is contrived exclusively from African forest elephant tusks. In the impenetrable and often trackless expanses of the rain forests of the Congo Basin, poaching is extremely difficult to detect and track. Levels of off-take, for the most part, are estimated from ivory seizures. The scarcely populated and unprotected forests in Central Africa are most likely becoming increasingly alluring to organized poacher gangs.

Late in the 20th century, conservation workers established a DNA identification system to trace the origin of poached ivory. Due to poaching to meet high demand for ivory, the African forest elephant population approached critical levels in the 1990s and early 2000s. Over several decades, numbers are estimated to have fallen from approximately 700,000 to less than 100,000, with about half of the remaining population in Gabon. In May 2013, Sudanese poachers killed 26 elephants in the Central African Republic&#x27;s Dzanga Bai World Heritage Site. Communications equipment, video cameras, and additional training of park guards were provided following the massacre to improve protection of the site. From mid-April to mid-June 2014, poachers killed 68 elephants in Garamba National Park, including young ones without tusks.

At the request of President Ali Bongo Ondimba, twelve British soldiers traveled to Gabon in 2015 to assist in training park rangers following the poaching of many elephants in Minkebe National Park.

On 19 August 2020, Guyvanho, a poacher who killed over 500 African forest elephants in the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park, was convicted to 30 years in prison for charges of poaching and others. Guyvanho was the first poacher to be tried criminally in the Republic of the Congo, and has the longest prison sentence for a poacher in the Republic of the Congo.

=== Bushmeat trade ===
It is not ivory alone that drives African forest elephant poaching. Killing for bushmeat in Central Africa has evolved into an international business in recent decades with markets reaching New York and other major cities of the United States, and the industry is still on the rise. This illegal market poses the greatest threat not only to forest elephants where hunters can target elephants of all ages, including calves, but to all of the larger species in the forests. There are actions that can be taken to lower the incentive for supplying to the bushmeat market. Regional markets, and international trade, require the transporting of extensive amounts of animal meat which, in turn, requires the utilisation of vehicles. Having checkpoints on major roads and railroads can potentially help disrupt commercial networks. In 2006, it was estimated that 410 African forest elephants are killed yearly in the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests.

== Conservation ==
In 1986, the African Elephant Database was initiated with the aim to monitor the status of African elephant populations. This database includes results from aerial surveys, dung counts, interviews with local people, and data on poaching.

Both African elephant species have been listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora on CITES Appendix I since 1989. This listing banned commercial international trade of wild African elephants and their parts and derivatives by countries that signed the CITES agreement. Populations of Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe were listed in CITES Appendix II in 1997 as was the population of South Africa in 2000. Hunting elephants is banned in the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, and Senegal.

African forest elephants are estimated to constitute up to one-third of the continent&#x27;s elephant population but have been poorly studied because of the difficulty in observing them through the dense vegetation that makes up their habitat. Thermal imaging has facilitated observation of the species, leading to more information on their ecology, numbers, and behavior, including their interactions with elephants and other species. Scientists have learned more about how the elephants, who have poor night vision, negotiate their environment using only their hearing and olfactory senses. They also appeared to be much more active sexually during the night compared to the day, which was unexpected.

<doc id="326182" wikidata="Q617417" url="?curid=326182" title="Isoperimetric inequality">
<text>In mathematics, the isoperimetric inequality is a geometric inequality involving the square of the circumference of a closed curve in the plane and the area of a plane region it encloses, as well as its various generalizations. &quot;&quot; literally means &quot;having the same perimeter&quot;. Specifically, the isoperimetric inequality states, for the length &quot;L&quot; of a closed curve and the area &quot;A&quot; of the planar region that it encloses, that

:formula_1

and that equality holds if and only if the curve is a circle.

The isoperimetric problem is to determine a plane figure of the largest possible area whose boundary has a specified length. The closely related &quot;Dido&#x27;s problem&quot; asks for a region of the maximal area bounded by a straight line and a curvilinear arc whose endpoints belong to that line. It is named after Dido, the legendary founder and first queen of Carthage. The solution to the isoperimetric problem is given by a circle and was known already in Ancient Greece. However, the first mathematically rigorous proof of this fact was obtained only in the 19th century. Since then, many other proofs have been found.

The isoperimetric problem has been extended in multiple ways, for example, to curves on surfaces and to regions in higher-dimensional spaces. Perhaps the most familiar physical manifestation of the 3-dimensional isoperimetric inequality is the shape of a drop of water. Namely, a drop will typically assume a symmetric round shape. Since the amount of water in a drop is fixed, surface tension forces the drop into a shape which minimizes the surface area of the drop, namely a round sphere.

== The isoperimetric problem in the plane ==

The classical &quot;isoperimetric problem&quot; dates back to antiquity. The problem can be stated as follows: Among all closed curves in the plane of fixed perimeter, which curve (if any) maximizes the area of its enclosed region? This question can be shown to be equivalent to the following problem: Among all closed curves in the plane enclosing a fixed area, which curve (if any) minimizes the perimeter?

This problem is conceptually related to the principle of least action in physics, in that it can be restated: what is the principle of action which encloses the greatest area, with the greatest economy of effort? The 15th-century philosopher and scientist, Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, considered rotational action, the process by which a circle is generated, to be the most direct reflection, in the realm of sensory impressions, of the process by which the universe is created. German astronomer and astrologer Johannes Kepler invoked the isoperimetric principle in discussing the morphology of the solar system, in &quot;Mysterium Cosmographicum&quot; (&quot;The Sacred Mystery of the Cosmos&quot;, 1596).

Although the circle appears to be an obvious solution to the problem, proving this fact is rather difficult. The first progress toward the solution was made by Swiss geometer Jakob Steiner in 1838, using a geometric method later named &quot;Steiner symmetrisation&quot;. Steiner showed that if a solution existed, then it must be the circle. Steiner&#x27;s proof was completed later by several other mathematicians.

Steiner begins with some geometric constructions which are easily understood; for example, it can be shown that any closed curve enclosing a region that is not fully convex can be modified to enclose more area, by &quot;flipping&quot; the concave areas so that they become convex. It can further be shown that any closed curve which is not fully symmetrical can be &quot;tilted&quot; so that it encloses more area. The one shape that is perfectly convex and symmetrical is the circle, although this, in itself, does not represent a rigorous proof of the isoperimetric theorem (see external links).

== On a plane ==
The solution to the isoperimetric problem is usually expressed in the form of an inequality that relates the length &quot;L&quot; of a closed curve and the area &quot;A&quot; of the planar region that it encloses. The isoperimetric inequality states that

:formula_1

and that the equality holds if and only if the curve is a circle. The area of a disk of radius &quot;R&quot; is &quot;πR&quot;2 and the circumference of the circle is 2&quot;πR&quot;, so both sides of the inequality are equal to 4&quot;π&quot;2&quot;R&quot;2 in this case.

Dozens of proofs of the isoperimetric inequality have been found. In 1902, Hurwitz published a short proof using the Fourier series that applies to arbitrary rectifiable curves (not assumed to be smooth). An elegant direct proof based on comparison of a smooth simple closed curve with an appropriate circle was given by E. Schmidt in 1938. It uses only the arc length formula, expression for the area of a plane region from Green&#x27;s theorem, and the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.

For a given closed curve, the isoperimetric quotient is defined as the ratio of its area and that of the circle having the same perimeter. This is equal to

:formula_3

and the isoperimetric inequality says that &quot;Q&quot; ≤ 1. Equivalently, the isoperimetric ratio is at least 4 for every curve.

The isoperimetric quotient of a regular &quot;n&quot;-gon is

:formula_4

Let formula_5 be a smooth regular convex closed curve. Then the improved isoperimetric inequality states the following

:formula_6

where formula_7 denote the length of formula_5, the area of the region bounded by formula_5 and the oriented area of the Wigner caustic of formula_5, respectively, and the equality holds if and only if formula_5 is a curve of constant width.

== On a sphere ==

Let &quot;C&quot; be a simple closed curve on a sphere of radius 1. Denote by &quot;L&quot; the length of &quot;C&quot; and by &quot;A&quot; the area enclosed by &quot;C&quot;. The spherical isoperimetric inequality states that

:formula_12

and that the equality holds if and only if the curve is a circle. There are, in fact, two ways to measure the spherical area enclosed by a simple closed curve, but the inequality is symmetric with the respect to taking the complement.

This inequality was discovered by Paul Lévy (1919) who also extended it to higher dimensions and general surfaces.

In the more general case of arbitrary radius &quot;R&quot;, it is known that

:formula_13

== In Euclidean space ==
The isoperimetric inequality states that a sphere has the smallest surface area per given volume. Given a bounded open set formula_14 with formula_15 boundary, having surface area formula_16 and volume formula_17, the isoperimetric inequality states

:formula_18

where formula_19 is a unit ball. The equality holds when formula_20 is a ball in formula_21. Under additional restrictions on the set (such as convexity, regularity, smooth boundary), the equality holds for a ball only. But in full generality the situation is more complicated. The relevant result of (for a simpler proof see ) is clarified in as follows. An extremal set consists of a ball and a &quot;corona&quot; that contributes neither to the volume nor to the surface area. That is, the equality holds for a compact set formula_20 if and only if formula_20 contains a closed ball formula_24 such that formula_25 and formula_26 For example, the &quot;corona&quot; may be a curve.

The proof of the inequality follows directly from Brunn–Minkowski inequality between a set formula_20 and a ball with radius formula_28, i.e. formula_29. By taking Brunn–Minkowski inequality to the power formula_30, subtracting formula_17 from both sides, dividing them by formula_28, and taking the limit as formula_33 (; ).

In full generality , the isoperimetric inequality states that for any set formula_34 whose closure has finite Lebesgue measure

:formula_35

where formula_36 is the (&quot;n&quot;-1)-dimensional Minkowski content, &quot;Ln&quot; is the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Lebesgue measure, and &quot;ωn&quot; is the volume of the unit ball in formula_37. If the boundary of &quot;S&quot; is rectifiable, then the Minkowski content is the (&quot;n&quot;-1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure.

The &quot;n&quot;-dimensional isoperimetric inequality is equivalent (for sufficiently smooth domains) to the Sobolev inequality on formula_37 with optimal constant:

:formula_39

for all formula_40.

== In Hadamard manifolds ==

Hadamard manifolds are complete simply connected manifolds with nonpositive curvature. Thus they generalize the Euclidean space formula_37, which is a Hadamard manifold with curvature zero. In 1970&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s, Thierry Aubin, Misha Gromov, Yuri Burago, and Viktor Zalgaller conjectured that the Euclidean isoperimetric inequality
:formula_42
holds for bounded sets formula_20 in Hadamard manifolds, which has become known as the Cartan–Hadamard conjecture.
In dimension 2 this had already been established in 1926 by André Weil, who was a student of Hadamard at the time.
In dimensions 3 and 4 the conjecture was proved by Bruce Kleiner in 1992, and Chris Croke in 1984 respectively.

==In a metric measure space==

Most of the work on isoperimetric problem has been done in the context of smooth regions in Euclidean spaces, or more generally, in Riemannian manifolds. However, the isoperimetric problem can be formulated in much greater generality, using the notion of &quot;Minkowski content&quot;. Let formula_44 be a &quot;metric measure space&quot;: &quot;X&quot; is a metric space with metric &quot;d&quot;, and &quot;μ&quot; is a Borel measure on &quot;X&quot;. The &quot;boundary measure&quot;, or Minkowski content, of a measurable subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is defined as the lim inf

: formula_45

where

: formula_46

is the ε-&quot;extension&quot; of &quot;A&quot;.

The isoperimetric problem in &quot;X&quot; asks how small can formula_47 be for a given &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;A&quot;). If &quot;X&quot; is the Euclidean plane with the usual distance and the Lebesgue measure then this question generalizes the classical isoperimetric problem to planar regions whose boundary is not necessarily smooth, although the answer turns out to be the same.

The function

:formula_48

is called the &quot;isoperimetric profile&quot; of the metric measure space formula_44. Isoperimetric profiles have been studied for Cayley graphs of discrete groups and for special classes of Riemannian manifolds (where usually only regions &quot;A&quot; with regular boundary are considered).

== For graphs ==

In graph theory, isoperimetric inequalities are at the heart of the study of expander graphs, which are sparse graphs that have strong connectivity properties. Expander constructions have spawned research in pure and applied mathematics, with several applications to complexity theory, design of robust computer networks, and the theory of error-correcting codes.

Isoperimetric inequalities for graphs relate the size of vertex subsets to the size of their boundary, which is usually measured by the number of edges leaving the subset (edge expansion) or by the number of neighbouring vertices (vertex expansion). For a graph formula_50 and a number formula_51, the following are two standard isoperimetric parameters for graphs.

*The edge isoperimetric parameter: formula_52
*The vertex isoperimetric parameter: formula_53

Here formula_54 denotes the set of edges leaving formula_20 and formula_56 denotes the set of vertices that have a neighbour in formula_20. The isoperimetric problem consists of understanding how the parameters formula_58 and formula_59 behave for natural families of graphs.

=== Example: Isoperimetric inequalities for hypercubes ===
The formula_60-dimensional hypercube formula_61 is the graph whose vertices are all Boolean vectors of length formula_60, that is, the set formula_63. Two such vectors are connected by an edge in formula_61 if they are equal up to a single bit flip, that is, their Hamming distance is exactly one.
The following are the isoperimetric inequalities for the Boolean hypercube.

==== Edge isoperimetric inequality ====
The edge isoperimetric inequality of the hypercube is formula_65. This bound is tight, as is witnessed by each set formula_20 that is the set of vertices of any subcube of formula_61.

==== Vertex isoperimetric inequality ====
Harper&#x27;s theorem says that &quot;Hamming balls&quot; have the smallest vertex boundary among all sets of a given size. Hamming balls are sets that contain all points of Hamming weight at most formula_68 and no points of Hamming weight larger than formula_69 for some integer formula_68. This theorem implies that any set formula_71 with

:formula_72

satisfies

:formula_73

As a special case, consider set sizes formula_74 of the form

:formula_75

for some integer formula_68. Then the above implies that the exact vertex isoperimetric parameter is

:formula_77

==Isoperimetric inequality for triangles==

The isoperimetric inequality for triangles in terms of perimeter &quot;p&quot; and area &quot;T&quot; states that

:formula_78

with equality for the equilateral triangle. This is implied, via the AM–GM inequality, by a stronger inequality which has also been called the isoperimetric inequality for triangles:

:formula_79

<doc id="326186" wikidata="Q8813" url="?curid=326186" title="Bolivarianism">
<text>Bolivarianism is a mix of panhispanic, socialist and nationalist-patriotic ideals named after Simón Bolívar, the 19th-century Venezuelan general and liberator from the Spanish monarchy then in abeyance, who led the struggle for independence throughout much of South America.

== Bolivarianism of Hugo Chávez ==
In recent years, Bolivarianism&#x27;s most significant political manifestation was in the government of Venezuela&#x27;s president Hugo Chávez, who from the beginning of his presidency called himself a Bolivarian patriot and applied his interpretation of several of Bolívar&#x27;s ideals to everyday affairs, as part of the Bolivarian Revolution. That included the 1999 Constitution, which changed Venezuela&#x27;s name to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and other ideas such as the Bolivarian Schools, Bolivarian Circles and the Bolivarian University of Venezuela. The term &quot;Bolivarianism&quot; is often used specifically to refer to Chávez&#x27;s rule.

The central points of Bolivarianism as extolled by Chávez are the following:
* Latin American economic and political sovereignty (anti-imperialism)
* Grassroots political participation of the population via popular votes and referendums (participative democracy)
* Economic self-sufficiency (in food, consumer durables and so on)
* Instilling in people a national ethic of patriotic service
* Equitable distribution of (South America&#x27;s) vast natural resources
* Eliminating corruption

Chávez&#x27;s version of Bolivarianism, although drawing heavily from Bolívar&#x27;s ideals, was also drawn from the writings of Marxist historian Federico Brito Figueroa. Chávez was also influenced by the Hispanic American tradition of cooperativism early in his life, such as that practiced by Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and Salvador Allende. Other key influences on Chávez&#x27;s political philosophy include Ezequiel Zamora and Simón Rodríguez. Although Chávez himself referred to his ideology as &quot;bolivarianismo&quot; (&quot;Bolivarianism&quot;), Chávez&#x27;s supporters and opponents in Venezuela refer to themselves as being either for or against &quot;chavismo&quot; (&quot;Chavism&quot;). Chávez supporters refer to themselves as &quot;chavistas&quot;.

== Other definitions and dispute ==
Historically, there has been no universally accepted definition as to the proper use of the terms &quot;Bolivarianism&quot; and &quot;Bolivarian&quot; within all the countries in the region. Many leaders, movements and parties have indistinctly used them to describe themselves throughout most of the 19th and 20th centuries.

=== Panhispanism ===

People who have called themselves &quot;bolivarianos&quot; claim to follow the general ideology expressed in Bolívar&#x27;s texts such as the &quot;Carta de Jamaica&quot; and the &quot;Discurso de Angostura&quot;. Some of Bolívar&#x27;s ideas include forming a union of Hispanic American countries, providing public education and enforcing sovereignty to fight against foreign invasion, which has been interpreted to include economic domination by foreign powers. An example of such a union was Gran Colombia, a block of countries consisting of Venezuela, Colombia, Panama (part of New Granada in that time) and Ecuador.

The Colombian insurgent group FARC has in recent years also considered itself to be inspired by Bolívar&#x27;s ideals and by his role in the 19th century independence struggle against Spain. It has also publicly declared its sympathy towards Chávez and his Bolivarian Revolution, though none of the either confirm or deny any involvement with the insurgent group.

A Venezuelan guerrilla organization, the Bolivarian Forces of Liberation, also espouses Bolivarianism, although it is not known if they have any ties to the Venezuelan government.

===&quot;Chavismo&quot;===

Bolivarianism in Venezuela is also referred to as &quot;Chavismo&quot; or &quot;Chavezism&quot;. Adherents are referred to as &quot;Chavistas&quot;.

Several political parties in Venezuela support &quot;Chavismo&quot;. The main party, directly affiliated with Chávez, is the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which replaced the Fifth Republic Movement (Spanish: &quot;Movimiento Quinta Republica&quot;, usually referred to by the three letters MVR). Other parties and movements supporting &quot;Chavismo&quot; include the Communist Party of Venezuela and Venezuelan Popular Unity.

The Movement for Socialism (Spanish: &quot;Movimiento al Socialismo&quot; or MAS) and Radical Cause (Spanish: &quot;Causa R&quot;) initially supported &quot;Chavismo&quot;, but they have since distanced themselves from it and now oppose it.

A 2002 article in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said &quot;Chavismo&quot; &quot;fueled the eruption of public fury that swept the charismatic and confrontational president back into power after a group of military officers deposed him for two days in April in favor of a businessman-president&quot;, adding that the &quot;&quot;Chavismo&quot; phenomenon has almost religious qualities&quot;.

== Spread ==
Bolivarianism has been adopted in Bolivia and Ecuador. Opposition to the spread of Bolivarian ideal resulted in coups in both Bolivia and Honduras. Afterwards bolivarian aligned governments were democratically elected in Bolivia and Honduras, while defeated in Ecuador.

In 2022, Gustavo Petro won the presidential elections in Colombia, and is considered to be one of the proponents of bolivarianism in South America, as this was the political ideology of the M-19 movement of which he formed part during the 80s, and which became notable for stealing and later returning Bolivar&#x27;s alleged sword.
Aspects of Bolivarianism were adapted by the Spanish political party Podemos.

<doc id="326192" wikidata="Q1390838" url="?curid=326192" title="Isaac Pitman">
<text>Sir Isaac Pitman (4 January 1813 – 22 January 1897) was an English publisher and teacher of the :English language who developed the most widely used system of shorthand, known now as Pitman shorthand. He first proposed this in &quot;Stenographic Soundhand&quot; in 1837. He was vice-president of the Vegetarian Society. Pitman was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1894.

== Background ==
Pitman was born in Trowbridge, Wiltshire in England. One of his cousins was Abraham Laverton. In 1831 he had five months&#x27; training at the Training College of the British and Foreign School Society, which was sufficient to qualify him as a teacher. He started teaching at Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire. In 1835 he married a widow, and moved in 1836 to Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, where he started his own school. In 1839 he moved to Bath, where he opened a small school.

In the 1851 census he appears in Bath aged 38, living with his wife, Mary, aged 58, born in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire. He married Isabella Masters in 1861, and he appears in the 1871 census, aged 58, with his new wife Isabella, aged 46.

== Spelling reform and shorthand ==
Pitman was a lifelong advocate of spelling reform for the English language, producing many pamphlets during his lifetime on spelling reform. His motto was &quot;time saved is life gained.&quot;

One of the outcomes of his interest in spelling reform was the creation of his system of phonetic shorthand which he first published in 1837, in a pamphlet titled &quot;Sound-Hand&quot;. Among the examples in this pamphlet, were Psalm 100, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, and Emanuel Swedenborg&#x27;s &quot;Rules of Life&quot;. By 1843, his business of preparing and publishing had expanded sufficiently for him to give up teaching and to set up his own printing press, as well as compositing and binding. In 1844, he published &quot;Phonotypy&quot;, his major work on spelling reform. In 1845 he published the first version of the &quot;English Phonotypic Alphabet&quot;.

In the 1881 census, his name was spelled phonetically as Eisak Pitman. In the 1891 census he was again listed as Isaac, but his birthplace was changed to Bath.

== Publishing ==
In 1886, Pitman went into partnership with his sons Alfred and Ernest to form Isaac Pitman and Sons, later Sir Isaac Pitman and Sons.

In the same year the millionth copy of the Phonographic Teacher was sold in Great Britain. Isaac Pitman and Sons was to become one of the world&#x27;s leading educational publishers and training businesses with offices in London, Bath, New York City, Melbourne, Johannesburg, Toronto and Tokyo. The publishing division, Pitman Ltd, was bought by rival Pearson Plc in 1985. The training business evolved into two separate businesses: Pitman Training Group and JHP Training (now learndirect).

== Distance learning ==

The first distance education course in the modern sense was provided by Sir Isaac Pitman in the 1840s, who taught a system of shorthand by mailing texts transcribed into shorthand on postcards and receiving transcriptions from his students in return for correction. The element of student feedback was a crucial innovation of Pitman&#x27;s system. This scheme was made possible by the introduction of uniform postage rates across Britain in 1840.

== Personal life ==
Isaac Pitman was fervently Swedenborgian. Not only did he read &quot;The Writings&quot; of Emanuel Swedenborg daily, he also devoted much time and energy to educating the world about them. He published and distributed books and tracts by and about Swedenborg. Among the authors he encouraged was Thomas Child.

Pitman was active in the local New Church congregation in Bath while living on Royal Crescent. He was one of the founding members, when this congregation was formed in 1841. He served as president of this society from 1887 to his death in 1897. His contribution to this church was honoured by the congregation with a stained glass window depicting the golden cherub in the temple of wisdom described in Swedenborg&#x27;s &quot;True Christian Religion&quot; No. 508. The window was dedicated on 5 September 1909.

His memorial plaque on the north wall of Bath Abbey reads, &quot;His aims were steadfast, his mind original, his work prodigious, the achievement world-wide. His life was ordered in service to God and duty to man.&quot;

Pitman was the grandfather of James Pitman, who developed the Initial Teaching Alphabet. His grand-daughter, Honor Isabel Salmon (b.1912, née Pitman) was killed while piloting an Airspeed Oxford for the Air Transport Auxiliary in 1943. 

His great-grandson John Hugh Pitman was appointed an OBE in 2010 for services to vocational training.

==Vegetarianism==

In 1837, at the age of 34, Pitman discontinued the use of all alcoholic beverages and became a vegetarian, both lifelong practices. He also did not smoke.

Pitman advocated a simple vegetarian diet. He was Vice-President of the Vegetarian Society. In an 1879 letter to &quot;The Times&quot; (London), he attributed his excellent health and his ability to work long hours to his vegetarian diet and abstinence from alcohol. He commented that &quot;I attribute my health and power of endurance to abstinence from flesh meat and alcoholic drinks. I can come to no other conclusion when I see the effect of such extended hours of labour on other men who eat meat and drink wine or beer&quot;. His brother Benjamin noted that Pitman &quot;became a vegetarian, not for religious, but humanitarian and physiological reasons.&quot;

The Pitman Vegetarian Hotel was named after Pitman.

<doc id="326193" wikidata="Q10820138" url="?curid=326193" title="Solenodon">
<text>Solenodons (from , &#x27;channel&#x27; or &#x27;pipe&#x27; and , &#x27;tooth&#x27;) are venomous, nocturnal, burrowing, insectivorous mammals belonging to the family Solenodontidae . The two living solenodon species are the Cuban solenodon (&quot;Atopogale cubana&quot;) and the Hispaniolan solenodon (&quot;Solenodon paradoxus&quot;). Threats to both species include habitat destruction and predation by non-native cats, dogs, and mongooses, introduced by humans to the solenodons&#x27; home islands to control snakes and rodents.

The Hispaniolan solenodon covers a wide range of habitats on the island of Hispaniola from lowland dry forest to highland pine forest. Two other described species became extinct during the Quaternary period. Oligocene North American genera, such as &quot;Apternodus&quot;, have been suggested as relatives of &quot;Solenodon&quot;, but the origins of the animal remain obscure.

== Taxonomy ==
Two genera, &quot;Atopogale&quot; and &quot;Solenodon&quot;, are known, each with one extant species. Other genera have been erected, but are now regarded as junior synonyms. Solenodontidae show retention of primitive mammal characteristics. In 2016, solenodons were confirmed by genetic analysis as belonging to an evolutionary branch that split from the lineage leading to hedgehogs, moles, and shrews before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. They are one of two families of Caribbean soricomorphs. The other family, Nesophontidae, became extinct during the Holocene. Molecular data suggest they diverged from solenodons roughly 57 million years ago. The solenodon is estimated to have diverged from other living mammals about 73 million years ago.

=== Extant species ===

In addition, 2 extinct species, the giant solenodon (&quot;S. arredondoi&quot;) and Marcano&#x27;s solenodon (&quot;S. marcanoi&quot;) are both thought to have gone extinct during the last 500 years, both presumably due to predation by introduced rats.

==Characteristics==
Traditionally, solenodons&#x27; closest relatives were considered to be the giant water shrew of Africa and Tenrecidae of Madagascar, though they are now known to be more closely related to true shrews (Eulipotyphla). Solenodons resemble very large shrews, and are often compared to them; with extremely elongated cartilaginous snouts, long, naked, scaly tails, hairless feet, and small eyes. The Cuban solenodon is generally smaller than its Hispaniolan counterpart. It is also a rusty brown with black on its throat and back. The Hispaniolan solenodon is a darker brown with yellowish tint to the face. The snout is flexible and, in the Hispaniolan solenodon, actually has a ball-and-socket joint at the base to increase its mobility. This allows the animal to investigate narrow crevices where potential prey may be hiding.

Solenodons are also noted for the glands in their inguinal and groin areas that secrete what is described as a musky, goat-like odor. Solenodons range from from nose to rump, and weigh between .

Solenodons have a few unusual traits, one of them being the position of the two teats on the female, almost on the buttocks of the animal, and another being the venomous saliva that flows from modified salivary glands in the mandible through grooves on the second lower incisors (&quot;solenodon&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;grooved tooth&quot;). Solenodons are among a handful of venomous mammals. Fossil records show that some other now-extinct mammal groups also had the dental venom delivery system, indicating that the solenodon&#x27;s most distinct characteristic may have been a more general ancient mammalian characteristic that has been lost in most modern mammals and is only retained in a couple of very ancient lineages. The solenodon has often been called a &quot;living fossil&quot; because it has endured virtually unchanged for the past 76 million years.

It is not known exactly how long solenodons can live in the wild. However, certain individuals of the Cuban species have been recorded to have lived for up to five years in captivity and individuals of the Hispaniolan species for up to eleven years.

West Indian natives have long known about the venomous character of the solenodon bite. Early studies on the nature of the tiny mammal&#x27;s saliva suggested that it was very similar to the neurotoxic venom of certain snakes. More recently, the venom has been found to be related to that of the northern short-tailed shrew and it is mostly composed of kallikreins &quot;KLK1&quot;, serine proteases that prevent blood clotting, cause hypotension and ultimately end up being fatal to the prey. The KLK1 in solenodon venom is very similar to serine protease found in venomous snakes like vipers, and has evolved in parallel in both lineages from an ancient toxin precursor. Solenodons create venom in enlarged submaxillary glands, and only inject venom through their bottom set of teeth. The symptoms of a solenodon bite include general depression, breathing difficulty, paralysis, and convulsions; large enough doses have resulted in death in lab studies on mice.

Their diets consist largely of insects, earthworms, and other invertebrates, but they also eat vertebrate carrion, and perhaps even some living vertebrate prey, such as small reptiles or amphibians. They have also been known to feed on fruits, roots, and vegetables. Based on observation of the solenodon in captivity, they have only been known to drink while bathing. Solenodons have a relatively unspecialised, and almost complete dentition, with a dental formula of: .

Solenodons find food by sniffing the ground until they come upon their prey. If the prey is small enough, the solenodon will consume it immediately. After coming across the prey, the solenodon will bring the forelimbs up to either side of the prey and then move the head forward, opening the jaw and properly catching its prey. While sniffing for food, the solenodon can get through physical barriers with the help of its sharp claws.
There has been research that suggests that males and females of the two species have different eating habits. The female has a habit of scattering the food to make sure that no morsel of food is missed as it is foraging. The male was noted to use its tongue to lap up the food and using the lower jaw as a scoop. However, these specimens were studied in captivity, so these habits may not be found in the wild.

==Reproduction==
Solenodons give birth in a nesting burrow to one or two young. The young remain with the mother for several months and initially follow the mother by hanging on to her elongated teats. Once they reach adulthood solenodons are solitary animals and rarely interact except to breed.

The reproductive rate of solenodons is relatively low, producing only two litters per year. Breeding can occur at any time. Males will not aid in the care for the young. The mother will nurse her offspring using her two nipples, which are placed toward the back of the animal. If the litter consists of three offspring, one will become malnourished and die. The nursing period can last for up to seventy-five days.

In their nesting burrows, solenodons give birth to one or two pups, displaying a distinctive reproductive behavior. For several months, the mother tends to them, and the young follow her, clinging on lengthy teats. Breeding can take place at any time, with a comparatively low reproductive rate of two litters annually, and males do not participate in the upbringing of their offspring. Up to 75 days of breastfeeding are dedicated to showcasing the interesting function that mothers play in solenodon reproduction.

==Behavior==
Solenodons make their homes in bushy areas in forests. During the daytime they seek refuge in caves, burrows, or hollow logs. They are easily provoked and can fly into a frenzy of squealing and biting with no warning. They run and climb quite fast, despite only ever touching the ground with toes. Solenodons are said to give off grunts similar to that of a pig or bird-call when feeling threatened.

Solenodons generate clicking noises similar to those of shews; the sound waves bounce off objects in their vicinity. This form of echolocation helps a solenodon navigate as well as find food. This well developed auditory ability combined with its above average sense of smell helps the solenodon survive despite its extremely small eyes and poor vision.

Solenodons have been described as both omnivorous and insectivorous. Their natural diet largely consists of insects including ants and roaches, grubs, vegetation, and fruit. However, they have also been observed to eat small vertebrates like mice and chicks, meat of large animals, as well as animal products such as eggs and milk, when fed these food items in captivity.

==Status==
===Cuba===
The Cuban solenodon is considered Endangered due to predation by the small Indian mongoose (&quot;Urva auropunctata&quot;), which was introduced in colonial times to hunt snakes and rats, as well as by feral cats and dogs. The Cuban solenodon was thought to have been extinct until a live specimen was found in 2003.

===Haiti===
The Hispaniolan solenodon was also once thought to be extinct, more due to its secretive and elusive behavior than to low population numbers. Recent studies have proven that the species is widely distributed through the island of Hispaniola, but it does not tolerate habitat degradation. A 1981 study of the Hispaniolan solenodon in Haiti found that the species was &quot;functionally extinct&quot;, with the exception of a small population in the area of Massif de la Hotte. A follow-up study, in 2007, noted that the solenodon was still thriving in the area, even though the region has had an increase in human population density in recent years.

===Dominican Republic===
The Sierra de Bahoruco, a mountain range in the southwest of the Dominican Republic that straddles the border with Haiti, was examined by conservation teams looking for solenodons. The work occurred during the day when the animals were asleep in burrows so that they could be viewed with an infrared camera. When researchers search for solenodons in daylight, they look for the following clues to their presence:
* nearby nose-poke holes that the creatures make in the ground with their long noses to probe the earth, as they look for insects they can hunt and eat. After a relatively long period of time they will be covered in leaves, but a fresh hole will be covered in moist soil.
* nearby scratches in logs that were made with their long claws.
* a strong musty goat-like smell seeping out of a burrow. The pungent odor indicates that the burrow is active, and a solenodon may be present sleeping.

A solenodon was captured in 2008 during a month-long expedition in the Dominican Republic, thereby allowing researchers the rare opportunity to examine it in daylight. The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Ornithological Society of Hispaniola were able to take measurements and DNA from the creature before it was released. It was the only trapping made from the entire month-long expedition. The new information gathered was significant because little information was known about the solenodon&#x27;s ecology, behavior, population status, and genetics, and without that knowledge it is difficult for researchers to design effective conservation. In a 2020 assessment from the IUCN, the Hispaniolan solenodon was found to be much more common on Hispaniola than previously thought, warranting its downlisting from &quot;Endangered&quot; to a &quot;Least Concern&quot; species.

==Conservation==
After the arrival of Europeans to the Caribbean, the existence of both species of solenodon has been threatened by introduced species, like dogs, cats, rats, and mongooses, as well as more dense human settlement. These factors were possibly the catalyst for the relatively recent extinction of two species, the giant solenodon (&quot;S. arredondoi&quot;) and the Marcano&#x27;s solenodon (&quot;S. marcanoi&quot;). Native snakes and birds of prey are also threats. 

Solenodons have no known negative effects on human populations; in fact, they serve as both pest control, helping ecosystems by keeping down the population of invertebrates, and a means of spreading fruit seeds. Human activity has also had an adverse effect on the solenodon population. Human development on both Cuba and Hispaniola has resulted in fragmentation and habitat loss, further contributing to the reduction of the solenodon&#x27;s range and numbers.

<text>Psilocybin mushrooms, or psilocybin-containing mushrooms, commonly known as magic mushrooms or as shrooms, are a type of hallucinogenic mushroom and a polyphyletic informal group of fungi that contain the psilocybin, which turns into the psychedelic psilocin upon ingestion. The most potent species are members of genus &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, such as &quot;P. azurescens&quot;, &quot;P. semilanceata&quot;, and &quot;P. cyanescens&quot;, but psilocybin has also been isolated from approximately a dozen other genera, including &quot;Panaeolus&quot; (including &quot;Copelandia&quot;), &quot;Inocybe&quot;, &quot;Pluteus&quot;, &quot;Gymnopilus&quot;, and &quot;Pholiotina&quot;.

Amongst other cultural applications, psilocybin mushrooms are used as recreational drugs. They may be depicted in Stone Age rock art in Africa and Europe, but are more certainly represented in sculptures and glyphs seen throughout the Americas.

==History==
Psilocybin mushrooms have been and continue to be used in Mexican and Central American cultures in religious, divinatory, or spiritual contexts.

===Early===
Rock art from from Tassili, Algeria, is believed to depict psychedelic mushrooms and the transformation of the user under their influence. Prehistoric rock art near Villar del Humo in Spain suggests that &quot;Psilocybe hispanica&quot; was used in religious rituals 6,000 years ago. The hallucinogenic species of the Psilocybe genus have a history of use among the native peoples of Mesoamerica for religious communion, divination, and healing, from pre-Columbian times to the present day. Mushroom stones and motifs have been found in Guatemala. A statuette dating from depicting a mushroom strongly resembling &quot;Psilocybe mexicana&quot; was found in the west Mexican state of Colima in a shaft and chamber tomb. A &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species known to the Aztecs as &quot;teōnanācatl&quot; (literally &quot;divine mushroom&quot;: the agglutinative form of &quot;teōtl&quot; (god, sacred) and &quot;nanācatl&quot; (mushroom) in Nahuatl language) was reportedly served at the coronation of the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II in 1502. Aztecs and Mazatecs referred to psilocybin mushrooms as genius mushrooms, divinatory mushrooms, and wondrous mushrooms when translated into English. Bernardino de Sahagún reported the ritualistic use of &quot;teonanácatl&quot; by the Aztecs when he traveled to Central America after the expedition of Hernán Cortés.

After the Spanish conquest, Catholic missionaries campaigned against the cultural tradition of the Aztecs, dismissing the Aztecs as idolaters, and the use of hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms, together with other pre-Christian traditions, was quickly suppressed. The Spanish believed the mushroom allowed the Aztecs and others to communicate with demons. Despite this history, the use of &quot;teonanácatl&quot; has persisted in some remote areas.

===Modern===
The first mention of hallucinogenic mushrooms in European medicinal literature was in the London Medical and Physical Journal in 1799: A man served &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot; mushrooms he had picked for breakfast in London&#x27;s Green Park to his family. The apothecary who treated them later described how the youngest child &quot;was attacked with fits of immoderate laughter, nor could the threats of his father or mother refrain him.&quot;

In 1955, Valentina Pavlovna Wasson and R. Gordon Wasson became the first known European Americans to actively participate in an indigenous mushroom ceremony. The Wassons did much to publicize their experience, even publishing an article on their experiences in &quot;Life&quot; on May 13, 1957. In 1956, Roger Heim identified the psychoactive mushroom the Wassons brought back from Mexico as &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, and in 1958, Albert Hofmann first identified psilocybin and psilocin as the active compounds in these mushrooms.

Inspired by the Wassons&#x27; &quot;Life&quot; article, Timothy Leary traveled to Mexico to experience psilocybin mushrooms himself. When he returned to Harvard in 1960, he and Richard Alpert started the Harvard Psilocybin Project, promoting psychological and religious studies of psilocybin and other psychedelic drugs. Alpert and Leary sought to conduct research with psilocybin on prisoners in the 1960s, testing its effects on recidivism. This experiment reviewed the subjects six months later, and found that the recidivism rate had decreased beyond their expectation, below 40%. This, and another experiment administering psilocybin to graduate divinity students, showed controversy. Shortly after Leary and Alpert were dismissed from their jobs by Harvard in 1963, they turned their attention toward promoting the psychedelic experience to the nascent hippie counterculture.

The popularization of entheogens by the Wassons, Leary, Terence McKenna, Robert Anton Wilson, and many others led to an explosion in the use of psilocybin mushrooms throughout the world. By the early 1970s, many psilocybin mushroom species were described from temperate North America, Europe, and Asia and were widely collected. Books describing methods of cultivating large quantities of &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; were also published. The availability of psilocybin mushrooms from wild and cultivated sources has made them one of the most widely used psychedelic drugs.

At present, psilocybin mushroom use has been reported among some groups spanning from central Mexico to Oaxaca, including groups of Nahua, Mixtecs, Mixe, Mazatecs, Zapotecs, and others. An important figure of mushroom usage in Mexico was María Sabina, who used native mushrooms, such as &quot;Psilocybe mexicana&quot; in her practice.

==Occurrence==

In a 2000 review on the worldwide distribution of psilocybin mushrooms, Gastón Guzmán and colleagues considered these distributed among the following genera: &quot;Psilocybe&quot; (116 species), &quot;Gymnopilus&quot; (14), &quot;Panaeolus&quot; (13), &quot;Copelandia&quot; (12), &quot;Pluteus&quot; (6) &quot;Inocybe&quot; (6), &quot;Pholiotina&quot; (4) and &quot;Galerina&quot; (1). Guzmán increased his estimate of the number of psilocybin-containing &quot;Psilocybe&quot; to 144 species in a 2005 review.

Many of them are found in Mexico (53 species), with the remainder distributed throughout Canada and the US (22), Europe (16), Asia (15), Africa (4), and Australia and associated islands (19). Generally, psilocybin-containing species are dark-spored, gilled mushrooms that grow in meadows and woods in the subtropics and tropics, usually in soils rich in humus and plant debris. Psilocybin mushrooms occur on all continents, but the majority of species are found in subtropical humid forests. &quot;P. cubensis&quot; is the most common &quot;Psilocybe&quot; in tropical areas. &quot;P. semilanceata&quot;, considered the world&#x27;s most widely distributed psilocybin mushroom, is found in temperate parts of Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Australia and New Zealand, although it is absent from Mexico.

Some bolete mushrooms, which are not closely related to any known psilocybin-containing mushroom species, have been reported to be hallucinogenic mushrooms, for instance in the Yunnan province in China. The exact species as well specific active compounds in these mushrooms are not known, although unidentified indolic compounds were detected by Albert Hofmann in some boletes such as &quot;Boletus manicus&quot;.

==Composition==
Magic mushroom composition varies from genus to genus and species to species. Its principal component is psilocybin, which is converted into psilocin to produce psychoactive effects. Besides psilocin, norpsilocin, baeocystin, norbaeocystin, and aeruginascin may also be present, which might result in an entourage effect and modify the effects of magic mushrooms. Animal studies suggest that the effects of pure psilocybin or psilocin and psilocybin mushrooms may be different and support the possibility of such an entourage effect with psilocybin mushrooms. &quot;Panaeolus subbalteatus&quot;, one species of magic mushroom, had the highest amount of psilocybin compared to the rest of the fruiting body.

Certain mushrooms are found to produce β-carbolines, such as harmine, harmane, tetrahydroharmine (THH), and harmaline, which inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme that breaks down tryptamine alkaloids, and have other actions. They occur in different genera, such as &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, &quot;Cyclocybe&quot;, and &quot;Hygrophorus&quot;. Harmine, harmane, norharmane, and a range of other β-carbolines were discovered in &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species. β-Carbolines in psilocybin mushrooms may inhibit the metabolism of psilocybin and other constituents and thereby potentiate their effects.

==Effects==

The effects of psilocybin mushrooms come from psilocybin and psilocin. When psilocybin is ingested, it is broken down by the liver in a process called dephosphorylation. The resulting compound is called psilocin, responsible for the psychedelic effects. Psilocybin and psilocin create short-term increases in tolerance of users, thus making it difficult to misuse them because the more often they are taken within a short period, the weaker the resultant effects are. Psilocybin mushrooms have not been known to cause physical or psychological dependence (addiction). The psychedelic effects appear around 20 minutes after ingestion and can last up to 6 hours. Physical effects may occur, including nausea, vomiting, euphoria, muscle weakness or relaxation, drowsiness, and lack of coordination.

As with many psychedelic substances, the effects of psychedelic mushrooms are subjective and can vary considerably among individual users. The mind-altering effects of psilocybin-containing mushrooms typically last from three to eight hours, depending on dosage, preparation method, and personal metabolism. The first 3–4 hours after ingestion are typically referred to as the &#x27;peak&#x27;—in which the user experiences more vivid visuals and distortions in reality. The effects can seem to last much longer for the user because of psilocybin&#x27;s ability to alter time perception.

===Sensory===
Sensory effects include visual and auditory hallucinations followed by emotional changes and altered perception of time and space. Noticeable changes to the auditory, visual, and tactile senses may become apparent around 30 minutes to an hour after ingestion, although effects may take up to two hours to take place. These shifts in perception visually include enhancement and contrasting of colors, strange light phenomena (such as auras or &quot;halos&quot; around light sources), increased visual acuity, surfaces that seem to ripple, shimmer, or breathe; complex open and closed eye visuals of form constants or images, objects that warp, morph, or change solid colors; a sense of melting into the environment, and trails behind moving objects. Sounds may seem to have increased clarity—music, for example, can take on a profound sense of cadence and depth. Some users experience synesthesia, wherein they perceive, for example, a visualization of color upon hearing a particular sound.

===Emotional===
As with other psychedelics such as LSD, the experience, or &#x27;trip,&#x27; is strongly dependent upon set and setting. Hilarity, lack of concentration, and muscular relaxation (including dilated pupils) are all normal effects, sometimes in the same trip. A negative environment could contribute to a bad trip, whereas a comfortable and familiar environment would set the stage for a pleasant experience. Psychedelics make experiences more intense, so if a person enters a trip in an anxious state of mind, they will likely experience heightened anxiety on their trip. Many users find it preferable to ingest the mushrooms with friends or people familiar with &#x27;tripping.&#x27; The psychological consequences of psilocybin use include hallucinations and an inability to discern fantasy from reality. Panic reactions and psychosis also may occur, particularly if a user ingests a large dose.

==Dosage==
The dosage of psilocybin-containing mushrooms depends on the psilocybin and psilocin content, which can vary significantly between and within the same species. Psilocybin content is typically around 0.5% to 1% of the dried weight of the mushroom, with a range of 0.03% to 1.78%. Psilocin is also often present in the mushrooms, with a range of 0% to 0.59%, and can be on par with or an order of magnitude lower than psilocybin levels. &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot;, the most popular species, has been reported to contain 0.63% psilocybin and 0.6% psilocin, or about 1.2% of psilocybin and psilocin combined. However, there is significant variation in different &quot;P. cubensis&quot; strains. The &#x27;Penis Envy&#x27; strain of &quot;P. cubensis&quot; is considered to be more potent than other strains. Psilocybin levels appear to be highest in &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; and/or &quot;P. azurescens&quot;.

Recreational doses of psilocybin mushrooms are typically between 1.0 to 3.5–5.0g of dry mushrooms and 10 to 50g of fresh mushrooms. This corresponds to a dosage of psilocybin of about 10 to 50mg. Usual doses of the common species &quot;P. cubensis&quot; range around 1.0 to 2.5g, while about 2.5 to 5.0g dried mushroom material is considered a strong dose and above 5.0g is considered a heavy dose. A 5.0g dose of dried mushroom is often referred to as a &quot;heroic dose&quot;. In terms of psilocybin dosing, subthreshold or microdoses are &lt;2.5mg, low doses are 5 to 10mg, the intermediate or &quot;good effect&quot; dose is 20mg, and high or ego-dissolution doses are 30 to 40mg. A 20mg dose of psilocybin is equivalent to about 100μg LSD or about 500mg mescaline. With regard to psilocybin and psilocin equivalence, psilocin is about 1.4-fold more potent than psilocybin (i.e., 1.4mg psilocybin equals about 1.0mg psilocin).

Microdosing has become a popular technique for many users, which involves taking &lt;1.0g of dried mushrooms for an experience that is not as intense or powerful, but recreationally enjoyable, or fully non-hallucinogenic, and potentially alleviating for symptoms of depression. A microdose of psilocybin mushrooms is about 10% of a recreational dose, and may be 0.1 to 0.3g of dry mushrooms, taken up to three times per week.

==Toxicology==
The species within the most commonly foraged and ingested genus of psilocybin mushrooms, the psilocybe, contains two primary hallucinogenic toxins; psilocybin and psilocin. The median lethal dose, also known as &quot;LD50&quot;, of psilocybin is 280 mg/kg.

From a toxicological profile, it would be incredibly difficult to overdose on psilocybin mushrooms, given their primary toxin compounds. To consume such massive amounts of psilocybin, one must ingest more than of dried &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; given 1-2% of the dried mushroom contains psilocybin.

Posing a more realistic threat than a lethal overdose, significantly elevated levels of psilocin can overstimulate the 5-HT2A receptors in the brain, causing acute serotonin syndrome. A 2015 study observed that a dose of 200 mg/kg psilocin induced symptoms of acute serotonin poisoning in mice.

Neurotoxicity-induced fatal events are uncommon with psilocybin mushroom overdose, as most patients admitted to critical care are released from the department only requiring moderate treatment. However, fatal events related to emotional distress and trip-induced psychosis can occur as a result of over-consumption of psilocybin mushrooms. In 2003, a 27-year-old man was found dead in an irrigation canal due to hypothermia. In his bedroom was found two cultivation pots of psilocybin mushrooms, but no report of toxicology was made.

== Clinical research ==
Due partly to restrictions of the Controlled Substances Act, research in the United States was limited until the early 21st century when psilocybin mushrooms were tested for their potential to treat drug dependence, anxiety and mood disorders. In 2018–19, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for studies of psilocybin in depressive disorders.

==Legality==
The legality of the cultivation, possession, and sale of psilocybin mushrooms and psilocybin and psilocin varies from country to country.

After Oregon Measure 109, in 2020, Oregon became the first US state to decriminalize psilocybin and legalize it for therapeutic use. However, selling psilocybin without being licensed may still attract fines or imprisonment. In 2022 Colorado legalized consumption, growing, and sharing for personal use, though sales are prohibited while regulations are being drafted. Other jurisdictions in the United States where psilocybin mushrooms are decriminalized include Ann Arbor and Detroit, Michigan; Oakland and Santa Cruz, California; Easthampton, Somerville, Northampton, and Cambridge, Massachusetts; Seattle, Washington; and Washington, DC.

Furthermore, buying spores of mushroom species containing psilocybin online in the United States is legal in all states except Georgia, Idaho and California. This is because only fruiting mushrooms and mycelium contain psilocybin, a federally banned substance. A technical caveat to consider, however, is that the distributed spores must not be intended to be used for cultivation, but allowed for microscopy purposes.

===United Nations===

Internationally, mescaline, DMT, and psilocin, are Schedule I drugs under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes, however, that the plants containing them are not subject to international control:

<text>Susan Augusta Fenimore Cooper (April 17, 1813 December 31, 1894) was an American writer and amateur naturalist. She founded an orphanage in Cooperstown, New York and made it a successful charity. The daughter of writer James Fenimore Cooper, she served as his secretary and amanuensis late in his life.

==Early life, education and charity work==

Susan Fenimore Cooper was born in 1813 in Scarsdale, New York, the daughter of the novelist James Fenimore Cooper and his wife Susan Augusta DeLancey. She was his second child, and the eldest to survive her youth. As a child, Cooper studied in European schools when she traveled with her family to live there. She sometimes travelled with her father and assisted in documenting and organizing his notes. Much of her life was devoted to him, and he encouraged her practice of art and writing. She also published a great deal herself.

In 1868, Cooper was one of the founding members of Thanksgiving Hospital.

In 1873, she founded an orphanage in Cooperstown, New York, the town founded by her paternal grandfather William Cooper and where she and her family had lived most of her adult life. Under her superintendence the orphanage became a prosperous charitable institution. It was begun in a modest house in a small way with five pupils; in 1900 the building, which was erected in 1883, sheltered ninety boys and girls. The orphans were taken when quite young, were fed, clothed, and given a basic education. When they were old enough, they were helped to find positions in “good Christian families.” Some of them before leaving were taught to earn their own living.

In 1886, Cooper established The Friendly Society. Every woman on becoming a member of the Society chose one of the girls in the orphanage to give individual attention.

During the later years of her father&#x27;s life, she became his secretary and amanuensis, and but for her father&#x27;s prohibition would probably have become his biographer.

==Authorship==
Cooper was a writer who published on diverse subjects, but she is best remembered as a nature writer. She kept a diary that formed the basis of her second book, &quot;Rural Hours&quot; (1850), published anonymously as &quot;by a lady&quot; and offering a sharp-eyed account of rural life in New York. Cooper wrote many more essays, and edited two more volumes, on country life, but &quot;Rural Hours&quot; was the most successful, going through nine editions over the course of nearly forty years; it then appeared in 1887 in a severely abridged form (40% of the text is cut), in spite of Cooper&#x27;s desire that it remain in its full form. &quot;Rural Hours&quot; was a remarkable accomplishment for Cooper because when it was published not many women wrote about natural history. It wasn&#x27;t until the late 19th century when women&#x27;s natural history writing took off. What set &quot;Rural Hours&quot; apart from the previous books written by her father and grandfather was Susan&#x27;s remarkable attention to detail and accuracy in natural historical observations, and explicit call for preservation of the Otsego forests. Its noteworthy that this prescient call for forest preservation was published four years prior to Walden, 14 years prior to George Perkins Marsh&#x27;s man and nature; or Physical geography as modified by human action (1864), two books recognized as among the earliest call for the preservation of American forests. Cooper also wrote an essay in the form of a letter about women&#x27;s suffrage and a novel, &quot;Elinor Wyllys&quot;.

In recent years, beginning with the 1998 republication of &quot;Rural Hours&quot;, Cooper has begun to achieve recognition as a significant writer in her own right. &quot;Rural Hours&quot; in particular has been called the &quot;first major work of environmental literary nonfiction by an American woman writer, both a source and a rival of Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot;.&quot; This book went through six editions and the last one was published in 1887; it was formed through a daily diary kept by Cooper and included lengthy discussions of nature, drawings of birds native to her dwelling area as well as flowers and other plants. Both Susan and her works were unique for their time; this book was nearly scientific with its descriptive details of the specimens she studied, both visually and lingually. She had a basic knowledge of botany and spent a significant amount of her life in charitable pursuits.

Although Cooper was considered an amateur, &quot;Rural Hours&quot; caught the eye of scientist Charles Darwin and author Henry David Thoreau. In a letter to Asa Gray, Darwin wrote “Talking of books, I am in middle of one which pleases me...’Miss Cooper’s Journal of a Naturalist.’ Who is she? She seems a very clever woman &amp; gives a capital account of the battle between our &amp; your weeds”.

According to a journal kept by Henry David Thoreau, he read part of &quot;Rural Hours&quot; and circumstantial evidence suggests that some of the most memorable passages from Thoreau&#x27;s 1854 book &quot;Walden&quot; may have been suggested by several of Cooper&#x27;s own passages on loons, wild berries, the perceived bottomlessness of the lake, and the seasonal breaking of the ice.

==Artwork==
Cooper showed great interest in art and studied it in Europe. While some writers today, such as Jack Kramer, claim that the plates in illustrated edition of Rural Hours were by Cooper, no evidence to that effect remains.

==Personal life==
The home she and her sister shared was built mainly with bricks and materials from the ruins of Otsego Hall in Cooperstown, which her paternal grandfather had built and where her parents had also lived. Cooper never married or raised a family of her own but was able to become an accomplished naturalist of her time, despite the lack of opportunity for women to publish written works or art pieces during this time. She died in her sleep, age 81, in Cooperstown.

<doc id="326212" wikidata="Q1060201" url="?curid=326212" title="Ritual purification">
<text>Ritual purification is a ritual prescribed by a religion through which a person is considered to be freed of &quot;uncleanliness&quot;, especially prior to the worship of a deity, and ritual purity is a state of ritual cleanliness. Ritual purification may also apply to objects and places. Ritual uncleanliness is not identical with ordinary physical impurity, such as dirt stains; nevertheless, body fluids are generally considered ritually unclean.

Most of these rituals existed long before the germ theory of disease, and figure prominently from the earliest known religious systems of the Ancient Near East. Some writers connect the rituals to taboos.

Some have seen benefits of these practices as a point of health and preventing infections especially in areas where humans come in close contact with each other. While these practices came before the idea of the germ theory was public in areas that use daily cleaning, the destruction of infectious agents seems to be dramatic. Others have described a &#x27;dimension of purity&#x27; that is universal in religions that seeks to move humans away from disgust (at one extreme), to uplift them towards purity and divinity (at the other extreme), away from uncleanliness to purity, and away from deviant to moral behavior (within one&#x27;s cultural context).

==Ancient Rome==
The ancient Romans performed ablutions as part of their religious and daily practices, often using water to purify themselves before engaging in sacred rites. Macrobius mentions the ritualistic use of ablutions in his work &quot;Saturnalia&quot;, highlighting their role in maintaining spiritual purity. Similarly, Ovid references ablutions in his &quot;Fasti&quot;, describing their importance during religious festivals and ceremonies. These practices underscored the significance of cleanliness and ritual purity in Roman culture. 

Modern practitioners of the ancient Roman religion, such as those in the Pietas Comunità Gentile and Nova Roma community, continue to observe ablutions as part of their reconstructed rituals, emphasizing continuity with traditional Roman customs.
==Baháʼí Faith==
In the Baháʼí Faith, ritual ablutions (the washing of the hands and face) should be done before the saying of the obligatory prayers, as well as prior to the recitation of the Greatest Name 95 times. Menstruating women are obliged to pray, but have the (voluntary) alternative of reciting a verse instead; if the latter choice is taken, ablutions are still required before the recital of the special verse. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, prescribed the ablutions in his book of laws, the &quot;Kitáb-i-Aqdas&quot;.

These ablutions have a significance beyond washing and should be performed even if one has bathed oneself immediately before reciting the obligatory prayer; fresh ablutions should also be performed for each devotion, unless they are being done at the same time. If no water (or clean water) is available or if an illness would be worsened by the use of water, one may instead repeat the verse &quot;In the Name of God, the Most Pure, the Most Pure&quot; five times before the prayer.

Apart from this, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh abolished all forms of ritual impurity of people and things, following Báb who stressed the importance of cleanliness and spiritual purity.

==Buddhism==
In Japanese Buddhism, a basin called a tsukubai is provided at Buddhist temples for ablutions. It is also used for tea ceremony.

This type of ritual cleansing is the custom for guests attending a tea ceremony or visiting the grounds of a Buddhist temple. The name originates from the verb &quot;tsukubau&quot; meaning &quot;to crouch&quot; or &quot;to bow down&quot;, an act of humility. Guests attending a tea ceremony crouch and wash their hands in a &quot;tsukubai&quot; set in the tea garden before entering the tearoom.

&quot;Tsukubai&quot; are usually of stone, and are often provided with a small ladle, ready for use. A supply of water may be provided via a bamboo pipe called a &quot;kakei&quot;.

The famous &quot;tsukubai&quot; shown here stands in the grounds of the Ryōan-ji temple in Kyoto, and was donated by the feudal lord Tokugawa Mitsukuni. The kanji written on the surface of the stone are without significance when read alone. If each is read in combination with 口 (kuchi) - the shape of the central bowl - then the characters become 吾, 唯, 足, 知 which translates literally as &quot;I only know plenty&quot; (吾 = ware = I, 唯 = tada = only, 足 = taru = plenty, 知 = shiru = know). The underlying meaning, variously translated as &quot;what one has is all one needs&quot;, or &quot;learn only to be content&quot; reflects the basic anti-materialistic teachings of Buddhism.

==Christianity==

The Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament) prescribes many rituals of purification relating to menstruation, childbirth, sexual relations, nocturnal emission, unusual bodily fluids, skin disease, death, and animal sacrifices. Oriental Orthodox Churches such as the Coptic Orthodox, Ethiopian Orthodox, and Eritrean Orthodox, place a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings, and its followers adhere to certain practices such as observing days of ritual purification. Before praying, they wash their hands and face in order to be clean before and present their best to God.

The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church prescribes several kinds of hand washing for example after leaving the latrine, lavatory or bathhouse, or before prayer, or after eating a meal. The women in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church are prohibited from entering the church temple during menses; and the men do not enter a church the day after they have had intercourse with their wives.

Baptism, as a form of ritual purification, occurs in several religions related to Judaism, and most prominently in Christianity; Christianity also has other forms of ritual purification. Many Christian churches practice a ceremony of the Washing of Feet, following the example of Jesus in the Gospel. Some interpret this as an ordinance which the church is obliged to keep as a commandment, see also Biblical law in Christianity. Others interpret it as an example that all should follow. Most denominations that practice the rite will perform it on Maundy Thursday. Often in these services, the bishop will wash the feet of the clergy, and in monasteries the Abbot will wash the feet of the brethren.

Many ancient churches were built with a large fountain in the courtyard. It was the tradition for Christians to wash before entering the church for worship. This usage is also legislated in the &quot;Rule of St. Benedict&quot;, as a result of which, many medieval monasteries were built with communal lavers for the monks or nuns to wash up before the Daily Office. Catholic religious orders of the Augustinians&#x27; and Benedictines&#x27; rules contained ritual purification, and inspired by Benedict of Nursia encouragement for the practice of therapeutic bathing; Benedictine monks played a role in the development and promotion of spas.

The requirement that a Catholic priest wash his hands before saying Mass began as a practical precaution of cleanness, which was also interpreted symbolically. &quot;In the third century there are traces of a custom of washing the hands as a preparation for prayer on the part of all Christians, and from the fourth century onwards it appears to have been usual for the ministers at the Catholic mass or divine liturgy to ceremonially wash their hands before the more solemn part of the service as a symbol of inward purity.&quot;

Traditionally, Christianity adhered to the biblical regulation requiring the purification of women after childbirth; this practice, was adapted into a special ritual known as the churching of women, for which there exists liturgy in the Church of England&#x27;s Book of Common Prayer, but its use is now rare in Western Christianity. The churching of women is still performed in a number of Eastern Christian churches (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches).

A cantharus is a fountain used by Christians for ablution before entering a church. These ablutions involve the washing of the hands, face, and feet. The cantharus is traditionally located in the exonarthex of the church. The water emitted by a cantharus is to be running water. The practice of ablutions before prayer and worship in Christianity symbolizes &quot;separation from sins of the spirit and surrender to the Lord.&quot; Eusebius recorded this practice of canthari located in the courtyards of churches, for the faithful to wash themselves before entering a Christian house of worship. The practice has its origins Jewish practice of performing ablutions before entering into the presence of God (cf. ). Though cantharus are not as prevalent anymore in Western Christianity, they are found in Eastern Christian and Oriental Christian churches. However, in the Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church, worshippers sprinkle themselves with holy water before entering the nave of the Church or approaching the altar.

In Reformed Christianity, ritual purity is achieved through the Confession of Sins, Assurance of Forgiveness, and Sanctification. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, believers offer their whole being and labor as a &#x27;living sacrifice&#x27;; and cleanliness becomes a way of life (See Romans 12:1, and John 13:5-10 (the Washing of the Feet)). Prior to praying the canonical hours at seven fixed prayer times, Oriental Orthodox Christians wash their hands, face and feet (cf. &quot;Agpeya&quot;, &quot;Shehimo&quot;).

The use of water in many Christian countries is due in part to the Biblical toilet etiquette which encourages washing after all instances of defecation. The bidet is common in predominantly Catholic countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing, and in some traditionally Orthodox and Lutheran countries such as Greece and Finland respectively, where bidet showers are common.

==Hinduism==

Various traditions within Hinduism follow different standards of ritual purity and purification. Within each tradition the more orthodox groups follow stricter rules, but the strictest rules are generally prescribed for Brahmins, especially those engaged in the temple worship.

An important part of ritual purification in Hinduism is the bathing of the entire body, particularly in rivers considered holy such as the Ganges. It is considered auspicious to perform this method of purification before festivals after a death, in order to maintain purity.

Punyahavachanam is a ritual meant to purify one&#x27;s self and one&#x27;s home, usually performed before important occasions, like weddings. During the ceremony, mantras are chanted and then consecrated water is sprinkled over all of the participants and the items used.

In the ritual known as &quot;abhisheka&quot; (Sanskrit, &quot;sprinkling; ablution&quot;), the deity&#x27;s murti or image is ritually bathed with water, curd, milk, honey, ghee, cane sugar, rosewater, etc. Abhisheka is also a special form of puja prescribed by Agamic injunction. The act is also performed in the inauguration of religious and political monarchs and for other special blessings. The murtis of deities must not be touched without cleansing the hands, and one is not supposed to enter a temple without a bath.

&quot;Sūtaka&quot; are the Hindu rules of impurity to be followed after the birth of a child (&quot;vṛddhi sūtaka&quot;). Sūtaka involves the practice of keeping socially isolated from relatives and community by abstention of mealtaking with family, engaging in customary religious activities, and leaving the home. A mother must practice sūtaka for 10 to 30 days, depending upon her varna, while the father may become purified immediately after the birth of his child by ritual purification (ritual bathing).

There are various kinds of purificatory rituals associated with death ceremonies. After visiting a house where a death has recently occurred, Hindus are expected to take baths.

Women take a head bath after completing their four-day menstrual period.

==Indigenous American religions==

In the traditions of many Indigenous peoples of the Americas, one of the forms of ritual purification is the ablutionary use of a sauna, known as a sweatlodge, as preparation for a variety of other ceremonies. The burning of smudge sticks is also believed by some indigenous groups to cleanse an area of any evil presence. Some groups like the southeastern tribe, the Cherokee, practiced and, to a lesser degree, still practice going to water, performed only in moving bodies of water such as rivers or streams. Going to water was practiced by some villages daily (around sunrise) while others would go to water primarily for special occasions, including but not limited to naming ceremonies, holidays, and ball games. Many anthropologists that studied with the Cherokees like James Adair tried to connect these groups to the Lost Tribes of Israel based on religious practices including going to water, but this form of historiography is mostly Christian &quot;wish fulfillment&quot; rather than respectable anthropology.

Yuquot Whalers&#x27; Shrine on Vancouver Island was used by chiefs to prepare ritually for whaling.

==Islam==

Islamic ritual purification is particularly centred on the preparation for salah, ritual prayer; theoretically ritual purification would remain valid throughout the day, but is treated as invalid on the occurrence of certain acts, flatulence, sleep, contact with the opposite sex (depending on which school of thought), unconsciousness, and the emission of blood, semen, or vomit. Some schools of thought mandate that ritual purity is necessary for holding the Quran.

Ritual purification takes the form of ablution, wudu and ghusl, depending on the circumstance; the greater form is obligatory by a woman after she ceases menstruation, on a corpse that did not die during battle, and after sexual activity, and is optionally used on other occasions, for example just prior to Friday prayers or entering ihram.

An alternative &quot;tayammum&quot; (&quot;dry ablution&quot;), involving clean sand or earth, is used if clean water is not available or if an illness would be worsened by the use of water; this form is invalidated in the same circumstances as the other forms, and also whenever water becomes available and safe to use.

The fard or &quot;obligatory activities&quot; of the lesser form include beginning with the intention to purify oneself, washing of the face, arms, head, and feet. while some &quot;mustahabb&quot; &quot;recommended activities&quot; also exist such as basmala recitation, oral hygiene, washing the mouth, nose at the beginning, washing of arms to the elbows and washing of the ears at the end; additionally recitation of the Shahada. The greater form (ghusl) is completed by first performing wudu and then ensuring that the entire body is washed. Some minor details of Islamic ritual purification may vary between different madhhabs &quot;schools of thought&quot;.

==Judaism==


The Hebrew Bible mentions a number of situations when ritual purification is required, including following menstruation (niddah), childbirth, sexual relations, nocturnal emission, unusual bodily fluids, skin disease, death (corpse uncleanness), and certain animal sacrifices. Generally, the ritual in these circumstances consists of immersing the whole body in a special bath (a &quot;mikveh&quot;). In addition, the oral law specifies other situations when ritual purification is required, such as after performing excretory functions, meals, and waking. In these circumstances, typically, only the hands are washed.

These regulations were variously observed by the Israelites. Purification was required so ritually impure individuals would not defile the Tabernacle and receive the kareth or execution. Nowadays, in the absence of the Temple in Jerusalem, many of the Torah&#x27;s laws about purification have no practical implication and are no longer observed. However, purification from the niddah status is still observed by contemporary Orthodox Jews and (with some modifications and additional leniencies) some Conservative Jews, as its practical implications are highly relevant: a woman who is impure with this status is forbidden to have sexual contact with her husband.

Corpse uncleanness, or coming into contact with a corpse, is considered the ultimate impurity. It cannot be purified through immersion in a mikveh alone, but also requires sprinkling with the ashes of the red heifer. Since the red heifer no longer exists, this form of impurity cannot be removed. Currently, all individuals are assumed to possess the impurity of death. This has a few practical implications: it prohibits Jews from entering the site of the Temple in Jerusalem and prohibits eating certain foods (such as &quot;terumah&quot;) which may only be eaten when pure.

==Mandaeism==

One of the most important ceremonies in Mandaean worship is baptism (&quot;masbuta&quot;). Unlike Christianity, baptism is not a one-off event but is performed every Sunday, the Mandaean holy day, as a purification ritual. Baptism usually involves full immersion in flowing water, and all rivers considered fit for baptism are called &quot;yardna&quot; for the Jordan River. After emerging from the water, the worshipper is anointed with holy sesame oil (&quot;misha&quot;) and partakes in a communion of sacramental bread (&quot;pihta&quot;) and water. Other rituals for purification include the &quot;rishama&quot; and the &quot;tamasha&quot; which, unlike &quot;masbuta&quot;, can be performed without a priest. The &quot;rishama&quot; (signing) is performed before prayers and involves washing the face and limbs while reciting specific prayers. It is performed daily, before sunrise, with hair covered and after evacuation of bowels or before religious ceremonies (see wudu). The &quot;tamasha&quot; is a triple immersion in the river without a priest being required to do it. Women perform it after menstruation or childbirth, men and women after sexual activity or nocturnal emission, touching a corpse or any other type of defilement (see tevilah). Ritual purification also applies to fruits, vegetables, pots, pans, utensils, animals for consumption and ceremonial garments (&quot;rasta&quot;). Purification for a dying person is also performed. It includes bathing, which involves a threefold sprinkling of river water over the person from head to feet.

==Shinto==
Ritual cleanliness is a central part of Shinto life. In Shinto, a common form of ritual purification is , which involves natural running water, and especially waterfalls. Rather than being entirely naked, men usually wear Japanese loincloths and women wear kimono, both additionally wearing headbands.

== Western esotericism ==

In ceremonial magic, &#x27;banishing&#x27; refers to one or more rituals intended to remove non-physical influences ranging from spirits to negative influences. Although banishing rituals are often used as components of more complex ceremonies, they can also be performed by themselves. Banishing can be viewed as one of several techniques of magic, closely related to ritual purification and a typical prerequisite for consecration and invocation.

In the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram (banishing: LBRP; invoking: LIRP) must be learned by the Neophyte before moving on to the next grade (Zelator). For actual workings Aleister Crowley recommends a short, general banishing, with a comment that &quot;in more elaborate ceremonies it is usual to banish everything by name.&quot; In &quot;Liber Aleph vel CXI&quot;, Crowley recommended that a banishing ritual be done at least once daily by Thelemites.

In Wicca and various forms of neopaganism, banishing is performed before casting a circle in order to purify the area where the ritual or magick is about to take place. In his books on nocturnal witchcraft, for example, Konstantinos recommends performing banishings regularly, in order to keep the magical workspace free of negativity, and to become proficient in banishing before attempting acts that are much more spiritually taxing on the body, such as magical spellworking.

<doc id="326213" wikidata="Q2915151" url="?curid=326213" title="Technology during World War I">
<text>Technology during World War I (1914–1918) reflected a trend toward industrialism and the application of mass-production methods to weapons and to the technology of warfare in general. This trend began at least fifty years prior to World War I during the American Civil War of 1861–1865, and continued through many smaller conflicts in which soldiers and strategists tested new weapons.
World War I weapons included types standardised and improved over the preceding period, together with some newly developed types using innovative technology and a number of improvised weapons used in trench warfare. Military technology of the time included important innovations in machine guns, grenades, and artillery, along with essentially new weapons such as submarines, poison gas, warplanes and tanks.

The earlier years of the First World War could be characterized as a clash of 20th-century technology with 19th-century military science creating ineffective battles with huge numbers of casualties on both sides. On land, the quick descent into trench warfare came as a surprise, and only in the final year of the war did the major armies make effective steps in revolutionizing matters of command and control and tactics to adapt to the modern battlefield and start to harness the myriad new technologies to effective military purposes. Tactical reorganizations (such as shifting the focus of command from the 100+ man company to the 10+ man squad) went hand-in-hand with armoured cars, the first submachine guns, and automatic rifles that a single individual soldier could carry and use!

== Trench warfare ==

Much of the combat involved trench warfare, in which hundreds often died for each metre gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during World WarI. Such battles include Ypres, the Marne, Cambrai, the Somme, Verdun, and Gallipoli. The Germans employed the Haber process of nitrogen fixation to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder despite the British naval blockade. Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties and consumed vast quantities of explosives.

Trench warfare led to the development of the concrete pill box, a small, hardened blockhouse that could be used to deliver machine gun fire. Pillboxes could be placed across a battlefield with interlocking fields of fire.

Because attacking an entrenched enemy was so difficult, tunnel warfare became a major effort during the war. Once enemy positions were undermined, huge amounts of explosives would be planted and detonated to prepare for an overland charge. Sensitive listening devices that could detect the sounds of digging were crucial for defense against these underground incursions. The British proved especially adept at these tactics, thanks to the skill of their tunnel-digging &quot;sappers&quot; and the sophistication of their listening devices.
During the war, the immobility of trench warfare and a need for protection from snipers created a requirement for loopholes both for discharging firearms and for observation. Often a steel plate was used with a &quot;key hole&quot;, which had a rotating piece to cover the loophole when not in use.

=== Clothing ===
The British and German armies had already changed from red coat (British army) (1902) or Prussian blue (1910) for field uniforms, to less conspicuous khaki or field gray. Adolphe Messimy, Joseph Gallieni and other French leaders had proposed following suit, but the French army marched to war in their traditional red trousers, and only began receiving the new &quot;horizon blue&quot; ones in 1915.

A type of raincoat for British officers, introduced long before the war, gained fame as the trench coat.

The principal armies entered the war under cloth caps or leather helmets. They hastened to develop new steel helmets, in designs that became icons of their respective countries.

=== Observation trees ===
Observing the enemy in trench warfare was difficult, prompting the invention of technology such as the camouflage tree, a man made observation tower that enables forces to discreetly observe their enemy.

== Artillery ==

Artillery also underwent a revolution. In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, indirect fire with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably, aircraft and the often overlooked field telephone.

At the beginning of the war, artillery was often sited in the front line to fire over open sights at enemy infantry. During the war, the following improvements were made:

* Indirect counter-battery fire was developed for the first time
* Forward observers were used to direct artillery positioned out of direct line of sight from the targets, and sophisticated communications and fire plans were developed
*Artillery sound ranging and flash spotting, for the location and eventual destruction of enemy batteries
* Factors such as weather, air temperature, and barrel wear could for the first time be accurately measured and taken into account for indirect fire
*The first &quot;box barrage&quot; in history was fired in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915; this was the use of a three- or four-sided curtain of shell-fire to prevent the movement of enemy infantry
* The creeping barrage was perfected
* The wire-cutting No. 106 fuze was developed, specifically designed to explode on contact with barbed wire, or the ground before the shell buried itself in mud, and equally effective as an anti-personnel weapon
* The first anti-aircraft guns were devised out of necessity

Germany was far ahead of the Allies in using heavy indirect fire. The German Army employed and howitzers in 1914, when typical French and British guns were only and . The British had a 6-inch (152 mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. The Germans also fielded Austrian and guns and, even at the beginning of the war, had inventories of various calibres of &quot;Minenwerfer&quot;, which were ideally suited for trench warfare.

Field artillery entered the war with the idea that each gun should be accompanied by hundreds of shells, and armouries ought to have about a thousand on hand for resupply. This proved utterly inadequate when it became commonplace for a gun to sit in one place and fire a hundred shells or more per day for weeks or months on end. To meet the resulting Shell Crisis of 1915, factories were hastily converted from other purposes to make more ammunition. Railways to the front were expanded or built, leaving the question of the last mile. Horses in World War I were the main answer, and their high death rate seriously weakened the Central Powers late in the war. In many places the newly invented trench railways helped. The new motor trucks as yet lacked pneumatic tires, versatile suspension, and other improvements that in later decades would allow them to perform well.

== Poison gas ==
The widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict. Gases used included chlorine, mustard gas and phosgene. Relatively few war casualties were caused by gas, as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as gas masks. The use of chemical warfare and small-scale strategic bombing (as opposed to tactical bombing) were both outlawed by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, and both proved to be of limited effectiveness, though they captured the public imagination.

At the beginning of the war, Germany had the most advanced chemical industry in the world, accounting for more than 80% of the world&#x27;s dye and chemical production. Although the use of poison gas had been banned by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, Germany turned to this industry for what it hoped would be a decisive weapon to break the deadlock of trench warfare. Chlorine gas was first used on the battlefield in April 1915 at the Second Battle of Ypres in Belgium. The unknown gas appeared to be a simple smoke screen, used to hide attacking soldiers, and Allied troops were ordered to the front trenches to repel the expected attack. The gas had a devastating effect, killing many defenders or, when the wind direction changed and blew the gas back, many attackers.

The wind being unreliable, another way had to be found to transmit the gas. It began being delivered in artillery shells. Later, mustard gas, phosgene and other gasses were used. Britain and France soon followed suit with their own gas weapons. The first defenses against gas were makeshift, mainly rags soaked in water or urine. Later, relatively effective gas masks were developed, and these greatly reduced the effectiveness of gas as a weapon. Although it sometimes resulted in brief tactical advantages and probably caused over 1,000,000 casualties, gas seemed to have had no significant effect on the course of the war.

Chemical weapons were easily attained, and cheap. Gas was especially effective against troops in trenches and bunkers that protected them from other weapons. Most chemical weapons attacked an individual&#x27;s respiratory system. The concept of choking easily caused fear in soldiers and the resulting terror affected them psychologically. Because there was such a great fear of chemical weapons it was not uncommon that a soldier would panic and misinterpret symptoms of the common cold as being affected by a poisonous gas.

== Command and control ==
The introduction of radio telegraphy was a significant step in communication during World War I. The stations utilized at that time were spark-gap transmitters. As an example, the information of the start of World War I was transmitted to German South West Africa on 2 August 1914 via radio telegraphy from the Nauen transmitter station via a relay station in Kamina and Lomé in Togo to the radio station in Windhoek.

In the early days of the war, generals tried to direct tactics from headquarters many miles from the front, with messages being carried back and forth by runners or motorcycle couriers. It was soon realized that more immediate methods of communication were needed.

Radio sets of the period were too heavy to carry into battle, and field telephone lines laid were quickly broken. Either one was subject to eavesdropping, and trench codes were not very satisfactory. Runners, flashing lights, and mirrors were often used instead; dogs were also used, but were only used occasionally as troops tended to adopt them as pets and men would volunteer to go as runners in the dog&#x27;s place. There were also aircraft (called &quot;contact patrols&quot;) that carried messages between headquarters and forward positions, sometimes dropping their messages without landing. Technical advances in radio, however, continued during the war and radio telephony was perfected, being most useful for airborne artillery spotters.

The new long-range artillery developed just before the war now had to fire at positions it could not see. Typical tactics were to pound the enemy front lines and then stop to let infantry move forward, hoping that the enemy line was broken, though it rarely was. The lifting and then the creeping barrage were developed to keep artillery fire landing directly in front of the infantry &quot;as it advanced.&quot; Communications being impossible, the danger was that the barrage would move too fastlosing the protectionor too slowlyholding up the advance.

There were also countermeasures to these artillery tactics: by aiming a counter barrage directly behind an enemy&#x27;s creeping barrage, one could target the infantry that was following the creeping barrage. Microphones (Sound ranging) were used to triangulate the position of enemy guns and engage in counter-battery fire. Muzzle flashes of guns could also be spotted and used to target enemy artillery.

The impressive spread of telecommunications in the armed forces during WWIwhich extended commanders&#x27; command and control over distant forces and shipsalso led to the Intelligence branch assuming an ever greater importance. The growth of military telephone and radiotelegraphic communications encouraged all Intelligence Services to study how to extract the greatest amount of intel from the enemies&#x27; communication systems, by relying on some inherent weaknesses of those media. Radio interception was particularly easy, creating the need to invent World War I cryptography. Even the earliest episodes of the war showed, often surprisingly, what type of impact the eavesdropping and interpretation of the enemy&#x27;s transmissions could have on military operations. As such, this period witnessed significant developments in the intelligence category today commonly known as signals intelligence, or SIGINT. Exploitation of intercepted
Russian radio signals contributed to the German victory at Tannenberg in August 1914. Even when messages could not be decoded, radio direction finding was used to track the motion of enemy units.

== Railways ==

Railways dominated in this war as in no other. The German strategy was known beforehand by the Allies simply because of the vast marshaling yards on the Belgian border that had no other purpose than to deliver the mobilized German army to its start point. The German mobilization plan was little more than a vast detailed railway timetable. Men and material could get to the front at an unprecedented rate by rail, but trains were vulnerable at the front itself. Thus, armies could only advance at the pace that they could build or rebuild a railway, e.g. the British advance across Sinai. Motorized transport was only extensively used in the last two years of World War I. After the rail head, troops moved the last mile on foot, and guns and supplies were drawn by horses and trench railways. Railways lacked the flexibility of motor transport and this lack of flexibility percolated through into the conduct during the war.

== War of attrition ==
The countries involved in the war applied the full force of industrial mass-production to the manufacture of weapons and ammunition, especially artillery shells. Women on the home-front played a crucial role in this by working in munitions factories. This complete mobilization of a nation&#x27;s resources, or &quot;total war&quot; meant that not only the armies, but also the economies of the warring nations were in competition.

For a time, in 1914–1915, some hoped that the war could be won through an attrition of materiel—that the enemy&#x27;s supply of artillery shells could be exhausted in futile exchanges. But production was ramped up on both sides and hopes proved futile. In Britain the Shell Crisis of 1915 brought down the British government, and led to the building of HM Factory, Gretna, a huge munitions factory on the English-Scottish border.

The war of attrition then focused on another resource: human lives. In the Battle of Verdun in particular, German Chief of Staff Erich Von Falkenhayn hoped to &quot;bleed France white&quot; through repeated attacks on this French city.

In the end, the war ended through a combination of attrition (of men and material), advances on the battlefield, arrival of American troops in large numbers, and a breakdown of morale and production on the German home-front due to an effective naval blockade of her seaports.

== Air warfare ==


Aviation in World War I started with primitive aircraft, primitively used. Technological progress was swift, leading to ground attack, tactical bombing, and highly publicized, deadly dogfights among aircraft equipped with forward-firing, synchronized machine guns from July 1915 onwards. However, these uses made a lesser impact on the war than more mundane roles in intelligence, sea patrol and especially artillery spotting. Antiaircraft warfare also had its beginnings in this war.

Fixed-wing aircraft were first used militarily by the Italians in Libya on 23 October 1911 during the Italo-Turkish War for reconnaissance, soon followed by the dropping of grenades and aerial photography the next year. By 1914, their military utility was obvious. They were initially used for reconnaissance and ground attack. To shoot down enemy planes, anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft were developed. Strategic bombers were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used Zeppelins as well. Perhaps the most famous fighter plane during World War 1 was the Fokker as it was the first to include a synchronized machine gun. Towards the end of the conflict, aircraft carriers were used for the first time, with HMS &quot;Furious&quot; launching Sopwith Camels in a raid to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at Tønder in 1918.

Manned observation balloons, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with parachutes, so that if there was an enemy air attack the crew could parachute to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.

Recognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft. To defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by anti-aircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were tried. Thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France.

While early air spotters were unarmed, they soon began firing at each other with handheld weapons. An arms race commenced, quickly leading to increasingly agile planes equipped with machine guns. A key innovation was the interrupter gear, a Dutch invention that allowed a machine gun to be mounted behind the propeller so the pilot could fire directly ahead, along the plane&#x27;s flight path.

German strategic bombing during World War I struck Warsaw, Paris, London and other cities. Germany led the world in Zeppelins, and used these airships to make occasional bombing raids on military targets, London and other British cities, without great effect. Later in the war, Germany introduced long range strategic bombers. Damage was again minor but they forced the British air forces to maintain squadrons of fighters in England to defend against air attack, depriving the British Expeditionary Force of planes, equipment, and personnel badly needed on the Western front.

== Mobility ==

In the early days of the war, armoured cars armed with machine guns were organized into combat units, along with cyclist infantry and machine guns mounted on motor cycle sidecars. Though not able to assault entrenched positions, they provided mobile fire support to infantry, and performed scouting, reconnaissance, and other roles similar to cavalry. After trench warfare took hold of major battle-lines, opportunities for such vehicles greatly diminished, though they continued to see use in the more open campaigns in Russia and the Middle East.

Between late 1914 and early 1918, the Western Front hardly moved. When the Russian Empire surrendered after the October Revolution in 1917, Germany was able to move many troops to the Western Front. With new stormtrooper infantry trained in infiltration tactics to exploit enemy weak points and penetrate into rear areas, they launched a series of offensives in the spring of 1918. In the largest of these, Operation Michael, General Oskar von Hutier pushed forward 60 kilometers, gaining in a couple weeks what France and Britain had spent years to achieve. Although initially successful tactically, these offensives stalled after outrunning their horse-drawn supply, artillery, and reserves, leaving German forces weakened and exhausted.

The mobile personnel shield was a less successful attempt at restoring mobility. Several kinds of bullet-proof body armor were tested in use, but they more impaired movement than protected the body.

In the Battle of Amiens of August 1918, the Triple Entente forces began a counterattack that would be called the &quot;Hundred Days Offensive.&quot; The Australian and Canadian divisions that spearheaded the attack managed to advance 13 kilometers on the first day alone. These battles marked the end of trench warfare on the Western Front and a return to mobile warfare.

After the war, the defeated Germans would seek to combine their infantry-based mobile warfare of 1918 with vehicles, eventually leading to &quot;blitzkrieg&quot;, or &#x27;lightning warfare&#x27;.

=== Tanks ===
Although the concept of the tank had been suggested as early as the 1890s, authorities showed little more than a passing interest in them until the trench stalemate of World War I caused reconsideration. In early 1915, the British Royal Navy and French industrialists both started dedicated development of tanks.

Basic tank design combined several existing technologies. It included armour plating thick enough to be proof against all standard infantry arms, caterpillar track for mobility over the shell-torn battlefield, the four-stroke gasoline powered internal combustion engine (refined in the 1870s), and heavy firepower, provided by the same machine guns which had recently become so dominant in warfare, or even light artillery guns.

In Britain, a committee was formed to work out a practical tank design. The outcome was large tanks with a rhomboidal shape, to allow crossing of an trench: the Mark I tank, with the &quot;male&quot; versions mounting small naval guns and machine guns, and the &quot;female&quot; carrying only machine guns.

In France, several competing arms industry organizations each proposed radically different designs. Smaller tanks became favored, leading to the Renault FT tank, in part by being able to leverage the engines and manufacturing techniques of commercial tractors and automobiles.

Although the tanks&#x27; initial appearance on the battlefield in 1916 terrified some German troops, such engagements provided more opportunities for development than battle successes. Early tanks were unreliable, breaking down often. Germans learned they were vulnerable to direct hits from field artillery and heavy mortars, their trenches were widened and other obstacles devised to halt them, and special anti-tank rifles were rapidly developed. Also, both Britain and France found new tactics and training were required to make effective use of their tanks, such as larger coordinated formations of tanks and close support with infantry. Once tanks could be organized in the hundreds, as in the opening assault of the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, they began to have notable impact.

Throughout the remainder of the war, new tank designs often revealed flaws in battle, to be addressed in later designs, but reliability remained the primary weakness of tanks. In the Battle of Amiens, a major Entente counteroffensive near the end of the war, British forces went to field with 532 tanks; after several days, only a few were still in commission, with those that suffered mechanical difficulties outnumbering those disabled by enemy fire.

Germany utilized many captured enemy tanks, and made a few of their own late in the war.

In the last year of the war, despite rapidly increasing production (especially by France) and improving designs, tank technology struggled to make more than a modest impact on the war&#x27;s overall progress. Plan 1919 proposed the future use of massive tank formations in great offensives combined with ground attack aircraft.

Even without achieving the decisive results hoped for during World War I, tank technology and mechanized warfare had been launched and would grow increasingly sophisticated in the years following the war. By World War II, the tank would evolve into a fearsome weapon critical to restoring mobility to land warfare.

== At sea ==
The years leading up to the war saw the use of improved metallurgical and mechanical techniques to produce larger ships with larger guns and, in reaction, more armour. The launching of HMS Dreadnought (1906) revolutionized battleship construction, leaving many ships obsolete before they were completed. German ambitions brought an Anglo-German naval arms race in which the Imperial German Navy was built up from a small force to the world&#x27;s most modern and second most powerful. However, even this high-technology navy entered the war with a mix of newer ships and obsolete older ones.

The advantage was in long-range gunnery, and naval battles took place at far greater distances than before. The 1916 Battle of Jutland demonstrated the excellence of German ships and crews, but also showed that the High Seas Fleet was not big enough to challenge openly the British blockade of Germany. It was the only full-scale battle between fleets in the war.

Having the largest surface fleet, the United Kingdom sought to press its advantage. British ships blockaded German ports, hunted down German and Austro-Hungarian ships wherever they might be on the high seas, and supported actions against German colonies. The German surface fleet was largely kept in the North Sea. This situation pushed Germany, in particular, to direct its resources to a new form of naval power: submarines.

Naval mines were deployed in hundreds of thousands, or far greater numbers than in previous wars. Submarines proved surprisingly effective for this purpose. Influence mines were a new development but moored contact mines were the most numerous. They resembled those of the late 19th century, improved so they less often exploded while being laid. The Allies produced enough mines to build the North Sea Mine Barrage to help bottle the Germans into the North Sea, but it was too late to make much difference.

=== Submarines ===

Germany deployed U-boats (submarines) after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, the Imperial German Navy employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), hydrophones (sonar, 1917), blimps, hunter-killer submarines (HMS &quot;R-1&quot;, 1917), forward-throwing anti-submarine weapons, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918). To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). Most of these would be forgotten in the interwar period until World WarII revived the need.

The United Kingdom relied heavily on imports to feed its population and supply its war industry, and the German Navy hoped to blockade and starve Britain using U-boats to attack merchant ships. Lieutenant Otto Weddigen remarked of the second submarine attack of the Great War:

Submarines soon came under persecution by submarine chasers and other small warships using hastily devised anti-submarine weapons. They could not impose an effective blockade while acting under the restrictions of the prize rules and international law of the sea. They resorted to unrestricted submarine warfare, which cost Germany public sympathy in neutral countries and was a factor contributing to the American entry into World War I.

This struggle between German submarines and British countermeasures became known as the &quot;First Battle of the Atlantic.&quot; As German submarines became more numerous and effective, the British sought ways to protect their merchant ships. &quot;Q-ships,&quot; attack vessels disguised as civilian ships, were one early strategy.

Consolidating merchant ships into convoys protected by one or more armed navy vessels was adopted later in the war. There was initially a great deal of debate about this approach, out of fear that it would provide German U-boats with a wealth of convenient targets. Thanks to the development of active and passive sonar devices, coupled with increasingly deadly anti-submarine weapons, the convoy system reduced British losses to U-boats to a small fraction of their former level.

Holland 602 type submarines and other Allied types were fewer, being unnecessary for the blockade of Germany.

== Small arms ==

Infantry weapons for major powers were mainly bolt-action rifles, capable of firing ten or more rounds per minute. German soldiers carried the Gewehr 98 rifle in 8mm Mauser, the British carried the Short Magazine Lee–Enfield rifle, and the US military employed the M1903 Springfield and M1917 Enfield. Rifles with telescopic sights were used by snipers, and were first used by the Germans.

Machine guns were also used by great powers; both sides used the Maxim gun, a fully automatic belt-fed weapon, capable of long-term sustained use provided it was supplied to adequate amounts of ammunition and cooling water, and its French counterpart, the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. Their use in defense, combined with barbed wire obstacles, converted the expected mobile battlefield to a static one. The machine gun was useful in stationary battle but could not move easily through a battlefield, and therefore forced soldiers to face enemy machine guns without machine guns of their own.

Before the war, the French Army studied the question of a light machine gun but had made none for use. At the start of hostilities, France quickly turned an existing prototype (the &quot;CS&quot; for Chauchat and Sutter) into the lightweight Chauchat M1915 automatic rifle with a high rate of fire. Besides its use by the French, the first American units to arrive in France used it in 1917 and 1918. Hastily mass-manufactured under desperate wartime pressures, the weapon developed a reputation for unreliability.

Seeing the potential of such a weapon, the British Army adopted the American-designed Lewis gun chambered in .303 British. The Lewis gun was the first true light machine gun that could in theory be operated by one man, though in practice the bulky ammo pans required an entire section of men to keep the gun operating. The Lewis Gun was also used for marching fire, notably by the Australian Corps in the July 1918 Battle of Hamel. To serve the same purpose, the German Army adopted the MG08/15 which was impractically heavy at counting the water for cooling and one belt of ammunition holding 100 rounds. In 1918 the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) was introduced in the US military, the weapon was an &quot;automatic rifle&quot; and like the Chauchat was designed with the concept of walking fire in mind. The tactic was to be employed under conditions of limited field of fire and poor visibility such as advancing through woods.

Early submachine guns were much used near the end of the war, such as the MP-18.

The US military deployed combat shotguns, commonly known as &quot;trench guns&quot;. American troops used Winchester Models 1897 and 1912 short-barreled pump action shotguns loaded with 6 rounds containing antimony hardened 00 buckshot to clear enemy trenches. Pump actions can be fired rapidly, simply by working the slide when the trigger is held down, and when fighting within a trench, the shorter shotgun could be rapidly turned and fired in the opposite direction along the trench axis. The shotguns prompted a diplomatic protest from Germany, claiming the shotguns caused excessive injury, and that any U.S. combatants found in possession of them would be subject to execution. The U.S. rejected the claims, and threatened reprisals in kind if any of its troops were executed for possession of a shotgun.

=== Grenades ===

Grenades proved to be effective weapons in the trenches. When the war started, grenades were few and poor. Hand grenades were used and improved throughout the war. Contact fuzes became less common, replaced by time fuzes.

The British entered the war with the long-handled impact detonating &quot;Grenade, Hand No 1&quot;. This was replaced by the No. 15 &quot;Ball Grenade&quot; to partially overcome some of its inadequacies. An improvised hand grenade was developed in Australia for use by ANZAC troops called the Double Cylinder &quot;jam tin&quot; which consisted of a tin filled with dynamite or guncotton, packed round with scrap metal or stones. To ignite, at the top of the tin there was a Bickford safety fuse connecting the detonator, which was lit by either the user, or a second person. The &quot;Mills bomb&quot; (Grenade, Hand No. 5) was introduced in 1915 and would serve in its basic form in the British Army until the 1970s. Its improved fusing system relied on the soldier removing a pin and while holding down a lever on the side of the grenade. When the grenade was thrown the safety lever would automatically release, igniting the grenade&#x27;s internal fuse which would burn down until the grenade detonated. The French would use the F1 defensive grenade.

The major grenades used in the beginning by the German Army were the impact-detonating &quot;discus&quot; or &quot;oyster shell&quot; bomb and the Mod 1913 black powder &quot;Kugelhandgranate&quot; with a friction-ignited time fuse. In 1915 Germany developed the much more effective &quot;Stielhandgranate&quot;, nicknamed &quot;potato masher&quot; for its shape, whose variants remained in use for decades; it used a timed fuse system similar to the Mills bomb.

Hand grenades were not the only attempt at projectile explosives for infantry. A rifle grenade was brought into the trenches to attack the enemy from a greater distance. The Hales rifle grenade got little attention from the British Army before the war began but, during the war, Germany showed great interest in this weapon. The resulting casualties for the Allies caused Britain to search for a new defense.

The Stokes mortar, a lightweight and very portable trench mortar with short tube and capable of indirect fire, was rapidly developed and widely imitated. Mechanical bomb throwers of lesser range were used in a similar fashion to fire upon the enemy from a safe distance within the trench.

The Sauterelle was a grenade launching Crossbow used before the Stokes mortar by French and British troops.

==Flamethrowers==

The Imperial German Army deployed flamethrowers () on the Western Front attempting to flush out French or British soldiers from their trenches. Introduced in 1915, it was used with greatest effect during the Hooge battle of the Western Front on 30 July 1915. The German Army had two main types of flame throwers during the Great War: a small single person version called the Kleinflammenwerfer and a larger crew served configuration called the Grossflammenwerfer. In the latter, one soldier carried the fuel tank while another aimed the nozzle. Both the large and smaller versions of the flame-thrower were of limited use because their short range left the exposed to small arms fire.

<text>Funimation was an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service. Launched in 2016, the service was one of the leading distributors of anime and other foreign entertainment properties in North America. It streamed popular series, such as &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot;, &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot;, &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;, &quot;My Hero Academia&quot;, &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;, &quot;Fairy Tail&quot;, &quot;Black Clover&quot;, &quot;Fruits Basket&quot;, &quot;Assassination Classroom&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Ghoul&quot; among many others. The service and its parent company were acquired by Sony, who ran the service through Sony Pictures Entertainment from 2017 to 2019 and then through SPE and Sony Music Entertainment Japan&#x27;s Aniplex from 2019 to its closure in 2024. In 2021, Sony acquired Crunchyroll. 

In March 2022, Funimation Global Group, the service&#x27;s parent company, was rebranded as Crunchyroll, LLC and a large majority of its catalog was moved to Crunchyroll; despite this, the Funimation streaming service remained active and continued to distribute titles that were originally licensed by the Funimation company before the merger until it was shut down in April 2024.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

In the early 1990s, Japanese-born businessman Gen Fukunaga was approached by his uncle, Nagafumi Hori, who was working as a producer for Toei Company. Hori proposed that if Fukunaga could start a production company and raise enough money, Toei Animation would license the rights to the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise to the United States. Fukunaga met with co-worker Daniel Cocanougher, whose family owned a feed mill in Decatur, Texas, and convinced Cocanougher&#x27;s family to sell their business and serve as an investor for his new company. The company was founded on May 9, 1994, as FUNimation Productions.

They initially collaborated with other companies on &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, such as BLT Productions, Ocean Studios, Pioneer and Saban Entertainment. After two aborted attempts to bring the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise to television via first-run syndication, Cartoon Network began airing &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; as part of its Toonami programming block in 1998, which quickly became the highest-rated show on the block and garnered a large following. The success of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; is credited for allowing Funimation to acquire other licensed titles.

===Launch and beginning of Funimation Films===
In 2009, Funimation signed a deal with Toei Animation to stream several of its anime titles online through the Funimation website. On October 14, 2011, Funimation announced a partnership with Niconico, the English language version of Nico Nico Douga, to form the Funico brand for the licensing of anime for streaming and home video release. From this point on, virtually all titles simulcasted by Niconico were acquired by Funimation. On February 18, 2012, Funimation announced that it would launch its video streaming app on April 6, 2012.

In 2014, Funimation released &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&quot; to theaters in partnership with Screenvision. Based on its success, Funimation launched its own theatrical division in December 2014. On June 22, 2015, Funimation and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment announced a multi-year home video distribution deal. The deal allowed UPHE to manage distribution and sales of Funimation&#x27;s catalog of titles. Universal began distributing Funimation&#x27;s titles in October of that year.

===Rebranding as FunimationNow===

In January 2016, Funimation introduced a new logo and announced the rebranding of their streaming platform as &quot;FunimationNow&quot;. In April 2016, they launched their service in the UK and Ireland.

On September 8, 2016, Funimation announced a partnership with Crunchyroll. Select Funimation titles would be streamed subtitled on Crunchyroll, while select Crunchyroll titles would be streamed on FunimationNow, including upcoming dubbed content. In addition, Funimation would act as the distributor for Crunchyroll&#x27;s home video catalog.

On May 18, 2017, Shout! Factory acquired the North American distribution rights to &quot;In This Corner of the World&quot;, with a U.S. theatrical release to take place on August 11, 2017, co-released by Funimation Films.

=== Acquisition by Sony Pictures Television ===
In May 2017, it was reported that Universal Studios and Sony Pictures Television were interested in purchasing Funimation; however, Universal decided not to proceed with the bidding. On July 31, 2017, Sony Pictures Television announced that it would buy a controlling 95% stake in Funimation for $143 million, a deal that was approved by the United States Department of Justice on August 22, 2017. This deal allowed Funimation to have synergies with Sony&#x27;s Animax and Kids Station divisions and &quot;direct access to the creative pipeline&quot;. The deal was closed on October 27, 2017.

On February 16, 2018, it was reported that Shout! Factory&#x27;s Shout! Studios division acquired the U.S./Canadian distribution rights to &quot;Big Fish &amp; Begonia&quot; and partnered with Funimation Films again for distribution. On July 12, 2018, it was announced that Funimation Films had picked up licensing rights for &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Broly&quot; in North America and that its English dub would premiere in theaters sometime in January 2019 in the United States and Canada, only around a month after its national premiere in Japan.

On August 7, 2018, AT&amp;T fully acquired Otter Media, owner of Crunchyroll. On October 18, 2018, Funimation and Crunchyroll announced that their partnership with would end on November 9, 2018, as a result of Sony Pictures Television&#x27;s acquisition of Funimation. Despite the home video releases being unaffected and still going on as planned, select Funimation content would be removed from Crunchyroll, and subtitled content would return to FunimationNow. Additionally, it was also announced that Funimation would be removed from Otter Media-owned streaming service VRV entirely, being replaced by Hidive. In December 2018, it was reported that another reason the partnership ended was due to a dispute concerning international expansion. On December 4, 2018, Funimation inked an exclusive multi-year first-look SVOD deal with Hulu.

On March 23, 2019, at AnimeJapan 2019, Funimation announced that they had partnered with Chinese streaming service Bilibili to jointly license anime titles for both the U.S. and Chinese markets.

On May 29, 2019, Funimation announced that they had acquired Manga Entertainment&#x27;s UK branch, and immediately consolidated the former&#x27;s UK business into the latter&#x27;s. On July 5, 2019, Funimation announced at Anime Expo that they had reached a streaming partnership with Right Stuf Inc., with select titles from Nozomi Entertainment being made available on FunimationNow later in the year. On August 31, 2019, Aniplex of America announced on Twitter that they would be partnering with Funimation Films to co-release &quot;Rascal Does Not Dream of a Dreaming Girl&quot; theatrically in the U.S. on October 2, 2019, and in Canada on October 4, 2019.

=== SPT / Aniplex joint venture and streaming consolidation ===
On September 24, 2019, Sony Pictures Television and Aniplex announced that they were consolidating their international anime streaming businesses under a new joint venture, Funimation Global Group, LLC., with Funimation general manager Colin Decker leading the joint venture. The joint venture would operate under Funimation&#x27;s branding, and allow Funimation to acquire and distribute titles with Aniplex subsidiaries Wakanim, Madman Anime and AnimeLab. The first title under the joint venture, &quot;Fate/Grand Order - Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia&quot;, would receive a 30-day exclusivity on FunimationNow, AnimeLab and Wakanim, and provide Funimation exclusive rights to the English dub for one year.

In December 2019, Funimation launched a &quot;Decade of Anime&quot; poll in which fans voted for their favorite anime across multiple categories.

On January 24, 2020, Funimation announced it would be merging its online catalog into AnimeLab for Australian and New Zealand audiences, and would shut down FunimationNow for Australia and New Zealand on March 30.

On May 1, 2020, Funimation announced that they formed a partnership with Kodansha Comics to host a series of weekly watch parties. On May 4, Funimation announced that they had struck a deal with NIS America to stream select titles on FunimationNow.

On July 3, 2020, Funimation announced at FunimationCon that they would expand their streaming service to Latin America, starting with Mexico and Brazil in Q4 2020, with one of the first dubbed titles released being &quot;Tokyo Ghoul:re&quot;. Funimation later revealed that they would launch their Latin American services in December 2020. However, they launched their service early on November 18, 2020.

On September 9, 2020, Funimation announced that they had reached a distribution partnership with Viz Media, with Viz Media titles being made available to stream on Funimation&#x27;s website. The deal was made after select Viz titles such as Part I of &quot;Naruto&quot; and the first 75 episodes of &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot; were previously made available on FunimationNow. On December 2, 2020, Brazilian TV channel Loading announced a content partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment. Funimation titles being included in the partnership was hinted at, but not confirmed. Five days later, it was officially confirmed that Funimation titles would be included in the partnership.

On November 24, 2020, Funimation announced they had partnered with Sunrise to stream select &quot;Gundam&quot; titles such as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;, and later &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot; and &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;. Some &quot;Gundam&quot; titles already streamed on Funimation prior to said partnership like &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans&quot;.

On December 9, 2020, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that it would acquire Crunchyroll from AT&amp;T&#x27;s WarnerMedia (later spun out by AT&amp;T and merged with Discovery, Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery) for a total of in cash, placing the company under Funimation once the acquisition was finalized. The acquisition of Crunchyroll was completed on August 9, 2021, with Sony stating in their press release that they would create a unified anime subscription using their anime businesses as soon as possible.

On April 12, 2021, it was announced that subsidiary Manga Entertainment would officially be rebranding as Funimation UK in the UK and Ireland, starting on April 19, 2021. On June 10, 2021, it was announced AnimeLab would begin the process of rebranding and transitioning its services to Funimation in Australia and New Zealand, on June 17, 2021. On June 16, 2021, Funimation launched in Colombia, Chile, and Peru.

On September 1, 2021, Funimation and Gonzo announced a partnership to upload select remastered titles on their respective YouTube channels until November 30. These titles were &quot;Ragnarok the Animation&quot;, &quot;Witchblade&quot; and &quot;Burst Angel&quot;.

On January 25, 2022, Crunchyroll announced that they were going to release &quot;Jujutsu Kaisen 0&quot; in theaters on March 18, 2022, in the United States and Canada. The film launched in over 1,500 theaters, as well as some IMAX theatres, in both sub and dub. They also stated that the feature would be coming soon to theaters in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, and Latin America among other countries. This was the first and only Crunchyroll film to be distributed in association with Funimation Films.

On March 1, 2022, it was announced that the Funimation, Wakanim and VRV SVOD services would be consolidated into Crunchyroll. Despite this, the Funimation streaming service remained in operation, and continued to simulcast newer titles acquired by Crunchyroll, LLC after the merger. 

On February 7, 2024, it was announced that the Funimation app and website would shut down on April 2, 2024, and that all Funimation subscribers could choose to migrate their account data to Crunchyroll until then. As part of the merger of services, legacy Funimation subscribers would see a price increase and users would lose access to their digital library. Following complaints from users, Crunchyroll president Rahul Purini stated that the company would work with customers to provide &quot;appropriate value&quot; for their digital copies.

=== Funimation Channel ===

Funimation Entertainment, along with OlympuSAT, launched the Funimation Channel on September 29, 2005, the second 24-hour anime digital cable network in North America (the first being A.D. Vision&#x27;s Anime Network). OlympuSAT was the exclusive distributor of the channel.

On March 23, 2006, a syndicated block was announced for Colours TV. A few months later, it was announced that the channel was launched in a few cities via VHF and UHF digital signals. Both services were discontinued in favor for a more successful expansion on digital cable, fiber optics and DBS systems. The channel launched its HD feed on September 27, 2010. On December 31, 2015, Funimation and OlympuSAT ended their deal and no longer broadcasts Funimation titles on the channel. The television channel was replaced by Toku, while Funimation announced plans to relaunch Funimation Channel in 2016.

Back in 2007, Funimation licensed &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena: The Movie&quot;, the &quot;Record of Lodoss War&quot; series, the &quot;Project A-ko&quot; series, &quot;Urusei Yatsura: Beautiful Dreamer&quot; and &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; from Central Park Media and played them on the Funimation Channel on television in the United States. In 2009, they licensed &quot;Buso Renkin&quot;, &quot;Honey and Clover&quot;, &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;, &quot;Nana&quot; and &quot;Monster&quot; from Viz Media (their fellow rival) for the channel. They also licensed &quot;Ninja Nonsense&quot; and &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; from Right Stuf Inc.&#x27;s Nozomi Entertainment division for it as well. The only title licensed for Funimation Channel which was not licensed by Funimation, neither Viz Media, nor Nozomi Entertainment or Central Park Media was &quot;Haré+Guu&quot;, which was licensed for North American distribution by AN Entertainment and Bang Zoom! Entertainment and had its North American DVD release published by Funimation, while its licensors were the producers. The only Enoki USA titles Funimation licensed for Funimation Channel were &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot; and &quot;His and Her Circumstances&quot;.

=== Digital ===

Funimation&#x27;s catalog of series and films, as well as official Japanese simulcasts, were available for streaming on their website and dedicated apps. They streamed over 800 titles from their catalog, Aniplex of America, Viz Media, Nozomi Entertainment, NIS America, and TMS Entertainment among other distributors. Their titles were available for streaming in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and by Wakanim they were also available in select parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. Via Crunchyroll, they also have over 5 million subscribers 
and 120 million registered users worldwide with over 1,200 anime titles, 200 dorama, and 80 manga currently available from a wide array of distributors such as Sentai Filmworks and Discotek Media.

On September 19, 2006, Funimation created an official channel on YouTube where they upload advertisements for box sets, as well as clips and preview episodes of their licensed series. In September 2008, they began distributing full episodes of series on Hulu. In April 2009, Funimation began distributing full episodes of series at Veoh. In February 2012, Crackle began streaming select titles from Funimation, joining titles previously acquired from Funimation for their localized Animax hub.

A dedicated Funimation streaming app launched for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in June and December 2014, respectively. The app later launched on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platforms in March and July 2015, respectively. A Nintendo Switch app launched in December 2020.

=== SimulDub ===
In January 2014, English dubbed episodes of &quot;Space Dandy&quot; premiered on Adult Swim&#x27;s Toonami programming block a day before the Japanese broadcast; one of the rare occasions an anime series premiered in the United States before Japan. Funimation would later introduce a new &quot;SimulDub&quot; program in October 2014, in which English dubs of their simulcast titles would premiere within weeks after their subtitled airing. This practice began with SimulDub versions of &quot;Psycho-Pass 2&quot; and &quot;Laughing Under the Clouds&quot;, episodes of which were streamed roughly three weeks to one month following their original Japanese broadcast.

On March 18, 2020, Funimation announced that production of SimulDubs would be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; Subtitled simulcasts would continue as scheduled. On April 10, 2020, Funimation announced that an episode of &quot;My Hero Academia&quot; had been recorded and would be released on April 12. Funimation would later announce the scheduled release dates for SimulDubs that were produced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Following the corporate name change to Crunchyroll, LLC in 2022, the practice of SimulDubs officially continued with series such as &quot;Spy × Family&quot;, the second season of &quot;Classroom of the Elite&quot;, and &quot;Tomo-chan Is a Girl!&quot;.

==Availability==
The streaming service was available through Funimation&#x27;s official website in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Brazil. In select parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia, it was available via Wakanim.

The Funimation app was also available on digital media players (Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku), smart TVs (Android TV, Chromecast, Samsung, and LG Electronics), video game consoles (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch) and smartphones (iOS, Android, and Amazon Kindle).

<doc id="326225" wikidata="Q2413653" url="?curid=326225" title="Technology during World War II">
<text>Technology played a significant role in World War II. Some of the technologies used during the war were developed during the interwar years of the 1920s and 1930s. Many were developed in response to needs and lessons learned during the war, and others were beginning to their development as the war ended. Wars often have major effects on peacetime technologies, but World War II had the greatest effect on the everyday technology and devices that are used today. Technology also played a greater role in the conduct of World War II than in any other war in history, and had a critical role in its outcome.

Many types of technology were customized for military use, and major developments occurred across several fields including:
* Weaponry: ships, vehicles, submarines, aircraft, tanks, artillery, small arms; and biological, chemical, and atomic weapons
* Logistical support: vehicles necessary for transporting soldiers and supplies, such as trains, trucks, tanks, ships, and aircraft
* Communications and intelligence: devices used for remote sensing, navigation, communication, cryptography and espionage
* Medicine: surgical innovations, chemical medicines, and techniques
* Rocketry: guided missiles, medium-range ballistic missiles, and automatic aircraft
Military weapons technology experienced rapid advances during World War II, and over six years there was a disorientating rate of change in combat in everything from aircraft to small arms. Indeed, the war began with most armies using some technology that had changed little from that of World War I, and in some cases, had remained unchanged since the 19th century. For instance cavalry, trenches, and World War I-era battleships were normal in 1940, but six years later, armies around the world had developed jet aircraft, ballistic missiles, and even atomic weapons in the case of the United States.

World War II was the first war where military operations often targeted the research efforts of the enemy. This included the exfiltration of Niels Bohr from German-occupied Denmark to Britain in 1943; the sabotage of Norwegian heavy water production; and the bombing of Peenemunde. Military operations were also conducted to obtain intelligence on the enemy&#x27;s technology; for example, the Bruneval Raid for German radar and Operation Most III for the German V-2.

== Between the Wars ==

In August 1919 the British Ten Year Rule declared the government should not expect another war within ten years. Consequently, they conducted very little military R &amp; D. In contrast, Germany and the Soviet Union were dissatisfied powers who, for different reasons, cooperated with each other on military R &amp; D. The Soviets offered Weimar Germany facilities deep inside the USSR for building and testing arms and for military training, well away from Treaty inspectors&#x27; eyes. In return, they asked for access to German technical developments, and for assistance in creating the Red Army General Staff.
The great artillery manufacturer Krupp was soon active in the south of the USSR, near Rostov-on-Don. In 1925, the Lipetsk fighter-pilot school was established near Lipetsk to train the first pilots for the future Luftwaffe. Since 1926, the Reichswehr used the Kama tank school in Kazan, and tested chemical weapons at the Tomka gas test site in Saratov Oblast. In turn, the Red Army gained access to these training facilities, as well as military technology and theory from Weimar Germany.

In the late 1920s, Germany helped the Soviet industry begin to modernize and to assist in the establishment of tank production facilities at the Leningrad Bolshevik Factory and the Kharkiv Locomotive Factory. This cooperation would break down when Hitler rose to power in 1933. The failure of the World Disarmament Conference marked the beginnings of the arms race leading to war.

In France the lesson of World War I was translated into the Maginot Line which was supposed to hold a line at the border with Germany. The Maginot Line did achieve its political objective of ensuring that any German invasion had to go through Belgium, ensuring that France would have Britain as a military ally. France and Russia had more, and much better, tanks than Germany at the outbreak of their hostilities in 1940. As in World War I, the French generals expected that armour would mostly serve to help infantry break the static trench lines and storm machine gun nests. They thus spread the armour among their infantry divisions, ignoring the new German doctrine of blitzkrieg based on fast, coordinated movement using concentrated armour attacks, against which the only effective defense was mobile anti-tank guns, as the old infantry antitank rifles were ineffective against the new medium and heavy tanks.

Air power was a major concern of Germany and Britain between the wars. The trade in aircraft engines continued, with Britain selling hundreds of its best to German firms – which used them in the first generation of aircraft and much improved them for use in later German aircraft. These new inventions led the way to major success for the Germans in World War II.

As always, Germany was at the forefront of internal combustion engine development. The laboratory of Ludwig Prandtl at University of Göttingen was the world center of aerodynamics and fluid dynamics in general, until its dispersal after the Allied victory. This contributed to the German development of jet aircraft and of submarines with improved underwater performance. Meanwhile, the RAF secretly developed the Chain Home radar and Dowding system for defending against enemy planes.

Induced nuclear fission was discovered in Germany in 1939 by Otto Hahn (and expatriate Jews in Sweden), but many of the scientists needed to develop nuclear power had already been lost, due to Nazi anti-Jewish and anti-intellectual policies.

Scientists have been at the heart of warfare and their contributions have often been decisive. As Ian Jacob, the wartime military secretary of Winston Churchill, famously remarked on the influx of refugee scientists (including 19 Nobel laureates), &quot;the Allies won the [Second World] War because our German scientists were better than their German scientists&quot;.

==Allied cooperation==

The Allies of World War II cooperated extensively in the development and manufacture of existing and new technologies to support military operations and intelligence gathering during the Second World War. There were various ways in which the allies cooperated, including the American Lend-Lease scheme and hybrid weapons such as the Sherman Firefly as well as the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons research project which was absorbed into the American-led Manhattan Project. Several technologies invented in Britain proved critical to the military and were widely manufactured by the Allies during the Second World War.

The origin of the cooperation stemmed from a 1940 visit by the Aeronautical Research Committee chairman Henry Tizard that arranged to transfer U.K. military technology to the U.S. in case of the successful invasion of the U.K. that Hitler was planning as Operation Sea Lion. Tizard led a British technical mission, known as the Tizard Mission, containing details and examples of British technological developments in fields such as radar, jet propulsion and also the early British research into the atomic bomb. One of the devices brought to the U.S. by the Mission, the resonant cavity magnetron, was later described as &quot;the most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores&quot;.

==Vehicles==

The best jet fighters at the end of the war easily outflew any of the leading aircraft of 1939, such as the Spitfire Mark I. The early war bombers that caused such carnage would almost all have been shot down in 1945, many by radar-aimed, proximity fuse-detonated anti-aircraft fire, just as the 1941 &quot;invincible fighter&quot;, the Zero, had by 1944 become the &quot;turkey&quot; of the &quot;Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;. The best late-war tanks, such as the Soviet JS-3 heavy tank or the German Panther medium tank, handily outclassed the best tanks of 1939 such as Panzer IIIs. In the navy the battleship, long seen as the dominant element of sea power, was displaced by the greater range and striking power of the aircraft carrier. The chaotic importance of amphibious landings stimulated the Western Allies to develop the Higgins boat, a primary troop landing craft; the DUKW, a six-wheel-drive amphibious truck, amphibious tanks to enable beach landing attacks and Landing Ship, Tanks to land tanks on beaches. Increased organization and coordination of amphibious assaults coupled with the resources necessary to sustain them caused the complexity of planning to increase by orders of magnitude, thus requiring formal systematization giving rise to what has become the modern management methodology of project management by which almost all modern engineering, construction and software developments are organized.

===Aircraft===

In the Western European Theatre of World War II, air power became crucial throughout the war, both in tactical and strategic operations (respectively, battlefield and long-range). Superior German aircraft, aided by ongoing introduction of design and technology innovations, allowed the German armies to overrun Western Europe with great speed in 1940, assisted by lack of Allied aircraft, which in any case lagged in design and technical development during the slump in research investment after the Great Depression.

Since the end of World War I, the French Air Force had been badly neglected, as military leaders preferred to spend money on ground armies and static fortifications to fight another World War I-style war. As a result, by 1940, the French Air Force had only 1562 planes and was together with 1070 RAF planes facing 5,638 Luftwaffe fighters and fighter-bombers. Most French airfields were located in north-east France, and were quickly overrun in the early stages of the campaign. The Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom possessed some very advanced fighter planes, such as Spitfires and Hurricanes, but these were not useful for attacking ground troops on a battlefield, and the small number of planes dispatched to France with the British Expeditionary Force were destroyed fairly quickly. Subsequently, the Luftwaffe was able to achieve air superiority over France in 1940, giving the German military an immense advantage in terms of reconnaissance and intelligence.

German aircraft rapidly achieved air superiority over France in early 1940, allowing the Luftwaffe to begin a campaign of strategic bombing against British cities. Utilizing France&#x27;s airfields near the English Channel the Germans were able to launch raids on London and other cities during the Blitz, with varying degrees of success.

After World War I, the concept of massed aerial bombing—&quot;The bomber will always get through&quot;—had become very popular with politicians and military leaders seeking an alternative to the carnage of trench warfare, and as a result, the air forces of Britain, France, and Germany had developed fleets of bomber planes to enable this (France&#x27;s bomber wing was severely neglected, whilst Germany&#x27;s bombers were developed in secret as they were explicitly forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles).

Air warfare of World War II began with the bombing of Shanghai by the Imperial Japanese Navy on January 28, 1932, and August 1937. The bombings during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), further demonstrated the power of strategic bombing, and so air forces in Europe and the United States came to view bomber aircraft as extremely powerful weapons which, in theory, could bomb an enemy nation into submission on their own. The resulting fear of bombers triggered major developments in aircraft technology.

The Spanish Civil War had proved that tactical dive-bombing using Stukas was a very efficient way of destroying enemy troops concentrations, and so resources and money had been devoted to the development of smaller bomber craft. As a result, the Luftwaffe was forced to attack London in 1940 with heavily overloaded Heinkel and Dornier medium bombers, and even with the unsuitable Junkers Ju 87. These bombers were painfully slow—engineers had been unable to develop sufficiently large piston aircraft engines (those that were produced tended to explode through extreme overheating), and so the bombers used for the Battle of Britain were woefully undersized. As German bombers had not been designed for long-range strategic missions, they lacked sufficient defenses. The Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter escorts had not been equipped to carry enough fuel to guard the bombers on both the outbound and return journeys, and the longer-range Bf 110s could be outmaneuvered by the short-range British fighters. (A bizarre feature of the war was how long it took to conceive of the Drop tank.) The air defense was well organized and equipped with effective radar that survived the bombing. As a result, German bombers were shot down in large numbers, and were unable to inflict enough damage on cities and military-industrial targets to force Britain out of the war in 1940 or to prepare for the planned invasion. Nazi Germany put into production only one large, long-range strategic bomber (the Heinkel He 177 Greif, with many delays and problems), while the America Bomber concept resulted only in prototypes.

British long-range bomber planes such as the Short Stirling had been designed before 1939 for strategic flights and given a large armament, but their technology still suffered from numerous flaws. The smaller and shorter ranged Bristol Blenheim, the RAF&#x27;s most-used bomber, was defended by only one hydraulically operated machine-gun turret, which was soon revealed to be incapable of defending against squadrons of German fighter planes. American bomber planes such as the B-17 Flying Fortress had been built before the war as the only adequate long-range bombers in the world, designed to patrol the long American coastlines. With six machine-gun turrets providing 360° cover, the B-17s were still vulnerable without fighter protection even when used in large formations.

Despite the abilities of Allied bombers, though, Germany was not quickly crippled by Allied Strategic bombing during World War II. Accuracy was poor and Allied airmen frequently could not find their targets at night. The bombs used by the Allies were very technologically advanced devices, and mass production meant that the precision bombs were often made sloppily and so failed to explode. German industrial production actually rose continuously. Significantly, the bomber offensive kept the revolutionary Type XXI U-Boat from entering service during the war. Moreover, Allied air raids had a serious propaganda impact on the German government, all prompting Germany to begin serious development of air defense technology—in the form of fighter planes.

The practical jet aircraft age began just before the start of the war with the development of the Heinkel He 178, the first true turbojet. Late in the war, the Germans brought in the first operational Jetfighter, the Messerschmitt Me 262(Me 262). However, despite their seeming technological edge, German jets were often hampered by technical problems, such as short engine lives, with the Me 262 having an estimated operating life of just ten hours before failing. German jets were also overwhelmed by Allied air superiority, frequently being destroyed on or near the airstrip. The first and only operational Allied jet fighter of the war, the British Gloster Meteor, saw combat against German V-1 flying bombs but did not significantly distinguish from top-line, late-war piston-driven aircraft.

Aircraft saw rapid and broad development during the war to meet the demands of aerial combat and address lessons learned from combat experience. From the open cockpit airplane to the sleek jet fighter, many different types were employed, often designed for very specific missions. Aircraft were used in anti-submarine warfare against German U-boats, by the Germans to mine shipping lanes and by the Japanese against previously formidable Royal Navy battleships such as .

During the war the Germans produced various glide bombs, which were the first &quot;smart&quot; weapons; the V-1 flying bomb, which was the first cruise missile weapon; and the V-2 rocket, the first ballistic missile weapon. The latter of these was the first step into the space age as its trajectory took it through the stratosphere, higher and faster than any aircraft. This later led to the development of the Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Wernher von Braun led the V-2 development team and later emigrated to the United States where he contributed to the development of the Saturn V rocket, which took men to the moon in 1969.

====Fuel====
The Axis countries had serious shortages of petroleum from which to make liquid fuel. The Allies had much more petroleum production. Germany, long before the war, developed a process to make synthetic fuel from coal. Synthesis factories were principal targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II.

The USA added tetra ethyl lead to its aviation fuel, with which it supplied Britain and other Allies. This octane enhancing additive allowed higher compression ratios, allowing higher efficiency, giving more speed and range to Allied Airplanes, and reducing the cooling load.

===Land vehicles===
The Treaty of Versailles had imposed severe restrictions upon Germany constructing vehicles for military purposes, and so throughout the 1920s and 1930s, German arms manufacturers and the Wehrmacht had begun secretly developing tanks. As these vehicles were produced in secret, their technical specifications and battlefield potentials were largely unknown to the European Allies until the war actually began.

French and British Generals believed that a future war with Germany would be fought under very similar conditions as those of 1914–1918. Both invested in thickly armoured, heavily armed vehicles designed to cross shell-damaged ground and trenches under fire. At the same time the British also developed faster but lightly armoured Cruiser tanks to range behind the enemy lines.

Only a handful of French tanks had radios, and these often broke as the tank lurched over uneven ground. German tanks were, on the contrary, all equipped with radios, allowing them to communicate with one another throughout battles, whilst French tank commanders could rarely contact other vehicles.

The Matilda Mk I tanks of the British Army were also designed for infantry support and were protected by thick armour. This suited trench warfare, but made the tanks painfully slow in open battles. Their light armament was usually unable to inflict serious damage on German vehicles. The exposed caterpillar tracks were easily broken by gunfire, and the Matilda tanks had a tendency to incinerate their crews if hit, as the petrol tanks were located on the top of the hull. By contrast the Infantry tank Matilda II fielded in lesser numbers was largely invulnerable to German gunfire and its gun was able to punch through the German tanks. However French and British tanks were at a disadvantage compared to the air supported German armoured assaults, and a lack of armoured support contributed significantly to the rapid Allied collapse in 1940.

World War II marked the first full-scale war where mechanization played a significant role. Most nations did not begin the war equipped for this. Even the vaunted German Panzer forces relied heavily on non-motorised support and flank units in large operations. While Germany recognized and demonstrated the value of concentrated use of mechanized forces, they never had these units in enough quantity to supplant traditional units. However, the British also saw the value in mechanization. For them it was a way to enhance an otherwise limited manpower reserve. America as well sought to create a mechanized army. For the United States, it was not so much a matter of limited troops, but instead a strong industrial base that could afford such equipment on a great scale.

The most visible vehicles were the tanks of World War II, forming the armored spearhead of mechanized warfare. Their impressive firepower and armor made them the premier fighting machine of ground warfare. However, the large number of trucks and lighter vehicles that kept the infantry, artillery, and others moving were massive undertakings also.

===Ships===
Naval warfare changed dramatically during World War II, with the ascent of the aircraft carrier to the premier vessel of the fleet, and the impact of increasingly capable submarines on the course of the war. The development of new ships during the war was somewhat limited due to the protracted time period needed for production, but important developments were often retrofitted to older vessels. Advanced German submarine types came into service too late and after nearly all the experienced crews had been lost.

In addition to aircraft carriers, its assisting counterpart of destroyers were advanced as well. From the Imperial Japanese Navy, the Fubuki-class destroyer was introduced. The Fubuki class set a new standard not only for Japanese vessels, but for destroyers around the world. At a time when British and American destroyers had changed little from their un-turreted, single-gun mounts and light weaponry, the Japanese destroyers were bigger, more powerfully armed, and faster than any similar class of vessel in the other fleets. The Japanese destroyers of World War II are said to be the world&#x27;s first modern destroyer.

The German U-boats were used primarily for stopping/destroying the resources from the United States and Canada coming across the Atlantic. Submarines were critical in the Pacific Ocean as well as in the Atlantic Ocean. Advances in submarine technology included the snorkel. Japanese defenses against Allied submarines were ineffective. Much of the merchant fleet of the Empire of Japan, needed to supply its scattered forces and bring supplies such as petroleum and food back to the Japanese Archipelago, was sunk. Among the warships sunk by submarines was the war&#x27;s largest aircraft carrier, the &quot;Shinano&quot;.

The Kriegsmarine introduced the pocket battleship to get around constraints imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. Innovations included the use of diesel engines, and welded rather than riveted hulls.

The most important shipboard advances were in the field of anti-submarine warfare. Driven by the desperate necessity of keeping Britain supplied, technologies for the detection and destruction of submarines was advanced at high priority. The use of ASDIC (SONAR) became widespread and so did the installation of shipboard and airborne radar. The Allies Ultra code breaking allowed convoys to be steered around German U-boat wolfpacks.

==Weapons==

The actual weapons (guns, mortars, artillery, bombs, and other devices) were as diverse as the participants and objectives. A large array were developed during the war to meet specific needs that arose, but many traced their early development to prior to World War II.
Torpedoes began to use magnetic detonators; compass-directed, programmed and even acoustic guidance systems; and improved propulsion. Fire-control systems continued to develop for ships&#x27; guns and came into use for torpedoes and anti-aircraft fire. Human torpedoes and the Hedgehog were also developed.

*Armoured vehicles: The tank destroyer, specialist tanks for combat engineering including mine clearing flail tanks, flame tank, and amphibious designs
*Aircraft: glide bombs – the first &quot;smart bombs&quot;, such as the Fritz X anti-shipping missile, had wire or radio remote control; the world&#x27;s first jet fighter (Messerschmitt Me 262) and jet bomber (Arado 234), the world&#x27;s first operational military helicopters (Flettner Fl 282), the world&#x27;s first rocket-powered fighter (Messerschmitt 163)
*Missiles: The pulse jet-powered V-1 flying bomb was the world&#x27;s first cruise missile, Rockets progressed enormously: V-2 rocket, Katyusha rocket artillery and air-launched rockets.
*Specialised bombs: cluster bombs, blockbuster bombs, bouncing bombs, and bunker busters.
*Specialised warheads: high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT), and high-explosive squash head (HESH) for anti-armour and anti-fortification use.
*Proximity fuze for shells, bombs and rockets. This fuze is designed to detonate an explosive automatically when close enough to the target to destroy it, so a direct hit is not required and time/place of closest approach does not need to be estimated. Some torpedoes and mines used a magnetic pistol, a sort of proximity fuze that was not perfected during the war.
*Guided weapons (by radio or trailing wires): glide bombs, crawling bombs and rockets – the precursors of today&#x27;s precision-guided munitions existed between 1942 and 1945, in the German Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship ordnance designs, which along with the American Azon, were all MCLOS radio-guided ordnance designs in World War II service.
*Self-guiding weapons: torpedoes (sound-seeking, compass-guided and looping), V1 missile (compass- and timer-guided), and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bat air-launched anti-ship glide ordnance, using active radar homing for the first time anywhere.
*Aiming devices for bombs, torpedoes, artillery and machine guns, using special purpose mechanical and electronic analog and (perhaps) digital &quot;computers&quot;. The mechanical analog Norden bomb sight is a well-known example.
*The first generation of nerve agents was invented and produced in Germany, but wasn&#x27;t used as a weapon
*Napalm was developed, but did not see wide use until the Korean War
*Plastic explosives like Nobel 808, Hexoplast 75, Compositions C and C2

===Small arms development===
New production methods for weapons such as stamping, riveting, and welding came into being to produce the number of arms needed. Design and production methods had advanced enough to manufacture weapons of reasonable reliability such as the PPSh-41, PPS-42, Sten, Beretta Model 38, MP 40, M3 &quot;Grease Gun&quot;, Gewehr 43, Thompson submachine gun and the M1 Garand rifle. Other Weapons commonly found during World War II include the American, Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), M1 Carbine Rifle, as well as the Colt M1911 A-1; The Japanese Type 11, the Type 96 machine gun, and the Arisaka bolt-action rifles all were significant weapons used during the war.

World War II saw the establishment of the reliable semi-automatic rifle, such as the American M1 Garand and, more importantly, of the first widely used assault rifles, named after the German &quot;sturmgewehrs&quot; of the late war. Earlier renditions that hinted at this idea were that of the employment of the Browning Automatic Rifle and 1916 Fedorov Avtomat in a &quot;walking fire&quot; tactic in which men would advance on the enemy position showering it with a hail of lead. The Germans first developed the FG 42 for its paratroopers in the assault and later the Sturmgewehr 44 (StG 44), the world&#x27;s first assault rifle, firing an intermediate cartridge; the FG 42&#x27;s use of a full-powered rifle cartridge made it difficult to control.

Developments in machine gun technology culminated in the Maschinengewehr 42 (MG42) which was of an advanced design unmatched at the time. It spurred post-war development on both sides of the upcoming Cold War and is still used by some armies to this day including the German Bundeswehr&#x27;s MG 3. The Heckler &amp; Koch G3, and many other Heckler &amp; Koch designs, came from its system of operation. The United States military meshed the operating system of the FG 42 with the belt feed system of the MG42 to create the M60 machine gun used in the Vietnam War.

Despite being overshadowed by self-loading/automatic rifles and sub-machine guns, bolt-action rifles remained the mainstay infantry weapon of many nations during World War II. When the United States entered World War II, there were not enough M1 Garand rifles available to American forces which forced the US to start producing more M1903 rifles in order to act as a &quot;stop gap&quot; measure until sufficient quantities of M1 Garands were produced.

During the conflict, many new models of bolt-action rifle were produced as a result of lessons learned from the First World War, with the designs of a number of bolt-action infantry rifles being modified in order to speed production and to make the rifles more compact and easier to handle. Examples include the German Mauser Kar98k, the British Lee–Enfield No.4, and the Springfield M1903A3. During the course of World War II, bolt-action rifles and carbines were modified even further to meet new forms of warfare the armies of certain nations faced e.g. urban warfare and jungle warfare. Examples include the Soviet Mosin–Nagant M1944 carbine, developed by the Soviets as a result of the Red Army&#x27;s experiences with urban warfare e.g. the Battle of Stalingrad, and the British Lee–Enfield No.5 carbine, developed for British and Commonwealth forces fighting the Japanese in South-East Asia and the Pacific.

When World War II ended in 1945, the small arms that were used in the conflict still saw action in the hands of the armed forces of various nations and guerrilla movements during and after the Cold War era. Nations like the Soviet Union and the United States provided many surplus, World War II-era small arms to a number of nations and political movements during the Cold War era as a pretext to providing more modern infantry weapons.

===Atomic bomb===

The discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, made the development of an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility. The prospect that a German atomic bomb project would develop one first alarmed scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries. In Britain, Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, working under Mark Oliphant at the University of Birmingham, made a breakthrough investigating the critical mass of uranium-235 in June 1939. Their calculations indicated that it was within an order of magnitude of , which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum prompted the creation of the MAUD Committee to investigate. A directorate known as Tube Alloys was established in the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research under Wallace Akers to pursue the development of an atomic bomb.

In July 1940, Britain offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, and the Tizard Mission&#x27;s John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that although an American atomic bomb project already existed, it was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. Oliphant flew to the United States in late August 1941 and spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence and other key American physicists about the feasibility and potential power of an atomic bomb.

Between 1942 and 1946, the American project was under the direction of Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr. of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The Army component of the project was designated the &quot;Manhattan District&quot; as its first headquarters were in Manhattan; this name gradually superseded the official codename, Development of Substitute Materials, for the entire project. The British and American projects were merged with the Quebec Agreement in August 1943, and a British mission joined Manhattan Project&#x27;s sites in the United States.
The Manhattan Project began modestly, but grew to employ nearly 130,000 people at its peak. Due to high turnover, over 500,000 people worked on the project. Three entire secret cities were built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Richland, Washington, and Los Alamos, New Mexico. The Manhattan Project cost nearly US$2 billion (equivalent to about $ billion in ). Over 90 percent of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material, with less than 10 percent for development and production of the weapons. It was the second most expensive weapons project undertaken by the United States in World War II, behind only the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber.

The fissile Uranium-235 isotope makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. Because it is chemically identical to the most common isotope, uranium-238, and has almost the same mass, separating the two proved challenging. Three methods were employed for uranium enrichment: electromagnetic, gaseous and thermal. This work was carried out at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In parallel was an effort to produce plutonium, which was theorised to also be fissile, and could be produced by the nuclear transmutation of uranium in a nuclear reactor. The feasibility of a nuclear reactor was demonstrated in 1942 at the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago with the start up of Chicago Pile-1. A pilot reactor, the X-10 Graphite Reactor, was constructed at the Clinton Engineer Works, and three production reactors were built at the Hanford Engineer Works in Washington state.

Work on weapon design was carried out by Project Y at Los Alamos under the direction of Robert Oppenheimer. The Manhattan Project pursued the development of two types of atomic bombs concurrently: a relatively simple gun-type fission weapon known as Thin Man and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon known as Fat Man. The gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium, so effort was concentrated on the implosion design. A simpler gun-type called Little Boy was then developed that used highly enriched uranium. Atomic bombs were then employed against the Japan in August 1945.

The German nuclear weapon project failed for a variety of reasons, most notably insufficient resources, time, and a lack of official interest in a project unlikely to yield results before the war ended. The leading nuclear physicist in Germany was Werner Heisenberg. Other key figures in the German project included Manfred von Ardenne, Walther Bothe, Kurt Diebner and Otto Hahn. The Japanese nuclear weapon program also floundered due to lack of resources despite gaining interest from the government.

==Electronics, communications and intelligence==

Electronics rose to prominence quickly. Blitzkrieg was highly effective early in the war, with all German tanks having a radio. Enemy forces quickly learned from their defeats, discarded their obsolete tactics, and installed radios.

Combat Information Centers on ships and aircraft established networked computing, later essential to civilian life. While prior to the war few electronic devices were seen as important to war, by the middle of the war instruments such as the radar and ASDIC (sonar) had become invaluable. Germany started the war ahead in some aspects of radar, but lost ground to research and development of the cavity magnetron in Britain and to later work at the &quot;Radiation Laboratory&quot; of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Half of the German theoretical physicists were Jewish and had emigrated or otherwise been lost to Germany long before WW II started.

Equipment designed for communications and the interception of communications became critical. World War II cryptography became an important application, and the newly developed machine ciphers, mostly rotor machines, were widespread. By the end of 1940, the Germans had broken most American and all British military ciphers except the Enigma-based Typex.

The Germans in turn widely relied on their own variants of the Enigma coding machine for encrypting operations communications, and Lorenz cipher for strategic messages. The British developed a new method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. Later, they also accomplished the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher. The meticulous work of code breakers based at Britain&#x27;s Bletchley Park played a crucial role in the final defeat of Germany.

German radio intelligence operations during World War II were extensive. The intercept part of signals intelligence was for the most part successful but success in cryptanalysis depended in large part on loose discipline in enemy radio operations.

Americans also used electronic computers for equations, such as battlefield equations, ballistics, and more. The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) machine was the first general purpose computer, built in 1945. Previously, human computers would spend hours solving these equations. However, there were not enough mathematicians to handle the many ballistic equations that needed to be solved. The resulting Von Neumann architecture later became the basis of general-purpose computers.

==Rocketry==

Rocketry was used greatly in World War II. There were many different inventions and advances in rocketry, such as the following.

The &quot;V-1&quot;, which is also known as the buzz bomb. This automatic aircraft would be known as a &quot;cruise missile&quot; today. The V-1 was developed at Peenemünde Army Research Center by the Nazi German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the Second World War. During initial development it was known by the codename &quot;Cherry Stone&quot;. The first of the so-called &quot;Vergeltungswaffen&quot; series designed for terror bombing of London, the V-1 was fired from launch facilities along the French (Pas-de-Calais) and Dutch coasts. The first V-1 was launched at London on 13 June 1944), one week after (and prompted by) the successful Allied landings in Europe. At its peak, more than one hundred V-1s a day were fired at south-east England, 9,521 in total, decreasing in number as sites were overrun until October 1944, when the last V-1 site in range of Britain was overrun by Allied forces. After this, the V-1s were directed at the port of Antwerp and other targets in Belgium, with 2,448 V-1s being launched. The attacks stopped when the last launch site was overrun on 29 March 1945.

The &quot;V-2&quot; (German: &quot;Vergeltungswaffe 2&quot;, &quot;Retribution Weapon 2&quot;), technical name &quot;Aggregat-4&quot; (&quot;A-4&quot;), was the world&#x27;s first long-range guided ballistic missile. The missile with liquid-propellant rocket engine was developed during the Second World War in Germany as a &quot;vengeance weapon&quot;, designed to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings of German cities. The V-2 rocket was also the first artificial object to cross the boundary of space.

These two rocketry advances took the lives of many civilians in London during 1944 and 1945.

==Medicine==
Penicillin was first developed, mass-produced and used during the war. The widespread use of mepacrine (Atabrine) for the prevention of malaria, sulfanilamide, blood plasma, and morphine were also among the chief wartime medical advancements. Advances in the treatment of burns, including the use of skin grafts, mass immunization for tetanus and improvements in gas masks also took place during the war. The use of metal plates to help heal fractures began during the war.

<doc id="326227" wikidata="Q6542695" url="?curid=326227" title="Library of Sir Thomas Browne">
<text>The 1711 Sales Auction Catalogue of the Library of Sir Thomas Browne highlights the erudition of the physician, philosopher and encyclopedist, Sir Thomas Browne (1605-1682). It also illustrates the proliferation, distribution and availability of books printed throughout 17th century Europe which were purchased by the intelligentsia, aristocracy, priest, physician and educated merchant-class.

==Biography==
Browne graduated from the University of Leiden in 1633 having previously studied at the Universities of Montpellier and Padua for his medical degree. Upon his establishment in Norwich as a physician in 1637 he was able to begin a lifetime&#x27;s bibliophilia, building a private library, acquiring and reading an estimated 1,500 titles. He was adept in five contemporary languages: French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Danish; these languages as well as Greek and Hebrew and the predominant written form of the Renaissance, namely Latin, are all represented in his Library.

==The catalogue==
The &quot;1711 Sales Auction Catalogue&quot; reflects the wide scope of Browne&#x27;s interests. It includes many of the sources of his encyclopaedia &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot; which went through six editions (1646 to 1672); and established him as one of the leading intellects of 17th-century Europe.

Browne&#x27;s erudite learning is reflected by the Classics of antiquity as well as history, geography, philology, philosophy, anatomy, theology, cartography, embryology, medicine, cosmography, ornithology, mineralogy, zoology, travel, law, mathematics, geometry, literature, both Continental and English, the latest advances in scientific thinking in astronomy, chemistry as well as esoteric topics such as astrology, alchemy, physiognomy and the Kabbalah are all represented in the &quot;Catalogue&quot; of his library contents. It was however not until 1986 that the &quot;Catalogue&quot; was first made widely available. The American scholar Jeremiah Stanton Finch, Dean Emeritus at Princeton University took on the task of indexing Browne&#x27;s work during his retirement, completing the indexing of the books of Sir Thomas and his son Edward Browne&#x27;s libraries, &quot;after many years in many libraries&quot;. Finch noted that the &quot;Catalogue&quot; advertised books of sculpture and painting, which somehow were never delivered to the auction house. In the event, the auction held upon 8–10 January 1711 was attended by Jonathan Swift and buyers working on behalf of Sir Hans Sloane. Thus an unknown percentage of books auctioned from the Library of Sir Thomas Browne subsequently formed the foundation for the future British Library.

The &quot;1711 Sales Auction Catalogue&quot; records the omnivorous reading and bibliophilia which Browne engaged upon for roughly sixty years, it also exemplifies the observation:

:&quot;to the student of the history of ideas in its modern sense of the inter-relationship between science, art and philosophy, Browne is of great importance&quot;.

<text>Austerlitz () is a village in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is a part of the municipality of Zeist, and lies about 6 km east of Zeist.

== History ==
In 1804, an army camp was established at the site, called French camp. The town was founded on 17 August 1806 on the location of the camp. It was given its name by King Louis Napoleon of Holland in honour of the victory of his brother, emperor Napoleon in the Battle of Austerlitz. In 1840, it was home to 233 people.

Close to the town, there is an artificial hill called the Pyramid of Austerlitz (), actually part of the municipality Woudenberg. It used to have a wooden obelisk, but was removed in 1808 due to instability. In 1894, a stone obelisk was added to the top.

<text>A takeout (US, Canada, Philippines) or takeaway (UK, Ireland, Commonwealth) is a prepared meal or other food items purchased at a restaurant or fast food outlet with the intent to eat elsewhere. A concept found in many ancient cultures, take-out food is common worldwide, with a number of different cuisines and dishes on offer.

==History==

The concept of prepared meals to be eaten elsewhere dates back to antiquity. Market and roadside stalls selling food were common in Ancient Greece and Rome. In Pompeii, archaeologists have found a number of &quot;thermopolia&quot;, service counters opening onto the street which provided food to be taken away. There is a distinct lack of formal dining and kitchen area in Pompeian homes, which may suggest that eating, or at least cooking, at home was unusual. Over 200 &quot;thermopolia&quot; have been found in the ruins of Pompeii.

In the cities of medieval Europe, a number of street vendors sold take-out food. In medieval London, street vendors sold hot meat pies, geese, sheep&#x27;s feet and French wine, while in Paris roasted meats, squab, tarts and flans, cheeses and eggs were available. A large strata of society would have purchased food from these vendors, but they were especially popular amongst the urban poor, who would have lacked kitchen facilities in which to prepare their own food. However, these vendors often had a bad reputation, often being in trouble with city authorities reprimanding them for selling infected meat or reheated food. The cooks of Norwich often defended themselves in court against selling such things as &quot;pokky pies&quot; and &quot;stynkyng mackerelles&quot;. In 10th and 11th century China, citizens of cities such as Kaifeng and Hangzhou were able to buy pastries such as &quot;yuebing&quot; and &quot;congyoubing&quot; to take away. By the early 13th century, the two most successful such shops in Kaifeng had &quot;upwards of fifty ovens&quot;. A traveling Florentine reported in the late 14th century that in Cairo, people carried picnic cloths made of rawhide to spread on the streets and eat their meals of lamb kebabs, rice and fritters that they had purchased from street vendors. In Renaissance Turkey, many crossroads saw vendors selling &quot;fragrant bites of hot meat&quot;, including chicken and lamb that had been spit roasted.

Aztec marketplaces had vendors that sold beverages such as &quot;atole&quot; (&quot;a gruel made from maize dough&quot;), almost 50 types of tamales (with ingredients that ranged from the meat of turkey, rabbit, gopher, frog, and fish, fruit, eggs, and maize flowers), as well as insects and stews. After Spanish colonization of Peru and importation of European food stocks including wheat, sugarcane and livestock, most commoners continued primarily to eat their traditional diets, but did add grilled beef hearts sold by street vendors. Some of Lima&#x27;s 19th century street vendors such as &quot;Erasmo, the &#x27;negro&#x27; sango vendor&quot; and Na Aguedita are still remembered today.
During the American colonial period, street vendors sold &quot;pepper pot soup&quot; (tripe) &quot;oysters, roasted corn ears, fruit and sweets&quot;, with oysters being a low-priced commodity until the 1910s when overfishing caused prices to rise. In 1707, after previous restrictions that had limited their operating hours, street food vendors had been banned in New York City. Many women of African descent made their living selling street foods in America in the 18th and 19th centuries; with products ranging from fruit, cakes and nuts in Savannah, Georgia, to coffee, biscuits, pralines and other sweets in New Orleans. In the 19th century, street food vendors in Transylvania sold gingerbread-nuts, cream mixed with corn, and bacon and other meat fried on tops of ceramic vessels with hot coals inside.

The Industrial Revolution saw an increase in the availability of take-out food. By the early 20th century, fish and chips was considered an &quot;established institution&quot; in Britain. The hamburger was introduced to America around this time. The diets of industrial workers were often poor, and these meals provided an &quot;important component&quot; to their nutrition. In India, local businesses and cooperatives, had begun to supply workers in the city of Mumbai (Bombay) with tiffin boxes by the end of the 19th century.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to many restaurants closing their indoor dining spaces and only offering take-out.

==Business operation==

Take-out food can be purchased from restaurants that also provide sit-down table service or from establishments specialising in food to be taken away. Providing a take-out service saves operators the cost of cutlery, crockery and pay for servers and hosts; it also allows many customers to be served quickly, without restricting sales by remaining to eat their food.

===Street food===

Although once popular in Europe and America, street food declined in popularity in the 20th century. In part, this can be attributed to a combination of the proliferation of specialized takeaway restaurants and legislation relating to health and safety. Vendors selling street food are still common in parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, with the annual turnover of street food vendors in Bangladesh and Thailand being described as particularly important to the local economy.

===Drive-through===
In the United States, many restaurants and take-out establishments offer drive-through or &quot;drive-thru&quot; outlets that allow customers to order, pay for, and receive food without leaving their cars. The idea was pioneered in 1931 in a California fast food restaurant, &quot;Pig Stand Number 21&quot;. By 1988, 51% of McDonald&#x27;s turnover was being generated by drive-throughs, with 31% of all US take-out turnover being generated by them by 1990.

=== Food delivery ===

Some take-out businesses offer prepared food for delivery, which usually involves contacting a local restaurant by telephone or online. In countries including Australia, Canada, India, Brazil, Japan, much of the European Union and the United States, food can be ordered online from a menu, then picked up by the customer or delivered by the restaurant or a third party delivery service. The industry has kept pace with technological developments since the 1980s, beginning with the rise of the personal computer and continuing with the rise of mobile devices and online delivery applications. Specialized computer software for food delivery helps determine the most efficient routes for carriers, track order and delivery times, manage calls and orders with PoS software, and other functions. Since 2008 satellite navigation tracking technology has been used for real-time monitoring of delivery vehicles by customers over the Internet.
A restaurant can either maintain its own delivery personnel or use third parties who contract with restaurants to not only deliver food orders but also assist in marketing and providing order-taking technology. The field has seen rapid growth since the late 2000s with the spread of the smart phones and apps enabling customers to order from their mobile devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haddon &amp; Jargon, WSJ 3/9/2019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2024 it was reported, that food delivery companies in the United States and Europe had amassed more than $20bn in combined operating losses. The shares of Deliveroo, Just Eat Takeaway, Delivery Hero, and DoorDash were therefore trading below the value that was delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some businesses offer a guarantee to deliver within a predetermined period of time, with late deliveries not charged for. For example, Domino&#x27;s Pizza had a commercial campaign in the 1980s and early 1990s for its pizza delivery service which promised &quot;30 minutes or it&#x27;s free&quot;. This was discontinued in the United States in 1993 due to the number of lawsuits arising from accidents caused by hurried delivery drivers.

==Packaging==
Take-out food is packaged in paper, paperboard, corrugated fiberboard, plastic, or foam food containers. One common container is the oyster pail, a folded, waxed or plastic coated, paperboard container. The oyster pail was quickly adopted, especially in the West, for &quot;Chinese takeout&quot;.

In Britain, old newspapers were traditionally used for wrapping fish and chips until this was banned for health reasons in the 1980s. Many people are nostalgic for this traditional wrapping; some modern fish and chip shops wrap their food in faux-newspaper, food-safe paper printed to look like a newspaper.

Corrugated fiberboard and foam containers are to some extent self-insulating, and can be used for other foods. Thermal bags and other insulated shipping containers keep food hot (or cold) more effectively for longer.

Aluminium containers are also popular for take-out packaging due to their low cost. Expanded polystyrene is often used for hot drinks containers and food trays because it is lightweight and heat-insulating.

All types of container can be produced with supplier information and design to create a brand identity.

==Disposable serviceware waste==
Packaging of fast food and take-out food is necessary for the customer but involves a significant amount of material that ends up in landfills, recycling, composting, or litter. Foam containers for fast-food were the target of environmentalists in the U.S. and were largely replaced with paper wrappers among large restaurant chains.

In 2002, Taiwan began taking action to reduce the use of disposable tableware at institutions and businesses, and to reduce the use of plastic bags. Yearly, the nation of 17.7 million people was producing 59,000 tons of disposable tableware waste and 105,000 tons of waste plastic bags, and increasing measures have been taken in the years since then to reduce the amount of waste. In 2013, Taiwan&#x27;s Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) banned outright the use of disposable tableware in the nation&#x27;s 968 schools, government agencies, and hospitals. The ban was expected to eliminate 2,600 metric tons of waste yearly.

In Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, laws banning the use of disposable food and drink containers at large-scale events have been enacted. Such a ban has been in place in Munich, Germany since 1991, applying to all city facilities and events. This includes events of all sizes, including very large ones (Christmas market, Auer-Dult Faire, Oktoberfest and Munich City Marathon). For small events of a few hundred people, the city has arranged for a corporation to offer rental of crockery and dishwasher equipment. In part through this regulation, Munich reduced the waste generated by Oktoberfest, which attracts millions of people, from 11,000 metric tons in 1990 to 550 tons in 1999.

China, by virtue of the size of its population and the surging popularity of food delivery apps, such as Meituan and Ele.me, faces significant challenges disposing of or recycling takeout food packaging waste.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhong and Zhang, NYT 5/28/2019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2018 study published in &quot;Resources, Conservation and Recycling&quot;, for the first half of 2017, Chinese consumers ordered 4.6 billion takeout meals, generating &quot;significant environmental concerns&quot;. The study&#x27;s authors estimated that packaging waste from food delivery grew from 20,000 metric tons in 2015 to 1.5 million metric tons in 2017. In 2018, Meituan reported making over 6.4 billion food deliveries, up from 4 billion a year earlier.

Because takeout and delivery meals in China include single-use chopsticks, which are made from wood or bamboo, the growth in food delivery also has an impact on China&#x27;s forests. China produces about 80 billion pairs of single-use chopsticks yearly, the equivalent of 20 million 20-year-old trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gates, 3/11/2019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; About 45 percent are made from trees – mainly cottonwood, birch, and spruce, the remainder being made from bamboo. Japan uses about 24 billion pairs of these disposables per year, and globally about 80 billion pairs are thrown away by an estimated 1.4 billion people. In 2013 in Japan, one pair of disposable chopsticks cost US$0.02. One pair of reusable chopsticks cost $1.17, and each pair could be used 130 times. A cost of $1.17 per pair divided by 130 uses comes to $0.009 (0.9¢) per use, less than half the cost of disposable. Campaigns in several countries to reduce this waste are beginning to have some effect.

Following a short regency by the Kingdom of Prussia (1791–1810) the region fell to Bavaria in 1810. The district was established in 1852. In the Bavarian communal reforms of 1972 it was merged with parts of the dissolved districts of Naila, Münchberg, Kronach and Rehau.

==Geography==
The Saxon Saale river originates in the south of the district, on the slopes of the Fichtel Mountains. From here it runs northwards, its valley separating the Fichtel Mountains in the east and the lower Franconian Forest hills in the west.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays two lions. They are from the arms of the counties of Weida and Nuremberg, who subsequently ruled over the region in the early Middle Ages.

<text>Olivier Assayas (; born 25 January 1955) is a French film director, screenwriter and film critic. Assayas is known for his eclectic filmography, consisting of slow-burning period pieces, psychological thrillers, neo-noirs, and comedies. He has directed French, Spanish, and English-language films with international casts. The son of filmmaker Jacques Rémy, Assayas began his career as a critic for &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;. There he wrote about world cinema and its film auteurs, who later influenced his work. Assayas made several short films, and made his feature debut with &quot;Disorder&quot; in 1986.

He continued directing feature films, with &quot;Cold Water&quot; (1994) considered a breakthrough film in his career. It was his first film to screen at the Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section. His followup film, &quot;Irma Vep&quot; (1996), also screened at Cannes, while &quot;Sentimental Destinies&quot; (2000), &quot;Demonlover&quot; (2002), and &quot;Clean&quot; (2004) all officially competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or. In 2006, he contributed a short film to the anthology film &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot; (2006). 

Assayas gained acclaim for his dramas &quot;Summer Hours&quot; (2008), &quot;Clouds of Sils Maria&quot; (2014), and &quot;Personal Shopper&quot; (2016); the latter won him the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director. He also directed the comedy &quot;Non-Fiction&quot; (2018) and the spy thriller &quot;Wasp Network&quot; (2019).

==Life and career==
Assayas was born in Paris, France, the son of French director/screenwriter Raymond Assayas, alias Jacques Rémy, and Catherine de Károlyi, a fashion designer. His father was of Turkish-Jewish origin and had settled in Italy before France. His mother was Protestant and of Hungarian origin. 

Assayas started his career in the industry by helping his father. He ghostwrote episodes for TV shows his father was working on when his health failed. In a 2010 interview, Assayas said his main political influences when growing up were Guy Debord and George Orwell. Of the 1968 May uprising to overthrow Charles de Gaulle, Assayas said: &quot;I was defined by the politics of May &#x27;68, but for me May &#x27;68 was an anti-totalitarian uprising. People seemed to forget that at the occupied Odéon theater, you had crossed flags-black and red, and I was on the side of the black element.&quot;

Assayas&#x27;s biggest hit to date is &quot;Irma Vep&quot;, starring Maggie Cheung. It is a tribute to both French director Louis Feuillade and Hong Kong cinema.

While working at &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, Assayas wrote lovingly about both European and Asian film directors he admired. He has made a documentary, &quot;HHH: A Portrait of Hou Hsiao-hsien&quot;, about Taiwanese filmmaker Hou Hsiao-hsien.

Assayas married Cheung in 1998. They divorced in 2001, but their relationship remained amicable. In 2004, she starred in his film &quot;Clean&quot;.

He met actress-director Mia Hansen-Løve when Hansen-Løve, 17 at the time, starred in Assayas&#x27;s 1998 feature &quot;Late August, Early September&quot;. He has said they &quot;didn&#x27;t get together until [she] was 20&quot;. They separated in 2017.

In 2009 and 2010, Assayas signed two petitions in support of director Roman Polanski, who had been detained in Switzerland while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges in the United States and had long been in exile from the U.S. The first petition argued that the detention would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot;. It said that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door &quot;for actions of which no-one can know the effects&quot;.

Assayas directed and co-wrote the 2010 French television miniseries &quot;Carlos&quot;, about the life of the terrorist Ilich Ramírez Sánchez. Venezuelan actor Édgar Ramírez won the César Award for Most Promising Actor in 2011 for his performance as Carlos.

In April 2011, it was announced that Assayas would be a member of the jury for the main competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.

Assayas&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Something in the Air&quot; was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. Assayas won the Osella for Best Screenplay at Venice. His 2014 film &quot;Clouds of Sils Maria&quot; was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. 

&quot;Sils Maria&quot; won the Louis Delluc Prize and garnered six César Award nominations, including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. Kristen Stewart won a César Award for Best Supporting Actress. 

In 2016, Assayas won Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival) for &quot;Personal Shopper&quot;, which also starred Stewart.

In June 2017, it was announced that Assayas would preside over the 2017 Locarno Film Festival.

==Style and influences==
In an interview with Nick Pinkerton of &quot;Reverse Shot&quot;, Assayas talked about his influences:

In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; directors&#x27; poll, Assayas listed his ten favorite films as &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot;, &quot;Ludwig&quot;, &quot;A Man Escaped&quot;, &quot;Mirror&quot;, &quot;Napoléon&quot;, &quot;Playtime&quot;, &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;, &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, and &quot;Van Gogh&quot;.

<doc id="326242" wikidata="Q676633" url="?curid=326242" title="Blue Gender">
<text>Blue Gender is a Japanese anime television series created by Ryōsuke Takahashi, the creator of &quot;Armored Trooper Votoms&quot; and &quot;Gasaraki&quot;, broadcast in Japan from 1999 to 2000 and spanning 26 episodes. &quot;Blue Gender&quot; was animated by the Japanese studio AIC and distributed in the United States by Funimation - one of the company&#x27;s first non-&quot;Dragon Ball&quot; licenses. In 2003, &quot;Blue Gender&quot; was released on American television as part of Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim block, though it had originally been planned for a Toonami broadcast, and was thus edited to remove more of its graphic violence, nudity, and sex scenes than usual, even for Adult Swim&#x27;s standards. However, it aired uncut on the Funimation Channel in the United States.

&quot;Blue Gender&quot; is set in the 2030s, in which Earth has been overrun by the Blue-alien insectoid creatures containing a newly evolved B-cell, that kill and harvest humans for food. Most of the surviving human race has moved to Second Earth, a huge space station that orbits the planet. The series focuses on the relationship between Yuji—a human who also possesses the B-cells, and Marlene—a soldier from Second Earth, as they work together to return to Second Earth and subsequently participate in military operations against the Blue.

The series was followed by Blue Gender: The Warrior, a compilation movie with an alternative ending, in 2002. &quot;Blue Gender&quot; was also broadcast in the United Kingdom from 2002 to 2003 on the Sci Fi Channel.

==Plot==

In 2009, Yuji Kaido is an average young adult male diagnosed with a serious disease (the &quot;B-cells&quot;) and is put into cryogenic stasis until a cure is found. Twenty-two years later, he is awakened in the midst of a raging war between armored soldiers and insectoid beings called the &quot;Blue&quot; which have overrun the Earth.

The soldiers are from an orbiting space colony collectively called Second Earth and were ordered to recover &quot;sleepers&quot; around the Earth. Among them is Marlene Angel, who at first appears to be heartless toward others. On the journey to Second Earth, Yuji meets many of the humans that were left behind during the evacuation due to limited resources. Standing orders for Marlene and the other troops are to consider any human survivors on the surface to be already dead, which greatly troubles Yuji.

On their journey, all of the soldiers are killed except for Marlene, causing Yuji to fall into a deep depression as he recognizes the destruction around him and his own inability to save those he cares about. During their travel to Baikonur space base through the mountains, Yuji and Marlene start to develop a bond that softens her sharp edges.

Upon reaching Baikonur, Yuji and Marlene come across another group of soldiers and devise a battle plan to get back to Second Earth. During the operation, Marlene becomes the last surviving pilot and is about to be completely overrun by the Blue. However, just when she is going to self-detonate her Armored Shrike, Yuji, determined not to leave her behind, comes to her rescue with a team of reprogrammed automaton attack sentries. Marlene is overwhelmed by Yuji&#x27;s efforts to save her. During the shuttle flight to Second Earth, the two expose their emotions for each other, but they are abruptly interrupted when a mutated Blue that had had hid in the shuttle attacks Yuji, critically injuring him.

Yuji and Marlene are separated upon arriving at Second Earth, and Marlene is sent back into training at the education station. Not knowing what happened after he was attacked, Marlene rebels and is bent on finding Yuji. When she does, she finds he has healed and is being trained to use a new specialized &quot;sleeper&quot;-specific Armour Shrike (AS) called the &quot;Double Edge&quot;, a battlesuit that is much stronger than the originals used in the war against the Blue. It is revealed that Yuji&#x27;s illness is the key to destroying the Blue and taking back the planet. He and the other &quot;Sleepers&quot; have &quot;B-cells&quot; which are also the genetic makeup of the Blue.

After intensive training, Yuji and Marlene return to Earth with two other Sleepers named Tony Frost and Alicia Whistle. Tony is an inexperienced AS pilot, but his B-cells give him great AS skills. Alicia is only a young teenager with no combat experience and not much sense of what is going on around her. They and the other forces of Second Earth battle the Blue, successfully destroying a few of the largest nests before they return to Second Earth. However, the battles begin to have a negative effect on Yuji, who has very little regard for human life and is completely obsessed with being better than Tony at killing the Blue. Yuji&#x27;s actions deeply concern Marlene and she begins to realize something is wrong.

Shortly after returning to Second Earth, the High Council orders the Sleepers on a second offensive against the Blue. Marlene becomes separated from Yuji once again, but in his current state, he does not seem to care. As the Sleepers are carrying out their mission, a battle on Second Earth between two factions is waged. Seno Miyagi, director of Second Earth&#x27;s science division, leads the &quot;Ark&quot; rebellion and seizes control of the military, lunar resources, and education stations of Second Earth from the High Council, who escape to and retains control of the medical station. Marlene learns about the nature of the illness that put Yuji in stasis, the source of his abilities, and the source of the Blue: they are a defense mechanism enacted by the Earth to purge the existence of humanity, and the B-cells that exist in the Sleepers could become a potential threat to humanity as well.

After the Ark successfully takes over Second Earth from the High Council, Marlene heads down to Earth in search of Yuji. When she finds him, his B-cells are already beginning to activate, and he begins to go berserk as a killing machine. After struggling with him, Marlene is finally able to get through to Yuji and helps him overcome his madness by showing her human emotions and feelings for him. Meanwhile, Tony and an unknowing Alicia have also abandoned the remaining ground forces. The troops fend off waves of Blue before escaping with the few remaining survivors. Tony and a now brainwashed Alicia also eventually return to Second Earth but bring with them several Blue when they board the medical station.

When Yuji and Marlene return to Second Earth, they find that Tony plans to ram the medical station into the military station, which would therefore destroy the heart of Second Earth. He sees this as the &quot;Grand Will of the Earth&quot;, in which he will become a &quot;messiah&quot; and cleanse the planet of humanity forever. However, Yuji, Marlene, and a group of other soldiers infiltrate the station and manage to free Alicia&#x27;s mind after injuring her. Later, Yuji and Marlene confront and eliminate Tony, while Rick, a close friend of theirs, is slaughtered by a Blue. Alicia ventures back to Tony to die with him as the military destroys the medical station.

After the decision by Seno&#x27;s junta to abandon Earth, Yuji becomes depressed and contemplates his existence, wondering what he has been fighting for, why he was woken, why he cannot save his friends, and what is truly Earth&#x27;s will. However, Marlene again is able to get through to Yuji; the two realize they need each other, and finally become lovers.

Yuji decides to return to Earth to find out what Earth&#x27;s will is. After learning from Seno about a new migration pattern of the Blue, Yuji and Marlene take a group of volunteers and head to an area where a massive nest is located. There they find a group of humans surviving in the area. The nest seems impenetrable at first, but they eventually find an entrance with the help of the local people.

The entrance leads to a tunnel where the walls, ceiling, and floor of the cavern are composed of fossil-like Blue. The team finally comes upon a crystal formation in a massive cavern. A huge Blue is birthed from the gel substance sitting atop the formation and kills everyone except for Yuji and Marlene. Yuji kills it and comes to the conclusion that the sphere will hold the answers he seeks. He sends Marlene, who is pregnant with their child, to the surface to wait for him. He then gets a vision and can see what the Earth itself can see. Yuji comes to understand how mankind can live alongside the B-cells and returns to Marlene.

Meanwhile, Second Earth&#x27;s military station&#x27;s citizens revolt against Seno. The station&#x27;s personnel abandon the station for Earth via shuttles. Eventually, a firefight erupts over the last remaining overcrowded shuttle, and the station is destroyed by a massive explosion. All around the world from former Blue Nests, long strings of coalescing energy ascends into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and form a ring. Yuji and Marlene watch this, realizing Earth is now safe, and look forward to the rest of their lives together as the sun sets. A final view of the Earth from space is shown with a slightly garbled narration, presumably by the Earth, stating, &quot;Welcome to your next journey&quot;.

==Main characters==
* - After being diagnosed with an incurable disease (later discovered to be B-cells), Yuji Kaido decides to be put in cryogenic sleep in hopes that an effective treatment will be developed soon. In 2031, twenty-two years later, Yuji wakes up to find the world overrun by a deadly alien species known as the &#x27;Blue&#x27;. In 2009 Yuji worked in a gas station, rode his motorcycle, and hung out with his friend Takashi. But in 2031 everything Yuji knew has been destroyed by the Blue. He feels lost and alone in an unforgiving new world. For better or for worse, Yuji is guided by the only thing that he can&#x27;t trust - his emotions - as he attempts to gain control over his new life. 
* - Orphaned at the age of ten because her parents were killed by the Blue, Marlene was one of the few lucky ones to make it to Second Earth. Since then, Marlene has dedicated and trained herself to defeat the Blue. Though seeming very heartless and cold in the earlier episodes, as time progresses, Yuji opens up Marlene&#x27;s emotions and a bond is created. As Marlene&#x27;s emotions begin to resurface, everything she was taught to believe in begins to break down. Towards the end of the series, she and Yuji conceive a child together. 
* - Another Sleeper who unlike Yuji, awoke on Second Earth. A very powerful Sleeper, He is easily the most advanced member of the Sleeper Brigade and trusts no one. Yuji strives to improve himself to be able to beat Tony. Tony seems to have no emotion except for the euphoria of destroying Blue. It becomes apparent in later episodes, however, that he sees himself as a Messiah when his B-cells initiate and has his own plans for the fate of humanity. 
* - Another Sleeper on Second Earth who is paired with Tony. She immediately gravitates towards Yuji, seeing Marlene as an obstacle to a relationship with him. She is very young and often naïve. Her death is one of the many that troubles Yuji. 
* - A high-ranking member of the science division on Second Earth. He suggests that Yuji and Marlene be kept together in order to get the best results from Yuji in the Sleeper program. Not agreeing with the High Council&#x27;s leadership of Second Earth or its reckless use of the sleepers, he eventually forms a group called The Ark, which would later overthrow the High Council&#x27;s &quot;government&quot; on Second Earth. Seno would subsequently become the leader of Second Earth, but only for a brief time. His order to abandon Earth eventually results in a revolt and his execution by citizens who wanted to return to Earth. 
* - Rick is a military Elite, and although he fights on the Sleeper Brigade, he is not a Sleeper. He is cocky, confident, and loves strong women, especially Marlene. 
* - Doug is the assistant to the High Council and a high-ranking official on Second Earth. He is the Director of the Military Station, and also participates in High Council inquiries. He is later shot and killed by Miyagi.

==Reception==
Critical reception of &quot;Blue Gender&quot; has been mostly positive.

Animerica gave the series a positive review, stating that some might compare it to Starship Troopers, and concludes that &quot;if you like action, mecha, hardcore sci-fi, and global plots, this series has a lot to offer.&quot; Todd Douglass Jr. of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; gave the series a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, praising the story, characters, and animation, and stated that &quot;on the surface the show may seem stereotypical and familiar but once you actually delve into its depth you&#x27;ll recognize it for what it truly is; an awesome show.&quot; &quot;Nerdgenic.com&quot; also gave the series a positive review, with their only criticisms being the main protagonist Yuji, and the slow progression of the plot. They handed out praise for the series&#x27; secondary protagonist Marlene, the story, and the mech and monster designs.

Not all reviews were positive, however. Issac Cynova of THEM Anime Reviews was far more critical, and gave the series a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, stating that &quot;Blue Gender is one of those titles that hooks you right from the beginning, but then just fails to deliver.&quot;

<text>The Ossewabrandwag (OB) (, from and - &quot;Ox-wagon Sentinel&quot;) was a pro-Nazi Afrikaner nationalist organization with strong ties to National Socialism, founded in South Africa in Bloemfontein on 4 February 1939. It was strongly opposed to South African participation in World War II and vocally supportive of Nazi Germany. In late 1940, the Ossewabrandwag plotted a pro-German insurrection against Prime Minister Jan Smuts, albeit the plan was aborted. 

The OB carried out a campaign of sabotage against state infrastructure, resulting in a government crackdown. The unpopularity of that crackdown has been proposed as a contributing factor to the victory of the National Party in the 1948 South African general election and the rise of apartheid. 

==Background==

During the Napoleonic Era, what had previously been the Dutch Cape Colony was seized by the Royal Navy to prevent it from falling under French hegemony. After Napoleon I was finally defeated in 1815, the British Empire refused to cede control over the colony back to the Netherlands. Much of Cape Colony&#x27;s large population of Dutch settlers resented living under British rule, especially those on the Cape&#x27;s frontier, known as the &quot;Boers&quot;. The 1834 abolition of chattel slavery by parliament in the Cape Colony, compounded disdain over British rule triggering the mass migration of Boers from the colony into the African interior in an what later became known as the Great Trek. The Boer migrants eventually established the Orange Free State and South African Republic. In 1881, the independence of these states was confirmed following their victory over the British Empire in the brief First Boer War. Following the discovery of massive gold and mineral deposits in Boer territory, war broke out again in 1899. By 1902, Great Britain conquered both Boer Republics, overcoming stubborn Boer resistance through the use of a scorched earth policy and forcing Boer civilians into concentration camps.

After the war, a degree of reconciliation developed between the Afrikaners and British, facilitating the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, under the leadership of former Boer Commandos such as Louis Botha and Jan Smuts. South African Union Defence Force troops, including thousands of Afrikaners, served in the British forces during World War I.

Nonetheless, many Boers remembered the brutal tactics used by Britain in the Second Boer War and remained resentful of British rule, even in the looser form of Dominion status.

==1930s==
The chief vehicle of Afrikaner nationalism at this time was the &quot;Purified National Party&quot; of D. F. Malan, which broke away from the National Party when the latter merged with Smuts&#x27; South African Party in 1934. Another important element was the &quot;Afrikaner Broederbond&quot;, a quasi-secret society founded in 1918, and dedicated to the proposition that &quot;the Afrikaner &quot;volk&quot; has been planted in this country by the Hand of God...&quot;

The &quot;Ossewabrandwag&quot; was officially established in 1938 to commemorate the centennial of the Great Trek. Most of the migrants travelled in ox-drawn wagons, hence the group&#x27;s name. The group&#x27;s leader was Johannes Van Rensburg, an attorney who had previously served as Secretary of Justice under Jan Smuts and supported the Nazi government in Germany.

==During World War II==

The Boer militants of the &quot;Ossebrandwag&quot; (OB) were hostile to the United Kingdom and sympathetic to Nazi Germany. Thus the OB opposed South African participation in the war, even after the Union declared war in support of Britain in September 1939. 
By 1941, the OB had approximately 350,000 members.

Members of the OB refused to enlist in the UDF and sometimes harassed servicemen in uniform. This erupted into open rioting in Johannesburg on 1 February 1941; 140 soldiers were seriously hurt.

More dangerous was the formation of the &quot;Stormjaers&quot; (&quot;Storm hunters&quot;), a paramilitary wing of the OB. The nature of the &quot;Stormjaers&quot; was evidenced by the oath sworn by new recruits: &quot;If I retreat, shoot me. If I fall, avenge me. If I charge, follow me&quot; (). This motto is originally attributed to French Royalist Henri de la Rochejaquelein in 1793, but was also a popular slogan of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascists in the 1930s.

In August 1940, the OB informed the Abwehr that they were willing to launch an uprising against Jan Smuts. The organization said they had 160,000 members and 15,000 soldiers, who had not taken the &quot;Africa oath&quot; of willingness to fight against the Axis anywhere on the continent, ready to strike. They proposed that the Germans drop off weapons in Southern Rhodesia or South West Africa. The &quot;West Plan&quot; was far more well-planned.&quot;At an hour to be determined by the German High Command, Afrikaners would then blow up all rail and road bridges connecting the Transvaal with Natal. The railway personnel, the Police and 26,000 mine workers and employees have been penetrated as the rest of the State services with Ossewabrandwag members and would go on strike. The latter, viz. mine workers and employees, are already today urging for a strike. English newspapers are going to be blown up. Smuts and his followers are going to be asked kill themselves. Further dispositions are left to the German General Staff, particularly whether and which bridges are to be blown up.&quot;The plan was never carried out since the OB was unable to obtain sufficient weapons. Furthermore, the OB was reluctant to take up arms after Malan distanced the National Party from the organization at the end of 1941. Nevertheless, individual members continued to carry out acts of sabotage against the Union government. The &quot;Stormjaers&quot; dynamited electrical power lines and railroads and cut telegraph and telephone lines. These types of acts were going too far for most Afrikaners, and Malan ordered the National Party to break with the OB entirely in 1942.

The Union government cracked down on the OB and the &quot;Stormjaers&quot;, placing thousands of them in internment camps for the duration of the war. Even so, many of the internees, including future prime minister John Vorster, became future leaders of the ruling National Party during apartheid. Moreover, the internment aroused Afrikaner opposition to the government and helped the NP win the 1948 general election.

At the end of the war, the OB was absorbed into the National Party and ceased to exist as a separate body.

==Ideology==
A Nazi spy in South Africa who had frequent contact with van Rensburg in 1944 stated that the OB was &quot;based on the Führer-principle, fighting against the Empire, the capitalists, the communists, the Jews, the party and the system of parliamentarism... on the base of national-socialism&quot;. Many political science authors concurred that the OB&#x27;s association with national socialism ranged from an &quot;inclination&quot;, to &quot;wholehearted acceptance&quot; One author, van den Berghe, contended that, while there were parallels, neither Van Rensburg nor the OB were genuine fascists. That group has been referenced in the Spanish Telegram channel Revolución Identitaria, which has an accelerationist neo-Nazi orientation.

<doc id="326246" wikidata="Q1328605" url="?curid=326246" title="King Records (Japan)">
<text>, commonly known as King Records, is a Japanese record company founded in January 1931 as a division of the Japanese publisher Kodansha. It initially began operating as an independent entity in the 1950s. It later became part of the Otowa Group. Today, King Records is one of Japan&#x27;s largest record companies which is not owned by a multinational entity. The label&#x27;s headquarters are in Bunkyo, Tokyo.

The label&#x27;s name is actually based from the now-defunct &quot;Kingu&quot; magazine published by Kodansha from 1924 to 1957.

==Sub-labels==
Its Starchild label, was managed by animation producer Toshimichi Ōtsuki, specialised in anime music and film. King Records also distributes the Up-Front Works–owned and –operated labels Piccolo Town and Rice Music, and also released video games for the PC-88, Famicom, Game Boy Advance, and MSX2 platforms. On February 1, 2016, King Records restructured Starchild and renamed it King Amusement Creative.

Paddle Wheel Records is a division of King Record Co.

You! Be Cool was the official sub-label for AKB48.

Venus-B is the company&#x27;s official urban music imprint.

Evil Line Records is the label&#x27;s new division, established in April 2014, and comprises artists like Momoiro Clover Z and Meg, among others.

Nexus is the label&#x27;s division specialized for metal/underground music from Japan also overseas. Notable artists in it label are Earthshaker, etc.

Seven Seas is the label&#x27;s division focusing on world music from overseas artists in many genres.

King Custom was a special division of King Records in Japan that began in the early 1960s. It allowed individuals to release their own works without oversight or promotional support from the label. King Records provided only the branding and distribution, leaving creators with full control over their content. This unique system supported independent and regional artists, preserving their artistic freedom while leveraging King Records&#x27; established reputation and network.

The division worked with the following matrix numbers: NCS (7-inch records), NDS (33⅓ RPM EPs) and NAS (LPs). The label was discontinued in the late 1980s.

<text>London Recordings (or London Records and London Music Stream) is a British record label that marketed records in the United States, Canada, and Latin America for Decca Records from 1947 to 1980 before becoming semi-independent. The London name – as London American Recordings, often shortened to London American – was also used by British Decca in the UK market, for releases taken from American labels, which British Decca licensed.

The label is owned by Because Music, which also owns most of the label&#x27;s 1980s and 1990s UK catalogue.

==History==

London arose from the split in ownership between the British and American branches of Decca Records. The American branch of London Records released British Decca records in the U.S., as British Decca could not use the &quot;Decca&quot; name there as well as vice-versa. The label was noted for classical albums made in then state-of-the-art stereophonic sound, and such artists as Georg Solti, Joan Sutherland, and Luciano Pavarotti.

In a reverse situation, the London name was also used in the UK market by British Decca for releases taken from American labels that were licensed by British Decca, such as Liberty, Imperial, Chess, Dot, Atlantic, Specialty, Essex and Sun, and the first two UK releases from Motown. By the 1960s more licensing deals had been made with Big Top, Monument, Parrot, Philles, and Hi, and subsidiary labels were London Atlantic, London Dot and London Monument (the last featuring Roy Orbison, who remained with London in the UK even after he signed for MGM Records in the U.S.). The lead person in arranging the distribution deals at that time was Mimi Trepel.

An unusual feature was the letter code in the numbering system. From the late 1950s until 1973, the label bore the logo &quot;London American Recordings&quot;, and on Radio Luxembourg it was known as &quot;London American&quot;. 

In America, the label was best known as the American imprint of the pre–1971 recordings of the Rolling Stones (now owned by ABKCO). The label also originally issued some early LPs and singles by Texas-based band ZZ Top (whose catalog went to Warner Bros. Records when the band signed with that label).

In the 1960s and 1970s London Records got involved in then innovative quadraphonic sound techniques and launched vinyl LPs. Beginning with their &quot;Phase 4&quot; series of immersive, spatialized STEREO sound (which was NOT quadraphonic despite claims to the contrary) which, along with their &quot;FFRR - Full Frequency Range Recording&quot; series and appellation, gained them a well earned reputation on their sound quality.

Phase 4 recordings were originally made on then-novel 4-track tape, but the innovation was in the special scoring used to maximize the technology. Normally in recording techniques of the mid-60s, in order to get the kind of layered sound realized in Phase 4 recordings, required multiple overdubs over multiple reels of tape, bouncing down and bouncing across to different recorders. This increased the level of tape hiss on the final master, something which Phase 4 engineers could not tolerate. So they achieved in their scoring techniques what could be recorded in one pass what everybody else was achieving with multiple overdubs. Similar scoring techniques were used with sound pioneer Enoch Light and his Project 3 Records label around the same period.

In the late 1970s, London signed deals with Bomp! Records and with Big Sound in Connecticut, U.S. This changed the label in the eyes of many from a backwater into something a little more &quot;edgy&quot; compared to the pedestrian contemporary releases from parent company Decca. The label was staffed by Graham Baker, Keith Gooden, Mike Horsham and Liz Roff at that time. Decca&#x27;s Geoff Milne was in overall control.

The president of London Records in the 1970s was D. H. Toller-Bond (1903-1994).

After British Decca was acquired by PolyGram in 1980, London followed a more independent course with subsidiary labels such as Slash, Pete Tong&#x27;s Essential Records and FFRR (London&#x27;s dance music label, named after part of London&#x27;s logo design).

In the 1990s, London signed Madchester indie band The High and ended up being fined £50,000 by the BPI in 1991, for suspected chart hyping in the UK Singles chart in regards to this band, with the suspicion that their chart position may have been bought by the record company and not due to fans purchasing their record, &quot;More&quot;.

MCA, the owner of American Decca, merged with PolyGram in 1999, which formed Universal Music; however, by this time, London Records had become a semi-independent label within the PolyGram group operated by Roger Ames. In the 1990s, Tracy Bennet became President and Colin Bell, Managing Director. When Ames moved to the Warner Music Group, he took the label with him, and so almost all of London&#x27;s recent back catalogue was acquired by Warner, which also acquired the London name and trademark from Decca (which still owns most of the pre-1980 back catalogue). The name is still used, mainly for UK-based artists, and for ex-Factory Records artists. Notable artists released by that incarnation of London, called London Records 90, include New Order (initially on their own CentreDate Co. Ltd label), Happy Mondays, A, and Shakespears Sister.

After PolyGram took over British Decca, classical-music albums recorded by British Decca continued to be released on the London label in the U.S., with a logo similar to the Decca classical label logo, until American Decca owner MCA merged with British Decca owner PolyGram in 1999 and formed Universal Music, after which they were all reissued on the original British Decca label in the US.

The London pop music catalogue owned by Universal Music is now managed by Polydor Records, with United States distribution handled by Island Records after absorbing former distributor Mercury Records in 2014. Decca Records had a recording studio in Blomfield Road, West London; there may have been another in London&#x27;s West End. In 2010, Universal Music reclaimed ownership of the London Records trademark. Even Universal Music again owned this trademark, Warner Music Group licensed it to be used on its reissues of London&#x27;s catalogue controlled by Warner Records 90 company. On 1 July 2011 Universal Music reclaimed the London Records name and relaunched it under the executive team of Nick Raphael (president) and later Jo Charrington (senior vice president of A&amp;R) who together previously ran Epic Records for Sony Music Entertainment since 2001. Both had started their careers at London Records in the Ames era in the 1990s.

When Nick Raphael became president of Capitol Records&#x27;s UK division in 2013, London Records moved there, and operated as a sublabel until Because Music acquired the trademark license in 2017.

In July 2017, Because Music announced that it would acquire &quot;Warner Records 90&quot;, a subsidiary of Warner Music UK that reissued most London Records artists from the post-1980 era, plus very few titles from the post-1998 era, when Warner Music owned the label. Because completed the deal in August 2017, which includes the rights to over fifty London artists (including Bananarama and Happy Mondays), but excluding Slash Records, London-Sire Records, All Saints, New Order, and the FFRR (Full Frequency Range Recordings) brand (which became part of WMG&#x27;s Parlophone label). Because is distributed by another UMG division Virgin Music Label &amp; Artist Services, formerly Caroline Distribution.

Warner Records 90 was renamed London Music Stream, and later London Recordings.

The label is now operating as London Records again (as part of Because Music Group). The label has reissued many classics by acts such as Bronski Beat, Bananarama, Orbital, Goldie and Happy Mondays. They have also released new music by Blancmange, Shakespears Sister and Orbital. This includes Orbital&#x27;s &#x27;Optical Delusion&#x27; which charted at No 6 in the UK. There is now a new frontline arm of the label called &#x27;Because London Records&#x27; releasing artists such as Alewya, Joalin and Busy Twist. In 2025 the label will release an extensive podcast series telling the story of the imprint.

<doc id="326257" wikidata="Q132433" url="?curid=326257" title="Yuki Kajiura">
<text>is a Japanese composer, arranger and music producer. She has provided the music for several popular anime series, such as &quot;Sword Art Online&quot;, &quot;Puella Magi Madoka Magica&quot;, &quot;Fate/Zero&quot;, &quot;The Garden of Sinners&quot;, &quot;Pandora Hearts&quot; and &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot;.

As a composer, Kajiura is known for her unique and distinctive musical motifs and leitmotifs, as well as for her distinctive fusion of contemporary classical music and electronic music.

==Biography==
Kajiura was born on August 6, 1965, in Tokyo, Japan. She has been into music since 1972 and accompanying her father on the piano. Her family later moved to West Germany because of her father&#x27;s work. Kajiura wrote her first composition when she was seven years old titled &quot; Thank you, Good-bye&quot; as a farewell for her grandmother before leaving Japan.

Kajiura moved back to Japan when she was in middle school and later graduated from college. She began working as a systems engineering programmer until 1992 that she decided to focus more on music.

In 2002, See-Saw participated in another Mashimo&#x27;s project, &quot;.hack//Sign&quot;. During the production of the series, Kajiura met Emily Bindiger and impressed by her vocals, offered her to perform over 10 of the series&#x27; insert songs. She has also jokingly called Bindiger &quot;her English teacher&quot; at Anime Expo 2003.

In 2003, Kajiura signed with FlyingDog to form FictionJunction Yuuka with Yūka Nanri. In 2004, the duo produced the opening and ending songs for Kōichi Mashimo&#x27;s &quot;Madlax&quot; and in the next year, published their first collaborative album, &quot;Destination&quot;.

In 2008, Kajiura signed with SME Records to form Kalafina. The group consists of Wakana Ootaki, Keiko Kubota, and Hikaru Masai.

In 2009, Kajiura started a new project called FictionJunction. Unlike FictionJunction Yuuka, vocalists in this project were not fixed. This project involves collaboration with artists such as Wakana Ootaki, Asuka Kato, and Kaori Oda.

In October 2007, it was announced that Yuki Kajiura would be attending the performances of the Eminence Orchestra&#x27;s concert, &#x27;A Night in Fantasia 2007 – Symphonic Anime Edition&#x27;, as a special guest.

The 2014 series Aldnoah.Zero&#x27;s opening theme &quot;Heavenly Blue&quot; was composed by Kajiura and was performed by Kalafina.

In July 2016, Aniplex of America announced that the “Yuki Kajiura LIVE ~featuring SWORD ART ONLINE~” concert that took place in March 2016 in Japan would be having an additional date on January 14, 2017, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California, but was later canceled due to visa issues.

In December 2017, a source reported to a news site, Sponchi Annex that Kajiura was planning to leave her agency, Spacecraft Produce, over contract disputes. In February 2018, Kajiura herself confirmed via her Twitter that she has officially left her agency.

Kajiura has performed internationally at various anime conventions including Anime Expo 2003, Anime Boston 2009 (with Kalafina), Anime Expo 2012 (with FictionJunction), and Anime Expo 2018 (as part of Anisong World Matsuri).

On February 22, 2018, her contract ended with SpaceCraft Produce after being a talent for 25 years. She is now represented by FictionJunction Music, a talent agency she founded herself.

<text>Panart was one of the first and most successful independent record labels in Cuba, founded in 1944 by engineer Ramón Sabat. In 1961, its studios were seized by Fidel Castro&#x27;s communist regime and the label was nationalized, becoming &quot;Panart Nacionalizada&quot;, which shortly after was absorbed by EGREM.

Together with RCA Victor&#x27;s, Panart studios were the main recording studios in Cuba during the 1950s. Since the 1960s, they are known as the Areito studios, owned by EGREM. In addition, Panart acted as a distributor for Odeon, Musart, Sonora and Capitol Records. Its only sublabel, Sonoro, was established in 1949 and signed several trova acts such as Los Compadres.

In 2016, Panart was acquired by Concord Bicycle Music (renamed Concord in 2019) as a part of its purchase of Musart. Within Concord, Panart is operated as an imprint of the historical reissue label Craft Recordings.

== History ==
===Origins and expansion===
After studying music, joining the army and obtaining a degree in engineering, Ramón Sabat began working in several music labels in New York City. In 1943, the label he was working in, Musicraft, folded, and he decided to bring the necessary assets to Cuba to fulfill his desire of establishing his own Cuban-based record company. Thus in 1944 Sabat became the founder and president of the Cuban Plastics &amp; Record Corporation. According to Irais Huerta Rubio, the majority stockholder of the company was a Cuban electric company controlled by an American holding company. In 1945, the company sold the whole of its shares to Sabat, becoming the sole owner of the company and launching it under the name Panart (sometimes stylized Pan-Art, short for Panamerican Art). His wife, Julia Sabat, became the vice-president, and millionaire Enrique Gorrín became its treasurer. The company&#x27;s headquarters and recording studios were at San Miguel 410, between Campanario and Lealtad, in Havana, while the pressing plant was located outside of the city.

The first record released by Panart (cat. no. 1001) was a 10&quot; single by Cascarita with the Julio Cueva Orchestra (&quot;Ampárame&quot; / &quot;En el ñongo&quot;). Eight more singles were released in 1944 and 83 in 1945, starting with Orquesta Hermanos Castro &quot;Cucha el eco del tambó&quot; / &quot;Toda una vida&quot; (cat. no. 1010). Although Panart is frequently mentioned as the first independent record label in Cuba, a small label called Star was established a few years prior, recording four songs by the Septeto Nacional in 1940. In 1949, Panart launched Sonoro, a sublabel dedicated to traditional folk music (mainly son in the trova style), including Trío Servando Díaz, Trío Caney, Los Incógnitos, Los Compadres and Compay Segundo in its initial roster.

In 1952, Panart obtained exclusive rights for the pressing of music licensed by Decca. A few years later this contract was broken as Decca reached an agreement with EMI/Capitol. The expansion of the record label was nonetheless unprecedented for a Caribbean label. After establishing a subsidiary (Panart Recording Corporation) in New York in 1952, the same year it pressed its first LPs, Panart was pressing half a million records a year, 20% of which was exported outside of Cuba (over 50% by 1959). Its dominance over the jukebox business in Cuba and the strategic (geographical) advantage over its main competitor, RCA Victor, explain part of Panart&#x27;s success. Moreover, Panart was able to secure contracts with some of the most popular and innovative musicians and groups in the country, from Conjunto Casino to Julio Gutiérrez and Cachao.

=== Nationalization and aftermath ===

After the Cuban Revolution, Cuban culture, including the record industry, was to be nationalized. Most Cuban record companies either folded or quickly relocated to Florida or Puerto Rico. Panart&#x27;s fate was somewhat different, on May 29, 1961, its studios and factory were seized by the government. By that time, Ramón and Julia Sabat were already in the US. For a short period of time, until 1962, Panart&#x27;s records were sold as &quot;Panart Nacionalizada&quot; to reflect this. Between 1962 and 1964, the Imprenta Nacional the Cuba acted as the only legal Cuban label. In 1964, the EGREM &quot;trumpet&quot; logo began to be used in stickers put over the Panart logo of previously released albums, and by the time Areito was founded as EGREM&#x27;s main imprint in Panart&#x27;s former facilities, Panart had disappeared from Cuban record stores.

Thanks to Julia Sabat, who sent the master copies from Havana to New York, around 80% of Panart&#x27;s catalogue was &quot;saved&quot; before the government took over the company. Julia and her daughters then left Havana shortly after the Revolution, while Ramón remained in Cuba in charge of the company. Finally, in 1961, they managed to get Ramón out of Cuba. He and his wife established themselves in Miami. Julia started working in a record factory in Hialeah with Ramón&#x27;s brother, Galo. Together they issued 1950s recordings made in Cuba on various imprints, including Adria Records and Puchito Records, all manufactured in Hialeah.

== Competition ==
Besides having to compete with major American record labels, primarily RCA Victor (or its subsidiary, Discuba, between 1959 and 1961), and to a lesser extent, Capitol, Panart had to compete with numerous independent Cuban records labels that were established during the 1950s following the success of Sabat&#x27;s company. These Cuban labels include Puchito, Kubaney, Suaritos, Gema and Maype amongst others.

<text>Elmhurst is an unincorporated community in New Castle County, Delaware, United States. It was founded in the late 1910s and consists of about 500 houses.

==Location==
Elmhurst is located northwest of Delaware Route 4 and west of Delaware Route 100 to the southwest of Wilmington and south of Elsmere. It is located at latitude 39°43&#x27;50&quot; North, longitude 75°35&#x27;24&quot; West. It was built on Newport Pike, opposite of another community called Ashley.

==History==

The community of Elmhurst was started in the late 1910s, first being advertised for in April 1918. It opened to the public on May 11, and by May 17 &quot;The Morning News&quot; reported that &quot;a great number of lots already sold.&quot; A major expansion to the community was in the 1930s, when most of the current houses were built. In 1939, the &quot;Journal–Every Evening&quot; called Elmhurst one of &quot;Wilmington&#x27;s most swiftly-growing, low-cost real estate developments.&quot; When completed the community consisted of around 500 homes.

Between the late 1930s and early 1940s, three semi-professional sports teams were based in Elmhurst. The Elmhurst Reds, of the New Castle County Baseball League (NCCBL), the Elmhurst Grays, of the Delaware Suburban Basketball League (SBL), and another team called the Elmhurst Reds, also playing in the Delaware Suburban Basketball League.

<doc id="326273" wikidata="Q1762746" url="?curid=326273" title="Oriole Records (U.S.)">
<text>Oriole Records was an American record label founded in 1921 by McCrory&#x27;s stores.

The Oriole label first appeared in 1921, selling for 25 cents per disc record. Originally, Oriole records were pressed by the Cameo Record Company (generally not from Cameo material, however), but this arrangement lasted briefly. Most of the masters were leased from other labels, early on mostly Emerson. From around number 115, Orioles were pressed by Grey Gull and usually have unusual pairings of material, with one side being a hit popular tune and the other &quot;standard&quot; material, sometimes classical music. At number 250, Orioles began being pressed by the Plaza Music Company, which also pressed Banner Records, and whose issues were the original labels to be treated as &quot;cheap&quot; labels. Oriole and Banner, in common with Jewel Records, the Sears &amp; Roebuck label Challenge Records, and a few others, often used a standard set of &quot;noms du disque&quot; on their labels, rather than the actual names of the artists who recorded the tracks they issued. Plaza-pressed Orioles used &quot;control numbers&quot; to disguise their matrix numbers; oddly enough, these were later to appear on the flagship Banner label. After Plaza was merged into the American Record Corporation, ARC matrix numbers replaced the control numbers.

During the 1930–32 period, ARC dropped a number of their labels; however, Oriole continued (due to the successful McCrory&#x27;s contract), using the same number series (which eventually reached past 2000) as well as another series for country and race records. In August, 1935, all the low-priced labels owned by ARC began using a new, date-related numbering system, in which the last digit (originally the last two digits) of the year was followed by the number for the month and finally a two-digit serial number specific to that month&#x27;s releases. Race and country music records started their serial numbering at 51, so a blues record released in February, 1936 would carry a number like 6-02-51.

As the Depression and the popularity of radio cut into record sales, most of the store labels were discontinued; another factor was that the younger record buyers looked for specific versions of their favorite tunes, so name artists like Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman made up the majority of discs sold. The last Oriole records seem to have been issued in January, 1937. All of the low-priced labels were dropped in April, 1938 and the American Record Corporation was acquired by the Columbia Broadcasting System later that year.

<text>Aerial photography (or airborne imagery) is the taking of photographs from an aircraft or other airborne platforms. When taking motion pictures, it is also known as aerial videography.

Platforms for aerial photography include fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or &quot;drones&quot;), balloons, blimps and dirigibles, rockets, pigeons, kites, or using action cameras while skydiving or wingsuiting. Handheld cameras may be manually operated by the photographer, while mounted cameras are usually remotely operated or triggered automatically.

Aerial photography typically refers specifically to bird&#x27;s-eye view images that focus on landscapes and surface objects, and should not be confused with air-to-air photography, where one or more aircraft are used as chase planes that &quot;chase&quot; and photograph other aircraft in flight. Elevated photography can also produce bird&#x27;s-eye images closely resembling aerial photography (despite not actually being aerial shots) when telephotoing from a high vantage structures, suspended on cables (e.g. Skycam) or on top of very tall poles that are either handheld (e.g. monopods and selfie sticks), fixed firmly to ground (e.g. surveillance cameras and crane shots) or mounted above vehicles.

==History==

===Early===

Aerial photography was first practiced by the French photographer and balloonist Gaspard-Félix Tournachon, known as &quot;Nadar&quot;, in 1858 over Paris, France. However, the photographs he produced no longer exist and therefore the earliest surviving aerial photograph is titled &#x27;Boston, as the Eagle and the Wild Goose See It.&#x27; Taken by James Wallace Black and Samuel Archer King on October 13, 1860, it depicts Boston from a height of 630m.

Kite aerial photography was pioneered by British meteorologist E.D. Archibald in 1882. He used an explosive charge on a timer to take photographs from the air. The same year, Cecil Shadbolt devised a method of taking photographs from the basket of a gas balloon, including shots looking vertically downwards. One of his images, taken from over Stamford Hill, is the earliest extant aerial photograph taken in the British Isles. A print of the same image, &quot;An Instantaneous Map Photograph taken from the Car of a Balloon, 2,000 feet high&quot;, was shown at the 1882 Photographic Society exhibition.

Frenchman Arthur Batut began using kites for photography in 1888, and wrote a book on his methods in 1890. Samuel Franklin Cody developed his advanced &#x27;Man-lifter War Kite&#x27; and succeeded in interesting the British War Office with its capabilities.

In 1908, Albert Samama Chikly filmed the first ever aerial views using a balloon between Hammam-Lif and Grombalia.
The first use of a motion picture camera mounted to a heavier-than-air aircraft took place on April 24, 1909, over Rome in the 3:28 silent film short, &quot;Wilbur Wright und seine Flugmaschine&quot;.

===World War I===

The use of aerial photography rapidly matured during the war, as reconnaissance aircraft were equipped with cameras to record enemy movements and defenses. At the start of the conflict, the usefulness of aerial photography was not fully appreciated, with reconnaissance being accomplished with map sketching from the air.

Germany adopted the first aerial camera, a Görz, in 1913. The French began the war with several squadrons of Blériot observation aircraft equipped with cameras for reconnaissance. The French Army developed procedures for getting prints into the hands of field commanders in record time.

Frederick Charles Victor Laws started aerial photography experiments in 1912 with No.1 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps (later No. 1 Squadron RAF), taking photographs from the British dirigible &quot;Beta&quot;. He discovered that vertical photos taken with a 60% overlap could be used to create a stereoscopic effect when viewed in a stereoscope, thus creating a perception of depth that could aid in cartography and in intelligence derived from aerial images. The Royal Flying Corps recon pilots began to use cameras for recording their observations in 1914 and by the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915, the entire system of German trenches was being photographed. In 1916 the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy made vertical camera axis aerial photos above Italy for map-making.

The first purpose-built and practical aerial camera was invented by Captain John Moore-Brabazon in 1915 with the help of the Thornton-Pickard company, greatly enhancing the efficiency of aerial photography. The camera was inserted into the floor of the aircraft and could be triggered by the pilot at intervals. Moore-Brabazon also pioneered the incorporation of stereoscopic techniques into aerial photography, allowing the height of objects on the landscape to be discerned by comparing photographs taken at different angles.

By the end of the war, aerial cameras had dramatically increased in size and focal power and were used increasingly frequently as they proved their pivotal military worth; by 1918 both sides were photographing the entire front twice a day and had taken over half a million photos since the beginning of the conflict. In January 1918, General Allenby used five Australian pilots from No. 1 Squadron AFC to photograph a area in Palestine as an aid to correcting and improving maps of the Turkish front. This was a pioneering use of aerial photography as an aid for cartography. Lieutenants Leonard Taplin, Allan Runciman Brown, H. L. Fraser, Edward Patrick Kenny, and L. W. Rogers photographed a block of land stretching from the Turkish front lines deep into their rear areas. Beginning 5 January, they flew with a fighter escort to ward off enemy fighters. Using Royal Aircraft Factory BE.12 and Martinsyde airplanes, they not only overcame enemy air attacks, but also had to contend with winds, antiaircraft fire, and malfunctioning equipment to complete their task.

===Commercial===

The first commercial aerial photography company in the UK was Aerofilms Ltd, founded by World War I veterans Francis Wills and Claude Graham White in 1919. The company soon expanded into a business with major contracts in Africa and Asia as well as in the UK. Operations began from the Stag Lane Aerodrome at Edgware, using the aircraft of the London Flying School. Subsequently, the Aircraft Manufacturing Company (later the De Havilland Aircraft Company), hired an Airco DH.9 along with pilot entrepreneur Alan Cobham.

From 1921, Aerofilms carried out vertical photography for survey and mapping purposes. During the 1930s, the company pioneered the science of photogrammetry (mapping from aerial photographs), with the Ordnance Survey amongst the company&#x27;s clients. In 1920, the Australian Milton Kent started using a half-plate oblique aero camera purchased from Carl Zeiss AG in his aerial photographic business.

Another successful pioneer of the commercial use of aerial photography was the American Sherman Fairchild who started his own aircraft firm Fairchild Aircraft to develop and build specialized aircraft for high altitude aerial survey missions. One Fairchild aerial survey aircraft in 1935 carried unit that combined two synchronized cameras, and each camera having five six inch lenses with a ten-inch lens and took photos from 23,000 feet. Each photo covered two hundred and twenty-five square miles. One of its first government contracts was an aerial survey of New Mexico to study soil erosion. A year later, Fairchild introduced a better high altitude camera with nine-lens in one unit that could take a photo of 600 square miles with each exposure from 30,000 feet.

===World War II===

In 1939 Sidney Cotton and Flying Officer Maurice Longbottom of the RAF were among the first to suggest that airborne reconnaissance may be a task better suited to fast, small aircraft which would use their speed and high service ceiling to avoid detection and interception. Although this seems obvious now, with modern reconnaissance tasks performed by fast, high flying aircraft, at the time it was radical thinking.

They proposed the use of Spitfires with their armament and radios removed and replaced with extra fuel and cameras. This led to the development of the Spitfire PR variants. Spitfires proved to be extremely successful in their reconnaissance role and there were many variants built specifically for that purpose. They served initially with what later became No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU). In 1928, the RAF developed an electric heating system for the aerial camera. This allowed reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures from very high altitudes without the camera parts freezing. Based at RAF Medmenham, the collection and interpretation of such photographs became a considerable enterprise.

Cotton&#x27;s aerial photographs were far ahead of their time. Together with other members of the 1 PRU, he pioneered the techniques of high-altitude, high-speed stereoscopic photography that were instrumental in revealing the locations of many crucial military and intelligence targets. According to R.V. Jones, photographs were used to establish the size and the characteristic launching mechanisms for both the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rocket. Cotton also worked on ideas such as a prototype specialist reconnaissance aircraft and further refinements of photographic equipment. At the peak, the British flew over 100 reconnaissance flights a day, yielding 50,000 images per day to interpret. Similar efforts were taken by other countries.

==Uses==
Vertical aerial photography is used in cartography (particularly in photogrammetric surveys, which are often the basis for topographic maps), land-use planning, aerial archaeology. Oblique aerial photography is used for movie production, environmental studies, power line inspection, surveillance, construction progress, commercial advertising, conveyancing, and artistic projects. An example of how aerial photography is used in the field of archaeology is the mapping project done at the site Angkor Borei in Cambodia from 1995 to 1996. Using aerial photography, archaeologists were able to identify archaeological features, including 112 water features (reservoirs, artificially constructed pools and natural ponds) within the walled site of Angkor Borei. In the United States, aerial photographs are used in many Phase I Environmental Site Assessments for property analysis.

==Aircraft==
In the United States, except when necessary for take-off and landing, full-sized manned aircraft are prohibited from flying at altitudes under 1000 feet over congested areas and not closer than 500 feet from any person, vessel, vehicle or structure over non-congested areas. Certain exceptions are allowed for helicopters, powered parachutes and weight-shift-control aircraft.

===Radio-controlled===
Advances in radio controlled models have made it possible for model aircraft to conduct low-altitude aerial photography. This had benefited real-estate advertising, where commercial and residential properties are the photographic subject. In 2014 the US Federal Aviation Administration banned the use of drones for photographs in real estate advertisements. The ban has been lifted and commercial aerial photography using drones of UAS is regulated under the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. Commercial pilots have to complete the requirements for a Part 107 license, while amateur and non-commercial use is restricted by the FAA.

Small scale model aircraft offer increased photographic access to these previously restricted areas. Miniature vehicles do not replace full-size aircraft, as full-size aircraft are capable of longer flight times, higher altitudes, and greater equipment payloads. They are, however, useful in any situation in which a full-scale aircraft would be dangerous to operate. Examples would include the inspection of transformers atop power transmission lines and slow, low-level flight over agricultural fields, both of which can be accomplished by a large-scale radio-controlled helicopter. Professional-grade, gyroscopically stabilized camera platforms are available for use under such a model; a large model helicopter with a 26cc gasoline engine can hoist a payload of approximately seven kilograms (15 lbs). One example is the radio controlled Nitrohawk helicopter developed by Robert Channon between 1988 and 1998. In addition to gyroscopically stabilized footage, the use of RC copters as reliable aerial photography tools increased with the integration of FPV (first-person-view) technology. Many radio-controlled aircraft, in particular drones, are now capable of utilizing Wi-Fi to stream live video from the aircraft&#x27;s camera back to the pilot&#x27;s or pilot in command&#x27;s (PIC) ground station.

==Regulations==
===Australia===
In Australia, Civil Aviation Safety Regulation Part 101 (CASR Part 101) allows for commercial use of unmanned and remotely piloted aircraft. Under these regulations, unmanned remotely piloted aircraft for commercial are referred to as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), whereas radio-controlled aircraft for recreational purposes are referred to as model aircraft. Under CASR Part 101, businesses/persons operating remotely piloted aircraft commercially are required to hold an operator certificate, just like manned aircraft operators. Pilots of remotely piloted aircraft operating commercially are also required to be licensed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). Whilst a small RPAS and model aircraft may actually be identical, unlike model aircraft, a RPAS may enter controlled airspace with approval, and operate close to an aerodrome.

Due to a number of illegal operators in Australia making false claims of being approved, CASA maintains and publishes a list of approved remote operator&#x27;s certificate (ReOC) holders. However, CASA has modified the regulations and from September 29, 2016, drones under may be operated for commercial purposes.

===United States===

2006 FAA regulations grounding all commercial RC model flights have been upgraded to require formal FAA certification before permission is granted to fly at any altitude in the US.

June 25, 2014, The FAA, in ruling 14 CFR Part 91 [Docket No. FAA–2014–0396] &quot;Interpretation of the Special Rule for Model Aircraft&quot;, banned the commercial use of unmanned aircraft over U.S. airspace. On September 26, 2014, the FAA began granting the right to use drones in aerial filmmaking. Operators are required to be licensed pilots and must keep the drone in view at all times. Drones cannot be used to film in areas where people might be put at risk.

The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 established, in Section 336, a special rule for model aircraft. In Section 336, Congress confirmed the FAA&#x27;s long-standing position that model aircraft are aircraft. Under the terms of the Act, a model aircraft is defined as &quot;an unmanned aircraft&quot; that is &quot;(1) capable of sustained flight in the atmosphere; (2) flown within visual line of sight of the person operating the aircraft; and (3) flown for hobby or recreational purposes.&quot;

Because anything capable of being viewed from a public space is considered outside the realm of privacy in the United States, aerial photography may legally document features and occurrences on private property.

The FAA can pursue enforcement action against persons operating model aircraft who endanger the safety of the national airspace system. Public Law 112–95, section 336(b).

June 21, 2016, the FAA released its summary of small unmanned aircraft rules (Part 107). The rules established guidelines for small UAS operators including operating only during the daytime, a . ceiling and pilots must keep the UAS in visual range.

April 7, 2017, the FAA announced special security instructions under 14 CFR § 99.7. Effective April 14, 2017, all UAS flights within 400 feet of the lateral boundaries of U.S. military installations are prohibited unless a special permit is secured from the base and/or the FAA.

===United Kingdom===

Aerial photography in the UK has tight regulations as to where a drone is able to fly.

Aerial Photography on Light aircraft under . Basic Rules for non commercial flying Of a SUA (Small Unmanned Aircraft).

Article 241 Endangering safety of any person or property.
A person must not recklessly or negligently cause or permit an aircraft to endanger any person or property.

Article 94 small unmanned aircraft
# A person must not cause or permit any article or animal (whether or not attached to a parachute) to be dropped from a small unmanned aircraft so as to endanger persons or property.
# The person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft may only fly the aircraft if reasonably satisfied that the flight can safely be made.
# The person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft must maintain direct, unaided visual contact with the aircraft sufficient to monitor its flight path in relation to other aircraft, persons, vehicles, vessels and structures for the purpose of avoiding collisions. ()
# The person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft which has a mass of more than excluding its fuel but including any articles or equipment installed in or attached to the aircraft at the commencement of its flight, must not fly the aircraft:
## In Class A, C, D or E airspace unless the permission of the appropriate air traffic control unit has been obtained;
## Within an aerodrome traffic zone during the notified hours of watch of the air traffic control unit (if any) at that aerodrome unless the permission of any such air traffic control unit has been obtained;
## At a height of more than 400 feet above the surface
# The person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft must not fly the aircraft for the purposes of commercial operations except in accordance with a permission granted by the CAA.

Article 95 small unmanned surveillance aircraft
# You Must not fly your aircraft over or within 150 metres of any congested Area.
# Over or within of an organised open-air assembly of more than 1,000 persons.
# Within of any vessel, vehicle or structure which is not under the control of the person in charge of the aircraft.
# Within 50 m of any person, during take-off or landing, a small unmanned surveillance aircraft must not be flown within of any person. This does not apply to the person in charge of the small unmanned surveillance aircraft or a person under the control of the person in charge of the aircraft.

Model aircraft with a mass of more than 20 kg are termed &#x27;Large Model Aircraft&#x27; – within the UK, large model aircraft may only be flown in accordance with an exemption from the ANO, which must be issued by the CAA.

==Types==

===Oblique===

Photographs taken at an angle are called &quot;oblique photographs&quot;. If they are taken from a low angle relative to the earth&#x27;s surface, they are called &quot;low oblique&quot; and photographs taken from a high angle are called &quot;high&quot; or &quot;steep oblique&quot;.
===Vertical (Nadir)===

Vertical photographs are taken straight down. They are mainly used in photogrammetry and image interpretation. Pictures that will be used in photogrammetry are traditionally taken with special large format cameras with calibrated and documented geometric properties.

===Combined===
Aerial photographs are often combined. Depending on their purpose it can be done in several ways, of which a few are listed below.
* Panoramas can be made by stitching several photographs taken in different angles from one spot (e.g. with a hand held camera) or from different spots at the same angle (e.g. from a plane).
* Stereo photography techniques allow for the creation of 3D-images from several photographs of the same area taken from different spots.
* In pictometry five rigidly mounted cameras provide one vertical and four low oblique pictures that can be used together.
* In some digital cameras for aerial photogrammetry images from several imaging elements, sometimes with separate lenses, are geometrically corrected and combined to one image in the camera.

===Orthophotomap===
Vertical photographs are often used to create orthophotos, alternatively known as orthophotomaps, photographs which have been geometrically &quot;corrected&quot; so as to be usable as a map. In other words, an orthophoto is a simulation of a photograph taken from an infinite distance, looking straight down to nadir. Perspective must obviously be removed, but variations in terrain should also be corrected for. Multiple geometric transformations are applied to the image, depending on the perspective and terrain corrections required on a particular part of the image.

Orthophotos are commonly used in geographic information systems, such as are used by mapping agencies (e.g. Ordnance Survey) to create maps. Once the images have been aligned, or &quot;registered&quot;, with known real-world coordinates, they can be widely deployed.

Large sets of orthophotos, typically derived from multiple sources and divided into &quot;tiles&quot; (each typically 256 x 256 pixels in size), are widely used in online map systems such as Google Maps. OpenStreetMap offers the use of similar orthophotos for deriving new map data. Google Earth overlays orthophotos or satellite imagery onto a digital elevation model to simulate 3D landscapes.

===Leaf-off or leaf-on===
Aerial photography may be labeled as either &quot;leaf-off&quot; or on &quot;leaf-on&quot; to indicate whether deciduous foliage is in the photograph. Leaf-off photographs show less foliage or no foliage at all, and are used to see the ground and things on the ground more closely. Leaf-on photographs are used to measure crop health and yield. For forestry purposes, some species of trees are easier to distinguish from other kinds of trees with leaf-off photography, while other species are easier to distinguish with leaf-on photography.

==Video==

With advancements in video technology, aerial video is becoming more popular. Orthogonal video is shot from aircraft mapping pipelines, crop fields, and other points of interest. Using GPS, video may be embedded with meta data and later synced with a video mapping program.

This &quot;Spatial Multimedia&quot; is the timely union of digital media including still photography, motion video, stereo, panoramic imagery sets, immersive media constructs, audio, and other data with location and date-time information from the GPS and other location designs.

Aerial videos are emerging Spatial Multimedia which can be used for scene understanding and object tracking. The input video is captured by low flying aerial platforms and typically consists of strong parallax from non-ground-plane structures. The integration of digital video, global positioning systems (GPS) and automated image processing will improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection and reduction. Several different aerial platforms are under investigation for the data collection.

In film production, it is common to use a unmanned aerial vehicle with a mounted cine camera. For example, the AERIGON cinema drone is used for low aerial shots in big blockbuster movies.

<text> (, lit. &quot;The evening paper&quot;) is a Swedish daily tabloid newspaper published in Stockholm, Sweden. It is one of the largest daily newspapers in the Nordic countries.

==History and profile==
The newspaper was founded by Lars Johan Hierta in December 1830 under the name of during the modernization of Sweden. Often critical and oppositional, the paper was repeatedly banned from publishing. However, Hierta circumvented the bans by constantly reviving the paper under slightly modified names, as, legally speaking, a new publication. Thus, on 16 February 1835, he issued the first edition of New , which would – after yet another ban – be followed by Newer , in turn followed by Fourth , Fifth , and so on. In 1852 the paper began to use its current name, , after a total of 25 name changes. It currently describes itself as an &quot;independent social-democratic newspaper.&quot; Augusta Barthelson often wrote small stories in the newspaper.

The owners of are the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (&quot;LO&quot;) which bought it in the 1950s and Norwegian media group Schibsted, which acquired its share in the paper in the late 1990s. LO sold a large part of its shares in the paper to the Schibsted group. As per 15 June 2009 Schibsted bought another 41% and became the majority owner with 91%. However, LO has the right to appoint the political editor of the paper.

, based in Stockholm, is published in tabloid format. The paper reported news and also criticised the new Swedish king Charles XIV John. The king stopped from being printed and banned it. This was answered by starting the new newspaper &quot;&quot; (The second ), which was subsequently banned, followed by new versions named in similar fashion until the newspaper had been renamed 26 times, after which it was allowed by the king.

During its existence, has leant in different political directions. Initially liberal, it drifted towards conservatism under Harald Sohlman, editor in chief from 1890 to 1921.

In 1929, the newspaper came under the control of the Kreuger family, when a majority of the shares was bought by Swedish Match, at that time the heart of Ivar Kreuger&#x27;s corporate empire. was labeled &quot;neutral&quot;. In 1932 it backed Per Albin Hansson&#x27;s new Social Democratic government. Just a few years later it realigned with the Liberal Party and turned to advocate liberal politics. Heavily influenced by pro-German staff members, the newspaper supported Germany during World War II.

The Kreuger era came to an end on 8 October 1956. Despite interest from both the Liberal Party and the Centre Party, Torsten Kreuger sold as well as &quot;Stockholms-Tidningen&quot; to the Swedish Trade Union Confederation. Since then, the editorial line has been supportive of the Social Democrats. The ownership change was first followed by a slight drop in circulation. In the 1960s, however, the newspaper saw its circulation surge rapidly, peaking at 507,000.

By the early 1990s had run into economic problems, and many had begun to question the competence of the trade union movement as a media owner. On 2 May 1996, the Norwegian media group Schibsted acquired a 49.9 percent stake in the newspaper. The Swedish Trade Union Confederation kept the remaining 50.1 percent of its shares. The same year its circulation passed that of long-time tabloid rival . In 2005 started a Web portal for business news as a joint venture with &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;.

In 1998, the circulation of was 397,000 copies on weekdays and 502,000 copies on Sundays. The circulation of the paper was 402,000 copies in 2001. As of 2004 the paper was the most selling daily both in Sweden and in other Nordic countries, having a circulation of 422,000 copies. It was 429,000 copies on weekdays in 2005. In 2006 the paper had 1,425,000 daily readers (Orvesto research 2005:2), circa 15% of the Swedish population. The paper had a circulation of 310,900 copies in 2010. It had a circulation of 154,900 copies in 2014.

The journalistic quality of and other tabloid newspapers has sometimes been questioned. In late 2006, the paper&#x27;s own journalist Peter Kadhammar criticized the paper&#x27;s treatment of the love life of Swedish tabloid celebrity Linda Rosing as equally important to the war in Iraq.

However, has drawn more attention for the strident left-wing stance and controversial publications of its cultural section. Under former culture editor Åsa Linderborg, the cultural section was criticized by pro-Israel groups for taking an anti-Israeli stance, and in some instances Linderborg was accused of publishing opinion pieces that alluded to anti-Semitic concepts. Linderborg was also criticized over a series of articles relating to Russia, and there have been persistent allegations that the cultural section has promoted pro-Moscow narratives, including on the Russo-Ukrainian War. Linderborg denied the accusations. However, after sparking yet another round of Russia-related controversy, she resigned in 2019.

Paul Elvstrøm was born, north of Copenhagen, in a house overlooking the sound between Denmark and Sweden. His father was a sea captain but died when Elvstrøm was young, and he was brought up by his mother along with a brother and sister. A second brother drowned at the age of 5 when he fell off a seawall near the family home.

Growing up along the Øresund, Elvstrøm quickly became consumed by sailing, which began with crewing in a club fleet of small clinker keelboats. He was soon given an Oslo dinghy by a neighbour who realised Elvstrøm&#x27;s mother was too poor to be able to buy one.

In his book &quot;Elvstrøm Speaks on Yacht Racing&quot; he claimed to be ‘word blind’ and could not read or write when he was at school, which may have been due to dyslexia. It is clear that Elvstrøm considered schooling a distraction from sailing: &quot;I was very bad in school,&quot; he said, &quot;The only interest I had was in sailing fast…The teacher knew that if I was not at school, I was sailing.&quot;

After leaving school he became a member of the Hellerup Sailing Club, where he gained a reputation as an excellent sailer. He was funding himself during this period as a bricklayer, but in 1954 also started cutting sails for club members in his basement.

== Innovation ==
Elvstrøm was noted as a developer of sails and sailing equipment, and later founded Elvstrøm sails. One of his most successful innovations was a new type of self-bailer. The new features were a wedge shaped venturi that closes automatically if the boat grounds or hits an obstruction, and a flap that acts as a non return valve to minimise water coming in if the boat is stationary or moving too slowly for the device to work. Previous automatic bailers would be damaged or destroyed if they met an obstruction, and would let considerable amounts of water in if the boat was moving too slowly.

The Elvstrøm self-bailer is still in production under the Andersen brand and has been widely copied; it is still found on Olympic boats, and other grand prix boats at the leading edge of the sport. In 2016, Dan Ibsen, the executive director of the Royal Danish Yacht Club said, “Today the Elvstrøm Bailer is still the only functional bailer on Olympic dinghies and boats around the world.”

Other innovations include the Elvstrøm Lifejacket, which was the first specifically designed and produced for active sailors.

He also popularised the kicking strap, or boom vang (US). This may take the form of a block and tackle linking a low point on the mast (or an equivalent point on the hull) and the boom close to the mast, which allows the boom to be let out when reaching or running without lifting. This controls the twist of the mainsail from its foot to its head, increasing the sail&#x27;s power and the boat&#x27;s speed and controlability. Elvstrøm did not advertise his new invention, leaving his competitors mystified at his superior boat-speed. Investigation of his dinghy revealed nothing as he used to remove the kicking strap before coming ashore.

Among the innovative concepts he brought to sailboat racing was the concept of gates instead of a single windward or leeward mark in large regattas. The leeward gate on a windward-leeward course is commonly used. The windward gate is less often used due to the difficulties in managing right-of-way around the right gate, the subtleties of which are understood mostly by match racers. He has also been instrumental in developing several international yacht racing rules.

== Training ==
Elvstrøm was a very early innovator in training techniques. For example, he used the technique of &#x27;sitting out&#x27; or hiking using toe-straps to a greater degree than previously, getting all his body weight from the knees upwards outside the boat, thus providing extra leverage to enable the boat to remain level in stronger winds and hence go faster than his competitors. This technique required great strength and fitness, and so after the 1948 Olympics, in order to improve his physical conditioning in readiness for the 1952 games, Elvstrøm built a training bench with toe-straps in his garage to replicate the sitting-out position in his dinghy. He then proceeded to spend many training hours on dry land sitting out on the bench at home.

“He did take sailing to a level that you had to call it a sport,” said Jesper Bank, a principal at Elvstrøm Sails and a two-time Olympic gold medalist for Denmark. “Before Paul, you would see competitors with pipes in their mouths and wearing skippers’ caps. At that time, they certainly thought he was superhuman.”

According to an obituary by the International Finn Association, &quot;He was a sportsman and the first real sailing athlete. He trained harder and longer than anyone else so that when the day of the race came he was better prepared than anyone else. He was famous for his physical strength and fitness, able to out-hike anyone on the race course.”

== Business ==
In 1954, Elvstrøm established a manufacturing company, Elvstrøm Sails, whose products included masts, booms, and sails. Displaying a keen marketing mind to go along with his engineering nous, the business grew rapidly and by the 1970s Elvstrøm products were seen on boats all around the world.

Today, Elvstrøm Sails is among the world&#x27;s leading sailmakers, employing around 300 worldwide. Elvstrøm founded his business in the family villa just north of Copenhagen. It grew out of its premises multiple times, and today, Elvstrøm Sails is based in Aabenraa in the south of Denmark.

== Personal life ==

Elvstrøm was married to Anne, who pre-deceased him by three years; together they had four daughters: Pia, Stine, Gitte and Trine.

Elvstrøm continued to sail in his later years until Parkinson&#x27;s disease began to afflict him. In 2009 he sailed his Dragonfly trimaran — solo — to visit his daughter Gitte and her family on the east coast of Sweden, 600 miles from his home.

Elvstrøm&#x27;s success and celebrity brought personal stress. At the 1972 Games in Munich, under the pressures of competition and his challenges facing his sail-making business, he suffered a nervous breakdown.

He died on 7 December 2016 at the age of 88, after battling Alzheimers for a few years.

== Legacy ==
As well as being remembered as arguably the greatest sailing racer ever, Elvstrøm was also known to be a model of sportsmanship. He is famous for his philosophy that, &quot;If you, by winning, are losing your friends, you are not winning.&quot;

==Achievements==
Elvstrøm competed in eight Olympic Games from 1948 to 1988, being one of only nine persons ever (the others are sailor Ben Ainslie, swimmers Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky, wrestlers Kaori Icho and Mijaín López, speed skater Ireen Wüst and athletes Carl Lewis in the long jump and Al Oerter in the discus) to win four consecutive individual gold medals (1948–60), first time in a Firefly, subsequently in Finns. In his last two Olympic games he sailed the Tornado Catamaran class, which, in those days, was normally sailed by two young men, with his daughter Trine Elvstrøm as forward hand.

He is one of only five athletes who have competed in the Olympics over a span of 40 years, along with fencer Ivan Joseph Martin Osiier, sailors Magnus Konow and Durward Knowles and showjumper Ian Millar.

Elvstrøm won medals at the world championships: Finn, 505, Snipe, Flying Dutchman, 5.5 Metre, Star, Soling, Tornado, and Half Ton.

In 1996, Elvstrøm was chosen as &quot;Danish Sportsman of the Century.&quot;

In 2007, Elvstrøm was among the first six inductees into the ISAF Sailing Hall of Fame.

<doc id="326292" wikidata="Q379052" url="?curid=326292" title="Adult Swim">
<text>Adult Swim (stylized as [adult swim] and [as]) is an American adult-oriented television programming block on Cartoon Network that is broadcast during the evening, prime time, and late-night dayparts. The block features stylistically varied animated and live-action series targeting an adult audience. The block&#x27;s content includes original programming, which are particularly comedies and action series, syndicated series, and short films with generally minimal or no editing for content. Adult Swim is programmed by Williams Street, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Television Studios that also produces much of the block&#x27;s original programming.

Launched on September 2, 2001, Adult Swim has frequently aired animated sitcoms, adult animation features, parody, satire, mockumentaries, sketch comedy, and pilots, with many of its programs being aesthetically experimental, transgressive, improvised, and surrealist in nature. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in absurd and shock comedy. In addition to comedy, Adult Swim also broadcasts Japanese anime and American action animation, and since May 2012 this type of programming has generally been aired on its Saturday night Toonami block, which itself is a relaunch of the original block of the same name that ran on Cartoon Network from March 1997 to September 2008. Adult Swim operates a video game division known as Adult Swim Games, which started publishing indie games not based on the block&#x27;s original programming in 2011.

Adult Swim initially ran in the late night hours. It began to expand into prime time in 2008, and moved its start time to 8:00 p.m. ET/PT in 2014. To take advantage of adult viewership of Cartoon Network in the daypart, Adult Swim expanded further to 7:00 p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays beginning in May 2023. After experiencing success with the changes, Adult Swim further expanded to 5:00 p.m. on August 28, 2023, eclipsing Cartoon Network itself in runtime by airing 13 hours a day. Due to this change in hours, the expanded runtime is filled with a block known as Checkered Past on weekdays, which airs classic Cartoon Network original series from the 1990s and 2000s.

Due to its differing demographics, Adult Swim is usually promoted by The Cartoon Network, Inc. as being a separate network time-sharing with Cartoon Network on its channel allotments, with its viewership being measured separately by Nielsen from the youth-oriented daytime and afternoon programming carried under the Cartoon Network branding.

== History ==
=== Creation and development (1994–2001) ===

Cartoon Network&#x27;s original head programmer, Mike Lazzo, conceived Adult Swim. The block grew out of Cartoon Network&#x27;s previous attempts at airing content appropriate for adults who might be watching the channel after 11 pm (ET/PT). The network began experimenting with its late-night programming by airing anthology shows that presented uncensored classic cartoon shorts, such as &quot;ToonHeads&quot;, &quot;The Bob Clampett Show&quot;, &quot;The Tex Avery Show&quot;, &quot;Late Night Black and White&quot;, and &quot;O Canada&quot;. Another block, Toonami&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, aired the network&#x27;s action programming uncut with minimal edits. At that time, one third of Cartoon Network&#x27;s audience were adults.

During the 1990s, prime time animation geared toward adults started growing popular due to the success of Fox&#x27;s hit show &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. This was followed by a trend of other adult-oriented animated shows throughout the decade, as well as more general-oriented animated series that garnered strong adult followings.

&quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, Cartoon Network&#x27;s first foray into original programming, was created in 1994 specifically for late-night adult audiences. The series was created by Mike Lazzo&#x27;s Ghost Planet Industries, which eventually became Williams Street Studios, the producers and programmers of Adult Swim.

Between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m. on December 21, and December 30, 2000 (while &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; was on hiatus), several new Williams Street series made unannounced &quot;stealth&quot; premieres. &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;; &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;; &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;; and &quot;The Brak Show&quot; all premiered unannounced; the official schedules listed the shows as &quot;Special Programming&quot;. Prior to that, in Entertainment Weekly, it was stated that Michael Ouweleen&#x27;s next project was working on the &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; Pilot with J. J. Sedelmaier. In a 1999 interview, the indie pop rock band Calamine stated they had recorded the theme song for &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;. While entertaining pitches for a variety of adult cartoons, Lazzo realized the potential for packaging them as a complete adult-focused block. Different names were considered, including &quot;ibiso&quot;, which was said to be Spanish for &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;Parental Warning&quot; and &quot;Parental Block&quot; but he eventually settled on &quot;Adult Swim&quot; (a reference to the common policy at public swimming pools to have time intervals during the day when only adults are allowed in the pool).

Cartoon Network originally intended to launch the adult animation block on April 1, 2001, but it was delayed five months. In June 2001, &quot;TV Guide&quot; had recorded an interview with Cartoon Network&#x27;s former president, Betty Cohen. She stated there was a new programming block coming out in September that was aimed for an adult audience. During this month at the Cartoon Network Confidential, &quot;Cartoon Network&#x27;s best originals and outrageous animated shorts for discriminating adults&quot; in New York City, an upcoming episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; titled &quot;Kentucky Nightmare&quot;, the stealth pilots from December, &quot;Captain Linger&quot;, and an episode of &quot;Home Movies&quot; were screened for free. The screening was part of the Toyota Comedy Festival. On Saturday, July 21, 2001, the &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; panel at San Diego Comic-Con had a trivia game in which the winners won a promotional CD that had the theme songs to the upcoming Adult Swim Shows. Everybody who attended got a free Adult Swim t-shirt that was packaged to look like a roll of bandages that a lifeguard might carry.

At San Diego Comic-Con, audiences got to see clips of the upcoming shows and vote for what show they wanted to see as a sneak peek. &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; was the winner and the pilot was screened. The &quot;Leave It to Brak&quot; episode &quot;Mr. Bawk Ba Gawk&quot; and &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; episode &quot;The Justice Hole&quot; were also screened, as well as clips to the episode &quot;Sweet for Brak&quot;. On August 12, the first commercial advertising the new block aired on Cartoon Network. Around this time a press kit came out that featured towels and a promotional CD. Another press kit that was designed as a first aid kit came with a promo VHS with info on all the shows. &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; also highlighted the upcoming premieres. Print ads were shown in an August issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. On August 31, adultswim.com officially launched.

=== 2001–2003 ===

Adult Swim officially launched on September 2, 2001, at 10p.m. ET, with the original debut airing of the &quot;Home Movies&quot; episode &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, which had been shelved before airing on its original network, UPN. According to Linda Simensky, &quot;We had a bunch of episodes to screen for Mike Lazzo and by only the second episode, he yelled, &quot;Buy it!&quot; Cartoon Network bought the original five UPN episodes and ordered eight more to complete the season. The series&#x27; first season was animated in Squigglevision; later seasons were done in flash animation. The first anime broadcast on the block also aired on the night of its launch, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; debuted on the block on September 9, with the episode &quot;Escape from Leprechaupolis&quot;. The block initially aired on Sunday nights from 10:00 pm to 1:00 am ET, with a repeat of the same block on Thursday nights.

Adult Swim&#x27;s original bumpers shown in-between the shows featured footage of elderly people swimming in public pools, eating, exercising, and doing other pool-related activities. It would show signs all around the pool saying things like &quot;Warning Potential Violence&quot;, &quot;Warning Strong Language in use&quot;, &quot;Caution Sexual Innuendo&quot;, &quot;Caution Limited Animation&quot;, &quot;No Diving&quot;, &quot;No Kids&quot;, &quot;Warning Adult Situations&quot;, and more. Some of these bumpers were narrated by a lifeguard who spoke through a megaphone. Most notably, he would shout &quot;All kids out of the pool!&quot;. The logo was the words &quot;Adult Swim&quot; in all capital letters (or often an alternate version of the logo featured the block&#x27;s name rendered in red and a black circle with a yellow penumbra, also used as the main logo from 2002 to 2003), shown after a freeze frame of the footage. Sometimes they were even shown in reverse. The block&#x27;s original theme music, titled &quot;D-Code,&quot; was a remix of &quot;Mambo Gallego&quot; done by the Melbourne musician Dust Devil, originally played by Latin jazz musician Tito Puente Sr.

Some of the bumps on the block included &quot;Aquaman Dance Party&quot; that featured a cartoon Aquaman dancing in front of live action landfill footage, &quot;Captain Linger&quot;, a series of shorts created by J. J. Sedelmaier, &quot;Watering Hole&quot;, a series of shorts about animals talking in a bar created by Soup2Nuts, 1960s Hanna-Barbera action cartoons dubbed with the voices of children, a series of shorts called &quot;Not for Air&quot; that had the speech of Hanna-Barbera characters bleeped to make it seem like the characters were swearing, &quot;The New Adventures of The Wonder Twins&quot;, &quot;What They&#x27;re Really Thinking&quot;, which had a voice narrate a character&#x27;s thoughts in a comedic way, and &quot;Brak Puppet Party&quot;, a puppet show featuring classic Hanna-Barbera characters.

Commercials starring characters from &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney At Law&quot;, and &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; started to appear as well, such as 1-800-CALL-ATT, Nestea, Dr Pepper, Coca-Cola, Dodge Ram, Quizno&#x27;s Sub, Maximum Hair Dye, Verizon Wireless, and movie promos for &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;, &quot;Kung Pow! Enter the Fist&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Eight Legged Freaks&quot;, and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;. Brak would also host a segment called &quot;Adult Swim News&quot;. Due to the September 11 attacks, episodes of &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, and &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; were delayed. In the winter of 2001 another Adult Swim CD was made available for free to anyone who purchased issue 28 of &quot;Hitch Magazine&quot; and the same CD came with issue 29.

When the Saturday night block debuted on February 23, 2002, it was known as &quot;Adult Swim Action&quot;, with various anime programs displayed on the block from 11:00 pm to 2:00 am ET. Thus, programming on the block was divided between &quot;Adult Swim Action&quot; and &quot;Adult Swim Comedy&quot;. &quot;Adult Swim Comedy&quot; was Sunday nights and ran from 10:00 pm to 1:00 am ET. Two days prior, on February 21, Adult Swim stopped airing on Thursday nights. &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot; and &quot;The Popeye Show&quot; took &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;″s place for 12:00 am and 12:30 am ET. On June 15, 2002, Adult Swim had their first contest called &quot;Adult Swim Happiness Sweepstakes&quot; where winners could win a Master Shake air freshener.
It became increasingly common for Adult Swim to act as a home for reruns of animated series that had been canceled prematurely, such as &quot;Home Movies&quot;, &quot;Baby Blues&quot;, &quot;Mission Hill&quot;, &quot;The Oblongs&quot;, &quot;The Ripping Friends&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and &quot;God, the Devil and Bob&quot;, as well as burn off remaining episodes of said shows that never aired on their original networks, as a result of their premature cancellation. The block obtained &quot;Futurama&quot;&#x27;s exclusive pay-TV syndication rights in September 2002 for a reported $10 million, and the series first aired on the network on January 12, 2003. &quot;Family Guy&quot; made its debut on April 20 of that year with the episode &quot;Brian in Love&quot;, and immediately became the block&#x27;s top-rated program, dominating late night viewing in its time period vs. pay-television and free-to-air competition and boosting viewership of both the block, and Cartoon Network itself, by 239 percent. Seth MacFarlane had previously created &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;, a cartoon predecessor to &quot;Family Guy&quot;, that was aired on Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;What a Cartoon! Show&quot; in 1997. MacFarlane had also worked on several Cartoon Network shows, such as &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; and &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2002, Brak from &quot;The Brak Show&quot; and Carl Brutananadilewski from &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; hosted a New Year&#x27;s Eve special from 11:00 pm to 3:00 am. This was the first time Adult Swim aired on a Tuesday night.

Beginning on January 12, 2003, Adult Swim was airing five nights a week, Sundays through Thursdays from 11:00 pm to 1:00 am. Saturday nights were dropped. On February 9, 2003, sister network TNT aired an &quot;Adult Swim All Star Extravaganza&quot; event following its coverage of the 2003 NBA All-Star Game, featuring airings of programs from the block. The event was considered a &quot;sampler&quot; to promote the block to a wider audience, with Jim Samples, then-general manager and executive vice president of Cartoon Network, remarking that &quot;we think that if you like Shaq, you&#x27;ll love Brak.&quot;

=== 2003–2012 ===

On October 5, 2003, Adult Swim was on from 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. ET. On October 26, 2003, Brak&#x27;s Dad from &quot;The Brak Show&quot; hosted Halloween-themed bumps. That same night, Adult Swim hosted a live webcam show on its website, featuring the Adult Swim staff having a party. The &quot;Big O&quot; series finale episode &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, was supposed to premiere that night at 11:00pm; however, Adult Swim had to reschedule the episode for the next week, on Sunday, November 2, taking the place of the scheduled previously unaired episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;When You Wish Upon a Weinstein&quot;, to air on November 9. When &quot;Big O&quot; premiered on November 2, a rerun episode, &quot;Stripes&quot; was airing but then Adult Swim said it was just a joke and they finally aired the correct episode.

Adult Swim had another New Year&#x27;s Eve special, this time featuring some of the Adult Swim characters having a party at Brak&#x27;s house celebrating New Year&#x27;s Eve. It was on this night when &quot;The Brak Show&quot; was officially canceled. On June 15, 2004, Adult Swim launched a Video on Demand. On July 19, 2004, Adult Swim had a publicity stunt telling viewers that they needed 1,000,000 people to go to their website so they could &quot;Free Hockey Chicken&quot;. An employee was dressed as a chicken in front of a webcam being watched by viewers, and he could not leave the studio until they reached their goal. That same year Adult Swim hyped viewers by asking them to vote which would win in a fight: a &quot;Flying Shark or a Flying Crocodile&quot;.

In late 2004, Adult Swim started a course at Kent State University with lessons by film professor Ron Russo, author of the book &quot;Adult Swim and Comedy&quot;. On Halloween night in 2004, &quot;Phantasm&quot; actor Angus Scrimm hosted an &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; marathon. On November 2, 2004, Adult Swim ran a marathon of the &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; episode &quot;Guitar Control&quot; all through the night, until 2a.m.. The episode replayed 24 times to celebrate Election Day. On November 28, Adult Swim had a week showing off classic bumps from previous years. On March 28, 2005, Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System began recording Adult Swim Nielsen ratings separately from Cartoon Network for demographic purposes. Promotions for Adult Swim are targeted towards the college age and those in their 20s and 30s, constituting the majority of their viewers. According to a September 1, 2004, article in &quot;Promo&quot; magazine, representatives travel to 30 universities across the U.S. to promote the Adult Swim lineup, including handing out posters for students&#x27; dorm rooms. On April 17, 2004, Adult Swim regained Saturday nights, making Friday the only night where Adult Swim did not air. On March 28, 2005, Adult Swim gained an extra hour, now ending at 6 a.m. ET. On October 2, 2005, Adult Swim regained the 10 p.m. hour on Sundays, continuing to start at 11 p.m. Mondays to Thursdays, and Saturdays.

Adult Swim had a direct and important role in the revival of &quot;Family Guy&quot;. Due to the series&#x27; popularity in reruns, the block burned off &quot;When You Wish Upon a Weinstein&quot;, an episode of the series that had been banned from airing on Fox, in 2003. On September 21, 2003, Seth MacFarlane guest voiced on the &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; episode &quot;Super Trivia&quot;. In 2004, from July 26 through July 29, Adult Swim had a week dedicated to Seth MacFarlane where it had him host a &quot;Family Guy&quot; marathon showing select episodes. On March 29, 2004, less than one year after beginning reruns on Adult Swim, Fox announced it would be renewing &quot;Family Guy&quot; for a fourth season and reviving it from cancellation. Shortly after the announcement, Samples commented, &quot;Bringing &quot;Family Guy&quot; to the Adult Swim lineup last April really helped turn the block into a cultural phenomenon with young adults.&quot;

&quot;Futurama&quot; was also revived in 2007 by Comedy Central for similar reasons: impressive viewership in syndication as well as high DVD sales. In 2006, 20th Century Fox struck a deal to produce four direct-to-video animated features based on &quot;Futurama&quot;, and, in 2009, the series was revived in normal half-hour installments beginning in 2010 on Comedy Central. In a 2006 interview, &quot;Futurama&quot; creator Matt Groening explained &quot;There&#x27;s a long, regal history of misunderstood TV shows, and to Fox&#x27;s credit, the studio looked at the ratings on the Cartoon Network and how the show does overseas, and saw that there was more money to be made.&quot; Before Adult Swim lost the rights to &quot;Futurama&quot; reruns, they aired an all-night marathon from December 26–30, 2007, with the final reruns airing on December 31, thus, marking &quot;Futurama&quot;&#x27;s last airing on the block until 2021. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2005, Adult Swim had a countdown for the new year featuring characters from their shows. Beginning on March 27, 2006, Adult Swim&#x27;s time began at 10:30 pm ET weekdays.

In 2007, Adult Swim announced it would expand to seven nights a week and begin airing on Fridays, starting July 6. On December 29, 2008, Adult Swim moved its start time to 10 p.m. ET every night, with reruns of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; being broadcast in the hour starting January 1, 2009. On December 27, 2010, Adult Swim moved its start time from 10 p.m. to 9 p.m. ET, extending the network&#x27;s daily schedule to nine hours.

==== 2007 Boston Mooninite panic ====

On January 31, 2007, Adult Swim attracted national media attention as part of the 2007 Boston Mooninite panic. Both the Boston Police Department and the Boston Fire Department mistakenly identified battery-powered LED placards resembling The Mooninites, characters from &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, as improvised explosive devices. These devices were in fact part of a guerrilla marketing campaign for the &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot;. The next day, Boston authorities arrested two men involved with the incident. Peter Berdovsky (a freelance video artist from Arlington, Massachusetts) and Sean Stevens were facing charges of placing a hoax device to incite panic, as well as one count of disorderly conduct, according to CNN.

On February 5, Turner Broadcasting and marketer Interference, Inc. announced that they would pay $2 million in amends: one million to the city of Boston, and one million in goodwill funds. Four days later, on February 9, Jim Samples, general manager and Executive Vice President of Cartoon Network since 2001, resigned. Turner Broadcasting later issued an apology for the ad campaign that caused the bomb scares. A statement emailed to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; from Turner Broadcasting said:

&quot;The &#x27;packages&#x27; in question are magnetic lights that pose no danger. They are part of an outdoor marketing campaign in 10 cities in support of Adult Swim&#x27;s animated television show &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;. They had been in place for two to three weeks in Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, Seattle, Portland, Austin, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Parent company Turner Broadcasting is in contact with local and federal law enforcement on the exact locations of the billboards. We regret that they were mistakenly thought to pose any danger.&quot;

=== 2012–2019 ===

On April 1, 2012, as part of their annual April Fools&#x27; Day stunt, Adult Swim revived Toonami, the defunct Cartoon Network programming block that primarily aired anime and action cartoons. Following positive reception, Toonami would return full-time as a rebrand of Adult Swim&#x27;s Saturday night action block on May 26, 2012. From November 11 to December 29, 2013, Cartoon Network briefly regained the 9 p.m. ET hour, promoting it as a bonus &quot;gift time&quot; hour, shortening Adult Swim back to eight hours.

On March 31, 2014, Adult Swim&#x27;s start time moved up to 8:00 p.m. ET, further extending its nightly schedule to ten hours. From 2015 to 2022, excluding 2017, Cartoon Network would take back the 8:00 p.m. hour anytime between late September and late December, making Adult Swim start at 9:00 p.m. again.

In 2015, Adult Swim launched &quot;The Virtual Brainload&quot;, the first animated VR experience from a TV network.

On May 7, 2015, it was announced that Adult Swim had ordered an untitled pilot by Million Dollar Extreme described as a &quot;sketch show in an almost present day post apocalyptic nightmare world&quot;. Based on that pilot, it was announced on March 3, 2016, that it would go to series with the group presenting it under the additional subtitle &quot;World Peace&quot;, and the first season consisting of six episodes under Adult Swim&#x27;s traditional eleven-minute episode structure. Adult Swim announced on December 5, 2016, that it would not be renewed for a second season; Adult Swim faced internal opposition to its continuation, mainly regarding accusations of MDE being connected to the alt-right and that the show promoted racism, sexism and bigotry. While the show did not predominantly deal with political themes, Sam Hyde&#x27;s Twitter feed containing political references and his other controversies like crashing a TEDx talk, added to the suspicion. Buzzfeed writer, Joseph Bernstein, was active in criticizing the show after a heated interview with creator Sam Hyde. He wrote that a source told him the Adult Swim&#x27;s standards departments repeatedly discovered and removed coded racist messages, including hidden swastikas. When asked, Hyde explained that despite Adult Swim executives&#x27; interest to pick up the show for a second season, Turner Broadcasting ultimately decided to cancel the show.

On September 28, 2017, Pete Smith, a long-time producer at the studio and co-creator of &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, retired from the company. On that night, Adult Swim celebrated his career with an all-night marathon of &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; (consisting of episodes that his daughter, Nora Smith, wrote) and &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, with promos and bumpers made by Pete Smith airing during breaks. This became an annual event, running anywhere from 1 hour to 10 hours. The following events also added newly produced shorts, interstitials from &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; which Pete wrote for, and episodes of &quot;Squidbillies&quot; where Smith played the character Boyd.

Adult Swim began losing the syndication rights to various 20th Television animated series in 2018; Comedy Central acquired the syndication rights to &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; that year. On April 8, 2019, it was announced that FXX would acquire the rights to season 16 and beyond of &quot;Family Guy&quot; (sharing those rights with sister networks Freeform and FX) and season 9 and beyond of &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;, with rights to the seasons airing on Adult Swim and sister network TBS at the time initially planned to transfer over to the Disney-owned networks in the coming years. &quot;American Dad!&quot;, which has been a TBS original series since 2014, is set to remain.

On March 4, 2019, AT&amp;T shut down the Turner Broadcasting System. Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Boomerang, and Turner Classic Movies were transferred to Warner Bros. Entertainment under a new Kids, Young Adults, and Classics division. Although AT&amp;T did not specify any timetable for the changes to take effect, WarnerMedia had begun to remove all Turner references in corporate communications and press releases, referring to that unit&#x27;s networks as &quot;divisions of WarnerMedia&quot;.

=== 2019–present ===
In December 2019, Mike Lazzo retired from the company, which was announced by a bumper that aired on Adult Swim that month. On April 29, 2020, Michael Ouweleen, previously the chief marketing officer of Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and Boomerang and the co-creator of &quot;Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law&quot;, was named the President of Adult Swim, a new position that gives Ouweleen responsibility for all aspects of Adult Swim and its properties. Adult Swim faced layoffs in November 2020, resulting in the closing of &quot;Pocket Mortys&quot; developer Big Pixel Studios and the cancellation of all of Adult Swim&#x27;s online live-stream series. Keith Crofford retired from the company in December 2020, which was celebrated with two bumpers featuring Meatwad from &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; and Seth Green and Matthew Senreich from &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. On April 23, 2021, WarnerMedia announced that HBO Max&#x27;s adult animation development team would merge with Adult Swim, under the leadership of Suzanna Makkos.

&quot;Family Guy&quot; left Adult Swim on September 18, 2021, after an 18-year long run. The block noted the occasion with a special bumper featuring various Adult Swim characters waving goodbye to the Griffin family. From October 18, 2021, onward, Adult Swim began airing certain programs in a compressed format, speeding up programs to accommodate additional time slots for advertising sales and airing credits in a split-screen format, similar to sister network TBS; the split-screen credits tactic ceased in 2024. The network reacquired the rights to &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and &quot;Futurama&quot; on November 22, 2021, and December 27, 2021, respectively, with both shows continuing to air on FXX and, in &quot;Futurama&quot;&#x27;s case, Comedy Central.

In May 2022, following WarnerMedia&#x27;s divestment by AT&amp;T and merger with Discovery Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery, the Warner Bros. Global Kids, Young Adults, and Classics division was dissolved. Adult Swim was moved under Warner Bros. Discovery Networks, while Williams Street moved under Warner Bros. Television. Ouweleen still oversees both units, while also gaining oversight to Cartoon Network, Boomerang, and Discovery Family. Several Adult Swim shows, including &quot;Tigtone&quot;, and &quot;Lazor Wulf&quot;, were removed from Adult Swim&#x27;s website and HBO Max that year as a part of massive cost-cutting moves at WBD. Some other series, like &quot;Final Space&quot;, were written off as a loss for tax purposes and removed from digital stores. On January 24, 2023, it was announced that Adult Swim had severed ties with &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; co-creator Justin Roiland after he was charged with felony domestic abuse. Show production continued, with Ian Cardoni and Harry Belden cast as Rick and Morty, respectively.

On May 1, 2023, Adult Swim&#x27;s start time moved up to 7:00 p.m. ET/PT on weekdays and Saturdays, extending the block to eleven hours. Ratings data found that 68% of Cartoon Network&#x27;s overall viewership between the 6 and 8 p.m. hours had been over the age of 18, thus justifying a further expansion of the block. The first two weeks of the new schedule—which was anchored by the premiere of &quot;—&quot;brought the hour a 24% increase in overall viewership, and a 38% increase among viewers 18–34.

On May 17, 2023, Kathleen Finch, CCO of Warner Bros. Discovery U.S. Networks Group, announced that a further expansion to the 6:00 p.m. ET hour would occur later in the year. The change was officially announced on June 7, 2023, and took effect on August 28, 2023: on weekdays, the hour would feature the new block Checkered Past—which features reruns of classic Cartoon Network original series. It was later announced on August 8, 2023, that Adult Swim would instead begin at 5:00 p.m., expanding the block to 13 hours. ACME Night, a Sunday night movie block, moved from Cartoon Network to Adult Swim following the expansion, starting an hour earlier at 5:00 p.m. Adult Swim&#x27;s rights to the first eight seasons of &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; were set to expire in late 2023, though this did not come to pass. Instead, a deal was made for Adult Swim and FXX to share the show, with later seasons previously exclusive to FXX first appearing on October 2, 2023.

On May 17, 2024, Adult Swim announced another new block, Toonami Rewind, consisting of the classic anime &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball Z Kai&quot;, and &quot;Naruto&quot;, using throwback Toonami branding. The block launched on May 31, 2024, replacing Checkered Past on Fridays. No further series were added, and Toonami Rewind ultimately ended on December 27, 2024, with Checkered Past, now on for only an hour, regaining Fridays.

On December 3, 2024, Adult Swim announced that they had reacquired the rights to air &quot;Family Guy&quot;, which returned to the network on January 1, 2025 with a three-day marathon. The network has non-exclusive rights, sharing the series with Fox, FXX, FX, Freeform, and Comedy Central, who itself had acquired the rights in September 2024.

== Special events ==
=== Death tributes ===
Adult Swim occasionally airs bumpers that pay tribute to a recent celebrity death. These bumpers have no music or sound effects, but only a fade-in, showing the person&#x27;s name, year of birth, and year of death, followed by a fade-out. This has been done for many people over the years, including celebrities such as Steve Jobs, Kobe Bryant, Chadwick Boseman, and MF Doom, and Adult Swim cast and crew such as Harry Goz. Some tribute bumpers have been made jokingly, such as one mocking the declining quality of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; in 2017, one marking the lifespan of NFTs as 2021 - 2021, and one for Sherman Hemsley done in 2014, a full 2 years after his death (adding &quot;Sorry, we just found out. That shit sucks&quot;).

Following the death of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; animator and voice actor C. Martin Croker on September 17, 2016, Adult Swim paid tribute to him the following night, playing the first produced episode of the show (&quot;Elevator&quot;) with tribute bumpers bookending the rerun. Toonami also paid tribute to Croker the following Saturday, with T.O.M. and S.A.R.A. saying farewell to former host Moltar (voiced by Croker) in a special intro.

Following the death of Norm Macdonald on September 14, 2021, Adult Swim aired an hour of &quot;Mike Tyson Mysteries&quot; (on which he voiced Pigeon) on the 14th and the 15th. Similar tributes where the network played special reruns have also occurred for celebrities such as Gilbert Gottfried, Akira Toriyama, and Paul Reubens.

=== April Fools&#x27; Day stunts ===
Since 2004, Adult Swim has had an annual tradition of celebrating April Fools&#x27; Day by tricking and fooling their audience by altering programs or airing different and obscure programs. The pranks generally start at 12 a.m. ET on April 1, technically considered part of the March 31 schedule, with an additional prank on the April 1 schedule rarely. Since its launch in 2019, the annual pranks have been simulcast on the Adult Swim network in Canada. Since 2021, the pranks have also been streamed to Adult Swim&#x27;s YouTube.
* Starting in 2004, all of the regularly scheduled episodes were aired with random mustaches drawn on the characters; however, the next night the episodes were aired again this time without the random mustaches.
* In 2005, Adult Swim aired an early, unfinished version of the &quot;Squidbillies&quot; pilot, instead of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. Right after the rough cut, it was announced that the animated series would premiere later in October 2005.
* In 2006, Adult Swim aired old re-runs of &quot;Mr. T&quot; and &quot;Karate Kommandos&quot;, and then aired episodes of &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&quot; with fart noises added to the dialog.
* On March 31, 2007, Adult Swim aired all 6 episodes of &quot;Perfect Hair Forever&quot; that existed at the time, alongside a new episode in reverse order, and edited to look like they were being played from degraded videotapes with poorly-done fansubs (either containing grammatically incorrect English, or dialogue from completely different shows such as &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;).
* On April 1, 2007, Adult Swim promoted a television premiere of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot; ahead of its theatrical release that occurred 9 to 12 days later, but only showed the first two minutes (which had long been available on the film&#x27;s official website) before minimizing it into a comically small picture-in-picture display over regularly-scheduled programming.
* In 2008, Adult Swim aired a night of unfinished sneak peeks, pilots and stealth premieres of future upcoming shows in place of its regularly scheduled programming, featuring &quot;Fat Guy Stuck in Internet, The Venture Bros., Delocated, Superjail!, Young Person&#x27;s Guide to History, Metalocalypse, Robot Chicken,&quot; and &quot;Moral Orel&quot;. Some of these premieres included introductory segments hosted by Robert Osborne from Turner Classic Movies. The repeat block did air the scheduled &quot;ATHF&quot; movie, with bumps teasing the viewer about missing the premieres.
* In 2009, Adult Swim aired &quot;The Room,&quot; a critically panned 2003 independent film that was considered a cult classic, with sex scenes obscured with black boxes and with a TV-14 rating. It was followed by the &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot; episode &quot;Tommy&quot;, which featured the star and director of the film Tommy Wiseau.
* In 2010, Adult Swim re-aired &quot;The Room&quot; for a second year in a row, with bumps featuring Tommy Wiseau being interviewed on &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. Sex scenes remained censored, but the parental rating was raised to TV-MA.
* In 2011, &quot;The Room&quot; was aired once again with the TV-MA rating and was followed by a 15-minute special titled &quot;Earth Ghost&quot;, a CGI version of the &quot;Lowe Country&quot; pilot shown on Adult Swim&#x27;s website in 2007.
* In 2012, Adult Swim replaced its lineup with Toonami, a former programming block from Cartoon Network. After first playing the opening sequence of &quot;The Room&quot;, the scene switched to the Toonami host T.O.M. noting that it was April Fools&#x27; Day before introducing that week&#x27;s scheduled episode of &quot;Bleach&quot;. The Toonami bumps and programming would continue throughout the night, featuring &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;, &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot;, &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;, &quot;The Big O&quot; season 1, &quot;Yu Yu Hakusho&quot;, &quot;Blue Submarine No. 6&quot;, &quot;Trigun&quot;, the original version of &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, and &quot;Gigantor&quot;. T.O.M. also presented a review of &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot; and promoted the recent DVD releases of the series featured. Subsequently, on May 16, 2012, Adult Swim announced via Twitter and later by a press release that Toonami would return to Adult Swim on May 26, 2012, as a regular weekly Saturday night programming block.
* In 2013, Adult Swim featured images of cats throughout much of its programming. All of the bumps contained videos and images of cats, while the episodes of the live-action shows aired that night had cat faces covering up the faces of the actors. The [adult swim] logo was replaced with &quot;[meow meow]&quot;.
* In 2014, Adult Swim premiered an eighth and ninth two-part episode of &quot;Perfect Hair Forever&quot;, exactly seven years following the second series finale during the 2007 April Fools stunt and about 9 years after the first series finale in 2005. This was followed by an unannounced &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; marathon featuring creator-chosen episodes (including the full version of &quot;Fire Ant&quot;, which has rarely been aired on TV). During the marathon, bumps were included between episodes showing outtakes and commentary from the writers and staff. The prank streamed on a loop on Adult Swim&#x27;s website the next day.
* In 2015, Adult Swim aired a 6-hour marathon of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, with superimposed coins on the screen, replicating the &quot;Coin Hunt&quot; game from Adult Swim&#x27;s online live stream show &quot;FishCenter&quot;. The main characters of the show collected points by hovering over the coins during the episodes, with the points counted and tabulated throughout the night. Master Shake was ultimately declared the winner. &quot;FishCenter&quot; streamed live during the whole event, featuring special guest Trixie Mattel, Zach White, a guitar music performance from Jared Hill, and several confused call-ins.
* In 2016, advertisements were shown for the April Fools&#x27; broadcast, recapping their 12-year history of pranks and hyping up that year&#x27;s prank. When midnight did occur, regular programming played, with the implication being that the prank for 2016 was that there was no prank.
* On the broadcast night of March 31, 2017, all the regularly scheduled episodes after midnight had a weird audio mix, including added laugh tracks, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; stings, robotic and pitch-shifted filters added to particular voices, various sound effects and alternate musical pieces.
* On April 1, 2017, the evening portion of Adult Swim was replaced with the unannounced &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; Season 3 premiere, &quot;The Rickshank Rickdemption&quot;. It aired repeatedly from 8:00p.m. until midnight on TV, shortening Toonami in the process, and streamed on a loop on Adult Swim&#x27;s website. Newly commissioned &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; IDs and announcement promos for upcoming shows and seasons aired during the prank. The episode then repeated every night at 10:00 p.m. until April 7.
* On the broadcast night of March 31, 2018, Toonami aired its anime after midnight in Japanese with English subtitles, breaking the block&#x27;s policy of only playing dubbed anime. The subbed anime included the stealth premiere of &quot;FLCL Alternative&quot;, the 2004 film &quot;Mind Game&quot;, and most of Toonami&#x27;s scheduled programming for that night. The short &quot;Scavengers&quot; finished off the block at 5:45 a.m. The block aired special bumpers with T.O.M. and S.A.R.A. and a game review of &quot;&quot;, all dubbed to Japanese with English subtitles. The Adult Swim logo was also changed to Japanese (stylized as [アダルトスイム]). The originally scheduled programming affected by the prank aired normally the following week.
* On April 1, 2018, Adult Swim aired an animated parody of &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; titled &quot;Bushworld Adventures&quot;, created by Michael Cusack, at 11:00 p.m., instead of &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; and &quot;Mike Tyson Mysteries&quot;. It follows Rick and Morty in Australia going on wild adventures in search to find the green cube that was left at Bendigo. All of Adult Swim&#x27;s nature-themed bumpers that aired throughout the hour were Australian-themed. The short also streamed on a loop on Adult Swim&#x27;s website.
* In 2019, Adult Swim aired &quot;Gēmusetto Machu Picchu&quot;, an anime parody that ran continuously from midnight to 5:45 a.m. It was simulcast both on TV and on Adult Swim&#x27;s online live stream, with a live Q&amp;A with creator Maxime Simonet airing after the program on the live stream. The special was simulcast on Action in Canada as its second-to-last program ever before its relaunch as a new 24/7 Adult Swim network at 6:00 a.m.
* In 2020, Adult Swim aired &quot;Post&#x27;s Game&quot;, a night of sneak peek programming hosted by Post Malone and friends, playing casual games during the broadcast. The prank started with a tease to a new season of &quot;Gēmusetto&quot; (which debuted later in the year), only to be interrupted by Malone. New episodes of &quot;Primal&quot;, &quot;Dream Corp LLC&quot;, &quot;Tigtone&quot;, &quot;The Shivering Truth&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Lazor Wulf&quot;, &quot;12 oz. Mouse&quot;, and &quot;Tender Touches&quot; aired. The series premieres to &quot;&quot; and &quot;JJ Villard&#x27;s Fairy Tales&quot; were also shown, along with the pilot for &quot;Smiling Friends&quot;, a &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; short by Studio Deen, and a new trailer for the second half of &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; season 4. Malone made silent cameos on each show (aside from &quot;Primal&quot; and &quot;Smiling Friends&quot;) via green screen. &quot;Smiling Friends&quot; was quickly uploaded to the website due to popular demand, and got picked up for a full series a year later. &quot;FishCenter&quot; streamed live during the event on the website, taking calls from viewers.
* In 2021, Adult Swim became &quot;Adult Swim Junior&quot;, airing versions of the &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; episode &quot;Total Rickall&quot; (retitled &quot;Rick and Morty Babies&quot;) and the &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; episode &quot;Revenge of the Mooninites&quot; (retitled &quot;Aqua Child Hunger Force&quot;) that had been overdubbed by children with edited scripts to make them age-appropriate; promos aired during the event featured other Adult Swim programs being made &quot;family-friendly&quot;.
* In 2022, Pibby and Bun Bun, the main characters from the &quot;Come and Learn with Pibby&quot; proof-of-concept short, appeared in Adult Swim&#x27;s programming and bumpers from midnight to 2:00 a.m., occasionally having characters and the environment be visually corrupted. The prank repeated from 3:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m., and Adult Swim later posted a compilation of all the corruptions done in the night&#x27;s prank. A &quot;Pibby&quot;-related song played over the network sign-off at 5:59 a.m. HBO Max added the short, and themed the Adult Swim hub around the prank for the following week. &quot;Pibby&quot; was later not greenlit into a full TV series.
* In 2023, Adult Swim announced that the block would be taken over by AI, followed by a short clip of a &quot;Smiling Friends&quot; episode reanimated through generative artificial intelligence. It was quickly cut off due to its uncanniness, only for the channel to lose its &quot;remote&quot; and start &quot;fast forwarding&quot;, showing previews of the new series &quot;Royal Crackers&quot; and the upcoming seasons of &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot; and &quot;Teenage Euthanasia&quot;. The network then &quot;rewound&quot; to an airing of the &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; episode &quot;Fire Ant&quot;. At 1:00 a.m. ET, Adult Swim then aired the &quot;Infomercials&quot; shorts &quot;Unedited Footage of a Bear&quot; and &quot;Broomshakalaka!&quot; as &quot;[as-]&quot; (&quot;Adult Swim Minus&quot;; &quot;all the commercials you love minus all the annoying shows&quot;). Afterward, to provide &quot;something meditative&quot; as an apology for the previous 90 minutes, a half hour of footage of a train traveling through Norway was aired under the title &quot;Ambient Swim&quot;.
* In 2024, a week before the prank, Adult Swim promoted season 2 of &quot;Smiling Friends&quot; as premiering March 31 at midnight, with various online promos including a doctored appearance on the exterior of the Sphere in Las Vegas. When midnight did occur, Adult Swim instead aired various episodes of season 1 redone with puppets: &quot;Mr. Frog&quot; was redone with Muppet-style puppets, &quot;Shrimp&#x27;s Odyssey&quot; was redone with sock puppets and live-action humans, and &quot;Charlie Dies and Doesn&#x27;t Come Back&quot; was redone with papier-mâché puppets. The first episode of season 2, &quot;Gwimbly: Definitive Remastered Enhanced Extended Edition DX 4K (Anniversary Director&#x27;s Cut)&quot;, followed after, with an announcement that the rest of season 2 would premiere starting May 12. The episodes were then played in reverse order the following hour.

=== Alternate reality games ===
Adult Swim began an ARG campaign on August 27, 2017, by airing a cryptic bump &quot;transmission&quot; during a new episode of &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;. The bump referred viewers to a Twitter account. Players were told that they were trying to rescue a stolen AI named Delilah. Weekly bumps provided puzzles to be solved by viewers with solutions submitted via Twitter. The solutions were then confirmed by both the Twitter account and subsequent bumps. Later in the game, Delilah was forced to self-destruct to prevent a security breach. The Twitter account then rebranded itself as a marketing company and claimed that the entire game was an experiment. Soon after this, a new Twitter account followed all the previous account&#x27;s existing followers. This new account informed everyone that they were searching for their missing sister named Amelia. The bump transmissions then started referring viewers to this new Twitter account as well as several new Instagram accounts, continuing to provide puzzles that required solving. Some players have used Discord to work together as a team in a dedicated server to solve the puzzles and share theories about the game. The ARG has been consistently broadcasting new messages and puzzles every Sunday since the initial August 2017 broadcast, with only a short hiatus during the 2017 holiday break. On March 25, 2018, it was revealed that Amelia was safe and had been for quite some time. Players learned that Amelia&#x27;s messages asking for help were actually sent 3 years prior and that their delay in being received was caused by time dilation. This revelation effectively completed the second chapter of the ARG, and alluded to the next phase, which started in June 2018. The following narratives explored the intricate connections between Delilah, Amelia, and the newly introduced character, Tristan, revealing layers of corporate and personal intrigue involving Proto-X and the shadowy organization known as Sinistra MGMT.

== Programming ==

Original shows currently in-production and seen on Adult Swim include &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Off the Air&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;Smiling Friends, and My Adventures with Superman&quot;. Adult Swim is well known for its inaugural slate of programming, which were mainly parodies and remakes based on Hanna-Barbera properties (including &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, and &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;), as well as for later hits including &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, and &quot;The Boondocks&quot;.

Adult Swim also airs syndicated programs from 20th Television Animation (&quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;) and Corus Entertainment (&quot;Psi Cops&quot;) original series produced for TBS and Max (&quot;American Dad!&quot; and &quot;Ten Year Old Tom&quot; respectively), and have acquired and co-produced various anime series. Via Adult Swim, Cartoon Network is one of the few U.S. networks to carry anime, and the only network that airs such programming aimed at young adults and teens rather than children.

Currently, most anime and action-genre programming air on Saturday nights as part of Toonami, a former Cartoon Network programming block that was relaunched by Adult Swim on May 26, 2012, as a &quot;block-within-a-block&quot;. Older anime programming briefly aired as a part of Toonami Rewind, a Friday afternoon block that launched on May 31, 2024 and ended later in the year on December 27, before being reabsorbed into the Toonami block. Cartoon Network shows that have gained a following among older viewers have also aired on Toonami; in particular, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; proved popular enough in reruns to warrant a revival in 2017.

=== ACME Night ===
ACME Night, themed after the Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons, was a Sunday afternoon movie block that originally debuted as a Cartoon Network block on September 19, 2021, before moving to Adult Swim on September 3, 2023 and ending on December 29, 2024. While a Cartoon Network block, ACME Night was intended to produce original programming and films for a family audience. Ultimately, only the game show &quot;Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses&quot; premiered on the block (while being simulcast on TBS). Following the Warner Bros. Discovery merger, several planned programs and films were either scrapped or moved to other networks and services, including &quot;&quot;, which moved to Adult Swim, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Merry Little Batman&quot;, which moved to Prime Video, and &quot;The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie&quot;, which was released theatrically. The Sunday evening block mostly aired acquired films, including films rated PG-13, which was unusual for Cartoon Network. Programming from TBS, TruTV, and Adult Swim was often used as time-filler following the movie. While on Cartoon Network, the block ran from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET, though following the move to Adult Swim it began at 5:00 p.m. and ended when the film ended.

=== Checkered Past ===
A nostalgia-focused block, Checkered Past, was launched August 28, 2023. It broadcasts older Cartoon Network original series from the 1990s and 2000s, including those belonging to the Cartoon Cartoons brand. The block&#x27;s name is a reference to Cartoon Network&#x27;s iconic checkerboard motif used since its 1992 launch. The two-hour block launched on August 28, 2023, marking Adult Swim&#x27;s expansion into evening hours, and originally ran Monday through Friday from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. ET/PT. As of December 30, 2024, the block runs from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m., with the 6 p.m. hour now being relegated to &quot;King of the Hill&quot; reruns.

In July 2024, Andy Merrill announced a puppet version of &quot;Space Ghost&quot; character Brak will appear on Checkered Past in late 2024 during reruns of &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot;. Checkered Past also airs on the Latin American version of Adult Swim, which launched on October 31, 2023.

== Merchandise and media offerings ==
=== Official website ===
Adult Swim&#x27;s official website features full episodes of shows, online streams and podcasts, music streaming, comics, a programming schedule, and a section dedicated to its Toonami programming block.

User accounts could once be made on the site, initially for the site&#x27;s messaging boards, which launched in May 2003 and shut down in October 2016. By 2018, the only main functionality for user accounts left was for creating profiles and participating in the live stream chatrooms. User accounts were permanently disabled in January 2021, following the removal of the chat function.

A store was available on the site, although initially only through the main Cartoon Network store from 2001 to 2004. The store later spun-off into its own website, the Adult Swim Shop, in 2004, and ran until 2012. Another store, As Seen on Adult Swim, launched in 2013 and only sold a single item at a time until 2017, when a QVC-like show was launched with the same name on the Adult Swim streams. The site later shut down in January 2021, following the end of the series in November.

=== Video on demand and online streaming ===
In mid-2004, Adult Swim launched a video on demand service on subscription television providers. The service includes several episodes from various Adult Swim original series, syndicated series, and anime licensed for Toonami. The anime series &quot;s-CRY-ed&quot; initially premiered on demand before debuting on the regular block in May 2005. The video on demand service was added to DirecTV in October 2007, on channel 1886.

Adult Swim introduced online video streaming in 2006, providing a free online video on demand service for recent and older episodes of select programming. Initially, some episodes premiered on the website early, although eventually episodes began appearing 1–3 days after broadcast. This became a week after broadcast in June 2010.

In August 2011, Adult Swim began requiring TV Everywhere authentication for most episodes on the site, greatly reducing the amount of free content. This service was combined with the Adult Swim mobile app in 2014. Around this time, Adult Swim began posting every episode of select series online for free viewing, although some of these were removed in 2015 when Hulu acquired the rights to multiple shows, and once again in 2020 when sibling service HBO Max, known as Max since May 2023, launched.

Most of Adult Swim&#x27;s library is available on Max, while select series are available on Hulu. As of March 2022, Adult Swim&#x27;s current programming, excluding &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; (which is shared with Hulu), &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot; (which is exclusive to Hulu), and &quot;Off the Air&quot;, is put on Max the day after new episodes air.

Several Adult Swim shows are also available for purchase on iTunes, Google TV, Amazon, Microsoft Movies &amp; TV, and Vudu.

=== Video games ===

Adult Swim once had many Flash-based online games available on their website, including &quot;Robot Unicorn Attack&quot; and &quot;Five Minutes to Kill (Yourself)&quot;, but all of the games were removed in 2020 following the discontinuation of Adobe Flash Player. Starting in 2005, Adult Swim began publishing mobile games, including those based on Adult Swim franchises and original content. In 2011, the division Adult Swim Games was created to publish original indie game content, largely focusing on the hardcore gamer market. The publisher has not released a game since &quot;Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time&quot; in 2020, and, in 2024, relinquished the rights to most of their games back to the original developers, save for games they were unable to contact the developer for (which were delisted) or games based on the network&#x27;s IPs (&quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality&quot;, and the still-updated &quot;Pocket Mortys&quot;).

=== Music ===

Adult Swim has partnerships with several independent music labels, and has co-produced and released compilation albums with Stones Throw Records, Ghostly International, Definitive Jux, and Chocolate Industries through their own label, Williams Street Records. Many of Adult Swim&#x27;s bumps and packaging make use of instrumental and electronic music. Various music is also often borrowed from artists signed onto a wide array of different labels, including Warp Records and Ninja Tune Records.

=== Live events ===
Adult Swim has held various live events throughout the years through its Adult Swim Presents division. Adult Swim frequently appears at San Diego Comic-Con, often holding sneak previews, games, musical performances, among other things. Since 2018, it has held an annual Adult Swim Festival, with a mix of music, comedy, panels, and other festivities. 2018 and 2019&#x27;s festivals took place in Los Angeles, and had select performances streamed live on the Adult Swim Streams. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 and 2021&#x27;s festivals were held online, through prerecorded videos and live streams on YouTube. The 2022 festival, known as the Adult Swim Festival Block Party, took place in Philadelphia, with highlight reels and select full performances being streamed to YouTube. The 2023 festival, known as the Adult Swim Festival On the Green, occurred at San Diego Comic-Con and had no online live stream.

=== Podcast ===
Adult Swim offered a video podcast on iTunes from March 21 to September 19, 2006. The podcasts featured behind-the-scenes segments of shows and exclusive content; such as an interview with &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;″s Dennis Haskins and a look at Brendon Small and Tommy Blacha&#x27;s &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;. The podcast reached number two in iTunes&#x27; ranking of most downloaded podcasts.

A new audio-only podcast, called the &quot;Adult Swim Podcast&quot;, was launched on July 11, 2019, hosted by Matt Harrigan. In regular episodes, Harrigan interviews different Adult Swim contributors, show creators, and actors. Max Simonet was later added as a co-host, with interviews still done solo by Harrigan. No new episodes of the &quot;Adult Swim Podcast&quot; have released since November 2020, and links to the podcast on the website were eventually removed. Adult Swim also teamed up with Abso Lutely Productions to produce season 2 of the &quot;This is Branchburg&quot; comedy podcast.

=== Live streams and web series ===
On September 25, 2013, Adult Swim began simulcasting their channel through the Adult Swim mobile app and website, although TV Everywhere authentication is required. Both the East and West Coast feeds are available.

In late 2014, Adult Swim added several free 24/7 live streams to their website, most of them airing marathons of different shows on a loop. One of the live streams, a feed of the Williams Street office&#x27;s fish tank, became its own series: &quot;FishCenter Live&quot;, and led to the creation of the Adult Swim Streams.

The Adult Swim Streams consisted of several online-exclusive originals, usually broadcast live, and featured a chatroom, similar to that of Twitch. Many of the shows also accepted calls from viewers to interact with the hosts or change the course of a program.

Select shows aired daily on the service, these included:
* &quot;FishCenter Live&quot;: A parody of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and the flagship series, consisting of Matt Harrigan, Max Simonet, Dave Bonawits, Andrew Choe, and Christina Loranger narrating over footage of the Williams Street fish tank. Fish scored points through games started by the hosts and games played by callers. Special guests, like musicians and comedians, often performed.
* &quot;Stupid Morning Bullshit&quot;: A morning (later, evenings) talk show hosted by Sally Skinner, discussing strange news stories and current events.
* &quot;Williams Street Swap Shop&quot;: A phone-in trading show in the vein of tradio programs hosted by Zachary White and Matt Hutchinson. A spin-off, &quot;Traveling Tuesdays&quot;, had Zach visit places around Atlanta.
* &quot;Bloodfeast&quot;: A crossword puzzle solving show hosted by Max Simonet and Dave Bonawits that frequently used surreal content intended to disturb viewers, including animations, poetry, and short films. The show received two animated TV spinoffs, &quot;Tender Touches&quot; in 2017, followed by &quot;Gēmusetto&quot; in 2019. A stream spin-off known as &quot;Bloodfeast Presents&quot; featured musical performances using the same special effects to create unique visuals.
* &quot;Desperate Losers&quot;: A show hosted by various Adult Swim employees that had them play with scratch-off tickets in an attempt to supplement their incomes. The show alternated recording between Atlanta, New York City, and Connecticut.
Some shows aired weekly or on special occasions, these included:
* &quot;Assembly Line Yeah!&quot; : An arts-and-crafts show hosted by Jiyoung Lee and Anca Vlasan.
* &quot;Last Stream on the Left&quot;: A podcast-style show hosted by Ben Kissel, Henry Zebrowski, and Marcus Parks. The hosts discuss dark or disturbing stories, conspiracy theories, and paranormal happenings.
* &quot;Digikiss&quot;: A live one-on-one video dating show where viewers could ask questions and watch the date unfold.
* &quot;Truthpoint: Darkweb Rising&quot;: A show hosted by dril and Derek Estevez-Olsen, a parody of InfoWars.
* &quot;As Seen on Adult Swim&quot;: A show hosted by Nick Gibbons, in the style of a home shopping program, selling Adult Swim merchandise and giving away a rare item as the last item every night to a winner of a contest.
* &quot;Development Meeting&quot;: A show hosted by development coordinators Walter Newman and Cameron Tang where viewers could pitch programs to Adult Swim. Unfinished sneak peeks to upcoming productions were also shown until 2019. One pitch, &quot;Skeleton Landlord&quot;, eventually made it on air as a part of &quot;Infomercials&quot;.
* &quot;Toonami Pre-Flight&quot;: A show hosted by Jason DeMarco and Gill Austin, where they discussed programming, took fan questions, and showed sneak peeks to upcoming promos and game reviews.
* &quot;Block or Charge&quot;: A comedy clip show hosted by Rex Chapman and David Helmers, based on Chapman&#x27;s tweets.
* &quot;The Cry of Mann&quot;, &quot;The Call of Warr&quot;, and &quot;The Weather&quot;: Three series from Wham City, where viewers could call in and either play characters or change the story.
Some of the live stream shows aired edited down versions of their shows on Fridays at 4:00 am, under the collective name &quot;Williams Stream&quot;.

Several previously recorded web series are also available on demand on the website, including &quot;On Cinema at the Cinema&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Decker&quot;, which later became a TV series for Adult Swim.

Almost all of Adult Swim&#x27;s then ongoing web series, including the Adult Swim Streams as a whole, were canceled by November 2020. Adult Swim Smalls, a shorts program produced by &quot;Off the Air&quot;&#x27;s Dave Hughes, was the only web series to remain. Some series, like &quot;On Cinema&quot;, have continued on independently. New web series, including spin-offs of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, started releasing in 2022.

Currently, the website features several free live streams consisting of marathons of specific Adult Swim programming, with the mobile and OTT apps including a few more streams. Additionally, there is &quot;Channel 5&quot;, a live stream consisting of various Tim &amp; Eric productions made for the network, along with original series made for the stream, TimAndEric.com sketches, content made for Jash, and the Super Deluxe series &quot;Tim and Eric Nite Live!&quot;. Some of the marathon streams had chatrooms similar to the live stream, though these were removed along with the live stream chatroom in January 2021.

=== Mobile and OTT applications ===
Since its premiere in 2001, Adult Swim executives have worked extensively to extend the brand&#x27;s reach to viewers in venues outside of the normal pay-television services. This includes the launch of the adultswim.com website and the release of apps for various mobile and over-the-top platforms providing access to current and past Adult Swim programming, live marathons, live and pre-recorded original programs and the nightly online simulcast of the Adult Swim broadcast. Currently apps are available in the U.S. only for Amazon Fire TV, Android (including Google Cast on Android TV), Apple TV, iOS, Chromecast, Roku, and Xbox One. Due to licensing agreements certain parts of the apps including access to its live simulcast and most episodes of their shows require the viewer to use their subscription-television provider or OTT-platform username and password to authenticate their right to access such content.

== International ==
Adult Swim has been actively expanding its reach across the world since 2005. Localized versions have aired in Australia, Russia, Brazil and the rest of Latin America. Adult Swim is usually not paired with Cartoon Network due to local market conditions or government content restrictions and regulations – such as Ofcom in the United Kingdom.
In such markets, Adult Swim programming is licensed to other broadcasters instead.

=== Africa ===
In November 2018, Adult Swim made its African debut in South Africa&#x27;s MultiChoice&#x27;s streaming service Showmax featuring shows such as &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, and &quot;Eagleheart&quot; at launch. In June 2019, the brand was temporarily made available on TNT as a programming block.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===

The Australian and New Zealand version of Adult Swim was broadcast on Cartoon Network until December 31, 2007. Shows aired at that time were &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;, &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law&quot; (which also aired on SBS), &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot;, &quot;Home Movies&quot;, &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, and before its closure, &quot;Squidbillies&quot;. The comedy block aired every Friday and Saturday and an action block aired during the week, including mature anime like &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;InuYasha&quot;, &quot;Bleach&quot;, &quot;Air Gear&quot;, &quot;Black Cat&quot;, and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;.

Presently, original comedies have premiered on The Comedy Channel in Australia. The block would return on The Comedy Channel in March 2008, with &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; joining the lineup on July 1. The channel has also aired &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, but not under the Adult Swim banner. To date, Adult Swim has grown considerably with the block now airing every Saturday from 12 to 2am AEST and 6:30 to 7:30 pm AEST to keep with the late night tradition of the former block.

Adult Swim&#x27;s programming has been released to Region 4 DVD by Madman Entertainment, including shows that have never been shown in Australia. Madman Entertainment has also released R4 exclusive DVDs not available in the United States, including Volume 2 and 3 of &quot;Moral Orel&quot; and complete collections of &quot;Minoriteam&quot; and &quot;Assy McGee&quot;. The &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters&quot; has also been quietly released to DVD.

After moving to The Comedy Channel in January 2008, Adult Swim stopped airing in New Zealand until 2021.

In October 2013, Turner Broadcasting in partnership with MCM Media and Movideo launched an Adult Swim video on demand service.

In June 2016, Channel 9 signed a two-year deal with Turner Broadcasting to air a block of Adult Swim shows on 9Go!. After the deal expired, 9Go! did not renew with Turner Broadcasting, and thus the block was shut down.

In February 2021, TVNZ began airing Adult Swim programming on TVNZ Duke in New Zealand. Shows that are currently airing on the channel, such as &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Birdgirl&quot;, &quot;Eagleheart,&quot; &quot;Mr. Pickles&quot;, &quot;Primal&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot;, &quot;The Shivering Truth&quot;, &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, are available to stream for free on TVNZ+.

As of December 2022, the streaming service Stan has Adult Swim shows such as &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; and &quot;Ballmastrz 9009&quot; available for streaming in Australia. &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; airs on the Foxtel channel Fox8 and on Netflix.

=== Canada ===

The version of Corus Entertainment&#x27;s Teletoon (now Cartoon Network) in English and French previously offered adult-oriented blocks that carried Adult Swim programming and aired similar shows: Teletoon at Night and Télétoon la nuit. On February 2, 2012, then-parent company TELETOON Canada Inc. announced that it would be launching a Canadian version of Adult Swim, sharing channel space with the Canadian version of Cartoon Network as one specialty channel just as its American counterpart does. The block launched on July 4, 2012. From September 2015 – September 2017, all of Adult Swim&#x27;s original series was aired exclusively on the block.

Meanwhile, YTV has aired anime series that premiered on Adult Swim in its Bionix block. G4&#x27;s Anime Current block, Razer&#x27;s (now MTV2) Kamikaze block, the defunct Scream (later Dusk), and Super Channel have also aired various anime titles that were broadcast on Adult Swim. In June 2009, G4 Canada launched &quot;Adult Digital Distraction&quot;, programming that featured many Adult Swim shows. In late 2011, the block was discontinued due to pressure from the CRTC on account of the channel deviating from its original format (which was to air technology-related programming). The block would be briefly relaunched before being dropped again in 2012.

&quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot; aired on Bell Media&#x27;s CTV Comedy Channel (formerly The Comedy Network). In December 2013, sibling network Much began airing &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot; and, later, its spinoff, &quot;Newsreaders&quot;. They also aired the short-lived series &quot;The Jack and Triumph Show&quot;. In October 2014, Netflix began streaming &quot;Mike Tyson Mysteries&quot; the day after its television premiere in the United States.

On February 25, 2016, Williams Street launched a Canada-specific subscription video-on-demand service for iOS and Android devices. The app contains the majority of Adult Swim produced content, including programming not seen on Canadian television. New premieres are added soon after their U.S. broadcast, with the exception of new episodes of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; and, initially, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, which are added the day after its premiere on the Canadian block. The app was discontinued in November 2018.

On March 4, 2019, Teletoon and YTV&#x27;s current parent company, Corus Entertainment, announced the launch of a full-time 24/7 Adult Swim network on April 1, 2019, as a rebrand of Action, which was formerly under the Showcase brand. This marks the first time an international version of Adult Swim was launched as its own television channel. With the channel&#x27;s launch, the Canadian block, as well as Teletoon at Night, were both discontinued as both channels would now focus exclusively on age-appropriate programming. The Canadian Adult Swim block was dropped on March 3, 2019, and Teletoon at Night closed on March 31, 2019.

=== France ===
The block was launched on March 4, 2011, and airs nightly from 11p.m. to 6a.m. on Cartoon Network France. It has aired &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law&quot;, &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;, &quot;Moral Orel&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, and &quot;Squidbillies&quot;. Like most international Adult Swim blocks, it does not air Fox and action shows. Most of the block&#x27;s programming is not dubbed and airs with English audio and French subtitles.

In the early 2000s, there was a late-night block called &quot;DZAQC&quot; (pronounced &quot;Désaxé&quot;), which carried the 2001 Adult Swim look but did not have any adult shows, except for &quot;Home Movies&quot; and &quot;Captain Linger&quot;. &quot;Case Closed&quot; was aired on Cartoon Network and Toonami. DZAQC aired random Cartoon Network shows and old promos in English with French subtitles.

A new Adult Swim block launched in March 2015 on L&#x27;Enôrme TV. The block stopped broadcasting in June 2016.

On May 15, 2019, WarnerMedia France announced that an Adult Swim block would launch in July that year, with season 4 of &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; exclusively airing on it in November. The block launched on July 24, 2019, airing on Warner TV Next (formerly Toonami) between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. CET. On-demand services are available on French online TV and on-demand provider Molotov TV.

=== Germany ===
The Adult Swim block was launched on January 28, 2009, on TNT Serie (now known as WarnerTV Serie). In 2016, TNT Glitz became TNT Comedy (now known as WarnerTV Comedy) and took over Adult Swim. Programs on the block include &quot;American Dad&quot;, &quot;Assy McGee&quot;, &quot;Lucy, The Daughter of the Devil&quot;, &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;, &quot;Moral Orel&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;Stroker &amp; Hoop&quot;, &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, &quot;Venture Bros.&quot;, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force,&quot; and &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot;.

=== Italy ===
In Italy, several Adult Swim series such as &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;China, IL&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Mr. Pickles&quot; are available on-demand via TIMvision. &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; was also dubbed in Italian for release on Netflix, &quot;The Boondocks&quot; aired on Comedy Central and MTV, while &quot;The Oblongs&quot; aired on Italia Teen Television and All Music. On Facebook, Adult Swim Italy has confirmed the possibility of airing on Cartoon Network and Boing. In 2018, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; were released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc from Eagle Pictures in that country.

=== Latin America ===
In Latin America, an Adult Swim block aired during the overnight hours on Cartoon Network beginning on October 7, 2005. It was originally carried on the regional version of the channel, when it was pulled off and picked up by I.Sat on November 19, 2007, another Turner Broadcasting System Latin America-owned-and-operated network.

The premiere of Adult Swim was received by a major backlash from at least a pay TV operator in Latin America. VTR, a Chilean cable TV company, unilaterally censored the block from its premiere until early 2007, due to editorial policies inherited from Ricardo Claro Valdés, one of the company&#x27;s shareholders, infamously known for censoring programming on cable channels while he owned Metropolis Intercom, a company that was absorbed by VTR in 2005.

VTR&#x27;s position was that Cartoon Network should be a children&#x27;s channel and should not carry adult content whatsoever. According to a company study, the audience during Adult Swim&#x27;s time slot was mostly children, which went against the company&#x27;s policies. VTR and Turner Broadcasting System agreed to broadcast Adult Swim on VTR&#x27;s PPV movie service, available only in digital and in some parts of Chile, due to the fact that VTR had not updated its cable TV networks at the time.

In early 2007, Adult Swim returned to the Cartoon Network grid until its first shutdown.

On December 1, 2010, I.Sat revealed that it was cutting Adult Swim programming due to low ratings, adding: &quot;No matter if we add new shows, it would not work&quot;.

In 2014, it was announced that Adult Swim would return to Latin America that same year. Adult Swim premiered on the Brazilian feed of TBS on November 3, 2014. Adult Swim relaunched in Latin America on April 3, 2015, on I.Sat, in English with Spanish subtitles, premiering &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; and many other shows for the first time on the region.

On January 6, 2018, the block began broadcasting throughout Latin America on TBS. Unlike I.Sat, this block was being broadcast in Spanish.

After ceasing broadcasts on I.Sat and TBS, Warner Channel began airing the block on May 2, 2020, for Latin America and Brazil, with new content, such as &quot;Final Space&quot; and the rest of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; and &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; series.

The block lost the schedule from Monday to Thursday and Saturdays on September 14, airing only on Mondays at midnight, and the following month, it stopped releasing new bumpers. On November 15, Adult Swim dropped out of Warner Channel&#x27;s programming, being its last broadcast on November 8, 2021.

On June 24, 2021, HBO Max announced a list of some original Adult Swim content that became available since the platform&#x27;s launch, including: &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Primal&quot;, &quot;Squidbillies&quot;, &quot;The Shivering Truth&quot;, and &quot;Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell&quot;. Its launch took place on June 29, 2021.

On August 22, 2023, it was announced that a 24-hour Adult Swim channel would launch in Latin America in October 2023. On September 3, it was announced that Adult Swim would replace TruTV on October 31.

=== Russia ===
From its relaunch in March 2007 to April 2023, 2x2, a Russian channel specializing in animation, aired Adult Swim&#x27;s original series. There was a separate Adult Swim block, and also an English-language block, where shows were broadcast in English without dubbing, both now being defunct. Adult Swim–produced shows that have aired include &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Moral Orel&quot;, &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;, &quot;12 oz. Mouse&quot;, &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, &quot;Stroker &amp; Hoop&quot;, &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot;, &quot;Squidbillies&quot;, &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Frisky Dingo&quot;, &quot;Perfect Hair Forever&quot;, &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;, &quot;Lucy, the Daughter of the Devil&quot;, and others. 2x2 also broadcast many of the anime that premiered in the U.S. on Adult Swim, although not on 2x2&#x27;s Adult Swim&#x27;s schedule. Some shows including &quot;The Boondocks&quot; and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; also premiered outside Adult Swim&#x27;s block.

On November 1, 2019, 2x2 announced an addition of the Adult Swim section on its site with library containing selected Adult Swim series broadcast earlier on the channel and also new series, like &quot;The Heart, She Holler&quot;, &quot;Off the Air&quot;, &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot;, &quot;Dream Corp LLC&quot;, and &quot;Neon Joe, Werewolf Hunter&quot;, premiering directly on the site uncut. In March 2021, the shows were removed from the site.

As of 2024, the broadcast rights to all Adult Swim shows were expired and, according to 2x2, could no longer be extended.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, Adult Swim was a programming block that aired on Fridays from midnight on the TNT channel, between 2007 and 2012. Despite the fact that the block no longer exists in Spain, several of its original series have their own section on the HBO streaming platform.

In December 2020, Adult Swim returned alongside Toonami as a premium pack of the Orange TV service. In it, there are more than 600 episodes of 19 different series such as &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, among others.

=== United Kingdom and Ireland ===

In 2002, CNX was launched in the United Kingdom as a spin-off of Cartoon Network. It featured much of the content found on Adult Swim and Toonami, anime shows and adult action films, but closed operations after a year in 2003.

A nightly Adult Swim channel was launched on July 8, 2006, on the now defunct Bravo owned by Virgin Media Television, generally starting at midnight. Shows that were previously a part of the UK&#x27;s Adult Swim block are &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;, &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot;, &quot;Squidbillies&quot;, &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;12 oz. Mouse&quot;, &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, &quot;Moral Orel&quot;, and &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;, The first &quot;action&quot; series was the anime &quot;Afro Samurai&quot;, which aired on May 4, 2007, alongside a new UK animated show &quot;Modern Toss&quot;. On July 7, 2008, Adult Swim ceased to broadcast on Bravo.

Former Sony Pictures Television channel TruTV started airing Adult Swim shows every night from 11 pm to around 3 am in November and December 2016. It broadcast episodes of &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Mr. Pickles&quot; and &quot;Squidbillies&quot;.

The UK Adult Swim website offers free access to full episodes of shows including &quot;Squidbillies&quot;, &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot;, &quot;Minoriteam&quot;, &quot;Stroker &amp; Hoop&quot;, &quot;Moral Orel&quot;, &quot;12 oz. Mouse&quot;, &quot;Perfect Hair Forever&quot;, &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;, and &quot;Frisky Dingo&quot;. Revolver Entertainment began distributing original Adult Swim series on DVD in the UK and Ireland.

FX aired &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;Titan Maximum&quot;, &quot;Venture Brothers&quot;, and &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;. These shows were advertised with [adult swim] branding. They began airing on June 5, 2010, in conjunction with the channel&#x27;s regular schedule and ended on November 27, 2010. On December 14, 2011, the &quot;Robot Chicken: Star Wars&quot; trilogy appeared on Syfy at 10 pm. The block began airing on TCM 2 starting on January 4, 2012.

Adult Swim returned to UK and Irish television starting with a new block on the FOX channel on September 4, 2015. This was discontinued in September 2017, and Adult Swim was then not broadcast on television, although &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; has since moved to Comedy Central and is available to stream on Netflix in the UK and Ireland.

Adult Swim once again returned to the UK with a new block on E4 in February 2019. This block shows Adult Swim shows as well as some other shows being able to stream on Channel 4 such as &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty,&quot; and much more. &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; reruns also air on E4 Extra including additional broadcasts of Adult Swim that aren&#x27;t necessarily on a Friday.

== High definition channels and service ==
A high-definition feed of Adult Swim is available on many subscription-television providers, and is shared with its daytime counterpart Cartoon Network. The high-definition feed broadcasts in 1080i high-definition on nearly all providers, and was launched on October 15, 2007, along with Cartoon Network HD. From 2007 to 2023, standard-definition 4:3 content was stretched to 16:9 on the high definition feed to fill the 16:9 aspect ratio, although certain 4:3 content, usually high-definition restorations, were aired in their original aspect ratio with pillarboxing. Starting September 25, 2023, this changed to airing 4:3 content zoomed and cropped to 14:9, before settling on airing all 4:3 content in its original aspect ratio as of October 18, 2023. Network bumpers and promos were still made in the 4:3 aspect ratio until 2010, and therefore also appeared stretched on the high-definition feed. Since May 2013, the high-definition feed is now the primary feed, with the standard-definition feed now just airing a letterboxed version of the high-definition feed.

<text>In geometry, the power center of three circles, also called the radical center, is the intersection point of the three radical axes of the pairs of circles. If the radical center lies outside of all three circles, then it is the center of the unique circle (the radical circle) that intersects the three given circles orthogonally; the construction of this orthogonal circle corresponds to Monge&#x27;s problem. This is a special case of the three conics theorem.

The three radical axes meet in a single point, the radical center, for the following reason. The radical axis of a pair of circles is defined as the set of points that have equal power with respect to both circles. For example, for every point on the radical axis of circles 1 and 2, the powers to each circle are equal: . Similarly, for every point on the radical axis of circles 2 and 3, the powers must be equal, . Therefore, at the intersection point of these two lines, all three powers must be equal, . Since this implies that , this point must also lie on the radical axis of circles 1 and 3. Hence, all three radical axes pass through the same point, the radical center.

The radical center has several applications in geometry. It has an important role in a solution to Apollonius&#x27; problem published by Joseph Diaz Gergonne in 1814. In the power diagram of a system of circles, all of the vertices of the diagram are located at radical centers of triples of circles. The Spieker center of a triangle is the radical center of its excircles. Several types of radical circles have been defined as well, such as the radical circle of the Lucas circles.

<text>The Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&amp;DR) was a railway company that operated in north-east England from 1825 to 1863. The world&#x27;s first public railway to use steam locomotives, its first line connected collieries near with and in County Durham, and was officially opened on 27 September 1825. The movement of coal to ships rapidly became a lucrative business, and the line was soon extended to a at Middlesbrough. While coal waggons were hauled by steam locomotives from the start, passengers were carried in coaches drawn by horses until carriages hauled by steam locomotives were introduced in 1833.

The S&amp;DR was involved in building the East Coast Main Line between and Darlington, but its main expansion was at Middlesbrough Docks and west into Weardale and east to Redcar. It suffered severe financial difficulties at the end of the 1840s and was nearly taken over by the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway, before the discovery of iron ore in Cleveland and the subsequent increase in revenue meant it could pay its debts. At the beginning of the 1860s it took over railways that had crossed the Pennines to join the West Coast Main Line at and Clifton, near .

The company was taken over by the North Eastern Railway in 1863, transferring of line and about 160 locomotives, but continued to operate independently as the Darlington Section until 1876. S&amp;DR opening was seen as proof of steam railway effectiveness and its anniversary was celebrated in 1875, 1925 and 1975. Much of the original route is now served by the Tees Valley Line, operated by Northern.

==Genesis==

===Origins===

Coal from the inland mines in southern County Durham used to be taken away on packhorses, and then horse and carts as the roads were improved. A canal was proposed by George Dixon in 1767 and again by John Rennie in 1815, but both schemes failed. The harbour of Stockton-on-Tees invested considerably during the early 19th century in straightening the Tees in order to improve navigation on the river downstream of the town and was subsequently looking for ways to increase trade to recoup those costs.

A few years later, a canal was proposed on a route that bypassed Darlington and Yarm, and a meeting was held in Yarm to oppose the route. The Welsh engineer George Overton was consulted, and he advised building a tramroad. Overton carried out a survey and planned a route from the Etherley and Witton Collieries to Shildon, and then passing to the north of Darlington to reach Stockton. The Scottish engineer Robert Stevenson was said to favour the railway, and the Quaker Edward Pease supported it at a public meeting in Darlington on 13 November 1818, promising a five per cent return on investment. Approximately two-thirds of the shares were sold locally, and the rest were bought by Quakers nationally. A private bill was presented to Parliament in March 1819, but as the route passed through Earl of Eldon&#x27;s estate and one of the Earl of Darlington&#x27;s fox coverts, it was opposed and defeated by 13 votes.
Overton surveyed a new line that avoided Darlington&#x27;s estate and agreement was reached with Eldon, but another application was deferred early in 1820, as the death of King George III had made it unlikely a bill would pass that parliamentary year. The promoters lodged a bill on 30 September 1820, the route having changed again as agreement had not been reached with Viscount Barrington about the line passing over his land. The railway was unopposed this time, but the bill nearly failed to enter the committee stage as the required four-fifths of shares had not been sold. Pease subscribed £7,000; from that time he had considerable influence over the railway and it became known as &quot;the Quaker line&quot;. The (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 4. c. xliv), which received royal assent on 19 April 1821, allowed for a railway that could be used by anyone with suitably built vehicles on payment of a toll, that was closed at night, and with which land owners within could build branches and make junctions; no mention was made of steam locomotives. This new railway initiated the construction of more railway lines, causing significant developments in railway mapping and cartography, iron and steel manufacturing, as well as in any industries requiring more efficient transportation.

===George Stephenson===
Concerned about Overton&#x27;s competence, Pease asked George Stephenson, an experienced enginewright of the collieries of Killingworth, to meet him in Darlington. On 12 May 1821 the shareholders appointed Thomas Meynell as chairman and Jonathan Backhouse as treasurer; a majority of the managing committee, which included Thomas Richardson, Edward Pease and his son Joseph Pease, were Quakers. The committee designed a seal, showing waggons being pulled by a horse, and adopted the Latin motto &quot;&quot; (&quot;At private risk for public service&quot;). By 23 July 1821 it had decided that the line would be a railway with edge rails, rather than a plateway, and appointed Stephenson to make a fresh survey of the line. Stephenson recommended using malleable iron rails, even though he owned a share of the patent for the alternative cast iron rails, and both types were used. Stephenson was assisted by his 18-year-old son Robert during the survey, and by the end of 1821 had reported that a usable line could be built within the bounds of the act of Parliament, but another route would be shorter by and avoid deep cuttings and tunnels. Overton had kept himself available, but had no further involvement and the shareholders elected Stephenson Engineer on 22 January 1822, with a salary of £660 per year. On 23 May 1822 a ceremony in Stockton celebrated the laying of the first track at St John&#x27;s Well, the rails apart, the same gauge used by Stephenson on his Killingworth Railway.


Stephenson advocated the use of steam locomotives on the line. Pease visited Killingworth in mid-1822 and the directors visited Hetton colliery railway, on which Stephenson had introduced steam locomotives. A new bill was presented, requesting Stephenson&#x27;s deviations from the original route and the use of &quot;loco-motives or moveable engines&quot;, and this received royal assent on 23 May 1823 as the (4 Geo. 4. c. xxxiii). The line included embankments up to high, and Stephenson designed an iron truss bridge to cross the River Gaunless. The Skerne Bridge over the River Skerne was designed by the Durham architect Ignatius Bonomi.

In 1823, Stephenson and Pease opened Robert Stephenson and Company, a locomotive works at Forth Street, Newcastle, from which the following year the S&amp;DR ordered two steam locomotives and two stationary engines. On 16 September 1825, with the stationary engines in place, the first locomotive, &quot;Locomotion No. 1&quot;, left the works, and the following day it was advertised that the railway would open on 27 September 1825.

===Opening===

The cost of building the railway had greatly exceeded the estimates. By September 1825, the company had borrowed £60,000 in short-term loans and needed to start earning an income to ward off its creditors. A railway coach, named &quot;Experiment&quot;, arrived on the evening of 26 September 1825 and was attached to &quot;Locomotion No. 1&quot;, which had been placed on the rails for the first time at Aycliffe Lane station following the completion of its journey by road from Newcastle earlier that same day. Pease, Stephenson and other members of the committee then made an experimental journey to Darlington before taking the locomotive and coach to Shildon in preparation for the opening day, with James Stephenson, George&#x27;s elder brother, at the controls. On 27 September, between 7 am and 8 am, 12 waggons of coal were drawn up Etherley North Bank by a rope attached to the stationary engine at the top, and then let down the South Bank to St Helen&#x27;s Auckland. A waggon of flour bags was attached and horses hauled the train across the Gaunless Bridge to the bottom of Brusselton West Bank, where thousands watched the second stationary engine draw the train up the incline. The train was let down the East Bank to Mason&#x27;s Arms Crossing at Shildon Lane End, where &quot;Locomotion No. 1&quot;, &quot;Experiment&quot; and 21 new coal waggons fitted with seats were waiting.

The directors had allowed room for 300 passengers, but the train left carrying between 450 and 600 people, most travelling in empty waggons but some on top of waggons full of coal. Brakesmen were placed between the waggons, and the train set off, led by a man on horseback with a flag. It picked up speed on the gentle downward slope and reached , leaving behind men on field hunters (horses) who had tried to keep up with the procession. The train stopped when the waggon carrying the company surveyors and engineers lost a wheel; the waggon was left behind and the train continued. The train stopped again, this time for 35 minutes to repair the locomotive and the train set off again, reaching before it was welcomed by an estimated 10,000 people as it came to a stop at the Darlington branch junction. Eight and a half miles () had been covered in two hours, and subtracting the 55 minutes accounted by the two stops, it had travelled at an average speed of . Six waggons of coal were distributed to the poor, workers stopped for refreshments and many of the passengers from Brusselton alighted at Darlington, to be replaced by others.

Two waggons for the Yarm Band were attached, and at 12:30 pm the locomotive started for Stockton, now hauling 31 vehicles with 550 passengers. On the of nearly level track east of Darlington the train struggled to reach more than . At Eaglescliffe near Yarm crowds waited for the train to cross the Stockton to Yarm turnpike. Approaching Stockton, running alongside the turnpike as it skirted the western edge of Preston Park, it gained speed and reached again, before a man clinging to the outside of a waggon fell off and his foot was crushed by the following vehicle. As work on the final section of track to Stockton&#x27;s quayside was still ongoing, the train halted at the temporary passenger terminus at St John&#x27;s Well 3 hours, 7 minutes after leaving Darlington. The opening ceremony was considered a success and that evening 102 people sat down to a celebratory dinner at the Town Hall.

===Early operations===
The railway that opened in September 1825 was long and ran from Phoenix Pit, Old Etherley Colliery, to Cottage Row, Stockton; there was also a branch to the depot at Darlington, of the Hagger Leases branch, and a branch to Yarm. Most of the track used malleable iron rails, and of cast iron rails were used for junctions. The line was single track with four passing loops each mile; square sleepers supported each rail separately so that horses could walk between them. Stone was used for the sleepers to the west of Darlington and oak to the east; Stephenson would have preferred all of them to have been stone, but the transport cost was too high as they were quarried in the Auckland area. The railway opened with the company owing money and unable to raise further loans; Pease advanced money twice early in 1826 so the workers could be paid. By August 1827 the company had paid its debts and was able to raise more money; that month the Black Boy branch opened and construction began on the Croft and Hagger Leases branches. During 1827 shares rose from £120 at the start to £160 at the end.

The line was initially used to carry coal to Darlington and Stockton, carrying 10,000 tons in the first three months and earning nearly £2,000. In Stockton, the price of coal dropped from 18 to 12 shillings, and by the beginning of 1827 was 8 shillings 6 pence (8s 6d). At first, the drivers had been paid a daily wage, but after February 1826 they were paid d per ton per mile; from this they had to pay assistants and fireman and to buy coal for the locomotive. The 1821 act of Parliament had received opposition from the owners of collieries on the River Wear who supplied London and feared competition, and it had been necessary to restrict the rate for transporting coal destined for ships to d per ton per mile, which had been assumed would make the business uneconomic. There was interest from London for 100,000 tons a year, so the company began investigations in September 1825. In January 1826, the first staith opened at Stockton, designed so waggons over a ship&#x27;s hold could discharge coal from the bottom. About 18,500 tons of coal was transported to ships in the year ending June 1827, and this increased to over 52,000 tons the following year, 44.5% of the total carried.

The locomotives were unreliable at first. Soon after opening, &quot;Locomotion No. 1&quot; broke a wheel, and it was not ready for traffic until 12 or 13 October; &quot;Hope&quot;, the second locomotive, arrived in November 1825 but needed a week to ready it for the line – the cast-iron wheels were a source of trouble. Two more locomotives of a similar design arrived in 1826; that August, 16s 9d was spent on ale to motivate the men maintaining the engines. By the end of 1827, the company had also bought &quot;Chittaprat&quot; from Robert Wilson and &quot;Experiment&quot; from Stephenson. Timothy Hackworth, locomotive superintendent, used the boiler from the unsuccessful &quot;Chittaprat&quot; to build the &quot;Royal George&quot; in the works at Shildon; it started work at the end of November. John Wesley Hackworth later published an account stating that locomotives would have been abandoned were it not for the fact that Pease and Thomas Richardson were partners with Stephenson in the Newcastle works, and that when Timothy Hackworth was commissioned to rebuild &quot;Chittaprat&quot; it was &quot;as a last experiment&quot; to &quot;make an engine in his own way&quot;. Both Tomlinson and Rolt state this claim was unfounded and the company had shown earlier that locomotives were superior to horses, Tomlinson showing that coal was being moved using locomotives at half the cost of horses. Robert Young states that the company was unsure as to the real costs as they reported to shareholders in 1828 that the saving using locomotives was 30 per cent. Young also showed that Pease and Richardson were both concerned about their investment in the Newcastle works and Pease unsuccessfully tried to sell his share to George Stephenson.

New locomotives were ordered from Stephenson&#x27;s, but the first was too heavy when it arrived in February 1828. It was rebuilt with six wheels and hailed as a great improvement, Hackworth being told to convert the remaining locomotives as soon as possible. In 1828, two locomotive boilers exploded within four months, both killing the driver and both due to the safety valves being left fixed down while the engine was stationary. Horses were also used on the line, and they could haul up to four waggons. The dandy waggon was introduced in mid-1828; it was a small cart at the end of the train that carried the horse downhill, allowing it to rest while the train descended under gravity. The S&amp;DR made their use compulsory from November 1828.

Passenger traffic started on 10 October 1825, after the required licence was purchased, using the &quot;Experiment&quot; coach hauled by a horse. The coach was initially timetabled to travel from Stockton to Darlington in two hours, with a fare of 1s, and made a return journey four days a week and a one-way journey on Tuesdays and Saturdays. In April 1826, the operation of the coach was contracted for £200 a year; by then the timetabled journey time had been reduced to 1 hour 15 minutes, and passengers were allowed to travel on the outside for 9d. A more comfortable coach, &quot;Express&quot;, started the same month and charged 1s 6d for travel inside. Innkeepers began running coaches, two to Shildon from July, and the &quot;Union&quot;, which served the Yarm branch from 16 October. There were no stations: in Darlington the coaches picked up passengers near the north road crossing, whereas in Stockton they picked up at different places on the quay. Between 30,000 and 40,000 passengers were carried between July 1826 and June 1827.

==Founding of Middlesbrough==
The export of coal had become the railway&#x27;s main business, but the staiths at Stockton had inadequate storage and the size of ships was limited by the depth of the Tees. A branch from Stockton to Haverton, on the north bank of the Tees, was proposed in 1826, and the engineer Thomas Storey proposed a shorter and cheaper line to Middlesbrough, south of the Tees in July 1827. Later approved by George Stephenson, this plan was ratified by the shareholders on 26 October. The Tees Navigation Company was about to improve the river and proposed that the railway delay application to Parliament, but, despite opposition, at a meeting in January 1828 it was decided to proceed. A more direct northerly route from Auckland to the Tees had been considered since 1819, and the Tees &amp; Weardale Railway had applied unsuccessfully to Parliament for permission for such a line in 1823, 1824 and 1825. This now became a line linking Simpasture on the S&amp;DR&#x27;s line near today&#x27;s Newton Aycliffe station with Haverton and Stockton, via a route that was shorter than via the route of the S&amp;DR, and named the Clarence Railway in honour of the Duke of Clarence, later King William IV. Meetings held in Stockton in early 1828 supported the Tees Navigation and the Clarence Railway, but the S&amp;DR received permission for its branch on 23 May 1828 after promising to complete the Hagger Leases Branch and to build a bridge across the Tees at least wide and above low water, so as not to affect shipping. Two members of the management committee resigned, as they felt that Stockton would be adversely affected by the line, and Meynell, the S&amp;DR chairman, stepped down from leadership. The Clarence Railway was approved a few days later, with the same gauge as the S&amp;DR. The route of the Clarence Railway was afterwards amended to reach Samphire Batts, later known as Port Clarence, and traffic started in August 1833; by the middle of 1834 Port Clarence had opened and of line was in use. The S&amp;DR charged the d per ton per mile landsale rate for coal it carried the from the collieries to Simpasture for forwarding to Port Clarence, rather than the lower shipping rate. By July 1834, the Exchequer Loan Commissioners had taken control of the Clarence Railway.

The Croft branch opened in October 1829. Construction of the suspension bridge across the Tees started in July 1829, but was suspended in October after the Tees Navigation Company pointed out the S&amp;DR had no permission to cross the Old Channel of the Tees. The S&amp;DR prepared to return to Parliament but withdrew after a design for a drawbridge was agreed with the Navigation Company. The line to Middlesbrough was laid with malleable iron rails weighing , resting on oak blocks. The suspension bridge had been designed to carry 150 tons, but the cast iron retaining plates split when it was tested with just 66 tons and loaded trains had to cross with the waggons split into groups of four linked by a chain. For the opening ceremony on 27 December 1830, &quot;Globe&quot;, a new locomotive designed by Hackworth for passenger trains, hauled people in carriages and waggons fitted with seats across the bridge to the staiths at Port Darlington, which had berths for six ships. Stockton continued to be served by a station on the line to the quay until 1848, when it was replaced by a station on the Middlesbrough line on the other side of the Tees. Before May 1829, Thomas Richardson had bought about near Port Darlington, and with Joseph and Edward Pease and others he formed the Owners of the Middlesbrough Estate to develop it. Middlesbrough had only a few houses before the coming of the railway, but a year later had a population of over 2,000 and at the 2011 census had over 138,000 people.

==Railway improvements==

In 1830, the company opened new offices at the corner of Northgate and Union Street in Darlington. Between 1831 and 1832 a second track was laid between Stockton and the foot of Brusselton Bank. Workshops were built at Shildon for the maintenance and construction of locomotives. In 1830 approximately 50 horses shared the traffic with 19 locomotives, but travelled at different speeds, so to help regulate traffic horse-drawn trains were required to operate in groups of four or five. This had led to horses, startled by a passing locomotive and coming off their dandy cart, being run down by the following train. On one occasion a driver fell asleep in the dandy cart of the preceding train and his horse, no longer being led, came to a stop and was run down by a locomotive. The rule book stated that locomotive-hauled trains had precedence over horse-drawn trains, but some horse drivers refused to give way and on one occasion a locomotive had to follow a horse-drawn train for over . The committee decided in 1828 to replace horses with locomotives on the main line, starting with the coal trains, but there was resistance from some colliery owners. After the S&amp;DR bought out the coach companies in August 1832, a mixed passenger and small goods service began between Stockton and Darlington on 7 September 1833, travelling at ; locomotive-hauled services began to Shildon in December 1833 and to Middlesbrough on 7 April 1834. The company had returned the five per cent dividend that had been promised by Edward Pease, and this had increased to eight per cent by the time he retired in 1832. When the treasurer Jonathan Backhouse retired in 1833 to become a Quaker minister, he was replaced by Joseph Pease.

==The way north==

===Great North of England Railway===

On 13 October 1835, the York and North Midland Railway (Y&amp;NMR) was formed to connect York to London by a line to a junction with the planned North Midland Railway. Representatives of the Y&amp;NMR and S&amp;DR met two weeks later and formed the Great North of England Railway (GNER), a line from York to Newcastle that used the route of the Croft branch at Darlington. The railway was to be built in sections, and to allow both to open at the same time permission for the more difficult line through the hills from Darlington to Newcastle was to be sought in 1836 and a bill for the easier line south of Darlington to York presented the following year. Pease specified a formation wide enough for four tracks, so freight could be carried at and passengers at , and George Stephenson had drawn up detailed plans by November. The act of Parliament for the from Newcastle to Darlington was given royal assent on 4 July 1836, but little work had been done by the time the from Croft to York received permission on 12 July the following year. In August a general meeting decided to start work on the southern section, but construction was delayed, and after several bridges collapsed the engineer Thomas Storey was replaced by Robert Stephenson. The S&amp;DR sold its Croft branch to the GNER, and the railway opened for coal traffic on 4 January 1841 using S&amp;DR locomotives. The railway opened to passengers with its own locomotives on 30 March.

Between November 1841 and February 1842, the S&amp;DR introduced a service between Darlington and Coxhoe, on the Clarence Railway, where an omnibus took passengers the to the Durham &amp; Sunderland Railway at Shincliffe. Early in 1842, the nominally independent Shildon Tunnel Company opened its tunnel through the hills at Shildon to the Wear basin and after laying of track to South Church station, south of Bishop Auckland, opened in May 1842. In 1846, the S&amp;DR installed Alexander Bain&#x27;s &quot;I and V&quot; electric telegraph to regulate the passage of trains through the tunnel. The SD&amp;R provided a hour service between Darlington and Newcastle, with a four-horse omnibus from South Church to Rainton Meadows on the Durham Junction Railway, from where trains ran to Gateshead, on the south side of the River Tyne near Newcastle.

===Railway operations in the 1830s===
By 1839, the track had been upgraded with rails weighing . The railway had about 30 steam locomotives, most of them six coupled, that ran with four-wheeled tenders with two water butts, each capable of holding of water. The line descended from Shildon to Stockton, assisting the trains that carried coal to the docks at a maximum speed of ; the drivers were fined if caught travelling faster than , and one was dismissed for completing the forty-mile return journey in  hours. On average there were about 40 coal trains a day, hauling 28 waggons with a weight of 116 tons. There were about 5,000 privately owned waggons, and at any one time about 1,000 stood at Shildon depot.

The railway had modern passenger locomotives, some with four wheels. There were passenger stations at Stockton, Middlesbrough, Darlington, Shildon and West Auckland, and trains also stopped at Middlesbrough Junction, Yarm Junction, Fighting Cocks and Heighington. Some of the modified road coaches were still in use, but there were also modern railway carriages, some first class with three compartments each seating eight passengers, and second class carriages that seated up to 40. Luggage and sometimes the guard travelled on the carriage roof; a passenger travelling third class suffered serious injuries after falling from the roof in 1840. Passenger trains averaged , and a speed of was recorded. Over 200,000 passengers were carried in the year to 1 October 1838, and in 1839 there were twelve trains each day between Middlesbrough and Stockton, six trains between Stockton and Darlington, and three between Darlington and Shildon, where a carriage was fitted with Rankine&#x27;s self-acting brake, taken over the Brussleton Inclines, and then drawn by a horse to St Helen Auckland. The Bradshaw&#x27;s railway guide for March 1843, after South Church opened, shows five services a day between Darlington and South Church via Shildon, with three between Shildon and St Helens. Also listed were six trains between Stockton and Hartlepool via Seaton over the Clarence Railway and the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway that had opened in 1841.

By this time, Port Darlington had become overwhelmed by the volume of imports and exports and work started in 1839 on Middlesbrough Dock, which had been laid out by William Cubitt, capable of holding 150 ships, and built by resident civil engineer George Turnbull. The suspension bridge across the Tees was replaced by a cast iron bridge on masonry piers in 1841. After three years and an expenditure of £122,000 (equivalent to £9.65m at 2011 prices), the formal opening of the new dock took place on 12 May 1842. The S&amp;DR provided most of the finance, and the dock was absorbed by the company in 1849.

===Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway===

The GNER had authority for a railway from York to Newcastle; it opened to Darlington in 1841 having spent all of its authorised capital and could not start work on the extension to Newcastle. At the time Parliament was considering the route of a railway between England and Scotland and favoured a railway via the west coast. Railway financier George Hudson chaired a meeting of representatives of north-eastern railways that wished a railway to be built via the east coast. In the 1830s a number of railways had opened in the area between Darlington and Newcastle, and Robert Stephenson was engaged to select a route using these railways as much as possible. The Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway (N&amp;DJR) differed slightly from the GNER route in the southern section before joining the Durham Junction Railway at Rainton and using the Pontop &amp; South Shields Railway from Washington to Brockley Whins, where a new curve onto the Brandling Junction Railway allowed direct access to Gateshead. This required the construction of of new line, less than the GNER route, but trains would need to travel further.

This route ran parallel to S&amp;DR lines for and Pease argued that it should run over these as it would add only . The bill was presented unchanged to Parliament in 1842, and was opposed by the S&amp;DR. Despite this, the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway Act 1842 (5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. lxxx) received royal assent on 18 June 1842, and a second act of Parliament the following year, the Great North of England Railway Act 1843 (6 &amp; 7 Vict. c. viii), secured the deviations from the GNER route in the south recommended by Stephenson. After the opening celebration on 18 June 1844, through services ran from London to Gateshead the following day.

The N&amp;DJR made an offer to lease the GNER and buy it within five years, and GNER shares increased in value by 44 per cent as the N&amp;DJR took over on 1 July 1845; the N&amp;DJR became part of the larger York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway (YN&amp;BR) in 1847.

==Wear Valley Railway==

The Bishop Auckland &amp; Weardale Railway (BA&amp;WR) received permission in the (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. cxxii) of July 1837 to build an line from South Church to . The line opened on 8 November 1843 with a station at .

The Stanhope and Tyne Railway, a line between South Shields and Stanhope had opened in 1834. Steam locomotives worked the section east of Annfield, and in the western section inclines were worked by stationary engines or gravity, with horses hauling waggons over level track. The lime kilns and the line between Stanhope and Carrhouse closed in 1840, and with the Stanhope to Annfield section losing money, the insolvent railway company was dissolved on 5 February 1841. The northern section became the Pontop and South Shields Railway and the southern section from Stanhope to Carrhouse was bought by the newly formed Derwent Iron Company at Consett, renamed the Wear &amp; Derwent Railway, and used to transport limestone from quarries in the Stanhope area to its works at Consett. The Weardale Extension Railway ran from Waskerley on the Wear &amp; Derwent to Crook on the BA&amp;WR and included the Sunniside Incline worked by a stationary engine. Sponsored by the Derwent Iron Company, the line was built by the S&amp;DR and opened on 16 May 1845. A passenger service started to Hownes Gill and Stanhope (Crawley) on 1 September 1845; the Stanhope service was withdrawn at the end of 1846. Travelling north from Crook the carriages and waggons were drawn up the Sunniside Incline, a locomotive hauled the mixed train to Waskerley Park Junction, then they were let down Nanny Mayor&#x27;s Incline and a locomotive took them forward. When returning, regulations required that the carriages run loose down the Sunniside Incline and they were let to run into Crook station, controlled by the guard using the carriage brakes. Later, a viaduct replaced the two inclines at Hownes Gill ravine on 1 July 1858. A deviation replacing Nanny&#x27;s Mayor&#x27;s Incline, as well as a curve that allowed trains from Crook direct access to Rowley, was opened for freight on 23 May 1859 and for passenger traffic on 4 July 1859.
The Middlesbrough &amp; Redcar Railway, a short extension to Redcar, received permission on 21 July 1845 in the Middlesbrough and Redcar Railway Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. cxxvii). The line branched off before the Middlesbrough terminus, which was closed and a new through station opened with the line on 4 June 1846. Also authorised in July 1845, by the (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. clii), was the Wear Valley Railway, a line from the Bishop Auckland &amp; Weardale line to . The line opened on 3 August 1847, and the act also gave the S&amp;DR permission for the Bishopley branch, over which 500,000 tons of limestone travelled in 1868. The line was extended in 1862 from Frosterley to .

Just before the line opened on 22 July 1847, the Wear Valley Railway absorbed the Shildon Tunnel, Bishop Auckland &amp; Weardale Railway, Weardale Extension Railway and Wear &amp; Derwent Railway and then the S&amp;DR leased the Wear Valley Railway and Middlesbrough &amp; Redcar Railways for 999 years. This required a payment of £47,000 each year, exceeding the SD&amp;R&#x27;s net revenue; traffic from the Derwent Iron Company was reduced during a period of financial difficulty and the Black Boy colliery switched to sending its coal to Hartlepool. No dividend was paid in 1848 and the next few years; lease payments were made out of reserves. The S&amp;DR announced a bill in November 1848 to permit a lease by and amalgamation with the YN&amp;BR, but this was withdrawn after the YN&amp;BR share price crashed and its chairman Hudson resigned after questions were raised about his share dealings. In 1850 the S&amp;DR had share capital of £250,000 but owed £650,000, most of this without the authority of Parliament until 1849; the debt was converted into shares in 1851.

==Cleveland iron ore==
In mid-1850, Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan discovered a seam of iron ore at Eston. They opened a mine, laid a branch line to the Middlesbrough &amp; Redcar Railway and started hauling ironstone over the S&amp;DR to their blast furnaces west of Bishop Auckland. By 1851, Derwent Iron had opened a mine in the area and began moving ironstone to Consett, and the S&amp;DR had paid the arrears on its debt and was able to pay a dividend the following year, albeit only 4 per cent; between 1849 and 1853 the traffic more than doubled.

In 1852, the Leeds Northern Railway (LNR) built a line from Northallerton to a junction with the Stockton to Hartlepool line and a section of the route ran parallel to the S&amp;DR alongside the Yarm to Stockton Road. The S&amp;DR was originally on the east side of the road, but the LNR built its line with four tracks on the other side of the road, leasing two to the S&amp;DR for a rental of 1s a year. On 25 January 1853, the LNR and SD&amp;R opened a joint station at with an island platform between the tracks, and one side was used by S&amp;DR trains and the other by the LNR. Rather than allow trains to approach the platform line from either direction, the Board of Trade inspecting officer ruled that trains approaching on a line without a platform must first pass through and then reverse into the platform line.

The Middlesbrough &amp; Guisborough Railway, with two branches into the iron-rich hills, was approved by Parliament in the (15 &amp; 16 Vict. c. lxxiii) on 17 June 1852; Pease had to guarantee dividends to raise the finance needed. The single-track railway was worked by the S&amp;DR, and opened to minerals on 11 November 1853 and passengers on 25 February 1854. With electric telegraph installed between stations, passenger trains were not permitted to leave a station until confirmation had been received that the line was clear.

By 1857, a blast furnace had opened close to the Durham coalfield on the north side of the Tees. Backed by the rival West Hartlepool Harbour &amp; Railway, the Durham &amp; Cleveland Union Railway proposed a line from the mines in Skinningrove and Staithes, via Guisborough and a bridge over the Middlesbrough &amp; Redcar Railway to a jetty at Cargo Fleet, from where a ferry would carry the ore across the Tees to the blast furnaces. When the proposal was before Parliament the S&amp;DR suggested that their Middlesbrough &amp; Redcar could be extended to Saltburn, and the Tees crossed by a swing bridge. The Cleveland Railway received permission for a line from Skinningrove as far as Guisborough, and the S&amp;DR permission for an extension to Saltburn and a branch to a mine at Skelton. This Stockton and Darlington Railway Amalgamation Act 1858 (21 &amp; 22 Vict. c. cxvi) also authorised the merger of the S&amp;DR with the railways it held on lease.

An application to Parliament for a jetty in the following year was unsuccessful, but in 1860 the Upsall, Normanby &amp; Ormesby Railway received permission for a line with access to the river, the S&amp;DR claim of exclusive rights to the foreshore having been rejected. The jetty was also opposed by the Tees Conservancy Commissioners and they moored barges along the foreshore to obstruct construction. In what became known as the Battle of the Tees, a fight broke out when a steam tug sent by the commissioners interrupted men moving the barges. The barges were successfully moved, but a more serious fight developed the following night when three of the commissioners&#x27; steam tugs arrived. The police then kept watch on the works until they were finished.

Henry Pease, a S&amp;DR director and Quaker, visited his brother Joseph in mid-1859 at his house by the sea at Marske-by-the-Sea. Returning late for dinner, he explained he had walked to Saltburn, then a group of fisherman&#x27;s cottages, where he had had a &quot;sort of prophetic vision&quot; of a town with gardens. With other S&amp;DR directors he planned the town, with gardens and Zetland Hotel by the station, and bought a house at 5 Britannia Terrace, where he stayed for a few weeks every summer. The extension opened in 1861, a station on the through line replacing the terminus at Redcar.

==Over Stainmore==

A railway to serve Barnard Castle, from the S&amp;DR at a junction near North Road station and along the River Tees, was proposed in 1852; this route bypassed as far as possible the Duke of Cleveland&#x27;s estate, as he had opposed an earlier railway. An application that year failed, but the Darlington and Barnard Castle Railway Act 1854 (17 &amp; 18 Vict. c. cxv) was given royal assent on 3 July 1854 and the railway opened on 8 July 1856.
Cleveland iron ore is high in phosphorus and needs to be mixed with purer ores, such as those on the west coast in Cumberland and Lancashire. In the early 1850s, this ore was travelling the long way round over the Newcastle &amp; Carlisle Railway to the Barrow-in-Furness area, and Durham coke was returning. Both the South Durham &amp; Lancashire Union Railway (SD&amp;LUR) and the Eden Valley Railway (EVR) companies were formed on 20 September 1856. Taking advantage of the new railway at Barnard Castle, the SD&amp;LUR crossed the Pennines via Kirkby Stephen to meet the West Coast Main Line (WCML) at Tebay, on the section then controlled by the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, and also linked Barnard Castle with West Auckland. The EVR was a branch from Kirkby Stephen to the WCML near Penrith via Appleby. The routes were surveyed by Thomas Bouch and SD&amp;LUR received permission on 13 July 1857. The EVR route followed the east bank of the River Eden, a mile longer than a more expensive route on the west bank, and its act of Parliament received royal assent on 21 May 1858.

Bouch had laid out an economical route that followed the contours and avoided tunnels, but there were formidable gradients up to the Stainmore Summit. Land for two tracks was purchased, and a single track line was laid; valleys were crossed by viaducts, three made from wrought iron, including the Belah Viaduct, long and high. A new station was built to replace the terminus at Barnard Castle. A mineral train ran between Barnard Castle and Barras on 26 March 1861, and mineral traffic worked through to Tebay from 4 July 1861. There was an opening ceremony on 7 August 1861 and the SD&amp;LUR west of Barnard Castle opened to passengers the following day. Two locomotives with enclosed cabs had been built for the line in 1860 by Stephenson and Co, and the S&amp;DR worked traffic from the start: two return services a day were provided for passengers. The EVR opened to mineral traffic on 8 April 1862 and passengers on 9 June 1862, to the south-facing junction at Clifton (later ). The S&amp;DR had presented a bill in 1861 to provide better connections for passengers on the WCML by extending the line up to , and to link up with the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway to provide access for mineral traffic to Cumberland. The L&amp;CR agreed to allow the S&amp;DR running rights over its line and services were extended to Penrith from 1 August 1863.

==Progress and amalgamation==

In 1854, there were five or six trains a day between Darlington and Redcar and three a day between Darlington and Frosterley. Travelling at average speeds of , passengers were charged from 1d per mile for third class to 2.2d per mile for first. Horses were still used on trains in the mid-1850s: a horse-drawn coach was still independently operated between Middlesbrough and Stockton in 1854 on Sundays, as the only S&amp;DR services that run on that day were the mail trains, and locomotives replaced horses on passenger trains to West Auckland in 1856. The S&amp;DR opened a carriage works south of Darlington North Road station in 1853 and later it built a locomotive works nearby to replace its works at Shildon. Designed by William Bouch, who had taken over from Hackworth as Locomotive Supervisor in 1840, it completed its first locomotive in 1864. In 1858 the Brusselton Inclines were bypassed by a line from the north end of Shildon Tunnel; the same year a passenger service started on the Hagger Leases branch and a mineral line opened from Crook via two inclines to Waterhouse. The section of the SD&amp;LUR between West Auckland and Barnard Castle opened for minerals in July 1863 and passengers on 1 August 1863, together with a direct line from Bishop Auckland to West Auckland. Stations at Evenwood and Cockfield replaced stations on the Hagger Leases branch.
In 1859, a company had been formed to link the Newcastle &amp; Carlisle Railway with the SD&amp;R via the Derwent Valley; by 1860 this had grown into the Newcastle, Derwent &amp; Weardale Railway, which now bypassed the SD&amp;R and linked with the SD&amp;LUR, and the North British and London and North Western (LNWR) railways were providing two-thirds of the capital. The LNWR proposed to build warehouses in Hartlepool and buy shares in the West Hartlepool Harbour &amp; Railway. The North Eastern Railway (NER), formed in 1854 by amalgamation, at the time was the largest railway company in the country and controlled the East Coast Main Line from Knottingley, south of York, through Darlington to Berwick-upon-Tweed. When they approached the S&amp;DR with a proposal to merge, the directors deciding they preferred a merger with the NER than eventually becoming part of the LNWR, entered negotiations. Opposed by the NER, the Newcastle, Derwent &amp; Weardale Railway bill was approved by the House of Commons in 1861, but the line was eventually rejected by the House of Lords. The SD&amp;LUR and EVR were absorbed by the S&amp;DR on 30 June 1862.

With of line and about 160 locomotives, the Stockton and Darlington Railway became part of the North Eastern Railway on 13 July 1863. Due to a clause in the act of Parliament, the railway was managed as the independent Darlington Section until 1876, when the lines became the NER&#x27;s Central Division. After the restoration of the dividend in 1851, by the end of 1854 payments had recovered to 8 per cent and then had not dropped below per cent.

==Later history==
The NER had built a branch in the late 1850s from Durham to Bishop Auckland, but used a separate station in the town until December 1867, when all services began to use the S&amp;DR station. The Sunniside Incline was replaced by a deviation, albeit with gradients of 1 in 51 and 1 in 52, which opened for mineral traffic on 10 April 1867 and for passengers on 2 March 1868; after 1868 trains on this line were extended to serve Benfieldside station (later known as Blackhill and then Consett). In Cleveland, a branch from Nunthorpe to Battersby opened on 1 June 1864; passengers were carried from 1 April 1868. A branch from Barnard Castle to Middleton-in-Teesdale opened on 12 May 1868.

The locomotive works at Darlington operated independently under Bouch until 1875, the locomotives having been renumbered by the NER a few years earlier. A variety of locomotives were used, the most common type were the s used on mineral trains. Later locomotives were of the Stephenson long boilered type. Most passenger locomotives were s, though some were s. Bouch designed two locomotives for the line over Stainmore in 1860, and another fourteen with this wheel arrangement had been built by 1874. S&amp;DR services and those on the ECML called at different stations in Darlington until 1887, when S&amp;DR trains were diverted through a rebuilt Darlington Bank Top station, rejoining the route to Stockton from a junction south of Darlington and a new line to Oak Tree Junction. An extension from Stanhope to opened in 1895, and the line over Stainmore to Tebay was doubled by the end of the century.

From 1913 former S&amp;DR lines were electrified with 1,500 VDC overhead lines and electric locomotives hauled coal trains between Shildon and Erimus Marshalling Yard, which had opened in 1908 between Middlesbrough and Thornaby. The trains took the former S&amp;DR line from Shildon to Simpasture Junction, joining the former Clarence Railway line to Carlton, where a later line allowed access to the Stockton to Middlesbrough extension. The locomotives operated for 20 years, but then coal traffic had reduced, which made it uneconomical to maintain the electrification system.

As a result of the Railways Act 1921, on 1 January 1923 the North Eastern Railway became the North Eastern area of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The passenger service was withdrawn north of Tow Law on 1 May 1939. Britain&#x27;s railways were nationalised on 1 January 1948 and the lines were placed under the control of British Railways. In the early 1950s control was split between the North Eastern and London Midland regions with Kirkby Stephen as the boundary. Local passenger trains were withdrawn between Kirkby Stephen and Tebay on 1 December 1952. The service along Weardale was withdrawn on 29 June 1953 and services north of Crook on 11 June 1956.

The 1955 Modernisation Plan, known formally as the &quot;Modernisation and Re-Equipment of the British Railways&quot;, was published in December 1954. With the aim of increasing speed and reliability steam trains were replaced with electric and diesel traction. From 1954 diesel multiple units took over passenger services in the north east except those on the ECML, and were introduced to the line over Stainmore in February 1958. The passenger service was withdrawn between Barnard Castle and Penrith on 20 January 1962, and between Bishop Auckland and Barnard Castle on 12 June 1962.

In 1963, Richard Beeching published his report &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot;, which recommended closing the network&#x27;s least used stations and lines. This included the remaining former S&amp;DR lines except for the line between Darlington and Saltburn via Stockton and Middlesbrough. Passenger service between Nunthorpe and Guisborough was withdrawn in 1964; the service between Middlesbrough and Nunthorpe was retained. The line between Darlington and Barnard Castle and the branch to Middleton-in-Teesdale were closed to passengers on 30 November 1964. Trains were withdrawn north of Bishop Auckland on 8 March 1965, but the passenger service to Bishop Auckland was saved because of regional development concerns.

==Locomotives==
==Accidents and incidents==
*On 5 March 1827, an unnamed woman described as &quot;a blind American beggar&quot; was fatally injured by a train on the railway. This was the first recorded death due to a railway locomotive, coming three years before the more widely reported death of William Huskisson at the Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.
*On 19 March 1828, the boiler of locomotive No. 5 exploded at Simpasture Junction. One of the two firemen was killed, the other severely scalded. The driver (George Stephenson&#x27;s older brother) was unharmed.
*On 1 July 1828, the boiler of &quot;Locomotion No. 1&quot; exploded at station, killing the driver.
*On 4 April 1865 at Hartburn (Stockton), the 3:55 pm passenger train from Darlington to Saltburn collided with some chaldron wagons which had become detached from a Shildon to Middlesbrough coal train. Though this was not a serious accident it was to result in the S&amp;DR adopting the block system, well before their colleagues at the NER headquarters in York felt this to be necessary. At a conference the next day attended by several company officials including Thomas MacNay and William Bouch it was noted that one of the options to achieve greater security was ‘to adopt the ‘block’ system of telegraph at intervals of 2 or 3 miles; that is not to allow an engine to pass any of such stations until it has been signalled that the previous train was past the station to which it was approaching.’

==Anniversary celebrations==

The Stockton and Darlington was not the first railway and a train had previously carried passengers, but its opening in 1825 was seen as proof of the effectiveness of steam railways as a means of public transport. A jubilee was held on 27 and 28 September 1875 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the world&#x27;s first steam operated public railway: the Darlington North Road workshops housed a locomotive exhibition, a statue of Joseph Pease was unveiled in Darlington, his portrait presented to the Darlington Corporation and a banquet held. Fifty years later centenary celebrations were held in July to allow guests from foreign countries visiting the International Railway Congress to take part. An exhibition of rolling stock at the new Faverdale Wagon Works in Darlington was opened by the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and the Queen Mother). The following day the royal couple watched as procession of locomotives passed between Stockton and Oak Tree Junction, starting with a Hetton Colliery locomotive that had been built in 1822 and finishing with a replica train of ten chaldron waggons and &quot;the company&#x27;s coach&quot; hauled by &quot;Locomotive No.1&quot; propelled by a petrol engine in a specially built tender.
A festival was held in Belle Vue, Manchester on 27 September 1925, a Sunday to allow railwaymen to attend, where a pageant showed how transport had changed through time, beginning with a group of ancient Britons dragging a log with their belongings on top and ending with Stephenson&#x27;s Rocket; another procession included &quot;Locomotion No.1&quot;, propelled by its tender, and more modern locomotives. On 31 August 1975, to celebrate the 150th anniversary, a cavalcade was held between Shildon and Heighington, where a replica of &quot;Locomotion&quot; headed a procession of locomotives, which was completed by the prototype high-speed train. In the same year the National Railway Museum opened in York, combining exhibits from the former LNER museum in York, which had opened after the 1875 festivities, and from the National Transport Museum at Clapham.

==Legacy==
===Heritage===

At , the station buildings and goods shed are Grade II* listed as the Head of Steam museum. Nearby, the former carriage works are now used as workshops for steam locomotives. A little further east is Skerne Bridge, the oldest railway bridge in continuous use in the world. At Shildon is the Locomotion Museum, part of the National Railway Museum group, which contains heritage railway vehicles, including &quot;Locomotion No. 1&quot;. The site includes Timothy Hackworth&#x27;s house, the Soho Workshop and a former coal drops, which are listed buildings. The heritage Weardale Railway runs special services over its line from Bishop Auckland to Eastgate-in-Weardale.

On 14 June 2007, during excavations for road building, some of the original stone sleepers used by the railway in 1825 were discovered intact near Lingfield Point. The stones each weigh about and have bolt holes for the chairs that secured the rail. Officials involved in the road project hope to preserve the stones along a new bicycle path.
===Modern services===
The current Tees Valley Line uses most of the former Stockton and Darlington Railway between Bishop Auckland and Saltburn. From Bishop Auckland the non-electrified line is single track to Shildon, double track to Heighington, and single track to the junction with the East Coast Main Line north of Darlington. This section is a Community Rail service called the Bishop line, and is sometimes known as the Heritage Line because of its links with the S&amp;DR. South of Darlington, trains take the 1887 line before joining the original 1825 route to Stockton at the site of Oak Tree Junction. The line is to Eaglescliffe South Junction, where the 1853 Leeds Northern route is taken through Eaglescliffe station to Stockton Cut Junction. The non-electrified line then follows the S&amp;DR route for to Saltburn, except for later deviations at Thornaby (1908) and Redcar (1978). The former Middlesbrough &amp; Guisborough Railway line is open between Guisborough Junction and Nunthorpe as part of the Community Rail Esk Valley Line to Whitby.
 a two train per hour off-peak service is provided by Northern between Saltburn and Darlington, and ten trains a day continue to Bishop Auckland. One train per hour leaves Middlesbrough going south to Manchester Airport via Yarm and another travels north to Newcastle via Sunderland. There are eighteen trains a day between Middlesbrough and Nunthorpe, and four of these continue to Whitby. Tees Valley Unlimited, the local enterprise partnership, published its ambition to improve passenger services, with the priority of an all day two trains an hour service over the Darlington to Saltburn and Nunthorpe to Hartlepool routes using new trains; additional platforms are needed at Darlington station to allow this service frequency. A station serving James Cook University Hospital opened in May 2014. A Hitachi train plant opened in September 2015 at Newton Aycliffe to build trains for the Intercity Express Programme.

<text>Arthur Henry Hallam (1 February 1811 – 15 September 1833) was an English poet, best known as the subject of a major work, &quot;In Memoriam&quot;, by his close friend and fellow poet Alfred Tennyson. Hallam has been described as the &quot;jeune homme fatal&quot; (French for &quot;deadly [seductive] young man&quot;) of his generation.

==Early life and education==
Hallam was born in London, the son of the historian Henry Hallam. He attended school at Eton, where he met the future prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone. Hallam was an important influence on Gladstone, introducing him to Whiggish ideas and people. Other friends included James Milnes Gaskell.

After leaving Eton in 1827 Hallam travelled on the continent with his family, and in Italy, he became inspired by its culture and fell in love with an English beauty, Anna Mildred Wintour, who inspired eleven of his poems.

In October 1828, Hallam went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he met and befriended Tennyson. As Christopher Ricks observes, &#x27;The friendship of Hallam and Tennyson was swift and deep&#x27;.

==Friendship with Tennyson==
Hallam and Tennyson became friends in April 1829. They both entered the Chancellor&#x27;s Prize Poem Competition (which Tennyson won). Both joined the Cambridge Apostles (a private debating society), which met every Saturday night during term to discuss, over coffee and sardines on toast (&quot;whales&quot;), serious questions of religion, literature and society. (Hallam read a paper on &#x27;whether the poems of Shelley have an immoral tendency&#x27;; Tennyson was to speak on &#x27;Ghosts&#x27;, but was, according to his son&#x27;s &quot;Memoir&quot;, &#x27;too shy to deliver it&#x27; – only the Preface to the essay survives). Meetings of the Apostles were not always so intimidating: Desmond MacCarthy gave an account of Hallam and Tennyson at one meeting lying on the ground in order to laugh less painfully, when James Spedding imitated the sun going behind a cloud and coming out again.

During the Christmas holidays, Hallam visited Tennyson&#x27;s home in Somersby, Lincolnshire; on 20 December he met and fell in love with Tennyson&#x27;s eighteen-year-old sister, Emilia, who was just seven months younger than Hallam.

Hallam spent the 1830 Easter holidays with Tennyson in Somersby and declared his love for Emilia. Hallam and Tennyson planned to publish a book of poems together: Hallam told Mrs Tennyson that he saw this &quot;as a sort of seal of our friendship&quot;. Hallam&#x27;s father, however, objected, and Hallam&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; was privately published and printed in 1830. In the summer holidays, Tennyson and Hallam travelled to the Pyrenees (on a secret mission to take money and instructions written in invisible ink to General Torrijos who was planning a revolution against the tyranny of King Ferdinand VII of Spain). In December, Hallam again visited Somersby and became engaged to Emilia. His father forbade him to visit Somersby until he came of age at twenty-one.

In February 1831, Tennyson&#x27;s father died, with the result that Tennyson could no longer afford to continue at Cambridge. In August, Hallam wrote an enthusiastic article &#x27;On Some of the Characteristics of Modern Poetry, and on the Lyrical Poems of Alfred Tennyson&#x27; for the &quot;Englishman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He introduced Tennyson to the publisher Edward Moxon.

In February 1832, Hallam visited Emilia: &#x27;I love her madly,&#x27; he wrote. She was charmed by his &#x27;bright, angelic spirit and his gentle, chivalrous manner&#x27;. In July Tennyson and Hallam travelled to the Rhine. In October Hallam entered the office of a conveyancer, Mr Walters, of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. In December, thanks largely to Hallam&#x27;s support and practical help, Tennyson&#x27;s second volume of poetry was published. Hallam again spent Christmas at Somersby.

==Death==
In July 1833, Hallam visited Emilia. On 3 August, he left with his father for Europe. On 13 September, they went to Vienna, with Hallam complaining of fever and chill. It was apparently a recurrence of the &quot;ague&quot; he had suffered earlier that year, and, although it would delay their departure to Prague, there seemed to be little cause for alarm. Quinine and a few days rest were prescribed. By Sunday 15th, Hallam felt sufficiently better to take a short walk with his father in the evening. When he returned to the hotel he ordered some sack and lay down on the sofa, talking cheerfully all the time. Leaving his son reading in front of the fire, his father went out for a further stroll. He returned to find Hallam still on the sofa, apparently asleep apart from the position of his head. All efforts to rouse him were in vain. Arthur Hallam was dead at the age of twenty-two.

The medical report on the death certificate listed – that is, a stroke. A blood vessel near the brain had suddenly burst. The autopsy declared &quot;a weakness of the cerebral vessels, and a want of sufficient energy in the heart&quot;. The coffin was quickly sealed and sent to the nearest seaport, to be returned to England for burial.

In the first week of October, Tennyson received a letter from Arthur Hallam&#x27;s uncle, Henry Elton:
Tennyson broke the news to Emilia and caught her as she fainted. Gladstone received the news on 6 October: &quot;When shall I see his like?&quot; he wrote. &quot;I walked upon the hills to muse upon this very mournful event, which cuts me to the heart. Alas for his family and his intended bride!&quot;

To his friends, Hallam&#x27;s death came as &quot;a loud and terrible stroke from the reality of things upon the faery building of our youth&quot;. They remembered him in vivid elegy: he had been &quot;the most charming and the most promising&#x27; of his contemporaries; &quot;his mind was more original &amp; powerful than the minds of us his contemporaries&quot;; &quot;he had a genius for metaphysical analysis&quot;, &quot;a peculiar clearness of perception&quot;, and an &quot;always active mind&quot;; an &quot;angelic spirit&quot;, &quot;he seemed to tread the earth as a spirit from some better world*; &quot;his mighty spirit (beautiful and powerful as it had already grown), yet bore all the marks of youth, and growth, and ripening promise.&quot;

Tennyson said: &quot;He would have been known, if he had lived, as a great man but not as a great poet; he was as near perfection as mortal man could be.&quot;

Gladstone hoped &quot;that some part of what Hallam has written may be ... put into a more durable form ... his letters I think are worthy of permanent preservation&quot;. Hallam&#x27;s father collected together many of his son&#x27;s writings – excluding his letters and poems he thought unsuitable – and published them privately: &quot;Remains in Verse and Prose of Arthur Henry Hallam&quot; (1834). On being asked by Henry Hallam to contribute to an introduction, Tennyson replied: &quot;I attempted to draw a memoir of his life and character, but I failed to do him justice. I failed even to please myself. I could scarcely have pleased you.&quot;

Hallam is buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Clevedon, Somerset.

==&quot;In Memoriam&quot;==
That Hallam&#x27;s death was a significant influence on Tennyson&#x27;s poetry is clear. Tennyson dedicated one of his most popular poems to Hallam (&quot;In Memoriam&quot;), and stated that the dramatic monologue &quot;Ulysses&quot; was &quot;more written with the feeling of his [Hallam&#x27;s] loss upon me than many poems in [the publication] &quot;In Memoriam&quot;&quot;. Tennyson named his elder son after his late friend. Emilia Tennyson also named her elder son, Arthur Henry Hallam, in his honour. Francis Turner Palgrave dedicated to Tennyson his &quot;Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics&quot; (MacMillan 1861), declaring in the Preface that &#x27;It would have been hence a peculiar pleasure and pride to dedicate what I have endeavoured to make a true national Anthology of three centuries to Henry Hallam&#x27;. It can be argued that some of Tennyson&#x27;s other works are linked to Hallam, for example, &quot;Break, Break, Break&quot;, &quot;Mariana&quot;, and &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;.

<text>Emilia Tennyson (1811–1887), known simply as Emily within her family, was a younger sister of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and the fiancée of Arthur Henry Hallam, for whom Tennyson&#x27;s poem, &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot;, was written. Emilia met Hallam through her brother, and they became engaged in 1832.

==Loss and marriage==
However, the couple were never to marry, as Hallam died suddenly while travelling abroad in 1833. There was much concern for Emily&#x27;s well-being on the death of Arthur.

She later married Richard Jesse, then a midshipman in the British Royal Navy, who later rose at least to the rank of captain. Their marriage came as a considerable shock to Jane Elton, Arthur&#x27;s cousin. Jesse probably died two years after his wife, in 1889. Their eldest son was given the forenames Arthur Henry Hallam. Another son, the Reverend Eustace Tennyson D&#x27;Eyncourt Jesse, was the father of the writer F. Tennyson Jesse.

Emilia Tennyson appears as a character in the story &quot;Conjugial &quot;[sic]&quot; Angel&quot; by A. S. Byatt in the book &quot;Angels and Insects&quot;.

<text>Emily Sarah Tennyson, Baroness Tennyson ( Sellwood; 9 July 1813 – 10 August 1896), known as Emily, Lady Tennyson, was the wife of the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and an author and composer in her own right. Emily was the oldest of three daughters, raised by a single father, after her mother Sarah died when she was three years old. Her father, a successful lawyer, was devoted to her and her sisters and ensured that they had a good education. She met Alfred when she was a girl, but they did not develop a romantic relationship until his brother Charles married her sister Louisa. It was thirteen years before they would marry, due to her father&#x27;s concerns about the degree to which Tennyson could provide for her on a poet&#x27;s salary. When his career became more successful, Emily and Alfred married.

Emily played a number of significant roles in Alfred&#x27;s life. Aside from being a wife and mother of two sons, she ran large households and conducted business tasks for her husband. She performed the role of a business manager, secretary, promoter, entertainer, and protector. Her health suffered after the birth of her second child, and stress and overwork caused her health to weaken to the point that she became an invalid. She enjoyed music and wrote settings for some of Tennyson&#x27;s poetry, and wrote a couple of hymns. After her husband died in 1892, she worked with her son to write a biography of his life.

==Early life==
Emily Sarah Sellwood was born on 9 July 1813, most likely at Market Place, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, the eldest of three daughters born to Sarah (née Franklin, 1788–1816) and Henry Sellwood (1782–1867). 

Her father was a prosperous solicitor, secretary, and manager who acted for the Tennyson family many times over the years; her mother was a younger sister of Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin. Her mother died when Emily was three years of age, after which her devoted father provided a good education for the girls.

==Marriage==

Emily first met Alfred, Lord Tennyson when she was either nine or sixteen. Alfred fell in love with Emily at the marriage of his brother, Charles, to her sister, Louisa, in May 1836. He later wrote a sonnet about how he felt at the wedding of their siblings, where Emily was the bridesmaid:

In 1837, they were engaged. It was called off in 1840, because of financial issues and her father&#x27;s wariness of Tennyson&#x27;s ability to support a family on a poet&#x27;s income. Tennyson&#x27;s career was more successful in the 1840s and they were married on 13 June 1850. She was married at 37 years of age. That year, Alfred was very popular due to the success of &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot; (1850), and the attention was overwhelming for Alfred and Emily. 

First living in Twickenham in London, they established households in large houses with live-in servants, likely affordable due to a dowry from her father. To avoid the publicity, the Tennysons moved to Freshwater, Isle of Wight to Farringford House. Emily found the house to be the &quot;dearest place on earth&quot;, but they had so many visitors that it felt more like a hotel. Their guests often stayed for weeks, which provoked Alfred due to the commotion of servants and guests.

She was his secretary, business partner, proofreader, and financial manager. Philip Larkin described Emily as the woman behind the man — she managed his business, ran his household, took care of and educated his children, entertained visitors, and was protective of him—while he wrote poetry. Her correspondence provides insight into her managerial abilities and love for her husband. In modern times, her work for her husband would be considered that of a business woman.
They had two sons, Hallam, born at Twickenham on 11 August 1852, and Lionel, born at Farringford House on 16 March 1854. After the birth of her second son, she developed an incurable illness.

When Alfred was away, Julia Margaret Cameron visited Emily at Farringford. Julia thought of Emily as a &quot;living stream of love whose fount is never dry.&quot; She was described by Coventry Patmore as cultivated, charming &#x27;but her mind seems always deeper than her cultivation, and her heart always deeper than her mind, - or rather constituting the main element of her mind.&quot;

==Music and writing==
A musician, Emily employed her own talents in setting some of his poems to music. She wrote the hymns &quot;Great God, who knowest each man&#x27;s need&quot; and &quot;O yet we trust that somehow good&quot;. Emily and her son Hallam wrote a memoir of Tennyson.

==Later years and death==
Over time, the degree of responsibility was so stressful that it weakened her health. She longed for periods &quot;for reading and thinking, to restore the elasticity of one&#x27;s mind, now too like a bow spoilt by long bending&quot;. She became an invalid and was no longer able to entertain or perform managerial and secretarial duties, as she had in the past. This was in some ways a blessing to Alfred, with both of them going into retirement. She was able, though, to offer him comfort when he was upset.

Alfred died in 1892. He was buried at Westminster Abbey in Poets&#x27; Corner. Emily Tennyson died on 10 August 1896 at Aldworth. She is buried in All Saints&#x27; Church, Freshwater, Isle of Wight.

<text>The Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) is the military headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization&#x27;s (NATO) Allied Command Operations (ACO) that commands all NATO operations worldwide. SHAPE is situated in the village of Casteau, near Mons, Belgium.

ACO&#x27;s and SHAPE&#x27;s commander is titled Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), and is always a U.S. four-star general officer or flag officer who also serves as Commander, U.S. European Command.

From 1951 to 2003, SHAPE was the headquarters of Allied Command Europe (ACE). Since 2003 SHAPE has been the headquarters of ACO, controlling NATO also outside Europe. Even though the geographical scope of its activities was extended, SHAPE retained its traditional name with reference to Europe.

==History==
===Premises===
====1 January 1951 – 2 April 1951: Hôtel Astoria, Paris, France====

General Eisenhower arrived in Paris on January 1, 1951, and quickly set to work with a small group of planners to devise a structure for the new European command. The Planning Group worked in the Hotel Astoria in central Paris while construction of a permanent facility began.

====2 April 1951 – 31 March 1967: Rocquencourt, Yvelines, France====

On 2 April 1951 SHAPE moved to its permanent facility at Rocquencourt, just west of the city, at Camp Voluceau next to Versailles.

France&#x27;s resentment over NATO&#x27;s military structure had been brewing for a number of years, as successive French governments had become increasingly incensed with Anglo-American domination of the command structure and insufficient French influence. In February 1966 President Charles de Gaulle stated that the changed world order had &quot;stripped NATO of its justification&quot; for military integration, and soon afterward, France stated that it was withdrawing from the NATO military structure. SHAPE and all the other NATO installations, including NATO Headquarters and Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT), were informed that they must leave French territory by April 1967.

France&#x27;s withdrawal from NATO&#x27;s integrated military structure forced SHAPE and several other ACE headquarters to leave French territory.

====31 March 1967 – present: Casteau, Wallonia, Belgium====
With France no longer available, Belgium was chosen as a new host nation for both NATO&#x27;s political headquarters and SHAPE.

General Lyman Lemnitzer, SACEUR at the time, had hoped that SHAPE could be located near to NATO Headquarters, as had been the case in Paris, but the Belgian authorities decided that SHAPE should be located at least 50 kilometres from Brussels, NATO&#x27;s new location, because SHAPE was a major wartime military target. The Belgian government offered Camp Casteau, a 2 km2 Belgian Army summer training camp north of the city of Mons, southwest of Brussels, which was an area in serious need of additional economic investment. In September 1966, NATO agreed that Belgium should host SHAPE at Casteau. SHAPE closed its facility at Rocquencourt near Paris on 30 March 1967, and the next day held a ceremony to mark the opening of the new headquarters at Casteau.

===Changing role in NATO&#x27;s command structure===
====1951–2003: Headquarters of Allied Command Europe====
From 1951 to 2003, SHAPE was the headquarters of Allied Command Europe (ACE).

An integrated military structure for NATO was first established after the Korean War raised questions over the strength of Europe&#x27;s defences against a Soviet attack. The first choice for commander in Europe was American General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, as he had successfully directed the Allied landings in Normandy and subsequent march into Germany during World War II, amid many inter-Allied controversies over the proper conduct of the campaign on the Western Front. On December 19, 1950, the North Atlantic Council announced the appointment of General Eisenhower as the first SACEUR. British Field Marshal Sir Bernard L. Montgomery moved over from the predecessor Western Union Defence Organization (WUDO) to become the first Deputy SACEUR, who would serve until 1958. Volume 3 of Nigel Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Life of Montgomery of Alamein&quot; gives a good account of Montgomery&#x27;s exacting, tireless approach to improving the command&#x27;s readiness, which caused a good deal of bruised feelings in doing so. In establishing the command, the first NATO planners drew extensively on WUDO plans and personnel.

Devising command arrangements in the Central Region, which contained the bulk of NATO&#x27;s forces, proved to be much more complicated. General Eisenhower considered naming an overall Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) there as well but soon realized it would be difficult to find an arrangement that would satisfy all three major powers with forces in the Center—the United States, United Kingdom and France—as they had strongly differing views on the proper relationship of air and ground power. Drawing upon his World War II experience, General Eisenhower decided to retain overall control himself and did not appoint a C-in-C for the Central Region. Instead there would be three separate C-in-C&#x27;s (air, land, and sea).

In December 1950 it was announced that the forces initially to come under General Eisenhower&#x27;s command were to be the U.S. Seventh Army in Germany, the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), with the 2nd Infantry and 7th Armoured Divisions, to be bolstered by the 11th Armoured Division and a further infantry division, three French divisions in Germany and Austria, the Danish, Belgian, and the Independent Norwegian Brigades in Western Germany, and the American and British garrisons in Austria, Trieste, and Berlin. Four days after Eisenhower&#x27;s arrival in Paris, on 5 January 1951, the Italian defence minister, Randolfo Pacciardi, announced that three Italian divisions were to be formed as Italy&#x27;s &#x27;initial contribution to the Atlantic army&#x27;, and that these divisions would also come under Eisenhower&#x27;s control.

On April 2, 1951, General Eisenhower signed the activation order for Allied Command Europe and its headquarters at SHAPE. Headquarters, Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT) was activated in Fontainebleau, France in 1953. On the same day, ACE&#x27;s subordinate headquarters in Northern and Central Europe were activated, with the Southern Region following in June.

By 1954 ACE&#x27;s forces consisted of Allied Forces Northern Europe, at Oslo, Allied Forces Central Europe (Fontainebleau), Allied Forces Southern Europe (Paris/Naples) and Allied Forces Mediterranean at Malta.

The commanders and commands in 1957 were:
*Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) – General Lauris Norstad, United States Air Force
**Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR) – Field Marshal The Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, British Army
***Chief of Staff (COFS) – General Courtlandt Van Rensselaer Schuyler, United States Army
**Allied Forces Northern Europe (AFNORTH) – Lieutenant General Sir Cecil Sugden, British Army
**Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT) – Général d&#x27;Armée Jean-Étienne Valluy, French Army
***Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE) – Air Chief Marshal Sir George Mills, Royal Air Force
***Northern Army Group (NORTHAG) – General Sir Richard Gale, British Army
***Central Army Group (CENTAG) – General Henry I. Hodes, United States Army
**Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) – Admiral R.P.M. Bristol, United States Navy
***Naval Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe (STRIKFORSOUTH) – Vice Admiral Charles R. Brown, United States Navy
**Allied Forces Mediterranean (AFMED) – Admiral Sir Ralph Edwards, Royal Navy

Four exercises were conducted in the ACE area during the autumn 1952. &quot;Blue Alliance&quot; was a major allied air force exercise for the Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE) to achieve air supremacy over the Central European front and provide close air support to NORTHAG ground forces under the overall command of Lt. General Lauris Norstad, USAF. Two 1952 central region exercises involved air-ground combined forces. &quot;Equinox&quot; was a major air-ground exercise involving French-American tactical air units and a French airborne infantry unit under the command of &quot;Général d&#x27;Armée&quot; Alphonse Juin, French Army. &quot;Holdfast&quot; was a major allied air-ground exercise involving 150,000 British Army of the Rhine, Dutch, Belgian, and Canadian troops of NATO&#x27;s Northern Army Group in coordination with the Allied Air Forces Central Europe. They maneuvered east of the Rhine River in the British Zone under the overall command of Lt. General Sir Richard Nelson Gale, British Army. Finally, &quot;Rosebud&quot; involved ground maneuvers by the U.S. Seventh Army in the American Zone of Occupation of Allied-occupied Germany.

The initial plans saw the defence of Western Europe from a Soviet invasion resting heavily on nuclear weapons (&#x27;Massive retaliation&#x27;), with conventional forces merely acting as a &#x27;tripwire.&#x27; The policy enunciated in Military Committee document MC14/1, issued in December 1952, saw the defence of Germany as principally a delaying action, to allow a line of resistance to be established along the lines of the IJssel and Rhine rivers. The conventional forces would attempt to hold this line while the allied strategic air forces defeated the Soviets and their allies by destroying their economy and infrastructure.

What this strategy meant for the land battle in the central region was described for publicity purposes in January 1954 by then-Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Alfred Gruenther as:

In 1957, SACEUR General Lauris Norstad, USAF, noting the numerical superiority of Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces over NATO ground forces, called for &quot;about 30&quot; divisions to augment NATO&#x27;s central European front. That year Allied Command Europe carried out Operation Counter Punch, which involved AFCENT forces on the European mainland, and two other major military exercises in September 1957. Operation Strikeback was a series of multilateral naval exercises that concentrated on NATO&#x27;s eastern Atlantic/northern European flank. Operation Deep Water involved NATO carrier and amphibious assault forces operating along NATO&#x27;s southern flank in the Mediterranean Sea.

To improve alliance military readiness and integration, NATO continued to hold annual alliance-wide military exercises each autumn (&quot;FALLEX&quot;) that was jointly planned and executed by SACEUR and SACLANT forces.

From 1967 however, under &#x27;flexible response&#x27;, the aim became to build up conventional forces so that, if possible, nuclear weapons might not be needed. However it was made clear that first use of nuclear weapons might be necessary if the conventional defences were being overwhelmed. Eventually SACEUR was allocated planning control of a small number of US and British ballistic missile submarines, and some 7,000 tactical nuclear weapons were deployed in Europe.

The drawdown of the British Mediterranean Fleet, the military difficulties of the politically decided command structure, and the withdrawal of the French from the military command structure forced a rearrangement of the command arrangements in the southern region. Allied Forces Mediterranean was disbanded on 5 June 1967, and all forces in the south and the Mediterranean assigned to AFSOUTH in Naples. This left SHAPE and Allied Command Europe with three commands: AFNORTH covering Norway and Denmark, AFCENT most of Germany, and AFSOUTH Italy, Turkey, Greece, and the rest of the southern region.

=====1970s – Haig and Rogers=====
The headquarters&#x27; new home in Mons, Belgium, was the center of international attention from time to time as new Supreme Allied Commanders came and went, with one of the more notable being General Alexander Haig. Haig, who had retired from military service in order to serve as White House Chief of Staff for President Richard Nixon during the depths of the Watergate crisis, was abruptly installed as SACEUR after Watergate&#x27;s denouement. Haig arrived in 1974. Some scattered notes about his time at SHAPE are recorded by Colodny and Shachtman&#x27;s book &quot;The Forty Years War&quot;. In addition, then-Lieutenant Colonel John Galvin (later to become SACEUR himself) served as speechwriter for both Goodpaster, Haig&#x27;s predecessor, and Haig. Galvin wrote that &#x27;Goodpaster was ... internationally minded, avuncular, philosophical, gentlemanly, thoughtful, warm, and measured in his ways. Haig was combative and suspicious, and conspiratorial in outlook.&#x27; While at SACEUR Haig felt that the large Warsaw Pact exercises were intimidating to observers, and, despite HQ staff disapproval, created the Exercise Autumn Forge exercise series, increasing the size of the event by holding all the NATO ACE exercises at the same time of year.

A creature of habit, Haig took the same route to SHAPE every day – a pattern of behavior that did not go unnoticed by terrorist groups. On June 25, 1979, Haig was the apparent target of an assassination attempt in Mons, Belgium. A land mine blew up under the bridge on which Haig&#x27;s car was traveling, narrowly missing Haig&#x27;s car, but wounding three of his bodyguards in a following car. Authorities later attributed responsibility for the attack to the German Red Army Faction.

Haig&#x27;s successor, General Bernard W. Rogers, became somewhat of an institution in Europe as the former U.S. Army chief of staff occupied the office for nearly eight years; a brief outcry arose from the other NATO capitals when Rogers was slated for retirement by the U.S. administration in 1987. Rogers was replaced by General John R. Galvin after Galvin was being advised he was being picked by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger in February–March 1987.

=====1980s–1990s=====
ACE in 1986 had three major subordinate commands (MSCs), one each for Northern, Central, and Southern Europe, as well as smaller commands.

*Allied Forces Northern Europe, Kolsås, Norway
**Allied Forces North Norway, Bodø, Norway
**Allied Forces South Norway, Stavanger, Norway
**Allied Forces Baltic Approaches, Karup, Denmark
***Allied Land Forces, Schleswig-Holstein and Jutland, Rendsburg, Germany
***Allied Land Forces, Zealand, Ringsted, Denmark
***Allied Air Forces, Baltic Approaches, Karup, Denmark
***Allied Naval Forces, Baltic Approaches, Karup, Denmark
*ACE Mobile Force, Seckenheim, Germany
*United Kingdom Air Forces, RAF High Wycombe, UK
*NATO Airborne Early Warning Force, HQ Maisieres, Belgium

*Allied Forces Central Europe, Brunssum, Netherlands
**Northern Army Group (NORTHAG), JHQ Rheindahlen
**Central Army Group (CENTAG), Campbell Barracks Heidelberg 
**Allied Air Forces Central Europe Ramstein Air Base
***Second Allied Tactical Air Force, RAF Rheindahlen
***Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force, Heidelberg

*Allied Forces Southern Europe, Naples, Italy
**Allied Land Forces Southern Europe, Verona, Italy
**Allied Land Forces South-Eastern Europe, Izmir, Turkey
**Allied Air Forces Southern Europe, Naples, Italy
**Naval Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe, Naples
**Allied Naval Forces Southern Europe, Naples, Italy
***Maritime Air Forces Mediterranean
***Submarine Force Mediterranean
***Naval On-Call Force Mediterranean
***Commander Western Mediterranean
***Commander Central Mediterranean
***Commander Eastern Mediterranean
***Commander Northeastern Mediterranean


From 1993, the staffing of ACE was reduced in line with personnel reductions already in progress since 1990 and the Schaefer Plan, drafted by retired German general Shaefer. Shaefer&#x27;s aim was to begin the first effort to streamline NATO&#x27;s Cold War structure to meet the new circumstances. Personnel in the headquarters fell from 18,354 in 1990 to 12,919 in 1996. Costs fell from US$621m to $482m over the same period. From 1994-c.1999, there were three Major Subordinate Commands in ACE: Allied Forces Northwestern Europe at RAF High Wycombe, Allied Forces Central Europe at Brunssum, The Netherlands, and AFSOUTH in Naples.

After much discussion within the Alliance, ACE&#x27;s three-command system was reduced to two commands covering the same area after 1996, one for north of the Alps and one for south of the Alps. The United States had wished to retain three commands, arguing that &#x27;the span of control might be excessive.&#x27; It was feared by Pentagon officials at the time that if the two-command structure was adopted, some functions at the MSC level would have had to be moved &#x27;downward&#x27; in the new structure. But while the United States eventually had to give in on a reduction to two commands, it was successful in that a European officer was not placed in charge of the new southern command (now Allied Joint Force Command Naples), a move which France and Germany supported. Despite French President Jacques Chirac exchanging letters with Bill Clinton personally over the issue in September–October 1997, the United States stood firm and today an American admiral remains in charge of the Naples command. In addition to the two continental commands AFNORTHWEST covered the United Kingdom and Scandinavia.

An early retirement again disrupted the Mons headquarters in 2000 as General Wesley Clark was shunted aside in favor of Air Force general Joseph Ralston. Although the move was publicly characterized as a purely administrative move necessitated by Clark&#x27;s approaching retirement and the lack of an open four-star slot for the highly respected Ralston [a reality which would have compelled him to either accept a temporary demotion to two-star rank or retire from the service], Clark&#x27;s relief has been often seen as a slap at the general on the part of a Pentagon leadership that had been very much at odds with him during the Kosovo war the previous spring.

From the early 2000s ACO as it became had more and more activities related to the NATO Response Force. Yet after Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the alliance, and especially after the 2008 Georgia-Russia war, more attention began to be paid to NATO&#x27;s core Article 5 defence obligations. The three Baltic states&#x27; worries were specifically focused on a potential Russian threat. Thus while some exercises were ostentially run to prepare the NRF, sometimes they also included Article 5 aspects. Among these dual-purpose exercises was &#x27;Steadfast Jazz&#x27;, part of the NATO Exercise Steadfast series, which was run in November 2013 across a number of NATO countries, including Poland and the Baltic states.

====2003–present: Headquarters of Allied Command Operations====
Since 2003 it has been the headquarters of Allied Command Operations, controlling all NATO operations worldwide. SHAPE retained its traditional name with reference to Europe for legal reasons although the geographical scope of its activities was extended in 2003. At that time, NATO&#x27;s command in Lisbon, historically part of Allied Command Atlantic, was reassigned to ACO.
In 2003, a French flag was set up in the SHAPE headquarters in Mons following the return, after almost forty years, of French military officers to the HQ. Fifteen French military officers, including General Jean-Jacques Bart, work there, of a total number of 1,100 personnel. They are however considered as &quot;inserted,&quot; and not as &quot;integrated,&quot; as they cannot be ordered to move without previous French approval.

A new structure was developed with three main headquarters under Allied Command Operations:
*Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum, Netherlands
**Component Command – Air, Ramstein
**Component Command – Maritime, Northwood
**Command Component – Land, Heidelberg
*Allied Joint Force Command Lisbon, Portugal
*Allied Joint Force Command Naples, Italy
**Component Command – Air, Izmir
**Component Command – Maritime, Naples
**Component Command – Land, Madrid
NATO Rapid Deployable Corps headquarters (NRDC)

Between 2003 and 2006, a new category of forces was created, principally to improve the flexibility and reach of land forces. The structure incorporated six &quot;NATO Rapid Deployable Corps headquarters&quot;. Formed from October 2003, the NATO Rapidly Deployable Corps are designated High Readiness Forces (HRF), designed to be able to react on short notice. Although these forces cannot deploy on five days warning like the NATO Response Force (NRF), they have a longer sustainment capability in combat than the NRF, which is limited to 30 days.
*Allied Rapid Reaction Corps based at Imjin Barracks, Innsworth, Gloucester, England which is rapidly deployable within five days, but lacks sustained capability, limited to 30 days in combat. It would serve as an advance force for follow on NATO forces.
*I. German/Dutch Corps based in Münster, Germany
*NATO Rapid Deployable Italian Corps, Ugo Mara Barracks HQ in Solbiate Olona near Milan, Italy
*3rd Corps/NATO Rapid Deployable Corps – Türkiye (NRDC-T), HQ near Istanbul, Turkey
*NATO Rapid Deployable Spanish Corps in Valencia, Spain
*NATO Rapid Deployable Corps – Greece based on the &quot;C&quot; Corps HQ in Thessaloniki, Greece (now redesignated as a Force of Lower Readiness (FLR))

The Multinational Corps Northeast headquartered in Szczecin, Poland, was seen along with the downgraded Greek corps, as the third echelon deployable force in the NATO rapid deployment capability. The Eurocorps HQ, in Strasbourg, France, is an EU force with a technical agreement linking it to NATO.

, there are nine High Readiness Force Headquarters:
*1 German-Netherlands Corps, Münster, Germany
*Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), Innsworth
*Multinational Corps Northeast (MNC-NE), Szczecin
*NATO Rapid Deployable Corps Italy (NRDC-IT), Solbiate Olona
*NATO Rapid Deployable Corps Spain (NRDC-Spain), Valencia
*NATO Rapid Deployable Corps Türkiye (NRDC-T), Istanbul
*NATO Deployable Corps Greece (NRDC-GR) Thessaloniki
*Rapid Reaction Corps France (RRC-FR), Lille

Certification of the following High Readiness Forces (Maritime) Headquarters took place in 2004:
*Headquarters Commander Italian Maritime Forces on board Italy&#x27;s INS &quot;Garibaldi&quot;;
*Headquarters Commander Spanish Maritime Forces (HQ COMSPMARFOR) on board SPS &quot;Castilla&quot;;
*Headquarters Commander United Kingdom Maritime Forces (HQ COMUKMARFOR)

Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO (STRIKFORNATO), homeported at Gaeta, Italy, whose lead nation is the United States, is commanded by Commander United States Sixth Fleet, and is also part of the NATO Force Structure. STRIKFORNATO is the only command capable of leading an expanded maritime task force.

The final formation is Commander French Maritime Forces, initially aboard the &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, but now aboard the amphibious ship &quot;Mistral&quot;. The French naval component is drawn from the Force d&#x27;Action Navale, the French Navy&#x27;s surface fleet.

Island Commander, Iceland, remains in existence as a detachment of HQ ACO, as does Allied Submarine Command, a NATO command based on the United States Navy&#x27;s ComSubLant. A special operations coordination centre and an intelligence fusion centre have also recently been formed within SHAPE.

As more capable rapid reaction forces were established, earlier &#x27;fire brigades&#x27;, including the ACE Mobile Force (Land) (&#x27;AMF (L)&#x27;), were disbanded; AMF(L) was disbanded on 30 October 2002.

In addition to this Allied Command Operations has at its disposal standing forces such as:
*NATO Airborne Early Warning Force (NAEWF)
*Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 (SNMG1)
*Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 (SNMG2)
*Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 1 (SNMCMG1)
*Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 2 (SNMCMG2)

Airlift support for SACEUR&#x27;s travels is provided by the USAF&#x27;s 309th Airlift Squadron at Chièvres Air Base, Belgium.

In 2012 and 2013, NATO underwent a reorganization of the military command, and the land component commands at Heidelberg and Madrid were deactivated, the maritime component command at Naples was closed and the air component command at Izmir also shut down.

== Present role ==

Since 1951, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe has served as the head of the topmost-level NATO command for Europe, now titled Allied Command Operations, and located at Casteau. The Deputy Commander is always a European officer.

There were initially two joint force operational headquarters and several single service commands under SHAPE, in its role as headquarters of Allied Command Operations:
* Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum (JFC BS), Netherlands
* Allied Joint Force Command Naples (JFC NP), Italy

In 2018, it was agreed that a new joint force operational headquarters in Norfolk would be created to conduct operations in the Atlantic. 
Joint Force Command Norfolk (JFC NF) was established due to the rising Russian threat, making the Atlantic sea routes more critical. A Joint Support and Enabling Command (JSEC) was also created in Ulm, Germany, to improve rear area logistical support.

There are three single-service commands:
* Allied Air Command (AIRCOM) at Ramstein, Germany
* Allied Land Command (LANDCOM) at Izmir, Turkey
* Allied Maritime Command (MARCOM) at Northwood Headquarters, London, United Kingdom

Other commands include:
* Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO (aka. Strike Force NATO, STRIKFORNATO) at Oeiras, Portugal
* Joint Support and Enabling Command, Ulm (announced 2018, operational September 2019)
* NATO Communications and Information Systems Services Agency (NCISG) at Mons, Belgium

==Role in European Union missions==

Under the 2002 Berlin Plus agreement, SHAPE may also take part in the European Union&#x27;s (EU) command and control structure as an operational headquarters (OHQ) for EU missions. In such an instance, the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR), who is always a European, would serve as Operation Commander (OpCdr). This use of SHAPE by the EU is however subject to a &quot;right of first refusal&quot;, i.e. NATO must first decline to intervene in a given crisis.

The European Union Military Staff maintains a &#x27;cell&#x27; at SHAPE.

== In popular culture ==
Ian Fleming referenced SHAPE in his short-story &#x27;From a View to a Kill&#x27;, collected as part of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;.

In the film &quot;Private Benjamin&quot;, Goldie Hawn&#x27;s character negotiates an assignment to SHAPE.

==Symbols==
===Coat of arms===
A 1953 brochure on the arms reads:
====Achievement====
The full achievement is composed of the arms as well as member states&#x27; flags, serving as supporters. The number of supporters has risen steadily, reflecting NATO enlargement. An exception happened in 1966, with the withdrawal of France from NATO&#x27;s integrated command structure.
