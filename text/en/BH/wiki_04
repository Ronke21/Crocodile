<text>A silversmith is a metalworker who crafts objects from silver. The terms &quot;silversmith&quot; and &quot;goldsmith&quot; are not exact synonyms, as the techniques, training, history, and guilds are (or were, at least) largely the same but differed in that the end product may vary greatly (as may the scale of objects created).

==History==

In the ancient Near East (as holds true today), the value of silver was lower than the value of gold, allowing a silversmith to produce objects and store them as stock. Historian Jack Ogden states that, according to an edict written by Diocletian in 301 A.D., a silversmith was able to charge 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, or 300 &quot;denarii&quot; per Roman pound for material produce. At that time, guilds of silversmiths formed to arbitrate disputes, protect its members&#x27; welfare, and educate the public of the trade.

Silversmiths in medieval Europe and England formed guilds and transmitted their tools and techniques to new generations via the apprentice tradition. Silverworking guilds often maintained consistency and upheld standards at the expense of innovation. Beginning in the 17th century, artisans emigrated to America and experienced fewer restrictions. As a result, silverworking was one of the trades that helped to inaugurate the technological and industrial history of the United States silverworking shift to industrialization.

Very exquisite and distinctly designed silverware, especially the artisanal craft that goes by the name of Swami silver, emerged from the stable of watchmaker-turned-silversmith P.Orr and Sons in the South Indian city of Madras (now Chennai) during the British rule in 1875.

Silversmiths saw or cut specific shapes from sterling and fine silver sheet metal and bar stock; they then use hammers to form the metal over anvils and stakes. Silver is hammered cold (at room temperature). As the metal is hammered, bent, and worked, it &#x27;work-hardens&#x27;. Annealing is the heat-treatment used to make the metal soft again. If metal is work-hardened, and not annealed occasionally, the metal will crack and weaken the work.

Silversmiths can use casting techniques to create knobs, handles and feet for the hollowware they are making.

After forming and casting, the various pieces may be assembled by soldering and riveting.

During most of their history, silversmiths used charcoal or coke fired forges, and lung-powered blow-pipes for soldering and annealing. Modern silversmiths commonly use gas burning torches as heat sources. A newer method is laser beam welding.

Silversmiths may also work with copper and brass, especially when making practice pieces, due to those materials having similar working properties and being more affordable than silver.

<text>A goldsmith is a metalworker who specializes in working with gold and other precious metals. Modern goldsmiths mainly specialize in jewelry-making but historically, they have also made silverware, platters, goblets, decorative and serviceable utensils, and ceremonial or religious items.

Goldsmiths must be skilled in forming metal through filing, soldering, sawing, forging, casting, and polishing. The trade has very often included jewelry-making skills, as well as the very similar skills of the silversmith. Traditionally, these skills had been passed along through apprenticeships; more recently jewelry arts schools, specializing in teaching goldsmithing and a multitude of skills falling under the jewelry arts umbrella, are available. Many universities and junior colleges also offer goldsmithing, silversmithing, and metal arts fabrication as a part of their fine arts curriculum.

== Gold ==
Compared to other metals, gold is malleable, ductile, rare, and it is the only solid metallic element with a yellow color. It may easily be melted, fused, and cast without the problems of oxides and gas that are problematic with other metals such as bronzes, for example. It is fairly easy to &quot;pressure weld&quot;, wherein, similarly to clay, two small pieces may be pounded together to make one larger piece. Gold is classified as a noble metal—because it does not react with most elements. It usually is found in its native form, lasting indefinitely without oxidization and tarnishing.

== History ==

Gold has been worked by humans in all cultures where the metal is available, either indigenously or imported, and the history of these activities is extensive. Superbly made objects from the ancient cultures of Africa, Asia, Europe, India, North America, Mesoamerica, and South America grace museums and collections throughout the world. The Copper Age Varna culture (Bulgaria) from the 5th millennium BC is credited with the earliest found instances of gold metallurgy. The associated Varna Necropolis treasure contains the oldest golden jewellery in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years.

Some pieces date back thousands of years and were made using many techniques that still are used by modern goldsmiths. Techniques developed by some of those goldsmiths achieved a skill level that was lost and remained beyond the skills of those who followed, even to modern times. Researchers attempting to uncover the chemical techniques used by ancient artisans have remarked that their findings confirm that &quot;the high level of competence reached by the artists and craftsmen of these ancient periods who produced objects of an artistic quality that could not be bettered in ancient times and has not yet been reached in modern ones.&quot;

In medieval Europe goldsmiths were organized into guilds and usually were one of the most important and wealthiest of the guilds in a city. The guild kept records of members and the marks they used on their products. These records, when they survive, are very useful to historians. Goldsmiths often acted as bankers, since they dealt in gold and had sufficient security for the safe storage of valuable items, though they were usually restrained from lending at interest, which was regarded as usury. In the Middle Ages, goldsmithing normally included silversmithing as well, but the brass workers and workers in other base metals normally were members of a separate guild, since the trades were not allowed to overlap. Many jewelers also were goldsmiths.
The Sunar caste is one of the oldest communities in goldsmithing in India, whose superb gold artworks were displayed at The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. In India, &#x27;Daivadnya Brahmins&#x27;, Vishwakarma (Viswabrahmins, Acharis) &#x27;Sunar&#x27; are the goldsmith castes.

The printmaking technique of engraving developed among goldsmiths in Germany around 1430, who had long used the technique on their metal pieces. The notable engravers of the fifteenth century were either goldsmiths, such as Master E. S., or the sons of goldsmiths, such as Martin Schongauer and Albrecht Dürer.

== Contemporary goldsmithing ==

A goldsmith might have a wide array of skills and knowledge at their disposal. Gold, being the most malleable metal of all, offers unique opportunities for the worker. In today&#x27;s world a wide variety of other metals, especially platinum alloys, also may be used frequently. 24 karat is pure gold and historically, was known as fine gold.

Because it is so soft, however, 24 karat gold is rarely used. It is usually alloyed to make it stronger and to create different colors. Depending on the metals used to create the alloy, the color can change.

The goldsmith will use a variety of tools and machinery, including the rolling mill, the drawplate, and perhaps, swage blocks and other forming tools to make the metal into shapes needed to build the intended piece. Then parts are fabricated through a wide variety of processes and assembled by soldering. It is a testament to the history and evolution of the trade that those skills have reached an extremely high level of attainment and skill over time. A fine goldsmith can and will work to a tolerance approaching that of precision machinery, but largely using only his eyes and hand tools. Quite often the goldsmith&#x27;s job involves the making of mountings for gemstones, in which case they often are referred to as &quot;jewelers&quot;.

&#x27;Jeweller&#x27;, however, is a term mostly reserved for a person who deals in jewellery (buys and sells) and not to be confused with a goldsmith, silversmith, gemologist, diamond cutter, and diamond setters. A &#x27;jobbing jeweller&#x27; is the term for a jeweller who undertakes a small basic amount of jewellery repair and alteration.

== Modern goldsmithing techniques ==
Advancements in technology have significantly shaped the field of goldsmithing, bringing in tools and methods that enhance both efficiency and creativity. While traditional methods like handcrafting remain vital, modern techniques are widely employed in crafting a wide array of gold jewelry, including necklaces, rings, and other adornments. Some of the key modern techniques include:

=== Computer-aided design (CAD) ===
Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays an essential role in the design phase of modern goldsmithing. CAD software enables jewelers to create intricate 3D models with precise detailing. It offers flexibility for customization and reduces material waste during the production process, making it a crucial tool for both bespoke and mass-produced jewelry.

=== 3D printing and lost-wax casting ===
The advent of 3D printing has complemented traditional methods such as lost-wax casting. 3D printers use castable resins to create molds that allow for highly detailed designs. This technology is particularly valuable for producing complex pieces such as filigree necklaces or detailed settings that are difficult to achieve manually.

=== Laser cutting and engraving ===
Laser cutting and laser engraving technologies are essential for adding intricate details and personalizing jewelry. These processes ensure precision, reduce the risk of human error, and provide a high level of detail in the final product. They are widely used for creating patterns, text, and other fine details on various gold objects.

=== Electroforming ===
Electroforming allows for the creation of lightweight yet structurally sound gold pieces. In this process, metal is deposited onto a wax or resin model submerged in an electrolytic bath, enabling the production of large, hollow designs that would otherwise be heavy and expensive to make solid.

<text>Wardair Canada was a privately run Canadian airline, founded by Max Ward in 1952 under the name Wardair Ltd, before formally changing its name to &quot;Wardair Canada&quot; in 1976. The airline was acquired by and merged into Canadian Airlines in 1989.

==History==
In 1946, Maxwell W. Ward founded the Polaris Charter Company in Yellowknife, NWT. In 1952 the airline was formed as Wardair and operations began on 6 June 1953 using a single engine de Havilland Canada Otter. In 1962, it entered the trans-atlantic charter market and changed its name to Wardair Canada Ltd. On January 1, 1976, the name was changed to Wardair Canada (1975) Ltd and yet again on June 10, 1977, to Wardair International Ltd.

Wardair provided domestic service in Quebec, Manitoba, Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta, as well as international service to Europe, the United States, and several Caribbean and South American countries. On March 31, 1989, the Canadian Transportation Agency approved the sale of Wardair to Canadian Airlines International.

Wardair had its roots in the air charter business in the Yukon and the Northwest Territories. From a modest start as Polaris Charter Company in the mid 1940s operating small bi-planes such as the De Havilland DH.83 Fox Moth. With service as a passenger and cargo charter company, the airline expanded into the more populous regions of Canada. And from 1962 onward, was transformed into a holiday charter airline.

Wardair was not a discount airline but an airline providing good service at lower-than-average prices. They were known for high quality meals and friendly staff. &quot;Steak &amp; Champagne&quot; flights was a popular advertising tag line in the 1980s, and won various awards from magazines for their service (Holiday Which? magazine charter airline of the year 1985, and scheduled carrier of the years 1986 and 1987). Flight attendants served food on Wardair-branded Royal Doulton china on tray-table tablecloths on the passenger tray. The seats featured generous pitch.

The operations from the early 1950s were small bush-type runs based in Edmonton, Alberta, and Yellowknife, NWT. Wardair&#x27;s first large aircraft was a four engine Douglas DC-6B propliner, leased in summer 1962, which started the airline&#x27;s emphasis on charter flights — to Europe in summer and to Mexico, California, etc. in winter. In 1966, the airline began operating its first jet, a Boeing 727-100 — Canada&#x27;s first Boeing 727 — used to operate flights to and from Europe with a refuelling stop en route. The Boeing trijet was followed by the first intercontinental Boeing 707 (thus allowing non-stop flights to Europe) in 1968, and the first Boeing 747 jumbo jet in 1973. Although initially centred on Edmonton, many long-haul flights were relocated to concentrate on Vancouver and Toronto as primary destinations, while Edmonton would continue to connect other major Canadian cities. Nonetheless, Edmonton continued to operate as a major transatlantic hub for Wardair, with flights to Prestwick, London Gatwick, Amsterdam Schiphol, and Frankfurt. Honolulu, Hawaii, became a significant winter destination, with London Gatwick becoming a major summertime destination with direct flights from Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa, and Toronto.

In 1970, the mainline fleet consisted of two 707s and one 727. By 1980, the fleet had grown to include four Boeing 747s and two intercontinental McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 wide body jetliners. Wardair was a small but steadily growing company. In 1987, building on a fleet of seven jets, Wardair undertook a major expansion, ordering 38 jet aircraft including 14 Airbus A310s, 12 McDonnell Douglas MD-88s, and 12 Fokker 100s which represented an exponential expansion of operations that would ultimately prove to be financially unsustainable. The MD-80 and 100 jetliners were never delivered or operated by the airline.

Only the first 12 Airbus A310s had been delivered — the remaining A310s as well as all of the MD-88 and 100 deliveries were cancelled after the takeover.

The airline added scheduled passenger service to its charter service flights in 1986. Rapid expansion, problems with their computer booking system, and failure to attract business customers, who had developed customer loyalty to frequent flier programs on competing airlines, led the airline into financial difficulties, ultimately resulting in Wardair Canada being sold to Canadian Airlines (which operated as Canadian Airlines International) in 1989.

<text>Righteous Babe Records is an American independent record label that was created by folk singer Ani DiFranco in 1990 to release her own songs in lieu of being beholden to a mainstream record company.

==History==
Righteous Babe Records was originally called Righteous Records; however, DiFranco then discovered a gospel music label already had that name, and to differentiate her company, added the &quot;Babe&quot;.

Located in DiFranco&#x27;s hometown of Buffalo, New York, the business grew organically, starting in 1990 with her first cassette tape. DiFranco sold the tapes out of the back of her car and at shows on tour, then sold them on consignment in local stores. Teaming up with her longtime business partner Scot Fisher, they were able to self-distribute her albums directly to over 100 indie accounts. DiFranco cites her anti-corporate ethos for the DIY ethics at Righteous Babe and not wanting to buy into the major label system.

Having a large women’s music following she was able to make connections at Zango and Goldenrod, two music distributors specializing in women’s music who started selling her albums to women’s book stores and other small music shops. After the independent success of her sixth album &quot;Out of Range&quot;, Righteous Babe Records signed a distribution deal with independent distributor Koch International (later eOne) for DiFranco’s highly anticipated &quot;Not a Pretty Girl&quot; release in 1995. Her records could then be found in large and small record stores alike and the Righteous Babe staff quickly grew to fourteen people.

DiFranco and Fisher stress the importance of community to their business such as working with local printers whenever possible, hiring friends and like minded people.

Righteous Babe expanded in the late 1990s to release albums for non-mainstream artists and in 2001 Righteous Babe opened a European office called Righteous Babe LTD.

Alternative Press described the label&#x27;s focus as &quot;the freedom of being able to create for oneself&quot; and the roster as &quot;a lineup of artists who are uniquely themselves.&quot;

==Babeville==
In 1995, an abandoned 19th century historical landmark, the Asbury Delaware United Methodist Church was scheduled to be demolished by the City of Buffalo. The church had been built in 1876 but became derelict with no upkeep. In 1999, Righteous Babe Records offered to buy the building from the city. Restoration efforts began in 2000, and by 2006 it had been converted into an entertainment venue. Originally referred to as &quot;The Church&quot;, the name was affectionately changed to &quot;Babeville.&quot; It has a 1,200-seat concert hall and is the home of the label.

<text>Daniel Marot or Daniel Marot the Elder (1661–1752) was a French-born Dutch architect, furniture designer and engraver at the forefront of the classicizing Late Baroque Louis XIV style. He worked for a long time in England and the Dutch Republic, where he was naturalised in 1709.

==Life==
Born in Paris, he was a pupil of Jean Le Pautre and the son of Jean Marot, who was also an architect and engraver. Marot was working independently as an engraver from an early age, making engravings of designs by Jean Bérain, one of Louis XIV&#x27;s official designers at the Manufacture des Gobelins, where far more than tapestry was being produced. The family were Huguenots and were part of the wave of émigrés who left France in the year of the Edict of Fontainebleau and Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) to settle in Holland. Daniel Marot brought the fully developed court style of Louis XIV to Holland, and later to London. In the end, the English style which is loosely called &quot;William and Mary&quot; owed much to his manner.

In the Dutch Republic, Marot was employed by the Stadthouder, who later became William III of England; in particular, he is associated with designing interiors in the palace of Het Loo, from 1684 on. Though his name cannot be attached to any English building (and he does not have an entry in Howard Colvin&#x27;s exhaustive &quot;Dictionary of British Architects&quot;) we know from his own engraving that he designed the great hall of audience for the States-General at the Hague. He also decorated many Dutch country-houses, introducing the “salon” and popularizing ornamented ceilings in The United Provinces/ Netherlands. 

In 1694, he traveled with William to London, where he was appointed one of his architects and Master of Works. In England his activities appear to have been concentrated at Hampton Court Palace, where he designed the garden parterres, which were swept away in the following generation and have been restored at the end of the 20th century. His designs for the Great Fountain Garden survive. Much of the furniture, especially the mirrors, guéridons and state beds, in the new State Rooms readied for William at Hampton Court bears unmistakable traces of his authorship; the tall and monumental embroidered state beds, with their plumes of ostrich feathers, their elaborate valances and cantonnieres agree very closely with his later published designs (&quot;illustration, right&quot;). 

After William&#x27;s death Marot returned to Holland where he lived at the Noordeinde 164 in The Hague from 1720 until his death in 1752. The house with his salon, kitchen, hallway and possibly some of his ceilings still exists.

We owe much of our knowledge of his work to the folio volume of his furniture designs published at Amsterdam in 1712. Not surprisingly the designs show strong French and Dutch influences; what reads as their &quot;English&quot; look is more probably the result of Marot&#x27;s court style on other London designers.

Marot was a nephew of Pierre Gole as he was the son of Gole&#x27;s sister-in-law. He married Gole&#x27;s niece.

==Engravings==
In his engraved designs, Marot&#x27;s range was extraordinarily wide. He designed practically every detail in the internal ornamentation of the house: carved chimneypieces, plaster ceilings, panels for walls, girandoles and wall brackets, and side tables with their pairs of tall stands. He also designed gold and silver plate. The craze for collecting china which was at its height in his time is illustrated in his lavish designs for receptacles for porcelain: in one of his plates there are more than 300 pieces of china on the chimneypiece alone.

<text>Broughton is a hamlet and civil parish to the east of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, England. Broughton is also the name of a nearby housing estate in Aylesbury itself.

Early recordings of Broughton are:
- the Domesday Book where it appears as &quot;22 households (quite large)&quot;
- as being part of the manor of Bierton in the late 13th century. The hamlet name is Anglo-Saxon and means &quot;farm by a brook&quot;. The brook in this case is the Bearbrook that rises near Bedgrove, flows through Broughton then back into Aylesbury before joining the River Thame near Quarrendon.

In the 1840s, a new branch railway was constructed linking Aylesbury to the Midlands that crossed the road that linked Broughton with Bierton. A public house and signalmen&#x27;s cottages were constructed at the level crossing and the area became known as Broughton Crossing. Today, this is considered a separate hamlet from Broughton itself.

In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson described Bierton With Broughton like this:
&quot;BIERTON-WITH-BROUGHTON, a parish in Aylesbury district, Bucks; on the Aylesbury railway, near the Aylesbury canal, 1½ mile NE of Aylesbury. It has a post office, of the name of Bierton, under Aylesbury. Acres, 2,470. Real property, £5,312. Pop., 691. Houses, 149. The property is divided among a few. The living is a vicarage, united with the vicarage of Quarrendon, in the diocese of Oxford. Value, £310.* Patrons, the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln. The church is a structure of the 12th century, with tower and spire; was recently well repaired; and contains a piscina, and a curious monument of 1616 to Samuel Pope and his thirteen children. There are chapels for Baptists and Methodists, a national school, and charities £40.&quot;

In the 1960s British housing boom, land that belonged to the parish of Bierton was sold to developers who constructed the housing estate of Broughton. Many local people immediately think of the estate when they hear the word &#x27;Broughton,&#x27; as it is a very popular estate on which to live. This was one of several developments in Aylesbury. All that separates Broughton hamlet from Broughton estate today is the brook from which the hamlet first took its name.

Broughton is served by New Millside Pre-School for children aged from two to five, Broughton Infant School for children aged from four to seven, and Broughton Junior School for children aged from seven to eleven. Both schools are community schools, which each take approximately 180 pupils.

In the same building as the pre-school, there is the Sure Start Children&#x27;s Centre which serves the Broughton and immediately surrounding areas.

There is an Anglican (Church of England) Church that meets at Circus Fields Canal Basin HP20 1AP) The church was established in 1989. Originally it was a daughter church of Holy Trinity, Walton. In August 2009 the Church Commissioners changed the parish boundaries in this part of Aylesbury and Broughton Church became a parish in its own right.

In July 2014 a community coffee shop called more+ was opened in Parton Road. It is operated by Broughton Community Action which is a Registered Charity. The aim is to provide a place where residents can meet and enhance community on the estate.

Arriva the Shires &amp; Essex &#x27;Pink Route&#x27; 8 to Aylesbury bus station serves Broughton housing estate Monday-Saturday, at a frequency of up to every 20 minutes. The service runs via the nearby housing estate of Bedgrove.

== Civil parish ==

Historically Broughton formed part of the civil parish of Bierton with Broughton with Bierton and other neighbouring hamlets. The development of the new village of Kingsbrook and the subsequent desire for a new parish council there to be separated from that of Bierton. As this proposal would result in the land around Broughton to the south of Kingsbrook becoming separated from Bierton, it was decided to divide the parish of Bierton with Broughton into three, and the new parish of Broughton Hamlet came into existence on 7 May 2020.

<text>Ramla or Ramle (, &quot;Ramlā&quot;; , &quot;ar-Ramleh&quot;) is a city in the Central District of Israel. Ramle is one of Israel&#x27;s mixed cities, with significant numbers of both Jews and Arabs.

The city was founded in the early 8th century CE by the Umayyad caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik as the capital of Jund Filastin, the district he governed in Bilad al-Sham before becoming caliph in 715. The city&#x27;s strategic and economic value derived from its location at the intersection of the &quot;Via Maris&quot;, connecting Cairo with Damascus, and the road connecting the Mediterranean port of Jaffa with Jerusalem. It rapidly overshadowed the adjacent city of Lydda, whose inhabitants were relocated to the new city. Not long after its establishment, Ramla developed as the commercial centre of Palestine, serving as a hub for pottery, dyeing, weaving, and olive oil, and as the home of numerous Muslim scholars. Its prosperity was lauded by geographers in the 10th–11th centuries, when the city was ruled by the Fatimids and Seljuks.

It lost its role as a provincial capital shortly before the arrival of the First Crusaders (), after which it became the scene of various battles between the Crusaders and Fatimids in the first years of the 12th century. Later that century, it became the centre of a lordship in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, a Crusader state established by Godfrey of Bouillon.

Ramla had an Arab-majority population before most were expelled during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The town was subsequently repopulated by Jewish immigrants. Today, Ramla is one of Israel&#x27;s mixed cities, with a population 76% Jewish and 24% Arab.

==History==
===Umayyad period===
The Umayyad prince and governor of Palestine, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik, founded Ramla as the seat of his administration, replacing Lydda, the Muslims&#x27; original provincial capital. Sulayman had been appointed governor by his father Caliph Abd al-Malik before the end of his reign in 705 and continued in office through the reign of his brother Caliph al-Walid I (), whom he succeeded. He died as caliph in 717. Ramla remained the capital of Palestine through the Fatimid period (10th–11th centuries). Its role as the principal city and district capital came to an end shortly before the arrival of the First Crusaders in 1099. It received its name, the singular form of &quot;raml&quot; (sand), from the sandy area in which it sat.

Sulayman&#x27;s motives for founding Ramla were personal ambition and practical considerations. The location of Ramla near Lydda, a long-established and prosperous city, was logistically and economically advantageous. The area&#x27;s economic importance was based on its strategic location at the intersection of the two major roads linking Egypt with Syria (the so-called &quot;Via Maris&quot;) and linking Jerusalem with the Mediterranean coast. Sulayman established his city in Lydda&#x27;s vicinity, avoiding Lydda proper. This was likely due to a lack of available space for wide-scale development and agreements dating to the Muslim conquest in the 630s that, at least formally, precluded him from confiscating desirable property within Lydda.

In a tradition recorded by the historian Ibn Fadlallah al-Umari (died 1347), a determined local Christian cleric refused Sulayman&#x27;s requests for plots in the middle of Lydda. Infuriated, he attempted to have the cleric executed, but his local adviser Raja ibn Haywa dissuaded him and instead proposed building a new city at a superior, adjacent site. In choosing the site, Sulayman utilized the strategic advantages of Lydda&#x27;s vicinity while avoiding the physical constraints of an already-established urban center. Historian Moshe Sharon holds that Lydda was &quot;too Christian in ethos for the taste of the Umayyad rulers&quot;, particularly following the Arabization and Islamization reforms instituted by Abd al-Malik.

According to al-Jahshiyari (died 942), Sulayman sought a lasting reputation as a great builder following the example of his father and al-Walid, the respective founders of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and the Great Mosque of Damascus. The construction of Ramla was Sulayman&#x27;s &quot;way to immortality&quot; and &quot;his personal stamp on the landscape of Palestine&quot;, according to Luz.

The first structure Sulayman erected in Ramla was his palatial residence, which dually served as the seat of Palestine&#x27;s administration (). The next structure was the Dar al-Sabbaghin (House of the Dyers). At the center of the new city was a congregational mosque, later known as the White Mosque. It was not completed until the reign of Sulayman&#x27;s successor Caliph Umar II (). The Sulayman&#x27;s construction works were financially managed by a Christian from Lydda, Bitrik ibn al-Naka. The remains of the White Mosque, dominated by a minaret added at a later date, are visible in the present day. In the courtyard are underground water cisterns from the Umayyad period. From early on, Ramla developed economically as a market town for the surrounding area&#x27;s agricultural products, and as a center for dyeing, weaving and pottery. It was also home to many Muslim religious scholars.

Sulayman built an aqueduct in the city called al-Barada, which transported water to Ramla from Tel Gezer, about to the southeast. Ramla superseded Lydda as the commercial center of Palestine. Many of Lydda&#x27;s Christian, Samaritan and Jewish inhabitants were moved to the new city. Although the traditional accounts are in agreement that Lydda almost immediately fell into obscurity following the founding of Ramla, narratives vary about the extent of Sulayman&#x27;s efforts to transfer Lydda&#x27;s inhabitants to Ramla, some holding that he only demolished a church in Lydda and others that he demolished the city altogether. Al-Ya&#x27;qubi (died 839) noted Sulayman razed the houses of Lydda&#x27;s inhabitants to force their relocation to Ramla and punished those who resisted. In the words of al-Jahshiyari, Sulayman &quot;founded the town of al-Ramla and its mosque and thus caused the ruin of Lod [Lydda]&quot;.

===Abbasid period===

The Abbasids toppled the Umayyads in 750, confiscating the White Mosque and all other Umayyad properties in Ramla. The Abbasids annually reviewed the high costs of maintaining the Barada canal, though starting under the reign of Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim it became a regular part of the state&#x27;s expenditures. In the late 9th century the Muslim inhabitants were composed mainly of Arabs and Persians, while the clients of the Muslims were Samaritans.

The golden age of Ramla under the Umayyads and Abbasids, when the city overtook Jerusalem as a trade center, later gave way to a period of political instability and war beginning in the late 10th century. The Egypt-based Fatimids conquered Ramla in 969 and ten years later the city was destroyed by the Jarrahids, a branch of the Tayy tribe.

Nonetheless, the 10th-century Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi described Ramla as &quot;a fine city, and well built; its water is good and plentiful; it fruits are abundant&quot;. He noted that it &quot;combines manifold advantages, situated as it is in the midst of beautiful villages and lordly towns, near to holy places and pleasant hamlets&quot;, as well as bountiful fields, walled towns and hospices. The geographer further noted the city&#x27;s significant commerce and &quot;excellent markets&quot;, lauding the quality of its fruits and bread as the best of their kind. During this period, Ramla was one of the major centers for the production and export of oil extracted from unripe olives, known as &quot;anfa kinon&quot; (Greek: ὀμφάκιον, ὀμφάχινον; Latin: omphacium; ), and used in cuisine and medicine.

Conversely, the city&#x27;s disadvantages included the severe muddiness of the place during the rainy winter season and its hard, sandy grounds due to its distance from natural water sources. The limited drinking water gathered in the city&#x27;s cisterns were generally inaccessible to the poorer inhabitants.

By 1011–1012, the Jarrahids controlled all of Palestine, except for the coastal towns, and captured Ramla from its Fatimid garrison, making it their capital. The city and the surrounding places were plundered by the Bedouin, impoverishing much of the population. The Jarrahids brought the Alid emir of Mecca, al-Hasan ibn Ja&#x27;far, to act as caliph in defiance of the Fatimids. The development was short-lived, as the Jarrahids abandoned al-Hasan after Fatimid bribes, and the caliphal claimant left the city for Mecca. A Fatimid army led by Ali ibn Ja&#x27;far ibn Fallah wrested control of Ramla from the Jarrahids, who continued to dominate the surrounding countryside. The following decade was marked by peace, but, in 1024, the Jarrahids renewed their rebellion. The Fatimid general Anushtakin al-Dizbari secured Ramla for a few months, but the Jarrahids overran the city that year, killing and harassing several inhabitants and seizing much of the population&#x27;s wealth. They appointed their own governor, Nasr Allah ibn Nizal. In the following year, al-Dizbari drove the Jarrahids out of Ramla, but was recalled to Egypt in 1026. In 1029, he returned and routed the Jarrahids and their Bedouin allies.

Persian geographer Nasir-i-Khusrau visited the city in 1047, remarking: 
Ramla is a great city, with strong walls built of stone, mortared, of great height and thickness, with iron gates opening therein. From the town to the sea-coast is a distance of three leagues. The inhabitants get their water from the rainfall, and in each house is a tank for storing the same, in order that there may always be a supply. In the middle of the Friday Mosque [White Mosque], also, is a large tank: and from it, when it is filled with water, anyone who wishes may take. The area of the mosque measures two hundred paces (&quot;Gam&quot;) by three hundred. Over one of its porches (&quot;suffah&quot;) is an inscription stating that on the 15th of Muharram, of the year 425 (=10th of December, 1033 CE), there came an earthquake of great violence, which threw down a large number of buildings, but that no single person sustained an injury. In the city of Ramla there is marble in plenty, and most of the buildings and private houses are of this material; and, further, the surface thereof they do most beautifully sculpture and ornament. They cut the marble here with a toothless saw, which is worked with &#x27;Mekka sand&#x27;. They saw the marble in length, as is the case with wood, to form the columns; not in across; they also cut it into slabs. The marbles that I saw here were of all colours, some variegated, some green, red, black and white. There is, too, at Ramla, a particular kind of fig, and this they export to all the countries round. This city Ramla, throughout Syria and the West, is known under the name of Filastin.

===Crusader period===

The armies of the First Crusade took the hastily evacuated town without a fight. In the early years of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem though, control over this strategic location led to three consecutive battles between the Crusaders and Egyptian armies from Ascalon, a Fatimid-held town along the southern coast of Palestine. As Crusader rule stabilized, Ramla became the seat of a seigneury in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Lordship of Ramla within the County of Jaffa and Ascalon. It was a city of some economic significance and an important way station for pilgrims travelling to Jerusalem. The Crusaders identified it with the biblical Ramathaim and called it Arimathea.

Around 1163, the rabbi and traveller Benjamin of Tudela, who also mistook it for a more ancient city, visited &quot;Rama, or Ramleh, where there are remains of the walls from the days of our ancestors, for thus it was found written upon the stones. About 300 Jews dwell there. It was formerly a very great city; at a distance of two miles (3 km) there is a large Jewish cemetery.&quot;

===Late medieval period===
In the 1480s, in the late Mamluk era, Felix Fabri visited Ramla and described (among other things) the hammam there; &quot;built in a wonderous and clever fashion&quot;.

In the early days of the Ottoman period, in 1548, a census was taken recording 528 Muslim families and 82 Christian families living in Ramla.

On 2 March 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte occupied Ramla during his unsuccessful bid to conquer Palestine, using the Franciscan hospice as his headquarters. The village appeared as &#x27;Ramleh&#x27; on the map of Pierre Jacotin compiled during this campaign.

In 1838, Edward Robinson found Ramleh to be a town of about 3000 inhabitants, surrounded by olive-groves and vegetables. It had few streets, and the houses were made of stone and were well-built. There were several mosques in the town.

In 1863, Victor Guérin noted that the Latin (Catholic) population was reduced to two priests and 50 parishioners. In 1869, the population was given as 3,460; 3000 Muslims, 400 Greek Orthodox and 60 Catholics.

In 1882, the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; noted that there was a bazaar in the town, &quot;but its prosperity has much decayed, and many of the houses are falling into ruins, including the Serai.&quot; Expansion began only at the end of the 19th century.

In 1889, 31 Jewish worker families settled in the town, which had no Jewish population at the time.

===British Mandate period===

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &#x27;Ramleh&#x27; had a population of 7,312 (5,837 Muslims, 1,440 Christians and 35 Jews). The Christians were further noted by denomination: 1,226 Orthodox, 2 Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites), 150 Roman Catholics, 8 Melkite Catholics, 4 Maronite, 15 Armenian, 2 Abyssinian Church and 36 Anglicans.

Less than a decade later, the population had increased nearly 25%; the 1931 census recorded 10,347 people (8,157 Muslims, 2,194 Christians, five Jews, and two Druze), in a total of 2,339 houses.

Ramla was connected to wired electricity (supplied by the Zionist-owned Palestine Electric Company) towards the end of the 1920s. Economist Basim Faris noted this fact as proof of Ramla&#x27;s higher standard of living than neighbouring Lydda. In Ramla, he wrote, &quot;economic demands triumph over nationalism&quot; while Lydda, &quot;which is ten minutes&#x27; walk from Ramleh, is still averse to such a convenience as electric current, and so is not as yet served; perhaps the low standard of living of the poor population prevents the use of the service at the present rates, which cannot compete with petroleum for lighting&quot;.

Sheikh Mustafa al-Khairi was mayor of Ramla from 1920 to 1947.

The 1938 village statistics list the population (&quot;Ramle, Er&quot;) as 11,950.

The 1945/46 survey gives &#x27;Ramle&#x27; a population of 15,160 (11,900 Muslims and 3,260 Christians).

===1947–48 war===


Ramla was part of the territory allotted to a proposed Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. However, Ramla&#x27;s geographic location and its strategic position on the main supply route to Jerusalem made it a point of contention during the 1947–1948 civil war, followed by the internationalised 1948 Arab–Israeli War. A bomb by the Jewish militia group Irgun went off in the Ramla market on 18 February, killing 7 residents and injuring 45.

After a number of unsuccessful raids on Ramla, the Israeli army launched Operation Dani. Ramla was captured on 12 July 1948, a few days after the capture of Lydda. The Arab resistance surrendered on July 12, and most of the remaining inhabitants were expelled. A disputed claim, advanced by scholars including Ilan Pappé, characterizes this as ethnic cleansing. By November 1949, there were about 2,000 Arabs in Ramla and Lod.

===State of Israel===
Ramla became a mixed Jewish–Arab town within the state of Israel. Arab homes of those who left in Ramla were given by the Israeli government to Jews, first Holocaust refugees from Europe and then immigrants from Arab and Muslim countries. In February 1949, the Jewish population was over 6,000. Ramla remained economically depressed over the next two decades, although the population steadily mounted, reaching 34,000 by 1972.

A 2013 Israeli police report documented that the Central District ranks fourth among Israel&#x27;s seven districts in terms of drug-related arrests. Today, five of Israel&#x27;s prisons are located in Ramla, including the maximum-security Ayalon Prison and the country&#x27;s only women&#x27;s prison, called Neve Tirza. In 2015, Ramla had one of Israel&#x27;s highest crime rates.

==Landmarks==
===White Tower===
The Tower of Ramla, also known as the White Tower, was built in the 13th century. It served as the minaret of the White Mosque (&quot;al-Masjid al-Abyad&quot;) erected by Caliph Suleiman in the 8th century, of which only remnants are to be seen today. The tower is six stories high, with a spiral staircase of 119 steps.
===Pool of Arches===
The Pool of Arches, also known as St. Helen&#x27;s Pool and Bīr al-Anezīya, is an underground water cistern built during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Haroun al-Rashid in 789 CE (in the Early Muslim period) to provide Ramla with a steady supply of water. Use of the cistern was apparently discontinued at the beginning of the tenth century (the beginning of the Fatimid period), possibly due to the fact that the main aqueduct to the city went out of use at that time.

===Great Mosque===
The Crusaders built a cathedral in the first half on the 12th century, converted into a mosque when the Mamluks conquered Ramla in the second half of the 13th century, when they added a round minaret, an entrance from the north, and a mihrab. The Great Mosque of Ramla, also known as the El-Omari Mosque, it is in architectural terms Israel&#x27;s largest and best-preserved Crusader church.

===Franciscan church and hospice===
The Hospice of St Nicodemus and St Joseph of Arimathea on Ramla&#x27;s main boulevard, Herzl Street, is easily recognized by its clock-faced, square tower. It belongs to the Franciscan church. Napoleon used the hospice as his headquarters during his Palestine campaign in 1799.
===Ramla Museum===
The Ramla Museum is housed in the former municipal headquarters of the British Mandatory authorities. The building, from 1922, incorporates elements of Arab architecture such as arched windows and patterned tiled floors. After 1948, it was the central district office of the Israeli Ministry of Finance. In 2001, the building became a museum documenting the history of Ramla.

===British Commonwealth War Cemetery===
The Commonwealth War Cemetery is the largest of its kind in Israel, holding graves of soldiers fallen during both World Wars and the British Mandate period.

==Archaeology==
===Identification===
A tradition reported by Ishtori Haparchi (1280–1355) and other early Jewish writers is that Ramla was the biblical Gath of the Philistines. Initial archaeological claims seemed to indicate that Ramla was not built on the site of an ancient city, although in recent years the ruins of an older city were uncovered to the south of Ramla. Earlier, Benjamin Mazar had proposed that ancient Gath lay at the site of Ras Abu Hamid east of Ramla. Avi-Yonah, however, considered that to be a different Gath, usually now called Gath-Gittaim. This view is also supported by other scholars, those holding that there was, both, a Gath (believed to be &quot;Tell es-Safi&quot;) and Gath-rimmon or Gittaim (in or near Ramla).

===Excavation history===
Archaeological excavations in Ramla conducted in 1992–1995 unearthed the remains of a dyeing industry (&quot;Dar al-Sabbaghin&quot;, House of the Dyers) near the White Mosque; hydraulic installations such as pools, subterranean reservoirs and cisterns; and abundant ceramic finds that include glass, coins and jar handles stamped with Arabic inscriptions. Excavations in Ramla continued into 2010, led by Eli Haddad, Orit Segal, Vered Eshed, and Ron Toueg, on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).

In January 2021, archaeologists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Haifa University announced the discovery of six engravings on 120,000-year-old aurochs bone near the city of Ramla in the open-air Middle Paleolithic site of Nesher Ramla. According to  archaeologist Yossi Zaidner, this finding was definitely the oldest in the Levant. Three-dimensional imaging and microscopic analysis were used to examine the bone. The six lines ranged in length from 38 to 42 millimeters.

==Geology==
===Earthquakes===
The city has historically suffered severe damage from several major earthquakes, including the 1033 Jordan Rift Valley earthquake, 1068 Near East earthquake, smaller earthquakes in 1070 and 1546, and the 1927 Jericho earthquake.

===Rare cave ecosystem===

In May 2006, a naturally sealed-off underground space now known as Ayyalon Cave was discovered near Ramla, outside Moshav Yad Rambam. The cave sustains an unusual type of ecosystem, based on bacteria that create all the energy they need chemically, from the sulfur compounds they find in the water, with no light or organic food coming in from the surface. A bulldozer working in the Nesher cement quarry on the outskirts of Ramla accidentally broke into the cavern. The finds have been attributed to the cave&#x27;s isolation, which led to the evolution of a whole food chain of specially developed organisms, including several previously unknown species of invertebrates. With several large halls on different levels, it measures long, making it the third-largest limestone cave in Israel.

One of the finds was an eyeless scorpion, given the name &quot;Akrav israchanani&quot; honouring the researchers who identified it, Israel Naaman and Hanan Dimentman. All ten specimen of the blind scorpion found in the cave had been dead for several years, possibly because recent overpumping of the groundwater has led the underground lake to shrink, and with it the food supply to dwindle. Seven more species of troglobite crustaceans and springtails were discovered in &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark Cave&quot;, as the cave has been dubbed by journalists, several of them unknown to science.

==Demographics==
According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), a total of 63,462 people were living in Ramla at the end of 2004. In 2001, the ethnic makeup of the city was 80% Jewish, 20% Arab (16% Muslim Arabs and 4% Christian Arabs). Ramla is the center of Karaite Judaism in Israel.

Most Jews from Karachi, Pakistan, have migrated to Israel and have resettled in Ramle, where they have built a synagogue named Magen Shalome, after the Magain Shalome Synagogue from Karachi.

==Economy==
According to CBS data, there were 21,000 salaried workers and 1,700 self-employed persons in Ramla in 2000. The mean monthly wage for a salaried worker was NIS 4,300, with a real increase of 4.4% over the course of 2000. Salaried males had a mean monthly wage of NIS 5,200, with a real increase of 3.3%, compared to NIS 3,300 for women, with a real increase of 6.3%. The average income for self-employed persons was NIS 4,900. A total of 1,100 persons received unemployment benefits, and 5,600 received income supplements.

Nesher Israel Cement Enterprises, Israel&#x27;s sole producer of cement, maintains its flagship factory in Ramla. Archaeological excavations on the grounds of the Nesher quarry have discovered the remains of a large Second Temple Jewish town and the Christian Byzantine settlement established over it. Over fifty underground hiding complexes were found in the area, some used for storage and others believed to be hiding places for humans with access to water.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Ramla Railway Station provides an hourly service on the Israel Railways Tel Aviv–Jerusalem line. The station is located in north east side of the city and originally opened in April 1891, making it the oldest active railway station in Israel. It was most recently reopened on April 12, 2003 after having been rebuilt in a new location closer to the town&#x27;s center.

===Education===
According to CBS, there are 31 schools and 12,000 students in the city. These include 22 elementary schools with a student population of 7,700 and nine high schools with a population of 3,800. In 2001, 47% of Ramla&#x27;s 12th grade students graduated with a &quot;bagrut&quot; matriculation certificate. Many of the Jewish schools are run by Jewish orthodox organisations.

The Arabs, both Muslims and Christian, increasingly depend on their own private schools and not Israeli governmental schools. There are currently two Christian schools, such as Terra Santa School, the Greek Orthodox School, and there is one Islamic school in preparations.

The &quot;Owpen House&quot; in Ramla is a preschool and daycare center for Arab and Jewish children. In the afternoons, Open House runs extracurricular coexistence programs for Jewish, Christian, and Muslim children.

<doc id="323257" wikidata="Q384102" url="?curid=323257" title="Obol (coin)">
<text>The obol (, &quot;obolos&quot;, also (&quot;obelós&quot;), (&quot;obellós&quot;), (&quot;odelós&quot;).  &quot;nail, metal spit&quot;; ) was a form of ancient Greek currency and weight.
==Currency==
Obols were used from early times. According to Plutarch they were originally spits of copper or bronze traded by weight, while six obols make a drachma or a handful, since that was as many as the hand could grasp. Heraklides of Pontus (died 310 BC) is cited as having mentioned the obols of Heraion and also gives the etymology of &quot;obolos&quot; (the name of the coin) from &quot;obelos&quot; (the word for &quot;spit, spike, nail&quot;). Similarly, the historian Ephorus in his equally lost work &quot;On Inventions&quot; (mid 4th century BC) is said to have mentioned the obols of Heraion. 
Excavations at Argos discovered several dozen of these early obols, dated well before 800 BC; they are now displayed at the Numismatic Museum of Athens. Archaeologists today describe the iron spits as &quot;utensil-money&quot; since excavated hoards indicate that during the Late Geometric period they were exchanged in handfuls (drachmae) of six spits; they were not used for manufacturing artifacts as metallurgical analyses suggest, but they were most likely used as token-money. Plutarch states the Spartans had an iron obol of four coppers. They retained the cumbersome and impractical bars rather than proper coins to discourage the pursuit of wealth.

In Classical Athens, obols were traded as silver coins. Six obols made up the drachma. There were also coins worth two obols (&quot;diobol&quot;) and three obols (&quot;triobol&quot;). By the 5th century BC, variations on obols expanded to include coins worth one and one-half (&quot;trihemiobol&quot;) obols and half obols (&quot;hemiobol&quot;). The 4th century BC diversified further with some minted obols worth as little as one-eighth obol, equivalent to a single copper. Each obol was divisible into eight &quot;coppers&quot; (, &quot;khalkoí&quot;). In some other cities the obol was instead divided into twelve coppers. During this era, an obol purchased a kantharos and chous () of wine. Three obols was a standard rate for prostitutes. In the 4th century BC, bronze obols were first minted, which were generally larger due to bronze being a less precious metal than silver, thus needing a larger amount to produce an equivalent coin. This larger size made bronze coins fairly popular, as their small, silver predecessors were much easier to lose track of. Obols had a variety of designs stamped into them based on the region in which they were produced. Athenian obols were typically emblazoned with the face of Athena on one side, and an owl on the reverse. Other regions in Greece had various designs, but the Athenian design was popular enough that the majority of obols discovered by archaeologists today bear the owl design. Diobols and triobols were differentiated from standard obols through slight variations to the owl design, changing the way the bird faced and how its wings were positioned for easily identifiable currency.

===Funerary use===
The deceased were buried with an obol placed in the mouth of the corpse, so that—once a deceased&#x27;s shade reached Hades—they would be able to pay Charon for passage across the river Acheron or Styx. Legend had it that those without enough wealth or whose friends refused to follow proper burial rites were forced to wander the banks of the river for one hundred years until they were allowed to cross it.

==Weight==
The obol or obolus was also a measurement of Greek, Roman, and apothecaries&#x27; weight.

In ancient Greece, it was generally reckoned as drachma ( ). Under Roman rule, it was defined as Roman ounce or about . The apothecaries&#x27; system also reckoned the obol or obolus as ounce or scruple. While 0.72 grams was the weight of a standard Greek obol, the actual amount of silver that went into making the currency could vary from region to region. Obols in Athens were typically near the 0.72-gram standard, while Corinth was documented having 0.42-gram obols.

==Literary use==
The obolus, along with the mirror, was a symbol of new schismatic heretics in the short stories &quot;The Zahir&quot; and &quot;The Theologians&quot; by Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges. In the story&#x27;s discussion of the circularity of time, eternity, and the transmigration of the soul through several bodies the author uses a quotation of Luke 12:59, mistranslated as &quot;no one will be released from prison until he has paid the last obolus&quot; since Luke calls the coin a lepton (a somewhat smaller denomination) rather than an obolus.

<text>Broughton Crossing is a hamlet / small settlement located between the Buckinghamshire villages of Bierton and Broughton in England. It is in the civil parish of Bierton with Broughton.

It takes its name from a long-vanished level crossing where the road crossed the now-defunct Cheddington to Aylesbury Line a branch line connecting the West Coast Main Line at Cheddington and Aylesbury. It consists of a public house and a few private houses, the easterly part of the former railway has been made into a road. It is a distinct settlement separated from Broughton itself by the Aylesbury Arm of the Grand Union Canal.

There is an urban myth that there was once a railway station or halt there.</text><links>

<doc id="323260" wikidata="Q2428580" url="?curid=323260" title="Explosive booster">
<text>An explosive booster is a sensitive explosive charge that acts as a bridge between a (relatively weak) conventional detonator and a low-sensitivity (but typically high-energy) explosive such as TNT. By itself, the initiating detonator would not deliver sufficient energy to set off the low-sensitivity charge. However, it detonates the primary charge (the booster), which then delivers an explosive shockwave that is sufficient to detonate the secondary, main, high-energy charge. 

Unlike C4 plastic explosive, not all explosives can be detonated simply by inserting a detonator and firing it.

An initiator such as a shock tube, cannon fuse, or even a conventional detonator does not deliver sufficient shock to detonate charges comprising TNT, Composition B, ANFO and many other high explosives. Therefore, some form of &quot;booster&quot; is required to amplify the energy released by the detonator so that the main charge will detonate. 

At first, picric acid was used as a booster to detonate TNT, though it was superseded due to the inherent danger of picrate formation. Tetryl replaced picric acid because it is more stable, and was once a very popular chemical for booster charges, particularly during World War II. However, since then, tetryl has largely been replaced by other compositions, e.g. a small cylinder or pellet of phlegmatized RDX (e.g. CH-6 or Composition A-5) or PETN (slightly larger than the actual detonator) into which the detonator itself is inserted.

Note: booby traps and improvised explosive devices frequently use plastic explosive as the booster charge, for example, some C4 or Semtex stuffed into the empty fuze pocket of a 120mm mortar shell. This is because any standard detonator will initiate plastic explosive as is.

When encountered in connection with artillery shells or air dropped bombs, a booster charge is sometimes referred to as the &quot;gaine&quot;, from . See detonators.

At a purely technical level, a sufficiently large detonator would initiate high explosives without the need for a booster charge. However, there are very good reasons why this method is never used. Firstly, there is a major safety issue, i.e. detonators are (like all primary explosives) much more sensitive to shock, heat, and friction than an explosive booster. Therefore, minimising the amount of primary explosive that users must store or carry greatly reduces the likelihood of serious accidents. An additional economic reason for using explosive booster charges is that chemical compounds used in detonators (e.g. lead styphnate) are comparatively expensive to produce and encapsulate when compared to the manufacturing costs of explosive boosters.

A common form for boosters is to cast the explosive material into a cylindrical shell made of cardboard or plastic; these are accordingly known as cast boosters.

<doc id="323262" wikidata="Q850107" url="?curid=323262" title="Bungalow">
<text>A bungalow is a small house or cottage that is single-storey, sometimes with a smaller upper storey set in the roof and windows that come out from the roof, and may be surrounded by wide verandas.

The first house in England that was classified as a bungalow was built in 1869. In the United States, it was initially used as a vacation architecture, and was most popular between 1900 and 1918, especially with the Arts and Crafts movement.

The term bungalow is derived from the word and used elliptically to mean &quot;a house in the Bengal style&quot;.

== Design considerations ==
Bungalows are very convenient for the homeowner in that all living areas are on a single storey and there are no stairs between living areas. A bungalow is well suited to persons with impaired mobility, such as the elderly or those using wheelchairs.

Neighbourhoods of only bungalows offer more privacy than similar neighbourhoods with two-storey houses. As bungalows are one or one and a half storeys, strategically planted trees and shrubs are usually sufficient to block the view of neighbours. With two-storey houses, the extra height requires much taller trees to accomplish the same, and it may not be practical to place such tall trees close to the building to obscure the view from the second floor of the next-door neighbour. Bungalows provide cost-effective residences. On the other hand, even closely spaced bungalows make for quite low-density neighbourhoods, contributing to urban sprawl. In Australia, bungalows have broad verandas to shade the interior from intense sun. But as a result they are often excessively dark inside, requiring artificial light even in daytime.

=== Cost and space considerations ===
On a per unit of area basis (whether square metre or square foot), bungalows are more expensive to construct than two-storey houses, because the same foundation and roof is required for a smaller living area.

Although the &quot;footprint&quot; of a bungalow is often a simple rectangle, any foundation is theoretically possible. For bungalows with brick walls, the windows are often positioned high, and are close to the roof. This architectural technique avoids the need for special arches or lintels to support the brick wall above the windows. However, in two-storey houses, there is no choice but to continue the brick wall above the window.

== By region ==
=== Australia ===

From 1891 the Federation Bungalow style swept across Australia, first in Camberwell, Victoria, and through Sydney&#x27;s northern suburbs after 1895. The developer Richard Stanton built in Federation Bungalow style first in Haberfield, New South Wales, the first Garden Suburb (1901), and then in Rosebery, New South Wales (1912). Beecroft, Hornsby and Lindfield contain many examples of Federation Bungalows built between 1895 and 1920.

From about 1908 to the 1930s, the California bungalow style was very popular in Australia with a rise of interest in single-family homes and planned urban communities. The style first saw widespread use in the suburbs of Sydney. It then spread throughout the Australian states and New Zealand.

In South Australia, the suburb of Colonel Light Gardens contains many well-preserved bungalow developments.

=== Bangladesh ===

In rural Bangladesh, the concept is often called &quot;Bangla ghar&quot; (&quot;Bengali-style house&quot;) and remains popular. The main construction material is corrugated steel sheets or red clay tiles, while past generations used wood, bamboo, and &quot;khar&quot; straw. In houses that used straw as roof, it was used for keeping the house cooler during hot summer days.

The dak bungalows formerly used by the British mail services during the British Raj period in Bengal.

=== Canada ===
Canada uses the definition of a bungalow to mean a single-family dwelling that is one storey high.
=== Germany ===
In Germany a bungalow refers to a single-storey house with a flat roof. This building style was most popular during the 1960s. The two criteria are mentioned in contemporary literature e.g. &quot;Landhaus und Bungalow&quot; by Klara Trost (1961).

=== India ===

In India, the term &quot;bungalow&quot; or &quot;villa&quot; refers to any single-family unit, as opposed to an apartment building, which is the norm for Indian middle-class city living. The normal custom for an Indian bungalow is one storey, but as time progressed many families built larger two-storey houses to accommodate humans and pets. The area with bungalows built in the 1920s–1930s in New Delhi is now known as Lutyens&#x27; Bungalow Zone and is an architectural heritage area. In Bandra, a suburb of India&#x27;s commercial capital Mumbai, numerous colonial-era bungalows exist; they are threatened by removal and replacement of ongoing development.

In a distinctly utilitarian usage, the dak bungalow was formerly used by circuit riding British jurists (and other officials such as the mailman), as well as quotidian private citizens, the most substantial of which have been converted into local governmental buildings and the like. The vast majority, however, were the most sparse of lodgings.

=== Ireland ===

The bungalow is the most common type of house built in the Irish countryside. During the Celtic Tiger years of the late 20th century, single-storey bungalows declined as a type of new construction, and residents built more two-storey or dormer bungalows. There was a trend in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland of people moving into rural areas and buying their own plots of land. Often these plots were large, so a one-storey bungalow was quite practical, particularly for retirees.

=== Singapore and Malaysia ===

In Singapore and Malaysia, the term &quot;bungalow&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a house that was built during the colonial era. The structures were constructed &quot;from the early 19th century until the end of World War II.&quot; They were built by the British to house their &quot;military officers, High Court judges and other members of the colonial society&#x27;s great and good.&quot;

At present, there is still a high demand for colonial-era bungalows in Singapore and Malaysia. Most of the units are used as residences. Over the years, some have been transformed into offices, hotels, galleries, spas and restaurants.

In the post-colonial period, the term &quot;bungalow&quot; has been adapted and used to refer to any stand-alone residence, regardless of size, architectural style, or era in which it was built. Calling a house a bungalow often carries with it connotations of the price and status of the residence, and thus the wealth of its owner. Local real estate lingo commonly includes the word &quot;bungalow&quot; when referring to residences that are more normally described as &quot;detached&quot;, &quot;single-family homes&quot;, or even &quot;mansions&quot; in other countries. The pervasiveness of the word in the local jargon has resulted in &quot;bungalow&quot; being imported into the Malay language as the word &quot;banglo&quot; with the same meaning.

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, the term &quot;bungalow&quot; refers to a single storey, detached house. It may be implied that it is a temporary residence, such as a holiday home or student housing.

=== United Kingdom ===

The first two bungalows in England were built in Westgate-on-Sea in 1869 or 1870. A bungalow was a prefabricated single-storey building used as a seaside holiday home. Manufacturers included Boulton &amp; Paul Ltd, who made corrugated iron bungalows as advertised in their 1889 catalogue, which were erected by their men on the purchaser&#x27;s light brickwork foundation. Examples include Woodhall Spa Cottage Museum, and Castle Bungalow at Peppercombe, North Devon, owned by the Landmark Trust; it was built by Boulton and Paul in the 1920s. Construction of this type of bungalow peaked towards the end of the decade, to be replaced by brick construction.

Bungalows became popular in the United Kingdom between the two World Wars and very large numbers were built, particularly in coastal resorts, giving rise to the pejorative adjective, &quot;bungaloid&quot;, first found in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; from 1927: &quot;Hideous allotments and bungaloid growth make the approaches to any city repulsive&quot;. Many villages and seaside resorts have large estates of 1960s bungalows, usually occupied by retired people. The typical 1930s bungalow is square in plan, with those of the 1960s more likely to be oblong. It is rare for the term &quot;bungalow&quot; to be used in British English to denote a dwelling having other than a single storey, or one adapted from a single storey building, in which case &quot;chalet bungalow&quot;, (see below) is used.

== Styles ==


=== Airplane bungalow ===
Although stylistically related to others, the special characteristic of the Airplane Bungalow was its single room on a second storey, surrounded by windows, designed as a sleeping room in summer weather with all-around access to breezes. This variant developed in California in the 1910s, had appeared in El Paso, Texas, by April 1916, and became most prevalent in the western half of the U.S., and southwestern and western Canada.

=== American Craftsman bungalow ===

The American Craftsman bungalow typified the styles of the American Arts and Crafts movement, with common features usually including low-pitched roof lines on a gabled or hipped roof, deeply overhanging eaves, exposed rafters or decorative brackets under the eaves, and a front porch or veranda beneath an extension of the main roof.

Sears Company and The Aladdin Company were two of the manufacturing companies that produced pre-fab kits and sold them from catalogues for construction on sites during the turn of the 20th century.

=== Bungalow colony ===

A special use of the term &quot;bungalow&quot; developed in the greater New York City area, between the 1930s and 1970s, to denote a cluster of small rental summer homes, usually in the Catskill Mountains in the area known as the Borscht Belt. First- and second-generation Jewish-American families were especially likely to rent such houses. The old bungalow colonies continue to exist in the Catskills, and are occupied today chiefly by Hasidic Jews.

=== California bungalow ===

The California bungalow was a widely popular -storey variation on the bungalow in the United States from 1910 to 1925. It was also widely popular in Australia within the period 1910–1940.

=== Chalet bungalow ===

A chalet bungalow is a bungalow with a second-storey loft. The loft may be extra space over the garage. It is often space to the side of a great room with a vaulted ceiling area. The building is marketed as a bungalow with loft because the main living areas of the house are on one floor. All the convenience of single-floor living still applies and the loft is not expected to be accessed on a daily basis.

Some have extra bedrooms in the loft or attic area. Such buildings are really one-and-a-half storeys and not bungalows, and are referred to in British English as &quot;chalet bungalows&quot; or as &quot;dormer bungalows&quot;. &quot;Chalet bungalow&quot; is also used in British English for where the area enclosed within pitched roof contains rooms, even if this comprises a large part of the living area and is fully integrated into the fabric of the property.

True bungalows do not use the attic. Because the attic is not used, the roof pitch can be quite shallow, constrained only by snow load considerations.

=== Chicago bungalow ===

The majority of Chicago bungalows were built between 1910 and 1940. They were typically constructed of brick (some including decorative accents), with one-and-a-half stories and a full basement. With more than 80,000 bungalows, the style represents nearly one-third of Chicago&#x27;s single-family housing stock. One primary difference between the Chicago bungalow and other types is that the gables are parallel to the street, rather than perpendicular. Like many other local houses, Chicago bungalows are relatively narrow, being an average of wide on a standard or wide city lot. Their veranda (porch) may either be open or partially enclosed (if enclosed, it may further be used to extend the interior rooms).

=== Michigan bungalow ===

There are numerous examples of Arts and Crafts bungalows built from 1910 to 1925 in the metro-Detroit area, including Royal Oak, Pleasant Ridge, Hazel Park, Highland Park and Ferndale. Keeping in line with the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement, the bungalows were constructed using local building materials.

=== Milwaukee bungalow ===
A large fraction of the older residential buildings in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, are bungalows in a similar Arts and Crafts style to those of Chicago, but usually with the gable perpendicular to the street. Also, many Milwaukee bungalows have white stucco on the lower portion of the exterior.

=== Overwater bungalow ===
The overwater bungalow is a form of, mainly high end, tourist accommodation inspired by the traditional stilt houses of South Asia and the Pacific. The first overwater bungalows were constructed on the French Polynesian island of Ra’iātea in 1967 by three American hotel owners, Jay Carlisle, Donald McCallum and Hugh Kelley.

They had wanted to attract tourists to Ra’iātea, and to their hotel, but the island had no real beaches and so to overcome this handicap they decided to build hotel rooms directly on the water using large wooden poles. These structures they called overwater bungalows and they were an immediate success.

By the seventies tourism to French Polynesia and the Pacific Islands in general was booming and overwater bungalows, sometimes by then called water villas, became synonymous with the region, particularly for honeymoons and romantic getaways. Soon this new tradition spread to many other parts of Asia, the Maldives being the best example, and other parts of the world including, in the last twenty years, many parts of the Caribbean. The first overwater bungalow resort in Mexico opened in 2016.

Their proliferation would have been much greater but for the fact that overwater bungalows need certain conditions to be structurally viable, i.e. that the water surrounding them be consistently very calm. Ideally the type of water that can be found in the lagoons and atolls of The Maldives or Bora Bora or, at the very least, that of an extremely sheltered bay. Therefore, despite their popularity, they still remain something of a touristic novelty.

=== Raised bungalow ===
A raised bungalow is one in which the basement is partially above ground. The benefit is that more light can enter the basement with above ground windows in the basement. A raised bungalow typically has a foyer at ground level that is halfway between the first floor and the basement. Thus, it further has the advantage of creating a foyer with a very high ceiling without the expense of raising the roof or creating a skylight. Raised bungalows often have the garage in the basement. Because the basement is not that deep, and the ground must slope downward away from the building, the slope of the driveway is quite shallow. This avoids the disadvantage of steep driveways found in most other basement garages. Bungalows without basements can still be raised, but the advantages of raising the bungalow are much less.

=== Ranch bungalow ===

A ranch bungalow is a bungalow organized so that bedrooms are on one side and &quot;public&quot; areas (kitchen, living/dining/family rooms) are on the other side. If there is an attached garage, the garage is on the public side of the building so that a direct entrance is possible, when this is allowed by legislation. On narrower lots, public areas are at the front of the building and such an organization is typically not called a &quot;ranch bungalow&quot;. Such buildings are often smaller and have only two bedrooms in the back as required.

=== Ultimate bungalow ===
The term &quot;ultimate bungalow&quot; is commonly used to describe a very large and detailed Craftsman-style house in the United States. The design is usually associated with such California architects as Greene and Greene, Bernard Maybeck, and Julia Morgan.

<text>The Universität der Künste Berlin (UdK; also known in English as the Berlin University of the Arts), situated in Berlin, Germany, is the second largest art school in Europe. It is a public art and design school, and one of the four research universities in the city.

The university is known for being one of the biggest and most diversified universities of the arts worldwide. It has four colleges specialising in fine arts, architecture, media and design, music and the performing arts with around 3,500 students. Thus the UdK is one of only three universities in Germany to unite the faculties of art and music in one institution. The teaching offered at the four colleges encompasses the full spectrum of the arts and related academic studies in more than 40 courses. Having the right to confer doctorates and post-doctoral qualifications, Berlin University of the Arts is also one of Germany&#x27;s few art colleges with full university status.

Outstanding professors and students at all its colleges, as well as the steady development of teaching concepts, have publicly defined the university as a high standard of artistic and art-theoretical education. Almost all the study courses at Berlin University of the Arts are part of a centuries-old tradition. Thus Berlin University of the Arts gives its students the opportunity to investigate and experiment with other art forms in order to recognise and extend the boundaries of their own discipline, at an early stage of rigorously selected artists and within the protected sphere of a study course.

Within the field of visual arts, the university is known for the intense competition that involves the selection of its students, and the growth of applicants worldwide has increased during the years due to Berlin&#x27;s important current role in cultural innovation worldwide. In the same way, the University of the Arts is publicly recognized for being on the cutting edge in the areas of Visual Arts, Fashion Design, Industrial Design, and Experimental Design.

==History==

The university&#x27;s origins date back to the foundation of &quot;Academie der Mal-, Bild- und Baukunst&quot; (Academy of the Art of Painting, Pictorial Art, and Architecture), the later Prussian Academy of Arts, at the behest of Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg. The two predecessor organisations were &quot;Königliche Akademische Hochschule für ausübende Tonkunst&quot; (Royal Academy of Musical Performing Art) established in 1869 under Joseph Joachim, which also had adopted the tradition of the famous Stern Conservatory, and the &quot;Berlin State School of Fine Arts&quot; founded in 1875.

In 1975, both art schools merged under the name &quot;Hochschule der Künste Berlin, HdK&quot;. The organization received the title of a university on 1 November 2001.

==Exchange program==
The exchange program with UDK is a direct enrollment program offered during the fall, spring, and academic year to students interested in the arts and with four semesters of German language study. Each academic year the school receives 100 exchange students on the basis of institutional agreements. Students participating in the exchange are required to subsidize their own accommodations with little help from the school.

==Art fair==
Annually, the university opens its doors to the public in its four colleges (UdK Rundgang), offering one of the most important art fairs in Berlin due to new proposals that highlight its young artists.

<text>Isaac Van Zandt (July 10, 1813 – October 11, 1847) was a political leader in the Republic of Texas. Van Zandt County, Texas, was named in his honor.

==Early life==
Van Zandt was born on July 10, 1813, in Franklin County, Tennessee, to Jacob and Mary Isaacs Van Zandt. The Van Zandt family had migrated to America from the Netherlands prior to the American Revolutionary War.

==Career==
Van Zandt went into a joint business venture with his father by opening a store. Van Zandt later moved to Coffeeville, Mississippi, where he opened his own store. After experiencing financial difficulties after the depression of 1837, Van Zandt became interested in a debate society which enabled him to use his natural talent for public speaking. This spurred an interest in law and within a year he was a member of the Mississippi bar.

Van Zandt came to the Republic of Texas in 1838 and settled in Elysian Fields in what was then Panola County. In 1839 he moved to what is now Marshall, Texas.

Van Zandt was the representative of Harrison County in the House of Representatives of the Republic of Texas from 1840 until 1842, when Sam Houston appointed him Republic of Texas Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in Washington, D.C. In 1841 Van Zandt donated land, along with Peter Whetestone, to create a county seat for Harrison County. Van Zandt named the new city in honor of the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court John Marshall. As the Republic of Texas ambassador to the United States Van Zandt was instrumental in crafting the Annexation Treaty of the Republic of Texas to the U.S.

Van Zandt returned to Texas in 1845 to serve as a delegate to the Texas state constitutional convention.

==Personal life, death and legacy==
Van Zandt married Frances Lipscomb in 1833.

Van Zandt died during a yellow fever epidemic in Houston while campaigning for governor in 1847. The Van Zandt family donated their plantation as the site for the College of Marshall (now East Texas Baptist University) in 1912. In 1936, a memorial was constructed in Canton, the seat of Van Zandt County. Van Zandt was the father of Texas politician and businessman K. M. Van Zandt, and his sister Ida Van Zandt Jarvis, a generous benefactor and the first female trustee of Texas Christian University (TCU). Isaac was also the 2x great grandfather of Meredith Attwell Baker, and the 3x great grandfather of country music songwriter and performer Townes Van Zandt.

<doc id="323268" wikidata="Q168245" url="?curid=323268" title="Umm al-Fahm">
<text>Umm al-Fahm ( , &quot;Umm al-Faḥm&quot;; &quot;Um el-Faḥem&quot;) is a city located northwest of Jenin in the Haifa District of Israel. In its population was , nearly all of whom are Arab citizens of Israel. The city is situated on the Umm al-Fahm mountain ridge, the highest point of which is Mount Iskander ( above sea level), overlooking Wadi Ara. Umm al-Fahm is the social, cultural and economic center for residents of the Wadi Ara and Triangle regions.

==Etymology==
Umm al-Fahm literally means &quot;Mother of Charcoal&quot; in Arabic. According to local lore, the village was surrounded by forests which were used to produce charcoal.

==History==
Several archaeological sites around the city date to the Iron Age II, as well as the Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, early Muslim and the Middle Ages.

===Mamluk era===
In 1265 C.E. (663 H.), after Baybars won the territory from the Crusaders, the revenues from Umm al-Fahm were given to the Mamluk &quot;na&#x27;ib al-saltana&quot; (viceroy) of Syria, Jamal al-Din al-Najibi.

===Ottoman era===
In 1517 the village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Umm al-Fahm belonged to the Turabay Emirate (1517-1683), which encompassed also the Jezreel Valley, Haifa, Jenin, Beit She&#x27;an Valley, northern Jabal Nablus, Bilad al-Ruha/Ramot Menashe, and the northern part of the Sharon plain. In 1596 Umm al-Fahm appeared in the tax registers as being in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Sara of the &quot;Liwa&quot; of Lajjun. It had a population of 24 households, all Muslim, and paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, occasional revenues, goats and/or beehives, and a press for olive oil or grape syrup.

Describing the social fabric of the villages, scholars noted thatUmm al-Fahm’s rise to regional ascendancy began with the migration and settlement of the Hebron Aghbariyya, Mahamid, and Jabarin clans from Bayt Jibrin during the late 18th –early 19th centuries. This population movement formed part of a significant wave of migration from Jabal al-Khalil (Hebron highlands) to the area of Jenin [...] The Mahajina, came to Umm al-Fahm from [the] Galilee, completing the village’s fundamental partition into four quarters (hārāt/hamāyil), each with their own headmen, guesthouses and allotments in the village’s common land (mushā‘). The Khalīlīs brought with them a new, ‘bunched settlement pattern’, involving a main settlement surrounded by satellite villages, hamlets, and farms for grazing and agriculture next to water sources and ancient ruins.During the 19th century, Umm al-Fahm became the heart of the so-called &quot;Fahmawi Commonwealth&quot; - a network of communities connected by family, economic and political ties. The Commonwealth dominated sections of Bilad al-Ruha/Ramot Menashe, Wadi &#x27;Ara and Marj Ibn &#x27;Amir/Jezreel Valley during that time.

In 1838, Edward Robinson recorded Umm al-Fahm on his travels, and again in 1852, when he noted that there were 20 to 30 Christian families in the village. The Christian families of Umm al-Fahm owned large tracts of land in Umm al-Fahm as well as watermills at Lajjun.

In 1870, Victor Guérin found it had 1800 inhabitants and was surrounded by beautiful gardens. In 1870/1871 (1288 AH), an Ottoman census listed the village in the &quot;nahiya&quot; of Shafa al-Gharby.

In 1872, Charles Tyrwhitt-Drake noted that Umm al-Fahm was &quot;divided into four-quarters, El Jebarin, El Mahamin, El Maj’ahineh, and El Akbar’iyeh, each of which has its own sheikh.&quot;

In 1883, the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s Survey of Western Palestine described Umm al-Fahm as having around 500 inhabitants, of which some 80 people were Christians. The place was well-built of stone, and the villagers were described as being very rich in cattle, goats and horses. It was the most important place in the area besides Jenin. The village was divided into four-quarters, &quot;el Jebarin&quot;, &quot;el Mahamin&quot;, &quot;el Mejahineh&quot;, and &quot;el Akbariyeh&quot;, each quarter having its own sheikh. A maqam for a Sheikh Iskander was noted on a hill above; Conder and Kitchener wrote that the village&#x27;s Qadi said Sheikh Iskander was a king of the children of Israel, while others saw it as a maqam dedicated for Alexander the Great.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Umm al-Fahm had a population of 2,191; 2,183 Muslims and 8 Christians, increasing in the 1931 census to 2443; 2427 Muslim and 16 Christians, in 488 inhabited houses.

Umm al-Fahm was the birthplace of Palestinian Arab rebel leader Yusuf Hamdan. He died there in 1939 during a firefight with British troops.

In the 1945 Village Statistics the population was estimated together with other Arab villages from the Wadi Ara region, the first two of which are today part of Umm al-Fahm, namely Aqqada, Ein Ibrahim, Khirbat el Buweishat, al-Murtafi&#x27;a, Lajjun, Mu&#x27;awiya, Musheirifa and Musmus. The total population was 5,490; 5,430 Muslims and 60 Christians, with 77,242 dunams of land, according to the official land and population survey. 4332 dunams were used for plantations and irrigable land, 44,586 dunams for cereals, while 128 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

In addition to agriculture, residents practiced animal husbandry which formed was an important source of income for the town. In 1943, they owned 574 heads of cattle, 318 sheep over a year old, 2081 goats over a year old, 25 camels, 94 horses, 10 mules, 316 donkeys, 5565 fowls, and 1060 pigeons.

===State of Israel===
In 1948, there were 4,500 inhabitants, mostly farmers, in the Umm al-Fahm area. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Lausanne Conference of 1949 awarded the entire Little Triangle to Israel, which wanted it for security purposes. On 20 May 1949, the city&#x27;s leader signed an oath of allegiance to the State of Israel. Following its absorption into Israel, the town&#x27;s population grew rapidly &quot;(see box)&quot;. By 1960, Umm al-Fahm was given local council status by the Israeli government. Between 1965 and 1985, it was governed by elected councils. In 1985, Umm al-Fahm was granted official city status.

In October 2010, a group of 30 right-wing activists led by supporters of the banned Kach movement clashed with protesters in Umm al-Fahm. Many policemen and protesters were injured in the fray.

==Local government==
The growing influence of fundamentalist Islam has been noted by several scholars.

Since the 1990s, the municipality has been run by the Northern Islamic Movement. Ex-mayor Sheikh Raed Salah was arrested in 2003 on charges of raising millions of dollars for Hamas. He was freed after two years in prison. Sheikh Hashem Abd al-Rahman was elected mayor in 2003. He was replaced in November 2008 by Khaled Aghbariyya.

Because of its proximity to the border of the West Bank, the city is named very often as a possible candidate for a land-swap in a peace treaty with the Palestinians to compensate them for land used by Jewish settlements. In a survey of Umm al-Fahm residents conducted by and published in the Israeli-Arab weekly &quot;Kul Al-Arab&quot; in July 2000, 83% of respondents opposed the idea of transferring their city to Palestinian Authority jurisdiction. The proposal by Avigdor Lieberman for a population exchange was rejected by Israeli Arab politicians as ethnic cleansing.

==Economy==
Since the establishment of Israel, Umm al-Fahm has gone from being a village to an urban center that serves as a hub for the surrounding villages. Most breadwinners make their living in the building sector. The remainder work mostly in clerical or self-employed jobs, though a few small factories have been built over the years. According to CBS, there were 5,843 salaried workers and 1,089 self-employed in 2000. The mean monthly wage in 2000 for a salaried worker was NIS 2,855, a real change of 3.4% over the course of 2000. Salaried males had a mean monthly wage of NIS 3,192 (a real change of 4.6%) versus NIS 1,466 for females (a real change of −12.6%). The mean income for the self-employed was 4,885. 488 residents received unemployment benefits and 4,949 received an income guarantee. In 2007, the city had an unofficial 31 percent poverty rate.

Haat Delivery is a food-delivery start-up based in Umm al-Fahm. The service was launched in 2020 and handles tens of thousands of orders a month.

==Education==
According to CBS, there are a total of 17 schools and 9,106 students in the city: 15 elementary and 4 junior high-schools for more than 5,400 elementary school students, and 7 high schools for more than 3,800 high school students. In 2001, 50.4% of 12th grade students received a Bagrut matriculation certificate.

==Arts and culture==

The Umm al-Fahm Art Gallery was established in 1996 as a venue for contemporary art exhibitions and a home for original Arab and Palestinian art.

<text>Alexander Travis Hawthorn (January 10, 1825May 31, 1899) was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded infantry in the Western and Trans-Mississippi theaters of the American Civil War. After the war, in company with a party of friends, he traveled extensively in Brazil as the guest of the imperial government, the policy of the government being to encourage immigration from the Southern States. In 1880, he was ordained a minister of the Baptist Church.

==Early life and education==
Alexander Travis Hawthorn was born in Conecuh County, Alabama, on January 10, 1825, and was educated at Evergreen Academy and Mercer University. He then studied law at Yale University, from 1846 to 1847, relocating to Camden, Arkansas, where he commenced the practice of law.

==American Civil War==
When the 6th Arkansas Infantry Regiment was organized in 1861, Hawthorn was elected lieutenant colonel and then, the following spring, was appointed its colonel. He was wounded at Shiloh and, in 1863, took a gallant part in the assault on Hindman Hill during the attack on Helena. During the Spring 1864 Red River Campaign and Battle of Jenkins&#x27; Ferry, he commanded the 4th Arkansas Infantry Brigade of the 1st Arkansas Infantry Division. Meanwhile, Hawthorn had been promoted brigadier general to date from February 18, 1863. He remained with the division until May 1865.

==Later life==
Hawthorn traveled to Brazil in 1867, but returned in 1874 and engaged in business in New Orleans. Six years later he entered the Baptist ministry and was ordained, after which he lived in Texas until his death on May 31, 1899, at Dallas. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery at Marshall, Texas.

<text>Ofakim () is a city in the Southern District of Israel, 20 kilometers (12.4 mi) west of Beersheba. It achieved municipal status in 1955. It has an area of 10,000 dunams (~3.9 sq mi; 10 km2). In , it had a population of .

Ofakim was established as a development town in 1955. For many years it was a major textile manufacturing center until outsourcing led to the closure of factories. As a result, Ofakim suffered from poverty and unemployment. Since the 2000s, new businesses have opened, improving the economic outlook.

In 2023, Ofakim was attacked by Hamas militants who infiltrated the city and killed 47 residents.

==History==
Prior to 1948, the area was known as Khirbat Futais (), a Bedouin hamlet populated by members of Al-Qadirat clan of Al-Tiyaha tribe, located along &quot;Wadi Futeis&quot;, a seasonal river that drains into Wadi Gaza. The hamlet consisted of several mud houses. The Bedouins grew wheat, barley, and melon, and tended flocks of sheep and goats. The hamlet was located along Beersheba-Gaza highway, which was considered a strategic location. In the wake of inter-tribal clashes between Bedouin tribes, the Ottomans built a military fort nearby, known as the &quot;Patish (Futais) fort&quot;.

By mid-July, during the 1948 War (Operation An-Far), the hamlet fell to the IDF. The Bedouin families living there fled to Al-Muharraqa, and from there they were expelled to Gaza Strip. According to Benny Morris, the abandoned hamlet was destroyed in September or October 1948 for military reasons.

Ofakim was established in 1955 on the site as an urban center for rural communities in the south. 

The first inhabitants were immigrants from Morocco and Tunisia. The population in 1955 was about 600. The immigrants were housed in huts and tin shacks until the construction of permanent housing. In the city&#x27;s early years, the construction industry was the main source of income. 

In late 1956, after the expulsion of Jews from Egypt following the Suez Crisis, 150 Egyptian-Jewish families, some of them Karaite Jews, settled in Ofakim. In the following years, 170 Jewish families from Iran arrived, along with immigrants from India and Romania. In 1958, Ofakim was granted local council status.

In the late 1950s, the construction industry was still the main employer, and some residents also worked in agriculture nearby, but industry also began to be established in Ofakim, starting with a diamond polishing plant, followed by two textile factories that opened in 1959. At the same time, the town&#x27;s streets were paved, public parks were established, and schools were founded. In 1961, the population was 4,600.

As in other development towns, the industrial sector historically played an important part in Ofakim&#x27;s economy. In 1972, 32% of the salaried workers (754 people) were in this sector, and in 1983—924 people (23%). During this period, the textile industry grew to dominate Ofakim&#x27;s economy. Numerous textile plants were set up, and the industry employed by far the most workers, ranging from 72% (1982–83) to 82% (1972). The Of–Ar (short for Ofakim–Argentina) textile factory was a major employer. In 1983, the population had grown to 12,600.

Ofakim&#x27;s economy declined after Israeli textile manufacturers began closing their factories in Israel to move their production to other countries with lower labor costs, mainly in Southwest Asia, and to Egypt and Jordan after Israel signed peace treaties with those two countries. Starting in the mid-1980s, the city&#x27;s textile mills began to shut down, with the last one closing in 1995, rendering much of the population unemployed. In the early 1990s, during the mass migration of Jews from the former Soviet Union to Israel, more than 7,000 Soviet immigrants arrived in Ofakim, and were provided with heavily subsidized housing. This fueled further competition for jobs, and due to the fact that Soviet immigrants were typically better educated than the mainly unskilled or semi-skilled veteran population, they were better able to get the few jobs available. The city also absorbed immigrants from Ethiopia during this time. A few more plants moved into the city in the 1990s, including an electronics factory in 1996, but unemployment remained high. Ofakim gained a reputation as an economically depressed city in Israel.

In 1997, it had the highest unemployment rate in Israel, at 15.3%. It also had the highest unemployment rate in 2004, at slightly over 14%. In 2008, &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported: &quot;Nearly one-third of the inhabitants are supported by the welfare department and hundreds of families receive aid, including food, from non-profit organizations. Many of the inhabitants in their 50s and 60s have been dreaming of fleeing Ofakim since they were 20. When they retire, they leave.&quot;

In the 2007, the Israeli Interior Ministry dismissed Ofakim mayor Avi Asaraf and his entire city council from their posts for failing to implement a recovery plan for Ofakim. Zvika Greengold became the new mayor.

Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Ofakim gradually saw improvements in its economy. Tax incentives were given to open new factories in Ofakim, and a branch of MATI, an organization that supports small businesses, was opened. The high-tech industry also entered Ofakim. The city is currently undergoing a series of major development projects.

Ofakim was infiltrated by Hamas forces on 7 October during the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. The subsequent Battle of Ofakim saw police, armed residents, and off-duty soldiers battle the militants before IDF reinforcements arrived. The city was declared as cleared early the following morning. A total of 47 
residents of the city were killed in fighting in the city as well as elsewhere in southern Israel. In Ofakim 27 residents and including six police were killed in the fighting.

== Demographics ==

In 2010, about one-fifth of the residents were ultra-Orthodox and one third were immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Most of the rest were members and descendants of the founding generation of the immigrants who arrived in the town in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, there are small communities of Ethiopian Jews and Palestinians originally from the Gaza Strip who were resettled in Israel after collaborating with Israeli authorities.

According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Ofakim had a population of 30,662 in 2019, and the population is growing at a rate of 1.4% a year. The percentage of the share of the Arab Palestinian population of Ofakim is very small and about 0.7%.

==Economy ==

In 2013, about 40% of Ofakim&#x27;s residents worked in the city. There were about 20 factories in Ofakim on 2,000 dunams of land. Some residents also work in high-tech.

== Education ==
In 2001, there were 21 schools and 4,704 students in the city – 13 elementary schools (3,079 students), and 8 high schools (1,625 students). 43.3% of 12th grade students were entitled to a matriculation certificate.

==Sports==
One of Israel&#x27;s 14 tennis centers is located in Ofakim. It opened in 1990 and has six courts. The city also has a soccer stadium. The Nahal Shomriya cycling route around Ofakim was inaugurated in 2010. The 60-centimeter-wide single route winds through 1,500 dunams (approx 375 acres) in Ofakim Forest, passing through Nahal Shomriya and Nahal Patish, and looping around eight local moshavim.

== Transportation ==

Ofakim is accessible by Highway 25 and Route 241. Ofakim is connected to the Trans-Israel Highway via Highway 264. 

The Ashkelon–Beersheba railway, a new railway line which connected Ofakim with Tel Aviv and Beersheba, was inaugurated in August 2015, which finally connected the railway line between Ashkelon and Beersheba. The Ofakim railway station was opened on December 31, 2015. The rail line connects Ofakim to Beersheba in the Southeast, and to Ashkelon and beyond to Greater Tel Aviv in the Northwest.

Ben Gurion Airport, the closest major international airport, is located about 101km North from Ofakim, which can be accessed via a drive along the Trans-Israel Highway.

==Urban development plans==

The city has begun to develop from 2015 onward after years of stagnation. Thousands of new housing units, commercial and employment centers, and a youth center which included a cinema were built. Ofakim Railway Station was completed in December 2015 with a car park for 1,000 cars. Next to the train station, a new neighborhood specially designed to have affordable prices for young people, is being built as part of the &quot;Noah Initiative&quot;, which was started by activists from Tel Aviv.

In 2017, a new agreement was signed to build 14,436 housing units in four new neighborhoods and one established neighborhood, which will greatly increase the city&#x27;s population. In addition, the agreement stipulated the development of an industrial zone in southern Ofakim, increased funding for infrastructure and urban renewal projects, and the construction of a new road between Ofakim and Ramon Airport. The plan aims to double the city&#x27;s population. High-rise construction of buildings up to 13 stories is also planned.

<text>The was the invasion of northern Kyūshū by Jurchen pirates in 1019.

==History==
At the time, Toi (, &quot;Doe&quot;) meant &quot;barbarian&quot; in the Korean language. The Toi pirates sailed with about 50 ships from direction of Goryeo, then assaulted Tsushima and Iki, starting 27 March 1019. After the Iki Island garrison consisting of 147 soldiers led by Fujiwara Noritada was wiped out, the Jurchen pirates slaughtered all the Japanese men while seizing Japanese women as prisoners. Fujiwara Noritada, the Japanese governor was killed. 

After that, they raided Chikuzen Province&#x27;s Ido, Shima, and Sawara counties, and on April 9, they raided Hakata. For a week, using in the Hakata Bay as a base, they sacked villages and kidnapped over 1000 Japanese, mostly women and young girls, for use as slaves. The Dazaifu, the administrative center of Kyūshū, then raised an army and successfully drove the pirates away. 

After that, they then raided Matsuura County, Hizen Province from April 13 to May 20, and were eventually repelled by Genchi, the founder of the &quot;Matsuura 48 Parties&quot;, and after attacking Tsushima again, they retreated towards the Korean Peninsula.

A few months later, the Goryeo delegate Jeong Jaryang () reported that the Goryeo navy had intercepted the pirates off of Wonsan and eliminated them. They rescued around 300 Japanese captives. Under Korean captivity &quot;they were provided white clothes and fed meals with silverware&quot;. The Korean government then repatriated them back to Japan where they were thanked by the Dazaifu and given rewards. There remain detailed reports by two captive women, Kura no Iwame and Tajihi no Akomi, with Kura no Iwame&#x27;s report being copied down.

The Japanese children and women kidnapped by the Jurchens were mostly likely forced to become prostitutes and sex slaves. Only 270 or 259 Japanese on 8 ships were returned when Goryeo managed to intercept them. 1280 Japanese were taken prisoner, 374 Japanese were killed and 380 Japanese-owned livestock were killed for food.

These Jurchen pirates lived in what is today Hamgyŏngdo, North Korea.

Traumatic memories of the Jurchen raids on Japan, the Mongol invasions of Japan in addition to Japan viewing the Jurchens as &quot;Tatar&quot; &quot;barbarians&quot; after copying China&#x27;s barbarian-civilized distinction, may have played a role in Japan&#x27;s antagonistic views against Manchus and hostility towards them in later centuries such as when the Tokugawa Ieyasu viewed the unification of Manchu tribes as a threat to Japan. The Japanese mistakenly thought that Hokkaido (Ezochi) had a land bridge to Tartary (Orankai) where Manchus lived and thought the Manchus could invade Japan. In 1627, The Tokugawa shogunate sent a message to Joseon via Tsushima offering help to Joseon against the Later Jin invasion of Joseon. Joseon refused it.

<text>Or Yehuda () is a city in the Tel Aviv District of Israel. Located in the Gush Dan metropolitan area, in it had a population of .

==History==
===Prehistory===
Human settlement back to the Chalcolithic has been found on the site.

===Antiquity and Bible===
Or Yehuda is located on the site of the biblical town of Ono. The name was used by Canaanites and then by Israelites as well (), all throughout the First and Second Temple periods. Jewish classical writings mention the city as being formerly enclosed by a wall.

===Ottoman period===
The built-up area of two Muslim Arab villages, Kafr &#x27;Ana in the east and Saqiya to the west, are located within the current Or Yehuda city limits. Both villages date back to at least the 16th century, when Suleiman the Magnificent&#x27;s &quot;haseki sultan&quot;, Roxelana aka Hürrem Sultan, endowed them to her Jerusalem soup kitchen. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the area belonged to the &quot;nahiyeh&quot; (sub-district) of Lydda that encompassed the area of the present-day city of Modi&#x27;in-Maccabim-Re&#x27;ut in the south to the present-day city of El&#x27;ad in the north, and from the foothills in the east, through the Lod Valley to the outskirts of Jaffa in the west. This area was home to thousands of inhabitants in about 20 villages, who had at their disposal tens of thousands of hectares of prime agricultural land.

===British Mandate===
In the 1931 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Kafr &#x27;Ana had a population of 1,824 Muslims in 449 houses and Saqiya 663 Muslim inhabitants in 142 houses.

====1948 war====
In the end of April 1948, the Haganah launched military operation Hametz, which aimed to conquer several villages inland from Jaffa to isolate it from the Arab hinterland. The fate awaiting the inhabitants was not made explicit, other than stating the inhabitants would be allowed to leave, but a general order envisaged &#x27;cleansing the area&#x27; () and the villages of Kafr &#x27;Ana and Saqiya were depopulated.

===State of Israel===
====Temporary accommodation (1949-1955)====
In 1949, immigrants from Libya and Turkey settled in the ruins buildings of the villages of Saqiya and Kafr &#x27;Ana, which did not have water or sewage infrastructure.

In 1950–1953, the &quot;ma&#x27;abarot&quot; (provisional settlements for immigrants) Saqiya A, Saqiya B, Kafr &#x27;Ana A, and Kafr &#x27;Ana B were established on the previous village lands. These &quot;ma&#x27;abarot&quot; housed mainly immigrants from Iraq who arrived as part of Operation Ezra and Nehemiah. &quot;Ma&#x27;abarot&quot; at the time were treated by authorities as temporary accommodations until permanent resettlement could occur on-site or elsewhere. Attempts to induce neighboring Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan to extend their municipal borders to cover these &quot;ma&#x27;abarot&quot; failed, and the &quot;ma&#x27;abarot&quot; residents resisted relocation to development towns in the north and south. In 1952, the religious settlement of Ramat Pinkas (also known as Givat Hemed and Givat Mordechi) was established for some of the &quot;ma&#x27;abarot&quot; residents.

====Or Yehuda (est. 1955)====

The modern town of Or Yehuda was officially established by the State of Israel in 1955 and was named after Judah Alkalai. In 1962 Or Yehuda was recognized as a municipal planning authority, which led to increased development. In 1988, Or Yehuda was declared a city, due to the increase in the number of residents.

In April 2001, Hamas suicide bombers blew up a car in Or Yehuda, injuring eight people.
In 2008, the Ef&#x27;al Regional Council was liquidated, and lands belonging to the council south of route 461, including Ramat Pinkas, were annexed to Or Yehuda.

== Demographics ==
According to the CBS, in 2001 the ethnic makeup of the city was 100.0% Jewish. In 2001 there were 13,900 males and 14,000 females. The population of the city was spread out, with 34.6% 19 years of age or younger, 17.7% between 20 and 29, 20.5% between 30 and 44, 15.8% from 45 to 59, 3.1% from 60 to 64, and 8.2% 65 years of age or older. The population growth rate in 2001 was 3.4%.

<doc id="323279" wikidata="Q932025" url="?curid=323279" title="Guadalajara International Airport">
<text>Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla Guadalajara International Airport , simply known as Guadalajara International Airport, is the primary international airport serving Guadalajara, Jalisco, the third-largest city in Mexico. It facilitates flights to and from destinations across Mexico, the Americas, and Europe. It is the largest hub for Volaris, functioning as the airline&#x27;s primary gateway to the United States. Additionally, it serves as a hub for Aeromexico and Viva. Operated by Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico (GAP), the airport is named after Miguel Hidalgo, a prominent leader in the Mexican War of Independence.

The airport is the third-largest in Mexico based on aircraft operations and cargo flights, providing services to countries in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Additionally, the airport supports various tourism initiatives, flight training programs, and general aviation activities. In terms of passenger traffic, Guadalajara Airport ranks third in Mexico, following Mexico City and Cancún. It stands as the ninth busiest in Latin America and the 39th busiest in North America. It handled 17,848,700 passengers in 2024, a slight 0.78% increase from previous year.

==History==

=== Early operations ===
The Guadalajara Airport was inaugurated on March 1, 1951, featuring two asphalt runways, an apron, and a small passenger terminal. The opening ceremony was officiated by President Miguel Alemán Valdés.

Guadalajara Airport has undergone significant expansions since its early days. In 1966, operations were briefly suspended due to safety concerns raised by the Technical Commission of the Mexican Pilots Association (). Urgent repairs were carried out, with airlines temporarily redirected to the Zapopan Air Force Base. The renovation efforts included enlarging the original runway 10/28. By 1968, the runway was reconstructed and extended to , coinciding with the reconstruction of the airport&#x27;s passenger building.

The airport was reinaugurated as the new Miguel Hidalgo International Airport. This transformation allowed it to accommodate wide-body aircraft and was executed largely using existing infrastructure, with the old runway, apron, and building repurposed for general aviation. Throughout the following years, the airport underwent further transformations. In 1973, runways, taxiways, aprons, passenger buildings, parking lots, a control tower, and fuel storage areas were completely renovated or newly constructed. Technological enhancements, such as jetbridges, high-intensity lights, visual approach slope indicator (VASI) and runway end identifier lights (REIL), were implemented to ensure operational efficiency and safety.

=== Hub operations ===
In the 1980s, Mexicana, a key player in the country&#x27;s aviation industry, began a decentralization effort to address congestion at Mexico City International Airport. Guadalajara, alongside airports like Monterrey and Mérida, played a pivotal role in accommodating additional routes and frequencies to alleviate pressure on the capital&#x27;s airport. As part of this initiative, a Maintenance Base was inaugurated in 1988. This facility had the capacity to service ten Boeing 727-200 aircraft and two DC-10s, constituting a significant portion (approximately 23%) of the airline&#x27;s fleet. Until Mexicana&#x27;s bankruptcy, the airport served as a hub for the airline, functioning as one of its gateways to the United States.

On May 24, 1993, the airport parking lot became the site of a tragic firefight between the Logan Heights Gang, associated with the Tijuana Cartel, and the Sinaloa Cartel. This confrontation resulted in seven fatalities, including Catholic Archbishop Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo. 

In 1994, expansion and adaptation projects were funded by Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA), leading to significant improvements in the passenger terminal and departures concourse. The apron was extended, and two taxiways were added. A transformative year came in 1995 with the publication of the &#x27;Ley de Aeropuertos&#x27; (Airports Law) by the Department of Communications and Transportation (), marking the inception of Mexico&#x27;s airport privatization program. In 1999, Guadalajara Airport joined Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico (GAP), a consortium headquartered in Guadalajara.

The airport served as a hub for Aero California from its establishment in 1960 until its bankruptcy in 2006. In the 2000s, it also served as the primary hub for the now-defunct regional airline ALMA and was a secondary hub for Aeromar. In 2010, Volaris commenced service to Guadalajara, absorbing routes from the defunct Aerocalifornia and Mexicana. This marked the establishment of what is now Volaris&#x27; largest hub.
=== Expansion challenges and local concerns ===
In 2020, Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico announced a substantial investment of 14 billion pesos in Guadalajara Airport. This funding was dedicated to essential developments, including the construction of a new runway located on the northern side of the airport, converting the terminal and other buildings into midfield facilities. Other developments include improved terminal access, an expanded parking lot, a hotel, an office complex, and a solar power plant. The comprehensive expansion project is slated for completion by 2024.

Despite the promising vision, expansion initiatives have faced setbacks due to conflicts with residents. Protests have disrupted parking lot access, leading to a reevaluation of the construction timeline. Residents argue that Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico holds debts for the land, originally expropriated in 1975 for airport expansion. This contested terrain, spanning the airport&#x27;s polygon and an additional , designates for the second runway. The ongoing dispute has prompted Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico to appeal to the Department of Communications and Transportation, resulting in a temporary postponement of the second runway&#x27;s construction. Successful completion of these expansions is anticipated to substantially boost the airport&#x27;s capacity, accommodating over 40 million passengers. In the absence of fruitful negotiations, the potential for another expropriation remains an option to advance the project.

In December 2021, Guadalajara Airport achieved a significant milestone with the introduction of Aeroméxico&#x27;s nonstop flights to Madrid, operated by a Boeing 787. This marked the airport&#x27;s inaugural direct connection to Europe.

== Facilities ==

The airport is located in the municipality of Tlajomulco de Zúñiga, approximately southeast of Downtown Guadalajara. Situated within built-up areas of the Metropolitan zone, the airport is situated at an elevation above sea level, featuring three asphalt runways: Runway 11R/29L measuring , Runway 02/20 measuring , and Runway 11L/29R .

=== Passenger Terminal ===
The airport&#x27;s single terminal spans an area of and is currently undergoing renovations. Operating as a two-story facility, the terminal facilitates domestic and international flights. The ground floor encompasses arrival amenities, including baggage claim carousels, domestic check-in sections, and a commercial corridor housing snack kiosks, banks, souvenir shops, and car rental services. The upper floor features security checkpoints and a departures area extending , housing food courts, restaurants, and 43 gates distributed across four concourses:

* Concourse A: Airside Walk-up gates A1 - A8
* Concourse B: Jetbridge gates B10 - B13
* Concourse C: Jetbridge gates C30 - C37
* Concourse D: Ground Floor, Bus gates D40 - D50 

Various VIP lounges, such as the Aeroméxico Salón Premier, Citibanamex Salón Beyond, VIP Lounge East, and VIP Lounge West, are available within the passenger terminal. Additionally, nearby hotel services include City Express Guadalajara Aeropuerto, Hampton Inn by Hilton Guadalajara-Aeropuerto, and Hangar Inn.

=== Other facilities ===
Air Force Station No. 1 () (E.A.M. 1) is situated on the airport grounds. Adjacent facilities encompass a maintenance base for Volaris, Aeromexico, an FBO terminal, a general aviation apron with several hangars, and a cargo terminal, recently expanded to store approximately 350,000 tons of goods annually within its 27,000 square metres (290,000 sq ft). The cargo terminal features six positions capable of handling various wide-body aircraft.

The crash killed all 45 people on board, and two prominent American scientists – oceanographer Townsend Cromwell and fisheries scientist Bell M. Shimada – were among the dead. It was the deadliest aviation accident in Mexican history at the time.
* On August 31, 1986, Aeroméxico Flight 498, a DC-9 originating from Mexico City made several stopovers at Guadalajara, Loreto and Tijuana. Collided with a private aircraft while attempting to land at Los Angeles International Airport leaving no survivors.
* On May 24, 1993, Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo, the Archbishop of Guadalajara, and six other people were killed in a shootout between rival drug cartels in the airport parking lot.
* On September 16, 1998, Continental Airlines Flight 475, a Boeing 737-500 registered N20643 departed Houston–Intercontinental at 20:56 CDT for an IFR flight to Guadalajara. After executing a missed approach on their first ILS approach to Runway 28, the flight was vectored for a second approach to Runway 28. Second approach was reported by both pilots to be uneventful, the aircraft drifted to the left side of the runway after touchdown. Left main landing gear exited the hard surface of the runway approximately 2700 feet from the threshold and eventually, all 3 landing gears exited the 197-foot wide asphalt runway while the aircraft had substantial damages and was declared damaged beyond repair, all passengers survived.

<text>Baqa al-Gharbiyye (, ; lit. &quot;Western Baqa&quot;) is a predominantly Arab city in the &quot;Triangle&quot; region of Israel near the Green Line. In 2003, Baqa al-Gharbiyye united with the Jatt local council to form Baqa-Jatt, a unification that was dissolved a few years later. The city had a population of in .

==History==
Pottery remains from the Intermediate Bronze Age, Iron Age II and Hellenistic era have been found here.

===Roman, Byzantine and Umayyad eras===
An olive press, quarries and a winepress believed to date to the Hellenistic or Early Roman period have been found. Ceramic objects from the late Roman or early Byzantine periods have also been found, and a burial cave, with remains dating to Byzantine and the beginning of the Umayyad periods (sixth–seventh centuries CE).

===Crusader/Mamluk eras===
In 1265 Sultan Baibars divided the village between the emirs &quot;&#x27;Ala&#x27; al-Din Taibars al-Zahiri&quot; and &quot;Ala&#x27; al-Din &#x27;Ali al-Tunkuzi&quot; when the villages of Palestine were divided up between those who fought against the Crusaders.

===Ottoman era===
In 1517 the village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Baqa belonged to the Turabay Emirate (1517-1683), which encompassed also the Jezreel Valley, Haifa, Jenin, Beit She&#x27;an Valley, northern Jabal Nablus, Bilad al-Ruha/Ramot Menashe, and the northern part of the Sharon plain. Baqa was mentioned in an Ottoman document in 1538, as a five-family small village with 11 non-married people. In 1596, Baqa al-Gharbiyye appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Jabal Shami, part of the Sanjak of Nablus. It had a population of 5 Muslim households who paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on wheat, barley, summer crops, goats or beehives, and a press for olives or grapes; a total of 12,000 akçe. Half of the revenue went to the waqf of &quot;al-Haramayn as-Sarifayn&quot;.

In 1838 it was noted as a village, &quot;Bakah, the west&quot;, in the western &quot;Esh-Sha&#x27;rawiyeh&quot; administrative region, north of Nablus.

In 1870, the French explorer Victor Guérin described the village as built on a low hill with wells and cisterns that looked ancient. He estimated the population to be 1500. In 1871 (1288 AH), an Ottoman census listed the village in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (sub-district) of al-Sha&#x27;rawiyya al-Sharqiyya.

In 1882 the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described Baqa al-Gharbiyye as a village of moderate size that stood out in the landscape with a few olive trees and orchards to the south.

===British Mandate===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Baqa Gharbiyeh had a population of 1,443; 1442 Muslim and one Anglican Christian. In the 1931 census of Palestine, Baqa was recorded as having a population of 1,640 Muslims living in 403 houses. These numbers included the nearby smaller locality El Manshiya. During the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine the village was under strict British martial law and collective punishment was imposed on villages where militants were found.

On 25 August 1938 a clash took place in Baka in which British officers were killed and three villagers were wounded. 
The next day, the British ordered the inhabitants to leave, taking nothing with them. Most of the homes destroyed. The villagers were forced to walk to the Nur al-Shams Camp near Tulkarm. The next day the villagers returned to find the village in ruins. This was one of the largest British attacks on a Palestinian village during the revolt. Members of the older generation say men, women and children threw stones and rocks at the camp to free those who were arrested. 

In the 1945 statistics the population of Baqa al-Gharbiyye (including &quot;Manshiyat Baqa&quot;) consisted of 2,240 Muslims with a total land area of 21,116 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 861 dunams were designated for plantations and irrigable land, 18,986 for cereals, while 76 dunams were built-up (urban) areas.

===Israel===

In the early years of Israeli independence, Baqa al-Gharbiyye was one of the headquarters of the Israeli military administration. The land holdings of the town, which had been 21,116 dunams in 1945, were reduced to 8,228 dunams by 1962, mostly due to expropriation in 1953–1954. In 1963, the Baka canning plant went into partnership with Priman, an Israeli company that relocated to Baqa al-Gharibiyye.

In 1996, Baqa al-Gharbiyye was declared a city. In 2003 it was merged with the nearby town Jatt, becoming Baqa-Jatt.

Baqa al-Gharbiyye is separated from its West Bank sister city, Baqa ash-Sharqiyya (or &quot;Baqa East&quot;), by the Israeli West Bank barrier which in this section coincides with the Green Line. As a result, a concrete wall topped with barbed wire runs through one neighbourhood.

As the Israeli foreign minister in April and June 2008, Tzipi Livni raised the possibility of territorial exchange with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. She proposed transferring Israeli Arab communities, among them Baqa al-Gharbiyeh, to the Palestinian side of the border. The Palestinians rejected the proposal.

== Demographics ==

In 2019, the official population was 29.000. Together with Jatt (11,000) the estimated population is 40,000. The ethnic makeup of the city is entirely Muslim Arab Palestinian. The city is made up of 51% males and 49% females. Baqa has a population growth rate of 3.1%. The population of the city is spread out, with 48.6% 19 years of age or younger, 18.4% between 20 and 29, 18.9% between 30 and 44, 9.5% from 45 to 59, 1.8% from 60 to 64, and 2.8% 65 years of age or older.

Baqa al-Gharbiyye was settled in the 18th century by migrants from Allar amid conflicts with Jit settlers. Today, its residents have diverse backgrounds, including families with roots tracing back to Egypt and Persia.

== Education and culture ==

According to CBS, 47.8% of 12th grade students were entitled to a matriculation certificate in 2001. There are 6 elementary school, two junior-high schools and two high school, in addition to a private school. In addition to the official education institutions, Baqa has a wide range of private educational institutions which provide services to the city residents as well as people from the whole region. In addition, The Al-Rahma School () in the city provides Special education for the city and the surrounding towns and villages.

The Al-Qasemi Academic College of Education is open to students from around the country, and has a combined Arab and Jewish faculty. The college is part of the Al-Qasemi group which aims to establish high-standard education through private schools, a library and centers for extra-curricular education.

== Economy ==
Baqa al-Gharbiyye is considered a commercial and industrial center for nearby towns, villages and kibbutzim. There are over 400 workshops in Baqa. Industrial zones make up 8.5% of city&#x27;s area.

==Environmental issues==
In 2007, the mayors of Baqa al-Gharbiyya and Baqa ash-Sharqiyya signed an agreement to clean up Wadi Abu Nar, a polluted stream that runs through both villages. The mayors also committed to protecting the mountain aquifer, the most important underground water source for Israelis and Palestinians, by establishing an authorized sewage grid-system. Baqa al-Gharbiyya agreed to connect the town&#x27;s sewage treatment plant with a waste disposal network in Baqa al Sharkiya.

<text>Great and Little Hampden is a civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, about three miles south-east of Princes Risborough. It incorporates the villages of Great Hampden and Little Hampden, and the hamlets of Green Hailey and Hampden Row. Great Hampden is the ancestral home of the Hobart-Hampden family, the most famous of whom was the English Civil War protagonist John Hampden.

==History==
The villages were first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, when they were jointly called &quot;Hamdena&quot; after the owners of the local manor.

By the 14th century &#x27;Hamdena&#x27; was split into the two villages, Great Hampden at the top of one hill and Little Hampden on the next hill, with the lush arable land forming the rest of the two parishes spread out in the valley between them. It was also at about this time that Hampden House, the house belonging to the Hobart-Hampden family was rebuilt.

After the death of John Hampden, a cross was erected just above the lane that leads from Hampden House to the nearby village of Prestwood. Where the cross stands is reputed to be the spot where John Hampden stood when he first refused to pay the Ship Money tax in 1636. However the nearby village of Great Kimble also claims to be the place where he refused to pay the tax. From the cross there is a view of the Chiltern Hills.
Hampden himself is buried at the church in Great Hampden, in an unmarked grave. His first wife had a stone tablet in her honour erected in the chancel. In the 19th century the floor below this tablet was lifted and a body exhumed which was missing its hand and had had its shoulder dislocated. Due to the nature of Hampden&#x27;s death at the Battle of Chalgrove Field near Thame (he died as a result of an injury to his arm and shoulder) this was assumed to be the body of Hampden himself; however this assumption has since been challenged by other historians.

Great Hampden church stands a mile or so from the village. Its isolation made it an attractive location for some scenes in the 1970 film Cromwell. In more modern times Hampden House was used extensively by the Hammer film studios as the perfect gothic backdrop for many of their films.

The nave of Little Hampden Church was built in the 13th Century and a distinctive half timbered porch was added in the 15th century. There are 13th century wall paintings of saints inside that were discovered in 1907, however they are incomplete due to a major rebuild of the chancel in 1859. Opposite the church is Manor Farm which is white plastered.

<doc id="323286" wikidata="Q152368" url="?curid=323286" title="Beit She'an">
<text>Beit She&#x27;an ( &#x27;), alsoBeth-shean, formerlyBeisan(&#x27;), is a town in the Northern District of Israel. The town lies at the Beit She&#x27;an Valley about 120 m (394 feet) below sea level.

Beit She&#x27;an is believed to be one of the oldest cities in the region. It has played an important role in history due to its geographical location at the junction of the Jordan River Valley and the Jezreel Valley. Beth She&#x27;an&#x27;s ancient tell contains remains beginning in the Chalcolithic period. When Canaan came under Imperial Egyptian rule in the Late Bronze Age, Beth She&#x27;an served as a major Egyptian administrative center. The city came under Israelite rule in the monarchic period. It probably fell under Philistine control during the time of Saul, when, according to the Bible, his body was displayed there along with his sons.

During the Hellenistic period, the settlement was known as Scythopolis (Ancient Greek: &quot;Σκυθόπολις&quot;). After the region came under Roman rule, Scythopolis gained imperial free status and was the leading city of the Decapolis. A multi-cultural metropolis under Byzantine rule, it served as the capital of the province of Palaestina Secunda, and had a mixed population of Christians, pagans, Jews and Samaritans. After the Arab conquest of the Levant, and following a series of devastating earthquakes (most notably in 749), the city lost its prominence, and became a medium-sized country town.

The population of the town was completely changed from 1948 to 1950. It had been entirely Muslim and Christian, designated to be part of the Jewish state in the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, and was captured by the Haganah in May 1948. The battle over the town during Operation Gideon caused most of its inhabitants to flee, and the remainder were expelled. The town was then resettled by Jewish immigrants. Today, Beit She&#x27;an serves as a regional centre for the towns in the Beit She&#x27;an Valley. The ancient city ruins are now protected within the Beit She&#x27;an National Park. The town is located near the Jordan River Crossing, one of three crossing points between Israel and Jordan.

==Geography==

Beit She&#x27;an&#x27;s location has always been strategically significant, due to its position at the junction of the Jordan River Valley and the Jezreel Valley, essentially controlling access from Jordan and the inland to the coast, as well as from Jerusalem and Jericho to the Galilee.

Beit She&#x27;an is situated on Highway 90, the north–south road which runs the length of the eastern edge of Israel and the West Bank. The city stretches over an area of 7 square kilometers with a substantial national park in the north of the city. Beit She&#x27;an has a population of 20,000.

Today the town is under the administration of the Emek HaMa&#x27;ayanot Regional Council.

==Climate==
Beit She&#x27;an has a hot semi-arid climate, with mild, rainy winters and very hot, dry summers. Beit She&#x27;an is one of the hottest cities in Israel, due to its location in Beit She&#x27;an valley, which is part of the Jordan Valley. The annual precipitation is 305 mm, which make it the driest city in Northern Israel. The cause of the relative aridity is the location in the rain shadow of the Samaria mountains and Mount Gilboa, which blocks some of the rain from reaching the area.

==History==
===Prehistory (Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods)===
In 1933, archaeologist G.M. FitzGerald, under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania Museum, carried out a &quot;deep cut&quot; on Tell el-Hisn (&quot;castle hill&quot;), the large tell, or mound, of Beth She&#x27;an, in order to determine the earliest occupation of the site. His results suggest that settlement began in the Late Neolithic or Early Chalcolithic periods (sixth to fifth millennia BC.) Occupation continued intermittently throughout the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, with a likely gap during the Late Chalcolithic period (ca. 4000–3300 BC).

===Early Bronze Age===
Settlement seems to have resumed at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age I (3200–3000) and continues throughout this period, is then missing during the Early Bronze Age II, and then resumes in the Early Bronze Age III.

===Middle Bronze Age===
A large cemetery on the northern mound was in use from the Bronze Age to Byzantine times. Canaanite graves dating from 2000 to 1600 BC were discovered there in 1926.

===Late Bronze Age===
====Egyptian period====
After the conquest of Beit She&#x27;an by Pharaoh Thutmose III in the 15th century BCE, as recorded in an inscription at Karnak, the small town on the summit of the mound became the center of the Egyptian administration of the region. The Egyptian newcomers changed the organization of the town and left a great deal of material culture behind. A large Canaanite temple ( in length) excavated by the University of Pennsylvania Museum (Penn Museum) may date from about the same period as Thutmose III&#x27;s conquest, though the Hebrew University excavations suggest that it dates to a later period. Artifacts of potential cultic significance were found around the temple. Based on an Egyptian stele found at the place, the temple was dedicated to the god Mekal. The Hebrew University excavations determined that this temple was built on the site of an earlier one.
One of the most important finds near the temple is the Lion and Lioness (or a dog) stela, currently in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, which depicts the two playing.

During the three hundred years of rule by the New Kingdom of Egypt, the population of Beit She&#x27;an appears to have been primarily Egyptian administrative officials and military personnel. The town was completely rebuilt, following a new layout, during the 19th dynasty. The Penn Museum excavations uncovered two important stelae from the period of Seti I and a monument of Ramesses II. One of those steles is particularly interesting because, according to William F. Albright, it testifies to the presence of a Hebrew population: the Habiru, which Seti I protected from an Asiatic tribe. Pottery was produced locally, but some was made to mimic Egyptian forms. Other Canaanite goods existed alongside Egyptian imports, or locally made Egyptian-style objects. The 20th Dynasty saw the construction of large administrative buildings in Beit She&#x27;an, including &quot;Building 1500&quot;, a small palace for the Egyptian governor. During the 20th Dynasty, invasions of the &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; upset Egypt&#x27;s control over the Eastern Mediterranean. Though the exact circumstances are unclear, the entire site of Beit She&#x27;an was destroyed by fire around 1150 BC. The Egyptians did not attempt to rebuild their administrative center and finally lost control of the region.

Over 50 clay anthropoid coffins were found at the site mainly from the 13th and 12th
centuries BC. Most are in the typical Egyptian style but some are of a &quot;grotesque&quot; type linked to the Aegean which caused earlier archaeologists to suggest they were of the &quot;sea peoples&quot; which pharaoh Ramses III claimed to have resettled in the region.

===Iron Age===
An Iron Age I (1200–1000 BC) Canaanite city was constructed on the site of the Egyptian center shortly after its destruction. According to the Hebrew Bible, around 1000 BC the town became part of the larger Israelite kingdom. 1 Kings () refers to Beit She&#x27;an as part of the kingdom of Solomon, though the historical accuracy of this list is debated. Nevertheless, recent archaeomagnetic dates suggest that the first Israelite urban settlement was established either during the Solomonic period or in the pre-Omride phase of the early kingdom of Israel at the latest, and that it was probably destroyed around 935–900 BC.

The Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel under Tiglath-Pileser III (732 BC) brought about the destruction of Beit She&#x27;an by fire.

Minimal reoccupation occurred until the Hellenistic period.

====Biblical narrative====
The Hebrew Bible identifies Beit She&#x27;an as where the bodies of King Saul and three of his sons were hung by the Philistines after the Battle of Gilboa. According to the biblical narrative, the battle was fought at Mount Gilboa, around the year 1010 BC. The Philistines prevailed and Saul died in battle together with three of his sons, Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchishua, (1 Samuel and 1 Chronicles, ). states that &quot;the victorious Philistines hung the body of King Saul on the walls of Beit She&#x27;an&quot;. Later, the people of Jabesh-Gilead took the remnants, carried them into their city, and burned them. No archeological evidence was found of a Philistine occupation of Beit She&#x27;an, but it is possible the force only passed there.

===Hellenistic period===
The Hellenistic period saw the reoccupation of the site of Beit She&#x27;an under the new name &quot;Scythopolis&quot; (Ancient Greek: Σκυθόπολις), meaning &quot;City of the Scythians&quot;, possibly named after the Scythian mercenaries who settled there as veterans.

Little is known about the Hellenistic city, but during the 3rd century BCE a large temple was constructed on the tell. It is unknown which deity was worshipped there, but the temple continued to be used during Roman times. Graves dating from the Hellenistic period are simple, singular rock-cut tombs. From 301 to 198 BCE the area was under the control of the Ptolemies, and Beit She&#x27;an is mentioned in 3rd–2nd century BCE written sources describing the Syrian Wars between the Ptolemaic and Seleucid dynasties. In 198 BCE the Seleucids finally conquered the region.

===Roman period===
In 63 BCE, Pompey made Judea a part of the Roman Republic. Beit She&#x27;an was refounded and rebuilt by Gabinius. The town center shifted from the summit of the mound, or tell, to its slopes. Scythopolis prospered and became the leading city of the Decapolis, the only one west of the Jordan River.

The city flourished under the &quot;Pax Romana&quot;, as evidenced by high-level urban planning and extensive construction, including the best preserved Roman theatre of ancient Samaria, as well as a hippodrome, a cardo and other trademarks of the Roman influence. Mount Gilboa, away, provided dark basalt blocks, as well as water (via an aqueduct) to the town. Beit She&#x27;an is said to have sided with the Romans during the early phase of the First Jewish–Roman War in 66 CE. Excavations have focused less on the Roman period ruins, so not much is known about this period. The Penn. University Museum excavation of the northern cemetery, however, did uncover significant finds. The Roman period tombs are of the &quot;loculus&quot; type: a rectangular rock-cut spacious chamber with smaller chambers (&quot;loculi&quot;) cut into its side. Bodies were placed directly in the &quot;loculi&quot;, or inside sarcophagi which were placed in the &quot;loculi&quot;. A sarcophagus with an inscription identifying its occupant in Greek as &quot;Antiochus, the son of Phallion&quot;, may have held the cousin of Herod the Great. One of the most interesting Roman grave finds was a bronze incense shovel with the handle in the form of an animal leg, or hoof, now in the University of Pennsylvania Museum.

===Byzantine period===
Copious archaeological remains were found dating to the Byzantine Empire (330–636) and were excavated by the Penn Museum from 1921 to 1923. A rotunda church was constructed on top of the tell, and a wall enclosed the entire city. Textual sources mention several other churches in the town. Scythopolis was primarily Christian, as attested to by many churches, but evidence of Jewish habitation and a Samaritan synagogue indicate established communities of these minorities. The pagan temples in the city center went out of use, but the nymphaeum and the thermae were restored, and a Sigma-shaped complex was added. Many of the buildings of Scythopolis were damaged in the 363 Galilee earthquake. In 409, Syria Palaestina was divided and Scythopolis became the capital of the northern region of Palaestina Secunda. and the See of Scythopolis was the Metropolitan archdiocese.

Dedicatory inscriptions indicate a preference for donations to religious buildings. Many colourful mosaics were preserved, such as that featuring the zodiac in the Lady Mary&#x27;s Monastery, or the one with a temple menorah and the phrase &quot;shalom&quot; in the House of Leontius synagogue. The Samaritan synagogue&#x27;s mosaic was unique in its aniconic abstention from human or animal images, instead using floral and geometrical motifs. Elaborate decorations were also found in the settlement&#x27;s many luxurious villas, and in the 6th century especially, the city reached its maximum size of 40,000 and spread beyond its period city walls.

The Byzantine-era portion of the northern cemetery was excavated in 1926. The tombs from this period consisted of small rock-cut halls with vaulted graves on three sides. A great variety of objects were found in the tombs, including terracotta figurines possibly depicting the Virgin and Child, many terracotta lamps, glass mirrors, bells, tools, knives, finger rings, iron keys, glass beads, bone hairpins, and many other items.

Influential Christian personalities who lived or passed through Scythopolis are Procopius of Scythopolis (died July 7, 303), Cyril of Scythopolis (ca. 525–559), Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 310/320–403) and Joseph of Tiberias (c. 285 – c. 356) who met there around the year 355.

===Early Muslim period===

In 634, Byzantine forces were defeated by the Rashidun army under the Rashid caliph Umar, and the city reverted to its Semitic name, being named Baysan in Arabic. The day of victory came to be known in Arabic as &quot;Yawm Baysan&quot; &quot;day of Baysan.&quot; The city was not damaged; newly arrived Muslims lived alongside the Christian population until the 8th century. The town formed one of the districts of Jund al-Urdunn, itself a part of the Bilad al-Sham, until the Crusades.

The city declined; structures were built in the streets, narrowing them to mere alleys, and makeshift shops were opened among the colonnades. The city reached a low point in the 8th century, witnessed by the removal of marble for producing lime, the blocking off of the main street, and the conversion of a main plaza into a cemetery.

However, some recently discovered counter-evidence may be offered to this picture of decline. In common with state-directed building work carried out in other towns and cities in the region during the 720s, Baysan&#x27;s commercial infrastructure was refurbished: its main colonnaded market street, once thought to date to the sixth century, is now known—based on a mosaic inscription—to be a redesign dating from the time of the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–43). Al-Bakri of al-Andalus noted that the wine produced there was delicious.

On January 18, 749, Umayyad Baysan was devastated by a catastrophic earthquake. A few residential neighborhoods grew among the ruins, probably established by the survivors, but the city never recovered its magnificence. The city center moved to the southern hill, where the Crusaders later built a castle.

Jerusalemite historian al-Muqaddasi visited Baysan in 985, during the Abbasid Caliphate and wrote that it was &quot;on the river, with plentiful palm trees, and water, though somewhat heavy (brackish.)&quot; He further noted that Baysan was notable for its indigo, rice, dates, and grape syrup known as &quot;dibs&quot;. Its principal mosque was situated in the center of its marketplace.

===Crusader period===
In the Crusader period, the Lordship of Bessan was occupied by Tancred, Prince of Galilee in 1099; it was never part of the Principality of Galilee, despite its location, but became a royal domain of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1101, probably until around 1120. According to the Lignages d&#x27;Outremer, the first Crusader lord of Bessan once it became part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem was Adam, a younger son of Robert III de Béthune, peer of Flanders and head of the House of Béthune. His descendants were known by the family name &quot;de Bessan&quot;.

It occasionally passed back under royal control until new lords were created. The town became part of the Belvoir fiefdom.

A small Crusader fortress surrounded by a moat was built in the area southeast of the Roman theatre, where the diminished town had relocated after the 749 earthquake. The fortress was destroyed by Saladin in 1183.

During the 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut, retreating Mongol forces passed near but did not enter the town.

===Mamluk period===
Under Mamluk rule, Beit She&#x27;an was the principal town in the district of Damascus and a relay station for the postal service between Damascus and Cairo. It was also the capital of sugar cane processing for the region. Jisr al-Maqtu&#x27;a, &quot;the truncated/cut-off bridge&quot;, a bridge consisting of a single arch spanning and hung above a stream, was built during that period.

===Ottoman period===
During this period, the inhabitants of Baysan were mainly Muslim, but there were some Jews. The 14th century topographer Ishtori Haparchi settled there and completed his work &quot;Bulb and Flower&quot; () in 1322, the first Hebrew book on the geography of the Land of Israel.

During the 400 years of Ottoman rule, Baysan lost its regional importance. During the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II when the Jezreel Valley railway, which was part of the Haifa to Damascus extension of the Hejaz railway was constructed, a limited revival took place. The local peasant population was largely impoverished by the Ottoman feudal land system, which leased tracts of land to tenants and collected taxes from them for their use.

The Swiss–German traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt described Beisan in 1812: &quot;The present village of Bysan contains seventy or eighty houses; its inhabitants are in a miserable condition, from being exposed to the depredations of the Bedouins of the Ghor, to whom they also pay a heavy tribute.&quot;

In 1870/1871, an Ottoman census listed the village in the nahiya (sub-district) of Shafa al-Shamali.

In the early 20th century, though still a tiny and obscure village, Beisan was known for its plentiful water supply, fertile soil, and producing olives, grapes, figs, almonds, apricots, and apples.

===British Mandate period===
Under the Mandate, the city was the center of the District of Baysan. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Beit She&#x27;an (Baisan) had a population of 1,941, consisting of 1,687 Muslims, 41 Jews and 213 Christians.

In 1934, Lawrence of Arabia noted that &quot;Bisan is now a purely Arab village,&quot; where &quot;very fine views of the river can be had from the housetops.&quot; He further noted that &quot;many nomad and Bedouin encampments, distinguished by their black tents, were scattered about the riverine plain, their flocks and herds grazing round them.&quot; Beisan was home to a mainly Mizrahi Jewish community of 95 until 1936, when the 1936–1939 Arab revolt saw Beisan serve as a center of Arab attacks on Jews in Palestine. In 1938, after learning of the murder of his close friend and Jewish leader Haim Sturmann, Orde Wingate led his men on an offensive in the Arab section of Baysan, the rebels’ suspected base.

According to population surveys conducted in British Mandate Palestine, Beisan consisted of 5,080 Muslim Arabs out of a population of 5,540 (92% of the population), with the remainder being listed as Christians. In 1945, the surrounding District of Baysan consisted of 16,660 Muslims (67%), 7,590 Jews (30%), and 680 Christians (3%); and Arabs owned 44% of land, Jews owned 34%, and 22% constituted public lands. The 1947 UN Partition Plan allocated Beisan and most of its district to the proposed Jewish state.

===1948 Palestine war===
Jewish forces and local Bedouins first clashed during the 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine in February and March 1948, part of Operation Gideon, itself part of Plan Dalet. Joseph Weitz, a leading Yishuv figure, wrote in his diary on May 4, 1948, that, &quot;The Beit Shean Valley is the gate for our state in the Galilee...[I]ts clearing is the need of the hour.&quot;

Beisan, then an Arab village, fell to the Jewish militias three days before the end of the Mandate. After Israel&#x27;s Declaration of Independence in May 1948, during intense shelling by Syrian border units, followed by the recapture of the valley by the Haganah, the Arab inhabitants fled across the Jordan River. The property and buildings abandoned after the conflict were then held by the State of Israel. Most Arab Christians relocated to Nazareth.

Historian Saleh Abdel Jawad writes that Beisan experienced a massacre via aerial bombardment by Israeli forces that was &quot;entirely without military justification&quot; and which was used as &quot;a tool of expulsion&quot;.

===State of Israel===
A ma&#x27;abarah (refugee camp) inhabited mainly by North African Jewish refugees was erected in Beit She&#x27;an, and it later became a development town.

From 1969, Beit She&#x27;an was a target for Katyusha rockets and mortar attacks from Jordan. In the 1974 Beit She&#x27;an attack, militants of the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, took over an apartment building and murdered a family of four.

In 1999, Beit She&#x27;an was incorporated as a city. Geographically, it lies in the middle of the Emek HaMaayanot Regional Council, formerly the Beit She&#x27;an Valley Regional Council.

Beit She&#x27;an was the hometown and political power base of David Levy, an Israeli politician.

During the Second Intifada, in the 2002 Beit She&#x27;an attack, six Israelis were killed and over 30 were injured by two Palestinian militants, who opened fire and threw grenades at a polling station in the center of Bet She&#x27;an where party members were voting in the Likud primary.

==Archaeology and tourism==

The University of Pennsylvania carried out excavations of ancient Beit She&#x27;an in 1921–1933. Relics from the Egyptian period were discovered, most of them now exhibited in the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. Some are in the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia. Excavations at the site were resumed by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1983 and then again from 1989 to 1996 under the direction of Amihai Mazar. The excavations have revealed no less than 18 successive ancient towns. Ancient Beit She&#x27;an, one of the most spectacular Roman and Byzantine sites in Israel, is a major tourist attraction. The seventh century Mosaic of Rehob was discovered by farmers of Kibbutz Ein HaNetziv. Part of a mosaic floor, it contains details of Jewish religious laws concerning tithes and the Sabbatical Year.

== Earthquakes ==
Beit She&#x27;an is located above the Dead Sea Transform (a fault system that forms the transform boundary between the African Plate to the west and the Arabian Plate to the east) and is one of the cities in Israel most at risk to earthquakes (along with Safed, Tiberias, Kiryat Shmona and Eilat). Historically, the city was destroyed in the Golan earthquake of 749.

== Demographics ==
According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the population of the municipality was at the end of . In 2005, the ethnic makeup of the city was 99.5% Jewish and other non-Arab (97.3% Jewish), with no significant Arab population. See Population groups in Israel. The population breakdown by gender was 8,200 males and 8,100 females.

The age distribution was as follows:
== Economy ==

Beit She&#x27;an is a center of cotton-growing, and many of residents are employed in the cotton fields of the surrounding kibbutzim. Other local industries include a textile mill and clothing factory.

When the ancient city of Beit She&#x27;an was opened to the public in the 1990s and turned into a national park, tourism became a major sector of the economy.

== Transportation ==

Beit She&#x27;an had a railway station that opened in 1904 on the Jezreel Valley railway which was an extension of the Hejaz railway. This station closed together with the rest of the Jezreel Valley railway in 1948.

In 2011–2016 the valley railway was rebuilt and the new Beit She&#x27;an railway station, located at the same site as the historical station was opened. Passenger service offered at the station connects the city to Afula, Haifa and destinations in between. In addition to passenger service, the station also includes a freight rail terminal.

== Sports ==
The local football club, Hapoel Beit She&#x27;an spent several seasons in the top division in the 1990s, but folded in 2006 after several relegations. Maccabi Beit She&#x27;an currently plays in Liga Bet.

<text>Beit Shemesh () is a city located approximately west of Jerusalem in Israel&#x27;s Jerusalem District. A center of Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodoxy, Beit Shemesh has a population of 170,683 as of 2024.

The city is named after and located near the remains of ancient Beth Shemesh, a biblical city in the territory of Judah. Its ruins can be found today at the archaeological site of Tel Beit Shemesh.

==History==
===Tel Beit Shemesh===
The small archaeological tell northwest of the modern city was identified in the late 1830s as Biblical Beth Shemesh – it was known as Ain Shams – by Edward Robinson. The tel was excavated in numerous phases during the 20th century.

===Early development town years===
The area that compromised Beit Shemesh today was under Ottoman rule and later British Mandate of Palestine. The Ramat Beit Shemesh neighborhood area was the site belonging to the Arab village Bayt Nattif, which was built on remnants of an ancient Judean town, with various remnants of Jewish settlement from the time, such as a mosaic floor, wineries and other remains, especially from the period of the Hasmonean kings and earlier. This area is currently under dispute about preservation, having been the subject of a grassroots campaign. Under the proposed United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the town was slated to be part of an internationalized Jerusalem. The Palestinian Arab population of Bayt Nattif fled the village following an Israeli Air Force bombing campaign in October 1948, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Israeli forces later completely destroyed Bayt Nattif along with other Arab villages. Afterwards, the Harel Brigade drove out all Palestinian refugees they found in the area south of Bayt Nattif.

On 6 December 1950, the Hartuv displaced persons camp &quot;Ma&#x27;abarat Har-Tuv&quot; was established on the site of the current-day Moshav Naham. The first inhabitants were Jewish Bulgarian immigrants. They were joined by more Jewish immigrants from Bulgaria, Iran, Iraq, Romania, Morocco, and Kurdistan.

In 1952, the first permanent houses were built in Beit Shemesh. In its early years, Beit Shemesh came to typify the &quot;Development Town&quot; with a largely Maghrebi immigrant population. In 1977, following a writeup in Haaretz newspaper, Beit Shemesh was perceived as the main outpost for Menachem Begin&#x27;s Likud party. He promised to rehabilitate neighborhoods and when the Likud party came to power that year, investment in the city increased.

Building of a new area of Beit Shemesh called &quot;Givat Sharett&quot; commenced on the hill adjacent to, and immediately to the south of, the original part of Beit Shemesh (the original area now being colloquially referred to as &quot;Old Beit Shemesh&quot; despite continuing building there and in the rest of the city).

===21st century===
The Israel Police maintains a bomb disposal specialist unit and training center in Beit Shemesh.

The Nahala U&#x27;Menucha neighborhood, the Sheinfeld neighborhood, the Nofei Aviv neighborhood and the Migdal HaMayim neighborhood all began to be built in the early 1990s in Givat Sharret. Ramat Beit Shemesh started to be built on hills immediately south of Givat Sharett in the late 1990s, doubling the size of the city. In 2017, the Israeli government approved a master plan to build 17,000 new housing units along with zoned as new commercial space for businesses and hotels. It is expected that the city could be home to as many as 250,000 residents by 2025 and 350,000 by 2035. A new commercial center in the Ramat Beit Shemesh neighborhood is planned to be the city&#x27;s largest. In 2020, the construction of a hospital in Beit Shemesh, which will be run as a branch of Hadassah Medical Center, was approved.

==Climate==
Beit Shemesh has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), with mild, rainy winters and hot, nearly rainless summers.

==Demographics==

When the city was built in the 1950s, it was initially settled by new immigrants from Iran, Iraq, Romania, Bulgaria, Morocco, and Iraqi Kurdistan. In the 1990s, the city saw a large influx of new immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia, and English-speaking countries, turning it into a major center for immigrants from English-speaking countries (Anglo-Saxim). Considerable numbers have come from North America, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Australia. This population tends to be Orthodox, educated, and from middle-income groups. At the same time, Orthodox Jews from within Israel also began moving to the city, seeking roomier, low-cost housing.

According to a city councilor, there were no &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot; a/k Haredim groups in Beit Shemesh before the 1990s. Since then, Beit Shemesh has become increasingly religious, with a large Haredi sector, particularly in Ramat Beit Shemesh. Many synagogues and yeshivas have been built in the city. Religious communities represented in Beit Shemesh include Chabad Ger, Belz, American Modern Orthodox and American Yeshivish, French Sefardim, South African Modern Orthodox, Israeli Dati Leumi and more recently a Spanish speaking community. In 2011 Haredim made up 40% of the population. According to statistics published by the municipality, 63% of the city&#x27;s schoolchildren in 2010 were Haredim. 75% of the children entering the first grade in the 2012/2013 academic year will be registered in official Haredi institutions.

===Ramat Beit Shemesh===

Ramat Beit Shemesh is an expansion that lies directly adjacent to, and to the south of, the neighborhood of Givat Sharett in Beit Shemesh, which itself was an earlier extension of Beit Shemesh built on a hill immediately to the south of &quot;Old Beit Shemesh&quot;. Ramat Beit Shemesh is located on a hill overlooking Givat Sharett. Ramat Beit Shemesh has a large, diverse Orthodox population. Originally, it consisted of two areas: &quot;Ramat Beit Shemesh Alef&quot; and &quot;Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet&quot;. In &quot;Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet&quot;, families belonging to Eda Haredit constitute the majority. In 2002, following tensions between the Haredi and non-religious population, plans were drawn up to build another secular neighborhood, HaShachar. In 2007, Ramat Shilo, considered a subdistrict of Ramat Beit Shemesh, with both Dati Leumi and Haredi residents was built. In 2009, it was announced that a new neighborhood, &quot;Ramat Beit Shemesh Gimmel&quot;, would be built as a largely Haredi neighborhood on a large block of state-owned land bordering southern Beit Shemesh. In 2016 the Israeli Land Authority published tenders for 3,268 new apartments, to be built in the newly proposed areas of &quot;Ramat Beit Shemesh Dalet and Hey.&quot; According to plans, ultimately there are to be 8,300 new apartments in &quot;RBS Dalet&quot; alone.

===Ramat Beit Shemesh Alef===
Ramat Beit Shemesh Aleph () is a neighborhood of Beit Shemesh comprising about 25,000 people. The neighborhood has numerous parks and public areas. The newest park is Yarmut Park, the biggest in Beit Shemesh. Shopping is plentiful as well, with 4 supermarkets and a shopping area with over 130 shops. The area has a few different sections each with its own unique touch and strong points. There is the Dolev section, the Revivim section, and the Mishkenos Yaakov section.

The Dolev section contains a heterogeneous mix of native Israelis and immigrants. Religiosity varies as well from Hareidi until Masorti or Dati Leumi, with each group having its own synagogues and schools, in general. Masos/Masot Mordechai is a place where all types come together to pray at all times of the day. Points of interest in the Dolev section are the Matnas, a community center that services all types of Jews of the RBS A community, and Park Center, a mini-mall of various stores and restaurants. Streets include Dolev, Lachish, Shimshon, Timnah, Yarkon, and Yarden.

The Revivim section is lower down than Dolev. This area is populated mostly by Haredim, both Israeli and of Anglo descent, with religious levels ranging from American religious all the way to a few Yerushalmis. With the majority being Olim (immigrants to Israel), in this case primarily from the US, much of the neighborhood is connected to an American Minyan such as the Gra, Pnei Shmuel, or others. There is a big emphasis on living a Torah lifestyle which pervades the area. Streets include Revivim, Ramot, Gilo, Noam, and Achziv. (A way to remember these streets is their geographic location, from west to east, and from lower to higher on the hill. After Noam, come the GRA streets (Gilo, Ramot, Achziv), which culminate near the GRA shul.)

The Mishkenos Yaakov section is located next to the Merkaz (central shopping area). Here the population is almost exclusively Haredim, both Israelis and Chutznikim, although the Chuznikim tend to lean towards their Israeli counterparts regarding religious/cultural issues. There is an official Rav (Mara D&#x27;Asra), Rav Mordechai Goldstein (son of Rav Tuvia ztl), who is looked up to as the respected opinion regarding religious questions and community projects. Points of interest in the Mishkenos Yaakov area include Lev Eliyahu, the synagogue with the most Minyanim in all of RBSA, and the Merkaz, the shopping center more than 130 stores of all types. Streets include Sorek (lower half), Kishon, Uriah, Micha, and Shacham.

A further expansion to Ramat Beit Shemesh is the leafy suburbs of Mishkafayim located at the eastern edge of Aleph overlooking the Zanoah quarry. The area, still under development, has started to be populated. The makeup is entirely by Orthodox Jews of all strands including Chasidish, Hareidi, and Dati Leumi/Modern Orthodox. 
The area currently has 6 minyanim.

Organizations based in Ramat Beit Shemesh Aleph include:

*Hatzola Beit Shemesh – An independent organization combining first response and follow-up care of emergency medical situations.
*Kupa Shel Tzedaka – A charity organization helping needy families to rehabilitate them to self-sufficiency. (Mishkenos Yaakov has a separate organization for their needy families.)
*Ezrat Achim – A medical aid organization such as trips to the hospital, x-rays, and loan of medical equipment.
*Mishkan Adei Ad – An organization that assists needy families with the vast expenses of making weddings.
*Hakeshiva – An organization that focuses on the prevention of, and giving aiding to, teens-at-risk.

===Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet===
Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet (), situated between Beit Shemesh and Ramat Beit Shemesh Aleph, is primarily populated by Haredi Jews, of which most are Hasidic Jews of various dynasties.

===Ramat Beit Shemesh Gimmel===
Ramat Beit Shemesh Gimmel () is located just south of Ramat Beit Shemesh Aleph, overlooking the Nachal Yarmut Park. RBS Gimmel consists of two parts, Gimmel Aleph (1) officially named &quot;&quot;Kiryat Avi Ezri&quot;, and Gimmel Bet or Gimmel Shtayim (2), officially named &quot;Kiryat Ovadia&quot;&quot;.

Gimmel 1 which is heavily populated with over 3,000 apartments, developed into a thriving neighborhood in a very short time, and as of 2024 has many synagogues, stores, clinics, and schools.

Gimmel 2 is closer to the original Ramat Beit Shemesh Aleph. Neve Shamir is to its east, and to its west, is Gimmel 1. Residents first started moving into Gimmel 2 in 2020 and the neighborhood has 3 shopping centers and multiple synagogues.

Both Gimmel 1 &amp; 2 have become very appealing to the Anglo-Saxon public, though there seems to be a higher percentage of English speakers in Gimmel 1.

===Ramat Beit Shemesh Daled===
As of 2024, Ramat Beit Shemesh Daled () has become a sprawling multi sectional neighborhood. Currently there are 4 sections: RBS Daled 1,2,3 &amp; 4. While there is still a lot of construction, many buildings have been built and populated, predominately by Haredi Jews.

The plan was that a total of 8,000 homes and apartments would be built in three stages; Daled 1, Daled 2 and Daled 3. The neighborhoods of Daled 1 and Daled 2 would each comprise 3,000 apartments, and Daled 4 would have 2,000 apartments.

===Ramat Beit Shemesh Hey / Neve Shamir===
The neighborhood, under construction, was originally earmarked for the non-Haredi public and it was designed like non-Haredi neighborhood. However, being that some of the apartments were marketed as part of &quot;mechir la-mishtaken&quot; program and the tenders were won by many Haredi and Religious Zionist families, this area also seems to be turning into a religious neighborhood. The rest is being sold in the private market, with many Haredim already have purchased houses. 
According to the former mayor, Aliza Bloch, &quot;We are witnessing a group of purchasers of residents of Beit Shemesh being divided among the general public, another group outside the city, such as: Gush Etzion, Mevaseret Zion and Jerusalem, and a group of people from abroad, mainly from the US, a community-oriented population such as the Sheinfeld neighborhood. Just a year ago, I toured the US and met with many groups whose fruits are for the encounters that I see there today. In addition, we try to interest the teachers&#x27; union, such as the Ashmoreth group, where teachers and education people, the Neve Shamir neighborhood is of interest to them.&quot; In May 2020, Dozens of national and secular religious couples (hiloni and dathi leomi) took part in a tour of the Neve Shamir neighborhood with former Mayor Aliza Bloch and her deputy. Those in attendance answered current questions and information from the field. In light of the success of the reunion, more tours were held.

===Ramat Shilo===
Ramat Shilo was built in 2007 with 340 housing units geared toward Modern Orthodox Jews. Since then, the neighborhood has experienced rapid growth and development. The residents of Ramat Shilo are Orthodox Jews, both Dati Leumi and Haredi. The neighborhood has a large community of English-speaking olim. Its residents are both Ashkenazim and Sephardim.

Ramat Shilo has a number of synagogues, yeshivas and kollels. The largest institution is Yeshivat Lev Hatorah, a Religious Zionist yeshiva founded by Rabbi Boaz Mori. The local synagogues include Beis Dovid/Pilzno Beis HaMedrash, a Hasidic synagogue representing the Pilzno Hasidic dynasty under the leadership of Rabbi Yehoshua Gerzi, Mishkan Shilo, an Ashkenazi synagogue under the leadership of Rabbi Dovid Bagno, Mishkan Moshe Va&#x27;Eliyahu, a Sephardi synagogue under the leadership of Rabbi Shai Naftali, and Ohev Yisroel, a Hasidic synagogue under the leadership of Rabbi Binyomin Flintenstein of the Kapishnitzer Hassidic dynasty.

Notable residents of Ramat Shilo include:
* Rabbi Avraham Jacobovitz, founder of Machon L&#x27;Torah and Jewish Awareness America (JAAM)
* Rabbi Howard Apfel, cardiologist at Columbia University Medical Center.
* Rabbi Yehoshua Fass, founder and executive director of Nefesh B&#x27;Nefesh
Among the communal organizations is Chasdei Shilo which provides assistance for families with financial difficulties as well as serves as a communal resource network.

===Urban kibbutz &quot;Tamuz&quot;===
Beit Shemesh also has an urban kibbutz affiliated with the Kibbutz Movement, Tamuz, founded in 1987.

==Local government==
Bet Shemesh has a heavy Haredi majority, the current mayor of Beit Shemesh is Shmuel Greenberg. He assumed office in March 2024 after a second round of elections.

The previous mayor of Beit Shemesh was Aliza Bloch.

Formerly a Likud stronghold, in the 2006 Knesset elections United Torah Judaism became the city&#x27;s strongest party, with 22.2 percent of the votes and Shas getting 19.9 percent. In 2009 Likud regained its primacy, obtaining 22.2 percent of the votes, and Shas also gained, garnering 20.9 percent, with United Torah Judaism a close third at 20.6 percent. Eda Haredit boycott the elections.

During the municipal elections held on 22 October 2013, acting on several anonymous tips, police raided several private residences and recovered 200 ID cards and disguising materials such as hats, glasses and wigs which law enforcement suspected were used or going to be used for fraudulent voting. Additionally, eight people were arrested on suspicion for engaging and coordinating fraudulent voting activities.

On 10 December 2013, a three-judge panel of the Jerusalem District Court nullified the results of the October municipal elections due to voter fraud and ordered a new election.

Following an unprecedented 76% voter turnout rate, incumbent mayor Moshe Abutbul beat contender Eli Cohen with a 51% majority vote during the reelection which took place on 11 March 2014.

Beit Shemesh has two industrial zones containing mainly small industry, particularly in the Northern industrial zone which is typified by carpentry and metalwork workshops, garages and wholesale and retail outlets. The Western industrial zone contains several larger companies including Beit Shemesh Engines Ltd. (BSEL) which manufactures and repairs jet engines and jet engine components, Barzellan and others. Nearby in the Noham industrial zone are situated various other factories and offices. Since the high tech boom began in the 1990s, Beit Shemesh has been host to several hi-tech startups including Omek Interactive.

==Transportation==

Bus transportation within Beit Shemesh and most inter-city routes is operated by Tnufah and Beit Shemesh Express as of 2021, replacing the former Superbus, which began service on 5 January 2009. The Egged Bus Cooperative, which previously operated all bus service in and to Beit Shemesh, still operates to some distant cities but no longer operates from Beit Shemesh to Jerusalem. Nateev express operates busses to Tsfat and Netivot.

Tnufa operates the inter-city bus routes as of 2021 The travel time between Beit Shemesh and Jerusalem by bus is between 40 min and 1 hour. Transportation to Tel aviv is between an hour and an hour and fifteen minutes.

The new express lines to Jerusalem are direct with new addition such as bus line 600 and the night lines.

Beit Shemesh Express operates over 40 bus routes with over 200 eco friendly electric busses serving all areas of the city as of 2021.

Beit Shemesh Railway Station provides hourly service on the Israel Railways Herzliya–Lod–Jerusalem line. The station is located in the north industrial zone of Beit Shemesh at the Big Fashion Mall and shopping center across from Shaarei Hair Mall. It was renovated in 2003 after being in operation for close to 100 years.

It was renovated and reopened on 13 September 2003, having existed for over a century at the same location. The station has three platforms.

==Sports==
Beit Shemesh is home to numerous sports clubs all under the main sport associations (Beitar, Hapoel, and Maccabi). The city has soccer teams including juniors, seniors and over-35s teams and boasted a franchise in the Israel Baseball League. The Beit Shemesh Blue Sox represented Beit Shemesh and finished in first place nationally in the league&#x27;s only season, though they played their games at Gezer Field in Kibbutz Gezer due to a lack of proper facilities in Beit Shemesh. There is also a very active Little League in Beit Shemesh and Ramat Beit Shemesh, with over 300 members.
In the field of judo, Elitzur Beit Shemesh has won many prizes. Israel Kung Fu and world Nunchaku champion (2001) Eli Ivgi was born in and lives in Beit Shemesh.

==Arab-Israeli conflict==
Beit Shemesh was not involved in any Arab conflict since 1997. On 13 March 1997, seven 13 and 14-year-old girls from Beit Shemesh&#x27;s AMIT Fuerst School were killed at the &quot;Island of Peace&quot; site in Naharayim in Northern Israel by a Jordanian soldier while on a school class trip. They were visiting the joint Israeli and Jordanian tourist resort under Jordanian rule. King Hussein of Jordan went to Beit Shemesh a few days after the massacre to extend his condolences and ask forgiveness in the name of his country, a step which was seen as both courageous and touching.

==Transportation==
Bet Shemesh will be getting a much-needed facelift to its transportation infrastructure. In November 2024, the &quot;Accelerator&quot; project was approved at a cost of 1 billion shekels. As part of the project, bus lanes will be built, new bike paths will be paved, smart traffic lights and roundabouts will be built, and street signs and municipal signs will be upgraded. In addition, new, advanced bus stops will be built with real-time information displays and full accessibility. Work is expected to start on the project in March 2025.

The Tnufah Bus company which started service in 2022 and Express are the transportation carriers in Beit Shemesh. Previously Superbus and Egged also provided bus service.

== Communal tensions ==
As of 2024, Beit Shemesh is a thriving city with a mainly Haredi population, as well as a Dati Leumi minority. The growing pains of communal tensions of two decades ago have faded since the efforts of the last two mayors: Moshe Abutbul who now is a Knesset member and Aliza Bloch, the former mayor. Beit Shemesh is considered a religious, family-oriented city where children can walk safely and freely both day and night in all parts of the city under the current leadership of Shmuel Greenberg.

In 2004 the Israel Association of Ethiopian Jews claimed that Ethiopian Jews working for the municipality were being paid below-minimum wages. In 2011, the Association criticized the referral of Ethiopian Jews to three private pre-schools run by the mayor&#x27;s wife.

According to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, women who belong to a Haredi burqa sect in Beit Shemesh were ostracized by the Haredi community. The leader of the movement, dubbed the &quot;Taliban mother&quot; by the Israeli press, was convicted by the Jerusalem District Court in 2009 on three counts of abuse of a minor and 25 counts of assault in aggravated circumstances, and sentenced to four years in prison. Her husband was also convicted of 10 counts of assault and three counts of abuse of a minor or helpless person, and was sentenced to six months in jail.

In 2011, conflicts erupted in Beit Shemesh between extremist anti-religious activists and devout Haredi men, possibly members of a group known as the Sikrikim, and other residents of the town due to opposition to maintaining gender separation at local health clinics, and so called ‘mehadrin buses’ where men and women sit separately.

When the municipality removed a sign asking women to respect gender separation rules in a synagogue, hundreds of devout Haredim staged protests in which physical force was allegedly used against police officers and reporters. Several placards urging segregation between men and women were put back after being removed by the police.

After the opening of the Orot Banot national-religious girls&#x27; school in September 2011, situated on the border between the primarily National-Religious Sheinfeld neighborhood and the Haredi Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet, groups of devout Haredim gathered to protest in front of the school, in protest at the lack of modest dress, allegedly calling the girls names and spitting at them when they headed to and from school. Stones hurled at a boys&#x27; school belonging to the same educational network injured a boy in the leg. Two men were arrested on suspicion of throwing eggs and tomatoes at students. In a demonstration outside the school a female journalist was assaulted by young, allegedly Haredi, men who cursed and spat at her, and a clash with parents of girls studying at the school was broken up by the police force.

In December 2011, a national public outcry was raised when a television news channel interviewed 8-year-old Na&#x27;ama Margolese, who was allegedly cursed and spat at on her way to school by devout Haredim.
&quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; reported that the issue is really a property dispute over ownership of the school building. Some Haredi women distributed flowers to the girls of Orot Banot school, telling them &quot;sister to sister&quot; that they were beautiful. On 27 December 2011, a protest against extremism near the Orot Banot school drew 10,000 people. After the incidents in Beit Shemesh were reported in foreign press, the US State Department updated its Jerusalem travel advisory advising visitors to &quot;dress appropriately&quot; when visiting ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods, or to avoid them entirely.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Beit Shemesh is twinned with:
* Cocoa, Florida, United States
* Hangzhou, China
* Nordhausen, Germany
* Nottingham, England, United Kingdom
* Ramapo, New York, United States
* Split, Croatia
* Jersey City, New Jersey, United States

In the Partnership 2gether program of the Jewish Agency for Israel, Beit Shemesh and the Mateh Yehuda Regional Council are linked to South Africa and Washington, D.C.

After &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in October 2011 that Montgomery County, Maryland was considering a partnership with Beit Shemesh, a local coalition, Human Rights Matter!, objected. The campaign was supported by the Mossawa Center, an organization that defines its goal as the promotion of equality for the Arab minority in Israel but which has been criticized for its rejection of Israel as a Jewish state and its foreign funding from the European Commission, George Soros&#x27;s Open Society Institute and the New Israel Fund, among others, as well as Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire.

<text>Poynings&#x27; Law or the Statute of Drogheda (10 Hen. 7. c. 4 (I) [&quot;The Irish Statutes&quot; numbering] or 10 Hen. 7. c. 9 (I) [&quot;Analecta Hibernica&quot; numbering]; later titled &quot;An Act that no Parliament be holden in this Land until the Acts be certified into England&quot;) was a 1494 Act of the Parliament of Ireland which provided that the parliament could not meet until its proposed legislation had been approved both by Ireland&#x27;s Lord Deputy and Privy Council and by England&#x27;s monarch (the Lord of Ireland) and Privy Council. It was a major grievance in 18th-century Ireland, was amended by the Constitution of 1782, rendered moot by the Acts of Union 1800, and repealed by the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1878 (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 57).

==Background==
Poynings&#x27; Parliament was called by Sir Edward Poynings in his capacity as Lord Deputy of Ireland, appointed by King Henry VII of England in his capacity as Lord of Ireland. Coming in the aftermath of the divisive Wars of the Roses, Poynings&#x27; intention was to make Ireland once again obedient to the English monarchy. Assembling the Parliament of Ireland on 1 December 1494, he declared that it was thereafter to be placed under the authority of the Parliament of England. This marked the beginning of Tudor direct rule in Ireland, although Henry VII was still forced to rely on Old English nobles (such as Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, despite his support for Lambert Simnel) as his deputies in Ireland through the intervening years. Poynings&#x27; Law was a major rallying point for later groups seeking self-government for Ireland, particularly the Confederate Catholics in the 1640s and Henry Grattan&#x27;s Patriot Party in the late 18th century, who consistently sought a repeal of Poynings&#x27; Law. The Act remained in place until the Constitution of 1782 gave the Irish parliament legislative independence.

==Function and operation==
The working of Poynings&#x27; Law took place in several steps. The first step was for the lieutenant governor and the Irish council (or Irish executive) to decide that a parliament was needed, usually for the purpose of raising funds. At this point, the council and lieutenant would write drafts of legislation to be proposed to the king and his council. After this had been completed, the lieutenant and council, according to the act, were required to certify the request for parliament &quot;under the great seal of that land [Ireland]”, and then forward it to England for approval. Once the request arrived in England, it was reviewed by the King and his council, and a formal licence, approving the request for parliament and the draft bills were returned to Ireland. Once the licence was received in Ireland, the governor would summon parliament, and the bills passed. &quot;Government&quot; was not representative as in the modern sense and there was no sustained opposition. Parliament&#x27;s consent was necessary for some purposes, and it frequently offered advice, but the decisions were made by the English and Irish councils. This is an important fact to consider when examining exactly who the law was aimed to suppress. As the point above demonstrates, parliament was virtually a rubber stamp, and it was the Irish executive who made the actual decisions in proposing policy.

The two important aspects of the procedure presented by Poynings&#x27; Law are transmission and certification. Both of these requirements placed limits on various parties within the law-making process in Ireland. The combination of these processes created a situation where bills could be sent, along with the request for parliament, and the king could amend and remove such bills as he wished, however, he could not add new bills himself. This is a result of the certification process which requires the submission to be made by the Irish council &quot;under the great seal of that land [Ireland]&quot;. The original intention of the certification process was to remove the capacity of initiating legislation from the parliament, and place it with the Irish council and governor. But as a result of the way it was framed in the act, it also removed that capacity from the English parliament and administration as well: legislation could only be submitted for approval by the Irish executive.

Furthermore, the two processes made it impossible for the Irish to add more bills or amendments to a request after the initial licence request had been granted. This meant that any additional bills or amendments that they wished to pass in parliament would have to be re-sent along with an entirely new request for parliament. Clearly, this created severe inefficiencies in the legislative process, and thus gave the executive in Ireland as well as the crown an interest in relaxing procedure. As early as 1496 &quot;the rigid procedure laid down by Poynings&#x27; Law was not being adhered to&quot;, and additional bills were commonly sent to England after the original request and were returned to Ireland before the meeting of a new parliament. The example from 1496 was the separate request for parliamentary licence and sending of bills in the reappointment of the Earl of Kildare. At this time, because the rigid procedure of Poynings&#x27; Law was not in the interest of any of the parties involved, especially the Crown and Irish executive, Quinn argues that &quot;no hesitation was felt about transmitting additional bills&quot; after the licence had been granted.

==Changes after 1692==
After the Revolution of 1688 and the ensuing Williamite War, an important development in the Poynings&#x27; Law procedure took place in the 1692 parliament as some members of the Irish House of Commons sought to establish for themselves a more central role in the process of drafting legislature. On 27 October 1692, the House of Commons passed two notable resolutions. The first, &quot;that it was, and is, the undoubted right of the commons… to prepare and resolve the ways and means of raising money&quot; and the second, &quot;that it was, and is, the sole and undoubted right of the commons to prepare heads of bills for raising money&quot;. Opposition to the executive was then expressed as the Commons used its veto power under Poynings&#x27; Law to reject &quot;virtually two-thirds of the meticulously prepared government bills&quot;. Political deadlock ensued and parliament was prorogued. Although judicial opinion in both Ireland and England served to vindicate the position of the Lord Lieutenant and the English Government in the matter, it became clear that a compromise solution must be reached before parliament could be called again. From mid-1694, negotiations to this end began to bear fruit. The Irish parliament would pass one government money bill relating to excise at the beginning of the session in recognition of the royal prerogative. The parliament would now appoint a committee to decide upon the &quot;ways and means&quot; of raising supply and draw up the &quot;heads of bills&quot; of any related legislation. Government support of penal legislation against Catholics also helped placate the claims of the &#x27;sole right&#x27; advocates. The compromise solution was put into effect in the 1695 parliament and all fourteen government bills presented in the first session were passed by both houses. Now the Irish House of Commons had major input into the substance, or &#x27;heads&#x27;, of supply bills that would then be transmitted to the English Privy Council for approval, amendment or rejection under the Poynings&#x27; Law procedure. This set the precedent for the parliaments of the eighteenth century.

===Heads of bills===
Whereas an independent legislature can amend a bill between the time of its introduction and the time it is passed, this was not possible for the Parliament of Ireland, as only the bill originally introduced would be in compliance with the requirement under Poynings&#x27; Law to have been pre-approved by the privy councils. As a consequence, a legal fiction developed after the Revolution of 1688 whereby the Irish parliament introduced and debated the &#x27;heads&#x27; of a bill before transmitting the heads to the Irish Privy Council. In theory, the &#x27;heads&#x27; of a bill are simply its broad outline or general scheme; in practice, they were identical in form to a final bill, and processed identically, except that the enacting clause &quot;be it enacted&quot; was replaced with &quot;we pray that it may be enacted&quot;. On occasion, if either privy council amended a bill, the Irish parliament would symbolically assert its authority by rejecting the amended bill and resubmitting heads of a new bill identical to the rejected one.

==Amendment and repeal==
The Declaratory Act 1719 declared the right of the Parliament of Great Britain to make laws for Ireland and overrule judgments of the Irish House of Lords. The Declaratory Act and Poynings&#x27; Law were two major grievances of the Irish Patriot Party that were addressed by the Constitution of 1782. One element of the Constitution was Barry Yelverton&#x27;s Act, an implied amendment of Poynings&#x27; Law which removed the Irish Privy Council altogether from the legislative process and reduced the British Privy Council&#x27;s power to one of veto rather than amendment. The Acts of Union 1800 rendered most of the Constitution of 1782 and Poynings&#x27; Law moot. Poynings&#x27; Law was formally repealed as obsolete by the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1878.

<doc id="323294" wikidata="Q152578" url="?curid=323294" title="Beitar Illit">
<text>Beitar Illit (; officially Betar Illit; ) is a Haredi Jewish-Israeli settlement organized as a city council in the Gush Etzion settlement bloc, southwest of Jerusalem in the West Bank. Beitar Illit is one of Israel&#x27;s largest and most rapidly growing settlements, and in had a population of .

Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal under international law.

==Name==
Beitar Illit (lit. Upper Beitar) is named after the ancient Jewish fortress city of Betar, whose ruins (known as &quot;Khirbet el-Yahud,&quot; Arabic for &quot;Ruin of the Jews&quot;) lie away, near the Palestinian village of Battir, which preserves the ancient name.

== History ==
According to the ARIJ, Beitar Illit was established in 1985 on land which Israel had confiscated from two nearby Palestinian villages: 3,140 dunams from Husan and 1,166 dunams from Nahalin.

It was established by a small group of young families from the religious Zionist yeshiva of Machon Meir. The first residents settled in 1990. As Beitar Illit began to grow, an influx of Haredi Jewish Bobover families came to predominate, while the original group moved on. The city is now home to many Hasidic groups, including Bobov, Boston, Boyan, Breslov, Karlin-Stolin and Slonim. The city has expanded to three adjacent hills.

== Geography ==
Beitar Illit lies in the northern Judean Hills at about 700 m above sea level. It is located just west of the intersection of Route 60, the north–south artery which roughly follows the watershed from Nazareth through Jerusalem to Beersheba, and Route 375, which descends west into the Elah Valley to the coastal plain and Tel Aviv area. It takes about 10 minutes to get to Jerusalem; Tel Aviv is around 60 minutes away. Beitar Illit is connected to West Jerusalem by the Tunnels Highway, which passes directly underneath the Arab town of Beit Jala and allows access to Jerusalem without coming within view of Arabs.

==Demographics==
===Numbers===

At the end of 2003, the population was 23,000 and in 2006 it was 29,100. According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, the population in January 2007 was 35,000, an increase of 20% over one year. A Ministry of Interior report from July 2013 placed the population at 45,710.

With an annual birth rate of 1,800 births, Beitar Illit has the fastest population growth among the West Bank settlements. Approximately 63 percent of the population is under the age of 18, which is the highest percentage of children in any Israeli settlement or city.

===Character===
The population of Beitar Illit is 100% Haredi. Approximately 50% of the population is Hasidic.

An estimated 10 percent of the population is English-speaking. There are three English-speaking synagogues, two English-speaking kollels (one for retirees), and an English-speaking women&#x27;s group.

As of 2010, all incoming residents used to be screened by an acceptance committee.

== Education ==
As the population of Beitar Illit is Haredi, the schools are all Haredi schools. The city has close to 20,000 schoolchildren. Of these, approximately 6,000 are enrolled in the city&#x27;s 225 preschools and daycare centers. Elementary school-age boys attend the city&#x27;s 27 Talmud Torahs, and elementary school-age girls attend 18 elementary schools. Secondary education includes 21 yeshivas for boys and 11 high schools and post-high schools for girls. Married adult men study in 75 kollels.

== Employment ==
A significant number of men work, mostly at home or in Jerusalem. Women are employed by local business process outsourcing companies that accommodate the Haredi lifestyle, such as Greenpoint, Matrix, and CityBook. In 2010, it was reported that 64.3% of working-age men and 45.8% of working-age women in Beitar Illit were unemployed.

== Culture ==
One hundred and forty synagogues and 15 mikvehs serve the population.

== Awards ==
Beitar Illit has been awarded the Israel Ministry of Interior&#x27;s gold prize, recognizing &quot;responsible management and sustainable urban planning&quot;, for eight years running. In 2002, it received the Ministry of Interior&#x27;s prize for water conservation in public gardens, urban public institutions, and urban water administration. The municipal welfare department was awarded a prize and recognized by the national government as an &quot;outstanding department&quot; for its work in preventing teen dropouts.

The city is well known for its landscaping and general cleanliness. There are 94 parks and hundreds of playgrounds in the city. From 2000 to 2013, Beitar Illit earned five out of five stars in the Council for a Beautiful Israel&#x27;s annual &quot;Beautiful Town in a Beautiful Israel&quot; contest, which recognizes a city&#x27;s investment in environment, aesthetics, and maintenance of appearance and cleanliness. In 2005 the city won the Council for a Beautiful Israel&#x27;s &quot;Beauty Flag&quot;, which is awarded every five years.

== Status under international law ==

Like all settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, Beitar Illit is considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The international community considers Israeli settlements to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention&#x27;s prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power&#x27;s civilian population into occupied territory. The Israeli government disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the Palestinian territories as they had not been legally held by a sovereign prior to Israel taking control of them. This view has been rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

== Controversies ==
At an international conference in Karlsruhe in November 2010, Jawad Hasan claimed that sewage and urban runoff from Beitar Illit have contaminated the local hydrological system. The Palestinian Authority claims that sewage flows into neighboring Palestinian fields and orchards. Farmers from Wadi Fukin have complained that since the establishment of Beitar Illit in 1985, 11 natural wells have gone dry and they have suffered from overflow from the settlement&#x27;s backed up sewers. The Israeli government has ordered Beitar Illit to address these sewage problems.

In 2010, the Israeli interior ministry announced plans to build 112 new apartments during a visit by U.S. vice-president Joe Biden, leading to widespread news coverage that embarrassed the Israeli government.

Beitar Illit was one of four cities named in a petition to the Israeli High Court in December 2010 alleging a pattern of discrimination against Sephardi girls in the local Haredi schools. A Beitar Illit spokesman denied the charges, stating that the percentage of Sephardi girls in the school matched the percentage of Sephardim in the settlement.

<text>Future Shop was a Canadian electronics store chain. It was established in 1982 by Hassan Khosrowshahi. By 1990, the chain had become the country&#x27;s largest retailer of computer and consumer electronics. In October 2012, the company operated 149 locations across Canada.

In November 2001, Future Shop was acquired by the similar American chain Best Buy for C$580 million. Although Best Buy began to establish Canadian locations under its own name following the purchase, it continued to operate the Future Shop stores as a separate chain. Even though many of the new Best Buy locations were in close proximity to existing Future Shop stores, the two chains were differentiated primarily by their in-store experiences.

On March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the dissolution of the Future Shop brand and the closure of 66 of its locations. All remaining locations were converted to Best Buy stores.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Future Shop was founded in 1982 by Iranian entrepreneur Hassan Khosrowshahi, who left Iran to settle in Vancouver, British Columbia to start a retail business. Khosrowshahi graduated from the University of Tehran with a degree in law and economics and was a part of the family who owned the Minoo Industrial Group, a large Iran manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food products. Khosrowshahi planned to open a chain of consumer and home electronics stores and take over the Canadian retail market. His associate, Ardeshir Ziabakhsh (Ardy Zia), took the role of president and CEO of the newly formed company and Khosrowshahi served as chairman and founder. In 1983, Future Shop opened the first three stores, all of which were in British Columbia. The company sold computers, software, games, videocassettes, audio equipment, music, and other items. By December 1983, the first month all of the Future Shop stores were opened and making business, the company reached $2.8 million in sales.

By 1990, Future Shop became the largest retailer of computers and consumer electronics in Canada and was operating 38 stores across the country and some areas of the United States. In August 1993, Future Shop went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange, making $30 million to be used for expansion and to pay off debt.

By the end of 1995, Future Shop&#x27;s sales had reached more than $1 billion, with more than $38 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).

In 1997, Future Shop announced a change in management, with Ziabakhsh leaving the company. Khosrowshahi took on the roles of president and CEO, in addition to serving as chairman. Many people from company headquarters were let go during this transitional period.

===Focusing on Canadian markets===
In 1998, Future Shop purchased the Canadian division of Computer City from CompUSA, three months after the Computer City chain had been merged into CompUSA and either converted to CompUSA or closed and liquidated. During the next year, two of the Computer City retail stores were liquidated because of poor sales. In addition, the competing Adventure Electronics in Ontario and Quebec closed, leaving Future Shop as the only big-box electronics retailer in Canada.

By the end of 1998, the U.S. locations of Future Shop were performing poorly, with $53 million in losses over the last few years, and Future Shop projected another $30 million in losses would occur by the end of the next year. After major losses in sales, in March 1999, the company announced that it would close U.S. operations, holding liquidation sales and closing down in the summer. The closures left Future Shop with 81 stores across Canada. Many of the stores became part of one of its major U.S. competitors, the Best Buy chain.

In 2000, Future Shop owned 83 Future Shop stores and five Computer City stores. In June 2000, Future Shop announced plans to open flagship stores in downtown Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal.

In February 2001, Future Shop announced that the company would close and liquidate the five remaining Computer City stores because of poor sales. At the same time, Future Shop also attempted to acquire Chapters, a chain of book stores in Canada, but failed to come up with a reasonable offer.

===Best Buy buyout, new store concepts===

In March 2001, the U.S. electronics store chain Best Buy acquired Future Shop for CDN$580 million. Following the purchase, Khosrowshahi stepped down as president, but other executives from Future Shop retained their positions within the company. Best Buy continued to operate Future Shop as a separate division following the purchase, acknowledging the strength of the brand. However, in 2002, the company began to open Best Buy locations in Canada as a secondary chain.

The dual-banner strategy sought to improve the company&#x27;s Canadian market share by providing new options to consumers; the chains were differentiated primarily by their in-store experiences and promotional strategies, as Future Shop continued to use commission-based salespersons and featured home appliance selections, while Best Buy used non-commissioned salespersons and featured more interactive displays. The differences between the stores also attracted differing demographics; Future Shop&#x27;s use of haggling appealed to customers who had immigrated to Canada from countries where the practice is commonplace, while Best Buy&#x27;s relaxed atmosphere was popular among women.

Some Best Buy locations were within driving distance, or even on the same lot, as an existing Future Shop. In one case, a Best Buy was opened at the Toronto Eaton Centre at around the same time that a new Future Shop was placed across from Dundas Square. Some of the new Best Buy locations would cannibalize sales at Future Shop stores located in close proximity to them, but typically the new Best Buy would generate considerable new revenue that would more than make up for the drop in the sales of the existing Future Shop, the net result being that the two stores increased their parent&#x27;s overall market share in that area while keeping rivals out. This dual-banner strategy was effective before the mass proliferation of online-only retailers.

In an effort to widen the chain&#x27;s customer base, Future Shop began to experiment with an updated store concept at new locations in Vancouver and South Edmonton Common in 2008. The new stores featured an expanded, 53,000 square foot layout divided into four main departments. Work (computing), Play (video games, musical instruments), Living (home appliances and exercise equipment), and On the Go (mobile phones and audio products). A central hub was staffed by &quot;connectivity experts&quot;, whom customers could consult for personalized advice on technology options. In December 2011, Future Shop opened a liquidation store in Greenfield Park, Quebec.

===Demise===

On January 31, 2013, Best Buy Canada announced that it would begin to close various locations, including eight Future Shop locations effective immediately, as part of a &quot;long-term transformational strategy to optimize the company&#x27;s retail footprint across the country.&quot; The company also planned to target more resources toward its online retail operations to compete against other major vendors such as Amazon.com. These closures included locations in New Westminster, Nanaimo, Victoria, Langford, Surrey, Lachenaie, and Sherbrooke. On January 30, 2014, 950 employees of both chains were laid off. In 2014 and early 2015, other Future Shop locations were closed, including those in Boucherville, Greenfield Park, Montreal, Ottawa, Regina, Kingston, New Minas, and New Glasgow.

On March 28, 2015, Best Buy Canada announced that Future Shop would cease business effective immediately. 66 locations were permanently closed, and the remaining 65 locations were soft launched as Best Buy locations on April 4, 2015 (although still carrying Future Shop signage for the time being). In the months that followed, the locations were renovated to adopt Best Buy&#x27;s branding and store format. 

Best Buy stated that these closures and re-brandings were intended to reduce redundancy, as the closed stores were located within close proximity of a Best Buy. The closures affected 1,000 part-time and 500 full-time jobs. In turn, Best Buy Canada announced that it would invest at least $200 million over the next two years to increase staffing and add home appliance departments to all stores. Canadian Best Buy locations will honour Future Shop warranties and gift cards.

<text>Hod HaSharon () is a city in the Central District of Israel. The city is located approximately east of the Mediterranean coastline, south of Kfar Saba, southeast of Ra&#x27;anana, and northeast of Ramat HaSharon. In Hod-HaSharon had a population of and its citizens are nearly entirely Jewish.

Hod HaSharon was officially formed and made a local council in 1964 by the merging of four &quot;moshavot&quot;: Magdiel, Ramatayim, Hadar, and Ramat Hadar. The land area of Hod HaSharon is , and according to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), in the city had a population of .

==History==
Hod HaSharon is home to Tel Qana, an archeological site inhabited in the Early, Middle, and Late Bronze Ages, Iron Age I–II, and the Persian, Roman, and Byzantine periods.

A 1,300-year-old olive oil factory, of mason-worked blocks, was unearthed in Hod HaSharon. According to the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), the size of the press suggested it was meant for commercial production, rather than local or personal use.&quot;

Before the 20th century, the area of Hod HaSharon formed part of the Forest of Sharon, a hallmark of the region&#x27;s historical landscape; the landscape was an open woodland, dominated by sections of Mount Tabor oak (&quot;Quercus ithaburensis&quot;), extending from Kfar Yona in the north to Ra&#x27;anana in the south. Traditionally, the local Arab inhabitants used the area for pasture, firewood and intermittent cultivation. The intensification of settlement and agriculture on the coastal plain during the 19th century led to deforestation and subsequent environmental degradation, known from Hebrew sources.

In 1964, Hod HaSharon was created through a merger of Magdiel with &quot;Hadar Ramatayim&quot;, an administrative body which encompassed the former moshavot of Ramatayim, Hadar and Ramat Hadar. Hod Hasharon was governed by a local council until it was declared a city in April 1990.

===Magdiel===
Magdiel was founded on 2 August 1924, by a group of twelve Ashkenazi families. They received a plot of land from Yehoshua Hankin, which they cultivated and prepared for farming. Magdiel was established as a &quot;moshava&quot;, starting on 4,000 dunams of land purchased near the Arab village of Biyar &#x27;Adas. The initial population included Jewish immigrants from Russia, Poland and Lithuania, later joined by a group from the Netherlands.

===Ramatayim===

Ramatayim was founded in July 1925 by immigrants from Poland. It was founded on the principle of private initiative. Ramatayim was built on two hills connected by a valley, hence the name Ramatayim, literally &#x27;two hills&#x27;. According to a census conducted in 1931 by the British Mandate authorities, Ramatayim had a population of 180, in 31 houses. In 1949, Ramatayim became the first local council to be established in Israel.

===Hadar===
Hadar was established in 1927 by Yael Leah Eichhorn, a middle-class immigrant from Eastern Europe, who was joined soon thereafter by a group of Italian Jews. The land was purchased from the Abou Kishk Bedouin tribe. The pioneers decided to build a rural settlement founded on citrus farming (hence the village&#x27;s name, &quot;Hadar&quot;, Hebrew for &quot;citrus&quot;). In its early years, the farmers of Hadar also engaged in poultry farming. According to the 1931 census, Hadar had 71 inhabitants, all Jews, in 23 houses. In the early 1940s, Yemenite immigrants moved to Hadar, establishing the &quot;Shikun Hateymanim&quot; quarter, today part of the Gannei Tzvi neighborhood. In 1951, Ramatayim and Hadar merged to form Hadar Ramatayim. In April 1956, the boundaries of Hadar Ramatayim were extended to include the ma&#x27;abara of Ganei Tzvi, established in the end of 1948 Arab–Israeli War as &quot;Kfar Nitzahon&quot;, and renamed earlier in 1956 after Lord Harry (Tzvi) Morris of Kenwood, a major donor of the Jewish National Fund.

===Ramat Hadar===
Ramat Hadar was established in December 1938 by middle-class immigrants fleeing from Nazi Germany, members of the Fifth Aliyah. Ramat Hadar was built on a hill south of Hadar, near the main road from Petah Tikva to Ramatayim (nowadays road 402). The economy of Ramat Hadar was based on small farms, mainly poultry, as well as citrus orchards. Ramat Hadar had its own post office from 1959 til 1989. In 1963, Ramat Hadar became part of Hadar Ramatayim.

==Demographics==
In 2006, the ethnic makeup of the city was 99.9% Jewish, with no significant Arab population. The population density of Hod HaSharon is the lowest in the Sharon Plain. The population growth rate in 2006 was 3.3%. According to the CBS, , there were 18,612 salaried workers and 2,006 are self-employed in the city.

==Schools and religious institutions==
According to the CBS, there are 18 schools and 8,083 students in the city: 
12 elementary schools: The Democratic School, HaMagen, Yigal Alon, Lapid, Shilo, Mamlachti Alef, Neve Ne&#x27;eman, Rabin, Re&#x27;ut, Tali, Ha&#x27;Yarok in the name of Ariel Sharon, and Begin (4,406 students).
4 middle schools: HaRishonim, HaShachar, Atidim and Tzurim (1,628 students). A fifth middle school, HaShkimim opened in 2018.
5 high schools: Hadarim, Alexander Muss High School in Israel, Ramon, Mosenson and Na&#x27;amat (2,049 students). A sixth high school named HaShikmim was opened in 2021.
71.7% of the city&#x27;s 12th graders were entitled to a matriculation certificate in 2001.

Mosenson Youth Village accepts both Israelis and overseas students. The Alexander Muss High School in Israel, run by the Jewish National Fund (JNF), offers a program for American high school students who spend two months to a year in Israel. Each year, the senior class of the Charles E Smith Jewish Day School (located in Rockville, Maryland a suburb of Washington DC) come to The Alexander Muss High School in Israel for the second semester and approximately half of the tenth grade class from the Milken Community High School in Los Angeles, CA, come to Hod Hasharon to study for a semester along with this program.

==Transport==
Hod HaSharon is roughly bounded by Highway 531 in the north, Highway 40 in the east, Highway 5 in the south and Highway 4 in the west. Road 402 runs through the city. The city is served by two railway stations, Hod HaSharon Sokolov and Kfar Sava Nordau at its north border, right next to Highway 531. Line M1 of the Tel Aviv Metro, that is expected to be built in the 2030-s, is expected to pass through Western Hod HaSharon.

==Hod Hasharon Park==
Hod Hasharon Park is a park in southern Hod Hasharon. The park contains a hill, which was formerly used as the municipal landfill of Hod Hasharon, and is now used as a hiking and observation area of the park. From the top of the hill, one can see Hod Hasharon, the settlements of the Drom HaSharon Regional Council, Tel Aviv, Herzliya and Samaria.

Near the hill, the largest ecological lake in Israel was established, with an area of around 27,000m2. Near the lake, there is a variety of waterfowl, herons, geese, ducks and songbirds. In the water. African softshell turtles, nutria and fish of various types have been observed.

<text>Hadera (, ) is a city located in the Haifa District of Israel, in the northern Sharon region, approximately 45 kilometers (28 miles) from the major cities of Tel Aviv and Haifa. The city is located along 7 km (5 mi) of the Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain. The city&#x27;s population includes a notable community of post-Soviet and Ethiopian aliyah arrivals. In it had a population of .

Hadera was established in 1891 as a farming colony by members of the Zionist group, Hovevei Zion, from Lithuania and Latvia. By 1948, it was a regional center with a population of 11,800. In 1952, Hadera was declared a city, with jurisdiction over an area of 53,000 dunams.

==History==
===Ottoman era===

Hadera was founded on 24 January 1891, in the early days of modern Zionism by Jewish immigrants from Lithuania and Latvia on land purchased by Yehoshua Hankin, known as the Redeemer of the Valley. The land was purchased from a Christian effendi, Selim Khuri. This was the largest purchase of land in Eretz Israel by a Zionist group, although the land was of low quality and mostly swampland. The only inhabitants prior to the purchase were a few families raising water buffaloes and selling papyrus reeds. The village was named after &quot;Wadi al-Khudeira&quot; (), as the nearby section of Hadera Stream was known. Earlier, the whole Hadera Stream had been known as &quot;Nahr Akhdar&quot; ().

The Crusaders called the location &quot;Lictera&quot; – a corruption of the Arabic name, &quot;el-Khudeira&quot;. From the outset, attempts were made to pick instead a Hebrew name for the new settlement. About half a year after it was founded, rabbi Ya&#x27;akov Goldman reported on an event in &quot;the moshav of &quot;Hadere&quot;, that is, &quot;Hatzor&quot;&quot;. The name &quot;Liktera&quot; was in preferential use by the British military during World War I.

In the end of the nineteenth century, the region of Hadera was populated by three immigrant groups – Circassians, Bosnians and Russian Jews. These transnational colonists joined what was, in Roy Marom&#x27;s words, &quot;a sparsely populated coastal plain inhabited by Arabic-speaking highland peasants and nomads of Turkmen, Nubian, Egyptian and of Arabian-Peninsular descent&quot;. Marom further notes that in 1871 Ottoman authorities inspected Khirbet al-Khudeira, and found it &#x27;empty of inhabitants and lacking resident peasants who are eligible to purchase it in return for the payment of land registration fees&quot;. Selim al-Khoury, a Christian merchant from Haifa, purchased Kh. al-Khudeira, together with 3000 hectares of land, and established an agricultural estate among the ruins. In 1890, al-Khoury sold al-Khudeira to Yehoshua Hankin (1864–1945). 

Baron Edmond James de Rothschild&#x27;s surveyor, Yitzhak Goldhar, claimed that Hadera was founded on the site of the former town called &quot;Gedera of Caesarea&quot; (), as mentioned in Tosefta &quot;Shevi&#x27;it&quot;, ch. 7. Benjamin Mazar preferred to locate ancient &quot;Gador&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Gedera by Caesaria&quot;, at Tell Ahḍar (&quot;green hill&quot;), later known as Tell esh Sheikh Ziraq and currently as Tel Gador, on the coast south of Giv&#x27;at Olga. Others say that the ancient Gadera should be identified with Umm Qais or with al-Judeira.

The first Jewish settlers lived in a building known as the Khan near Hadera&#x27;s main synagogue. The population consisted of ten families and four guards. In 1896 Baron Rothschild paid for &quot;hundreds of black labourers&quot; from Egypt &quot;to dig the broad and deep trenches&quot; needed to drain the swamps. They &quot;died in scores&quot;. Old tombstones in the local cemetery reveal that out of a population of 540, 210 died of malaria. Therefore, a Bible verse from the Psalms (Tehillim) was inscribed in the city&#x27;s logo: &quot;Those who sow in tears, will reap with songs of joy.&quot; (Ps 126:5) Hashomer guards kept watch over the fields to prevent incursions by the neighboring Bedouin.

By the early twentieth century, Hadera had become the regional economic center. In 1913, the settlement included forty households, as well as fields and vineyards, stretching over 30,000 dunams.

===British Mandate===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Hadera had a total population of 540; 89 Muslims, 1 Christian and 450 Jews. Land disputes in the area were resolved by the 1930s, and the population had grown to 2,002 in 1931. Free schooling was introduced in the city in 1937 in all schools apart from the Histadrut school.


===State of Israel===
After the 1948 War, the north-western part of Hadera (including &quot;Newe Chayyim&quot;) expanded on the land which had belonged to the depopulated Palestinian village of Arab al-Fuqara.

Hadera&#x27;s population increased dramatically in 1948 as immigrants flocked to the country. Most of the newcomers were from Europe, though 40 Yemenite families settled there, too. In 1953, Israel&#x27;s first paper mill opened in Hadera. Financed by investors from Israel, United States, Brazil and Australia, the mill was designed to meet all of Israel&#x27;s paper needs. New neighborhoods were built, among them Givat Olga on the coast, and Beit Eliezer in the east of the city. In 1964, Hadera was declared a city.

In the 1990s, large numbers of Russian and Ethiopian immigrants settled in Hadera. Hadera, considered a safe place by its inhabitants, was jolted by several acts of terrorism during the second intifada. On October 28, 2001, four civilians were killed when a terrorist opened fire on pedestrians at a bus stop. A massacre of six civilians at a Bat Mitzvah occurred in early 2002. A suicide bomber blew himself up at a falafel stand on October 26, 2005, killing seven civilians and injuring 55, five in severe condition. During the second Lebanon War, on August 4, 2006, three rockets fired by Hezbollah hit Hadera. Hadera is south of the Lebanese border and marked the farthest point inside Israel hit by Hezbollah.

In the 2000s, the city center was rejuvenated, a high-tech business park was constructed, and the world&#x27;s largest desalination plant was built. New neighborhoods are under construction in the underdeveloped northeastern part of the city, and plans are under way for a large park, shopping malls and hotels with a total of 1,800 rooms. 

The city is envisaged as a future vacation destination due to its closeness to the Galilee, beaches, and access to major highways.

It is speculated that the water, which is ten degrees warmer than the rest of the sea, could be the attraction.

==Transportation==
Hadera lies along two main Israel Railways lines: the Coastal Line and the nowadays freight-only Eastern Line.

The city center of Hadera is located near Israel&#x27;s two main north–south highways; Highway 2, linking Tel Aviv to Haifa, and Highway 4. This made Hadera an important junction for all coastal bus transportation after 1948 and into the 1950s.

<text>Tayibe, also spelled Taibeh or Tayiba, (, ; ) is an Arab city in central Israel, north east of Kfar Saba. Part of the Triangle region, in it had a population of . Its citizens are Muslims and Christians.

==History==
A village called Tayyibat al-Ism was on the list of lands allocated by sultan Baibars to his amirs in 663 AH (1265–1266 CE), about five centuries after the Arab conquest of Palestine. In Mamluk times, the village name appeared on documents referring to the waqf of the mosque in Hebron.

It has been suggested that the village is identical with Tivata (), a settlement mentioned in the Talmud. According to the Jerusalemite Talmud (Demai 22c), the inn of this settlement (&quot;Pundeqâ de Tibetah&quot;) marked the territorial limit of Caesarea.

===Ottoman Empire===
Under Ottoman rule after 1517, a &quot;sijill&quot; (royal order) from 941/1535 gave 1/3 of the revenue from &quot;Tayyibat al-Ism&quot; to &quot;Ribat al-Mansuri&quot; (Com.); a hospital in Jerusalem established by Al-Mansur Qalawun in 1282. The tax register of 1596 shows the village was under the administration of the &quot;nahiya&quot; of Bani Sab. A population of 50 households (&quot;khana&quot;) and 5 bachelors, all Muslim, paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3% on wheat, barley, summer crops ( melons, beans, vegetables), olive trees, beehives and goats; a total of 19,800 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf. Pierre Jacotin called the village Taibeh on his map in 1799.

In the 1860s, the Ottoman authorities granted the village agricultural plots of land called Ghabat al-Taiyiba al-Shamaliyya and Ghabat al-Taiyiba al-Qibliyya in the former confines of the Forest of Arsur (Ar. Al-Ghaba) in the coastal plain, west of the village.

In 1870/1871 (1288 AH), an Ottoman census listed the village in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (sub-district) of Bani Sa&#x27;b.

The French explorer Victor Guérin described it as a village south of Fardisya, while in the 1882 &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot;, Tayibe was described as: &quot;a large straggling village on the end of a slope, principally built of stone. It is supplied by cisterns and surrounded with olives.&quot;

===British Mandate===
In the 1922 census of Palestine, ‘’Taibeh’’ had a population of 2,350, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census, to 2,944, all Muslim, living in 658 houses. The count may have included two nearby Bedouin tribes.

In the 1945 statistics the population was 4,290 Muslims, while the land area was 32,750 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. This included some nearby Arab communities. Of this, 559 were allocated for citrus and bananas, 3,180 plantations and irrigable land, 23,460 for cereals, while 281 dunams were classified as built-up areas.

===Israel===
During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Israeli forces captured the town lands, but not the town itself. Tayibe was transferred to Israel as part of the 1949 cease-fire agreement with Jordan. According to David Gilmour, &quot;the inhabitants were furious that Abdullah I of Jordan had simply handed them over to Israel but were relieved that they were to be reunited with their land. However, the Law of Acquisition of Absentee Property, which was passed in 1950 but made retroactive, was specially devised to take care of cases like this. Although they had not moved from their village, the inhabitants were declared &#x27;absentees&#x27; and their land &#x27;abandoned property&#x27;. According to the villagers, they lost of their .&quot;

Tayibe achieved local council status in 1952. In 1990, it was declared a city.

In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled that the 2017 seizure of by the same legal device was permitted and charged costs to the petitioners. The families involved were refused access to the maps on which the ruling was based on &quot;national security&quot; grounds. Haaretz described the move as &quot;legalized theft&quot;, &quot;in defiance of both the spirit of the law and its rationale&quot;.

On Oct 11 2024, five residents of Tayibe were indicted for allegedly pledging allegiance to Islamic State, viewing the groups social media content, and having watched &quot;watched instructional videos on preparing explosives and bombs.&quot; with one suspect accused of stating his intent to &quot;blow up Azrieli&quot; a skyscraper complex in Tel Aviv.


==Demographics==

According to CBS, in 2001 the ethnic makeup of the city was 100.0% Arab (99.7% Muslim), with no significant Jewish population. In 2001 there were 15,100 males and 14,500 females. 47.5% of the population was 19 years of age or younger, 17.4% between 20 and 29, 20.3% between 30 and 44, 9.6% from 45 to 59, 2.0% from 60 to 64, and 3.3% 65 years of age or older. The population growth rate in 2001 was 3.2%. In 2011, it had a population of 38,575.

Tayibe had an estimated population of 40,200 in 2014, up from 35,700 in the 2008 census.

The population of Tayibe, one of the largest and most developed Arab localities in Israel, is made up of 20 extended families, all Muslim.

==Landmarks==
An ancient oak tree in Tayibe was declared the largest in Israel. The oak has a trunk circumference of 690 centimeters. According to local legend, there is an angel that watches over the tree and avenges any damage to it. It is said to be 1,400 years old, although this has not been scientifically proven.

==Education and culture==
In 2001, there were 13 schools with a total enrollment of 6,970 students: 9 elementary schools (3,984 students) and 4 high schools (2,986 students). Nearly half of all 12th graders completed their Bagrut matriculation exams.

An educational empowerment project has been operating in Tayibe since 2006 to reduce the dropout rate among Bedouin students. The students receive extra help in Arabic, Hebrew, English and math, and attend special enrichment workshops in inter-personal communication. Following the success of this project, the project has been expanded to nearby Qalansawe and other Arab villages in Israel.

The Tayibe Women Against Violence organization was established to work against violence in the community. The organization offers seminars and workshops that increase women&#x27;s awareness of their rights and helps them find jobs.

==Sports==
The now-defunct Hapoel Tayibe F.C. were the first Israeli Arab club to play in the top division of Israeli football.

<text>Tira (, &quot;al-Tira&quot;, , &quot;Ṭīra&quot;, lit. &quot;Fort&quot;;) is an Arab city in the Central District of Israel. Part of the Triangle, a concentration of Arab towns and villages adjacent to the Green Line, Tira is close to Kfar Saba. It is known for its weekly market and Arab cuisine.

Tira is not documented in 16th-century records, but its origins date back earlier. In the 18th century, it was resettled by Bani Sa&#x27;b tribesmen from Hajjah and Baqa. Today, its population has diverse origins.

Located within Israel&#x27;s fertile bread basket, by 1976 Tira was estimated to have had up to two-thirds of its land expropriated by the state. Today youth employment prospects are low, which has contributed to the city&#x27;s high crime rate. In , the city had a population of .

==History==
The town of Theraspis recorded on the 6th-century Madaba Map was located somewhere nearby. In the 12th century, during the Crusader period, the village of Tira was owned by the Order of St. John and was leased to Robert of Sinjil and his heirs. In the 14th and 15th century, the village was a stop on the road between Gaza and Damascus, and a khan (inn) was constructed.

Grossman concludes that although Tira was occupied during Mamluk times, it was subsequently abandoned, serving as a seasonal or temporary settlement for a long period.&quot;&quot;

===Ottoman Empire===
Tira is not documented in 16th-century records. In the 18th century, it was resettled by Bani Sa&#x27;b tribesmen from Hajjah and Baqa.

Pierre Jacotin called the village &quot;Ertahah&quot; on his map from 1799, possibly mixing it up with the name of Irtah, now part of Tulkarm.

As the conditions of security on the plains improved in the late Ottoman period, the peasants on the safer hilltop villages who had used the land seasonally began to settle more permanently around the khirbas. Until then, they would pass the winter in the hills and shift down in spring to plough, sow, and reap crops. In Tira&#x27;s case, the modern population descended from clans hailing from the village of Bāqat al-Ḥaṭab. The &quot;Maṣārwa&quot;, Arab immigrants from Egypt in Ottoman times, formed a sub-class which in that period lacked a traditional &quot;hamula&quot; (clan) structure. Because they did not own land, they hired themselves out as agricultural labourers.

In the 1860s, the Ottoman authorities granted the village an agricultural plot of land called Ghabat al-Tira in the forest of Arsur (Ar. Al-Ghaba) in the coastal plain, west of the village.

By 1870, Victor Guérin found a &quot;village of seven hundred inhabitants, with gardens planted with fig trees and pomegranates, separated from each other by hedges of cactus.&quot; In 1870/1871 (1288 AH), an Ottoman census listed the village in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (sub-district) of Bani Sa&#x27;b.

In 1882, the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described &quot;et-Tîreh&quot; as &quot;a conspicuous village on a knoll in the plain, surrounded by olives, with a well on the west side.&quot; It was located just south of the monastery Deir &#x27;Asfin on the survey&#x27;s Plate XI.

===British Mandate===
Tira&#x27;s lands were considered the most fertile in all of Palestine.

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Tireh&quot; had a population of 1,588 inhabitants; 1,582 Muslims and 6 Orthodox Christians, increasing in the 1931 census to 2,192; 2,190 Muslims and 2 Christians, in a total of 380 houses.

Of the three village councils established in the area by the Mandatory Authorities in the 1940s, one was in Tira (the other two in Baqa al-Gharbiyye and Tayibe).

Prior to 1948, one kibbutz and two moshavs near TiraRamat HaKovesh, Kfar Hess and Herutwere established after Tira owners sold their properties to Jewish communities. In the 1945 statistics, Tira had 3,180 Muslim inhabitants, who owned a total of 26,803 dunams of land.


===Israel===
During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the Alexandroni Brigade was ordered to capture and raze Tira. However, the village was occupied by Iraqi troops and did not come under Israeli control until May 1949, in the framework the Jordan-Israeli Armistice Agreement. 

The war had cut off Tira&#x27;s inhabitants from their fields. After the Armistice, Israel placed the area in the Triangle it had won control of under the administration of its Custodian of Enemy Property, which entailed treating the farmlands of towns like Tira according to its Absentees Property Law. Since the owners had, however, never left the area or abandoned their property, they were defined as present absentees.

A clause in the cease-fire agreement with Jordan stipulated that Israel lay under an obligation to respect the property rights of the citizens in the Triangle. Several attempts over the years to reverse the designation of the property owners, who had become Israeli citizens overnight, as &quot;present absentees&quot; in order to reclaim their land were rebuffed, the Supreme Court of Israel stating that international agreements signed by the Israeli government were not justiciable in Israel&#x27;s courts.

==Early postwar developments==
In 1945, Tira&#x27;s village lands had extended over 31,359 dunams, of which 26,803 were Arab, and 3,720 under Jewish ownership. Over the years 1953–1954, Israel expropriated a block of 5,232 dunams and, by 1962, of the original total, 8,599 dunams remained for village use. The family-clan structure of its residents has not changed since then. Tira, like all other Arab towns in Israel, was placed under military rule, a system not formally abolished until 1966, and in which considerations of jurisdiction were always decided without local consultation, by talks between the military governor and the Ministry of the Interior. This changed in the 1980s, when each town was allowed to have an Arab representative in such councils.

Though Israel abolished the village councils in Tira, and elsewhere, established by the British, in 1952 Tira was given local council status In the township, municipal elections are regarded as far more important than national elections, since the allocation of municipal jobs, the winners&#x27; spoils, depends on who wins control of the council. Politically in these early decades, Tira voted predominantly for Israeli left wing parties.According to Sabri Jiryis, in 1956 the then governor had two members of the Tira local council banished in order to stop them from voting in the elections for a new chairman. He favoured the candidate proposed by General Zionists, the party the governor belonged to, and, once the 2 Arabs were banished, the governor&#x27;s candidate managed to secure a majority. During the 1965 Knesset elections, Moshe Dayan addressed 3,000 people in the village and stated that the official Israeli policy regarding the integration of its Arab citizens was going too far: integration was &quot;unnecessary&quot; and would not take place.

On the eve of the 1956 Suez Crisis, Tira was one of the border villages subject to a snap curfew. The Border Police officer in charge of Tira, Arye Menashes, asked his commander what to do with the returning villagers who were unaware of the curfew and understood the curt response as meaning that he should kill them. Menashes asked if that applied to women and children, and was told that it did. In the event, unlike at the nearby village of Kfar Qasim where the Border Police murdered 48 people, Menashes decided to disobey the order and allowed the villagers to return to their homes safely.

==Al-Ard sports club==
An attempt in 1957 to set up a sports club in Tira was suppressed by the Shin Bet, who considered such associations subversive. In 1958 the Al-Ard movement was established by Israeli Arabs to press for equality between Israeli Arabs and Jews. The movement dissented from the view held by Arab Knesset representatives who supported continuing military rule over Israel&#x27;s Arab communities. The movement was banned in a decision by the Israeli Supreme Court, with judge Moshe Landau declaring that it posed a threat to Israeli security. After its dissolution, Israel cracked down on Arab sports clubs, on the supposition that such associations were supported by al-Ard, closing one in Taibeh. The Tira sports club re-opened however in 1961, and came to be regarded as a leader in the region&#x27;s Amal movement. When it programmed a festive sports day in April 1964, the government response was to place 5 key club members based in Tira and nearby Kafr Qara members under administrative detention, and subject the two villages to a military closure. Those who did attend the events were arrested. Tira&#x27;s &quot;Tariq &#x27;Abd al-Hayy&quot;, had himself supported their closure. Tira resisted pressure by government officials to close down its own club&#x27;s activities until late 1968, when the authorities ordered its closure when the Ministry of Defence declared it illegal on the grounds that one of the members was associated with Fatah. Later, when the Land Day movement arose, al-Hayy, by then mayor of Tira and a member of the Israeli Labor Party, clamped down on this expression of Palestinian nationalism by repressing the inaugural Land Day strike in Tira. Over 100 policemen were deployed to break the strike, with several villagers shot and some 40 wounded.

==Land restrictions==
The narrowing of developmental space has meant that land purchases for ownership in the Triangle are four to five times higher per dunam than is the price for 49 year land rents in areas where Jewish villages have been established. The land available for Triangle Arabs has been dwindling through expropriation, pari passu with the growth of their populations. Further slimming took place in the 1980s, when the land under the council&#x27;s jurisdiction was 12,664 dunams, as portions were reassigned to the Drom HaSharon Regional Council. By 1993, land owned by Tira residents amounted to 11,750 dunams, meaning 0.78 dunams (780 square metres) per person. The Israel Land Authority exercises jurisdiction over 1,000 dunams within this area.

Over the following years, 1994–1995, further confiscations took place, when a network of high-tension power lines to service Jewish settlements was built along the predominantly private owned Trans-Israel toll highway, which itself was calculated to cause the confiscation of over 4,000 dunams of private Arab land in the Triangle, and the infrastructure, with its 300 metres leeway moved off the highway and ran through Tira agricultural tracts, leading to further restrictions of land use. Tira had a further 950 dunams confiscated, and 400 subjected to limitations on use. Residents of Tira and other affected villages protested, arguing that the power lines could have overlapped with the non-construction zone running along the highway, an objection that had led to the rerouting of the lines in the case of the Jewish kibbutz of Eyal. Their petition was rejected by the Supreme Court of Israel. Repeated attempts to reclaim lost land and allow expansion to cope with demographic growth (1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988) were rejected by the Ministry of the Interior. A request to have 400 dunams of land reincorporated under Tira jurisdiction, land owned by Tira residents who pay taxes to the Lev HaSharon Regional Council, was still pending in 1997.

It was granted city status in 1991.

==Trump Peace Plan==
The Trump peace plan negotiated between Israel and the United States but without Palestinian interlocutors, introduced the possibility of stripping the 350,000 Israeli Arabs in the Triangle, and therefore the citizens of Tira, of their Israeli citizenship rights by transferring that area to an eventual State of Palestine. The prospect is unnerving to the communities that might be affected.

==Demographics==

According to CBS, in 2004 the ethnic makeup of the city was 99.9% Sunni Muslim Arab citizens of Israel. A small number of Jews also live in Tira, drawn by the cheaper housing costs compared with other nearby Jewish localities, such as Kfar Saba. In the 1990s it witnessed an average annual population increase of 2.8%.

From a population of 3,180 inhabitants in 1945, by 2019 Tira&#x27;s population had grown to 26 872.

==Income==
As of 2000, there were 3,654 salaried workers and 953 self-employed individuals in the city, according to the CBS. The mean monthly wage in 2000 for a salaried worker in the city is ILS 3,767, a real change of 2.4% over the course of 2000. Salaried males have a mean monthly wage of ILS 4,494 (a real change of 6.1%) versus ILS 2,319 for females (a real change of −13.0%). The mean income for the self-employed is 4,289. There are 69 people who receive unemployment benefits and 1,183 people who receive an income guarantee. In 2004, 41.9% of the population was part of the workforce.

==Education==
According to CBS, there are 10 schools and 4,735 students in the city. There are seven elementary schools with 2,896 students, and three high schools with 1,839 students. Of 12th grade students, 64.8% were entitled to a matriculation certificate in 2001.

In 2004, 6.5% of the population had 0 years of education, 17.1% had up to 8 years, 55% had 9 to 12 years, 11.8% had 13–15 years, and 9.7% had 16 or more years of education. Ten percent had an academic degree.

The city&#x27;s schools include:

#Al-Zahraa
#Al-Najah
#Al-G&#x27;azali
#Al-Majd
#Al-Aomareya
#Junior High A
#Junior High B
#Junior High c(g)
#&quot;Amal 1&quot;- Ibrahim Qsaem High School
#Technological High School
#Tira&#x27;s Science High School

High school students from Tira have received scholarships from Israeli universities and participate in exchange programs such as Y.E.S (Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs), Seeds of Peace, and CISV.

== Violence ==
Between 2011 and 2019, 31 homicides were recorded in Tira, equivalent to a rate of 12 per 10,000 people – the fifth highest rate within Israel during the period – according to one study. In 2012, Tira&#x27;s leaders complained that the police treated Arabs as second class citizens and did not properly investigate crime. A permanent police station was only established in Tira in May 2013. A 2021 crime review suggests that little has changed since, showing that only 1 of 8 murders in Tira since 2020 had been solved, compared to 71% of murders in Jewish communities.

At the time of the establishment of the police station in 2013, it was noted that a contributing problem to the policing of communities such as Tira was the inadequate co-operation with the local population. In 2021, Tira&#x27;s mayor claimed that the lack of a witness protection program for Arab communities contributed to the fear of providing evidence. A police spokesperson also correlated the rise in crime to the low employment prospects for Arab Israeli youth. According to Nimer Sultany, a Palestinian citizen of Israel and a law professor from Tira, the high crime and poverty rate can be traced back to decades of land confiscation, home demolition, incarceration and discrimination in education and employment in the traditionally agricultural town.

<text>James Camp Tappan (September 9, 1825 – March 19, 1906) was an American lawyer from Helena who served as the 31st speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1897 to 1899. A member of the Democratic Party, Tappan previously served as an Arkansas state representative from Phillips County (1850–1852 and 1897–1901). He also served as a senior officer of the Confederate States Army in the Western and Trans-Mississippi theaters of the American Civil War.

== Early life and education ==
James Camp Tappan was born in Franklin, Tennessee, where his parents had migrated from Newburyport, Massachusetts. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, and graduated from Yale University in 1845. He studied law at Vicksburg, Mississippi, and was admitted to the bar in 1846. He soon moved to Helena, Arkansas. He was elected to two non-consecutive terms in the Arkansas House of Representatives and also served as a circuit court judge. From 1852-1860 he was the receiver for the United States land office in Helena.

== American Civil War ==
At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Tappan&#x27;s sympathies lay with the Confederate cause (despite his Northern parents), and he joined the Confederate army. In May 1861 he received a commission as Colonel of the 13th Arkansas Infantry. He commanded his regiment at the Battle of Belmont and made repeated charges on the &quot;Hornet&#x27;s Nest&quot; at the Battle of Shiloh. After Shiloh, he took part in the Kentucky Campaign and fought at the battles of Richmond and Perryville.

On November 5, 1862, Tappan received his commission as a brigadier-general and was transferred to the Trans-Mississippi Department under Major-General Sterling Price. He commanded his brigade at the Battle of Pleasant Hill, defending against Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks&#x27; Red River Campaign of 1864. His brigade was moved northward back into Arkansas to meet Major-General Frederick Steele at the Battle of Jenkins&#x27; Ferry. He also took part in Price&#x27;s Missouri Expedition.

== Later life ==

After the war, Tappan returned to Helena, Arkansas, and resumed his law practice, where he established himself as the dean of the Arkansas bar. He also engaged in politics after the Reconstruction period and served again in the Arkansas legislature. Tappan was nominated by the Democratic party for Governor of Arkansas on two occasions but declined to run. He died on March 19, 1906, at Helena and was buried at Maple Hill Cemetery near the graves of Confederate generals Thomas C. Hindman and Patrick Cleburne.

The James C. Tappan House was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 4, 1973.

<text>Tamra (, or ) is an Arab city in the North District of Israel located in the Lower Galilee north of the city of Shefa-Amr and approximately east of Acre. In it had a population of .

==History==
Tamra is an ancient village on a hill. Old squared stone blocks have been reused in village homes. Cisterns and tombs carved into rock have also been found here. 
Tamra has been identified with Kefar Tamartha, a Jewish village mentioned in the Talmud as the home of 3rd century amora Rabbi Shila of Kefar Tamarta.

On a hill 3 km west of Tamra&#x27;s historical core lies a ruin called in Arabic Khirbet et-Tira (&quot;ruin of the castle&quot;) and in Hebrew Horbat Tirat Tamra (&quot;Tamra castle ruin&quot;), which has been studied by European and Israeli archaeolgists since the 19th century. The site is dated through its finds to the Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Medieval periods. The site is bisected by Highway 70 and is covered the modern city&#x27;s agricultural lands.

A church constructed in Tamra during the Byzantine era remained active through the Umayyad and Abbasid periods before it was finally abandoned. An inscription using the hijra calendar discovered on the church&#x27;s floor can be dated to AD 725.

===Crusader period===
In the 1253, during the Crusader period, John Aleman, Lord of Caesarea, sold several villages, including Tamra, to the Hospitallers. In 1283 it was mentioned as part of the domain of the Crusaders, according to the &quot;hudna&quot; (temporary truce) between the Crusaders in Acre and the Mamluk sultan Qalawun.

Scholars have suggested that Khirbet et-Tira may be the site of &quot;Tatura&quot;, a Crusader period settlement belonging to the Templar order. The name of the ruin might be a corruption of the Arabic toponym &quot;Turat Tamra&quot;, from the same period. Excavation at the site revealed remains of Crusader structures destroyed by fire in the 13th century.

=== Mamluk period ===
The village from the Mamluk period seems to have persisted until the late 16th to early 17th centuries CE. Around this time, immigrants belonging to the Zu&#x27;abiyah clan settled in what is now known as Tamra, the place where their descendants reside to this day.

===Ottoman period===
Tamra was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517. in the census of 1596 the village was located in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Acca, part of Safad Sanjak. The population was 22 Muslim households. They paid a fixed tax rate of 20% on wheat, barley, fruit trees, cotton, occasional revenues, beehives and winter pastures; a total of 2,929 akçe. In 1799 it was named &quot;Tomrat&quot; on the map of Pierre Jacotin.

In 1859 the British Consul Rogers estimated the population to be 1,200, all Muslims, and the cultivated area 80 feddans, while Victor Guérin found it in 1875 to have 800 inhabitants, all Muslim.

In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described Tamra as: &quot;A large village, with a small mosque on the east and well on the north. There is a rock-cut tomb west of the houses. South of the village, in the valley, a fine olive-grove extends as far as er Rueis.&quot;

A population list from about 1887 showed that Tamra had about 535 inhabitants, all Muslims.

===British Mandate===
At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine Tamra had a population of 1,111, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 1,258, all Muslims, in a total of 282 houses.

In the 1945 statistics, Tamra had 1,830 inhabitants, all Muslims, while the total jurisdiction of the village was 30,559 dunams of land. 1,564 dunams were used for plantations and irrigable land, 14,434 dunams for cereals, while 206 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===State of Israel===
Tamra was captured by Israeli forces from the Arab Liberation Army and the Syrian Army in 1948 Arab–Israeli War as a part of Operation Dekel. On 20 May 1948 the civilian population had been evacuated on orders from Arab irregular forces. According to Benny Morris it was feared that the village would surrender to the Yishuv. The city grew rapidly in the period of Israel&#x27;s first years as a nation due to the influx of Palestinian refugees from destroyed nearby villages such as al-Birwa or al-Damun. Large percentages of the city&#x27;s farming land was expropriated by Israeli authorities and allocated to farming cooperatives and nearby Jewish settlement towns such as Mitzpe Aviv. Tamra achieved local council status in 1956 and was declared a city in 1996. In 2020 the Israeli government approved plans to construct 5,270 housing units in the southern quarter. The plan includes public and transport infrastructure. 

The city became famous for its large dairy factory named &quot;Rajeb-Tamra&quot;, accounting for a sizeable portion of the dairy market in Israel&#x27;s Arab sector.

==Demographics==
According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), at the end of 2007 the city had a total population of 27,300. In 2001, the ethnic makeup of the city was almost entirely Arab (99.6% Muslim), with no significant Jewish population. See Population groups in Israel.

According to CBS, in 2001 there were 11,900 males and 11,400 females. The population of the city was spread out, with 48.5% 19 years of age or younger, 18.0% between 20 and 29, 19.7% between 30 and 44, 9.0% from 45 to 59, 1.6% from 60 to 64, and 3.0% 65 years of age or older. The population growth rate in 2001 was 3.3% and 2005 had dropped to 2.5%.

The largest and most influential clan in Tamra is the Diab, which consists of several branches. Other clans include the Hejazi, and the smaller clans of Abd al-Hadi, Abu Na&#x27;ama, Abu Rumi, Amar, Arshid, Awwad, Kanaan, Muhsin, Nasser, Natour, Ourabi, Radi, Shama, Shaqir, Sheikh Ali and Yassin. In addition to the aforementioned clans, whose presence in Tamra predates the state of Israel, the city is home to internally displaced Palestinians and their descendants from the nearby villages of al-Damun, Hadatha, Mi&#x27;ar and al-Ruways, which were depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.

==Income==
According to CBS, there were 3,908 salaried workers and 375 self-employed persons in 2000. 

==Education==
According to CBS, there are 13 schools and 5,779 students in the city. They are spread out as 9 elementary schools and 4000 elementary school students, and 3 high schools and 2,324 high school students. 54.6% of 12th grade students were entitled to a matriculation certificate in 2001.

During the late 1990s sociologist As&#x27;ad Ghanem set up an NGO in Tamra. It was called &quot;Ibn Khaldun&quot; and campaigned for more Arab history to be taught in Israeli schools.

==Sports==
The current football teams in the city are Maccabi Tamra and F.C. Tzeirei Tamra, both play in Liga Gimel, the fifth tier of Israeli football. Maccabi Tamra and Hapoel Bnei Tamra (which is now defunct), played in the past in Liga Artzit, having been promoted from Liga Alef in 1988 and 2006 respectively.

<text>Yavne () is a city in the Central District of Israel. In 2022, it had a population of 56,232.

Modern Yavne was established in 1949. It is located near the ruins of the ancient town of Yibna (known also as Jamnia and Jabneh), later the village of Yibna, and today the archeological site of Tel Yavne. Ancient Yavne holds a special place in Jewish history because of the ancient town&#x27;s contribution to Judaism&#x27;s recovery and reconstitution under sages ben Zakkai and Gamaliel II following the destruction of the Second Temple. This period, sometimes known as the &quot;Yavne period&quot;, became a crucial mark in the development of Rabbinic Judaism. The city has a history of producing wine throughout much of antiquity, as indicated by both archeological findings and ancient sources.

== Name ==
In many English translations of the Bible, Yavne was known as Jabneh . In Greek and Latin-speaking sources, it was known as Jamnia ( &quot;Iamníā&quot;; ). Under Late Roman and Byzantine rule, it had a mixed population of Christians, Jews, and Samaritans. Under the Crusaders, the city was known as Ibelin, and was where the House of Ibelin resided. During the Ottoman and British periods, it was known as Yibna (). The ancient site is now found at the Tel Yavne archeological site, which is southeast of the modern city.

==History==
===Ancient Yavne===
====Antiquity====
Yavne was one of the major ancient cities in the southern coastal plain, situated south of Jaffa, north of Ashdod, and east of the Mediterranean.

From excavations of the ancient tell (mound created by accumulation of archaeological remains) known as &quot;Tel Yavne&quot; (Hebrew), which developed on a natural kurkar hill, the area shows to have been inhabited continuously from either the Bronze or Iron Age until the British Mandate. During some periods, especially the Byzantine period, the settlement expanded to cover part of the plain and hills surrounding the tell. Yavne is mentioned in the Bible and other ancient texts.

In Roman times, the city was known as Iamnia or Jamnia. It was bequeathed by King Herod upon his death to his sister Salome. Upon her death it passed to Emperor Augustus, who ran it as a private imperial estate, a status retained for at least a century. After Salome&#x27;s death, Iamnia came into the property of Livia, the future Roman empress, and then to her son Tiberius.

In the 40s AD, a dispute emerged in Jamnia when Gentiles constructed a mud-brick altar to the Emperor, provoking the local Jewish population. The Jews destroyed the altar, which they saw as desecration. This led the Gentiles to complain to Capito, the imperial revenue collector in Judaea, who reported the matter to Emperor Caligula. In retaliation, Caligula ordered a statue of himself as Jupiter to be placed in the Holy of Holies at the Temple of Jerusalem.

Iamnia played a role in several events during the First Jewish–Roman War. In 66 AD, the Roman tribune Neapolitanus met with King Agrippa II in Iamnia, to inform him of his mission to investigate the situation in Jerusalem, following Florus&#x27; seizure of Temple funds and clashes between Jews and Roman troops. Later, in spring 68 AD, after the Roman army under Vespasian quelled the insurrection in Galilee, the army marched upon Iamnia and Azotus, taking both towns and stationing garrisons within them.

Following the failure of the revolt and the destruction of the Second Temple, Judaism underwent significant reform in Yavne. According to rabbinic tradition, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai and his disciples were permitted to settle in Iamnia during the outbreak of the war, after ben Zakkai, realizing that Jerusalem was about to fall, departed the city and sought the permission of Vespasian, commander of the Roman forces, to settle in Yavne and teach his disciples. Upon the fall of Jerusalem, his school functioned as a Sanhedrin. It was also theorized for some time to have been the site of a supposed Council of Jamnia that established the rabbinic Jewish biblical canon (although current scholarship largely rejects the theory that such a council in fact occurred).

According to the Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Berakhot&quot; 1:4), when the rabbis argued over some fine point of Jewish law, a Divine voice (Hebrew: &quot;bat ḳol&quot;) was heard in Yavne, ruling in favor of the School of Hillel. To counter a perceived threat to rabbinical authority, the Talmud states that Shmuel ha-Katan of Yavne enacted the &quot;twelfth benediction&quot; in the daily prayer, i.e., the benediction against apostates and heretics (Hebrew: &quot;minim&quot;).

====Crusader period====
The Crusaders renamed the city Ibelin and built its castle there in 1141. An excavation led by Professor Dan Bahat in 2005 revealed the main gate. Its namesake noble family, the House of Ibelin, was important in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and later in the Kingdom of Cyprus. Salvage excavations at the west of the tell unearthed a stash of 53 Crusader coins of the 12th and 13th centuries.

====Muslim Yibna, Early Islamic to Mamluk period====
The Islamic historian al-Baladhuri (died 892 AD) describes Yibna as one of ten towns in Jund Filastin conquered by the Rashidun army led by &#x27;Amr ibn al-&#x27;As in the early 7th century. Ibelin was first sacked by Saladin before his army was routed at the Battle of Montgisard in late 1177. In August 1187, it was retaken and burnt to the ground, and ceased for some time to form part of the Crusaders&#x27; kingdom.

====Mosque====
Ibelin&#x27;s parish church was converted into a mosque, to which a minaret was added during the Mamluk period in 1337. The minaret is still standing, although the mosque itself (the former Crusader church) was blown up by the IDF in 1950.

===Tomb of Abu Huraira/Gamaliel===
The Mausoleum of Abu Huraira, known in Arabic as Maqam Abu Hurayra, described as &quot;one of the finest domed mausoleums in Palestine&quot;, dates back to the 12th century. It was said to be the tomb of Abu Hurairah, a companion (sahaba) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Abu Hurairah however is buried in Medina, Saudi Arabia, but he was also venerated in various places in Palestine, namely in Ramle and Yavne. After 1948 the shrine was adopted by Mizrahi Jews who believe the tomb is the burial place of Rabbi Gamaliel of Yavne. Jewish worshippers say that it was a Jewish burial site that was Islamized later, although there is no record of Jewish pilgrimage there before 1948.

====British Mandate====

In mid-March 1948, a contingent of Iraqi soldiers moved into the village. In a Haganah reprisal on 30 March, two dozen villagers were killed. On April 21, the Iraqi village commander was arrested in Jaffa for drunkenly shooting two Arabs.

During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, residents of Zarnuqa sought refuge in Yibna, but left after the villagers accused them of being traitors.

On 27 May, following the fall of Al-Qubayba and Zarnuqa, most of the population of Yibna fled to Isdud, but armed males were refused entry. On 5 June, when Israeli troops arrived, they found the village almost deserted apart from a few old people who were ordered to leave.

In the 1930s, a plan was proposed to rebuild the ancient Talmudic academy founded by Yochanan Ben Zakkai. In 1941, an agreement was reached between the Jewish National Fund and the Mizrachi/Hapoel Mizrachi movements, allocating five hundred dunams in Yavne area for a yeshiva. In 1948, the building was used as a forward post by Yigal Alon, commander of the southern front, because of its commanding view of the coastal plain.

===Foundation of Modern Yavne===
Yavne was established in October 1948 as a transit camp for Jews from Arab countries, Iran and Europe. The first neighbourhood was established in early 1949. In the early years, the inhabitants were shopkeepers, farmers and construction workers. In 1953, the population was 1,600. In the 1960s, several enterprises moved from Tel Aviv to Yavne, establishing leather, textile, and metallurgy industries. By 1970, the population had grown to 10,100. Other Israeli villages were founded on Yibna land were Kfar HaNagid and Beit Gamliel in 1949, Ben Zakai in 1950, Kfar Aviv (originally: &quot;Kfar HaYeor&quot;) in 1951, Tzofiyya in 1955. According to Walid Khalidi, a railroad crosses the village. The old mosque and minaret, together with a shrine can still be seen, and some of the old houses are inhabited by Jewish and Arab families.

The 1980 edition of a guidebook published in Jerusalem describes Yavne as home to Israel&#x27;s first atomic reactor, an image of which appeared on a 0.50 Shekel stamp.

When Mayor Meir Sheetrit assumed office in 1974, the city became a low-density suburban satellite of Tel Aviv with new construction targeting middle-class families. Yavne achieved city status in 1986. By the mid-1990s, the population had risen to 25,600.

==Demography==

According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), in 2021 the ethnic makeup of the city was 99 percent Jewish and others, without significant Arab population. As of March 2021 the city numbered 53,595 persons, with a high percentage of young people: 37% of the population was in the 0–19 age group and 71% of the total population was younger than 44.
==Economy==
Major companies based in Yavne include Ormat Industries, Aeronautics Defense Systems, Avisar and Orbotech.
In 2019, Merck established an incubator in Yavne with a budget of about €20 million over three years that will invest in startups focusing on semiconductor and display crystal technologies. In 2022 Recipharm established a new facility in Yavne. MediWound manufactures NexoBrid in Yavne, a unique product for the treatment of severe burns. It allows saving affected tissue which would otherwise need to be removed, leading to less amputations of hands and feet. Many October 7, 2023 victims have benefitted from it, with the US also buying $20 million worth of NexoBrid for its strategic national stockpile.

In 2012 a new green neighborhood &quot;Neot Rabin&quot; was inaugurated in the south of the city.

==Sports==
Maccabi Yavne is the city&#x27;s major football club. During the 1980s the club played in the top division and in 1985 won the Toto Cup. Today they are in Liga Leumit. The basketball team, Elitzur Yavne, have also played in the Liga Leumit (basketball) since 2007.

Omri Casspi, the first Israeli to play in the National Basketball Association, grew up in the city and played for some of its teams.

==Archaeology==
Tel Yavne was first excavated in 2005 in a dig headed by Dan Bahat, who unearthed the gate room of the Crusader castle of Ibelin, as well as a vault destroyed with gunpowder by the Mamluks and deeply embedded Crusader walls east of it, all at or around the top of the tell.

In December 2019, a large number of pottery kilns and 1,200-year-old gold coins which may have been a Palestinian potter&#x27;s &quot;piggy bank&quot; were unearthed in a juglet by the Israeli Antiquities Authority. According to archaeologist Robert Kool, the coins date back to the early Abbasid period, about 9th century CE. One of the seven coins was minted by Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786–809 CE). &quot;These are gold dinars issued by the Aghlabid dynasty that ruled in North Africa. Without a doubt this is a wonderful Hanukkah present for us,&quot; said Kool. In August 2020, Israeli archaeologists discovered 425 complete gold coins, most dating to the Abbasid period around 1,100 years ago. In April 2021, archaeologists announced the discovery of a 1,600-year-old multicolored mosaic dated back to the Byzantine period in an industrial area. According to IAA archaeologist Elie Haddad, it was the first time that excavators revealed a colored mosaic floor in Yavne.

The ancient harbour of Yavne, Yavne-Yam (in Arabic &quot;Minet Rubin&quot;) was identified on the coast. Excavations have revealed fortification going back to the Bronze Age Hyksos. It was in use from the Middle Bronze Age until the 12th century CE, when it was abandoned. refers to the burning of the harbour and its fleet on the direction of Judas Maccabeus.

In 2022, a sling bullet was discovered with the Greek inscription &quot;Victory of Heracles and Hauronas&quot;, the two gods were the patrons of the city during the Hellenistic period.

<text>Yehud () is a city in the Central District of Israel that is part of the joint municipality of Yehud-Monosson. In 2007, the city&#x27;s population stood at approximately 30,000 people (including Neve Monosson – see below).

==History==
The history of Yehud traces back thousands of years, with it seeing its first mention in the Bible in . It was later called &quot;Iudaea&quot; by the Romans. During the Ottoman era it was known as &quot;Al-Yahudiya&quot; and censuses showed its population as entirely Arab and Muslim. In the 16th century, it was endowed to the Ottoman Khasseki Sultan soup kitchen in Jerusalem. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the area belonged to the Nahiyeh (sub-district) of Lod that encompassed the area of the present-day city of Modi&#x27;in-Maccabim-Re&#x27;ut in the south to the present-day city of El&#x27;ad in the north, and from the foothills in the east, through the Lod Valley to the outskirts of Jaffa in the west. This area was home to thousands of inhabitants in about 20 villages, who had at their disposal tens of thousands of hectares of prime agricultural land.

In 1932, during the British Mandate, Yehud was renamed to Al-&#x27;Abbasiyya, supposedly because its Arab inhabitants did not want its name to be connected to the Jewish people. The new name memorialized a sheikh named al-ʽAbbas who was buried in the town, while also alluding to the Abbasid Caliphate. Parts of Yehud are located on the land of the Palestinian village of al-ʽAbbasiyya, which became depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

In June 2011, the city&#x27;s officials announced they would undertake a massive construction project to replicate the old town square of the Swiss city of Lugano in the centre of Yehud, to reinvigorate commerce and tourism. The replica will be replete with neoclassical columns and colonnades. This project was scheduled to be finished and in fall 2016; it opened in early 2018.

==Local government==
In 2003, the Yehud-Monosson Municipality was formed to provide municipal services to Yehud and the neighboring community of Neve Monosson (pop. 2,600). Under the terms of the merger, Neve Monosson maintains a high level of autonomy under the Neve Monosson Local Administration (&quot;minhelet&quot;). The Neve Monosson Local Administration was granted municipal status as an autonomous borough (&quot;vaad rova ironi&quot;) by the Interior Minister in 2005 as a condition of the merger plan. The result is that the Yehud-Monosson Municipality functions practically as the municipality of Yehud while at the same time providing basic statutory municipal services to Neve Monosson.

==Demographics==
According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2001 the ethnic makeup of the city was uniformly Jewish. See Population groups in Israel. According to CBS, in 2001 there were 10,500 males and 11,100 females. The population of the city was spread out, with 33.4% 19 years of age or younger, 16.1% between 20 and 29, 19.9% between 30 and 44, 18.8% from 45 to 59, 2.9% from 60 to 64, and 8.8% 65 years of age or older. The population growth rate in 2001 was 2.6%.

==Economy==
Yehud serves as the base of the large Africa Israel Investments company majority owned by Lev Leviev.

The control room of SpaceIL is in Yehud. From that base, SpaceIL manages the operations of the Beresheet lander.

==Education==

According to CBS, there are 10 schools and 5,159 students in the city. They are spread out, as 6 elementary schools and 2,252 elementary school students, and 5 high schools and 2,907 high school students. 54.2% of 12th grade students were entitled to a matriculation certificate in 2001. and 92.5% in 2021 

==Sports==
Football: (Soccer) Hapoel Yehud spent several seasons in the top division of Israeli football during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and won the State Cup in 1982. However, after several relegations the club folded in 1998. A new club, Hapoel Ironi Yehud, was established in 2004 and currently plays in Liga Gimel. (Division III)

<text>Kfar Saba ( ), officially Kfar Sava , is a city in the Sharon region, of the Central District of Israel. In 2019 it had a population of 110,456, making it the 16th-largest city in Israel. The population of Kfar Saba is nearly entirely Jewish.

==History of modern Kfar Saba==
The village of Kafr Saba was considered to be ancient Capharsaba, an important settlement during the Second Temple period in ancient Judea. It is mentioned for the first time in the writings of Josephus, in his account of the attempt of Alexander Jannaeus to halt an invasion from the north led by Antiochus, appears in the Talmud in connection to corn tithing and the Capharsaba sycamore fig tree.

===Beginnings (1898–1913)===
The Jewish moshava of Kfar Saba was established in 1898, following the purchase of land from the Arab village of the same name. Acquiring 7,500 dunams (equivalent to 1,668 acres in Ottoman Palestine, where a dunam equals 900 square meters), the endeavor faced initial challenges: the land was desolate, neglected, and distant from other Jewish settlements. Furthermore, the Ottoman pasha of Nablus, to whose governorate the land belonged, refused to give building permits, forcing the first settlers to live in huts made of clay and straw. They earned their living by growing almonds, grapes and olives. It was located approximately 3 km to the west of the Arab village of Kafr Saba, after which it was named. Despite attractive advertisements in Jerusalem and London, initial attempts to sell plots to private individuals were unsuccessful. Starting in 1903, Jewish workers resided on the site of Kfar Saba. A well was dug in 1906. Most of the manual laborers on the land were peasants from Qalqilya. 

In 1910, an Arab guard employed by Jewish landowners shot at a group of Arab almond thieves from Qalqilya, killing one. An Arab mob then descended on Kfar Saba, beating residents, breaking and looting equipment, and taking two Jewish guards prisoner. The situation was defused when reinforcements from Petah Tikva arrived, and a peace was negotiated. This attack drew widespread public attention among Jews in Palestine and around the world, and it was subsequently decided to turn Kfar Saba into a permanent settlement, even without building permits. In 1912, the construction of twelve single-story permanent houses began along a route that is now Herzl Street. The houses were camouflaged due to the lack of building permits. Construction was finished in 1913.

===World War I===
When World War I broke out in 1914, the Ottoman authorities harassed the residents, confiscating work animals and crops. The 1915 Palestine locust infestation destroyed vegetation in the area. Before Kfar Saba had fully recovered, about a thousand Jewish refugees of the Tel Aviv and Jaffa deportation who were seeking shelter arrived. The town&#x27;s few houses could not accommodate the large number of refugees, and many died due to the harsh sanitary conditions.
In the Palestine Campaign of the war, Kfar Saba was on the front line between British General Edmund Allenby&#x27;s Egypt Expeditionary Force and the Ottoman Army for almost a year, and by the time of the British victory in September 1918, it had been destroyed.

===British Mandate=== 
Following Kfar Saba&#x27;s destruction in World War I, residents began rebuilding the town. During the 1921 Jaffa riots, Kfar Saba, then a small and isolated town, was evacuated on orders of the Haganah. It was attacked during the riots. In May 1921 the original residents returned and found their homes had been looted and burned. They began to rebuild the town for a third time, and it slowly recovered. In 1924 additional settlers joined Kfar Saba. In this period the moshava began to redevelop as cultivation of citrus fruit began, replacing almonds. The first elections for the local council were held.

In August 1947, a Jewish man was found shot to death outside the town.

===1947–48 war===
In December 1947, as the civil war between the Arab and Jewish communities got underway, leaders of both sides in the area pledged to keep the peace between the local communities. In the following months, Kfar Saba was attacked by local Arab militia from the nearby Arab village of Kafr Saba. The Arab Liberation Army (ALA), an outfit consisting of volunteers from several neighboring Arab countries, sent troops to aid in these attacks. 

The village was depopulated of its Arab residents by Jewish forces on May 13, 1948, one day before the new State of Israel was declared.

===State of Israel===
In May 1948, when Israeli independence was declared, Kfar Saba had a population of approximately 5,500. Following the war, it rapidly expanded as many Jewish immigrants from Arab and Muslim countries settled there, and new housing projects were built to accommodate them. The town found itself at the narrowest point of Israeli territory, with just 14 km from the sea to the West Bank village of Qalqilya. It expanded over the depopulated Arab village of Kafr Saba, the site of which is today located in the Shikun Kaplan area of the city. As it became obvious that agriculture alone could not support the economy, an industrial zone was established. In 1953, the population was about 15,000. Meir Hospital was opened in 1956.

The rapid growth of the town meant that its status as a moshava was outdated, and it was granted city status in 1962, with head of the local council, Mordechai Surkis, becoming its first mayor. The city had a population of 19,000 at the time. After receiving its city status, a court, a police branch, and offices of the National Insurance Institute and the Israel Tax Authority were established in Kfar Saba. Agriculture also continued to decline in importance in the city&#x27;s economy as new factories were built. Despite this, the city still had thousands of acres of orchards in the late 1960s.

During the Six-Day War in 1967, two neighborhoods in Kfar Saba were shelled by Jordanian artillery, and an attack on a factory by Jordanian warplanes killed four workers. Following the war, the population increased as many people moved to Kfar Saba from the Gush Dan area, and during Soviet-Jewish immigration to Israel in the early 1970s, the city took in many Soviet immigrants and established an immigrant absorption center. In 1977, Kfar Saba had a population of 35,000.

====First and Second Intifada====
Kfar Saba is located just across the Green Line from the Palestinian city of Qalqilya. During times of relative peace, residents of Kfar Saba would shop in Qalqilya: this practice ended at the start of the First Intifada in 1987. In the following years, Kfar Saba became a frequent target of Palestinian terror attacks. In April 2001, a Palestinian suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt killed a doctor and wounded 50 at a bus stop in Kfar Saba. In March 2002, a Palestinian opened fire on passersby at a major intersection, killing an Israeli girl and wounding 16 before being shot dead. In April 2003, a Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up at the Kfar Saba train station during the morning rush hour, killing a security guard and wounding 10 bystanders.

==== Israel Hamas conflict ====
On 25 March 2019, a rocket hit a private home injuring 7.

On 26 May, rockets were fired from Rafah towards Central Israel around 2 pm. One landed in Kfar Saba, creating a large crater; no serious injuries were reported. 

==Demographics==
The 1922 census of Palestine listed the population of Kfar Saba as 14 Jews. By the 1931 census it had grown to 1,405 inhabitants, all Jews, in 395 houses.

In the 1945 statistics, the town had a population of 4,320 Jews.

According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), in 2001, the ethnic makeup of the city was 99.9% Jewish and 0.1% Others. Additionally, there were 523 immigrant residents. Also according to the CBS, there were 37,000 males and 39,600 females in 2001. The population of the city was spread out, with 31.1% 19 years of age or younger, 16.3% between 20 and 29, 17.7% between 30 and 44, 20.2% from 45 to 59, 3.5% from 60 to 64, and 11.3% 65 years of age or older. The population growth rate was 2.0% for that year.

The city is ranked high on the socio-economic scale (8 out of 10).
Kfar Saba has a listed population surpassing 110,000 .

==Economy==

According to CBS, there were 31,528 salaried workers and 2,648 self-employed in Kfar Saba in 2000. The mean monthly wage in 2000 for a salaried worker was ILS 7,120, a real change of 10.1% over the course of 2000. Salaried males had a mean monthly wage of ILS 9,343 (a real change of 9.9%) versus ILS 5,033 for females (a real change of 9.7%). The mean income for the self-employed was 8,980. 1,015 people received unemployment benefits and 1,682 people received an income guarantee.

In May 2004 the exploration company said that the Meged-4 oil well, located northeast of Kfar Saba, has exceeded original predictions and contains an extremely valuable deposit of oil.

==Schools and religious institutions==
Currently, in Kfar Saba there are 18 elementary schools (5 of them are religious elementary schools), 8 middle schools (2 of them are religious middle schools) and 11 high schools (4 of them are religious high schools). The high schools in Kfar Saba are divided to 3 groups: urban high schools (5), ORT high schools (2) and religious high schools (4).

The city is served by 105 synagogues.

==Healthcare==
Meir Hospital is located in Kfar Saba. Meir Hospital is a major medical center named for Josef Meir, the first head of the General Sick Fund. The hospital accepts all patients, Jews and Palestinians, including patients from cities within the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, such as Qalqilyah.

==Environmental issues==
Kfar Saba has won multiple awards for environment protection efforts. Kfar Saba is also the site of Israel&#x27;s first biofilter project.

==Landmarks==
===Nabi Yamin===
A Mamluk caravanserai complex, including the mausoleum of Nabi Yamin, is located by the Kfar Saba – Qalqilyah road. The site contains an inscription dated to the 14th century. The site has been associated with the tomb of Benjamin, son of Jacob. North of this complex is a smaller tomb whose cupola has been painted green and is being maintained by local Palestinian Muslims, who consider it the &quot;real&quot; tomb. Jews and Muslims venerate Benjamin. Kfar Saba is in the heart of Dan&#x27;s tribal area, but there are traditions that explain why Benjamin&#x27;s tomb is located in the land of the tribe of Dan. The traditional burial place of Simeon, son of Jacob, lies close to Kfar Saba. It is a small domed structure that sits in a field not far from kibbutz Eyal. According to Meron Benvenisti, the site was until 1948 only holy to Muslims, and Jews ascribed no holiness to it. Today the dedicated inscriptions from the Mamluk period remain engraved on the stone walls of the tomb but the cloths embroidered with verses from the Qur´an, with which the gravestones were draped, have been replaced by draperies bearing verses from the Hebrew Bible.

===First well===
The modern development of Kfar Saba started when water was discovered in the early 1920s. The first well was excavated at this time, followed by many others over the next two decades. The Kfar Saba Water Plant was founded to centralize the water supply system. The city&#x27;s first well is located in the courtyard of Kfar Saba City Hall.

===Amrami&#x27;s dairy farm===
The site of the dairy farm of Baruch Amrami, who transferred the administration of the Kfar Saba settlement from Petah Tikva to a local committee and founded the water company and the first bank of the village in the 1920s, is on the corner of Amrami and Rothschild Streets. The cowshed and Amrami&#x27;s &quot;office&quot; are still standing.

===Nordenstein house===
Due to the lack of security during World War I, the settlement was abandoned. In 1922, the Nordenstein family returned and built the first defensible stone house. It took another two years for other families to return (mostly from Petah Tikva). The Nordenstein House is still standing on HaEmek Street, near the central bus station.

===Kibbutz HaKovesh dining hall===
A stone house on Tel Hai Street designed for defense (outlooks and sharp-shooting parapets) served as the communal dining room of Kibbutz HaKovesh. The pioneers themselves lived in tents. In 1948, the kibbutz moved north to secure the Kalkiliya front. The building now houses the Kfar Saba Civil Guard.

===City&#x27;s Park===
Kfar Saba&#x27;s Park is one of the biggest parks in the Sharon area. It has an area of 250,000 m2.
The park includes kids playgrounds, water fountains, roller skate arena, fitness facilities, and shaded dining areas.
The park is open daily between 6:30 am and 11:00 pm. There is free parking for city residents in different locations around the park.

===Eva Fischer Fund===
Located in the Kfar Saba&#x27;s Municipality Center is the Eva Fischer Fund, which displays artworks about the Shoah given to the city by the Italian painter.

==Archaeology==
Remnants of an ancient Israelite village were discovered east of the city, and are believed to be the ruins of biblical Capharsaba. The Kfar Saba Archaeology Museum exhibits artifacts found in the region.

== Architecture ==
Kfar Saba is characterized by residential buildings with red tiled roofs. The use of red tiled roofs is evident in all types of buildings: private homes, high-rise buildings, businesses and industry. There is a widespread use of porches with arches, especially in front of the stores at Weizmann and Rothschild streets.

In 2014, the Kfar Saba Municipality decided to oblige every contractor who wants to build in the city area to install &quot;green roofs.&quot; The meaning of green roofs is that solar panels will be installed on the roof to generate electricity from solar energy or a vegetable garden will be planted.

==Industry==
Kfar Saba has one large industrial zone in the east of the city. It contains hi-tech offices and industrial plants, including Teva Pharmaceuticals&#x27; plant.
==Transportation==
Kfar Saba is served by Kfar Saba–Nordau railway station.

==In popular culture==
Kfar Saba was the primary filming location of FX&#x27;s 2014-16 drama series &quot;Tyrant&quot;, which takes place in the fictional Arab country of Baladi.

<doc id="323322" wikidata="Q207540" url="?curid=323322" title="Lod">
<text>Lod (, or fully vocalized ), also known as Lydda () and Lidd (, or ), is a city southeast of Tel Aviv and northwest of Jerusalem in the Central District of Israel. It is situated between the lower Shephelah on the east and the coastal plain on the west. The city had a population of in 2019.

Lod has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic period. It is mentioned a few times in the Hebrew Bible and in the New Testament. Between the 5th century BCE and up until the late Roman period, it was a prominent center for Jewish scholarship and trade. Around 200 CE, the city became a Roman colony and was renamed (). Tradition identifies Lod as the 4th century martyrdom site of Saint George; the Church of Saint George and Mosque of Al-Khadr located in the city is believed to have housed his remains. 

Following the Arab conquest of the Levant, Lod served as the capital of Jund Filastin; however, a few decades later, the seat of power was transferred to Ramla, and Lod slipped in importance. Under Crusader rule, the city was a Catholic diocese of the Latin Church and it remains a titular see to this day.

Lod underwent a major change in its population in the mid-20th century. Exclusively Palestinian Arab in 1947, Lod was part of the area designated for an Arab state in the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine; however, in July 1948, the city was occupied by the Israel Defense Forces, and most of its Arab inhabitants were expelled in the 1948 Palestinian expulsion from Lydda and Ramle. The city was largely resettled by Jewish immigrants, most of them expelled from Arab countries. 

Today, Lod is one of Israel&#x27;s mixed cities, with an Arab population of 30%. Lod is one of Israel&#x27;s major transportation hubs. The main international airport, Ben Gurion Airport, is located 8 km (5 miles) north of the city. The city is also a major railway and road junction.

==Religious references==
The Hebrew name Lod appears in the Hebrew Bible as a town of Benjamin, founded along with Ono by Shamed or Shamer (1 Chronicles 8:12; Ezra 2:33; Nehemiah 7:37; 11:35). In , it is mentioned as one of the cities whose inhabitants returned after the Babylonian captivity. Lod is not mentioned among the towns allocated to the tribe of Benjamin in . 

The name Lod derives from a tri-consonental root not extant in Northwest Semitic, but only in Arabic (“to quarrel; withhold, hinder”). An Arabic etymology of such an ancient name is unlikely (the earliest attestation is from the Achaemenid period). 

In the New Testament, the town appears in its Greek form, Lydda, as the site of Peter&#x27;s healing of Aeneas in .

The city is also mentioned in an Islamic hadith as the location of the battlefield where the false messiah (al-Masih ad-Dajjal) will be slain before the Day of Judgment.

==History==
===Neolithic and Chalcolithic===
The first occupation was in the Neolithic period. Occupation continued in the Chalcolithic. Pottery finds have dated the initial settlement in the area now occupied by the town to 5600–5250 BCE.

===Early Bronze===
In the Early Bronze, it was an important settlement in the central coastal plain between the Judean Shephelah and the Mediterranean coast, along Nahal Ayalon. Other important nearby sites were Tel Dalit, Tel Bareqet, Khirbat Abu Hamid (Shoham North), Tel Afeq, Azor and Jaffa.

Two architectural phases belong to the late EB I in Area B. The first phase had a mudbrick wall, while the late phase included a circulat stone structure. Later excavations have produced an occupation later, Stratum IV. It consists of two phases, Stratum IVb with mudbrick wall on stone foundations and rounded exterior corners. In Stratum IVa there was a mudbrick wall with no stone foundations, with imported Egyptian potter and local pottery imitations.

Another excavations revealed nine occupation strata. Strata VI-III belonged to Early Bronze IB. The material culture showed Egyptian imports in strata V and IV.

Occupation continued into Early Bronze II with four strata (V-II). There was continuity in the material culture and indications of centralized urban planning.

===Middle Bronze===
North to the tell were scattered MB II burials.

===Late Bronze===
The earliest written record is in a list of Canaanite towns drawn up by the Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III at Karnak in 1465 BCE.

===Classical era===
From the fifth century BCE until the Roman period, the city was a centre of Jewish scholarship and commerce. 

According to British historian Martin Gilbert, during the Hasmonean period, Jonathan Maccabee and his brother, Simon Maccabaeus, enlarged the area under Jewish control, which included conquering the city.

===Roman era===

The Jewish community in Lod during the Mishnah and Talmud era is described in a significant number of sources, including information on its institutions, demographics, and way of life. The city reached its height as a Jewish center between the First Jewish-Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt, and again in the days of Judah ha-Nasi and the start of the Amoraim period. The city was then the site of numerous public institutions, including schools, study houses, and synagogues. 

In 43 BC, Cassius, the Roman governor of Syria, sold the inhabitants of Lod into slavery, but they were set free two years later by Mark Antony. 

During the First Jewish–Roman War, the Roman &quot;proconsul&quot; of Syria, Cestius Gallus, razed the town on his way to Jerusalem in &quot;Tishrei&quot; 66 CE. According to Josephus, &quot;[he] found the city deserted, for the entire population had gone up to Jerusalem for the Feast of Tabernacles. He killed fifty people whom he found, burned the town and marched on&quot;. Lydda was occupied by Emperor Vespasian in 68 CE.

In the period following the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Rabbi Tarfon, who appears in many Tannaitic and Jewish legal discussions, served as a rabbinic authority in Lod.

During the Kitos War, 115–117 CE, the Roman army laid siege to Lod, where the rebel Jews had gathered under the leadership of Julian and Pappos. Torah study was outlawed by the Romans and pursued mostly in the underground. The distress became so great, the patriarch Rabban Gamaliel II, who was shut up there and died soon afterwards, permitted fasting on Ḥanukkah. Other rabbis disagreed with this ruling. Lydda was next taken and many of the Jews were executed; the &quot;slain of Lydda&quot; are often mentioned in words of reverential praise in the Talmud.

In 200 CE, emperor Septimius Severus elevated the town to the status of a city, calling it &quot;Colonia Lucia Septimia Severa Diospolis&quot;. The name &quot;Diospolis&quot; (&quot;City of Zeus&quot;) may have been bestowed earlier, possibly by Hadrian. At that point, most of its inhabitants were Christian. The earliest known bishop is Aëtius, a friend of Arius.

During the following century (200-300CE), it&#x27;s said that Joshua ben Levi founded a yeshiva in Lod.

===Byzantine period===

In December 415, the Council of Diospolis was held here to try Pelagius; he was acquitted. In the sixth century, the city was renamed Georgiopolis after St. George, a soldier in the guard of the emperor Diocletian, who was born there between 256 and 285 CE. 

The Church of Saint George and Mosque of Al-Khadr is named for him.
The 6th-century Madaba map shows Lydda as an unwalled city with a cluster of buildings under a black inscription reading &quot;Lod, also Lydea, also Diospolis&quot;. An isolated large building with a semicircular colonnaded plaza in front of it might represent the St George shrine.

===Early Muslim period===
After the Muslim conquest of Palestine by Amr ibn al-&#x27;As in 636 CE, Lod which was referred to as &quot;al-Ludd&quot; in Arabic served as the capital of Jund Filastin (&quot;Military District of Palaestina&quot;) before the seat of power was moved to nearby Ramla during the reign of the Umayyad Caliph Suleiman ibn Abd al-Malik in 715–716. The population of al-Ludd was relocated to Ramla, as well. With the relocation of its inhabitants and the construction of the White Mosque in Ramla, al-Ludd lost its importance and fell into decay.

The city was visited by the local Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi in 985, when it was under the Fatimid Caliphate, and was noted for its Great Mosque which served the residents of al-Ludd, Ramla, and the nearby villages. He also wrote of the city&#x27;s &quot;wonderful church (of St. George) at the gate of which Christ will slay the Antichrist.&quot;

===Crusader and Ayyubid period===
The Crusaders occupied the city in 1099 and named it St Jorge de Lidde. It was briefly conquered by Saladin, but retaken by the Crusaders in 1191. For the English Crusaders, it was a place of great significance as the birthplace of Saint George. The Crusaders made it the seat of a Latin Church diocese, and it remains a titular see. It owed the service of 10 knights and 20 sergeants, and it had its own burgess court during this era.

In 1226, Ayyubid Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi visited al-Ludd and stated it was part of the Jerusalem District during Ayyubid rule.

===Mamluk period===
Sultan Baybars brought Lydda again under Muslim control by 1267–8. According to Qalqashandi, Lydda was an administrative centre of a wilaya during the fourteenth and fifteenth century in the Mamluk empire. Mujir al-Din described it as a pleasant village with an active Friday mosque. During this time, Lydda was a station on the postal route between Cairo and Damascus.

===Ottoman period===
In 1517, Lydda was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire as part of the Damascus Eyalet, and in the 1550s, the revenues of Lydda were designated for the new waqf of Hasseki Sultan Imaret in Jerusalem, established by Hasseki Hurrem Sultan (Roxelana), the wife of Suleiman the Magnificent.

By 1596 Lydda was a part of the &quot;nahiya&quot; (&quot;subdistrict&quot;) of Ramla, which was under the administration of the &quot;liwa&quot; (&quot;district&quot;) of Gaza. It had a population of 241 households and 14 bachelors who were all Muslims, and 233 households who were Christians. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33,3 % on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards, fruit trees, sesame, special product (&quot;dawalib&quot; =spinning wheels), goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues and market toll, a total of 45,000 Akçe. All of the revenue went to the Waqf.

In 1051 AH/1641/2, the Bedouin tribe of al-Sawālima from around Jaffa attacked the villages of Subṭāra, Bayt Dajan, al-Sāfiriya, Jindās, Lydda and Yāzūr belonging to Waqf Haseki Sultan.

The village appeared as &quot;Lydda&quot;, though misplaced, on the map of Pierre Jacotin compiled in 1799.

Missionary William M. Thomson visited Lydda in the mid-19th century, describing it as a &quot;flourishing village of some 2,000 inhabitants, imbosomed in noble orchards of olive, fig, pomegranate, mulberry, sycamore, and other trees, surrounded every way by a very fertile neighbourhood. The inhabitants are evidently industrious and thriving, and the whole country between this and Ramleh is fast being filled up with their flourishing orchards. Rarely have I beheld a rural scene more delightful than this presented in early harvest ... It must be seen, heard, and enjoyed to be appreciated.&quot;

In 1869, the population of Ludd was given as: 55 Catholics, 1,940 &quot;Greeks&quot;, 5 Protestants and 4,850 Muslims. In 1870, the Church of Saint George was rebuilt. In 1892, the first railway station in the entire region was established in the city. In the second half of the 19th century, Jewish merchants migrated to the city, but left after the 1921 Jaffa riots.

In 1882, the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described Lod as &quot;A small town, standing among enclosure of prickly pear, and having fine olive groves around it, especially to the south. The minaret of the mosque is a very conspicuous object over the whole of the plain. The inhabitants are principally Moslim, though the place is the seat of a Greek bishop resident of Jerusalem. The Crusading church has lately been restored, and is used by the Greeks. Wells are found in the gardens...&quot;

===British Mandate===

From 1918, Lydda was under the administration of the British Mandate in Palestine, as per a League of Nations decree that followed the Great War. During the Second World War, the British set up supply posts in and around Lydda and its railway station, also building an airport that was renamed Ben Gurion Airport after the death of Israel&#x27;s first prime minister in 1973.

At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine, Lydda had a population of 8,103 inhabitants (7,166 Muslims, 926 Christians, and 11 Jews), the Christians were 921 Orthodox, 4 Roman Catholics and 1 Melkite. This had increased by the 1931 census to 11,250 (10,002 Muslims, 1,210 Christians, 28 Jews, and 10 Bahai), in a total of 2475 residential houses.

In 1938, Lydda had a population of 12,750.

In 1945, Lydda had a population of 16,780 (14,910 Muslims, 1,840 Christians, 20 Jews and 10 &quot;other&quot;). Until 1948, Lydda was an Arab town with a population of around 20,000—18,500 Muslims and 1,500 Christians. In 1947, the United Nations proposed dividing Mandatory Palestine into two states, one Jewish state and one Arab; Lydda was to form part of the proposed Arab state. In the ensuing war, Israel captured Arab towns outside the area the UN had allotted it, including Lydda.

In December 1947, thirteen Jewish passengers in a seven-car convoy to Ben Shemen Youth Village were ambushed and murdered.In a separate incident, three Jewish youths, two men and a woman were captured, then raped and murdered in a neighbouring village. Their bodies were paraded in Lydda’s principal street.

===State of Israel===
The Israel Defense Forces entered Lydda on 11 July 1948. The following day, under the impression that it was under attack, the 3rd Battalion was ordered to shoot anyone &quot;seen on the streets&quot;. According to Israel, 250 Arabs were killed. Other estimates are higher: Arab historian Aref al Aref estimated 400, and Nimr al Khatib 1,700.

In 1948, the population rose to 50,000 during the Nakba, as Arab refugees fleeing other areas made their way there. A key event was the Lydda Death March, with the expulsion of 50,000-70,000 Palestinians from Lydda and Ramle by the Israel Defense Forces. All but 700 to 1,056 were expelled by order of the Israeli high command, and forced to walk to the Jordanian Arab Legion lines. Estimates of those who died from exhaustion and dehydration vary from a handful to 355. The town was subsequently sacked by the Israeli army. Some scholars, including Ilan Pappé, characterize this as ethnic cleansing. The few hundred Arabs who remained in the city were soon outnumbered by the influx of Jews who immigrated to Lod from August 1948 onward, most of them from Arab countries. As a result, Lod became a predominantly Jewish town.

After the establishment of the state, the biblical name Lod was readopted.


The Jewish immigrants who settled Lod came in waves, first from Morocco and Tunisia, later from Ethiopia, and then from the former Soviet Union. 

Since 2008, many urban development projects have been undertaken to improve the image of the city. Upscale neighbourhoods have been built, among them Ganei Ya&#x27;ar and Ahisemah, expanding the city to the east. According to a 2010 report in the &quot;Economist&quot;, a three-meter-high wall was built between Jewish and Arab neighbourhoods and construction in Jewish areas was given priority over construction in Arab neighborhoods. The newspaper says that violent crime in the Arab sector revolves mainly around family feuds over turf and honour crimes. In 2010, the Lod Community Foundation organised an event for representatives of bicultural youth movements, volunteer aid organisations, educational start-ups, businessmen, sports organizations, and conservationists working on programmes to better the city.
In the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, a state of emergency was declared in Lod after Arab rioting led to the death of an Israeli Jew. The Mayor of Lod, Yair Revivio, urged Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu to deploy Israel Border Police to restore order in the city. This was the first time since 1966 that Israel had declared this kind of emergency lockdown. International media noted that both Jewish and Palestinian mobs were active in Lod, but the &quot;crackdown came for one side&quot; only.

==Demographics==

In the 19th century and until the Lydda Death March, Lod was an exclusively Muslim-Christian town, with an estimated 6,850 inhabitants, of whom approximately 2,000 (29%) were Christian.

According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the population of Lod in 2010 was 69,500 people.

According to the 2019 census, the population of Lod was 77,223, of which 53,581 people, comprising 69.4% of the city&#x27;s population, were classified as &quot;Jews and Others&quot;, and 23,642 people, comprising 30.6% as &quot;Arab&quot;.

==Education==
According to CBS, 38 schools and 13,188 pupils are in the city. They are spread out as 26 elementary schools and 8,325 elementary school pupils, and 13 high schools and 4,863 high school pupils. About 52.5% of 12th-grade pupils were entitled to a matriculation certificate in 2001.

==Economy==
The airport and related industries are a major source of employment for the residents of Lod. Other important factories in the city are the communication equipment company &quot;Talard&quot;, &quot;Cafe-Co&quot; - a subsidiary of the Strauss Group and &quot;Kashev&quot; - the computer center of Bank Leumi.

A Jewish Agency Absorption Centre is also located in Lod. According to CBS figures for 2000, 23,032 people were salaried workers and 1,405 were self-employed. The mean monthly wage for a salaried worker was NIS 4,754, a real change of 2.9% over the course of 2000. Salaried men had a mean monthly wage of NIS 5,821 (a real change of 1.4%) versus NIS 3,547 for women (a real change of 4.6%). The mean income for the self-employed was NIS 4,991. About 1,275 people were receiving unemployment benefits and 7,145 were receiving an income supplement.

==Art and culture==
In 2009-2010, Dor Guez held an exhibit, &quot;Georgeopolis&quot;, at the Petach Tikva art museum that focuses on Lod.

==Archaeology==

A well-preserved mosaic floor dating to the Roman period was excavated in 1996 as part of a salvage dig conducted on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Municipality of Lod, prior to widening HeHalutz Street. According to
Jacob Fisch, executive director of the Friends of the Israel Antiquities Authority, a worker at the construction site noticed the tail of a tiger and halted work. The mosaic was initially covered over with soil at the conclusion of the excavation for lack of funds to conserve and develop the site. The mosaic is now part of the Lod Mosaic Archaeological Center. The floor, with its colorful display of birds, fish, exotic animals and merchant ships, is believed to have been commissioned by a wealthy resident of the city for his private home. 

The Lod Community Archaeology Program, which operates in ten Lod schools, five Jewish and five Israeli Arab, combines archaeological studies with participation in digs in Lod.

==Sports==
The city&#x27;s major football club, Hapoel Bnei Lod, plays in Liga Leumit (the second division). Its home is at the Lod Municipal Stadium. The club was formed by a merger of Bnei Lod and Rakevet Lod in the 1980s. Two other clubs in the city play in the regional leagues: Hapoel MS Ortodoxim Lod in Liga Bet and Maccabi Lod in Liga Gimel.

Hapoel Lod played in the top division during the 1960s and 1980s, and won the State Cup in 1984. The club folded in 2002. A new club, Hapoel Maxim Lod (named after former mayor Maxim Levy) was established soon after, but folded in 2007.

<text>Migdal HaEmek (, lit. &quot;Tower of the Valley&quot;, also officially spelled Migdal HaEmeq, ) is a city in the Northern District of Israel. In it had a population of . 

Migdal HaEmek was established in 1953 as a ma&#x27;abara for Jews from Arab countries, before becoming a development town. The original site of the ma&#x27;abara was west of the current site, at Shimron hill. There is a tower to the north-east, above the town.

Many Israeli and global high tech companies are located in three industrial parks. Among the companies: Tower Semiconductor, RSL Electronics, KLA-Tencor, CI Systems, Nilit, Vishay Intertechnology, Enzymotec and Flex.

==History==
===Pre-1948===
A Roman road ran nearby, with traces found close to the former village of al-Mujaydil. This may indicate that the region was opened to intensive settlement during the Roman period.

Prior to 1953, in the area where Migdal HaEmek was to be established, stood the former Arab Palestinian village of al-Mujaydil. It had existed there since at least 1596 during the Ottoman period. In July 1948 al-Mujaydil was completely destroyed due to aerial bombing during the operations conducted by the Golani Brigade, when the villagers fled, resulting in its depopulation.

===Migdal HaEmek (est. 1953)===
Migdal HaEmek was established in 1953 as a ma&#x27;abara for Jews from Arab countries, before becoming a development town. The original site of the ma&#x27;abara was west of the current site, at Shimron hill.

In 1959, during the Wadi Salib riots, the &quot;&quot;Union des Nords-africains&quot; led by David Ben Haroush, organised a large-scale procession walking towards the nice suburbs of Haifa creating little damages but a great fear within the population. This small incident was taken as an occasion to express the social malaise of the different Oriental communities in Israel and riots spread quickly to other parts of the country; mostly in towns with a high percentage of the population having North African extraction like in Tiberias, in Beer-Sheva, in Migdal HaEmek.&quot;

The chief rabbi of the city is Rabbi Yitzchak Dovid Grossman, who won the Israel Prize in 2004 for his social service work and outreach youth programs. Every year volunteers from Habonim Dror come to Migdal HaEmek to volunteer in the community.

== Demographics ==
According to CBS, in 2001 the ethnic makeup of the city was all Jewish and &quot;other&quot; non-Arabs.
There were 11,900 males and 12,200 females. More recently the Jewish Agency estimated Migdal HaEmek&#x27;s population at 28,000, almost half foreign-born, from Russia, the Caucasus, Ethiopia, Morocco, Iraq and South America.

== Education ==
According to CBS, there were 22 schools and 5,777 students in the city in 2001: 13 elementary schools (2,995 students), and 2 high schools (2,782 students). 47.8% of 12th grade students qualified for a matriculation certificate in 2001.

== Economy==
Many Israeli and global high tech companies are located in three industrial parks. Among the companies: Tower Semiconductor (foundry), RSL Electronics (Control and Diagnostic solutions for defence and commercial applications ), KLA-Tencor (inspection tools), CI Systems (electro-optical test systems, non contact temperature sensors and wet chemistry analyzers), Nilit (Nylon for textile industry and thermoplastics for industrial and commercial applications), Vishay Intertechnology (discrete and passive semiconductors components), Enzymotec (functional lipids) and Flex (Electronics contract manufacturer).

==Notable people==
*Haim Dayan (born 1960), former politician
*Naama Lazimi (born 1986), member of the Knesset
*Rabbi Nachman Bulman, who founded an Orthodox community there

<doc id="323328" wikidata="Q200774" url="?curid=323328" title="Follicle-stimulating hormone">
<text>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a gonadotropin, a glycoprotein polypeptide hormone. FSH is synthesized and secreted by the gonadotropic cells of the anterior pituitary gland and regulates the development, growth, pubertal maturation, and reproductive processes of the body. FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) work together in the reproductive system.

== Structure ==

FSH is a 35.5 kDa glycoprotein heterodimer, consisting of two polypeptide units, alpha and beta. Its structure is similar to those of luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The alpha subunits of the glycoproteins LH, FSH, TSH, and hCG are identical and consist of 96 amino acids, while the beta subunits vary. Both subunits are required for biological activity. FSH has a beta subunit of 111 amino acids (FSH β), which confers its specific biologic action, and is responsible for interaction with the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor. The sugar portion of the hormone is covalently bonded to asparagine, and is composed of N-acetylgalactosamine, mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and sialic acid.

==Genes==

In humans, the gene for the alpha subunit is located at cytogenetic location 6q14.3. It is expressed in two cell types, most notably the basophils of the anterior pituitary. The gene for the FSH beta subunit is located on chromosome 11p13, and is expressed in gonadotropes of the pituitary cells, controlled by GnRH, inhibited by inhibin, and enhanced by activin.

==Activity and functions==
FSH regulates the development, growth, pubertal maturation and reproductive processes of the human body.
* In both &quot;males&quot; and &quot;females&quot;, FSH stimulates the maturation of primordial germ cells.
* In &quot;males&quot;, FSH induces Sertoli cells to secrete androgen-binding proteins (ABPs), regulated by inhibin&#x27;s negative feedback mechanism on the anterior pituitary. Specifically, activation of Sertoli cells by FSH sustains spermatogenesis and stimulates inhibin B secretion.
* In &quot;females&quot;, FSH initiates follicular growth, specifically affecting granulosa cells. With the concomitant rise in inhibin B, FSH levels then decline in the late follicular phase. This seems to be critical in selecting only the most advanced follicle to proceed to ovulation. At the end of the luteal phase, there is a slight rise in FSH that seems to be of importance to start the next ovulatory cycle.

Control of FSH release from the pituitary gland is unknown. Low frequency gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulses increase FSH mRNA levels in the rat, but is not directly correlated with an increase in circulating FSH. GnRH has been shown to play an important role in the secretion of FSH, with hypothalamic-pituitary disconnection leading to a cessation of FSH. GnRH administration leads to a return of FSH secretion. FSH is subject to oestrogen feed-back from the gonads via the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis.

===Effects in females===
FSH stimulates the growth and recruitment of immature ovarian follicles in the ovary. In early (small) antral follicles, FSH is the major survival factor that rescues the small antral follicles (2–5 mm in diameter for humans) from apoptosis (programmed death of the somatic cells of the follicle and oocyte). In the luteal-follicle phase transition period the serum levels of progesterone and estrogen (primarily estradiol) decrease and no longer suppress the release of FSH, consequently FSH peaks at about day three (day one is the first day of menstrual flow). The cohort of small antral follicles is normally sufficient in number to produce enough Inhibin B to lower FSH serum levels.

In addition, there is evidence that gonadotropin surge-attenuating factor produced by small follicles during the first half of the follicle phase also exerts a negative feedback on pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion amplitude, thus allowing a more favorable environment for follicle growth and preventing premature luteinization.

As a woman nears perimenopause, the number of small antral follicles recruited in each cycle diminishes and consequently insufficient Inhibin B is produced to fully lower FSH and the serum level of FSH begins to rise. Eventually, the FSH level becomes so high that downregulation of FSH receptors occurs and by postmenopause any remaining small secondary follicles no longer have FSH nor LH receptors.

When the follicle matures and reaches 8–10 mm in diameter it starts to secrete significant amounts of estradiol. Normally in humans only one follicle becomes dominant and survives to grow to 18–30 mm in size and ovulate, the remaining follicles in the cohort undergo atresia. The sharp increase in estradiol production by the dominant follicle (possibly along with a decrease in gonadotrophin surge-attenuating factor) cause a positive effect on the hypothalamus and pituitary and rapid GnRH pulses occur and an LH surge results.

The increase in serum estradiol levels causes a decrease in FSH production by inhibiting GnRH production in the hypothalamus.

The decrease in serum FSH level causes the smaller follicles in the current cohort to undergo atresia as they lack sufficient sensitivity to FSH to survive. Occasionally two follicles reach the 10 mm stage at the same time by chance and as both are equally sensitive to FSH both survive and grow in the low FSH environment and thus two ovulations can occur in one cycle possibly leading to non-identical (dizygotic) twins.

===Effects in males===
FSH stimulates primary spermatocytes to undergo the first division of meiosis, to form secondary spermatocytes.

FSH enhances the production of androgen-binding protein by the Sertoli cells of the testes by binding to FSH receptors on their basolateral membranes, and is critical for the initiation of spermatogenesis.

==Measurement==

Follicle-stimulating hormone is typically measured in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, typically day three to five, counted from last menstruation. At this time, the levels of estradiol (E2) and progesterone are at the lowest point of the menstrual cycle. FSH levels in this time is often called &quot;basal FSH&quot; levels, to distinguish from the increased levels when approaching ovulation.

FSH is measured in international units (IU). For Human Urinary FSH, one IU is defined as the amount of FSH that has an activity corresponding to 0.11388 mg of pure Human Urinary FSH. For recombinant FSH, one IU corresponds to approximately 0.065 to 0.075 μg of a &quot;fill-by-mass&quot; product.
The mean values for women before ovulation are around (3.8-8.8) IU/L. After ovulation these levels drop to between (1.8-5.1) IU/L. At the mid of the menstrual cycle it reaches its highest value, between (4.5-22.5) IU/L. During menopause, the values goes up even more, between (16.74-113.59) IU/L.
For men, the mean values are around (16.74-113.59) IU/L.

==Disease states==
FSH levels are normally low during childhood and, in females, high after menopause.

===High FSH levels===

The most common reason for high serum FSH concentration is in a female who is undergoing or has recently undergone menopause. High levels of FSH indicate that the normal restricting feedback from the gonad is absent, leading to an unrestricted pituitary FSH production. FSH may contribute to postmenopausal osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.

If high FSH levels occur during the reproductive years, it is abnormal. Conditions with high FSH levels include:

# Premature menopause also known as premature ovarian failure
# Poor ovarian reserve also known as premature ovarian aging
# Gonadal dysgenesis, Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome
# Castration
# Swyer syndrome
# Certain forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia
# Testicular failure
# Lupus

Most of these conditions are associated with subfertility or infertility. Therefore, high FSH levels are an indication of subfertility or infertility.

===Low FSH levels===

Diminished secretion of FSH can result in failure of gonadal function (hypogonadism). This condition is typically manifested in males as failure in production of normal numbers of sperm. In females, cessation of reproductive cycles is commonly observed.
Conditions with very low FSH secretions are:
# Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
# Polycystic ovarian syndrome + obesity + hirsutism + infertility
# Kallmann syndrome
# Aromatase excess syndrome
# Hypothalamic suppression
# Hypopituitarism
# Hyperprolactinemia
# Gonadotropin deficiency
# Gonadal suppression therapy
## GnRH antagonist
## GnRH agonist (downregulation).

Isolated FSH deficiency due to mutations in the gene for β-subunit of FSH is rare with 13 cases reported in the literature up to 2019.

==Use as therapy==

FSH is used commonly in infertility therapy, mainly for ovarian hyperstimulation as part of IVF. In some cases, it is used in ovulation induction for reversal of anovulation as well.

FSH is available mixed with LH activity in various menotropins including more purified forms of urinary gonadotropins such as Menopur, as well as without LH activity as recombinant FSH (Gonapure, Gonal F, Follistim, Follitropin alpha).

==Potential role in vascularization of solid tumors==

Elevated FSH receptor levels have been detected in the endothelia of tumor vasculature in a very wide range of solid tumors. FSH binding is thought to upregulate neovascularization via at least two mechanisms – one in the VEGF pathway, and the other VEGF independent – related to the development of umbilical vasculature when physiological. This presents possible use of FSH and FSH-receptor antagonists as an anti-tumor angiogenesis therapy (cf. avastin for current anti-VEGF approaches).

<text>Ma&#x27;ale Adumim (; ) is an urban Israeli settlement organized as a city council in the West Bank, seven kilometers () east of Jerusalem. Ma&#x27;ale Adumim achieved city status in 1991. In 2015, its population was . It is located along Highway 1, which connects it to Jerusalem and the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area. 
The international community holds that Israeli settlements in the West Bank, within Israel, termed Judea and Samaria, are illegal under international law. Israel does not agree with this view and the position of successive Israeli governments is that all authorized settlements are legal and consistent with international law.

==Etymology==
The town name is taken from two mentions made of an area marking the boundaries between two Israelite tribes in the Book of Joshua. At , in a passage on the inheritance of the Tribe of Judah, it is stated that part of the boundary ran from Debir to Gilgal, facing the &quot;ascent of Adumim&quot;, which the text places south of the wadi. At , in a description of the inheritance by the casting of lots that fell to Tribe of Benjamin, it is stated that part of its boundaries ran from En-shemesh then to Geliloth, which likewise faced the &quot;ascent of Adummim&quot;.

The toponym literally means &#x27;Red Ascent&#x27; or &#x27;Bloody Ascent&#x27; referring to the hue of the exposed red limestone rocks, tinted by iron oxide, that in patches line the ascent from the Dead Sea towards Jerusalem.

==History==

=== First displacement of Bedouin tribes ===
The Jahalin and Sawahareh Bedouin tribes, evicted by Israel from their traditional pastoral lands in the Tel Arad area of the Negev, settled in the area of what would become the Ma&#x27;ale Adumim municipality, then under Jordanian administration, after contracting with local Palestinian landowners and receiving permission to graze their livestock there. After the Israeli conquest and occupation of the West Bank in the Six-Day War in 1967, they were gradually hemmed in by restrictions, due to pressures from the development of the Israeli settlement, many ending up in tracts of land in the vicinity of the Jericho-Jerusalem road or a rubbish dump near Abu Dis.

=== Initiation of Israeli settlement ===
As early as 1968, just after the Six-Day War, Yigal Allon had advanced a proposal to establish a settlement somewhere in the area of Ma&#x27;ale Adumim and Jericho. The government of Levi Eshkol did not implement the step, because the political and diplomatic implications were significant, in that it would effectively split the West Bank. It was later opposed by Yehiel Admoni, the then head of the Jewish Agency for Israel&#x27;s Settlement Department, as lying outside the scope of the Allon Plan, and if the &#x27;Red Ascent&#x27; were settled, it would further erode what land might remain over for restoring territory to the Palestinians in a future peace negotiation.

The idea of making an industrial park for Jerusalem in the area of Ma&#x27;ale Adumim had been circulating for some years. In August 1974, Yisrael Galili, a major presence in the settlement project together with Meir Zorea with strong connections to Gush Emunim, aired the idea of settling it. He had privately offered it as a recompense for settlers who had attempted to establish themselves in Sebastia, to be rebuffed when that group refused to compromise. The links with Gush Emunim attested to a growing impact of Religious Zionist ideology on Israel&#x27;s developing policies regarding the Palestinian territories. It is thought that the agreement to develop an industrial zone for Jerusalem there was the result of a deal struck between the National Religious Party and the government of Yitzhak Rabin, as part of a bargain between members of the coalition government, for which the green light was given on 24 November 1975. This government strategy to create &quot;facts on the ground&quot; was a response to the Rabat Summit decision in Morocco in October to recognize the PLO as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. It was decided to permit 25 residential units to house 100 Israeli settlers/workers.

=== Development of the settlement ===
Problems existed from the start, since there were no budget funds allocated for the project, and ministers opposed it either on financial grounds or out of suspicions that its creation had nothing to do with the establishment of an industrial town, but masked an intention to make a civilian settlement, something opposed by Mapam. Whatever monies were used, Yossi Sarid complained, would detract from funds targeted for Israel&#x27;s own impoverished development towns. The evidence suggests that the decision was inspired more by political needs, including the perceived need to placate far-right groups, rather than respond to the requirements of the city of Jerusalem. Gershom Gorenberg argues that the cabinet compromise was &#x27;a ruse&#x27; that spoke of setting up factory housing when in fact the aim was to create a fully fledged settlement afterwards. Galili himself argued that a settlement between Jericho and East Jerusalem was needed to keep Jordanians away from the Holy City. In an interview several decades later, the mayor of one of the larger settlements claimed that the aim of establishing Ma&#x27;ale Adumim was to &#x27;protect Jerusalem from Arabs&#x27; and secure the road to the Jordan Valley.

According to the Jerusalem Post, the site had served as a Nahal military outpost, before being designated to become an Israeli labourers&#x27; camp. The outpost&#x27;s establishment was delayed for political reasons, despite the November decision. Yigal Allon was due to meet Henry Kissinger in Washington and any leak of a new settlement would have been inconvenient at that time. Galili said the timing for the setting up of camps on the site should coincide with Kissinger&#x27;s movements, timing it so that the latter&#x27;s shuttle diplomacy would find him in transit to Brussels. Finally, around March 1975, following a ministerial decree to expropriate 3,000 hectares of land from the area&#x27;s Palestinian villages, forty members of Gush Emunim built a water tower and prefab concrete hut on the site, only to be evicted the same afternoon by Israeli troops, each prospective settler carried away by four soldiers. This site was thereafter called by the settlers &quot;Founder&#x27;s Circle&quot;. In 1977, Haim Sabato founded a hesder yeshiva (paramilitary field seminary) there and it was also designated to become a planned community, suburb and commuter town for nearby Jerusalem, to which many residents would commute daily.

The boundaries of the settlement were set at some 3,500 hectares in 1979 and by the early 90s had extended to 4,350 hectares. Writing in 2003, Cheryl Rubenberg stated that
For the bedouins, as well as for the villagers, loss of their lands meant loss of their agricultural way of life and major transformations in their social life. Today, the area available to the villages together, with a population of approximately 40,000, is some 460 hectares. The area of Ma&#x27;ale Adumim with some 26,000 settlers, is 11.5 times greater.

=== Displacement of Jahalin Bedouins in 1990s ===
In the late 1990s, approximately 1,050 Jahalin Bedouins were displaced from land that was now annexed to form part of the settlement. Sewage was used as a tool for displacement. The Israeli Civil Administration disconnected one of the sewage pipes of the Ma&#x27;ale Adumim settlement on the hilltop to flood large areas around the Bedouin camp on the lower slopes of the hill. Streams and ponds of polluted matter forced the tribe to relocate.

Court orders required compensation by the Israeli government and they received cash, electricity and water supplies. According to the residents, they had to sell most of their livestock and their Bedouin way of life was forcibly ended.

=== Attack and planned expansion ===

After Palestinian gunmen killed one Israeli and injured five Israelis near Ma&#x27;ale Adumim, Israel&#x27;s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich in February 2024 announced a &quot;settlement response&quot; after speaking to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as &quot;any harm to us will lead to more construction and more development and more of our hold all over the country&quot;, with 2,350 more homes in Ma&#x27;ale Adumim being arranged for approval. American Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized the announcement, stating that new Israeli settlements are &quot;inconsistent with international law&quot; and &quot;counter-productive to reaching an enduring peace&quot;, risking &quot;Israel’s security&quot;. &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported that Israel&#x27;s government in March 2024 progressed the approval of 2,452 more settler homes in Ma&#x27;ale Adumim.

==Urban plans==
The chief urban planner was architect Rachel Walden. In March 1979, Ma&#x27;ale Adumim achieved local council status. The urban plan for Ma&#x27;ale Adumim, finalized in 1983, encompasses a total of , of which have been built so far, in a bloc that includes Ma&#x27;ale Adumim, Mishor Adumim, Kfar Adumim, and Allon.

== Politics ==
The mayor of Ma&#x27;ale Adumim is Benny Kashriel, who was recently elected to a third term by a large majority.
Today, according to Nathan Thrall:
Although the bloc itself is not officially annexed to Israel, Jewish immigrants from Los Angeles or London may move directly to it, or to any other settlement, and receive a basket of government aid that includes free air travel, a financial grant, subsistence allowances for one year, rent subsidies, low-interest mortgages, Hebrew instruction, tuition benefits, tax discounts, and reduced fees at state-recognized day care centers, of which the bloc contains several. 

==Geography==
The city is surrounded on four sides by the Judean Desert and is linked to Jerusalem and the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area via Highway 1. Due to its strategic location between the northern and southern parts of the West Bank, Palestinians see this as a threat to the territorial continuity of a future Palestinian state. This claim is disputed by mayor Benny Kashriel, who claims that continuity would be attained by circling Ma&#x27;ale Adumim to the east. Israeli drivers use a bypass road that exits the city to the west, entering Jerusalem through the French Hill Junction or a tunnel that goes under Mt. Scopus. These routes were built in the wake of the First and Second Intifadas when Palestinian militants shot at motorists and cars were stoned. The previous road passed through al-Eizariya and Abu Dis.

==Economy==

Many residents of Ma&#x27;ale Adumim are employed in Jerusalem. Others work in Mishor Adumim, Ma&#x27;ale Adumim&#x27;s industrial park, which is located on the road to the Dead Sea, about ten minutes from Jerusalem. The industrial zone houses 220 businesses, among them textile plants, garages, food manufacturers, aluminum and metalworking factories, and printing companies.

==Demographics==
In 2004, over 70 percent of the residents were secular. According to the municipal spokesman, the overwhelming majority moved to the city not for ideological reasons but for lower-cost housing and higher living standards. In 2004, 48 percent of residents were under the age of 18. Ma&#x27;aleh Adumim&#x27;s unemployment rate was 2.1 percent, far below the national average.

==Education and culture==

In 2011, Ma&#x27;ale Adumim had 21 schools and 80 kindergartens. A large portion of Ma&#x27;ale Adumim&#x27;s budget is spent on education. Schools offer after-school programs, class trips, and tutoring, where needed. A special program has been developed for new immigrant children. Additional resources are invested in special education and classes for gifted children, including a special after-school program for honors students in science and math. Ma&#x27;ale Adumim College was situated in the city, but is currently defunct. Religious elementary schools in Ma&#x27;ale Adumim include Ma&#x27;aleh Hatorah, Sde Chemed, and Tzemach Hasadeh. Religious high schools are Yeshiva Tichonit, Tzvia and Amit. The city has over 40 synagogues and several yeshivas, among them Yeshivat Birkat Moshe. Ma&#x27;ale Adumim has won the Israel Ministry of Education prize for excellence twice. It has also won the national prize for environmental quality in recognition of its emphasis on urban planning, green space, playgrounds and outdoor sculptures.

==Healthcare==
Medical services are provided in the city through all four Health maintenance organizations (&quot;kupot holim&quot;). There is also a large geriatric hospital, Hod Adumim, providing care for recuperating patients and chronic patients. It is also used for senior citizens residence. It has facilities for nursing, the elderly, the handicapped, through the most extreme needs.

==Legality==

According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from the following Palestinian villages in order to construct Ma&#x27;ale Adumim:
*4,217 dunams from al-Eizariya,
*1,031 dunams from Abu Dis,
*406 dunams from az-Za&#x27;ayyem,
*2 dunams from Isawiya.
Peace Now, citing official government documents, stated that 0.5% of Ma&#x27;ale Adumim was privately owned Palestinian land. Israel asserts that Ma&#x27;ale Adumin was built on &quot;state lands,&quot; or areas not registered in anyone&#x27;s name, and that no private property was being seized for building. Palestinians say lands from the villages of Abu Dis, al-Eizariya, Al-Issawiya, At-Tur and &#x27;Anata were expropriated for building in Ma&#x27;ale Adumim.

The Israeli human rights organisation B&#x27;Tselem criticizes: &quot;The expropriation procedure used in Ma&#x27;ale Adummim is unprecedented in the settlement enterprise. Expropriation of land for settlement purposes is forbidden, not only under international law but also according to the long-standing, official position of Israeli governments. Most settlements were built on area that was declared state land or on land that was requisitioned - ostensibly temporarily - for military purposes. It appears that in Ma&#x27;ale Adummim, the government decided to permanently expropriate the land because it viewed the area as an integral part of Jerusalem that would forever remain under Israeli control.&quot;

In 2005, a report by John Dugard for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights stated that the &quot;three major settlement blocs—Gush Etzion, Ma&#x27;ale Adumim and Ariel—will effectively divide Palestinian territory into cantons or Bantustans.&quot; Israel says the solution is a bypass road similar to those used daily by Israelis to avoid driving through hostile Arab areas. The 2007 development project in east Ma&#x27;ale Adumim was supported by Ariel Sharon in 2005. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev denied the 2007 extension plan is a violation of the roadmap peace plan, under which Israel agreed to freeze all building in the settlements.

In 2008, a project to link Ma&#x27;ale Adumim and Jerusalem, known as the E1 project—short for &quot;East 1&quot;, as it appears on old zoning maps—was criticized by the Palestinian Authority, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and US President George W. Bush. As a result, a plan for 3,500-5,000 homes in Mevaseret Adumim was frozen. The new Judea and Samaria District police headquarters, formerly located in the Ras el-Amud neighborhood of Jerusalem, was completed in May 2008.

Ma&#x27;ale Adumim is widely regarded by the international community as illegal under international law according to the Fourth Geneva Convention (article 49), which prohibits an occupying power transferring citizens from its own territory to occupied territory. Israel maintains that international conventions relating to occupied land do not apply to the West Bank because they were not under the legitimate sovereignty of any state in the first place. This view was rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

==Housing shortage==

One of the purposes of establishing Ma&#x27;ale Adumim was to supply affordable housing for young couples who could not afford the high cost of homes in Jerusalem. Although the municipal boundaries cover 48,000 dunams, the city has been suffering from an acute housing shortage since 2009 due to the freeze on new construction. most of the real estate market was in second-hand properties. 

==Archaeology==

* The Byzantine monastery of Martyrius, once the most important monastic centre in the Judean Desert in the early Christian era, is located in Ma&#x27;ale Adumim.

Other archaeological sites on the outskirts of Ma&#x27;ale Adumim include:

* Khan el-Hatruri, also known as the Good Samaritan Inn (traditionally associated with an inn mentioned in a parable by Jesus, in )
* The remains of the Monastery of St. Euthymius, built in the 5th century and destroyed by the Mamluk sultan Baybars. It is known in Arabic as Khan al-Ahmar, since the buildings were repurposed in the 13th-century as a caravanserai for Muslim pilgrims on the route between Jerusalem and Mecca via Nabi Musa.

==Landmarks==

The Moshe Castel Museum showcases the work of Israeli artist Moshe Castel.

The Tree of Life is the world&#x27;s largest artistic representation of an Olive Tree. The model for the tree was a five hundred year old Olive Tree from the Garden of Gethsemane. The Tree is the artistic creation of Jerusalem artist Sam Philipe. The site is a venue for outdoor programming and weddings. 

Mizpe Edna is a lookout at the Shofar and Hallil junction.

<text>Ma&#x27;alot-Tarshiha (; ) is a city in the North District in Israel, about east of Nahariya, and about above sea level. The city was established in 1963 through a municipal merger of the Arab town of Tarshiha and the Jewish town of Ma&#x27;alot, creating a unique type of mixed city. In , it had a population of .

==History==

===Tarshiha===
Excavations of a 4th-century burial cave in the village, unearthed a cross and a piece of glass engraved with a menorah.

Crusader sources from the 12th and 13th century refer to Tarshiha as &quot;Terschia,&quot; &quot;Torsia&quot;, and &quot;Tersigha.&quot; The King had initiated the settlement of Crusader (&quot;Latin&quot;, &quot;Frankish&quot;) people in nearby Mi&#x27;ilya (&quot;Castellum Regis&quot;), and from there settlement spread out to Tarshiha. In 1160, &quot;Torsia&quot; and several surrounding villages were transferred to a Crusader named &quot;Iohanni de Caypha&quot; (Johannes of Haifa).
By 1217, the village was probably inhabited by Crusader (&quot;Frankish&quot;) people. In 1220 Joscelin III´s daughter Beatrix de Courtenay and her husband Otto von Botenlauben, Count of Henneberg, sold their land, including &quot;Tersyha&quot;, to the Teutonic Knights. 
In 1266, Tarshiha was raided by Crusader troops.

According to popular Arabic etymology, the name may have meant &quot;Artemisia Mountain&quot; in the Canaanite language, where Arabic &quot;ṭūr&quot; for &quot;mountain&quot; and &quot;shīḥ&quot; for &quot;Artemisia vulgaris&quot; (mugwort, or common wormwood) could be identified. E. H. Palmer (1881) explains the name as &quot;Teir&quot; meaning &quot;a fortress&quot;, and &quot;Shīḥ&quot;, &quot;a fragrant herb&quot;.

====Ottoman era====
Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with the rest of Palestine, the village of Tarshiha was raided by the Lebanese feudal chief, Mansur ibn Furaykh in 1573. The daftar of 1596 show the village to be under the administration of the &quot;nahiya&quot; of Akka, with a population of 107 households (&quot;khana&quot;) and 3 bachelors, all Muslim. The inhabitants paid taxes on &quot;occasional revenues&quot;, bees and goats. The village was also taxed for a press, used either of olives or for grapes. Total revenue was 17,660 akçe.

In the early eighteenth century, the village was under control of Shaikh Husayn, while later in the Ottoman period it became one of the major cotton-producing villages of Galilee, and the administrative center of the &quot;nahiya&quot;. Mariti visited the village (which he called &quot;Terschia&quot;) in 1761, and wrote that it &quot;abounds with water; which adds greatly to the fertility of its cotton plants, its fruit-trees, and above all its tobacco&quot;.

Victor Guérin, who visited in 1875, found that Tarshiha &quot;consists of four quarters, under the jurisdiction of as many different sheikhs. There are 2,000 Moslems, who have their mosques. The Christians occupy their own quarters: with the exception of a few families they are all Uniate Melkite Greeks, and number about 500.&quot; In 1881 the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described Tarshiha as: &quot;a very large village, containing about 1,500 Moslems and 300 Christians; there is a fine mosque with minarets newly built, also an old one; the houses are well-built; a new and handsome church has been built in the Christian quarter&quot;.

In 1883, Laurence Oliphant visited and wrote that &quot;Tershicha&quot; was home to around 2,000 people, most of whom were followers of Ali Al-Mughrabi, an Islamic sheikh and reformer who immigrated from North Africa.

A population list from about 1887 showed &quot;Tarshiha&quot; to have about 4,855 inhabitants; 4,000 Muslims and 855 Christian.

====British Mandate era====

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Tarsheha&quot; had a population of 1,880 residents; 1,521 Muslims, 358 Christians and 1 Druze, where the Christians were 298 Melkite, 53 Orthodox and 7 Church of England. The population had increased in the 1931 census to a total of 2522; 2047 Muslims and 475 Christians, in a total of 584 houses.

In the 1945 statistics the population of Tarshiha was 3,840; 3140 Muslims and 690 Christians. The total population of Tarshiha combined with Al-Kabri was 5,360 Arabs, with 47,428 dunams of land. Of this, a total of 743 dunums of land in the two places was used for citrus and bananas, 5,301 were plantation and irrigable land, 14,123 for cereals, while 252 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

Residents of Ma&#x27;alot-Tarshiha interviewed in early 1980s recalled Tarshiha as being the leading village in the area with a population of 3,000 including 700 Christians. The Christians had established a successful handcrafts industry. The villages main crop was tobacco. There was a tobacco growers union which ran a trucking cooperative. In the mid-1930s it was learnt that the Sursock family were going to sell land in the Jaqtoun valley. A delegation from the village travelled to Beirut and was able to buy the land. After clearing and draining it was divided into plots which were distributed by lottery to the participating families. Tarshiha was the first Palestinian village to establish a development fund by collecting £1 a year from each adult male resident.

Tarshiha played a role in the Syrian campaign or operation &quot;Exporter&quot; during World War II, which was the invasion of the Allies of the Grand Syria (currently Syria and Lebanon), at the time controlled by the Vichy government, between June and July 1941 when the region of Grand Syria served as a base for supporting the Nazis during the Anglo-Iraqi War. On the day of the liberation of Tyre, 8 June 1941, the advance of the Australians &quot;took place from the ground early in the morning on Sunday. The main push was in the direction of Tarshiha from the north. It started at 6 in the morning and Tyre was occupied at 16.30.&quot;

====1948 Palestine war====

Tarshiha was in the territory allotted to the Palestinians under the 1947 UN Partition Plan.

Following the establishment of the state of Israel Tarshiha was surrounded on three sides by the Israeli army and the border with Lebanon to the North. Tarshiha and sixteen smaller villages established a regional committee which organised the reopening of schools, regulated imports from Lebanon as well as attending to security and defence.

In the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Tarshiha was attacked by the newly formed Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during Operation Hiram. It was bombed by three Israeli planes on the evening of 29 October, killing at least 24. This was followed by a prolonged artillery barrage and a further air raid the following morning. The village defenders and most of the inhabitants retreated north into Lebanon. By the end of the day the IDF had captured the town. A UN observer reported that on 1 November 1948 the Arab villages around Tarshiha were deserted and extensively looted by Israeli forces. &quot;The New York Times&quot; added that the looting appeared systematic, as Israeli army trucks were used carrying off the looted goods. By December 1948 around 700 villagers, mostly Christians, had returned to the village. Families from Tarshiha began arriving in Beirut shortly after the conquest of the village and lived in rented rooms around Bourj el Barajneh which at that time was a suburb on the fringe of the city. About half of the 3,000 villagers arriving in Lebanon settled there in what became Bourj al Barajneh refugee camp. They took on most of the leadership roles and remained the majority population for many years. In 1981 it was estimated 4–5,000 Tarshihans were living in the camp. Those villagers who were unable to reach Beirut in 1948 were rounded up and sent by train to Aleppo were they became the largest group in al-Neirab Camp.

Any Arab who had not registered, as of November 1948, was regarded as illegal and if caught deported. An American Quaker relief worker with the American Friends Service Committee described a raid on Tarshiha on 15 January 1949. All males over sixteen were questioned by a panel of eight Israelis. 33 heads of families and 101 family members, aged 1 year to 79 years, were selected for deportation. They were robbed and expelled via &#x27;Ara to Jenin. A UN observer in Jenin reported that their homes were being re-populated by large numbers of Jewish refugees from Austria.

===Israel===

The abandoned houses in Tarshiha were initially taken over by Jews from Romania. When they were moved on to new settlements the houses were demolished. Around 600 villagers remained after 1948. They were joined by others expelled from nine other local villages. In December 1949 the Israeli Foreign Ministry blocked an IDF plan to clear Tarshiha and five other villages along the Lebanon border of their remaining Arab populations to create an Arab-free zone. Arabs in the Galilee remained under Martial Law until 1966.

====Ma&#x27;alot-Tarshiha merger====
In 1963, Tarshiha was merged with Ma&#x27;alot, a development town for Jewish immigrants from Romania, Iran and Morocco, established in 1957.

On 15 May 1974, an elementary school in Ma&#x27;alot was attacked by terrorists of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine in what became known as the Ma&#x27;alot massacre. Twenty-two teenagers and three teachers from Safed on a class trip were murdered in the attack. They had been sleeping on the floor inside the building. In addition, three Israeli women, one of them seven months pregnant, one four-year-old child, and two men were killed by the same terrorists in the events before the murder of the school children.

A visitor in 1980 estimated that half of the 2,400 Arabs living in the town originated from Tarshiha. 70% of those with jobs worked in the building trade, none of them were farmers. The 3,500 Jewish residents were mostly Moroccan. Few of whom stayed for long periods. During the 1990s post-Soviet aliyah in the 1990s, many immigrants settled in the city. Ma&#x27;alot-Tarshiha was officially recognized as a city in 1996.

Victor Guérin, after his 1875 visit, wrote that the principal mosque in Tarshiha had been built by Abdullah Pasha, (the Governor of Acre at the time.) He further noted that it was &quot;preceded by a court, then by a porch; surmounted by a cupola, above which springs an elegant minaret.&quot; Andrew Petersen, who inspected the mosque in 1993, noted that it was built in &quot;classical Ottoman style with four main elements: a courtyard, an arcade, a domed prayer hall, and a minaret.&quot;

<text>Nahariya () is the northernmost coastal city in Israel. As of , the city had a population of .

The city was founded in 1935 by Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany.

==Etymology==
Nahariya takes its name from the stream of Ga&#x27;aton (river is &quot;nahar&quot; in Hebrew), which bisects it.

==History==
===Bronze Age===
The ruins of a 3,400-year-old Bronze Age citadel were found in the coastal city of Nahariya near the beach on Balfour Street, at a site known to archaeologists as &quot;Khirbet Kabarsa&quot;. The citadel was an administrative center serving the mariners who sailed along the Mediterranean coast. There is evidence of commercial and cultural relations with Cyprus and the rest of the Mediterranean region. The fortress was destroyed four times by conflagration and rebuilt each time.

===Byzantine period===

A church from the Byzantine period, dedicated to St. Lazarus, was excavated in the 1970s. It was destroyed by fire, probably at the time of the Persian invasion in 614.

===British Mandate of Palestine===

In 1934, work began to found Nahariya as an agricultural village by a company limited by shares and headed by the agronomist Dr. Selig Eugen Soskin (1873–1959), the civil engineer Joseph Loewy (1885–1949), the financial expert Heinrich Cohn (1895–1976) and the engineer Simon Reich (1883–1941). The company acquired an area of land by purchase from the Arab landowner family Toueini. After ameliorisation and parcelling, the plots were offered to new German Jewish immigrants who had escaped from Nazi persecution. The first residents, two German immigrant couples, permanently settled in Nahariya on February 10, 1935, which is now considered the official founding date of Nahariya. During the same year each couple had one child, the first children born in Nahariya. By the end of 1935 approximately 40 pioneers had settled in Nahariya. Settlement continued in 1936 and four more children were born there that year. While the first settlers lived in huts, the settlement was rapidly developed as houses were built and trees and gardens planted. The residents also took to raising chickens. 

After an accumulation of economic and climatic problems the residents soon realized that agriculture was impractical and chose to focus on tourism and the food industry. Nahariya was turned into a European-style resort town, taking advantage of the natural surroundings and beaches, and new inns were opened. Two prominent food manufacturers also set up shop: the Strauss company was founded as a commercial dairy by German immigrants in Nahariya, and the Soglowek family, which settled in Nahariya in 1937, opened a prominent butcher shop, and developed the &quot;Nahariya sausage&quot;. During the British Mandate of Palestine, many British officers coming from Khartoum stopped in Nahariya.

===State of Israel===

In 1948 when Israel was founded Nahariya had a population of . It became a development town in the 1950s after a ma&#x27;abara established nearby was integrated. The town hence became a home to many Jewish refugees from North Africa, the Middle East and Europe. It had a population of 9,800 in 1955, which had increased to 23,800 in 1972. During the 1990s, the city absorbed a significant number of immigrants from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Nahariya experienced a construction boom.

==== Israeli–Arab conflict ====

Due to its geographic location, down the coast from Israel&#x27;s border with Lebanon, Nahariya had been a frequent target of cross-border terrorist attacks by Palestinian militants, mortar attacks and Katyusha rocket fire during the 1970s. The most notable of those were the 1974 attack and the 1979 Nahariya attack.

During the 2006 Lebanon War in July–August 2006, Nahariya sustained a barrage of several hundreds of Katyusha rockets launched by Hezbollah from southern Lebanon. As a result, the city suffered multiple civilian casualties and 5 fatalities. Significant damage was also inflicted on property and physical infrastructure. Nahariya&#x27;s economy suffered a major blow, as two-thirds of the city&#x27;s population had to evacuate, with the rest spending weeks in bomb shelters.

During the Israel-Hamas war and the Israel–Lebanon border conflict during the war, there were many siren alerts throughout the city, due to bombardments and drone infiltrations, mainly from Hezbollah.

==Economy==
Nahariya is home to some of Israel&#x27;s leading entrepreneurs: the Strauss, Soglowek and Wertheimer families. Successful private sector industrial enterprises founded in Nahariya are the Strauss dairy company, Soglowek meat processing company, and Iscar—the high-precision metalworks and tool-making giant, which was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway for US$5 billion.

According to the CBS, as of 2000 there were 17,916 salaried workers in the city and 1,283 were self-employed. The mean monthly wage in 2000 for a salaried worker in the city was ILS 5,736, a real growth of 7.0% over the previous year. Salaried men have a mean monthly wage of ILS 7,353 (an increase of 7.6%) versus ILS 3,950 for women (increase of 2.5%). The mean income for the self-employed was 9,078. In the same year, there were 886 people who received unemployment benefits and 3,611 people living on fixed income (Social Security.)

==Tourism==
Sderot Ga&#x27;aton, the city&#x27;s main boulevard, runs east–west from the Coastal Highway junction to the sea, and is divided down the middle by the Ga&#x27;aton River. Shaded by the thick greenery of towering eucalyptus trees and lined with numerous shops, boutiques, open-air cafes, restaurants and ice cream parlors, Sderot Ga&#x27;aton is Nahariya&#x27;s main tourist attraction and its central business and entertainment district. The beach area is an attraction in its own right, with a public park, a waterfront promenade, two public beaches, several hotels, a small marina and a lively nightlife in the multitude of beachfront cafes, bars, restaurants and nightclubs.

==Transportation==

Highway 4, the coastal highway, is the main north–south road in the city. Highway 89 starts at the Nahariya Junction in the city, and connects it with the rest of the Upper Galilee and Safed. Nahariya&#x27;s public transportation hub is located at the eastern end of Sderot Ga&#x27;aton, near the intersection with Highway 4, and contains the city&#x27;s train station and central bus station. Nahariya&#x27;s train station is the northernmost station of the Israel Railways network. Sderot Ga&#x27;aton runs westward where the mouth of the Ga&#x27;aton River spills into the Mediterranean Sea.

== Demographics ==
According to Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), in 2001 the ethnic makeup of the city was 97.3% Jewish and other non-Arabs, without significant Arab population. In 2001, there were 355 immigrants. &quot;See population groups in Israel&quot;. According to the CBS, in 2001 there were 22,200 males and 23,700 females. The population of the city was spread out, with 29.5% 19 years of age or younger, 16.3% between 20 and 29, 18.8% between 30 and 44, 17.3% from 45 to 59, 4.1% from 60 to 64, and 13.9% 65 years of age or older. The population growth rate in 2001 was 4.2%.

Following Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 many ex South Lebanon Army soldiers and officers who fled from Lebanon settled in Nahariya with their families.

== Schools and public institutions==
According to the CBS, Nahariya has 22 schools with 7,541 students, which are divided into 15 elementary schools with 4,074 students, and 7 middle and high schools with 3,467 students. In 2001, high school (12th grade) matriculation rate in the city was 56.5%.

Nahariya Hospital, located on the outskirts of Nahariya, three kilometers () from the city center, serves half a million residents of the western Galilee, from Karmiel to the coast. During the 2006 Lebanon War, the hospital was hit by rocket fire that destroyed an outer wall and eight rooms.

<doc id="323333" wikidata="Q973447" url="?curid=323333" title="Topsy (elephant)">
<text>Topsy ( – January 4, 1903) was a female Asian elephant who was electrocuted at Coney Island, New York, in January 1903. Born in Southeast Asia around 1875, Topsy was secretly brought into the United States soon thereafter and added to the herd of performing elephants at the Forepaugh Circus, who fraudulently advertised her as the first elephant born in the United States. During her 25 years at Forepaugh, Topsy gained a reputation as a &quot;bad&quot; elephant and, after killing a spectator in 1902, was sold to Coney Island&#x27;s Sea Lion Park. Sea Lion was leased out at the end of the 1902 season and during the construction of the park that took its place, Luna Park, Topsy was used in publicity stunts and also involved in several well-publicized incidents, attributed to the actions of either her drunken handler or the park&#x27;s new publicity-hungry owners, Frederic Thompson and Elmer &quot;Skip&quot; Dundy.

Thompson and Dundy&#x27;s end-of-the-year plans to advertise the opening of their new park, by euthanizing Topsy in a public hanging and charging admission to see the spectacle, were prevented by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The event was instead limited to invited guests and press only and Thompson and Dundy agreed to use a more sure method of strangling the elephant with large ropes tied to a steam-powered winch with both poison and electrocution planned as backup, a measure supported by the ASPCA. On January 4, 1903, in front of a small crowd of invited reporters and guests, Topsy was fed carrots laced with 460 grams of potassium cyanide, electrocuted and strangled, the electrocution being the final cause of death. Among the invited press that day was a crew from Edison Studios who filmed the event. Their film of the electrocution part was released to be viewed in coin-operated kinetoscopes under the title &quot;Electrocuting an Elephant&quot;. It is probably the first filmed death of an animal in history.

The story of Topsy fell into obscurity for the next 70 years but has become more prominent in popular culture, partly because the film of the event still exists. In popular culture, Thompson and Dundy&#x27;s killing of Topsy has switched attribution, with claims it was an anti-alternating current demonstration organized by Thomas A. Edison during the war of the currents. Edison was never at Luna Park and the electrocution of Topsy took place ten years after the war of currents.

==Life==

===Forepaugh Circus===
Topsy was born in the wild around 1875 in Southeast Asia and was captured soon after by elephant traders. 
Adam Forepaugh, owner of the Forepaugh Circus, had the elephant secretly smuggled into the United States with plans that he would advertise the baby as the first elephant born in the United States. At the time Forepaugh Circus was in competition with the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus over who had the most and largest elephants. The name &quot;Topsy&quot; came from a slave girl character in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;.

Forepaugh announced to the press in February 1877 that his circus now boasted &quot;the only baby elephant ever born on American soil&quot;. The elephant trader who sold Topsy to Forepaugh also sold elephants to P. T. Barnum and tipped Barnum off about the deception. Barnum exposed the hoax publicly and Forepaugh stopped claiming that Topsy was born in the United States, only advertising that she was the first elephant born outside a tropical zone.

At maturity, Topsy was high and long, with claims she weighed between . Over the years, Topsy gained a reputation as a &quot;bad&quot; elephant. In 1902, another event brought her again to prominence: the killing of spectator James Fielding Blount in Brooklyn, New York, at what was then the Forepaugh &amp; Sells Brothers&#x27; Circus. Accounts vary as to what happened but the common story is that on the morning of May 27, 1902, a possibly drunk Blount wandered into the menagerie tent where all the elephants were tied in a line and began teasing them in turn, offering them a bottle of whiskey. He reportedly threw sand in Topsy&#x27;s face and then burnt the extremely sensitive tip of her trunk with a lit cigar. Topsy threw Blount to the ground with her trunk and then crushed him with either her head, knees, or foot, or some combination thereof. Newspaper reports on Blount&#x27;s death contained what seem to be exaggerated accounts of Topsy&#x27;s man-killing past, with claims that she killed up to 12 men, but with more common accounts that, during the 1900 season, she had killed two Forepaugh &amp; Sells Brothers&#x27; Circus workers, one in Paris, Texas and one in Waco, Texas. Journalist Michael Daly, in his 2013 book on Topsy, could find no record of anyone being killed by an elephant in Waco. A handler named Mortimer Loudett of Albany, New York was attacked by Topsy in Paris, Texas and suffered injuries but Daly could not find a record of his dying from them. The publicity generated by Topsy&#x27;s actions brought very large crowds to the circus to see the elephant. In June 1902 during the unloading of Topsy from a train in Kingston, New York, a spectator named Louis Dondero used a stick in his hand to &quot;tickle&quot; Topsy behind the ear. Topsy seized Dondero around the waist with her trunk, hoisted him high in the air and threw him back down before being stopped by a handler. Due to this last incident, the owners of Forepaugh &amp; Sell Circus decided to sell Topsy.

=== Sea Lion and Luna Park ===
Topsy was sold in June 1902 to Paul Boyton, owner of Coney Island&#x27;s Sea Lion Park, and added to the menagerie of animals on display there. The elephant&#x27;s handler from Forepaugh, William &quot;Whitey&quot; Alt, came along with Topsy to work at the park. A bad summer season and competition with the nearby Steeplechase Park made Boyton decide to get out of the amusement park business. At the end of the year he leased Sea Lion Park to Frederick Thompson and Elmer Dundy who proceeded to redevelop it into a much larger attraction and renamed it Luna Park. Topsy was used in publicity, moving timbers and even the fanciful airship &quot;Luna&quot;, part of the amusement ride &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;, from Steeplechase to Luna Park, characterized in the media as &quot;penance&quot; for her rampaging ways.

During the moving of the &quot;Luna&quot; in October 1902, handler William Alt was involved in an incident where he stabbed Topsy with a pitchfork trying to get her to pull the amusement ride. When confronted by a police officer, Alt turned Topsy loose from her work harness to run free in the streets, leading to Alt&#x27;s arrest. The occurrence was attributed to the handler&#x27;s drinking. In December 1902, a drunk Alt rode Topsy down the town streets of Coney Island and walked, or tried to ride, Topsy into the local police station. Accounts say Topsy tried to batter her way through the station door and &quot;she set up a terrific trumpeting&quot;, leading the officers to take refuge in the cells. The handler was fired after the incident.

==Death==
Without Alt to handle Topsy, the owners of Luna Park, Frederick Thompson and Elmer Dundy, claimed they could no longer handle the elephant and tried to get rid of her, but they could not even give her away and no other circus or zoo would take her. On December 13, 1902, Luna Park press agent Charles Murray released a statement to the newspapers that Topsy would be put to death within a few days by electrocution. At least one local paper noted that the steady drone of events and reports regarding Topsy from the park had the hallmarks of a publicity campaign designed to get the new park continually mentioned in the papers. On January 1, 1903, Thompson and Dundy announced plans to conduct a public hanging of the elephant, set for January 3 or 4, and collect a twenty-five cents a head admission to see the spectacle. The site they chose was an island in the middle of the lagoon for the old Shoot the Chute ride where they were building the centerpiece of their new park, the 200-foot Electric Tower (the structure had reached a height of 75 feet at the time of the killing). Press agent Murray arranged media coverage and posted banners around the park and on all four sides of the makeshift gallows advertising, &quot;OPENING MAY 2ND 1903 LUNA PARK $1,000,000 EXPOSITION, THE HEART OF CONEY ISLAND&quot;.

On hearing Thompson and Dundy&#x27;s plans, the President of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, John Peter Haines, stepped in and forbade hanging as a &quot;needlessly cruel means of killing [Topsy]&quot; and also told Thompson and Dundy they could not conduct a public spectacle and charge admission. Thompson and Dundy discussed alternatives with Haines, going over methods used in previous attempts to euthanize elephants including poisoning, but that, as well as a 1901 attempt to electrocute an elephant named Jumbo II two years earlier in Buffalo, New York, were botched. After much negotiation, which included Thompson and Dundy trying to give the elephant to the ASPCA, a method of strangling the elephant with large ropes tied to a steam-powered winch was agreed upon. They also agreed they would use poisoning and electricity as well.

The date of Topsy&#x27;s demise was finally set for Sunday, January 4, 1903. The press attention the event had received brought out an estimated 1,500 spectators and 100 press photographers as well as agents from the ASPCA to inspect the proceedings. Thompson and Dundy allowed 100 spectators into the park although more climbed through the park fence. Many more were on the balconies and roofs of nearby buildings, which were charging admission to see the event. The Electric Tower had been re-rigged with large ropes set up to strangle the elephant, which were inspected by the ASPCA agents to make sure they conformed to what had been agreed. The details of the electrocution part of the execution were handled by workers from the local power company, Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Brooklyn, under the supervision of chief electrician P. D. Sharkey. They spent the night before stringing power lines from the Coney Island electrical substation nine blocks to the park to carry alternating current they planned to redirect from a much larger plant in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. At Bay Ridge the staff was told to &quot;get an engine ready and clear a feeder and bus to Coney Island Station&quot;. 

Topsy was led out of her pen into the unfinished Luna Park by Carl Goliath, an expert on elephants who formerly worked for animal showman Carl Hagenbeck. Newspaper accounts of the events noted that Topsy refused to cross the bridge over the lagoon, ignoring prodding by Goliath and even bribes of carrots and apples. The owners of Luna Park then tried to get William Alt, who would not watch the killing, to lead Topsy across the bridge, but he declined an offer of $25 to coax her to her death saying he would &quot;not for $1,000&quot;. They finally gave up trying to get Topsy across the bridge and decided to &quot;bring death to her&quot;. The steam engine, ropes, and the electrical lines were re-rigged to the spot where Topsy stood. The electricians attached copper-lined sandals connected to AC lines to Topsy&#x27;s right fore foot and left hind foot so the charge would flow through the elephant&#x27;s body.

With chief electrician Sharkey making sure everyone was clear, Topsy was fed carrots laced with 460 grams of potassium cyanide by press agent Charles Murray who then backed away. At 2:45 p.m. Sharkey gave a signal and an electrician on a telephone told the superintendent at Coney Island station nine blocks away to close a switch and Luna Park chief electrician Hugh Thomas closed another one at the park, sending 6,600 volts from Bay Ridge across Topsy&#x27;s body for 10 seconds, toppling her to the ground. According to at least one contemporary account, she died &quot;without a trumpet or a groan&quot;. After Topsy fell, the steam-powered winch tightened two nooses placed around her neck for 10 minutes. At 2:47, Topsy was pronounced dead. An ASPCA official and two veterinarians employed by Thompson and Dundy determined that the electric shock had killed Topsy. During the killing, the superintendent of the Coney Island station, Joseph Johansen, became &quot;mixed up in the apparatus&quot; when he threw the switch sending power to the park and was nearly electrocuted. He was knocked out and left with small burns from the power traveling from his right arm to his left leg.

==Film of the execution==
Among the press the day Topsy was killed was a film crew from the Edison film company, possibly directed by Edwin S. Porter or Jacob Blair Smith. The crew shot a 74-second film of Topsy&#x27;s electrocution. Within a few weeks, it was added to the films viewable in Edison kinetoscopes under the title &quot;Electrocuting an Elephant&quot;. This was one of many short &quot;actuality&quot; films shot by the Edison Manufacturing Company from 1897 at Coney Island, depicting rides, bathing scenes, diving horses, and elephants. The Edison company submitted the film to the Library of Congress as a &quot;paper print&quot; (a photographic record of each frame of the film) for copyright purposes. The submission may have saved the film for posterity, since most films and negatives of this period decayed or were destroyed over time.

===Media and culture===
&quot;Electrocuting an Elephant&quot; does not seem to have been as popular as other Edison films, and could not be viewed at Luna Park because the attraction did not have the necessary coin-operated kinetoscopes. The film and Topsy&#x27;s story fell into relative obscurity in the intervening years, and appeared as an out-of-context clip in the 1979 film &quot;Mr. Mike&#x27;s Mondo Video&quot;. In 1991, documentary maker Ric Burns made the film &quot;Coney Island,&quot; which included a segment recounting the death of Topsy, including clips from the film &quot;Electrocuting an Elephant&quot;.

In 1999, Topsy was commemorated in the Coney Island Mermaid Parade in a parade float by artist Gavin Heck. In 2003 Heck and a local arts group held a competition to select a memorial arts piece to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Topsy&#x27;s death. The chosen piece, created by New Orleans artist Lee Deigaard and exhibited at the Coney Island USA museum, allowed the public to view &quot;Electrocuting an Elephant&quot; on a hand-cranked mutoscope while surrounded by hanging chains and standing on a copper plate.

In later years, portions of &quot;Electrocuting an Elephant&quot; have appeared in movies, music videos, TV shows, and video games. The theme of Topsy&#x27;s electrocution also appears in songs, in the plot-line of several novels, and in poems such as U.S. poet laureate W. S. Merwin&#x27;s &quot;The Chain to Her Leg&quot;.

===Association with Thomas Edison===

In popular culture, Topsy is often portrayed as being electrocuted in a public demonstration organized by Thomas Edison during the war of the currents to show the dangers of alternating current.

Examples of this view include a 2008 &quot;Wired&quot; magazine article titled &quot;Edison Fries an Elephant to Prove His Point&quot; and a 2013 episode of the animated comedy series &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; titled &quot;Topsy&quot;. The events surrounding Topsy took place ten years after the end of the &quot;War&quot;. At the time of Topsy&#x27;s death, Edison was no longer involved in the electric lighting business. He had been forced out of control of his company by its 1892 merger into General Electric and sold all his stock in GE during the 1890s to finance an iron ore refining venture. The Brooklyn company that still bore his name mentioned in newspaper reports was a privately owned power company no longer associated with his earlier Edison Illuminating Company. Edison himself was not present at Luna Park when the film was made, and it is unclear as to the input he had in Topsy&#x27;s death or its filming since the Edison Manufacturing film company made over 1,200 short films during that period with very little to no guidance from Edison as to what was filmed. Journalist Michael Daly, in his 2013 book on Topsy, surmises that Edison would have been pleased by the proper positioning of the copper plates and that the elephant was killed by the large Westinghouse AC generators at Bay Ridge, but he shows no evidence of any actual contact or communication between the owners of Luna Park and Edison concerning Topsy.

Two things that may have indelibly linked Thomas Edison with Topsy&#x27;s death were the primary newspaper sources describing it as being carried out by &quot;electricians of the Edison Company” (leading to the eventual confusing of the unrelated power company with the man), and the fact that the film of the event (like most Edison films from that period) was credited onscreen to &quot;Thomas A. Edison&quot;, although Edison himself had no actual involvement in the production.

<text>Ness Ziona (, &quot;Nes Tziyona&quot;) is a city in Central District, Israel. In it had a population of , and its jurisdiction was 15,579 dunams ().

==Identification==
Lying within Ness Ziona&#x27;s city bounds is the ruin of the Arab village of Sarafand al-Kharab, which was depopulated in 1948. Some scholars believe that this is the site that the medieval Jewish traveller Ishtori Haparchi identified as the Talmudic &quot;Tzrifin&quot;, but other scholars believe Haparchi was referring to Sarafand al-Amar, 5 km distant. However, neither site has revealed archaeological remains from Talmudic times. On the basis of excavations at Sarafand al-Kharab, it is believed to have been founded no earlier than the late Byzantine period.

==History==
===Wadi Chanin/Nahalat Reuben===
====German farm (1878–1883)====
In 1878, the German Templer Gustav Reisler purchased lands in Wadi Hunayn, planted an orchard, and lived there with his family. The name &quot;Wadi-Chanin&quot;, with its German orthography, became the standard Western name for the place for several decades to come. After losing his wife and children to malaria, Reisler returned to Europe. He travelled to Odessa in 1882 and met Reuben Lehrer, born Patchornik (1832–1917), a religiously observant Russian Jew with Zionist ideals, who had his own farmland there. Reisler traded his parcel of land in Palestine for Lehrer&#x27;s land in Russia.

====Jewish settlement (1883)====
Reuben Lehrer made aliyah (emigrated to Palestine) with his eldest son Moshe in 1883, bringing over his wife and another four of his children the following year.

Lehrer placed advertisements near Jaffa port asking others to join him offering plots in his land for a small amount of money. The pioneers that arrived established a settlement named Tel Aviv (the city of Tel Aviv did not yet exist), although the area was still known as Wadi Chanin, from its Arabic name, Wadi Hunayn.

The settlement (colony, moshava) was known for a while as Wadi Chanin after the local Arab village, and as Nahalat Reuben (lit. &quot;Reuben&#x27;s Estate&quot;) after Reuben Lehrer.

In 1888, Avraham Yalovsky, a blacksmith, was killed there defending his workshop from Arab gangs.

===Ness Ziona (1891)===
In 1891, Michael Halperin bought more land in the wadi. He gathered a group of people on the &quot;Hill of Love&quot;, where he arrived with the &quot;Mahane Yehuda&quot; mounted guards company he had founded, and unfurled a blue and white flag emblazoned with the Star of David and the words &quot;Ness Ziona&quot; (&#x27;Banner toward Zion&#x27; or &#x27;Miracle of Zion&#x27;) written in gold. The name is based on a verse from the Book of Jeremiah, : &quot;Raise a standard toward Zion...&quot;. This flag was taken by Halperin to the First Zionist Congress seven years later, where it became the model for the official flag adopted by the nascent movement.

===United Jewish village===

In 1905, the &quot;Geula&quot; organisation bought the piece of land separating the older Wadi Chanin/Nahalat Reuben and the newer Ness Ziona, allowing the two Jewish settlements to unite into one larger village.

===United Jewish–Arab village===
In 1926, a new Arab village, Wadi Hunayn, developed across the Jaffa–Jerusalem road from a watermelon farm established there by the Abu Jaber clan from Sarafand el-Kharab, and became part of the same administrative unit as Ness Ziona.

Until the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, it was the only mixed Arab–Jewish village in Mandatory Palestine. The coexistence was, on the whole, a peaceful one.

===British Mandate===
According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Ness Ziona had a population of 319 Jews. By the 1931 census, it had increased to 1,013 inhabitants in 221 houses. In 1921 a pump and a system of water pipes were installed. In 1924 the British Army contracted the Israel Electric Company for wired electric power. The contract allowed the Electric Company to extend the grid beyond the original geographical limits that had been projected by the concession it was given. The high-tension line that exceeded the limits of the original concession ran along some major towns and agricultural settlements, offering extended connections to the Jewish settlements of Rishon Le-Zion, Nes-Ziona and Rehovot (in spite of their proximity to the high-tension line, the Arab towns of Ramleh and Lydda remained unconnected).
The Great Synagogue of Ness Ziona was built in the 1920s, during the period of the Third Aliyah.

===Givat Michael===
In 1935, a temporary workers&#x27; camp named Givat Michael after Michael Halperin, was established near Ness Ziona. It was meant as a training camp for new settlement groups (&quot;gar&#x27;in&quot;), two of which went on to establish the kibbutzim of Gal On and Mesilot.

===Arab attacks===
Ness Ziona was attacked by Arab forces during the 1936–39 Arab Revolt, and the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The outlying villages of Kfar Aharon and Tirat Shalom (now part of Ness Ziona) frequently exchanged fire with the Arab villages al-Qubayba and Zarnuqa (now western Rehovot). Most of Ness Ziona&#x27;s youth joined the Haganah to fight off these threats. On May 15, 1948, Sarafand al-Kharab was evacuated of Arab inhabitants, and on May 19, al-Qubayba and Zarnuqa were conquered by the Givati Brigade. Much of the territory abandoned by the fleeing Arab residents of nearby villages was added to Ness Ziona, increasing its size from immediately after the war.

===After the establishment of the state===
During the war, Ness Ziona&#x27;s population almost tripled to become 4,446 (according to an October 23, 1949 survey), and until 1950 the local council absorbed 9,000 &quot;olim&quot;, most of whom were housed in &quot;ma&#x27;abarot&quot; (provisional housing camps). In 1952, a new industrial zone was approved for the town on an area of 70 dunams. In 1955, a second industrial zone was approved.

==Geography==
Ness Ziona is located on the Israeli coastal plain approximately inland of the Mediterranean Sea, to the south of Tel Aviv. The city is bordered to the north by Rishon LeZion, to the east by Be&#x27;er Ya&#x27;akov, and to the south by Rehovot. Beit Hanan, Beit Oved, Ayanot youth village and Kibbutz Netzer Sereni also border the city. The city has been designed to have a rural character due to urban planning that bans the construction of buildings higher than eight stories. Property values have risen by 30 percent in recent years. Ness Ziona is located in the Gush Dan metropolitan area.

===Neighborhoods===
Ness Ziona is composed of a central core and villages that came under its municipal jurisdiction over time. The city also has two industrial zones and a high-tech park, Kiryat Weizmann.

==Demographics==
According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), in 2005 the ethnic makeup of the city was 99.6% Jewish and other non-Arabs. At the end of 2004 there were 612 immigrants (2.2%), although this rose sharply to 7.8% in 2005. The city also receives significant internal migration, and is popular among Tel Aviv residents seeking to leave the city.

In 2005 there were 14,400 males and 14,900 females. 31.8% of the population was 19 years of age or younger, 15.2% between 20 and 29, 21% between 30 and 44, 19.1% from 45 to 59, 3.1% from 60 to 64, and 9.7% 65 years of age or older. The population growth rate in 2006 was 5.8%.

In 2005, there were 11,830 salaried workers and 984 self-employed. The mean monthly wage 
for a salaried worker was NIS 7,597, a 9.2% increase over 2000. Salaried males had a mean monthly wage of NIS 9,802 (an 8.4% increase) versus NIS 5,595 for females (a 14% increase). The mean income for the self-employed was 7,064. There were 290 people receiving unemployment benefits and 986 receiving an income guarantee (welfare).

==Economy==
Ness Ziona is home to the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR), a secret government defence research institute working in chemical and biological research with 350 employees, and Zenith Solar, a solar energy company. The Kiryat Weizmann Science Park is a magnet for many Israeli start-ups, among them Indigo Digital Press, which was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2002 and manufactures high-end digital printing presses.

<text>Nof HaGalil is a city in the Northern District of Israel with a population of .

Nof HaGalil was founded in 1957 as Nazareth Illit (; ), it was planned as a Jewish town overlooking the city of Nazareth and the Jezreel Valley. In 1963, it was declared a local council, and in 1974, it formally gained the status of a city. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the city saw a large influx of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet republics, which doubled the city&#x27;s population and made it one of the centers of Russian Jewish culture in Israel. 

In recent decades, the city also became a mixed city following significant Israeli Arab migration; today 29% of the city&#x27;s population is Arab, although they depend on neighboring Nazareth for many services as the municipality has refused to allow the building of any churches, mosques or Arabic-speaking schools.

==History==
The establishment of Nazareth Illit was conceived in the early 1950s, when development towns such as Karmiel and Beit She&#x27;an were founded. There were economic and security reasons for developing a town in this region, but according to Shimon Landman, director of the Interior Ministry&#x27;s Department of Minorities, the Nazareth municipal elections in 1954, in which the Israel communist party Maki became the largest faction, were a source of concern.

A parcel of 1,200 dunams of land, about half formerly within the municipal boundaries of Nazareth, was allocated in 1954, relying on a law that permitted expropriations for public purposes. Protests at this action reached the Supreme Court of Israel, which in 1955 accepted (HCJ 30/55) the government&#x27;s word that the sole purpose of the land was to erect government facilities. However, it had already been decided that only 109 dunams would be used for that purpose and planning for residential neighborhoods continued. The first dwellings were completed in September 1956 and the first residents moved in later that year.

The director of the IDF Planning Department, Yuval Ne&#x27;eman, stated that the town would &quot;safeguard the Jewish character of the Galilee as a whole, and... demonstrate state sovereignty to the Arab population more than any other settlement operation.&quot; The historian Geremy Forman wrote that Nazareth Illit was meant to &quot;overpower Nazareth numerically, economically, and politically.&quot;

Initially the city was referred to as the &quot;Jewish neighborhood&quot; of Nazareth, then as &quot;Kiryat Natzeret&quot;. The name &quot;Nazareth Illit&quot; (Upper Nazareth) was adopted in 1958. In 1961, Nazareth Illit was recognized as a municipal local council.

In 2019 the city was renamed Nof HaGalil (Hebrew: , &quot;lit.&quot; View of the Galilee).

==Development plans==
In 2021, seven housing projects were under construction in Nof HaGalil. Construction has begun on the Haifa–Nazareth Light Rail which will pass through Nof HaGalil, with 7 stations planned throughout the city. The development of a large municipal park is nearing completion. It includes a petting zoo, an ecological lake, a planetarium, an astronomical observatory, a skating rink, an extreme zip-line course, a musical park, a botanical garden, and an amphitheater. A new government complex is also under construction and there are plans for the expansion of three commercial centers and a hi-tech park.

It has been reported that while the city&#x27;s Arab population grew in recent years, the municipality has refused to allow the building of any churches, mosques or Arabic-speaking schools.

==Demographics==

According to CBS, in 2014 the ethnic and religious makeup of the city was 64.4% Jewish and other non-Arabs and 21.6% Arab (7.2% Muslim and 14.4% Christian). In the 1990s, Nazareth Illit was the fastest developing city in the country with a growth rate of nearly 70 percent. Newcomers included new immigrants from the former Soviet Union and South America, as well as young couples. In 2012, Arabs accounted for 17 percent of the city&#x27;s 40,000 residents.

In recent years, the city has seen an influx of Bnei Menashe immigrants. 1,225 Bnei Menashe have now settled there, with 700 arriving in 2021 alone. The mayor, , has been an ardent supporter of the Bnei Menashe community moving into the city. 

==Economy==

The Strauss Group chocolate factory in the city&#x27;s industrial zone employs over 600 workers.

==Education==
In 2010, the city had 12 elementary schools and two high schools. In 2019, after a successful school fundraising, a scientific and ecological greenhouse was set up on a 500 square meters site in the Atzmon elementary school. The students of Atzmon not only grow vegetables and fruits, but also invent new varieties and experiment with the scientific process involved in their development. 

A new high school for religious boys opened in 2010 and the Yeshivat Hesder of Maalot, which combines army service with Torah study, opened a branch there. The city also has a regional engineering college, Nof HaGalil Technology College.

Although Nof Hagalil have four Arabic-speaking private preschools, its municipality has refused to open any Arab schools, in order to discourage continued Arab immigration to the city.

==Sports==
Hapoel Nof HaGalil is the city&#x27;s major football club. The city&#x27;s other football club, F.C. Nazareth Illit, plays in Liga Gimel.

The city&#x27;s main football stadium is Green Stadium. In addition to hosting matches of the city&#x27;s two football teams, the stadium hosted in the past Israeli Premier League matches of Hapoel Acre and Bnei Sakhnin whose stadiums did not meet Israeli Premier League. During 2013–14 the stadium also hosted Hapoel Afula matches.

The city&#x27;s basketball team, Hapoel Nof HaGalil, plays in the IBA fourth tier, Liga Alef.

<text>Nesher () is a city in the Haifa District of Israel. In it had a population of . It was founded in 1923 as a workers town for the Nesher Cement factory, the first cement factory in the country.

==History==
Nesher was founded in 1924 as a workers town for the Nesher Cement factory, established in September 1923 by Michael Pollack, a Jewish industrialist from Russia. The area was swampy and malaria-infested, but employees of the factory gradually moved there with their families, bringing the population to 1,500. Nesher was floated as a public company in 1925. During the 1929 Palestine riots, Arabs from neighbouring Balad al-Sheikh attacked the factory and burned down a farm.

By the mid-1930s, Nesher Cement had 700 employees, both Jewish and Arab.

In 1948, thousands of Jewish immigrants from Europe, Iraq and North Africa settled in Nesher. The town also expanded over the Palestinian village of Balad al-Sheikh, immediately north-west of Old Nesher, after it was depopulated during the 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine. A portion of the Tel Hanan neighborhood of the city was built over the village. In 1952, a local council was formed comprising four neighborhoods – Nesher, Giv’at Nesher, Ben-Dor and Tel Hanan. The first mayor was Yehuda Shimroni.

== Demographics ==
CBS statistics for 2005 show Nesher&#x27;s ethnic makeup as 99.5% Jewish and other non-Arabs. 30.7% of the population in 2005 were immigrants who came to Israel after 1990.

== Education ==
The city&#x27;s education system comprises six elementary schools, one comprehensive high school, two middle schools and 36 kindergartens and day care centers with an enrollment of 4,000 pupils. Over 70% of Nesher&#x27;s high school students take the Bagrut matriculation exams, with a pass rate of 98%, one of the highest rates in Israel. Nesher&#x27;s high school won the Israeli Education Prize twice in the span of a decade.

==Twinning and cultural exchange==
In 2005, the Broward County Jewish Federation established a partnership with Nesher in an effort to create a people-to-people cultural exchange program that includes high school and college student exchanges and video conferencing for events such as school celebrations and concerts.

==Emblem==
The municipal emblem was designed by David Hollod and approved at a local committee meeting on the 24th of October 1962. It includes multiple references:
* The vulture represents the name of the city and the cement factory from its inception.
* The 4 hills represent the mountainous terrain and the four original neighborhoods that constituted the settlement–Ben Dor, Tel Hanan, Nesher, and Givat Nesher.
* The factory and chimney represent the industrial foundation the city was established upon.
* The tree represents the growth and prosperity of the city over the years.

<text>Netivot () is a city located in the Southern District of Israel, located 8 miles (13 kilometers) southeast of Sderot and 19 miles (31 kilometers) northwest of Beersheba. In , it had a population of . Currently seeing rapid development, the city has grown to a population of 55,846 in 2024.

==History==

Netivot was founded in 1956 and named after the biblical verse: &quot;All her paths are peace&quot; (Proverbs 3:17). Initially a ma&#x27;abara, it was later transformed into a development town. The first residents were immigrants from Morocco and Tunisia. In the 1990s, they were joined by immigrants from Russia and Ethiopia.

In the mid-1990s the population was approximately 13,600, rising further to 21,800 in 2002. The increase was due to the arrival of many new immigrants; 43% of the residents were below the age of 14. At the end of 2009, Netivot had a population of 26,700. By 2017, the population had risen to 33,779. In 2000, Netivot received city status.

On October 7th, several Hamas terrorist squads reached the outskirts of the city, which is located 8 miles (13 kilometers) from Gaza Strip, but were eliminated by security forces before entering. Nonetheless, a rocket attack that day struck a home, taking the lives of three members of the same family.

==Demographics==

In 2001, the ethnic make-up of the city was 99.9% Jewish, and the population was evenly divided between males and females. The city ranked relatively low in the socio-economic index (3 out of 10). In the wake of Operation Solomon, Netivot absorbed a large number of Ethiopian Jewish immigrants.

==Education==
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, there were 22 schools and 4,243 students in the city: 16 elementary schools with 3,053 students, and 11 high schools with 1,190 students. 43.1% of 12th grade students were entitled to a Bagrut matriculation certificate in 2001.

In 2009, a high school student from Netivot won first prize in the First Step to Nobel Prize in Physics competition.

Netivot schools have been chosen for a special pilot project in which elementary school children build their own mini-robots.
In 2011, Netivot hosted a robotics festival sponsored by the international organization FIRST - For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology. First-, second,- and third-graders at the Noam Eliyahu religious school in Netivot spend eight hours a week studying science and robotics at Lehava, the municipal science center.

The Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev (MCLN) runs a two-year community-based leadership program in Netivot.

Netivot hosts the &quot;Yeshivat HaNegev&quot;, &quot;the Yeshiva of the Negev&quot;, a Haredi institution headed by Rabbi Aryeh Leib Levi, with approximately 200 students. It was founded in 1966 by Rabbi Issachar Meir, and was renamed &quot;Yeshivat Hanegev Shachar Shakir&quot; after him on his death.

The city is also home to the Religious Zionist &quot;Hesder&quot; Yeshiva of Netivot, &quot;&quot;Ahavat Yisrael&quot;&quot;. It was founded in 2000 by Rabbi Yisrael Friedman and is today headed by Rabbi David Asulin with approximately 50 students.

== Transportation ==

Netivot is accessible by Highway 34, Highway 25 and Route 232.

The Ashkelon–Beersheba railway, a new railway line which connected Netivot with Tel Aviv and Beersheba, was inaugurated in February 2015. The Netivot railway station located on the western outskirts of the city, was opened on February 15, 2015. A bus terminal is located adjacent to the station.

==Local culture==
Netivot is known for being the home of Jewish mystics and as a popular pilgrimage site. The growth of mysticism and sacred sites in Netivot led to it being dubbed the &quot;Varanasi of Israel.&quot;

Important rabbinical figures tied to Netivot include Yaakov Israel Ifergan, Yoram Abergel, and most prominently, Israel Abuhatzeira (Hebrew: ר׳ יִשְׂרָאֵל אַבּוּחַצִירָא) – the &quot;Babi Sali&quot; (1889–1984), a renowned Moroccan-born, Sephardic-Kabbalist rabbi, who had eventually settled there.

Once a year, on the Hebrew date of his death, thousands of followers descend on the tomb in commemoration.

Eleven local newspapers are published in the city.

Three successful nightclubs have opened in Netivot which also draw clientele from out of town, attracting young people from Ashkelon, Beersheba, Omer, Lehavim, Ofakim, and Sderot.

==Development plans ==

In 2019, two new neighborhoods with a total of 3,600 housing units planned for Netivot were expected to double the city&#x27;s population. Two large supermarkets were also planned which would bring the total to 9.

==Industry==
There are 24 plants and factories located in a nearby industrial park, mostly in food processing, metals, plastics, and construction sectors. There are an additional 15 factories located in the city in some of the same sectors as above, and also chemical and mineral sectors.

<doc id="323340" wikidata="Q756175" url="?curid=323340" title="Io (programming language)">
<text>Io is a pure object-oriented programming language inspired by Smalltalk, Self, Lua, Lisp, Act1, and NewtonScript. Io has a prototype-based object model similar to those in Self and NewtonScript, eliminating the distinction between instance and class. Like Smalltalk, everything is an object and it uses dynamic typing. Like Lisp, programs are just data trees. Io uses actors for concurrency.

Remarkable features of Io are its minimal size and openness to using external code resources. Io is executed by a small, portable virtual machine.

== History ==
The language was created by Steve Dekorte in 2002, after trying to help a friend, Dru Nelson, with his language, Cel. He learned that he really didn&#x27;t know much about how languages worked, and set out to write a tiny language to understand the problems better.

== Philosophy ==
Io&#x27;s goal is to explore conceptual unification and dynamic languages, so the tradeoffs tend to favor simplicity and flexibility over performance.

== Features ==
* Pure object-oriented based on prototypes
* Code-as-data, homoiconic 
* Lazy evaluation of function parameters
* Higher-order functions
* Introspection, reflection and metaprogramming
* Actor-based concurrency
* Coroutines
* Exception handling
* Incremental garbage collecting supporting weak links
* Highly portable
* Shared library, dynamic-link library (DLL), dynamic loading on most platforms
* Small virtual machine

== Syntax ==

In its simplest form, Io syntax is composed of one identifier:
 doStuff
Assuming the above doStuff is a method, it is being called with zero arguments and as a result, explicit parentheses are not required.

If doStuff had arguments, it would look like this:
 doStuff(42)
Io is a message passing language, and since everything in Io is a message (excluding comments), each message is sent to a receiver. The above example demonstrates this well, but not fully. To describe this point better, let&#x27;s look at the next example:
 System version
The above example demonstrates message passing in Io; the &quot;version&quot; message is sent to the &quot;System&quot; object.

Operators are a special case where the syntax is not as cut-and-dried as the above examples. The Io parser intercepts a set of operators defined by the interpreter, and translates them to method calls. For example, the following:
 1 + 5 * 8 + 1
translates to:
 1 +(5 *(8)) +(1)
All operators in Io are methods; the fact that they do not require explicit parentheses is a convenience. As you can see, there is also a little bit of operator precedence happening here, and the precedence levels are the same as with the C precedence levels.

=== Methods and blocks ===
In Io there are two ways of creating anonymous functions: methods and blocks. Between them, they are almost identical except for scope. While blocks have lexical scope, methods have dynamic scope.

Both &quot;method&quot; and &quot;block&quot; are higher-order functions.

=== Examples ===
The ubiquitous Hello world program:
 &quot;Hello, world!&quot; println
New objects are created by cloning objects. In Io specifically, a new, empty object is created and only the differences between it and its parent are stored within the new object; this behavior is known as differential inheritance. An example of this behavior is shown:
 A := Object clone // creates a new, empty object named &quot;A&quot;
A simple non-recursive factorial function, in Io:
factorial := method(n,
 if(n == 0, return 1)
 res := 1
 Range 1 to(n) foreach(i, res = res * i)


Because assignment of codice_1 to codice_2 is the last action taken, the function implicitly returns the result and so an explicit return expression is not needed. The above demonstrates the usage of ranges, and doesn&#x27;t use a codice_3 loop, which would be faster.

<text>Netanya () or Natanya, is a city in the northern Central District of Israel, and is the capital of the surrounding Sharon plain. It is north of Tel Aviv, and south of Haifa, between the Poleg stream and the Wingate Institute in the south and the Avihayil stream in the north.

Netanya was named in honor of Nathan Straus, a prominent Jewish American merchant and philanthropist in the early 20th century who was the co-owner of Macy&#x27;s department store.Thanks to generous donations, On September 8, 1928, 1,400 dunams were purchased from Sheikh Hamdan for 5,600 lira. It is said that the sheikh charged them a low price for the land because he claimed that he was not selling it, but merely receiving a &quot;custodial fee&quot; for the 2,000 years that the Arabs kept the land for the Jews. It is possible that the sheikh was not interested in highlighting the fact that he was selling waqf lands. The of beaches have made the city a popular tourist resort.

In , Netanya had a population of , ranking it as the 7th largest city in Israel by population. An additional 150,000 people live in the local and regional councils within of Netanya, which serves as a regional center for them. The city mayor is Miriam Feirberg.

==History==
Before the 20th century, parts of Netanya belonged to the Forest of Sharon, a hallmark of the region&#x27;s historical landscape. It was an open woodland dominated by Mount Tabor Oak (Quercus ithaburensis), which extended from Kfar Yona in the north to Ra&#x27;anana in the south. Arabs who lived in the area used it for pasture, firewood and intermittent cultivation. The intensification of settlement and agriculture in the coastal plain during the 19th century led to deforestation and subsequent environmental degradation known from Hebrew sources.
Netanya was established near the ancient site of Poleg by the Bnei Binyamin association in Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov. It was named in honor of Nathan (Hebrew: &quot;Natan&quot;) Straus (1848–1931), co-owner of Macy&#x27;s department store, New York City Parks Commissioner, and president of the New York City Board of Health, who gifted two-thirds of his personal fortune to projects benefiting Jews and Arabs in Mandatory Palestine. &quot;Netanya...was named for Straus in the hope he would donate money to them. When he told them he had no more money to give they were disappointed, but decided to keep the city&#x27;s name anyway.&quot;

The funds for the project of building Netanya were raised by Itamar Ben-Avi and Oved Ben-Ami, who embarked on a fundraising trip to the United States to raise the money. In 1928 members of Bnei Binyamin and Hanotea, an organisation set up after Straus was informed of the establishment of the settlement, purchased of Umm Khaled lands. On December 14, 1928, a team led by Moshe Shaked began digging for water at the site. After water was discovered in February 1929, the first five settlers moved onto the land. In the weeks that followed, more settlers began arriving. Development was set back due to the 1929 Palestine riots and massacre of Jews. By September, however, development was back on track with the cornerstones for the first 10 houses being laid on Sukkot.

The first kindergarten opened in 1930 and the first school in 1931. In the 1931 census of Palestine, Netanya was recorded as having 253 residents. In 1933, the British architect Clifford Holliday drew up a plan for Netanya as a tourist resort. Holliday also designed urban projects in Jaffa, Tiberias, Lydda and Ramla. The first urban plan divided the city into three sections with a tourism district along the coastline, housing, farms and commerce in the center, and agriculture and industry to the east. That year also saw the completion of the Tel Aviv Hotel, the first hotel in Netanya, as well as the establishment of two new neighborhoods, Ben Zion and Geva.

In 1934, the first Aliyah Bet ship arrived at the shores of Netanya, carrying 350 immigrants. By 1939, over seventeen more ships had followed. An industrial zone was established, and the first synagogue and school was built.

In 1937 the cornerstone was laid for a new commercial center and the connection of Netanya to the Tel Aviv-Haifa road. In 1939, the Ophir diamond polishing plant, the first diamond polishing plant in Palestine, was opened by Asher Daskall and Zvi Rosenberg. In 1940, the British Mandate government defined Netanya as a local council of which Oved Ben-Ami was elected head. In 1944, Netanya had a population of 4,900. The first high school in Netanya opened in 1945.

During the Jewish insurgency in Palestine, the Jewish underground group Irgun launched several attacks against British military and police forces in the Netanya area. The town itself was a bastion of support for the Irgun. The most infamous incident happened in July 1947, in what became known as the Sergeants affair. After three Irgun fighters had been sentenced to death by the British, the Irgun abducted two British sergeants on a Netanya street, and hid them in an abandoned factory. The British responded by declaring martial law and placing Netanya and the surrounding area under curfew. The British Army searched the town and interrogated residents, but did not find the sergeants. After the three Irgun fighters were hanged, the Irgun hanged the two sergeants in the factory and re-hanged and booby-trapped their bodies in an orange grove.

In November 1947, an Egged bus driving from Netanya to Jerusalem was attacked in Petah Tikva. In 1948, following the withdrawal of British forces from Netanya and the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, a large military base was established in the city.

On December 3, 1948, Netanya was declared a city in the newly established State of Israel. Ramat Tiomkin, Ein Hatchlelet, Pardes Hagdud, and Ramat Ephraim were annexed to Netanya. At this time, Netanya had a population of 11,600.

The Kiryat Eliezer Kaplan Industrial Zone was inaugurated in 1949 and Neve Itamar, founded in 1944, was annexed to Netanya.Netanya railway station opened in 1953.

With Israel experiencing a wave of Jewish immigration from Europe, elsewhere in the Middle East, and North Africa, Netanya&#x27;s population expanded. In the years following independence, approximately 14,000 Libyan Jewish immigrants settled in Netanya. The population reached 31,000 in 1955. To accommodate the influx of newcomers, the Israeli Housing Ministry built housing units of 50 square meters. The cornerstone of Kiryat Sanz, a religious neighborhood was laid in 1956. The first stock exchange built in Israel was built in Netanya. By 1961, the city&#x27;s population had grown to 41,300.

During the Six-Day War in 1967, Netanya was hit by Jordanian artillery, and Jordanian planes made sorties near Netanya, but failed to cause major damage. A lone Iraqi bomber attacked Netanya, dropping several bombs which damaged a factory and caused some casualties, shortly before being shot down. In 1972, Netanya had a population of 71,100.In the 1990s, large numbers of immigrants from the former Soviet Union settled in Netanya, greatly expanding the city&#x27;s population and resulting in large-scale housing construction.

Netanya suffered from several Palestinian bombings during the Second Intifada, including the Netanya Market bombing and, in the same month, the Passover massacre which caused the death of 29 people. Such attacks were cited as justification for the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier which has proved effective in stemming suicide attacks.

In the 2000s and 2010s, Netanya became one of the primary destinations of French Jewish aliyah. Thousands of French immigrants settled in Netanya, influencing the local culture.

==Geography==

Netanya is located on the Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain, the historic land bridge between Europe, Africa, and Asia. The city is the capital of the Sharon plain, a geographic region stretching from the Mediterranean in the west to the Samarian hills in the east, and the modern-day Gush Dan metropolitan area in the south northwards to Mount Carmel. Although the capital of a densely populated region, Netanya itself is relatively separate from settlements to the north, south, and east, although, over time, growth has incorporated some into what makes up modern-day Netanya.

Apart from some small moshavim and kibbutzim, south of Netanya is relatively clear of settlement until Herzliya and the start of the Gush Dan metropolitan area. Likewise, to the north is clear of large settlement until Hadera, and to the east until Tulkarm in the West Bank. The area to the east of Netanya does, however, have a large concentration of kibbutzim and moshavim in the Hefer Valley Regional Council and local councils of Kfar Yona, Kadima-Tzoran and Even Yehuda.

Netanya itself is divided into a large number of neighborhoods (see Neighborhoods of Netanya), recently growing southwards out of the city to create several high-end coastal neighborhoods with industrial areas inland. Netanya is home to the Poleg nature reserve and the Irises Dora Rainpool nature park containing the world&#x27;s largest population of iris atropurpurea. At the center of the park is a rainpool which fills up with water in the winter months, and dries up over the summer months. Signs along the rain pool include information on the types of flora and fauna that populate the ecosystem.

==Demographics==
In , Netanya was home to people. The population density of the city is 7,115 per square kilometer. The population is expected to be around 320,000 in 2035.

That same year, 90,200 of the residents of Netanya were born in Israel, while 71,300 were born abroad. A significant number of Ethiopian Jews in Israel have settled in Netanya with over 10,500 Ethiopian Jewish residents in the city. Netanya is also the center of the Persian Jewish community of Israel.

As of 2000, the city had 58,897 salaried workers and 4,671 self-employed with the mean monthly wage in 2000 for a salaried worker in the city being NIS 4,905, a real change of 8.6% over the course of 2000.

==Neighborhoods==

=== Kiryat Sanz ===
In 1956, a beachfront in northern Netanya was selected as a home base for the Sanzer Hasidim by its leader, Rabbi Yekusiel Yehudah Halberstam. Halberstam established kindergartens, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; schools, yeshivas, seminaries, synagogues, a children&#x27;s home for orphaned and needy girls, an old-age home, and a hospital. In addition to religious services, Kiryat Sanz had a diamond polishing factory built by a New York diamond merchant. Halberstam established his court here in 1960. Following his death in 1994, his eldest son, Rabbi Zvi Elimelech Halberstam, known as the Sanzer Rebbe, became the spiritual leader of the Sanz community in Israel. In 2010, Kiryat Sanz had a population of approximately 1000 families. Most of the older generation are Holocaust survivors. Besides its educational facilities for boys and girls from elementary to post-graduate, there are five synagogues, a mikveh, a printing house, a religious hotel, a religious nursing school, and the Laniado Hospital, which encompasses two medical centers, a children&#x27;s hospital, a geriatric center and a nursing school, serving a regional population of over 450,000.

==Urban development==

Several of the tallest buildings in Israel are located in Netanya. The construction of eight new skyscrapers, six of them over 30 stories, was approved in 2011. Dozens of 40–42-story skyscrapers have been planned, many of them along the shore.

Netanya is developing according to master plans for 2035 which seek to massively increase residential units and office space in the city, as well as a new marina and piers. As part of the plan, the intention of the municipality is for the city&#x27;s population to reach 320,000 by 2035.

The city seeks to become a major tourist hub for local and overseas tourism, with an &quot;Israeli Riviera&quot; on the shore. Among the projects planned in 2013 was the construction of 2,062 housing units and 1,100 hotel rooms while leaving much of the land as open space. The city has set itself a goal to expand open space from 56 to 70 percent. The plan is expected to attract more residents, boost hotel development, and increase the number of gardens and green spaces. It has been suggested that as the city&#x27;s population expands, a light rail system may be built there in the future.

<text>Afula () is a city in the Northern District of Israel, often known as the &quot;Capital of the Valley&quot; due to its strategic location in the Jezreel Valley. As of , the city had a population of .

Afula&#x27;s ancient tell suggests habitation from the Late Chalcolithic period to the Ayyubid period. It has been proposed that Afula is the location of the village Arbela mentioned in the Onomasticon of Eusebius and the 7th century Samaritan village of &quot;Kirjath Ophlatha&quot;. A fortress was built at the site during the Mamluk period.

A small Palestinian Arab village during the Ottoman period; it was sold in 1872 with the entire Jezreel valley to the Lebanese Sursock family. In 1925, the same area was acquired by the American Zionist Commonwealth as part of the Sursock Purchase. The majority Muslim and Christian population were removed, and replaced by Jewish immigrants, marking the foundation of modern Afula. After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Afula was settled by Jewish immigrants from Iraq, Yemen and Romania. In 1972, it gained the status of a city. The 1990s saw Jewish immigration from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union contribute to the growth of the city. Since 1995, the city has almost doubled its population.

==Etymology==
The name follows that of the small Arab village which occupied the site until World War I, possibly originating in the Canaanite-Hebrew root &quot;ʿofel&quot; &quot;fortress tower&quot;, or the Arab word for &quot;ruptured&quot;.

==History==
An ancient mound or tell known as Tell ʿAfula, located in the heart of modern Afula, suggests almost continuous habitation from the Late Chalcolithic (fourth millennium BCE) to the Ayyubid period in the 13th century. At the beginning of the twentieth century the mound served as a refuse dump for the nearby Arab village of el-Fuleh.

===Bronze Age to Byzantine period===
For archaeological finds from Tell ʿAfula predating the Crusader/Mamluk fortress, see the archaeology paragraph.

ʿAfula is possibly the place &quot;ʿOphlah&quot;, mentioned in the lists of Pharaoh Thutmose III. Zev Vilnay suggested to identify Afula with biblical &quot;Ophel&quot;, mentioned in 2 Kings. With the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel, the area continued to be inhabited, and excavations have revealed artifacts from the periods of Persian and Roman rule. It may be identified with Arbela mentioned in the Onomasticon of Eusebius. Claude Reignier Conder suggested that ʿAfula was identical with &quot;Kirjath Ophlathah&quot;, a place inhabited by Samaritans in the 7th century.

===Crusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
At the centre of Tell ʿAfula stand the remains of a 19-metre square fortress from the Mamluk period, possibly first built during the Crusader period. The lower four courses are made of rough boulders, while the top remaining layer is made of reused Roman sarcophagi. The wall is a total of 5.5 meters tall. Pottery remains indicate that it was occupied in the twelfth and thirteenth century. The gate is dated based on pottery findings to the Mamluk period (13th–14th centuries CE), but so far (after the June 2017 campaign) it could not be determined when fortress itself was built, since it is perfectly possible that just the gate was renovated in the Mamluk period; the square shape and the use of Roman sarcophagi as building stones is closely resembling the Crusader fortress at Sepphoris.

In 1321, ʿAfula was mentioned under the name of &quot;Afel&quot; by Marino Sanuto the Elder.

===Ottoman period===
A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799 showed this place, named as &quot;Afouleh&quot; in a French transliteration of the Arabic.

In 1816, James Silk Buckingham passed by and described &quot;Affouli&quot; as being built on rising ground, and containing only a few dwellings. He noted several other nearby settlements in sight, all populated by Muslims.

In 1838, Edward Robinson described both ʿAfula and the adjacent El Fuleh as &quot;deserted&quot;.
 William McClure Thomson, in a book published in 1859, noted that ʿAfula and the adjacent El Fuleh were &quot;both now deserted, though both were inhabited twenty-five years ago when I first passed this way.&quot; Thomson blamed their desertion on the bedouin.

In 1875 Victor Guérin described ʿAfula as a village on a small hill overlooking a little plain. The houses were built of adobe and various other materials. Around the well, which Guérin thought was probably ancient, he noticed several broken sarcophagi serving as troughs. In 1882, the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described El ʿAfula as a small adobe village in the plain, supplied by two wells.

A population list from about 1887 showed that el ʿAfula had about 630 inhabitants, all Muslim. Gottlieb Schumacher, as part of surveying for the construction of the Jezreel Valley railway, noted in 1900 that it consisted of 50-55 huts and had 200 inhabitants. North of the village was a grain stop, belonging to the Sursocks.

In 1904 the Ottoman authorities inaugurated the Jezreel Valley railway, at first operating between Haifa and Beysan via ʿAfula and soon extended to Dera&#x27;a. Work eventually continued with an extension towards Jerusalem, the connection to Jenin being completed in 1913.

====First World War====

During World War I, ʿAfulah was a major communications hub. In 1917, when Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen from the British intelligence established contact with the Nili Jewish spy network in Palestine, a German Jewish doctor stationed at al ʿAfulah railway junction provided the British with valuable reconnaissance reports on Ottoman and German troop movements southwards.

With the advance of General Edmund Allenby&#x27;s British forces into Ottoman Palestine, al ʿAfulah was captured by the 4th Cavalry Division of the Desert Mounted Corps, during the cavalry phase of the Battle of Sharon in September 1918.

===British Mandate===

According to the British Mandate&#x27;s 1922 census of Palestine, &quot;Affuleh&quot; had 563 inhabitants; 471 Muslims, 62 Christians, 28 Jews and 2 followers of the Baháʼí Faith; 61 of the Christians were Orthodox, while one was Melkite.

====Jewish Afula (est. 1925)====
In 1925, the area was acquired by the American Zionist Commonwealth as part of the Sursock Purchase. A quarter of the one hundred Arab families who had lived in the area accepted compensation for their land and left voluntarily; the remainder were evicted by the new owners. Jews began settling in ʿAfula shortly after as the town developed. Nearby land had been purchased in a similar manner in 1909 or 1910, when Yehoshua Hankin bought 10,000 dunams (10 km2) of land on which Merhavia and Tel Adashim were to be built (this was Hankin&#x27;s first major purchase in the Jezreel Valley).

In 1924 former leaders of Hashomer established an arms factory in Afula. Disguised as a farm equipment repair workshop it produced bullets and weapon parts.

By the 1931 census, the population had increased to 874; with 786 Jews, 86 Muslims, nine Christians, and three classified as &quot;no religion&quot;, in a total of 236 houses.

In a 1945 survey the population of ʿAfula was estimated as 2300 Jews and ten Muslims. The town had a total of 18,277 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 145 dunams of land was used to cultivate citrus and bananas, 347 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 15,103 for cereals, while 992 dunams were built-up land.

During this time, the community was served by the Jezreel Valley Railway, a side branch of the larger Hejaz Railway. Since 1913 it had also been the terminus station of the branch connecting it to Jenin and later also to Nablus. Sabotage actions of Jewish underground militias in 1945, 1946 and shortly before the 1948 Arab–Israeli War rendered first the connection to Jenin, then progressively the entire Valley Railway, inoperable.
===State of Israel===

====Railroad (1948-49; 2010s)====
Repairs to the Jezreel Valley Railway after 1948 restored service to Haifa, but only until 1949 when it was abandoned. In 2011 construction began on a large-scale project to build a new standard gauge railway from Haifa to Beit She&#x27;an with stations in Afula and other towns, along roughly the same route as the historic valley railway. Israel Railways began passenger service on the new railway on October 16, 2016.

====Terror attacks (1990s-2000s)====
Due to Afula&#x27;s proximity to the West Bank, it has been a target for Palestinian political violence. On 6 April 1994, the Afula Bus suicide bombing killed five people in the center of Afula. In the Afula axe attack in November 1994, a 19-year-old female soldier was attacked and murdered by an axe-wielding Arab Hamas member. Afula also was the target of a suicide attack on a bus on 5 March 2002, in which one person died and several others were injured at Afula&#x27;s central bus station. In the Afula mall bombing on 19 May 2003, a woman suicide bomber blew herself up at the Amakim mall, killing three and wounding 70. This attack was claimed by the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine and the Fatah movement&#x27;s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.

====2006 Lebanon War====
On 17 July 2006, during the 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah fired Katyusha rockets at Afula, one of the southernmost rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon. Six people were treated for shock as a result of the attack. On 28 July, a rocket landed causing a fire. The rocket carried of explosives.

====Recent development plans====
In September 2016, it was announced that seven new neighborhoods would be built, doubling the city&#x27;s population.

====Notable incidents====
In June 2018, 150 of the city&#x27;s Jewish residents protested against the sale of a home to an Arab family. Former Afula Mayor Avi Elkabetz joined the protest and said, &quot;the residents of Afula don&#x27;t want a mixed city, but rather a Jewish city, and it&#x27;s their right. This is not racism.&quot;

In June 2019, a demonstration happened in protest against a house being sold to an Arab family, joined by Afula&#x27;s mayor, Avi Elkabetz, who had run for office on a platform of &quot;preserving the Jewish character of Afula.&quot;

==Climate==
Afula has a mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;). The average annual temperature is , and around of precipitation falls annually.
==Economy==
The Alon Tavor Industrial Zone is located northeast of Afula off Highway 65. The Tadiran air conditioner factory is located there. Two Israeli plastics manufacturers, Keter Plastic and StarPlast, are also based there.

==Education and culture==
According to CBS, there are 24 schools and 8,688 students in the city: 16 elementary schools with a student population of 3,814 and 12 high schools with 4,874 students. 52.3% of 12th grade students were entitled to a matriculation certificate in 2001.

==Health care==
HaEmek Medical Center in Afula was the first regional hospital in Israel.

==Archaeology==

The ancient mound of ʿAfula, known as Tell ʿAfula, is close to the city center, west of Route 60 and south of Ussishkin Street. Very little of the initial six-acre tell remains due to construction work done in this area since the British Mandate period. The southern peak of the mound is the better preserved part. It was once widely considered to be the biblical site of Ophrah, the hometown of the judge Gideon, but contemporary scholars generally disagree with this supposition. Archaeological finds date from the Chalcolithic through the Byzantine period, followed by remains from the Crusader and Mamluk periods.

The first excavations at Tell ʿAfula, carried out in 1948, found Late Chalcolithic–Early Bronze Age remains. Tombs from the Early Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age II, Late Bronze Age–Iron Age I and Roman period were discovered near the municipal water tower. Archaeologists discovered the Crusader-Mamluk fortress on the southern peak of the tell, a Byzantine olive oil press and evidence of an Early Bronze Age settlement near the northern peak.

In 1950–1951, excavations on the northwestern slope of the peak revealed a pottery workshop for Tell el-Yahudiyeh Ware from Middle Bronze Age II and another pottery workshop from Middle Bronze Age I.

From the 1990s, several small excavations unearthed an uninterrupted sequence of settlement remains from the Chalcolithic until the Late Byzantine periods as well as remains from the Mamluk period.

In 2012, excavations were conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority on the southern peak of Tell ʿAfula where the Crusader-Mamluk fortress is located. Due to construction activity from the 1950s, settlement layers on the tell may have been destroyed. Only meager remnants were found, indicative of a settlement from Early Bronze Age I and the Roman period. Pottery from Early Bronze Age III, Iron Age I and a single Hellenistic Attic fragment indicate settlement on the tell in these periods. Fragments of glazed bowls from the thirteenth century (Mamluk period) were found along the southern edge of the excavation.

==Sports==
The city&#x27;s basketball club, Hapoel Afula, currently play in the Liga Leumit.
The main football club, Hapoel Afula, won Liga Alef in the 2012–13 season and is currently playing at Liga Leumit.
