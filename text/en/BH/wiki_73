<text>The long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus), also named long-tailed bushtit, is a common bird found throughout Europe and the Palearctic. The genus name &quot;Aegithalos&quot; was a term used by Aristotle for some European tits, including the long-tailed tit.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The long-tailed tit was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Parus caudatus&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;caudatus&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;tailed&quot;. Linnaeus did not invent this Latin name. &quot;Parus caudatus&quot; had been used by earlier authors such as the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1555, the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1599, and the English ornithologist Francis Willughby in 1676. Willughby listed the English name as the &quot;long tail&#x27;d titmouse&quot;. Its previous common nickname in everyday English was the bum-towel, from the shape of its tail.

The long-tailed tit was first classified as a true tit of the &quot;Parus&quot; group. &quot;Parus&quot; has since been split from the Aegithalidae, with the latter becoming a distinct family containing three genera:

* &quot;Aegithalos&quot; (long-tailed tits), five species including &quot;A. caudatus&quot;
* &quot;Psaltria&quot; (pygmy bushtit), monotypic
* &quot;Psaltriparus&quot; (American bushtit), monotypic.

This is the only representative of the Aegithalidae in northern Eurasia. The long-tailed tit exhibits complex global variation with 17 races recognised, divisible into three groups:


* the &quot;A. c. caudatus&quot; group in northern Europe and Asia. &quot;A. c. caudatus&quot; has a pure white head
* the &quot;A. c. europaeus&quot; group in southern and western Europe, north-east China, and Japan. Separating &quot;A. c. rosaceus&quot; from other members of the &quot;A. c. europaeus&quot; group though is problematic, relying on varying thickness of the crown stripes and amount of streaks and colour on the underparts
* the &quot;A. c. alpinus&quot; group in Mediterranean Europe and south-west Asia.

The silver-throated bushtit (&quot;Aegithalos glaucogularis&quot;) from eastern China was formerly considered conspecific but the plumage is distinctive and there are significant genetic differences.

Where the groups meet there are extensive areas occupied by very variable ‘hybrids’. The British long-tailed tit, subspecies &quot;A. c. rosaceus&quot;, belongs to the &quot;A. c. europaeus&quot; group.

==Description==
This species has been described as a tiny (at only in length, including its tail), round-bodied tit with a short, stubby bill and a very long, narrow tail. The sexes look the same and young birds undergo a complete moult to adult plumage before the first winter. The plumage is mainly black and white, with variable amounts of grey and pink.

===Voice===
Vocalisations are a valuable aid to locating and identifying these birds. When in flocks they issue constant contact calls and are often heard before they are seen. They have three main calls, a single high pitched &quot;pit&quot;, a ‘triple trill’ &quot;eez-eez-eez&quot;, and a rattling &quot;schnuur&quot;. The calls become faster and louder when the birds cross open ground or if an individual becomes separated from the group.

==Distribution and habitat==
The long-tailed tit is globally widespread throughout temperate Northern Europe and the Palearctic, into boreal Scandinavia and south into the Mediterranean zone. It inhabits deciduous and mixed woodland with a well-developed shrub layer, favouring edge habitats. It can also be found in scrub, heathland with scattered trees, bushes and hedges, in farmland and riverine woodland, parks and gardens. The bird&#x27;s year-round diet of insects and social foraging bias habitat choice in winter towards deciduous woodland, typically of oak, ash and locally sycamore species. For nesting, strong preference is shown towards scrub areas. The nest is often built in thorny bushes less than above the ground.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Food and feeding===
The long-tailed tit is insectivorous throughout the year. It eats predominantly arthropods, preferring the eggs and larvae of moths and butterflies. Occasional vegetable matter (such as seeds) is taken in the autumn.

===Nest===
The nest of the long-tailed tit is constructed from four materials: lichen, feathers, spider egg cocoons and moss, with over 6,000 pieces used for a typical nest. The nest is a flexible sac with a small, round entrance at the top, suspended either low in a gorse or bramble bush or high up in the forks of tree branches. The structural stability of the nest is provided by a mesh of moss and spider silk; the tiny leaves of the moss act as hooks and the spider&#x27;s silken thread provides the loops, thus producing a natural form of velcro. The tit lines the outside with hundreds of flakes of pale lichens to provide camouflage. The inside of the nest is lined with more than 2,000 downy feathers to provide insulation. The nests suffer a high rate of predation, with only 17% success.

===Social behaviour===

Extensive work has been done at Wytham Wood, Oxfordshire, in Germany and Japan.

Outside the breeding season they form compact flocks of six to seventeen birds, composed of family parties (parents and offspring) from the previous breeding season, together with any extra adults that helped to raise a brood. These flocks will occupy and defend territories against neighbouring flocks. The driving force behind the flocking behaviour is thought to be that of winter roosting, being susceptible to cold; huddling increases survival through cold nights.

From July to February, the non-breeding season, long-tailed tits form flocks of relatives and non-relatives, roosting communally. When the breeding season begins, the flocks break up, and the birds attempt to breed in monogamous pairs. Males remain within the winter territory, while females have a tendency to wander to neighbouring territories.

Since long-tailed tits are cooperative breeders, where opposite sex adult relatives are spatially clustered, they risk inbreeding fitness costs. However, such inbreeding fitness costs are avoided by active kin discrimination during mate choice. Kin discrimination appears to be based on distinguishing between the vocal calls of close kin and nonkin.

Pairs whose nests fail have three choices: try again, abandon nesting for the season or help at a neighbouring nest. It has been shown that failed pairs split and help at the nests of male relatives, recognition being established vocally. The helped nests have greater success due to higher provisioning rates and better nest defence. At the end of the breeding season, in June and July, the birds reform the winter flocks in their winter territory.

===Helpers===
Due to high predation, there is a high nest failure rate. If nest failure occurs after the beginning of May, failed breeders will not try to re-nest, but may become helpers at a nest of another, usually related, pair. In one study, around 50% of nests had one or more helpers. By helping close relatives, helpers gain indirect fitness benefits by increasing the survivability of related offspring. Helpers may also gain greater access to mates and territories in the future. Helpers also gain experience raising young and therefore their future offspring have greater survivability rates.

Males and females are equally likely to become helpers. Parents may allow the care of helpers to be additive to their own efforts, or on the other extreme, they may reduce their efforts with the care of the helpers. Juvenile males have a higher survivability than juvenile females, although the survival rate for adults of the two sexes is the same. Offspring that were raised with helpers have a higher survivability than offspring raised without. Failed breeders that became helpers have a higher survivability than failed breeders who did not. This may be because of the reduced energy expenditure from sharing a nest. This is similar to acorn woodpeckers and green wood hoopoes. However, failed breeders that did not help are more likely to breed successfully in subsequent years, so there may be a cost of helping. This may be due to helpers having relatively poorer body conditions at the end of the breeding season, similar to pied kingfisher and white-winged chough. Successful breeders have a survivability rate around the survivability of failed breeders who became helpers.

==Status and conservation==
Globally, the species is common throughout its range, only becoming scarce at the edge of the distribution. The IUCN, BirdLife International and The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) all list the long-tailed tit as a ‘species of least concern’, currently under little or no threat and reasonably abundant.

Due to their small size they are vulnerable to extreme cold weather, with population losses of up to 80% being recorded in times of prolonged cold. It is thought that populations rapidly return to previous levels due to high breeding potential.

<text>Faxian (337–), formerly romanized as Fa-hien and Fa-hsien, was a Chinese Buddhist monk and translator who traveled on foot from Jin China to medieval India to acquire Buddhist scriptures. His birth name was Gong Sehi. Starting his journey about age 60, he traveled west along the overland Silk Road, visiting Buddhist sites in Central, South, and Southeast Asia. The journey and return took from 399 to 412, with 10 years spent in India.

Faxian&#x27;s account of his pilgrimage, the &quot;Foguoji&quot; or &quot;Record of the Buddhist Kingdoms&quot;, are a notable independent record of early Buddhism in India. He returned to China with a large number of Sanskrit texts, whose translations greatly influenced East Asian Buddhism and provide a for many historical names, events, texts, and ideas therein.

==Biography==

12th-century woodblock print, 1st page of the Travels of Faxian (Record of the Buddhist Countries). The first sentences read: &quot;In [[Chang&#x27;an]], Faxian was distressed that the &quot;Vinaya&quot; collections were incomplete. Therefore, in the 2nd year of [[Yao Xing|Hongshi]] or the Ji-Hai year (36) of the [[sexagenary cycle]] [the [[Chinese calendar|Chinese year]] covering late 399 and early 400], he agreed with Huijing, Daozheng, Huiying, and Huiwei to go seek out more of the &quot;Vinaya&quot; in India.&quot;

Faxian was born in Shanxi in the 4th-century under the Later Zhao dynasty of the Sixteen Kingdoms period. His birth name was Gong Sehi. He later adopted the name Faxian, which literally means &quot;Splendor of Dharma&quot;. Three of his elder brothers died young. His father, fearing that the same fate would befall him, had him ordained as a novice monk at the age of three.

In 399 CE, about age 60, Faxian was among the earliest attested pilgrims to India. He set out from Chang&#x27;an, the capital of the Buddhist Later Qin dynasty, along with four others to locate sacred Buddhist texts and was later joined by five more pilgrims at Zhangye. He visited India in the early fifth century. He is said to have walked all the way from China across the icy desert and rugged mountain passes. He entered India from the northwest and reached Pataliputra. He took back with him a large number of Sanskrit Buddhist texts and images sacred to Buddhism. Upon his return to China, he is also credited with translating these Sanskrit texts into Chinese.

Faxian&#x27;s visit to India occurred during the reign of Chandragupta II. He entered the Indian subcontinent through the northwest. His memoirs describe his 10 years stay in India. He visited the major sites associated with the Buddha, as well the renowned centres of education and Buddhist monasteries. He visited Kapilvastu (Lumbini), Bodh Gaya, Benares (Varanasi), Shravasti, and Kushinagar, all linked to events in Buddha&#x27;s life. Faxian learned Sanskrit, and collected Indian literature from Pataliputra (Patna), Oddiyana, and Taxila in Gandhara. His memoirs mention the Hinayana and emerging Mahayana traditions, as well as the splintering and dissenting Theravada sub-traditions in 5th-century Indian Buddhism. Before he had begun his journey back to China, he had amassed a large number of Sanskrit texts of his times.

On Faxian&#x27;s way back to China, after a two-year stay in Sri Lanka, a violent storm drove his ship onto an island, probably Java. After five months there, Faxian took another ship for southern China, but again it was blown off course and he ended up landing at Mount Lao in what is now Shandong in northern China, east of the city of Qingdao. He spent the rest of his life translating and editing the scriptures he had collected. These were influential to the history of Chinese Buddhism that followed.

Faxian returned in 412 and settled in what is now Nanjing. He wrote a book on his travels around the year 414, filled with accounts of early Buddhism and the geography and history of numerous countries along the Silk Road as they were at the turn of the 5th century CE. He spent the next decade until his death translating the Buddhist sutras he had brought with him from India.

The following is the introduction to James Legge&#x27;s 19th-century translation of Faxian&#x27;s work. Legge&#x27;s speculations, such as Faxian visiting India at the age of 25, have been discredited by later scholarship but his introduction provides some useful biographical information about Faxian:


== Works ==
Faxian&#x27;s major work is his account of his travels, known in English both by its Chinese name &quot;Foguoji&quot; or &quot;Foguo Ji&quot; ) and by various translations, including &quot;A Record of the Buddhist Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Record of the Buddhistic Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Buddhist Country Records&quot;, etc. The book is also known as &quot;Faxian&#x27;s Travels&quot; ), &quot;Faxian&#x27;s Biography&quot; ), &quot;Memoirs of the Eminent Monk Faxian&quot; ), &quot;A Buddhist Pilgrimage to India&quot; ), Faxian&#x27;s &quot;Report on Travel to India&quot; ), and Faxian&#x27;s work &quot;On India&quot; ). Faxian&#x27;s memoirs are an independent record of the society and culture of places he visited, particularly India. His translations of Sanskrit texts he took with him to China are an important means to date texts, named individuals, and Buddhist traditions. They provide a for many historical names, manuscripts, events, and ideas mentioned.

Faxian noted that central Asian cities such as Khotan were Buddhist, with the clergy reading Indian Manuscripts in Indian languages. The local community revered the monks. He mentions a flourishing Buddhist community in Taxila (now in Pakistan) amid a generally non-Buddhist community. He describes elaborate rituals and public worship ceremonies, with support of the king, in the honour of the Buddha in India and Sri Lanka. He wrote about cities like Pataliputra, Mathura, and Kannauj in Madhya Desha. He also wrote that inhabitants of Madhyadesha eat and dress like Chinese people. He declared Pataliputra to be a prosperous city. He left India about 409 from Tamralipti, a port he states to be on its eastern coast. However, some of his Chinese companion pilgrims who came with him on the journey decided to stay in India.

;Impressions of India
; Struggles at sea during the return journey through Java
Rémusat&#x27;s translation of the work caused a stir in European scholarship, although deeply perplexing many with its inability to handle the many Sanskrit words Faxian transcribed into Middle Chinese characters.

<doc id="334351" wikidata="Q1509955" url="?curid=334351" title="Spirula">
<text>Spirula spirula is a species of deep-water squid-like cephalopod mollusk. It is the only extant member of the genus Spirula, the family Spirulidae, and the order Spirulida. Because of the shape of its internal shell, it is commonly known as the ram&#x27;s horn squid or the little post horn squid. Because the live animal has a light-emitting organ, it is also sometimes known as the tail-light squid.

Live specimens of this cephalopod are very rarely seen because it is a deep-ocean dweller. The small internal shell of the species is, however, quite a familiar object to many beachcombers. The shell of &quot;Spirula&quot; is extremely light in weight, very buoyant, and surprisingly durable; it very commonly floats ashore onto tropical beaches (and sometimes even temperate beaches) all over the world. This seashell is known to shell collectors as the ram&#x27;s horn shell or simply as &quot;Spirula&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus described &quot;Nautilus spirula&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 in his book &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. In 1799, French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck described the genus &quot;Spirula&quot; and transferred this species to it, and &quot;Spirula spirula&quot; is the name still used today for the ram&#x27;s horn squid. &quot;S. spirula&quot; is the only species in the monotypic genus &quot;Spirula.&quot; A morphometric study published in 2010 showed that shell characteristics of &quot;S. spirula&quot; vary with geography, but no subspecies or additional species were proposed.

== Description ==
&quot;S. spirula&quot; has a squid-like body between 35 mm and 45 mm long. It is a decapod, with eight arms and two longer tentacles, all with suckers. The arms and tentacles can all be withdrawn completely into the mantle.

The species lacks a radula (or, at most, has a vestigial radula).

===Shell===
The most distinctive feature of this species is its buoyancy organ, an internal, chambered, endogastrically coiled shell in the shape of an open planispiral (a flat spiral wherein the coils do not touch each other), and consisting of two prismatic layers. The shell functions to osmotically control buoyancy. Unlike the nautilus, which exchange air and liquid only in the three most adoral chambers (the remaining chambers always being gas-filled), spirula can bring cameral fluid into all of their chambers. Another trait is that it is mineralized, a feature only seen in cuttlefish and the nautilus amongst extant species of cephalopods.

The siphuncle is marginal, on the inner surface of the spiral.


== Behaviour ==

&quot;S. spirula&quot; is capable of emitting a green light from a photophore located at the tip of its mantle, between the ear-shaped fins.
Evidently this seems as a counter-illumination strategy, as &quot;in situ&quot; observations have captured footage of animals in a vertical stance, with photophore pointing downward and head up.

== Habitat and distribution ==

By day, &quot;Spirula&quot; lives in the deep oceans, reaching depths of 1,000 m. At night, it rises to 100–300 m.
Its preferred temperature is around 10 °C, and it tends to live around oceanic islands, near the continental shelf.

Most sources cite this species as tropical and they are observed to be plentiful in the subtropical seas around the Canary Islands. Shells are regularly found along the western coasts of South Africa. In 2022, records of the species have also been confirmed in the Arabian Sea. However, significant quantities of shells from dead spirula are washed ashore even in temperate regions, such as coasts of New Zealand. Because of the great buoyancy of the shells, these may possibly have been carried long distances by ocean currents.

Much of the organism&#x27;s life history has not been observed; for instance, they are thought to spawn in winter in deeper water, yet no spawnlings have been directly seen. They must occasionally venture into the upper 10 m of the sea, for they are sometimes found in albatross guts.

The species was observed for the first time in its natural habitat in 2020, when an ROV of the Schmidt Ocean Institute recorded it in the depths near the northern Great Barrier Reef.

==Evolutionary relationships==
The order Spirulida also contains two extinct suborders: Groenlandibelina (including extinct families Groenlandibelidae and Adygeyidae), and Belopterina (including extinct families Belemnoseidae and Belopteridae).

&quot;Spirula&quot; is likely the closest living relative of the extinct belemnites and aulacocerids. These three groups as a unit are closely related to the cuttlefish, as well as to the true squids.

<doc id="334356" wikidata="Q7309104" url="?curid=334356" title="Regional Municipality of Sudbury">
<text>The Regional Municipality of Sudbury was a regional municipality that existed in Ontario, Canada, from 1973 to 2000, and was primarily centred on the city of Sudbury. It served as an upper-tier level of municipal government, aggregating municipal services on a region-wide basis like the counties and regional municipalities of Southern Ontario, and was the only upper-tier municipal government ever created in Northern Ontario. The regional municipality was dissolved with the creation of the amalgamated city of Greater Sudbury on January 1, 2001.

==Structure==
The regional municipality expanded the boundaries of the city of Sudbury to annex the community of Copper Cliff, the unincorporated geographic township of Broder, and half of the unincorporated geographic township of Dill. The other half of Dill Township — including the community of Wanup — remained unincorporated, although it was subsequently annexed into Greater Sudbury in 2001.

The existing town of Capreol also expanded its boundaries in 1973 to annex the unincorporated communities of Selwood and Milnet. However, despite its status as part of the regional municipality, Statistics Canada did not include the town in Sudbury&#x27;s Census Metropolitan Area for census purposes.

The towns of Nickel Centre, Onaping Falls, Rayside-Balfour, Valley East and Walden were all newly created by the amalgamation of several smaller towns and townships. Valley East, the largest and fastest-growing of the smaller towns, was granted city status in 1997. All of the municipalities were dissolved into the city of Greater Sudbury in 2001.

Each town and city in the regional municipality had its own mayor and council, and provided many of its own municipal services. The regional municipality had a regional council and chairman of its own, and provided certain services of region-wide interest, such as the regional road network, policing services, and social services.

This was the only regional municipality in Ontario not to originate from a former county government; instead, it was created out of the Sudbury District, which still surrounds the current city. Unlike the counties and regional municipalities of Southern Ontario, the more sparsely populated north is divided into unincorporated districts which do not serve as governing bodies. The Regional Municipality of Sudbury was — and the current city of Greater Sudbury still is — the only census division in Northern Ontario which has the structure and functionality of a Southern Ontario census division.

The regional offices were located at Civic Square, which was also the home of Sudbury&#x27;s city council. Civic Square was renamed Tom Davies Square in 1997 following the retirement of longtime regional chairman Tom Davies.

==History==
In the 1976 municipal election, the first municipal elections held after the creation of the regional municipality, voters in three of the suburban towns rejected the new level of government. The strongest opposition was in Onaping Falls, with the vote running against regional government by a margin of 20 to one. Despite the opposition, however, none of the towns was released from the regional government structure.

===Amalgamation===
On January 1, 2001, all of the seven incorporated municipalities, as well as the regional municipality itself, were amalgamated into the united city of Greater Sudbury. The former municipal names remain in informal use to designate the different areas of the city. The name &quot;Sudbury&quot; itself may be ambiguous, however — depending on the context, it may denote either the old city in isolation, or a shorthand name for the entire amalgamated city.

In addition to the former towns and cities of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury, the unincorporated townships of Dill, Cleland, Fraleck, Parkin, Aylmer, Mackelcan, Rathbun and Scadding were also annexed into the new city. The townships of Cleland and Dill encompass the communities of Wanup and St. Cloud, while the townships of Fraleck, Parkin, Aylmer, Mackelcan, Rathbun and Scadding comprise a wilderness area on the northeast side of Lake Wanapitei which contains only a few recreational properties. However, the annexation of this latter area into the city resulted in Lake Wanapitei supplanting Ramsey Lake, near downtown Sudbury, as the world&#x27;s largest lake contained entirely within the boundaries of a single city.

==Regional Council chairs==

Prior to the 1997 municipal elections, the regional chairman was elected to the position from within the regional council — in that year, the position became generally elected by all voters in the regional municipality. Peter Wong, a former mayor of Sudbury, became the region&#x27;s first elected chair, but died after just seven months in office. Following Wong&#x27;s death, councillor Doug Craig served as interim chair until he was succeeded by Frank Mazzuca, a former mayor of Capreol, in a 1998 by-election.

<doc id="334361" wikidata="Q1852225" url="?curid=334361" title="Missouri State Highway System">
<text>In Missouri, odd-numbered highways run north-south and even-numbered highways run east-west (with a few exceptions, such as Route 112). Missouri also maintains a secondary set of roads, supplemental routes, which are lettered rather than numbered.
Missouri has also changed highway designations with a US route or an interstate with the same number is designated through the state (Route 40 was redesignated Route 14 to avoid duplicating numbers with US-40 which also passes through the state). There are a few instances of number duplication between federal and state highways (such as with Route 72 and I-72), but any such pairs of highways are nowhere near each other to avoid confusion.

In some states (such as Arkansas and New Mexico), highways are allowed to be discontinuous. Missouri overlaps highways in order to maintain continuity.

The Missouri Department of Transportation routinely uses the term &quot;Route&quot; in reference to the names of the roads. However, Missouri statutes define them as &quot;State Highways&quot;. Missourians may use the terms &quot;Route&quot; and &quot;Highway&quot; interchangeably when referring to a state road.

<text>Yahtzee is a dice game made by Milton Bradley (a company that has since been acquired and assimilated by Hasbro). It was first marketed under the name of Yahtzee by game entrepreneur Edwin S. Lowe in 1956. The game is a development of earlier dice games such as Poker Dice, Yacht and Generala. It is also similar to Yatzy, which is popular in Scandinavia.

The objective of the game is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn to try to make various scoring combinations and dice must remain in the box. A game consists of thirteen rounds. After each round, the player chooses which scoring category is to be used for that round. Once a category has been used in the game, it cannot be used again. The scoring categories have varying point values, some of which are fixed values and others for which the score depends on the value of the dice. A Yahtzee is five-of-a-kind and scores 50 points, the highest of any category. The winner is the player who scores the most points.

Yahtzee was marketed by the E.S. Lowe Company from 1956 until 1973. In 1973, the Milton Bradley Company purchased the E.S. Lowe Company and assumed the rights to produce and sell Yahtzee. During Lowe&#x27;s ownership, over 40 million Yahtzee games were sold worldwide. According to the current owner, Hasbro, as of 2007, 50 million Yahtzee games are sold each year. A classic edition is currently being marketed by Winning Moves Games USA.

== History ==
The overall concept of Yahtzee traces its roots to a number of traditional dice games. Among these are the game Generala and the English games of Poker Dice and Cheerio.

The most important predecessor of Yahtzee is the dice game Yacht, which is an English cousin of Generala and dates back to at least 1938. Wood classifies Yacht, and a similar three-dice game called Crag, as sequence dice games. Yahtzee is similar to Yacht in both name and content. Although Yahtzee is clearly derived from Yacht, it differed from it in a number of significant ways:
*It introduced the upper section bonus.
*It included the &quot;Three of a Kind&quot; category.
*In Yacht both straights are a sequence of five (&quot;Big Straight&quot; is and &quot;Little Straight&quot; is ). Yahtzee introduced the sequence of four straight (the &quot;Small Straight&quot;).
*It introduced Yahtzee bonuses and the Joker rule.
*There were also a number of scoring differences.

The present-day commercial Yahtzee began when toy and game entrepreneur Edwin S. Lowe filed Yahtzee as a trademark with the U.S. Patent Office on April 19, 1956. The first commercial usage of the name Yahtzee was a few weeks earlier on April 3. Lowe classified his product as a Poker Dice Game. Lowe is also responsible for introducing Bingo to the U.S. market.

According to Hasbro, the game was invented by an anonymous Canadian couple, who called it The Yacht Game because they played it on their yacht with their friends. Later they asked Lowe if he would make up some sets to be given as gifts to their friends who enjoyed the game. Lowe perceived the possibility of marketing the game, and acquired the rights to the game from the couple in exchange for 1,000 gift sets. This story is expanded by Lowe in the 1973 book &quot;A Toy is Born&quot; by Marvin Kaye. According to Lowe, the game did not initially do well commercially, since the rules and appeal were not easily conveyed in an advertisement. Eventually, he had the idea of organizing Yahtzee parties at which people could play the game and thereby gain a first-hand appreciation of it. The idea was successful, and enthusiasts quickly popularized the game through word of mouth.

The E.S. Lowe Company sold Yahtzee from 1956 to 1973. During Lowe&#x27;s ownership, a number of changes were made to the game&#x27;s packaging, contents, and appearance. Between 1956 and 1961, the game&#x27;s advertising slogan was changed from &quot;The Game That Makes You &quot;Think&quot; While Having &quot;Fun&quot;&quot; to &quot;The &quot;Fun&quot; Game That Makes &quot;Thinking&quot; Fun!&quot;

The game and its contents were copyrighted by Lowe in 1956, 1961, 1967, and 1972. In 1973, Milton Bradley purchased the E.S. Lowe Company and assumed the rights to produce and sell Yahtzee. During Lowe&#x27;s ownership over 40 million Yahtzee games were sold in America and around the globe. The game has maintained its popularity. According to current owner Hasbro, as of 2007, 50 million Yahtzee games are sold each year.

Over time, the Yahtzee logo has taken several forms. The original version of the logo was used throughout the entire period that the game was produced solely by the Lowe company. After 1973, the logo changed various times. This logo is found on the scorecards and the game box(es).

==Rules==

The game consists of 13 rounds. In each round, a player gets three rolls of the dice, although they can choose to end their turn after one or two rolls. After the first roll the player can save any dice they want and re-roll the other dice. This procedure is repeated after the second roll. The player has complete choice as to which dice to roll. It is possible to re-roll any dice that were or were not rolled before.

The Yahtzee scorecard contains 13 different category boxes. After completing each round, a player must enter a score in one of these category boxes. The score entered in the box depends on how well the five dice match the scoring rule for the category. Once a score has been entered for a category, that category may not be used again by that player in that game. The game is completed after 13 rounds by each player, with each of the 13 boxes filled. The total score is calculated by summing all thirteen boxes, together with any bonuses.

Details of the scoring rules for each category are given below. As an example, one of the categories is called Three of a Kind. The scoring rule for this category means that a player only scores if at least three of the five dice are the same value. If a player chooses to score a roll in this category even though they do not have at least three dice of the same value, their score will be 0.

The Yahtzee scorecard contains 13 scoring boxes divided into upper and lower sections.

===Upper section===
In the upper section there are six boxes. The score in each of these boxes is determined by adding the total number of dice matching that box.

If a player scores a total of 63 or more points in these six boxes, a bonus of 35 is added to the upper section score. Although 63 points corresponds to scoring exactly three-of-a-kind for each of the six boxes, a common way to get the bonus is by scoring four-of-a-kind for some numbers so that fewer of other numbers are needed. A player can earn the bonus even if they score a &quot;0&quot; in an upper section box.

In order to gauge how well a player is doing in the upper section, they often refer to being &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; compared to the average of three required for each box. So that if a player scores four &quot;sixes&quot; they will be &quot;6 up&quot;; while if they then score just two &quot;twos&quot; they will then be only &quot;4 up&quot;. Similarly, if a player starts with two &quot;twos&quot; they will be &quot;2 down&quot;.

===Lower section===
The lower section contains a number of poker-themed categories with specific point values:
Some players count five of the same number (called a &quot;Yahtzee&quot;) as being a valid &quot;Full House&quot;. However, the official rule is that a &quot;Full House&quot; is &quot;three of one number and two of another&quot;. &quot;Small Straight&quot; and &quot;Large Straight&quot; are sometimes called &quot;Low Straight&quot; and &quot;High Straight&quot; (or simply &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High&quot;), &quot;Short Straight&quot; and &quot;Long Straight&quot;, or &quot;Little Straight&quot; and &quot;Big Straight&quot;.

If a category is chosen but the dice do not match the requirements of the category the player scores 0 in that category. Some combinations offer the player a choice as to which category to score them under; e.g., a full house could be scored in the &quot;Full House&quot;, the &quot;Three of a Kind&quot;, or the &quot;Chance&quot; categories. The &quot;Chance&quot; category is often used for a turn that will not score well in any other category.

===Yahtzee bonuses and Joker rules===

A &quot;Yahtzee&quot; occurs when all five dice are the same. If the player throws a Yahtzee and has already filled the Yahtzee box with a score of 50, they score a Yahtzee bonus and get an extra 100 points. However, if they throw a Yahtzee and have filled the Yahtzee category with a score of 0, they do not get a Yahtzee bonus.

In either case they then select a category, as usual. Scoring is the same as normal except that, if the Upper Section box corresponding to the &quot;Yahtzee&quot; has been used, the &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Small Straight&quot; and &quot;Large Straight&quot; categories can be used to score 25, 30 or 40 (respectively) even though the dice do not meet the normal requirement for those categories. In this case the &quot;Yahtzee&quot; is said to act as a &quot;Joker&quot;.

There are two alternative versions of the Joker rule used.

====Forced Joker rule====
In the official rules the player must act in the following way:

* If the corresponding Upper Section box is unused then that category must be used.
* If the corresponding Upper Section box has been used already, a Lower Section box must be used. The &quot;Yahtzee&quot; acts as a Joker so that the &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Small Straight&quot; and &quot;Large Straight&quot; categories can be used to score 25, 30 or 40 (respectively).
* If the corresponding Upper Section box and all Lower Section boxes have been used, an unused Upper Section box must be used, scoring 0.

====Free choice Joker rule====
In the simpler, alternative version of the Joker rule the player retains the free choice as to which category to use, but the &quot;Yahtzee&quot; can only be used as a Joker if the corresponding Upper Section box has been used. If the corresponding Upper Section box is unused the &quot;Yahtzee&quot; would score 0 if the &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Small Straight&quot; or &quot;Large Straight&quot; categories were chosen.

====Original Joker rule====
The original game rules released in 1956 contain a difference from the above rules. The booklet stated that additional Yahtzees must be used as Jokers in the Lower Section and did not allow for their use in the Upper Section. This rule was changed when the game was re-copyrighted in 1961.

The winner is the player with the highest total. The rules do not specify what happens in the event of a tie.

==Maximum score==
The highest possible score is 1,575 and involves throwing 13 Yahtzees, scoring 12 Yahtzee bonuses of 100 points each, as well as 375 in the other categories.
The 375 is achieved by scoring five aces (5), five twos (10), five threes (15), five fours (20), five fives (25), five sixes (30), the Upper Section bonus (35), five sixes scored as &quot;Three of a Kind&quot; (30), five sixes scored as a &quot;Four of a Kind&quot; (30), the &quot;Full House&quot; (25), the &quot;Small Straight&quot; (30), the &quot;Large Straight&quot; (40), five sixes scored as &quot;Chance&quot; (30), and &quot;Yahtzee&quot; (50). The score of 1,575 requires using the &quot;Joker&quot; rules for the &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Small Straight&quot;, and &quot;Large Straight&quot; categories.

The highest possible score without a Yahtzee bonus is 351, which is achieved with scoring a five-of-a-kind as a &quot;Yahtzee&quot;, 84 in the Upper Section (four-of-a-kind in each category), and 29 in each of &quot;Three of a Kind&quot;, &quot;Four of a Kind&quot;, and &quot;Chance&quot;. The highest possible score without rolling a five-of-a-kind is 301.

==Commercial versions==

===Deluxe and collector editions===
Deluxe edition games have been sold alongside the regular issue games since the early 1960s. They all contain components that are more luxurious than standard game parts. In recent years, a number of collector issue Yahtzee games have been sold as well. Some of these collector issues have dice that replace the pips with certain symbols connected to a theme, but still correspond to the numbers one to six.

===Travel Yahtzee===
Since the 1970s, Travel Yahtzee has been sold in various forms as part of Milton Bradley&#x27;s line of travel games.

* In the past, the travel form of Yahtzee was composed of the five dice contained in a special apparatus. &quot;Rolling&quot; the dice is initiated by turning the apparatus over, running it on one hand and turning it upright to see the faces of the dice. Dice to be saved for the next roll are locked by snapping the reverse of the apparatus.
* Currently, a zip-up cloth deluxe folio edition is sold. It consists of the set of dice, the cup, the scorecards and a tray for the dice to roll on, which includes a holder for the dice to be saved for the next roll. The cup has an oblong lip for easy storage.
* In addition to the game folio, Hasbro also released Yahtzee to Go. It comes with a dice cup that stores the dice and contents. This is similar to the original Travel Yahtzee only without the apparatus. This is sold in tandem with the game folio.
* There also exists a red circular travel edition, which includes the dice and scorecards as well as a collapsible cup and detachable dice holder. The bottom half of the case acts as a dice tray. This one uses a different logo from the standard one (the name of the game in uppercase with an exclamation point in front of a green oval) and it is sold outside the United States.
* There are also miniature versions of the game sold in sets contained either in cups that act as keychains (by the company Basic Fun) or in specially shaped pens (by the company Stylus).

===Electronic versions===
Various Yahtzee console games have been sold over the years including an early version on the TI-99/4A computer as well as a 1978 version introduced on the Apple II computer. In 1996, the game was first released to PC and Mac users by Atari. The &quot;Ultimate Yahtzee&quot; CD-ROM game contained standard Yahtzee as well as other varieties. Later, GameHouse also released an authorized special version of the game for Windows users. It was re-released by Hasbro Interactive in 2001 with 700 free hours of AOL.

There are also several electronic versions of the game such as a handheld LCD version, and a cell phone version called &quot;Yahtzee Deluxe&quot;, which feature the original rules along with Duplicate and Rainbow modes, as well as independently produced versions for the Palm OS and Pocket PC and several cellphone models. The version for the Nintendo Game Boy was licensed from Hasbro and was produced by DSI Games and Black Lantern Studios Inc. It was sold in a three pack that included &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Pay Day&quot;, and &quot;Yahtzee&quot;. The game has also been released for the iPod, iPod Touch and the iPhone, to be purchased through the iTunes Store, as well as Google Play. Both the iOS app and the Android App are published by Scopely. Yahtzee is available on the Xbox 360 in the &quot;Family Game Night&quot; game by Hasbro. Pogo.com released a version in 2009, and the game is also available on the Pogo Facebook site as well.

===Related games===

A number of related games under the Yahtzee brand have been produced. They all commonly use dice as the primary tool for gameplay, but all differ generally. The first was Triple Yahtzee, developed in 1972. The game has inspired two short-lived television game shows: 1975&#x27;s &quot;Spin-Off&quot; on CBS and 1988&#x27;s syndicated &quot;Yahtzee&quot;.

==Digital versions==
There are a large number of versions of Yahtzee which can be played online or are available to download.

* &quot;Open Yahtzee&quot; is a cross-platform open-source (free) version of Yahtzee for one player.
* &quot;YachtC&quot; is a commercially available free app on the Google Play Store. It has three variations: The traditional version, a &quot;7-sided&quot; dice version called &quot;Lucky7&quot;, and a &quot;TriColor&quot; version similar to Kismet.
*&quot;Gidd.io&quot; is a free multiplayer platform where Yahtzee can be played online with up to 20 players.
*Yahtzee is one of the games playable on Board Game Arena.

==Similar games==
There are a large number of related games. Yatzy is one of the most popular. Yatzy rules and scoring categories are somewhat different from Yahtzee:
*The bonus for reaching 63 or more points in the Upper Section is normally 50 points.
*There are two extra boxes for the &quot;One Pair&quot; and &quot;Two Pairs&quot; categories. These score the total of the pair(s) involved. For instance, will score 10 points in the &quot;One Pair&quot; box and 18 in the &quot;Two Pairs&quot; box. In the &quot;Two Pairs&quot; category, the pairs must be different.
*The &quot;Three of a Kind&quot; and &quot;Four of a Kind&quot; categories are scored using the total of the needed number of same-faced dice. For instance, will score 20 points in &quot;Four of a Kind&quot; and 15 points in &quot;Three of a Kind&quot;. This scoring rule is the same as the &quot;Four of a Kind&quot; scoring used in Yacht.
*&quot;Full House&quot; scores the total of all dice, as in Yacht.
*&quot;Small Straight&quot; and &quot;Large Straight&quot; have the same definitions as in Yacht. A &quot;Small Straight&quot; is and scores 15 points (the total of the dice faces); the &quot;Large Straight&quot; is and scores 20 points (again, the combined value of the dice).
*There are no Yahtzee bonuses or Joker rule. Yahtzees can be scored in other categories under the normal scoring rules. For example, a Yahtzee of sixes will score 12 in the &quot;One Pair&quot; box, 18 in &quot;Three of a Kind&quot;, 24 in &quot;Four of a Kind&quot;, 30 in &quot;Sixes&quot; or &quot;Chance&quot; and 0 in &quot;Two Pairs&quot;, &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Small Straight&quot; and &quot;Large Straight&quot; boxes.

Other related games include:
* Balut is the name of a Danish dice game played by expatriates in many countries all over the world. The name of the game is taken from balut eggs.
* Kismet has dice with multiple-colored pips. Both numbers and colors are taken into account when scoring.
* Yamb has several (usually four) columns filled with special restrictions and MINIMAX categories with the bigger score if the higher is difference between min and max.

==Mathematical aspects of Yahtzee==
The mathematics behind the game Yahtzee (and variants) has been studied extensively. It is a popular source of exercises for students of mathematics and computer science. The strategy for maximising score has been solved computationally by exhaustively evaluating all possible decisions. Optimal play gives an expectation score of 255.

<doc id="334363" wikidata="Q1939198" url="?curid=334363" title="Missouri Route 100">
<text>Route 100, also named Manchester Road through St. Louis County and Manchester Avenue and Chouteau Avenue through St. Louis City, is a state highway in the U.S. state of Missouri. It runs from Linn, Missouri at U.S. Route 50 to Interstate 55 in St. Louis. The highway is long.

==Route description==
Route 100 begins at US 50 in Linn. The highway heads north from Linn until it encounters the Missouri River, where it turns eastward to parallel the river. At Chamois, Missouri, it serves as the northern terminus of Route 89. It then enters Gasconade County near Morrison and bridges the Gasconade River near its mouth at the eponymous town. In the county seat, Hermann, Route 100 has a short concurrency with Route 19. The highway passes through New Haven, in Franklin County, later. The highway then intersects Route 185 at its northern terminus, and Route 47 in Washington. It becomes an expressway outside the city limits, which runs to near Gray Summit. Route 100 crosses over Interstate 44 two times, with an interchange providing access to the freeway.

Northeast of Gray Summit, Route 100 crosses into St. Louis County, entering the city limits of Wildwood at the same time. Just north of the intersection with Route T, the highway becomes an expressway again. In Wildwood, it has an interchange with Route 109. Route 100 then enters Ellisville, where the expressway ends. From here all the way into St. Louis, the highway also carries the local name Manchester Road. In Ellisville, Route 340 (Clarkson Road) meets its southern terminus. Route 100 then proceeds into Ballwin. It then divides Manchester from Winchester, Missouri before wholly entering Manchester, where it has a single-point urban interchange (SPUI) with Route 141. Route 100 then runs through a swath of unincorporated territory en route to Des Peres. The route crosses over Interstate 270, the St. Louis beltway, in that town. East of Ellisville, Route 100 enters Kirkwood; there, Manchester Road intersects Kirkwood Road (the name given to Lindbergh Boulevard in Kirkwood), which carries US 61/67. Route 100 then passes through the smaller suburbs of Warson Woods, Glendale, Rock Hill, Brentwood, and Maplewood.

After leaving Maplewood, Route 100 continues into the independent City of St. Louis where the name changes from &quot;Manchester Road&quot; to &quot;Manchester Avenue.&quot; As Manchester Avenue crosses Vandeventer Avenue, the highway becomes Chouteau Avenue. Route 100 continues east on Chouteau Avenue towards Downtown St. Louis. The route ends just east of South Broadway, at the Interstate 55 overpass. Due to the nearby east terminus of I-44, there is no interchange with I-55 at the state route&#x27;s terminus.

==The Lewis and Clark Trail==
Most of Route 100 is part of the Lewis and Clark Trail. From Kirkwood Rd in Kirkwood to three miles (5 km) west of Wildwood is one section, where the trail turns off on Route T. Route T will eventually end, once again, at Route 100 northwest of I-44 and continue down Route 100 all the way to five miles (8 km) north of Linn (where Route 100 ends), and the Lewis and Clark Trail turns off onto Route C.

Much of the road between St. Louis and Gray Summit was the original U.S. Route 66, though this was only temporary until US 66 moved to its later location at what is now Watson Rd (Route 366) and Interstate 44. During, and after US 66 was moved off Manchester Rd, the road remained part of U.S. Route 50 for many years.

<text>Laemanctus is a genus of lizards in the family Corytophanidae. Species in the genus &quot;Laemanctus&quot; are commonly referred to as conehead lizards or casquehead iguanas. The genus is endemic to Central America.

==Description==
Lizards of the genus &quot;Laemanctus&quot; exhibit the following characters. The tympanum is distinct. The plane of the top of the head slopes forward, and the occipital region is raised and extends beyond the occiput. The body is laterally compressed, and is covered with imbricate keeled scales. A strong transverse gular fold is present, but a gular pouch is absent. The limbs are very long, and the infradigital lamellae have a median tubercle-like keel. Femoral pores are absent. The tail is very long, and is round in cross section. The lateral teeth are tricuspid, and pterygoid teeth are present. The clavicle is loop-shaped proximally. A sternal fontanelle is absent. Abdominal ribs are absent.

==Species and subspecies==
The genus &quot;Laemanctus&quot; consists of four species which are recognized as being valid. Two of these species have recognized subspecies.

<text>Gambelia is a genus of lizards, commonly known as leopard lizards, within the family Crotaphytidae. Leopard lizards are indigenous to arid environments of southwestern North America.

==Description==
Species in the genus &quot;Gambelia&quot; superficially resemble those of the genus &quot;Crotaphytus&quot;. However, one difference between the genera &quot;Gambelia&quot; and &quot;Crotaphytus&quot; is that leopard lizards have fracture planes in their tails, allowing the tails to break off when grasped by predators.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Gambelia&quot;, is in honor of American naturalist William Gambel.

==Species==
Three species are recognized as being valid.

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Gambelia&quot;.

<text>The spiny weapontail (Hoplocercus spinosus) is a species of lizard belonging to the monotypic genus Hoplocercus in the family Hoplocercidae. The species is found in the Cerrado and adjacent Cerrado–Amazon mosaics in Brazil and Bolivia. 

==Taxonomy==
&quot;H. spinosus&quot; is quite distantly related to the other members of Hoplocercidae, as it is believed to have diverged from these about 35 million years ago.

==Description==
The spiny weapontail has a total length (including tail) of about . As suggested by its name, it has a short, highly spiny tail (it is superficially similar to &quot;Uromastyx&quot;, &quot;Cachryx&quot; and the smaller species in &quot;Ctenosaura&quot;).

When disturbed, &quot;H. spinosus&quot; retreats to its burrow with its tail orientated towards the entrance. It is nocturnal.

==Diet==
&quot;H. spinosus&quot; preys upon arthropods.

==Reproduction==
&quot;H. spinosus&quot; is oviparous.

<text>Leiocephalidae, also known as the curlytail lizards or curly-tailed lizards, is a family of iguanian lizards restricted to the West Indies. One of the defining features of these lizards is that their tail often curls over. They were previously regarded as members of the subfamily Leiocephalinae within the family Tropiduridae. There are presently 30 known species, all in the genus Leiocephalus.

== Taxonomy ==
Phylogenetic evidence supports Leiocephalidae being the most basal extant member of the clade Pleurodonta, with it diverging from the rest of the suborder as early as the Late Cretaceous, about 91 million years ago. As with many other higher-order taxa endemic to the Caribbean, it likely colonized the Antilles from South America during the Cenozoic; however, its deep divergence time from other lizards supports a much more complex and less straightforward history in the West Indies compared to other modern taxa.

Phylogenetic analysis on the genus supports some members of the now-extinct Lesser Antillean &quot;Leiocephalus&quot; radiation being the most basal of the recent &quot;Leiocephalus&quot;, with the last-surviving members of this group, &quot;L. herminieri&quot; and &quot;L. roquetus&quot;, sharing traits not present in other curlytail lizards from the Greater Antilles and other areas, such as the absence of enlarged snout scales. The second most basal of the recent curlytail lizards is another recently extinct species, &quot;L. eremitus&quot; from Navassa, followed by all other members of the genus from the Bahamas and Greater Antilles. Another extinct species from the Lesser Antilles known only from fossil remains, &quot;L. cuneus&quot; of Antigua and Barbuda, is thought to be more closely related to more derived &quot;Leiocephalus&quot; from the Bahamas and Greater Antilles, such as &quot;L. carinatus&quot;, &quot;L. greenwayi&quot; and &quot;L. punctatus&quot;, than to the other, more basal Lesser Antillean and Navassa species.

== Distribution ==
Curlytail lizards are native to the West Indies, with the extant (living) species in the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, Cayman Islands, Cuba, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and nearby small islands. Additionally, &quot;Leiocephalus carinatus&quot; and &quot;Leiocephalus schreibersii&quot; have been introduced to Florida.

=== Former distribution ===
Curlytail lizards formerly had a much wider native range, being distributed south to Jamaica and east to Puerto Rico and several of the Lesser Antilles. They went extinct in most of this range during the Quaternary extinction or Holocene extinction, with some members of the Lesser Antillean radiation surviving to recent times, perhaps remaining widespread until after European colonization. The last surviving members of the Lesser Antillean radiation, &quot;L. herminieri&quot; of Guadeloupe and &quot;L. roquetus&quot; of Martinique, went extinct during the early-mid 19th century.

== General anatomy ==
The curly-tailed lizards vary in size depending on species, but typically are approximately in snout-to-vent length. These lizards have no femoral pores, pterygoid teeth, or palatine teeth. Additionally, these lizards are observed to have overlapping scales.

== Behavior ==
The curly-tailed lizards mostly forage on arthropods such as insects, but also commonly take flowers and fruits. Large individuals will eat small vertebrates, including anoles.

As suggested by their name, most species of this family often lift their tail and curl it. This is done both when a potential predator is present and when not present, although in some curly-tailed lizard species it increases when a predator is present. It shows the fitness of the lizard to a would-be predator and—in the case of an attack—draws attention to the tail, which increases the lizard&#x27;s chance of escaping. Although it has been suggested that it also functions as a territorial display, studies have been unable to find support for this, as the tail curling does not vary when another member of the same species is present.

== Conservation status and extinctions ==
The conservation status of the species in this family varies greatly. Several species, for example &quot;Leiocephalus carinatus&quot;, are common and widespread. Others are rare and highly threatened, especially those restricted to a single small island or a single location on a larger island, like the critically endangered &quot;Leiocephalus (barahonensis) altavelensis&quot; from Alto Velo Island and critically endangered &quot;Leiocephalus onaneyi&quot; from Guantánamo Province in Cuba. Primary threats to their survival are habitat loss (for example, expanding agriculture, charcoal production and grazing goats) and introduced predators (for example, small Indian mongoose).

Several species of &quot;Leiocephalus&quot; are already extinct, including all of the Jamaican, Puerto Rican and Lesser Antillean members of the genus. Some of these are only known from fossil or subfossil remains and became extinct in the Pleistocene or pre-Columbian era, but others such as two Lesser Antillean species and one from Navassa survived until comparatively recently, during the 19th century. &quot;Leiocephalus&quot; is the only known squamate genus to be entirely wiped out from the Lesser Antilles following European colonization; other reptilian genera that have also seen significant extirpations in the Lesser Antilles, such as &quot;Boa&quot; or &quot;Diploglossus&quot;, still retain relict populations on at least some islands, such as Dominica and Montserrat. This mass disappearance of &quot;Leiocephalus&quot; from the Lesser Antilles may be due to their inhabiting dry forests in littoral areas that were heavily exploited and deforested by early colonists. Few confirmed &quot;Leiocephalus&quot; fossil remains from after the early Holocene are known from the Lesser Antilles, which has raised doubts about their being only recently extirpated from this area; however, &quot;Leiocephalus&quot; fossil bones are small and closely resemble those of other lizard species, which may explain the lack of detection of &quot;Leiocephalus&quot; fossil bones from these areas aside from by the most highly trained palaeo-herpetologists.

In modern times, three species, &quot;Leiocephalus endomychus&quot;, &quot;Leiocephalus pratensis&quot; and &quot;Leiocephalus rhutidira&quot;, have not been seen since the 1960s and 1970s and are recognized as critically endangered, possibly extinct, by the IUCN. They are among the &quot;most wanted&quot; EDGE species.

== Newly discovered species ==
Lizards of this family are diurnal and mostly inhabit fairly open habitats in a generally well-studied part of the world. Consequently, the majority of the species and subspecies already were scientifically described several decades ago. In 2016, the first new curly-tailed lizard since the early 1980s was described. The species was found in the coastal dunes of Bahía de las Calderas in the southwestern Dominican Republic. This species differs from the rest within Leiocephalidae in that its bony parietal table is U-shaped versus V-shaped, the males have 3–4 enlarged post-postcloacal scales versus 2, and there are specific sexual dimorphism trails.

== Species and subspecies ==
The following species and subspecies, listed alphabetically by scientific name, are recognized as being valid by the Reptile Database.

=== Extant and recently extinct species ===
=== Fossil and subfossil species ===

* †&quot;Leiocephalus anonymous&quot; – Hispaniola
* †&quot;Leiocephalus apertosulcus&quot; – Hispaniola
* †&quot;Leiocephalus cuneus&quot; – Leeward Islands curlytail (extinct, Late Quaternary of Antigua and Barbuda and potentially Anguilla, La Désirade, and Marie-Galante, but might have survived to recent times)
* †&quot;Leiocephalus etheridgei&quot; – Morovis curlytail (extinct, Late Pleistocene of Puerto Rico)
* †&quot;Leiocephalus jamaicensis&quot; – Jamaican curlytail (extinct, Late Pleistocene or Holocene of Jamaica)
* †&quot;Leiocephalus partitus&quot; – Guánica curlytail (extinct, Pleistocene or Holocene of Puerto Rico)

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority or trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species or subspecies was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Leiocephalus&quot;.

<doc id="334381" wikidata="Q2157646" url="?curid=334381" title="Ctenoblepharys adspersa">
<text>Ctenoblepharys adspersa is a liolaemid lizard within the monotypic genus Ctenoblepharys. It is endemic to the arid western coast of Peru. It is locally known as cabezona.

The species is secretive and arenicolous, meaning that it inhabits sandy areas. It is primarily found along coastal sand dunes and beaches, but also hyper-arid habitats, ephemeral streambeds, and &quot;Tillandsia&quot; groves further inland, as far as the Andean foothills. Much of its biology and ecology is unknown, though it is known to be oviparous (egg-laying) and excavates burrows up to a meter in length. It feeds on a wide variety of insects, the most common being hymenopterans (wasps, ants, etc.), followed by coleopterans (beetles) and insect larvae. Activity levels are greatest in the morning (9–11 AM) and in the afternoon (3–4 PM).

Compared to other liolaemids, it has a fairly broad head and large eyes, along with numerous unique skeletal features. Scales are generally small and granular, rather than overlapping. Elongated ciliary scales above the eyes are responsible for its genus name, which is Greek for &quot;eyelash comb&quot;. The limbs are fairly slender and the tail is longer than the body. It is a moderately-sized lizard, with a maximum snout-to-vent length (SVL) of 7.5 cm (3 inches), not including the tail. The species is well-camouflaged on sand: coloration is a series of white speckles on a backdrop of light and dark brown transverse bars.

&quot;Ctenoblepharys adspersa&quot; is rare and does not appear to be tolerant of human disturbance. Urban development and expansion of resort towns and the Lima Metropolitan Area have led to population fragmentation along a large portion of the species&#x27; native range. Continued development and habitat loss will lead to further pressure on the species, as will climate change. Due to its limited range, fragmented population, and habitat degradation, it has been rated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2014. It occurs in a few protected areas, including Lomas de Lachay and Paracas National Reserve.

<doc id="334383" wikidata="Q3285029" url="?curid=334383" title="Mammoth Mountain Ski Area">
<text>Mammoth Mountain Ski Area is a ski resort in eastern California, located on the east side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range within the Inyo National Forest. The resort is located in the town of Mammoth Lakes, California. The resort covers 3,500 acres (1,420 ha) of skiable terrain, with a vertical drop of 3,100 feet (940 m) and a summit elevation of 11,059 feet (3,371 m). It receives an average of 400 inches (1,020 cm) of snowfall annually and typically offers a ski season from November until May, with some seasons extending into the summer months. 

Mammoth Mountain, established by Dave McCoy in the 1940s, developed from a small ski area into a major resort after receiving a U.S. Forest Service permit in 1953 and constructing its first ski lift in 1955. Intrawest Corporation acquired a stake in the 1990s, leading to real estate development, including The Village at Mammoth. In 2005, McCoy sold his majority stake to Starwood Capital Group for $365 million. The resort has undergone infrastructure improvements, including high-speed lifts and a gondola to an interpretive center. In 2017, Mammoth Resorts announced its sale by Starwood to a partnership of Aspen Skiing Company and KSL Capital Partners, later named Alterra Mountain Company.

Mammoth Mountain is a lava-dome complex on the southwest rim of Long Valley Caldera, representing a magmatic system distinct from both the caldera and the Mono-Inyo Craters. Its last magmatic eruption occurred about 50,000 years ago, and it is surrounded by over 35 mafic vents with recent volcanic unrest linked to a 1989 dike intrusion. In April 2006, three members of the Mammoth Mountain ski patrol team died after falling into a volcanic fumarole near the summit during safety operations. 

==Terrain and resort overview==

=== Terrain ===
Mammoth Mountain&#x27;s terrain is primarily north-facing (65%), ensuring excellent snow retention. The east (22%) and west (10%) aspects offer varied exposure, while the minimal south-facing terrain (3%) sees the most variable conditions. The top of the mountain has challenging chutes and groomed as well as mogul runs. 

==== Terrain parks ====
There are eight Unbound terrain parks. Unbound Main, adjacent to Main Lodge, is highly praised by extreme snowboarding and skiing enthusiasts, and is one of the major attractions of the ski resort.

=== The Village, lodges and chalets ===
Mammoth Mountain offers a variety of lodges and chalets catering to different skiing and snowboarding experiences, including Main Lodge, the central hub with direct lift access and amenities; Canyon Lodge, a popular mid-mountain base with a gondola connection to The Village; and Eagle Lodge, a quieter, family-friendly area with easy terrain access. 

Mid-Chalet, Outpost, and The Mill serve as key on-mountain spots for dining, relaxation, and access to trails. The Mid-Chalet, which once had picnic tables on its roof, was completely remodeled in the early 2000s, renamed McCoy Station, and now features gourmet foods and a cafeteria. Large vintage photos of McCoy and his family can be found hanging from the ceiling there. The Mill Cafe, a small rustic bar and snack area was built in the early 2000s.

The Village at Mammoth, a European-style and pedestrian-only complex, was built in a style similar to other Intrawest properties, such as Whistler in British Columbia or Keystone in Colorado. The Village opened in 2003 with various stores, restaurants, galleries and 166 luxury condominiums. 

=== Chairlifts and gondolas ===
Almost all the old, slow, double chair lifts were replaced with high-speed quad, and six-seater lifts, traveling at around 1000 feet per minute. For these modernizations, the resort is a longtime customer to the Doppelmayr group. Several old lifts were also removed. 

Before and during the changes of ownership, the ski area underwent major changes. The resort went from 16 chairs in the 1980s to 23 today. A new gondola was built that ends at an interpretive center at . 

The 15-passenger Village Gondola, which departs from the Village, transports people directly to the Canyon Lodge base.

In 2011, Chair 5 was chosen to be upgraded for the 2011–2012 season. Chair 5 was upgraded from a Yan-fixed three person chair to a Doppelmayr high speed quad. The ride time is reported to be half as long, and the capacity was increased from 1800 an hour to an estimated 2400 people an hour. In line with tradition, the chair was also given a new name: High Five Express.

=== Ski season length ===
Mammoth Mountain also has one of the longest ski seasons in North America, which averages from the start of November to Memorial Day. The resort occasionally enjoys a longer season, as in 2016/2017, when it opened on November 8 and did not close until August 6th. The 1994–95 season was Mammoth Mountain&#x27;s longest, with the resort operating over ten months from October 8 until August 13. The 2016–2017 season was the third snowiest on record, with 618 inches (2010–2011 with 668.5 inches was the second snowiest, and the 2022–2023 season total holds the record with 715 inches at the main lodge, and nearly 900 inches at the summit). January 2017 was the snowiest month in Mammoth history, with 246 inches. Mammoth receives an average of of snow per season.

=== Zipline ===
As of 2018, a zip-line was under construction. If complete, it will be the steepest in North America. It goes from the top of the mountain near the upper gondola to the bottom near Main Lodge, with a stop near the top of Chair 1.

=== Mascot ===
Mammoth Mountain has a popular mascot named &quot;Woolly&quot; who can be found skiing around the mountain, taking pictures with guests, and leading events like a Saturday parade for children. He also appears in promotional videos. Many guests consider it lucky when they have a Woolly sighting. According to Powder Magazine, Woolly is the 8th-best mascot (but they would have rated Woolly higher if Woolly didn&#x27;t also snowboard). Despite the mascot name &quot;Woolly&quot;, woolly mammoths never existed in the region.

== Notable skiing and snowboarding ==

=== Events ===
Mammoth Mountain has hosted numerous ski and snowboarding events, including U.S. Grand Prix competitions, which serve as Olympic qualifiers for freestyle skiing and snowboarding. The mountain has also been a venue for FIS World Cup events, featuring disciplines such as halfpipe and slopestyle. Additionally, Mammoth Mountain serves as a training site for elite snowboarders due to its extensive terrain parks and consistent snowfall. 

=== Athletes ===

* Shaun White trained at Mammoth Mountain throughout his career and later purchased a stake in the resort. 
* Danny Kass, a two-time Olympic silver medalist in halfpipe snowboarding, trained at Mammoth Mountain during his career.

==History and ownership==

=== Founding by Dave McCoy ===
Mammoth was founded by Dave McCoy, a hydrographer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. As a member of the Eastern Sierra Ski Club in the 1930s, McCoy noticed that Mammoth Mountain consistently held more snow than other mountains. The Ski Club had a portable rope tow. McCoy bought the rope tow from the club in 1941 and usually kept it at Mammoth. In 1953, the United States Forest Service awarded a permit to McCoy to operate the ski area, and the first ski lift was built in 1955.

McCoy faced adversity in growing the ski area: drought in 1958–59, the 1973 oil crisis, and only 94&quot; inches of snow during the 1976–1977 season, the worst in Mammoth&#x27;s history.

===Sale to Intrawest===

In January 1996, Intrawest Corporation and Mammoth Mountain Ski area announced that Intrawest Corporation had purchased 33% of Mammoth and June Mountain ski operations, as well as all of the developable real estate owned by Mammoth Mountain Ski Area. In 1998, Intrawest increased their partnership interest to 58%. The development of three new village areas: The Village at Mammoth, Sierra Star, and Juniper Springs, brought new developments to the resort.
===Subsequent owners===
On February 23, 2005, Dave McCoy announced the pending sale of his stake in Mammoth Mountain, after 68 years of running the ski area. On October 5, 2005, Mammoth announced that a majority stake will be sold to Starwood Capital Group, a private equity fund specializing in real estate, run by Barry Sternlicht. The sale price was $365 million. In 2017, Mammoth Resorts announced its sale by Starwood to a partnership of Aspen Skiing Company and KSL Capital Partners, later named Alterra Mountain Company.

== Location &amp; accessibility ==

=== Location ===
Mammoth Mountain is located in California&#x27;s Eastern Sierra approximately south of the Nevada state line and 50 minutes from the Eastern Gate of Yosemite National Park. 

=== Accessibility ===

==== Highways ====
Although it is a five-hour drive from Los Angeles via U.S. 395, it is much closer for southern California winter sports enthusiasts than the Lake Tahoe area resorts, which are more accessible to the San Francisco Bay Area. Most mountain passes along the Sierra crest are closed after the first major snowfall, and this lack of a trans-Sierra travel route creates a long drive to Mammoth (6–8 hours) from the Bay Area and most of central California. For example: during the summer, the distance from Fresno to Mammoth Lakes is , while in winter it nearly doubles to .

==== Airlines ====
In recent years, Mammoth has hosted more visitors from outside of California and Nevada. Scheduled passenger service, as of April 2024, is available to Eastern Sierra Regional Airport (BIH), about 45 min from Mammoth Lakes from San Francisco (SFO) and Denver International Airport (DEN) on a seasonal basis.

== Notable incidents ==
As the ski area grew, McCoy faced adverse circumstances: the 1973 oil crisis, an avalanche in 1979 that destroyed a ski lift, and a prolonged drought that led to layoffs in 1991.

=== Plane crash ===

In 1973, the resort bought Sierra Pacific Airlines from 3-D film cinematographer Chris Condon. On March 13, 1974, a film crew for Wolper Productions filming a National Geographic history of Australopithecus at the resort was killed when their Convair 440 aircraft (N4819C) flew into a ridge shortly after an evening take-off from Eastern Sierra Regional Airport in Bishop, killing all 35 on board including 31 Wolper crew members—although not Wolper himself. The filmed segment was recovered in the wreckage and was broadcast in the television show &quot;Primal Man&quot;. The National Transportation Safety Board was unable to determine the cause of the accident, and the resort sold the airline. Sierra Pacific previously operated scheduled passenger flights with turboprop aircraft between Mammoth Lakes and Burbank, Fresno, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.

=== 2006 ski patrol deaths ===
On April 6, 2006, three ski patrollers at the ski area perished either due to a fall or combination of CO2 and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) poisoning. Both gases are present on a known dangerous fumarole on the mountain and were more concentrated on that day because the fumarole had been covered by snow for days. Four patrollers, including John &quot;Scott&quot; McAndrews and James Juarez, were raising the fence around the fumarole, which had become buried due to heavy snowfall. The fumarole had melted a cavern below the snowbridge which collapsed under James and Scott. The pair of men fell and perished within a matter of minutes. Another ski patroller, Walt Rosenthal, perished in a rescue attempt, which injured seven others. The oxygen masks used by the Mammoth Mountain ski patrol did not properly seal, allowing hazardous gases to come in.

=== Ski patrol death from avalanche ===
On February 14, 2025, at approximately 11:30 a.m., two Mammoth Mountain Ski Patrol members were caught in an avalanche on Lincoln Mountain during mitigation efforts following a significant snowstorm that deposited about six feet of snow over 36 hours. One patroller was extracted and found responsive, while the other sustained serious injuries and was transported to Mammoth Hospital before being flown out for further care. The area was closed to the public at the time, and the resort suspended all operations at noon for the remainder of the day. On February 22, 2025, the ski patroller, who had been taken to the hospital, died from her injuries.

<text>Liolaemus is a genus of iguanian lizards, containing many species, all of which are endemic to South America.

== Description ==

Members of the genus &quot;Liolaemus&quot; form a dominant part of the lizard fauna of the southern part of the continent of South America, and vary considerably in size ( snout–vent length) and weight ().

== Geographic range ==
&quot;Liolaemus&quot; species are found in the Andes and adjacent lowlands, from Peru to Tierra del Fuego, at altitudes that can exceed . The genus has been recorded at above sea level on Chachani mountain, which is the highest recorded altitude for any reptile species.

&quot;Liolaemus magellanicus&quot; and &quot;Liolaemus sarmientoi&quot; are the world&#x27;s southernmost reptiles, living as far south as Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego and the northern shores of the Strait of Magellan respectively.

== Diet ==
Most species of &quot;Liolaemus&quot; are omnivorous, but a few purely insectivorous and herbivorous species are known.

== Species ==

There are more than 225 described species in the genus &quot;Liolaemus&quot;, but the true number of species may be about double this number. &quot;Liolaemus&quot; is by far the largest genus of the liolaemid lizards, which are traditionally treated as subfamily Liolaeminae within the Iguanidae but more recently were proposed for upranking to full family Liolaemidae.

== Pets ==
Some species of &quot;Liolaemus&quot; have been recently kept as pets, and as many of them originate from regions that experience cold conditions, they are named &quot;snow swifts&quot;. More generally, the genus is known as &quot;tree iguanas&quot;.

<doc id="334385" wikidata="Q2714276" url="?curid=334385" title="Phymaturus">
<text>Phymaturus is a genus of iguanian lizards of the family Liolaemidae, a family which was traditionally included in the Iguanidae as a subfamily, but more recently was proposed to warrant family status in the Liolaemidae. &quot;Phymaturus&quot; is the mid-sized genus of its family, with 50 species altogether known as of 2021; new species are still being discovered, however.

Species of the genus &quot;Phymaturus&quot; are found in the Andes region south to Patagonia and inhabit a variety of habitats. Their habits are mostly conserved from the ancestral iguanians, in that &quot;Phymaturus&quot; are generally inhabitants of rocky ground, feed on plants, and give birth to fully developed young.

==Systematics==
The genus can be divided into two lineages, which probably represent clades:

&quot;palluma&quot; group
:Superciliar scales not imbricate, more than four subocular scales, 3-4 rows of lorilabial scales, mental scale narrower than rostral scale and usually touching the sublabial scales. Tail spines well-developed, two annuli per segment.

&quot;patagonicus&quot; group
:Superciliar scales elongate and overlapping, one usually unfragmented subocular scale, tail smooth, Meckel&#x27;s groove fused and closed.

More species which may or may not belong to the aforementioned species groups:
&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Phymaturus&quot;.

<doc id="334386" wikidata="Q14422480" url="?curid=334386" title="Chalarodon">
<text>&quot;Chalarodon&quot; is a genus of Malagasy terrestrial iguanian lizard. It was considered a monotypic genus, until in 2015 a second species, &quot;Chalarodon steinkampi&quot;, was recognised based on morphology and DNA sequence data. The common names of this genus include Chalarodon or Dangalia lizard.

Its Malagasy relatives are the iguanians of the genus &quot;Oplurus&quot;.

==Species==
Two species of &quot;Chalarodon&quot; exist:
==Habitat==
Members of this genus inhabit semi-arid to arid regions and almost entirely open, or very sparsely vegetated habitats with sandy soil in southern, western, and south eastern Madagascar.

==Nutrition==
The Madagascar sand lizards are insectivores. In addition to insects, sometimes plants are ingested, particularly in the form of leaves and roots.

==Reproduction==
During the mating season, males defend territories with threat displays and combat. Copulation is very brief, and females lay pairs of eggs between December and March.

<text>Oplurus is a genus of Malagasy iguanian lizards, most of which are rock-dwelling terrestrial species.

The sister genus to &quot;Oplurus&quot; is &quot;Chalarodon&quot;, which contains two species: &quot;Chalarodon madagascariensis&quot; and &quot;Chalarodon steinkampi&quot;, which are terrestrial iguanas and easily distinguished from &quot;Oplurus&quot; by its smaller size and the presence of a distinct dorsal crest.

==Species==
The six recognized species in the genus &quot;Oplurus&quot; comprise two distinct clades.

*Spiny-tailed arboreal clade:
**Merrem&#x27;s Madagascar swift (&quot;Oplurus cyclurus&quot;)
**Collared iguana (&quot;Oplurus cuvieri&quot;)
* (rock dwelling) clade:
**Madagascar blue iguana (&quot;Oplurus fierinensis&quot;) (greyish-blue without dark dorsal bands)
**Grandidier&#x27;s Madagascar swift (&quot;Oplurus grandidieri&quot; (with light mid-dorsal band)
**Duméril&#x27;s Madagascar swift (&quot;Oplurus quadrimaculatus&quot;) (with four dorsal bands, dorsal scales coarsely granular)
**Marked Madagascar swift (&quot;Oplurus saxicola&quot;) (different darker color pattern, dorsal scales finely granular)

Because of differences is appearance (i.e. the lack of a black neck band), possibly a larger body, and its geographic isolation, the form of &quot;Oplurus cuvieri&quot; species found on the Comoro archipelago has recently been given full species rank, as &quot;Oplurus comorensis&quot; (Meirte 2004). However the molecular phylogeny research concludes that this full species status is unwarranted.

==Distribution==
All six species of &quot;Oplurus&quot; are all found in Madagascar, with five being endemic. &quot;Oplurus cuvieri&quot; is also found on Grande Comore 
. Subfossil remains of a large, extinct, species have also been found on Aldabra.

The two spiny-tailed species (&quot;Oplurus cuvieri&quot;, &quot;Oplurus cyclurus&quot;) and &quot;Oplurus fierinensis&quot; are found in the arid parts of the south and west of Madagascar, whilst the other three species are found on the ground and rocks in the central and southern highland regions and the south. &quot;Oplurus cuvieri&quot; is the most widely distributed, and the only species found in Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park.

<doc id="334388" wikidata="Q169498" url="?curid=334388" title="Zebra-tailed lizard">
<text>The zebra-tailed lizard (Callisaurus draconoides) is a species of lizard in the family Phrynosomatidae. The species is native to the Southwestern United States and adjacent northwestern Mexico. There are nine recognized subspecies.

==Habitat==
Zebra-tailed lizards live in open desert with hard-packed soil, scattered vegetation, and scattered rocks, typically flats, washes, and plains.

==Description==
Zebra-tailed lizards range in size from in snout-to-vent length (SVL). These lizards are grey to sandy brown, usually with a series of paired dark gray spots down the back, becoming black crossbands on the tail. The underside of the tail is white with black crossbars. Males have a pair of black blotches on their sides, extending to blue patches on their bellies. Females have no blue patches, and the black bars are either faint or completely absent. 

==Behavior==
Zebra-tailed lizards are diurnal and alert. They rise early and are active in all but the hottest weather. During the hottest times of day, lizards may stand alternately on two legs, switching to the opposite two as needed in a kind of dance. When threatened, they run swiftly with their toes curled up and tails raised over their backs, exposing the stripes. When stopped, they wag their curled tails side-to-side to distract predators. They can even run on their hind legs for short distances. In areas of creosote scrub, this lizard reaches its highest population densities, around 4.8 to 6.0 individuals per acre (600 to 800 m2 per lizard). This lizard burrows into fine sandy soil for retreat at night and usually seeks day shelter in the shade of bushes. It is also known to burrow under sand for safety when being chased by predators.

==Reproduction==
In summer, zebra-tailed lizards typically lay two to eight eggs, which hatch from July to November, but more than one clutch can be laid during a season. Eggs are laid, presumably, in friable, sandy soil. Being a prey species for many animals, including birds, other lizards, and mammals, they have a fairly high reproductive rate.

==Diet==
Lizards of the genus &quot;Callisaurus&quot; feed on a variety of prey, from insects, such as moths, ants and bees, to spiders and other smaller lizards. The diet occasionally includes vegetation, such as spring buds and flowers.

==Geographic range==
Zebra-tailed lizards are common and widely distributed throughout the Southwestern United States, ranging from the Mojave and Colorado deserts north into the southern Great Basin.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Callisaurus&quot; is monotypic, containing only one species, &quot;C. draconoides&quot;. Nine subspecies are recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies.

*&quot;C. d. bogerti&quot; – Bogert&#x27;s zebra-tailed lizard
*&quot;C. d. brevipes&quot; – short-footed zebra-tailed lizard
*&quot;C. d. carmenensis&quot; – Carmen Island zebra-tailed lizard
*&quot;C. d. crinitus&quot; – Viscaino zebra-tailed lizard
*&quot;C. d. draconoides&quot; – common zebra-tailed lizard
*&quot;C. d. inusitanus&quot; – Sonoran zebra-tailed lizard
*&quot;C. d. myurus&quot; – Nevada zebra-tailed lizard
*&quot;C. d. rhodostictus&quot; – Mojave zebra-tailed lizard
*&quot;C. d. ventralis&quot; – eastern zebra-tailed lizard

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Callisaurus&quot;.

==Etymology==
The subspecific name, &quot;bogerti&quot;, is in honor of American herpetologist Charles Mitchill Bogert.

<doc id="334389" wikidata="Q2355833" url="?curid=334389" title="Greater earless lizard">
<text>The greater earless lizard (Cophosaurus texanus) is the only species in the monotypic genus &quot;Cophosaurus&quot;. It is closely related to the smaller, lesser earless lizards and other species in the genus &quot;Holbrookia&quot;, and in fact was placed in that genus and referred to &quot;Holbrookia texana&quot; from 1852 into the 1970s. Earless lizards lack external ear openings, an adaptation to burrowing in the sand, as are the recessed lower jaw and flared upper labial scales. Greater earless lizards are sexually dimorphic, males grow larger and are more colorful than females, exhibiting pink and green colors that are particularly bright in the breeding season. Two bold black bars mark the lateral region of males but are greatly reduced and vague, or occasionally entirely absent in females.

The greater earless lizard is native to the Chihuahua Desert and other arid and semi-arid regions of Southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they most often occupy moderately open areas of sparse vegetation with rocks, gravel, and sand. The overall color of individual lizards frequently match the colors of the rocks and soils of the local area they inhabit. They will often rely on camouflage and their speed to elude threats and predators before retreating into rock crevices. They are primarily insectivores, preying on wide variety of crickets, grasshoppers, caterpillars, ants, flies, beetles, and bugs. Spiders and small lizards are occasionally eaten as well. &quot;Cophosaurus&quot; are oviparous. Females lay 1 to 4 clutches of 2 – 9 eggs a year, with hatchlings emerging from June to October, and reaching adult size and sexual maturity in one year.

==Etymology==
The generic name &quot;Cophosaurus&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;copho&quot; (κουφός), meaning &quot;deaf&quot;, and &quot;saurus&quot;, meaning &quot;lizard&quot;, in reference to the animal&#x27;s absent external ear openings. The trivial name, or specific epithet &quot;texanus&quot;, is a toponym in reference to the state of Texas, the original location where the specimens used in the lizard&#x27;s description were collected. The subspecific names are both Latin, &quot;reticulatus&quot;, meaning &quot;reticulated&quot; or a &quot;net-like&quot; pattern, and &quot;scitulus&quot;, meaning &quot;handsome&quot; or &quot;pretty&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
Within the family Phrynosomatidae, &quot;Cophosaurus&quot; is most closely related to the zebra-tailed (&quot;Callisaurus&quot;), lesser earless (&quot;Holbrookia&quot;) and fringe-toed lizards (&quot;Uma&quot;), collectively forming the tribe Callisaurini, commonly referred to as the sand lizards. The genus &quot;Cophosaurus&quot; is monotypic, as &quot;Cophosaurus texanus&quot; is the only species within the genus. Franz Hermann Troschel described &quot;Cophosaurus&quot; (as well as the species &quot;C. texanus&quot;) in a paper dated to 1850 (but not published until 1852). Later, that same year, the species was transferred to the genus &quot;Holbrookia&quot; in a review by Spencer Fullerton Baird and Charles Frédéric Girard, and subsequent literature used the name &quot;H. texana&quot; for well-over a century. Troschel&#x27;s description was based on two specimens, cotypes or syntypes, both lost in the Second World War. In 1951, James A. Peters published a review of the species, recognizing three subspecies and designating a neotype for &quot;C. t. texanus&quot;, although still placing them in the genus &quot;Holbrookia&quot;. In a 1958 Ph.D. dissertation reviewing the genus &quot;Holbrookia&quot;, herpetologist Ralph W. Axtell omitted &quot;H. texana&quot; with little comment, something which was noted by Robert F. Clarke in his 1965 Ph.D. dissertation (subsequently placing the species back in the original genus, &quot;Cophosaurus&quot;). Both combinations, &quot;C. texanus&quot; and &quot;H. texana&quot;, were used by various authors during the 1970s, although, despite arguments for the placement of the species in &quot;Holbrookia&quot;, &quot;Cophosaurus&quot; was in predominant use by the 1980s; later allozymes analyses supported the recognition of the genus.

Three subspecies are currently recognized (2022), with standardized English names.
* Texas greater earless lizard, &quot;Cophosaurus texanus texanus&quot;, Troschel 1852 [1850]
* Sonoran greater earless lizard, &quot;Cophosaurus texanus reticulatus&quot;, (Peters 1951)
* Chihuahuan greater earless lizard, &quot;Cophosaurus texanus scitulus&quot;, (Peters 1951)

==Description==
The greater earless lizard is a medium-sized lizard (relative to other species in its range) and the largest of the earless lizards. A range of sizes have been reported by various authors: Texas greater earless lizard (&quot;C. t. texanus&quot;), males , females ; Chihuahuan greater earless lizard (&quot;C. t. scitulus&quot;), males , females in total lengths are representative of the species.
Greater earless lizards do not have external ear openings. The scales on the body are small and granular, with the dorsal scales slightly smaller than the ventral scales. Their legs, particularly the hind legs, are relatively long. The tail is slightly flattened and longer than head and body combined. The underside of the tail is white with 5 to 9 (usually 6 or 7) bold, contrasting black bands (excluding individuals with regenerated tails). The base color can be various shades of grays, browns, tans, or reddish brown and generally close to the prevailing colors of the local substrate. &quot;Cophosaurus texanus&quot; is a sexually dimorphic species, in addition to size differences, males and females differ in some aspects of colors and markings. Most noticeable in males are a pair of black bands located on the posterior third on the sides of the body, rising from two blue patches on the margins of the belly up sides and arching forward and ending before meeting on the back. The body anterior to the black bands is suffused with some shade of pink, orange, or red, and the body posterior to the black bands tented green, aqua-green, or lime-green. The colors are most prominent in the Chihuahuan greater earless lizard (&quot;C. t. scitulus&quot;) and are greatly enhanced and most noticeable in the breeding season in all subspecies. In parts of their range they are colloquially referred to as &quot;the lizard with the pink shirt and green pants.&quot; In contrast, females either lack the black lateral bands entirely or they are very faint and indistinct. Females and young often exhibit a lateral white or near white stripe running between the forelimbs and hind limbs and on the back of the legs.

The subspecies were diagnosed in the original description with the following characters. &quot;Cophosaurus t. texana&quot;: typically, 80–86%, have 79 ventral scales or less from collar (last gular fold) to anus, 40 or more scales in head length, and 27 or less total femoral pores. &quot;Cophosaurus t. scitula&quot;: 80–84% have 80 or more ventral scales, 39 or less head scales, 28 or more femoral pores. &quot;Cophosaurus t. reticulata&quot;: 85–100% have 82 ventral scales, 36 or less head scales, less than 31 femoral pores, and the black lateral bars are faint and do not extend above the lateral fold in males.

==Distribution==

The greater earless lizard occurs in the southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas) and northern Mexico (Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí, Sonora, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas). Elevations ranging from 127 to 2100 meters have been reported.
The Texas greater earless lizard (&quot;C. t. texanus&quot;) occurs on the Edwards Plateau of Central Texas and northward to the state border with Oklahoma and southeastern areas of the Texas panhandle. It ranges southward into the Tamaulipan mezquital ecoregion, and along the Rio Grande into northeast Coahuila and north-central Nuevo León, Mexico. In south-central Tamaulipas, its occurrence becomes increasingly spotty and localized, with records just across the southern state line in eastern San Luis Potosí. Several accounts have commented on the problematic and poorly-defined zone of integration between the subspecies &quot;C. t. texanus&quot; and &quot;C. t. scitulu&quot;.

The Chihuahuan greater earless lizard (&quot;C. t. scitulus&quot;) occurs throughout much of the Chihuahuan Desert, including much of the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas, the southern third of New Mexico (following the Pecos and Rio Grande river basins northward), and southeastern Arizona (east of the Sonora Desert), following a zone of semi-arid habitats around the northeastern margins of the Sonoran Desert almost to the California border. In Mexico, it ranges into northeastern Chihuahua, much of Coahuila, northeastern Durango, extreme northeastern Zacatecas, extreme southern Nuevo León, northern San Luis Potosí, and extreme southwestern Tamaulipas. It is absent from higher elevations in the Sierra Madre Oriental, however it does range deeper into the canyons and valleys on both the eastern and western versants of the mountain range.

The Sonoran greater earless lizard (&quot;C. t. reticulatus&quot;) is endemic to northeastern Sonora, Mexico, between 470 – 1300 meters, where, as recently as 2016, it was reportedly known from only eight localities.

==Ecology and natural history==
===Reproduction===

The longevity of the greater earless lizard is typically 3 years, but records of individuals surviving five reproductive seasons in the wild have been documented. Both males and females reach adult size in a year, attaining maturity and mating before their second winter. Mating occurs from April to August, peaking between late April and early July. Gravid females often exhibit pink, orange or yellow colors on their throats and sides. In one study, gravid females were only found in May and June. Multiple clutches, up to four a year, are scattered over a wide area, with clutch size ranging from 2 to 9 eggs (average 3-5); more mature females produce larger clutches than younger females. One study reported finding single eggs buried in the sand on three occasions, but never locating a clutch. The incubation period is about 50 days. The hatchlings emerge from June to October, with reports of sizes varying from 20 to 25 mm. to 26–31 mm. snout–vent length.

===Diet===
The greater earless lizard is predominantly an insectivore and a generalist. A study in Mohave County, Arizona found insects comprised 85% of the diet, including 18.2% Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers, locusts), 15.8% Hymenoptera (ants, bees, sawflies, wasps), and 10.1% Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), 9.2% Diptera (flies), 9.2% Coleoptera (beetles), and 8.4% Hemiptera (true bugs). Spiders made up 7.9% of the diet and &quot;Cophosaurus&quot; were found to occasionally feed on small lizards, particularly ornate tree lizards (&quot;Urosaurus ornatus&quot;), in the late summer and early spring when hatchling emerged and were abundant. Another study conducted in the Mapimí Biosphere Reserve in Durango, Mexico, found the most frequent prey items were spiders, Hymenoptera, Lepidopteran (caterpillars) adult and nymph Orthoptera, beetles, and true bugs. Less frequent prey identified in these studies included Neuroptera (lacewings, mantidflies, antlions), mites, pseudoscorpions, termites, Homoptera, adult Lepidoptera, and Odonata (dragonflies, damselflies) The Arizona study found that plants made up 5.5% of the diet, while the Durango study found only two cases of plant ingestion and interpret them as accidental intake. The most common, or highest percentage of prey items (e.g. Hymenoptera, caterpillars, etc.) in the diet were found to change annually in the Durango study.

&quot;Cophosaurus&quot; use a sit-and-wait foraging strategy, often situating themselves on a high vantage point such as a rock, bolder, or fallen limb, in a relatively open space and dashing out to take passing insects. They have been observed leaping into the air or at low-hanging vegetation to catch their prey. In one study, months with rain were significantly correlated with an increase of arthropods in the environment and in the dietary intake of the lizards. There was not a significant deference in the diet of males and females. Competition for food between adults and juveniles, as well as other species of sympatric lizards is at least partially alleviated by resource partitioning, determined by differences in body size and jaw length.

===Habitat===

The greater earless lizard native to the arid environment of the Chihuahua Desert, extending into western areas of the Tamaulipan mezquital, and the northeastern margins of the Meseta Central matorral, as well as the semi-arid Edwards Plateau and Central Great Plains in Texas, and the Arizona transition zone (between the Sonoran Desert and Arizona Mountains forests) in the west.

Within these ecoregions it typically occupies open scrubland and areas of sparse vegetation, with rocks and boulder. Limestone ledges and outcrops near streams with boulders and crevices, and dry gulches, arroyos, and canyons with alluvium deposits of silt, sand, gravel, and rocks are often preferred, but it is not strictly limited to these areas. Gentle to moderate slopes of limestone and gravel and hills of granite and igneous rock are also habitat for the lizard. Plants identified in association with greater earless lizards include honey mesquite (&quot;Prosopis glandulosa&quot;), creosote bush (&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot;), ocotillo (&quot;Fouquieria splendens&quot;), sotol (&quot;Dasylirion&quot;), lechuguilla (&quot;Agave lecheguilla&quot;), prickly pear cactus (&quot;Opuntia&quot;), leatherstem (&quot;Jatropha dioica&quot;), and candelilla (&quot;Euphorbia antisyphilitica&quot;).

The color of an individual lizard often bears a striking correlation to the prevailing colors of the rocks and substrates where it lives: &quot;e.g.&quot; specimens from Llano County, Texas have been noted for their rusty brown color similar to the red granite characteristic of much of the Llano Uplift. &quot;Cophosaurus&quot; can be locally abundant and among the most common species of herpetofauna in some areas, and yet absent from seemingly appropriate habitat other areas.

===Behavior===
Greater earless lizards are diurnal, with most populations exhibiting a bimodal daily activity pattern, peeking late in the morning, followed by a period of reduced activity in the afternoon heat, and a second activity period in the late afternoon. They have a high optimum temperature range, typical active body is . At night, &quot;Cophosaurus&quot; will often burrow in loose sand as deep as 15.3 cm. (6 in.) or in areas without sand, they may partially bury in loose gravel or shale, or sleep on the surface. Females have been found communally buried under shale on cold winter days.

They are predominantly ground-dwelling lizards that often seek a high perch, such as a protruding rock, to survey their area for passing prey and approaching predators. They are reluctant to retreat into crevices or borrows to evade predators, but instead will run from one rock to another with great speed, or rapidly dash a few yards only to make an abrupt stop and then freeze, at which point their remarkable camouflage seems to make them disappear. Cophosaurus are known to engage in bipedal locomotion (running on two feet) during short burst of speed.

Males, females, and even hatchlings only five minutes old exhibit territorial displays including head bobbing, pushups, lateral body compression. Another conspicuous behavior is the habit of lifting its tail and curling it over its back while running and waving the striking black and white banded tail in the air, diverting attention away from the head and body to the relatively expendable tail. The practice of curling the tail over the body while of running also serves a functional purpose as a counter-balance, shifting the center of gravity closer to the force exerted by the lizard&#x27;s rear legs. A 32% decrease in running speed was reported for lizards that had lost their tails.

<doc id="334390" wikidata="Q5326493" url="?curid=334390" title="Earless lizard">
<text>Earless lizards are two genera of small lizards native to the semiarid and grassland habitats of the Southwestern United States and Mexico. The genus &quot;Cophosaurus&quot; and the genus &quot;Holbrookia&quot; are both characterized by having no external ear openings, presumably to prevent sand from entering their bodies as they dig.

==Distinctive features==
Earless lizards typically vary from long. Males tend to be larger than females. The male has two heavy black strips ahead of its hind legs (pictured). The female differs in that she has a black stripe behind each thigh. A pink throat and flanks indicate pregnancy. Earless lizards have two throat folds, large eyes, and 27 or fewer femoral pores. They are also described as having shorter fore legs compared to their hind legs and also rather long toes. Although they are called earless lizards, they are still completely capable of hearing, but their ears do not have an external opening. This feature is useful when they burrow underground without getting soil in their ears.

==Behavior==
Earless lizards are most active during daylight; they hibernate during the winter and fall. When approached by a predator, their defense mechanism is raising and wagging their tails. To claim their territory, a combination of lateral body compression, head bobbing, and push-ups is done. Earless lizards are capable of homeostasis to a certain extent. As a feedback to temperature change, they acquire heat by conduction, convection, and radiation. In cooler temperatures, they raise their body temperature by turning their bodies broadside to the sun to absorb heat (infrared radiation). They can also align their bodies to the sun to reduced absorption to reduce body temperature. In warmer temperatures, they decreases their body temperature by conduction, such as climbing a tree to avoid elevated temperature from the ground.

==Diet==
The diet of earless lizards consists of arthropods, such as butterflies, moths, beetles, grasshoppers, insects, and spiders.

==Defense mechanism==
The earless lizard has a peculiar defense mechanism coupled to its cold-blooded metabolism. It has a small opening on the top of its head called a &quot;blood sinus&quot;, which helps it gain heat quickly during the daytime. However, the blood can also be channeled to the eyes of the lizard when a predator approaches, efficiently spraying the blood onto the predator, giving it enough time to escape.

==Reproduction==

Mating takes place in spring. Earless lizards lay their eggs between March and August, and about fifty days are needed for them to hatch. They tend to lay one to three clutches of eggs. Clutch sizes range from one to 10 eggs. When hatched, the hatchlings are about 2 in (5 cm) long.

==Threats==

No major existential threat has been identified in the US or Mexico, but habitat loss and degradation would result in a decline of this species.

==Geographic range==
Earless lizards are found from the Southwestern and Central United States, in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and as far north as Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming. They are also found in Mexico, in the states of Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Sinaloa, Durango, Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, and Veracruz.

<text>Phrynosoma, whose members are known as the horned lizards, horny toads, or horntoads, is a genus of North American lizards and the type genus of the family Phrynosomatidae. Their common names refer directly to their horns or to their flattened, rounded bodies, and blunt snouts.

The generic name &quot;Phrynosoma&quot; means &quot;toad-bodied&quot;. In common with true toads (amphibians of the family Bufonidae), horned lizards tend to move sluggishly, often remain motionless, and rely on their remarkable camouflage to avoid detection by predators. They are adapted to arid or semiarid areas. The spines on the lizard&#x27;s back and sides are modified reptile scales, which prevent water loss through the skin, whereas the horns on the head are true horns (i.e., they have a bony core). A urinary bladder is absent. Of the 21 species of horned lizards, 15 are native to the USA. The largest-bodied and most widely distributed of the American species is the Texas horned lizard.

==Defenses==

Horned lizards use a variety of means to avoid predation. Their coloration generally serves as camouflage. When threatened, their first defense is to remain motionless to avoid detection. If approached too closely, they generally run in short bursts and stop abruptly to confuse the predator&#x27;s visual acuity. If this fails, they puff up their bodies to cause them to appear more horned and larger so that they are more difficult to swallow.

At least eight species (&quot;P. asio&quot;, &quot;P. cornutum&quot;, &quot;P. coronatum&quot;, &quot;P. ditmarsi&quot;, &quot;P. hernandesi&quot;, &quot;P. orbiculare&quot;, &quot;P. solare&quot;, and &quot;P. taurus&quot;) are also able to squirt an aimed stream of blood from the corners of the eyes for a distance up to . They do this by restricting the blood flow leaving the head, thereby increasing blood pressure and rupturing tiny vessels around the eyelids. The blood not only confuses predators but also tastes foul to canine and feline predators. It appears to have no effect against predatory birds. Only three closely related species (&quot;P. mcallii&quot;, &quot;P. modestum&quot;, and &quot;P. platyrhinos&quot;) are certainly known to either be unable to squirt blood or only do it extremely rarely.

While previous thought held that compounds were added to the blood from glands in the ocular sinus cavity, current research has shown that the chemical compounds that make up the defense are already in the circulating blood. It is possible that their diet of large quantities of venomous harvester ants could be a factor; however, the origin and structure of the chemicals responsible are still unknown. The blood-squirting mechanism increases survival after contact with canine predators; the trait may provide an evolutionary advantage. Ocular autohemorrhaging has also been documented in other lizards, which suggests blood-squirting could have evolved from a less extreme defense in the ancestral branch of the genus. Recent phylogenic research supports this claim, so the species incapable of squirting blood apparently have lost the adaptation for reasons yet unstudied.

To avoid being picked up by the head or neck, a horned lizard ducks or elevates its head and orients its cranial horns straight up, or back. If a predator tries to take it by the body, the lizard drives that side of its body down into the ground so the predator cannot easily get its lower jaw underneath.

==Population decline==

A University of Texas publication notes that horned lizard populations continue to disappear throughout their distribution despite protective legislation. Population declines are attributed to a number of factors, including the fragmentation and loss of habitat from real estate development and road construction, the planting of non-native grasses (both suburban and rural), conversion of native land to pastureland and agricultural uses, and pesticides. Additionally predation by domestic dogs and cats place continued pressure upon horned lizards.

Fire ants (&quot;Solenopsis invicta&quot;), introduced from South America via the nursery industry&#x27;s potted plants, pose a significant threat to all wildlife including horned lizards. &quot;Phrynosoma&quot; species do not eat fire ants. Fire ants kill many species of wildlife, and are fierce competitors against the native ants, which horned lizards require for food (with their specialized nutritional content). Fire ants have given all ants a bad reputation, and human attempts to eradicate ants, including invasive species and the native species on which the lizards prey, contribute to the continued displacement of native ant species and the decline of horned lizards.

The Texas horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma cornutum&quot;) has disappeared from almost half of its geographic range. Their popularity in the early to mid-20th-century pet trade, where collectors took thousands from the wild populations to sell to pet distributors, without provision for their highly specialized nutritional needs (primarily formic acid from harvester ants), resulted in certain death for almost all the collected lizards. In 1967, the state of Texas passed protective legislation preventing the collection, exportation, and sale of &quot;Phrynosoma&quot;, and by the early 1970s, most states enacted similar laws to protect and conserve horned lizards in the USA. As recently as the early 2000s, though, the state of Nevada still allowed commercial sale of &quot;Phrynosoma&quot; species. Despite limited federal protection in Mexico, horned lizards are still offered in Mexican &quot;pet&quot; markets throughout the country.

In 2014, the Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson petitioned the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation to have the Texas horned lizard put on the endangered species list due to the massive decline of its population in Oklahoma, where it was once plentiful. The center said it may later seek protection for the animal on a federal level; it also said that reptiles in general are dying off at up to 10,000 times their historic extinction rate, greatly due to human influences.

==Species and subspecies==

The following 21 species (listed alphabetically by scientific name) are recognized as being valid by the Reptile Database, three species of which have recognized subspecies:

==Symbol==
Texas designated the Texas horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma cornutum&quot;) as the official state reptile in 1993. Wyoming’s state reptile is the “Horn Toad”, the greater short-horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma hernandesi&quot;).

The &quot;TCU Horned Frog&quot; is the mascot of Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas. The &quot;Horned Toad&quot; is also the mascot for Coalinga High School in Coalinga, California. This school is located in Western Central California and its arid region is home to the San Diego Horned Lizard, which is protected. The City of Coalinga hosts an annual &quot;Horned Toad Derby&quot; on Memorial day weekend which features horned toad races, a carnival and parade.

<text>Wimbledon Championships is an annual British tennis tournament created in 1877 and played on outdoor grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (AELTC) in the Wimbledon suburb of London, United Kingdom. The Gentlemen&#x27;s Singles was the first event contested in 1877.

==History==
The Wimbledon Championships are played in the first two weeks of July (as of July 2017; prior to this, they were played in the last week of June and first week of July) and have chronologically been the third of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the tennis season since 1987. The event was not held from 1915 to 1918 because of World War I and again from 1940 to 1945 because of World War II. It was also cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Gentlemen&#x27;s Singles&#x27; rules have undergone several changes since the first edition. From 1878 until 1921, the event started with a knockout phase, the All Comers&#x27; Singles, whose winner then faced the defending champion in a challenge round. The All Comers&#x27; winner was automatically awarded the title six times (1879, 1887, 1891, 1895, 1907, 1908) in the absence of the previous year&#x27;s champion. The challenge round system was abolished with the 1922 edition. Since the first championships, all matches have been played at the best-of-five sets. Between 1877 and 1883, the winner of the next game at five games all took the set in every match except the All Comers&#x27; final, and the challenge round, which were won with six games and a two games advantage. All sets were decided in this advantage format from 1884 to 1970. The best-of-12-points lingering death tie-break was introduced in 1971 for the first four sets, played at eight games all until 1978 and at six games all since 1979.

Since 1949, the Gentlemen&#x27;s Singles champion has received a miniature replica of the event&#x27;s trophy, a silver-gilt cup created in 1887 with the engraved inscription: &quot;The All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Champion of the World&quot;. New singles champions are traditionally elected honorary members of the AELTC by the club&#x27;s committee. In 2017, the Gentlemen&#x27;s Singles winner received prize money of £2,220,000.

In the Amateur Era, William Renshaw (1881–1886, 1889) holds the record for the most titles in the Gentlemen&#x27;s Singles, winning Wimbledon seven times. Renshaw&#x27;s wins, however, came within the challenge round format, and he won the event only twice after going through a complete draw. Renshaw also holds the record for most consecutive titles with six (from 1881 to 1886). The record for most consecutive and most wins post challenge round during the Amateur Era is Fred Perry with three (1934–1936).

In the Open Era, since the inclusion of professional tennis players in 1968, Roger Federer (2003–2007, 2009, 2012, 2017) holds the record for the most Gentlemen&#x27;s Singles titles with eight. Björn Borg (1976–1980) and Roger Federer (2003–2007) share the record for most consecutive victories with five.

Federer reached 7 consecutive Wimbledon Finals (2003 – 09), an all-time record, surpassing the old record of 6 consecutive finals by Borg (1976–81) and in the process the Swede won 41 consecutive matches at Wimbledon.

This event was won without losing a single set in the entire tournament during the Open Era twice, in 1976 by Björn Borg and in 2017 by Roger Federer.

Roger Federer is the only player in history, in both the Amateur and Open Eras, to reach the Wimbledon Gentlemen&#x27;s Singles Final twelve times.

From 1993 to 2000, Pete Sampras reached the Wimbledon final 7 times out of 8 years, winning all 7 finals in which he competed. During that period, the only time he did not reach the final was in 1996, where he lost at the quarter final stage to eventual champion Richard Krajicek.

<text>Wimbledon Championships, is an annual tennis tournament first contested in 1877 and played on outdoor grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (AELTC) in the Wimbledon suburb of London, United Kingdom. The ladies&#x27; singles was started in 1884.

==History==
Wimbledon has historically been played in the last week of June and the first week of July (though changed to the first two weeks of July in 2017), and has been chronologically the third of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the tennis season since 1987. The event was not held from 1915 to 1918 because of World War I and again from 1940 to 1945 because of World War II. The tournament was also not contested in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ladies&#x27; singles&#x27; rules have undergone several changes since the first edition. From 1886 until 1921, the event started with a knockout phase, the all comers&#x27; singles, whose winner then faced the defending champion in a challenge round. The all comers&#x27; winner was automatically awarded the title eleven times (1889, 1890, 1891, 1894, 1895, 1898, 1903, 1908, 1909, 1912, 1913) in the absence of the previous year&#x27;s champion. The challenge round system was abolished with the 1922 edition. Since the first championships, all matches have been played at the best-of-three sets. Between 1877 and 1883, the winner of the next game at five games-all took the set in every match except the all comers&#x27; final, and the challenge round, which were won with six games and a two games advantage. All sets were decided in two-game advantage format from 1884 to 1970. The lingering death best-of-12 points tie-break was introduced in 1971 for the first two sets, played at eight games-all until 1978 and at six games-all since 1979.

The ladies&#x27; singles champion receives a sterling silver salver commonly known as the &quot;Venus Rosewater Dish&quot;, or simply the &quot;Rosewater Dish&quot;. The salver, which is 18.75 inches (about 48 cm) in diameter, is decorated with figures from mythology. New singles champions are traditionally elected honorary members of the AELTC by the club&#x27;s committee. In 2012, the ladies&#x27; singles winner received prize money of £1,150,000.

In the Amateur–challenge round era, Dorothea Lambert Chambers (1903–1904, 1906, 1910–1911, 1913–1914) holds the record for most titles, with seven. However, it&#x27;s noteworthy that three of Chambers&#x27; titles were won in the challenge round. Lottie Dod (1891–1893) and Suzanne Lenglen (1919–1921) hold the record for most consecutive wins in the ladies&#x27; singles with three victories each. The record for most wins and most consecutive wins post-challenge round in the Amateur Era, belongs to Helen Wills Moody (1927–1930, 1932–1933, 1935, 1938) with eight, including four straight victories (1927–1930).

In the Open Era, since the inclusion of the professional tennis players, Martina Navratilova (1978–1979, 1982–1987, 1990) holds the record for most victories with nine. Navratilova holds the record for most consecutive victories with six (1982–1987).

This event has been won without the loss of a set during the Open Era, by the following players: Billie Jean King in 1968, 1972, 1973 and 1975, Margaret Court in 1970, Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1971 and 1980, Chris Evert in 1974 and 1981, Martina Navratilova in 1979, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, and 1990, Steffi Graf in 1992 and 1996, Jana Novotná in 1998, Lindsay Davenport in 1999, Venus Williams in 2000, 2007 and 2008, Serena Williams in 2002, 2009, 2010, 2015 and 2016, Petra Kvitová in 2011 and 2014 and Marion Bartoli in 2013.

<text>Fringe-toed lizards are lizards of the genus Uma in the family Phrynosomatidae, native to deserts of North America. They are adapted for life in sandy deserts with fringe-like scales on their hind toes hence their common name.

==Descriptions==
Lizards of the genus &quot;Uma&quot; have a brown and tan coloration that helps them to blend in with the sand. The dorsal surface has a velvety texture with intricate markings. In addition, they also have prominent elongated scales which form a fringe on the sides of their hind toes. These fringes aid with traction and speed, and help the lizard avoid sinking into loose, sandy dunes.

Fringe-toed lizards also possess upper jaws which overlap the lower ones, preventing the intrusion of sand particles, and nostrils that can be closed at will. Flaps also close against the ear openings when moving through sand, and the upper and lower eyelids have interlocking scales that prevent sand from getting into the eyes.

==Geographic range==
Fringe-toed lizards range throughout southeast California and southwest Arizona, and extend into northwest Sonora and northeast Baja California.

==Habitat==
Lizards of the genus &quot;Uma&quot; are found in low desert areas having fine, loose sand.

==Diet==
Fringe-toed lizards primarily eat insects, including ants, beetles, grasshoppers, and caterpillars. Flower buds, stems, leaves and seeds of plants are also eaten.

==Behavior==
Lizards of the genus &quot;Uma&quot; bury themselves underground in the winter. They sleep in their burrows, and use their burrows for protection from predators and extreme temperatures.

==Species==
&quot;Uma rufopunctata&quot;, the previous name for the Yuman Desert fringe-toed lizard, was found in 2016 to represent a hybrid between &quot;U. notata&quot; and &quot;U. cowlesi&quot;. ||

<doc id="334399" wikidata="Q2535475" url="?curid=334399" title="Urosaurus">
<text>Urosaurus is a genus of lizards, commonly known as tree lizards or brush lizards, belonging to the New World family Phrynosomatidae. They are native to North America, specifically the arid and semiarid regions of the western United States and Mexico, spending most of their time on trees, shrubs, or boulders.

==Description==
Species in the genus &quot;Urosaurus&quot; can be distinguished from members of the genus &quot;Sceloporus&quot; by the presence of a gular (under neck) fold and granular lateral scales. They can be distinguished from members of the genus &quot;Uta&quot; by the presence of enlarged (sometimes only slightly) dorsal scales. Some species of &quot;Urosaurus (Urosaurus ornatus)&quot; appear to be polymorphic for throat color, but it does vary in different populations. In male lizards, these colors can range anywhere from orange, yellow, green, or turquoise, and in females the color can be either orange or yellow. Throat color in males is also appears to be associated with certain mating behaviors including aggression, boldness, submission, and cautiousness.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Urosaurus&quot; have been used as a model system in lizard life-history studies, and populations produce two or more clutches of eggs per year. Field studies have also shown a cost of reproduction in a natural New Mexico population of the species &quot;Urosaurus ornatus&quot;.

==Species==
In the genus &quot;Urosaurus&quot; there are eight species which are recognized as being valid.
&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other that &quot;Urosaurus&quot;.

<text>Side-blotched lizards are lizards of the genus Uta. They are some of the most abundant and commonly observed lizards in the deserts of western North America, known for cycling between three colorized breeding patterns and is best described in the common side-blotched lizard. They commonly grow to 6 inches including the tail, with the males normally being the larger sex. Males often have bright throat colors.

These lizards are prey for many desert species. Snakes, larger lizards, and birds all make formidable predators to side-blotched lizards. Larger lizard species, such as collared, leopard, and spiny lizards, and roadrunners are the main predators. In turn, the side-blotched lizards eat arthropods, such as insects, spiders, and occasionally scorpions.

As a result of their high predation rate, these lizards are very prolific breeders. From April to June, they breed, with the young emerging as early as late May. These inch-long young appear all through the summer, and into September.

The diploid chromosome number in most if not all species is 34, consisting of 12 macro- and 22 microchromosomes.

==Sex==
Side-blotched lizards are notable for having the highest number of distinct male and female morphs within a species: three male and two female. They show a diversity of behaviors associated with reproduction, which are often referred to as &quot;alternative reproductive tactics&quot;.

Orange-throated males are &quot;ultra-dominant, high testosterone&quot;, that establish large territories and control areas that contain multiple females. Yellow stripe-throated males (&quot;sneakers&quot;) do not defend a territory, but cluster on the fringes of orange-throated lizard territories, and mate with the females on those territories while the orange-throat is absent, as the territory to defend is large. Blue-throated males are less aggressive and guard only one female; they can fend off the yellow stripe-throated males, but cannot withstand attacks by orange-throated males.

Orange-throated females lay many small eggs and are very territorial. Yellow-throated females lay fewer, larger eggs, and are more tolerant of each other.

This is called the rock paper scissors effect, borrowed from the name of the playground game, because the outcome of the mating success shows that one morph of the lizard takes advantage over another but not over the third.

The orange and blue-throated males can sometimes be seen approaching a human &quot;intruder&quot;. One speculation is that he could be giving the female(s) a chance to escape, but whether he is defending the female has not been documented. Another speculation is that he is highly motivated to engage whenever he sees movement on his territory, which he may be interpreting as a possible intruding male, or another female.

==Systematics==
The systematics and phylogeny of the side-blotched lizards is very confusing, with many local forms and morphs having been described as full species. Following the 1997 review of Upton and Murphy, which included new data from mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and ATPase 6 sequences, the following species can be recognized pending further research:
* Enchanted side-blotched lizard, &quot;U. encantadae&quot;
* Dead side-blotched lizard, &quot;U. lowei&quot;
* Isla San Pedro Nolasco lizard, &quot;U. nolascensis&quot;
* San Pedro side-blotched lizard, &quot;U. palmeri&quot;
* Isla Santa Catalina side-blotched lizard, &quot;U. squamata&quot;
* Common side-blotched lizard, &quot;U. stansburiana&quot;
** Western side-blotched lizard, &quot;U. (stansburiana) elegans&quot;
** Nevada side-blotched lizard, &quot;U. (stansburiana) nevadensis&quot;
** Northern side-blotched lizard, &quot;U. (stansburiana) stansburiana&quot;
** Eastern side-blotched lizard, &quot;U. (stansburiana) stejnegeri&quot;
** Plateau side-blotched lizard, &quot;U. (stansburiana) uniformis&quot;
* Swollen-nosed side-blotched lizard, &quot;U. tumidarostra&quot;

<text>Anolis is a genus of anoles (), iguanian lizards in the family Dactyloidae, native to the Americas. With more than 425 species, it represents the world&#x27;s most species-rich amniote tetrapod genus, although many of these have been proposed to be moved to other genera, in which case only about 45 &quot;Anolis&quot; species remain. Previously, it was classified under the family Polychrotidae that contained all the anoles, as well as &quot;Polychrus&quot;, but recent studies place it in the Dactyloidae.

== Taxonomy ==
This very large genus displays considerable paraphyly, but phylogenetic analysis suggests a number of subgroups or clades. Whether these clades are best recognized as subgenera within &quot;Anolis&quot; or separate genera remains a matter of dispute.

If the clades are recognized as full genera, about 45 species remain in &quot;Anolis&quot;, with the remaining moved to &quot;Audantia&quot; (9 species), &quot;Chamaelinorops&quot; (7 species), &quot;Ctenonotus&quot; (more than 40 species), &quot;Dactyloa&quot; (&quot;circa&quot; 95 species), &quot;Deiroptyx&quot; (almost 35 species), &quot;Norops&quot; (about 190 species), and &quot;Xiphosurus&quot; (around 15 species). Some of these can be further subdivided. For example, &quot;Phenacosaurus&quot; was often listed as a full genus in the past, but it is a subclade within &quot;Dactyloa&quot; (&quot;Dactyloa heteroderma&quot; species group). Among the subgroups within &quot;Anolis&quot; are:

* &quot;carolinensis&quot; species group (13 species)
* &quot;isolepis&quot; species group (three species)

In 2011, the green (or Carolina) anole (&quot;Anolis carolinensis&quot;) became the first reptile to have its complete genome published.

Closely related, recently diverged anole lizards exhibited more divergence in thermal biology than in morphology. These anole lizards are thought to have the same structural niche and have similarities in their size and shape, but they inhabit different climatic niches with was variability in temperature and openness of the environment. This suggests that thermal physiology is more associated with recently diverged anole lizards.

==Ecomorphs==

&quot;Anolis&quot; lizards are some of the best examples of both adaptive radiation and convergent evolution. Populations of lizards on isolated islands diverge to occupy separate ecological niches, mostly in terms of the location within the vegetation where they forage (such as in the crown of trees vs. the trunk vs. underlying shrubs). These divergences in habitat are accompanied by morphological changes primarily related to moving on the substrate diameter they most frequently encounter, with twig ecomorphs having short limbs, while trunk ecomorphs have long limbs.

In addition, these patterns repeat on numerous islands, with animals in similar habitats converging on similar body forms repeatedly. This demonstrates adaptive radiation can actually be predictable based on habitat encountered, and experimental introductions onto formerly lizard-free islands have proven &quot;Anolis&quot; evolution can be predicted.

After appearing on each of the four Greater Antillean Islands about 50 million years ago, &quot;Anolis&quot; lizards spread on each island to occupy niches in the island&#x27;s trees. Some living in the tree canopy area, others low on the tree trunk near the ground; others in the mid-trunk area, others on twigs. Each new species developed its own distinct body type, called an ecomorph, adapted to the tree niche where it lived. Together, the different species occupied their various niches in the trees as a &quot;community&quot;. A study of lizard fossils trapped in amber shows that the lizard communities have existed for about 20 million years or more. Four modern ecomorph body types, trunk-crown, trunk-ground, trunk, and twig, are represented in the amber fossils study. Close comparison of the lizard fossils with their descendants alive today in the Caribbean shows the lizards have changed little in the millions of years.

== Behavior ==
As ectotherms, &quot;Anolis&quot; lizards must regulate their body temperature partly through behavioral changes and bask in the sunlight to gain enough heat to become fully active, but lizards cannot behaviorally warm themselves at night when temperatures drop. Because of this, cold tolerance evolves faster than heat tolerance in these lizards. On the island of Hispaniola, both high-altitude and low-altitude lizard populations exist, and the thermal conditions at high and low elevations differ significantly. High-altitude lizards have shifted their ecological niche to boulder environments, where warming themselves is easier, and they show changes in the shape of limbs and skull that make them better adapted to these environments.

To escape dangers, species that evolved near water have adapted the ability to stay submerged for as long as 18 minutes.

==Species==

The &quot;Anolis&quot; lizards that are less susceptible to predation are those with a dewlap in which both the scales and the exposed skin areas between them match the usual pale gray or whitish of the rest of the ventral surface.

==Dewlap==
The dewlap is a flap of skin found beneath the jaw or throat of &quot;Anolis&quot; lizards. It can present in a variety of colorations, and is most present in male anoles. The dewlap is extended by means of the hyoid muscles in the throat, and can be flashed in a &quot;pulse&quot; pattern where the flap is extended repeatedly, or a &quot;moving flag&quot; pattern, where the lizard flashes it continuously while bobbing up and down. The coloration of the dewlap is caused by two pigments, pterins and carotenoids. Pterin pigments are compounds synthesized from guanine, whereas carotenoids are pigments acquired from the diet. Both cause the red-yellow hues most commonly found in &quot;Anolis&quot; lizard dewlaps. The function of the dewlap in &quot;Anolis&quot; lizards has been a topic of debate for centuries. It is thought that the dewlap is flashed as a visual signal for other competing males, or as a courtship signal for single females. It has also been hypothesized that the dewlap serves as a signal for sex recognition.

===Initial studies===
The first study done on dewlap function was by Mertens (1926). The initial assumption was that the dewlap was flashed as a method of sexual selection, and that the males would use it in order to attract females. It is hypothesized that female &quot;Anolis&quot; lizards are more attracted to males who flash their dewlaps more often, or have more brightly colored dewlaps. This was then challenged by the hypothesis that males flashed their dewlap as a way to threaten other males in the area. During intermale fights, dewlaps are flashed. More currently, many studies have been done on the dewlap as a function for species recognition, with focus on the relationship of the contrast between dewlap color and environment.

===Relationship with environment===
The dewlap comes in a variety of colors, including yellow, blue, and red. It was previously believed that the color of the dewlap is what mattered most in interlizard interactions, but it has since been found that there exists a relationship between habitat light conditions and dewlap color. This means that, rather than the color being of importance, it is the contrast of the dewlap against the background of its environment that best visually signals to other lizards. There have been many methods used to determine this. Persons et. al (1999) found that the probability of a dewlap showing being detected goes up with the contrast of dewlap against the background. They determined this by measuring the amount of times a &quot;positive response&quot; of the lizard&#x27;s eyes turning towards a flashed dewlap occurred among different background contrasts. Similarly, Leal and Fleishman (2002) found that the light conditions in which a lizard displays its dewlap affects the probability of it being visually detected. They did this by measuring the UV spectral reflectance of dewlaps in &quot;Anolis cristatellus&quot; lizards using a spectroradiometer, then measuring the spectral sensitivity of the lizards’ retinal responses using electroretinographic (ERG) flicker photometry.

===Evolution===
&quot;Anolis&quot; lizards have emerged to be a good example of adaptive radiation. The difference in dewlap morphology among &quot;Anolis&quot; lizard populations demonstrates this phenomenon. &quot;Anolis&quot; lizards have the ability to adapt to different areas of the environment in a way where multiple species can coexist effectively. The amount of vegetation in an environment affects the amount of light absorbed. Studies have shown that lighting affects the dewlap’s function as a visual signal. The diversity in vegetation in &quot;Anolis&quot; lizards’ environments has caused a similar diversity in dewlap morphology, as different species of anoles adapt to the lighting conditions in their environment. The ability for a lizard to signal effectively also means it is able to defend its territory and attract mates more effectively, making it a good competitor.

The relationship between background contrast and visual signals also suggests that there exists a coevolution between the signals and sensory systems of &quot;Anolis&quot; lizards. The environmental diversity of Anolis habitats causes a diversity in the recognition of individuals. Sensory systems must be able to effectively pick up on dewlap signals, thus coevolving with the changes in dewlap characteristics.

One of the main limitations to these theories is that of gene flow. Population genetic theory says that gene flow can counteract evolutionary adaptations made and prevent signal divergence, due to an influx of abnormal alleles into the new population. This causes a genetic homogenization and challenges the idea that dewlap morphology in &quot;Anolis&quot; lizards and their sensory systems have coevolved.

<text>Microlophus is a genus of tropidurid lizards native to South America. Around 20 species are recognized and 10 of these are endemic to the Galápagos Islands, where they are commonly known as lava lizards (they are sometimes placed in &quot;Tropidurus&quot; instead). The remaining, which often are called Pacific iguanas, are found in the Andes and along the Pacific coasts of Chile, Peru, and Ecuador.

The distribution of the lava lizards and their variations in shape, colour, and behaviour show the phenomenon of adaptive radiation so typical of the inhabitants of this archipelago. One species occurs on all the central and western islands, which were perhaps connected during periods of lower sea levels, while one species each occurs on six other more peripheral islands. All have most likely evolved from a single ancestral species. However, as usual for the Tropiduridae, they can change their colour individually to some extent, and members of the same species occurring in different habitats also show colour differences. Thus, animals living mainly on dark lava are darker than ones that live in lighter, sandy environments.

<text>Plica is a genus of tropidurid lizards found in South America and the Caribbean. Species in the genus &quot;Plica&quot; are arboreal, medium-sized lizards.

==Taxonomy==
For a long time, the genus &quot;Plica&quot; was considered to include four species: two relatively widespread ones (&quot;P. plica&quot; and &quot;P. umbra&quot;) and two tepuis-associated species with narrow distributions (&quot;P. lumaria&quot; and &quot;P. pansticta&quot;). However, recent research has shown that &quot;P. plica&quot; is a cryptic species complex, and four new species were described in 2013. The species count will likely increase as there are still several undescribed species.

==Species==
The currently recognized species are the following:
* &quot;Plica lumaria&quot; 
* &quot;Plica pansticta&quot; 
* &quot;Plica plica&quot; – collared tree runner, tree runner
* &quot;Plica umbra&quot; – blue-lipped tree lizard, harlequin racerunner
Formerly included in &quot;Plica plica&quot;:
* &quot;Plica caribeana&quot; – Caribbean treerunner
* &quot;Plica kathleenae&quot; – Kathleen&#x27;s treerunner
* &quot;Plica medemi&quot; – Medem&#x27;s treerunner
* &quot;Plica rayi&quot; – Ray&#x27;s treerunner

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Plica&quot;.

<text>Tropidurus is a genus of reptiles. The genus includes many species of Neotropical ground lizards (family Tropiduridae). &quot;Tropidurus&quot; is the type genus of the family Tropiduridae.

==Geographic range and habitat==
Species in the genus &quot;Tropidurus&quot; are found on the South American mainland, especially in the Amazon Rainforest, but also in more arid regions.

==Common name==
No common name is widely used solely for species of the genus &quot;Tropidurus&quot;. In their native range, they are simply called &quot;lagartixa&quot;, as are most similar animals. If anything, the Brazilian term &quot;calango&quot; is used to particularly refer to lizards of the genus &quot;Tropidurus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Tropidurus&quot; contains 30 described species, but new ones continue to be discovered. An additional seven species—the Galápagos lava lizards endemic to the Galápagos Islands—are sometimes placed here, too, but more commonly separated in the genus &quot;Microlophus&quot;, instead. Similarly, the green thornytail iguana and tropical thorny iguana are now often separated into the minor, but probably distinct &quot;Uracentron&quot; lineage, instead. In this article, these two genera are kept separate, while &quot;Platynotus&quot;, &quot;Strobilurus&quot;, and &quot;Tapinurus&quot; are included in &quot;Tropidurus&quot;.

==Description==
Males and females of all &quot;Tropidurus&quot; species are marked differently. The male is usually much larger than the female, and his body is more brightly coloured and distinctly patterned. The typical size of &quot;Tropidurus&quot; lizards varies greatly from habitat to habitat as does the pattern of body markings, even among individuals of the same species. Like many lizards, they show changes of colour with mood and temperature.

==Species==

These species are recognized as being valid:

*&quot;Tropidurus azurduyae&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus bogerti&quot; – keeled lava lizard
*&quot;Tropidurus callathelys&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus catalanensis&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus chromatops&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus cocorobensis&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus erythrocephalus&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus etheridgei&quot; – Etheridge&#x27;s lava lizard
*&quot;Tropidurus guarani&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus helenae&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus hispidus&quot; – Peters&#x27;s lava lizard, neotropical lava lizard
*&quot;Tropidurus hygomi&quot; – Reinhardt&#x27;s lava lizard
*&quot;Tropidurus imbituba&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus insulanus&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus itambere&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus jaguaribanus&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus lagunablanca&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus melanopleurus&quot; – black lava lizard
*&quot;Tropidurus montanus&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus mucujensis&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus oreadicus&quot; 

*&quot;Tropidurus pinima&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus psammonastes&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus semitaeniatus&quot; – striped lava lizard
*&quot;Tropidurus sertanejo&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidurus spinulosus&quot; – spiny lava lizard
*&quot;Tropidurus torquatus&quot; – Amazon lava lizard
*&quot;Tropidurus xanthochilus&quot;

<text>Monitor lizards are lizards in the genus &quot;Varanus,&quot; the only extant genus in the family Varanidae. They are native to Africa, Asia, and Oceania, and one species is also found in the Americas as an invasive species. About 80 species are recognized.

Monitor lizards have long necks, powerful tails and claws, and well-developed limbs. The adult length of extant species ranges from in some species such as &quot;Varanus sparnus&quot;, to over in the case of the Komodo dragon, though the extinct megalania (&quot;Varanus priscus&quot;) may have reached lengths of more than . Most monitor species are terrestrial, but many are also arboreal or semiaquatic. While most monitor lizards are carnivorous, eating smaller reptiles, fish, birds, insects, small mammals, and eggs, a few species also eat fruit and vegetation.

==Etymology==
The generic name &quot;Varanus&quot; is derived from the Arabic word &quot;waral&quot; [Standard Arabic] / &quot;warar&quot; [colloquially] / &quot;waran&quot; [colloquially], from a common Semitic root &quot;ouran&quot;, &quot;waran&quot;, &quot;warar&quot; or &quot; waral&quot;, meaning &quot;lizard beast&quot;.

In English, they are known as &quot;monitors&quot; or &quot;monitor lizards&quot;. The earlier term &quot;monitory lizard&quot; became rare by about 1920. The name may have been suggested by the occasional habit of varanids to stand on their two hind legs and to appear to &quot;monitor&quot;, or perhaps from their supposed habit of &quot;warning people of the approach of venomous animals&quot;. But all of these explanations for the name &quot;monitor&quot; postdate Linnaeus giving the scientific name &quot;Lacerta monitor&quot; to the Nile monitor in 1758, which may have been based on a mistaken idea by Linnaeus that the German word &quot;Waran&quot; (borrowed from Arabic) was connected to &quot;warnen&quot; (to warn), leading him to incorrectly Latinize it as &quot;monitor&quot; (&#x27;warner&#x27;, &#x27;adviser&#x27;).

Austronesian languages spoken across Southeast Asia, where varanids are common, have a large number of slightly related local names for them. They are usually known as &quot;biawak&quot; (Malay, including Indonesian standard variety), &quot;bayawak&quot; (Filipino), &quot;binjawak&quot; or &quot;minjawak or nyambik&quot; (Javanese), or variations thereof. Other names include &quot;hokai&quot; (Solomon Islands); &quot;bwo&quot;, &quot;puo&quot;, or &quot;soa&quot; (Maluku); &quot;halo&quot; (Cebu); &quot;galuf&quot; or &quot;kaluf&quot; (Micronesia and the Caroline Islands); &quot;batua&quot; or &quot;butaan&quot; (Luzon); &quot;alu&quot; (Bali); &quot;hora&quot; or &quot;ghora&quot; (Komodo group of islands); &quot;phut&quot; (Burmese); and &quot;guibang&quot; (Manobo).

In South Asia, they are known as in Meitei, mwpou in Boro, घोरपड in Marathi, உடும்பு in Tamil and &quot;udumbu&quot; ഉടുമ്പ് in Malayalam, in Bhojpuri, &quot;gohi&quot; (गोहि) in Maithili, in Sinhala as තලගොයා / කබරගොයා (), in Telugu as &quot;uḍumu&quot; (ఉడుము), in Kannada as (ಉಡ), in Punjabi and Magahi as गोह (&quot;goh&quot;), in Assamese as &quot;gui xaap&quot;, in Odia as ଗୋଧି (&quot;godhi&quot;), and in Bengali as গোসাপ () or গুইসাপ (), and गोह (&quot;goh&quot;) in Hindi and गोधा (&quot;godhā&quot;) in Sanskrit.

The West African Nile monitor is known by several names in Yoruba, including , , and . In Wolof it is known as &quot;mbossé&quot; or &quot;bar&quot;, and is the traditional totem of the city of Kaolack.

Due to confusion with the large New World lizards of the family Iguanidae, the lizards became known as &quot;goannas&quot; in Australia. Similarly, in South African English, they are referred to as &quot;leguaans&quot;, or &quot;likkewaans&quot;, from the Dutch term for the Iguanidae, &quot;leguanen&quot;.

==Distribution==
The various species cover a vast area, occurring through Africa, the Indian subcontinent, to China, the Ryukyu Islands in southern Japan, south to Southeast Asia to Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, Australia, and islands of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. They have also been introduced outside of their natural range, for instance, the West African Nile monitor is now found in South Florida. Monitor lizards also occurred widely in Europe in the Neogene, with the last known remains in the region dating to the Middle Pleistocene.

==Habits and diet==
Most monitor lizards are almost entirely carnivorous, consuming prey as varied as insects, crustaceans, arachnids, myriapods, molluscs, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Most species feed on invertebrates as juveniles and shift to feeding on vertebrates as adults. Deer make up about 50% of the diet of adult Komodo dragons, the largest monitor species. In contrast, three arboreal species from the Philippines, &quot;Varanus bitatawa&quot;, &quot;mabitang&quot;, and &quot;olivaceus&quot;, are primarily fruit eaters.

==Biology==
Monitor lizards are considered unique among animals in that its members are relatively morphologically conservative, yet show a very large size range. However, finer morphological features such as the shape of the skull and limbs do vary, and are strongly related to the ecology of each species.

Monitor lizards maintain large territories and employ active-pursuit hunting techniques that are reminiscent of similar-sized mammals. The active nature of monitor lizards has led to numerous studies on the metabolic capacities of these lizards. The general consensus is that monitor lizards have the highest standard metabolic rates of all extant reptiles.

Like snakes, monitor lizards have highly forked tongues that act as part of the &quot;smell&quot; sense, where the tips of the tongue carry molecules from the environment to sensory organs in the skull. The forked apparatus allows for these lizards to sense boundaries in the molecules they collect, almost smelling in &quot;stereo&quot;. 

Monitor lizards have a high aerobic scope that is afforded, in part, by their heart anatomy. Whereas most reptiles are considered to have three-chambered hearts, the hearts of monitor lizards – as with those of boas and pythons – have a well developed ventricular septum that completely separates the pulmonary and systemic sides of the circulatory system during systole. This allows monitor lizards to create mammalian-equivalent pressure differentials between the pulmonary and systemic circuits, which in turn ensure that oxygenated blood is quickly distributed to the body without also flooding the lungs with high-pressure blood.

Monitor lizards are oviparous, laying from seven to 38 eggs, which they often cover with soil or protect in a hollow tree stump. Some species, including the Komodo dragon, are capable of parthenogenesis.

===Venom===
Anatomical and molecular studies indicate that most if not all varanids are venomous. Unlike snakes, monitor lizard venom glands are situated in their lower jaw. The venom of monitor lizards is diverse and complex, as a result of the diverse ecological niches monitor lizards occupy. 

For example, many species have anticoagulant venom, disrupting clotting through a combination of fibrinogenolysis and blocking platelet aggregation. Amongst them, arboreal species, such as the tree monitors and the banded monitor, have by far the strongest fibrinogenolytic venom. As a result, wounds from monitor lizard bites often bleed more than they would if they were simply lacerations. Venom may also cause hypotension. 

In some species such as the Komodo dragon and the desert monitor, venom also induces a powerful neurotoxic effect. In the latter species for instance, envenomation causes immediate paralysis in rodents (but not birds) and lesser effects of the same nature in humans.

==Intelligence==
At least some species of monitors are known to be able to count; studies feeding rock monitors varying numbers of snails showed that they can distinguish numbers up to six. Nile monitors have been observed to cooperate when foraging; one animal lures the female crocodile away from her nest, while the other opens the nest to feed on the eggs. The decoy then returns to also feed on the eggs. Komodo dragons at the National Zoo in Washington, DC, recognize their keepers and seem to have distinct personalities. Blue and green tree monitors in British zoos have been observed shredding leaves, apparently as a form of play.

== Human Uses ==

===As pets===

Monitor lizards have become a staple in the reptile pet trade. The most commonly kept monitors are the savannah monitor and Ackie dwarf monitor, due to their relatively small size, low cost, and relatively calm dispositions with regular handling. Among others, black-throated, Timor, Asian water, Nile, mangrove, emerald tree, black tree, roughneck, Dumeril&#x27;s, peach-throated, crocodile, and Argus monitors have been kept in captivity.

=== Traditional medicines ===
Monitor lizards are poached in some South- and Southeast Asian countries, as their organs and fat are used in some traditional medicines, although there is no scientific evidence as to their effectiveness.

Monitor lizard meat, particularly the tongue and liver, is eaten in parts of India and Malaysia and is supposed to be an aphrodisiac.

In parts of Pakistan and southern India, as well in Northeastern India, particularly Assam, the different parts of monitor lizards are traditionally used for treating rheumatic pain, skin infections and hemorrhoids, and the oil is used as an aphrodisiac lubricant (&quot;sande ka tel&quot;).

Consuming raw blood and flesh of monitor lizards has been reported to cause eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, as some monitors are hosts for the parasitic nematode &quot;Angiostrongylus cantonensis&quot;.

=== Leather ===
&quot;Large-scale exploitation&quot; of monitor lizards is undertaken for their skins, which are described as being &quot;of considerable utility&quot; in the leather industry. In Papua New Guinea, monitor lizard leather is used for membranes in traditional drums (called &quot;kundu&quot;), and these lizards are referred to as &quot;kundu palai&quot; or &quot;drum lizard&quot; in Tok Pisin, the main Papuan trade language. Monitor lizard skins are prized in making the resonant part of serjas (Bodo folk sarangis) and dotaras (native strummed string instruments of Assam, Bengal and other eastern states). The leather is also used in making a Carnatic music percussion instrument called the &quot;kanjira&quot;.

=== Food ===
The meat of monitor lizards is eaten by some tribes in India, Nepal, the Philippines, Australia, South Africa and West Africa as a supplemental meat source. Both meat and eggs are also eaten in Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam and Thailand as a delicacy.

==Conservation==
According to IUCN Red List of threatened species, most of the monitor lizards species fall in the categories of least concern, but the population is decreasing globally. All but five species of monitor lizards are classified by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora under Appendix II, which is loosely defined as species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction but may become so unless trade in such species is subject to strict regulation to avoid use incompatible with the survival of the species in the wild. The remaining five species – the Bengal, yellow, desert, and clouded monitors and the Komodo Dragon– are classified under CITES Appendix I, which outlaws international commercial trade in the species.

The yellow monitor is protected in all countries in its range except Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

In Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana and all other parts of South India, catching or killing of monitor lizards is banned under the Protected Species Act.

==Evolution==
&quot;Varanus&quot; is the only living genus of the family Varanidae. Varanids last shared a common ancestor with their closest living relatives, earless &quot;monitors&quot;, during the Late Cretaceous. The oldest known varanids are from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia. During the Eocene, the varanid &quot;Saniwa&quot; occurred in North America. The closest known relative of &quot;Varanus&quot; is &quot;Archaeovaranus&quot; from the Eocene of China, suggesting that the genus &quot;Varanus&quot; is of Asian origin. The oldest fossils of &quot;Varanus&quot; date to the early Miocene.

Many of the species within the various subgenera also form species complexes with each other:

<text>The green pheasant (Phasianus versicolor), also known as the Japanese green pheasant, is an omnivorous bird native to the Japanese archipelago, to which it is endemic. Some taxonomic authorities consider it a subspecies of the common pheasant, &quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;. It is the national bird of Japan.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Some sources claim that the green pheasant is a subspecies of the common pheasant, though others claim that they are separate, though closely related, species. The green pheasant has three subspecies. The nominate subspecies, &quot;P. v. versicolor&quot;, is called the southern green pheasant or kiji. The Pacific green pheasant, &quot;P. v. tamensis&quot;, and northern green pheasant, &quot;P. v. robustipes&quot;, are the other two subspecies. There are some cases of hybrids between the green pheasant and the copper pheasant or common pheasant.

==Description==
The male (cock) southern green pheasant, &quot;P. v. versicolor&quot;, has dark green plumage on the breast, neck, mantle, and flanks. The male also has a bluish-purplish hood with clear ear tufts, red wattles, and a long, pale grey-banded tail. The female (hen) is smaller than the male, with a shorter tail, and has brownish-black colored plumage, with dark brown feathers fringed pale brown. The males of this subspecies have the darkest plumage, which is mainly green. The male Pacific green pheasant, &quot;P. v. tamensis&quot;, has lighter plumage than the nominate subspecies. Its feathers are more purple and blue. The male northern green pheasant, &quot;P. v. robustipes&quot;, has the lightest plumage and its crown and mantle are more bronze than those of the other subspecies. The females of all three subspecies look much more similar, though, like with the males, the females of &quot;P. v. versicolor&quot; normally have the darkest plumage and the females of &quot;P. v. robustipes&quot; have the lightest. 

==Behavior==
===Diet===
In the wild, green pheasants eat small animals, such as worms and insects, grains and plants. They are, in captivity, sometimes fed pellets, seeds, plants and live food.
===Breeding===
The green pheasants&#x27; breeding season starts during March or April and ends in June. Green pheasants can first breed when they are about one year old. One clutch has between six and fifteen eggs. The eggs are incubated for 23 to 25 days.
==In culture==
In Japan, many people claim that green pheasants are scared by earthquakes and &#x27;scream&#x27;. They are the national bird of Japan because the way the female walks together with its chicks is seen as a symbol of harmony. It was featured on the Japanese 10,000 yen note.

==Habitat and distribution==
It is found throughout Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu as well as some smaller islands; it has also been introduced in Hawaii and (unsuccessfully) in North America as a gamebird. It inhabits woodlands and forest edges, brush, grassland, and parkland.

This species is common and widespread throughout its native range. It often frequents farmlands and human settlements. The introduced populations in Hawaii are stable. Populations in Western Europe have perhaps bred with the common pheasant for a number of years and no pure green pheasants exist there any longer. This species has been crossed with the common pheasant on some game farms in North America and released.

In its native range, the green pheasant outcompetes introduced populations of common pheasant; despite the two species close relation, they have differing ecological requirements, and the common pheasant is less adapted to the ecology of the green pheasant&#x27;s range.

==Conservation==
Though the green pheasant population is decreasing, it is not severely fragmented. On a local and national level, green pheasants are used for food, sport hunting, specimen collecting and as pets or display animals. None of these practices are found on an international level. The green pheasant is one of the 29 designated &#x27;game species&#x27; in Japan. These are the only species that can legally be hunted. A hunting license is required.

<doc id="334418" wikidata="Q422251" url="?curid=334418" title="Return-to-zero">
<text>Return-to-zero (RZ or RTZ) describes a line code used in telecommunications signals in which the signal drops (returns) to zero between pulses. This takes place even if a number of consecutive 0s or 1s occur in the signal. The signal is self-clocking. This means that a separate clock does not need to be sent alongside the signal, but suffers from using twice the bandwidth to achieve the same data-rate as compared to non-return-to-zero format.

The &quot;zero&quot; between each bit is a neutral or rest condition, such as a zero amplitude in pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM), zero phase shift in phase-shift keying (PSK), or mid-frequency in frequency-shift keying (FSK).
That &quot;zero&quot; condition is typically halfway between the significant condition representing a 1 bit and the other significant condition representing a 0 bit.

Although return-to-zero (RZ) contains a provision for synchronization, it still has a DC component resulting in “baseline wander” during long strings of 0 or 1 bits, just like the line code non-return-to-zero.

==Return-to-zero in optical communication==
===Return to zero, inverted===
Return-to-zero, inverted (RZI) is a method of mapping for transmission. The two-level RZI signal has a pulse (shorter than a clock cycle) if the binary signal is 0, and no pulse if the binary signal is 1. It is used (with a pulse 3/16 of a bit long) by the IrDA serial infrared (SIR) physical layer specification. Required bandwidth for this kind of modulation is: BW = R(data rate).

==Bipolar return-to-zero (bipolar RZ)==
For bipolar return-to-zero (bipolar RZ), a binary one is encoded as +V volts, a binary zero is encoded as −V volts, and 0 volt is used to provide padding and separation between bits.

Bipolar return-to-zero encoding is used by the ARINC 429 bus.

<text>A telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) is a teleprinter, an electronic device for text communication over a telephone line, that is designed for use by persons with hearing or speech difficulties. Other names for the device include [[teletypewriter]] (TTY), textphone (common in Europe), and minicom (United Kingdom).

The typical TDD is a device about the size of a typewriter or laptop computer with a QWERTY keyboard and small screen that uses an LED, LCD, or VFD screen to display typed text electronically. In addition, TDDs commonly have a small spool of paper on which text is also printedold versions of the device had only a printer and no screen. The text is transmitted live, via a telephone line, to a compatible device, i.e. one that uses a similar communication protocol.

Special telephone services have been developed to carry the TDD functionality even further. In certain countries, there are systems in place so that a deaf person can communicate with a hearing person on an ordinary voice phone using a human relay operator. There are also &quot;carry-over&quot; services, enabling people who can hear but cannot speak (&quot;hearing carry-over,&quot; a.k.a. &quot;HCO&quot;), or people who cannot hear but are able to speak (&quot;voice carry-over,&quot; a.k.a. &quot;VCO&quot;) to use the telephone.

The term TDD is sometimes discouraged because people who are deaf are increasingly using mainstream devices and technologies to carry out most of their communication. The devices described here were developed for use on the partially-analog Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). They do not work well on the new internet protocol (IP) networks. Thus as society increasingly moves toward IP based telecommunication, the telecommunication devices used by people who are deaf will not be TDDs. In the US and Canada, the devices are referred to as TTYs.

Teletype Corporation, of Skokie, Illinois, made page printers for text, notably for news wire services and telegrams, but these used standards different from those for deaf communication, and although in quite widespread use, were technically incompatible. Furthermore, these were sometimes referred to by the &quot;TTY&quot; initialism, short for &quot;Teletype&quot;. When computers had keyboard input mechanisms and page printer output, before CRT terminals came into use, Teletypes were the most widely used devices. They were called &quot;console typewriters&quot;. (Telex used similar equipment, but was a separate international communication network.)

== History ==

=== APCOM acoustic coupler or MODEM device ===
The TDD concept was developed by James C. Marsters (1924–2009), a dentist and private airplane pilot who became deaf as an infant because of scarlet fever, and Robert Weitbrecht, a deaf physicist. In 1964, Marsters, Weitbrecht and Andrew Saks, an electrical engineer and grandson of the founder of the Saks Fifth Avenue department store chain, founded APCOM (Applied Communications Corp.), located in the San Francisco Bay area, to develop the acoustic coupler, or modem; their first product was named the PhoneType. APCOM collected old teleprinter machines (TTYs) from the Department of Defense and junkyards. Acoustic couplers were cabled to TTYs enabling the AT&amp;T standard Model 500 telephone to couple, or fit, into the rubber cups on the coupler, thus allowing the device to transmit and receive a unique sequence of tones generated by the different corresponding TTY keys. The entire configuration of teleprinter machine, acoustic coupler, and telephone set became known as the TTY. Weitbrecht invented the acoustic coupler modem in 1964. The actual mechanism for TTY communications was accomplished electro-mechanically through frequency-shift keying (FSK) allowing only half-duplex communication, where only one person at a time can transmit.

=== Paul Taylor TTY device ===
During the late 1960s, Paul Taylor combined Western Union Teletype machines with modems to create teletypewriters, known as TTYs. He distributed these early, non-portable devices to the homes of many in the deaf community in St. Louis, Missouri. He worked with others to establish a local telephone wake-up service. In the early 1970s, these small successes in St. Louis evolved into the nation&#x27;s first local telephone relay system for the deaf.

=== Micon Industries MCM device ===
In 1973, the Manual Communications Module (MCM), which was the world&#x27;s first electronic portable TTY allowing two-way telecommunications, premiered at the California Association of the Deaf convention in Sacramento, California. The battery-powered MCM was invented and designed by a deaf news anchor and interpreter, Kit Patrick Corson, in conjunction with Michael Cannon and physicist Art Ogawa. It was manufactured by Michael Cannon&#x27;s company, Micon Industries, and initially marketed by Kit Corson&#x27;s company, Silent Communications. In order to be compatible with the existing TTY network, the MCM was designed around the five-bit Baudot code established by the older TTY machines instead of the ASCII code used by computers. The MCM was an instant success with the deaf community despite the drawback of a $599 cost. Within six months there were more MCMs in use by the deaf and hard of hearing than TTY machines. After a year Micon took over the marketing of the MCM and subsequently concluded a deal with Pacific Bell (who coined the term &quot;TDD&quot;) to purchase MCMs and rent them to deaf telephone subscribers for $30 per month.

After Micon formed an alliance with APCOM, Michael Cannon (Micon), Paul Conover (Micon), and Andrea Saks (APCOM) successfully petitioned the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), resulting in a tariff that paid for TTY devices to be distributed free of cost to deaf persons. Micon produced over 1,000 MCMs per month, resulting in approximately 50,000 MCMs being disseminated into the deaf community.

Before he left Micon in 1980, Michael Cannon developed several computer compatible variations of the MCM and a portable, battery operated printing TTY, but they were never as popular as the original MCM. Newer model TTYs could communicate with selectable codes that allow communications at a higher bit rate on those models similarly equipped. However, the lack of true computer interface functionality spelled the demise of the original TTY and its clones. During the mid-1970s, other so-called portable telephone devices were being cloned by other companies, and this was the time period when the term &quot;TDD&quot; began being used largely by those outside the deaf community.

=== Text messaging and the Def-Tone System (DTS) ===
This relay system became known commonly as the Def-Tone System (DTS) because the tones representing letters of the alphabet were eventually carried in tones outside the range of human hearing. Today, this is commonly called multi-tap because you press a number 1, 2 or 3 times to get a corresponding letter. In 1994 Joseph Alan Poirier, a college student-worker, recommended using the system to send texts to forklifts to improve delivery of parts to the assembly line at GM Powertrain in Toledo, Ohio, and sending a text to pagers. He recommended taking pagers to alphanumeric displays incorporating the same system in discussions with the pager supplier for Outback Steakhouse and having relays put in the forklifts to ping alert messages to the pagers used in that system. He called it text messaging, coining the phrase. It is theorized that when Toyota forklift was allegedly hired by GM for this work, one of the subcontractors, Kyocera, utilized the work for the Toyota forklift company to create text messaging for cell phones.

=== Marsters Award ===
In 2009, AT&amp;T received the James C. Marsters Promotion Award from TDI (formerly Telecommunications for the Deaf, Inc.) for its efforts to increase accessibility to communication for people with disabilities. The award holds some irony; it was AT&amp;T that, in the 1960s, resisted efforts to implement TTY technology, claiming it would damage its communication equipment. In 1968, the Federal Communications Commission struck down AT&amp;T&#x27;s policy and forced it to offer TTY access to its network.

== Protocols ==
There are many different standards for TDDs and textphones.

=== Original 5-bit Baudot code ===
The original standard used by TTYs is a variant of the Baudot code. The maximum speed of this protocol is 10 characters per second. This is a half-duplex protocol, which means that only one person at a time may transmit characters. If both try to transmit at the same time, the characters will be garbled on the other end.

This protocol is commonly used in the United States.

This is a variant of the Baudot code, implemented as 5-bits per character transmitted asynchronously using frequency-shift key-modulation at either 45.5 or 50 baud, 1 start bit, 5 data bits, and 1.5 stop bits. Details of the protocol implementation are available in TIA-825-A and also in T-REC V.18 Annex A &quot;5-bit operational mode&quot;.

=== Turbo Code ===
The UltraTec company implements another protocol known as Enhanced TTY, which it calls &quot;Turbo Code,&quot; in its products. Turbo Code has some advantages over Baudot protocols, such as a higher data rate, full ASCII compliance, and full-duplex capability. However, Turbo Code is proprietary, and UltraTec gives its specifications only to parties who are willing to license it, although some information concerning it is disclosed in .

=== Other legacy protocols ===
Other protocols used for text telephony are European Deaf Telephone (EDT) and dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF).

The ITU-T V-series recommendations include the following early modem standards approved by the ITU in 1988:
* ITU-T V.21 specifies 300 bits per second duplex mode.
* ITU-T V.23 specifies audio frequency-shift keying modulation to encode and transfer data at 600/1200 bits per second.

=== V.18 ===
In 1994, the ITU approved the V.18 standard, which comprises two major parts, a dual standard. It is both an umbrella protocol that allows recognition and interoperability of some of the most commonly used textphone protocols, as well as offering a native V.18 mode, which is an ASCII full- or half-duplex modulation method.

Computers can, with appropriate software and modem, emulate a V.18 TTY. Some voice modems, coupled with appropriate software, can now be converted to TTY modems by using a software-based decoder for TTY tones. Same can be done with such software using a computer&#x27;s sound card, when coupled to the telephone line.

In the UK, a virtual V.18 network, called TextDirect, exists as part of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), thereby offering interoperability between textphones using different protocols. The platform also offers additional functionality like call progress and status information in text and automatic invocation of a relay service for speech-to-text calls.

=== Cell phones ===
Many digital cell phones are compatible with TTY devices.

Many people want to replace TTY with real-time text over IP (RTT), which can be used on a digital cell phone or tablet without a separate TTY device.

=== New technologies ===
As TDDs are increasingly considered legacy devices, with the emergence of modern technologies such as email, texting and instant messaging, text from TDD are increasingly being sent over Text over IP gateways, or other real-time text protocols. However, these newer methods require IP connections and will not work with regular analog phone lines, unless a data connection is used (i.e. dial-up Internet, or the modem method of multiplexing text and voice that is done on a Captioned Telephone hardware handset). Because some people have no access to any kind of data connection, and it is not even available in some parts within many countries, TTYs are still the only method for analog landline text phone calls, although TTYs include any device with a suitable modem and software.

== Other devices for the deaf or hard of hearing ==
In addition to TDD, there are a number of pieces of equipment that can be coupled to telephones to improve their utility. For those with hearing difficulties the telephone ring and conversation sound level can be amplified or pitch adjusted; ambient noise can also be filtered. The amplifier can be a simple addition or through an inductive coupler to interact with suitable hearing aids. The ring can also be supplemented with extension bells or a visual call indicator.

== Etiquette ==
There are some etiquette rules that users of TTYs must be aware of. Because of the inability to detect when a person has finished speaking—and the fact that two people typing will scramble the text on both ends—the term &quot;Go Ahead&quot; (GA) is used to denote the end of a turn, and an indication for the other person to begin typing.

=== Sample conversation ===
Caller A: HELLO JOHN, WHAT TIME WILL YOU BE COMING AROUND TODAY Q GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller B: HI FRED, I WILL BE AROUND NOON GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller A: OK, NO PROBLEM, DON&#x27;T FORGET TO BRING THE BOOKS AND THE WORK SO FAR GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller B: WILL DO SK &lt;br&gt;
Caller A: BYE BYE SKSK

SK is used to allow the users to say their farewells, while SKSK indicates an immediate call hang-up.

=== Sample conversation 2 ===
Caller A HI, THIS IS JOHN, CAN I ASK WHO IS CALLING? GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller B HI JOHN, ITS ME FRED, I AM WONDERING WHERE YOU ARE, ITS GETTING LATE TO GO OUT TO THE PUB GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller A HI FRED, SORRY I DONT THINK I CAN GO GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller B WHY CANT YOU GO? GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller A MY WIFE IS NOT FEELING WELL AND I HAVE NO BABYSITTER FOR MY KIDS! GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller B AWWWW DARN. I WANTED YOU THERE. OH WELL WHAT CAN YOU DO ? GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller A I KNOW.. I GOTTA GO. THE KIDS NEED ME. SEE YOU AROUND! BYE FOR NOW SK &lt;br&gt;
Caller B OK NO WORRIES SEE YOU SOON! BYE BYE SK GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller A SKSK (THE PARTY HAS HUNG UP)

=== Sample text relay call ===
Caller A TXD DIALING.. TXD RING... TXD OPERATOR CONNECTED.. EXPLAINING TEXT RELAY SERVICE. PLEASE WAIT... HI THIS IS JOHN GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller B HI JOHN ITS ME FRED. I AM WONDERING WHAT YOU ARE DOING TONIGHT? GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller A HI FRED. I AM THINKING OF HAVING A POKER NIGHT AT MINE, WHAT DO YOU THINK? GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller B GOOD IDEA, I&#x27;LL CALL A FEW MATES TO COME ROUND AND HAVE A GOOD GAME GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller A OK SEE YOU AT 7PM. BYE BYE SK GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller B OK SEE YOU AT 7PM BYE BYE SKSKSKSK GA &lt;br&gt;
Caller A THANK YOU FOR USING TEXT RELAY SERVICE. GOODBYE

&quot;Note: TTYs use only capital letters except when there are computer screens.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Note: In the UK, Text relay service used to be called typetalk (RNID) but have since merged with the phone line using the dialling prefix 18001 (TTY) or the 18002 (voice relay). The emergency line is 18000 (TTY).

== TRS relay ==
One of the most common uses for a TTY is to place calls to a Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS), which makes it possible for the deaf to successfully make phone calls to users of regular phone systems.

The voice recognition systems are in limited use, due to problems with the technology. A new development called the captioned telephone now uses voice recognition to assist the human operators. Newer text-based communication methods, such as short message service (SMS), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and instant messaging have also been adopted by the deaf as an alternative or adjunct to TTY.

<text>Boris Pavlovich Belousov (; 19 February 1893 – 12 June 1970) was a Soviet chemist and biophysicist who discovered the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction (BZ reaction) in the early 1950s. His work initiated the field of modern nonlinear chemical dynamics.

The Belousov family had strong anti-Tsarist sympathies and, after the Russian Revolution of 1905, they were arrested and later forced to leave the country. They settled in Switzerland, where Boris studied chemistry in Zürich.

Returning to Russia at the beginning of World War I, Belousov tried to join the army, but was denied for health reasons. He took up a job in a military lab under the direction of the chemist Vladimir Ipatiev. His value to the institute is indicated by the high military rank, Brigade Commander, roughly corresponding to General, that he attained.

After leaving the military, he took a job in the Laboratory of Biophysics in the Ministry of Health of the USSR, where he worked in toxicology. It was while seeking an inorganic analog of the biochemical citric acid cycle that Belousov chanced to discover an oscillating chemical reaction. He tried twice over a period of six years to publish his findings, but the incredulous editors of the journals to which he submitted his articles rejected his work as &quot;impossible&quot;. He took this very hard.

The biochemist Simon El&#x27;evich Shnoll, at the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics in Pushchino, heard of Belousov&#x27;s work and tried to encourage him to continue. Belousov gave Shnoll some of his experimental notes and agreed to publish an article in a rather obscure, non-reviewed, journal, but then essentially quit science. Shnoll gave the project to a graduate student, Anatol Zhabotinsky, who investigated the reaction in detail and succeeded in publishing his results. The reaction now bears the names of both Belousov and Zhabotinsky.

Belousov was posthumously awarded the Lenin Prize in 1980 for his work on the BZ reaction.

<text>AX.25 (Amateur X.25) is a data link layer protocol originally derived from layer 2 of the X.25 protocol suite and designed for use by amateur radio operators. It is used extensively on amateur packet radio networks.

AX.25 v2.0 is responsible for establishing link layer connections, transferring data encapsulated in frames between nodes, and detecting errors introduced by the communications channel.

AX.25 v2.2 (1998) improved efficiency, especially at higher data rates. Stations can automatically negotiate payload sizes larger than the previous limitation of 256 bytes. Extended sequence numbers (7 vs. 3 bits) allow a larger window size, the number of frames that can be sent before waiting for acknowledgement. &quot;Selective Reject&quot; allows only the missing frames to be resent, rather than having to wastefully resend frames that have already been received successfully. Despite all these advantages, few implementations have been updated to include these improvements published more than 20 years ago. The only known complete implementation of v2.2, at this time (2020), is the Dire Wolf software TNC.

AX.25 is commonly used as the data link layer for network layer such as IPv4, with TCP used on top of that. AX.25 supports a limited form of source routing. Although it is possible to build AX.25 switches similar to the way Ethernet switches work, this has not yet been accomplished.

==Specification==
AX.25 does not define a physical layer implementation. In practice 1200 baud Bell 202 tones and 9600 baud G3RUH DFSK are almost exclusively used on VHF and UHF. On HF the standard transmission mode is 300 baud Bell 103 tones. At the physical layer, AX.25 defines only a &quot;physical layer state machine&quot; and some timers related to transmitter and receiver switching delays.

At the link layer, AX.25 uses HDLC frame syntax and procedures. (ISO 3309) frames are transmitted with NRZI encoding. HDLC specifies the syntax, but not the semantics, of the variable-length address field of the frame. AX.25 specifies that this field is subdivided into multiple addresses: a source address, zero or more repeater addresses, and a destination address, with embedded control fields for use by the repeaters. To simplify compliance with amateur radio rules, these addresses derive from the station call signs of the source, destination and repeater stations.

Media access control follows the Carrier sense multiple access approach with collision recovery (CSMA/CR).

AX.25 supports both virtual-circuit connected and datagram-style connectionless modes of operation. The latter is used to great effect by the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS).

A simple source routing mechanism using digipeaters is available at the datalink level. Digipeaters act as simplex repeaters, receiving, decoding and retransmitting packets from local stations. They allow multi-hop connections to be established between two stations unable to communicate directly. The digipeaters use and modify the information in the frame&#x27;s address field to perform this function.

The AX.25 specification defines a complete, albeit &quot;point to point only&quot; network layer protocol, but this has seen little use outside of keyboard-to-keyboard or keyboard-to-BBS connections. NET/ROM, ROSE, and TexNet exist to provide routing between nodes. In principle, a variety of layer 3 protocols can be used with AX.25, including the ubiquitous Internet Protocol (IP). This approach is used by AMPRNet, which is an amateur radio TCP/IP network using AX.25 UI-frames at the datalink layer.

==Implementations==
Traditionally, amateur radio operators have connected to AX.25 networks through the use of a terminal node controller, which contains a microprocessor and an implementation of the protocol in firmware. These devices allow network resources to be accessed using only a dumb terminal and a transceiver.

AX.25 has also been implemented on personal computers. For example, the Linux kernel includes native support for AX.25. The computer connects to a transceiver via its audio interface or via a simple modem. The computers can also interconnect to other computers or be bridged or routed to TNCs and transceivers located elsewhere using BPQ over Ethernet framing, which is also natively supported by the Linux kernel to facilitate more modern setups with the actual transceivers directly placed under or in the antenna mast, creating a &#x27;low loss&#x27;, shorter RF wiring need, and replacing expensive and long and thick coax cables and amplifiers with cheap fiber (RFI (both ways)/EMP/lightning resistant) or copper Ethernet wiring. BPQ Ethernet framing allows connecting entire stacks of TNC+transceiver pairs to any existing network of computers which then can all access all radio links offered simultaneously (transparently bridged), communicate with each other internally over AX.25, or with filtered routing select specific TNCs/radio frequencies.

Dire Wolf is a free open-source replacement for the 1980s-style TNC. It contains DSP software modems and a complete implementation of AX25 v2.2 plus FX.25 forward error correction. It can function as a digital repeater, GPS tracker, and APRS Internet Gateway (IGate) without any additional software.

===KISS-mode framing===
:&quot;See full article at KISS (TNC)&quot;
AX.25 is often used with a TNC that implements the KISS framing as a low-cost alternative to using expensive and uncommon HDLC controller cards.

The KISS framing is not part of the AX.25 protocol itself nor is it sent over the air. It merely serves to encapsulate the protocol frames in a way that can successfully pass over a serial link to the TNC. The KISS framing is derived from SLIP, and makes many of the same assumptions, such as there only being two &quot;endpoints&quot; involved in the conversation. With SLIP, these were the two SLIP-connected hosts; with KISS, it is assumed that the KISS framing link is over serial with only the host computer and the TNC involved. Among other things, this makes it awkward to address multiple TNCs without having multiple (serial) data channels.

Alternatives to KISS do exist that address these limitations, such as 6PACK.

==Applications==
AX.25 has most frequently been used to establish direct, point-to-point links between packet radio stations, without any additional network layers. This is sufficient for keyboard-to-keyboard contacts between stations and for accessing local bulletin board systems and DX clusters.

In recent years, APRS has become a popular application.

For tunneling of AX.25 packets over IP, AXIP and AXUDP are used to encapsulate AX.25 into IP or UDP packets.

==Limitations==
At the speeds commonly used to transmit packet radio data (rarely higher than 9,600 bit/s, and typically 1,200 bit/s), the use of additional network layers with AX.25 is impractical due to the data overhead involved. This is not a limitation of AX.25 &quot;per se&quot;, but places constraints on the sophistication of applications designed to use it.

HDLC protocols identify each frame by an address. The AX.25 implementation of HDLC includes sender and destination &quot;station call-sign&quot; plus four-bit Secondary Station Identifier (SSID) value in range 0 through 15 in the frame address.
At ITU WARC2003 the radio amateur station callsign specification was amended so that the earlier maximum length of six characters was raised to seven characters. However, AX.25 has a built-in hard limit of six characters, which means a seven-character callsign cannot be used in an AX.25 network.

AX.25 lacks an explicit &quot;port&quot; (or SAP); the SSID often assumes this role. Thus there can be only one service per AX.25 station SSID address, which is often kludged around with varying degrees of success.

Some amateurs, notably Phil Karn KA9Q, have argued that AX.25 is not well-suited to operation over noisy, limited-bandwidth radio links, citing its lack of forward error correction (FEC) and automatic data compression. However, a viable widely adopted successor to AX.25 has yet to emerge. Likely reasons may include:

* a large existing deployment of recycled narrowband FM radios and especially existing APRS applications,
* easy availability of cheap, low-power FM transmitters, especially for the 430 MHz UHF band, to match existing legacy radio gear,
* new radio level modulations would need different radio gear than what is currently in use and the resulting system would be incompatible with the existing one thus requiring a large initial investment in new radio gear,
* adoption of newer line codings potentially including &quot;forward error correction&quot; takes more effort than the 1,200 bit/s AFSK of Bell 202. Previously sufficient small 8-bit microprocessors with 128 bytes of RAM would not be enough, and new ones might cost US$30 instead of US$3. Phil Karn did demo decoding of this new modulation of his by running it on a Pentium II machine some 10 years later, mid-level embedded microprocessors are capable enough to do the same with under US$50 system cost.

Despite these limitations, an extension to the AX.25 protocol, supporting forward error correction, has been created by the TAPR. This extension is called FX.25.

Small gadget transmitters do not need to know what is being transmitted. There is only a need to monitor channel occupation by radio receiver RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) to know when not to send. Transmitting interleaved Reed-Solomon FEC signal in some smart modulation needs a lot fewer resources than reception of the same signal, thus a sufficient microprocessor might cost just US$5 instead of US$30 and a system cost might stay below US$50, transmitter included. However, in recent years, the ability to receive as well as send using cheap microcontrollers (such as the Atmel AVR or the Motorola 68HC08 families) has been demonstrated.

It seems, however, that any new system that is not compatible with the current Bell 202 modulation is unlikely to be widely adopted. The current modulation seems to fulfill sufficient need that little motivation exists to move to a superior design, especially if the new design requires significant hardware purchases.

Most recently, a wholly new protocol with forward error correction has been created by Nino Carillo, KK4HEJ, called Improved Layer 2 Protocol (IL2P).

<text>Robert H. Lochner (October 20, 1918 - September 21, 2003) was a journalist who helped to revive the free media in West Germany after World War II and who is most well known for assisting John F. Kennedy with his famous &quot;&quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; speech in 1963.

==Early life==
Born in New York City on October 20, 1918, to Louis and Emmy Lochner (née Hoyer), Lochner grew up in Berlin.

==Education==
Lochner studied one semester at the University of Berlin, and then took a B.A. and an M.A. in Political Science and Economics at the University of Chicago and remained in the U.S.

==Career==
Lochner worked for NBC during World War II, and returned to Germany as a U.S. soldier in 1945. His firm knowledge of the German language enabled him to become chief interpreter for the US occupation forces in Western Germany, until he took a position as chief editor of the &quot;Neue Zeitung&quot; newspaper in Frankfurt in 1949.

Lochner also was head of the Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor (RIAS, ), a radio station supported by the US government in West Berlin during Kennedy&#x27;s visit to West Germany. Lochner famously acted as Kennedy&#x27;s interpreter, helping the president practice his speech on June 26, 1963, and the key phrase &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot;&quot; (&quot;I am a Berliner&quot;), for which he created the phonetic spelling &quot;&quot;ish bin ein bear-lee-ner&quot;&quot;.

Later in his life, Lochner worked in Vietnam and Washington before retiring in Berlin. He died from a pulmonary embolism on September 21, 2003, and left three daughters and a son.

<text>Irish nationalism is a nationalist political movement which, in its broadest sense, asserts that the people of Ireland should govern Ireland as a sovereign state. Since the mid-19th century, Irish nationalism has largely taken the form of cultural nationalism based on the principles of national self-determination and popular sovereignty. Irish nationalists during the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries such as the United Irishmen in the 1790s, Young Irelanders in the 1840s, the Fenian Brotherhood during the 1880s, Fianna Fáil in the 1920s, and Sinn Féin styled themselves in various ways after French left-wing radicalism and republicanism. Irish nationalism celebrates the culture of Ireland, especially the Irish language, literature, music, and sports. It grew more potent during the period in which all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, which led to most of the island gaining independence from the UK in 1922.

Irish nationalists believe that foreign English and later British rule in Ireland from the 1169 English Norman Invasion of Ireland onwards has been detrimental to Irish interests. At the time of the partition of Ireland most of the island was Roman Catholic and largely indigenous, while a sizeable portion of the country, particularly in the north, was Protestant and chiefly descended from people of Great Britain who colonised the land as settlers during the reign of King James I in 1609. Partition was along these ethno-religious lines, with most of Ireland gaining independence, while six northern counties remained part of the United Kingdom. Irish nationalists support Irish reunification.

==History==
===Early development===
Generally, Irish nationalism is regarded as having emerged following the Renaissance revival of the concept of the &quot;patria&quot; and the religious struggle between the ideology of the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation. At this early stage in the 16th century, Irish nationalism represented an ideal of the native Gaelic Irish and the Old English banding together in common cause, under the banner of Catholicism and Irish civic identity (&quot;faith and fatherland&quot;), hoping to protect their land and interests from the New English Protestant forces sponsored by England. This vision sought to overcome the old ethnic divide between &quot;Gaeil&quot; (the native Irish) and &quot;Gaill&quot; (the Normans) which had been a feature of Irish life since the 12th century, following the Norman invasion of Ireland.

Protestantism in England introduced a religious element to the 16th-century Tudor conquest of Ireland, as many of the native Gaels and Hiberno-Normans remained Catholic. The Plantations of Ireland dispossessed many native Catholic landowners in favour of Protestant settlers from England and Scotland. In addition, the Plantation of Ulster, which began in 1609, &quot;planted&quot; a sizeable population of English and Scottish Protestant settlers into the north of Ireland.

Irish aristocrats waged many campaigns against the English presence. A prime example is the rebellion of Hugh O&#x27;Neill which became known as the Nine Years&#x27; War of 1594–1603, which aimed to expel the English and make Ireland a Spanish protectorate.

A more significant movement came in the 1640s, after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, when a coalition of Gaelic Irish and Old English Catholics set up a &quot;de facto&quot; independent Irish state to fight in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (&quot;see Confederate Irelan&quot;d). The Confederate Catholics of Ireland, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny, emphasised the idea of Ireland as a Kingdom independent from England, albeit under the same monarch. They demanded autonomy for the Irish Parliament, full rights for Catholics and an end to the confiscation of Catholic-owned land. However, the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649–1653) destroyed the Confederate cause and resulted in the permanent dispossession of the old Catholic landowning class.

A similar Irish Catholic monarchist movement emerged in the 1680s and 1690s, when Irish Catholic Jacobites supported James II after his deposition in England in the Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689. The Jacobites demanded that Irish Catholics have a majority in an autonomous Irish Parliament, the restoration of confiscated Catholic land, and an Irish-born Lord Deputy of Ireland. Similarly to the Confederates of the 1640s, the Jacobites were conscious of representing the &quot;Irish nation&quot; but were not separatists and largely represented the interests of the landed class as opposed to all the Irish people. Also similarly to the Confederates they suffered defeat, in the Williamite War in Ireland (1689–1691). Thereafter, the largely English Protestant Ascendancy dominated Irish government and landholding. The Penal Laws discriminated against non-Anglicans. (&quot;See also History of Ireland 1536–1691&quot;.)

This coupling of religious and ethnic identity – principally Roman Catholic and Gaelic – as well as a consciousness of dispossession and defeat at the hands of British and Protestant forces, became enduring features of Irish nationalism. However, the Irish Catholic movements of the 16th century were invariably led by a small landed and clerical elite. Professor Kevin Whelan has traced the emergence of the modern Catholic-nationalist identity that formed in 1760–1830. Irish historian Marc Caball, on the other hand, claims that &quot;early modern Irish nationalism&quot; began to be established after the Flight of the Earls (1607), based on the concepts of &quot;the indivisibility of Gaelic cultural integrity, territorial sovereignty, and the interlinking of Gaelic identity with profession of the Roman Catholic faith&quot;.

===Early nationalism===
====Pre-Union====

The exclusively Protestant Parliament of Ireland of the eighteenth century repeatedly called for more autonomy from the British Parliament – particularly the repeal of Poynings&#x27; Law, which allowed the latter to legislate for Ireland. They were supported by popular sentiment that came from the various publications of William Molyneux about Irish constitutional independence; this was later reinforced by Jonathan Swift&#x27;s incorporation of these ideas into &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot;.

Parliamentarians who wanted more self-government formed the Irish Patriot Party, led by Henry Grattan, who achieved substantial legislative independence in 1782–83. Grattan and radical elements of the &#x27;Irish Whig&#x27; party campaigned in the 1790s for Catholic political equality and reform of electoral rights. He wanted useful links with Britain to remain, best understood by his comment: &#x27;The channel the Irish sea] forbids union; the ocean forbids separation&#x27;.

Grattan&#x27;s movement was notable for being both inclusive and nationalist as many of its members were descended from the Anglo/Irish minority. Many other nationalists such as Samuel Neilson, Theobald Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet were also descended from plantation families which had arrived in Ireland since 1600. From Grattan in the 1770s to Parnell up to 1890, nearly all the leaders of Irish separatism were Protestant nationalists.

Modern Irish nationalism with democratic aspirations began in the 1790s with the founding of the Society of the United Irishmen. It sought to end discrimination against Catholics and Presbyterians and to found an independent Irish republic. Most of the United Irish leaders were Catholic and Presbyterian and inspired by the French Revolution, wanted a society without sectarian divisions, the continuation of which they attributed to the British domination over the country. They were sponsored by the French Republic, which was then the enemy of the Holy See. The United Irishmen led the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which was repressed with great bloodshed. As a result, the Irish Parliament voted to abolish itself in the Act of Union of 1800–01 and thereafter Irish Members of Parliament sat in London.

====Post-Union====
Two forms of Irish nationalism arose from these events. One was a radical movement, known as Irish republicanism. It believed the use of force was necessary to found a secular, egalitarian Irish republic, advocated by groups such as the Young Irelanders, some of whom launched a rebellion in 1848.

The other nationalist tradition was more moderate, urging non-violent means to seek concessions from the British government. While both nationalist traditions were predominantly Catholic in their support base, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church were opposed to republican separatism on the grounds of its violent methods and secular ideology, while they usually supported non-violent reformist nationalism.

Daniel O&#x27;Connell was the leader of the moderate tendency. O&#x27;Connell, head of the Catholic Association and Repeal Association in the 1820s, 1830s and 1840s, campaigned for Catholic Emancipation – full political rights for Catholics – and then Repeal of the Union, or Irish self-government under the Crown. Catholic Emancipation was achieved, but self-government was not. O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s movement was more explicitly Catholic than its eighteenth-century predecessors. It enjoyed the support of the Catholic clergy, who had denounced the United Irishmen and reinforced the association between Irish identity and Catholicism. The Repeal Association used traditional Irish imagery, such as the harp, and located its mass meetings in sites such as Tara and Clontarf which had a special resonance in Irish history.

===Repeal Association and Young Ireland===
The Great Famine of 1845–1849 caused great bitterness among Irish people against the British government, which was perceived as having failed to avert the deaths of up to a million people. British support for the 1860 plebiscites on Italian unification prompted Alexander Martin Sullivan to launch a &quot;National Petition&quot; for a referendum on repeal of the union; in 1861 Daniel O&#x27;Donoghue submitted the 423,026 signatures to no effect.

The Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and Fenian Brotherhood were set up in Ireland and the United States, respectively, in 1858 by militant republicans, including Young Irelanders. The latter dissolved into factions after organising unsuccessful raids on Canada by Irish veterans of the American Civil War, and the IRB launched Clan na Gael as a replacement. In Ireland itself, the IRB tried an armed revolt in 1867 but, as it was heavily infiltrated by police informers, the rising was a failure.

In the late 19th century, Irish nationalism became the dominant ideology in Ireland, having a major Parliamentary party in the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster that launched a concerted campaign for self-government.

===Land League===
Mass nationalist mobilisation began when Isaac Butt&#x27;s Home Rule League (which had been founded in 1873 but had little following) adopted social issues in the late 1870s – especially the question of land redistribution. Michael Davitt (an IRB member) founded the Irish Land League in 1879 during an agricultural depression to agitate for tenant&#x27;s rights. Some would argue the land question had a nationalist resonance in Ireland as many Irish Catholics believed that land had been unjustly taken from their ancestors by Protestant English colonists in the 17th-century Plantations of Ireland. Indeed, the Irish landed class was still largely an Anglo-Irish Protestant group in the 19th century. Such perceptions were underlined in the Land league&#x27;s language and literature. However, others would argue that the Land League had its direct roots in tenant associations formed in the period of agricultural prosperity during the government of Lord Palmerston in the 1850s and 1860s, who were seeking to strengthen the economic gains they had already made. Following the depression of 1879 and the subsequent fall in prices (and hence profits), these farmers were threatened with rising rents and eviction for failure to pay rents. In addition, small farmers, especially in the west faced the prospect of another famine in the harsh winter of 1879. At first, the Land League campaigned for the &quot;Three Fs&quot; – fair rent, free sale and fixity of tenure. Then, as prices for agricultural products fell further and the weather worsened in the mid-1880s, tenants organised themselves by withholding rent during the 1886–1891 Plan of Campaign movement.

Militant nationalists such as the Fenians saw that they could use the groundswell of support for land reform to recruit nationalist support, this is the reason why the New Departure – a decision by the IRB to adopt social issues – occurred in 1879. Republicans from Clan na Gael (who were loath to recognise the British Parliament) saw this as an opportunity to recruit the masses to agitate for Irish self-government. This agitation, which became known as the &quot;Land War&quot;, turned increasingly violent when Land Leaguers resisted attempts by the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) to evict tenant farmers by force. This upheaval eventually resulted in the British government subsidising the sale of landlords&#x27; estates to their tenants in the Irish Land Acts authored by William O&#x27;Brien. It also provided a mass base for constitutional Irish nationalists who had founded the Home Rule League in 1873. Charles Stewart Parnell (somewhat paradoxically, a Protestant landowner) took over the Land League and used its popularity to launch the Irish National League in 1882 as a support basis for the newly formed Irish Parliamentary Party, to campaign for Home Rule.

===Cultural nationalism===

An important feature of Irish nationalism from the late 19th century onwards was a commitment to Gaelic Irish culture. A broad intellectual movement, the Celtic Revival, grew up in the late 19th century. Though largely initiated by artists and writers of Protestant or Anglo-Irish background, the movement nonetheless captured the imaginations of idealists from native Irish and Catholic background. Periodicals such as &quot;United Ireland&quot;, &quot;Weekly News&quot;, &quot;Young Ireland&quot;, and &quot;Weekly National Press&quot; (1891–92), became influential in promoting Ireland&#x27;s native cultural identity. A frequent contributor, the poet John McDonald&#x27;s stated aim was &quot;to hasten, as far as in my power lay, Ireland&#x27;s deliverance&quot;.

Other organisations promoting the Irish language or the Gaelic Revival were the Gaelic League and later Conradh na Gaeilge. The Gaelic Athletic Association was also formed in this era to promote Gaelic football, hurling, and Gaelic handball; it forbade its members to play English sports such as association football, rugby union, and cricket.

Most cultural nationalists were English speakers, and their organisations had little impact in the Irish speaking areas or Gaeltachtaí, where the language has continued to decline (see article). However, these organisations attracted large memberships and were the starting point for many radical Irish nationalists of the early twentieth century, especially the leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916 such as Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh, and Joseph Plunkett. The main aim was to emphasise an area of difference between Ireland and Germanic England, but most of the population continued to speak English.

The cultural Gaelic aspect did not extend into actual politics; while nationalists were interested in the surviving Chiefs of the Name, the descendants of the former Gaelic clan leaders, the chiefs were not involved in politics, nor noticeably interested in the attempt to recreate a Gaelic state.

===Home Rule beginnings===

Although Parnell and some other Home Rulers, such as Isaac Butt, were Protestants, Parnell&#x27;s party was overwhelmingly Catholic. At local branch level, Catholic priests were an important part of its organisation. Home Rule was opposed by Unionists (those who supported the Union with Britain), mostly Protestant and from Ulster under the slogan, &quot;Home Rule is Rome Rule.&quot;

At the time, some politicians and members of the British public would have seen this movement as radical and militant. Detractors quoted Charles Stewart Parnell&#x27;s Cincinnati speech in which he claimed to be collecting money for &quot;bread and lead&quot;. He was allegedly sworn into the secret Irish Republican Brotherhood in May 1882. However, the fact that he chose to stay in Westminster following the expulsion of 29 Irish MPs (when those in the Clan expected an exodus of nationalist MPs from Westminster to set up a provisional government in Dublin) and his failure in 1886 to support the Plan of Campaign (an aggressive agrarian programme launched to counter agricultural distress), marked him as an essentially constitutional politician, though not averse to using agitational methods as a means of putting pressure on parliament.

Coinciding as it did with the extension of the franchise in British politics – and with it the opportunity for most Irish Catholics to vote – Parnell&#x27;s party quickly became an important player in British politics. Home Rule was favoured by William Ewart Gladstone, but opposed by many in the British Liberal and Conservative parties. Home Rule would have meant a devolved Irish parliament within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The first two Irish Home Rule Bills were put before the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 1886 and 1893, but they were bitterly resisted and the second bill ultimately defeated in the Conservative&#x27;s pro-Unionist majority controlled House of Lords.

Following the fall and death of Parnell in 1891 after a divorce crisis, which enabled the Irish Roman Catholic hierarchy to pressure MPs to drop Parnell as their leader, the Irish Party split into two factions, the INL and the INF, becoming practically ineffective from 1892 to 1898. Only after the passing of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 which granted extensive power to previously non-existent county councils, allowing nationalists for the first time through local elections to democratically run local affairs previously under the control of landlord dominated &quot;Grand Juries&quot;, and William O&#x27;Brien founding the United Irish League that year, did the Irish Parliamentary Party reunite under John Redmond in January 1900, returning to its former strength in the following September general election.

===Transformation of rural Ireland===
The first decade of the twentieth century saw considerable advancement in economic and social development in rural Ireland, where 60% of the population lived. The introduction of local self-government in 1898 created a class of experienced politicians capable of later taking over national self-government in the 1920s. The Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903 (the Wyndham Act), passed largely through the efforts of William O&#x27;Brien, abolished landlordism, and made it easier for tenant farmers to purchase lands, financed and guaranteed by the government. By 1914, 75 per cent of occupiers were buying out their landlords&#x27; freehold interest through the Land Commission, mostly under the Land Acts of 1903 and 1909. O&#x27;Brien then pursued and won in alliance with the Irish Land and Labour Association and D.D. Sheehan, who followed in the footsteps of Michael Davitt, the landmark 1906 and 1911 Labourers (Ireland) Acts, where the Liberal government financed 40,000 rural labourers to become proprietors of their own cottage homes, each on an acre of land. &quot;It is not an exaggeration to term it a social revolution, and it was the first large-scale rural public-housing scheme in the country, with up to a quarter of a million housed under the Labourers Acts up to 1921, the majority erected by 1916&quot;, changing the face of rural Ireland.

The combination of land reform and devolved local government gave Irish nationalists an economic political base on which to base their demands for self-government. Some in the British administration felt initially that paying for such a degree of land and housing reform amounted to an unofficial policy of &quot;killing home rule by kindness&quot;, yet by 1914 some form of Home Rule for most of Ireland was guaranteed. This was shelved on the outbreak of World War I in August 1914.

A new source of radical Irish nationalism developed in the same period in the cities outside Ulster. In 1896, James Connolly, founded the Irish Socialist Republican Party in Dublin. Connolly&#x27;s party was small and unsuccessful in elections, but his fusion of socialism and Irish republicanism was to have a sustained impact on republican thought. In 1913, during the general strike known as the Dublin Lockout, Connolly and James Larkin formed a workers militia, the Irish Citizen Army, to defend strikers from the police. While initially a purely defensive body, under Connolly&#x27;s leadership, the ICA became a revolutionary body, dedicated to an independent Workers Republic in Ireland. After the outbreak of the First World War, Connolly became determined to launch an insurrection to this end.

===Home Rule crisis 1912–14===
Home Rule was eventually won by John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party and granted under the Third Home Rule Act 1914. However, Irish self-government was limited by the prospect of partition of Ireland between north and south. This idea had first been mooted under the Second Home Rule Bill in 1893. In 1912, following the entry of the Third Home Rule Bill through the House of Commons, unionists organised mass resistance to its implementation, organising around the &quot;Ulster Covenant&quot;. In 1912 they formed the Ulster Volunteers, an armed wing of Ulster Unionism who stated that they would resist Home Rule by force. British Conservatives supported this stance. In addition, in 1914 British officers based at the Curragh Camp indicated that they would be unwilling to act against the Ulster Volunteers should they be ordered to.

In response, Nationalists formed their own paramilitary group, the Irish Volunteers, to ensure the implementation of Home Rule. It looked for several months in 1914 as if civil war was imminent between the two armed factions. Only the All-for-Ireland League party advocated granting every conceivable concession to Ulster to stave off a partition amendment. Redmond rejected their proposals. The amended Home Rule Act was passed and placed with Royal Assent on the statute books, but was suspended after the outbreak of World War I in 1914, until the end of the war. This led radical republican groups to argue that Irish independence could never be won peacefully and gave the northern question little thought at all.

===World War I and the Easter Rising===
The Irish Volunteer movement was divided over the attitude of their leadership to Ireland&#x27;s involvement in World War I. The majority followed John Redmond in support of the British and Allied war effort, seeing it as the only option to ensure the enactment of Home Rule after the war, Redmond saying &quot;you will return as an armed army capable of confronting Ulster&#x27;s opposition to Home Rule&quot;. They split off from the main movement and formed the National Volunteers, and were among the 180,000 Irishmen who served in Irish regiments of the Irish 10th and 16th Divisions of the New British Army formed for the War.

A minority of the Irish Volunteers, mostly led by members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), refused to support the War and kept their arms to guarantee the passage of Home Rule. Within this grouping, another faction planned an insurrection against British rule in Ireland, while the War was going on. Critical in this regard were Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh, and Thomas Clarke. These men were part of an inner circle that were operating in secret within the ranks of the IRB to plan this rising unknown to the rest of the volunteers. James Connolly, the labour leader, first intended to launch his own insurrection for an Irish Socialist Republic decided early in 1916 to combine forces with the IRB. In April 1916, just over a thousand dissident Volunteers and 250 members of the Citizen&#x27;s Army launched the Easter Rising in the Dublin General Post Office and, in the Easter Proclamation, proclaimed the independence of the Irish Republic. The Rising was put down within a week, at a cost of about 500 killed, mainly unengaged civilians. Although the rising failed, Britain&#x27;s General Maxwell executed fifteen of the Rising&#x27;s leaders, including Pearse, MacDonagh, Clarke and Connolly, and arrested some 3,000 political activists which led to widespread public sympathy for the rebel&#x27;s cause. Following this example, physical force republicanism became increasingly powerful and, for the following seven years or so, became the dominant force in Ireland, securing substantial independence but at a cost of dividing Ireland.

The Irish Parliamentary Party was discredited after Home Rule had been suspended at the outbreak of World War I, in the belief that the war would be over by the end of 1915, then by the severe losses suffered by Irish battalions in Gallipoli at Cape Helles and on the Western Front. They were also damaged by the harsh British response to the Easter Rising, who treated the rebellion as treason in time of war when they declared martial law in Ireland. Moderate constitutional nationalism as represented by the Irish Party was in due course eclipsed by Sinn Féin – a hitherto small party which the British had (mistakenly) blamed for the Rising and subsequently taken over as a vehicle for Irish Republicanism.

Two further attempts to implement Home Rule in 1916 and 1917 also failed when John Redmond, leader of the Irish Party, refused to concede partition while accepting there could be no coercion of Ulster. An Irish Convention to resolve the deadlock was established in July 1917 by the British Prime Minister, Lloyd George, its members both nationalists and unionists tasked with finding a means of implementing Home Rule. However, Sinn Féin refused to take part in the convention as it refused to discuss the possibility of full Irish independence. The Ulster unionists led by Edward Carson insisted on the partition of six Ulster counties from the rest of Ireland, stating that the 1916 rebellion proved a parliament in Dublin could not be trusted.

The convention&#x27;s work was disrupted in March 1918 by Redmond&#x27;s death and the fierce German spring offensive on the Western Front, causing Britain to attempt to contemplate extending conscription to Ireland. This was extremely unpopular, opposed both by the Irish Parliamentary Party under its new leader John Dillon, the All-for-Ireland Party as well as Sinn Féin and other national bodies. It resulted in the Conscription Crisis of 1918. In May at the height of the crisis 73 prominent Sinn Féiners were arrested on the grounds of an alleged German Plot. Both these events contributed to a widespread rise in support for Sinn Féin and the Volunteers. The Armistice ended the war in November, and was followed by elections.

===Militant separatism and Irish independence===
In the General election of 1918, Sinn Féin won 73 seats, 25 of these unopposed, or statistically nearly 70% of Irish representation, under the British &quot;First past the post&quot; voting-system, but had a minority representation in Ulster. They achieved a total of 476,087 (46.9%) of votes polled for 48 seats, compared to 220,837 (21.7%) votes polled by the IPP for only six seats, who due to the &quot;first past the post&quot; voting system did not win a proportional share of seats. Unionists (including Unionist Labour) votes were 305,206 (30.2%)

The Sinn Féin MPs refused to take their seats in Westminster, 27 of these (the rest were either still imprisoned or impaired) setting up their own Parliament called the Dáil Éireann in January 1919 and declared the Irish Republic to be in existence. Nationalists in the south of Ireland, impatient with the lack of progress on Irish self-government, tended to ignore the unresolved and volatile Ulster situation, generally arguing that unionists had no choice but to ultimately follow. On 11 September 1919, the British proscribed the Dáil, which had met nine times by then, declaring it an illegal assembly, Ireland being still part of the United Kingdom. In 1919, a guerilla war broke out between the Irish Republican Army (IRA) (as the Irish Volunteers were now calling themselves) and the British security forces &quot;(See Irish War of Independence)&quot;.

The campaign created tensions between the political and military sides of the nationalist movement. The IRA, nominally subject to the Dáil, in practice, often acted on its own initiative. At the top, the IRA leadership, of Michael Collins and Richard Mulcahy, operated with little reference to Cathal Brugha, the Dáil&#x27;s Minister for Defence or Éamon de Valera, the President of the Irish Republic – at best giving them a supervisory role. At local level, IRA commanders such as Dan Breen, Sean Moylan, Tom Barry, Sean MacEoin, Liam Lynch and others avoided contact with the IRA command, let alone the Dáil itself. This meant that the violence of the War of Independence rapidly escalated beyond what many in Sinn Féin and Dáil were happy with. Arthur Griffith, for example, favoured passive resistance over the use of force, but he could do little to affect the cycle of violence between IRA guerrillas and Crown forces that emerged over 1919–1920. The military conflict produced only a handful of killings in 1919, but steadily escalated from the summer of 1920 onwards with the introduction of the paramilitary police forces, the Black and Tans and Auxiliary Division into Ireland. From November 1920 to July 1921, over 1000 people died in the conflict (compared to c. 400 until then).

==Northern Ireland==
For the first hundred years of its existence, Northern Ireland had a unionist majority, but had a large nationalist minority who would prefer to be part of a united Ireland. In Northern Ireland, the term &quot;nationalist&quot; is used to refer either to the Catholic population in general or to the supporters of the moderate Social Democratic and Labour Party. &quot;Nationalism&quot; in this restricted meaning refers to a political tradition that favours an independent, united Ireland achieved by non-violent means. The more militant strand of nationalism, as espoused by Sinn Féin, is generally described as &quot;republican&quot; and was regarded as somewhat distinct, although the modern-day party is a constitutional party committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means.

55.8% of voters in Northern Ireland voted for the United Kingdom to remain a part of the European Union in the 23 June 2016 referendum in which the country as a whole voted to leave the union. The results in Northern Ireland were influenced by fears of a strong border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as well as by fears of a hard border breaking the Good Friday Agreement.

Three significant events occurred in December 2019, February 2020 and May 2022, respectively. First, the UK general election saw more nationalist MPs elected in Northern Ireland than unionist ones for the first time ever (nine nationalists and eight unionists). Two months later, Sinn Féin won the most votes in the 2020 Irish general election, thus ending 100 years of dominance in the Republic by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, but still finished one seat behind the latter in the Daíl. Finally, at the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election, Sinn Féin won the highest number of seats, the first time a nationalist party had done so in Northern Ireland&#x27;s 101-year history. This resulted in the Assembly&#x27;s first nationalist First Minister, Michelle O&#x27;Neill being selected in February 2024.

<text>Hugo John Smelter Young (13 October 1938 – 22 September 2003) was a British journalist and columnist and senior political commentator at &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born in Sheffield into an old recusant Roman Catholic family, he was head boy at Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire during his youth; later, he read law at Balliol College, Oxford, and worked for the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; in Leeds from 1961. In 1963, he spent a year as a Harkness Fellow in the United States and he spent the next year working as a congressional fellow.

==Journalistic career==
In 1965, Young returned to the United Kingdom. He was recruited by Denis Hamilton of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. In his second year there, he became chief leader writer, a position he kept until 1977. From 1973–84, he was also the paper&#x27;s political editor. He established a Sunday column, &quot;Inside Politics&quot;, that made him famous. Beginning in 1981, he also held the position of joint deputy editor. However, Young&#x27;s relationship with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; cooled notably when Rupert Murdoch took over the paper in 1981. The conflict culminated in a series of battles with editor Andrew Neil, particularly over the US invasion of Grenada in 1983. This ultimately led to Young&#x27;s leaving &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and joining &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1984.

Young continued to write a twice-weekly political column at &quot;The Guardian&quot; until his death. Young was a strong proponent of European integration, and sharply expressed his disappointment with the British government&#x27;s eurosceptic politics in his columns, including Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s decision to side with George W. Bush instead of his EU partners in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Despite these differences, Young remained on good terms with senior ministers, including Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher. He wrote a critical biography of the latter, &quot;One of Us&quot; (1989), in addition to a very critical article that he wrote two weeks before his death but which was not published until after Thatcher&#x27;s death, nearly ten years after his own. He wrote other books, including &quot;This Blessed Plot: Britain and Europe from Churchill to Blair&quot;, which was published in 1998. From 1989 onward, Young was the chairman of the Scott Trust, which owns &quot;The Guardian&quot; and other news media, and helped the paper through important developments such as the purchase of &quot;The Observer&quot;. His papers are held at the Guardian News &amp; Media Archive in London.

==The Hugo Young Lecture==
There is now an annual Hugo Young Lecture, organised by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in Young&#x27;s memory. Among the notable figures to have delivered it are David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband, Marjorie Scardino and Alex Salmond.

==Personal life==

Young married twice. His first wife, Helen Mason, died in 1989 of lung cancer. They had three daughters, including the film director Emily Young, and one son.

He remarried in 1990, this time to American artist Lucy Waring. Young died at the age of 64 of colon cancer, and was buried on the west side of Highgate Cemetery.

<text>In later Anglo-Saxon England, a thegn or thane (Latin minister) was an aristocrat who ranked at the third level in lay society, below the king and ealdormen. He had to be a substantial landowner. Thanage refers to the tenure by which lands were held by a thane as well as the rank; an approximately equivalent modern title may be that of baron.

The term &quot;thane&quot; was also used in early medieval Scandinavia for a class of retainers, and &quot;thane&quot; was a title given to local royal officials in medieval eastern Scotland, equivalent in rank to the child of an earl.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Thegn&quot; is only used once in the laws before the reign of King Æthelstan (924–939), but more frequently in charters. Apparently unconnected to the German and Dutch word &quot; &quot; (&#x27;to serve&#x27;), H. M. Chadwick suggests &quot;the sense of subordination must have been inherent... from the earliest time&quot;. It gradually expanded in meaning and use, to denote a member of a territorial nobility, while thegnhood was attainable by fulfilling certain conditions.

&quot;An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary&quot; describes a thane as &quot;one engaged in a king&#x27;s or a queen&#x27;s service, whether in the household or in the country&quot;. It adds: &quot;the word... seems gradually to acquire a technical meaning... denoting a class, containing several degrees&quot;.

== Origins ==
In the 5th century, Germanic peoples collectively known as Anglo-Saxons migrated to sub-Roman Britain and came to dominate the east and southeast of the island. Based on archaeological evidence (such as burials and buildings), these early communities appear to have lacked any social elite. Around half the population were free, independent farmers (Old English: ) who cultivated a hide of land (enough to provide for a family). Slaves, mostly native Britons, made up the other half.

By the late 6th century, the archeological evidence (grander burials and buildings) suggests the development of a social elite. This period coincided with the Late Antique Little Ice Age and the Plague of Justinian. These events would have caused famine and other societal disruptions that may have increased violence and led previously independent farmers to submit to the rule of strong lords. The Old English word for &quot;lord&quot; is ( or ).

The early law codes of Kent use the Old English word (, ) to describe a nobleman. By the 8th century, the word gesith (; Latin: ) had replaced as the common term for a nobleman. There were both land-owning and landless gesiths. A landless gesith would serve as a retainer in the of a king, queen, or lord. In return, they were provided protection (Old English: ) and gifts of gold and silver. Young nobles were raised with the children of kings to someday become their gesith. A gesith might be granted an estate in reward for loyal service.

By the 10th century, Anglo-Saxon society was divided into three main social classes: slaves, (), and (, ). &quot;Thegn&quot; (Old English: ) meant servant or warrior, and it replaced the term &quot;gesith&quot;. Law codes assigned a weregeld or man price of 200 shillings for a and 1,200s for a thegn.

== Ranks and functions ==
Thegns were divided into three ranks: ealdormen (later earl), king&#x27;s thegns, and median thegns. Below ealdormen were king&#x27;s thegns, so called because they only served the king. The lowest thegnly rank were the median thegns who owed service to other thegns. The higher a thegn&#x27;s rank, the greater the heriot he paid to the king. 

Thegns were the backbone of local government and the military. Sheriffs were drawn from this class, and thegns were required to attend the shire court and give judgment. For these reasons, historian David Carpenter described thegns as &quot;the country gentry of Anglo-Saxon England&quot;. Although their exact role is unclear, the twelve senior thegns of the hundred played a part in the development of the English system of justice. Under a law of Aethelred they &quot;seem to have acted as the judicial committee of the court for the purposes of accusation&quot;. This suggests some connection with the modern jury trial.

== Social mobility ==
Children inherited thegnly status from their father, and a thegnly woman who married a retained her noble status. A successful thegn might hope to be promoted to earl.

A prosperous could become a landlord in his own right and aspire to thegnly rank. In the legal tract &quot;Geþyncðo&quot;, Archbishop Wulfstan of York (1002–1023) detailed the criteria for attaining thegnhood: &quot;And if a prospered, that he possessed fully five hides of his own, a &quot;belhus&quot; and a &quot;burhgeat&quot; [a defensible manor house], a seat and special office in the king’s hall, then was he henceforth entitled to the rights of a thegn.&quot; The legal text &quot;Norðleoda laga&quot; () also included the five-hide qualification but added that the land had to be kept for three generations.

Thegnhood was also attainable to the merchant who &quot;fared thrice over the wide sea by his own means.&quot;

==Households==
A noble household included a number of retainers, termed (, ; from which the modern word &quot;knight&quot; derives) or (, ). Thegnly wills can be used to reconstruct noble households. Thurstan Lustwine&#x27;s will, written , left land to his and his two chaplains (who in addition to religious duties would also have performed secretarial work). The will of a noblewoman named Leofgifu left land to her three stewards, two reeves, a chaplain, and her . Another household officer identified in wills is that of huntsman ().

Just as king&#x27;s thegns served in the royal household, lesser thegns served as the seneschals, chamberlains, and stewards of king&#x27;s thegns and ealdormen. These were considered honourable posts rather than servile positions. Vagn, the leader of Earl Leofric&#x27;s housecarls, owned 54 hides of land with his main manor at Wootton Wawen (). High ranking men such as Vagn would have formed the inner circle of the lord&#x27;s household.

== Post-conquest England ==
In 1066, there were an estimated 5,000 thegns in England. After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, William the Conqueror replaced the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy with Normans, who replaced the previous terminology with their own names for such social ranks. Those previously known as thegns became part of the knightly class.

== Runestones ==

During the later part of the tenth and in the eleventh centuries in Denmark and Sweden, it became common for families or comrades to raise memorial runestones. Approximately fifty of these note that the deceased was a thegn. Examples of such runestones include Sö 170 at Nälberga, Vg 59 at Norra Härene, Vg 150 at Velanda, DR 143 at Gunderup, DR 209 at Glavendrup, and DR 277 at Rydsgård.

<text>Joseph Bosworth (1788 – 27 May 1876) was an English scholar of the Anglo-Saxon language and compiler of the first major Anglo-Saxon dictionary.

==Biography==
Born in Derbyshire in 1788, Bosworth was educated at Repton School as a &#x27;Poor Scholar&#x27; but left in his early teens and did not go to university. Despite the lack of a degree he somehow gained sufficient academic standing for the Church of England to allow him to become a priest. He became a curate in Bunny, Notts in 1814 and three years later became vicar of Little Horwood, Buckinghamshire. He was proficient in many European languages and made a particular study of Anglo-Saxon. This suggests that his years between leaving Repton and becoming a priest were spent working for someone whose own interests lay in these directions and who greatly encouraged Bosworth&#x27;s academic development. There is no proof as to who this was but possible candidates are Sharon Turner (1768-1847), a London solicitor turned researcher or Alexander Crombie (1762-1840), a Scottish-born philologist and proprietor of a school in London.

Bosworth was awarded an M.A. in 1822 by the University of Aberdeen on the recommendation of three other Buckinghamshire clergymen. In 1823, his &quot;Elements of Anglo-Saxon Grammar&quot; appeared, and he also matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge as a &#x27;ten-year man&#x27; (mature student). In July 1825 he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society, and in June 1829, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In 1829, Bosworth went to the Netherlands as a chaplain, first in Amsterdam and then in Rotterdam. In 1831, the degree of Ph.D. was conferred on him by the University of Leyden. Trinity College, Cambridge granted him the degree of B.D. in 1834 and D.D. in 1839. He remained in the Netherlands until 1840, working on his &quot;A Dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon Language&quot; (1838), his best-known work. Thomas Northcote Toller later compiled a new edition of the dictionary based on Bosworth&#x27;s work, both printed and in manuscript, and added a supplement (2 vols. 1898–1921). The University of Aberdeen granted him an LL.D. in 1838 on the recommendation of Alexander Crombie (see above) and Thomas Orger.

In 1858 Bosworth became Rector of Water Stratford, Buckinghamshire, and Rawlinsonian Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford. He gave £10,000 to the University of Cambridge in 1867 for the establishment of the professorship of Anglo-Saxon. He died on 27 May 1876 leaving behind him a mass of annotations on the Anglo-Saxon charters and was buried on 2 June 1876 in Water Stratford churchyard. Income from his estate was left to various relatives for their lifetimes but as they died it was added to the endowment of his Oxford professorship.

==Legacy==
Bosworth was succeeded by John Earle (1824–1903) and Arthur Sampson Napier (1853–1916). 
In 1916, the chair was renamed to Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon in honour of Bosworth and his endowment, the first &quot;Rawlinson and Bosworth&quot; professor being Sir William Alexander Craigie (1867–1957), who in 1925 moved to a post at the University of Chicago (in order to work on his &quot;Dictionary of American English&quot;) and was succeeded by J. R. R. Tolkien who held the post from 1925 to 1945.

<doc id="334448" wikidata="Q553900" url="?curid=334448" title="Richard Crashaw">
<text>Richard Crashaw (c. 1613 – 21 August 1649) was an English poet, teacher, High Church Anglican cleric and Roman Catholic convert, who was one of the major metaphysical poets in 17th-century English literature.

Crashaw was the son of a famous Anglican divine with Puritan beliefs, William Crashaw, who earned a reputation as a hard-hitting pamphleteer and polemicist against Catholicism. After his father&#x27;s death, Crashaw was educated at Charterhouse School and Pembroke College, Cambridge. After taking a degree, Crashaw taught as a fellow at Peterhouse, Cambridge and began to publish religious poetry that expressed a distinct mystical nature and an ardent Christian faith.

Crashaw was ordained as a clergyman in the Church of England and in his theology and practice embraced the High Church reforms of Archbishop Laud. Crashaw became infamous among English Puritans for his use of Christian art to decorate his church, for his devotion to the Virgin Mary, for his use of Catholic vestments, and 
for many other reasons. During these years, however, the University of Cambridge was a hotbed for High Church Anglicanism and for Royalist sympathies. Adherents of both positions were violently persecuted by Puritan forces during and after the English Civil War (1642–1651).

When Puritan General Oliver Cromwell seized control of the city in 1643, Crashaw was ejected from his parish and fellowship and became a refugee, first in France and then in the Papal States. He found employment as an attendant to Cardinal Giovanni Battista Maria Pallotta at Rome. While in exile he converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism. In April 1649, Cardinal Pallotta appointed Crashaw to a minor benefice as canon of the Shrine of the Holy House at Loreto where he died suddenly four months later.

Crashaw&#x27;s poetry, although often categorised with those of the contemporary English metaphysical poets, exhibits similarities with the Baroque poets and influenced in part by the works of Italian and Spanish mystics. It draws parallels &quot;between the physical beauties of nature and the spiritual significance of existence&quot;. His work is said to be marked by a focus toward &quot;love with the smaller graces of life and the profounder truths of religion, while he seems forever preoccupied with the secret architecture of things&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===

==== Parents ====

Richard Crashaw was born in London, England, circa 1612 or 1613. He was the only son of William Crashaw (1572–1626). The exact date of Richard Crawshaw&#x27;s birth and the name of his mother are unknown; it is believed that he was born either in late 1612 or in January 1613. His mother, William Crashaw&#x27;s first wife, may have died while he was an infant. William Crashaw&#x27;s second wife, Elizabeth Skinner, whom he married in 1619, died in 1620 in childbirth. Richard Crashaw may have been baptised by James Ussher, later the Archbishop of Armagh.

William Crashaw was a Cambridge-educated clergyman who served as a preacher at London&#x27;s Inner Temple. He was born in or near Handsworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and came from a wealthy family. William Crashaw wrote and published many pamphlets advocating Puritan theology that were sharply critical of Catholicism. Despite his opposition to Catholic thought, William Crashaw was attracted by Catholic devotion; he translated many verses by Catholic poets from Latin to English. According to Cornelius Clifford, William Crashaw was &quot;a man of unchallenged repute for learning in his day, an argumentative but eloquent preacher, strong in his Protestantism, and fierce in his denunciation of &#x27;Romish falsifications&#x27; and &#x27;besotted Jesuitries&#x27;&quot;.

===== Childhood =====
Scholars believe that as a child, Richard Crashaw read extensively from his father&#x27;s private library. It contained many Catholic works and was described as &quot;one of the finest private theological libraries of the time&quot;. The Crashaw library included works such as Bernard of Clairvaux″s &quot;Sermons on the Song of Songs&quot;, the life of Catherine of Siena, the &quot;Revelations&quot; of Saint Bridget, and the writings of Richard Rolle.

With the death of William Crashaw in 1626, Richard Crashaw became an orphan at 13 or 14 years old. English attorney general, Sir Henry Yelverton and Sir Ranulph Crewe, a prominent judge, were appointed as Crashaw&#x27;s legal guardians.

===Education===
==== Charterhouse School ====
Crashaw&#x27;s guardians sent him to the Charterhouse School in 1629. At Charterhouse, Crashaw was a pupil of the school&#x27;s headmaster, Robert Brooke. He required his students to write epigrams and verse in Greek and Latin based on the Epistle and Gospel readings from the day&#x27;s chapel services. Crashaw later continued this exercise as an undergraduate at Cambridge. Several years later, he assembled many these epigrams for his first collection of poems, &quot;Epigrammatum Sacrorum Liber&quot; (trans. &quot;A Book of Sacred Epigrams&quot;), published in 1634. After finishing at Charterhouse, Crashaw entered Pembroke Hall at the University of Cambridge

==== Pembroke Hall ====
According to clergyman and editor Alexander Grosart, Crashaw was &quot;as thoroughly Protestant, in all probability, as his father could have desired&quot; before his graduation from Pembroke Hall in 1634. During his education, Crashaw gravitated to the High Church tradition in Anglicanism, particularly towards the ideals and ritual practices that emphasised the church&#x27;s Catholic heritage. These practices were advocated by William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Laud, with the support of King Charles I, had reoriented the practices of the Church of England with a programme of reforms that sought &quot;beauty in holiness&quot;. Laud sought to incorporate &quot;more reverence and decorum in church ceremonial and service, in the decoration of churches, and in the elaboration of the ritual&quot;. This movement, called Laudianism, rose out of the influence of the Counter-Reformation. The University of Cambridge was a centre of the Laudian movement at the time of Crashaw&#x27;s attendance.

Richard Crashaw matriculated as a scholar at Pembroke on 26 March 1632. At that time, the college&#x27;s master was the Reverend Benjamin Lany, an Anglican clergyman and friend of William Crashaw. Early in his career, Lany shared many of William Crashaw&#x27;s Puritan beliefs. However, Lany&#x27;s beliefs evolved toward more High Church practices. It is likely that Richard Crashaw was under Lany&#x27;s influence while at Pembroke. Crashaw was acquainted with Nicholas Ferrar and participated in his Little Gidding community, a family religious group. Little Gidding was noted for its adherence to High Church rituals centred around Ferrar&#x27;s model of a humble spiritual life of devoted to prayer and eschewing material, worldly life. Little Gidding was criticised by its Puritan detractors as a &quot;Protestant Nunnery&quot;.

Pembroke Hall conferred on Crashaw a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1634. This degree was promoted to a Master of Arts in 1638 by Cambridge, and through incorporation &quot;ad eundem gradum&quot; by the University of Oxford in 1641.

===High Churchman and Cambridge fellow===

==== Curate in Cambridge ====

In 1636, Crashaw was elected a Fellow of Peterhouse at Cambridge. In 1638, he was ordained into the priesthood of the Church of England, and was installed as curate of the Church of St Mary the Less in Cambridge, England This church, commonly known as &quot;Little St Mary&#x27;s&quot;, is adjacent to Peterhouse and had served as the college chapel until 1632.

Peterhouse&#x27;s Master, John Cosin, and many of the college&#x27;s Fellows, adhered to Laudianism and embraced the Anglican tradition&#x27;s Catholic heritage. Crashaw became close to the Ferrar family and frequently visited Little Gidding. Crashaw incorporated these influences into his conduct at St Mary the Less. These changes included holding late-night prayer vigils, and adorning the chapel with relics, crucifixes, and images of Mary, mother of Jesus. According to an early Crashaw biographer, David Lloyd, Crashaw attracted many attendees to Little St Mary&#x27;s who were eager to hear his sermons, &quot;that ravished more like Poems, than both the Poet and Saint... scattering not so much Sentences as Extasies&quot;.

Because of the tensions between Laudian adherents and their Puritan detractors, the Puritans often sent spies to attend church services to identify and gather evidence of &quot;superstitious&quot; or &quot;Popish&quot; idolatry. In 1641, Crashaw was cited for Mariolatry (excessive devotion to the Virgin Mary) and for his superstitious practices of &quot;diverse bowings, cringeings&quot; and incensing before the altar&quot;.

==== English Revolution ====
In 1643, Cromwell&#x27;s forces took control of Cambridge and immediately began to crack down on Catholic influences. Crashaw was forced to resign his fellowship at Peterhouse for refusing to sign the Solemn League and Covenant. He soon decided to leave England, accompanied by Mary Collet, whom he revered as his &quot;gratious mother&quot;. He arranged for Mary&#x27;s son, Collete Ferrer, to take over his fellowship at Peterhouse. Soon after Crashaw left Cambridge, St Mary&#x27;s was ransacked on 29 and 30 December 1643 by William Dowsing under orders from the Parliamentarian commanders. Dowsing recording that at Little St Mary&#x27;s &quot;we brake downe 60 superstitious pictures, some popes, and crucifixes, and God the Father sitting in a chayer, and holding a globe in his hand&quot;.

Crashaw&#x27;s poetry took on decidedly Catholic imagery, especially in his poems about Spanish mystic St Teresa of Avila. Teresa&#x27;s writings were unknown in England and unavailable in English. However, Crashaw had been exposed to her work, and the three poems he wrote in her honor—&quot;A Hymn to Sainte Teresa,&quot; &quot;An Apologie for the fore-going Hymne,&quot; and &quot;The Flaming Heart&quot;— are, arguably, his most sublime works.

Crashaw began writing poems influenced by the George Herbert&#x27;s collection &quot;The Temple&quot;—an influence likely derived from Herbert&#x27;s connection to Nicholas Ferrar. Several of these poems Crashaw later collected in a series titled &quot;Steps to the Temple&quot; and &quot;The Delights of the Muses&quot; by an anonymous friend and published in one volume in 1646. This collection included Crashaw&#x27;s translation of Giambattista Marini″s &quot;Sospetto d&#x27;Herode&quot;. In his preface, the collection&#x27;s anonymous editor described the poems as having the potential to induce a considerable effect on the reader—it would &quot;lift thee Reader, some yards above the ground.&quot; According to contemporary accounts, Crashaw&#x27;s sermons on this subject were powerful and well-attended, but no records of them exist today.

===Exile, conversion, and death===

==== Conversion to Catholicism ====

In 1644, Crashaw and Collet settled in Leiden in the Netherlands. It is believed that he converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism at this time. According to the &quot;Athanae Oxoniensis&quot; (1692), antiquarian Anthony à Wood explains the reasoning for Crashaw&#x27;s conversion as the result of fearing the destruction of his beloved religion by the Puritans: &quot;an infallible foresight that the Church of England would be quite ruined by the unlimited fury of the Presbyterians&quot;. However, according to Husain,

At some point in 1645, Crashaw appeared in Paris, where he encountered Reverend Thomas Car a confessor to English refugees. The poet&#x27;s vagrant existence made a lasting impression on Car, as shown by &quot;The Anagramme&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;He seeks no downes, no sheetes, his bed&#x27;s still made.
If he can find a chaire or stoole, he&#x27;s layd,
When day peepes in, he quitts his restlesse rest.
And still, poore soule, before he&#x27;s up he&#x27;s dres&#x27;t.&lt;/poem&gt;

==== Final years ====
The writer Abraham Cowley discovered Crashaw living in abject poverty in Paris. Cowley sought help from English Queen Henrietta Maria, herself in exile in France, to help Crashaw secure a position in Rome. Crashaw&#x27;s friend and patron, Susan Feilding, Countess of Denbigh, also lobbied the Queen to recommend Crashaw to Pope Innocent X.

Crashaw travelled as a pilgrim to Rome in November 1646. He lived there in poor health and poverty while waiting for a papal retainer. Crashaw was finally introduced to Innocent X, being called &quot;the learned son of a famous Heretic&quot;. According to Sabine, the Puritans who forced Crashaw into exile would have described him also as the heretical son of a learned performer. After repeated lobbying by the Queen, Innocent X finally granted Crashaw in 1647 a post with Cardinal Giovanni Battista Maria Pallotta, who was closely associated with the English College, a seminary in Rome. Crashaw was allowed to reside at the college.

At the college, Crashaw witnessed immoral behaviour from some of Pallotta&#x27;s entourage and reported them to the Cardinal. This action created such bitter enemies for Crashaw that Pallotta eventually removed him from the college for his own safety. In April 1649, Pallotta found a cathedral benefice for Crashaw at the Basilica della Santa Casa at Loreto, Marche. Crashaw left for Loreto in May 1649.

Weakened by years of privatation, Crashaw died in Loreto of a fever on 21 August 1649. There were suspicions that Crashaw was poisoned, possibly by his enemies in Pallotta&#x27;s entourage. Crashaw was buried in the lady chapel of the shrine at Loreto.

==Poetry==
===Writing and publication history===
Three collections of Crashaw&#x27;s poetry were published during his lifetime and one small volume posthumously—three years after his death. The posthumous collection, &quot;Carmen Del Nostro&quot;, included 33 poems.

For his first collection of poems, Crashaw turned to the epigrams composed during his schooling, assembling these efforts to form the core of his first book, &quot;Epigrammatum Sacrorum Liber&quot; (trans. &quot;A Book of Sacred Epigrams&quot;), published in 1634. Among its well-known lines is Crashaw&#x27;s observation on the miracle of turning water into wine (): &quot;Nympha pudica Deum vidit, et erubuit&quot;, believed to be translated by Crashaw himself as: &quot;The conscious water saw its God and blushed&quot;.

For instance, this quatrain, titled &quot;Dominus apud suos vilis&quot; from the collection, was based on a passage from the Gospel of Luke:
Crashaw&#x27;s epigram (1634)
: III.
: &quot;En consanguinei! Patriis en exul in oris&quot;
: &quot;Christus! et haud alibi tam peregrinus erat.&quot;
: &quot;Qui socio demum pendebat sanguine latro,&quot;
: &quot;O consanguineus quam fuit ille magis.&quot;

Clement Barksdale&#x27;s translation (1873)
: III.
: See, O Kinsman, what strange thing is this!
: Christ in&#x27;s own country a great stranger is.
: The thief which bled upon the Cross with Thee
: Was more ally&#x27;d in consanguinity.

A literal translation
: III.
: Behold kinsmen! He who was an exile in his homeland—
: The Christ, who was as a stranger there and not so elsewhere.
: He, the thief who bled at the end, hanging with him—
: Oh!—he was closer a blood relation.
===Themes===

Crashaw&#x27;s work has as its focus the devotional pursuit of divine love. According to literary historian Maureen Sabine, his poems &quot;reveal new springs of tenderness as he became absorbed in a Laudian theology of love, in the religious philanthropy practiced by his Pembroke master, Benjamin Laney, and preached by his tutor, John Tournay, and in the passionate poetic study of the Virgin Mother and Christ Child&quot;. Sabine asserts that as a result of his Marian devotion and Catholic sensibilities, &quot;In expressing his Christian love for all men, even the archenemy of his father and most English Protestants, Crashaw began to feel what it was like for Christ to be a stranger in his own land.&quot; He depicts women, most notably the Virgin Mary, but also Teresa and Mary Magdalene, as the embodiment of virtue, purity and salvation. Indeed, Crashaw&#x27;s three poems in honour of the Saint Teresa of Avila--&quot;A Hymn to Sainte Teresa,&quot; &quot;An Apologie for the fore-going Hymne,&quot; and &quot;The Flaming Heart&quot; are considered his most sublime works.

According to Sabine, &quot;In his finest contemplative verse, he would reach out from the evening stillness of the sanctuary to an embattled world that was deaf to the soothing sound of Jesus, the name which, to his mind, cradled the cosmos.&quot;According to Husain, Crashaw is not a mystic—and not by traditional definitions of mysticism—he is simply a devotee who had a mystic temperament because he &quot;often appears to us as an ecstatic poet writing about the mystical experiences of a great saint (St. Teresa) rather than conveying the richness of his own mystical experience&quot;. Husain continued to categorise Crashaw&#x27;s poems into four topic areas: 
While Crashaw is categorised as one of the metaphysical poets, his poetry differs from those of the other metaphysical poets by its cosmopolitan and continental influences. As a result of this eclectic mix of influences, Sabine states that Crashaw is usually &quot;regarded as the incongruous younger brother of the Metaphysicals who weakens the &#x27;strong line&#x27; of their verse or the prodigal son who &#x27;took his journey into a far country&#x27;, namely the Continent and Catholicism.&quot; Lorraine M. Roberts writes Crashaw &quot;happily set out to follow in the steps of George Herbert&quot; with the influence of &quot;The Temple&quot; (1633), and that &quot;confidence in God&#x27;s love prevails in his poetry and marks his voice as distinctly different from that of Donne in relation to sin and death and from that of Herbert in his struggle to submit his will to that of God.&quot;

===Critical reception===
Much of the negative criticism of Crashaw&#x27;s work stems from an anti-Catholic sentiment in English letters—especially among critics who claim that his verse suffered as a result of his religious conversion. Conversely, the Protestant poet Abraham Cowley memorialised Crashaw in an elegy, expressing a conciliatory opinion of Crashaw&#x27;s Catholic character.

Today, Crashaw&#x27;s work is largely unknown and unread— if he is not the &quot;most important&quot; he is certainly one of the most distinguished of the metaphysical poets. Crashaw&#x27;s poetry has inspired or directly influenced the work of many poets in his own day, and throughout the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries.

According to literary scholars Lorraine Roberts and John Roberts, &quot;those critics who expressed appreciation for Crashaw&#x27;s poetry were primarily impressed not with its thought, but with its music and what they called &#x27;tenderness and sweetness of language&#x27;&quot;—including a roster of writers such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Amy Lowell, and A. Bronson Alcott. During and after his life, friends and poets esteemed Crashaw as a saint—Abraham Cowley called him such in his elegy &quot;On the Death of Mr. Crashaw&quot; (1656); and Sir John Beaumont&#x27;s poem &quot;Psyche&quot; (1648) compares Crashaw with fourth-century poet and saint Gregory of Nazianzen. Others referred to him in comparison with George Herbert, as &quot;the other Herbert&quot; or &quot;the second Herbert of our late times&quot;.

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;His faith, perhaps, in some nice tenets might
Be wrong; his life, I&#x27;m sure, was in the right:
And I, myself, a Catholic will be,
So far at least, dear saint, to pray to thee&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

===Later plagiarism===
Alexander Pope judged Crashaw &quot;a worse sort of Cowley&quot;, adding that &quot;Herbert is lower than Crashaw, Sir John Beaumont higher, and Donne, a good deal so.&quot; Pope first identified the influence of Italian poets Petrarch and Marino on Crashaw, which he criticised as yielding thoughts &quot;oftentimes far fetch&#x27;d and strain&#x27;d&quot;, but that one could &quot;skim off the froth&quot; to get to Crashaw&#x27;s &quot;own natural middle-way&quot;. However, contemporary critics were quick to point out that Pope owed Crashaw a debt and in several instances, plagiarised from him. In 1785, Peregrine Philips disparaged those who borrowed from and imitated Crashaw without giving proper acknowledgement—singling out Pope, John Milton, Young, and Gray—saying that they &quot;dress themselves in his borrowed robes&quot; Early 20th-century literary critic Austin Warren identified that Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; borrowed heavily from Crashaw&#x27;s style and translation of &quot;Sospetto d&#x27;Herode.

In a 1751 edition of in &quot;The Rambler&quot;, critic Samuel Johnson called attention to a direct example of Pope&#x27;s plagiaristic borrowing from Crashaw:

Crashaw&#x27;s verse:

: —This plain floor,
: Believe me, reader, can say more
: Than many a braver marble can,
: Here lies a truly honest man

Pope&#x27;s plagiarized verse:

: This modest stone, what few vain marbles can,
: May truly say, Here lies an honest man.
===Musical settings===
Crashaw&#x27;s verse has been set by or inspired musical compositions. Elliott Carter (1908–2012) was inspired by Crashaw&#x27;s Latin poem &quot;Bulla&quot; (&quot;Bubble&quot;) to compose his three-movement orchestral work &quot;&quot; (1993–1996). The festival anthem &quot;Lo, the full, final sacrifice&quot;, Op. 26, composed in 1946 by British composer Gerald Finzi (1901–1956) is a setting of two Crashaw poems, &quot;Adoro Te&quot; and &quot;Lauda Sion Salvatorem&quot;—translations by Crashaw of two Latin hymns by Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225–1274). &quot;Come and let us live&quot;, a translation by Crashaw of a poem by Roman poet Catullus (84–54 BC), was set to music as a four-part choral glee by Samuel Webbe, Jr. (1770–1843). Crashaw&#x27;s &quot;Come Love, Come Lord&quot; was set to music by Ralph Vaughan Williams. Excerpts from &quot;In the Holy Nativity of our Lord&quot; were set by American composer Alf Houkom (b. 1935) as part of his &quot;A Christmas Meditation&quot; (1986, rev. 2018) for SATB choir, synthesizer and piano. &quot;A Hymn of the Nativity&quot; was set as &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Hymn&quot; by American composer Timothy Hoekman in his 1992 set of three songs entitled &quot;The Nativity&quot; for soprano and orchestra.

<doc id="334451" wikidata="Q1232165" url="?curid=334451" title="William Le Queux">
<text>William Tufnell Le Queux ( , ; 2 July 1864 – 13 October 1927) was an Anglo-French journalist and writer. He was also a diplomat (honorary consul for San Marino), a traveller (in Europe, the Balkans and North Africa), a flying buff who officiated at the first British air meeting at Doncaster in 1909, and a wireless pioneer who broadcast music from his own station long before radio was generally available; his claims regarding his own abilities and exploits, however, were usually exaggerated. His best-known works are the anti-French and anti-Russian invasion fantasy &quot;The Great War in England in 1897&quot; (1894) and the anti-German invasion fantasy &quot;The Invasion of 1910&quot; (1906), the latter becoming a bestseller.

==Early life==
Le Queux was born in London. His father was a French draper&#x27;s assistant and his mother was English. He studied art under Ignazio (or Ignace) Spiridon in Paris. He carried out a foot tour of Europe as a young man before supporting himself writing for French newspapers. In the late 1880s he returned to London where he edited the magazines &quot;Gossip&quot; and &quot;Piccadilly&quot; before joining the staff of &quot;The Globe&quot; as a parliamentary reporter in 1891. In 1893 he abandoned journalism to concentrate on writing and travelling.

His partial French ancestry did not prevent him from depicting France and the French as the villains in works of the 1890s, though later he assigned this role to Germany.

==Career==
Le Queux mainly wrote in the genres of Romance, mystery, thriller, and espionage, particularly in the years leading up to World War I, when his partnership with British publishing magnate Lord Northcliffe led to the serialised publication and intensive publicising (including actors dressed as German soldiers walking along Regent Street) of pulp-fiction spy stories and invasion literature such as &quot;The Invasion of 1910,&quot; &quot;The Poisoned Bullet,&quot; and &quot;Spies of the Kaiser.&quot; These works were a common phenomenon in pre-World War I Europe, involving fictionalised stories of possible invasion or infiltration by foreign powers; Le Queux&#x27;s specialty, much appreciated by Northcliffe, was the German invasion of Britain. He was also the original editor of Lord Northcliffe&#x27;s &quot;War of the Nations&quot;.

=== &quot;The Parker Expedition&quot; ===
In 1908 Johan Millen approached William Le Queux about finding funding for what later became known as the Parker Expedition to Jerusalem. Le Queux wrote about it in his autobiography &quot;Things I Know about Kings, Celebrities and Crooks&quot; (1923). He wrote One day, during the five years I lived at the Hotel Cecil, a waiter brought me a card bearing the name of Broström, with an address in Stockholm. A tall, middle-aged, clean-shaven Swede was ushered in, and handed me a letter of introduction from a friend, a certain Baroness Nernberg, who is one of the leaders of Society in the Swedish capital. This letter explained that my visitor was a well-known civil engineer in Sweden, that he was highly trustworthy, and that he had a very curious disclosure to make to me. We sat down, and certainly what he told me caused my eyes to bulge. Briefly, it was that a friend of his, a certain Professor Afzelius (sic), at Abó University, had discovered in the original text of the Book of Ezekiel preserved in the Imperial Library at Petrograd a cipher message that gave the whereabouts of the concealed treasures from King Solomon&#x27;s temple. The individual he calls Afzelius was in fact Valter Juvelius. After he was approached Le Queux says that he took the papers to a Dr Adler, a friend who was also the Chief Rabbi, to verify the documents. Le Queux says that Adler came back and said that there was something to the documents. 

On the basis of the positive response to the cypher documents Le Queux approached Sir C. Arthur Pearson, the proprietor of the Standard newspaper for funding for the expedition to Jerusalem. He described what happened next:To this he most generously acceded, and an initial sum was agreed between us for its cost. I was to head the expedition to Palestine. That afternoon I walked along the Strand full of suppressed excitement.When Le Queux informed Millen that he had secured the funding Millen told him that they were not pursuing the matter. This was because they had decided to move forward with the syndicate led by Montagu Parker. However, he did not tell Le Queux this and he was left bemused. 

The author was not completely frustrated as it gave him the idea for a novel, &quot;The Treasure of Israel&quot; (known as &quot;The Great God Gold&quot; in the US), which was another international bestseller for him. In it he took much of the cypher information that Millen had given him and then added many of the elements from his earlier work &quot;The Tickencote Treasure&quot;.

===&quot;The Invasion of 1910&quot;===
&quot;The Invasion of 1910&quot;, which originally appeared in serial form in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper from 19 March 1906, was a huge success. The newspaper&#x27;s circulation increased greatly, and it made a small fortune for Le Queux, eventually being translated into twenty-seven languages and selling over one million copies in book form. The idea for the novel is alleged to have originated from Field Marshal Earl Roberts, who regularly lectured English schoolboys on the need to prepare for war. He was a member of Legion of Frontiersmen. Le Queux was reportedly less than happy about an abridged German translation (with an altered ending) appeared the same year: &quot;Die Invasion von 1910: Einfall der Deutschen in England&quot; translated by Traugott Tamm.

In 1914, the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation produced &quot;The Raid of 1915&quot; an updated version of &quot;The Invasion of 1910&quot;, that was the first British film to feature German spies and invaders. Prior to the commencement of the Great War, the film was banned by the British Board of Film Censors, founded just one month earlier. The film was released in October 1914, retitled &quot;If England were Invaded&quot;.

===World War I===
At the beginning of World War I Le Queux became convinced that the Germans were out to get him for &quot;rumbling their schemes&quot; and requested special protection from German agents, leading to a continual struggle with the Metropolitan Police both at his local Sunbury station and through correspondence with its headquarters at New Scotland Yard. The authorities, however, in the words of Edward Henry (head of the Metropolitan Police) saw him as &quot;not a person to be taken seriously&quot; and saw no need to fulfill his request.

===Radio work===
Le Queux was interested in radio communication; he was a member of the Institute of Radio Engineers and carried out some radio experiments in 1924 in Switzerland with Dr. Petit Pierre and Max Amstutz. That same year he was elected the first President of the Hastings, St. Leonard&#x27;s and District Radio Society, whose inaugural lecture was delivered on 28 April 1924 by John Logie Baird. Le Queux was eager to help Baird with his television experiments but said that all his money was tied up in Switzerland. He did however write an article, &quot;Television-a fact&quot; which appeared in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; in April 1924 which praised Baird&#x27;s efforts.

===Cinema===
In addition to his providing the story of &quot;The Raid of 1915&quot;, he also wrote the films &quot;The White Lie&quot; (1914) and &quot;The Sons of Satan&quot; (19i5); he also wrote and co-directed &quot;Sadounah&quot; (1915).

===Other work===
Apart from fiction, Le Queux also wrote extensively on wireless broadcasting, produced various travel works including &quot;An Observer in the Near East&quot; and several short books on Switzerland, and wrote an unrevealing and often misleading autobiography, &quot;Things I Know about Kings, Celebrities and Crooks&quot; (1923). The latter contains, among other fantastic stories, the claim by Le Queux that he saw a manuscript in French written by Rasputin stating that Jack the Ripper was a Russian doctor named Alexander Pedachenko who committed the murders to confuse and ridicule Scotland Yard.

==Bibliography==
Le Queux wrote 150 novels dealing with international intrigue, as well as books warning of Britain&#x27;s vulnerability to European invasion before World War I:

<doc id="334456" wikidata="Q2287723" url="?curid=334456" title="Simon Muzenda">
<text>Simon Vengai Muzenda (28 October 1922 – 20 September 2003) was a Zimbabwean politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister from 1980 to 1987 and as Vice-President of Zimbabwe from 1987 to 2003 under President Robert Mugabe.

== Early life and education ==
Muzenda was born in October 1922 in Gutu District of the Victoria Province of Southern Rhodesia as a son of peasant farmers; Theresa Muchapedzei Chekasi and Muzenda Chekesai Murefu. Muzenda was brought up by his grandmother Mbuya Maweni, who ensured his regular attendance for his primary education at Nyamandi Primary School.

==Life and career==
A relatively bright child, he was sent for teacher training after spending his teenage years herding in Makonese Village under Chief Nyamandi, and, following the advice of his tutor, travelled to the Marianhill mission in Natal, South Africa, where he showed proficiency in carpentry.

Between completing his carpentry course and furthering his studies, Muzenda became aware of politics during contacts with fellow students, which included several men prominent in black activism South Africa and Rhodesia; after his return to Rhodesia in 1950, he worked in a furniture factory in Bulawayo and became involved with Benjamin Burombo, an activist who was among the earliest to challenge discriminatory laws.

After marrying his wife Maud, a nurse, Muzenda moved to the Midlands town of Mvuma in 1955 and started his own carpentry business; he also stayed active in political activism and eventually become administrative secretary of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), attracting the attention of Rhodesian security forces and being imprisoned in Salisbury Central Prison for two years, which he described as a &quot;place of study&quot; later in his life, as it gave him and his fellow inmates the opportunity to complete their educations.

In 1964, he was arrested again, this time for possession of a pistol after having been elected deputy organising secretary of ZANU; at this time, Muzenda had become convinced that the only way to overthrow white colonial dominance was an armed revolution, and began organising young blacks to receive military training in other African countries, in the Soviet Union and in China. He was soon imprisoned again and remained in jail until being released under the Anglo-Rhodesia agreement in 1971.

Following his release, Simon Muzenda went into exile in Zambia, and later in Mozambique. Failing to draw Joshua Nkomo and his ZAPU movement into a unified political front, he backed Robert Mugabe, who was then also hiding in Mozambique, as the leader of the ZANU Patriotic Front (PF).

After the ensuing guerilla war, which ended with the Lancaster House Agreement, and a brief interregnum of British government while new elections were organised, Mugabe was elected as the first prime minister of the new independent Zimbabwe and made Muzenda the deputy prime minister and foreign minister in 1980; Muzenda also retained political power over his home area. In 1987, when Mugabe became executive president, Muzenda was appointed as his vice-president.

In Zimbabwe&#x27;s early years, Muzenda was generally respected by the people as a no-nonsense, plain-spoken man from the working class, but in later years, he appeared more and more crude. In 1990, his campaign for a seat in Zimbabwe&#x27;s parliament suffered a blow after opposition candidate Patrick Kombayi was shot and left permanently disabled; two state agents were convicted of attempted murder, but pardoned by Mugabe shortly after the trial ended, and even though Muzenda was not publicly accused of being involved in the shooting, it affected his standing with the public.

During the years of Mugabe&#x27;s rule, Muzenda always gave unreserved backing to the president, even when the regime began muzzling the independent press, curb the activities of foreign correspondents and crushing political opposition. He also participated in Mugabe&#x27;s land redistribution programme, taking over the Chindito farm, south of Harare, in April 2002 and ejecting the white farm owner, Chris Nel; this incident caused a controversy with the Commercial Farmers Union. In addition, he was put on the United States sanctions list in 2003 and remained on the list until his death.

==Death==
In the two years preceding his death, Muzenda was in failing health, with problems including hypertension and diabetes; after returning from medical treatment in China in July 2003, he was admitted to the coronary care unit of Harare&#x27;s main government facility, the Parirenyatwa Hospital, where, according to medical sources, he fell into a semi-conscious state. Two weeks before his death, Zimbabwe&#x27;s state-owned media dismissed reports that he was in declining health, instead announcing that he was making &quot;remarkable progress&quot; towards a full recovery. Muzenda died on 20 September 2003; he was 80 years old. He was survived by a wife and six children. He had a State funeral, and he is buried at the National Heroes&#x27; Acre.

<text>The Wetterhorn (3,690 m) is a peak in the Swiss Alps towering above the village of Grindelwald. Formerly known as Hasle Jungfrau, it is one of three summits on a mountain named the &quot;Wetterhörner&quot;, the highest of which is the Mittelhorn (3,702 m) and the lowest and most distant the Rosenhorn (3,689 m). The latter peaks are mostly hidden from view from Grindelwald.

The Grosse Scheidegg Pass crosses the col to the north, between the Wetterhorn and the Schwarzhorn.

==Ascents==
The Wetterhorn summit was first reached on August 31, 1844, by the Grindelwald guides Hans Jaun and Melchior Bannholzer, three days after they had co-guided a large party organized by the geologist Édouard Desor to the first ascent of the Rosenhorn. The Mittelhorn was first summitted on 9 July 1845 by the same guides, this time accompanied by a third, Kaspar Abplanalp, and by British climber Stanhope Templeman Speer. The son of a Scottish physician, Speer lived in Interlaken, Switzerland.

A September 1854 summit ascent by a party that included Alfred Wills, who apparently believed he&#x27;d made the first ascent, was much celebrated in Great Britain. Wills&#x27; description of this trip in his book &quot;Wanderings Among the High Alps&quot; (published in 1856) helped make mountaineering fashionable in Britain and ushered in the so-called golden age of alpinism, the systematic exploration of the Alps by British mountaineers. Despite several by then well-documented earlier ascents and the fact that he was guided to the top, Willis was lauded in his 1912 obituary as &quot;Certainly the first who can be said with any confidence to have stood upon the real highest peak of the Wetterhorn proper&quot; (i.e. the 3,692 m summit) In a subsequent corrigendum, the editors admitted two earlier ascents, but considered his still &quot;the first completely successful&quot; one.

In 1866, Lucy Walker was the first documented female to summit the peak.

The 24-year-old English mountaineer William Penhall and his Meiringen guide Andreas Maurer were killed by an avalanche high on the Wetterhorn on 3 August 1882.

The famed guide and Grindelwald native Christian Almer climbed the mountain many times in his life, including on his first of many trips with Meta Brevoort and her nephew W. A. B. Coolidge in 1868. His last ascent was in 1896 at the age of 74 together with his 75-year-old wife Margaritha (&quot;Gritli&quot;) to celebrate their golden anniversary on the summit.

Winston Churchill climbed the Wetterhorn in 1894.

==Aerial tramway==

The Wetterhorn summit was the intended terminal for the world&#x27;s first passenger-carrying aerial tramway, but only the first quarter was built. It was in operation until the beginning of World War I.

<doc id="334462" wikidata="Q335604" url="?curid=334462" title="Mago Barca">
<text>Mago Barca (; died 202 BC) was a Carthaginian, member of the Barcid family, who played an important role in the Second Punic War, leading forces of Carthage against the Roman Republic in Iberia and northern and central Italy. Mago was the third son of Hamilcar Barca, was the brother of Hannibal and Hasdrubal, and was the brother-in-law of Hasdrubal the Fair.

Little is known about his early years, except that, unlike his brothers, he is not mentioned during the ambush in which his father was killed in 228 BC.

== Name ==

The name &quot;Mago(n)&quot; was a common masculine given name among the Carthaginian elite. It meant &quot;Godsent&quot;.

The cognomen or epithet  means &quot;thunderbolt&quot; or &quot;shining&quot;. It is cognate with the Arabic name Barq and the Hebrew name Barak and equivalent to the Greek &quot;Keraunos&quot;, which was borne by contemporary commanders. It had been used for Mago&#x27;s father Hamilcar and is used to distinguish his three sons from others who shared their names.

==On the Italian Peninsula==
Hannibal included Mago among the Carthaginian officers who accompanied him to the Italian Peninsula. Among them were Maharbal, Hanno the Elder, Muttines (, ) and Carthalo.

Mago fought at the side of Hannibal in the invasion of Italy, and played a key role in many battles. At the Battle of the Trebia, he commanded the detachment that ambushed the Romans, breaking down their battle array. After the battle, Mago commanded the rearguard of the Carthaginian column as it marched south towards Latium through the marshes of Aino. In the Battle of Cannae, Mago and Hannibal took position with the Gallic infantry at the center, in the most vulnerable and crucial position of the formation.

After the victory of Cannae, Hannibal sent Mago with a detachment to Bruttium (southern Italy). While marching through Lucania and Bruttium, Mago subdued several towns and brought over several to the Carthaginian side. From Bruttium, Mago sailed to Carthage, leaving Hanno the Elder in command of the Carthaginian garrison. Mago presented the golden rings of Roman equites fallen at Cannae to the Carthaginian Senate, requesting reinforcements for Hannibal at the end of his speech. This prompted the supporters of the Barcid party in the Senate to taunt their opponents, who had bitterly opposed any aid to Hannibal. In response, Hanno the Great, leading opponent of the Barcids, placed several questions to Mago, which took most of the gloss off Mago&#x27;s presentation. Still, the Senate members were impressed enough to vote sending 4,000 Numidian cavalry, 40 war elephants and 500 talents to Italy, and Mago was instructed to raise additional 20,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry from Spain for Hannibal. Mago&#x27;s army, numbering 12,000 infantry, 1,500 cavalry, 20 war elephants, with 1,000 talents was raised slowly, perhaps due to anti Barcid intrigues.

However, when the news of the disastrous Battle of Dertosa reached Carthage, Mago and his army were sent to Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula) as reinforcements for Hasdrubal instead. But the Carthaginian Senate did not entirely ignore the Italian front for once. The force of 4,000 Numidian cavalry and 40 war elephants was sent to Locri in Bruttium, escorted by the Punic fleet under Bomilcar. These were the only significant reinforcements Hannibal was to receive from his government.

==Iberian campaigns==
Although Hasdrubal nominally commanded all Carthaginian forces in the Iberian Peninsula (the Roman Hispania), Mago received an independent command, a division that was to have grave consequences later. The two Barca brothers, aided by Hasdrubal Gisco, battled the Romans under the command of the Scipio brothers (Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus and Publius Cornelius Scipio) throughout 215–212 BC. Mago, in a cavalry ambush of Publius Cornelius Scipio, killed 2,000 Romans near Akra Leuke in 214 BC, and also aided in keeping the Hispanic tribes loyal to Carthage. On the whole, the Carthaginians managed to maintain the balance of power in Hispania despite the efforts of the Scipios, but failed to send any aid to Hannibal. The situation was favorable enough, as in 212 BC, Hasdrubal managed to cross over to Africa with an army to crush the rebellion of Syphax, king of Numidian tribes, without the Scipios causing any disruptions in Hispania. Mago and Hasdrubal Gisco guarded the Carthaginian possessions in Iberia without difficulty, despite the Scipios outnumbering their armies during the absence of Hasdrubal.

The Scipio brothers launched a major offensive in 211 BC. The Carthaginian armies were separated, Hasdrubal Gisco being near Gades (modern Cádiz) with 10,000 troops, Mago near Castulo with another 10,000, and Hasdrubal near Amtorgis with 15,000 soldiers. The Scipios planned to confront the Carthaginians simultaneously and comprehensively destroy their armies.

The coordination of the three Carthaginian armies was crucial in defeating and killing the Scipio brothers and destroying most of the Roman forces in Hispania in the battles that followed. The Scipios had split their army—Publius Scipio marching west with 20,000 soldiers to attack Mago near Castulo, while Gnaeus Scipio took 35,000 to attack Hasdrubal. Hasdrubal Gisco&#x27;s force marched to join Mago who, aided by Indibilis and Masinissa, defeated and killed Publius Scipio, then with the combined armies joined Hasdrubal to defeat and kill Gnaeus Scipio, all in a span of 23 days. However, the lack of coordination after the battle led to the escape of the Roman survivors, about 8,000 men, to the north of the Ebro river. These men checked Carthaginian attacks twice, and were reinforced by 20,000 troops from Italy in 210 BC.

Publius Cornelius Scipio the Younger, exploiting the lack of coordination between the Carthaginian generals, and the scattered location of their armies, ended up taking Cartagena in a daring expedition in 209 BC. Mago and his army was three days&#x27; march from Cartagena at that time. The Carthaginians moved their base to Gades.

In 208 BC, after the Battle of Baecula, Hasdrubal left Hispania to invade Italy and bring reinforcements to his brother Hannibal, who was operating in Lucania. Mago moved with his army to the area between the Tagus and Douro rivers in a recruiting mission of Spanish mercenaries with Hanno, a newly arrived general. Their mission was successful, as they gathered large masses of Spanish fighters, among them Cantabrians led by Larus, but they divided the army into two camps and relaxed their vigilance. Their army was surprised and scattered by Roman forces commanded by Marcus Junius Silanus in 207 BC; Hanno was captured, but Mago managed to lead a few thousand survivors to Gades, where he joined forces with Hasdrubal Gisco. The Carthaginians dispersed their army in several towns and focused on recruiting new mercenaries. This tactic frustrated the strategy of Scipio to force a decisive battle that year.

Mago enjoyed joint command of the new army and raided the Roman army with his cavalry. The foresight of Scipio Africanus, who had kept his cavalry outside camp in a hidden position, led to the defeat of this raid.

After suffering defeat at the Battle of Ilipa in 206 BC, Hasdrubal Gisco returned to Africa and Mago retreated to Gades with the remnants of his army. His deputy, another Hanno, was defeated by L. Marcius at the Battle of the Guadalquivir, and Mago was unable to take advantage of the rebellion of Hispanic tribes under Indibilis or the mutiny of the Roman troops at Sucro in 206 BC. He led an assault on Cartagena, believing the city to be lightly held, and was beaten back with severe losses. On returning, he found the gates of Gades barred. After crucifying the city magistrates for treason, he sailed away to the Balearic Islands.

==Third Carthaginian expedition to Italy==
Mago then led a campaign to invade Italy (this time by sea) with 15,000 men in early summer 205 BC. The army sailed from Menorca to Liguria under the escort of 30 Carthaginian quinqueremes. Mago managed to capture Genoa, and he held control of northern Italy for nearly three years, warring with the mountain tribes and gathering troops. The Romans devoted seven legions to maintain watch over him and guard northern Italy, but no general action was fought. In 204 BC, Mago was reinforced with 6,000 infantry and some cavalry from Carthage. The Romans refused to give battle and blocked Mago, preventing him from reaching Hannibal.

Finally, the Romans engaged him in battle in Cisalpine Gaul. The Battle of Insubria was an indecisive Roman victory, but Mago was severely wounded. Soon after the battle, he was recalled back to Carthage along with Hannibal to aid in its defence, as the future Scipio Africanus major had shattered the armies of Hasdrubal Gisco, Hanno, son of Bomilcar, and had captured Syphax, who was allied to Carthage, in Africa. Mago and his army sailed from Italy in 202 BC under the escort of the Punic fleet, and was unmolested by the Roman navy as he made for Africa. Before arriving in Carthage, however, he died of his wound at sea.

According to Cornelius Nepos, however, Mago survived the war and stayed with his brother Hannibal for several years, until the Carthaginians ordered his arrest around 193 BC. He managed to escape, but either died in a shipwreck or was killed by his slaves. Most historians, however, give little credit to Nepos and prefer Livy&#x27;s version.

The ability of Mago as a field commander can be glimpsed from his actions at the battles of Trebia and Cannae, where his failure might have doomed the Carthaginian army. He was a capable cavalry leader, as his repeated ambushes of the Romans in Iberia and Italy demonstrate.

==Legacy==
The Port of Mahón in the Balearics was allegedly founded by him and still bears his name. The local egg sauce that is now consumed all over the world is called mayonnaise after the city.

<doc id="334463" wikidata="Q858568" url="?curid=334463" title="Corm">
<text>Corm, bulbo-tuber, or bulbotuber is a short, vertical, swollen underground plant stem that serves as a storage organ that some plants use to survive winter or other adverse conditions such as summer drought and heat (perennation).

The word &quot;cormous&quot; usually means plants that grow from corms, parallel to the terms &quot;tuberous&quot; and &quot;bulbous&quot; to describe plants growing from tubers and bulbs.

A corm consists of one or more internodes with at least one growing point, generally with protective leaves modified into skins or tunics. The tunic of a corm forms from dead petiole sheaths—remnants of leaves produced in previous years. They act as a covering, protecting the corm from insects, digging animals, flooding, and water loss. The tunics of some species are thin, dry, and papery, at least in young plants, however, in some families, such as &quot;Iridaceae&quot;, the tunic of a mature corm can be formidable protection. For example, some of the larger species of &quot;Watsonia&quot; accumulate thick, rot-resistant tunics over a period of years, producing a structure of tough, reticulated fibre. Other species, such as many in the genus &quot;Lapeirousia&quot;, have tunics of hard, woody layers.

Internally, a typical corm mostly consists of parenchyma cells, rich in starch, above a circular basal node from which roots grow.

Long-lived cormous plants vary in their long-term development. Some regularly replace their older corms with a stack of younger corms, increased more or less seasonally. By splitting such a stack before the older corm generations wither too badly, the horticulturist can exploit the individual corms for propagation. Other species seldom do anything of that kind; their corms simply grow larger in most seasons. Yet others split when multiple buds or stolons on a large corm sprout independently, forming a tussock.

Corms can be dug up and used to propagate or redistribute the plant (see, for example, taro). Plants with corms generally can be propagated by cutting the corms into sections and replanting. Suitably treated, each section with at least one bud usually can generate a new corm.

== Comparison to bulbs ==
Corms are sometimes confused with true bulbs; they are often similar in appearance to bulbs externally, and thus erroneously called bulbs. Corms are stems that are internally structured with solid tissues, which distinguishes them from bulbs, which are mostly made up of layered fleshy scales that are modified leaves. As a result, a corm cut in half appears solid inside, but a true bulb cut in half reveals that it is made up of layers. Corms are structurally plant stems, with nodes and internodes with buds and produce adventitious roots. On the top of the corm, one or a few buds grow into shoots that produce normal leaves and flowers.
== Cormels ==
Corms can form many small cormlets called cormels, from the basal areas of the new growing corms, especially when the main growing point is damaged. These propagate corm-forming plants. A number of species replace corms every year by growing a new corm. This process starts after the shoot develops fully expanded leaves. The new corm forms at the shoot base just above the old corm. As the new corm grows, short stolons appear that end with the newly growing small cormels. As the plants grow and flower, they use up the old corm, which shrivels away. The new corm that replaces the old corm grows in size, especially after flowering ends.

The old corm produces the greatest number of cormels when close to the soil surface. Small cormels normally take one or two more years of growth before they are large enough to flower.

Cormels do have a reproductive function, but in the wild they also are important as a survival strategy. In most places where geophytes are common, so are animals that feed on them, whether from above like pigs, or from below like bulb weevils, mole rats, or pocket gophers. Such animals eat through protective tunics, but they generally miss several cormels that remain in the soil to replace the consumed plant. Plants such as &quot;Homeria&quot;, &quot;Watsonia&quot; and &quot;Gladiolus&quot;, genera that are vulnerable to such animals, are probably the ones that produce cormels in the greatest numbers and most widely distributed over the plant. &quot;Homeria&quot; species produce bunches of cormels on underground stem nodes, and &quot;Watsonia meriana&quot; for example actually produces cormels profusely from under
bracts on the inflorescences.

Those growing from the bottom of the corm are normal fibrous roots formed as the shoots grow, and are produced from the basal area at the bottom of the corm. The second type are thicker layered roots called contractile roots that form as the new corms are growing. They pull the corm deeper into the soil. In some species contractile roots are produced in response to fluctuating soil temperatures and light levels. In such species, once the corm is deep enough within the soil where the temperature is more uniform and there is no light, the contractile roots no longer grow and the corm is no longer pulled deeper into the soil. In some other species, contractile roots seem to be a defence against digging animals and can bury the corm surprisingly deeply over the years. &quot;Wurmbea marginata&quot; is one example of a small plant that can be challenging to dig unharmed out of a hard, clayey, hillside.

== Cormous plants ==

Cultivated plants that form corms include:

<text>Oedipus Aegyptiacus is Athanasius Kircher&#x27;s supreme work of Egyptology.

The three full folio tomes of ornate illustrations and diagrams were published in Rome over the period 1652–54. Kircher cited as his sources Chaldean astrology, Hebrew kabbalah, Greek mythology, Pythagorean mathematics, Arabian alchemy and Latin philology.

==Hieroglyphs==

The third volume of &quot;Oedipus Aegyptiacus&quot; deals exclusively with Kircher&#x27;s attempts to translate Egyptian hieroglyphs. The primary source for Kircher&#x27;s study of hieroglyphs was the Bembine Tablet, so named after its acquisition by Cardinal Bembo, shortly after the sack of Rome in 1527. The Bembine Tablet is a bronze and silver tablet depicting various Egyptian gods and goddesses. In its centre sits Isis representing &quot;the polymorphic all-containing Universal Idea.&quot;

Kircher&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus Aegyptiacus&quot; is an example of syncretic and eclectic scholarship in the late Renaissance and representative of antiquarian scholarship before the modern scientific era. His renditions of hieroglyphic texts tended to be wordy and portentous; for example, he translated a frequently occurring phrase in Egyptian, &quot;dd Wsr&quot;, &quot;Osiris says,&quot; as &quot;The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis, the moisture of nature is guarded by the vigilance of Anubis.&quot;

Kircher was respected in the seventeenth century for his study of Egyptian hieroglyphs; his contemporary Sir Thomas Browne (1605–1682) who owned several books by Kircher, including &quot;Oedipus Aegyptiacus&quot;, paid tribute to him as an Egyptologist and his study of hieroglyphs:


On the other hand, modern experts on hieroglyphic writing have found Kircher&#x27;s work to be of little value. According to E. A. Wallis Budge:

The accurate meaning of Egyptian hieroglyphs were not deciphered until 1824 when Jean-François Champollion finally solved the riddle through his study of the Rosetta Stone.

In 1999 the University of Geneva exhibited one of the vast tomes of &quot;Oedipus Aegyptiacus&quot; in an exhibition to celebrate the centenary of Jorge Luis Borges as representative of books associated with the Argentinian author.

<doc id="334466" wikidata="Q1428348" url="?curid=334466" title="Metalepsis">
<text>Metalepsis (from ) is a figure of speech in which a word or a phrase from figurative speech is used in a new context.

==Examples==

*&quot;I&#x27;ve got to catch the worm tomorrow.&quot;
**&quot;The early bird catches the worm&quot; is a common maxim, advising an early start on the day to achieve success. The subject, by referring to this maxim, is compared to the bird; tomorrow, the speaker will awake early in order to achieve success.
*&quot;He&#x27;s been rescued from the rabbit hole.&quot; 
**The adage &quot;fall down the rabbit hole&quot; refers to being deeply invested in a specific topic. In this example, being rescued from the rabbit hole adapts the original meaning to convey that someone has stopped being deeply invested in a specific topic.

*The phrase &quot;All singing, all dancing&quot; was originally literally about movie musicals, later an idiom meaning &quot;full of vitality&quot;, and more recently, &quot;full-featured&quot;.

==In Icelandic literature==
The word &quot;twikent&quot; (twice-kenned) is used for once-removed metalepsis involving kennings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faulkes 1999, p. 5/12&quot;&gt;Faulkes (1999), p. 5/12.&lt;/ref&gt; If a kenning has more than three elements, it is said to be &quot;rekit&quot; (&quot;extended&quot;). Kennings of up to seven elements are recorded in skaldic verse. Snorri Sturluson characterises five-element kennings as an acceptable license but cautions against more extreme constructions:

&quot;Níunda er þat at reka til hinnar fimtu kenningar, er ór ættum er ef lengra er rekit; en þótt þat finnisk í fornskálda verka, þá látum vér þat nú ónýtt.&quot; &quot;The ninth [license] is extending a kenning to the fifth determinant, but it is out of proportion if it is extended further. Even if it can be found in the works of ancient poets, we no longer tolerate it.&quot; — Snorri Sturluson 

&quot;nausta blakks hlé-mána gífrs drífu gim-slöngvir&quot; &quot;fire-brandisher of blizzard of ogress of protection-moon of steed of boat-shed&quot; — from &quot;Þórálfs drápa Skólmssonar&quot;, by Þórður Sjáreksson (this is the longest kenning found in skaldic poetry; it simply means &quot;warrior&quot;.)

==Other uses==
For the nature of metalepsis is that it is an intermediate step, as it were, to that which is metaphorically expressed, signifying nothing in itself, but affording a passage to something. It is a trope that we give the impression of being acquainted with rather than one that we actually ever need. — Quintilian

But the sense is much altered &amp; the hearer&#x27;s conceit strangely entangled by the figure Metalepsis, which I call the &quot;farfet&quot;, as when we had rather fetch a word a great way off than to use one nearer hand to express the matter as well and plainer. — George Puttenham
In a metalepsis, a word is substituted metonymically for a word in a previous trope, so that a metalepsis can be called, maddeningly but accurately, a metonymy of a metonymy. — Harold Bloom
==Narratology==
In narratology (and specifically in the theories of Gérard Genette), a paradoxical transgression of the boundaries between narrative levels or logically distinct worlds is also called metalepsis.

Perhaps the most common example of metalepsis in narrative occurs when a narrator intrudes upon another world being narrated. In general, narratorial metalepsis arises most often when an omniscient or external narrator begins to interact directly with the events being narrated, especially if the narrator is separated in space and time from these events.

There are so many examples of forking-path and metaleptic narratives by now that any recommendations will have to seem arbitrary. One of the most thoroughly enjoyable constructions of enigmatic worlds within worlds is Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Pale Fire&quot; (1962). A good short text is Robert Coover&#x27;s &quot;The Babysitter&quot; (1969). In film, a frequently referenced forking-path narrative is Peter Howitt&#x27;s &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; (1998).

[In Tom] Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Real Inspector Hound&quot;, the framing diegetic situation is here equally a theatre. In this fictional theatre a whodunnit is performed, witnessed by an audience which includes two theatre critics. In the course of the embedded performance these critics become paradoxically involved in the hypodiegetic play within a play, an involvement which even leads to the death of one of them. Thus, as in the case of Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Sei personaggi&quot;, the typical traits of a metalepsis can here also be recognized: a fictional representation consisting of several distinct worlds and levels, among which unorthodox transgression occur.

<doc id="334469" wikidata="Q329896" url="?curid=334469" title="Abraham Cowley">
<text>Abraham Cowley (; 161828 July 1667) was an English poet and essayist born in the City of London late in 1618. He was one of the leading English poets of the 17th century, with 14 printings of his &quot;Works&quot; published between 1668 and 1721.

==Early life and career==
Cowley&#x27;s father, a wealthy Londoner, who died shortly before his birth, was a stationer. His mother was wholly given to works of devotion, but it happened that there lay in her parlour a copy of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;. This became the favourite reading of her son, and he had read it twice before he was sent to school.

As early as 1628, when he was only ten years old, he composed his &quot;Tragicall Historie of Piramus and Thisbe&quot;, an epic romance written in a six-line stanza, a style of his own invention. It has been considered to be a most astonishing feat of imaginative precocity; it is marked by no great faults of immaturity, and possesses constructive merits of a very high order. Two years later, Cowley wrote another and still more ambitious poem, &quot;Constantia and Philetus&quot;; around this time he was sent to Westminster School. At Westminster he displayed extraordinary mental precocity and versatility, writing when he was just thirteen the &quot;Elegy on the Death of Dudley, Lord Carlton&quot;. These three lengthy poems, and some smaller ones, were collected in 1633, and published in a volume entitled &quot;Poeticall Blossomes&quot;, dedicated to Lambert Osbaldeston, the headmaster of the school, and prefaced by many laudatory verses by schoolfellows.

Cowley at once became famous, although he was only fifteen years old. His next composition was a pastoral comedy, entitled &quot;Loves Riddle&quot;, a marvellous production for a boy of sixteen, airy, correct and harmonious in language, and rapid in movement. The style is not without resemblance to that of the poet Thomas Randolph, whose earliest works had only just been printed.

In 1637 Cowley went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he &quot;betook himself with enthusiasm to the study of all kinds of learning, and early distinguished himself as a ripe scholar&quot;. Portraits of Cowley, attributed to William Faithorne and Stephen Slaughter, are in Trinity College&#x27;s collection. It was about this time that he composed his scriptural epic on the history of King David, one book of which still exists in the Latin original. An English version of the epic in four books, called the &quot;Davideis&quot;, was published after his death. The epic deals with the adventures of King David from his boyhood to the smiting of Amalek by Saul, where it abruptly closes.
In 1638 &quot;Loves Riddle&quot; and a Latin comedy, the &quot;Naufragium Joculare&quot;, were printed, and in 1641 the passage of Prince Charles (later to be King Charles II) through Cambridge led to the production of another dramatic work, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which was performed before the royal visitor with much success. During the civil war this play was privately performed at Dublin, but it was not printed till 1650. It is bright and amusing, in the style common to the &quot;sons&quot; of Ben Jonson, the university wits who wrote more for the closet than the public stage.
==Royalist in exile==
The learned quiet of the young poet&#x27;s life was disrupted by the Civil War in 1642 as he warmly espoused the royalist side. He became a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, but was ejected by the Parliamentarians in 1643. He made his way to Oxford, where he enjoyed the friendship of Lord Falkland, and gained the personal confidence of the royal family. Around this time, he published two anti-Puritan satires: &quot;A Satyre Against Separatists&quot; (attribution sometimes disputed), printed in 1642, and &quot;The Puritan and the Papist&quot; (1643).

After the Battle of Marston Moor he followed the queen to Paris, where his exile lasted twelve years. This period was spent almost entirely in the royal service, &quot;bearing a share in the distresses of the royal family, or labouring in their affairs. To this purpose he performed several dangerous journeys into Jersey, Scotland, Flanders, the Netherlands, or wherever else the king&#x27;s troubles required his attendance. But the chief testimony of his fidelity was the laborious service he underwent in maintaining the constant correspondence between the late king and the queen his wife. In that weighty trust he behaved himself with indefatigable integrity and unsuspected secrecy; for he ciphered and deciphered with his own hand the greatest part of all the letters that passed between their majesties, and managed a vast intelligence in many other parts, which for some years together took up all his days, and two or three nights every week.&quot;

In spite of these labours he did not refrain from writing. During his exile he became familiar with the works of Pindar, and determined to reproduce their lofty lyric passion in English. However, Cowley misunderstood Pindar&#x27;s metrical practice and therefore his reproduction of the Pindaric ode form in English did not accurately reflect Pindar&#x27;s poetics. But despite this problem, Cowley&#x27;s use of iambic lines of irregular length, pattern, and rhyme scheme was very influential and these type of odes are still known in English as Pindarics, Irregular Odes or Cowleyan Odes. Some of the most famous odes written after Cowley in the Pindaric tradition are Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Ode on the Departing Year&quot; and Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

During his exile, Cowley wrote a history of the Civil War (which did not get published in full until 1973). In the preface to his 1656 &quot;Poems&quot;, Cowley mentioned that he had completed three books of an epic poem on the Civil War, but had left it unfinished after the First Battle of Newbury when the Royalist cause began to lose significant ground. In the preface, Cowley indicated that he had destroyed all copies of the poem, but this was not precisely the truth. In 1679, twelve years after Cowley&#x27;s death, a shortened version of the first book of the poem, called &quot;A Poem on the Late Civil War&quot; was published. It was assumed that the rest of the poem had indeed been destroyed or lost until the mid-20th century when scholar Allan Pritchard discovered the first of two extant manuscript copies of the whole poem among the Cowper family papers. Thus, the three completed books of Cowley&#x27;s great (albeit unfinished) English epic, &quot;The Civill Warre&quot; (otherwise spelled &quot;The Civil War&quot;), was finally published in full for the first time in 1973.

In 1647 a collection of his love verses, entitled &quot;The Mistress&quot;, was published, and in the next year a volume of wretched satires, &quot;The Four Ages of England&quot;, was brought out under his name, with the composition of which he had nothing to do. In spite of the troubled times, usually so fatal to poetic fame, his reputation steadily increased, and when, on his return to England in 1656, he published a volume of his collected poetical works, he found himself without a rival in public esteem. This volume included the &quot;Pindarique Odes&quot;, the &quot;Davideis&quot;, the &quot;Mistress&quot; and some &quot;Miscellanies&quot;. Among the latter are to be found Cowley&#x27;s most vital pieces. This section of his works opens with the famous aspiration:
: &quot;What shall I do to be for ever known,
: And make the coming age my own?&quot;
It contains elegies on Wotton, Vandyck, Falkland, William Hervey and Crashaw, the last two being among Cowley&#x27;s finest poems, brilliant, sonorous and original; the amusing ballad of &quot;The Chronicle&quot;, giving a fictitious catalogue of his supposed amours; various gnomic pieces; and some charming paraphrases from Anacreon. The &quot;Pindarique Odes&quot; contain weighty lines and passages, buried in irregular and inharmonious masses of moral verbiage. Not more than one or two are good throughout, but a full posy of beauties may easily be culled from them. The long cadences of the &quot;Alexandrines&quot; with which most of the strophes close, continued to echo in English poetry from Dryden down to Gray, but the &quot;Odes&quot; themselves, which were found to be obscure by the poet&#x27;s contemporaries, immediately fell into disesteem.

The 1656 edition includes the notorious passage in which Cowley abjures his loyalty to the crown: &quot;yet when the event of battle, and the unaccountable will of God has determined the controversie, and that we have submitted to the conditions of the Conqueror, we must lay down our Pens as well as Arms, we must march out of our Cause itself, and dismantle that, as well as our own Towns and Castles, of all the Works and Fortifications as Wit and Reason by which we defended it.&quot;

&#x27;The Mistress&#x27; was the most popular poetic reading of the age, and is now the least read of all Cowley&#x27;s works. It was the last and most violent expression of the amatory affectation of the 17th century, an affectation which had been endurable in Donne and other early writers because it had been the vehicle of sincere emotion, but some find it complex in Cowley because for him it represented nothing but a love sublimation besides a rhetoric exercise, an exhibition of literary richness. He appears to have been of a reserved disposition; in the face of these elaborately erotic volumes, we are told that to the end of his days he never spoke of love to a single woman in real life. The &quot;Leonora&quot; of &quot;The Chronicle&quot; is said to have been the only woman he ever loved, and she married the brother of his biographer, Sprat.

==Return to England==
Soon after his return to England he was seized in mistake for another person, and only obtained his liberty on a bail of £1000. In 1658 he revised and altered his play of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and prepared it for the press under the title of &quot;The Cutter of Coleman Street&quot;, but it was not staged until 1661. Late in 1658 Oliver Cromwell died, and Cowley took advantage of the resulting confusion to escape to Paris, where he remained until the Restoration brought him back in Charles&#x27;s train. In 1662, he published the first two books of &quot;Plantarum&quot; (&quot;Plantarum libri duo&quot;). He published in 1663 &quot;Verses upon several occasions&quot;, in which &quot;The Complaint&quot; is included.
Cowley obtained permission to retire into the country; and through his friend, Lord St Albans, he obtained a property near Chertsey, where, devoting himself to botany and books, he lived in comparative solitude until his death. He took a practical interest in experimental science, and he was one of those advocating the foundation of an academy for the protection of scientific enterprise. Cowley&#x27;s pamphlet on &quot;The Advancement of Experimental Philosophy&quot;, 1661, immediately preceded the foundation of the Royal Society, to which Cowley, in March 1667, at the suggestion of John Evelyn, addressed an ode. He is also known for having provided the earliest reference to coca in English literature, in &quot;Pomona&quot;, the fifth book of his posthumously published Latin work &quot;Plantarum libri sex&quot; (included in &quot;Works&quot;, 1668; translated as &quot;Six Books of Plants&quot; in 1689).

He died in the Porch House in Chertsey, in consequence of having caught a cold while superintending his farm-labourers in the meadows late on a summer evening. On 3 August, Cowley was buried in Westminster Abbey beside the ashes of Chaucer and Spenser, where in 1675 the Duke of Buckingham erected a monument to his memory. The poetry of Cowley rapidly fell into neglect.
The first volume of Cowley&#x27;s collected works was published in 1668, when Thomas Sprat brought out an edition in folio, to which he prefixed a life of the poet. This included &quot;Poemata Latina&quot;, including the &quot;Plantarum libri sex&quot; (&quot;Six Books of Plants&quot;). Additional volumes were added in 1681 and 1689. There were many reprints of this collection, which formed the standard edition till 1881, when it was superseded by Alexander Balloch Grosart&#x27;s privately printed edition in two volumes, for the Chertsey Worthies library. The &quot;Essays&quot; have frequently been revived.

<doc id="334471" wikidata="Q985714" url="?curid=334471" title="Donnie Moore">
<text>Donnie Ray Moore (February 13, 1954 – July 18, 1989) was an American relief pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for the Chicago Cubs (1975, 1977–1979), St. Louis Cardinals (1980), Milwaukee Brewers (1981), Atlanta Braves (1982–1984) and California Angels (1985–1988). Moore is best remembered for the home run he gave up to Dave Henderson while pitching for the California Angels in Game 5 of the 1986 American League Championship Series. With only one more strike needed to clinch the team&#x27;s first-ever pennant, he allowed the Boston Red Sox to come back and eventually win the game. Boston then won Games 6 and 7 to take the series. Shortly after his professional career ended, he shot his wife three times in a dispute and then died by suicide.

==Early life==
Moore was born on February 13, 1954, in Lubbock, Texas, and was the cousin of MLB player Hubie Brooks. Moore attended Paris Junior College and Ranger College before he was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the first round of the January secondary phase of the 1973 Major League Baseball draft.

== Playing career ==
In a 13-season career, Moore posted a 43–40 record with 89 saves, 416 strikeouts, and a 3.67 earned run average in 655 innings. Moore also compiled a .281 batting average with 11 runs batted in. He was selected as an All-Star in 1985 after developing a splitter with a slider and a breaking ball.

=== Game 5 of the 1986 American League Championship Series ===
The game took place on October 12, 1986 in Anaheim. The Angels held a 3–1 series lead against the Boston Red Sox. In the game, the Angels held a 5–2 lead going into the ninth inning. A home run by Boston&#x27;s Don Baylor made it a 5–4 game.

When Moore came in to pitch, there were two outs and Rich Gedman, who had been hit by a pitch, was on first base. The Angels were one strike away from advancing to the World Series for the first time in franchise history. Dave Henderson hit a 2–2 pitch off Moore for a home run to give the Red Sox a 6–5 lead. The Angels were able to score a run in the bottom of the ninth, pushing the game into extra innings.

Moore remained in the game for the Angels; he was able to stifle a tenth inning Red Sox rally by getting Jim Rice to ground into a double play. Nonetheless, the Red Sox were able to score off Moore in the 11th inning via a sacrifice fly by Henderson. The Angels did not score in the bottom of the 11th, and lost the game 7–6. The defeat left the Angels with a 3–2 series advantage with two more games to play at Fenway Park. However, the Angels lost both games, by scores of 10–4 and 8–1.

After Game 5, Moore admitted that he made a bad pitch to Henderson. &quot;I was throwing fastballs and Henderson was fouling them off, so I went with the split-finger, thought maybe I&#x27;d catch him off guard, but it was right in his swing.&quot;

=== Later career ===
Moore was battling a shoulder injury at the time of the 1986 American League Championship Series and was never able to remain injury-free afterward. After saving nine more games in 41 appearances over the next two seasons, Moore was released by the Angels. He signed with the Kansas City Royals for the 1989 season, but played only in the minor leagues before being released in June of that year, ending his 14-year career in baseball.

== Shooting and suicide ==
On July 18, 1989, Moore had an argument with his wife Tonya and shot her three times with a .45 pistol. The incident occurred at their Anaheim Hills home, with their three children in the house at the time. Tonya Moore and daughter Demetria, then 17 years of age, fled from the house and Demetria drove her mother to the hospital. Tonya survived the shooting. Back inside the house, still in the presence of at least one of his sons, Moore then put the gun to his head and committed suicide. He was 35.

Hiršal was widely regarded as one of the most important Czech authors of experimental poetry; after early surrealistic writings, he made his literary debut with a collection of poems. Later on, he joined the group of artists around Jiří Kolář, a friend of whom he remained for his entire life and with whom he published children&#x27;s books in the 1950s after having been forbidden any kind of work during the Soviet occupation. He later on signed the Charter 77.

In the 1960s, Hiršal he started writing experimental poetry with partner, poet Bohumila Grögerová. The couple also co-authored several books and translated more than 180 works. Josef Hiršal built a reputation as a translator of foreign works into the Czech language, translating the works of, among others, Christian Morgenstern, Ernst Jandl, Eugène Ionesco, Wolfgang Hildesheimer, Hans Magnus Enzensberger, Franz Kafka, Edgar Allan Poe, Heinrich Heine, H. C. Artmann, Helmut Heissenbüttel, Fernando Pessoa and Torquato Tasso; in 1989, he received the Grand Austrian State Prize for his translations.

Josef Hiršal died in September 2003 following an accident with the Prague tram in May in which he was seriously injured. Bohumila Grögerová, who survived him, died on 22 August 2014, at the age of 93.

<doc id="334479" wikidata="Q677902" url="?curid=334479" title="William Wedgwood Benn, 1st Viscount Stansgate">
<text>William Wedgwood Benn, 1st Viscount Stansgate, (10 May 1877 – 17 November 1960) was a British Liberal politician who later joined the Labour Party. A decorated Royal Air Force officer, he was Secretary of State for India between 1929 and 1931 and Secretary of State for Air between 1945 and 1946. He was the father of Tony Benn and the paternal grandfather of Hilary Benn.

==Background and education==
Born in Hackney, Benn was the second son of Sir John Benn, 1st Baronet. He was given the name Wedgwood because his mother, Elizabeth (Lily) Pickstone, was distantly linked to Josiah Wedgwood of the pottery family. Benn was educated at the Lycée Condorcet in Paris and at University College, London. His elder brother was the publisher, writer and political publicist Ernest Benn.

==Political career==
Benn was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the St George&#x27;s division of Tower Hamlets in east London in 1906, holding the seat until 1918; his father had previously held the seat from 1892 to 1895. Between 1910 and 1915, he served in the Liberal government as a Lord of the Treasury (government whip). He was elected for Leith in Scotland in 1918. During the 1924–29 parliament, which was dominated by a Conservative majority, he worked closely with a group of radical Liberal MPs that included Frank Briant, Percy Harris, Joseph Kenworthy and Horace Crawfurd to provide opposition to the government. He sat until March 1927, when he resigned from the Liberal Party and from parliament.

The following year he re-entered parliament as Labour member for Aberdeen North. Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald recognised his talent, and offered the possibility of promotion. Benn served as Secretary of State for India between 1929 and 1931 in MacDonald&#x27;s second government, and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1929. However, he refused to follow MacDonald into the National Government coalition with the Conservatives, and at the 1931 election lost his seat to John George Burnett. He returned to parliament in 1937, when he was elected for Manchester Gorton.

In 1940, following the internment of thousands of refugees under pressure from the military he spoke up for them in Parliament. In 1942, Benn was raised to the peerage as Viscount Stansgate, of Stansgate in the County of Essex. Two years later, he was appointed Vice President of the Allied Control Commission which was charged with reconstructing a democratic government in Italy. In 1945, he became Secretary of State for Air in Clement Attlee&#x27;s Labour government, a position he held until October 1946. He then sat as a backbench Labour peer until his death fourteen years later.

From 1947 to 1957, Viscount Stansgate was President of the Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the world organization of national parliaments. He first took up that office at the IPU&#x27;s Conference in Cairo in April 1947, where he succeeded Count Henry Carton de Wiart of Belgium. A master in the art of human contacts, passionately interested in international politics, Viscount Stansgate played a major role in bringing the newly independent countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa into the ranks of the IPU. He was also instrumental in re-establishing the membership of parliaments of Eastern European countries, thus bringing the IPU nearer to its traditional objective – universality.

==Military career==
Although aged 37 at the time the First World War broke out, Benn was commissioned on 8 December 1914 as a second lieutenant in the Middlesex Yeomanry (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Hussars). On 12 May 1916, he was appointed an observer flying officer in the Royal Flying Corps. On 8 July 1916, he was appointed as the commanding officer of a seaplane observer squadron, with the temporary rank of captain. Seeing service at Gallipoli, he was seconded to the Royal Naval Air Service on 17 May 1917. He was awarded the DSO on 4 June 1917 He was promoted to lieutenant on 10 July 1917 (seniority from 1 June 1916, and with full pay and allowances from 1 July 1917). On 12 July 1918, Benn transferred to the Royal Air Force, and was appointed a temporary staff officer 3rd class, retaining his temporary captaincy.

In September 1918, he was awarded the DFC. The citation read: 
A gallant observer of exceptional ability. After setting out on a bombing raid, the Scout machines assigned to act as an escort became separated, and it then became necessary for the bombing planes to proceed on their task without support. Captain Benn&#x27;s machine took the lead, followed by three other bombers, and succeeded in dropping his bombs (direct hits) on an enemy aerodrome. On the return journey the bombing machines were attacked by several enemy scouts, which were eventually driven away. Recently, this officer organised and carried out a special flight by night over the enemy&#x27;s lines, under most difficult circumstances, with conspicuous success. He has at all times set a splendid example of courage (21 September 1918).

Also in September 1918 (night of 8–9 September) he and William George Barker flying a Savoia-Pomilio SP.4 aeroplane, specially equipped for a parachute drop. This was the first military parachute/spy mission. The parachutist was Alessandro Tandura (1893–1937), who parachuted behind enemy lines in the vicinity of the Piave river. In November, he was awarded the Bronze Medal of Military Valour by the Italian Government. After his return to politics, Benn resigned his commission in the RAF on 28 December 1918, retaining the rank of captain.

Though in his early 60s at start of the Second World War, Benn returned to military flying, joining the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as a war-substantive pilot officer (on probation) on 27 May 1940, with the service number 79452. He was promoted to flying officer (war substantive) on 7 December, and was confirmed in his rank on 27 May 1941. Promoted in 1942 to the substantive rank of flight lieutenant, he was promoted to group captain (war substantive) on 29 December 1942, skipping two ranks. Following his promotion to acting air commodore in 1944, he served as Director of Public Relations at the Air Ministry. At the age of 67 he flew several flights operationally as an RAF Bomber Aircrew gunner, and is possibly the oldest man to have done so. He resigned his commission on 3 August 1945, retaining the rank of air commodore.

==Family==
Lord Stansgate married Margaret Holmes, daughter of Daniel Holmes, in 1920. His eldest son Michael Wedgwood Benn was killed in the Second World War in 1944. Stansgate died at Westminster, London, in November 1960, aged 83, and was succeeded in the viscountcy by his second son, then known as Anthony Wedgwood Benn (1925–2014), who was successful in 1963 in changing the law to allow him to disclaim the peerage for life. His youngest son, David Wedgwood Benn (1928–2017), a specialist in Russia and Eastern Europe, worked for the BBC&#x27;s External Services for many years. A fourth son, Jeremy, was stillborn.

<doc id="334485" wikidata="Q28793946" url="?curid=334485" title="TV 2 (Danish TV channel)">
<text>TV 2 is a Danish government-owned broadcast and subscription television station, based in Odense, Funen. The station was founded in 1986, and made its first official broadcast in 1988. It makes daily broadcasts of regional and national news, as well as its morning talk show, &quot;Go&#x27;morgen Danmark&quot;.

==History==
Since 1949, Danmarks Radio had been the sole provider of television in Denmark. Wanting to end the monopoly, the Danish Parliament voted on 30 May 1986, to create TV2, as a second choice for public service television. Upon its establishment, it had first begun its experimental test transmissions, and then, two years later, it had therefore commenced its official broadcast on 1 October 1988, with its first program being &quot;Danish Symphony&quot; which is broadcast at 17:00, followed by the news at 19:30. By 1991, it surpassed DR in ratings.

==Subscription and overseas availability==
From 1 November 2009, all Danish television broadcasting became digital with DVB-T and MPEG4 standard. At the time, TV 2 did not encrypt their main channel, but TV 2 Echo, TV 2 Charlie, TV 2 Fri, TV 2 News, TV 2 Sport and TV 2 Sport X are subscription-only channels.

TV 2 Zulu who no longer broadcasts and aired between 15 October 2000 - 27 March 2023

Although the main channel had been broadcast terrestrially in the clear ever since the channel was launched, this ended on 11 January 2012 when it was encrypted and required with a monthly subscription charge of 12.50 Danish Kroner required to be paid, along with the purchase or rental of a decoder. Now it is a full subscription-based streaming platform.

In southernmost Sweden and northernmost Germany (where a Danish minority lives), this means significant difficulties for their viewers in Germany and Sweden, as subscribers need a Danish postal address for ordering a decoder card. However, the channel is still available in Sweden through subscription to pay-TV services such as Com Hem and Telia. Also a special agreement between TV 2 and Kabel Deutschland has been made, that it is now available digitally in the cable television network of Vodafone Kabel Deutschland in northernmost Germany since 15 December 2011 and to keep it unencrypted there. The analogue transmission of TV 2 in the aforementioned German cable network ceased 31 January 2012 in the specific regions where it had been available before and was replaced with a German channel.

It is also available through pay-TV subscription in Norway through Allente, Altibox, and Telia. 

==Regions==
==Programming==

On weekdays, TV 2 starts with &quot;Go&#x27;morgen Danmark&quot; (Literally: &quot;Good Morning Denmark&quot;), Denmark&#x27;s only breakfast talk show on national TV.

At 11:00 they hand over to the regions who broadcast to 12:30 (with an interruption for national news). That is followed by TV 2&#x27;s afternoon programming that mostly consists of American drama series and sitcoms. The regional stations also broadcast bulletins in the afternoon and evening, as well as a longer newscast at 19:30.

TV 2&#x27;s main national newscasts are shown at 19:00 and 21:30 but bulletins in the morning (first newscast at 6:00), at 12:00, 17:00 and 18:00 have been added over the years.

In common with other TV channels in Denmark, most foreign programmes on TV 2, as well as interviews originally conducted in a foreign language (e.g. for news and current affairs programming), are shown in their original language with Danish subtitles, the exception being animated series aimed at children which are dubbed.

==Funding==
Historically TV 2 was funded by television license fees and advertising sales. However, although the regional channels are still partly funded this way, funding by television license for the main channel ended in July 2004.

This form of double financing, along with a large injection of capital (to cover a deficit of 1 billion DKK (€134 million)) from the Danish State, is currently under investigation by the EU; accusations being that the dual funding has constituted illegal state aid.

<text>&quot;Campsis,&quot; commonly known as trumpet creeper or trumpet vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae, native to woodlands in China and North America. It consists of two species, both of which are vigorous deciduous perennial climbers, clinging by aerial roots, and producing large trumpet-shaped flowers in the summer. They are reasonably hardy and do well with the support of a wall, preferring full sun.

==Species==

* &quot;Campsis grandiflora&quot; – Chinese trumpet vine (East Asia)
* &quot;Campsis radicans&quot; – American trumpet vine (Southeastern United States)

==Hybrids==
* &quot;Campsis&quot; × &quot;tagliabuana&quot; (Madame Galen), a mid-19th century hybrid between &quot;Campsis grandiflora&quot; and &quot;Campsis radicans&quot;

<text>Thomas Randolph ( 15 June 1605March 1635) was an English poet and dramatist, recognised by his mentor Ben Jonson as being a promising writer of comedy, and amongst his contemporaries had a reputation as a wit.

==Early life and family==
Thomas was born at Newnham, Northamptonshire, near Daventry, England, eldest son of William Randolph (1572–1660) and Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Smith, of Newnham. He was baptized on 18 June 1605. William and Elizabeth had two other sons and a daughter. Around 1613 his mother died, shortly after giving birth to Randolph&#x27;s sister. His father remarried about 1615 to Dorothy, the widow of Thomas West of Cotton End, and daughter of gentleman Richard Lane, of Courteenhall. Her brother was the barrister Richard Lane. William and Dorothy were married two years after the family moved to a house in Little Houghton where his father was steward to Lord Zouche. They had three daughters and four sons. Thomas&#x27;s half-brother Henry (1623-1673) emigrated to Colonial Virginia, becoming ancestor of the Randolph family of Virginia. He was the uncle of American colonist William Randolph.

==Education==
Randolph was admitted in 1618 as a King&#x27;s Scholar to the College of St. Peter, better known as Westminster School, and then Trinity College, Cambridge in 1624 at the age of 18. He was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1628, promoted to Master of Arts in 1631, and became a major fellow of his college in the same year.

Prior to official publication, Randolph wrote several pieces before entering Westminster, including several epitaphs for people close to the family, the first written when he was 16 in the year 1621. While at Cambridge, he contributed what was probably his first official literary contribution: a poem that was included in a collection celebrating the marriage of King Charles to Princess Henrietta Maria. Around 1626, Thomas&#x27; first dramatic production was produced at Cambridge: &quot;Aristippus&quot; or &quot;The Jovial Philosopher&quot;. He also revived the tradition of Saltings at Cambridge and his Salting is one of the few that have survived to our day. The revival was repeated the following year by a student one year below Randolph: John Milton. Randolph continued writing throughout his educational career.

==Career==

He soon gave promise as a writer of comedy. Ben Jonson, not an easily satisfied critic, adopted him as one of his &quot;sons.&quot; He addressed three poems to Jonson, one on the occasion of Thomas&#x27;s formal &quot;adoption&quot; as a Son of Ben, another on the failure of Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The New Inn&quot;, and the third an eclogue, describing Thomas&#x27;s own studies at Cambridge. Randolph was one of the most popular playwrights of his time and was expected to become Poet Laureate after Jonson. It was his untimely death at age 29, two years before Jonson&#x27;s death, that prevented this. After Cambridge, Randolph lived with his father at Little Houghton, Northamptonshire for some time, and afterwards with William Stafford of Blatherwycke Hall, where he died aged 29. He was buried in Blatherwycke church on 17 March 1635 and his epitaph was written by Peter Hausted, the author of &quot;The Rival Friends&quot;, on his monument, commissioned by Christopher Hatton, 1st Baron Hatton.

Randolph&#x27;s reputation as a wit is attested by the verses addressed to him by his contemporaries and by the stories attached to his name. His earliest printed work is &quot;Aristippus, Or, The Joviall Philosopher. Presented in a private shew, To which is added, The Conceited Pedlar&quot; (1630). It is a gay interlude burlesquing a lecture in philosophy, the whole piece being an argument to support the claims of sack against small beer. &quot;The Conceited Pedlar&quot; is an amusing monologue delivered by the pedlar, who defines himself as an &quot;individuum vagum, or the primum mobile of tradesmen, a walking-burse or movable exchange, a Socratical citizen of the vast universe, or a peripatetical journeyman, that, like another Atlas, carries his heavenly shop on shoulders.&quot; He then proceeds to display his wares with a running satirical comment.

The drama, &quot;The Jealous Lovers&quot;, was presented by the students of Trinity College, Cambridge, before the king and queen in 1632. &quot;The Muse&#x27;s Looking-Glass&quot; is hardly a drama. &quot;Roscius&quot; presents the extremes of virtue and vice in pairs, and last of all the &quot;golden mediocrity&quot; who announces herself as the mother of all the virtues. &quot;Amyntas, or The Impossible Dowry&quot;, a pastoral printed in 1638, with a number of miscellaneous Latin and English poems, completes the list of Randolph&#x27;s authenticated work. &quot;Hey for Honesty, down with Knavery&quot;, a comedy, is doubtfully assigned to him. Randolph has been proposed as the author of the anonymous manuscript play, &quot;The Fairy Knight&quot;, though the attribution has not won much approval from critics.

His works were edited by W. C. Hazlitt in 1875.

<text>Hans Carl Artmann (12 June 1921 – 4 December 2000), also known as Ib Hansen, was an Austrian poet and writer, most popular for his early poems written in Viennese (&quot;med ana schwoazzn dintn&quot;, 1958), which however, never after were to be the focus of his oeuvre.

==Life and work==
Artmann was born in Vienna as the son of shoe maker Johann Artmann and his wife Marie (née Schneider). After growing up in Vienna and attending &quot;Volks- &amp; Hauptschule&quot;, he worked as an office intern for three years; in 1940, he was conscripted during World War II, and transferred to a punishment battalion after suffering a war wound in 1941.

Having grown up trilingually, Artmann had an interest in language from an early age on; in 1947, his first publications appeared on radio and in the newspaper &quot;Neue Wege&quot;. He joined the Art-Club in 1951, and worked with Gerhard Rühm and Konrad Bayer from 1952 on. The same year, he also founded the so-called Wiener Gruppe of avantgarde poets, which he left in 1958.

Starting in 1954, Artmann travelled Europe extensively; he stayed in Sweden from 1961 to 1965, living in Stockholm, Lund and Malmö, then went to live in Berlin until 1969, to settle down in Salzburg in 1972. As Ib Hansen he had sung at DMGP 1966 with the song &quot;Lille Veninde&quot; placing equal 3rd with 9 points.

He was a founding member of the &quot;Anti P.E.N.&quot; club in 1973; later that year, he became and stayed president of the &quot;Grazer Autorenversammlung&quot; until leaving the organization in 1978.

He earned several awards for his achievements in literature during his lifetime, including the Grand Austrian State Prize in 1974, the title of honorary doctor from the University of Salzburg in 1991 and the Georg-Büchner Preis for literature in 1997.

Artmann wrote a number of humorous stories, including parodies of &quot;Dracula&quot;, (&quot;dracula dracula&quot;, 1966),
&quot;Frankenstein&quot;, (&quot;Frankenstein in Sussex&quot;, 1969) 
and Hollywood fantasy films (&quot;In the Gulf of Carpentaria&quot;).

Artmann was a prolific translator; he rendered Edward Lear, Lars Gustafsson, Daisy Ashford
and H.P. Lovecraft into German.

He also translated one volume of the Asterix series into Viennese language, &quot;Da Legionäa Asterix&quot;, which was released in 1999.

H. C. Artmann died from a heart attack on 4 December 2000 in Vienna at the age 79. He was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering, where his ashes are also buried.

<doc id="334507" wikidata="Q1813993" url="?curid=334507" title="Procedural knowledge">
<text>Procedural knowledge (also known as know-how, knowing-how, and sometimes referred to as practical knowledge, imperative knowledge, or performative knowledge) is the knowledge exercised in the performance of some task. Unlike descriptive knowledge (also known as declarative knowledge, propositional knowledge or &quot;knowing-that&quot;), which involves knowledge of specific facts or propositions (e.g. &quot;I know that snow is white&quot;), procedural knowledge involves one&#x27;s ability to &quot;do&quot; something (e.g. &quot;I know how to change a flat tire&quot;). A person doesn&#x27;t need to be able to verbally articulate their procedural knowledge in order for it to count as knowledge, since procedural knowledge requires only knowing how to correctly perform an action or exercise a skill.

The term &quot;procedural knowledge&quot; has narrower but related technical uses in both cognitive psychology and intellectual property law.

== Overview ==
Procedural knowledge (i.e., knowledge-how) is different from descriptive knowledge (i.e., knowledge-that) in that it can be directly applied to a task. For instance, the procedural knowledge one uses to solve problems differs from the declarative knowledge one possesses about problem solving because this knowledge is formed by doing.

The distinction between knowing-how and knowing-that was brought to prominence in epistemology by Gilbert Ryle who used it in his book &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot;.

Know-how is also often referred to in layman&#x27;s terms as street smarts (sometimes conceived as the opposite of s), and a person employing their street smarts as &quot;street wise&quot;. Know-how is often tacit knowledge, which means that it can be difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalising it. The opposite of tacit knowledge is explicit knowledge.

== Definition ==
Procedural knowledge is the &quot;know how&quot; attributed to technology defined by cognitive psychologists, which is simply &quot;know how to do it&quot; knowledge. Part of the complexity of it comes in trying to link it to terms such as &quot;process&quot;, &quot;problem solving&quot;, &quot;strategic thinking&quot; and the like, which in turn requires distinguishing different levels of procedure. It is the ability to execute action sequences to solve problems. This type of knowledge is tied to specific problem types and therefore is not widely generalizable. Procedural knowledge is goal-oriented and mediates problem-solving behavior.

The concept of procedural knowledge is also widely used in mathematics educational researches. The well-influential definition of procedural knowledge in this domain comes from the introductory chapter by Hiebert and Lefevre (1986) of the seminal book &quot;Conceptual and procedural knowledge: The case of mathematics&quot;, in which they divided procedural knowledge into two categories. The first one is a familiarity with the individual symbols of the system and with the syntactic conventions for acceptable configurations of symbols. The second one consists of rules or procedures of solving mathematical problems. In other words, they define procedural knowledge as knowledge of the syntax, steps conventions and rules for manipulating symbols. Many of the procedures that students possess probably are chains of prescriptions for manipulating symbols. In their definition, procedural knowledge includes algorithms, which means if one executes the procedural steps in a predetermined order and without errors, one is guaranteed to get the solutions, but not includes heuristics, which are abstract, sophisticated and deep procedures knowledge that are tremendously powerful assets in problem solving. Therefore, Star (2005) proposed a reconceptualization of procedural knowledge, suggesting that it can be either superficial, like ones mentioned in Hiebert and Lefevre (1986), or deep. Deep procedural knowledge is associated with comprehension, flexibility and critical judgement. For example, the goals and subgoals of steps, the environment or type of situation for certain procedure, and the constraints imposed upon the procedure by the environment. Research on procedural flexibility development indicates flexibility as an indicator for deep procedural knowledge. Individuals with superficial procedural knowledge can only use standard technique, which might lead to low efficiency solutions and probably inability to solve novel questions. However, more flexible solvers, with a deep procedural knowledge, can navigate their way through domain, using techniques other than ones that are over-practiced, and find the best match solutions for different conditions and goals. 

== Development ==
The development of procedural knowledge is always entangled with the development of declarative knowledge. Researchers suggested that initial problem solving involves explicitly referring to examples and participants start with pure example-based processing. The examples illustrate the solution of a similar problem and the problem solver analogically maps the solution of the example onto a solution for the current problem. People make extensive reference to examples even when they are initially taught the rules and principles. It is believed that when people acquire cognitive skills, first an example is encoded as a declarative structure. When participants are tested on their first problems, they have two possible ways to respond. If the example matches the problem they learned, they can simply retrieve the answer. However, if it does not match, they must analogically extend the example. With repeated practice, general rules develop and the specific example is no longer accessed. In this way, knowledge transitions from a declarative form (encoding of examples) to a procedural form (production rules), which is called the adaptive control of thought—rational (ACT-R) theory.

However, on certain occasions, procedural and declarative knowledge can be acquired independently. Research with amnesiac patients found that they can learn motor skills without the ability to recollect the episodes in which they learned them. The research also found that the patients learned and retained the ability to read mirror-reversed words efficiently, yet were severely impaired in recognizing those words. This research gives evidence about the neurological differences between procedural and declarative knowledge. Researchers also found that some normal subjects, like amnesiac patients, showed substantial procedural learning in the absence of explicit declarative knowledge. Even though declarative knowledge may influence performance on a procedural task, procedural and declarative knowledge may be acquired separately and one does not need to have knowledge of one type in order to build the other type. The influence of declarative knowledge may be due to the facilitation of a process of pathway activation that is outside of conscious awareness. If the prime is highly predictive of the target, the amount of facilitation is increased because of an active, conscious, attentional effect that is superimposed on the pathway activation. Therefore, if and when subjects develop explicit declarative knowledge of procedure, they can use this knowledge to form attentional expectancies regarding the next item in this procedure.

== Activation ==
Lashley (1951) proposed that behavioral sequences are typically controlled with central plans, and the structure of the plans is hierarchical. Some evidences also support this hypothesis. Same behaviors can have different functional interpretations depending on the context in which they occur. The same sound pattern can be interpreted differently depending on where it occurs in a sentence, for example, &quot;there&quot; and &quot;their&quot;. Such contextual dependence is only possible with functionally overarching states of the sort implied by hierarchical plans. The initiation time of a movement sequence and the inter-response times of the sequence elements can increase with its length. Further, inter-response times can depend on the size of the phrase that is about to be generated. The larger the phrase, the longer the inter-response time. Such data have been interpreted in terms of decoding or unpacking hierarchical plans into their constituents. Moreover, learning difficulties changes with the easiness of behavioral sequences. Finally, long-term learning of skills is naturally characterized by the process of forming ever larger hierarchical units or chunks. People learn control structures for successively larger units of behavior, with newly learned routines calling up or relying on more elementary routines, like learning to play simple notes before being able to play a piano concerto.

As for process of behavior plan forming, Rosenhaum et al. (2007) proposed that plans are not formed from scratch for each successive movement sequence but instead are formed by making whatever changes are needed to distinguish the movement sequence to be performed next from the movement sequence that has just been performed. There are evidences found that motor planning occurs by changing features of successively needed motor plans. Also, Rosenhaum et al. (2007) found that even single movements appear to be controlled with hierarchically organized plans, with starting and goal postures at the top level and intermediate states comprising the transition from the starting to the goal at the lower level.

== Interaction with conceptual knowledge ==
The most common understanding in relation to the procedural and conceptual knowledge is of the contrast of &quot;knowing how&quot; and &quot;knowing that&quot;. Some see the distinction as a contrast between the tacit knowledge of technology and the explicit knowledge of science. Conceptual knowledge allows us to explain why, hence the distinction of &quot;know how&quot; and &quot;know why&quot;. Conceptual knowledge is concerned with relationships among items of knowledge, such that when students can identify these links, it means they have conceptual understanding. Cognitive psychologists also use the term &quot;declarative knowledge&quot; to contrast it with procedural knowledge, and define it as &quot;knowledge of facts&quot;. However, declarative knowledge may be a collection of unrelated facts, whereas conceptual knowledge puts the focus on relationships. Also, declarative knowledge is an inert form of knowledge which contrasted with procedural knowledge as an active form, but conceptual knowledge can be part of an active process. Therefore, it is important to know that conceptual knowledge is not simply factual knowledge but consists of ideas that give some power to thinking about technological activity.

Evidence from mathematics learning research supports the idea that conceptual understanding plays a role in generation and adoption of procedures. Children with greater conceptual understanding tend to have greater procedural skill. Conceptual understanding precedes procedural skill. Instruction about concepts as well as procedures can lead to increased procedural skill. And increasing conceptual knowledge leads to procedure generation. However, this relationship is not unidirectional. Conceptual and procedural knowledge develop iteratively, but the conceptual knowledge may have a greater influence on procedural knowledge than the reverse. Conceptual instruction led to increased conceptual understanding and to generation and transfer of a correct procedure. Procedural instruction led to increased conceptual understanding and to adoption, but only limited transfer, of the instructed procedure.
== Technical uses of the phrase ==

=== Artificial intelligence ===

In artificial intelligence, procedural knowledge is a type of knowledge that can be possessed by an intelligent agent. Such knowledge is often represented as a partial or complete finite-state machine or computer program. A well-known example is the procedural reasoning system, which might, in the case of a mobile robot that navigates in a building, contain procedures such as &quot;navigate to a room&quot; or &quot;plan a path&quot;. In contrast, an AI system based on declarative knowledge might just contain a map of the building, together with information about the basic actions that can be done by the robot (like moving forward, turning, and stopping), and leave it to a domain-independent planning algorithm to discover how to use those actions to achieve the agent&#x27;s goals.

=== Cognitive psychology ===
In cognitive psychology, procedural knowledge is the knowledge exercised in the accomplishment of a task, and thus includes knowledge which, unlike declarative knowledge, cannot be easily articulated by the individual, since it is typically subconscious (or tacit). Many times, the individual learns procedural knowledge without being aware that they are learning. For example, most individuals can easily recognize a specific face as attractive or a specific joke as funny, but they cannot explain how exactly they arrived at that conclusion or they cannot provide a working definition of attractiveness or being funny. This example illustrates the difference between procedural knowledge and the ordinary notion of knowing how, a distinction which is acknowledged by many cognitive psychologists.

Ordinarily, we would not say that one who is able to recognize a face as attractive is one who knows how to recognize a face as attractive. One knows how to recognize faces as attractive no more than one knows how to recognize certain arrangements of leptons, quarks, etc. as tables. Recognizing faces as attractive, like recognizing certain arrangements of leptons, quarks, etc. as tables, is simply something that one does, or is able to do. It is, therefore, an instance of procedural knowledge, but it is not an instance of know-how. In many cases, both forms of knowledge are subconscious.

For instance, research by cognitive psychologist Pawel Lewicki has shown that procedural knowledge can be acquired by subconscious processing of information about covariations.

=== Educational implications ===
In the classroom, procedural knowledge is part of the prior knowledge of a student. In the context of formal education procedural knowledge is what is learned about learning strategies. It can be the &quot;tasks specific rules, skills, actions, and sequences of actions employed to reach goals&quot; a student uses in the classroom. As an example for procedural knowledge Cauley refers to how a child learns to count on their hands and/or fingers when first learning math. The Unified Learning Model explicates that procedural knowledge helps make learning more efficient by reducing the cognitive load of the task. In some educational approaches, particularly when working with students with learning disabilities, educators perform a task analysis followed by explicit instruction with the steps needed to accomplish the task.

One advantage of procedural knowledge is that it can involve more senses, such as hands-on experience, practice at solving problems, understanding of the limitations of a specific solution, etc. Thus procedural knowledge can frequently eclipse theory.

One limitation of procedural knowledge is its job-dependent nature. As a result, it tends to be less general than declarative knowledge. For example, a computer expert might have knowledge about a computer algorithm in multiple languages, or in pseudo-code, but a Visual Basic programmer might know only about a specific implementation of that algorithm, written in Visual Basic. Thus the &#x27;hands-on&#x27; expertise and experience of the Visual Basic programmer might be of commercial value only to Microsoft job-shops, for example.

=== Intellectual property law ===

In intellectual property law, procedural knowledge is a parcel of closely held information relating to industrial technology, sometimes also referred to as a trade secret which enables its user to derive commercial benefit from it. In some legal systems, such procedural knowledge has been considered the intellectual property of a company, and can be transferred when that company is purchased. It is a component of the intellectual property rights on its own merits in most legislations but most often accompanies the license to the right-of-use of patents or trademarks owned by the party releasing it for circumscribed use. Procedural knowledge is not however solely composed of secret information that is not in the public domain; it is a &quot;bundled&quot; parcel of secret and related non-secret information which would be novel to an expert in the field of its usage.

===Industrial know-how===
In the context of industrial property (now generally viewed as intellectual property or IP), know-how is a component in the transfer of technology in national and international environments, co-existing with or separate from other IP rights such as patents, trademarks and copyright and is an economic asset. When it is transferred by itself, know-how should be converted into a trade secret before transfer in a legal agreement.

Know-how can be defined as confidentially held, or better, closely held information in the form of unpatented inventions, formulae, designs, drawings, procedures and methods, together with accumulated skills and experience in the hands of a licensor firm&#x27;s professional personnel which could assist a transferee/licensee of the object product in its manufacture and use and bring to it a competitive advantage. It can be further supported with privately maintained expert knowledge on the operation, maintenance, use/application of the object product and of its sale, usage or disposition.

The inherent proprietary value of know-how is embedded in the legal protection afforded to trade secrets in general law, particularly, case law. Know-how, in short, is private intellectual property which can be said to be a form of precursor to other intellectual property rights. The trade secret law varies from country to country, unlike the case for patents, trademarks and copyright for which there are formal conventions through which subscribing countries grant the same protection to the property as the others; examples of which are the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), under United Nations, a supportive organization designed &quot;to encourage creative activity, [and] to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world&quot;.

The World Trade Organization defined a trade secret by the following criteria:

For purposes of illustration, the following may be a provision in a license agreement serving to define know-how:-

===Disclosure agreements===
There are two sets of agreements associated with the transfer of know-how agreement: disclosure and non-disclosure agreements, which are not separately parts of the principal know-how agreement.

The initial need for disclosure is due to the requirement of a licensee firm to know what is the specific, unique, or general content of the know-how that a licensor firm possesses that promises value to the licensee on entering into a contract. Disclosure also aids the potential licensee in selecting among competitive offers, if any. Such disclosures are made by licensors only under non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements in which there are express undertakings that should the ultimate license not materialize, the firm to whom the disclosure is made will not reveal, or by any manner apply, any part of the disclosed knowledge which is not in the public domain or previously known to the firm receiving the information.

Non-disclosure agreements are undertaken by those who receive confidential information from the licensee, relating to licensed know-how, so as to perform their tasks. Among them are the personnel of engineering firms who construct the plant for the licensee or those who are key employees of the licensee who have detailed access to disclosed data, etc. to administer their functions in operating the know-how-based plant. These are also in the nature of confidentiality agreements and carry the definition of know-how, in full or truncated part, on a need-to-know basis.

=== Employee knowledge ===

Under English law, employees have duties of good faith and fidelity until their employment ceases, whence only the former still applies.

It is sometimes unclear what forms of &quot;know how&quot; that was divulged to an employee in order to carry out their functions and then becomes their own knowledge rather than a secret of their previous employer. Some employers will specify in their employment contracts that a grace period will apply to know how that starts when a person leaves them as an employee.

Specifying exactly what information this includes would increase the likelihood of it being upheld in court in the event of a breach, i.e. saying &quot;when your employment contract is terminated, you must keep all information about your previous employment with us secret for four years&quot; would be difficult to support because that person has to be able to use the skills and knowledge they learnt to gain employment elsewhere.

<text>Joseph Reinach (30 September 1856 – 18 April 1921) was a French author and politician.
==Biography==
He was born in Paris. His two brothers Salomon Reinach and Théodore Reinach would later be known in the field of archaeology. After studying at Lycée Condorcet, he was called to the bar in 1887. He attracted the attention of Léon Gambetta by writing articles on Balkan politics for the &quot;Revue bleue&quot;, and joined the staff of the &quot;Republique française&quot;. In Gambetta&#x27;s &quot;grand ministère&quot;, Reinach was his secretary and tried to obtain a partial revision of the constitution and list proportional representation. In the &quot;République française&quot; he waged a steady war against General Boulanger, which resulted in three duels, one with Edmond Magnier and two with Paul Déroulède. Between 1889 and 1898, he sat for the Chamber of Deputies for Digne.

As a member of the army commission, reporter of the budgets of the ministries of the interior and of agriculture he brought forward bills for the better treatment of the insane, for the establishment of a colonial ministry, for the taxation of alcoholic beverages, and for the reparation of judicial errors. He advocated complete freedom of the theatre and the press, the abolition of public executions, and denounced political corruption of all kinds. 

However, Reinach is best known as the champion of Alfred Dreyfus. At the time of the original trial, he attempted to secure a public hearing of the case, and, in 1897, he allied himself with Auguste Scheurer-Kestner to demand its revision. He denounced in the &quot;Siècle&quot; the Henry forgery and Esterhazy&#x27;s complicity. His articles in the &quot;Siècle&quot; aroused the fury of the anti-Dreyfus party, especially as Reinach was a Jew and was accused by some of taking up Dreyfus&#x27;s defence on racial grounds.

He lost his seat in the Chamber of Deputies and, having refused to fight Henri Rochefort, an anti-Dreyfus journalist, eventually brought an action for libel against the latter. Finally, Dreyfus was pardoned, Reinach wrote a history of the case that was completed in 1905. Henri Dutrait-Croyon&#x27;s &quot;Joseph Reinach, historien&quot; (Paris: A. Savaète, 1905), a violent detailed rebuttal of Reinach&#x27;s history that &quot;became a bible for that anti-Semitic section of French public opinion convinced of the culpability of Dreyfus.&quot;

In 1906, Reinach was re-elected for Digne. In that year, he became a member of the commission of the national archives, and the following year a member of the council on prisons. Reinach was a prolific writer on political subjects. He published three volumes on Léon Gambetta in 1884 and also edited Gambetta&#x27;s speeches.

Joseph and his wife Henriette-Clémentine had a son, Adolphe Reinach, born in 1887. Adolphe became an archaeologist and Egyptologist known mainly for his discovery of the Coptos Decrees. He was killed in the first month of the First World War, in August 1914.

<text>Timiskaming is a district and census division in Northeastern Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario. The district was created in 1912 from parts of Algoma, Nipissing, and Sudbury districts. In 1921, Cochrane District was created from parts of this district and parts of Thunder Bay District.

It is just west of the similarly named Témiscamingue county in Quebec, which is also informally called a region, but is administratively part of a greater region named Abitibi-Témiscamingue.

Temiskaming District is home to several provincial parks.

<text>Salomon Reinach (29 August 1858 – 4 November 1932) was a French archaeologist, religious historian and was a major figure in the Franco-Jewish establishment in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He was vice president of the most important contemporary Jewish organization, the Alliance Israelite Universelle, and a founder of the Jewish Colonization Association.

==Biography==

The brother of Joseph Reinach and Théodore Reinach, he was born at St Germain-en-Laye and educated at the École normale supérieure before joining the French school at Athens in 1879. He made valuable archaeological discoveries at Myrina near Smyrna in 1880–82, at Cyme in 1881, at Thasos, Imbros and Lesbos (1882), at Carthage and Meninx (1883–84), at Odessa (1893) and elsewhere. He received honours from the chief learned societies of Europe.

In 1887 he obtained an appointment at the National Museum of Antiquities at Saint-Germain-en-Laye; in 1893 he became assistant curator, and in 1902 curator of the national museums. In 1903 he became joint editor of the &quot;&quot;Revue archéologique&quot;, and in the same year officer of the Legion of Honour. The lectures he delivered on art at the École du Louvre in 1902-3 were published by him under the title of &quot;Apollo : histoire générale des arts plastiques professée en 1902-1903 à l&#x27;École du Louvre&quot;&quot;. These were translated into most European languages, and became a standard handbook on the subject.

==Publications==

Reinach&#x27;s first published work was a translation of Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Free Will&quot; (&quot;&quot;Essai sur le libre arbitre&quot;, 1877), which passed through many editions. His &quot;Manuel de philologie classique&quot; (1880-1884) was crowned by the French association for the study of Greek; his &quot;Grammaire latine&quot; (1886) received a prize from the Society of Secondary Education; &quot;La Nécropole de Myrina&quot; (1887), written with Edmond Pottier, and &quot;Antiquités nationales&quot; were crowned by the Academy of Inscriptions. He compiled an important &quot;Répertoire de la statuaire grecque et romaine&quot; (3 volumes, 1897–98); also &quot;Répertoire de peintures du Moyen âge et de la Renaissance 1280-1580&quot; (1905, etc.); &quot;Répertoire des vases peints grecs et étrusques&quot; (1900). In 1905 he began his &quot;Cultes, mythes et religions&quot;; and in 1909 he published a general sketch of the history of religions under the title of &quot;Orpheus; histoire générale des religions&quot;&quot; (translated into English and published as &quot;Orpheus, a general history of religions&quot;).

He also translated from the English HC Lea&#x27;s &quot;History of the Inquisition&quot; as &quot;&quot;Histoire de l&#x27;Inquisition au Moyen-âge&quot;. In 1936 his updated bibliography was published — &quot;Bibliographie de Salomon Reinach&quot;&quot;. It has been said his bibliography runs to 262 pages and includes more than ninety lengthy works and at least seven thousand articles. (Curtis, 2003) 

==Mythicist theories==

Reinach has been cited as a proponent of the Christ myth theory. However, he did not deny the possibility of an historical Jesus. Reinach is quoted as saying &quot;It is impossible to establish the historical Jesus, which is not to say that he did not exist, but only that we cannot positively affirm anything about him.&quot;

Reinach was critical of the Passion of Jesus which he considered was a myth based on pre-existing pagan legends. Reinach was supportive of the mythicist research of William Benjamin Smith. In regard to Smith&#x27;s &quot;Ecce Deus&quot;, he wrote that &quot;I have read this great book from cover to cover. It is a possession for ever. The author may not live to see it, but it will be read by myriads and shed light on millions.&quot;

Rationalist writer Joseph McCabe wrote that Reinach was &quot;one of the leading French authorities on the science of religion, from which he removes all supernatural elements.&quot;

==Death==

Salomon Reinach died in 1932 and was buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris.

<text>Henry Charles Lea (September 19, 1825 – October 24, 1909) was an American publisher, civic activist, philanthropist and historian from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

He took over the family publishing business from his father, Isaac Lea, and implemented several medical and scientific publications. The business operated under various names including Lea Brothers &amp; Co., Lea &amp; Febiger and Blanchard &amp; Lea until his sons took over the business in 1880.

He promoted health projects including the Lea Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Epileptic Hospital and Colony Farm. He organized the Citizens&#x27; Municipal Reform Association of Philadelphia to fight corruption in city government. He was a founding member of the Union League of Philadelphia during the American Civil War. He managed publications and supported their efforts for recruitment of Union Army soldiers, including African-Americans. He helped found the National Republican League to prevent a third U.S. presidential term for Ulysses S. Grant.

Lea wrote multiple books focused on church history, especially the Spanish Inquisition. He received honorary degrees from Harvard University, Princeton University, University of Giessen, University of Moscow, and University of Pennsylvania. He was a member of multiple learned societies and served as president of the American Historical Association in 1903.

==Early life and education==
Lea was born on September 19, 1825, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Isaac Lea and Frances Anne Carey. His father was a publisher and amateur scientist.

Through private tutors including the mathematician Eugenius Nulty. Lea received a classical education. It covered the trivium (grammar, logic and rhetoric), quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music and celestial navigation), classical languages and history. Nulty immersed Lea in a single subject for long periods with a view to mastery, with advanced lessons. Lea also demonstrated a facility for languages and analytical thought. In 1832, he studied for a brief time at a school in Paris, France. Lea worked too in the Booth &amp; Boy chemical laboratory, and he published his first paper, at age 13, on manganese salts.

Lea received an LLD from Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.

Lea followed his father&#x27;s interest in natural history and wrote several papers on descriptive conchology. He discovered and named 133 new species of mollusks and two new genera. He also displayed drawing talent and illustrated his own early articles about fossil shells that he had collected. His drawings were also used for the engravings illustrating his father&#x27;s revision of the &quot;Synopsis of the Naiades&quot; in 1838. Lea developed an interest in poetry and at his mother&#x27;s suggestion, translated Greek poets and composed original verse. Later, he often wrote satirical parodies of popular songs about politics.

==Career==
===Publisher===

In 1843, Lea joined his father&#x27;s publishing business as a clerk and became a junior partner in 1851.

In 1847, after working in the family publishing firm for four years, Lea suffered a nervous breakdown and abandoned his intellectual and scientific work for eleven years. Silas Weir Mitchell treated him, and became a family friend. During his convalescence, Lea began reading French memoirs of the medieval period. They kindled his interest in medieval history and changed his career course from scientist to historian.

Lea focused the firm on medical and scientific publications. The company operated under several names including Lea Brothers &amp; Co., Lea &amp; Febinger and Blanchard &amp; Lea in 1865. He continued to work with the firm until 1880 when his sons took over the business.

===Civic activism and philanthropy===

In 1844, Lea stood guard with a musket for two days and two nights in front of a Catholic Church to prevent property damage during the Philadelphia nativist riots.

He was a member of the Union League of Philadelphia at its inception in 1862 and served on the Board of Directors, the Military Committee and the Committee of Publications. He wrote many of the pamphlets published by the organization. In 1863 Lea was appointed one of the Bounty Commissioners under the Enrollment Act and served until 1865, working closely with Provost Marshal General James B. Fry accounting for the city&#x27;s quotas of enlisted men. He was also involved with recruiting African American regiments to fight in the Union army.

He served as president of the Philadelphia branch of the American Social Science Association and as a member of the Industrial League. In 1871, he organized the Citizens&#x27; Municipal Reform Association of Philadelphia which focused on fighting corruption in city government. He served on the board of directors for the Philadelphia Library.

Outspoken about public works and health projects in Philadelphia, Lea founded the Lea Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Pennsylvania. He strongly opposed the building of City Hall at the Penn Square location at the intersection of Broad and Market Streets, then known as High Street, where it now stands, preferring instead that it be built in Washington Square, near Independence Hall. Lea believed that the project cost too much, and was angered by the political corruption involved in the awarding of contracts and purchase of building materials. Lea planned and held a large public meeting to recruit support for his alternative to the Penn Square project.

He helped initiate the National Republican League to prevent Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s third term as president of the United States. The National Republican League chose Lea as its president in 1880 (the year he retired from his publishing business) and five years later, Lea served as president of the Association of Republicans and Independents. In 1891 he helped found &quot;The Reform Political League of Pennsylvania&quot;, with Herbert Welsh as president, himself and Justus C. Strawbridge as vice-presidents, and Charles E. Richardson as secretary.

Lea joined with others in 1884 and filed a lawsuit to oppose building a large slaughterhouse on the Schuylkill River at 30th and Spruce Streets on land owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, citing the pollution of the river, the stench, and devaluation of properties near the plant. He also opposed the construction of the Market Street elevated train, over properties he owned on Market Street, as well as building the &quot;boulevard&quot; from City Hall northwest to Fairmount Park, where the Philadelphia Museum of Art was later built.

In 1888, Lea doubled the size of the reading rooms and book shelves at the Philadelphia Library. In 1897, he built several buildings for the Pennsylvania Epileptic Hospital and Colony Farm in Oakbourne, Pennsylvania.

===Historian===

Lea focused on church history in the later Middle Ages, and on institutional, legal, and ecclesiastical history, as well as magic and witchcraft. He also did significant work on the history of the Italian city-states. His active writing career on historical subjects spanned more than fifty years, during which Lea published ten books and numerous articles. His literary reputation rests largely on those books. Highly disciplined work habits (and the ability to purchase manuscripts in Europe and Latin America and have them shipped to Philadelphia) led Lea to continue writing despite headaches and eye problems. His productivity increased during his final twenty-five years after he retired as a publisher and built an extension to his house at 2000 Walnut Street, for his extensive manuscript collection.

Lea became an authority on the Spanish Inquisition, and his multi-volume work was considered groundbreaking, although opinionated, and some criticized him for anti-Catholic bias. Lea received honorary degrees from universities including Harvard, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania in the United States, and overseas institutions such as the University of Giessen and the University of Moscow. His study of the Inquisition was also criticized for anti-Spanish bias, which Julián Juderías in 1914 termed the &#x27;leyenda negra&#x27; (a/k/a Black legend).

He was a member of multiple historical societies including the Royal Academy of Bavaria, the Comenius-Gesellschaft of Berlin, the Reale Accademia dei Lincei of Rome, the Societa Internazionale di Studi Francescani of Assisi, the Reale Societa Roman della Storia Patria, the Royal Society of Arts in London, the Royal Society of Antiquities in Scotland, the Jewish Historical Society of England and a corresponding fellow of the British Academy.

Lea became a member of the newly formed &quot;American Historical Association&quot; in 1884, contributed several articles to its &quot;American Historical Review&quot;, and was elected its president in 1903. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1888. When the second annual meeting of the newly formed American Folklore Society was held in Philadelphia in 1889, Lea met with some of the founders, sent an article for publication in the Society&#x27;s journal, and became the first life-member of the organization.

==Personal life==

His father, Isaac Lea (1792–1886) was a distinguished naturalist and member of the &quot;American Philosophical Society&quot;, and publisher. Isaac Lea was descended from a Philadelphia Quaker family, and had been born in Wilmington, Delaware. On March 8, 1821, Isaac married Frances Anne Carey (1799–1873), daughter of Mathew Carey, the Philadelphia publisher whose business he ultimately took over.

On May 27, 1850, Henry Charles Lea married his first cousin and orphan Anna Caroline Jaudon (1824–1912). Her father, merchant William Latta Jaubon (1798–1832) of Bucks County, Pennsylvania had died in Cincinnati, Ohio when she was a child, followed four years later by her mother, Susan Gibson Lea Jaudon (1799–1836). The Jaudons were a wealthy Huguenot family from Soubise, France, and after the Edict of Nantes Peter Jaudon emigrated to Bucks County (and his family became Presbyterians), and Elie Jaudon emigrated to South Carolina. Perhaps the most noteworthy members were the teacher Daniel Jaudon (1767–1826, Anna Caroline&#x27;s grandfather) and the financier Samuel Jaudon. Two years later Lea&#x27;s brother Matthew Carey Lea married her sister Elizabeth (1827–1881), whose husband merchant William Bakewell had died in Cincinnati in 1850, leaving her with a young daughter. The Leas had three sons (who succeeded their father in the publishing business) and a daughter: Francis Henry Lea (1851–1902), Charles Matthew (1853–1886), Anna (Nina) Lea (1855–1927) and Arthur Henry Lea (1859–1939).

In 1878, Lea became seriously ill and was almost blind. He was invalid from 1880 to 1884 and used that time to revisit his literary interests.

==Death and legacy==

Lea died of pneumonia on October 24, 1909, in Philadelphia and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery.

In 1914, the Henry C. Lea Elementary School in Philadelphia was named in his honor.

His personal collection of purchased manuscripts and incunabula as well as other early printed books was bequeathed to the University of Pennsylvania. In 1925, the university dedicated a library, which it named in his honor and which includes much of that personal collection of books and manuscripts. Since 1962, the collection has been located in the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center which is now a part of the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts.

In 1933, Lea&#x27;s son Arthur donated four Greek vases that belonged to his father to the Penn Museum.

<text>Théodore Reinach (3 July 186028 October 1928) was a French archaeologist, mathematician, lawyer, papyrologist, philologist, epigrapher, historian, numismatist, musicologist, professor, and politician.

==Academic career==

Educated at the Lycée Condorcet, Ecole des Hautes Etudes, Ecole des Sciences Politiques, Reinach had a brilliant career as a scholar and was called to the Parisian bar where he practised from 1881 to 1886 but eventually devoted himself to the study of numismatics. He became chair in ancient numismatics at the Collège de France and was a director of various journals. In 1916, he was awarded the medal of the Royal Numismatic Society and in 1917, during World War I, he worked on assignment in the United States.

He wrote important works on the ancient kingdoms of Asia Minor: (1888), (1890); (Paris), and also a critical edition and translation with Henri Weil of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Music&quot;; and an (2nd ed., 1901).

From 1888 to 1897 Théodore Reinach edited the &quot;.&quot;

He received an honorary Doctorate of Letters (D.Litt.) from the University of Dublin in June 1902.

Théodore Reinach was president of the French association of musicologists Société française de musicologie in 1928.

==Family and Villa Kerylos==
In 1886, Reinach married Charlotte Marie Evelyne Hirsch. They had two daughters but she died at age twenty-six in 1889. Reinach married a second time in 1891 to Fanny Kann, a daughter of Maximilien Kann and Betty Ephrussi. They made their home in a chateau at La Motte-Servolex in the Savoie department in southeastern France. As a resident there, Reinach was elected to the Chamber of Deputies of France as a member of the Bloc des gauches, serving from 1906 to 1914.

The Reinachs spent time on the French Riviera and in 1902 hired the architect Emmanuel Pontremoli to design a villa at Beaulieu-sur-Mer. Completed in 1908 the Greek-style property was named Villa Kerylos.

Fanny Reinach died in 1917 and Theodore in 1928. He was a member of the Institut de France and on his death he bequeathed the Villa Kerylos to the Institut.

Reinach&#x27;s son, Léon (1893–1943), became the keeper of the archives at Villa Kerylos. Léon Reinach was married to Béatrice de Camondo with whom he had two children. Following the German occupation of France during World War II, the Villa was seized by the Nazis and Léon and Béatrice Reinach and their two children were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp where they were murdered.

After the War, other of the Reinach children and grandchildren continued to live there until 1967. Today, the Villa Kerylos is a museum open to the public.

Fanny Reinach&#x27;s mother was a member of the Ephrussi family whose great-uncle Maurice was married to Béatrice de Rothschild. Inspired by the beauty of the Reinach&#x27;s Villa Grecque Kérylos and the area, nearby they built Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild.

<text>Riven: The Sequel to Myst is a puzzle adventure video game, the second in the &quot;Myst&quot; series of games. Developed by Cyan Worlds, it was initially published by Red Orb Entertainment, a division of Broderbund. &quot;Riven&quot; was distributed on five compact discs and released for Mac and Windows personal computers on October 31, 1997, in North America; it was later released on a single DVD-ROM in 1998. &quot;Riven&quot; was also ported to several other platforms. The story of &quot;Riven&quot; is set after the events of &quot;Myst&quot;. Having been rescued from the efforts of his sons, Atrus enlists the help of the player character to free his wife from his power-hungry father, Gehn. &quot;Riven&quot; takes place almost entirely on the Age of Riven, a world slowly falling apart due to Gehn&#x27;s destructive rule.

Development of &quot;Riven&quot; began soon after &quot;Myst&quot; became a success, and spanned more than three years. In an effort to create a visual style distinct from that of &quot;Myst&quot;, director Robyn Miller and his brother, producer Rand Miller, recruited former &quot;Aladdin&quot; production designer Richard Vander Wende as a co-director. Broderbund employed a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign to publicize the game&#x27;s release.

&quot;Riven&quot; was praised by reviewers, with the magazine &quot;Salon&quot; proclaiming that the game approaches the level of art. Critics positively noted the puzzles and immersive experience of the gameplay, though publications such as &quot;Edge&quot; felt that the nature of point-and-click gameplay limited the title heavily. The best-selling game of 1997, &quot;Riven&quot; sold 1.5 million copies in one year. After the game&#x27;s release, Robyn Miller left Cyan to form his own development studio, ending the professional partnership of the two brothers. Rand stayed at Cyan and continued to work on &quot;Myst&quot;-related products including &quot;The Myst Reader&quot; and the real-time rendered game &quot;&quot;. The next entry in the &quot;Myst&quot; series, &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;, was developed by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft. A remake of the game, recreating the world in fully explorable 3D and supporting both normal and virtual reality, was released in June 2024.

==Gameplay==

Like its predecessor, &quot;Riven&quot; is a point and click adventure game played from a first-person perspective. The player explores immersive environments depicted through a large series of computer generated stills using mouse clicks for movement or to manipulate objects within reach. By operating mechanical contraptions and deciphering codes and symbols discovered in the surroundings, the vaguely explained goal can eventually be reached.

To navigate the world, the player clicks in the direction they want to walk or turn. The cursor changes in appearance, depending on its position on the screen and what it is hovering over, to show what effect clicking will have. For instance, if the player positions the cursor hand near the side of the screen, it may show a pointing finger, indicating that clicking will turn the view in that direction. The cursor changes in context to show when players can drag or toggle switches, or when certain items can be picked up and carried. Such items can then be examined at any time, and either reveal clues to puzzles or provide information on the game&#x27;s setting and story. Like &quot;Myst&quot;, &quot;Riven&quot; has an optional method of navigation known as Zip Mode, which allows players to skip to areas already explored, but may cause them to miss important clues.

&quot;Riven&quot; has more complex and numerous puzzles than its forerunner and is set in a larger virtual world for players to explore. Whereas in &quot;Myst&quot; the objective of the game is to travel to different Ages to solve puzzles before returning to a &quot;hub Age&quot;, &quot;Riven&quot;″s gameplay takes place on the five islands of the Age of Riven. Much of it consists of solving puzzles to access new areas of the islands, though players are also able to explore without fulfilling objectives. The volcanic landscape depicted, with its steep cliffs and crater lakes, is bestrewn with mechanical, Victorian-style artifacts such as elevators, pipes, levers and roller coaster-like transports. To solve the game, players must consider the purpose and physical principles of these artifacts as well as their role in the fictional culture.

==Plot==
&quot;Riven&quot;″s story continues where &quot;Myst&quot; and its companion novel, &quot;The Book of Atrus&quot;, left off. Atrus knows the ancient art of creating &quot;linking books&quot;, specially written books that serve as portals to other worlds known as &quot;Ages&quot;. Atrus needs the player&#x27;s help to free his wife, Catherine, who is held hostage in her home Age of Riven, which is slowly collapsing. Her captor is Gehn, Atrus&#x27; manipulative father and self-declared ruler of Riven. Thirty years earlier, Atrus and Catherine trapped Gehn on Riven by removing all of the linking books that led out of the Age. The final book they escaped from Riven with, leading to the Age of Myst, fell into the Star Fissure, a rift leading out of the damaged Age of Riven into a mysterious, space-like void. The linking book was not destroyed but was instead found by the player, leading to the events of &quot;Myst&quot;. Catherine was later tricked into returning to Riven by her sons, Sirrus and Achenar, whereupon she was taken hostage by Gehn.

At the beginning of &quot;Riven&quot;, Atrus equips the player with a trap book—a snare that functions as a one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book—and his personal diary summarizing the events leading to the present situation. Atrus cannot explain in depth as he is engaged in rewriting the descriptive book of Riven, in an attempt to slow its deterioration. The player must enter Riven with no way of leaving, as Atrus cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned, lest he use it to escape. With the instructions of trapping Gehn, freeing Catherine, and signaling Atrus, the player links to Riven.

Once there, the player travels across the islands of Riven, encountering Catherine, Gehn, and the Moeity, rebels fighting against Gehn&#x27;s rule. Because of the decay of Riven&#x27;s structure, the only way to clearly signal Atrus is to further destabilize the Age—accomplished by reopening the Star Fissure, which Gehn had closed. When it is opened, Atrus links to Riven to investigate, and meets the player at the brink of the fissure. Depending on the player&#x27;s actions, the ending to &quot;Riven&quot; varies. In the best (and canonical) ending, the player tricks Gehn into the prison book and releases Catherine, who helps the Rivenese people evacuate to another Age. Atrus and Catherine thank the player before linking back to Myst. The player then falls into the Star Fissure to be taken back to their world. The worst ending involves signaling Atrus without either capturing Gehn or releasing Catherine, which allows Gehn to kill Atrus and the player, then take Atrus&#x27;s linking book to Myst, leaving the Rivenese people to die in the rapidly collapsing Age as he escapes. Other endings include capturing Gehn without saving Catherine, being trapped in the prison book, or being killed by Gehn after angering him.

==Development==

Cyan began work on &quot;Riven&quot; in 1993, after &quot;Myst&quot;″s release. Before development began, when the name of the game was undecided, the brothers Robyn and Rand Miller said they wanted a &quot;natural flow&quot; from the first game to the sequel. As &quot;Myst&quot; proved to be a popular and commercial success, the two developers were able to expand their four-person team to a much larger crew of designers, artists, programmers, and sound designers. Development spanned more than four years, and was a much larger undertaking than for the first game; &quot;Riven&quot; had a budget of between US$5 and $10 million, more than ten times the cost of developing &quot;Myst&quot;.

The design for &quot;Riven&quot; stemmed from a desire to create something different and more dynamic than the romantic style of &quot;Myst&quot;. At an early point, the game&#x27;s world was to be called Equiquay. The first stage of development was to create the puzzles, in an attempt to integrate them as smoothly as possible into the areas in the game. The Millers met their co-designer, Richard Vander Wende, at a demonstration of &quot;Myst&quot; for the Digital World Expo in Los Angeles. Vander Wende had previously worked for ILM, and at Disney as a designer for the animated feature &quot;Aladdin&quot;. As the third member of &quot;Riven&quot;″s conceptual team, Vander Wende ended up contributing what Robyn Miller described as an &quot;edgier&quot; and complementary vision, that made the game dramatically different from its predecessor.

===Graphics===
As in &quot;Myst&quot;, the topography of the islands was originally created as grayscale images, where brightness corresponded to elevation. In Softimage, these maps were turned into the terrain models seen in the game. The large island objects were broken apart to facilitate efficient rendering, which required them to be created using polygonal geometry. All other objects were modeled using B-splines and NURBS.

Many of the textures were accumulated during a three-day trip to Santa Fe, New Mexico. The artists took hundreds of photos of wood, adobe, sand, stucco and other materials, which were treated in Photoshop before being mapped onto the 3D geometry. Whereas many computer-generated environments of the time ended up looking smooth, like plastic, the Millers and Vander Wende developed a more gritty and weathered design, with corroded and aged elements, to imply reality. The artists considered how objects would look and function if they were real, where and how they would be worn, and created corresponding details. While bump maps were occasionally used to simulate geometry, even small details such as screws were often individually modeled.

Rendering was executed in Mental Ray, using numerous custom-made shaders to produce lifelike lighting, water and landscapes. Wireframes also served as a guide to model the backgrounds. In total &quot;Riven&quot; has over three hours of video and almost five thousand images; rendering was a major bottleneck in production despite the use of 18 dedicated workstations. Some scenes consisted of tens of thousands of individual models and textures and more than a hundred virtual light sources. Loading a single island model could take two hours. Runtime animation effects were created by Mark DeForest, to add flying insects and simple water ripples.

&quot;Riven&quot; combined the pre-rendered backgrounds with live action footage, in order to increase the player&#x27;s immersion level. &quot;Riven&quot; was the first game in which any of its designers had directed live actors, and Vander Wende was apprehensive about their use. Rand Miller had to reprise his role of Atrus from &quot;Myst&quot;, even though he hated acting. All the actors were filmed with a blue screen as a backdrop, which was removed in post-production by chroma key, so that the actors would blend into the virtual environment. Real world stairs, doorways and studio lights had to be meticulously positioned on the live stage to match their CG equivalents. Some sequences were seamlessly cut together with morphing, to allow for partial variations due to the nonlinearity of the gameplay.

===Audio===
Robyn Miller composed &quot;Riven&quot;″s music, which was later packaged and released by Virgin Records as &quot;Riven: The Soundtrack&quot;. Miller designed the liner notes and packaging, which included English translations of the language found in the game. Whereas the music to &quot;Myst&quot; was, at first, only available by mail-order from Cyan, Virgin Records had bought the rights to release it initially, prompting Miller to make sure that it could stand alone in CD form. The compact disc was released on February 24, 1998, with 54 minutes of music.

Miller established three leitmotifs for the game&#x27;s three central characters, Atrus, Catherine, and Gehn. Gehn&#x27;s theme is only heard in its complete form near the end of the game, but portions of the melody can be heard throughout Riven, highlighting his control of the Age. Miller tried to let the environment dictate the resulting sound in order to make the music as immersive as possible. He blended live instrumentation with synthesizers: &quot;By mixing and matching conventional instrumentation, you can create an odd, interesting mood,&quot; Miller said. Ultimately, he wanted the music of &quot;Riven&quot; to reflect the game itself, which he described as having &quot;a familiar-yet-strange feel to it.&quot;

Miller described his biggest challenge in writing &quot;Riven&quot;″s music as reconciling the linear, pleasing construction of music with the nonlinearity of the gameplay. As players can freely explore all areas, Miller explained in an interview, &quot;the music can&#x27;t say anything too specific. If it says something, if it builds in intensity and there starts to be a climax, and people are just standing in a room looking around, and they&#x27;re thinking &#x27;What&#x27;s going on in here? Is something about to jump out from behind me?&#x27; You can&#x27;t have the basic parts of music that you&#x27;d like to have, you can&#x27;t have a basic structure. It&#x27;s all got to be just flowing, and continue to flow.&quot; Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine argued that the soundtrack is &quot;appealingly atmospheric&quot;, but &quot;lacks definition&quot;, and that the music loses impact when separated from the game.

==Release==
At the time of &quot;Riven&quot;″s development, publisher Broderbund was facing falling revenues as development costs rose. Two years into the project, Cyan still had nothing they could show them. Broderbund&#x27;s stock dropped from $60 a share to $22 in 1996, because of &quot;Riven&quot;″s delay from the original planned holiday 1996 window. &quot;Riven&quot; was released in North America and the United Kingdom to retail on October 31, 1997. While &quot;Riven&quot;″s sales were expected to be higher than any other game that holiday season, Broderbund launched a multimillion marketing campaign and developed a retail marketing partnership with Toshiba America. Anticipation for the game was high even among non-gamers, helped by web-based word of mouth and well-placed media coverage.

Sunsoft, who previously developed and published &quot;Myst&quot; for the Sega Saturn, were initially set to publish the Saturn version of &quot;Riven&quot; in PAL regions, but the rights were later picked up by Acclaim Entertainment. A potential conversion of &quot;Riven&quot; to the Atari Jaguar never materialized.

PC Data reported it as the best-selling computer game in the United States during 1997, despite its having only been on the market for less than three months. &quot;Myst&quot; or &quot;Riven&quot; held the number one and two spots on the PC Data sales charts from June 1997 until January 1998. By April, &quot;Riven&quot; had sold over 1 million units and earned $46.2 million in revenue domestically, which led PC Data to declare it the fifth-best-selling computer game in the United States between January 1993 and April 1998. Sales surpassed 1.5 million units within a year of its release. By 2001, over 4.5 million units had been sold. Acclaim Entertainment cited &quot;Riven&quot; as one of their best-selling PlayStation releases up to that time.

==Reception==
&quot;Riven&quot; was generally positively received by critics, with the PC version garnering an average critic score of 83/100 at Metacritic. Jeff Segstack of GameSpot gave the game high marks, explaining that it is &quot;a leisurely paced, all-encompassing, mentally challenging experience. If you enjoyed &quot;Myst&quot;, you&#x27;ll thoroughly enjoy &quot;Riven&quot;.&quot; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that the graphics were the best they had seen in any adventure game. &quot;GamePro&quot; said that it &quot;retains the ambiance of &quot;Myst&quot;, but new features, such as increased use of animation and live action footage, create even more believable environments.&quot; The reviewer gave it a 4.5 out of 5 in graphics and a perfect 5.0 in every other category (sound, control, and funfactor), and predicted that it would both surpass the expectations of &quot;Myst&quot; fans and draw in many new enthusiasts to the series. Laura Miller of &quot;Salon&quot; declared that &quot;Art [...] is what &quot;Riven&quot; approaches,&quot; and praised the gameplay as having &quot;a graceful elegance that reminds [her] of a masterfully constructed novel.&quot; The game&#x27;s sound and graphics were consistently praised. &quot;Macworld&quot;″s Michael Gowan highlighted the game&#x27;s &quot;rich, engrossingly mysterious world&quot;, and he argued that the quality of its storytelling made &quot;Riven&quot; &quot;more like a good novel than a computer game.&quot;

Nevertheless, several publications found fault with aspects of &quot;Riven&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; felt that the gameplay was too similar to the original &quot;Myst&quot;, making &quot;Riven&quot; the &quot;same game with a new title&quot;; the magazine also criticized the minimal character interaction. Gaming magazine &quot;Edge&quot; felt that although &quot;Riven&quot; was a good game, the solitary atmosphere and lack of mobility was steadily becoming outdated, as games like &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; sacrificed graphical fidelity for an increase in freedom. They stated &quot;the question is whether Cyan can incorporate its almost Tolkien-esque world-building skills into a more cutting-edge game vehicle next time.&quot; Even long-time players of the &quot;Myst&quot; games, such as Heidi Fournier of Adventure Gamers, felt that a few puzzles were too difficult; &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, meanwhile, believed that the story clues were too symbolic and scant, which made following the plot difficult. &quot;Next Generation&quot; commended &quot;Riven&quot; for being highly accessible to the general public rather than just experienced gamers, but also said the puzzles, while an improvement over those of &quot;Myst&quot;, were still not well-integrated into the story, making them feel like arbitrary obstacles to progress.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (EGM) and &quot;GamePro&quot; both positively reviewed the PlayStation port, remarking that &quot;Riven&quot; is very specific to the player&#x27;s taste, with a slow pace, intricate plot, vast size, and often frustrating set of puzzles that would likely infuriate traditional action gamers but engross the more patient player. Kelly Rickards and Shawn Smith of &quot;EGM&quot; argued that while the game is superficially very similar to &quot;Myst&quot;, subtle elements such as the greater amount of interaction and better puzzle design make it more appealing, and that anyone with an open mind should give it a try. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it the same scores as the PC version, excepting only that the graphics category dropped to a 4.0 out of 5. John Broady of &quot;GameSpot&quot;, however, said that while the developers had done the best they could with converting the game, the limitations of the PlayStation made it fall far short of the PC original, with dithered scenery, muddy video sequences, and long load times. He concluded that &quot;Playing &quot;Riven&quot; on the PlayStation is sort of like watching &quot;Star Wars&quot; on a 13 TV; you&#x27;ll get the point but you&#x27;re definitely missing something.&quot;

Despite the success of the game, the Miller brothers eventually pursued other projects. Robyn Miller said: &quot;I think it would be a detriment to always, for the rest of our lives, be creating &quot;Myst&quot;-like projects. [...] We&#x27;re going to change, evolve and grow, just like any person does in any manner.&quot; Robyn would leave Cyan to form a new development company called Land of Point; Vander Wende would also leave to pursue other projects. The next video game entry in the &quot;Myst&quot; franchise would be 2001&#x27;s &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;, which was not developed by Cyan nor published by Broderbund. Presto Studios took over development; Ubisoft acquired Broderbund&#x27;s entertainment library from The Learning Company (formerly SoftKey) and published the Myst sequels.

The reviewer from &quot;Pyramid&quot; #29 (Jan./Feb., 1998) stated that &quot;&quot;Myst&quot;, and now &quot;Riven&quot;, are worlds to be explored, with complex puzzles to be solved, and without time limitations or enemies to worry about. Take all the time you like; the basic problems of the game will still be there, waiting for you to solve them.&quot;

At the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Riven&quot; won the award for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics&quot;, and received nominations for &quot;Interactive Title of the Year&quot;, as well as console and personal computer genre awards for &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot;.

==Remake==
Cyan announced plans to release a remake of &quot;Riven&quot; on the game&#x27;s 25th anniversary on October 31, 2022. Like the 3D remake of &quot;Myst&quot;, this version of &quot;Riven&quot; features fully explorable 3D environments. Cyan had attempted to use the original &quot;Riven&quot;&#x27;s models but found they were too low-resolution, instead recreating the world using Unreal Engine 5. They reached out to The Starry Expanse project, a fan-driven effort to recreate &quot;Riven&quot;, about a year prior to the announcement, working out a deal to work with members of that team to use their efforts within the remake of &quot;Riven&quot;. The few cases where characters were shown through full-motion video from the original game were remade using computer-generated characters coupled with motion capture, as the original video quality was poor and did not include full-screen shots of the characters. While Miller reprised the voice of Atrus on new audio, the game uses the original audio performance by Keston, who had died in 2022, using an actor to recapture his mannerisms for Gehn. While the islands of Riven are recreated faithfully with respect to the original game, some of the placement used for point-and-click movement did not work for a fully 3D traversable landscape, and were repositioned to work better. Further, some puzzles feature random solutions that change on starting a new game, making it impossible to jump ahead with prior knowledge of &quot;Riven&quot;″s solutions, while other puzzles were completely reworked to be less difficult for new players to the game.

The game was released on June 25, 2024 for Windows and macOS, as well as with virtual reality support for the Meta Quest. The remake received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews according to Metacritic, with an aggregate score of 86/100 from 32 reviews. The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated the &quot;Riven&quot; remake for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Direction&quot; at the 28th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards.

<text>The Ahom script or Tai Ahom Script is an abugida that is used to write the Ahom language, a dormant Tai language undergoing revival spoken by the Ahom people till the late 18th-century, who established the Ahom kingdom and ruled the eastern part of the Brahmaputra valley between the 13th and the 18th centuries. The old Ahom language today survives in the numerous manuscripts written in this script currently in institutional and private possession.

== History ==
It is believed that the Ahom people adopted their script from either Old Mon or Old Burmese, in Upper Myanmar before migrating to the Brahmaputra Valley in the 13th century. This is supported based on similar shapes of characters between Ahom and Old Mon and Old Burmese scripts. It is clear, however, that the script and language would have changed during the few hundred years it was in use. The Lik Tai script featured on a 1407 Ming dynasty scroll exhibits many features of the Burmese script, including fourteen of the nineteen consonants, three medial diacritics and the high tone marker. According to the scholar Daniels, this shows that the Tai borrowed from the Burmese script to create their own script; the Lik Tai script was derived from the Burmese script, as it could only have been created by someone proficient in Burmese. Daniels also argues that, unlike previously thought, the Lik Tho Ngok script is not the origin of the other Lik Tai scripts, as the 1407 Lik Tai script shows greater similarity to the Ahom script, which has been attested earlier than the Lik Tho Ngok script. Other &quot;Lik&quot; scripts are used for the Khamti, Phake, Aiton and Tai Nuea languages, as well as for other Tai languages across Northern Myanmar and Assam, in Northeast India. The Lik scripts have a limited inventory of 16 to 18 consonant symbols compared to the Tai Tham script, which possibly indicates that the scripts were not developed for writing Pali. 

The earliest coins minted in the Ahom script and language were made during the reign of Subinphaa (1281-1293 AD). Samples of writing in the Ahom Script (Buranji&#x27;s) remain stored in Assamese collections. The manuscripts were reportedly traditionally produced on paper prepared from agarwood (locally known as &quot;sachi&quot;) bark. Assamese replaced Ahom during the 17th century.

The various Burmese scripts that the Ahom script itself is derived from, was likely derived from the Indic, or Brahmi script, and possibly of South Indic origin. The Brahmic Script gradually spread to Southeast Asia (from the more western and/or northern regions of South Asia), through ports on trading routes. At these trading posts, ancient inscriptions have been found in Sanskrit, using scripts like the Brahmic Script, among others. At first, inscriptions were made in Sanskrit, Pali or various other Prakirts, but later the scripts were used to write the local Southeast Asian languages along with local varieties of the scripts being developed. By the 8th century, the scripts had diverged and separated into regional scripts. 

The Ahom script is no longer used by the Ahom people to read and write in everyday life. However, it retains cultural significance and is used for religious chants and to read literature. Ahom&#x27;s literary tradition provides a window into the past, of Ahom&#x27;s culture. A printed form of the font was developed in 1920, to be used in the first &quot;Ahom-Assamese-English Dictionary&quot;.

== Letters ==
Like most abugidas, each letter has an inherent vowel of /a/. Other vowels are indicated by using diacritics, which can appear above, below, to the left, or to the right of the consonant. The script does not, however, indicate tones used in the language. The Ahom script is further complicated as it contains inconsistencies; a consonant may be written once in a word, but pronounced twice, common words may be shortened, and consecutive words with the same initial consonant may be contracted.
===Consonants===

The following medial consonant diacritics are used to form consonant clusters with /l/ and /r/, such as /kl/ and /kr/.

===Vowels===
The following vowel diacritics are added to an initial consonant:

To write a consonant without a vowel, the virama is used.

== Punctuation ==
The following characters are used for punctuation:

== Numerals ==
The Ahom script contains its own set of numerals:

==Unicode==

Ahom script was added to the Unicode Standard in June, 2015 with the release of version 8.0. The Ahom block was expended by 16 code points with Unicode 14.0.

The Unicode block for Ahom is U+11700–U+1174F:

<text>Idiazabal is a pressed cheese made from unpasteurized sheep milk, usually from Latxa and Carranzana sheep in the Basque Country and Navarre regions of Spain. It has a somewhat smokey flavor, but is usually un-smoked.

The cheese is handmade and covered in a hard, dark brown, inedible rind. It is aged for a few months and develops a nutty, buttery flavor, eaten fresh, often with quince jam. If aged longer, it becomes firm, dry and sharp and can be used for grating.

The Denomination of Origin for Idiazabal cheese was created in 1987 and defines the basic regulations for the product&#x27;s manufacture. Typically, unpasteurized milk from latxa breed of sheep is used, although in some cases the D.O. permits the use of milk from Carranzana breed, from the Encartaciones in Biscay. The D.O. also stipulates that the milk be curdled with the natural lamb rennet, and permits external smoking of the cheese. The cheeses produced in the following towns in accordance with all the D.O. regulations, are therefore also protected by the Idiazabal D.O. : Urbia, Entzia, Gorbea, Orduña, Urbasa and Aralar. Recently some Basque Country farmers have begun to use hybrid Assaf sheep, which some maintain does not meet the Denomination of Origin for the cheese.

==Production process==
Idiazabal is an aged cheese, from semi-cured to cured, made exclusively from whole unpasteurized sheep&#x27;s milk. It is produced by strong enzymatic coagulation. The pressed paste can be either uncooked or semi-cooked. It can eventually be externally smoked.

The milk used to produce Idiazabal must be whole unpasteurized, with a minimum of 6% fat. The milk coagulates at a temperature of , with the addition of natural lamb curd, resulting in a compact curdle after 30 to 45 minutes.

The curdle is cut in order to obtain rice-size grains, and then reheated to . In the case of coagulation at higher temperatures, the reheating temperature can reach . The reheated and shrunken paste dehydrates and is placed in molds where it may or may not be seasoned before pressing. Salting of the cheese is performed by rubbing the rind with dry salt or immersing the cheese in highly salted water for 24 hours. Finally, the cheeses are aged under cold and humid conditions avoiding mold, for at least two months.

The optional smoking takes place at the end of the aging process, using woods from the beech-tree, birch-tree, cherry tree or white pine. The intensity of the smoked qualities depends upon the type of wood and length of smoking. The cheeses are usually cylindrical in shape, although they are occasionally cone- or octagonal-shaped. The rinds of artisan cheeses may be engraved with drawings or symbols characteristic of the Basque culture. The rind is closed, smoked, waxy, without mold. The unsmoked cheeses have a yellow-beige color, while smoked cheeses are brownish.

The interior is compact, without air pockets or with only pin-head size holes, and is beige or pale yellow in color. The interior of the smoked cheeses has a brownish border. The taste is strong and pronounced, slightly acidic and piquant, buttery and consistent, with a characteristic sheep milk flavor. The smoked version is somewhat drier and stronger, with a pleasant aroma. The size of every cheese ranges from small to medium, with weights between .

<text>Dough is a malleable, sometimes elastic paste made from grains or from leguminous or chestnut crops. Dough is typically made by mixing flour with a small amount of water or other liquid and sometimes includes yeast or other leavening agents, as well as ingredients such as fats or flavourings.

Making and shaping dough begins the preparation of a wide variety of foodstuffs, particularly breads and bread-based items, but also including biscuits, cakes, cookies, dumplings, flatbreads, noodles, pasta, pastry, pizza, piecrusts, and similar items. Dough can be made from a wide variety of flour, commonly wheat and rye but also maize, rice, legumes, almonds, and other cereals or crops.

== Types of dough ==
Doughs vary widely and may be enriched with eggs and fats. There is no formal definition of what makes dough, though most doughs have viscoelastic properties.

There are several general classes of dough:

* Yeast-leavened doughs are used to make various types of bread including bread rolls, loaves and some types of flatbread. Not all yeast doughs require kneading. High-hydration doughs like ciabatta and focaccia may be folded to develop gluten or not kneaded at all. The addition of milk, salt, fats, eggs, sugar or other ingredients will produce bread products of varying texture. Commercial bread dough may also include dough conditioners, which help make the dough and the final product more consistent. Gluten gives bread dough its structure and texture. Gluten-free or low-gluten doughs may need additional considerations.

* Doughs with higher fat content that contain less water develop less gluten and are therefore generally less elastic than bread doughs. They tend to become tough when they are kneaded. These doughs are often called &quot;short&quot; by bakers. Examples include many cookie and pie doughs such as shortcrust pastry. 

* Quick breads use leavening agents other than yeast (such as baking powder or baking soda), and include most cookies, cakes, biscuits, and more. These may be based on a batter or a dough.

* Laminated dough such as mille-feuille and puff pastry are flour doughs folded over fat to create layers and rolled out. The folding and rolling process can be repeated to create very thin layers of dough and butter to create the puff pastry. There are many different techniques to create laminated doughs and some like paratha are relatively simple while others like mille-feuille are more laborious. Most laminated doughs are leavened only by the steam created by the folding process. Danish pastry and croissant are sometimes considered a separate class of dough because they are made from laminated dough that is leavened with yeast.

* Choux pastry is a steam-leavened dough used for some types of sweet pastries, notably cream puffs, eclairs, some homemade funnel cakes, tulumba and churros. Unlike most other pastry doughs, the ingredients for the dough are cooked on the stovetop before the dough is baked until achieving the consistency of a thick paste. Choux means cabbage in French. It is thought that the name comes from the shape of the cream puffs made with choux paste.

* Some dumpling and pasta doughs are similar enough that experts have difficulty distinguishing them, although dumpling is a very general category that overlaps with others like yeasted breads and batter biscuits. Varying the ratio of liquid and flour in a basic pasta dough may create a softer dough like that used for the German soup noodle spaetzle. Eggs are a very common addition to make the dough moist and easier to roll out. The dough can be filled or shaped various ways and boiled, baked, steamed or fried.

* Gluten free doughs like rice noodles and Japanese harusame noodles depend on the gelatinization of starch for structure.

* Unleavened bread is made not only from wheat but in many cultures has been made from locally available starchy ingredients like corn, oats and cassava since the earliest times. 

Sometimes meringue is considered a dough. The English recipe for &quot;Satin Biscuit&quot; dates to 1677, and earlier recipes are known by different names. Some included flour like a 1604 recipe for &quot;white bisket bread&quot;.

== Techniques ==
Techniques used in dough production depend on the type of dough and final product.

For yeast-based and sponge (such as sourdough) breads, a common production technique is the dough is mixed, kneaded, and then left to rise. Many bread doughs call for a second stage, where the dough is kneaded again, shaped into the final form, and left to rise a final time (or proofed) before baking. Kneading is the process of working a dough to produce a smooth, elastic dough by developing gluten. This process is both temperature and time-dependent; temperatures that are either too hot or too cold will cause the yeast to not develop, and rising times that are either too short or too long will affect the final product.

Pasta is typically made from a dry dough that is kneaded and shaped, either through extrusion, rolling out in a pasta machine, or stretched or shaped by hand (as for gnocchi or dumplings). Pasta may be cooked directly after production (so-called &quot;fresh pasta&quot;) or dried, which renders it shelf-stable.

Doughs for biscuits and many flatbreads which are not leavened with yeast are typically mixed but not kneaded or left to rise; these doughs are shaped and cooked directly after mixing.

While breads and other products made from doughs are often baked, some types of dough-based foods are cooked over direct heat, such as tortillas, which are cooked directly on a griddle. Fried dough foods are also common in many cultures.

Pancakes, waffles, some kinds of bar cookies such as brownies, and many cakes and quick breads (including muffins and the like) are often made with a semi-liquid batter of flour and liquid that is poured into the final shape, rather than a solid dough. Unlike bread dough, these batters are not stabilized by the formation of a gluten network.

<doc id="334547" wikidata="Q471542" url="?curid=334547" title="Kishore Kumar">
<text>Kishore Kumar (born Abhas Kumar Ganguly; ; 4 August 1929 – 13 October 1987) was an Indian playback singer, musician and actor. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest, most influential and dynamic singers in the history of modern Indian music. Kumar was one of the most popular singers in the Indian subcontinent, notable for his yodelling and ability to sing songs in different voices. He used to sing in different genres but some of his rare compositions, considered classics, were lost in time. In 2013, Kumar was voted &quot;The Most Popular Male Playback Singer&quot; in a poll conducted by the Filmfare magazine. 

Besides Hindi, he sang in many other Indian languages, including Bengali, Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada, Bhojpuri, Malayalam, Odia and Urdu. He also released a few non-film albums in multiple languages, especially in Bengali, which are noted as all-time classics. According to his brother and legendary actor Ashok Kumar, Kishore Kumar was successful as a singer because his &quot;voice hits the mike, straight, at its most sensitive point&quot;.

He won 8 Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer out of 28 nominations and holds the record for winning and nominating the most Filmfare Awards in that category. He was awarded the Lata Mangeshkar Award by the Madhya Pradesh government in 1985. In 1997, the Madhya Pradesh Government initiated an award called the &quot;Kishore Kumar Award&quot; for contributions to Hindi cinema. In 2012, his unreleased last song sold for 15.6 lakh ($185,000 USD) at the Osian&#x27;s Cinefan Auction in New Delhi.

==Early life==

Kishore Kumar was born in a Bengali Brahmin Ganguly family in Khandwa, Central Provinces (now in Madhya Pradesh) as Abhas Kumar Ganguly. His father, Kunjalal Ganguly (Gangopadhyay) was a lawyer and his mother, Gouri Devi came from a wealthy Bengali family and was a home-maker. Kunjalal Gangopadhyaya was invited by the Kamavisadar Gokhale family of Khandwa to be their personal lawyer. Kumar was the youngest of four siblings, the older three being Ashok (the eldest), Sati Devi, and Anoop.

While Kumar was still a child, his brother Ashok became an actor in Hindi cinema. Later, Anoop also ventured into cinema with Ashok&#x27;s help. Kumar graduated from Christian College, Indore.

==Early career==
After Ashok Kumar became a star of Hindi films, the Ganguly family visited Bombay (now Mumbai) regularly. Abhas Kumar changed his name to &#x27;Kishore Kumar&#x27; and started his cinema career as a chorus singer at Bombay Talkies, where his brother worked. Music director Khemchand Prakash gave Kumar a chance to sing &quot;Marne Ki Duayen Kyon Mangu&quot; for the film &quot;Ziddi&quot; (1948). After this, Kumar was offered many other assignments, but he was not very serious about a film career. In 1949, he settled in Bombay.

During the initial stage of his career, Kumar was deeply inspired by singer K. L. Saigal and imitated his style of singing in some of his early films but later evolved his own, unique style. He had a great respect for poet and musician Rabindranath Tagore who influenced him in many ways.

He was an ardent admirer of Hollywood actor-singer Danny Kaye. He hung the portraits of all these three personalities at his &quot;Gouri Kunj&quot; residence and would bow respectfully before them everyday as a rule.

In his later career, Kumar was also heavily influenced by playback singer Ahmed Rushdi and his liking towards Rushdi was to the extent that former paid a tribute at Royal Albert Hall in London to the latter by singing some of his songs.

Kumar employed yodelling in many of his songs including; &quot;Yeh dil na hota bechara&quot;, &quot;Zindagi ek safar hai suhana&quot;, and &quot;Chala jata hoon&quot;. The style eventually became an essential feature of his singing and was inspired by Jimmie Rodgers and Tex Morton.

In the movie &quot;Half Ticket&quot;, for one of the songs – &quot;Aake Seedhi Lagi Dil Pe&quot; – the music director Salil Chowdhary had a duet in mind and wanted Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar to sing the song. However, since Lata Mangeshkar was not in town and Salil Chowdhury had to record that song before she could return, Kumar solved the problem by singing both the male and female parts of the song himself. The duet is actually for Pran and Kumar on the screen dressed as a woman. It just turned out to be fine as he did admirably well singing both in male and female voices.

Music director S. D. Burman is credited with spotting Kumar&#x27;s talent for singing. During the making of &quot;Mashaal&quot; (1950), Burman visited Ashok&#x27;s house, where he heard Kumar imitating K. L. Saigal. He complimented him and told him that he should develop a style of his own, instead of copying Saigal. Kumar eventually developed his own style of singing, which featured yodelling, which he had heard on the records of Tex Morton and Jimmie Rodgers.S. D. Burman kept making Kishore sing for Dev Anand from the 50s to the early 70s. S. D. Burman provided him the training and encouraged Kumar a lot, especially in the late 50s and early 60s, resulting in Kumar developing into a great singer in the future years.

S. D. Burman recorded Kumar&#x27;s voice for Dev Anand&#x27;s &quot;Munimji&quot; (1954), &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1954), &quot;House No. 44&quot; (1955), &quot;Funtoosh&quot; (1956), &quot;Nau Do Gyarah&quot; (1957), &quot;Paying Guest&quot; (1957), &quot;Guide&quot; (1965), &quot;Jewel Thief&quot; (1967), &quot;Prem Pujari&quot; (1970), and &quot;Tere Mere Sapne&quot; (1971). He also composed music for Kumar&#x27;s home production &quot;Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi&quot; (1958). Some of their songs were &quot;Maana Janaab Ne Pukara Nahin&quot; from &quot;Paying Guest&quot; (1957), &quot;Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke&quot; from &quot;Nau Do Gyarah&quot; (1957), &quot;Ai Meri Topi Palat Ke Aa&quot; from &quot;Funtoosh&quot; (1956), and &quot;Ek Ladki Bheegi Bhaagi Si&quot; from &quot;Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi&quot;. Asha Bhosle and Kishore performed duets composed by Burman including &quot;Chhod Do Aanchal&quot; from &quot;Paying Guest&quot; (1957), &quot;Ankhon Mein Kya Ji&quot; from &quot;Nau Do Gyarah&quot; (1957), &quot;Haal Kaisa Hai Janaab Ka&quot; and &quot;Paanch Rupaiya Baara Aana&quot; from &quot;Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi&quot; (1958) and &quot;Arre Yaar Meri Tum Bhi Ho Gajab&quot; from &quot;Teen Deviyan&quot; (1965).

As a singer, Kumar&#x27;s work with many music directors in this period includes &quot;Ye Raatein Ye Mausam&quot; and &quot;Hum Toh Mohabbat Karega&quot; from &quot;Dilli Ka Thug&quot;, &quot;Piya Piya Mora Jiya&quot; from &quot;Baap Re Baap&quot;, &quot;Hello Hello Ji&quot; from &quot;Bombay Ka Chor&quot;, &quot;Michael Hai To Cycle Hai&quot; from &quot;Bewaqoof&quot;, &quot;Ae Haseeno Nazneeno&quot; from &quot;Chacha Zindabad&quot;, &quot;Zaroorat Hai Zaroorat Hai&quot; from &quot;Manmauji&quot; (1961), &quot;Likha Hai Teri Ankhon Mein&quot; from &quot;Teen Deviaan&quot;, &quot;Suno Jaana Suno Jaana&quot;, &quot;Pyaar Baatke Chalo&quot; and &quot;Kya Teri Zulfein Hai&quot; from &quot;Hum Sab Ustaad Hai&quot;, &quot;Khoobsurat Haseena&quot; from &quot;Mr. X in Bombay&quot;, &quot;Gaata Rahe Mera Dil&quot; from &quot;Guide&quot; (1965), &quot;Sultana Sultana&quot; from &quot;Shreeman Funtoosh&quot;, &quot;Machalti Hui&quot; from &quot;Ganga Ki Lahren&quot;, &quot;Mera Dil Meri Jaan&quot; and &quot;Pyar Ka Jaahan Hotel&quot; from &quot;Jaalsaaz&quot; and &quot;Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara&quot; from &quot;Jewel Thief&quot; (1967).

Music director C. Ramchandra also recognised Kumar&#x27;s talent as a singer. They collaborated on songs including &quot;Eena Meena Deeka&quot; from &quot;Aasha&quot; (1957). Kumar&#x27;s work includes &quot;Nakhrewaali&quot; from &quot;New Delhi&quot; (1956) by Shankar Jaikishan, &quot;C.A.T. Cat Maane Billi&quot; and &quot;Hum To Mohabbat Karega&quot; from &quot;Dilli Ka Thug&quot; (1958) by Ravi, and &quot;Chhedo Na Meri Zulfein&quot; from &quot;Ganga Ki Lahren&quot; (1964) by Chitragupta.

In 1968, Rahul Dev Burman worked with Kumar on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Padosan&quot; (1968), in which Kumar sang &quot;Mere Saamne Wali Khidki Mein&quot; and &quot;Kehna Hai.&quot; &quot;Padosan&quot; was a comedy featuring Kishore as a dramatist-musician, Mehmood as a Carnatic music and dance teacher, and Sunil Dutt as a simpleton named Bhola. Kishore&#x27;s character was inspired by his uncle, Dhananjay Bannerjee, a classical singer. The highlight of the film was a musical, comical duel between Kumar, Sunil Dutt and Mehmood: &quot;Ek Chatur Nar Karke Singaar.

In 1969, Shakti Samanta produced and directed &quot;Aradhana&quot;. Kumar sang three songs in the film; &quot;Mere Sapnon Ki Rani&quot;, &quot;Kora Kagaj Tha Ye Man Mera&quot; and &quot;Roop Tera Mastana&quot;. Shakti Samanta suggested that Kumar sing the other songs too. When the film was released, Kumar&#x27;s three songs established him as a leading playback singer of Hindi cinema. Kumar won his first Filmfare award for &quot;Roop Tera Mastana&quot;.

==Acting career==

Kumar&#x27;s first film appearance was in &quot;Shikari&quot; (1946), in which his brother, Ashok played the lead role. Kumar played the lead in the Bombay Talkies film &quot;Andolan&quot; (1951), directed by Phani Majumdar. Although he got some acting assignments with the help of his brother, he was more interested in becoming a singer. But Ashok wanted Kumar to be an actor like him. Between 1946 and 1955, Kumar appeared in 22 films, of which 16 were flops; since he was uninterested in taking up acting as a career, he found ways to be in the bad books of the director or producer, so that they would throw him from their films. It was only after the success of films such as &quot;Ladki&quot;, &quot;Naukari&quot;, &quot;Miss Mala&quot;, &quot;Char Paise&quot; and &quot;Baap Re Baap&quot; that Kumar developed an interest in acting seriously, which resulted in him having successful films as the lead actor between 1955 and 1966.

Kumar starred in Bimal Roy&#x27;s &quot;Naukari&quot; (1954) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Musafir&quot; (1957). Salil Chowdhury, the music director for &quot;Naukari&quot;, was initially dismissive of Kumar as a singer when he found that Kumar had no formal training in music. However, after hearing his voice, Chowdhury gave him the song &quot;Chhota Sa Ghar Hoga&quot;, which was supposed to be sung by Hemant Kumar.
The commercially successful films of Kumar included &quot;Ladki&quot; (1953), &quot;Naukari&quot; (1954), &quot;Baap Re Baap&quot; (1955), &quot;Paisa Hi Paisa&quot; (1956), &quot;New Delhi&quot; (1956), &quot;Naya Andaz&quot; (1956), &quot;Bhagam Bhaag&quot; (1956)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Bhai Bhai&quot; (1956), &quot;Aasha&quot; (1957), &quot;Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi&quot; (1958), &quot;Dilli Ka Thug&quot; (1958), &quot;Jaalsaaz (1959)&quot;, &quot;Bombay Ka Chor (1962)&quot;, &quot;Chacha Zindabad (1959)&quot;, &quot;Man-Mauji&quot; (1962), &quot;Jhumroo&quot; (1961), &quot;Half Ticket&quot; (1962), &quot;Mr. X in Bombay (1964)&quot;, &quot;Shreeman Funtoosh&quot; (1965), &quot;Ek Raaz (1963)&quot;, &quot;Ganga Ki Lahren (1964)&quot;, &quot;Hum Sab Ustaad Hai&quot; (1965), &quot;Haal E Dil&quot;, &quot;Pyar Kiye Jaa (1966)&quot;, and &quot;Padosan&quot; (1968). As an actor, his best period was between 1954 and 1966. His onscreen pairing with actresses Mala Sinha, Vyjayanthimala, Nutan, Madhubala, Meena Kumari and Kumkum gave the biggest hits in his career.

&quot;Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi&quot; (1958), his home production, had the three Ganguly brothers and Madhubala in main roles. Kumar played a car mechanic who has a romance with a city girl; (Madhubala) with a subplot involving the brothers. Kumar acted in and composed the music for &quot;Jhumroo&quot; (1961), and wrote the lyrics for the film&#x27;s title song, &quot;Main Hoon Jhumroo&quot;. Later, he produced and directed &quot;Door Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein&quot; (1964), where he starred with Bengali actress Supriya Devi. He also wrote the script and composed music for the film, which is about the relationship between a father (Kumar) and his deaf and mute son (played by his real-life son Amit Kumar).

After 1966, as an actor, Kumar built up a notoriety for coming late for the shootings or bunking them altogether. His films flopped frequently after 1965 and he landed in income tax trouble. Kumar produced and directed some movies in the late 1970s and early 1980s; &quot;Pyar Zindagi Hai&quot;, &quot;Badhti Ka Naam Dadhi&quot; (1978), &quot;Sabaash Daddy&quot;, &quot;Zindagi&quot; (1981), &quot;Door Wadiyon Mein Kahin&quot; (1980) and &quot;Chalti Ka Naam Zindagi&quot; (1982)which was his last appearance as an actor.

===Indian Emergency===
During the Indian Emergency (1975–1977), Sanjay Gandhi asked Kishore to sing for an Indian National Congress rally in Bombay, but he refused. As a result, Information and broadcasting minister Vidya Charan Shukla (1975–1977) put an unofficial ban on playing Kumar songs on state broadcasters All India Radio and Doordarshan from 4 May 1976 till the end of Emergency.

==Later years==
Kishore Kumar&#x27;s son Amit Kumar became a singer in Hindi cinema in 1974 with the song &quot;Apne Bas Ki Baat Nahi&quot;, composed by Kumar for the film &quot;Badthi Ka Naam Daadi&quot;. Amit Kumar became popular with success of the song &quot;Bade Achche Lagte Hai&quot;. Kishore continued singing for several actors even in 1980s. Kumar performed stage shows right from 1969 to earn money to pay his income tax arrears. Kumar stopped singing for Amitabh Bachchan in the year 1981, after Bachchan refused to appear as a guest in the film &quot;Mamta Ki Chhaon Mein&quot;, which Kishore produced. Kishore declined to give voice for Amitabh in &quot;Naseeb&quot;, &quot;Coolie&quot;, &quot;Mard&quot;. Kishore said he would give his voice to Randhir Kapoor in the film &quot;Pukar&quot;, also starring Amitabh. Since Kishore shared good rapport with R. D. Burman, he agreed to sing in &quot;Mahaan&quot;, &quot;Shakti&quot; and &quot;Bemisal&quot;. He also agreed to Amitabh for the superhit films &quot;Sharabi&quot; and &quot;Geraftaar&quot;, at the request of Bappi Lahiri. Later, Kishore called a truce by singing for Amitabh in a solo song in &quot;Shahenshah&quot; and later in &quot;Toofan&quot;. Kishore sang the song &quot;Mera Geet Adhura Hai&quot; for his production &quot;Mamta Ki Chaon Mein&quot; and picturised the song on Rajesh Khanna. Kishore had directed the film, but died in 1987 and Rajesh Khanna helped Amit Kumar in releasing the film in 1989. He also temporarily stopped singing for Mithun Chakraborty after Yogeeta Bali divorced him and married Chakraborty. However, he later sang for Chakraborty in &quot;Surakshaa&quot; (1979), and in the 1980s in many films, including &quot;Boxer&quot;, &quot;Jaagir&quot;, &quot;Faraib&quot; and &quot;Waqt Ki Awaz&quot;.

In the mid-1980s, Kishore sang for Anil Kapoor in his first Hindi film as a leading man, &quot;Woh Saat Din&quot;. He also recorded for &quot;Mashaal&quot;. (1984), &quot;Janbaaz&quot;.(1986) and &quot;Mr. India&quot;. (1987) for which he recorded the song &quot;Zindagi Ki Yahi Reet Hai Haar Ke Baad Hi Jeet Hai&quot;. He sang duets with Alka Yagnik such as &quot;Tumse Badhkar Duniya Mein Na Dekha&quot; for &quot;Kaamchor&quot; in 1982, &quot;Humnashi Aaake from Ek Daku Saher Mein&quot; and sang &quot;Teri Meri Prem Kahani&quot; in &quot;Pighalta Aasman&quot;. He also recorded for newcomers like Aditya Pancholi for the song &quot;Mere Dil Mein Utar Jana&quot; for the film &quot;Laal Paree&quot; (1991).

Kishore Kumar was highly popular in 80s, winning five Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the films Thodisi Bewafaii (1980), Namak Halaal (1982), Agar Tum Na Hote (1983), Sharaabi (1984), Saagar (1985).

He suffered his first heart attack on 24 January 1981 in Kolkata in the noon hours and within a gap of another four hours, suffered his second heart attack. The first solo song sung by him, after recovery from his two attacks was &quot;Mere Sang Sang Aya&quot; from &quot;Rajput&quot; (1982) and the duet with Asha – &quot;Mausam Bheega Bheega&quot; from &quot;Gehra Zakham&quot;.

Kishore debut singing in Marathi films in 1987 with the song &quot;Ashwini Ye Na&quot; from the movie &quot;Gammat Jammat&quot;.

In the song &quot;Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyar&quot; from &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot;, Kishore sang one song with Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi and Mukesh, the most legendary singers in Hindi films.

Kishore sang over 30 songs with his contemporary Rafi and they were good friends despite the claims of animosity reported in the media.

==Personal life==
Kumar married four times. His first wife was Bengali singer and actress Ruma Guha Thakurta aka Ruma Ghosh. Their marriage lasted from 1950 to 1958.

Kumar&#x27;s relationship with actress Madhubala was the subject of much media attention. Madhubala had worked with Kumar in many films including his home production &quot;Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi&quot; (1958) and &quot;Jhumroo&quot; (1961). According to Madhubala&#x27;s sister Madhur Bhushan, after Madhubala&#x27;s relationship with actor Dilip Kumar faded, Madhubala got involved with Kishore who was going through a divorce with Ruma Guha Thakurta. Their love affair went on for three years through &quot;Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi&quot; and &quot;Half Ticket&quot;. Madhubala was ill and was planning to go to London for treatment. She had a ventricular septal defect (hole in the heart). The couple had a civil wedding in 1960. Kumar reportedly converted to Islam and changed his name to Karim Abdul, but Madhubala&#x27;s sister has refuted such claims, saying that Kumar remained a Hindu. His parents refused to attend the ceremony. The couple also had a Hindu wedding ceremony to please Kumar&#x27;s parents. Their marriage ended with Madhubala&#x27;s death on 23 February 1969.
Kumar&#x27;s third marriage was to Yogeeta Bali, and lasted from 1976 to 4 August 1978. Kumar was married to Leena Chandavarkar from 1980 until his death. He had two sons, Amit Kumar with Ruma, and Sumeet Kumar with Leena Chandavarkar.
Kumar is said to have been paranoid about not being paid. During recordings, he would sing only after his secretary confirmed that the producer had made the payment. On one occasion, when he discovered that his dues had not been fully paid, he appeared on set with makeup on only one side of his face. When the director questioned him, he replied &quot;Aadha paisa to aadha make-up.&quot; (Half make-up for half payment). On the sets of &quot;Bhai Bhai&quot;, Kumar refused to act because the director M. V. Raman owed him 5,000. Ashok Kumar persuaded him to do the scene but when the shooting started, Kishore walked a few paces and said, &quot;Paanch Hazaar Rupaiya&quot; (five thousand rupees) and did a somersault. After he reached the end of the floor, he left the studio. On another occasion, when producer R.C. Talwar did not pay his dues in spite of repeated reminders, Kumar arrived at Talwar&#x27;s residence shouting &quot;Hey Talwar, de de mere aath hazaar&quot; (&quot;Hey Talwar, give me my eight thousand&quot;) every morning until Talwar paid up.

In spite of his &quot;no money, no work&quot; principle, sometimes Kumar recorded free even when the producers were willing to pay. Such films include those produced by Rajesh Khanna and Danny Denzongpa. On one occasion, Kishore helped actor-turned-producer Bipin Gupta by giving him 20,000 for the film &quot;Daal Me Kala&quot; (1964). When actor Arun Kumar Mukherjeeone of the first persons to appreciate Kishore&#x27;s singing talentdied, Kumar regularly sent money to Mukherjee&#x27;s family in Bhagalpur.

According to Kumar&#x27;s eldest son Amit Kumar, Kumar did a lot of charity and free shows for jawans and cancer patients but he never spoke about it. Kumar was a homebody and avoided the trappings of stardom. He was an early riser and went to bed early. He loved authentic Bengali food, and was deeply emotional, a side which he seldom expressed and was also philosophic. Kumar was fond of Biblical films and liked sitting in a cemetery.

The film &quot;Anand&quot; (1971) was originally supposed to star Kishore and Mehmood Ali in the lead. Hrishikesh Mukherjee, the director of the film, was asked to meet Kishore to discuss the project. However, when he went to Kumar&#x27;s house he was driven away by the gatekeeper due to a misunderstanding. Kumarhimself a Bengalihad not been paid for a stage show organised by another Bengali man and had instructed his gatekeeper to drive away this &quot;Bengali&quot;, if he ever visited the house. Consequently, Mehmood had to leave the film as well, and new actors (Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan) were signed up for the film.

Many journalists and writers have written about Kumar&#x27;s seemingly eccentric behaviour. He placed a sign that said &quot;Beware of Kishore&quot; at the door of his Warden Road flat. Once, producer-director H. S. Rawail, who owed him some money, visited his flat to pay the dues. Kumar took the money and when Rawail offered to shake hands with him, reportedly Kishore put Rawail&#x27;s hand in his mouth, bit it and asked &quot;Didn&#x27;t you see the sign?&quot;. Rawail laughed off the incident and left quickly. According to another reported incident, once Kumar was due to record a song for producer-director G. P. Sippy. As Sippy approached his bungalow, he saw Kumar going out in his car. Sippy asked Kumar to stop his car but Kumar increased his speed. Sippy chased him to Madh Island where Kumar finally stopped his car near the ruined Madh Fort. When Sippy questioned his strange behaviour, Kumar refused to recognise or talk to him and threatened to call the police. The next morning, Kumar reported for the recording session. An angry Sippy questioned him about his behaviour the previous day but Kumar said that Sippy must have dreamt the incident and said that he was in Khandwa on the previous day.

Once, a producer went to court to get a decree that Kumar must follow the director&#x27;s orders. As a consequence, he obeyed the director to the letter. He refused to alight from his car until the director ordered him to do so. After filming a car scene in Bombay, Kumar drove until he reached Khandala because the director forgot to say &quot;Cut&quot;. In the 1960s, a financier named Kalidas Batvabbal, who was disgusted with Kumar&#x27;s alleged lack of cooperation during the shooting of &quot;Half Ticket&quot;, reported to the income tax authorities, who raided his house. Later, Kumar invited Batvabbal to his home, asked him to enter a cupboard for a chat and locked him inside. He unlocked Batvabbal after two hours and told him, &quot;Don&#x27;t ever come to my house again&quot;.

Kumar was a loner; in a 1985 interview with Pritish Nandy he said that he had no friendshe preferred talking to his trees instead. Once, when a reporter made a comment about how lonely he must be, Kumar took her to his garden, named some of the trees there and introduced them to the reporter as his closest friends.

== Death ==
By September 1987, Kishore Kumar had decided to retire as he was unhappy with kind of songs and tunes being made by music directors and was planning to return to his birthplace Khandwa.

On 13 October 1987, on his brother Ashok Kumar&#x27;s 76th birthday, he died of a heart attack in Bombay at 4:45 pm. His body was taken to Khandwa for cremation. Kishore had recorded his last song, &quot;Guru Guru&quot;, a duet with Asha Bhosle for the film &quot;Waqt Ki Awaz&quot; (1988) composed by Bappi Lahiri for Mithun Chakraborty and Sridevi, the day before he died.

Kumar&#x27;s funeral procession was one of the largest for a non-political film personality, with an estimated crowd of around 5,000-7,000 people in various en-routes of Bombay including his house in Gauri Kunj, Bandra, Santa Cruz, Linking Road, Khar, Dharavi and R.K. Studios in Chembur, and an even bigger crowd estimated between 90,000 to 1,50,000 when his body had reached his hometown in Khandwa for cremation as per his last wish. .The entire film industry, had plunged into grief and shock due to his untimely passing away with an outpouring of tributes from various veterans from the industry including Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Rajesh Khanna, Pran, Nutan, Manoj Kumar, Vinod Khanna, Rajendra Kumar, Randhir Kapoor, Om Prakash, Vinod Mehra, B.R. Chopra, Suresh Oberoi, Danny Denzongpa, Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Hemlata, Mohammed Aziz, Shabbir Kumar, Bappi Lahiri, R.D. Burman, Kalyanji-Anandji, Ravindra Jain, Sulakshana Pandit, Lalit Pandit, Vijyeta Pandit, Shyamlal Mitra,Anand Bakshi, Gulzar, Khayyam, Balasaheb Thackeray, Salil Chaudhary, Tanuja Mukherjee, Saira Banu, Pradeep Kumar,Poonam Dhillon, Deepti Naval, Mala Sinha, Nadeem-Shravan, Abhijeet Bhattacharya, Alka Yagnik, Vijay Anand, Chetan Anand, Johnny Lever, Amrish Puri, Anu Malik, Javed Akhtar, Salim Khan, Uttam Singh, and many others. 

Recalling the day of Kishore Kumar&#x27;s death and his last lines before he took his last breath, his wife Leena Chandavarkar was quoted as saying:
&quot;On the morning of October 13 (the day Kishore Kumar passed away in 1987), he looked pale and as though in deep sleep. As I went near him, he woke up and asked, &#x27;Did you get scared? Today is my holiday&#x27;.&quot; That day he had several meetings at home. During lunch he told me that we&#x27;d watch the film River of No Return in the evening. A little later, I heard him move furniture in the next room. When I went to see what was happening, I saw him lying on the bed. Nervously he said, &#x27;I&#x27;m feeling weak&#x27;. I ran to call the doctor. He got angry and said, &#x27;If you call the doctor, I&#x27;ll get a heart-attack&#x27;. Those were his last lines. His eyes were wide open and he was breathing out. I thought he was fooling as usual but that was the end.&quot;

==Legacy==
Singers like Kumar Sanu, Abhijeet Bhattacharya, Ayushmann Khurrana, Amit Kumar, Sudesh Bhosale, Vinod Rathod, Roop Kumar Rathod were influenced by Kishore Kumar&#x27;s style of singing. Many other singers like KK, Mohit Chauhan, Shaan, Neeti Mohan, Shilpa Rao have been inspired by Kumar.

Kingdom of Dreams, a project of the Great Indian Nautanki Company jointly owned by Wizcraft International Entertainment and Apra Group launched a musical comedy Jhumroo on 7 April 2012 which is a tribute to Kumar and his legacy to music and Hindi films. The musical comedy features 19 retro songs of Kumar&#x27;s.

Kumar was inducted into the Bollywood Walk of Fame at Bandra Bandstand, where his autograph was preserved.

A statue of Kumar was installed on Southern Avenue, Kolkata on 22 October 2018.

An album titled &quot;Baba Mere&quot; made by Kumar&#x27;s son Amit was released on his 86th birthday. It shows Kumar&#x27;s granddaughter Muktika Ganguly waking up in the middle of the night and in her dreams she meets her grandfather. The album is on a big canvas and is like a film. Amit Kumar termed the album as the greatest tribute to his father Kishore Kumar.

In 2015, the UK-based newspaper &quot;Eastern Eye&quot; placed Kumar fourth in their &quot;Greatest 20 Bollywood Playback Singers&quot; list. Kumar was also included among the top ten most searched Indian singers on Google Search in 2016.

In the &quot;Outlook&quot; Music Poll conducted by Outlook Magazine in June 2010, three songs were tied for the No. 2 place: One was sung by Kishore. The song was &quot;Kuch to log kahenge logon ka kaam hai kehna&quot; (&quot;Amar Prem&quot;, 1972). This poll was published in &quot;Outlook&quot;. The jury included people in the Indian music industry. 

In 2013, Kumar was voted &quot;The Most Popular Male Playback Singer&quot; in a poll conducted by the Filmfare magazine. Kumar won the poll with 38% of the votes. 

Marking the centenary of Hindi Cinema, CNN-IBN conducted a poll about the &quot;Greatest Voice of Hindi Cinema&quot; in which Kishore Kumar won the second place with 33.6% of the votes. The poll saw neck-to-neck competition between Rafi (who ultimately attained victory by a slim margin of 1.72% having gained 35.32%) and Kishore Kumar, followed by Lata Mangeshkar (24.59%), Mukesh (3.33%) and Asha Bhosle (3.16%) respectively. 

There have been appeals to the Government of India to honour the singer-actor posthumously with Bharat Ratna(India&#x27;s Highest Civilian Award).

Manna Dey his contemporary once said that &quot;Kishore had the best voice of all playback singers. He made singing sound so effortless. He had no classical training but could surpass me in a song because of his wonderful musical instinct and natural singing flair.&quot;

Hindi films Playback Singer Asha Bhosle has said that:
::It is impossible for anyone to take Kishore Kumar&#x27;s place. Kishore Kumar was one of a kind. He swayed everyone with his mellifluous voice and even made everyone around him always happy. He has been a true gem to the music industry.

Actor Rajesh Khanna said &quot;Kishore Kumar was my soul and I was his body.&quot;

Actress Vyjayanthimala said:
::I did several films with Kishore Kumar. He was always full of fun and frolic. You couldn&#x27;t really predict what he was up to. It was wonderful working with him. Being a singer, he was so quick in his rhythm and quick in his reflexes while dancing. It was easy to match his steps and he was comfortable with me too. He used to tell me, &#x27;Aap to taal mein karte hai sab to bahut hi achha lagta hai mujhe. Betaali ho jati hai to mushkil padta hai.&#x27; (It&#x27;s nice that you dance in rhythm. It&#x27;s difficult if rhythms don&#x27;t match.)

Hindi film superstar Amitabh Bachchan called Kishore Kumar a multitalented genius who shall remain a phenomenal star.

Former cricketer and batsman Sachin Tendulkar said:
::Kishore Kumar&#x27;s music has been a constant companion of mine and I feel his songs are truly timeless.

Kumar&#x27;s unreleased song was sold for Rs 15.6 lakh at the Osian&#x27;s Cinefan Auction, New Delhi in 2012, the highest price bid for any Indian singer. The song was &quot;Tum hi to woh ho&quot;, written by Kulwant Jani with music by Usha Khanna. This was for a film called &quot;Khel Tamasha&quot; by Rakesh Kumar, which never got made. The song was recorded just three days before his death in October 1987.

<doc id="334549" wikidata="Q804984" url="?curid=334549" title="Balinese script">
<text>The Balinese script, natively known as and , (Balinese: ᬅᬓ᭄ᬱᬭᬩᬮᬶ) is an abugida used in the island of Bali, Indonesia, commonly for writing the Austronesian Balinese language, Old Javanese, and the liturgical language Sanskrit. With some modifications, the script is also used to write the Sasak language, used in the neighboring island of Lombok. The script is a descendant of the Brahmi script, and so has many similarities with the modern scripts of South and Southeast Asia. The Balinese script, along with the Javanese script, is considered the most elaborate and ornate among Brahmic scripts of Southeast Asia.

Though everyday use of the script has largely been supplanted by the Latin alphabet, the Balinese script has a significant prevalence in many of the island&#x27;s traditional ceremonies and is strongly associated with the Hindu religion. The script is mainly used today for copying or palm leaf manuscripts containing religious texts.

== Earliest record ==

===Belanjong pillar===
The Belanjong pillar, also Blanjong pillar or Blanjong inscription (Indonesian: Prasasti Blanjong, Balinese: ᬧ᭄ᬭᬰᬵᬲ᭄ᬢᬶᬩ᭄ᬮᬜ᭄ᬚᭀᬂ), is a pillar established in 914 CE in the harbour of Belanjong, in the southern area of Sanur in Bali. This is the earliest evidence of Balinese literary script and language.

=== Language-script and Date ===

The inscription is written in both the Indian Sanskrit language and Old Balinese language, using two scripts, the Nagari script and the Old Balinese script (which is used to write both Balinese and Sanskrit). The Old Balinese in pre-Nagari script is on one side of the pillar, while the Sanskrit inscription in Pallava-derived old Javanese script (also called Kawi script) is on the other side.

The pillar is dated according to the Indian Shaka era, on the seventh day of the waxing half (&#x27;saptāmyāṁ sita&#x27;) of the month Phalguna of the &quot;Śaka&quot; year 835, which corresponds to 4 February 914 CE as calculated by Louis-Charles Damais.

==Characteristics==
There are 47 letters in the Balinese script, each representing a syllable with inherent vowel or at the end of a sentence, which changes depending on the diacritics around the letter. Pure Balinese can be written with 18 consonant letters and 9 vowel letters, while Sanskrit transliteration or loan words from Sanskrit and Old Javanese utilizes the full set. A set of modified letters are also used for writing the Sasak language. Each consonant has a conjunct form called &quot;gantungan&quot; which nullifies the inherent vowel of the previous syllable.

Punctuation includes a comma, period, colon, as well as marks to introduce and end section of a text. Musical notation uses letter-like symbols and diacritical marks in order to indicate pitch information. Text are written left to right without word boundaries (&quot;Scriptio continua&quot;).

There is also a set of &quot;holy letters&quot; called which appears in religious texts and protective talismans. Most of them are constructed using diacritic with corresponding characters. A number of additional characters, known to be used inline in text (as opposed to decoratively on drawings), remains under study and those characters are expected to be proposed as Balinese extensions in due course.

==Letters==
A basic letter in Balinese is called (), and each letter stands for a syllable with inherent vowel /a/.

=== Consonants ===
Consonants are called () or (). Balinese script has 33 consonants, of which only 18 called () are used for writing basic vocabulary in Balinese language. The other 15, known as (), are mainly used for writing Sanskrit and Kawi loanwords in Balinese language. The consonants can be arranged into Sanskrit order and traditional order.

==== traditional order ====
The modern Balinese languages does not make use of the whole inventory of consonants inherited from Sanskrit. The 18 consonants used in Balinese () are traditionally arranged following the Javanese sequence, in which 20 letters form a four-line pangram narrating the myth of Aji Saka. The remaining consonants () are used in Sanskrit transcription. 


=== Consonant clusters ===

As in other members of the Brahmic family, consonant clusters are written cursively, by combining a consonant an appended letter () or attached letter (). For example, , a appended with is pronounced [nda]. Each consonant letter has a corresponding or . 

A consonant may be marked with both a or and a vowel diacritic (), but attaching two or more to one letter is forbidden. When three consonants occur together, vowel-killer () may be used in the middle of a word. For example, in the word , the consonant cluster &quot;mbl&quot; is spelled .

For a few letters, , , and adding a or also eliminates the letter&#x27;s inherent vowel .

== Vowels ==
Vowels, called () or (), can be written as independent letters when vowels appear in initial position. 
== Diacritics ==

Diacritics ( () are symbols that cannot stand by themselves. When they are attached to the independent letters, they affect the pronunciation. The three types of diacritics are , , and .

=== Vowel diacritics ===
Vowel diacritics () change the inherent vowel of a consonant letter. For example, the letter plus becomes .

 (), except , adds a final consonant to a syllable. It can be used together with . For example, the letter () with () becomes (); () with () and () becomes (). Compared to Devanagari, is analogous to visarga, to anusvara, and to virama.

 is zero vowel diacritics as in other Brahmic scripts in Balinese script. , as virama in Devanagari, suppress the inherent vowel in the consonant letter. is used on impossibility of gantungan and gempelan usage such as succeeded by punctuation marks, attachment of two or more gantungan to one letter (, lit. three layers), preservation of combination (, rather than ) and disambiguation.

=== ===
 () is appended below consonant letters. are the appended () forms of the (semivowel) consonants. is the appended form of the vowel ().

== Numerals ==

Balinese numerals are written in the same manner as Arabic numerals. For example, 25 is written with the Balinese numbers 2 and 5. 
If the number is written in the middle of a text, &quot;carik&quot; has to be written before and after the number to differentiate it from the text. Below is an example of how a date is written using Balinese numerals (date: 1 July 1982, location: Bali): 

== Other symbols ==
There are some special symbols in the Balinese script. Some of them are punctuation marks, and the others are religious symbols. The symbols are described in the following list:

== Orthography ==

=== Balinese language ===

==== Loanword from Sanskrit and Old Javanese ====
Balinese have many loanwords from Sanskrit and Old Javanese. In general, the Balinese orthography in Balinese script preserve the original orthography. The preservation of original orthography result on several rules: 
# assimilation rule, which based on articulation rule (Kalvi / Shiksha),
# () rule, which the word is spelled based on the source,
# () rule, which several words has doubled consonant.

==== Assimilation ====
Assimilation in Balinese occurs within the conjuncts/consonant clusters. Balinese script represents assimilation occurred, however Latin script sometimes may not represent this. In general, alveolar consonants are assimilated into palatal, retroflex or labial. There are more specific descriptions in assimilation combination:
* [n] assimilated into [ɲ] if succeeded by palatal consonants, such as consonant cluster &quot;nc&quot; and &quot;nj&quot; . For example, word is written as (), not written as ().
* [s] assimilated into [ɕ] if succeeded by palatal consonants, such as consonant cluster &quot;sc&quot; . For example, word is written as (), not written as ().
* [d] assimilated into [dʒ] if succeeded by palatal consonants, such as consonant cluster &quot;dny&quot; . For example, word is written as (), not written as ().
* [n] assimilated into [ɳ] if preceded by retroflex consonants, such as consonant cluster &quot;rn&quot; . For example, word is written as (), not written as ().
* [s] assimilated into [ʂ] if succeeded by retroflex consonants, such as consonant cluster &quot;st&quot; (ṣṭ) and &quot;sn&quot; (ṣṇ) . For example, word (, lie) is written as (), not written as ().
* [n] assimilated into [m] if succeeded by labial consonants. For example, word is written as (), not written as ().

==== Liquid Consonant-Schwa Combination ====
Liquid consonant, [r] and [l], may not be combined with (&quot;pepet&quot;, schwa) [ə] as and . These combination, rě [rə] and lě [lə], should be written as (&quot;re repa&quot;) and (&quot;le lenga&quot;). Word &quot;kěrěng&quot; (lit. eat a lot) and &quot;lekad&quot; are written as and . While combination of (&quot;gantungan&quot; [l]) and (&quot;pepet&quot;) is possible as in (&quot;bleganjur&quot;), combination of (&quot;cakra&quot; or &quot;gantungan&quot; [r]) and &quot;pepet&quot; is not allowed. If the combination follows a word which ends in a consonant, (&quot;gempelan re repa&quot;) may be used as in (&quot;Pak Rěrěh&quot;, Mr. Rěrěh). If the combination is in a word, (&quot;guwung macelek&quot;) may be used instead as in (&quot;Krěsna&quot;, Krishna).

==== Latin Script Transliteration ====
Latin script transliteration into Balinese script is based on phonetics. As vocabulary expands, foreign sounds are introduced and have no equivalent on Balinese script. In general, transliteration of foreign sounds is shown as below.

=== Sasak language ===
The Sasak language, spoken in Lombok Island east of Bali, is related to Balinese, is written in a version of the Balinese script known as &quot;Aksara Sasak&quot;, which is influenced by the Javanese script and is given additional characters for loanwords of foreign origin.

==Fonts==
There are some fonts for Balinese script as of 2016. Bali Simbar, Bali Galang, JG Aksara Bali, Aksara Bali, Tantular Bali, Lilitan, Geguratan and Noto Sans Balinese are some fonts that included Balinese script. The fonts have different degree of compatibility each other, and most contain critical flaws.

Bali Simbar is first font for Balinese script by I Made Suatjana Dipl Ing at 1999. Bali Simbar is not compatible for Mac-OS and Unicode. JG Aksara Bali, was designed by Jason Glavy, has over 1400 Balinese glyphs, including a huge selection of precomposed glyph clusters. The latest version of JG Aksara Bali was released on 2003, thus has no compatibility with Unicode. Bali Simbar and JG Aksara Bali, in particular, may cause conflicts with other writing systems, as the font uses code points from other writing systems to complement Balinese&#x27;s extensive repertoire as Balinese script was not included in Unicode at the creation time.

Aksara Bali by Khoi Nguyen Viet is the first hacked Unicode Balinese font with a brute-force OpenType implementation. The results depend on how well other OpenType features are implemented in the renderer. The font has about 370 Balinese glyphs, but does not display the vowel correctly. The team of Aditya Bayu Perdana, Ida Bagus Komang Sudarma, and Arif Budiarto has created a small series of Balinese fonts: Tantular Bali, Lilitan, and Geguratan, all using hacked Unicode and a brute-force OpenType implementation. Tantular has about 400 Balinese glyphs. These all have serious flaws.

Another Unicode font is Noto Sans Balinese from Google. However, Noto Sans Balinese exhibits several critical flaws, such as an inability to correctly display more than one diacritic per consonant.

The free font Bali Galang, maintained by Bemby Bantara Narendra, displays correctly apart from the consonant-spanning vowels and . However, those vowels can be manually substituted by their graphic components, and followed by the length sign (&quot;tedung&quot;), which together display as and . It also automatically assimilates some consonants within words. It displays corresponding Balinese glyphs instead of Latin letters.

== Unicode ==

Balinese script was added to the Unicode Standard in July, 2006 with the release of version 5.0.

The Unicode block for Balinese is U+1B00–U+1B7F:

==Sample texts==
===Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot;===
;Balinese script
;Romanised
;English
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
