Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens (born 18 January 1938) is an English sociologist who is known for his theory of structuration and his holistic view of modern societies. He is considered to be one of the most prominent modern sociologists and is the author of at least 34 books, published in at least 29 languages, issuing on average more than one book every year. In 2007, Giddens was listed as the fifth most cited author of books in the humanities. He has academic appointments in approximately twenty different universities throughout the world and has received numerous honorary degrees.

His works are divided into four stages:

The first one involved outlining a new vision of what sociology is, presenting a theoretical and methodological understanding of that field based on a critical reinterpretation of the classics. His major publications of that era include &quot;Capitalism and Modern Social Theory&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Class Structure of the Advanced Societies&quot; (1973).

In the second stage, Giddens developed the theory of structuration, an analysis of agency and structure in which primacy is granted to neither. His works of that period, such as &quot;New Rules of Sociological Method&quot; (1976), &quot;Central Problems in Social Theory&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Constitution of Society&quot; (1984), brought him international fame on the sociological arena.

The third stage of Giddens&#x27;s academic work was concerned with modernity, globalisation and politics, especially the impact of modernity on social and personal life. This stage is reflected by his critique of postmodernity and discussions of a new &quot;utopian-realist&quot; Third Way in politics which is visible in &quot;The Consequences of Modernity&quot; (1990), &quot;Modernity and Self-Identity&quot; (1991), &quot;The Transformation of Intimacy&quot; (1992), &quot;Beyond Left and Right&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Third Way&quot; (1998).

In the most recent stage, Giddens has turned his attention to a more concrete range of problems relevant to the evolution of world society, namely environmental issues, focusing especially upon debates about climate change in his book &quot;The Politics of Climate Change&quot; (2009); the role and nature of the European Union in &quot;Turbulent and Mighty Continent&quot; (2014); and in a series of lectures and speeches also the nature and consequences of the Digital Revolution.

Giddens served as Director of the London School of Economics from 1997 to 2003, where he is now Emeritus Professor at the Department of Sociology. He is a life fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. According to the Open Syllabus Project, Giddens is the most frequently cited author on college syllabi for sociology courses.

== Biography ==
Born on 18 January 1938, Giddens was born and raised in Edmonton, London, and grew up in a lower-middle-class family, son of a clerk with London Transport. He attended Minchenden Grammar School. He was the first member of his family to go to university. Giddens received his undergraduate academic degree in joint sociology and psychology at the University of Hull in 1959, followed by a master&#x27;s degree at the London School of Economics supervised by David Lockwood and Asher Tropp. He later gained a PhD at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. In 1961, Giddens started working at the University of Leicester where he taught social psychology. At Leicester, he met Norbert Elias and began to work on his own theoretical position. In 1969, Giddens was appointed to a position at the University of Cambridge, where he later helped create the Social and Political Sciences Committee (SPS, now HSPS).

Giddens worked for many years at Cambridge as a fellow of King&#x27;s College and was eventually promoted to a full professorship in 1987. He is cofounder of Polity Press (1985). From 1997 to 2003, he was Director of the London School of Economics and a member of the advisory council of the Institute for Public Policy Research. He was also associated with Tony Blair, but was not a direct advisor. He has also been a vocal participant in British political debates, supporting the centre-left Labour Party with media appearances and articles (many of which are published in &quot;New Statesman&quot;).

He was given a life peerage in June 2004 as Baron Giddens, of Southgate in the London Borough of Enfield and sits in the House of Lords for the Labour Party. He is the recipient of many academic honours.

== Work ==
=== Overview ===
Giddens, the author of over 34 books and 200 articles, essays and reviews, has contributed and written about most notable developments in the area of social sciences, with the exception of research design and methods. He has written commentaries on most leading schools and figures and has used most sociological paradigms in both micro and macrosociology. His writings range from abstract, metatheoretical problems to very direct and &#x27;down-to-earth&#x27; textbooks for students. His textbook, Sociology (9th edition, Polity), has sold over 1 million copies. Finally, he is also known for his interdisciplinary approach. Giddens has commented not only on the developments in sociology, but also in anthropology, archaeology, psychology, philosophy, history, linguistics, economics, social work and most recently political science. In view of his knowledge and works, one may view much of his life&#x27;s work as a form of grand of sociological theory.

=== Nature of sociology ===
Before 1976, most of Giddens&#x27; writings offered critical commentary on a wide range of writers, schools and traditions. Giddens took a stance against the then-dominant structural functionalism (represented by Talcott Parsons) as well as criticising evolutionism and historical materialism. In &quot;Capitalism and Modern Social Theory&quot; (1971), he examined the work of Max Weber, Émile Durkheim and Karl Marx, arguing that despite their different approaches each was concerned with the link between capitalism and social life. Giddens emphasised the social constructs of power, modernity and institutions, defining sociology as such: study of social institutions brought into being by the industrial transformation of the past two or three centuries.&quot;

In &quot;New Rules of Sociological Method&quot; (1976), the title of which alludes to Durkheim&#x27;s &quot;Rules of the Sociological Method&quot; of 1895, Giddens attempted to explain how sociology should be done and addressed a long-standing divide between those theorists who prioritise macro-level studies of social life—looking at the big picture of society—and those who emphasise the micro level—what everyday life means to individuals. In &quot;New Rules&quot;, he noted that the functionalist approach invented by Durkheim treated society as a reality unto itself not reducible to individuals. He rejected Durkheim&#x27;s sociological positivism paradigm which attempted to predict how societies operate, ignoring the meanings as understood by individuals. Giddens noted: &quot;Society only has form, and that form only has effects on people, insofar as structure is produced and reproduced in what people do.&quot;

Giddens contrasted Durkheim with Weber&#x27;s approach—interpretative sociology—focused on understanding agency and motives of individuals. In his analysis, he rejects both of those approaches, stating that while society is not a collective reality, nor should the individual be treated as the central unit of analysis. Rather, he uses the logic of hermeneutic tradition from interpretative sociology to argue for the importance of agency in sociological theory, claiming that human social actors are always to some degree acknowledged about what they are doing. Social order is therefore a result of some pre-planned social actions, not automatic evolutionary response. Unlike natural scientists, sociologists have to interpret a social world which is already interpreted by the actors that inhabit it. According to Giddens, there is a duality of structure by which social practice, the principal unit of investigation, has both a structural and an agency-component. The structural environment constrains individual behaviour, but it also makes it possible. He also noted the existence of a specific form of a social cycle. Once sociological concepts are formed, they filter back into everyday world and change the way people think. Because social actors are reflexive and monitor the ongoing flow of activities and structural conditions, they adapt their actions to their evolving understandings. As a result, social scientific knowledge of society will actually change human activities. Giddens calls this two-tiered, interpretive and dialectical relationship between social scientific knowledge and human practices the double hermeneutic. Giddens also stressed the importance of power, which is means to ends, and hence is directly involved in the actions of every person. Power, the transformative capacity of people to change the social and material world, is closely shaped by knowledge and space-time. In &quot;New Rules&quot;, Giddens specifically wrote:
* Sociology is not about a pre-given universe of objects, the universe is being constituted—or produced by—the active doings of subjects.
* The production and reproduction of society thus has to be treated as a skilled performance on the part of its members.
* The realm of human agency is bounded. Individuals produce society, but they do so as historically located actors, and not under conditions of their own choosing.
* Structures must be conceptualised not only as constraints upon human agency, but as enablers as well.
* Processes of structuration involve an interplay of meanings, norms and power.
* The sociological observer cannot make social life available as phenomenon for observation independently of drawing upon his knowledge of it as a resource whereby he constitutes it as a topic for investigation.
* Immersion in a form of life is the necessary and only means whereby an observer is able to generate such characterisations.
* Sociological concepts thus obey a double hermeneutic.

In sum, the primary tasks of sociological analysis are the following:
# The hermeneutic explication and mediation of divergent forms of life within descriptive metalanguages of social science.
# Explication of the production and reproduction of society as the accomplished outcome of human agency.

=== Structuration ===

Giddens&#x27; theory of structuration explores the question of whether it is individuals or social forces that shape our social reality. He eschews extreme positions, arguing that although people are not entirely free to choose their own actions and their knowledge is limited, they nonetheless are the agency which reproduces the social structure and leads to social change. His ideas find an echo in the philosophy of the modernist poet Wallace Stevens, who suggests that we live in the tension between the shapes we take as the world acts upon us and the ideas of order that our imagination imposes upon the world. Giddens writes that the connection between structure and action is a fundamental element of social theory, structure and agency are a duality that cannot be conceived of apart from one another and his main argument is contained in his expression &quot;duality of structure&quot;. At a basic level, this means that people make society, but they are at the same time constrained by it. Action and structure cannot be analysed separately as structures are created, maintained and changed through actions while actions are given meaningful form only through the background of the structure. The line of causality runs in both directions making it impossible to determine what is changing what. In Giddens own words from &quot;New Rules&quot;, he states: structures are both constituted by human agency, and yet at the same time are the very medium of this constitution.&quot;

In this regard, Giddens defines structures as consisting of rules and resources involving human action. Thus, the rules constrain the actions and the resources make it possible. He also differentiates between systems and structures. Systems display structural properties, but they are not structures themselves. He notes in his article &quot;Functionalism: après la lutte&quot; (1976) as follows: &quot;To examine the structuration of a social system is to examine the modes whereby that system, through the application of generative rules and resources is produced and reproduced in social interaction.&quot;

This process of structures producing and re-producing systems is called structuration. Systems here mean to Giddens &quot;the situated activities of human agents&quot; (&quot;The Constitution of Society&quot;) and &quot;the patterning of social relations across space-time&quot; (ibid.). Structures are then &quot;sets of rules and resources that individual actors draw upon in the practices that reproduce social systems&quot; (&quot;Politics, Sociology and Social Theory&quot;) and &quot;systems of generative rules and sets, implicated in the articulation of social systems&quot; (&quot;The Constitution of Society&quot;), existing virtually &quot;out of time and out of space&quot; (&quot;New Rules&quot;). Structuration therefore means that relations that took shape in the structure can exist out of time and place. In other words, independent of the context in which they are created. An example is the relationship between a teacher and a student. When they come across each other in another context, say on the street, the hierarchy between them is still preserved.

Structure can act as a constraint on action, but it also enables action by providing common frames of meaning. Consider the example of language: structure of language is represented by the rules of syntax that rule out certain combinations of words. However, the structure also provides rules that allow new actions to occur, enabling us to create new, meaningful sentences. Structures should not be conceived as &quot;simply placing constrains upon human agency, but as enabling&quot; (&quot;New Rules&quot;). Giddens suggests that structures (traditions, institutions, moral codes and other sets of expectations—established ways of doing things) are generally quite stable, but they can be changed, especially through the unintended consequences of action when people start to ignore them, replace them, or reproduce them differently.

Actors or agents employ the social rules appropriate to their culture, ones that they have learned through socialisation and experience. These rules together with the resources at their disposal are used in social interactions. Rules and resources employed in this manner are not deterministic, but they are applied reflexively by knowledgeable actors, albeit that actors&#x27; awareness may be limited to the specifics of their activities at any given time. Thus, the outcome of action is not totally predictable.

=== Connections between micro and macro ===
Structuration is very useful in synthesising micro and macro issues. On a micro scale, one of individuals&#x27; internal sense of self and identity, consider the example of a family in which we are increasingly free to choose our own mates and how to relate with them which creates new opportunities yet also more work as the relationship becomes a reflexive project that has to be interpreted and maintained. At the same time, this micro-level change cannot be explained only by looking at the individual level as people did not spontaneously change their minds about how to live and neither can we assume they were directed to do so by social institutions and the state.

On a macro scale, one of the state and social organisations like multinational capitalist corporations, consider the example of globalisation which offers vast new opportunities for investment and development, but crises—like the Asian financial crisis—can affect the entire world, spreading far outside the local setting in which they first developed and last but not least directly influences individuals. A serious explanation of such issues must lie somewhere within the network of macro and micro forces. These levels should not be treated as unconnected and in fact they have significant relation to one another.

To illustrate this relationship, Giddens discusses changing attitudes towards marriage in developed countries. He claims that any effort to explain this phenomenon solely in terms of macro or micro level causes would result in a circular cause and consequence. Social relationships and visible sexuality (micro-level change) are related to the decline of religion and the rise of rationality (macro-level change), but with changes in the laws relating to marriage and sexuality (macro) as well, change caused by different practices and changing attitudes on the level of everyday lives (micro). Practices and attitudes in turn can be affected by social movements (for example, women&#x27;s liberation and egalitarianism), a macro-scale phenomena. However, the movements usually grow out of everyday life grievances—a micro-scale phenomenon.

All of this is increasingly tied in with mass media, one of our main providers of information. The media do not merely reflect the social world yet also actively shape it, being central to modern reflexivity. In &quot;Media, Gender and Identity&quot;, David Gauntlett writes:
Another example explored by Giddens is the emergence of romantic love which Giddens (&quot;The Transformation of Intimacy&quot;) links with the rise of the narrative of the self type of self-identity, stating: &quot;Romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative into an individual&#x27;s life&quot;. Although the history of sex clearly demonstrates that passion and sex are not modern phenomena, the discourse of romantic love is said to have developed from the late 18th century. Romanticism, the 18th- and 19th-century European macro-level cultural movement, is responsible for the emergence of the novel—a relatively early form of mass media. The growing literacy and popularity of novels fed back into the mainstream lifestyle and the romance novel proliferated the stories of ideal romantic life narratives on a micro-level, giving the romantic love an important and recognised role in the marriage-type relationship.

Consider also the transformation of intimacy. Giddens asserts that intimate social relationships have become democratised so that the bond between partners—even within a marriage—has little to do with external laws, regulations or social expectations, but instead it is based on the internal understanding between two people—a trusting bond based on emotional communication. Where such a bond ceases to exist, modern society is generally happy for the relationship to be dissolved. Thus, we have &quot;a democracy of the emotions in everyday life&quot; (&quot;Runaway World&quot;, 1999).

A democracy of the emotions—the democratising of everyday life—is an ideal, more or less approximated to in the diverse contexts of everyday life. There are many societies, cultures and contexts in which it remains far from reality—where sexual oppression is an everyday phenomenon. In &quot;The Transformation of Intimacy&quot;, Giddens introduces the notion of plastic sexuality—sexuality freed from an intrinsic connection with reproduction and hence open to innovation and experimentation. What was once open only to elites becomes generalised with the advent of mass contraception as sexuality and identity become far more fluid than in the past. These changes are part and parcel of wider transformations affecting the self and self-identity.

Inevitably, Giddens concludes that all social change stems from a mixture of micro- and macro-level forces.

=== Self-identity ===
Giddens says that in the post-traditional order self-identity is reflexive. It is not a quality of a moment, but instead an account of a person&#x27;s life. Giddens writes:
More than ever before, we have access to information that allows us to reflect on the causes and consequences of our actions. At the same time, we are faced with dangers related to unintended consequences of our actions and by our reliance on the knowledge of experts. We create, maintain and revise a set of biographical narratives, social roles and lifestyles—the story of who we are and how we came to be where we are now. We are increasingly free to choose what we want to do and who we want to be, although Giddens contends that wealth gives access to more options. However, increased choice can be both liberating and troubling. Liberating in the sense of increasing the likelihood of one&#x27;s self-fulfilment and troubling in form of increased emotional stress and time needed to analyse the available choices and minimise risk of which we are increasingly aware, or what Giddens sums up as the manufacturing uncertainty. While in earlier, traditional societies we would be provided with that narrative and social role, in the post-traditional society we are usually forced to create one ourselves. As Giddens puts it: &quot;What to do? How to act? Who to be? These are focal questions for everyone living in circumstances of late modernity—and ones which, on some level or another, all of us answer, either discursively or through day-to-day social behaviour.&quot;

=== Modernity ===
Giddens&#x27; recent work has been concerned with the question of what is characteristic about social institutions in various points of history. Giddens agrees that there are very specific changes that mark our current era. However, he argues that it is not a post-modern era, but instead it is just a &quot;radicalised modernity era&quot; (similar to Zygmunt Bauman&#x27;s concept of liquid modernity), produced by the extension of the same social forces that shaped the previous age. Nonetheless, Giddens differentiates between pre-modern, modern and late or high modern societies and does not dispute that important changes have occurred but takes a neutral stance towards those changes, saying that it offers both unprecedented opportunities and unparalleled dangers. He also stresses that we have not really gone beyond modernity as it is just a developed, detraditionalised, radicalised late modernity. Thus, the phenomena that some have called postmodern are to Giddens nothing more than the most extreme instances of a developed modernity. Along with Ulrich Beck and Scott Lash, he endorses the term &quot;reflexive modernisation&quot; as a more accurate description of the processes associated with the second modernity since it opposes itself in its earlier version instead of opposing traditionalism, endangering the very institutions it created such as the national state, the political parties or the nuclear family.

Giddens concentrates on a contrast between traditional (pre-modern) culture and post-traditional (modern) culture. In traditional societies, individual actions need not be extensively thought about because available choices are already determined (by the customs, traditions and so on). In contrast, in post-traditional society people (actors or agents) are much less concerned with the precedents set by earlier generations and they have more choices, due to flexibility of law and public opinion. However, this means that individual actions now require more analysis and thought before they are taken. Society is more reflexive and aware, something Giddens is fascinated with, illustrating it with examples ranging from state governance to intimate relationships. Giddens examines three realms in particular, namely the experience of identity, connections of intimacy and political institutions.

According to Giddens, the most defining property of modernity is that we are disembedded from time and space. In pre-modern societies, space was the area in which one moved and time was the experience one had while moving. In modern societies, the social space is no longer confined by the boundaries set by the space in which one moves. One can now imagine what other spaces look like even if he has never been there. In this regard, Giddens talks about virtual space and virtual time. Another distinctive property of modernity lies in the field of knowledge.

In pre-modern societies, it was the elders who possessed the knowledge as they were definable in time and space. In modern societies, we must rely on expert systems. These are not present in time and space, but we must trust them. Even if we trust them, we know that something could go wrong as there is always a risk we have to take. Even the technologies which we use and which transform constraints into means hold risks. Consequently, there is always a heightened sense of uncertainty in contemporary societies. It is also in this regard that Giddens uses the image of a juggernaut as modernity is said to be like an unsteerable juggernaut travelling through space.

Humanity tries to steer it, but as long as the modern institutions with all their uncertainty endure, then we will never be able to influence its course. The uncertainty can be managed by reembedding the expert-systems into the structures which we are accustomed to.

Another characteristic is enhanced reflexivity, both at the level of individuals and at the level of institutions. The latter requires an explanation as in modern institutions there is always a component which studies the institutions themselves for the purpose of enhancing its effectiveness. This enhanced reflexivity was enabled as language became increasingly abstract with the transition from pre-modern to modern societies, becoming institutionalised into universities. It is also in this regard that Giddens talks about double hermeneutica as every action has two interpretations. One is from the actor himself, the other of the investigator who tries to give meaning to the action he is observing. However, the actor who performs the action can get to know the interpretation of the investigator and therefore change his own interpretation, or his further line of action.

According to Giddens, this is the reason that positive science is never possible in the social sciences as every time an investigator tries to identify causal sequences of action, the actors can change their further line of action. However, the problem is that conflicting viewpoints in social science result in a disinterest of the people. For example, when scientists do not agree about the greenhouse effect, people would withdraw from that arena and deny that there is a problem. Therefore, the more the sciences expand, the more uncertainty there is in the modern society. In this regard, the juggernaut gets even more steerless as Giddens states:
In &quot;A Contemporary Critique of Historical Materialism&quot;, Giddens concludes:
# There exists no necessary overall mechanism of social change, no universal motor of history such as class conflict.
# There are no universal stages, or periodisation, of social development, these being ruled out by intersocietal systems and &quot;time-space edges&quot; (the ever-presence of exogenous variables) as well as by human agency and the inherent historicity of societies.
# Societies do not have needs other than those of individuals, therefore notions such as adaptation cannot properly be applied to them.
# Pre-capitalist societies are class-divided, but only with capitalism there are class societies in which there is endemic class conflict, the separation of the political and economic spheres, property freely alienable as capital and &quot;free&quot; labour and labour markets.
# While class conflict is integral to capitalist society, there is no teleology that guarantees the emergence of the working class as the universal class and no ontology that justifies denial of the multiple bases of modern society represented by capitalism, industrialism, bureaucratisation, surveillance and industrialisation of warfare.
# Sociology, as a subject pre-eminently with modernity, addresses a reflexive reality.

=== Third Way ===

In the age of late and reflexive modernity and post-scarcity economy, the political science is being transformed. Giddens notes that there is a possibility that &quot;life politics&quot; (the politics of self-actualisation) may become more visible than &quot;emancipatory politics&quot; (the politics of inequality); that new social movements may lead to more social change than political parties; and that the reflexive project of the self and changes in gender and sexual relations may lead the way via the &quot;democratisation of democracy&quot; to a new era of Habermasian &quot;dialogic democracy&quot; in which differences are settled and practices ordered through discourse rather than violence or the commands of authority.

Relying on his past familiar themes of reflexivity and system integration which places people into new relations of trust and dependency with each other and their governments, Giddens argues that the political concepts of left and right are now breaking down as a result of many factors, most centrally the absence of a clear alternative to capitalism and the eclipse of political opportunities based on the social class in favour of those based on lifestyle choices.

Giddens moves away from explaining how things are to the more demanding attempt of advocacy about how they ought to be. In &quot;Beyond Left and Right&quot; (1994), Giddens criticises market socialism and constructs a six-point framework for a reconstituted radical politics:
# Repair damaged solidarities.
# Recognise the centrality of life politics.
# Accept that active trust implies generative politics.
# Embrace dialogic democracy.
# Rethink the welfare state.
# Confront violence.

&quot;The Third Way: The Renewal of Social Democracy&quot; (1998) provides the framework within which the Third Way, also termed by Giddens as the radical centre, is justified. In addition, &quot;The Third Way&quot; supplies a broad range of policy proposals aimed at what Giddens calls the &quot;progressive centre-left&quot; in British politics. According to Giddens: &quot; overall aim of third way politics should be to help citizens pilot their way through the major revolutions of our time: globalisation, transformations in personal life and our relationship to nature.&quot; Giddens remains fairly optimistic about the future of humanity: &quot;There is no single agent, group or movement that, as Marx&#x27;s proletariat was supposed to do, can carry the hopes of humanity, but there are many points of political engagement which offer good cause for optimism.&quot;

Giddens discards the possibility of a single, comprehensive, all-connecting ideology or political programme without a duality of structure. Instead, he advocates going after the small pictures, ones people can directly affect at their home, workplace or local community. To Giddens, this is a difference between pointless utopianism and useful utopian realism which he defines as envisaging &quot;alternative futures whose very propagation might help them be realised&quot; (&quot;The Consequences of Modernity&quot;). By utopian, he means that this is something new and extraordinary, and by realistic he stresses that this idea is rooted in the existing social processes and can be viewed as their simple extrapolation. Such a future has at its centre a more socialised, demilitarised and planetary-caring global world order variously articulated within green, women&#x27;s and peace movements and within the wider democratic movement.

The Third Way was not just a work of abstract theory as it influenced a range of centre-left political parties across the world—in Europe, Latin America and Australasia. Although close to New Labour in the United Kingdom, Giddens dissociated himself from many of the interpretations of the Third Way made in the sphere of day-to-day politics. For him, it was not a succumbing to neoliberalism or the dominance of capitalist markets. The point was to get beyond both market fundamentalism and traditional top-down socialism to make the values of the centre-left count in a globalising world. He argued that &quot;the regulation of financial markets is the single most pressing issue in the world economy&quot; and that &quot;global commitment to free trade depends upon effective regulation rather than dispenses with the need for it&quot;.

In 1999, Giddens delivered the BBC Reith Lectures on the subject of runaway world, subsequently published as a book of that title. The aim was to introduce the concept and implications of globalisation to a lay audience. He was the first Reith Lecturer to deliver the lectures in different places around the world and the first to respond directly to e-mails that came in while he was speaking. The lectures were delivered in London, Washington, New Delhi and Hong Kong and responded to by local audiences. Giddens received the Asturias Prize for the social sciences in 2002. The award has been labelled the Spanish Nobel Prize, but it stretches well beyond the sphere of science. Other recipients of the prize that year included Woody Allen, the inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee and conductor Daniel Barenboim.

== Outside consultancies ==
On two visits to Libya in 2006 and 2007, organised by the Boston-based consultancy firm Monitor Group, Giddens met with Muammar Gaddafi. Giddens has declined to comment on the financial compensation he received. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in March 2011 that Libya&#x27;s government engaged Monitor Group as advisor on matters of public relations. Monitor Group allegedly received 2 million pounds in return for undertaking a &quot;cleansing campaign&quot; to improve Libya&#x27;s image. In a letter to Abdullah Senussi, a high-ranking Libyan official in July 2006, Monitor Group reported as follows:
We will create a network map to identify significant figures engaged or interested in Libya today. ... We will identify and encourage journalists, academics and contemporary thinkers who will have interest in publishing papers and articles on Libya. ... We are delighted that after a number of conversations, Lord Giddens has now accepted our invitation to visit Libya in July.

Giddens&#x27; first visit to Libya resulted in articles in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;El País&quot; and &quot;La Repubblica&quot;, where he argued that the country had been dramatically transformed. In the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Gaddafi&#x27;s &#x27;conversion&#x27; may have been driven partly by the wish to escape sanctions, but I get the strong sense it is authentic and there is a lot of motive power behind it. Saif Gaddafi is a driving force behind the rehabilitation and potential modernisation of Libya. Gaddafi Sr, however, is authorising these processes&quot;. During the second visit, Monitor Group organised a panel of three thinkers (Giddens, Gaddafi, and Benjamin Barber, author of &quot;Jihad vs. McWorld&quot;) chaired by Sir David Frost.

Giddens remarked of his meetings with Gaddafi as such: &quot;You usually get about half an hour with a political leader&quot;. He also recalls the following: &quot;My conversation lasts for more than three. Gaddafi is relaxed and clearly enjoys intellectual conversation. He likes the term &#x27;third way&#x27; because his own political philosophy is a version of this idea. He makes many intelligent and perceptive points. I leave enlivened and encouraged&quot;.

== Theory of reflexivity ==
Giddens introduces reflexivity and in information societies information gathering is considered as a routinised process for the greater protection of the nation. Information gathering is known as the concept of individuation. Individuality comes as a result of individuation as people are given more informed choices. The more information the government has about a person, the more entitlements are given to the citizens. The process of information gathering helps government to identify enemies of the state, singling out individuals that are suspected of plotting activities against the state. The advent of technology has brought national security to a completely new level. Historically, the military relied on armed force to deal with threats. With the development of ICT, biometric scans, language translation, real time programs and other related intelligent programs have made the identification of terrorist activities much easier compared to the past. The analysing of algorithm patterns in biometric databases have given government new leads. Data about citizens can be collected through identification and credential verification companies. Hence, surveillance and ICT goes hand-in-hand with information gathering. In other words, the collection of information is necessary as stringent safeguards for the protection of the nation, preventing it from imminent attacks.

=== Living in a high opportunity, high risk society ===
Giddens has vigorously pursued the theme of globalisation in recent years. He sees the growing interdependence of world society as driven not only by the increasing integration of the world economy, but above all by massive advances in communications. As he has noted when he delivered the BBC Reith Lectures just before the turn of the century, the Internet was in its infancy. However, now it has expanded in a wholly unprecedented way, linking people and organisations across the world on an everyday level as well as intruding deeply into everyday life. Billions of people have access to it and the numbers are growing every day. An increasingly interconnected and wired-up world offers many advantages and benefits, yet it carries new risks too, some themselves of global proportions. In the 21st century, work opportunity and risk combine as never before. Giddens refers to the emergence on a global level of a &quot;high opportunity, high risk society&quot;. Both on the level of opportunity and risk we are in terrain human beings have never explored before. We do not know in advance what the balance is likely to be because many of the opportunities and risks are quite new as we cannot draw on past history to assess them.

Climate change is one of those new risks. No other civilisation before the advent of modern industrialism was able to intervene into nature to even a fraction of the extent to which we do on an everyday basis.

Climate change was referred to in several of Giddens&#x27;s books from the mid-1990s onwards, but it was not discussed at length until the publication of his work &quot;The Politics of Climate Change&quot; in 2009. Giddens says climate change constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given that is the case, he asks why are countries around the world doing so little to counter its advance. Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level today. We have no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract and located at some indefinite point in the future. Giddens&#x27;s paradox consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur, but by then by definition it would be too late, for we have no way of reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world&#x27;s climate. Some such gases would be in the atmosphere for centuries.

Within &#x27;The Politics of Climate Change&#x27; Giddens places attention on global environmental conferences such as the 1997 Kyoto summit, whereby an agreement was drawn up so that developed countries would cut their emissions by an average of 5.2 per cent. The Kyoto protocol was to become a part of international law, and the developed countries who accounted for at least 55 per cent of total emissions from the industrial states, would have to sign up.

In his latest work, Giddens has returned to the subject of the European Union, discussed in 2007 in his book &quot;Europe in the Global Age&quot; and in a diversity of articles. In &quot;Turbulent and Mighty Continent: What Future for Europe?&quot;, he discusses the likely future of the European Union in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Giddens writes as a committed pro-European, but he accepts that fundamental reforms must be made if the European Union is to avoid stagnation or worse. The coming of the euro introduced economic federalism among the eurozone countries and therefore to the European Union as a whole. Some version of political federalism must follow, even if limited in nature. Reforms must confer qualities absent from much of the European Union&#x27;s history, but which are now required for its future such as flexible and quick-acting leadership, coupled to the greater democratic involvement of citizens. However, he also emphasised that European Union &quot;could still founder, even disintegrate, the result of a chain reaction of circumstances that member states were unable to control&quot;. In December 2014, &quot;Turbulent and Mighty Continent&quot; was awarded the European Book Prize, awarded by a selection jury featuring members from many different countries.

In recent years, while continuing to pursue some of the core themes of his earlier works he has become preoccupied with the impact of the Digital Revolution on world society and on everyday life. That revolution, he argues, must not be identified solely with the advent of the internet, extraordinary although that is. Rather, the Digital Revolution is a massive wave of change washing across the world, driven by the interrelation between the Internet, robotics and supercomputers. It is huge algorithmic power—available to the billions of people who already possess smartphones—that connects the other two.

Giddens sees the pace and global scope of such revolution as unprecedented in human history and we are probably only in its early stages. Many see the Digital Revolution as primarily producing endless diversity and as acting to dissolve pre-existing institutions and modes of life. Giddens emphasises that from its beginnings it has been bound up with power and large-scale structures too. It is deeply bound up with American global power and has physical form, depending as it does upon global satellite systems and systems, underground cables and concentrations of supercomputers. GPS has its origins in super-power rivalry between the United States and what was then the Soviet Union. The digital universe is also funded by mass advertising and expresses the dominance of large corporations in the world economy.

The Digital Revolution forms an important part of Giddens&#x27;s recent preoccupation with the emergence of the high opportunity, high risk society. For example, the advent of such revolution promises fundamental advances in core areas of medicine. New threats and problems abound, both in our everyday lives and in the larger institutions of our societies. Scientists can communicate with one-another in a direct way across the world. The overlap of supercomputers and genetics means that genetic structures can be decoded instantaneously, promising huge advances in conquering major diseases. Medical practice is likely to be transformed through remote monitoring and other digital innovations. At the same time, the overlap of the Digital Revolution with criminality, violence and war is pervasive and dangerous. Military drones are just one example of the continuing involvement of the Digital Revolution with war.

Emerging developments in artificial intelligence look likely to propel these changes into a new phase of social transformation, whose outlines at present remain hazy, but which look certain to be quite profound. Supercomputers are becoming more and more powerful in terms of their capacity to handle immense amounts of data while quantum computers, with even greater processing capacity, loom on the horizon. At the same time, deep learning—artificial neural networks capable of innovative thinking—is fast advancing. A world-wide debate is going on about how far artificial intelligence can match, or even surpass, human intellectual capabilities. Artificial intelligence and geopolitics, Giddens says, are converging all over again &quot;as the circle of change comes back to its point of origin&quot;. In the meantime, China is pouring resources into the further development of artificial intelligence and currently possesses the world&#x27;s most advanced supercomputer.

Giddens was a member of the House of Lords Select Committee on artificial intelligence which reported in April 2018. The committee put forward a variety of suggested reforms to apply not only in the United Kingdom, but potentially much more widely as well. These should take place within a common ethical framework to guide intervention on the part of government and of the digital corporations themselves. The power of the digital mega-corporations must be curtailed and subjected to democratic governance, challenging and problematic though such an endeavour is. Artificial intelligence should be developed for the common good. It should follow principles of transparency and fairness and never be allocated the autonomous capability to harm human actors. The major nations and transnational agencies should work towards ensuring that such principles are incorporated into their own codes and practices and applied on a transnational level. The worry is that an artificial intelligence arms race would develop as countries jostle to take the lead both in artificial intelligence generally and in its application to weaponry of diverse sorts. In a much-publicised speech given in 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin observed of advances in artificial intelligence that &quot;whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world&quot;. If there is a jostling for advantage among the major powers, concerns of ethics and safety may fall by the wayside in the scramble for advantage, adding to the stresses and strains already visible in the international order.

== Honours ==
Giddens was appointed to a life peerage on 16 June 2004 as Baron Giddens, &quot;of Southgate in the London Borough of Enfield&quot; and sits in the House of Lords for the Labour Party.

He was elected a member of the Academia Europaea in 1993. He is also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

In 1999, he was made a Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Henry the Navigator by the Portuguese government.

Giddens received the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences in 2002.

In June 2020 it was announced that Giddens had been awarded the Arne Naess Chair and Prize at the University of Oslo, Norway, in recognition of his contributions to the study of environmental issues and climate change.

<text>In mathematics, sociable numbers are numbers whose aliquot sums form a periodic sequence. They are generalizations of the concepts of perfect numbers and amicable numbers. The first two sociable sequences, or sociable chains, were discovered and named by the Belgian mathematician Paul Poulet in 1918. In a sociable sequence, each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the preceding number, i.e., the sum excludes the preceding number itself. For the sequence to be sociable, the sequence must be cyclic and return to its starting point.

The period of the sequence, or order of the set of sociable numbers, is the number of numbers in this cycle.

If the period of the sequence is 1, the number is a sociable number of order 1, or a perfect number—for example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3, whose sum is again 6. A pair of amicable numbers is a set of sociable numbers of order 2. There are no known sociable numbers of order 3, and searches for them have been made up to formula_1 as of 1970.

It is an open question whether all numbers end up at either a sociable number or at a prime (and hence 1), or, equivalently, whether there exist numbers whose aliquot sequence never terminates, and hence grows without bound.

== Example ==

As an example, the number 1,264,460 is a sociable number whose cyclic aliquot sequence has a period of 4:
:The sum of the proper divisors of formula_2 (formula_3) is
::1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 17 + 20 + 34 + 68 + 85 + 170 + 340 + 3719 + 7438 + 14876 + 18595 + 37190 + 63223 + 74380 + 126446 + 252892 + 316115 + 632230 = 1547860,

:the sum of the proper divisors of formula_4 (formula_5) is
::1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 193 + 386 + 401 + 772 + 802 + 965 + 1604 + 1930 + 2005 + 3860 + 4010 + 8020 + 77393 + 154786 + 309572 + 386965 + 773930 = 1727636,

:the sum of the proper divisors of formula_6 (formula_7) is
::1 + 2 + 4 + 521 + 829 + 1042 + 1658 + 2084 + 3316 + 431909 + 863818 = 1305184, and

:the sum of the proper divisors of formula_8 (formula_9) is
::1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 40787 + 81574 + 163148 + 326296 + 652592 = 1264460.

== List of known sociable numbers ==

The following categorizes all known sociable numbers by the length of the corresponding aliquot sequence:

It is conjectured that if &quot;n&quot; is congruent to 3 modulo 4 then there is no such sequence with length &quot;n&quot;.

The 5-cycle sequence is: 12496, 14288, 15472, 14536, 14264

The only known 28-cycle is: 14316, 19116, 31704, 47616, 83328, 177792, 295488, 629072, 589786, 294896, 358336, 418904, 366556, 274924, 275444, 243760, 376736, 381028, 285778, 152990, 122410, 97946, 48976, 45946, 22976, 22744, 19916, 17716 . 

These two sequences provide the only sociable numbers below 1 million (other than the perfect and amicable numbers).

== Searching for sociable numbers ==

The aliquot sequence can be represented as a directed graph, formula_10, for a given integer formula_11, where formula_12 denotes the
sum of the proper divisors of formula_13.
Cycles in formula_10 represent sociable numbers within the interval formula_15. Two special cases are loops that represent perfect numbers and cycles of length two that represent amicable pairs.

== Conjecture of the sum of sociable number cycles ==
It is conjectured that as the number of sociable number cycles with length greater than 2 approaches infinity, the proportion of the sums of the sociable number cycles divisible by 10 approaches 1 .

<text>A merkin is a pubic wig. Merkins were worn by prostitutes after shaving their mons pubis, and are used as decorative items or erotic devices by both men and women.

==History and etymology==
The &quot;Oxford Companion to the Body&quot; dates the origin of the pubic wig to the 1450s. According to the publication, women would shave their pubic hair for personal hygiene and to combat pubic lice. They would then put on a merkin. Also, sex workers would wear a merkin to cover up signs of disease, such as syphilis.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates the first written use of the term to 1617. The word probably originated from &quot;&quot;, a derogatory term for a lower-class young woman, or from &quot;Marykin&quot;, a pet form of the female given name &quot;Mary&quot;.

==Contemporary use==
===Film===
Sometimes in filmmaking, merkins can be worn by actresses to avoid inadvertent exposure of the genitalia during nude or semi-nude scenes. The presence of the merkin protects the actor from inadvertently performing &quot;full-frontal&quot; nudity which can help ensure that the film achieves a less restrictive MPAA rating.

A merkin may also be used when the actor or actress has less pubic hair than is required, as in the nude dancing extras in &quot;The Bank Job&quot;. Amy Landecker wore a merkin in &quot;A Serious Man&quot; (2009) for a nude sunbathing scene; clean shaving was not common in 1967 when the film is set.
*In an interview for &quot;Allure&quot;, Kate Winslet related how she refused to wear a merkin in &quot;The Reader&quot;.
*In an interview, Gina Gershon revealed that she wore a merkin in &quot;Killer Joe&quot;.
*In the director&#x27;s audio commentary of &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;, director David Fincher discussed how a merkin was used for actress Rooney Mara, after she suggested to him that the character she portrayed in the film was a natural redhead in the book and dyed her hair black. Consequently, the merkin she wore was made in the color red. For the release of the movie in Japan, Fincher stated: &quot;I believe in Japan we had to put a mosaic over it because fake pubes are considered to be ... nasty.&quot;
*In Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, the character of the President of the United States, played by Peter Sellers, is bald and is named &quot;Merkin Muffley&quot;.
*In the Italian film &quot;La Pelle&quot; (English: &quot;The Skin&quot;), which takes place during the Allied occupation of Naples after World War II, blond merkins are made for the local prostitutes to pass for blondes for the US soldiers.
*In the film &quot;The Greasy Strangler&quot;, the character Janet wears a merkin.
*In the film &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;, the main character Josie Gellar&#x27;s assistant is named Merkin. The character is portrayed by Sean Whalen.

===Television===
*In the television series &quot;Black Sails&quot;, Jessica Parker Kennedy wore a pubic wig.
*Lucy Lawless was fitted for a merkin for the 2010 TV series &quot;&quot;, but did not use it.

===Other===
*At the São Paulo Fashion Week in 2010, the design firm Neon dressed a nude model in transparent plastic. According to the designer, the model wore a pubic wig to make her appear more natural.
*In 2022, in response to the passing of reforms to the Gender Recognition Act in Scotland, Elaine Miller wearing a pubic wig flashed the Scottish parliament chamber in protest.

<doc id="332317" wikidata="Q4020177" url="?curid=332317" title="William W. Averell">
<text>William Woods Averell (November 5, 1832 – February 3, 1900) was a career United States Army officer and a cavalry general in the American Civil War. He was the only Union general to achieve a major victory against the Confederates in the Valley Campaigns of 1864 prior to the arrival of Philip Sheridan, at the Battle of Rutherford&#x27;s (Carter&#x27;s) Farm and at the Battle of Moorefield.

After the war, Averell was appointed by President Andrew Johnson as a diplomat to British North America, serving 1866 to 1869. Also an entrepreneur and inventor with interests in the coal, steel and related infrastructure industry, Averell became wealthy by inventing an improved technique for laying asphalt pavement.

He co-wrote a history of the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry, Sixtieth Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers during the Civil War years; it was published in 1905. He wrote a memoir of his Army years from 1851 to 1862 but did not publish it and the manuscript was lost for a time. It was discovered in the late 20th century and published in an annotated edition in 1978.

==Early years==
Averell was born in Cameron, New York. As a boy, he worked as a drugstore clerk in the nearby town of Bath.

He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1855 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Mounted Rifles. His early assignments included garrison duty at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, and the U.S. Army Cavalry School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. During two years of service in New Mexico, he was wounded in action against the Indians in October 1858, and was placed on the disabled list until the outbreak of the Civil War.

==Civil War==

After the capture of Fort Sumter, Lt. Averell made a risky solo journey across the country to the Indian Territory with a message to summon his old mounted rifle regiment to the East to join the fighting.

Averell first saw action at the First Battle of Bull Run while acting as assistant adjutant general to Brig. Gen. Andrew Porter. In August 1861, he was appointed colonel of the 3rd Pennsylvania Cavalry regiment, which he led through the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. Immediately after that campaign, on July 6, 1862, he was given command of the 1st Cavalry Brigade in the Army of the Potomac. He missed the Battle of Antietam and most of the Maryland Campaign as he recovered from a bout of malaria; this was known at the time as &quot;Chickahominy Fever&quot;.

As Confederate Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart&#x27;s cavalry rode around the Union Army and raided Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Averell returned in time to lead his brigade in pursuit. President Abraham Lincoln appointed Averell a brigadier general of volunteers on September 26, 1862 to rank from that date. Lincoln had to nominate Averell three times before the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on March 11, 1863.

During the Battle of Fredericksburg, Averell commanded the Cavalry Brigade of the Center Grand Division of the Army of the Potomac. He ascended to division command—the 2nd division of the Cavalry Corps—on February 12, 1863. His division fought the Battle of Kelly&#x27;s Ford on March 17, 1863, notable as the first engagement in which Union cavalrymen claimed victory against their Confederate counterparts. But the 2nd Division&#x27;s reputation was diminished as it participated in Maj. Gen. George Stoneman&#x27;s fruitless cavalry raid in the Battle of Chancellorsville six weeks later. On May 2, 1863, Union Army commander Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker relieved Averell of his command due to his slow performance during the raid. Hooker subsequently sent a report to the Adjutant General that said: &quot;General Averell&#x27;s command numbered about 4,000 sabers and a light battery, a larger cavalry force than can be found in the rebel army between Fredericksburg and Richmond, and yet that officer seems to have contented himself between April 29th, and May 4th, with having marched through Culpeper to Rapidan, a distance of twenty-eight miles, meeting no enemy deserving the name, and from that point reporting to me for instructions.&quot;

Averell left the Army of the Potomac after his relief at Chancellorsville. He fought a series of minor engagements in the Department of West Virginia at the brigade and division level. In November 1863, he conducted what is called Averell&#x27;s West Virginia Raid against the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. He received a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel in the regular army for the Battle of Droop Mountain in West Virginia on November 6, 1863, and to colonel for actions at Salem, Virginia, on December 15, 1863. In the spring of 1864, he led another cavalry raid toward Saltville but was stopped by Confederate generals John Hunt Morgan and William E. &quot;Grumble&quot; Jones at Cove Gap in the Battle of Cove Mountain. Returning to West Virginia, Averell later commanded a cavalry division under Maj. Gen. David Hunter in his failed raid on Lynchburg, known as the Battle of Lynchburg.

In the summer of 1864, when CSA Lt. Gen. Jubal Early had invaded Maryland and defeated a series of Union commanders, Averell proved to be the only Union commander to achieve victory against the Confederates in the Shenandoah Valley before the arrival of Philip Sheridan. He routed Confederate Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Ramseur at the Battle of Rutherford&#x27;s (Carter&#x27;s) Farm on July 20, 1864, inflicting 400 casualties and capturing a four-gun battery, in spite of Averell&#x27;s being significantly outnumbered. When CSA Brig. Gen. John McCausland burned Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, to the ground on July 30, Averell tracked him down near Moorefield, West Virginia.

Using scouts disguised as Confederates in his vanguard, Averell routed McCausland in a sunrise attack upon the Confederate camp, capturing hundreds of prisoners and another four-gun battery in the Battle of Moorefield.

During the Valley Campaigns of 1864 against Early, Averell fought under Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan. He was relieved of command a second time in his career on September 23, 1864, following a dispute with Sheridan about Averell&#x27;s actions after the Battle of Fisher&#x27;s Hill. This incident truly devastated him and he could not hide his misery. A staff officer wrote &quot;I saw General Averell sitting in front of his tent ... He was dreadfully depressed and broken. I believe he started for the rear within a few moments after we left him, and never was employed again during the war.&quot; Averell resigned from the Union Army volunteers and from the U.S. regular army on May 18, 1865.

On July 17, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Averell for appointment to the grades of brevet brigadier general and brevet major general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865. The U.S. Senate confirmed the appointments on July 23, 1866. The latter appointment was in recognition of Averell&#x27;s actions at the Battle of Kelly&#x27;s Ford.

==Postbellum career==
Following the Civil War, President Johnson appointed Averell as U.S. consul general to British North America; he served from 1866 to 1869, through the rest of that administration. In 1888, during Grover Cleveland&#x27;s presidency, Averell was reinstated in the Army by a special Act of Congress and placed upon the retired list; he was also appointed as Assistant Inspector General of Soldiers Homes (1888-1898).

Averell was an entrepreneur and an inventor, working in the fields of coal, steel and eventually paving materials. His businesses and his inventions of practical devices generated a handsome income. Among his inventions were methods for manufacturing steel castings and insulated electrical cable, but he is best known for his work in techniques of laying asphalt pavement. Averell had become interested in asphalt as early as 1870, when some experimental pavement, based on the procedures patented by Edward de Smedt, a Belgian engineer and chemist, was laid in New York City and Newark, New Jersey. Although Averell observed problems with these installations, he was convinced of the potential of asphalt paving. As president of the Grahamite Asphalt Pavement Company, he began studying the existing product and procedures and experimenting with ways to improve them. Eventually, he developed improved techniques for laying pavement, which he patented in 1878 as &quot;Improvement in Asphaltic Pavement.&quot;

Averell was among career officers who wrote memoirs and histories of military units: he wrote &quot;Ten Years in the Saddle&quot; (1978) and co-authored &quot;History of the Third Pennsylvania Cavalry, 60th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers&quot; (1905). Both books were published posthumously. The manuscript for his memoir was not discovered until the later 20th century, and it was published in an annotated edition.

==Death, legacy and honors==
General Averell died in Bath, New York, and is buried there.

*In 1976, Averell was one of the first class of ten inductees for the Steuben County (NY) Hall of Fame. 
*Averell Street in Winchester, Virginia, to mark the area where his former troops went into winter quarters in 1864.

<doc id="332326" wikidata="Q423892" url="?curid=332326" title="Chlordecone">
<text>Chlordecone, better known in the United States under the brand name Kepone, is an organochlorine compound and a colourless solid. It is an obsolete insecticide, now prohibited in the western world, but only after many thousands of tonnes had been produced and used. Chlordecone is a known persistent organic pollutant that was banned globally by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2009.

==Synthesis==
Chlordecone is made by dimerizing hexachlorocyclopentadiene and hydrolyzing to a ketone.

It is also the main degradation product of mirex.

== History ==
In the U.S., chlordecone, commercialized under the brand name &quot;Kepone&quot;, was produced by Allied Signal Company and LifeSciences Product Company in Hopewell, Virginia. The improper handling and dumping of the substance (including the waste materials generated in its manufacturing process) into the nearby James River (U.S.) in the 1960s and 1970s drew national attention to its toxic effects on humans and wildlife. After two physicians, Dr. Yi-nan Chou and Dr. Robert S. Jackson of the Virginia Health Department, notified the Centers for Disease Control that employees of the company had been found to have toxic chemical poisoning, LifeSciences voluntarily closed its plant on 4 July 1975, and cleanup of the contamination began and a 100-mile section of the James River was closed to fishing while state health officials looked for other persons who might have been injured. At least 29 people in the area were hospitalized as a result of their exposure to Kepone.

The product is made in a Diels-Alder reaction shared with pesticides like chlordane and endosulfan. Chlordecone is cited amongst a handful of other noxious substances as the driver for Gerald Ford&#x27;s half-hearted approval in 1976 of the Toxic Substances Control Act, which &quot;remains one of the most controversial regulatory bills ever passed&quot;.

==Regulation==
In the US, Chlordecone was not federally regulated until after the Hopewell disaster, in which 29 factory workers were hospitalized with various ailments, including neurological.

In France it was banned on the mainland only, in 1993.

In 2009, chlordecone was included in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which bans its production and use worldwide.

On 14 March 2024, the French National Assembly assumed responsibility for the chlordecone contamination affecting populations in Martinique and Guadeloupe.

== Toxicology ==
Chlordecone can accumulate in the liver and the distribution in the human body is regulated by binding of the pollutant or its metabolites to lipoproteins like LDL and HDL. The LC50 (LC = lethal concentration) is 35 μg/ L for &quot;Etroplus maculatus&quot;, 22–95 μg/kg for blue gill and trout. Chlordecone bioaccumulates in animals by factors up to a million-fold.

Workers with repeated exposure suffer severe convulsions resulting from degradation of the synaptic junctions.

Chronic low level exposure appears to cause prostate cancer in men, and &quot;significant excesses of deaths were observed for stomach cancer in women and pancreatic cancer in women&quot;.

Chlordecone has been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30), which interacts strongly with the estrogen sex hormone estradiol.

==Incidents==
The history of chlordecone incidents are reviewed in &quot;Who&#x27;s Poisoning America?: Corporate Polluters and Their Victims in the Chemical Age&quot; (1982).

=== James River estuary ===
In July 1975, Virginia Governor Mills Godwin Jr. shut down the James River to fishing for 100 miles, from Richmond to the Chesapeake Bay. This ban remained in effect for 13 years, until efforts to clean up the river began to show results.

Due to the pollution risks, many fishermen, marinas, seafood businesses, and restaurants, along with their employees along the river suffered economic losses. In 1981, a large group of these entities sued Allied Chemical in federal district court (Eastern District of Virginia), claiming special economic damages from Allied&#x27;s negligent damage to the fish and wildlife. In a case that sometimes appears in law school courses on Remedies, the court rejected the traditional &quot;economic-loss rule&quot;, which requires physical impact causing personal injury or property damage to receive economic damages, and instead allowed a limited group of the plaintiffs—the fishing boat owners, the marinas, and the bait and tackle shops—to recover economic damages from Allied Chemical.

=== French Antilles ===
The French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe are heavily contaminated with chlordecone, following years of its massive and unrestricted use on banana plantations. Despite a 1990 ban on the substance in mainland France, the economically powerful banana planters lobbied intensively to obtain a waiver to keep using Kepone until 1993. They argued that no alternative pesticide was available, which has since been disputed. After the 1993 ban, the banana planters were discreetly granted derogations to use their remaining stocks, and a 2005 report prepared by the French National Assembly states that after the 1993 ban was imposed, the chemical was illegally imported to the islands under the name Curlone, and continued to be used for many years. Since 2003, local authorities in the two islands have restricted the cultivation of various food crops because the soil is badly contaminated by chlordecone. A 2018 large-scale study by the French public health agency, &quot;Santé publique France&quot;, shows that 95% of the inhabitants of Guadeloupe and 92% of those of Martinique are contaminated by the chemical. Guadeloupe has one of the highest prostate cancer diagnosis rates in the world.

== In popular culture ==
* Kepone was the name of an American indie rock band from Richmond, Virginia formed in 1991.
* The Dead Kennedys recorded a song named &quot;Kepone Factory&quot;, a satire of the controversy surrounding Allied Signal and their negligence regarding employee safety, for their 1981 album &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot;.

<doc id="332327" wikidata="Q1141174" url="?curid=332327" title="Oriole Park at Camden Yards">
<text>Oriole Park at Camden Yards, commonly known as Camden Yards, is a ballpark in Baltimore, Maryland. It is the home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Baltimore Orioles, and the first of the &quot;retro&quot; major league ballparks constructed during the 1990s and early 2000s. It was completed in 1992 to replace Memorial Stadium. The stadium is in downtown Baltimore, a few blocks west of the Inner Harbor in the Camden Yards Sports Complex.

Since its opening, Oriole Park has been widely hailed as one of the best stadiums in baseball and credited with starting a wave of neotraditional ballparks after the cookie-cutter stadiums of the mid to late 20th century.

Since construction on Oriole Park began in 1989, taxpayers have shouldered at least $1.3 billion of the stadium&#x27;s costs. In 2023, the Orioles asked taxpayers to pay an additional $600 million for stadium renovations.

==History==

===Construction===
Prior to Camden Yards, the predominant design trend of big league ballparks was the symmetrical multi-purpose stadium. Memorial Stadium, the Orioles&#x27; home since they moved from St. Louis in 1954, was an early example of such a design.

In 1984, the Baltimore Colts moved to Indianapolis, in part because Baltimore and Maryland officials refused to commit money for a replacement for Memorial Stadium. Not wanting to risk losing the Orioles and Baltimore&#x27;s status as a Major League Baseball city, Baltimore and Maryland state officials immediately began planning a new park in order to keep them in town.

The master plan was designed by international design firm RTKL. The stadium design was completed by the architectural firm HOK Sport, which had pioneered retro ballparks at the Minor League level four years earlier with Pilot Field in Buffalo, New York.

HOK Sport&#x27;s original design was very similar to the new Comiskey Park. However, President &amp; CEO Larry Lucchino, turned it down preferring an old fashion ballpark with modern amenities. Lucchino hired Janet Marie Smith, an architect and city planner, to represent the team as Orioles Senior Vice President to execute his vision. The Baltimore-based firm Ashton Design was brought on to the project to develop the signage, graphics, illustrations and logos that dot the stadium, as well as the 19th-century style clock above the scoreboard. Ashton&#x27;s vintage designs, which echo the team&#x27;s turn-of-the-century origins, proved influential, and the firm was called upon to complete similar retro redesigns of Fenway Park and Dodger Stadium.

Construction began in 1989 and lasted 33 months. Former Orioles owner Eli Jacobs favored naming the new field &quot;Oriole Park&quot;, while then-Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer favored &quot;Camden Yards&quot;. After considerable debate, a compromise was reached and it was decided that both names were to be used, resulting in the stadium’s long name.

===1992–2008===

The first contest at Oriole Park at Camden Yards was a 5–3 preseason exhibition win over the New York Mets before 31,286 on April 3, 1992. The ballpark officially opened three days later on April 6 with Rick Sutcliffe pitching a complete game shutout in a season-opening 2–0 victory over the Cleveland Indians before a sellout crowd of 44,568. Chris Hoiles drove in the first official run at Camden Yards with a ground-rule double that scored Sam Horn in the fifth inning.

Camden Yards hosted the 1993 MLB All-Star Game.

On June 18, 1994, an escalator accident injured 43 people; one of the stadium&#x27;s multiple-story escalators, overcrowded with fans heading to their upper-deck seats, jerked backward, throwing passengers to the bottom landing. On September 6, 1995, Camden Yards witnessed Cal Ripken Jr.&#x27;s record-setting 2,131st consecutive game. Exactly one year later, Eddie Murray blasted his 500th home run there.

Two orange seats stand out from the park&#x27;s dark green plastic chairs. One, located at Section 96, Row 7, Seat 23 in the right-center field bleachers (officially known as the Eutaw Street Reserve sections), commemorates the spot where Murray&#x27;s 500th home run landed. The other, Section 86, Row FF, Seat 10 in the left field bleachers, was the landing spot for Ripken&#x27;s 278th home run as a shortstop, breaking Chicago Cubs legend Ernie Banks&#x27; record for the position. That home run was hit on July 15, 1993. Ripken finished his career with 345 home runs as a shortstop and 431 overall.

The great success of Camden Yards sparked a trend in the construction of more traditional, fan-friendly ballparks in downtown locations across the U.S.

===Renovations===
After the 2008 season, a new HD video display and scoreboard were installed below the right field flag court, a standing-room area between the warehouse and the right field wall. A new, high fidelity sound reinforcement system was added around the ballpark in 2009. The Orioles made numerous improvements to their home ballpark and to their spring training facility, Ed Smith Stadium, before the start of the 2011 season. All seats in the lower seating bowl were replaced and drink rails were added in the club level. Several skyboxes were also eliminated and refurbished to make room for more casual party suites, including the Miller Light Flight Deck. The renovation reduced Oriole Park&#x27;s capacity from 48,876 to 45,971, making it more comparable with newer ballparks.
During the 2011–12 off-season, the Orioles announced further upgrades to Camden Yards in preparation for the 20th anniversary of the park&#x27;s opening. These improvements included the expansion of concession food choices, widening of the concourses in the upper deck, the installation of a replica of the B&amp;O Railway Warehouse&#x27;s original canopy, and the addition of a lounge atop the batter&#x27;s eye in center field, which had previously been inaccessible to fans. All fans are permitted to access the standing area of the lounge and fans can purchase tickets for drink rail seats. The Orioles also opened Dempsey’s Bar and Grill, named for beloved longtime Orioles catcher and TV broadcaster Rick Dempsey, on the ground level of the warehouse that is open before games and on non-game days. The team also erected cast-bronze statues of all the Oriole Baseball Hall of Famers in the picnic area beyond the bullpens in left-center field. Furthermore, the right field wall was lowered from to to improve the view of the field from Eutaw Street. In March 2024, The Orioles announced a multiyear partnership with Coors Light to rename the lounge on top of batter’s eye/bullpen wall in center field. The lounge would be renamed, the “Coors Light Roof Deck.” In July 2024, an LED T. Rowe Price Sign was added above the videoboard replacing where “The Sun” was formally located.

====Blocked skyline views====
In 2007–08 construction started on two large buildings beyond the stadium&#x27;s outfield walls—a 757-room Hilton Baltimore hotel north of the stadium occupying a two-city-block area and a high-rise apartment building, both completed in 2009—which have blocked views of the city&#x27;s skyline from most sections of the grandstand. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; said on April 21, 2008, &quot;There&#x27;s just a glimpse of the Bromo Seltzer Tower&#x27;s crenellated top just to the right of the new Hilton Baltimore Convention Center hotel ... something&#x27;s drastically different at Oriole Park this year ... the sweeping view of downtown Baltimore that fans have enjoyed for the past 16 seasons has changed considerably.&quot; Sportswriter Peter Schmuck complained, &quot;the big, antiseptic convention hotel ... looms over Camden Yards ... [and] has blocked out the best part of the Baltimore skyline&quot;. A &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist called it a &quot;cruel cubist joke on a previously perfect ballpark&quot;, although others said they were pleased with new construction downtown as indicative of urban revitalization. Some of the hotel&#x27;s rooms have a clear view of the playing field.

====Changes in field dimensions====
In January 2022, Orioles general manager Mike Elias announced adjustments to Camden Yards&#x27; left field dimensions in an attempt to reduce the stadium&#x27;s propensity for home runs. The changes—the first to the size of the iconic ballpark’s playing area in two decades—raised the wall&#x27;s height from to about and moved it back as much as , according to information provided by the team. The new configuration resulted in the elimination of the first 10 rows of outfield bleacher seats in sections 72–86, resulting in a net reduction of about 1,100 seats. Major League Baseball approved the adjustments, which cover the area from the left-field corner to the bullpens in left-center field.

As of 2020, Camden Yards&#x27; distance from home plate to the left-field corner was about average for the 30 major league stadiums, though its distance to left-center was the sixth-shortest in the league. In addition, Oriole Park was one of only eight ballparks with a wall shorter than 8 feet in left and had the shortest wall in left-center field of any venue. The new left-field wall is tied for the sixth-tallest in the majors. The new dimensions to straight away left () and left-center () make Oriole Park&#x27;s left field the most spacious in the American League. However, the salient created by the bullpens results in an unusual sight on a modern baseball field—a reduction in dimensions as one moves from left field toward center field. The left-center field dimension marked to the immediate left of the bullpens is 398 feet, while the left-center field dimension marked on the bullpens&#x27; wall is 376 feet. This creates a hypothetical scenario in which a batter could hit a longer non-home run to left field than home run to left-center field, if the latter is hit into the bullpens.

The club informed its season-ticket holders in the affected sections of the changes. Although fans who typically sit in those locations will be farther from the infield and home plate, they will remain as close as they were to the field of play. As part of this process, the orange seat honoring franchise icon Cal Ripken Jr.&#x27;s 278th home run to set the MLB record for home runs by a shortstop will be moved and used as part of the Oriole Park Exhibit for the ballpark&#x27;s 30th anniversary celebration.

====B&amp;O Warehouse====


The stadium planners incorporated the warehouse into the architecture of the ballpark experience rather than demolish or truncate it. The floors of the warehouse contain offices, service spaces, and a private club. The warehouse has never been hit by a legal home run during regulation play. However, several players have reportedly struck the wall during batting practice, and it was hit by Ken Griffey Jr. during the Home Run Derby associated with the 1993 MLB All-Star Game.

====Eutaw Street====
Eutaw Street, between the stadium and the warehouse, is closed to vehicular traffic. Along this street, spectators can get a view of the game or visit the many shops and restaurants that line the thoroughfare, including former Oriole star Boog Powell&#x27;s outdoor barbecue stand. On game days, pedestrians must have a ticket in order to walk on the part of Eutaw Street adjacent to the stadium; however, on non-game days the street is open to all, while access to the stadium is gated. Sections 90–98, called Eutaw Street palace, are located not in the stadium, but adjacent to Eutaw Street, with the seats descending toward the outfield below. If a game sells out, fans may purchase reduced-price &quot;standing-room only&quot; tickets, which entitle them to enter Eutaw Street and watch the game from two designated standing areas (in the left field bullpen area or above the scoreboard in right field).

Many home run balls have landed on Eutaw Street, and the Orioles organization has marked the spots with small baseball-shaped bronze plaques embedded in the street, though it sometimes takes up to a year for each homer to get a plaque. 
As of 2023, there have been 120 homers that cleared the flag court to land on Eutaw Street.
The first home run to reach Eutaw Street was hit by Mickey Tettleton of the Detroit Tigers on April 20, 1992. 
The longest in-game home run to land on Eutaw Street was a towering 462-foot shot by Gunnar Henderson of the Orioles on June 11, 2023. However, the only player to ever hit the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Warehouse at Camden Yards on the fly is Ken Griffey Jr of the Seattle Mariners, who accomplished the 465-foot hit as part of the 1993 Home Run Derby. 
The June 29, 2012 game against the Cleveland Indians was only the second time multiple home runs have landed on Eutaw Street in a single game. The first occurrence was during the April 11, 1997 game against the Texas Rangers when Rafael Palmeiro hit two home runs which landed on Eutaw Street. The single season record for home runs landing on Eutaw Street is eight, set in 2008. Major League Baseball&#x27;s official website, MLB.com, publishes an updated list of Eutaw Street landings on the Orioles webpage.

===Notable events===
The Orioles celebrated the ballpark&#x27;s 20th anniversary during the 2012 season and launched the website CamdenYards20.com as part of the celebration. Historically, Oriole Park at Camden Yards is one of several venues that have carried the &quot;Oriole Park&quot; name for various Baltimore franchises over the years.

====Notable games====

*September 6, 1995: Cal Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig&#x27;s record of 2,130 consecutive games played, and hit a home run during that game. Attendees included President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Joe DiMaggio, and Cal Ripken Sr.
*May 17, 1996: Chris Hoiles hit a rare ultimate grand slam (walk off grand slam down by three runs), doing so in even more dramatic fashion with a full-count in the ninth inning to carry the Orioles to a 14–13 victory over the Seattle Mariners. In advance of Oriole Park&#x27;s 25th anniversary, MLB honored the game as #3 most memorable in Oriole Park history.
*September 6, 1996: Eddie Murray hit his 500th career home run exactly one year after Cal Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig&#x27;s consecutive game streak.
*October 15, 1997: The Cleveland Indians win Game 6 of the 1997 ALCS 1–0 in 11 innings to win the series 4-2 and advance to the 1997 World Series. To date, this is the closest the Orioles have been to hosting a World Series in Camden Yards, with the last one occurring 14 years before, when they were still playing at Memorial Stadium.
*May 3, 1999: The Cuban national baseball team defeats the Orioles 12–6 in the second game of a two-game exhibition series
*April 4, 2001: Hideo Nomo pitched the first no-hitter in the history of Camden Yards, walking three and striking out eleven.
*October 4, 2001: Tim Raines Sr. played left field and Tim Raines Jr. played center field, in the 5–4 loss to the Boston Red Sox becoming only the second father-son duo to play in the same game. Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr. were the only other father-son duo to do so (with the Seattle Mariners, on August 31, 1990).
*October 6, 2001: Cal Ripken, Jr.&#x27;s final MLB game. Former President Bill Clinton and MLB Commissioner Bud Selig were in attendance.
*August 22, 2007: The Texas Rangers beat the Orioles 30–3 in game one of a doubleheader, the highest scoring game in 110 years.
*May 31, 2008: Manny Ramirez of the Boston Red Sox hits his 500th home run in a game against the Orioles.
*June 30, 2009: The Orioles rallied to score 10 runs against the Red Sox after facing a 10–1 deficit in the 7th inning, breaking the franchise record for the largest comeback, and the Major League Baseball record for the largest comeback by a last place team over a first place team.
*September 28, 2011: The Orioles defeated the Boston Red Sox in the final day of the season with a 4-3 walk-off win. The loss, coupled with the Tampa Bay Rays&#x27; 8–7 victory over the New York Yankees at Tropicana Field minutes later, eliminated the Red Sox from postseason contention. The Red Sox became the first team in baseball history to miss the postseason after leading by as many as nine games for a playoff spot entering the month of September.
*May 8, 2012: Josh Hamilton tied the Major League Baseball record for home runs in a game with 4. He went 5 for 5 with four home runs and one double.
*October 3, 2014: The Orioles rallied with four runs in the 8th inning to top the Tigers 7–6 in Game 2 of the American League Division Series. 
*April 29, 2015: As a result of the 2015 Baltimore riots, the game against the White Sox was closed to the public, the first time that has happened in MLB history.

==Design and features==

Camden Yards was built on land that once served as the rail yard for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s Camden Station. The view from much of the park is dominated by the former Baltimore &amp; Ohio Warehouse at Camden Yards behind the right-field wall. Some seats in the stadium have a good view of the downtown Baltimore skyline.

The bullpen area was designed after many write-in designs were submitted by the public. Its unique two-tiered design was a first in major league parks.

A picnic area is located above and behind the bullpens. Rows of picnic tables covered by orange umbrellas are available for fans to sit and eat. Many trees are located there, too. Many fans at home games view the game from behind the railing behind the bullpens. Until the 2012 season, the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network&#x27;s pre- and post-game shows before Orioles home games were televised in an outdoor studio behind the bullpens. Bronze sculptures of the six Orioles greats whose uniform numbers were retired by the ballclub were unveiled individually in the walking zone of the area behind the bullpens throughout the 2012 season. The statues were created by Antonio Tobias Mendez and cast at the locally based New Arts Foundry.

On the street there is a statue of Babe Ruth entitled, &quot;Babe&#x27;s Dream&quot;, created in 1996 by sculptor Susan Luery. In the same courtyard, one will find sculptures indicating the retired jersey numbers of the Baltimore Orioles.

The stadium is the first major league park to have an outfield wall made up entirely of straight wall segments since Ebbets Field. The playing field is below street level.

The stadium contains 4,631 club seats and 72 luxury suites. Every seat in the ballpark is green, except for two – one in left field which marks the spot of Cal Ripken&#x27;s 278th career home run, breaking Ernie Banks&#x27; all-time record among shortstops, and one in right field, which marks the spot of Eddie Murray&#x27;s 500th career home run.

Camden Yards lights spell out &quot;GO ORIOLES&quot; all throughout the month of September.

===Seating capacity===
===Ballparks influenced by Camden Yards===
Since its opening day in 1992, Camden Yards was a success and fan favorite. Attendance jumped from an average of 25,722 over the last 10 years of Memorial Stadium&#x27;s tenure to an average of 43,490 over the first 10 years of Camden Yards&#x27; existence. Due to its success, many other cities built traditional-feeling asymmetrical ballparks with modern amenities (such as skyboxes) in a downtown setting. Many of these stadiums, like Camden Yards, incorporate &quot;retro&quot; features in the stadium exteriors as well as interiors; these parks have been dubbed &quot;retro-classic&quot; parks. Other parks, known as &quot;retro-modern&quot; parks, have combined &quot;retro&quot; exteriors with more modern interior elements.
The park also ended a quarter-century trend of multi-purpose stadiums in which baseball and football teams shared the same stadium. Although intended to cut costs, the fundamentally different sizes and shapes of baseball and football fields made this concept fundamentally inadequate for either sport. By the 2012 season, all but two teams played in baseball-only parks.

Retro-classic parks include:
*Coors Field in Denver (1995)
*Oracle Park in San Francisco (2000)
*Comerica Park in Detroit (2000)
*PNC Park in Pittsburgh (2001)
*Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia (2004)
*Busch Stadium in St. Louis (2006)
*Citi Field in Queens, New York City (2009)
*New Yankee Stadium in The Bronx, New York City (2009)
*Rate Field in Chicago (1991/2011)
**This park opened in 1991 as the last of the so-called &quot;modern&quot; ballparks. It was heavily renovated from 2001 to 2011 into a retro-classic park.

Retro-modern parks include:
*Progressive Field in Cleveland (1994)
*Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim (1966/1998)
**Angel Stadium opened in 1966 as a modern park. From 1979 to 1980, it was converted into a multi-purpose park shared with the NFL&#x27;s Los Angeles Rams. After the Rams moved to St. Louis after the 1994 NFL season, the stadium was extensively renovated a second time from 1996 to 1998, with the most significant change being the removal of almost all of the seats added for football. The final result was a retro-modern park.
*Chase Field in Phoenix (1998)
*T-Mobile Park in Seattle (1999)
*Daikin Park in Houston (2000)
*American Family Field in Milwaukee (2001)
*Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati (2003)
*Petco Park in San Diego (2004)
*Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. (2008)
*Target Field in Minneapolis (2010)
*Truist Park in Cumberland, Georgia (2017)
*Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas (2020)

LoanDepot Park in Miami (opened in 2012), was the first since Camden Yards not classified as a &quot;retro&quot; park, whether of the classic or modern variety. Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria specifically rejected the retro model for the new park, desiring a facility that reflected the 21st-century culture of Miami. Populous, which designed both Camden Yards and LoanDepot Park, was willing to listen; the lead designer for Marlins Park would later say the company was &quot;waiting for a client willing to break the [retro] mold.&quot; Stadium planners are labeling LoanDepot Park the first example of contemporary architecture in MLB.

==Non-baseball events==

===Concerts===
===Papal Mass===
On October 8, 1995, Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass at Camden Yards as part of his visit to Baltimore, one of the most prominent non-baseball events at Camden Yards.

==Awards and recognitions==
On May 6, 1992, Oriole Park received the Urban Design Award Of Excellence from the American institute Of Architects.

In March 2013, Oriole Park was named the No. 3 ballpark in the U.S. by TripAdvisor.

==Attendance==
Between 1992–2000, the Orioles averaged more than 40,000 spectators per game, with a total attendance of 3.71 million persons in the 1997 season. Since then, attendance has declined to 1.9 million in the 2009 season. The current single game highest attendance record at Camden Yards is 49,828, set on July 9, 2005 against the Boston Red Sox. On April 9, 2019, the low-attendance mark was set, when just 6,585 fans watched the Orioles play the Oakland Athletics. On April 29, 2015, Camden Yards was practically empty after the riots in Baltimore over Freddie Gray. Only two scouts, one scoreboard display operator, the play-by-play commentators for the teams&#x27; radio and television networks, and the players showed up to watch, and official attendance was 0. This marked the first time in MLB history that the public was not permitted to attend a baseball game.

On August 19, 2008, the stadium hosted its 50 millionth fan, a milestone reached in just 17 seasons, the fastest park in baseball history to reach such a figure. Since opening in 1992, Oriole Park has hosted the third-most number of fans in Major League Baseball, exceeded only by Dodger Stadium and the first Yankee Stadium.

==Access and transportation==

On the far side of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Warehouse at Camden Yards is the present Camden Station, served by both the Baltimore Light RailLink and MARC&#x27;s Camden Line commuter rail service. The latter rail line provides direct service to Washington, D.C., and the former to BWI Airport. The Light RailLink service began around the time the stadium opened. Nearby Convention Center station also sees heavy traffic during Orioles games; the station is located near the stadium&#x27;s main entrance.

The stadium is located in downtown Baltimore, near the Inner Harbor. The ballpark, along with the adjacent M&amp;T Bank Stadium, home of the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League, make up the Camden Yards Sports Complex, though Camden Yards generally refers to only the baseball stadium. The football stadium was not built until 1998, the Ravens&#x27; third season in existence. Camden Yards is just a short walk from Babe Ruth&#x27;s birthplace, which is now a museum. According to some sources, Ruth&#x27;s father once owned a pub located in what is now center field of the stadium.

In May 2005, a new sports museum, the Sports Legends Museum at Camden Yards, opened in Camden Station. It lasted only 10 years, closing on October 12, 2015.

==In popular culture==
*The movie &quot;Dave&quot; (1993) features a scene with the President of the United States, played by Kevin Kline, throwing out the first pitch at Camden Yards. That scene was filmed in front of an actual capacity crowd at the ballpark, prior to a regular-season game in early August 1992. Similar scenes were filmed for the Chris Rock movie &quot;Head of State&quot;, for the Geena Davis TV Series &quot;Commander in Chief&quot;, and for the 2004 season finale of &quot;The West Wing.&quot; A short clip in the 2005 film &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; shows Oriole Park at Camden Yards.
*The movie &quot;Major League II&quot; (1994) used Camden Yards as the home of the Indians.
*Part of the sixth-season premiere of the NBC police drama series &quot;&quot; was filmed at Camden Yards. In these scenes, the detectives must hurry to solve a murder at Camden Yards before a game between the Orioles and the New York Yankees ends.
*The pilot of the HBO 2009 comedy series &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot; begins with an aerial shot of Camden Yards; however, when actor Danny McBride takes the mound, the field level shot is at a different ballpark.
*A portion of an episode of the HBO series &quot;The Wire&quot;, a show about police officers and drug dealers in Baltimore, was filmed during an actual Orioles game in which characters Jimmy McNulty and Bunk Moreland, played by Dominic West and Wendell Pierce, take their sons to a game while discussing a case.
*The HBO series &quot;Veep&quot; filmed episode 6 of their first season, which aired May 27, 2012 at Camden Yards. Orioles Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer and then Orioles players Jake Arrieta and Tommy Hunter made cameo appearances on the field with &quot;Veep&quot; star Julia Louis-Dreyfus. This was perhaps a subtle homage to Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s previous role as Towson-native Elaine Benes on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and that character&#x27;s Orioles fandom. 
*&quot;House of Cards&quot; features Vice President of the United States Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) throwing out a ceremonial first pitch at Camden Yards. Spacey, a noted Orioles fan who actually threw a real ceremonial first pitch against the Blue Jays in 2013, is first seen wearing a jacket featuring the cartoon bird in the tunnel to the team dugout as he is being introduced to the crowd. Former closer Jim Johnson and outfielder Nate McLouth meet Spacey&#x27;s character on the field, with Johnson expecting to receive the pitch as the stadium lights suddenly go out. For added realism, the crowd even yells &quot;O&quot; during the national anthem.

<text>Deryck Jason Whibley (born 21 March 1980), nicknamed Bizzy D, is a Canadian musician, best known for his work as the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, keyboardist, main songwriter, producer, founder and only constant member of the rock band Sum 41.

== Early life ==
Whibley was born in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, raised in Ajax, Ontario, and attended Southwood Park Public School. He grew up in a single parent household. Whibley has an interest in architecture and has said he would like to design houses if he was not a musician. As a teenager, he attended Exeter High School. It was there that he and his bandmates were discovered while playing at their War of the Bands. In high school, Whibley was the captain of his basketball team.

==Career==

===Sum 41===

Whibley formed Sum 41 with bassist Grant McVittie. After several lineup changes, the band consisted of Whibley, Steve Jocz, Dave Baksh and Jason McCaslin. In 1999, the band signed an international record deal with Island Records. The band released their debut EP, &quot;Half Hour of Power&quot; in 2000, then an album, &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot;, in 2001. The band achieved mainstream success with their first single from the album, &quot;Fat Lip&quot;, which reached number-one on the &quot;Billboard Modern Rock Tracks&quot; chart and remains the band&#x27;s most successful single to date. &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot; was certified platinum in the United States, Canada and in the UK. The band has since released six more studio albums: &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; (2002), &quot;Chuck&quot; (2004), &quot;Underclass Hero&quot; (2007), &quot;Screaming Bloody Murder&quot; (2011), &quot;13 Voices&quot; (2016), &quot;Order in Decline&quot; (2019), and &quot;Heaven :x: Hell&quot; (2024). The three albums before &quot;Screaming Bloody Murder&quot; have been certified platinum in Canada. Aside from vocals and guitar, Whibley played drums and went by the name Gunner for the Sum 41 alter-ego heavy metal band Pain For Pleasure, where the members of Sum 41 would parody a 1980s metal band. Whibley would later switched to guitar after Frank Zummo became part of the alter-ego band.

The band often performs more than 300 times each year and holds long global tours, most of which last more than a year. They have been nominated for seven Juno Awards and have won twice (Group of the Year in 2002 and Rock Album of the Year for &quot;Chuck&quot; in 2005). Their fifth studio album, &quot;Screaming Bloody Murder&quot;, was released on March 29, 2011. During the Screaming Bloody Murder Tour, the band added Whibley&#x27;s cousin Matt Whibley on keyboard.

===Solo work===
Besides Sum 41, Whibley developed a professional career in the music industry as producer and manager. He was part of Bunk Rock Music, a music management and production company. He produced for No Warning with the company as well. Since parting ways with Greig Nori, he sold his part of the company in early 2005.

During the Sum 41 hiatus in 2005 and 2006, he worked with Tommy Lee on guitar and backing vocals for his album, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;A Million in Prizes: The Anthology&quot; with Iggy Pop.

He worked as the producer of &quot;We Have an Emergency&quot;, the debut album by Sum 41 co-member Jason McCaslin&#x27;s side project The Operation M.D. In 2007, he mixed the debut album of the band Permanent Me. He was also involved with the Avril Lavigne album, &quot;The Best Damn Thing&quot;, where he produced and played guitar.

Besides his musical career, he has worked on occasion as an actor. He portrayed the character Tony in the movie &quot;Dirty Love&quot;, and himself as a guest character in &quot;King of the Hill&quot;.

In November 2007, Whibley suffered a herniated disc while drumming on the song &quot;Pain for Pleasure&quot;. This happened while Sum 41 was on tour with Finger Eleven, and the remainder of the &quot;Strength in Numbers Tour&quot; was canceled although Finger Eleven did travel to Winnipeg, Manitoba to play the show with Die Mannequin and Inward Eye in replacement of Sum 41.

On the Operation M.D.&#x27;s second album &quot;Birds + Bee Stings&quot;, which was released on June 29, 2010, Whibley mixed one track entitled &quot;Sick + Twisted&quot;. He also played keyboard and piano on the same track. He also joined the band live, playing guitar on this song, on December 21, 2010, at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto.

Whibley contributed some guitar to Tommy Lee&#x27;s side project Methods of Mayhem&#x27;s second album &quot;A Public Disservice Announcement&quot; which was released on September 21, 2010.

He co-wrote the songs &quot;Broken Pieces&quot;, &quot;Over and Out&quot; and &quot;Lost in Reality&quot; with 5 Seconds of Summer, which appeared on their &quot;She&#x27;s Kinda Hot&quot; EP.

He was featured on &quot;No Defeat for the Brave&quot; by While She Sleeps in 2021.

On February 18, 2022, Whibley released a collaboration track with Simple Plan called &quot;Ruin My Life&quot;.

He released his first book, a memoir titled &quot;Walking Disaster: My Life Through Heaven and Hell&quot;, on October 8, 2024. The book&#x27;s title is a nod to the Sum 41 song &quot;Walking Disaster&quot;, and their eighth and final studio album &quot;Heaven :x: Hell&quot; (2024).

==Instruments==
Whibley uses a black customized &#x27;72 Fender Telecaster Deluxe live with his well-known red X&#x27;s for decoration and good luck. He has also put out a signature guitar with Squier, a sub-brand of Fender. The signature Squier comes in black and Olympic white, sports the two red X&#x27;s and has one humbucking pickup in the bridge position, which is a Seymour Duncan Designed HB-102. It also has his signature &quot;Deryck&quot; written on the headstock. Whibley has used many Gibson guitars such as the Flying V, Les Paul, SG and a Gibson Marauder, which was his first guitar given to him by his mother, and has been used in some of the band&#x27;s videos such as &quot;Fat Lip&quot; and &quot;In Too Deep&quot;. According to the October 2007 issue of &quot;Rock Sound&quot; magazine, he also uses &#x27;59 Les Paul Reissues, &#x27;52 Telecaster Reissues, Telefunken and Neumann mics, Plexi 100 watt Marshall Heads and Cabinets and Spectraflex cables. In March 2023, Whibley began selling items from his collection of instruments.

==Personal life==
Whibley married fellow singer Avril Lavigne in 2006. The couple occasionally performed together and have spoken about their relationship in interviews. Whibley and Lavigne began dating when she was 19 years old, after being friends since she was 17. The wedding was held on July 15, 2006. About 110 guests attended the wedding, which was held at a private estate in Montecito, California. After a little over three years of marriage Lavigne filed for divorce on October 9, 2009 and the divorce was finalised on November 16, 2010.

On August 30, 2015, Whibley married model Ariana Cooper in Los Angeles. Their first child was born in March 2020. Their second child was born in March 2023.

On October 8, 2024, Whibley released a memoir, &quot;Walking Disaster&quot;. In the memoir, Whibley alleged that the former manager of Sum 41, Greig Nori, psychologically and sexually abused him for several years, and had &quot;groomed&quot; him. According to Whibley, he met Nori at age 16, when the latter was 34. He alleged that the manager offered him drugs and accused him of homophobia when he attempted to end their relationship. Nori, who has denied the allegations, hired a defamation lawyer in response. He was fired as the band&#x27;s manager in 2005, at Whibley&#x27;s request. Nori is the co-lead vocalist of Treble Charger. 

===Health issues===
Whibley has chronic back pain due to a series of back injuries, starting with a slipped disc during a 2007 concert. 
On August 5, 2010, Whibley was hospitalized after he was attacked in a bar in Japan late at night by three unknown individuals. After an MRI scan, it was revealed that Whibley herniated a disc in his back for the 14th time. Although advised against performing, Whibley rejoined the band on August 8 in Osaka for the Summer Sonic Festival. The back injuries, alongside severe anxiety, caused Whibley to self-medicate with alcohol. Whibley again injured his back in April 2013, causing him to miss shows.

On May 17, 2014, Whibley announced that, a month earlier, he had been hospitalized for alcoholism with severe liver and kidney damage.

On September 15, 2023, Whibley&#x27;s wife Ari announced that he was in the hospital with pneumonia and COVID-19, which led to heart failure. He responded sufficiently to treatment and was released the following day.

On July 31, 2024, Sum 41 cancelled several tour dates after Whibley had again injured his back.

<text>James Black (May 1, 1800 – June 22, 1872) was an American knifemaker best known for his improvements to the Bowie knife designed by Jim Bowie.

==Early life==
James Black was born on May 1, 1800 in Hackensack, New Jersey. James&#x27; mother died when he was very young and he had difficulty getting along with his stepmother. Black ran away from home to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at age 8 and was apprenticed to a silversmith. At age 18 he migrated westward and took jobs on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. In about 1820, Black spent some time at Bayou Sara in Louisiana working as a ferryman and as a steamboat deckhand on the Red River which took him upstream to Fulton, Arkansas. Black left the boat and settled at a crossroads northeast of Fulton that would later become Washington, Arkansas and Black&#x27;s permanent home.

==Partnership with William Shaw==
During his travels, Black had befriended Elijah Stuart. Stuart opened a tavern at Washington and Black was hired by a local blacksmith named William Shaw. Black, due to his previous training, worked on firearms and knives while Shaw concentrated on horse shoes, wagon wheels, and the like. Black would later become a partner in the business with Shaw. Stuart&#x27;s tavern would become famous as the place where Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, and William B. Travis created the plan for an independent Texas and Black would go on to create some of the world&#x27;s finest knives. Black fell in love with his partner&#x27;s daughter, Anne Shaw, and was forced out of the partnership when Shaw would not allow the marriage. Backed by the note he had received from the dissolved partnership Black purchased some land along the Cossatot River and established a blacksmith&#x27;s shop, dam, and mill.

Black&#x27;s endeavor came to an end when he was thrown off of his land. Local officials claimed that the land was Indian treaty land and that Black could not legally inhabit it. Black then discovered that the note he had received from William Shaw for his share of the partnership was actually worthless. Black set up his own blacksmithy in competition with Shaw&#x27;s and married Shaw&#x27;s daughter in 1828, despite Shaw&#x27;s objections and also convinced Shaw&#x27;s son to join him in his business. Black was soon recognized as the best blacksmith in the area which had a bad effect on his father-in-law&#x27;s competing shop.

Black and his wife had four sons and a daughter during this period: William Jefferson in 1829, Grandison Deroyston in 1830, Sarah Jane in 1832, John Colbert in 1834, and Sydinham James in 1835. Black became a respected member of the community and served in local government posts.

==Bowie knife and fame==

In 1830, Black made the famous Bowie knife for Jim Bowie who was already famous for knife-fighting from his 1827 sandbar duel. Bowie&#x27;s killing of three assassins in Texas and his death at the Battle of the Alamo made him, and Black&#x27;s knife, legends. After Bowie&#x27;s death in 1836, Black did a brisk business selling his knives to pioneers bound for Texas. Everyone seemed to want &quot;Jim Bowie&#x27;s knife.&quot; Black forged his knives behind a leather curtain and kept his process a secret. Black&#x27;s knives were known to be exceedingly tough yet flexible. Many claimed that Black had rediscovered the process to make Damascus steel.

James Black&#x27;s wife Anne died in 1838; and in 1839, while Black was in bed from an illness, his father-in-law Shaw broke into Black&#x27;s house and brutally attacked him with a club. Black&#x27;s life was saved by the family dog; he survived, but his eyes were severely damaged by the attack. He went north to seek medical advice, where his eyes were further damaged by the inept ministrations of a Cincinnati, Ohio, physician. When Black returned to Arkansas he discovered that his father-in-law had sold his business and property, illegally, and disappeared with the cash.

Black lived on a local plantation for a couple of years until, Dr. Isaac Newton Jones took him into his home. Black lived with the Jones family for the next 30 years. He attempted to pass on his knife-making secrets to Daniel Webster Jones, but unfortunately he could not remember the technique. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas. James Black died on 22 June 1872 in Washington, Arkansas.

More skeptically, &quot;...[T]here is no direct contemporary evidence to establish that James Black made a knife for James Bowie... The story rests solely on Black&#x27;s claims made well after he had been adjudged mentally incompetent...&quot; &quot;...[T]he only time that [James Bowie] &quot;verifiably&quot; used a knife in a personal encounter was on the Sandbar in 1827...&quot; “...[T]o this day there is no known knife bearing his name that is proven authentic, nor positively identified as the work of James Black. Neither is it proven beyond doubt that he even made a knife of any type!” Shifting the question (and the burden of proof) from people to knives, &quot;...[T]he Black explanation remains the most logical way to understand this part of the 
Bowies&#x27; history.&quot;

==Bowie knife since Black&#x27;s death==
Black&#x27;s shop has been recreated as part of the Old Washington Historic State Park. Old Washington is the headquarters of the American Bladesmith Society and they maintain a knife-making college at the site. Black&#x27;s knives are exceedingly rare and are prized by collectors.

Several examples of early Bowie knives are on display at the Historic Arkansas Museum as part of the American Bladesmith Society collection.

In 1996, Black was inducted into the American Bladesmith Society Hall of Fame as an inauguree.

==James Black in fiction==
*In the 1956 film &quot;The Iron Mistress&quot;, Black is depicted forging Bowie&#x27;s knife from iron that he has extracted from a meteorite.
*In 1956, James Black was in the first episode of the CBS television series, &quot;The Adventures of Jim Bowie&quot;, which was primarily set in 1830s in Louisiana. The show, which starred Scott Forbes as Jim Bowie, was based on the 1946 novel &quot;Tempered Blade&quot;.

<text>Industrial data processing is a branch of applied computer science that covers the area of design and programming of computerized systems which are not computers as such — often referred to as embedded systems (PLCs, automated systems, intelligent instruments, etc.). The products concerned contain at least one microprocessor or microcontroller, as well as couplers (for I/O).

Another current definition of industrial data processing is that it concerns those computer programs whose variables in some way represent physical quantities; for example the temperature and pressure of a tank, the position of a robot arm, etc.</text><links>

<doc id="332348" wikidata="Q3166184" url="?curid=332348" title="Jean-Jacques Bertrand">
<text>Jean-Jacques Bertrand (; June 20, 1916 – February 22, 1973) was a Canadian politician and lawyer who served as the 21st premier of Quebec, from October 2, 1968, to May 12, 1970. He led the Union Nationale party.

== Member of the legislature ==
Bertrand served as Member of the Legislative Assembly for the District of Missisquoi from 1948 until his death in 1973.

== Member of the Cabinet ==
He served as Minister of Lands and Forestry from 1958 to 1960 and briefly as Minister of Youth and Social Welfare until his party, the Union Nationale lost the provincial election in 1960.

Bertrand tried to become leader of the Union Nationale in 1961, but was defeated by his colleague Daniel Johnson, Sr., the MLA for the district of Bagot.

In 1966, the Union Nationale was put back in office and Premier Daniel Johnson, Sr. appointed Bertrand to his Cabinet. Bertrand served both as Education Minister until 1967 and Minister of Justice until Johnson&#x27;s sudden death from a heart attack in 1968. In addition to those assignments, Bertrand was also Johnson&#x27;s Deputy Premier.

== Premier of Quebec ==
Bertrand was chosen interim Party Leader until a leadership convention could be held and therefore became Premier of Quebec.

His victory (58% of the delegates) over colleague Jean-Guy Cardinal (41%), Minister of Education and newly elected MLA for the district of Bagot, at the Leadership Convention of 1969, caused a deep division among party insiders. While Johnson had been more accommodating towards the more nationalist elements of the party, Bertrand clearly positioned himself as a federalist. Cardinal was considered the nationalist candidate in the race. His defeat prompted a number of supporters to leave the Union Nationale and join the Parti Québécois.

The Union Nationale was also weakened by the passage of a controversial language legislation in 1969, known as Bill 63. Meant to resolve a conflict that plagued the public school board of Saint-Léonard, the bill confirmed the status quo on the language of instruction in the public schools (parents can choose English or French) and angered Quebec nationalists. Two Union Nationale MLAs, Jérôme Proulx and Antonio Flamand crossed the floor and sat as Independents, along with Parti Québécois Leader René Lévesque and Liberal dissident Yves Michaud to protest against the new law.

The Bill 63 would be superseded by Robert Bourassa&#x27;s Bill 22 in 1974 and René Lévesque&#x27;s Bill 101 in 1977.

The less controversial accomplishments of the Bertrand administration include the abolition of the Legislative Council of Quebec, the provincial equivalent of the Canadian Senate. Since then, the Legislative Assembly of Quebec is known as the National Assembly of Quebec.

== Leader of the Official Opposition ==
The Union Nationale lost the 1970 election to Robert Bourassa&#x27;s Liberals. While the party managed to obtain the status of Official Opposition, it finished third in the popular vote behind the PQ. The UN never significantly recovered from that defeat and no longer exists as a political party.

A year later, Bertrand resigned as Leader of the Union Nationale. In 1971, he received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University, which later became Concordia University. He died a few months before the 1973 election.

== Personal life ==
His son, Jean-François Bertrand, was the Member of the National Assembly for the district of Vanier from 1976 to 1985 and a Cabinet Member of René Lévesque&#x27;s Parti Québécois government. Bertrand&#x27;s widow Gabrielle served as Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for the district of Brome—Missisquoi from 1984 to 1993.

<doc id="332349" wikidata="Q3014239" url="?curid=332349" title="Daniel Johnson Sr.">
<text>Francis Daniel Johnson Sr. (April 9, 1915 – September 26, 1968) was a Canadian politician and the 20th premier of Quebec from 1966 to his death in 1968.

== Background ==
Johnson was born in Danville, Quebec, Canada. He was the son of Francis Johnson, an anglophone labourer of Irish heritage, and Marie-Adéline Daniel, a French Canadian. He was raised bilingually but educated entirely in French.

In 1943, Johnson married Reine Gagné (1918–1994). In 1953, she survived being shot twice by her lover, Radio-Canada announcer Bertrand Dussault, who then committed suicide.

His sons, Pierre-Marc Johnson and Daniel Johnson Jr. also became premiers of Quebec; remarkably, each was a leader of a different party and both lasting for less than a year as premier, Pierre-Marc as leader of the sovereigntist Parti Québécois for a brief period in 1985, and Daniel Jr. as leader of the federalist Liberal Party of Quebec for nine months in 1994 and both were voted out in a general election.

== Member of the legislature ==
Johnson won a by-election in 1946 and became the Union Nationale Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the district of Bagot. He was re-elected in 1948, 1952, 1956, and 1960.

He served as parliamentary assistant to Premier Maurice Duplessis in 1955 and Deputy House Speaker from 1955 to 1958. He became the target of cartoonists, who portrayed him as Danny Boy.

== Cabinet member ==
Johnson was appointed to the Cabinet in 1958 and served as Minister of Hydraulic Resources until the 1960 election, which was won by the Liberals. He was the minister who started the Manic-5 hydroelectric project in 1958 of which its Daniel-Johnson Dam was named after him.

== Party leader ==
Johnson was elected party leader against Jean-Jacques Bertrand in 1961. His party lost the 1962 election against Jean Lesage&#x27;s Liberals, but he was returned to the legislature.

His 1965 book &quot;Égalité ou indépendance&quot; (&quot;Equality or independence&quot;) made him the first leader of a Quebec political party to recognize the possibility of independence for Quebec, saying that if Canada was content to be a Dominion under the British Crown, then Quebec should seek independence. He stated if the English-speaking Canadians did not want to be independent, Quebec could do it alone. His position on the issue was seen to be ambiguous. As he wrote in his book, his position was for &quot;independence if necessary, but not necessarily independence,&quot; a reference to Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s famous utterance in the World War II conscription debate.

== Premier ==
Under the same slogan, &quot;Égalité ou indépendance&quot;, his party won the 1966 election and he became Premier of Quebec, a position that he retained until his death. His term was, among other things, qualified by tensions with the Canadian government over constitutional matters because as premier of Quebec, he put forward proposals to reform the Canadian Constitution based on the notion of two equal nations, as opposed to ten equal provinces.

== Death ==

In July 1968, Johnson suffered a heart attack which kept him from work until mid-September.

On September 25, Hydro-Québec, the government-owned utility organized a ceremony to mark the completion of the Manicouagan-5 Dam. Hundreds of dignitaries, politicians, utility executives, financiers, engineers, and journalists were ferried by plane from Montreal, Quebec City, and New York City to the worksite to attend a banquet and a plaque-unveiling ceremony.

Among the guests were Johnson, his predecessor, Jean Lesage, and René Lévesque, the former Hydraulic Resources minister responsible for the consolidation of all investor-owned utilities into Hydro-Québec in 1962 to 1963. Photographs taken at the banquet show the three men were in excellent spirits, holding hands, and smiling, but relations between the Liberal leader and his former cabinet minister were strained by Lévesque&#x27;s recent defection to the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association, a precursor of the Parti Québécois.

In his memoirs, Hydro-Québec executive Robert A. Boyd recalls being woken up at 6 a.m. the next morning by his boss, Roland Giroux. &quot;I&#x27;ve got bad news, Robert...,&quot; said Giroux, who added that he just found the premier lying dead in his bed. Johnson&#x27;s demise from another heart attack sent shockwaves at the worksite and across the province, and the dedication ceremony was quickly cancelled.

On September 26, 1969, a year to the day after Johnson&#x27;s death, the new premier, Jean-Jacques Bertrand, accompanied by Johnson&#x27;s widow and children, unveiled two plaques and officially dedicated the dam after his predecessor. Both plaques are now side by side at the top of the complex.

== Elections as party leader ==
Daniel Johnson lost the 1962 election.
He won the 1966 election and died in office in 1968.

<text>The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), also known as AgBank, is a Chinese partially state-owned multinational banking and financial services corporation headquartered in Beijing, China. It is one of the &quot;big four&quot; banks in China, and the second largest bank in the world by total assets, behind the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. ABC was founded on 10 July 1951, and has its headquarters in Dongcheng District, Beijing. It has branches throughout mainland China, Hong Kong, London, Tokyo, New York, Frankfurt, Sydney, Seoul, and Singapore.

ABC has 320 million retail customers, corporate clients, and nearly 24,000 branches. It is China&#x27;s third-largest lender by assets. ABC went public in mid-2010, fetching the world&#x27;s biggest ever initial public offering (IPO) at the time, since overtaken by the Saudi Arabian state-run petroleum enterprise, Saudi Aramco. In 2011, it ranked eighth among the Top 1000 World Banks, by 2015, it ranked third in Forbes&#x27; 13th annual Global 2000 list and in 2017 it ranked fifth. In 2023, Agricultural Bank of China was ranked #4 in Forbes&#x27; Global 2000 (World&#x27;s Largest Public Companies). It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.

==History==
Since the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, ABC has been formed and abolished several times. On 10 July 1951, two banks of the Republic of China, Farmers Bank of China and Cooperation Bank, merged to form the Agricultural Cooperation Bank, which ABC regards as its ancestor. However, the bank was merged into People&#x27;s Bank of China, the central bank in 1952. The first bank bearing the name Agricultural Bank of China was founded in 1955, but it was merged into the central bank in 1957. In 1963 the Chinese government formed another agricultural bank which was also merged into the central bank two years later. Today&#x27;s Agricultural Bank of China was founded in February 1979. As the People&#x27;s Bank of China began spinning off its commercial banking functions after 1978, ABC&#x27;s focus on providing farmers with financial services increased.

ABC was restructured to form a holding company called Agricultural Bank of China Limited. It was listed on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges in July 2010.

In 2012, ABC started a project to migrate to the Avaloq Banking System.

The Agricultural Bank of China halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang&#x27;s missile and nuclear programs.

In 2023, the asset management division of Agricultural Bank of China ABC WM together with BNP Paribas Asset Management launched an asset management joint venture. BNP Paribas ABC Wealth is majority owned by BNPP AM (51%), ABC Wealth Management holds 49%. Alexandre Werno became the CEO.

As of 2024, Agricultural Bank of China continues to operate in Russia despite international sanctions imposed following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. While many Western financial institutions have withdrawn from the Russian market, Chinese banks, including AgBank, have expanded their operations and influence, quadrupling their credit commitments to Russian banks by March 2023. ABC together with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the Bank of China and the China Construction Bank increased their joint commitment to Russia by $2.2 billion within 14 months of the launch of the Russian attack on Ukraine, reaching 9.7 billion dollars. This financial support, largely conducted in yuan rather than dollars or euros, aligns with Beijing&#x27;s broader strategy to promote its currency as an alternative to the U.S. dollar. Critics argue that such actions undermine international efforts to isolate Russia economically and indirectly enable its continued aggression against Ukraine.

== Incidents ==
In April 2007, ABC was the victim of the largest bank theft in Chinese history. This occurred when two vault managers at a branch in Handan, Hebei embezzled almost yuan (US$7.5 million).

==2010 initial public offering==
ABC was the last of the &quot;big four&quot; banks in China to go public. In 2010, A shares and H shares of Agricultural Bank of China were listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange respectively. Each share was set to cost between 2.7RMB and 3.3RMB per share. H shares were set to cost between HK$2.88 and HK$3.48 per share. The final share price for the IPO launch was issued on 7 July 2010. On completion in August 2010 it became the world&#x27;s biggest initial public offering (IPO) surpassing the one set by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2006 of . This record has since been beaten by another Chinese company, Alibaba, in 2014.

ABC raised US$19.21 billion in an IPO in Hong Kong and Shanghai on 6 July 2010, before overallotment options were exercised. On 13 August 2010, ABC officially completed the world&#x27;s largest initial public offering, raising a total of after both Shanghai and Hong Kong&#x27;s over-allotments were fully exercised. The IPO was once thought to be able to raise , but weaker market sentiment dampened the value. Despite a 15-month low for the Chinese benchmark index, the IPO was said to have gone smoothly.

CICC, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley led the Hong Kong offering, with JPMorgan, Macquarie, Deutsche Bank and ABC&#x27;s own securities unit also involved. CICC, CITIC Securities, Galaxy and Guotai Junan Securities handled the Shanghai portion. ABC sold about 40% of the Shanghai offering to 27 strategic investors, including China Life Insurance and China State Construction. They were subject to lock-up periods of 12–18 months. Eleven cornerstone investors were selected for its Hong Kong share offering, including Qatar Investment Authority and Kuwait Investment Authority, taking a combined worth of shares.

On Aug 01, 2024, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) announced MOUs worth $50 billion with six Chinese financial institutions, including the Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China.

<doc id="332358" wikidata="Q992791" url="?curid=332358" title="Syrtis Major Planum">
<text>Syrtis Major Planum (formerly Syrtis Major Planitia) is a massive shield volcano in the eastern hemisphere of Mars. A &quot;dark spot&quot; (an albedo feature), Syrtis Major Planum is located in the boundary between the northern lowlands and southern highlands of Mars just west of the impact basin Isidis in the Syrtis Major quadrangle. It was formerly believed to be a plain, and was therefore described as a &quot;planitia&quot;. Later data from the Mars Global Surveyor revealed that it is actually a broad topographic rise. The dark color of Syrtis Major Planum comes from the basaltic volcanic rock of the region and the relative lack of dust.

The selected landing site for the Mars 2020 mission that includes the rover &quot;Perseverance&quot; and the helicopter drone &quot;Ingenuity&quot; was Jezero crater, at within the region. The northeastern region of Syrtis Major Planum was also considered a potential landing site.

==Geography and geology==
Syrtis Major is centered near at . It extends some north from the planet&#x27;s equator, and spans from west to east. It is in the Syrtis Major quadrangle. It encompasses a large slope from its western edge at Aeria, dropping to its eastern edge at Isidis Planitia. Most of Syrtis Major has slopes of less than 1°, a much lower inclination than the slopes of the Tharsis shield volcanoes. It has a 350 km × 150 km north–south elongated central depression containing the calderas Nili Patera and Meroe Patera, which are about 2 km deep. 

The roughly 2,300-meter high peak of Syrtis Major is located northwest of Nili Patera. The floors of the calderas are unique among large Martian volcanoes as they are not elevated relative to the terrain surrounding Syrtis Major. This may account for the high degree of magmatic evolution and hydrothermal activity seen in Nili Patera. The floor of Nili Patera is the less cratered, and therefore the younger, of the two. While most of the rock is basaltic, dacite has also been detected in Nili Patera. 

Satellite gravity field measurements show a positive gravity anomaly centered on the caldera complex, suggesting the presence of a 600 km × 300 km north–south elongated extinct magma chamber below, containing dense minerals (probably mainly pyroxene, with olivine also possible) that precipitated out of magma before eruptions. Crater counts date Syrtis Major to the early Hesperian epoch; it postdates formation of the adjacent Isidis impact basin.


==Discovery and name==
The name Syrtis Major is derived from the classical Roman name &quot;Syrtis maior&quot; for the Gulf of Sidra on the coast of Libya (classical Cyrenaica).

Syrtis Major was the first documented surface feature of another planet. It was discovered by Christiaan Huygens, who included it in a drawing of Mars in 1659. He used repeated observations of the feature to estimate the length of day on Mars. The feature was originally known as the Hourglass Sea but has been given different names by different cartographers. In 1850s, Angelo Secchi called the feature Atlantic Canale. Later he called it Scorpion and Cook Sea or Cook Canal.

In Richard Proctor&#x27;s 1867 map it is called the Kaiser Sea, after Frederik Kaiser of the Leiden Observatory. In 1876, Camille Flammarion called it the Mer du Sablier (French for &quot;Hourglass Sea&quot;) when he revised Proctor&#x27;s nomenclature. The name &quot;Syrtis Major&quot; was chosen by Giovanni Schiaparelli when he created a map based on observations made during Mars&#x27; close approach to Earth in 1877.

==Seasonal variations==

Syrtis Major was the object of much observation due to its seasonal and long-term variations. This led to theories that it was a shallow sea and later that its variability was due to seasonal vegetation. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Mariner and Viking planetary probes led scientists to conclude that the variations were caused by wind blowing dust and sand across the area. It has many windblown deposits that include light-colored halos or &quot;plumose streaks&quot; that form downwind of craters. These streaks are accumulations of dust resulting from disruption of the wind by the elevated rims of the craters (&#x27;wind shadows&#x27;).

==Nili Patera Caldera ==

Nili Patera is a 50 km diameter caldera at the center of the Syrtis Major Volcanic Complex. It and Meroe Patera located to the south are the primary named calderas within a nested caldera complex developed by multiple eruption and collapse events. In the Northeast quadrant of Nili Patera is a 630 m tall volcanic cone named Nili Tholus, on and around this cone is a light-tone lava flow of chemically evolved lava with multiple occurrences of relict silica sinter deposits created by a formerly active hot spring system.

==Moving sand dunes and ripples==
Nili Patera was the subject of a 2010 study into moving sand dunes and wind ripples. The study showed that dunes are active and that sand ripples are actively migrating on the surface of Mars. A following study also showed that the sand dunes move at about the same flux (volume per time) as dunes in Antarctica. This was unexpected because of the thin air and the winds which are weaker than Earth winds. It may be due to &quot;saltation&quot; - ballistic movement of sand grains which travel further in the weaker Mars gravity.

The lee fronts of the dunes in this region move on average 0.5 meters per year. The selection may be biased here as they only measured dunes with clear lee edges to measure. The ripples move on average 0.1 meters per year.

<doc id="332366" wikidata="Q840333" url="?curid=332366" title="Safety pin">
<text>A safety pin is a variation of the regular pin which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp. The clasp forms a closed loop to properly fasten the pin to whatever it is applied to and covers the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point.

Safety pins are commonly used to fasten pieces of fabric or clothing together. Safety pins, or more usually a special version with an extra safe cover, called a nappy pin or loincloth pin, are widely used to fasten cloth diapers (nappies), or modern loincloths. They&#x27;re preferred as their safety clasp, while remaining an ingestion hazard, prevents the baby from being jabbed or pricked. Safety pins can be used generally to patch torn or damaged clothing. They can also be used as an accessory in all kinds of jewelry including: earrings, chains, and wristbands. Sometimes they&#x27;re used to attach an embroidered patch. Safety pins are divided into numbered size categories. Size 3 pins are often used in quilting and may be labelled for purchase as a &quot;quilting pin.&quot; Sizes 4 and larger may be called &quot;blanket pins&quot; and deemed acceptable as kilt pins for informal dress, depending upon design and appearance.

==Early precursor==

The toggle pin, an early clothing fastener, was brought to Palestine by the Hyksos. The toggle pin was a pin characterized by en eyelet in one end; the eyelet was probably used to secure one end of the pin to the article of clothing, with the other end penetrating another portion of the article to secure it.

The fibula, a form of brooch, was invented by the Mycenaeans in the Greek region of Peloponnesus between the 14th and 13th Century BC, and is considered an early precursor to a safety pin since it was used in a similar manner. Fibulae were used by Greek women and men to help secure tunics.

==Invention of the safety pin==
American mechanic Walter Hunt is regarded as the inventor of the modern safety pin. The safety pin included a clasp that covered the point and kept it from opening, and a circular twist at the bend to act as a spring and hold it in place. Charles Rowley (Birmingham, England) independently patented a similar safety pin in October 1849, though they are no longer made.

Hunt made the invention in order to pay off a $15 debt to a friend. He used a piece of brass wire that was about long and made a coil in the center of the wire so it would open up when released. The clasp at one end was devised in order to shield the sharp edge from the user.

After being issued U.S. patent #6,281 on April 10, 1849, Hunt sold the patent to W.R. Grace and Company for $400 (roughly $,000 in dollars). Using that money, Hunt then paid the $15 owed to a friend and kept the remaining amount of $385 for himself. In the years to follow, W.R. Grace and Company would make millions of dollars in profits from his invention.

== Locking safety pin == 
The sharpened pin, that is attached to a coiled wire is connected with a cap that is hooked at the end of the wire. Pushing the pin into the opening of the cap secures the safety of the pin, and the clasp is then closed.

==Medical aspects==

The laryngologist Dr. Chevalier Jackson devised special instruments for removing swallowed safety pins. Because small children often swallowed them and open pins could be lodged dangerously in their throats, Jackson called them &quot;danger pins&quot; and sometimes displayed arrangements of those he had extracted. Safety pin ingestion is still a common problem in some countries.

==Culture==

During the emergence of punk rock in the late 1970s, safety pins became associated with the genre, its followers and fashion. Some claim the look was taken originally from Richard Hell whom the British punks saw in pictures, and whose style they adopted. This is disputed by a number of artists from the first wave of British punks, most notably Johnny Rotten, who insists that safety pins were originally incorporated for more practical reasons, for example, to remedy &quot;the arse of your pants falling out.&quot; British punk fans, after seeing the clothing worn by such punk forerunners, then incorporated safety pins into their own wardrobe as clothing decoration or as piercings, thus shifting the purpose of the pins from practicality to fashion. The safety pin subsequently has become an image associated with punk rock by media and popular culture outlets.

Safety pins worn visibly on clothing became a symbol of solidarity with victims of racist and xenophobic speech and violence after the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom in 2016. Later that year the symbol spread to the United States after Donald Trump&#x27;s election to the presidency. Some commentators and activists derided the wearing of safety pins as &quot;slacktivism,&quot; while others argued it was useful when connected with other, more concrete political actions.

== Tradition ==
Safety pins hold a value in certain cultures and traditions. In India pins are kept over generations and passed down to daughters. Ukrainians use pins as a way to ward off evil spirits when attached to children&#x27;s clothing. In other countries a safety pin is a form of good luck.

<doc id="332370" wikidata="Q6985541" url="?curid=332370" title="Neck rein">
<text>A neck rein is a type of &quot;indirect&quot; rein aid. The horse responds to a neck rein when it has learned that a light pressure of the right rein against its neck on that side means for the horse to turn left, and vice versa.

The neck rein is used in both English riding and in Western riding, though the style differs between the disciplines.

In both disciplines, the horse should look in the direction it is going. Head tossing and turning the head to the outside of the turn are clear signs of bad training and/or faulty rider technique. Moving the hand slightly to the left brings the rein into contact on the right side of the horse&#x27;s neck, and the horse learns to turn left, away from the pressure. Likewise, moving the hand to the right means for the horse to turn right. A horse that has been well trained to neck rein becomes so responsive to legs and seat that it is possible to take the bridle off completely a move sometime seen in non-competitive exhibitions.

Young horses are first taught to respond to a &quot;direct rein&quot;, with reins held in both of the rider&#x27;s hands, turning the horse&#x27;s head by tightening the rein on the side of the desired turn. The correct way to teach neck reining relies on perfecting the horse&#x27;s responses to weight and leg aids while slowly using less direct rein pressure and introducing the feel of the rein against the neck as a cue. A young horse in training needs a reminder from time to time to look where it is going, but horses learn to neck rein fairly quickly, if trained properly. Occasionally trainers will use sloppy and incorrect methods such as crossing the reins under the neck or using reins with tacks or pins in them, but this poor level of horsemanship is thankfully not seen as often in western riding today as it was in years past. 

When riding in the Western style, riders hold both reins in the left hand (if they are right-handed). This was historically so that they could hold a lariat or other needed tool in their right hand. The reins are kept relaxed and somewhat loose. In western pleasure competition at horse shows, riders are not supposed to ever to take the slack out of the reins when neck-reining, and even cues to slow or stop must be very subtle. For working horses, a relaxed rein allows the animal freedom to move over rough terrain. There is some slack in the reins unless the rider needs to tell the horse to stop.

For polo and polocrosse the rider holds one or two pairs of reins in one hand. Slack in the reins is not required.

In English riding and other systems where the primary means of communication is light pressure between the rider&#x27;s hands and the horse&#x27;s mouth, light pressure is always maintained on the bit. The neck rein in English riding is used in addition to a direct rein and reinforces certain riding aids, particularly turns that require the horse to set back on its haunches, such as turns at high speeds when show jumping in a timed jump-off, or in events such as Dressage when performing a Pirouette. Many well-trained English horses seem to already know how to neck rein without being formally taught — further proof that the skill is primarily an outcome of encouraging responsiveness to the legs, weight and a light hand.

<doc id="332372" wikidata="Q1144560" url="?curid=332372" title="Rate (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, a rate is the quotient of two quantities, often represented as a fraction. If the divisor (or fraction denominator) in the rate is equal to one expressed as a single unit, and if it is assumed that this quantity can be changed systematically (i.e., is an independent variable), then the dividend (the fraction numerator) of the rate expresses the corresponding rate of change in the other (dependent) variable. In some cases, it may be regarded as a change to a value, which is caused by a change of a value in respect to another value. For example, acceleration is a change in velocity with respect to time 

&quot;Temporal rate&quot; is a common type of rate (&quot;per unit of time&quot;), such as speed, heart rate, and flux. 
In fact, often &quot;rate&quot; is a synonym of rhythm or frequency, a count per second (i.e., hertz); e.g., radio frequencies or sample rates.
In describing the units of a rate, the word &quot;per&quot; is used to separate the units of the two measurements used to calculate the rate; for example, a heart rate is expressed as &quot;beats per minute&quot;. 

Rates that have a non-time divisor or denominator include exchange rates, literacy rates, and electric field (in volts per meter).

A rate defined using two numbers of the same units will result in a dimensionless quantity, also known as &quot;ratio&quot; or simply as a &quot;rate&quot; (such as tax rates) or counts (such as literacy rate). Dimensionless rates can be expressed as a percentage (for example, the global literacy rate in 1998 was 80%), fraction, or multiple.

==Properties and examples==
Rates and ratios often vary with time, location, particular element (or subset) of a set of objects, etc. Thus they are often mathematical functions.

A rate (or ratio) may often be thought of as an output-input ratio, benefit-cost ratio, all considered in the broad sense. For example, miles per hour in transportation is the output (or benefit) in terms of miles of travel, which one gets from spending an hour (a cost in time) of traveling (at this velocity).

A set of sequential indices may be used to enumerate elements (or subsets) of a set of ratios under study. For example, in finance, one could define I by assigning consecutive integers to companies, to political subdivisions (such as states), to different investments, etc. The reason for using indices I is so a set of ratios (i=0, N) can be used in an equation to calculate a function of the rates such as an average of a set of ratios. For example, the average velocity found from the set of v I &#x27;s mentioned above. Finding averages may involve using weighted averages and possibly using the harmonic mean.

A ratio r=a/b has both a numerator &quot;a&quot; and a denominator &quot;b&quot;. The value of a and b may be a real number or integer. The inverse of a ratio r is 1/r = b/a. A rate may be equivalently expressed as an inverse of its value if the ratio of its units is also inverse. For example, 5 miles (mi) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) corresponds to 1/5 kWh/mi (or 200 Wh/mi).

Rates are relevant to many aspects of everyday life. For example:
&quot;How fast are you driving?&quot; The speed of the car (often expressed in miles per hour) is a rate. &quot;What interest does your savings account pay you?&quot; The amount of interest paid per year is a rate.

==Rate of change==
Consider the case where the numerator formula_1 of a rate is a function formula_2 where formula_3 happens to be the denominator of the rate formula_4. A rate of change of formula_1 with respect to formula_3 (where formula_3 is incremented by formula_8) can be formally defined in two ways:
: formula_9
where &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the function with respect to &quot;x&quot; over the interval from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;a&quot;+&quot;h&quot;. An instantaneous rate of change is equivalent to a derivative.

For example, the average speed of a car can be calculated using the total distance traveled between two points, divided by the travel time. In contrast, the instantaneous velocity can be determined by viewing a speedometer.

==Temporal rates==
In chemistry and physics:
* Speed, the rate of change of position, or the change of position per unit of time
* Acceleration, the rate of change in speed, or the change in speed per unit of time
* Power, the rate of doing work, or the amount of energy transferred per unit time
* Frequency, the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time
** Angular frequency and rotation speed, the number of turns per unit of time
* Reaction rate, the speed at which chemical reactions occur
* Volumetric flow rate, the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit of time; e.g., cubic meters per second

===Counts-per-time rates===

* Radioactive decay, the amount of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per second, measured in becquerels

In computing:
* Bit rate, the number of bits that are conveyed or processed by a computer per unit of time
* Symbol rate, the number of symbol changes (signaling events) made to the transmission medium per second
* Sampling rate, the number of samples (signal measurements) per second

Miscellaneous definitions:
* Rate of reinforcement, number of reinforcements per unit of time, usually per minute
* Heart rate, usually measured in beats per minute

==Economics/finance rates/ratios==
* Exchange rate, how much one currency is worth in terms of the other
* Inflation rate, the ratio of the change in the general price level during a year to the starting price level
* Interest rate, the price a borrower pays for the use of the money they do not own (ratio of payment to amount borrowed)
* Price–earnings ratio, market price per share of stock divided by annual earnings per share
* Rate of return, the ratio of money gained or lost on an investment relative to the amount of money invested
* Tax rate, the tax amount divided by the taxable income
* Unemployment rate, the ratio of the number of people who are unemployed to the number in the labor force 
* Wage rate, the amount paid for working a given amount of time (or doing a standard amount of accomplished work) (ratio of payment to time)

==Other rates==
* Birth rate, and mortality rate, the number of births or deaths scaled to the size of that population, per unit of time
* Literacy rate, the proportion of the population over age fifteen that can read and write
* Sex ratio or gender ratio, the ratio of males to females in a population

<doc id="332373" wikidata="Q1283509" url="?curid=332373" title="Lucius Furius Philus">
<text>Lucius Furius Philus was a Roman statesman who became consul of ancient Rome in 136 BC. He was a member of the Scipionic Circle, and particularly close to Scipio Aemilianus.

As proconsul, his allotted province was Spain. The consul of the previous year, Gaius Hostilius Mancinus, had recently suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Numantines and was forced to surrender, an event known as the &quot;foedus Mancinum&quot;. As his successor in Spain, it was Furius Philus who handed Mancinus over to the Numantines as recompense for the annulled treaty.

Furius was remembered for deliberately picking two of his personal enemies, a &#x27;Q. Metellus&#x27; and a &#x27;Q. Pompeius&#x27;, as lieutenants for his Spanish command, apparently so that his achievements could be lauded by even those who disliked him. For this, he was remembered either as an admirable model of Roman self-confidence or as an example of Roman rashness.

He is mentioned by Macrobius as the author of a work mentioning two sacral formulae to use against besieged cities, while Cicero, in &quot;de Republica&quot;, praises the style of Furius&#x27; speeches.

<text>Rates () is a Portuguese parish and a former township located in the municipality of Póvoa de Varzim. The population in 2011 was 2,505, in an area of 13.90 km2. The township has records dating to the 13th century and, still today, it preserves landmarks such as the townsquare and a well-preserved and notable Romanesque temple.

==History==
Rates is a medieval township that developed around the Monastery of Rates, established by Henry, Count of Portugal in 1100 AD on the site of an older temple dating to the 9th century or earlier and with sculpture elements dating to the Roman empire. A Roman road crossed near the monastery.

Rates naming seems pre-Roman in origin. The town gained importance due to the legend of Saint Peter of Rates, mythical first bishop of Braga and martyr while attempting to convert Roman pagans to Christianity, becoming in a central place in the Portuguese Way of Saint James. The local myth was used by the archbishops of Braga to justify their primacy in Hispania, by claiming that an older Christian tradition existed in the city than in other places.

Rates township, a municipality, already existed in the 13th century and the ecclesiastical parish exists from time immemorial, while the earliest record dating to the 11th century.

In the 16th century, the monastery was dissolved and a commendation of the Order of Christ was created. Its first knight commander was Tomé de Sousa, who John III of Portugal made the first Governor of Brazil.

The town was extinct as it lost its municipal status in 1836 and was annexed to Póvoa de Varzim. It then became just a simple civil parish, and gained town status on July 2, 1993, due to its historical importance. however, the new status is merely honorary in nature and has no administrative significance.

==Geography==
Rates is located 11 km east of downtown Póvoa de Varzim; and borders Laundos to the west, and Balasar to the east. In the northeast it has a border with Barcelos and to the south with Vila do Conde.

The parish is dominated by Serra de Rates, whose flora is distinguished by the Pedunculate Oak or the European Holly.

The entire town is centred on the monastery of Rates. Its historical centre is very well preserved, and it runs to Direita street, where the nobles and the bourgeoisie of the town used to live.

<text>Joseph Koo Kar-Fai (; 25 February 1931 – 3 January 2023) was a Hong Kong composer. He used the pen name Moran (莫然) for Mandarin songs early in his career. According to the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, Koo was one of the most respected composers in Hong Kong.

== Early life ==
Koo was born in Canton, China and migrated with his family to Hong Kong in 1948.

Koo had two siblings: an elder sister, Hong Kong singer and painter Koo Mei (顧媚) and a younger brother, Koo Kar-Tseung (顧嘉鏘).

Koo began learning music at age 17 by taking piano lessons from a Filipino music teacher, who was already giving singing lessons to Koo&#x27;s sister.

==Career==
Koo was sponsored by Sir Run Run Shaw to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston in the early 1960s. Upon graduation he returned to Hong Kong and worked for both the Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest movie studios, scoring, among others, the Bruce Lee films &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; and &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; in 1972.

Koo joined TVB as their director of music in 1973, where from the late 1970s until immigrating to Canada in the 1990s, he collaborated with the lyricist Wong Jim on many memorable TV theme songs. Koo has composed over 1,200 songs in his career, many of which are . He only has 2 notable works as a lyricist, both very short in length and total number of words. One was a children&#x27;s song about the ten numbers, the other was the ending &#x27;Goodnight&#x27; jingle for &quot;Enjoy Yourself Tonight&quot;. These two little-known facts were revealed by James Wong in 1998 during a concert dedicated to both Koo and him.

In 1961, he composed his first published song &quot;Dream&quot; (), which was sung by his sister Koo Mei. He later had another hit song &quot;Suburban Road&quot; 郊道. In 1974, he wrote the first Cantonese TV theme song which was one of the first popular Cantopop songs.

Koo was appointed Member of Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1982. In 1998, he received the Bronze Bauhinia Star from the Hong Kong Government. He also received other awards including Music Accomplishment Award (from Composers and Authors Society of Hong Kong Ltd.), Highest Honour Award (from RTHK Ten Best Chinese Music Program), Best Music Award and Best Lyric Award (from Asia Film Festival), Hong Kong Film Awards, Taiwan&#x27;s Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards.

Koo immigrated to Canada in the 1990s but continued his work in Hong Kong music. In 2007, he wrote the theme song for &quot;The Drive of Life&quot;, a drama produced by TVB to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Hong Kong handover.

In 2012 from 30 November to 3 December, he held a concert titled &quot;Joseph Koo Concert 2012&quot; at the Hong Kong Coliseum, which featured many singers including Adam Cheng, George Lam, Teresa Cheung, and Anthony Wong. In 2015, he announced his retirement as a conductor, and that he would significantly reduce his musical works and become an oil painter like his sister.

Koo died in Richmond, Canada on 3 January 2023, at age 91. Joseph&#x27;s son, Koo Chi Ho, revealed that he had suffered symptoms and complications of COVID-19 and decreased appetite and energy weeks before his death. He was otherwise fit and healthy beforehand.

<doc id="332377" wikidata="Q462716" url="?curid=332377" title="Turkish Airlines Flight 981">
<text>Turkish Airlines Flight 981 (TK981/THY981) was a scheduled flight from Istanbul Yeşilköy Airport to London Heathrow Airport, with an intermediate stop at Orly Airport in Paris. On 3 March 1974, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 operating the flight crashed into the Ermenonville Forest, outside Paris, killing all 335 passengers and 11 crew on board. It was the first aviation accident to exceed 200 and 300 fatalities. The crash was also known as the Ermenonville air disaster.

Flight 981 was the deadliest aviation accident in aviation history until 27 March 1977, when 583 people died in the Tenerife airport disaster. It remains the deadliest single-aircraft accident without survivors, the second hull loss and deadliest accident involving the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the deadliest aviation accident to occur in France.

The crash occurred when an incorrectly secured cargo door at the rear of the plane burst open and broke off, causing an explosive decompression that severed critical cables necessary to control the aircraft. To maximize the working space within the cargo hold, the cargo doors opened outwards, making them vulnerable to being forced open at high altitudes under normal in-flight pressure. To prevent this, a special latching system was used that locked shut under pressure when properly closed. To ensure the latches were properly positioned, a handle on the outside of the door pressed small metal pins into the latches; if the latches were in an improper location the pins would not align and the handle would not close.

The handle on DC-10 cargo doors could close despite the latches being in the wrong position, a discovery made after previous services, most notably during the incident involving American Airlines Flight 96 in 1972. This was because the linkage between the handle and the pins was too weak and allowed the handle to be forced into the closed position. A minor change had been ordered to install a support plate for the handle linkage to make it stronger; manufacturer documents showed this work as completed on the aircraft involved in Flight 981, but the plate had not in fact been installed. It was also noted that the handle on the crash aircraft had been filed down at an earlier date to make it easier to close the door. Finally, the latching had been performed by a baggage handler who did not speak Turkish or English, the only languages provided on a warning notice about the cargo door&#x27;s design flaws and the methods of compensating for them. After the disaster, the latches were redesigned and the locking system was significantly upgraded.

In the following investigation, it was found that a similar set of conditions, which had caused the failure of an aircraft floor following explosive decompression of the cargo hold, had occurred in ground testing in 1970 before the DC-10 series entered commercial service. The smoking gun was a memo from the fuselage&#x27;s manufacturer, Convair (a division of General Dynamics), to McDonnell Douglas, in which the series of events that occurred on Flight 96, and fatally on Flight 981, was foreseen; it concluded that if these events occurred it would probably result in the loss of the aircraft. In spite of this warning, nothing was done to correct the flaw. The consequences of this entirely avoidable crash were many, including – but not limited to – some of the largest civil lawsuits to that date.

==Aircraft and crew==
The aircraft, a DC-10 Series 10 (production designation &quot;Ship 29&quot;), was built in Long Beach, California, under the manufacturer&#x27;s test registration 

The accident aircraft had 12 six-abreast first-class seats and 333 nine-abreast economy seats, for a total of 345 passenger seats. At the time of the accident, two people were seated in first class, while the economy class was fully occupied. The cockpit crew was Turkish. Flight 981&#x27;s Captain was Nejat Berköz, age 44, with 7,000 flying hours. First Officer Oral Ulusman, age 38, had 5,600 hours of flying time. Flight Engineer Erhan Özer, age 37, had 2,120 flying hours experience.

==Accident==
Flight 981 departed from Istanbul at 07:57 local time and landed at Paris&#x27;s Orly International Airport at 11:02 am local time, after a flight time of just over four hours. The aircraft was carrying 167 passengers and 11 crew members on its first leg, and 50 of these passengers disembarked in Paris. The flight&#x27;s second leg, from Paris to London Heathrow Airport, was normally underbooked; however, due to a strike by British European Airways employees, and the indecisive result of the general election held in Britain earlier that week, many London-bound travelers, who had been stranded at Orly, were booked onto Flight 981, delaying the flight&#x27;s departure by 30 minutes.

The aircraft left Orly Airport at 12:32, bound for Heathrow Airport, and took off in an easterly direction, before turning north. Shortly after takeoff, Flight 981 was cleared to flight level 230 () and started turning west towards London. Just after the aircraft passed over the town of Meaux, the rear left cargo door blew off and the sudden difference in air pressure between the cargo area and the pressurized passenger cabin above it, which amounted to , caused a section of the cabin floor above the open hatch to separate and be forcibly ejected through the open hatch, along with six occupied passenger seats attached to that floor section. The fully recognizable bodies of the six Japanese passengers who were ejected from the aircraft along with the rear cargo door were found in a turnip field near Saint-Pathus, approximately south of the crash site. An air traffic controller noted that, as the flight was cleared to FL230, he had briefly seen a second echo on his radar that remained stationary behind the aircraft; this was likely the remains of the rear cargo door.

When the door blew off, the primary as well as both sets of backup control cables that ran beneath the section of floor that blew out were completely severed, destroying the pilots&#x27; ability to control the plane&#x27;s elevators, rudder, and number two engine. The flight data recorder showed that the throttle for engine two snapped shut when the door failed.

The aircraft almost immediately attained a 20-degree pitch down and began picking up speed, while Captain Berköz and First Officer Ulusman struggled to regain control. At some point, one of the crew members pressed their microphone button broadcasting the pandemonium in the cockpit on the departure frequency. Controllers also picked up a distorted transmission from the plane and the aircraft&#x27;s pressurization and overspeed warnings were heard over the pilots&#x27; words in Turkish, including the co-pilot saying, &quot;the fuselage has burst!&quot; As the plane&#x27;s speed increased, the additional lift raised the nose again. Berköz was recorded calling out, &quot;Speed!&quot; and pushed the throttles forward in order to level off. Seventy-seven seconds after the cargo door gave way, the plane crashed into the trees of Ermenonville Forest, a state-owned forest at &quot;Dammartin&#x27;s Grove&quot; () in the commune of Fontaine-Chaalis, Oise. At the point of impact, the aircraft was traveling at a speed of approximately at a slight left turn, fast enough to disintegrate the plane into thousands of pieces. The wreckage was so fragmented that it was difficult to determine whether any parts of the aircraft were missing before it crashed. Post-crash fires were small because there were few large pieces of the aircraft left intact to burn. Of the 346 passengers and crew on board, only 188 bodies were identifiable (40 of which were identified visually), with rescue teams recovering some 20,000 body fragments in all.

==Passengers==

There were 167 passengers on the Istanbul to Paris leg, and 50 of them disembarked in Paris and 216 new passengers, many of whom were supposed to fly on Air France, British European Airways, or Pan Am, boarded TK 981 in Paris, resulting in a 30-minute departure delay.

The majority of the passengers were British, including members of an amateur rugby team from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, who were returning from a Five Nations match between France and England. Notable deaths on board were Briton John Cooper, who won silver medals in the men&#x27;s 400 meters hurdles and the 4 × 400 meters relay at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and Jim Conway, general secretary of the British Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union.

==Investigation==

The French Minister of Transport appointed a commission of inquiry by the &quot;Arrêté&quot; 4 March 1974 and included Americans because the aircraft was manufactured by an American company. There were many passengers on board from Japan and the United Kingdom, so observers from those countries followed the investigation closely.

The Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurance syndicate that covered Douglas Aircraft retained Failure Analysis Associates (now Exponent, Inc.) to also investigate the accident. In the company&#x27;s investigation, it was noted that during a stop in Turkey, ground crews had filed the cargo door&#x27;s locking pins down to less than a quarter of an inch (), when they experienced difficulty closing the door. Subsequent investigative tests proved the door yielded to approximately of pressure, in contrast to the that it had been designed to withstand.

==Cause==
===Similarities to American Airlines Flight 96===
The cargo door design flaws, and the consequences of a likely aircraft floor failure in the event of in-flight decompression on the DC-10, had been noted by Convair engineer Dan Applegate in a 1972 memo.

==Aftermath==

Issues related to the latch of the DC-10 include human factors, interface design and engineering responsibility. The control cables for the rear control surfaces of the DC-10 were routed under the floor; therefore, a failure of the hatch resulting in a collapse of the floor could impair the controls. If the hatch were to fail for any reason, there was a high probability the plane would be lost. In addition, Douglas had chosen a new type of latch to seal the cargo hatch. This possibility of catastrophic failure as a result of this overall design was first discovered in 1969 and actually occurred in 1970 in a ground test, both of which McDonnell-Douglas knew about. This information, and the 1972 &quot;Applegate Memo&quot;, came to light in the material supplied to the litigants after the 1974 crash.
McDonnell-Douglas subsequently faced multiple lawsuits for the crash of Flight 981 by the families of the victims and others. In its defense during pretrial proceedings, McDonnell-Douglas attempted to blame the FAA for not issuing an airworthiness directive, Turkish Airlines for modification of the cargo door locking pins, and General Dynamics for an incorrect cargo door design. When it became clear that its defenses were unlikely to prevent a finding of liability, McDonnell-Douglas and Turkish Airlines and other associated parties settled out-of-court for an estimated $100 million (equivalent to $ million in ), including $80 million from McDonnell-Douglas, of which $18 million was paid by its insurer, Lloyd&#x27;s of London.

After the crash of Flight 981, the latching system was completely redesigned to prevent them from moving into the wrong position.

Turkish Airlines continued using the &quot;Flight 981&quot; designator but for a different flight, Ercan to Antalya, as of February 2023.

==Similar accidents==
Aircraft other than DC-10s have also suffered catastrophic cargo hatch failures. The Boeing 747 has experienced several such incidents, the most noteworthy of which occurred on United Airlines Flight 811 in February 1989, when a cargo hatch failure caused a section of the fuselage to burst open, resulting in the deaths of nine passengers who were blown out of the aircraft.

==Dramatization==
The crash of Turkish Airlines Flight 981 was covered in 2008 in &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot;, a Season Five episode of the internationally syndicated Canadian TV documentary series &quot;Mayday&quot;, which also covers the similar 1972 incident on American Airlines Flight 96.

Footage of the aftermath appears in the disaster documentary &quot;Days of Fury&quot; (1979), directed by Fred Warshofsky.

<doc id="332378" wikidata="Q158888" url="?curid=332378" title="Yamaha Motor Company">
<text>is a Japanese mobility manufacturer that produces motorcycles, motorboats, outboard motors, and other motorized products. The company was established in the year 1955 upon separation from Nippon Gakki Co., Ltd. (currently Yamaha Corporation) and is headquartered in Iwata, Shizuoka, Japan. The company conducts development, production and marketing operations through 109 consolidated subsidiaries as of 2012.

Led by Genichi Kawakami, the company&#x27;s founder and first president, Yamaha Motor spun off from musical instrument manufacturer Yamaha Corporation in 1955 and began production of its first product, the YA-1 125cc motorcycle. It was quickly successful and won the 3rd Mount Fuji Ascent Race in its class.

The company&#x27;s products include motorcycles, scooters, motorized bicycles, boats, sail boats, personal watercraft, swimming pools, utility boats, fishing boats, outboard motors, 4-wheel ATVs, recreational off-road vehicles, go-kart engines, golf carts, multi-purpose engines, electrical generators, water pumps, automobile engines, surface mounters, intelligent machinery, electrical power units for wheelchairs and helmets. The company is also involved in the import and sale of various types of products, the development of tourist businesses, and the management of leisure, recreational facilities and related services. Yamaha&#x27;s motorcycle sales are the second largest in the world and Yamaha is the world leader in water vehicle sales.

==History==
===Parent company===
Nippon Gakki Co., Ltd (currently Yamaha Corporation) was founded by Torakusu Yamaha in 1887 to manufacture reed organs and pianos and became the largest Japanese manufacturer of musical instruments in the early 20th Century. Yamaha was contracted to manufacture wooden and (later) metal airplane propellers by the Japanese government during World War II. The company struggled in the aftermath of the war, and in the early 1950s, chairman Genichi Kawakami decided to repurpose its underutilized war-time facilities to manufacture small motorcycles for leisure use.

===Beginnings: 1955===
The motorcycle division of Yamaha was spun off in 1955, being incorporated on 1 July 1955 in Japan, and was headed by Genichi Kawakami. Yamaha&#x27;s initial product was a two-stroke, single cylinder motorcycle, the YA-1, which was a copy of the German DKW RT 125. The YA-1 was a competitive success at racing from the beginning, winning not only the 125cc class in the Mt. Fuji Ascent, but also sweeping the podium with first, second and third place in the All Japan Autobike Endurance Road Race that same year. Early success in racing set the tone for Yamaha, as competition in many varieties of motorcycle racing has been a key endeavor of the company throughout its history, often fueled by a strong rivalry with Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki, and other Japanese manufacturers.

Yamaha began competing internationally in 1956 when they entered the Catalina Grand Prix, again with the YA-1, at which they placed sixth. The YA-1 was followed by the YA-2 of 1957, another 125cc two stroke, but with significantly improved frame and suspension. The YD-1 of 1957 was a 250cc two-stroke twin cylinder motorcycle, resembling the YA-2, but with a larger and more powerful motor. A performance version of this bike, the YDS-1 housed the 250cc two-stroke twin in a double downtube cradle frame and offered the first five-speed transmission in a Japanese motorcycle. This period also saw Yamaha offer its first outboard marine engine.

===Success and growth in the 1970s===

By 1963, Yamaha&#x27;s dedication to both the two-stroke engine and racing paid off with their first victory in international competition, at the Belgian GP, where they won the 250cc class. Success in sales was even more impressive, and Yamaha set up the first of its international subsidiaries in this period beginning with Thailand in 1964, and the Netherlands in 1968. 1965 saw the release of a 305cc two-stroke twin, the flagship of the company&#x27;s lineup. It featured a separate oil supply which directly injected oil into the gasoline prior to combustion (traditionally riders had to pre-mix oil into gasoline together before filling the gas tank on two stroke engines). In 1967 a new larger displacement model was added to the range, the 350cc two stroke twin R-1.

In 1968, Yamaha launched their first four-stroke motorcycle, the XS-1/650 which was a 650cc four-stroke twin, a larger and more powerful machine that equaled the displacement and performance of the popular British bikes of the era, such as the Triumph Bonneville and BSA Gold Star. Yamaha continued on with both the two-stroke line and four-stroke twins at a time that other Japanese manufacturers were increasingly moving to four cylinder four-stroke machines, a trend led by Honda in 1969 with the legendary CB750 four-stroke four-cylinder cycle.

===Two stroke era begins: the 1970s===
In early 1969, Yamaha added reed-valve induction to its previously piston-ported designs to produce the twin-cylinder RD and single-cylinder RS families, with variants in a number of capacities. There was a persistent, but apocryphal, rumour to the effect that &quot;RD&quot; indicated &quot;race developed&quot;. In fact, &quot;R&quot; appears to have indicated &quot;reed valved&quot;, &quot;D&quot; the twin (or &quot;double&quot;) cylinder models and &quot;S&quot; the single-cylinder models. The RD family would be developed through the 1970s and 1980s, gaining solid wheels, water-cooling, YPVS, and other newer technology &#x27;til they had little in common with the original variants (before being supplanted by the TZR). The RS family was produced for many years in a large number of variants by Yamaha and then Escorts Limited in India without losing its resemblance to its progenitors. In addition to the RD and RS standards, Yamaha also manufactured small standards with stamped steel frames and rotary disc-valved motors such as the Yamaha FS1, and step-through V-50 and V-80 designs. Its Enduro trail bike was replaced by the DT models. Not until 1976 would Yamaha answer the other Japanese brands with a multi-cylinder four stroke of their own. The XS-750 (and later 850) a 750cc triple cylinder machine with shaft final drive was introduced almost seven years after Honda&#x27;s breakthrough bike. Yamaha&#x27;s first four-cylinder model, the XS-1100 followed in 1978, again with shaft drive. Despite being heavier and more touring oriented than its rivals it produced an impressive string of victories in endurance racing.

The 1970s also saw some of the first dedicated off-road bikes for off-road racing and recreation. Yamaha was an early innovator in dirt-bike technology, and introduced the first single-shock rear suspension, the trademarked &quot;Monoshock&quot; of 1973. It appeared in production on the 1974 Yamaha YZ-250, a model which is still in production, making it Yamaha&#x27;s longest continuous model and name.

Yamaha continued racing throughout the 1960s and 1970s with increasing success in several formats. The decade of the 1970s was capped by the XT500 winning the first Paris-Dakar Rally in 1979.

===1980s: diversification and innovation===

By 1980 the combination of consumer preference and environmental regulation made four strokes increasingly popular. Suzuki ended production of their GT two stroke series, including the flagship water-cooled two-stroke 750cc GT-750 in 1977. Kawasaki, who had considerable success throughout the 1970s with their two-stroke triples of 250cc, 350cc, 400cc, 500cc and 750cc ended production of road-going two strokes in 1980. Yamaha bucked this trend and continued to refine and sell two-strokes for the street into the 1980s. These bikes were performance oriented, water-cooled twin cylinder machines, designed to achieve excellent performance taking advantage of the lower weight of two strokes. The RZ-250 of 1980 was the progenitor of this series. The RZ-350, the largest displacement model, was a popular hot-rod bike of the 1980s and continued to be sold in some countries into the early 1990s.

Throughout the 1980s the motorcycle industry gradually went from building a few basic but versatile models designed to work well in many roles, to offering many more specialized machines designed to excel in particular niches. These included racing and performance street riding, touring, motocross racing, enduro and recreational off-road riding, and cruising. Yamaha branched out from the relatively small number of UJMs (Universal Japanese Motorcycle) at the start of the decade to a much larger set of offerings in several clearly defined markets at the end of the decade.

The XV750 of 1981 featured an air-cooled V-twin four-stroke engine and cruiser styling, and was one of the first Japanese cruiser style motorcycles. By the end of the 1980s Yamaha had offered dozens of cruiser styled bikes in a variety of displacements and engine configurations.

The RZV500 was one of the first &quot;repli-racers&quot;, a near copy of Kenny Roberts competition GP bike, it featured a liquid-cooled two-stroke motor of 500cc displacement in a V4 configuration, along with a perimeter frame and full fairing.

A more popular and practical high-performance model for the street was introduced in 1985, the FZ750. It was an innovative 750cc four-stroke inline four cylinder model. It was the first motorcycle to feature a five-valve cylinder head, something Yamaha became well known for. It also featured a cylinder block canted forward at 45 degrees, and a box-section steel perimeter frame. Production of the FZ continued until 1991.

Another bike that was performance-oriented was the Yamaha RX-Z, introduced in 1985 as a two-stroke naked sport bike, related to the Yamaha RX-135 and Yamaha RD-135, borrowing its chassis and platform. Originally equipped with a five speed transmission and a solid front disc brake rotor with rear drum brakes, it was popular in Malaysia and Singapore. After a few years on the market, the engine was upgraded with the installation of a six-speed transmission, together with a newer instrument panel and handlebar switches, as well as a cross-drilled front disc brake rotor, while the rear remained with the drum brakes. The design was unchanged until it was updated in 2004, with the rear lights being borrowed by the Yamaha Y125Z and a new headlight. It was also installed with a catalytic converter, which reduced its horsepower to 19bhp. However, the maximum torque remained unchanged but the low-end torque was improved compared to the early models. Some owners of the earlier RX-Z motorcycles may have problems during take-off because the engine tends to stall when an inexperienced rider tries to take off in the first gear. However, the problem was resolved in the new model. In Malaysia, this bike was associated with street racers and was featured in many Malay movies. In 2011, after 26 years, it was discontinued.

===The 1990s: Performance bikes and a spin-off brand===

In 1998 Yamaha marketed a 1000cc four cylinder road bike called the YZF &#x27;R1&#x27;, this model introduced a new style of gearbox design which shortened the overall length of the motor/gearbox case, to allow a more compact unit. This, in turn allowed the motor to be placed in the frame further forward, designed to improve handling in a short wheel-based frame.

In 1995, Yamaha announced the creation of Star Motorcycles, a new brand name for its cruiser series of motorcycles in the American market. In other markets, Star motorcycles are still sold under the Yamaha brand. This was an attempt to create a brand identity more closely aligned with the cruiser market segment, one of the largest and most lucrative in the US.

===The 2000s: Expansion and consolidation===

In 2007, Yamaha established the Philippine operations and distributes Yamaha motorcycles under the corporate name of Yamaha Motor Philippines, Inc., one of more than 20 worldwide subsidiaries operating on all continents.
In 2015, Yamaha invested in Pakistan to set up a plant at Port Qasim, Karachi.

Yamaha purchased small engine maker Subaru Industrial Power Products from Subaru in October 2017. Subaru&#x27;s engines powered lawnmowers, generators and water pumps and have since been rebranded as Yamaha.

Yamaha and Volvo co-developed the B8444S V8 engine for Volvo vehicles from 2005 to 2016.

==Motorcycle racing highlights==
In motorcycle racing Yamaha has won 39 world championships, including seven in MotoGP and 10 in the preceding 500 cc two-stroke class, and two in World Superbike. In addition Yamaha have recorded 210 victories at the Isle of Man TT and head the list of victories at the Sidecar TT with 40. Past Yamaha riders include: Jarno Saarinen, Giacomo Agostini, Bob Hannah, Heikki Mikkola, Bruce Anstey, Kenny Roberts, Eddie Lawson, Wayne Rainey, Jeremy McGrath, Stefan Merriman, Dave Molyneux, Ian Hutchinson, Phil Read, Chad Reed, Ben Spies, Jorge Lorenzo, and nine-time world champion Valentino Rossi.

The Yamaha YZ450F won the AMA Supercross Championship two years in a row, in 2008 with Chad Reed, and 2009 James Stewart. Yamaha was the first to build a production monoshock motocross bike (1975 for 250 and 400, 1976 for 125) and one of the first to have a water-cooled motocross production bike (1977 in works bikes, 1981 in off-the-shelf bikes). Yamaha&#x27;s first Motocross competition four-stroke bike, the YZ400F, won the 1998 USA outdoor national Championship with factory rider Doug Henry.

Since 1962, Yamaha made production road racing Grand Prix motorcycles that any licensed road racer could purchase. In 1970, non-factory privateer teams dominated the 250 cc World Championship with Great Britain&#x27;s Rodney Gould winning the title on a Yamaha TD2.

Yamaha also sponsors several professional ATV riders in several areas of racing, such as cross country racing and motocross. Yamaha has had success in cross country with their YFZ450, ridden by Bill Ballance, winning 9 straight titles since 2000. Yamaha&#x27;s other major rider, Traci Cecco, has ridden the YFZ450 to 7 titles, with the first in 2000. In ATV motocross, Yamaha has had success with Dustin Nelson and Pat Brown, both who race the YFZ450. Pat Brown&#x27;s best season was a 3rd place title in 2007, while Nelson has had two 1st place titles in the Yamaha/ITP Quadcross, one in 2006 and the other in 2008.

In 2021, Yamaha has won several competitions, such as British Superbike with Tarran Mackenzie, MotoAmerica with Jake Gagne, MFJ Superbike with Katsuyuki Nakasuga, WorldSSP with Dominique Aegerter, and several other competitions.

Their 2022 MotoGP lineup was Fabio Quartararo and Franco Morbidelli, continuing in 2023. The 2022 world superbikes team was Toprak Razgatlıoğlu and Andrea Locatelli, continuing in 2023. Yamaha&#x27;s Superbike World Championship team since 2016 has been delivered by Crescent Racing.

===World Superbike===
The first Yamaha rider to ever win a World Superbike was Ben Spies in 2009. Then in 2021, Toprak Razgatlıoğlu managed to become world champion.

== Formula One ==
Yamaha produced Formula One engines from 1989 to 1997 (with a one-year break in 1990), initially for the Zakspeed team, in 1991 for the Brabham BT60Y, in 1992 for the Jordan 192, from 1993 to 1996 for Tyrrell, and in 1997 for the Arrows A18. The Yamaha engines never won a race (Damon Hill nearly did so at the 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix). Drivers including Damon Hill, Ukyo Katayama, Mark Blundell and Mika Salo scored some acceptable results with Blundell achieving a surprise 3rd place at the 1994 Spanish Grand Prix and Hill with 2nd at the aforementioned 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix. This partly was considered to be due to Yamaha collaborating with the John Judd Engine Organization to create a better and reliable engine. However, there were questions raised as to whether the Yamaha engines used from 1993 to 1997 were just Judd engines with Yamaha branding.

1994 was considered to be Yamaha&#x27;s most successful year in terms of points accrued. Apart from the podium achieved by Blundell in Spain, the Yamaha engine in the Tyrrell Car achieved 4 fifth place finishes and 1 sixth place finish over the course of the season. However, due to the inconsistency of the engine over the years, they were often unreliable and were usually regarded as not very powerful. The Yamaha engines never secured a fastest lap or pole position despite being on the grid for nearly a decade.

After the conclusion of the 1997 Formula One season, Yamaha decided to pull out of the sport. A possible reason for this was due to a disagreement with Arrows regarding the 1998 engine&#x27;s identification. Yamaha wished to carry out work on the engine with their engineers, while Arrows wished for their own engineers to work on the engine instead, while still having it badged as a Yamaha engine.

== Formula E ==
In March 2024, it was announced Lola Cars will enter Formula E in the 2024–25 season as a powertrain supplier in a technical partnership with Yamaha. A month later, Lola-Yamaha secured Abt Formula E Team as its first powertrain customer for the 2024–25 season, with the team entering the season as Lola Yamaha Abt Formula E Team.

===Automobile engines===
Yamaha has built engines for other manufacturers&#x27; vehicles beginning with the development and production of the Toyota 2000GT (1967). The cylinder head from the Toyota 4A-GE engine was developed by Yamaha and built at Toyota&#x27;s Shimayama plant alongside the 4A and 2A engines.

In 1984, executives of the Yamaha Motor Corporation signed a contract with the Ford Motor Company to develop, produce, and supply compact 60° 3.0 Liter DOHC V6 engines for transverse application for the 1989–95 Ford Taurus SHO. From 1993 to 1995, the SHO engine was produced in 3.0 and 3.2 Liter versions. Yamaha jointly designed the 3.4 Liter DOHC V-8 engine with Ford for the 1996–99 SHO. Ford and Yamaha also developed the Zetec-SE branded 4-cylinder engines used in several Ford cars like the small sports car Ford Puma.

From 2005 to 2010, Yamaha produced a 4.4 Litre V8 for Volvo. The B8444S engines were used in the XC90 and S80 models, whilst also adapted to 5.0L configuration for Volvo&#x27;s foray into the V8 Supercars with the S60. British sportscar maker Noble also uses a bi-turbo version of the Volvo V8 in their M600.

All performance-oriented cylinder heads on Toyota/Lexus engines were designed and/or built by Yamaha. Some examples are the 1LR-GUE engine found on the 2010–2012 Lexus LFA, the 2UR-GSE found in Lexus ISF, the 3S-GTE engine found on the Toyota MR2 and Toyota Celica GT4/All-Trac, the 2ZZ-GE engine found on the 1999–2006 Toyota Celica GT-S and Lotus Elise Series 2, and the Toyota 4GR-FSE engine found on the Lexus IS250.

Yamaha also tunes engines for manufacturers, such as Toyota, so Yamaha logos are on Toyota S engines.

Yamaha also tried to produce a supercar in the 1990s, named the Yamaha OX99-11. It was made as a supercar to have a Yamaha Formula 1 engine as its powerplant and have Formula 1 technology in it. Even though their engines did not win a Grand Prix, by 1991 the team had produced a new engine, the OX99, and approached a German company to design an initial version of the car. Yamaha was not pleased with the result as it was too similar to sport cars of that time, so it contacted IAD to continue working on the project. By the beginning of 1992, just under 12 months after starting to work on the project, IAD came with an initial version of the car. The car&#x27;s design was undertaken by Takuya Yura, and was originally conceived as a single seater; however, Yamaha requested a two-seater vehicle and a tandem seating arrangement was suggested which was in keeping with Yamaha&#x27;s motorcycle expertise. This resulted in a radical and somewhat outrageous design based on Group C cars of the time, with features such as the cockpit-locking roof. It also shared the same chassis as the Formula 1 car, to try to give the consumer market a pure Formula 1 experience. Eventually disagreements with IAD over the budget made Yamaha take the project to its own Ypsilon Technology which was given six months to finish the project, otherwise it would be terminated. To make matters worse, Japan was in the midst of an economic downturn, which made Yamaha believe there would be no customers for the car, and so the project was cancelled in 1994 after many delays, with only 3 prototypes in existence.

=== Concept cars ===
Beginning in 2013 Yamaha revealed a series of concept cars developed in collaboration with Gordon Murray Design utilizing the company&#x27;s iStream design process. The first concept, named the MOTIV, was revealed at the 43rd Tokyo Motor Show in 2013. The MOTIV was a compact city car designed to accommodate gasoline engines, EV drivetrains, hybrid systems, and range extenders.

The second concept, the Sports Ride Concept, was revealed at the 44th Tokyo Motor Show in 2015. The concept was a lightweight two-seat sports car that drew inspiration from the company&#x27;s motorcycles.

The third concept, the Cross Hub Concept, was revealed at the 45th Tokyo Motor Show in 2017. The Cross Hub was a coupé utility with a diamond-shaped sitting arrangement to allow it to carry two motorcycles in the bed while retaining compact dimensions for urban use.

Yamaha confirmed at the 46th Tokyo Motor Show in 2019 that cars were no longer in the company&#x27;s plans.

<text>Ermenonville () is a commune in the Oise department, northern France. Ermenonville is notable for its park named for Jean-Jacques Rousseau by René Louis de Girardin. Rousseau&#x27;s tomb was designed by the painter Hubert Robert, and sits on the Isle of Poplars in its lake.

==History==
On 3 March 1974, Turkish Airlines Flight 981 crashed in the Ermenonville Forest in Fontaine-Chaalis, Oise, near Ermenonville killing all 346 occupants onboard.

Three town councilors died on 1 June 2009 when Air France Flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic killing all 228 occupants onboard.

==Park==
The garden at Ermenonville was one of the earliest and finest examples of the French landscape garden. The garden at Ermenonville was planned beginning in 1762 by Marquis René Louis de Girardin, the friend and final patron of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Girardin&#x27;s master plan drew its inspiration from Rousseau&#x27;s novels and philosophy of the nobility of Nature.

Rousseau&#x27;s tomb is prominently situated on the artificial island in Ermenonville&#x27;s lake. It is remarked that Hubert Robert was the architect. Completed by 1778 with care and craft, the garden came to resemble a natural environment, almost a wilderness, appearing untouched by any human intervention. Girardin admired the work of William Shenstone at The Leasowes and made a (decorative farm) at Ermenonville. An imitation of Rousseau&#x27;s island is at Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm, Germany.

During the early nineteenth century it was much visited and admired. The garden at Ermenonville was described by Girardin&#x27;s son in 1811 in an elegant tour-book with aquatint plates that reveal Girardin&#x27;s love of diverse vistas that capture painterly landscape effects. Enhancing the elegiac mood of these views were the altars and monuments, the &#x27;Rustic Temple&#x27;, and other details meant to evoke Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse&quot;.

Nearby is Rousseau&#x27;s &#x27;cabin&#x27; in the secluded désert of Ermenonville.

Napoleon Bonaparte visited Ermenonville, where he remarked to Girardin that it might have been better for the French peace if neither he nor Rousseau had ever been born. Girardin retold this story again and again after the fact.

==Population==
Ermenonville has a population of 1,007. Its proximity to Charles de Gaulle Airport causes it to have the highest-density of Air France employees among French communes.

<doc id="332383" wikidata="Q2927470" url="?curid=332383" title="Buckingham, Quebec">
<text>Buckingham is a former town located in the Outaouais region in the western portion of the province of Quebec, Canada. Since January 1, 2002, it has been part of the amalgamated city of Gatineau, which merged five former municipalities, including Masson-Angers, Buckingham, Hull, Aylmer and Gatineau, into a single entity. According to the 2021 Census, the population of the sector was 12,795.

==History==
===First years===
It was in 1799, that land in this area was granted to John Robertson, a former member of a British regiment. The first people settled in Buckingham in 1823 and the first mill was built. More people moved to Buckingham in the years that followed.

===Launch of the lumber industry===
In 1812, Napoleon Bonaparte initiated a continental blockade which forced Great Britain to look to other sources for importing lumber. Soon, large wooded areas were discovered in Lower Canada, including the area that became the Outaouais region. The lumber industry was central to the region&#x27;s economic development for over a century with wood pulp continuing to be important for several decades afterwards. In 1837, the first sawmill was built by Levi Bigelow.

In January 1849, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company opened a store in Buckingham at the mouth of the Lièvre River. It moved there from Lac des Sables to give HBC staff better control of indigenous traders coming down the Ottawa, Gatineau, and Blanche Rivers, as well as the ability to trade with lumberjacks and settlers. The store closed around 1870.

===Maclaren family===
Throughout its history, the city of Buckingham&#x27;s economy has been dominated by the Albright and Wilson Co (ERCO), which employs most of the people in that area. The Maclaren family may have lived in Buckingham but their industry is part of Masson.

The Maclaren family, who have resided in the region since 1840, have dominated the lumber industry in the Outaouais for over a century. In 1864, James Maclaren launched the family&#x27;s activities in Buckingham by building a sawmill. The company became J. MacLaren &amp; Co. and later The James Maclaren Company Limited. James&#x27; two brothers acquired the company after his death in 1892 and then launched a match company in Buckingham in 1894 which was incorporated a year later. The Maclarens later gained control of the hydroelectricity market in the community and also real estate development and sports facilities. The company built a hydroelectric dam along the Du Lièvre River, just north of Buckingham, at the start of the Great Depression. They later built another one near Masson during the 1950s.

In 1902, the Maclaren group added the wood pulp industry to its activities by building a mill. They later expanded their activities across the region, adding mills in Masson, Mont-Laurier and Thurso located not too far from the Du Lièvre River. The Buckingham mill closed shortly before 1960.

=== Former amalgamation ===

From 1975 to 1980, the townships of Buckingham, Notre-Dame-de-la-Salette, L&#x27;Ange-Gardien, Buckingham-Sud-Est, Buckingham-Ouest, Angers and Masson were amalgamated.

===Development===
Population growth has been relatively slow because of its location about from downtown Ottawa. However, due to suburban growth and amalgamation of the town in 2002, several residential developments were created and the population increased. Buckingham is becoming more of a suburban town while still keeping its traditional characteristics in the centre-town area.

===Amalgamation with the city of Gatineau===
On January 1, 2002, the city of Buckingham with its 12,000 residents became part of the new city of Gatineau. This was part of a massive merger movement created by the Parti Québécois&#x27; Bill 180, which was introduced in 2000 by the Municipal Affairs Minister Louise Harel after studies conducted by public agents.

In 2003, the Quebec Liberal Party, with Jean Charest as the leader, won the 2003 provincial election and promised a referendum would be held on the possibility of demerging municipalities. The referendum was held on June 20, 2004, but the majority of the population voted against the demerger and Buckingham thus remained part of the city of Gatineau.

===Château dairy===
The dairy industry was also a major economic asset in the community with Le Château having some of its operations in Buckingham. However, in 2006, Agrodor, a Saguenay-based company that owns the Chateau brand, announced the shutdown of its operations in the Outaouais. The local business sector had launched measures to save the company which has operated in the region since 1943.

After the shutdown of the Château dairy operations in Buckingham, a committee was established to bring dairy production back to the region. Construction started on November 12, 2008, on the future site of what would be called Laiterie de l’Outaouais. The plant officially opened on June 16, 2010.

===Buckingham en Fête===

Each year since 1991, during the month of July, the Buckingham sector hosted Buckingham en Fête, its biggest annual event, which was held in the town&#x27;s Maclaren Park. Several well-known artists in Quebec and in Canada, including Éric Lapointe, Marjo, Jean Leloup La Chicane, Amanda Marshall and April Wine, have performed over the years at the festival. However, due to financial difficulties, the festival nearly disappeared. According to the festival&#x27;s website, the 17th edition in 2007 was still expected to go underway as planned.
In 2016, the festival decided to end the celebration of the festivals with its 25th festival due to financial difficulties caused by the raining during the festival.
Over its history, the festival has received numerous distinctions and awards both regionally and provincially.

<doc id="332384" wikidata="Q5650649" url="?curid=332384" title="Hans Redlich">
<text>Hans Ferdinand Redlich (11 February 1903 – 27 November 1968) was an Austrian musicologist, writer, conductor and composer who, due to political disruption by the Nazi Party, lived and worked in Britain from 1939 until his death nearly thirty years later.

==Redlich&#x27;s continental years==
Redlich was born in Vienna, the son of Josef Redlich (1869-1936), then Professor of History at the University of Vienna. He studied piano privately with Paul Weingarten and harmony and counterpoint with Hugo Kauder. He was a student of Carl Orff in Munich after 1921. He was a university student in both cities and studied German literature and musicology. Redlich served as répétiteur for the Berlin-Charlottenburg city opera in 1924–1925 and as opera conductor for the Stadttheater Mainz from 1925 to 1929. 

From 1929 until 1931, Redlich studied musicology at Frankfurt University where he completed a dissertation on stylistic changes in Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s madrigals. From then until 1937, Redlich resided in Mannheim as a composer and writer. His interest in Monteverdi led to his preparation of a performing edition of the 1610 &quot;Vespers&quot;, based on Gian Francesco Malipiero&#x27;s pioneering collected edition of Monteverdi&#x27;s works, published in 1932. Redlich&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Vespers&quot; was used for the first full modern performance revival at Zurich in February 1935, and for subsequent performances in New York (1937), Switzerland (mid-1940s), Brussels (1946) and London (on 14 May 1946 at Westminster Central Hall).

Due to the political situation he was forced to move back to Vienna in 1937 and, two years later, emigrated to Britain, taking up British nationality in 1947.

==Life in Britain==
The 30 years Redlich spent in Britain were perhaps the most fruitful of all. He was involved in the Morley College concerts during and after the war. On 21 May 1948 the first London performance of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;, was given by the Morley College choir and orchestra in a concert performance, using an edition prepared by Redlich, who played harpsichord accompaniment, directed by Michael Tippett. 

He lived for many years in Letchworth, and in 1941 founded the Letchworth Choral and Orchestral Society, which he led until 1955; at the same time he gave lectures for the Workers&#x27; Educational Association from 1941 to 1943 as well as for the Extra Mural Departments of the Universities of Cambridge and Birmingham from 1942 to 1955. One of his pupils while at Letchworth was the Greek composer Jani Christou. 

His first full-time position since arriving in the UK some 15 years earlier came with his appointment as lecturer in music history at Edinburgh University in 1955, and in 1962 he became a professor of music at the University of Manchester (succeeding Humphrey Procter-Gregg), which awarded him an honorary Doctor of Music degree in 1967. 

Redlich contributed a volume to Eric Blom&#x27;s &quot;Master Musicians Series&quot; in 1955: &quot;Bruckner and Mahler&quot; was a ground-breaking work in English. In the introduction he tells us he met Gustav Mahler as a child and his father was a friend of Mahler. Later he knew members of Mahler&#x27;s family and published, from 1919 onwards, several studies in German of Mahler and his music. His book on Alban Berg, published in 1957, was the first to appear in English, and contains lengthy chapters analysing &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and &quot;Lulu&quot;. In 1966 Redlich was a founding member and the first vice-president of the International Alban Berg Society of New York.

He was a major contributor to the &quot;New Oxford History of Music&quot; and the fifth edition of the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, as well as English editor to &quot;Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart&quot;, for which he wrote many of the entries on English composers. In 1953 he was a member of the editorial board for the &quot;Hallischen Händel-Ausgabe&quot;. He produced critical editions of Handel&#x27;s Concerti Grossi, Op. 6, &quot;Water Music&quot; and &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot; (1962–1966), the first chance for English audiences to hear the works in their original scoring, rather than in the suites heavily orchestrated by Hamilton Harty. He also acted as the general editor of the Eulenburg miniature scores series. 

Redlich married his first wife Elise Gerlach in 1930, and she came to the UK with him. She died in 1959 and he married again in 1961 to Erika Burger. Redlich died in Manchester, where he had been living at 1 Morville Road, after several heart attacks.

<text>Bruno Leopoldo Francesco Sammartino (October 6, 1935 – April 18, 2018) was an Italian-American professional wrestler. He is best known for his time with the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). Sammartino&#x27;s 2,803-day reign as WWF World Heavyweight Champion is the longest in the championship&#x27;s history as well as the longest world title reign in WWE history.

Born in Italy to a family of seven, Sammartino grew up in poverty. As a child, Sammartino survived the German occupation of Italy during World War II. In 1950, he came to the United States with his family, where they would settle in Pittsburgh. Sammartino would later take up bodybuilding before beginning his career as a professional wrestler in 1959.

Dubbed &quot;the Italian Strongman” and &quot;the Strongest Man in the World&quot; early in his career, Sammartino later earned the title &quot;the Living Legend&quot;. Known for his powerful bearhug finishing move, Sammartino wrestled for various territories in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) before joining the WWWF territory.

Already recognized as a future star, Sammartino won the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship in 1963 after beating the inaugural champion, Buddy Rogers, in 48 seconds. He then held the title for a reign of a record 2,803 days – nearly 8 years. While doing so, Sammartino became a popular attraction in Madison Square Garden, selling out the arena numerous times throughout his career. Sammartino would later reclaim the WWF Heavyweight Championship in 1973 for another reign of 1,237 days before gradually retiring from full-time competition.

After his retirement, Sammartino became a vocal critic of the drug use and raunchier storylines that became prevalent in the professional wrestling industry after his retirement but he reconciled with WWE in 2013 and headlined their Hall of Fame ceremony that year. Terry Funk commented that Sammartino &quot;was bigger than wrestling itself&quot;.

== Early life ==
Bruno Leopoldo Francesco Sammartino was born in Pizzoferrato, Abruzzo, Italy, to Alfonso and Emilia Sammartino on October 6, 1935. He was the youngest of seven children, four of whom died during his early childhood. When he was four, his father immigrated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During World War II, Pizzoferrato was invaded by troops of the Waffen SS, leading Emilia to hide Bruno and his siblings in a remote hideout at the top of a nearby mountain called Valla Rocca. During this time, his mother would sneak into their German-occupied town for food and supplies. In 1950, she and the children joined her husband in Pittsburgh.

When the Sammartinos arrived in the U.S., Bruno spoke no English and was sickly from the privations of the war years. This made him an easy target for bullies at Schenley High School. He turned to weightlifting and wrestling to build himself up. His devotion to weightlifting nearly resulted in a berth on the 1956 U.S. Olympic team, which went instead to eventual gold medalist Paul Anderson.

In 1959, Sammartino set a world record in the bench press with a lift of , done without elbow or wrist wraps. When he brought the bar down, he did not bounce it off his chest, but set it there for two seconds before attempting the press. He trained in wrestling with Rex Peery, the University of Pittsburgh team coach.

He also became known for performing strongman stunts in the Pittsburgh area, and sportscaster Bob Prince put him on his television show. It was there that he was spotted by local professional wrestling promoter Rudy Miller, who recruited the young man into the ring.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early years (1959–1963) ===
Sammartino made his professional debut in Pittsburgh on December 17, 1959, pinning Dmitri Grabowski in 19 seconds. Sammartino&#x27;s first match in Madison Square Garden in New York City was on January 2, 1960, defeating Bull Curry in five minutes.
Feeling like he was being held back in the New York territory in favor of National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) star Buddy Rogers, Sammartino gave his notice to Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) owner Vince McMahon Sr. and planned to go to San Francisco to work for Roy Shire. While on his way to California, he missed two bookings in Baltimore and Chicago, and as a result was suspended in those territories. California honored the other state&#x27;s suspension, leaving Sammartino out of work. In his autobiography, Sammartino states that he believed McMahon set him up, by double-booking him and not informing him of his match in Baltimore, as a way of punishment. Sammartino was forced to return to Pittsburgh and found work as a laborer.

On the advice of wrestler Yukon Eric, Sammartino contacted Toronto promoter Frank Tunney hoping to take advantage of Toronto&#x27;s large Italian population. Sammartino made his Toronto debut in March 1962 and very quickly, with the help of self-promotion in local newspapers and radio programs, became an attraction. His ability to speak Italian also ingratiated him with that immigrant population. With Whipper Billy Watson, Sammartino won his first professional wrestling championship in September 1962, the local version of the International Tag Team Championship. Soon, he was in demand by other promoters in different Canadian territories.

Sammartino also challenged NWA World Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz twice for the championship in Canada. One match ended in a draw and the other with Thesz scoring a fluke pin after a collision, despite Sammartino controlling the 20 minute match from the beginning. This match was booked by NWA promoter Sam Muchnick as a preliminary to the forming of the WWWF, to ensure the dominance of the senior organization and its championship.

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation (1963–1981) ===
==== First World Heavyweight Championship reign (1963–1971) ====

After the first WWWF World Champion, Nature Boy Buddy Rogers, was hospitalized three times in April 1963 for chest pains, Vince McMahon Sr. and Toots Mondt made a command decision to make an emergency title switch. Between Antonino Rocca and Bruno Sammartino they went with the younger Sammartino who was 27 years old at the time. The match was scheduled to be concluded quickly so as not to risk Buddy&#x27;s health any further. Promoters Mondt and McMahon Sr. cleared up Sammartino&#x27;s suspension by paying his $500 fine, allowing him to return to wrestling in the United States. Sammartino won the title on May 17, 1963, defeating Rogers in 48 seconds. Sammartino and Rogers faced each other two months later at Madison Square Garden in a tag team match, with Rogers and Johnny Barend defeating Sammartino and Bobo Brazil by 2 falls to 1. Rogers pinned Sammartino for the third and deciding fall. Rogers retired prior to their scheduled title rematch on October 4, 1963, in Jersey City, New Jersey&#x27;s Roosevelt Stadium. Sammartino instead that night had his first match against new number one contender, Gorilla Monsoon. Because Monsoon won the match by disqualification, Sammartino retained his belt.

On December 8, 1969, he teamed with Tony Marino to win the WWF International Tag Team Championship by defeating The Rising Suns (Tanaka and Mitsu Arakawa). Company policy meant that Sammartino could not hold two championships simultaneously, so he was replaced by Victor Rivera. Sammartino held the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship for seven years, eight months, and one day (2,803 days). On January 18, 1971, Sammartino lost the championship at Madison Square Garden to Ivan Koloff. Sammartino recalled the shocked silence that greeted the result, remarking he thought he had damaged his ears. Later that year, he won the International Tag Team Championship for the second time by teaming with Dominic DeNucci. Sammartino took a hiatus from the company in 1971 and 1972 working in Japan, and various territories.

==== Second World Heavyweight Championship reign (1972–1977) ====

Later in 1972, Sammartino was asked back by McMahon Sr. to regain the title. After refusing McMahon Sr.&#x27;s initial offer, Sammartino was offered a percentage of all the gates when he wrestled and a decreased work schedule that only included major arenas. Soon after, Sammartino and then champion Pedro Morales teamed up for a series of tag team matches. In a televised match, Professor Toru Tanaka blinded both men with salt and they were maneuvered into fighting each other. When their eyes cleared, they kept fighting each other. Two weeks later, all syndicated wrestling shows in the WWWF showed a clip of Sammartino and Morales signing a contract for a title match at Shea Stadium. When McMahon Sr. gestured for them to shake hands, both wordlessly turned and walked away. On September 30, 1972, Sammartino and Morales wrestled to a 65-minute draw at Shea Stadium in New York.

Eventually, on December 10, 1973, Sammartino regained the WWWF Heavyweight Championship by defeating Stan Stasiak. During his second reign, on April 26, 1976, Sammartino suffered a legitimate neck fracture in a match against Stan Hansen at Madison Square Garden, when Hansen improperly executed a move and dropped Sammartino on his head. After two months, Sammartino returned and faced Hansen in a rematch on June 25, 1976, at Shea Stadium, which was on the closed circuit TV undercard of the Ali vs. Antonio Inoki match for WWWF cities. The match was rated 1976 &quot;Match of the Year&quot; by &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot;.

In early 1977, Sammartino informed McMahon Sr. that he felt he could no longer continue as champion due to his injuries. On April 30, 1977, he was defeated by Superstar Billy Graham for the title. His second title run lasted three years, four months, and twenty days (1,237 days). Despite a very long series of rematches against Graham, Sammartino was unable to regain the title. His final attempt was in Philadelphia, just a few days before Graham was scheduled to lose the title to Bob Backlund.

==== Later career and initial retirement (1978–1981) ====
After his second reign ended, Sammartino leisurely toured the U.S. and the world. He wrestled then NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race to a one-hour draw in St. Louis. He also wrestled and defeated Blackjack Mulligan, Lord Alfred Hayes, Dick Murdoch, Kenji Shibuya, and &quot;Crippler&quot; Ray Stevens. Also during this time, Sammartino began serving as color commentator for the WWF&#x27;s syndicated programs, &quot;WWF Championship Wrestling&quot; and &quot;WWF All-Star Wrestling&quot;.

On January 22, 1980, his former student Larry Zbyszko turned on him at the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot; show. Sammartino, shocked and hurt by Zbyszko&#x27;s betrayal, vowed to make Zbyszko pay dearly. Their feud culminated on August 9, 1980, in front of 36,295 fans at Shea Stadium. As the main event of 1980&#x27;s Showdown at Shea, Sammartino defeated Zbyszko inside a steel cage. In his autobiography, Hulk Hogan claimed that his match with André the Giant was the real reason for the huge draw at Shea Stadium; however, the feud between Sammartino and Zbyszko sold out everywhere in the build-up to the show. In contrast, Hogan and André headlined exactly one card in White Plains, New York before they wrestled at Shea, and they drew 1,200 in a building that held 3,500.

Sammartino retired from North American wrestling full-time in 1981, in a match that opened the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Sammartino pinned George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele in his match. Sammartino then finished up his full-time career by touring Japan.

=== Return to the WWF (1984–1988) ===

It was during this time Sammartino found out through Angelo Savoldi, a recently fired office employee of Capitol Wrestling Corporation, that he had been cheated by Vince McMahon Sr. on the promised gate percentages for his entire second title run. Sammartino filed suit against McMahon Sr. and his Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The suit was eventually settled out of court by McMahon Sr&#x27;s son, Vince McMahon after his father had died, and included an agreement for Sammartino to return to the company as a commentator.

At the inaugural WrestleMania on March 31, 1985, Sammartino was in his son David&#x27;s corner for his match against Brutus Beefcake. The match ended in a double-disqualification after the Sammartinos began brawling with Beefcake and his manager Johnny Valiant. He returned to in-ring action soon after with his son, as they wrestled against Beefcake and Valiant at Madison Square Garden. The Sammartinos also teamed against &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; Paul Orndorff and Bobby &quot;the Brain&quot; Heenan in various arenas.

Sammartino&#x27;s highest-profile feud during this run was with &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage. An irate Sammartino attacked Savage during a TV interview, after Savage bragged about injuring Ricky Steamboat, by driving the timekeeper&#x27;s bell into Steamboat&#x27;s throat during a televised match. Sammartino defeated Savage in a lumberjack match for the WWE Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship via disqualification at the Boston Garden. This allowed Savage to keep the championship, as titles cannot change hands via countout or disqualification. He was often teamed with Tito Santana and his old enemy George &quot;the Animal&quot; Steele (who was a fan favorite at this point in his career) to wrestle Savage and &quot;Adorable&quot; Adrian Adonis. The climax of their feud came was a victory for Sammartino and Santana in a steel cage match in Madison Square Garden. Sammartino also engaged in a feud with &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper after Piper insulted his heritage on a segment of &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; at Madison Square Garden. Sammartino faced Piper in both singles and tag team matches. Sammartino teamed with Paul Orndorff in his matches against Piper, while Piper would tag with his &quot;bodyguard&quot;, Ace &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Orton. Sammartino would eventually get the upper hand in the feud, by defeating Piper in a steel cage match at the Boston Garden. In 1986, Sammartino competed in a 20-man battle royal at WrestleMania 2 at the Rosemont Horizon in Chicago.

Sammartino&#x27;s final match was at a WWF house show in Baltimore on August 29, 1987, where he teamed up with Hulk Hogan to defeat King Kong Bundy and One Man Gang in the main event. Sammartino continued doing commentary on &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot; until March 1988.

=== Non-wrestling roles and WWE Hall of Fame (1988–2018)===
After leaving the WWE, Sammartino became an outspoken critic of the path on which Vincent K. McMahon had taken professional wrestling. He particularly criticized the use of steroids and &quot;vulgar&quot; storylines. He appeared in the media in opposition to the WWE on such shows as &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;, &quot;Geraldo&quot;, and CNN.

Sammartino worked as a commentator for the Universal Wrestling Federation. On October 28, 1989, Sammartino made a special appearance at the NWA pay-per-view event Halloween Havoc, where he was the special guest referee in a &quot;Thunderdome&quot; cage match which featured Ric Flair and Sting taking on Terry Funk and The Great Muta. Sammartino worked several WCW events in a minor analysis role in the early 1990s, as well as a brief run doing color commentary with Jim Ross on &quot;Saturday Night&quot; in 1992. He also acted as special guest referee in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) for a series of matches between Flair and Randy Savage in June 1996.

In 2006, he signed an independent deal with Jakks Pacific to produce an action figure, which is part of the WWE Classic Superstars line, Series 10.

On March 25, 2010, Sammartino was honoured at the 74th annual Dapper Dan Dinner, a popular awards and charity fundraising event in Pittsburgh, with a lifetime achievement award, for which fellow former &quot;Studio Wrestling&quot; personalities Bill Cardille, &quot;Jumping&quot; Johnny DeFazio, Dominic DeNucci, Frank Durso, and referee Andy &quot;Kid&quot; DePaul were all present.
In 2013, Sammartino accepted an invitation for induction into the WWE Hall of Fame, after having declined several times in prior years. He finally accepted the offer to join because he was satisfied with the way the company had addressed his concerns about rampant drug use as well as vulgarity. The ceremony took place at Madison Square Garden on April 6, 2013, and Sammartino was inducted by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sammartino appeared on October 7, 2013, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and received a birthday greeting in his hometown of Pittsburgh. On March 28, 2015, Sammartino inducted Larry Zbyszko into the WWE Hall of Fame.

== Other media ==
Sammartino is included in two DVDs summarizing his career and life: &quot;Bruno Returns to Italy With Bruno Sammartino&quot; (2006) and &quot;Bruno Sammartino: Behind the Championship Belt&quot; (2006). Both were only released in Pittsburgh. Sammartino is honored on the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame.

=== Video games ===
== Personal life ==

Sammartino was married to his wife Carol from 1959 until his death in 2018. They had three sons together, David and fraternal twins Danny and Darryl. They were grandparents of four grandchildren. The Sammartinos lived in Ross Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh from 1965 on. In 1998, he said he had been estranged from David since retiring from wrestling against David&#x27;s wishes for a tag team.

On April 6, 2013, Sammartino received the Key to the City in Jersey City, New Jersey. May 17, 2013 was declared &quot;Bruno Sammartino Day&quot; in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. In 2013, Sammartino appeared as one of the Board of Governors in the nationally televised 69th Annual Columbus Day Parade.

=== Backstage incidents ===
In the late 1960s, Sammartino was involved in a fight with former Pennsylvania Athletic Commissioner Joe Cimino. Cimino was new to his post and intervened in a match finish involving Sammartino, who took a shot at Cimino in the ring and the argument continued backstage. Sammartino ended up in a screaming match with Cimino on Pittsburgh&#x27;s local &quot;Studio Wrestling&quot; program, and Cimino suspended him for a month. Irvin Muchnick mentioned the incident in his book, &quot;Wrestling Babylon&quot;.

In his autobiography, &quot;The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption&quot;, Bill Watts told of witnessing a backstage incident between Sammartino and Gorilla Monsoon. Watts wrote that Monsoon &quot;soon found himself in deep water&quot; when messing with Sammartino, and he did not go into further detail on the incident out of respect for Monsoon.

On July 26, 2004, Sammartino and Ric Flair were involved in the &quot;Who snubbed who?&quot; non-confrontation at the Mellon Arena in Pittsburgh. Flair had denigrated Sammartino&#x27;s wrestling ability in his book &quot;To Be the Man&quot;. Flair said Sammartino refused to shake his hand at the event, while Sammartino said Flair saw him coming down the hall, turned, and rushed away.

==Death==
Sammartino underwent heart surgery in 2011. He died on April 18, 2018, at the age of 82 from multiple organ failure due to heart problems following a two-month hospitalization. WWE honored his life with a ten-bell salute before a house show in Cape Town, South Africa later that day, and again on the 23 April episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in St. Louis, Missouri. Mayor Bill Peduto remembered him as &quot;one of the greatest ambassadors the city of Pittsburgh ever had.&quot;

<text>Nathan Irving Hentoff (June 10, 1925 – January 7, 2017) was an American historian, novelist, jazz and country music critic, and syndicated columnist for United Media. Hentoff was a columnist for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; from 1958 to 2009. Following his departure from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Hentoff became a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and continued writing his music column for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, which published his works until his death. He often wrote on First Amendment issues, vigorously defending the freedom of the press.

Hentoff was formerly a columnist for: &quot;Down Beat&quot;, &quot;JazzTimes&quot;, &quot;Legal Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, &quot;The Progressive&quot;, &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; and &quot;Free Inquiry&quot;. He was a staff writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and his writings were also published in: &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Jewish World Review&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Commonweal&quot;, and &quot;Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Hentoff was born on June 10, 1925, in Boston, Massachusetts, the firstborn child of Simon, a traveling salesman, and Lena (née Katzenberg). His parents were Jewish Russian immigrants. As a teen, Hentoff attended Boston Latin School and worked for Frances Sweeney on the &quot;Boston City Reporter&quot;, investigating antisemitic hate groups. Sweeney was a major influence on Hentoff; his memoir, &quot;Boston Boy&quot;, is dedicated to her. He played soprano saxophone and clarinet as a youth, and became interested in jazz after listening to Artie Shaw play. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree with highest honors, in 1946 from Northeastern University. That same year he enrolled for graduate study at Harvard University. In 1950, he attended Sorbonne University in Paris, France, on a Fulbright Scholarship.

==Career==
Hentoff began his career in broadcast journalism while hosting a weekly jazz program on Boston radio station WMEX. In the 1940s, he hosted two radio shows on WMEX: &quot;JazzAlbum&quot; and &quot;From Bach to Bartók&quot;. In the early 1950s he continued to present a jazz program on WMEX, and as a Staff Announcer for WMEX, he regularly hosted remote broadcasts from the &quot;Savoy&quot;, and &quot;Storyville&quot;, two Boston clubs run by George Wein, and during that period was an announcer on the program &quot;Evolution of Jazz&quot; on WGBH-FM. In 2013, the &quot;Evolution of Jazz&quot; series was contributed to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting by the University of Maryland&#x27;s National Public Broadcasting Archives as part of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) collection.

By the late 1950s, he was co-hosting the program &quot;The Scope of Jazz&quot; on WBAI-FM in New York City. He went on to write many books on jazz and politics.

In 1952, Hentoff joined &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine as a columnist. The following year, he moved to New York to become the Chicago-based magazine&#x27;s New York editor. He was fired in 1957, he alleged, because he attempted to hire an African-American writer.

Hentoff co-wrote &quot;Hear Me Talkin&#x27; to Ya: The Story of Jazz by the Men Who Made It&quot; (1955) with Nat Shapiro. The book includes interviews with jazz musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie and Duke Ellington. Hentoff co-founded &quot;The Jazz Review&quot; in 1958, a magazine that he co-edited with Martin Williams until 1961. In 1960 he served as artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) director for the short-lived jazz label Candid Records, which released albums by Charles Mingus, Cecil Taylor, and Max Roach.

Around the same time, Hentoff began freelance writing for &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Playboy,&quot; &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;New York Herald Tribune,&quot; &quot;Commonweal&quot;, and &quot;The Reporter&quot;. From 1958 to 2009, he wrote weekly columns on education, civil liberties, politics, and capital punishment for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. He also wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (1960–1986), &quot;The Washington Post&quot; (1984–2000), and &quot;The Washington Times&quot;. He worked with the Jazz Foundation of America to help American jazz and blues musicians in need. He wrote many articles for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot; to draw attention to the plight of America&#x27;s pioneering jazz and blues musicians.

Hentoff also wrote many novels for young adults, including &quot;I&#x27;m Really Dragged But Nothing Gets Me Down&quot; (1968), &quot;This School is Driving Me Crazy&quot; (1976), &quot;Blues for Charlie Darwin&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Day They Came To Arrest The Book&quot; (1983). Writing about the latter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Alyssa Rosenberg commented that &quot;One of the useful — or depressing — things about reading Hentoff’s YA polemic, which was published all the way back in 1982, is how similar the novel’s conflicts are to our present debates.&quot;

Beginning in February 2008, Hentoff was a weekly contributing columnist at WorldNetDaily. In January 2009, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, which had published his commentary and criticism for fifty years, announced that he had been laid off. He then went on to write for &quot;United Features&quot;, &quot;Jewish World Review&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. He joined the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, as a senior fellow in February 2009.

In 2013, &quot;The Pleasures of Being Out of Step&quot;, a biographical film about Hentoff, explored his career in jazz and as a First Amendment advocate. The independent documentary, produced and directed by David L. Lewis, won the Grand Jury prize in the Metropolis competition at the DOC NYC festival and played in theaters across the country.

==Political views, commentary, and activism==
Hentoff espoused generally liberal views on domestic policy and civil liberties, but in the 1980s, he began articulating more socially conservative positions especially in regard to medical ethics and reproductive rights. He was opposed to abortion, voluntary euthanasia, and the selective medical treatment of severely disabled infants. He believed that a consistent life ethic should be the viewpoint of a genuine civil libertarian, arguing that all human rights are at risk when the rights of one group of people are diminished, that human rights are interconnected, and that people deny others&#x27; human rights at their peril.

===Antisemitism===
Hentoff believed antisemitism was rampant.

===Social and individual freedom===
Hentoff was a civil libertarian and free speech activist who opposed abortion and capital punishment. The &quot;American Conservative&quot; magazine called him &quot;the only Jewish, atheist, pro-life, libertarian hawk in America.&quot;

Although he supported the American Civil Liberties Union for many years, he criticized the organization in 1999 for defending government-enforced speech codes in universities and the workplace. He served on the board of advisors for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, another civil liberties group. His book &quot;Free Speech for Me—But Not for Thee&quot; outlined his views on free speech and criticized those who favored censorship &quot;in any form.&quot;

===Vietnam===
Hentoff agitated against the Vietnam War and against the United States&#x27; participation. Although he said he was a &quot;hardcore anti-communist&quot; since the age of 15, he had &quot;no illusions about the corrupt, undemocratic government of South Vietnam.&quot; After the war&#x27;s end, Hentoff, Joan Baez, and Ginetta Sagan of Amnesty International repeatedly protested what he called &quot;the horrifying abuses of human rights [committed] by the Vietnamese Communist regime.&quot;

===Middle East===
Hentoff defended the existence of the state of Israel. He criticized Israeli policies such as the absence of due process for Palestinians and the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. His opposition to Israel&#x27;s invasion of Lebanon led three rabbis symbolically to &quot;excommunicate&quot; him from Judaism. He commented, &quot;I would have told them about my life as a heretic, a tradition I keep precisely because I am a Jew.&quot; He supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

===War on terror===
Hentoff criticized the Clinton administration for the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. He also criticized the Bush administration for &quot;authoritarian&quot; policies such as the Patriot Act and other civil liberties restrictions legislated through invoking the ostensible need for homeland security.

An ardent critic of the G. W. Bush administration&#x27;s expansion of presidential power, in 2008 Hentoff called for the new president to deal with the &quot;noxious residue of the Bush-Cheney war against terrorism&quot;. According to Hentoff, among the casualties of that war have been &quot;survivors, if they can be found, of CIA secret prisons (&#x27;black sites&#x27;), victims of CIA kidnapping renditions, and American citizens locked up indefinitely as &#x27;unlawful enemy combatants″&quot;. He wanted lawyer John Yoo to be prosecuted for war crimes.

===Presidential politics===
Hentoff stated that while he had been prepared to support Barack Obama enthusiastically in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, his view changed after looking into Obama&#x27;s voting record on abortion. During President Obama&#x27;s first year, Hentoff praised him for ending policies of CIA renditions, but criticized him for failing to end George W. Bush&#x27;s practice of &quot;state torture&quot; of prisoners.

==Awards and honors==
Hentoff was named a Guggenheim Fellow in 1972. He won the American Bar Association&#x27;s Silver Gavel Award in 1980 for his columns on law and criminal justice. In 1983, he was awarded the American Library Association&#x27;s Imroth Award for Intellectual Freedom. In 1985, he received an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the Northeastern University. In 1995, he was honored with the National Press Foundation&#x27;s Award in recognition of his lifetime distinguished contributions to journalism. In 2004, Hentoff was named one of six NEA Jazz Masters by the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts, thus becoming the first nonmusician in history to win this award. That same year, the Boston Latin School honored him as alumnus of the year. In 2005, he was one of the first recipients of the Human Life Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Great Defender of Life&quot; award.

==Personal life==
Hentoff grew up attending an Orthodox synagogue in Boston. He recalled that as a youth, he would travel around the city with his father during the High Holidays to listen to various cantors and compare notes on their performances. He said cantors made &quot;sacred texts compellingly clear to the heart,&quot; and he collected their recordings. In later life, Hentoff was an atheist, and sardonically described himself as &quot;a member of the Proud and Ancient Order of Stiff-Necked Jewish Atheists&quot;. He expressed sympathy for Israel&#x27;s Peace Now movement.

Hentoff married three times, first to Miriam Sargent in 1950; the marriage was childless and the couple divorced that same year. His second wife was Trudi Bernstein, whom he married on September 2, 1954, and with whom he had two children, Miranda and Jessica. (Jessica Hentoff is the founder of Circus Harmony, a non-profit social circus and circus school in St. Louis, Missouri.) He divorced his second wife in August 1959. On August 15, 1959, he married his third wife, Margot Goodman, with whom he had two children: Nicholas and Thomas. The couple remained together until he died of natural causes at his Manhattan apartment on January 7, 2017, aged 91.

<doc id="332389" wikidata="Q419143" url="?curid=332389" title="Anastrozole">
<text>Anastrozole, sold under the brand name Arimidex among others, is an antiestrogenic medication used in addition to other treatments for breast cancer. Specifically it is used for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. It has also been used to prevent breast cancer in those at high risk. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects of anastrozole include hot flashes, altered mood, joint pain, and nausea. Severe side effects include an increased risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Anastrozole is in the aromatase-inhibiting family of medications. It works by blocking the production of estrogens in the body, and hence has antiestrogenic effects.
Anastrozole was patented in 1987 and was approved for medical use in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Anastrozole is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 179th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

===Breast cancer===
Anastrozole is used in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer in women. The Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial was of localized breast cancer and women received either anastrozole, the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, or both for five years, followed by five years of follow-up. After more than 5 years the group that received anastrozole had better results than the tamoxifen group. The trial suggested that anastrozole is the preferred medical therapy for postmenopausal women with localized estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.

===Early puberty===
Anastrozole is used at a dosage of 0.5 to 1 mg/day in combination with the antiandrogen bicalutamide in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty, for instance due to familial male-limited precocious puberty (testotoxicosis) and McCune–Albright syndrome, in boys.

===Available forms===
Anastrozole is available in the form of 1 mg oral tablets. No alternative forms or routes are available.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications of anastrozole include hypersensitivity to anastrozole or any other component of anastrozole formulations, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. Hypersensitivity reactions to anastrozole including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria have been observed.

==Side effects==
Common side effects of anastrozole (≥10% incidence) include hot flashes,
asthenia, arthritis, pain, arthralgia, hypertension, depression, nausea and vomiting, rash, osteoporosis, bone fractures, back pain, insomnia, headache, bone pain, peripheral edema, coughing, dyspnea, pharyngitis, and lymphedema. Serious but rare adverse effects (&lt;0.1% incidence) include skin reactions such as lesions, ulcers, or blisters; allergic reactions with swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and/or throat that may cause difficulty swallowing or breathing; and abnormal liver function tests as well as hepatitis.

== Interactions ==

Anastrozole is thought to have clinically negligible inhibitory effects on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. As a result, it is thought that drug interactions of anastrozole with cytochrome P450 substrates are unlikely. No clinically significant drug interactions have been reported with anastrozole as of 2003.

Anastrozole does not affect circulating levels of tamoxifen or its major metabolite &quot;N&quot;-desmethyltamoxifen. However, tamoxifen has been found to decrease steady-state area-under-the-curve levels of anastrozole by 27%. But estradiol levels were not significantly different in the group that received both anastrozole and tamoxifen compared to the anastrozole alone group, so the decrease in anastrozole levels is not thought to be clinically important.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Anastrozole works by reversibly binding to the aromatase enzyme, and through competitive inhibition blocks the conversion of androgens to estrogens in peripheral (extragonadal) tissues. The medication has been found to achieve 96.7% to 97.3% inhibition of aromatase at a dosage of 1 mg/day and 98.1% inhibition of aromatase at a dosage of 10 mg/day in humans. As such, 1 mg/day is considered to be the minimal dosage required to achieve maximal suppression of aromatase with anastrozole. This decrease in aromatase activity results in an at least 85% decrease in estradiol levels in postmenopausal women. Levels of corticosteroids and other adrenal steroids are unaffected by anastrozole.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The bioavailability of anastrozole in humans is unknown, but it was found to be well-absorbed in animals. Absorption of anastrozole is linear over a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day in humans and does not change with repeated administration. Food does not significantly influence the extent of absorption of anastrozole. Peak levels of anastrozole occur a median 3 hours after administration, but with a wide range of 2 to 12 hours. Steady-state levels of anastrozole are achieved within 7 to 10 days of continuous administration, with 3.5-fold accumulation. However, maximal suppression of estradiol levels occurs within 3 or 4 days of therapy.

Active efflux of anastrozole by P-glycoprotein at the blood–brain barrier has been found to limit the central nervous system penetration of anastrozole in rodents, whereas this was not the case with letrozole and vorozole. As such, anastrozole may have peripheral selectivity in humans, although this has yet to be confirmed. In any case, estradiol is synthesized peripherally and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier, so anastrozole would still expected to reduce estradiol levels in the central nervous system to a certain degree. The plasma protein binding of anastrozole is 40%.

The metabolism of anastrozole is by N-dealkylation, hydroxylation, and glucuronidation. Inhibition of aromatase is due to anastrozole itself rather than to metabolites, with the major circulating metabolite being inactive. The elimination half-life of anastrozole is 40 to 50 hours (1.7 to 2.1 days). This allows for convenient once-daily administration. The medication is eliminated predominantly by metabolism in the liver (83 to 85%) but also by residual excretion by the kidneys unchanged (11%). Anastrozole is excreted primarily in urine but also to a lesser extent in feces.

==Chemistry==
Anastrozole is a nonsteroidal benzyl triazole. It is also known as α,α,α&#x27;,α&#x27;-tetramethyl-5-(1&quot;H&quot;-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-&quot;m&quot;-benzenediacetonitrile. Anastrozole is structurally related to letrozole, fadrozole, and vorozole, with all being classified as azoles.

==History==
Anastrozole was patented by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in 1987 and was approved for medical use, specifically the treatment of breast cancer, in 1995.

==Society and culture==

===Generic names===
&quot;Anastrozole&quot; is the generic name of the drug and its , , , and .

===Brand names===
Anastrozole is primarily sold under the brand name Arimidex. However, it is also marketed under a variety of other brand names throughout the world.

===Availability===
Anastrozole is available widely throughout the world.

==Research==
Anastrozole is surprisingly ineffective at treating gynecomastia, in contrast to selective estrogen receptor modulators like tamoxifen.

Anastrozole was under development for the treatment of female infertility but did not complete development and hence was never approved for this indication.

An anastrozole and levonorgestrel vaginal ring (developmental code name BAY 98–7196) was under development for use as a hormonal contraceptive and treatment for endometriosis, but development was discontinued in November 2018 and the formulation was never marketed.

Anastrozole increases testosterone levels in males and has been studied as an alternative method of androgen replacement therapy in men with hypogonadism. However, there are concerns about its long-term influence on bone mineral density in this patient population, as well as other adverse effects.

<text>Phyllis Ayame Whitney (September 9, 1903 – February 8, 2008) was an American mystery writer of more than 70 novels.

Born in Yokohama, Japan to American parents in 1903, she spent her early years in Asia. After the death of her parents she moved to Chicago where she lived with her aunt. Later in life, Whitney moved to Staten Island, New York and resided there for 20 years with her daughter and second husband, Lovell Jahnke. Staten Island became the inspiration and setting for several of her books.

A rarity for her genre, she wrote mysteries for both the juvenile and the adult markets, many of which feature exotic settings. Although she was often described as a Gothic novelist, a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; even dubbing her &quot;The Queen of the American Gothics&quot;, Whitney claimed to hate this title. She preferred to say she wrote ”romantic novels of suspense&quot;.

In 1961, her book &quot;The Mystery of the Haunted Pool&quot; won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Juvenile Novel; she duplicated the honor in 1964 for &quot;The Mystery of the Hidden Hand&quot;. In 1988, the MWA gave her a Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement. In 1990, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Romance Writers of America. Whitney died of pneumonia at age 104 on February 8, 2008.

A collection of Whitney&#x27;s writing, correspondence, and photographs are available at the College of Staten Island&#x27;s Archives and Special Collections.

<doc id="332400" wikidata="Q1136987" url="?curid=332400" title="Shadow the Hedgehog">
<text>is a character created by the Japanese game developers Takashi Iizuka, Shiro Maekawa, and Kazuyuki Hoshino. He is a major character in Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise. Shadow is an anthropomorphic black hedgehog created by Professor Gerald Robotnik, the grandfather of Doctor Eggman. Shadow shares design traits and attributes with Sonic the Hedgehog. He is an antihero who has good intentions but will do whatever it takes to accomplish his goals, putting him at odds with Sonic.

Shadow first appeared in the Dreamcast game &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; (2001), although he was conceived during the development of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (1998). Iizuka devised the concept, while Maekawa developed his character and Hoshino designed him. Influences included the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character Vegeta, the Image Comics character Spawn, the &quot;Sonic&quot; character Metal Sonic, and speed skaters. Sonic Team envisioned Shadow as a one-off character who would only appear in &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, but his popularity among fans led to his inclusion in subsequent games, beginning with &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; (2003), in which he forms &quot;Team Dark&quot; alongside Rouge the Bat and E-123 Omega.

Shadow has featured in many &quot;Sonic&quot; games, including the standalone games &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; (2005) and &quot;Shadow Generations&quot; (2024). Shadow is one of the few &quot;Sonic&quot; characters to have a full character arc; after witnessing the death of his best friend Maria Robotnik, he initially seeks revenge, but later vows to keep his promise to her that he would protect the world from danger. After losing his memories, he seeks to recover them, reaffirming his promise and gaining a stronger sense of identity upon doing so. Kōji Yusa voices Shadow in Japan, while his English voice has been provided by David Humphrey, Jason Griffith, and Kirk Thornton. Keanu Reeves voices him in the feature film &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (2024).

Shadow is one of the most popular &quot;Sonic&quot; characters and was named one of the greatest video game characters by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in 2011. However, he has proven divisive among video game journalists. Some praised his role in &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; and his levels&#x27; preservation of the &quot;Sonic&quot; theme, but others criticized his dark and brooding characterization, particularly in later games, and ranked him among the worst &quot;Sonic&quot; characters. The &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; game received generally unfavorable reviews, though it sold well. In the third installment of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; film franchise, Reeves&#x27;s adaptation received critical praise for his moody portrayal of the character&#x27;s stoicism, empathy and darkness.

==Role in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;==
===Video games===
Shadow is an anthropomorphic black hedgehog appearing in Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series of platform games and its various spin-offs. He first appeared in the 2001 installment &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, the final &quot;Sonic&quot; game released for a Sega video game console. His roles in the games vary. Some, such as the main series games &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; (2003), and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (2006) feature him as a major playable character, and he is the protagonist of the spin-off &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; (2005) and a downloadable content (DLC) package for &quot;Sonic Forces&quot; (2017). Others, such as the anniversary game &quot;Sonic Generations&quot; (2011), limit him to a non-playable role. He also appears as one of the characters who can be summoned using the Assist Trophy item in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

Shadow is a mysterious, sharp-witted, and brooding antihero. While his ultimate goal is to protect the world from danger, he dislikes humanity, and once he has set a goal, he does whatever it takes to accomplish it. This often causes him to take risks without thinking them through and puts him at odds with series protagonist Sonic the Hedgehog. Although a loner, Shadow collaborates with treasure hunter Rouge the Bat and robot E-123 Omega in games such as &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (2006), and &quot;Sonic Forces&quot;. Shadow allies with Sonic in some games, but also does so with Doctor Eggman in &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; and &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;.

Shadow shares many similarities with Sonic. Visually, &quot;GameSpot&quot; Ben Stahl described Shadow as &quot;an evil version of Sonic himself—similar in appearance, but with darker skin, more angled eyes, and a fearsome snarl instead of Sonic&#x27;s trademark grin.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; Justin Leeper said that if Sonic was Superman, then Shadow would be his Batman. The characters control similarly in games, as both share skills and the ability to run at great speeds. Shadow has unique attributes in some games, such as his uses of firearms and vehicles in &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, respectively. He can also use the Chaos Emeralds to perform &quot;Chaos Control&quot;—allowing him to distort time—and create weapons like spears. Like Sonic, Shadow can transform into a &quot;Super&quot; form, giving him special powers.

===Other media===
Outside of the video game series, Shadow appears in the anime series &quot;Sonic X&quot;, which adapts the story of the &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games, as well as &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; and &quot;Sonic Prime&quot;. The original Japanese cast from the games reprised their roles for the former, while Jason Griffith (who also voiced Sonic) voiced Shadow in its English dub by 4Kids Entertainment. In the &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; (2014–2017) spin-off franchise, Shadow appears in the 2014 games &quot;Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric&quot; for the Wii U and &quot;Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, as well as the television episodes &quot;It Takes a Village to Defeat a Hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Eggman: The Video Game&quot;.

Ian Hanlin voices Shadow in the animated Netflix series &quot;Sonic Prime&quot; (2022–2024). After Sonic inadvertently opens the path to the Paradox Prism for Eggman, Shadow has a vague vision of the universe&#x27;s shatter and tries to prevent it but fails, he manages to escape it using Chaos Control and is trapped in the void between Shatterspaces. Shadow also appears in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic books published by Archie Comics and IDW Publishing, and his likeness has been used in &quot;Sonic&quot; merchandise. Shadow made his live-action debut in a non-speaking cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene of the 2022 film &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, and was voiced by Keanu Reeves in the sequel &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;, released on December 20, 2024.

==Development==

Shadow was created by Takashi Iizuka and Shiro Maekawa, who respectively served as director and writer of &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;. During the development of the original &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (1998), Sonic Team conceived a black hedgehog who equaled or exceeded Sonic&#x27;s coolness. The idea was revived during brainstorming sessions for &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, as the game features two &quot;good vs. evil&quot; storylines. Iizuka wanted to appeal to American audiences with an antihero, a popular character archetype in the US at the time. Concept art indicates that Shadow was primarily inspired by the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character Vegeta, but Iizuka denied this, instead citing the Image Comics character Spawn as an influence.

Shadow was initially named &quot;Terios&quot; (&quot;reflection of&quot;), referencing his role as Sonic&#x27;s doppelganger. He was renamed Shadow after another new character, a bat, who became Rouge. Sonic Team tasked Maekawa with developing Shadow, a task he found challenging. One night, while he brainstormed lines for a scene in which Sonic confronts Shadow for impersonating him, Maekawa came up with Shadow&#x27;s first line: &quot;Hmph, aren&#x27;t you the fake one here?&quot; From here, Maekawa envisioned the hedgehog as a delicate, pure character who would refer to himself using the more humble Japanese pronoun . Iizuka made sure that Shadow&#x27;s introduction also brought new events to the game, as he wanted players to care about the character.

Kazuyuki Hoshino designed Shadow. Like he had when he designed Metal Sonic for &quot;Sonic CD&quot; (1993), Hoshino imagined Shadow in a confrontation with Sonic to produce the design. Early Shadow designs bore a strong resemblance to Sonic, with darker colors, droopier spines, and a scar on the left of his face. Hoshino said these designs reflected Shadow being originally &quot;more obviously evil&quot;; he called the initial incarnation &quot;Terios the Prisoner&quot;. For the final design, Hoshino remembered that he had designed Metal Sonic with a jet engine to distinguish him from Sonic. Likewise, he drew inspiration from speed skaters for Shadow&#x27;s design since he wanted Shadow to rival Sonic&#x27;s speed in a unique manner.

&quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; was intended to be Shadow&#x27;s only appearance, but his popularity among fans led to him returning in &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;. Additionally, Sonic Team wanted to feature Shadow in a spin-off game. By 2005, Sonic Team was interested in developing a high-speed shooter game. They chose to focus on Shadow—whom they felt would provide &quot;the perfect venue... to try our hand at this genre&quot;—leading to the development of &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;. Series co-creator Yuji Naka hoped &quot;Shadow&quot; would lead to a spin-off series about the character. When developing Shadow&#x27;s design and world, Sonic Team was influenced by films such as &quot;Underworld&quot; (2003), &quot;Constantine&quot; (2005), and those in the &quot;Terminator&quot; series.

The team abandoned Shadow&#x27;s shooting gameplay when working on &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; in 2006. Instead, director Shun Nakamura emphasized combat to differentiate his gameplay from that of Sonic&#x27;s; while Sonic was designed for speedy platforming, Shadow was designed for fighting enemies. After &quot;Sonic and the Black Knight&quot; (2009), Shadow did not appear as a playable character in a &quot;Sonic&quot; platformer for some time, until the release of &quot;Sonic Forces&quot; in 2017. Nakamura explained that Sonic Team brought Shadow back for &quot;Sonic Forces&quot; so it would appeal to fans of the &quot;Adventure&quot; games, as the character is &quot;extremely popular&quot; among that group. Iizuka has commented that another Shadow-oriented spin-off is a possibility.

===Voice portrayal===
In Japan, Kōji Yusa voices Shadow. Shadow&#x27;s English voice actor has changed several times. David Humphrey was the first to assume the role, but was replaced by Jason Griffith, who voiced Shadow and Sonic in the English dub of the anime series &quot;Sonic X&quot; (2003–2006), and in video games beginning with &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; in 2005. Kirk Thornton has voiced Shadow since 2010, starting with &quot;Sonic Free Riders&quot;. In &quot;Sonic Prime&quot;, Shadow is voiced by Ian Hanlin. Canadian actor Keanu Reeves voices Shadow in the 2024 film &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;, reprising his role in downloadable content for &quot;Sonic X Shadow Generations&quot;.

==Character biography==
Within the &quot;Sonic&quot; series&#x27; fictional universe, Shadow the Hedgehog was created by Professor Gerald Robotnik through genetic engineering. His creation was part of an experiment, &quot;Project Shadow&quot;, meant to cure his granddaughter Maria from a deadly illness. While Shadow and Maria formed a strong bond, the United Federation government and a military organization, the Guardian Units of Nations (GUN), deemed him a threat. GUN raided the Space Colony ARK on which Maria and Shadow lived, killing the former as she sent Shadow to Earth in an escape pod. Shadow was later recovered by GUN and placed in suspended animation. Maria&#x27;s death traumatized Shadow, who vowed to keep his promise to her that he would protect the world from danger. In &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, Gerald&#x27;s grandson, Doctor Eggman, learns of Shadow and revives him as part of a plan to conquer the world and defeat Sonic the Hedgehog. Believing that the promise he made was one of revenge on humanity, Shadow agrees to help Eggman, framing Sonic for their evil deeds. However, Shadow eventually allies himself with Sonic to prevent the world&#x27;s destruction after he remembers the promise he made to Maria. However, he is unable to handle the power of all seven Chaos Emeralds in a Super State as well as Sonic, plummeting to Earth from space after the final boss fight.

Shadow is presumed dead until &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;; Rouge the Bat discovers him alive in an Eggman base during a search. He remembers nothing except his name and Maria&#x27;s death, forming &quot;Team Dark&quot; with Rouge and E-123 Omega to find Eggman and learn of his past. In &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;, Shadow, still experiencing amnesia, becomes caught in a three-way war between Eggman, GUN, and the Black Arms, an alien army led by Black Doom. Shadow can choose to help GUN, Sonic and his friends, Eggman, or the Black Arms. At the end of the game, Shadow recovers from his amnesia and learns the truth about his past, including that Gerald created him using Black Doom&#x27;s DNA. Black Doom uses that in an attempt control him, but Shadow stands up to him and ultimately defeats him. After the battle, Shadow chooses to put the past behind him and move on, and in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; is depicted as working with GUN. In &quot;Shadow Generations&quot;, Shadow, believing the Black Arms have resurfaced, returns to the ARK, where he is thrust into the dimension of White Space by the Time Eater (concurrently during the events of &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;). Along his journey, he manifests mysterious Doom Powers, which he uses to fight against Black Doom; Shadow also encounters Gerald and Maria, taken from another point in time, who assist in helping Shadow control his new powers as he confronts and destroys Black Doom once and for all. Upon his triumph, Maria and Gerald return to their time period as Shadow joins Rouge to help Sonic against the Time Eater.

==Reception and legacy==
Shadow quickly proved popular among players of &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, contributing to his return in later games. Additionally, responses to his introduction were favorable; critics considered his levels in &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; among the game&#x27;s highlights. &quot;GameSpot&quot; Shane Satterfield wrote Shadow&#x27;s levels were exciting and helped preserve the general theme of &quot;Sonic&quot; games, and wished they had been more plentiful. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; Mark Reece similarly felt Shadow&#x27;s levels successfully adapted the &quot;Sonic&quot; formula to 3D. However, despite strong sales, the 2005 &quot;Shadow&quot; game received generally unfavorable reviews and, according to &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; Thomas East, tarnished the character&#x27;s reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONM: best/worst&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews for &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; criticized numerous aspects of the character, such as his controls, use of firearms, and characterization. &quot;Game Informer&quot; Matt Helgeson decried Shadow as a character who lacked personality and mocked his &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;laughable&quot; Clint Eastwood rasp, while &quot;GameSpy&quot; Patrick Klepek felt the game was proof the &quot;Sonic&quot; series had jumped the shark. Similarly, &quot;1UP.com&quot; Shane Bettenhausen compared Shadow to Poochie, a character from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot; (1997) symbolic of creating a new character simply to boost a flagging series. Klepek thought guns made sense for Shadow&#x27;s character but did not have a compelling use in the game, and expressed hope Sonic Team would &quot;[bury] him alongside the same graves as the third-tier of characters from &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;.&quot; Critics reviewing the 2006 &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; considered Shadow&#x27;s gameplay slightly better than that of Sonic&#x27;s but felt it did not add enough to the experience, while &quot;Den of Geek&quot; Chris Freiberg wrote that the Shadow DLC for &quot;Sonic Forces&quot; added some replay value to a game he criticized for its short length.

Reviewers have called Shadow—both the game and the character—an ill-advised attempt to bring a sense of maturity to the &quot;Sonic&quot; series. Indeed, &quot;IGN&quot; Levi Buchanan and &quot;1UP&quot;″s Jeremy Parish considered him one of the series&#x27; biggest problems; Parish wrote that of the unnecessary &quot;Sonic&quot; characters Sega should retire, Shadow was the most in need of it. Numerous video game journalists have mockingly described the character as &quot;edgy&quot;, internet slang referring to someone who exhibits disconcerting behavior in an effort to impress others. In 2010, DeviantArt user &quot;cmara&quot; released a webcomic depicting Shadow in a romantic relationship with Shrek, the title character of the DreamWorks film series. According to &quot;Kotaku&quot; Nathan Grayson, the comic paired the two because &quot;if Shrek was the big screen embodiment of nu-millennium toilet garbage, Shadow the Hedgehog—with his hilariously unfitting blend of guns and angst in a colorful world of fast animals in clown shoes—was his video game bride. Both tried to act like they were too cool for &#x27;kid stuff.&#x27; Too sophisticated, too edgy. They were made for each other—and approximately one billion people between the ages of 12 and 34.&quot;

Shadow is a divisive &quot;Sonic&quot; character. Some, such as East, who ranked him one of the series&#x27; best characters, praise him for his role in &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;; &quot;Game Informer&quot; Brian Shea called Shadow a &quot;fun equal&quot; to Sonic who delivered the series&#x27; traditional sense of speed, and &quot;Polygon&quot; Allegra Frank said he is a fan-favorite. &quot;For others,&quot; wrote &quot;Kotaku&quot; Mike Fahey, Shadow &quot;signifies the looming death of a beloved series.&quot; Fahey felt Shadow&#x27;s self-titled game was when the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise lost its identity, and dismissed those who argued in favor of his role in &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;. James Stephanie Sterling, writing for &quot;GamesRadar+&quot;, ranked Shadow among the series&#x27; worst characters, arguing he lost his relevance over time and calling him &quot;the ultimate example of a good idea gone rotten.&quot; Brian Shea from &quot;Game Informer&quot; included Shadow in a similar list, observing that his &quot;brooding &#x27;tortured soul&#x27; personality wore on him quickly&quot;. In a more positive write-up, &quot;Fanbyte&quot; Kenneth Shepard argued Shadow&#x27;s characterization was more complex than most characters in the series, but later games leaned harder on a one-dimensional &quot;edgelord&quot; archetype. Despite this, in 2005 Naka said Sonic Team had determined Shadow was the series&#x27; most popular character excluding Sonic himself, a finding reaffirmed in a 2009 Sega poll. In 2011, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; named Shadow among the 50 greatest video game characters of all time.
In the film adaptation &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (2024), Shadow and his voice actor Keanu Reeves&#x27;s portrayal received critical praise. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman said that Reeves&#x27;s &quot;tones of deepest resonance&quot; made Shadow empathetic to the audience, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; named Reeves&#x27;s Shadow the standout of the film, saying the actor was brilliant at conveying the character&#x27;s &quot;hurt and steel&quot;, and &quot;ComicBook.com&quot;″s Marc Deschamps wrote that Reeves perfectly portrayed Shadow, with his brooding and darkness mixed well with the film&#x27;s humor. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Glenn Kenny felt Reeves brought &quot;suitable emo brooding&quot; to Shadow, and &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Matt Donato wrote Reeves added &quot;stoic somberness&quot; to the established cast. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said that Reeves brought the same gravitas to Shadow that he did to John Wick, feeling his delivery of &quot;quiet condescension&quot; made him &quot;all the scarier for the lack of overt menace&quot;. &quot;Polygon&quot; contrasted Eggman actor Jim Carrey&#x27;s &quot;gloriously deranged&quot; performance with the &quot;utter sincerity&quot; of Reeves, who they praised for making Shadow a &quot;weirdly likable little ball of pain&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Matt Donato said that Reeves&#x27;s own identity, which was already reflected in the character by his voice, &quot;profound[ly]&quot; paralleled the tragedy in Shadow&#x27;s story considering Reeves had experienced &quot;unthinkable&quot; hardships in his life; Donato concluded that Reeves &quot;is Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;.

In April 2024, Sega launched the marketing campaign &quot;Fearless: Year of Shadow&quot;, with several projects starring Shadow the Hedgehog, such as &quot;Sonic X Shadow Generations&quot; and the film &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;.

<text>Rex Lloyd Lease (February 11, 1903 – January 3, 1966) was an American actor. He appeared in over 300 films, mainly in Poverty Row Westerns.

==Biography==
Rex Lease arrived in Hollywood in 1924. He found bit and supporting parts at Film Booking Office (FBO), Rayart, and more, and was given the opportunity to play a few leads. His first film was &quot;A Woman Who Sinned&quot; (FBO, 1924). 

Lease&#x27;s earliest Westerns were a pair of Tim McCoy silents at MGM, one of which was &quot;The Law of the Range&quot; (MGM, 1928) which had a young Joan Crawford as the heroine and Lease as the Solitaire Kid. McCoy and Lease became friends, and over the next dozen or so years, he appeared in seven more McCoy Westerns.

He had a featured role in director Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;The Younger Generation&quot; (Columbia, 1929), a tale of a Jewish family that moves to a more up-scale neighborhood.

He successfully made the transition to talkies, and starred in melodramas, action flicks, old dark house mysteries, and comedies, as well as a couple of Western serials and about a dozen low-budget sagebrush yarns and outdoor adventures. His work in the 1930s included six Western films for Superior Talking Pictures Corporation. Some featured cowboy music, and some had him paired with young actor Bobby Nelson.

In between lead roles, Lease featured parts in some B Westerns. He was Hoot Gibson&#x27;s brother in &quot;Cavalcade of the West&quot; (Walter Futter Prod., 1936); Lease played the &quot;Pecos Kid&quot; in McCoy&#x27;s &quot;Lightnin&#x27; Bill Carson&quot; (Puritan, 1936); played Col. William B. Travis in &quot;Heroes of the Alamo&quot; and he worked in a couple of Tom Tyler&#x27;s, &quot;Ridin&#x27; On&quot; (Reliable, 1936) and &quot;Fast Bullets&quot; (Reliable, 1936). Lease had the lead in the 1936 film serial &quot;Custer&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; (1936).

Lease&#x27;s finale as a star had him teaming up with Rin-Tin-Tin Jr. in &quot;The Silver Trail&quot; (Reliable, 1937).

Though no longer afforded star billing, he continued in smaller roles into the 1950s in films (recurring as the sheriff in four &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; movies) and on TV.

==Personal life==
In 1930, Lease pleaded guilty in a Malibu court to a charge of battery on actress and dancer Vivian Duncan. The charge resulted from his beating of Duncan at a home in Malibu Beach on July 7, 1930. He paid a $50 fine, insisting that she initiated the altercation. Duncan&#x27;s brother, Harold, retaliated in August 1930, beating Lease in a hotel cafe in Hollywood.

Lease was married at least five times.

==Death==

On January 3, 1966, Lease was found dead by his son Richard on the kitchen floor at his Van Nuys, California, home. He had died sometime between New Year&#x27;s Eve and January 3. The cause of death was undisclosed. Richard was later shot and killed at age 25 in a road rage traffic altercation with two teenagers.

<text>Ladislas Starevich (, ; August 8, 1882 – February 26, 1965) was a Polish-Russian stop-motion animator notable as the author of the first puppet-animated film &quot;The Beautiful Leukanida&quot; (1912). He also used dead insects and other animals as protagonists of his films. Following the Russian Revolution, Starevich settled in France.

== Early career ==

Władysław Starewicz was born in Moscow to ethnic Polish parents from present-day Lithuania. His father, Aleksander Starewicz, was from Surviliškis near Kėdainiai and his mother, Antonina Legęcka, from Kaunas. Both belonged to lesser nobility and were in hiding after the failed January Uprising against the Tsarist Russian domination. Due to his mother&#x27;s death, he was raised by his grandmother in Kaunas, then the capital of Kaunas Governorate within the Russian Empire. He attended Gymnasium in Dorpat (today Tartu, Estonia), where he worked painting postcards and illustrations for local magazines. Starewicz pursued an artistic career despite the protest of his family, and enrolled in a painting school.

Starewicz had interests in a number of different areas; by 1910 he was named Director of the Museum of Natural History in Kaunas, Lithuania. There he made four short live-action documentaries for the museum. For the fifth film, Starewicz wished to record the battle of two stag beetles, but was stymied by the fact that the nocturnal creatures stopped moving or died due to the heat whenever the stage lighting was turned on. Inspired by a viewing of &quot;Les allumettes animées&quot; [Animated Matches] (1908) by Arthur Melbourne Cooper, Starewicz decided to re-create the fight through stop-motion animation: by replacing the beetles&#x27; legs with wire, attached with sealing wax to their thorax, he is able to create articulated insect puppets. The result was the short film &quot;Lucanus Cervus&quot; (1910), apparently the first animated puppet film and the natal hour of Russian animation.

In 1911, Starewicz moved to Moscow and began work with the film company of Aleksandr Khanzhonkov. There he made two dozen films, most of them puppet animations using dead animals. Of these, &quot;The Beautiful Leukanida&quot; (premiere – 1912), first puppet film with a plot inspired in the story of Agamemnon and Menelaus, earned international acclaim (one British reviewer thought the stars were live trained insects), while &quot;The Grasshopper and the Ant&quot; (1913) got Starewicz decorated by the czar. But the best-known film of this period was &quot;The Cameraman&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1912), a cynical work about infidelity and jealousy among the insects. Some of the films made for Khanzhonkov feature live-action/animation interaction. In some cases, the live action consisted of footage of Starewicz&#x27;s daughter Irina. Particularly worthy of note is Starevich&#x27;s 41-minute 1913 film &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;, an adaptation of the Nikolai Gogol story of the same name. The 1913 film &quot;Terrible Vengeance&quot; won the Gold Medal at an international festival in Milan in 1914, being just one of five films which won awards among 1005 contestants.

During World War I, Starewicz worked for several film companies, directing 60 live-action features, some of which were fairly successful. After the October Revolution of 1917, the film community largely sided with the White Army and moved from Moscow to Yalta on the Black Sea. After a brief stay, Starewicz and his family fled before the Red Army could capture the Crimea, stopping in Italy for a while before joining the Russian émigrés in Paris.

== After World War I ==

At this time, Władysław Starewicz changed his name to Ladislas Starevich, as it was easier to pronounce in French. He first established his family in Joinville-le-Pont, while he worked as a cameraman there. He rapidly returned to make puppet films. He made &quot;Le mariage de Babylas&quot; (&quot;Midnight Wedding&quot;), &quot;L&#x27;épouvantail&quot; (&quot;The Scarecrow&quot;, 1921 ), &quot;Les grenouilles qui demandent un roi&quot; (alternately called &quot;Frogland&quot; and &quot;The Frogs Who Wanted a King&quot;, 1922), &quot;Amour noir et blanc&quot; (&quot;Love in Black and White&quot;, 1923), &quot;La voix du rossignol&quot; (&quot;The Voice of the Nightingale&quot;, 1923) and &quot;La petite chateuse des rues&quot; (&quot;The Little Street Singer&quot;, 1924). His family worked with him to produce these films. These were his daughter Irina (who had changed her name to Irène) who collaborated in all his films and defended his rights, his wife Anna Zimermann, who made the costumes for the puppets and Jeanne Starewitch (aka Nina Star) who acted in some of the films (&quot;The Little Street Singer&quot;, &quot;The Queen of the Butterflies&quot;, &quot;The Voice of the Nightingale&quot;, &quot;The Magical clock&quot;, and others)

In 1924, Starevich moved to Fontenay-sous-Bois, where he lived until his death in 1965. There he made the rest of his films. Among the most notable are &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; (1925), a Chinese tale with complex and wonderful sets and character design, in which Starevich shows his talent as an artist and in set decoration as well as ingenious trick photography, &quot;The Town Rat and the Country Rat&quot; (1927), a parody of American slapstick films, &quot;The Magical Clock&quot; (1928), a fairy tale with amazing middle-age puppets and sets, starring Nina Star with music by Paul Dessau, &quot;The Little Parade&quot;, from H.C. Andersen&#x27;s tale &quot;The Steadfast Tin Soldier&quot;. Six weeks after the premiere of &quot;The Little Parade&quot;, sound was added by Louis Nalpas&#x27; company. Starevich started a collaboration with him, wishing to make a feature full-length film: &quot;Le Roman de Renard&quot;. All his 1920s films are available on DVD.

== &quot;Le Roman de Renard&quot; ==

Often mentioned as being among his best work, &quot;The Tale of the Fox&quot; (, ) was also his first animated feature. It was entirely made by Starevich and his daughter, Irène. Production took place in Fontenay-sous-Bois from 1929 to 1930. When the film was ready, the producer, Louis Nalpas, decided to add sound using disc support but this system failed and the film was not released. The German film studio UFA became interested in showing the film in two parts. Sound was added in German and it premiered in Berlin in 1937. Later, in 1941, Roger Richebé (Paris Cinéma Location) produced a French sound version, which premiered in April 1941. It was the third animated feature film to have sound, after Quirino Cristiani&#x27;s &quot;Peludópolis&quot; (1931) and &quot;The New Gulliver&quot; (1935) from the Soviet Union.

== The &quot;Fétiche&quot; series (Mascot) ==

In 1933 Ladislas and Irene Starevich produced and directed a film of about 1000 meters, initially titled &quot;LS 18&quot;. Under pressure from distributors, the length was greatly reduced. It became the film &quot;Fétiche Mascotte&quot; (&quot;The Mascot&quot;), about 600 meters, distributed in 1934. Starevich had a contract with Marc Gelbart (Gelma Films) to make a series with this character. Twelve episodes were planned, but for economic reasons, only five were made between 1934 and 1937 and distributed worldwide. These are &quot;Fétiche prestidigitateur&quot; (&quot;The Ringmaster&quot;, 1934), &quot;Fétiche se marie&quot; (&quot;The Mascot&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, 1935), &quot;Fétiche en voyage de noces&quot; (&quot;The Navigator&quot;, 1936) and &quot;Fétiche et les sirènes&quot; (&quot;The Mascot and the Mermaids&quot;, 1937) which was not released because sound could not be added. There is an unfinished film, &quot;Fétiche père de famille&quot; (&quot;The Mascot and His Family&quot;, 1938). In 1954, L. Starevich conceived &quot;The Hangover&quot;, using images not included in &quot;The Mascot&quot;. A reconstruction of the original &quot;LS 18&quot; was produced by 2012.

== During World War II ==

During this period (1937–1946), Starevich ceased producing films. He had expressed some intent to make commercial films, but none are known to have been produced during the war.

== After World War II ==

In 1946 he tried to make &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; but abandoned the project due to financial problems. The following year, he made &quot;Zanzabelle a Paris&quot; adapted from a story by Sonika Bo. The script and direction of this film are credited to Irène. In 1949, he met Alexandre Kamenka (Alkam Films), an old Russian friend, who produced Starevich&#x27;s first colour film &quot;Fleur de fougère&quot; (&quot;Fern Flower&quot;). It was based on an Eastern European story, in which a child goes to the forest to collect a fern flower, which grows during the night of Saint-Jean, and makes wishes come true. In 1950, &quot;Fern Flower&quot; won the first prize as an animated film in the 11th International Children Film Festival in Venice Biennale. Then he started a collaboration with Sonika Bo to adapt another of her stories, &quot;Gazouilly petit oiseau&quot;, followed by &quot;Un dimanche de Gazouillis&quot; (Gazouillis&#x27;s Sunday picnic).

Again produced by Alkam films, Starevich made &quot;Nose to Wind&quot;, which tells the adventures of Patapouf, a bear who escapes from school to play with his friends the rabbit and the fox. The same year, 1958, his wife Anna died. Due to the success of the previous film, &quot;Winter Carousel&quot; was made, starring the bear Patapouf and the rabbit going through seasons. This was his last completed film. All his family co-labored on it, as remembers his granddaughter Martin-Starewitch, whose hands can be seen in animation tests from &quot;Like Dog and Cat&quot;, Starevich&#x27;s unfinished film.

Ladislas Starevich died on February 26, 1965, while working on &quot;Comme chien et chat&quot; (&quot;Like Dog and Cat&quot;). He was one of the few European animators to be known by name in the United States before the 1960s, largely on account of &quot;La Voix du rossignol&quot; and &quot;Fétiche Mascotte&quot; (&quot;The Tale of the Fox&quot; was not widely distributed in the US). His Russian films were known for their dark humor. He kept every puppet he made, so stars in one film tended to turn up as supporting characters in later works (the frogs from &quot;The Frogs Who Wanted a King&quot; are the oldest of these). For example, in &quot;Fétiche mascotte&quot; (1933) the viewer can see puppets from &quot;The Scarecrow&quot;, &quot;The Little Parade&quot;, and &quot;The Magical Clock&quot;. The films have shown incredible imagination and also development of techniques including motion blur, replacement animation, multiple frame exposure, and reverse shooting.

== Posterity ==

Since 1991, Leona Beatrice Martin-Starewitch, Ladislas Starevich&#x27;s granddaughter and her husband, François Martin, have restored and distributed her grandfather&#x27;s films.

Filmmaker Terry Gilliam ranked &quot;The Mascot&quot; among the ten best animated movies of all time. 

In 2005, Xavier Kawa-Topor and Jean Rubak joined three Starevich short films together to make a feature film, with music by Jean-Marie Senia. The film, entitled &quot;Tales of the Magical Clock&quot;, contributed to recognition by the press and the public of Starewitch Engineering.

In 2009, Wes Anderson paid homage to &quot;Le Roman de Renard&quot; in &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot;.

In 2012 a full reconstruction of &quot;LS18&quot; to the original length and content of 1933 had been reconstructed, called &quot;Fetish 33-12&quot;. This was done by Léona Béatrice Martin-Starewitch, his granddaughter, and her husband, François Martin, owners of the rights to the films made by Starevich and his family. The reconstruction used multiple original copies of &quot;The Mascot&quot; (distributed in the United Kingdom and the United States of America), a negative of &quot;The Hangover&quot; and material from the archives of Ladislas Starevich.

In 2014, the town of Fontenay-sous-Bois and service Documentation Archive with the family Martin-Starewich organized projections of Ladislas Starewich films in municipal Kosmos cinema with the release of all the preserved films, more than 7 hours on two projection days.

<doc id="332410" wikidata="Q399804" url="?curid=332410" title="Preamplifier">
<text>A preamplifier, also known as a preamp, is an electronic amplifier that converts a weak electrical signal into an output signal strong enough to be noise-tolerant and strong enough for further processing, or for sending to a power amplifier and a loudspeaker. Without this, the final signal would be noisy or distorted. They are typically used to amplify signals from analog sensors such as microphones and pickups. Because of this, the preamplifier is often placed close to the sensor to reduce the effects of noise and interference.

==Description==
An ideal preamp will be linear (have a constant gain through its operating range) and have high input impedance (requiring only a minimal amount of current to sense the input signal) and low output impedance (when current is drawn from the output there is minimal change in the output voltage). It is used to boost the signal strength to drive the cable to the main instrument without significantly degrading the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The noise performance of a preamplifier is critical. According to Friis&#x27;s formula, when the gain of the preamplifier is high, the SNR of the final signal is determined by the SNR of the input signal and the noise figure of the preamplifier.

Three basic types of preamplifiers are available:
* current-sensitive preamplifier
* parasitic-capacitance preamplifier
* charge-sensitive preamplifier.

==Audio systems==
In an audio system, they are typically used to amplify signals from analog sensors to line level. The second amplifier is typically a power amplifier (power amp). The preamplifier provides voltage gain (e.g., from 10 mV to 1 V) but no significant current gain. The power amplifier provides the higher current necessary to drive loudspeakers. For these systems, some common sensors are microphones, instrument pickups, and phonographs. Preamplifiers are often integrated into the audio inputs on mixing consoles, DJ mixers, and sound cards. They can also be stand-alone devices.

==Examples==

* The integrated preamplifier in a foil electret microphone
* The first stage of an instrument amplifier, the output of which is then sent to the power amplifier. With instrument amplifiers, the preamp is often designed to produce overdrive or distortion effects.
* A stand-alone unit for use in live music and recording studio applications
* Part of a stand-alone channel strip or channel strip built into an audio mixing desk
* A masthead amplifier used with television receiver antenna (For a receiver far from the antenna, it amplifies the signal and noise from the antenna, reducing the negative effects of the necessary cable length; for an antenna near a receiver, such an amplifier only adds noise.)
* A component in the electronic part of a satellite receiver dish
* A circuit inside of a hard disk drive or tape player connected to the magnetic heads, or the circuit inside of an optical disc drive (such as CD) which connects to the photodiodes
* A component amplifying the signal from a phonograph cartridge to the &quot;line-level&quot; input of common power amplifiers
* A switched capacitor circuit used to null the effects of mismatch offset in most CMOS comparator-based flash analog-to-digital converters
* Due to their unique coloration, some preamplifiers can be emulated in software to be used in mixing.

<text>Arrested decay is a term coined by the U.S. State of California, to explain how it would preserve its Bodie State Historic Park. A more common application of this concept is the preservation of war ruins as memorials.


== United States ==
At Bodie State Historic Park, the structures will be maintained, but only to the extent that they will not be allowed to fall over or otherwise deteriorate in a major way.

Any building that was standing in 1962, when Bodie became a State Park, may be rebuilt or preserved as the photographs of 1962 showed them. By putting new roofs on the buildings, rebuilding foundations, and resealing glass that is in window frames, the State is able to keep buildings from naturally decaying.

Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, uses a similar system, though it uses the term &quot;preserved ruin.&quot;

== Croatia ==
The authorities in Vukovar, Croatia decided to keep the old water tower in the city as it is found today and as it had become after the war — gnarled by artillery.

== Berlin, Germany ==
Several buildings destroyed in the Second World War have been preserved in their ruined condition as memorials. These include part of the facade of the Anhalter Bahnhof and the belfry of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.

== Sarajevo, Bosnia ==
The authorities in Sarajevo, Bosnia have also preserved the building of the daily newspaper Oslobođenje to this day the way it was shelled during the Bosnian War.

== Hiroshima, Japan ==
In 1996, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial was acknowledged as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Originally completed in 1905, the building was known at the time of the Hiroshima atomic bomb explosion on August 6, 1945, as the &quot;Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall&quot;. Although suffering considerable damage, it was the closest structure to the hypocenter of the explosion to withstand the blast without being leveled to the ground. It has been preserved in the condition it was in after the bombing to serve as a symbol of hope for world peace and nuclear disarmament.

== Oradour-sur-Glane, France ==
Oradour-sur-Glane was a village in the Limousin région of France that was destroyed on 10 June 1944, when 642 of its inhabitants – men, women and children – were murdered by a German Waffen-SS company. Although a new village was built after World War II, away from the ruins of the former village, the old village – the site of the massacre – still stands as a memorial to the dead and as being representative of similar sites and events. Part of the memorial includes items recovered from the burned-out buildings: watches stopped at the time their owners were burned alive; glasses – melted from the intense heat; and various personal items and money.

<text>The Jeolla Line () is a railway line in North and South Jeolla Provinces in South Korea. The line is served by frequent passenger trains from Seoul (via the Gyeongbu and Honam Lines) to Yeosu.

==History==

The first railway along a section of what became the Jeolla Line was the Zenboku Lightrail Line, a narrow gauge line from Riri to Zenshu opened by the privately owned Zenboku Light Railway on 12 November 1917. In 1927, the line was nationalised, and the Chosen Government Railway (&quot;Sentetsu&quot;) soon set to converting the line to standard gauge; this work was begun on 18 April 1929 and completed later that year. Sentetsu then extended the line, completing the Jeonju–Namwon section in October 1931, the Namwon–Gokseong section in October 1933, and finally the Gokseong–Suncheon section on 16 December 1936.

In 1936, Sentetsu nationalised the privately owned Chosen Railway&#x27;s Gwangnyeo Line, which ran from Songjeongni to Yeosu and Yeosu Port via Suncheon, renaming it Songnyeo Line and splitting it apart to merge the Suncheon–Yeosu section with the Jeonbuk Line to create the Jeolla Line in 1936. The line was completed with the reconstruction of the Iri (today Iksan) to Jeonju section in March 1937.

===Upgrade===

The upgrade of the Iksan-Suncheon section started with the construction of a bypass around Jeonju with wider curves, opened in 1981.

From 1989, the first phase of the project to re-lay and double-track the line, mostly in a new alignment with wider curves, longer tunnels and bridges, was launched on three sections between Sin-ri, at the end of the Jeonju realignment, and Suncheon. The two longest new structures were the long Byeongpung Tunnel, north of Suncheon, and the long Seulchi Tunnel, south of Jeonju, which became South Korea&#x27;s longest rail tunnel, surpassing Jeongam Tunnel on the Taebaek Line. The three sections of the first phase with altogether , shortening the original route by , were finished by 1999 and entered service on 18 May 1999. The two gaps between those sections were plugged in a second phase in 2002 and August 2004, the altogether long new sections shortened the line by another .

The third phase of the upgrading project, started in 2002, involved the double-tracking of the remaining long single-track section from Iksan to Sin-ri, until the end of the Jeonju realignment, and electrification of the entire double-tracked and re-aligned section from Iksan to Suncheon, altogether , to allow speeds of . By March 2010, progress on the section from Iksan to Suncheon reached 63.0%. This phase of the project is implemented as a public private partnership of the Build-Transfer-Lease (BTL) method, with a government contribution of 510.852 billion won and a BTL share of 470.699 billion won. The upgrade and re-alignment of the final Suncheon-Yeosu section was launched as a separate project in 2001, with work starting in December 2003. As of March 2010, progress on the long alignment stood at 88.0% out of a total budget of 732.002 billion won. The entire upgrading project is to be completed in 2011.

On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the Jeolla Line is to be further upgraded for .

==Major stations==

Major stations and junctions on the line:

*Iksan (formerly known as Iri), junction with the Honam Line and Janghang Line;
*Dongsan, terminus of the Bukjeonju Line;
*Jeonju, capital of North Jeolla;
*Suncheon, junction with the Gyeongjeon Line;
*Deogyang, terminus of the Yeocheon Line; and
*Yeosu on the south coast.

==Services==

The Jeolla Line is served by intercity ITX-Saemaeul trains and cross-country Mugunghwa-ho trains. As of October 2010, the travel time on the Saemaeul-ho from Yongsan station in Seoul is a minimum 3 hours 28 minutes to Jeonju, 4 hours 33 minutes to Suncheon and 5 hours 15 minutes to Yeosu, with 2 hours 30 minutes taken for the Iksan—Jeosu travel along the Jeolla Line itself . Mugunghwa-ho trains that also start in Yongsan cover the line from Iksan to Yeosu in between a minimum of 2 hours 30 minutes and a maximum of 4 hours, depending on the number of stops.

===Jeolla KTX===

Yeosu hosted the Expo 2012, and Korail timed the introduction of Korea Train Express services on the line ahead of the event. Original plans foresaw the start of Jeolla KTX services in April 2011, reducing the Seoul–Yeosu travel time to 2 hours 55 minutes, using KTX-II (KTX-Sancheon) high-speed trains. In February 2011, when the necessary electrification works were 96% complete, the start of services was postponed to September 2011, and the Yongsan–Yeosu travel time was planned to be 3 hours 7 minutes. After the completion of the first stage of the Honam High Speed Railway, the travel time is planned to reduce to 2 hours 25 minutes.

<doc id="332416" wikidata="Q422252" url="?curid=332416" title="Dexamethasone">
<text>Dexamethasone is a fluorinated glucocorticoid medication used to treat rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), croup, brain swelling, eye pain following eye surgery, superior vena cava syndrome (a complication of some forms of cancer), and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis. In adrenocortical insufficiency, it may be used in combination with a mineralocorticoid medication such as fludrocortisone. In preterm labor, it may be used to improve outcomes in the baby. It may be given by mouth, as an injection into a muscle, as an injection into a vein, as a topical cream or ointment for the skin or as a topical ophthalmic solution to the eye. The effects of dexamethasone are frequently seen within a day and last for about three days.
The long-term use of dexamethasone may result in thrush, bone loss, cataracts, easy bruising, or muscle weakness. It is in pregnancy category C in the United States, meaning that it should only be used when the benefits are predicted to be greater than the risks. In Australia, the oral use is category A, meaning it has been frequently used in pregnancy and not been found to cause problems to the baby. It should not be taken when breastfeeding. Dexamethasone has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects.
Dexamethasone was first synthesized in 1957 by Philip Showalter Hench and was approved for medical use in 1958. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 234th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, the combination of dexamethasone with neomycin and polymyxin B was the 274th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
===Anti-inflammatory===

Dexamethasone is used to treat many inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and bronchospasm. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a decrease in numbers of platelets due to an immune problem, responds to 40 mg daily for four days; it may be administered in 14-day cycles. It is unclear whether dexamethasone in this condition is significantly better than other glucocorticoids.

It is also given in small amounts before and/or after some forms of dental surgery, such as the extraction of the wisdom teeth, an operation that often causes puffy, swollen cheeks.

Dexamethasone is commonly given as a treatment for croup in children. A single dose can reduce the swelling of the airway to improve breathing and reduce discomfort.

Dexamethasone is sometimes injected into the heel when treating plantar fasciitis or heel pain, sometimes in conjunction with triamcinolone acetonide. There is no evidence that this treatment helps in the long term, however, dexamethasone may provide short-term pain relief.

It may be useful to counteract allergic anaphylactic shock, however this is not usually recommended by clinical guidelines.

It is present in certain eye drops – particularly after eye surgery – and as a nasal spray, and certain ear drops (can be combined with an antibiotic and an antifungal). Dexamethasone intravitreal steroid implants have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat ocular conditions such as diabetic macular edema, central retinal vein occlusion, and uveitis. However, the evidence is poor quality relating to the treatment of uveitis, with the potential side effects (cataract progression and raised intraocular pressure) being significant, and the benefits not certainly greater than standard treatment. Dexamethasone has also been used with antibiotics to treat acute endophthalmitis.

Dexamethasone is used in transvenous screw-in cardiac pacing leads to minimize the inflammatory response of the myocardium. The steroid is released into the myocardium as soon as the screw is extended and can play a significant role in minimizing the acute pacing threshold due to the reduction of inflammatory response. The typical quantity present in a lead tip is less than 1.0 mg.

Dexamethasone may be administered before antibiotics in cases of bacterial meningitis. Gram-negative bacteria — to which the causative agent of bacterial meningitis, neisseria meningitidis, belongs — have highly immunogenic lipopolysaccharides as a component of their cell membrane and trigger a strong inflammatory response. Pre-administration of dexamethasone before the administration of antibiotics acts to reduce that response, thus reducing hearing loss and neurological damage.

===Cancer===
People with cancer undergoing chemotherapy are often given dexamethasone to counteract certain side effects of their antitumor treatments. Dexamethasone can increase the antiemetic effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron. The exact mechanism of this interaction is not well-defined, but it has been theorized that this effect may be due to, among many other causes, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, anti-inflammatory effects, immunosuppressive effects, decreased release of endogenous opioids, or a combination of the aforementioned.

In brain tumors (primary or metastatic), dexamethasone is used to counteract the development of edema, which could eventually compress other brain structures. It is also given in cord compression, where a tumor is compressing the spinal cord. Evidence on the safety and efficacy of using dexamethasone to treat malignant brain tumors is not clear.

Dexamethasone is also used as a direct chemotherapeutic agent in certain hematological malignancies, especially in the treatment of multiple myeloma, in which dexamethasone is given alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, including most commonly with thalidomide (Thal-dex), lenalidomide, bortezomib (Velcade, Vel-dex), or a combination of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and vincristine or bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone.

===COVID-19===

Dexamethasone is recommended by the National Health Service in the UK and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US for people with COVID-19 who need either mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen (without ventilation).

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline panel suggests the use of glucocorticoids for people with severe COVID-19, defined as people with SpO2 ≤94% on room air, and those who require supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The IDSA recommends against the use of glucocorticoids for those with COVID-19 without hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with COVID-19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence). The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence).

The Oxford University RECOVERY Trial issued a press release announcing preliminary results that the drug could reduce deaths by about a third in participants on ventilators and by about a fifth in participants on oxygen; it did not benefit people who did not require respiratory support. A meta-analysis of seven clinical trials of critically ill COVID-19 participants, each treated with one of three different corticosteroids found a statistically significant reduction in death. The largest reduction was obtained with dexamethasone (36% compared to placebo).

In September 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents, from twelve years of age and weighing at least , who require supplemental oxygen therapy. Dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein.

In November 2020, the Public Health Agency of Canada&#x27;s Clinical Pharmacology Task Group recommended dexamethasone for hospitalized patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Although dexamethasone, and other glucocorticoids, reduce mortality in COVID-19 they have also been associated with an increased risk of secondary infections, secondary infections being a significant issue in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

The mechanism of action of dexamethasone involves suppression of late-stage interferon type I programs in severe COVID-19 patients.

=== Surgery ===
Dexamethasone is used fairly regularly, often as a single intravenous dose, during surgery to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting, manage pain, potentially reduce the amount of pain medication required, and help reduce post-surgery hospitalisation time. The adverse effects of taking steroids after surgery on wound healing, blood sugar levels, and in diabetics are not completely understood; however, dexamethasone likely does not increase the risk of postoperative infections.

===Endocrine===
Dexamethasone is the treatment for the very rare disorder of glucocorticoid resistance.

In adrenal insufficiency and Addison&#x27;s disease, dexamethasone is prescribed when the patient does not respond well to prednisone or methylprednisolone.

It can be used in congenital adrenal hyperplasia in older adolescents and adults to suppress adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production. It is typically given at night.

===Pregnancy===
Dexamethasone may be given to women at risk of delivering prematurely to promote maturation of the fetus&#x27;s lungs. This administration, given from one day to one week before delivery, has been associated with low birth weight, although not with increased rates of neonatal death.

Dexamethasone has also been used during pregnancy as an off-label prenatal treatment for the symptoms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in female babies. CAH causes a variety of physical abnormalities, notably ambiguous genitalia. Early prenatal CAH treatment has been shown to reduce some CAH symptoms, but it does not treat the underlying congenital disorder. This use is controversial: it is inadequately studied, only around one in ten of the fetuses of women treated are at risk of the condition, and serious adverse events have been documented. Experimental use of dexamethasone in pregnancy for fetal CAH treatment was discontinued in Sweden when one in five cases had adverse events.

A small clinical trial found long-term effects on verbal working memory among the small group of children treated prenatally, but the small number of test subjects means the study cannot be considered definitive.

===High-altitude illnesses===
Dexamethasone is used in the treatment of high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), as well as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). It is commonly carried on mountain-climbing expeditions to help climbers deal with complications of altitude sickness.

===Nausea and vomiting===
Intravenous dexamethasone is effective for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in people who had surgery and whose post-operative pain was treated with long-acting spinal or epidural spinal opioids.

The combination of dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist such as ondansetron is more effective than a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.

===Sore throat===
A single dose of dexamethasone or another steroid speeds the improvement of a sore throat.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
As a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone is an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). It is highly selective for the GR over the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and in relation to this, has minimal mineralocorticoid activity. This is in contrast to endogenous corticosteroids like cortisol, which bind to and activate both the GR and the MR. Dexamethasone is 25 times more potent than hydrocortisone (cortisol) as a glucocorticoid. Its affinity (Ki) for the GR was about 1.2nM in one study.

The activation of the GR by dexamethasone results in dose-dependent suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) and of production of endogenous corticosteroids by the adrenal glands, thereby reducing circulating endogenous concentrations of corticosteroids like cortisol and corticosterone.

Dexamethasone poorly penetrates the blood–brain barrier into the central nervous system due to binding to P-glycoprotein. However, higher doses of dexamethasone override the export capacity of P-glycoprotein and enter the brain to produce central activation of GRs. In conjunction with the suppression of endogenous corticosteroids by dexamethasone, this results in skewed ratios of activation of peripheral versus central GRs as well as skewed ratios of activation of GRs versus MRs when compared to non-synthetic corticosteroids. These differences can have significant clinical relevance.

==Chemistry==
Dexamethasone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisol (hydrocortisone) and is also known as 1-dehydro-9α-fluoro-16α-methylhydrocortisone or as 9α-fluoro-11β,17α,21-trihydroxy-16α-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione. The molecular and crystal structure of dexamethasone has been determined by X-ray crystallography. It is a stereoisomer of betamethasone, the two compounds differing only in the spatial configuration of the methyl group at position 16 (see steroid nomenclature).

===Synthesis===
To synthesize dexamethasone, 16β-methylprednisolone acetate is dehydrated to the 9,11-dehydro derivative. This is then reacted with a source of hypobromite, such as basic &quot;N&quot;-bromosuccinimide, to form the 9α-bromo-11β-hydrin derivative, which is then ring-closed to an epoxide. A ring-opening reaction with hydrogen fluoride in tetrahydrofuran gives dexamethasone.

=== Spectroscopy ===
In chemistry, spectroscopy is used to analyze products of reactions. To understand if dexamethasone is synthesized from a reaction, spectroscopy must be taken and compared to the literature spectrum. There are multiple spectroscopy analyses that can be taken including 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR, Mass spectrometry, and UV/vis spectroscopy.The NMR spectrum shown above can be used to compare to product synthesized through reactions to figure out if Dexamethasone was synthesized. 1H NMR, among other things, shows that there are 29 hydrogens and 13C NMR shows that there are 22 carbons.
Using IR spectroscopy, the peaks show the functional groups found in the molecule. You can see peaks at 3472, 1662, and 1618 representing alcohol, aldehyde, and alkene functional groups. UV-vis spectroscopy is another way to analyze a product to figure out what it is.

Finally, mass spectroscopy showed peaks at: 393.1, 355.2 147.1 m/z. The peak at 393.1 m/z is the peak for dexamethasone as its molecular weight is 392.46 m/z. 

==History==
Dexamethasone was first synthesized by Philip Showalter Hench in 1957. It was introduced for medical use in 1958.

On 16 June 2020, the RECOVERY Trial announced preliminary results stating that dexamethasone improves survival rates of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving oxygen or on a ventilator. Benefits were only observed in patients requiring respiratory support; those who did not require breathing support saw a worse survival rate than the control group, although the difference may have been due to chance.
A preprint containing the full dataset was published on 22 June 2020, and demand for dexamethasone surged after the publication of the preprint. The preliminary report was published in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; on 18 July 2020. The final report was published in February 2021.

The World Health Organization (WHO) states that dexamethasone should be reserved for seriously ill and critical patients receiving COVID-19 treatment in a hospital setting, and the WHO Director-General stated that &quot;WHO emphasizes that dexamethasone should only be used for patients with severe or critical disease, under close clinical supervision. There is no evidence this drug works for patients with mild disease or as a preventative measure, and it could cause harm.&quot; In July 2020, the WHO stated they were in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone or other steroids. In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID-19.

In July 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) started reviewing results from the RECOVERY study arm that involved the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital to provide an opinion on the results and in particular the potential use of dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with COVID-19. In September 2020, the EMA received an application for marketing authorization of dexamethasone for COVID-19.

==Society and culture==

===Price===
Dexamethasone is inexpensive. In the United States a month of medication is typically priced less than . In India, a course of treatment for preterm labor is about . The drug is available in most areas of the world.

===Nonmedical use===
Dexamethasone is given in legal Bangladesh brothels to prostitutes not yet of legal age, causing weight gain aimed at making them appear older and healthier to customers and police.

Dexamethasone and most glucocorticoids are banned by sporting bodies including the World Anti-Doping Agency.

==Veterinary use==
Combined with marbofloxacin CAS number 115550-35-1and clotrimazole, dexamethasone is available under the name Aurizon, CAS number 50-02-2, and used to treat difficult ear infections, especially in dogs. It can also be combined with trichlormethiazide to treat horses with swelling of distal limbs and general bruising.

<text>Crystal Space is an unmaintained framework for developing 3D applications written in C++ by Jorrit Tyberghein and others. The first public release was on August 26, 1997. It is typically used as a game engine but the framework is more general and can be used for any kind of 3D visualization. It is very portable and runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Mac OS X. It is also free and open-source software, licensed under the GNU LGPL-2.0-or-later, and was SourceForge.net&#x27;s Project of the Month for February 2003. In 2019, one of the project&#x27;s main developers described it as &quot;effectively dead and has been for a good number of years&quot;.

== Engine design ==
Crystal Space is programmed in object oriented C++. It is very modularly built with a number of more or less independent plugins. The client programs use the plugins, such as the OpenGL 3D renderer, by registering them via Crystal Space&#x27;s Shared Class Facility (SCF).

==Features==
Crystal Space has modules for 2D and 3D graphics, sound, collision detection and physics through ODE and Bullet.
*Graphics:
**OpenGL rendering
**Supports hardware acceleration from all major card vendors
**Allows use of shaders
**Library of common shaders like normal mapping, parallax mapping and hardware skinning
**Supports software rendering with limited features
*Mesh objects:
**Plugin-based mesh system
**Triangle-based meshes with frame and bone animation support
*Collision detection and dynamics:
**ODE and Bullet dynamics
**Simplified collision detection when full dynamic simulation is not needed

== Reception and usage ==
The engine was, for instance, used for the OpenOutcast and &quot;PlaneShift&quot; projects. It was the Project of the Month on SourceForge in February 2003.

<doc id="332436" wikidata="Q1156957" url="?curid=332436" title="Music of Vietnam">
<text>Traditional Vietnamese music encompasses a large umbrella of Vietnamese music from antiquity to present times, and can also encompass multiple groups, such as those from Vietnam&#x27;s ethnic minority tribes.

==History==
Traditional Vietnamese music has been mainly used for religious activities, in daily life, and in traditional festivals. The music is considerably diverse due to Vietnam&#x27;s ethnic population. Moreover, each of Vietnam&#x27;s ethnic groups owns many unique types of musical instruments. The influence of Asian musical cultures on Vietnamese music can be seen in particular instruments such as the flutes, zithers, harps, and erhu. However, the recovery of an almost complete stringed instrument from a deer antler dated to 2,000 years old and shows clear similarities with traditional Vietnamese musical instruments indicate that these traditional instruments have ancient origins.

===Influences on Vietnam music===
The traditional music of Vietnam has been heavily influenced by Chinese music, mainly in terms of musical instruments and performance styles. The introduction of American music, particularly rock and roll and pop music, has influenced the development of modern Vietnamese music.

The Vietnam War had a profound impact on Vietnamese music, inspiring many protest songs and influencing the development of modern Vietnamese music, the introduction of rock came with use of electric guitars to create more aggressive sound on the songs. The main genres that were common in this period were the rock ,folk and soul. This war influenced the lyrics and themes during that time, songs were mainly about these themes: peace, love and social justice example of a song is Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;. Malone, 

Before the Doi Moi Period, Vietnam music was mainly influenced by folk music and social realism. At this period there was the introduction of new genres like hiphop, pop, rock which were mainly influenced by Western culture. The economic reforms of the Doi Moi period in the 1980s led to a relaxation of state control over the arts, allowing for greater diversity and experimentation in Vietnamese music. This period led to increased popularity and acceptance of Western music styles and genres.

After the fall of Saigon in 1975, there was strict control over cultural expressions, many musicians were forced to move to other countries, those who remained had to adhere to the government rules. The music themes shifted to reflecting the government propaganda and the styles became more uniform and diverse. A popular Vietnamese musician &quot;Trinh Cong Son&quot; after the fall of Saigon his music was banned and he was out under house arrest because his songs were about anti- war and anti- government songs.

The rise of the internet has greatly expanded the availability and diversity of music in Vietnam, allowing for greater cross-cultural influences and the development of new musical styles. This contemporary period made Vietnamese music more diverse and experimental.

Buddhism has had a significant influence on Vietnamese music, particularly in terms of its spiritual and meditative aspects. This occurred during the medieval period. 

==Royal court music==
Royal Vietnamese court music first appeared in the congetiveness of europas after a successful seaborne raid against Champa led by emperor Lý Thái Tông in 1044. Cham women were taken as singers, dancers and entertainers for the court. The chronicles recorded that a special palace for Cham women was built in 1046, then in 1060 the emperor ordered a translation of Cham songs, and incorporated Cham drum known as trống cơm into the royal band. During the 13th century, a new trend of music came from China: songs set to Chinese tunes with Vietnamese lyrics.

&quot;Nhã nhạc&quot; is the most popular form of royal court music, specifically referring to the court music played from the Trần dynasty to the last Nguyễn dynasty of Vietnam, being synthesized and developed by the Nguyễn emperors. Influenced from Ming Chinese music, it slowly emerged in the royal court in the 1430s. Along with &quot;nhã nhạc&quot;, the imperial court of Vietnam in the 19th century also had many royal dances which still exist in present times. The theme of most dances is to wish the emperor or empress longevity and the country prosperity. 

Classical music is also performed in honour of gods and scholars such as to Confucius in temples and shrines. These categories are defined as Nhã Nhạc (&quot;elegant music&quot; or &quot;ritual and ceremonial&quot; music), Đại nhạc (&quot;great music&quot;), and Tiểu nhạc (&quot;small music&quot;) are classified as chamber music, often for entertainment for the ruler. In Vietnamese traditional dance, court dances were encompassed văn vũ (civil servant dance) and võ vũ (military dance).

==Dilettante music==

Dilettante music is a genre of chamber music in the traditional music of southern Vietnam. Its instrumentation resembles that of the ca Huế style. Sometimes, modified versions of European instruments like the guitar, violin, and the steel guitar are also included. &quot;Vọng cổ&quot; ( &quot;Folk sound&quot;) is one of the more popular &quot;tài tử&quot; melodies, and was composed in 1919 by songwriter Mr Sáu Lầu, of Bạc Liêu, in southern Vietnam.

==Folk music==
Vietnamese folk music is extremely diverse and includes &quot;dân ca&quot;, &quot;quan họ&quot;, &quot;hát tuồng&quot;, &quot;hát chầu văn&quot;, &quot;ca trù&quot;, &quot;hò&quot;, &quot;hát xẩm&quot;, &quot;hát xoan&quot;, &quot;bài chòi&quot;, &quot;đờn ca tài tử&quot;, &quot;ca Huế&quot; and &quot;trống quân&quot;, among other forms.

=== Chèo ===

&quot;Chèo&quot; is a form of generally satirical musical theatre, often encompassing dance, traditionally performed by peasants in northern Vietnam. It is usually performed outdoors by semi-amateur touring groups, stereotypically in a village square or the courtyard of a public building, although today it is also increasingly performed indoors and by professional performers.

=== Xẩm ===

&quot;Xẩm&quot; or &quot;Hát xẩm&quot; (Xẩm singing) is a type of Vietnamese folk music which was popular in the Northern region of Vietnam but is considered nowadays an endangered form of traditional music in Vietnam. In the dynastic time, xẩm was performed by blind artists who wandered from town to town and earned their living by singing in common places.

===Quan họ===

&quot;Quan họ&quot; (&quot;alternate singing&quot;) is popular in Hà Bắc (divided into nowadays Bắc Ninh and Bắc Giang provinces) and across Vietnam; numerous variations exist, especially in the Northern provinces. Sung a cappella, &quot;quan họ&quot; is improvised and is used in courtship rituals.

===Chầu văn===
&quot;Chầu văn&quot; or &quot;hát văn&quot; is a spiritual form of music used to invoke spirits during ceremonies. It is highly rhythmic and trance-oriented. Before 1986, the Vietnamese government repressed hát chầu văn and other forms of religious expression. It has since been revived by musicians like Phạm Văn Tỵ.

===Nhạc dân tộc cải biên===
&quot;Nhạc dân tộc cải biên&quot; is a modern form of Vietnamese folk music which arose in the 1950s after the founding of the Hanoi Conservatory of Music in 1956. This development involved writing traditional music using Western musical notation, while Western elements of harmony and instrumentation were added. &quot;Nhạc dân tộc cải biên&quot; is often criticized by purists for its watered-down approach to traditional sounds.

===Ca trù===

&quot;Ca trù&quot; (also &quot;hát cô đầu&quot;) is a popular folk music which is said to have begun with ca nương, a female singer who charmed the enemy with her voice. Most singers remain female, and the genre has been revived since the Communist government loosened its repression in
the 1980s, when it was associated with prostitution.

Ca trù, which has many forms, is thought to have originated in the imperial palace, eventually moving predominantly into performances at communal houses for scholars and other members of the elite (this is the type of ca trù most widely known). It can be referred to as a Korean gisaeng-type of entertainment where women, trained in music and poetry, entertained rich and powerful men.

===Cải lương===

&quot;Cải lương&quot; originated in Southern Vietnam in the early 20th century and blossomed in the 1930s as a theatre of the middle class during the country&#x27;s French colonial period. Cải lương is now promoted as a national theatrical form. Unlike the other folk forms, it continued to prove popular with the masses as late as the 1970s and the 1980s, although it is now in decline.

Cải lương can be compared to a sort of play with the added aspect of Vọng cổ. This term literally means &quot;nostalgia for the past&quot;, it is a special type of singing with the background music often being the đàn tranh zither or the đàn ghi-ta (Vietnamized guitar). In a typical cải lương play, the actresses and actors would use a combination of regular spoken dialogue and vọng cổ to express their thoughts and emotions.

===Tuồng===

&quot;Tuồng&quot; also known as &quot;hát tuồng&quot; or &quot;hát bội&quot; is a form of Vietnamese theatre. Hát tuồng is often referred to as classical Vietnamese opera influenced by Chinese opera.

===Hò===
&quot;Hò&quot; can be thought of as the southern style of Quan họ. It is improvisational and is typically sung as dialogue between a man and woman. Common themes include love, courtship, the countryside, etc. &quot;Hò&quot; is popular in Cần Thơ - Vietnam.

Hoàng Vân signed &quot;Thành Đồng Tổ Quốc&quot;, in 1960, considered as the first Vietnamese symphonie, and Chị Sứ as the first Vietnamese ballet in 1968, as well as the dozen of Choir with symphonic orchestra among his hundred famous patriotic tunes. Nguyễn Văn Quỳ also wrote 9 sonatas for violin and piano, following his French music studies and Vietnamese traditions. Phạm Duy also wrote classical compositions mixed with Vietnamese folk music.

== Red music ==
Red music (Nhạc đỏ) is the common name of the revolutionary music (nhạc cách mạng) genre in Vietnam. This genre of music began soon after the beginning of the 20th century during the French colonial period, advocating for independence, socialism and anti-colonialism. Red Music was later strongly promoted across North Vietnam during the War, to urge Northerners to achieve reunification under the Communist Party of Vietnam and fight against the &quot;American imperialist puppet&quot; in South Vietnam. Other forms of non-traditional, non-Revolutionary music and culture in the North, like Vietnamese popular music and Western music and culture, were banned, being labelled as &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;, &quot;bourgeois&quot;, or &quot;capitalist&quot;.

== Yellow music ==
Yellow music (Nhạc vàng) in Vietnam has two meanings. The first meaning is the lyrical and romantic music from pre-war, post-development in southern Vietnam in the period 1954s-1975s and later overseas as well as in the country after Đổi Mới, influenced by music of South Vietnam 1975s. The second meaning is the common name of popular music that was formed in the late 1950s in South Vietnam, using many different melodies such as bolero, enka, rumba, tango, ballade, mambo, chachacha...

Ballad and bolero music still remains one of the most popular genres of slow-tempo Vietnamese music, especially for karaoke sessions or for easy listening.

== Overseas music ==
Overseas music also called Vietnamese diaspora music, refers to the Vietnamese music brought overseas, especially to the United States and France by the forced migration of Vietnamese artists after the Fall of Saigon in 1975.

Since the Đổi Mới economic reformation began in 1986, an increasing number of foreign tourists have visited Vietnam, constructing a new dimension to the musical life of the country. Many hotels and restaurants have hired musicians who played traditional Vietnamese music to entertain their new customers. Spectacles of musical performances present tourists with some aspects of the musical culture of Vietnam, though musicians also play westernized folk music to cater to foreigners&#x27; tastes because of economic necessity. The cultural industry in Vietnam shows a positive tendency towards prosperity. Some excellent musical festivals have taken place, namely the Lullaby Festival, modernized Theater Festival, Theater Song contest, the Traditional Theater Festival, etc. A considerable amount of film music has been composed to enrich the film industry in Vietnam. Furthermore, the Institute of Musicology has played an important role in the preservation and academic research of Vietnamese music. The institute is well using modern technology to help restore and preserve Vietnamese music and songs on compact discs for the longer and better conservation of sound documents. Stored in the Sound Archives of the Institute of Musicology are 8,850 pieces of instrumental music and nearly 18,000 folk songs performed by more or less 2,000 performers. Thousands of technology products in the form of an audio CD, video CD, and videotapes featuring performances on folk music have been released.

== 1940s–1980s, singer-songwriters ==
The Vietnam War, the consequent Fall of Saigon, and the plight of Vietnamese refugees gave rise to a collection of musical pieces that have become &quot;classical&quot; anthems for Vietnamese people both in Vietnam and abroad. Notable writers include Phạm Duy and Trịnh Công Sơn. Singers include Thái Thanh, Khánh Ly and Lệ Thu.

Many of these composers, in the North, also contributed Vietnamese revolutionary songs, known as nhạc đỏ &quot;Red Music&quot;: Lưu Hữu Phước, Văn Cao, Hoàng Vân, Nguyễn Xuân Khoát...

==Contemporary music==
===V-pop===

The embrace of modern pop music culture has increased, as each new generation of people in Vietnam has become more exposed to and influenced by Westernized music, along with the fashion styles of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. Musical production has improved and expanded over the years as visiting performers and organizers from other countries have helped to stimulate the Vietnamese entertainment industry. Such performances include international stages like the Asia Music Festival in South Korea where popular Vietnamese singers such as Mỹ Linh, Mỹ Tâm, Hồ Ngọc Hà, Lam Trường, Sơn Tùng M-TP and others have performed along with other singers from different Asian countries.

Ngũ Cung and Microwave are the current top Vietnamese metal bands in the 21st century. Some songs that were popular during the Vietnam war include The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Paint it Black&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;All You Need is Love,&quot; and Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Purple Haze&quot;.

<text>The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) is an inter-governmental organisation that aims to enhance cooperation among countries and territories of Oceania, including formation of a trade bloc and regional peacekeeping operations. It was founded in 1971 as the South Pacific Forum (SPF), and changed its name in 1999 to &quot;Pacific Islands Forum&quot;, so as to be more inclusive of the Forum&#x27;s Oceania-spanning membership of both north and south Pacific island countries, including Australia.

The mission of the Pacific Islands Forum is &quot;to work in support of Forum member governments, to enhance the economic and social well-being of the people of the South Pacific by fostering cooperation between governments and between international agencies, and by representing the interests of Forum members in ways agreed by the Forum&quot;. Its decisions are implemented by the &quot;Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat&quot; (PIFS), which grew out of the &quot;South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation&quot; (SPEC). As well as its role in harmonising regional positions on various political and policy issues, the Forum Secretariat has technical programmes in economic development, transport and trade. The Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General is the permanent Chairman of the Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP).

Australia and New Zealand are generally larger and wealthier than the other countries that make up the rest of the Forum, with Australia&#x27;s population being around twice that of the other members combined and its economy being more than five times larger. They are significant aid donors and big markets for exports from the other island countries. Military and police forces as well as civilian personnel of Forum states, chiefly Australia and New Zealand, have recently been part of regional peacekeeping and stabilisation operations in other states, notably in Solomon Islands (2003–) and Nauru (2004–2009), under Forum auspices. Such regional efforts are mandated by the Biketawa Declaration, which was adopted at the 31st Summit of Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, held at Kiribati in October 2000. The 50th meeting of the Forum took place in Tuvalu in August 2019. In February 2021, Palau announced that it would be leaving the Pacific Islands Forum after a dispute regarding Henry Puna&#x27;s election as the Forum&#x27;s secretary-general. The Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and Nauru also decided to leave the Forum after Palau&#x27;s decision. In February 2022, it was announced that the departure process had been paused, pending proposed reforms. However, on 9 July 2022 Kiribati confirmed its withdrawal. On 30 January 2023, Prime Minister of Fiji Sitiveni Rabuka confirmed that Kiribati had reconciled with the Pacific Islands Forum and planned to rejoin soon. Rabuka met Kiribati president Taneti Mamau who informed Rabuka of the decision.

The larger Pacific Community functions mainly to promote international development by providing technical and scientific advice and funding development projects, and does not consider security issues or function as a trade bloc.

== History ==
The Forum grew out of a proposal from Cook Islander Premier Albert Henry for a political forum to work alongside the existing South Pacific Commission. The idea was supported by other newly-independent island nations, and they agreed to meet to discuss a permanent body. The first meeting of the South Pacific Forum was initiated by New Zealand and held in Wellington, New Zealand, from 5–7 August 1971 with attendants of the following seven countries: the President of Nauru, the Prime Ministers of Western Samoa, Tonga and Fiji, the Premier of the Cook Islands, the Australian Minister for External Territories, and the Prime Minister of New Zealand. It was a private and informal discussion of a wide range of issues of common concern, concentrating on matters directly affecting the daily lives of the people of the islands of the South Pacific, devoting particular attention to trade, shipping, tourism, and education. Afterwards this meeting was held annually in member countries and areas in turn. In 1999, the 30th session decided to rename the organisation to the Pacific Islands Forum, to better account for areas outside the south Pacific. Immediately after the forum&#x27;s annual meeting at head of government level, the Post Forum Dialogue (PFD) is conducted at ministerial level with PFD development partners around the world.

=== Suspension of Fiji ===
In August 2008, the Forum threatened to suspend Fiji if the latter did not commit to holding a general election by March 2009. Subsequently, at a special leaders&#x27; meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum held in Papua New Guinea in January 2009, Forum leaders set a deadline of 1 May, by which date Fiji must set a date for elections before the end of the year. Fiji rejected the deadline. Consequently, on 2 May, Fiji was suspended indefinitely from participation in the Forum with immediate effect. Toke Talagi, the Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum and Premier of Niue, described the suspension as &quot;also particularly timely given the recent disturbing deterioration of the political, legal and human rights situation in Fiji since April 10, 2009&quot;. He described Fiji as &quot;a regime which displays such a total disregard for basic human rights, democracy and freedom&quot; which he believed contravened membership of the Pacific Islands Forum. Talagi emphasised, however, that Fiji had not been expelled and that it would be welcomed back into the fold when it returned to the path of &quot;constitutional democracy, through free and fair elections&quot;.

The 2009 suspension of Fiji marked the first time that a member of the Pacific Islands Forum had been suspended in the history of the then 38-year-old organisation.

Following the Fijian general election of 17 September 2014, the Forum lifted the suspension of Fiji on 22 October 2014.

===Micronesian withdrawal===
Following the election of Henry Puna as Secretary-General in February 2021 during a virtual meeting, Palau threatened to leave the Forum, claiming that a &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot; to rotate the position between Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, had been violated. Puna had won a ballot by one vote (9–8) against the Marshall Island&#x27;s Gerald Zackios, who was supported by five nations from Micronesia. On 4 February, Palau formally terminated its participation in the forum, citing that the &quot;process regarding the appointment of the Secretary General has clearly indicated to the Republic of Palau that unity, regionalism and the Pacific Way no longer guide the Forum&quot;, and closed its embassy in Fiji. On 6 February, the Forum&#x27;s chair responded to the allegations, stating that there was a consensus decisions following an agreed process and that &quot;we have upheld our principles and values as characterised through the Pacific way&quot;. On 8 February the Palau National Congress formally passed a joint resolution, supporting the decision made by President Surangel Whipps Jr. to leave the Forum. Whipps has stated Puna has to step down for Palau to rejoin the Forum.

After Palau&#x27;s decision to leave the Forum, several other participant countries have indicated their intention to review their membership. In general, the countries of Micronesia, with smaller populations and economies, have complained of being sidelined by larger countries, including Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. There had only ever been one Micronesian Secretary-General of the PIF. The day after Palau&#x27;s withdrawal, MPs in the Marshall Islands, who had previously supported Zackios, called for the government to review its participation in the Forum, but opposed withdrawal. The Federated States of Micronesia and Nauru have openly questioned whether they will remain members. Nauru President Lionel Aingimea has signalled his intention to pull out, stating that &quot;If this is the way Micronesia is treated, then it is better off withdrawing from the Forum&quot;. Four members of the Micronesian bloc – the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and Nauru – decided to hold a virtual meeting to discuss whether to exit the Forum. Australia has attempted to convince the four Pacific Island nations not to pull out. While it has indicated a desire to continue to work with the Micronesian group if it chose to pull out of the Forum, it emphasised the need for Pacific unity.

On 9 February 2021, the remaining Micronesian states – the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and Nauru – decided to leave the Forum. Micronesian leaders released a statement to &quot;collectively express their great disappointment with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General appointment process&quot;, with each state jointly agreeing to formally initiate the process of withdrawal from the Forum. Their departure reduces the Forum to 12 members, all of them in the South Pacific. It may take up to a year for the countries to formally leave the regional body. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne has stated that &quot;we will continue to work very closely with the members of the Pacific Forum&quot;.

In February 2022, it was announced that the five Micronesian countries would pause the process of their departure. The President of the Federated States of Micronesia, David Panuelo, said that he had been told that Henry Puna would step down as Secretary-General, and that other reforms would occur. The Pacific Islands Forum secretariat did not officially confirm Puna&#x27;s departure, saying only that talks were ongoing. President Whipps of Palau said that the pause gave the Forum one last chance to do the right thing. In April, it was reported that the President of the Marshall Islands, David Kabua, was urging other Micronesian leaders to agree to several proposed reforms but to withdraw their demand for Puna to step down. In June 2022, Forum leaders reached an agreement which would see Puna remain in office, and be replaced by a Micronesian candidate when his term ended. The rotation of the Secretary-General between Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia would be made a permanent feature of the Forum, and two deputy secretary-general positions would be created for the other sub-regions. Kiribati did not agree to the arrangement, and on 9 July 2022 withdrew from the Forum with immediate effect. Kiribati rejoined the Forum on 24 February 2023 following an official apology by Forum chair Sitiveni Rabuka.

== Membership ==
In September 2011, the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands were granted observer status in the Pacific Islands Forum, while in September 2016 the French territories of French Polynesia and New Caledonia were granted full membership. Easter Island (administered by Chile) and Hawaii (an oceanic state of the U.S.) have both considered gaining representation. Kiribati withdrew from the Forum in 2022. The government of Kiribati changed its mind the next year in 2023 and decided to rejoin the forum, making its plans clear by a meeting of President of Kiribati Taneti Mamau with Prime Minister of Fiji Sitiveni Rabuka where Mamau told Rabuka about Kiribati&#x27;s plan. Rabuka confirmed to the media that such a meeting did take place and stated that Kiribati had reconciled with the Pacific Islands Forum and would rejoin the Forum soon. In August 2024, American Samoa and Guam were elevated to associate members.

In late August 2024, the Solomon Islands tabled a motion challenging Taiwan&#x27;s participation in the Forum as a partner country. According to &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper, China had issued a directive to prevent Taiwan from participating in the 2025 Forum meeting, scheduled to be held in Solomon Islands. In early September 2024, China&#x27;s Ambassador to the Pacific Qian Bo successfully lobbied for the Forum to remove references to Taiwan in the final communique of the 2024 leaders&#x27; summit in Tonga that week.

== Statistics ==

1 Associate member

== Secretaries General ==
The Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat is appointed to a three-year term by the leaders of the member states. The Secretary General reports directly to the national leaders and the Forum Officials&#x27; Committee (FOC). The Secretary General also automatically serves as the permanent chairman of the Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP).

== Institutions and legal framework ==
The Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat was established initially as a trade bureau in 1972 and later became the &quot;South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation&quot; (SPEC). The name &quot;South Pacific Forum Secretariat&quot; was approved by member governments in 1988 and changed to &quot;Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat&quot; in 2000.

There are four divisions in the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, and each of these divisions has direct responsibility for a range of programs designed to improve the capacity of the Forum member countries and to co-ordinate action on matters of common interest:

# Development and Economic Policy
# Trade and Investment
# Political, International and Legal Affairs
# Corporate Services

The Forum Economic Ministers Meeting (FEMM) established in 1995, plays a key role in assessing regional economic developments.

== Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement ==
The Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA) aims to establish a free-trade area between 14 of the Pacific Islands Forum countries. As of 2013, it had been signed by 12 states:

It has not been signed by either Palau or the Marshall Islands. All of the signing states have ratified the treaty, with the exception of Micronesia. As of March 2008, six countries had announced that domestic arrangements had been made enabling them to trade under the agreement: Cook Islands, Fiji, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu.

After the trade agreement goes into force, countries commit to removing tariffs on most goods by 2021. As of April 2008, The Forum Island Countries are also negotiating an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union. It is important to note that the PICTA discussed here covers only the trade of goods. At the Forum Island Leaders Meeting held in Rarotonga, Cook Islands on 28 August 2012, nine members signed the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement Trade in Services (PICTA TIS). As of April 2008, there is an ongoing negotiation to design and agree on a protocol to include trade in services and the temporary movement of natural persons (a broader concept than the GATS&#x27;s Mode 4).

The Office of the Chief Trade Adviser was established on 29 March 2010 to provide independent advice and support to the Pacific Forum Island Countries (FICs) in the PACER Plus trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand.

==Blue Pacific – collective security interests of member states==
The Biketawa Declaration (2000) on collective security committed Pacific Islands Forum members to eight values, including good governance, liberty of the individual, democratic processes, indigenous rights and cultural values, traditions and customs, and recognising the importance and urgency of equitable economic, social and cultural development to satisfy the basic needs and aspirations of the peoples of the Forum. 

The Boe Declaration (2018) of Regional Security is a declaration agreed to by all the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum on 5 September 2018, which declaration is a framework for coordinating response to regional crises, and sets out an expanded concept of security. The Boe Declaration extended the Biketawa Declaration (2000) to include issues of human security, environmental security, transnational crime, and cybersecurity.

The expanded concept of security set out in the Boe Declaration has been applied in the Falepili Union between Tuvalu and Australia (2023).

== Recent works ==
An &quot;open skies&quot; policy has been under work by a number of nations. The Pacific Islands Air Services Agreement or PIASA would allow member nations to have more access for their airlines to other member countries. To date there have been ten signatories, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Six countries have ratified the agreement: Cook Islands, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu.

At the 19–20 August 2008 Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Niue, the leaders discussed Pacific Plan priorities including, &quot;fisheries, energy, trade and economic integration, climate change and transport, in addition to information and communication technology, health, education, and good governance.&quot; Leaders also discussed the impacts of climate change and adopted the &quot;Niue Declaration on Climate Change&quot;. Restoration of democratic governance in Fiji was discussed as were consequences should the interim government fail to meet established deadlines. Regional assistance to the Solomon Islands and Nauru was discussed, followed by discussion of radioactive contamination in the Marshall Islands from US government tests. Regional institutional framework issues and WTO Doha round developments were discussed, followed by discussion of country-initiatives and the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility launched 19 August 2008 to provide up to A$200 million over four years to help improve infrastructure in Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. The United Nations announced that it would partner with Samoa to develop an Inter-Agency Climate Change Centre to help Pacific island nations combat the impacts of climate change in the region.
In the 2013 forum, the Marshall Islands, supported by all other Pacific nations, claimed compensation from the United States for the nuclear tests conducted on the islands during the 1940s and 1950s.

In the Nadi Bay declaration of 30 July 2019, the Pacific Islands Forum warned that coral atoll nations could be uninhabitable as early as 2030, expressed their deeply concern about a lack of &quot;comprehension, ambition or commitment&quot; from developed nations and called for an immediate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

On 27 January 2021, the European Union and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat agreed a project worth EUR 5.75 million to enhance the trade capacity of Pacific Island countries. The project titled &quot;Strengthening Pacific Intra-Regional and International Trade (SPIRIT)&quot; is designed to boost and increase intra-regional and international trade by strengthening institutional and technical capacity in the Pacific Island region. It will also facilitate the implementation of other trade agreements, in particular the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) and of the Pacific&#x27;s Aid-for-Trade Strategy 2020–2025.

<text>China Hotel () is a 5-star hotel in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.

==History==
China&#x27;s first 5-star hotel and the first involving foreign capital, the China Hotel was built in 1984 by the Hong Kong-listed conglomerate Hopewell Holdings Ltd (controlled by Sir Gordon Wu) under a novel contractual agreement that came to be known as Build-Operate-Transfer, a means of building and operating joint ventures with local authorities in China. This arrangement allowed a foreign partner to build a facility at its own expense, operated it for an agreed length of time to generate a return on its investment, then hand it over to a local partner at no cost. New World Development, via its subsidiary New World Hotels (Holdings), also owned a minority stake.

China Hotel became the first hotel managed by Marriott in Mainland China in 1998, under a 20-year contract and was renamed China Hotel, A Marriott Hotel. It left Marriott at the end of the contract on October 31, 2018. The hotel is currently owned by Guangzhou Lingnan International Enterprise Group Co. Ltd. In 2008, the hotel was fully renovated and offers 850 guest rooms.

<text>The Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) is a physical and logical interface defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard for 10BASE5 Ethernet and the earlier DIX standard. The physical interface consists of a 15-pin D-subminiature connector that links an Ethernet node&#x27;s physical signaling to the Medium Attachment Unit (MAU), sometimes referred to as a transceiver. An AUI cable can extend up to , though often the MAU and data terminal equipment&#x27;s (DTE) medium access controller (MAC) are directly connected, bypassing the need for a cable. In Ethernet implementations where the DTE and MAU are combined, the AUI is typically omitted.

The IEEE 802.3 specification officially defines the AUI as an interconnect between a DTE and the MAU. However, devices like the DEC Digital Ethernet Local Network Interconnect (DELNI) provided hub-like functionality using AUI-compatible connectors. Additionally, under certain conditions, it was possible to directly connect two AUI devices without the need for transceivers using a crossover cable.

AUI connectors became increasingly rare in the early 1990s as computers and hubs directly integrated the MAU, especially with the rising adoption of the 10BASE-T standard. This shift led to the decline of 10BASE5 (thicknet) and 10BASE2 (thinnet) which made use of the interface. The electrical AUI connection remained internally within equipment for some time.

With the introduction of Fast Ethernet, the AUI interface became obsolete and was replaced by the Media Independent Interface (MII). Subsequent Ethernet standards, such as Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet, introduced the GMII and XGMII interfaces, respectively. A 10 Gigabit Ethernet interface, known as XAUI, was developed to extend the operational distance of XGMII and reduce the number of interface signals.

A smaller variant called the Apple Attachment Unit Interface (AAUI) was introduced on Apple Macintosh computers in 1991, and was phased out by 1998.

== Modes ==
The AUI can operate in both &quot;normal mode&quot; and &quot;monitor mode&quot;. In normal mode, it functions as a direct connection between the DTE and the network medium. Monitor mode, an optional feature, isolates the MAU&#x27;s transmitter from the medium while allowing the DTE to observe network activity. This mode is useful for diagnostic and monitoring purposes without impacting the physical medium.

== Signaling and control ==
The AUI uses Manchester encoding for data transmission, which ensures clock synchronization without requiring a separate timing signal. The data and control circuits operate independently and are self-clocked. Control signals coordinate communication between the DTE and MAU, enabling error signaling, MAU isolation, and medium access requests.

== Connector and signals ==
An AUI connector is a DA-15 (D-subminiature) type, where the DTE side has a female connector and the MAU side has a male connector.

The connector often uses a sliding clip instead of the typical thumbscrews found on D-connectors, allowing the DTE and MAU to be directly attached, even when their size or shape would not accommodate thumbscrews. However, the clip mechanism is sometimes considered awkward or unreliable.

In the case of incompatible fittings, the jackposts or sliding clip can be unscrewed and replaced, or adapter dongles and cables can be used.

Electrically, the AUI&#x27;s differential signals are designed for use with a 78 Ω cable and can transmit data between DTE and MAU at 10 Mbps over the standard&#x27;s specified 50-meter length.

AUI drivers and receivers are required to tolerate wiring faults without permanent impairment of the pair. Signal jitter is controlled to within &quot;1.5 nanoseconds&quot; across the interface.

== Pinout table ==
The DA-15 pinout is specified by the IEEE 802.3 standard and describes four differential pairs:

<text>A media access unit (MAU), also known as a multistation access unit (MAU or MSAU), is a device to attach multiple network stations in a ring topology when the cabling is done in a star topology as a Token Ring network, internally wired to connect the stations into a logical ring (generally passive i.e. non-switched and unmanaged; however managed Token Ring MAUs do exist in the form of CAUs, or Controlled Access Units).

Passive Token Ring was an active IBM networking product in the 1997 time frame, after which it was rapidly displaced by switched networking.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

===Passive networking without power===
The majority of IBM-implemented (actual) passive Token Ring MAUs operated without the requirement of power; instead the passive MAU used a series of relays that adjusted themselves as data is passed through: this is also why Token Ring generally used relays to terminate disconnected or failed ports. The power-less IBM 8228 Multistation Access Unit requires a special &#x27;Setup Aid&#x27; tool to re-align the relays after the unit has been moved which causes them to be in incorrect states: this is accomplished by a 9v battery sending a charge to snap the relays back in a proper state. The advantages of having a MAU operate without power is that they can be placed in areas without outlets, the disadvantage is that they must be primed each time the internal relays experience excessive force. The IBM 8226 MAU, while containing a power jack, primarily uses this for the LEDs: relays are still used inside the unit but do not require priming.

===Bandwidth===
In theory, this networking technology supported large geographic areas (with a total ring circumference of several kilometers). But with the bandwidth shared by all stations, in practice separate networks spanning smaller areas were joined using bridges. This bridged network technology was soon displaced by high-bandwidth switched networks.

==Fault tolerance==
Multistation Access Units contain relays to short out non-operating stations. Multiple MAUs can be connected into a larger ring through their ring in/ring out connectors.

An MAU is also called a &quot;ring in a box&quot;. The loop that used to make up the ring of the token Ring is now integrated into this device. In Token Ring, when a link is broken in the ring, the entire network goes down; however with an MAU, the broken circuit is closed within 1ms; allowing stations on the ring to have their cords unplugged without disabling the entire network.

<text>Rights of Man (1791), a book by Thomas Paine, including 31 articles, posits that popular political revolution is permissible when a government does not safeguard the natural rights of its people. Using these points as a base it defends the French Revolution against Edmund Burke&#x27;s attack in &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790).

It was published in Britain in two parts in March 1791 and February 1792.

==Background==
Paine was a very strong supporter of the French Revolution that began in 1789; he visited France the following year. Many British thinkers supported it, including Richard Price, who initiated the Revolution Controversy with his sermon and pamphlet drawing favourable parallels between the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the French Revolution. Conservative intellectual Edmund Burke responded with a counter-revolutionary attack entitled &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790), which strongly appealed to the landed class and sold 30,000 copies. Paine&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Man&quot; was printed by London publisher Joseph Johnson for publication on 21 February 1791, then withdrawn for fear of prosecution. J. S. Jordan stepped in and published it on 16 March. The 90,000-word book appeared on 13 March, three weeks later than scheduled. It sold as many as one million copies and was &quot;eagerly read by reformers, Protestant dissenters, democrats, London craftsman, and the skilled factory-hands of the new industrial north&quot;. William Godwin helped with the publishing of the book, and declared that &quot;the seeds of revolution it contains are so vigorous in their stamina, that nothing can overpower them.&quot;

==Arguments==
Paine argues that the interests of the monarch and his people are united, and insists that the French Revolution should be understood as one which attacks the despotic principles of the French monarchy, not the king himself, and he takes the Bastille, the main prison in Paris, to symbolise the despotism that had been overthrown.

Human rights originate in Nature; thus, rights cannot be granted via political charter, because that implies that rights are legally revocable, hence, would be privileges:

Government&#x27;s sole purpose is safeguarding the individual and his/her inherent, inalienable rights; each societal institution that does not benefit the nation is illegitimate—especially monarchy and aristocracy. The book&#x27;s acumen derives from the Age of Enlightenment and has been linked to the &quot;Second Treatise of Government&quot;, by John Locke (even though Paine himself claimed to have never read this work).

The fuller development of this position seems to have been worked out one night in France after an evening spent with Thomas Jefferson, and possibly Lafayette, discussing a pamphlet by the Philadelphia conservative James Wilson on the proposed federal constitution.

===Reformation of the English government===
&quot;Rights of Man&quot; concludes in proposing practical reformations of English government such as a written constitution composed by a national assembly, in the American mould; the elimination of aristocratic titles, because democracy is incompatible with primogeniture, which leads to the despotism of the family; a national budget without allotted military and war expenses; lower taxes for the poor, and subsidised education for them; and a progressive income tax weighted against wealthy estates to prevent the re-emergence of a hereditary aristocracy.

==Aristocracy==
Principally, &quot;Rights of Man&quot; opposes the idea of hereditary government—the belief that dictatorial government is necessary, because of man&#x27;s corrupt, essential nature. Although other late-18th-century writers such as James Murray and Major John Cartwright criticized the outsized role played by the aristocracy in the government, Paine was arguably the first to advocate the eradication of titles and hereditary government. In &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790) Edmund Burke says that true social stability arises if the nation&#x27;s poor majority are governed by a minority of wealthy aristocrats, and that lawful inheritance of power (wealth, religious, governing) ensured the propriety of political power being the exclusive domain of the nation&#x27;s élite social class—the nobility.

&quot;Rights of Man&quot; denounces Burke&#x27;s assertion of the nobility&#x27;s inherent &quot;hereditary wisdom&quot;; countering the implication that a nation has not a right to form a Government for governing itself. Paine refutes Burke&#x27;s definition of Government as &quot;a contrivance of human wisdom&quot;. Instead, Paine argues that Government is a contrivance of man, and it follows that hereditary succession and hereditary rights to govern cannot compose a Government—because the wisdom to govern cannot be inherited.

==Heredity==
Edmund Burke&#x27;s counter-revolutionary &quot;Reflections on the French Revolution&quot; delineates the legitimacy of aristocratic government to the 1688 Parliamentary resolution declaring William and Mary of Orange—and their heirs—to be the true rulers of England. Paine puts forward two arguments against this view. Firstly, he argues that &quot;Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself in all cases as the age and generations which preceded it.&quot; Secondly, Paine counters that the institution of monarchy should not be historically traced from 1688, but from 1066, when William of Normandy forcibly imposed his Norman rule upon Englishmen.

Thomas Paine&#x27;s intellectual influence is perceptible in the two great political revolutions of the eighteenth century. He dedicated &quot;Rights of Man&quot; to George Washington and to the Marquis de Lafayette, acknowledging the importance of the American and the French revolutions.

Thus, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (&quot;Déclaration des droits de l&#x27;Homme et du citoyen&quot;) can be encapsulated so: (1) Men are born, and always continue, free and equal in respect of their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility; (2) The end of all political associations is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man; and these rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance of oppression; and (3) The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; neither can any individual, nor any body of men, be entitled to any authority, which is not expressly derived from it.

These capsulations are akin to the self-evident truths concept that the U.S. Declaration of Independence expresses.

==Welfare==
In the closing chapters of &quot;Rights of Man&quot;, Paine addresses the condition of the poor and outlines a detailed social welfare proposal predicated upon the redirection of government expenditures. From the onset, Paine asserts all citizens have an inherent claim to welfare. Unlike such writers as James Burgh who sought to limit assistance to the better behaved segments of the poor, Paine declares welfare is not charity, but an irrevocable right. Paine&#x27;s understanding of welfare seemingly follows his idea of political government. He notes, &quot;Man did not enter into society to become worse than he was before, nor to have fewer rights than he had before, but to have those rights better secured&quot;. In congruence with his previous works, Paine emphasizes the compatibility between individual rights and societal wellbeing. He fervently contends that crippling poverty undermines the rights of an individual, and consequently the legitimacy of government. Not surprisingly then, Paine staunchly opposed and criticizes the English Poor Laws in place at the time, claiming the laws are highly ineffective and primitive in nature. Paine critiques the societal conditions promulgated by the Poor Laws saying, &quot;When in countries that are called civilized, we see age going to the workhouse and youth to the gallows, something must be wrong with the system of government&quot;. He argues for their complete abolition, and in their place the enactment of a welfare program that assists the young, old, and struggling individuals. Paine&#x27;s welfare proposal is pillared by education and tax reform; the latter was to be accomplished through progressive taxes on property. Paine contends the poor population consists mostly of children and the elderly, who are unable to participate in the workforce. In addition to the elderly and children, Paine also concedes that there are still some others rendered poor from the economic burden of tax and children. In accordance with his belief that charity as a natural right, Paine presumes only republican or democratic regimes can effectively carry out successful welfare programs. Though Paine does not directly condone or promote up-rise against the British monarchy, and utilizes rather subdued rhetoric in comparison to his other controversial works, revolutionary currents run beneath the surface of the text.

An implication that arises from Paine&#x27;s social welfare reformation is cost. Paine observes, at the time of his writing, England&#x27;s rough population to be about 7 million people. He also supposes that around one-fifth of the population is poor. The number of poor then, according to Paine&#x27;s estimations, would total around 1,400,000 people, in need of support. Paine contended the remedy for financing such a large welfare endeavor would be to cut military expenditures of the state and redirect the funds towards the people of the state. Paine argued that since the age of revolution rendered a new era of peace, the government no longer need devote so many resources toward monarchical wars. Instead, Paine suggests, the surplus of tax revenue could be reintegrated back into society with the formation of a welfare program. He also estimates that near £4 million, out of £17 million in total tax revenues from customs and excise duties, could be salvaged from the government&#x27;s expenditure and redirected and redistributed to the people of the nation. Paine questions, &quot;Is it, then, better that the lives of one hundred and forty thousand aged persons be rendered comfortable, or that a million a year of public money be expended on any one individual, and him often of the most worthless or insignificant character?&quot; Paine concludes that by his model £3,640,000 will be remitted to the poor. Paine&#x27;s allotments for the poor and elderly were far more generous than contemporary payments from the poor rates.

===Youth and education===
Education is a foundational cornerstone of Paine&#x27;s welfare plan. Paine claims, &quot;A nation under a well-regulated government, should permit none to remain uninstructed&quot;. Paine largely focuses on educating the youth population. He contends that, educating children will ultimately compel the betterment of society holistically. Paine insists a proactive social welfare system that educates the country&#x27;s youth, will act as a preventive measure, and engender greater knowledge amongst the population. He explains that poor children and young people are typically deprived of equal access to education. Poor children coming from poor families are often forced to seek apprenticeships and work, and are thus subsequently robbed of the ability to pursue education. Poverty then, becomes cyclical in nature and undoubtedly increases with time. Lack of education amongst the young population, Paine asserts, will also lead to increased violence and crime. To combat this problem, Paine proposes a remission of taxes to poor families; £4 a year for every child under the age of 14, granting the parents of the children send them to school. For 630,000 children, Paine estimates the cost to be £2,520,000. Paine states, &quot;By adopting this method, not only the poverty of the parents will be relieved, but ignorance will be banished from the rising generation, and the number of poor will hereafter become less, because their abilities, by the aid of education, will be greater&quot;. Paine&#x27;s advocacy for education among the poor was novel not only in 1792, but in 1807 when Davies Giddy criticized Samuel Whitbread&#x27;s bill for the establishment of parish schools. In the same vein, Paine also suggest women should receive maternity benefits immediately after the birth of a child.

===Elderly===
Paramount to Paine&#x27;s welfare plan, is care of the elderly population. Paine divides age into two classes; the first he calls &quot;the approach of age&quot; class and the second &quot;old age&quot; class. Those classified as being in the &quot;approach of age&quot; group are over fifty years of age yet under 60 years of age, while &quot;old age&quot; commences at the age of sixty years old. Paine notes that though individuals in the approach of age class retain their mental faculties, the decline of their physical health limits their ability to work, which consequently affects their earnings. Those of old age, Paine declares, are fully incapable of laborious work and are ultimately driven to work themselves to death in current society. Paine resolves to pay approach of age persons the sum of £6 per annum out of the surplus taxes, and to pay old age persons £10 per annum. Figuring there will be 70,000 persons in the approach of age class and 70,000 persons in the old age class, Paine estimates the expense to be 1,120,000.

===Proposal conditions===
In tandem with redirecting government expenditures, Paine suggests the development of what some may call a &quot;workhouse&quot;, or place of employment for poor people. Paine&#x27;s describes the workhouse as being a building, or buildings, with the capability of holding a minimum of 6,000 people. In these buildings, operating businesses would indiscriminately accept applications, so that every city citizen could find employment. In order for Paine&#x27;s plan to be carried out effectively, he cites some conditions that must be met. He resolves that each person seeking employment from these workhouses must stay in the program for a minimum of three months; however, during their residency all employees shall receive wholesome meals, warm lodgings, receive a proportional stipend for the work they&#x27;ve completed, and may work as long or as little as they deem appropriate. The asylum, Paine declares, would assist any persons in temporary distress and would serve around 24,000 people a year. To finance the development of this project, Paine suggest using the revenue from the state&#x27;s coal tax. Paine states that at the time he is writing, the tax revenue is used to support the Duke of Richmond. Paine ultimately finds this particular deplorable, and calls for the reallocation of coal tax funds back to the people.

Paine concludes his section on welfare by listing the eight central tenets of his welfare proposal, or what he calls the &quot;enumerating particulars&quot;, which are as follows:

# Abolish 2 million poor rates.
# Provision for 252,000 poor families.
# Education for 1,030,000 children.
# Comfortable provision for 140,000 aged persons.
# Donation of 20 shillings each for 50,000 births.
# Donation of 20 shillings each for 20,000 marriages.
# Allowance of £20,000 for the funeral expenses of deceased travelers far from home.
# Employment at all times for the casual poor in cities.

==Analysis and public impact==
According to Mark Philp, &quot;In many respects &quot;Rights of Man&quot; is a disordered mix of narrative, principled argument, and rhetorical appeal—betraying the composite materials Paine used and the speed with which it was composed.&quot;

It was quickly reprinted and widely circulated, with copies being read aloud in inns and coffee houses, so that by May some 50,000 copies were said to be in circulation. Of the 300 or more pamphlets which the revolution controversy spawned, &quot;Rights of Man&quot; was the first to seriously damage Burke&#x27;s case and to restore credit to the French both in Britain and America.

The publication of &quot;Rights of Man&quot; caused a furore in England; Paine was tried &quot;in absentia&quot;, and convicted of seditious libel against the Crown, but was unavailable for hanging, being in France and never returning to England. (Sir Archibald Macdonald, 1st Baronet served as the prosecutor.)

Thomas Paine was not the only advocate of the rights of man or the only author of a work titled &quot;Rights of Man&quot;. The working-class radical, Thomas Spence, is among the first, in England, to use the phrase as a title. His 1775 lecture, usually titled &quot;The Rights of Man&quot;, and his later &quot;The Rights of Infants&quot;, offer a proto-georgist take on political philosophy mirroring Paine&#x27;s work Agrarian Justice. Paine&#x27;s acquaintance Mary Wollstonecraft, whom he met via their common publisher, wrote &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Men&quot; as one of the first responses to Burke&#x27;s attack on Richard Price. Her work was in print in December 1790, and was well reviewed. She extended the arguments in the book for which she is best remembered, the 1792 &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;.

<text>The flows through Kumamoto, Ōita, Fukuoka and Saga prefectures in Japan. With a total length of , it is the longest river on Kyūshū. It flows from Mount Aso and empties into the Ariake Sea. It is also nicknamed &quot;Tsukushi Jirō&quot;. 

The upper reaches of the river are important to forestry, and the middle and lower reaches are important to local agriculture, providing irrigation to some of rice fields on the Tsukushi Plain. The river is also important to industry, with twenty electrical power plants located along its banks, as well as the major city of Kurume in Fukuoka Prefecture. Recognizing the requirement to satisfy divergent needs of various communities along the river, the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism designated the Chikugo River (along with six other river systems in Japan) as a &quot;Water Resources Development River System&quot; with a comprehensive utilization plan to develop the river&#x27;s resources.

The Chikugogawa Onsen Fireworks, held annually on July 28, are the largest fireworks display in Kyūshū. The event has been held since 1650 on the riverbanks at Kurume.

<doc id="332491" wikidata="Q3305735" url="?curid=332491" title="Floor tom">
<text>A floor tom or low tom is a double-headed tom-tom drum which usually stands on the floor on three legs. However, they can also be attached to a cymbal stand with a drum clamp, or supported by a rim mount. It is a cylindrical drum without snare wires, and tend to produce a booming, resonant sound which can vary in pitch.

The floor toms are the lowest tuned drums played with sticks on a regular drum set. Common sizes are
* 16x16, that is, in both depth and diameter. This was the original size and is still most common.
* × 14 for jazz and fusion kits, and very occasionally with a 16x16 as well.
* 18x16; that is, in diameter and 16 in depth, the most common size for a second floor tom, used with a 16x16.
* 16x18, a rarer size sometimes used for a second floor tom, also with a 16 × 16.

Floor toms can be mounted:
* In the traditional manner, with three adjustable legs.
* On three legs but connected to them by means of a rim mount on the lower rim, the original floor tom rim mounting.
* Attached to a drum rack or a (very heavy duty) cymbal stand by means of a rim mount on the top or bottom rim.
* Attached to a drum rack or a cymbal stand by means of a standard hanging tom mount on the drum shell. This method is generally restricted to the smaller, 14x14 floor toms.

The floor tom was popularized by Gene Krupa in the 1950s, using a 16x16. 
The floor tom is also used as a small bass drum by some (mostly jazz) drummers. In that case it is mounted horizontally on a specially designed rack system. More recently, companies such as Pearl have come out with &quot;floor tom to bass drum conversion sets&quot;. These commonly consist of strategically shaped rods that one can put in place of the floor tom legs to stand it up horizontally. Under this method, it is fairly common that a drummer get appropriately sized bass drum hoops to complete the conversion process.

Floor toms are also used in music parades, often being carried and then lifted up and hit to add effect. It can also be used as a substitute for surdo in samba and bossa eir. These drums are also found in a jazz band drum kit.

<doc id="332493" wikidata="Q1373092" url="?curid=332493" title="Wurmsbach Abbey">
<text>Wurmsbach Abbey (Kloster Mariazell-Wurmsbach) is a monastery of Cistercian nuns located in Bollingen, a locality of Rapperswil-Jona, in the Canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland. It is located on the north shore of upper Lake Zürich. The house is a part of the Order of Cistercians of the Common Observance (O.Cist.).

== History ==

Count Rudolf of Rapperswil gave his castle of Wurmsbach together with a considerable area of land in 1259 for the foundation of a religious house and the abbey was established. It was initially a dependency of the Cistercian monks of Abbey of St. Urban in Wettingen. The abbey church was dedicated in 1281. Bollinger Sandstein was used for the construction of the abbey by dedicated quarries.

Elisabeth von Rapperswil died probably on 10 April 1309 in the Rapperswil Castle and may have been buried in the &quot;Wurmsbach&quot; nunnery (&quot;†. Apr. IV. Idus: Elizabeth die Graffin, Stiffterin. Excerpta ex Necromonast. Wurmspacensis&quot;) on &quot;Obersee&quot; lake shore. The graves of her younger brother Vinzenz and her mother were excavated in the nunnery, but Elisabeth&#x27;s grave so far was not discovered.

During the first Battle of Villmergen in 1656 and again during the occupation of the region by the French Revolutionary Army in 1799, the nuns were obliged to flee. On both occasions the abbey was completely pillaged, with the consequence that there are few treasures left.

As of 2011, there are 15 nuns in the community, led by Abbess Monika Thumm, O.Cist.

== Sights ==
The abbey is renowned for its location at the lake side. It overlooks uper Lake Zürich and the church is listed as a building of historical significance.

== Activities ==
The nuns run a secondary boarding school for girls. Gardening takes a great deal of time because the land owned by the abbey is considerable. The gardens are known for the herbal remedies grown.

== Cultural heritage ==
The building is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a &quot;Class B&quot; object of regional importance.

<text>The Limpinwood Nature Reserve is a protected nature reserve that is located on the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The reserve was gazetted in April 1963 with additions made in 1967, over former fauna and crown reserves, and further additions were made in 1988 to make the reserve to its current area of . The reserve is situated north-west of the rural locality of , and north of and defines part of the state border between New South Wales and Queensland.

The reserve is part of the Shield Volcano group of the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007. It is also part of the Scenic Rim Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of several species of threatened birds.

==Description==
Its vegetation is primarily sub-tropical rain forest with some wet sclerophyll forest.

Two watercourses named Hidden and Finches Creeks flow to the east out of the reserve. It was dedicated as a Flora Reserve in 1963. Flora Reserve is the highest protected status for forest areas in the Australian National Parks system. Prior to 1963 the area was classified as a Forest Reserve. The fringes of the reserve were logged for red cedar, hoop pine and white beech. Bullock teams were used to drag out the logs. The reserve is composed of virgin old growth sub-tropical rain forest and hardwood species - flooded gum, tallowwood, ironbark and white mahogany.

The reserve has no formed walking tracks. It has no public access except through Lamington National Park in Queensland. On the New South Wales side of the border it is bounded by private landholdings. It includes an area of escarpment rising to over above sea level that forms part of the state border. It is intended to be a place where the flora and fauna are free from interference from humans, domestic animals and feral pests.

<text>James Kenneth Galbraith (born January 29, 1952) is an American economist. He is a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs and at the Department of Government, University of Texas at Austin. He is also a Senior Scholar with the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College and part of the executive committee of the World Economics Association, created in 2011.

== Background ==
Galbraith is a son of the renowned Canadian-American economist John Kenneth Galbraith and Catherine Galbraith (née Catherine Merriam Atwater), and is the brother of the former diplomat, commentator and 2016 Vermont gubernatorial candidate Peter W. Galbraith. He earned his BA, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, from Harvard in 1974 and PhD from Yale in 1981, both in economics. From 1974 to 1975, Galbraith studied as a Marshall Scholar at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==Career==
From 1981 to 1982, Galbraith served on the staff of the Congress of the United States, eventually as Executive Director of the Joint Economic Committee. In 1985, he was a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.

Galbraith is a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs and at the Department of Government, University of Texas at Austin. Galbraith heads up the University of Texas Inequality Project (UTIP), which has been described by economic historian Lord Skidelsky as &quot;pioneering inequality measurement&quot;. UTIP is also noted for replacing the established Gini coefficient with the Theil index as the measurement of choice for comparing inequality between groups, regions and countries.

In March 2008, Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack on the Washington Consensus on free market policies, especially the monetarist version. He argued strongly that Keynesian economics offered a solution to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 whereas monetarist policies would deepen the recession. Towards the end of 2008 and into 2009, many policymakers around the world increased government spending and/or cut taxes, arguably in line with Galbraith&#x27;s views, as part of the Keynesian resurgence described by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as &quot;a stunning reversal of the orthodoxy of the past several decades&quot;.

In 2010, Galbraith edited an edition of his father&#x27;s works for the Library of America series.

== Writings ==
Galbraith&#x27;s books include ; ; , co-edited with Maureen Berner; and . He is the author of two textbooks – (with Robert L. Heilbroner) and (with William Darity Jr.) He also contributes a column to and writes regularly for , , , and . His op-ed pieces have appeared in , , and other newspapers. Galbraith argues that modern America has fallen prey to a wealthy, government-controlling &quot;predatory class&quot;. He said:

Galbraith is highly critical of the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s foreign policy apropos of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He stated:
Much like his father in writing &quot;A Tenured Professor&quot;, the junior Galbraith is a critic of his own profession. He wrote:

== Humanitarian initiatives ==
Galbraith is the chairman of Economists for Peace and Security, formerly known as Economists Against the Arms Race and later Economists Allied for Arms Reduction (ECAAR), an international association of professional economists concerned with peace and security issues. In 2009, he joined the project for &quot;Soldiers of Peace&quot;, a documentary for global peace and against all wars, which has won various awards in film festivals.

<text>Air Lithuania (, literally: &quot;Air Company &quot;Lithuania&quot;&quot;) was a regional airline based in Kaunas in Lithuania. It operated scheduled and charter flights, provided cargo services and aircraft rental. Its main bases were Kaunas International Airport (KUN) and Palanga International Airport (PLQ).

== History ==
Air Lithuania was established as a state-owned company on 13 September 1991 after the reorganization of Aeroflot division in Kaunas. It started charter flights on 15 February 1992. The first scheduled flight was in February 1993 from Kaunas to Budapest. On 17 July 1995, it was reorganized from a state-owned company into a Joint Stock Company. In August 1997, the shares of Air Lithuania were transferred to the parent company Lithuanian Airlines.

In May 2004, Air Lithuania was bought by Arijus, a Lithuanian transport and logistics company, and subsequently sold to World Aviation Capital, a British company. At the time of the sale, the company had debts of approximately 20 million litas, while its annual gross income reached 40 million in 2004. The airline filed for bankruptcy in November 2005. It was the first airline bankruptcy in Lithuania.

In 2004 the airline carried 54,500 passengers (24% increase over 2003). At first, the airline used Tupolev Tu-134 and Yakovlev Yak-40 planes, later leased ATR 42. 

== Accidents and incidents ==
In December 2004, the Air Lithuania ATR 42 operating for Lithuanian Airlines, touched tree tops and allegedly almost crashed at the approach to the Boryspil International Airport in Kyiv, Ukraine .

== Services ==

Air Lithuania operated the following services (as of October 2004):
* Domestic scheduled destinations: Kaunas and Palanga
* International scheduled destinations: Billund, Hamburg, Malmö and Oslo

<doc id="332511" wikidata="Q312478" url="?curid=332511" title="Neuengamme concentration camp">
<text>Neuengamme was a network of Nazi concentration camps in northern Germany that consisted of the main camp, Neuengamme, and more than 85 satellite camps. Established in 1938 near the village of Neuengamme in the Bergedorf district of Hamburg, the Neuengamme camp became the largest concentration camp in Northwest Germany. Over 100,000 prisoners came through Neuengamme and its subcamps, 24 of which were for women. The verified death toll is 42,900: 14,000 in the main camp, 12,800 in the subcamps, and 16,100 in the death marches and bombings during the final weeks of World War II. Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in 1945, the British Army used the site as an internment camp for SS and other Nazi officials. In 1948, the British transferred the land to the Free Hanseatic City of Hamburg, which summarily demolished the camp&#x27;s wooden barracks and built in its stead a prison cell block, converting the former concentration camp site into two state prisons operated by the Hamburg authorities from 1950 to 2004. Following protests by various groups of survivors and allies, the site now serves as a memorial. It is situated 15 km southeast of the centre of Hamburg.

== History ==

=== Background ===
In 1937, Hitler declared five cities to be converted into Führer cities (German: &quot;Führerstädte&quot;) in the new Nazi regime, one of which was Hamburg. The banks of the Elbe river of Hamburg, considered Germany&#x27;s &quot;Gateway to the World&quot; for its large port, were to be redone in the clinker brick style characteristic of German Brick Expressionism.

To supply the bricks, the SS-owned company &quot;Deutsche Erd-und Steinwerke&quot; (DESt) (English: German Earth &amp; Stone Works) purchased a defunct brick factory (&quot;German: Klinkerwerk&quot;) and 500,000 m2 of land in Neuengamme in September 1938.

=== Neuengamme camp ===


The SS established the Neuengamme concentration camp on 13 December 1938 as a subcamp (&quot;German: Außenlager)&quot; of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp and transported 100 prisoners from Sachsenhausen to begin constructing a camp and operate the brickworks.

In January 1940, Heinrich Himmler visited the site and deemed Neuengamme brick production below standard. In April 1940, the SS and the city of Hamburg signed a contract for the construction of a larger, more modern brick factory, an expanded connecting waterway, and a direct supply of bricks and prisoners for construction work in the city. On 4 June, the Neuengamme concentration camp became an independent camp (&quot;German: Stammlager)&quot;, and transports began to arrive from all over Germany and soon the rest of Europe.

As the death rate climbed between 1940 and 1942, a crematorium was constructed in the camp. In the same year, the civilian corporations Messap and Jastram opened armament plants on the camp site and used concentration camp prisoners as their workforces. After the war turned in Stalingrad, Nazis imprisoned millions of Soviets in the concentration camp system and Soviet POWs became the largest prisoner group in the Neuengamme camp and received brutal treatment by SS guards.

The first satellite camp of Drütte was established in Salzgitter, and in less than a year close to 80 subcamps were constructed.

By the end of 1942, the death rate had risen to 10% per month. In 1943, the satellite camp on the Channel Island of Alderney was established. In July 1944, a special section of the camp was set up for prominent French prisoners, comprising political opponents and resistors against the German occupation of France. These prisoners included John William, who had participated in the sabotaging and bombing of a military factory in Montluçon. William discovered his singing voice while cheering his fellow prisoners at Neuengamme and went on to a prominent career as a singer of popular and gospel music.

By the end of 1944, the total number of prisoners grew to approximately 49,000, with 12,000 in Neuengamme and 37,000 in the subcamps, including nearly 10,000 women in the various subcamps for women.

=== Evacuations, death marches, and the bombings of Cap Arcona ===
On 15 March 1945, the transfer of Scandinavian prisoners from other German camps to Neuengamme began, as part of the White Buses program. Neuengamme&#x27;s subcamps were emptied later that month on death marches to the reception camps of Bergen-Belsen and Osnabrück, and, on 8 April, an air raid on a prisoner train transport led to the Celle massacre. Orders were issued for the evacuation of the main camp on 19 April. Between 20 and 26 April, over 9000 prisoners were taken from Neuengamme and loaded on four ships: the passenger liners &quot;Deutschland&quot; and &quot;Cap&quot; &quot;Arcona&quot;, and two large steamers, &quot;SS&quot; &quot;Thielbek&quot; and &quot;Athen&quot;.
The prisoners were in the ships&#x27; hold for several days with no food or water. Concluding that the ships contained Norway-bound fleeing Nazi officials rather than thousands of prisoners, the Royal Air Force (RAF) Hawker Typhoons bombed the &quot;Thielbek&quot;, &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; and &quot;Deutschland&quot; on May 3. Intelligence that the ships carried concentration camp prisoners did not reach the squadrons in time to halt the attack. Survivors who jumped into the water were strafed by cannon fire from the RAF aircraft or shot by Nazi officials. Thousands of dead washed ashore just as the British Army successfully occupied the area on land. The British forced German POWs and civilians to dig mass graves for the dead. Approximately 7,100 prisoners and officials died in the raid; only 450 prisoners survived. 600–700 concentration camp prisoners remained in the main camp under SS orders to destroy all incriminating documentation, dismantle many areas of the camp, and tidy the site. On 2 May 1945, the SS and the last of the prisoners left the Neuengamme concentration camp. The first British soldiers arrived the next day and, seeing a barren and clean site, reported the concentration camp as &quot;empty&quot;.

=== After the war ===
In the first post-war months, the camp was used as a Soviet displaced persons camp, with German POWs held separately. In June, British forces began to use the site as an internment camp for witnesses, SS members and Nazi officials, called Civil Internment Camp No. 6.

The Civil Internment Camp No. 6 was closed on 13 August 1948, and the grounds were transferred to the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, which then built and opened a prison on the site of the former prisoners’ bunkers in 1950. Several original buildings from the former camp were used for various purposes by the prisons until their closing in February 2006.

=== Displaced Persons Camp Neuengamme ===
In May 1945 the British military government began to construct DP Camps in Hamburg. Responsible for this was the unit &quot;Displaced Persons Assembly Centre Staffs&quot; (DPACS) which was supported by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). Displaced Persons received a special status under the British military government. It included people, who were in foreign countries because of the war and needed help returning home. This includes former slave laborers and concentration camp inmates. On the site of former Concentration Camp Neuengamme about ten thousand Soviet slave laborers were housed. A different part of the site was used for German prisoners of war. Under the special requirement from the Soviet Union made in 1944 to take back all citizens, repatriation began on 9 May, only four days after the DP Camp was established. In general, the situation in the accommodations of DP&#x27;s in Neuengamme is not well known. We only know from a war diary of the 53rd British Infantry Division about bad hygienic circumstances, which stemmed from the camp&#x27;s time as a concentration camp. Men and women were separated, women were placed in former SS-guards accommodations. Survivors said even though food and clothing were hard to get, they felt treated well and enjoyed being free.

To get along with the difficulties of supply in the DP Camps, caused by the enormous number of survivors, on 27 May 1945 the British military government called on the citizens of Hamburg to donate clothes for men and women. Reactions were mixed, there were also acts of revenge. Because of these, some DPs were killed, the British military government imposed a curfew for several days.

In May 1945, the DP Assembly Centre &quot;Zoo&quot; was established in the Hamburg park &quot;Planten un Blomen&quot;, for repatriations into the Soviet Union. In fact in 1950 six DP Camps still existed in Hamburg (Zoo, Funkturm, Radrennbahn, Alsterdorf, Fischbeck und Falkenberg) with 4.000 people. Because of the new administration under Hamburg&#x27;s social authority the DPs were now labeled as &quot;homeless foreigners&quot;.

=== War crimes trial ===
On 18 March 1946, the trial of fourteen officials of the main Neuengamme concentration camp began before a British military tribunal, at the Curiohaus building in Hamburg, Germany, the first of 33 trials that would be held over a period of the next two years brought by the British against staff of the camp and its satellites. Former prisoners from six countries testified during the trial regarding the executions committed in the camp, including those of Soviet POWs murdered with poisonous gas, &quot;medical&quot; experiments conducted on inmates, and the brutal treatment and appalling conditions of the prisoners in general.

The defendants were found guilty of war crimes on 3 May 1946; eleven were sentenced to death and the other three to prison terms ranging from 10 to 20 years. On 8 October 1946, the eleven men found guilty in the Neuengamme Trials were executed by hanging by the British executioner Albert Pierrepoint. These men were former commandant Max Pauly, SS Dr. Bruno Kitt, Anton Thumann, Johann Reese, Willy Warnke, SS Dr. Alfred Trzebinski, Heinrich Ruge, Wilhem Bahr, Andreas Brems, Wilhelm Dreimann, and Adolf Speck.

== Cap Arcona ==

The order to transfer the prisoners from the camps to the prison ships came from the Hamburg Gauleiter Karl Kaufmann who was himself acting on orders from Berlin. Although Kaufmann later claimed during the war crimes tribunal that the prisoners were destined for Sweden, the Higher SS and Police Leader of Hamburg, Georg-Henning Graf von Bassewitz-Behr, said at the same trial that the prisoners were, in fact, slated to be killed in compliance with Himmler&#x27;s orders. It has been suggested that the plan itself called for scuttling the ships with the prisoners still aboard.

== Camp operation ==
Hunger reigned supreme. The food given to prisoners was so terribly insufficient that most died within three months of arrival. The meager portions available were of poor quality and were often inedible. The most lethal disease in the camp was dysentery. Many prisoners attempted to acquire food illegally, and others managed to survive through food packages from relatives and the Red Cross. Only certain groups of prisoners, however, were even allowed to receive any mail from family or international organizations.

Life in the camp was a constant struggle for survival, down to the smallest of details. One of the few possessions the prisoners were allowed to have, their bowls, were rusty and could only be washed in cold water.

At the start of the building of the camp, prisoners slept on the floor of their crowded wooden barracks. In 1941, three-tier bunk beds were installed. From 1944, bunks were shared by two or three prisoners. The smell and overcrowding meant sleep was impossible after the 10–12 hour workday, and the bathrooms were always overcrowded in the mornings.

Prisoners clung to friendships and relationships in small groups. Intellectual activities as well as the rare opportunities for cultural activities like drawing, woodcarving, talking about literature, and reciting poetry or songs helped them maintain their will to survive.

=== Extermination through labour ===
The Neuengamme concentration camp was run under the SS practice of &quot;extermination through labour&quot; (German: Vernichtung durch Arbeit). Prisoners worked for 10–12 hours per day and were killed both due to the inhumane conditions in the camp as well as active violence from the guards. 42,900 prisoners died from difficult slave labour combined with insufficient nutrition, extremely unhygienic conditions contributing to widespread disease, and arbitrary brutal punishments from the guards. Although hospitals existed in the camp, medicine was scarce and entrance into the hospital was almost always a death sentence. In 1942, a typhus epidemic entreated the SS to allow former doctors imprisoned in the camp to work at the camp hospitals; prior to this reversal, the hospital staff comprised almost no former medical professionals. The hospitals were also used as a place to murder large groups of weakened Soviet prisoners via lethal injection.

Work at the main camp centered around brick production for the first half of the war. This included the construction of a canal on the small offshoot of the Elbe river located at the campsite in order to transport raw materials from Hamburg. Inmates were forced to excavate the heavy, peaty soil with inadequate tools, regardless of weather conditions or the state of their health. Once the prisoners finished building the new brick factory in 1942, one of the most populated assignment was working in the clay pit, extracting and transporting clay from the main camp for brick production. Constructing the canal, digging the clay, and transporting the soil were known as the three &quot;death commandos&quot;. Skilled labour was almost always given to prisoners on upper rungs of the Aryan hierarchy.

From 1942 until the end of the war, armaments production became the central focus of Neuengamme, with private business ventures profiting financially from the free labour of the prisoners. Several armaments companies, including Messap, Jastram, Walter-Werke and the SS-owned Deutsche Ausrüstungswerke (DAW), established facilities inside the Neuengamme concentration camp following negotiations with the Nazi regime. Walther used their factory to manufacture Gewehr 43 semi-automatic rifles. While conditions for prisoners working in these privately owned factories were better than those working in other kommandos, all prisoners worked under the constant threat of being transferred to the death kommandos. According to the testimony of Wilhelm Bahr, an ex-medical orderly, during the trial against Bruno Tesch, 200 Russian prisoners of war were gassed by prussic acid in 1942. In April 1942, a crematorium was constructed at the camp. Prior to that all bodies were taken to Hamburg for cremation.

=== Known death rates and population numbers ===

Because prisoners were forced to clear the site at the end of the war, only 10% of original documentation survives from the period. Despite this destruction, enough evidence has survived to allow scholars to conclusively prove exact numbers for some months of the entire 1938–1945 period. It is known exactly that by the end of 1940, 2,900 were imprisoned at Neuengamme and the known death toll was over 432. In 1941, the prisoners completed the barracks, and transports arrived from Auschwitz carrying 1002 prisoners as well as various other transports carrying 1000 Soviet POWs. The total number of prisoners grew to 4500. 495 known deaths occurred in 1941 alone.

Until the end of 1940, the majority of prisoners were of German nationality and contained a mix of Asocials, political opponents to the Nazi regime, and various other German national groups. After Neuengamme became an independent concentration camp, the prisoner population grew more diverse, and in the following years the Soviet group followed by the Polish prisoners made up the largest percentage of camp prisoners by nationality. Inmates were from 28 nationalities: Soviets (34,350), Polish (16,900), French (11,500), German (9,200), Dutch (6,950), Belgian (4,800), and Danish (4,800). The prisoner groups included those from the local Jewish community, communists, prostitutes, Gypsies, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, prisoners of war and many other persecuted groups. Of 106,000 inmates, almost half died. 23,394 victims of Neuengamme and the subcamps can be found listed by name in the Neuengamme Memorial Site&#x27;s House of Remembrance. In reality, however, it is estimated that there were 26,800 victims of daily camp horrors and about 17,000 victims of the death marches and reception camps. At least 42,900 victims can be verified, even if not by name.

According to the testimony of Wilhelm Bahr, an ex-medical orderly, during the trial against Bruno Tesch, 197 Soviet prisoners of war were gassed by prussic acid (Zyklon B) in the arrest bunker of the camp on 25 September 1942. Four weeks later, 251 additional Soviet POWs were gassed in the bunker. There were also 20 Jewish children specifically brought to Neuengamme from Auschwitz in order to be experimented on by Dr. Kurt Heissmeyer from Berlin.

== Camp personnel and commandants ==
No SS women were stationed at Neuengamme permanently. Female guards were trained at Neuengamme and assigned to its female subcamps. Many of these SS women are known by name, including Käthe Becker, Erna Dickmann, Johanna Freund, Angelika Grass, Kommandoführerin Loni Gutzeit (who was nicknamed &quot;The Dragon of Wandsbek&quot; by the prisoners while serving at Hamburg-Wandsbek), Gertrud Heise, Frieda Ignatowitz, Gertrud Möller, who also served at the Boizenburg subcamp, Lotte Johanna Radtke, Chief Wardress Annemie von der Huelst, and Inge Marga Marggot Weber. Many of the women were later dispersed to female subcamps throughout northern Germany. Today it is known that female guards staffed the subcamps of Neuengamme at Boizenburg, Braunschweig SS-Reitschule, Hamburg-Sasel, Hamburg-Wandsbek, Helmstedt-Beendorf, Langenhorn, Neugraben, Obernheide, Salzwedel, and Unterluss (Vuterluss). Only a few were tried for war crimes, and these include Anneliese Kohlmann, who served as one of six women-guards at Neugraben, and Gertrud Heise, Oberaufseherin at Obernheide.

The administration of Neuengamme was headed by SS-Sturmführer Alfons Bentele (September 1942 – March 1943). Alfred Trzebinski (1902–1946) was the SS-physician for the Neuengamme subcamps. Most SS officers had direct contact with the prisoners, and their harassment and mistreatment were daily markers of camp routine. In Neuengamme, there were three or four guard forces that would form a Sturmbann to guard the camp and the work details outside the camp. The prisoners’ barracks were surrounded by a barbed wire fence electrically charged at night.

The SS commandant (German: Lagerführer) was in charge of the entire Neuengamme concentration camp network. There were only three commandants of Neuengamme, and over the years they were in charge of 4,500 SS men, with as many as 500 SS officers working at any given time.

As a subcamp of Sachsenhausen, the following men were commandants of Neuengamme:

• SS Sturmbannführer Walter Eisfeld

• SS Hauptsturmführer Martin Gottfried Weiß, April 1940 – June 1940

Erich Frommhagen (SS member from May 1933, ID No. 73754) became adjutant to the commandant of the Neuengamme camp in early 1940. He was killed in action on 17 March 1945.

As an independent concentration camp, the following were commandants of Neuengamme:

• SS Hauptsturmführer Martin Gottfried Weiß, June 1940 – September 1942. His adjutant was Karl-Friedrich Höcker.

• SS Obersturmbannführer Max Pauly, September 1942 – until liberation. His adjutant from May 1943 was Karl Totzauer.

== Subcamps ==
See also: List of subcamps of Neuengamme
More than 80 subcamps were part of the Neuengamme concentration camp system. The first Neuengamme satellite opened in 1942, when inmates of Neuengamme were transported to the Arbeitsdorf subcamp. The number of prisoners within the subcamps drastically differed from camp to camp with as many as 3,000 inmates to as few as 10 or less.

Almost all women imprisoned at Neuengamme were interned in subcamps. In late 1943, most likely November, Neuengamme recorded its first female prisoners according to camp records. In the summer of 1944, Neuengamme received numerous transports of female prisoners from Auschwitz, as well other camps in the East. All of the women were eventually shipped out to one of its twenty-four female subcamps.

Several of the former satellite camps have been converted into memorials or at least feature commemorative plaques on-site. In 2000, however, 28 locations still displayed nothing to indicate the past presence of a camp. Dr. Garbe, from the Neuengamme Concentration Camp Memorial, wrote, &quot;The importance of the satellite camps is further highlighted by the fact that toward the ends of the war three times more prisoners were in satellite camps than in the main camp.&quot;

=== Neuengamme subcamps on Alderney Island ===
The Channel Islands were the only part of the British Commonwealth occupied by Nazi Germany. The Germans built four camps on the island of Alderney, two of which later became Neuengamme subcamps. The Alderney camps were named after the Frisian Islands: &quot;Lager Norderney&quot;, &quot;Lager Borkum&quot;, &quot;Lager Sylt&quot; and &quot;Lager Helgoland&quot;. The Nazi Organisation Todt (OT) operated each subcamp and used forced labourers to build bunkers, gun emplacements, air-raid shelters, and concrete fortifications. The Alderney camps had a total inmate population of about 6,000.

The prisoners in &quot;Lager Norderney&quot; and &quot;Lager Sylt&quot; were slave labourers forced to build the many military fortifications and installations throughout Alderney. &quot;Norderney&quot; housed slave labourers mostly from eastern Europe and a smattering from Russia and Spain. &quot;Sylt&quot; held Jewish forced labourers. &quot;Lager Borkum&quot; was used for German technicians and volunteers from different countries of Europe. &quot;Lager Helgoland&quot; was filled with Russian OT workers.

In March 1943, &quot;Lager Norderney&quot; with its Russian and Polish POWs and &quot;Lager Sylt&quot; and its Jews, were placed under the control of the SS &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; (an SS rank equivalent to captain) Max List. Over 700 of the OT workers lost their lives on the island or while travelling to or from it in the one year under List&#x27;s leadership. The camps were then closed and the remaining inmates transferred to Germany in 1944.

=== Background ===
As the former concentration camp site was used directly after the war as an internment camp and then as a prison, the history of the atrocities that occurred in Neuengamme and its subcamps was largely forgotten in Hamburg and the rest of Germany. The establishment of the memorial was thus a gradual process that faced strong opposition from citizens and the Hamburg City Council. Documentation Center reopend camp after 20 year sebaticle, in 2024 by Chief Sargeant of Federal Ministry at Channel Islands (Background) Location was merged with Geospatial Data in 2024.

The first memorial is a simple monument erected on the leftmost (northernmost) edge of the grounds on the site of the former SS plant nursery that had used ashes from the crematorium as fertilizer, far from the contemporaneous prison and the former prisoners compound of the concentration camp. Following intense pressure from the Amicale Internationale de Neuengamme, the main organization representing all former camp prisoners, the memorial was then expanded in 1965. In 1981, an exhibition building (German: Dokumentenhaus) was added, and the first exhibition on the history of the Neuengamme camp was inaugurated. All memorialization is still cut off from the main portion of the former concentration camp that included the barracks, brickworks, and death commandos. In 1984, protests successfully halted the demolition of the former brickworks and several important historical buildings from the former camp were designated as heritage sites. In 1995, the former armaments factory of the Walther company was altered into a permanent exhibition and the Dokumentenhaus remodeled into the House of Remembrance. A new museum was opened in 2005. While decades of pressure from survivors and activists managed to convince the Hamburg Senate to relocate the two prisons standing on the former concentration camp site in 1989, it was in 2003 and 2006 they were officially moved off-site. The entirety of the grounds was thus only incorporated into the memorial site in 2007.

=== Location ===
The Neuengamme Concentration Camp Memorial (German: KZ-Gedenkstätte Neuengamme), opened in 2008, is located in Hamburg-Bergedorf at Jean-Dolidier-Weg 75, named for a French activist integral to the creation of the memorial, and renamed from Camp (German: Lager) road. At 57 hectares, the Neuengamme Memorial site is one of the largest memorials in Germany.

The memorial is located southeast of the center of Hamburg-Bergedorf in Hamburg-Neuengamme, halfway in the direction of Zollenspieker. Leading to it is the highway A 25, exit Hamburg Curslack or the Bundesstraße (German for &quot;federal highway&quot;) 5 via the street Curslacker Heerweg. A map of situation and structure is available.

=== International mourning place ===
The Dokumentenhaus (House of Remembrance) is in the northern part of the ground. There are files of death, models of the camp and the administration. The Internationales Mahnmal (International mourning place) is an entity of a column (symbol of the crematory). A footpath leads to it, At the right side are plates with the names of all countries wherefrom the camp inmates came from. A sculpture of a dying prisoner by Françoise Salmon gives an impression and reminder of the pain.

=== Memorial sculpture garden ===


North of the International mourning place (in German: Internationales Mahnmal), a circular path leads through the memorial sculpture garden on the gardening area of former concentration camp. Memorial stones, sculptures and monuments are there erected. On plaques information is given in the languages German, French and English. They witness and are sign of the mourning for persecuted groups, persons deported, inmates and those murdered by action of retaliation.
The columns of basalt remember July 1944, when the Maquisards from Murat were deported and afterwards murdered in the Neuengamme concentration camp and its affiliates. In total 75 men of 103 died in the concentration camp.

== Cemeteries and memorials outside the former concentration camp grounds ==

Three of the Neuengamme satellite camps also serve as public memorials: Bullenhuser Damm, Poppenbüttel, and Fuhlsbüttel. The first of these is a memorial for the 20 children murdered following medical experimentation in the main camp. The second is a former subcamp of Neuengamme in Hamburg-Sasel, where Jewish women from the Lodz Ghetto in Poland were transferred and forced to work in construction. The third is located inside the gatehouse of the Fuhlsbüttel penitentiary. Parts of this complex served as a concentration camp for communists, opponents of the regime and many other groups. About 450 inmates were murdered there during Nazi rule.

A memorial specifically to the French victims of Neuengamme stands in Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

== Ongoing historical research ==
Due to the clearing of the Neuengamme camp and the destruction of its records by the SS and the transportation of inmates to other subcamps or other working locations in 1945, the historical work is difficult and ongoing. For example: in 1967 the German Federal Ministry of Justice stated the camp existed from 1 September 1938 until 5 May 1945. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum states that the camp was established on 13 December 1938 and liberated on 4 May 1945.

<text>Prince of Wales Hospital is a regional acute government hospital located in Sha Tin, New Territories in Hong Kong, China. It is also a teaching hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).

Named after King Charles III at that time as Prince of Wales, and officially opened on 1 November 1982 by Katharine, Duchess of Kent, the hospital went into operation on 1 May 1984. The hospital now provides 1,807 hospital beds and 24-hour accident and emergency service with about 5,500 staff. It is also the regional hospital responsible for the Eastern New Territories serving Sha Tin, Tai Po, North New Territories, Sai Kung and the outlying islands in East New Territories.

The hospital is supported by the Li Ka-shing Specialist Clinics for specialty outpatient services. The Hospital Governing Committee is the ultimate decision-making authority of the hospital. The current chief executive of the hospital is Dr. Beatrice Cheng.

==History==

===Planning and construction ===

In 1974, the Hong Kong government proposed the development of the second medical school in the territory (the first being University of Hong Kong) and a new teaching hospital in Sha Tin, and that became the Faculty of Medicine of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Prince of Wales Hospital. 

The construction of the Prince of Wales Hospital started on 1 December 1979, scheduled to be completed by September 1982, and be operational by May 1983. The plan was to allow the first batch of medical students admitted in October 1981 to start their clinical training at the hospital in July 1983. Unfortunately, the construction was delayed by a year, the hospital was finally completed in November 1983 and went into operation on 1 May 1984.

Despite the delay and change of the schedule, the official opening ceremony was held on 1 November 1982 as originally planned. It was performed by Katharine, Duchess of Kent.

Due to the delay, temporary arrangements were made with United Christian Hospital for clinical teaching of the first batch of medical students, and the teaching activities were gradually transferred from United Christian Hospital to Prince of Wales Hospital.

===Early years===
In 1991, under a reform of the healthcare system, the management of the hospital (and other public hospitals) was transferred from the former Medical and Health Department to the Hospital Authority.

Until the mid-1990s, the hospital was responsible for providing medical services to the nearly 25,000 Vietnamese boat people at Whitehead Detention Centre in nearby Wu Kai Sha, once considered the world&#x27;s largest prison. In 1990, Vietnamese women made up a third of patients within the hospital&#x27;s maternity unit, leading to allegations of strained hospital resources and a subsequent scheme to transfer many pregnant refugees to Queen Elizabeth Hospital instead. By 1994, some Sha Tin residents voiced dissatisfaction that their hospital bore the weight of the refugee&#x27;s medical needs, but then-hospital chief executive Alison Reid responded that the boat people comprised only five per cent of monthly visits to A &amp; E and that the local population was &quot;not being disadvantaged&quot;. Still, in the same year, the hospital proposed setting up a 24-hour clinic inside the refugee camp. The situation ended with the resettlement or repatriation of the refugees under the Comprehensive Plan of Action.

The Sir Yue Kong Pao Centre for Cancer and the Lady Pao Children&#x27;s Cancer Centre was officially opened by Charles, Prince of Wales in November 1994. Built with a donation of HK$120 million from Mr and Mrs Peter Woo, and named after Mrs Woo&#x27;s parents, Sir Yue-Kong Pao and Lady Pao, the centre provides cancer treatments and resources for cancer research and education.

The South Wing of the Li Ka Shing Specialist Outpatient Clinic was completed in June 1997, began operating in the following month, and was officially opened on 29 May 1998 by Li Ka-shing, who donated HK$21 million to its establishment. With a total floor area of 7,930 square metres, the clinic provides additional space to cope with increasing demand for specialist outpatient services in the region.

===SARS epidemic===
In 2003, a severe epidemic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in multiple countries. The epidemic in Hong Kong started with the outbreak in Prince of Wales Hospital on 10 March 2003 when 11 healthcare workers in ward 8A (later renamed 8H) had shown symptoms of atypical pneumonia at the same time. Epidemiologic investigation had linked these cases to a patient who was admitted to ward 8A on 4 March 2003. The patient had previously visited an ill professor from Guangzhou.

The disease was unknown at the time. The infection soon spread extensively in ward 8A, affecting 143 individuals who had direct contact with the patient, including healthcare workers, medical students, other patients in the same ward, visitors, and the patient&#x27;s relatives. It was found that the outbreak was amplified by the use of nebuliser treatment on the patient.

In response to the outbreak, the hospital had implemented several control measures, including restricting access to the 8th floor of the main building (where ward 8A was situated), suspension of some services, and dividing the medical team into a dirty team and a clean team. The dirty team, led by Professor Joseph Sung, was responsible for taking care of SARS patients. The clean team was barred from the SARS wards.

The outbreak in the hospital eventually affected 239 individuals.

===Recent developments===
The hospital has undergone redevelopment since 2007. The Main Clinical Block and Trauma Centre, a fourteen-storey new building, was built on the site of the original helipad and tennis court. With a total gross floor area of 71,500 square metres, the new building provides in-patient services, operating theatres and day services. Construction work started on 23 April 2007 and the new building was opened in late 2010. The hospital began its 10-year phase 2 redevelopment project in 2018. The construction of a new In-patient Extension Block is expected to complete in 2025–2026.

In November 2013, the hospital was accredited by the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards International.

In February 1991, the first twins resulting from pronuclear stage tubal transfer (PROST) in Hong Kong was born at the hospital. PROST is a technique that involves in vitro fertilisation (IVF), followed by transfer of the pronuclear oocytes into the fallopian tubes.

In April 1994, the first baby resulting from sub-zonal insemination (SUZI) in Hong Kong was born at the hospital. SUZI is an IVF technique where sperm is placed between the zona pellucida and the cell membrane of an oocyte.

===Skin bank===
The burns unit of the hospital opened Hong Kong&#x27;s first skin bank on 14 November 1992. It was also the world&#x27;s first comprehensive and multi-purpose skin bank set up to provide frozen pigskin, donated cadaver skin and cultivated skin, and to make and process biosynthetic skin.

==Incidents==

===Wastage of a donor liver===
A donor liver for transplant was wasted on 15 June 2002 due to limited resources at the Prince of Wales Hospital, one of the two liver transplant centres in Hong Kong. The management of the hospital had imposed a quota of one liver transplant a month, and decided not to use the liver as the liver transplant team at the hospital had already performed two liver transplants earlier in June. The hospital was criticised for the decision. Queen Mary Hospital, the other liver transplant centre, was also unable to use the liver because it was engaged in another liver transplant.

The incident led to a review of the liver transplant services provided by the Hospital Authority. The result was to centralise liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital for better allocation of resources and manpower. The liver transplant centre at the Prince of Wales Hospital was officially closed on 5 July 2004.

===Intrathecal administration of vincristine===
An oncology trainee erroneously injected a leukaemia patient with the chemotherapy drug, vincristine, via the intrathecal route instead of intravenous on 15 June 2007. The 21-year-old patient died 22 days later.

The patient was prescribed six oral drugs, intrathecal cytarabine and intravenous vincristine by another doctor, and was injected by the trainee later the day. The patient, feeling pain after the erroneous treatment, attended the Department of Accident and Emergency of the hospital on the next day and was admitted to the Department of Clinical Oncology. The error was not confirmed until 20 June 2007.

A special investigation panel, commissioned after the incident, made recommendations to prevent a recurrence of the incident, including establishing procedures on the transportation, storage, packaging and administration of intrathecal drugs.

===Mis-prescribed medication===
A 73-year-old woman died on 11 July 2011 after an intern mistakenly gave her five medicines intended for another patient on 9 July 2011.

The woman attended the Accident and Emergency Department of the Prince of Wales Hospital on 8 July due to shortness of breath and was admitted to the medical ward. The admission resident doctor prescribed the patient with her usual medications (including aspirin, calcium carbonate, Lasix and Pantoloc). He wrote this on the patient&#x27;s medical notes, transcribed her usual medications onto the patient&#x27;s medication administration record, and then asked the intern to follow up on the management.

An investigation found that the intern perceived that the instruction was to resume the patient&#x27;s usual medication in addition to those already prescribed on the record. She mistakenly transcribed five medications (including Candesartan, Gliclazide, Metformin, Betaloc and Isordil) intended for another patient onto the record.

===Gauze retained in women’s bodies===
Gauze was left in the vaginas of four women who had given birth at the Prince of Wales Hospital in June and July 2012. Three of the women had their episiotomy repair done by an intern in June, and the fourth woman was treated by a resident doctor in July. The problems were noticed when the women went for post-natal check-ups, and the gauze was removed. An investigation found that the intern was at fault for not checking the number of pieces of gauze involved.

After the incidents, the hospital has strengthened the episiotomy repair guidelines, which require the doctor to count the number of pieces of gauze together with a nurse after the procedure, to ensure that no gauze is retained in the patient&#x27;s body.

<text>The Saab 96 is an automobile manufactured and marketed by Swedish automaker Saab from 1960 to January 1980, replacing the Saab 93. The 96 featured aerodynamic two-door bodywork, four-passenger seating and at first a two-stroke, three-cylinder engine, later a four-stroke V4.

==Body design==

Compared with its predecessor, the Saab 93, the 96 featured greater and more easily accessible storage space and a larger rear window. The front end was lengthened for 1965 models, in preparation for a new engine, and the radiator was placed ahead of the engine, rather than above and behind, a leftover from when earlier models had thermosiphon cooling. Both front and rear windows were enlarged slightly for 1968 models.

==Engine==
The Saab 96 had a longitudinally mounted engine layout. As first designed, it had an 841 cc displacement, three-cylinder Saab two-stroke engine. By 1965 this was increased to . An optional version of the engine, with triple carburetors and oil injection, was used in the Sport/Monte Carlo models. The additional power was obtained from a modified cylinder head and filled crankshaft counterweights offering higher overall compression ratio. For 1966 models, the standard 96 841 cc engine, using pre-mix oil, appeared with a three throat Solex carburetor in which the center carburetor handled start, idle, and low speed functions, increasing the power to . The same carburetor had been used in the Sport/Monte Carlo models. A common throttle shaft minimized carburetor synchronization problems.

In 1967, Saab began marketing the 96 V4, with the Ford Taunus V4 engine, a four-stroke 1498 cc V4 engine, originally developed for the 1962 Ford Taunus 15M.

Saab&#x27;s project to source a four-stroke engine was dubbed &#x27;Operation Kajsa&#x27;. The two-stroke option was offered until 1968. Four-stroke engines had been tested before — between 1962 and 1964 Kjell Knutsson and Ingvar Andersson under Rolf Mellde tested three different engines: a 45 PS Lloyd Arabella of 897 cc; a 33 hp BMC A-Series 848-cc engine and a Lancia Appia engine of 1089cc and 48 hp. However Rolf Mellde&#x27;s view that Saab needed to switch to a four-stroke engine was stopped higher up by CEO Tryggve Holm. Mellde then went behind the back of Holm and made contact with Marc Wallenberg, son of Marcus Wallenberg, Saab&#x27;s major stockholder. The coup succeeded and testing could begin. The tested engines were Volvo B18, Ford V4, Triumph 1300, Lancia V4 engine, Opel, Volkswagen and Hillman Imp.

The B18 was the most reliable, but the Ford V4 was not far behind and was significantly easier to fit into the engine bay of the 96. The testing was done in secrecy. Per Gillbrand took a leave of absence and said he was going to run his father&#x27;s paint shop. In reality he went to Desenzano in northern Italy with a 96 V4 prototype for testing. With five months to go before production only seven persons knew about the new engine. To maintain secrecy they rented a house west of Kristinehamn. To keep purchases of V4 specific parts secret they started a front corporation, &quot;Maskinverktyg AB&quot; (meaning &quot;Machine-Tool Company&quot;). The ordinary purchase department at Saab was oblivious to what was going on, something that caused an incident when Rune Ahlberg cancelled the orders for cables for the two-stroke engine and the purchase department called the supplier and sharply told them to keep their deliveries. In the last week of July, just before the summer holidays, information about the new engine was released to further people and they were informed that full-scale production would start in four weeks. To keep secrecy, 40 of the ordinary staff were told to report to work to fix a problem with the disc brakes. Just prior to the official introduction, a journalist noticed a lorry loaded with 96s with V4 stickers on the front bumpers.

The ordinary V4 engines produced between 1967 and 1976 had . Cars from the first year of production had engines with &quot;Ford Motor Company&quot; stampings. For the Swedish 1976 model year, the car - now known as the 96L - had its power reduced to 62 PS due to new Swedish emission regulations. However, the 1977-1980 models had , due to a two-stage Solex 32TDID carburetor. These models were badged &quot;V4 super&quot;. The V4 96 managed 0–100 km/h in 16 seconds. In August 1975 (called &quot;1975B&quot; in Sweden as the less powerful engine was kept for cars marketed after the beginning of the new year, when the new emissions standards took effect), the car received new impact absorbing bumpers similar to those on the 99 and an altered bottom plate which allowed the rear seat to be moved further back.

In the US, the two-stroke engine was called the &quot;Shrike&quot; in 1967 and 1968. Its displacement was reduced slightly for 1968, to 795 cc, to avoid emission regulations which exempted engines under . The V4s used in US cars had a 1500 cc high compression engine with . For the 1971 model year it was switched to a 1700 cc low compression engine, so as not to lose power while meeting new emissions regulations. Stated power dropped to for 1972 as SAE gross figures were abandoned in favor of the lower net ratings. 1973 was the last year that the 96/95 were available in the United States.

===Drive train===
The Saab 96 and its station wagon sibling, the Saab 95, featured column mounted transmission levers. The gearbox originally had three gears, the first unsynchronised. Later, a four-speed option, with synchromesh on first gear, was offered and the three-speed was phased out.

An unusual feature of the Saab drivetrain was a &#x27;freewheel&#x27; (overrunning clutch). This allowed the transmission to run faster than the engine, such as when decelerating, or descending a long hill. Although such freewheels had been provided in other cars before as an economy measure, such as some early post-war Rovers and pre-war Chryslers, they were required in the Saab because of the limited lubrication in the two-stroke engine. A petroil-lubricated two-stroke requires lubrication according to its speed, but provides this lubrication according to the amount of its throttle opening. Where the engine operates at high RPM and low throttle (such as when coasting down a long hill), the lubrication provided may be inadequate. With the freewheel, a coasting engine could reduce its speed to idling, thus requiring only the small lubrication available from the closed, coasting, throttle. In certain higher-performance models and in later two-stroke models, direct injection of oil into the engine from a separate reservoir allowed lubrication to be a function of engine RPM and rendered mixing of oil with gasoline unnecessary.

Freewheeling was retained in the four-stroke variant, until the end of production and in the Saab 99 with the 1709 cc Triumph engine. A minor drawback to the freewheel, particularly for drivers unfamiliar with the Saab, is that it makes engine braking unavailable although it could be manually engaged or disengaged by a control in the foot-well. Fixed wheel disengagement, using the foot, could be difficult, as it involved pulling a &#x27;T handle&#x27; intended for manual operation.

==Suspension==
The front suspension used double wishbones and coil springs, while the rear suspension was a trailing U-beam axle with coil springs. Telescopic dampers were used for all four wheels. Up to model year 1967 models had drum brakes all around. Starting 1967, with the coming of the V4 engine, models were fitted with front disc brakes.

==Saab 96 in rallies==
The Saab 96 was driven most famously by Erik Carlsson, in many international rallies. His most famous successes were first in the 1960, 1961 and 1962 RAC Rallies and first in the 1962 and 1963 Monte Carlo Rallies. It was these successive, top-level victories that put the Saab 96 &#x27;on the map&#x27; and established its reputation for reliability and toughness. Carlsson also competed in the East African Safari Rally, finishing second in 1964. Famous rallying names such as Simo Lampinen, Per Eklund, Pat Moss-Carlsson, Tom Trana, Stig Blomqvist and Carl Orrenius have also been connected with the Saab 96.

===WRC victories===

==Land speed record==
On August 16, 2011 a 1966 Saab 96 driven by Alex LaFortune set a new speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats for stock body production cars with 750 cc engines at 110.113 MPH.

==Production numbers==
The last production date for the Saab 96 was January 11, 1980 (VIN 96806002814), the last VIN (96806002820) was produced on January 3, 1980. These cars were built by Valmet Automotive in Uusikaupunki, Finland.

The Saab 96 was succeeded by the Saab 99, introduced in 1967, and subsequently by the Saab 900, introduced in 1978. A total of 547,221 were made. Its place at the Uusikaupunki plant was taken over by the similar sized Talbot Horizon.

==Postage stamps==
The Saab 96 features on several postage stamps. A Monte-Carlo Rally Saab 96, driven by Erik Carlsson, appears on a Swedish stamp.

<text>Orthodox Celts is a Serbian band formed in Belgrade in 1992 which plays Irish folk music combined with rock elements. Despite their uncharacteristic genre in their home country, the band has been one of the top acts of the Serbian rock scene since their formation, and has influenced a number of younger Serbian bands, most notably Irish Stew of Sindidun and Tir na n&#x27;Og.

The band started their career performing traditional Irish songs and, gradually, introduced more and more of their own material (lyrics mostly written by the band&#x27;s frontman Aleksandar &quot;Aca Seltik&quot; Petrović, music mostly written by band&#x27;s violinist Ana Đokić). All their lyrics are in English, but the group has composed some purely instrumental songs as well. They traditionally celebrate St. Patrick&#x27;s Day with a large concert in Belgrade. The group has released six studio albums to date.

==Band history==
===1990s===
During the mid-1980s, Dušan Živanović, drummer of the pub rock band Roze Poze (&quot;Pink Poses&quot;), wanted to form a band which would perform cover versions of Irish folk songs. Even though he had partially managed to fulfill this idea through some of the songs recorded by Roze Poze, in 1992 he took up playing the accordion and, with Ana Đokić (violin) and Dejan Lalić (mandolin, banjo, tin whistles), formed Orthodox Celts, which initially gathered occasionally for club performances. The band had their first official public appearance on Saint Patrick&#x27;s day in 1992, at the British Council in Belgrade. At the end of the following year, vocalist Aleksandar Petrović joined the band and their performances became more frequent. The band had their first performance with Petrović on 9 November 1993 in Belgrade Youth Center. Soon the band completed the lineup with the arrival of guitarist Vladan Jovković and bassit Dejan Jevtović, with Živanović swtching back to drums, also playing bodhrán on the band&#x27;s performances.

The band released their debut self-titled album in 1994, featuring cover versions of twelve Irish folk songs. Among the covers appeared the songs &quot;The Wild Rover&quot;, &quot;The Irish Rover&quot;, &quot;Weela Weela Walya&quot;, &quot;All For Me Grog&quot;, &quot;Poor Old Dicey Riley&quot;, football chant &quot;A Grand Old Team&quot;, and others. The album featured guest appearances by Viktorija Jevtić on vocals, Sava Đustibek on guitar, Predrag Guculj on bass guitar and Lusila Gluščević on flute. The band presented the album on a series of concerts, mainly in Belgrade&#x27;s Club of Technical Sciences Students, but also performed acoustic sets in smaller venues. At the same time, the band started writing their own songs, keeping up with the existing musical style. On 15 September 1995, at Synagogue in Novi Sad, they held a performance with the band Pachamama, which performed Andean music. The recording of the concert was released on the split live album &quot;Muzičke paralele&quot; (&quot;Musical Parallels&quot;) in 1996.

For the next album, &quot;The Celts Strike Again&quot;, the band, beside the cover versions of traditional songs, included two of their own songs, &quot;Drinking Song&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. As guests on the album appeared actress Ana Sofrenović, who recorded vocals for the track &quot;Loch Lomond&quot;, vocalist of the band Vampiri Aleksandar Eraković, who recorded backing vocals, member of the band Stočari Branko Vitas, who played banjo, Pachamama member Miljan Mihaljčić, who played khene and thin whistle, and Renesansa member Žorž Grujić, who played zurla and Serbian bagpipes. Three promotional videos were recorded for the album, for &quot;Drinking Song&quot;, &quot;Star Of The County Down&quot; and the title track. In 1997, the band, with jazz and world music singer Madame Piano, recorded the song &quot;Galija&quot; (&quot;Galley&quot;), which was released on her album &quot;Predeli&quot; (&quot;Landscapes&quot;). At the time, the band presented their new member, Dejan Popin (tin whistles), and started working on their new release. In September 1998, the band represented FR Yugoslavia on the GEA ethnic music festival in Salonica.

&quot;Green Roses&quot;, released in 1999, featured sixteen songs, half of which were covers of traditional songs, and the other half their original songs. The album was produced by Aleksandar Radosavljević, and as guests appeared Dragoljub Marković (keyboards), Aleksandar Eraković (keyboards) and Goran Stojković (backing vocals). Promotional videos were recorded for the tracks &quot;Rocky Road to Dublin / Down The River&quot;, &quot;Merry Sisters&quot;, &quot;Far Away&quot;, and the title track.

===2000s===
In 2001, Metropolis Records re-released Orthodox Celts debut album with the band&#x27;s songs from the split live album &quot;Muzičke paralele&quot; as bonus tracks. The following year, the band released their fourth studio album, &quot;A Moment Like the Longest Day&quot;. The album songs were written by Đokić (who also sang lead vocals on &quot;Can You Get Me Out?&quot;), Petrović, new bass guitarist Dejan Grujić (formerly of Čutura i Oblaci and Ruž) and Colette Ioanniduoi. The album featured only one cover of a traditional song, &quot;Humors Of Scariff&quot;. Block Out leader Nikola Vranjković produced the album, and the band moved to a more rock-oriented sound than on the previous releases. Promotional videos were recorded for &quot;Can You Get Me Out&quot; and the title track. In 2002, Orthodox Celts performed on the Exit festival alongside Shane MacGowan, and Petrović appeared on the stage with MacGowan performing &quot;The Irish Rover&quot; with him.

In 2007, the band released their fifth studio album, &quot;One, Two... Five&quot;. The album, produced by Nikola Vranjković, brought eleven songs, two of which are covers of traditional songs, and one of them being a cover of the Thin Lizzy song &quot;Sarah&quot;. Unlike the band&#x27;s previous releases, for which most of the band&#x27;s songs were composed by Ana Đokić, songs for &quot;One, Two... Five&quot; were composed mostly by Dejan Grujić. Several months after the album release, Đokić left Orthodox Celts, and was replaced by Nikola Stanojević. During the same year, PGP-RTS released the DVD &quot;World Music Stage&quot;, featuring the recording of performances from the Exit festival World Music Stage, including Orthodox Celts&#x27; performance.

In 2009, the band wrote and recorded the music for the Yugoslav Drama Theatre play &quot;Prevođenje&quot; (&quot;Translating&quot;), directed by Dejan Mijač.

===2010s===
In 2012, Dejan Popin was replaced by Bojan Petrović, leader of the Celtic rock band Irish Stew of Sindidun. In Orthodox Celts Petrović played whistles and sung backing vocals, continuing to front his own band. In March 2012, the band held their traditional Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day&#x27;s day tour, including two 20th anniversary celebration concerts at the Students&#x27; Cultural Centre in Belgarade, one being an unplugged set for a limited number of visitors, and the other a standard tour set. On 12 July 2013, the band performed at the 47th Montreux Jazz Festival. In 2016, Bojan Petrović left Orthodox Celts and Dragan Gnjatović came to his place.
On 13 January 2017, the band released their latest studio album, &quot;Many Mouths Shut!&quot;, previously announced by singles &quot;Save Me&quot;, released in March 2014, and &quot;One / Milk &amp; Honey&quot;, released in March 2015. The album featured seven songs authored by the band and six covers of traditional Irish songs. It was produced by Dejan Lalić and released through the band&#x27;s own label, O&#x27;Celts Records. The album artwork was designed by Italian comic book artist Walter Venturi and inspired by Venturi&#x27;s work on &quot;Zagor&quot;. In 2018, the band performed in Ireland for the first time, in the club Fibber Magees in Dublin. In June 2020, the band, in cooperation with the Gvint brewery, launched their own brand of beer, Orthodox Celts Irish Red Lager.

===2020s===
In 2023, the remastered edition of the album &quot;One, Two... Five!&quot; was released on green vinyl. In February 2024, the band appeared in the non-competitive part of &quot;Pesma za Evroviziju &#x27;24&quot;, the Radio Television of Serbia-organized contest for Serbian entry for the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest, performing a cover of &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot; as a part of ABBA medley.

==Legacy==
In 2021, the band&#x27;s album &quot;Green Roses&quot; was polled 57th and the album &quot;A Moment Like the Longest Day&quot; was polled 91st on the list of 100 Best Serbian Albums Since the Breakup of SFR Yugoslavia. The list was published in the book &quot;Kako (ni)je propao rokenrol u Srbiji&quot; (&quot;How Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll in Serbia (Didn&#x27;t) Came to an End&quot;).

<doc id="332518" wikidata="Q914797" url="?curid=332518" title="Wan Hu">
<text>Wan Hu is a legendary Chinese official described in modern sources as possibly the first man to attempt to use a rocket to launch into outer space. Possibly depicted as the &quot;world&#x27;s first astronaut&quot; and &quot;the first martyr in man&#x27;s struggle to achieve space flight&quot;, NASA named the crater Wan-Hoo on the far side of the Moon after him.

According to some Chinese sources, &quot;Wan Hu&quot; was a title granted to him by the imperial court during the early Ming dynasty, and his real name was Tao Chengdao. As a Ming official, he was interested in technological innovation, particularly concerning rockets. He is said to have died in 1390.

While the legend is well-known, there is no direct evidence surviving to substantiate it. According to Joseph Needham, the story is dubious and may be invented during or after the &quot;Chinoiserie&quot; period, considering the lack of firm historical reference. However, Li Chengzhi has argued for the story&#x27;s plausibility, saying that it may have come from oral transmission by European missionaries who came to China during the late Ming and Qing dynasties, or based on records in an ancient Chinese document that has been subsequently lost.

==Legend==
===Basic story===
The story concerns an imperial Chinese official, referred to as Wan Hu. In order to realize his space dream of reaching the heaven, he sat on a chair with 47 rockets tied to it, holding a kite in each of his hands, and flying into the sky after his servants were ordered to light the fuses to the rockets. But the rockets then exploded, which resulted in the ultimate failure, and Wan Hu was gone when the air cleared. There are also variations of this story.

===&quot;Wang Tu&quot;===
A precursor of the story of Wan Hu appeared in an article by John Elfreth Watkins, published in the 2 October 1909 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, which used the name Wang Tu instead of Wan Hu:
&quot;Tradition asserts that the first to sacrifice himself to the problem of flying was Wang Tu, a Chinese mandarin of about 2,000 years B.C. Who, having had constructed a pair of large, parallel and horizontal kites, seated himself in a chair fixed between them while forty-seven attendants each with a candle ignited forty-seven rockets placed beneath the apparatus. But the rocket under the chair exploded, burning the mandarin and so angered the Emperor that he ordered a severe paddling for Wang.&quot;

The possibly farcical text proceeds to describe several other fictional stories of ancient aviators. A date of 2000 BCE pre-dates the emergence of writing in China by three or four centuries and pre-dates the invention of gunpowder-based rockets in China by about 3,000 years.

===&quot;Wan Hu&quot;===
The legend of &quot;Wan Hu&quot; was widely disseminated by an unreferenced account in &quot;Rockets and Jets&quot; by American author Herbert S. Zim in 1945. Another book from the same year, by George Edward Pendray, describes it as an &quot;oft repeated tale of those early days.&quot;
Early in the sixteenth century, Wan decided to take advantage of China&#x27;s advanced rocket and fireworks technology to launch himself into outer space. He supposedly had a chair built with forty-seven rockets attached. On the day of lift-off, Wan, splendidly attired, climbed into his rocket chair and forty seven servants lit the fuses and then hastily ran for cover. There was a huge explosion. When the smoke cleared, Wan and the chair were gone, and was said never to have been seen again.

The legend of &quot;Wan Hu&quot; according to the United States House Committee on Appropriations in 2006:

Chinese person&#x27;s space dream could be traced to several centuries ago. Back in the 14th century, a Chinese named Wan Hu attempted to send himself into sky by lighting 47 gunpower-packed bamboo tubes tied to his chair. Although he got killed in his bold attempt, Wan has since been widely regarded as the world&#x27;s first person using rockets as a flight vehicle.

According to Walter Sierra, &quot;Though doomed to fail, the Chinese scholar Wan Hu has been universally acknowledged as the first man to try flying to space with the help of rockets. In memory, NASA named the Wan-Hoo crater on the back of the Moon after him&quot;, although according to Mark Williamson most authorities consider the story apocryphal. Meanwhile, some Chinese scholars believe that foreigners from several different countries in the west were unlikely to fabricate a story about ancient Chinese official flying into the sky out of thin air. The tale may be based on the stories told by European missionaries who arrived in China since the late Ming dynasty, and then passed on by word of mouth. Alternatively, these European and American scholars may have indirectly relied on records in an ancient Chinese document that has been subsequently lost. According to William E. Burrows, &quot;If it really happened, Wan Hu had the triple distinction of being the first person to ride a rocket, the first to fly on a self-propelled, heavier-than-air device, and the first rocket pilot to get killed during a test flight.&quot;

==Popular culture==

* In the Tokyo DisneySea attraction &quot;Soaring: Fantastic Flight&quot; a painting of the story of Wan Hu can be seen in the rotunda of the Museum of Fantastic Flight queue area alongside other paintings of legendary attempts at human flight.
* In Kung Fu Panda (film), the main character Po straps himself to a chair with fireworks attached and launches himself into the sky in order to attend the Dragon Warrior reveal ceremony. According to the film&#x27;s director&#x27;s commentary the idea was based on &quot;a myth of a low level Chinese official from the Ming Dynasty who tried to go to the moon by strapping rockets to a chair.&quot;
* In R.A.P. Ferreira &amp; Fumitake Tamura &#x27;s &quot;47 rockets taped to my chair&quot; appearing in the album &quot;the First Fist to Make Contact When We Dap&quot;

<doc id="332523" wikidata="Q794991" url="?curid=332523" title="Bilhah">
<text>Bilhah ( &quot;unworried&quot;, Standard Hebrew: &quot;Bilha&quot;, Tiberian Hebrew: &quot;Bīlhā&quot;) is a woman mentioned in the Book of Genesis. describes her as Laban&#x27;s handmaiden (), who was given to Rachel to be her handmaid on Rachel&#x27;s marriage to Jacob. When Rachel failed to have children, Rachel gave Bilhah to Jacob like a wife to bear him children. Bilhah gave birth to two sons, whom Rachel claimed as her own and named Dan and Naphtali. expressly calls Bilhah Jacob&#x27;s concubine, a &quot;pilegesh&quot;. When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob like a wife to bear him children as well.

The apocryphal Testament of Naftali says that Bilhah and Zilpah&#x27;s father was named Rotheus. He was taken into captivity but redeemed by Laban, Rachel and Leah&#x27;s father. Laban gave Rotheus a wife named Euna, who was the girls&#x27; mother. On the other hand, the early rabbinical commentary &quot;Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer&quot; and other rabbinic sources (Midrash Rabba and elsewhere) state that Bilhah and Zilpah were also Laban&#x27;s daughters, through his concubines, which would make them half-sisters to Rachel and Leah. Scholars believe that these attempts to make Bilhah and Zilpah appear biologically related to Abraham&#x27;s family were a result of anti-foreign views in the postexilic period. It appears more likely that they were foreign like Tamar and Asenath, who were considered to be &#x27;secondary Matriarchs&#x27;.

Bilhah is said to be buried in the Tomb of the Matriarchs in Tiberias.

In the Books of Chronicles, Shimei&#x27;s brothers were said to have lived in a town called Bilhah and surrounding territories prior to the reign of David.

==Reuben&#x27;s adultery with Bilhah==
Reuben was Jacob&#x27;s (Israel) eldest son with Leah. Genesis 35:22 says, &quot;And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father&#x27;s concubine; and Israel heard of it.&quot; As a result of this adultery, he lost the respect of his father, who said: &quot;Unstable as water, you shall excel no longer; For when you mounted your father’s bed, You brought disgrace—my couch he mounted!&quot;

Some rabbinical commentators interpreted the story differently, saying that Reuben&#x27;s disruption of Bilhah&#x27;s and Jacob&#x27;s beds was not through sex with Bilhah. As long as Rachel was alive, say these commentators, Jacob kept her bed in his tent. When Rachel died, Jacob moved Bilhah&#x27;s bed into his tent, who had been mentored by Rachel, to retain a closeness to his favourite wife. However, Reuben, Leah&#x27;s eldest, felt that this move slighted his mother, who was also a primary wife, and so he moved his mother&#x27;s bed into Jacob&#x27;s tent and removed or overturned Bilhah&#x27;s. This invasion of Jacob&#x27;s privacy was viewed so gravely that the Bible equates it with adultery, and lost Reuben his first-born right to a double inheritance.

==In popular culture==
* In the novels &quot;The Red Tent&quot; by Anita Diamant and &quot;Rachel and Leah&quot; by Orson Scott Card, Bilhah and Zilpah are half-sisters of Leah and Rachel by different mothers, following the Talmudic tradition.
* In Margaret Atwood&#x27;s speculative fiction novel &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the theocratic society depicted cites the relationship between Bilhah, Rachel and Jacob as the scriptural basis for the role of handmaids as surrogates to high-ranking men and their infertile wives.
